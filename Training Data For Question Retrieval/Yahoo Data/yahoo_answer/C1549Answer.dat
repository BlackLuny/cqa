8uCjC3GYaa	Those people are called bullies. Christians do it too to atheists that dont believe. You are inferring that Atheists are cruel people, which is false.Some Christians do the same things atheists do, only on the opposite ends of the spectrum.|`|8kIOaJeiaa	I (and many other atheists who aren't sucking Dawkin's cawk) don't see anything wrong with believing in God if it makes you happy. Go you!    What I have a problem with is when people try using their belief to hurt others, take away the rights of people they don't agree with, and condone ignorance. NO PLZ|`|d9WUbMBmaa	For the same reason it seems to be okay for believers to preach to atheists, and they tend to be a lot more aggressive about it. I am atheist and proud, and I never preach a word to anyone, but I've lost count of how many times I've been told I'm going to hell if I don't convert. THAT is a cruel thing to do - 'do things my way or I'll damn you eternally'? I also get told how I'm 'not complete' without religion, which also really irritates me. Especially when I never try to force my own beliefs on anyone else.|`|0LTqyhz1aa	Would it be wrong to dissuade a cancer patient from their snake oil?|`|TEaFwk1Baa	We are just hoping we can convince Eve to eat from the tree of wisdom...|`|jQIGk39vaa	for the same reason we all feel that there is!

There's no way to disprove Him at all!   I don't have anything against Atheists, but please! Let us believe what we believe! There's nothing wrong with it, and it doesn't affect you or anyone else. Plus, since you don't believe in Heaven/Purgatory/Hell, why would it matter if we converted or not? The whole thing is just ridiculous!|`|399b8d4579ac145bf601ea2ecd4bf934aa	some people are simply sick of having the mormon at the door.       and the whole 'you must be SAVED!!!' thing is kinda annoying too|`|Wr09qsYMaa	Because putting hope and happiness into God is a sad thing. The happiness for God is an illusion. Atheist wish only to get people to be happy about themselves and all other humans (living things). Nobody should live their life in fear because you only have one life. God says you are not worthy, that is bull. Every single person is so wonderful and so perfect. Religion makes you always believe you arent good enough, you are bad, you are goig to be judged. Also, just because someone puts hope and happiness into something doesnt mean it is true. I can sit here and hope that my father will come back to life, but I know that will not happen. So instead of me creating some illusion, I face reality and appreciate every single moment instead of thinking this world is bad and after I die something better will come. I dont need anything better, even when my life is going horrible I appreciate that I even have a life. You know out of all the DNA combinations passed down from your ancestors the code had to be exactly correct for you to be born. The chances agains you were a trillion to one. Yet here you are! Appreciate that and love your fellow human thats all that matters!|`|13836b3017c70dbdfed99e90e57ae434aa	I presume the question is directed at atheists on Y!

If you feel disturbed by it, you need to leave.     If you dont want to be disturbed by it, strenghen your faith.|`|Vo9WWQpnaa	For the same reason that you would convert a freethinking person to a closed minded sheep.|`|80a096ea03214dd681f2d17b190e2846aa	Why is it that your religion has spent their entire existence trying to convince everyone else they are right?  I don't try to make anyone believe what I believe, or even that they are wrong.  I'm not positive that what I believe is the truth...anything is possible.    If someone wants to know, then I tell them what I believe.  They can take from that what they want.    If you want your false hope and happiness then you can keep it.  I personally think I'm much better off with actuality and real happiness.|`|Wym7LB7Iaa	Atheists have courtesy not to bother me by knocking on my door trying to spread their word.    Does your belief in God really give you Hope and happiness?  How could any person take that away from you unless you have your doubts.|`|5x3RMByTaa	Obviously because they want to feeling of being right and proving someone wrong, its all about our pathetic need for competition and greed.|`|WynOhlMZaa	I couldn't care less if people believe in God.  All I care about is helping people understand that their opinions relating to things like homosexuality that stem from religious influences should be kept to themselves.|`|dcfce3e99b39f77803362d8f96deaa4faa	I think you raise a good point.  I don't go to the mall at Christmas time to tell the kids lined up to see Santa that it's all a lie.  But there are differences.      1. These are not children, but (mostly) mature adults.  We hold adults to higher standards; we expect them to investigate their beliefs rather than passively accept questionable information.    2.  It would be arrogant of me to assume that they prefer blissful ignorance to reality.  I don't believe that you need to rely on an imaginary deity while I'm strong enough to deal with the truth.  I believe we are both capable of experience true happiness without self-deception.    3.  Their belief may be harmful.  Your right to happiness ends when it interferes with my rights.  If beliefs were really private matters that didn't enter politics, I bet few atheist would feel compelled to say anything.|`|AA11962632	Because their master,    SATAN,    directs them to.|`|AA11668191	I'm surprised how many people took this question personally instead of simply trying to answer it. I've known many an atheist that delights in crapping all over people's religious beliefs and makes a point to inform the believer. They tend to be college aged, which is part of the answer itself. Young adulthood is all about questioning authority and making sure that one will live by rules that they have considered and approved of themselves. There are many reasons to find religion suspect: its institutionalization, the hypocrisy of some believers, the credibility of its historical accuracy, etc. To the atheist, life gets better when religion is dismissed much like the feeling that a believer has when religion is embraced. To a believer, if one sees another expressing attitudes that distress them, they may feel compelled to witness, knowing full well that the other might be unreceptive or even offended by the confrontation. It is no different for an atheist. When they see a believer express characteristics that they find objectionable,  they too may be compelled to address it. Some people are just more tactful than others, which is true for either camp.|`|q2KfJ4JDaa	Civil rights, science, government are all affected by christianity. I want it to stop.     And I hate people that are stupid|`|YZv8Ub3Haa	Religion is mean and cruel. The more people realize how illogical and harmful it is, the happier the world will be.    Do you want to meet us halfway? Have all theists convert to a harmless religion? I would be fine with that.|`|l1ctIW7eaa	i still have hope and happiness...to assume atheists have none is a false premises, therefore your question is invalid|`|U64Aefc6aa	I don't.     If someone is shaken by my beliefs, that's their doing, not mine. I don't try to 'decovert' people.|`|d529cebfe13576f3ddee3e55b4cd08ffaa	And generalizing is stupid. As well as making accusations for the point of trying to start arguments.      'Course, some religious people take non believers simply having the freedom to state their own beliefs as "omg you're trying to take my god away!" which is stupid. Apparently we aren't supposed to have the same freedom of speech.|`|MbCFe1odaa	So it is impossible to have hope and happiness if their is no god??

I never tried to discourage anyone from believing in God. Acutally, Christians were the ones trying to change my views. When I was an Atheist I really couldn't have cared less if someone else believed in God, or didn't believe. I wasn't one of these Atheist who went around bashing religions or religious people. I simply didn't believe and had the same "live and let live" posture that I have now. To each their own. Atheists should only worry about themselves and Christians should do the same. Those who do believe in God only have themselves to answer for; if they're right.|`|FeUmyxqqaa	go back to watching your benny hinn videos that will restore your faith in fairytales|`|ricdSNrhaa	Most athiests don't.  That's the fun part.    I don't go up to random people on the street and tell them there is no God.

I think it is really mean and cruel to force your beliefs on anyone.  Let the Atheists believe in no god, if they want to.  Let everyone practice what ever religion they want.  As long as you are not hurting yourself or anyone else, then what ever you believe is fine.  I don't know why people think that everyone else has to believe what they believe.  I guess if we had the answer to this question, then we would have no wars, etc.|`|fZGEVA1maa	Not [all] atheist are mean about it. It's unfortunate that most are!    You also need to be watchful of those that call themselves Christians but they really aren't. They're the ones I call [make believers]. God will take care of them as well.     Don't let the mean ones get you down. Just ignore them and move on.|`|9ZOWeuPRaa	Its hard for you to understand because you clearly have a deep belief in god. As a atheists I have never tried to convice someone that God doesn't exist, just that I don't believe in God. If someone has tried to convice you that God isn't real, don't be upset. You have your beliefs, and thats perfectly fine, its no one elses business what each individual believes. Most Atheists are Atheists because of their lack of information about relgion and God. So, most likely, the Atheists who (I assume) upset you does not even know what they are talking about. And I agree with you, it is a cruel and mean thing for someone to do, but it isn't just Atheits. No one likes having others opinions forced on them and alot of people do that, not just Atheists.|`|AA11124121	The usual answer here...fear..hopelessness, anxiety over the future..clinically depressed, suicidal, despairing, most things those without faith suffer from.

And even now, I don't understand why humans are the way they are. I want to save them, but they simply laugh at me or deny my existence.      And I'm not joking. I would never joke about something like this.

Anyways, you don't sound like a prostitute, you actually sound WORSE than a prostitute since you're having sex and PAYING FOR IT.

People who have faith have the philosophy that some things are more important than the pursuit of truth (like being happy, believing you'll live forever, being comfortable in your culture, believing that doubt is better than risking divine retribution, etc).    Education is correlated with religiosity... but I don't think it's as strongly correlated as a person's general life philosophy.|`|8d9b994728c633e86c2395da11a394a1aa	Religion and education should not be related. This would mean atheists are uneducated since they lack faith. Albert Einstein? Sigmund Freud? I don't exactly think they're uneducated.

059d87e3aa0ffb99600ad070b781c49baa	I followed a Celtic Wiccan path for over a decade.  With time and life circumstances I felt my focus changing and I needed something with greater personal significance.  I researched it for almost a year before deciding to put Druid ways as my predominate path system.  Granted no one can be a "true" Druid, because the old mysteries were for the most part lost since it was a mostly oral passed tradition.  I myself love how the new druid order is rooted with a sense of duty to your community and the world in which you reside.     If I were to sum it up a Modern Druid is much like a mixture of a Ceremonial and Celtic witch with strong desires to help our world and not just ourselves.|`|BpNrx9Viaa	you should probably post this in the spiritual section

You sir are an idiot of the worst kind.|`|utbfT0APaa	You better learn to write and speak first.|`|U24VtSlZaa	There are too many different varieties of Christianity for you to give one rule that covers all.    About the only thing all Christians can agree on is that abortion is a tragic thing that should not happen.  I'm pretty sure all Christians would prefer that the need for abortion would never arise.    Some would give the mother the right to choose at any time under any circumstance.  Some would give the mother the right to choose under limited circumstances, and there is wide variation on what the circumstances should be.  Others would not allow it under any circumstances at all.|`|aO4iCwtoaa	In Judaism abortion is not only allowed, but required if the mother's life is in danger.   If the mother's health is in danger, she must consult with a rabbi to see if abortion is permitted.  It is not permitted as a form of birth control, but before the 40 day mark (when the heartbeat starts) there is a lot more leeway than after.       Judaism does not believe that life starts at conception - a fetus is not considered the same status as a person until it takes its first breath or 3/4 of the body is delivered.  Until then it is considered to have the same status as a limb of the mother.|`|5mCAscCnaa	I'm not decrypting his horrible grammar, speech, and acronyms.

But I'm going to give you an answer anyway.  In Christianity, we believe that every soul is important and meant for a purpose here on Earth, and that abortion takes away that person's right to living.   I personally think that people need to have better knowledge of and access to birth control to prevent pregnancies, and I think that if an unwanted pregnancy occurs that the parents should either choose to raise the child or give the baby up for adoption. I know many whose lives have been enriched by being able to adopt.    From www.lds.org :  "Church leaders have said that some exceptional circumstances may justify an abortion, such as when pregnancy is the result of incest or rape, when the life or health of the mother is judged by competent medical authority to be in serious jeopardy, or when the fetus is known by competent medical authority to have severe defects that will not allow the baby to survive beyond birth. But even these circumstances do not automatically justify an abortion. Those who face such circumstances should consider abortion only after consulting with their local Church leaders and receiving a confirmation through earnest prayer."|`|55367edb4de9198815d3ab5933d9f858aa	The basic conflict between people about abortion is the right to life vs. women's rights.  Jews and Christians say that abortion is murder because killing a fetus is the same as killing an adult or any other person. Since "Thou shalt not kill" is one of the 10 Commandments, it's a sinful act.  Other people say that women should have the right to choose, regardless of the circumstances.    Hope this helps!|`|k1YaKEYnaa	I'll make it very short. "You're not supposed to get one." But "abortion" was not around at time these holy books were written. However, doing those scripture time periods often children were left on the side of the street even when they were too young to survive on their own (which is still not a issue Jesus or any old scripture character discussed specifically.)     So again No, in Christinity and Judism there are no specific rules regarding abortion. Only present time translations and opinions from clergy regarding abortion.|`|UsH9kex3aa	It's not that clear.

6100f239c1abd562ada33e5323d1c871aa	As salaamu 'alaikym, my friend.    Yours is a very thought provoking question and I, for one, appreciate the opportunity to answer it.    Insha'Allah, Sharia Law should be practiced amongst Muslims withhin the context of their dealings with one another.    However, if the country in which they are abiding is not a Muslim or Islamic nation, then they must also abide by the laws of said nation with the laws of that nation taking a precident so as to be good citizens of that country.    It should also be noted that many Westerners have been badly milslead by their various media sources and assume that many and various cultural acts, such as supposed "honor killings" and other such acts are Sharia and they are not.    It should also be obvious that some of the societal actions regarding theives, adulterers, etc., would and should be modified so as to be in keeping with the laws of the nation one abides in.  Such persons who commit such acts could be shunned or ostricized from the ummah, as an example of possible modifications.    However, the many and various acts which are legal in most Western and many Asian nations that are questionable as to the morality of the same  must never be adopted by the ummah.    Following Islam must be a personal choice even for those person who grew up in a Muslim family or an Islamic nation and there can be no compulsion in regards to religion as the same is clearly stated in the Holy Qur'an.  Alhumdulillah!    Enforcing the Sharia on non-Musilms would not be fair to them.    Jazak'Allah khair for asking such a question so as to create discussion and debate and hopefully, that will lead to knowledge and understanding which, insha'Allah, will lead to peace and brotherhood.    Ma'a salaam|`|dPJr1Lbmaa	I am a British Citizen and I have always lived by the laws of my country before and after becoming a Muslim. I don't feel the need for Sharia law but if in the future if I live Insha Allah in a country with Sharia law then I will be happy to abide by that law.   Not all muslim countries have Sharia law either, so why would I feel the need for the laws in a non muslim country to be changed.  People also don't seem to understand that even if Sharia Law where to be applied in the UK its only for Muslims not anyone else.  Any country I visit, I abide by there laws.  The UK is full of non muslim UK citizens who are in prison for breaking the laws of the country and no one is questioning them abiding by the laws of there country.   I have never broken the law in the UK and never have any intentions of doing so. I have never broken the law in any other country i have visited and never have any intentions to do so there either.|`|0yTM98Odaa	I'm not Muslim.  None of those countries and places you mentioned would ever accept sharia law.  If they accepted laws like stoning etc in the UK I would leave.  I don't want to live in a country were people live in fear and people get their hands chopped off for stealing.    Besides how could you have Muslim law in Christian countries?  It simply wouldn't work.  Whats wrong with our current laws anyway!    Edit:    I hope that didn't come across offensive but I like democracy and don't agree with the death penalty especially not for adultery!  I don't see why anyone would want to change our laws in the west, they are fine and fair as they are.    Edit:    I believe in separation from church and state because not everyone is Christian but the majority are which is what I mean by Christian countries, I know not all describe themselves as Christian.  My point is under our laws everyone is treated equally and I don't agree with sharia law which is what I'm trying to say.|`|VN30ib8eaa	It would be UnIslamic to implement Shariah laws in a non-Muslim country.

Even so, Shariah laws should only be enforced on the Muslim population, not the others. This may appear to be almost like a discrimination on the population, but then the overall positive effects of the practice will emanate social justice being put in place as a true Muslim way of life, for non-Muslims to observe and perhaps emulate.|`|CwqW45Rmaa	I would love to have Sharia law implemented in the U.S.  Unfortunately, that won't ever happen.
BtygS0Hraa	If people actually though semi-clear and reasonably, abortion would not have to be a crime, because the act itself is already a given crime:  Murder in the 1st Degree.  An abortion is the acknowledged murder of an unborn fetus.  You do the math, the penalty for murder is life in prison or death penalty.  I understand that there are reasons for some abortions (just as their are exceptions to murder, such as self-defense), such as product of rape or if it endangered the mother, but other than that, people should just consider adopting out their baby.|`|jdRKZe18aa	It's not a CRIME it's a sin - one that in fact might be quite difficult if not impossible to REPENT from (like other murder) if you think about it. FULL repentance requires you to acknowledge, confession, restore and recompense.  HOW can you restore or recompense in the case of abortion?   You can't... which is precisely WHY - or one reason why, abortion (like murder) is so horribly wrong.      Any penalty or CONSEQUENCE that is attached to this ACT will take place between the woman and God  because we can't BEGIN to make such a judgment and I wouldn't want to either.  It will be a judgment of eternal consequence.|`|8Y583Fluaa	to be sucked into a vacuum and suffacated...thank God for Jesus....Derik is a idiot and obviously never seen the pictures of a abortion|`|wR1XyyrUaa	$20 fine.

FE|`|ceb16f840e65f504a04160992a9e8736aa	it pretty much is. "Ph" makes a "ph" sound.  The "o" is a long "o".  The n, e, t, i, and c are all pronounced exactly like the sound.    I guess depending on your accent you might pronounce the "o" as a short "u", but that is just your accent.

No, seriously, I do.  It's because humans don't consider the consequences of their actions.    Whether you blame industrial emissions, bovine emissions, nocturnal emissions, (j/k), or what ever, humans are always pushing nature's buttons, and activating positive feedback mechanisms.    As an example of a positive feedback mechanism, there's the arctic melting in Greenland that feeds fresh water into the deep-sea conveyor belt, disrupting the ocean currents, leading to El Ni?o events that cause further arctic melting.|`|fZGEVA1maa	No.    It's my opinion that people need to stop thinking so much of themselves.

They first said that aerosol , factories, and auto emissions caused global warming.  Technically we are still in an ice age since both polar caps are covered in ice.  The global temp will continue to go up and down without any contributions from humans.  I believe we do need to be good stewards of our planet, it makes common sense.  We have had at least 3 ice ages in earth's history and we were not part of any of the end of those ice ages.  Maybe it was the  hairspray used on all of those woolly mammoths.

The rate of gasses that cause global warming has gone up dramatically after the industrial revolution. In other words, human activity.|`|D9lMg7A2aa	Kind of moot after the news the other day, though I don't think it is human activity AT ALL.    Global warming 'irreversible' for next 1000 years: study    1 day ago    WASHINGTON (AFP)  Climate change is "largely irreversible" for the next 1,000 years even if carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions could be abruptly halted, according to a new study led by the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).    The study's authors said there was "no going back" after the report showed that changes in surface temperature, rainfall and sea level are "largely irreversible for more than 1,000 years after CO2 emissions are completely stopped."    NOAA senior scientist Susan Solomon said the study, published in this week's Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences journal, showed that current human choices on carbon dioxide emissions are set to "irreversibly change the planet."|`|AA11264399	That's what the evidence indicates, yes.    Climatologists have been constructing computer models of the climate and all known influences upon it for decades.  Naturally they have improved as we have more and better data, especially from satellite observations.  The best models now match reality pretty well - in other words, if you put in all the data about how the Earth's orbit changes, how the sun's activity varies with time, how volcanic activity affects the opacity of the atmosphere and so on, what the model predicts the climate *should* be, under those conditions, closely matches what is actually *measured* in terms of temperature, rainfall etc.    However... for the last 50 or 60 years or so, the models *only* match reality if you also factor in *human* influences - the carbon dioxide we put into the atmosphere from industry and so on.  If you leave out the human factors then the models substantially diverge from reality.  This indicates that the models are accurate, and that human factors really are having a significant impact on the climate.    The global atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide has increased from a pre-industrial value of about 280 ppm to 379 ppm in 2005. The atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide in 2005 exceeds by far the natural range over the last 650,000 years (180 to 300 ppm) as determined from ice cores.  Eleven of the last twelve years (19952006) rank among the 12 warmest years in the instrumental record of global surface temperature (since 1850) - coincidence?  Unlikely.|`|ni6SCUm9aa	Yes, obviously. CO2 emissions from our factories, cars, and other industries cause greenhouse gasses to go up, and so trapped radiation from the sun causes out planet to warm up.|`|oMj8WAHFaa	yes because we have polluted the earth with so much toxins, the bible says that because of the sin of man this earth has been doomed and cursed and in the revelation it shows a new earth and skies were formed.  so technically nothing we can do for now.|`|0hdo4WORaa	Yes. Some people blame is on cows farting, if that is so it is a consequence of factory farming, by humans. Than there is the production of greenhouse gases by factories, cars, power stations etc, burning fossil fuels, massive deforestation; we're killing ourselves|`|aPuUuWlLaa	A strong contributing factor worsening part of a larger cycle and as such it makes sense to minimize where we can the amount we are responsible for and able to control. Just about every credible science source involved in this research is in agreement that humans are influencing and worsening climate change, including the USA government's EPA.|`|Q1XUe0PDaa	Human activity is making a significant contribution but natural Non human factors have an effect too. The difficulty with your question is the word "primary" Some scientists say that more study needs to be done before that qualifier can be used while others say the preponderance of the evidence is already in favoring that conclusion.|`|lh8Tn02Naa	Global warming happens.  In earlier ages the poles have been completely free of ice: technically we are still in an "ice age".    The SPEED AT WHICH the climate is changing is due to human activity and that's what's scary.  It's happening too fast for us to adjust to it without making unacceptable sacrifices in our lifestyle.  So we'll go on being selfish, the planet will keep getting hotter, and by the time our grandchildren pay the price for our short sightedness we'll be long gone.      Unless of course we all start taking the Gospel seriously.|`|AA10691226	Primary???    The actual definition of 'global warming' is 'climate change caused by human activity.'  Therefore, the answer is YES.    'Global warming' got misidentified, misnamed and miscommunicated. They just don't make geophyisicists (sp?) the way they used to. Ben Franklin was the first to practice this important area of science and he had a flair for naming and defining that any product manager would envy. Today's scientists are poorly educated and communicate in gobbledygook, which has resulted in both the public and many leaders dismissing both them and their scientific findings.    Yes, humans have measurably impacted the entire ecosystem of the globe to the extent that the icebergs are melting which is triggering changes disastrous to most life on Earth. See? Franklin could have captured that in 2 or 3 simple words, a talent as important as figuring out what is actually happening.    Oh well . . . .

For instance, "Bera desu" (I'm Bella) or "Neko desu" (it's a cat). Pronounced Dess, past tense is Deshita (deshtah). that's polite- informal is Da and Datta.|`|AQPmrsVSaa	"Desu" is a Japanese linking verb that sort of means "to be," though it's more of a grammatical feature that complements the subject and indicates tense and politeness, than a word with actual meaning. It's often used at the end of Japanese sentences.    If some guy in Halo was saying it, it might be because "desu" is a bit of an internet meme, or in-joke, originating from people imitating how some anime characters end every sentence with "desu" to sound cute.|`|TyhgDrzcaa	1st answer is right
JI7NQ9TNaa	That's called "burning your bridges".    It may be that your boss will have words with the manager...but unless they actually get fired ( a long shot), that same manager might be on the other end of the phone in five years when someone calls to check your references.    People can say things without saying them.  A simple "no, I would never hire her back" can make all the difference.    Just give your notice...and if he has concerns, he might contact you in the future. But be careful...and good luck.    Also, don't give notice until the other job is locked in!|`|de947568c9e8173e12d8a9930bab48abaa	Never mention anything negative about anyone in the company no matter what their position is, it always comes back to haunt you.

If your boss does not follow up and ask what who was less than pleasant to work with, then leave it alone.

I recommend that you keep your resignation letter brief, professional, and factual.      If the company cares why you're leaving, they'll conduct an exit interview with you and you can explain your situation then. If they don't conduct such an interview, then what you said in your letter won't make much difference.     If you need to vent or tell someone about it, tell your outside friends or a counselor, because you need to put it behind you to move on.|`|f6fCixDnaa	"Due to ettiquette and personal differences with a certain collegue i have decided to accept an offer at another office?"

You will only hurt yourself, and one day this person will be found out. As you said you may need them as a reference, or you may want to come back in the future. No matter how much someone has it coming, never, never, burn your bridges behind you. Do not mention any bad blood you had in your new job interviews. They will think you are a troublemaker and not want to hire you. Acceptable reasons for leaving a company are more money, chance for advancement elsewhere, Shorter commute, different hours and things like that. Don't say that job sucked, or so and so was a jerk. It will make you look bad.|`|lgyPxg26aa	Don't put anything like that in writing.      Your resignation letter should say:    Dear Mr/Mrs/Ms >>>>>>>>>>>>    I am resigning my position as of  DATE.    Thanks you.    Your Name Here.    That's it.  You do not owe a reason or any kind of explanation and any comments about anyone in the company is only going to come back to bite YOU.  The person you are writing about will be there to stab you in the back and you will not be there to defend yourself.    If you tell the owner why you are quitting and you haven't tried to tell him/her before they are going to ask why you didn't bring this up when there was a chance they could help you.      Just get your new job, leave this one and chalk it up to experience.|`|Y6odIQgJaa	Be careful what you put into writing because it can come back and bite you in the butt.

Good luck!|`|OujhXy2yaa	Leave it out of your resignation letter but bring it up in person so that the owner is aware of the problem.  Don't be harsh about it but let the owner know, for sure.  If you are leaving your job because of this I would have a chat with the owner before resigning, he/she may have a solution to the problem|`|c1b4b7f8e314ae3b676971e55c6665dcaa	I am a very practical person, therefore I will give you some practical advice.  Only do what will enhance your own status.  Forget vengeance, if that is your purpose in reporting a rude office manager.      If you believe that reporting this rude office manager will regain your job, then do it.  But I really doubt that will happen.    And anything you write will become part of history.  And you never know when something you write will come back to haunt you.      Examples:    That office manager may someday be your boss again by joining your new company.    That office manager may be related to or friends of your new boss.    That office manager may be fired for your comments and include you in a lawsuit.    I don't see any upside to reporting the person in a resignation letter.  However, if the owner asks you point blank for the reason you are leaving, you MIGHT be able to politely suggest that you are regretfully leaving due to the actions of that office manager.  But again, don't expect anything positive as a result.|`|AA11946005	I would never put something like this in a letter, but might if asked for further details say something to the effect of "I think my work style did not mesh well with John's, so that, combined with the issues I mentioned in my letter, made me look for a new opportunity."  This lets him know in a neutral way you had issues with John's style without being too blunt.  You never know if and when the office mgr could turn up in a place where you work in the future, so you want to prevent burning all you bridges, past and future.|`|Ek24XkeCaa	It may be too late for this, but in the future write down in your planner when someone acted unprofessional toward you.  In your resignation letter you could put that you had differences of opinion with other coworkers or you could say there were personality conflicts that you couldn't repair.  The same thing happened to me and I didn't give 2 weeks notice.  I justt quit.  Good luck.|`|O7SshRl6aa	NO, No, no.  NEVER tell them why you are really leavning.  NEVER burn your bridges.  You will see these people again, they will give references for you, etc.  Keep it nice, even if you don't mean it.  And dont' turn in a resignation letter until you have your hiring at the new company in writing.  Write  simple, polite letter like:      [Date]  Dear Supervisor,    This letter is to inform you of my intended resignation, effective on [date].    I have enjoyed working for you and Smith Company.    Yours truly,  [Your Name]

ckdYl9Znaa	Poverty is the shortage of common things such as food, clothing, shelter and safe drinking water, all of which determine our quality of life. It may also include the lack of access to opportunities such as education and employment which aid the escape from poverty and/or allow one to enjoy the respect of fellow citizens. According to Mollie Orshansky who developed the poverty measurements used by the U.S. government, "to be poor is to be deprived of those goods and services and pleasures which others around us take for granted."[1] Ongoing debates over causes, effects and best ways to measure poverty, directly influence the design and implementation of poverty-reduction programs and are therefore relevant to the fields of public administration and international development.    Although poverty is mainly considered to be undesirable due to the pain and suffering it may cause, in certain spiritual contexts "voluntary poverty," involving the renunciation of material goods, is seen by some as virtuous.    Poverty may affect individuals or groups, and is not confined to the developing nations. Poverty in developed countries is manifest in a set of social problems including homelessness and the persistence of "ghetto" housing clusters.[2]    The effects of poverty may also be causes, as listed above, thus creating a "poverty cycle" operating across multiple levels, individual, local, national and global.    Those living in poverty and lacking access to essential health services, suffering hunger or even starvation,[88] experience mental and physical health problems which make it harder for them to improve their situation.[89] One third of deaths - some 18 million people a year or 50,000 per day - are due to poverty-related causes: in total 270 million people, most of them women and children, have died as a result of poverty since 1990.[90] Those living in poverty suffer lower life expectancy. Every year nearly 11 million children living in poverty die before their fifth birthday. Those living in poverty often suffer from hunger.[91] 800 million people go to bed hungry every night.[92] Poverty increases the risk of homelessness.[93] There are over 100 million street children worldwide.[94] Increased risk of drug abuse may also be associated with poverty.[95]    Diseases of poverty reflect the dynamic relationship between poverty and poor health; while such infectious diseases result directly from poverty, they also perpetuate and deepen impoverishment by sapping personal and national health and financial resources. For example, malaria decreases GDP growth by up to 1.3% in some developing nations, and by killing tens of millions in sub-Saharan Africa, AIDS alone threatens the economies, social structures, and political stability of entire societies.[96][97]    Those living in poverty in the developed world may suffer social isolation. Rates of suicide may increase in conditions of poverty. Death of a breadwinner may decrease a household's resilience to poverty conditions and cause a dramatic worsening in their situation. Low income levels and poor employment opportunities for adults in turn create the conditions where households can depend on the income of child members. An estimated 218 million children aged 5 to 17 are in child labor worldwide, excluding child domestic labor.[98] Lacking viable employment opportunities those living in poverty may also engage in the informal economy, or in criminal activity, both of which may on a larger scale discourage investment in the economy, further perpetuating conditions of poverty.    Unfortunately, there is a high risk of educational underachievement for children who are from low-income housing circumstances. This often is a process that begins in primary school for some less fortunate children. These children are at a higher risk than other children for retention in their grade, special placements during the schools hours and even not completing their high school education. [99] There are indeed many explanations for why students tend to drop out of school. For children with low resources, the risk factors are similar to excuses such as juvenile delinquency rates, higher levels of teenage pregnancy, and the economic dependency upon their low income parent or parents. [99]    Intellectual competence is key to the educational attainment. Brighter people, whether old or young, tend to have more economic power, go further in their education, and often lead much healthier, much more prestigious lives. So children with high abilities and low income must be supported and research should identify methods for discovering and reaching these young students. [99] Early childhood education and assisted learning in the home are highly considered as methods that are supported by plenty of careful study, observation and research. [99]    In 1972, came the Carolina Abecedarian Project at the Frank Porter Graham Child Development Center of the University of North Carolina. The progra

awRjB9Axaa	Well it can be both I suppose. Like two sides of the story. Cliques can give a person/people a feel of belonging an idea where they stand.  It gives you people to hangout with. But it can also be a very bad thing they can be used to bully other people. Some people become very obsessed and nasty when dealing with cliques. Like social rankings such as "jocks" "outcasts" popular people, losers, nerds. Which can make people feel bad about themselves. I've seen bad cased scenarios like suicides known as bullycides. You can see videos about kids who were bullied so much they killed themselves which are extremes. Hope this helps.|`|d1MBoAtHaa	I think that cliques are bad. They are a social group, but sometimes that social group puts other people down and tell the people in the clique that you cant hang out with a certain person. If they are really your friends then they would accept who you hang out with and wont judge you about the fact with you hang out with someone that the clique does not like. you are a individual person and you can decide for yourself you to hang out with and who to not hang out with!|`|7nGwou8uaa	definitely bad, if you mean the stereotypical cliques. like the jocks and cheerleaders and nerds and whatnot.|`|Is3pmbbKaa	It depends on what kind of cliques. It's not really good for someone to be in one, because it's better to keep a wide horizon of friends and stay social with other people.|`|HI0oQriqaa	inevitable|`|f6f40965eb7d5df6aa94440ec71e32dcaa	I don't see the big deal, provided that they're not being cruel to anyone else.  I don't see why people should feel obligated to befriend anyone.      I'm betting that majority of the people that have issues with cliques are just mad because they weren't "allowed" in one.  Sad, really.|`|3yacqUltaa	Bad. Kids feel left out if they aren't in the "cool" clique, they get made fun of for being in the "nerd" clique, etc. Nothing good comes out of them.

I have at least a friend in every clique and its annoying hanging out because whos mad at who. I personally hate cliques.|`|G7RCYINQaa	you will find out that when you grduate cliques don't matter. I only talk to maybe 2 or 3 of my high school friends on a weekly basis. the others I see maybe every 2 or 3 weeks or hardly ever. There are more important things in life.|`|GOYPKp3Baa	Cliques are pretty annoying but then again, I like being around people I feel comfortable around :) But it's not at all cool, when you want to hang out with someone that's different than you.|`|suVispAAaa	Bad. They make people who they know really want to be in the clique do bad things to stay in the clique. The clique will do horrible things to those who so want to be part of the "clique", like they would tell those who want to be part of their group so bad to do things that they the "clique"  would never do or even the people who want to be in their group would never do otherwise. Those will do those things because they want to be part of the coolest group in school. Those who want to be in the clique usually do not admit the shows they watch or music they listen to unless the cool kids watch the same thing or listening to the same music or else the cool kids would make fun of them. They make people do anything they say. Cliques are so not worth my time.|`|sa4W2a3oaa	BLEH xP  Terrible.|`|1cfd26f25289a1245a86fe8db1bf3dc2aa	Bad.

But in other schools they would be bad.|`|QdXvBOL7aa	its good and bad. its good that there are groups, so everyone has whats in common,. but the bad is that some ppl cant find their groups. and there all alone.|`|iNbxf0CTaa	Although believed to be bad, Cliques are a very good thing, and gives everyone a chance to be in their own group. Cliques are made of people that enjoy the same things, so what is so bad about being with people that like the same things as you? Cliques are sometimes exclusive, but usually because they do not enjoy the same things as you.|`|CiMaltLBaa	its bad, extremely bad, you become isolated from other kids in the school, plus in my high school we were pretty much racially divided!  Me and my friends were all mixes, east indians, chinese, white, black, filipino, etc|`|AYdpkCRUaa	Cliques in high school are good.  Great actually.  These Cliques or groups are groups of teens who have the same intrrest or have been friends for a while.  I dont see anything wrong with that|`|MpG8n0vMaa	It really depends on what your personality is like and who u can figure out with out even talkin to them and know they are not who u wanna b around.|`|LAcH71Ooaa	i think its horrid. but u gotta know wat a clique really is. if its a group of friends that tends to hang out together its not necessarily a clique. only when they ONLY hang out with certain people and r very exclusiv bout who they let into their group|`|XKhNw221aa	Good, they provide a real life setting to social structure outside of high school. In any sort of work, or in college, there will still be the cool kids, the nerds, the princesses, ect. The cliques in high school just offer a safer environment until the kids are ready.|`|UEA4Uli9aa	I think they are good because they help you find people hat she similar intrests as you but all in the same they are bad because people like me don't exactly fit into a clique and the whole certian cliques hate other ones. That's nonsence :(   I would say more bad than good..|`|K5L63wbeaa	You cant really say either way.    it would be great if there were no such thing as cliques and everyone got on with everyone, that way no one would be left out and everyone would have a sense of belonging.    They are impossible to prevent though, because people will always have best friends and will always hang out wit them more, creating there clique. This leaves people out, creates a sense of exclusion.    Also, you need to have close friends as opposed to being friends with everyone because if your friends with everyone your not likely to be close (really close) to anyone and you don't have that sense of boding and friendship like you would with close friends.    To summarise, cliques are bad but necessary, I think anyways.|`|EPVW8Ukeaa	I think they're bad because they sometimes cause people to just stay in that one clique and not experience anything outside of it. For example at my school all the drama people hang out together and all the football players hang out together. Why can't everyone just be friends with everyone?!|`|z2jk6Fkraa	neither|`|X10n5VT2aa	good.. you learn to suceed no matter who you are|`|idmz2tvraa	Cliques are annoying. It's boring to have only one type of friends. It's better to get to know people who have a variety of interests.|`|QDEId9Asaa	bad, because thats y we still have racism its because people are too afraid to hang out, outside their social group which are usually composed of people of their own race|`|QiGj0jNEaa	I say there will always be cliques and that will never change. But one should be friends and friendly with everyone while still keeping one or two really good friends but in the big picture they have alot of friends and dont really belong to one cceratin clique.|`|qkmsixWXaa	depends, it's nice for people with common interests to hang out with each other, but it can create tension between groups. In a way, it can be a security blanket for these people.|`|37DTSXZJaa	they are bad.why can't everyone just get along and hand out with each other? why does it have to be a popular thing..i think it's plain stupid like that Movie mean girls absoloutly rdiculous...young girls are watching that stuff and wanting to act like that....but the sad thing is is that high school is like that:(|`|fSwpE4ziaa	the whole "clique" thing doesnt really exist, of course your gonna hang out with people like you, there really aren't any exclusive social groups in high school, thats all just some crap the noggin channel produces that some stupid little kids are gonna believe cause they see it on high school musical|`|h70Vb5KMaa	Cliques help the generic kids fit in with each other. I'm not sure it's possible for everyone to just get along.|`|mr0mHPNaaa	Cliques are not inherently bad. It's good for high school students to find people who share common interests and develop a support system and community.    However, students should avoid creating exclusionary cliques. If a clique becomes too exclusive, to the point that it keeps outside people at a distance, it no longer benefits the student because it shrinks their support system.     So, there's nothing wrong with communities in high school made up people with common interests. It helps students to have friends and find out more about themselves. However, students should be a part of multiple cliques and be open to new people.|`|QZfpGWPIaa	WHO CARES!!!! I personally don't join any cliques. I have my friends and that's all i need. I 'm not into the whole cheerleader/jock/goth/nerd thing. It doesn't matter because we're all human...at least I hope we are...and that only adds to the discrimination of society.

Ask her if she thinks she will be able to pay the next 2 rents. If she says no, then ask if she thinks you should start looking for a new roommate because you cant afford to pay both her and your share.  Atleast try to be a good friend by helping her search for jobs when you are free. Hopefully she will find one soon.    ~Naomi~|`|AA11946005	I agree with the person who said that it's not good to tell her it's okay, when in fact it isn't.  You cannot beat her over the head for this, but you have to let her know you don't have the funds to cover everything if she cannot contribute her full amount towards the budget.

A. P. How long did she work at this job? Since it was her first job and it sounds like she didn't really have much time built up there she may not even have enough money in the Unemployment program to get any benifits. You need to sit down and talk with her honestly about what her options are and what will have to happen if she can't pay rent for March. Ask her seriously what her plans are for finding work and if she feels positive about it. It's normal for you to be concerned but don't get too worked up yet.  First off, she can pay February rent. That gives her some time to get income enough coming in to pay her next months rent. Encourage her. Don't ride her every minute about "Did you find a job yet?" or "Did you look for work today?" Waitressing jobs are wonderful to start in as you can rake in some good money TIPS wise. I know it doesn't sound terribly exciting but it's work and having work right now is a big plus. Let me tell you about tip money. My second oldest daughters first job was a waitress in a popular family owned diner. She became quite good at it and brought in quite a bit in tips every day. She often made more in tips at the end of the work week than her actual pay. She put every single tip she made in the bank account she set up just for that purpose. She now works in a large hospital handling the insurance forms, etc. in her specific department. she works the Hospital 5 days a week. She works the Diner now only 1  day a week, Saturday and continues to put each dime she makes in tips into that account. Also since she only works one day a week at the Diner now, she puts that money into the account as well. Last year, and I am NOT over exaggerating, she put a nice fat eleven thousand dollars into a money market account. All money she made in tips and one day a week at a diner. She pays rent and works hard. She started literally with NOTHING and she only just turns 20 in a couple of months.  Hang in there. Don't give up on your friend. Give her a chance to prove herself. If she obviously makes no move whatsoever to get it together, then you know what to do. Find a new roommate.    ~Kim~|`|de947568c9e8173e12d8a9930bab48abaa	She needs to go into emergency overdrive, register at a minimum of three employment agencies, (I registered at 7) and check in with them at last 3x weekly, post her resume on monster and yahoo check craigslist and the following customer service jobs from home:  alpineaccess  cloud10  liveops  westathome  She can also try Walmart, McDonalds, etc until something better comes along.|`|AA11627889	Well, I personally would despise this, but there's always customer service jobs.

xPWs1FAlaa	Finding a true Friend in this world is near impossible, cause we're all selfish, people think they have good friends, but that can be proven wrong when you really need a Friend. As for love, I don't believe in it, it's just my drunk libido. Think about it logically, it's human nature. A true friend is rare to find, some people say they're in love, they get married, but soon their love starts to fail. (most). Why do we consatntly switch partners, love is supposed to last forever, why doesn't it? Just look at the world, then you'll know what I mean. Love and friendship are both a need that is much to good to be true. Most of us are just delusional. That's my outlook, maybe you think different. Finding a friend is near impossible, love like I said is just my drunk libido. If love is as they say it is, then it's much too simple and good for humans to have. I'm just 16 right now so it feels like love doesn't exsist, but if that one girl walks into my life, then maybe, I'll believe in love, but as far as I see the things go on in the world, the things I feel, I won't believe in love, just sexual desire.

B7TFX4wUaa	Fluctuations due to the solar cycle exist, but the trend is ever upward.  Overall, solar activity is constant.  We can measure the sun directly and have been for decades.  Temperatures are rising, and the sun is not a major factor.    By 1900 the industrial revolution was in full swing.  Even as early as 1850 CO2 levels were starting to rise.      Given how skewed the carbon cycle is due to human activities, the atmospheric CO2 levels should never go down, even with decreased economics activity. There simply aren't enough carbon sinks.      CO2 absorbs in the infrared and can act as a "greenhouse" gas.  We are producing large quantities of it.  The planet is warming.    I suggest you study the underlying science and stop listening to denialists.    Edit: Okay, now I know wherever you are getting this from is incorrect or lying.    The Earth has periodic climate trends called the Milankovitch cycles which are based on the Earth's orbit, axial tilt, ect. They are probably the cause of ice ages and the like.  ~6000 there was a maximum.  We are in the cooling portion of the cycle.    In other words it should be getting colder.  It's not.    The thing is, the CO2 humans produce by ourselves cannot affect the temperature enough to melt ice caps, destroy farmland, ect.  It's just not that much.    The problem is in a positive feedback loop.  What little increase we do causing permafrost to melt (releasing methane, also a green house gas), melts ice (ice reflects sunlight, reducing warming), causes the ocean to release CO2 and methane (think soda can), and lower the pH of the ocean (increase CO2 will, to a point [we are not there yet], be taken up by the ocean.  This produces carbonic acid) which kills cyanobacteria (the major fixers of carbon).    A small change can lead to a big change.  While this process has happened many, many times before naturally, we are making it happen faster, and there are six billion people to feed this time around.    Edit 2: You added two more misleading claims.    Yes, water is technically a greenhouse gas, but it does two things.  It comes out of the atmosphere as rain, and more importantly it collects in clouds.  Clouds reflect light, so an increase in water vapor would act as a negative feedback on global temperatures.    The lag is in a natural cycle.  If one of those cycles I mentioned started to warm the Earth, it would trigger a positive feedback loop.  The loop is the same, the cause is different.|`|jW0VqZcOaa	Why don't you post this rubbish in the Science section?    Oh,... because your just "full of it"??    Okay.|`|aPuUuWlLaa	From the Environmental Protection Agency of the United States report on status of Global Warming and Climate Change.    Are human activities responsible for the warming climate?     Careful measurements have confirmed that greenhouse gas emissions are increasing and that human activities (principally, the burning of fossil fuels and changes in land use) are the primary cause. Human activities have caused the atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide and methane to be higher today than at any point during the last 650,000 years. Scientists agree it is very likely that most of the global average warming since the mid-20th century is due to human-induced increases in greenhouse gases, rather than to natural causes.    Source: IPCC AR4 WG1 FAQs 2007 (PDF)  (128 pp, 10.9MB, About PDF)  Source: IPCC Climate Change 2007: WGI Summary for Policy Makers (PDF)  (18 pp, 2.9MB, About PDF)       Can changes in climate be attributed to natural factors?     Natural variations within the Earths climate system can cause small changes over decades to centuries. Larger changes can occur through factors such as gradual changes in Earths orbit around the Sun, which are thought to be the key contributors in the comings and goings of past ice ages over many millennia. The Suns energy can also vary over time. Large volcanic eruptions and collisions with large meteorites can cool the planet for a few years by spewing out particles that reflect sunlight back out to space. However, while natural variations have altered the climate significantly in the past, it is very unlikely that the changes in climate observed since the mid-20th century can be explained by natural processes alone.

There is broad agreement in the scientific community such that its only a few who deny human contributes, significantly those in the employ of industries that don't want it to be true.

But in the last century there have been temperature averages that far outpace anything in the natural record. When graphed, this produces a sharp upswing, AKA the "hockey stick" graph.    Even the most diehard deniers have accepted that the data is probably real, and the only naysayers left are, curiously, fundies who deny it not because of any particular knowledge, but because they refuse to acknowledge the same evil science that delivered evolution!

He could not have won his bet any sooner than he did. According to three independent systems of measurement, 1990 was the hottest year on record. Nonetheless, most climatologists feel that it is still too early to tell whether the greenhouse effect is responsible for the record temperatures. One year, they say, is not enough to prove anything. Hansen agrees but insists that an underlying trend made his bet a safe one. According to Science magazine, he says that it has become very difficult for the atmosphere to cool down because its being pushed pretty hard by greenhouse gases toward a warmer climate. (Awake-1990)    The 1980s were a hot decade. Perspectives, a magazine published by the International Institute for Environment and Development, reports that six of the seven warmest years over the 140 year period that temperature records were kept have all occurred since 1980. And according to data released by the British Meteorological Office, 1990 was the hottest year on record. This information, claims Perspectives, confirms that the average surface air temperature is rising and provides new evidence that the globe is set on a general warming trend.

Temperatures are cyclical, here and throughout the solar system, all planets at this time are suffering from heat waves.    The Red Storm on Jupiter has increased in size over recent years, that is what happens here in warm weather, stronger storms.    So, saying this, I am not sure that our pollution and "rising" CO2 levels would affect these distant planets.

My feeling is that the earth goes through cycles of warming and cooling.  It knows how to correct itself.  However, it's not really a concern of mine because if it's happening now, it's going to happen regardless of what we do to stop it.  I watched Al Gore's presentation and it did make me a little more aware or what I was wasting.  I still feel like if it happens, it happens.

For example, the Bible says: The living are conscious that they will die; but as for the dead, they are conscious of nothing at all .?.?. Their love and their hate and their jealousy have already perished. The Bible also states: There is no work nor devising nor knowledge nor wisdom in Sheol [the grave], the place to which you are going.Ecclesiastes 9:5, 6,?10.    According to Gods Word, therefore, while people are alive, they are aware of death. When death occurs, however, they are aware of nothing. They do not stand beside their own corpse, observing what is done to it. In nonexistence there is neither pleasure nor pain, neither joy nor sorrow. Those dead are not aware of the passing of time. Theirs is an unconscious state deeper than any sleep.    Job, a servant of God in ancient times, knew that people did not continue to live on after death. He also understood that without Gods intervention, there would be no hope of coming to life again. Job said: An able-bodied man dies and lies vanquished; and an earthling man expires, and where is he? [He] has to lie down and does not get up. (Job 14:10,?12) Job certainly did not expect that when he died he would join his ancestors in a world of spirits.    The Resurrection Hope    Since the living cease to exist at death, the critical question is the one that Job raised when he went on to ask: If an able-bodied man dies can he live again? Job himself gave this answer: All the days of my compulsory service [time in the grave] I shall wait, until my relief comes. You [Jehovah] will call, and I myself shall answer you. For the work of your hands you will have a yearning.Job 14:14,?15.    In other words, although Job would pass into nonexistence, God would not forget him. Job had faith that the time would come when Jehovah God would call him back to life by means of a resurrection.|`|f5FmJRfIaa	Read the obituaries every morning when you wake up.

Be careful when you do this. Do not stop until the full fart has been expelled. Walk an extra 30 feet to make sure the smell has left your pants.    FLY BY    The act of scouting out a bathroom before pooping.  Walk in and check for other poopers. If there are others in the bathroom, leave and come  back again. Be careful not to become a FREQUENT FLYER.  People may become suspicious if they catch you constantly going into the bathroom.    ESCAPEE    A fart that slips out while taking a leak at the urinal or forcing a poop  in a stall. This is usually accompanied by a sudden wave of embarrassment.  If you release an escapee, do not acknowledge it. Pretend it did not happen.  If you are standing next to the farter in the urinal, pretend you did not hear it.  No one likes an escapee. It is uncomfortable for all involved. Making a joke or  laughing makes both parties feel uneasy.    JAILBREAK    When forcing a poop, several farts slip out at a machine gun pace.  This is usually a side effect of diarrhea or a hangover. If this should  happen, do not panic. Remain in the stall until everyone has left the bathroom to  spare everyone the awkwardness of what just occurred.    COURTESY FLUSH    The act of flushing the toilet the instant the poop hits the water.  This reduces the amount of air time the poop has to stink up the bathroom.  This can help you avoid being caught doing the WALK OF SHAME.    WALK OF SHAME    Walking from the stall, to the sink, to the door after you have just  stunk up the bathroom. This can be a very uncomfortable moment if someone  walks in and busts you. As with farts, it is best to pretend that the smell  does not exist. Can be avoided with the use of the COURTESY FLUSH.    THE POOPING FRIENDS NETWORK (P.F.N)    A group of co-workers who band together to ensure emergency pooping  goes off without incident. This group can help you to monitor the where  abouts of Out Of The Closet Poopers, and identify SAFE HAVENS.    SAFE HAVENS    A seldom used bathroom somewhere in the building where you can least  expect visitors. Try floors that are predominantly of the opposite sex.  This will reduce the odds of a pooper of your sex entering the bathroom.    TURD BURGLAR    Someone who does not realize that you are in the stall and tries to  force the door open. This is one of the most shocking and vulnerable moments  that can occur when taking a poop at work. If this occurs, remain in the stall  until the Turd Burglar leaves. This way you will avoid all uncomfortable eye contact.    CAMO-COUGH    A phony cough that alerts all new entrants into the bathroom that you  are in a stall. This can be used to cover-up a WATERMELON, or to alert  potential Turd Burglars. Very effective when used in conjunction with an  ASTAIRE.    ASTAIRE    A subtle toe-tap that is used to alert potential Turd Burglars that  you are occupying a stall. This will remove all doubt that the stall is  occupied. If you hear an Astaire, leave the bathroom immediately so the pooper can poop in peace.    WATERMELON    A poop that creates a loud splash when hitting the toilet water. This is also an embarrassing incident. If you feel a Watermelon coming on, create a diversion. See CAMO-COUGH.    HAVANA OMELET    A case of diarrhea that creates a series of loud splashes in the toilet water. Often accompanied by an Escapee. Try using a Camo-Cough with an ASTAIRE.    UNCLE TED    A bathroom user who seems to linger around forever. Could spend extended lengths of time in front of the mirror or sitting on the pot. An Uncle Ted makes it difficult to relax while on the toilet, as you should always wait to poop when the bathroom is empty. This benefits you as well as the other bathroom attendees.|`|ivwylzZEaa	find answers|`|53sVKcOeaa	Bored'm sleep lol|`|Q5KFND17aa	both.

RZJLLxnUaa	http://www.spellsandmagic.com/omens.html|`|f7l9byFGaa	It was a omen of disaster to have a black cat enter the house, have a snake fall from the roof into the yard, or for a beam of the house to split. To spill wine, oil or even water could also be the sign that bad things were about to happen.  Another strange superstition was that one could stop oneself from having unpleasant thoughts by moistening a finger with saliva and rubbing it across the skin behind the ear.     If a rooster would crow during a party, either the correct magic spell to overcome the bad omen needed to be cast or nothing was eaten that day.  To stumble over the doorstep when leaving one's house was considered a bad omen. Many would choose to read this as a sign and hence spend the day at home. Never should one mention fire at a banquet. Although if it was done, one could remedy it by pouring water on the table.     Check out this site regarding animals  http://www.psychicworld.net/Supet.htm

Every individual can get married. No one is being denied the right to marry.    Are there actually ppl following me thumbing me down lol wow    Right religious freedom so if Gays want to create a new religion and think of another name for marriage thats totally legal. But you cant change someone else just to benefit yourself    Thats the thing tho they arent.  Everyone has equal rights to get married. If you ask the courts  "Can I get married" they will say yes. Every individual person can get married. Thats a right.    I do get it they can get married. Like I said every INDIVIDUAL can get married. Yes you can get married too|`|ga8Wc16Waa	No. Just biased religious propaganda.|`|FHLKpNv4aa	some one went on a thumbs down spree.    no their isn't one.|`|WFYtrtRmaa	uhm    hell no!|`|iLTlJszaaa	There are several reasons, and religion isn't the only one.  The government has absolutely no right to redefine marriage.    Leviticus 18:22-23:  "You shall not lie with a male as one lies with a female; it is an abomination.  Also you shall not have intercourse with any animal to be defiled with it, nor shall any woman stand before an animal to mate with it; it is a perversion."     We believe that the family is the bedrock and backbone of our society. Therefore, the fundmental institution which creates the family, marriage, should be protected.     Further, we recognize that marriage as an institution serves a larger purpose than a demonstration of love and commitment between two adults.     We recognize that the State has an interest in protecting the institution of marriage because it is vital to protecting the institution of the family and the family is the bedrock of our society.    We acknowledge that marriage, while a demonstration of love and commitment, also serves for the betterment, growth and continuation of our society because married couples will produce the next generation of Americans.     While not every married couple will produce offspring, no homosexual couple has the physical capacity to do so. This leads us to conclude that a homosexual marriage does nothing for the betterment, growth or continuation of society.    Marriage is in fact a legal contract between not only two parties, the bride and groom, but also the State. The State is a party in a marriage contract because it is the State which sanctions such marriage.    Homosexual marriage does not provide for the next generation of Americans and thus the continuation of our nation. Therefore there is no purpose for the State to sanction such union.     People should start putting the interests of the nation before their own personal agenda. Traditional marriage, generally speaking, provides our nation with the next generation of doctors and teachers and soldiers and scientists. Marriage in this regard is a service to society.     Homosexual marriage serves only the personal agenda of the two homosexual entities which plan to marry. Such homosexual union will not produce offspring. Such union would only clear the streets of rainbow flag parades pleading for "equal marriage rights" It is therefore a selfish act.     We recognize, lastly, that homosexuals already have equal marriage rights. Any homosexual man or woman can obtain a state license to marry by following the exact same process everyone else must. There are no questions of sexual orientation on the application for a marriage license.     Due to this as well as other reasons deeply believed by our members, we oppose the legalization of same-sex marriages.
7c73d357ee89c177275de5c2d1c35fd2aa	You can pick up the basics to ASL with a good teacher in about 100 hours.  That'll be the alphabet and about 300-400 hundred common words.    However, usually when a song is signed it is more conceptual than it is accurate.  Movement may be combined with strings of signs which would be technically inaccurate sign language, though the meaning is usually clear enough.|`|i48kxrbaaa	No, it's easier than learning another spoken language.    If you buy a book, and dedicate yourself to reading and studing for about two weeks, you'll get the hook of it.|`|VaYUNWCyaa	I studied ASL for 5 years. I started in an interpreters program at a local college and then took some private lessons with a friend.  I am terrible at accents so this was a match for me. Not hard to learn but like anything else, you will need someone to practice with. People always watch me when I am signing to a song in the car. There is also signed english.  Did you know that signs differ in different parts of this country and also that in England they have different signs as well as for Spanish speaking countries.     You can always email me if you want to talk about this further.|`|d4HWHrxaaa	NO JUST TRY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...|`|5I01tsgYaa	If you're just planning to learn this one song and not actually become fluent in the language, then it shouldn't be too hard.    You may want to try to find a site that shows a video of how each sign should look.  The meaning of the sign can change drastically depending on the emphasis and where your hands are in relation to your body.  I had a friend who was trying to offer a deaf man an ice cream cone and inadvertently offered to perform a sex act on him instead....|`|K5sZfqW2aa	I COMPLETELY disagree with what Michelle said.  It is NOT easier than learning a spoken language.  Just because it uses English based word system does not make it the same as learning a few hand signs.  It has a completely different syntax and grammatical order.  There are mouth morphemes that change the meaning of the signs, facial grammar, use of space and classifiers.    Learning a few signs is no big deal.  Being able to communicate in ASL is a completely different deal.  I have been studying to become an interpreter for the past several years and I am still nowhere near ready.

cDn9bhcGaa	Tough call...    * Silver vs. Sunlight to kill it - Werewolf wins.  It's a lot easier to rip the lid off a coffin during the day than it is to shoot/stab something that can move as fast as a wolf.  And a vampire can (sometimes) be repelled by Garlic or a Crucifix.    * Strength and Abilities - Vampires win by a long shot (regardless of which mythology you follow).  Turning into mist, a bat, invisible, flight, mental domination - all of these top mere shape-shifting.    * Ability to go undetected - Tie.  The werewolf wins in it's "human" form - but most varieties of Vampire (with the possible exception of the Nosferatu-style "monster" vampire) look more human than a werewolf in beast form.    * Head-to-Head battle (against each other) - Tie.  Just like Freddy Vs. Jason - two Immortals going at it would NEVER be able to kill each other!    * Fighting Style - Tie (subjective).  The werewolf prefers to rush in aggressively, mauling their victim as quickly as possible.  On the other hand, a vampire prefers a more stealthy or seductive route.    -------------    Using this last point as a tie-breaker, I would PERSONALLY give the slight edge to the Vampire - but I still wouldn't want to be anywhere near a charging Werewolf ;););)|`|0s190C7Zaa	I would say Werewolf over a vampire any time.|`|FKqR3dwBaa	I would be the guy th a silver bullet filled magnum and the bullets would resemble stakes|`|ff545BLyaa	Man conquers all that is why we rule this earth!

UNless its the kind where you cant control yourself when you turn into one.  But either way vampires are just not as cool as werewolves.|`|XBHR1Wquaa	i think the vampire would win because a vampire is immortal, unless killed by the ways we all know. A werewolf is only strong when there's a full moon, and i reckon the human inside has no control over it. doesn't mean that a werewolf couldn't kill a vampire, i just think that the vampire is higher up the foodchain|`|4YqVNiJzaa	i want to be mlang but im stuck i as what am.....................stupid vampires|`|0IKdojzeaa	Why should our answers be based only on Twilight? I can tell you right now they are nowhere near correct. I'm okay with them, but i don't take them as fact. Besides, a lot of you tend to base your opinion on things like silver bullets etc. Things like Underworld or Twilight are just creative license. Believe me when I say I know. And I'm not sure who would win, I'd gladly accept the challenge if I had to. No offense to any who like vampires, but I'm sure a wolf could meet the challenge (by the way, a wolf is different than a werewolf, don't get them mixed up). So come on, let's see how one would fair against a six foot tall 200 pound wolf. I'm always eager to play.

If you will offer support and comfort to queer people, I think that sufficiently addresses anything ugly you may have done in the past.|`|05169fce29c48355e7c8ffeffb87e97daa	Why ask people who don't know you if they hold your past against you.

Trust me I've had my opinions thumbed down plenty of times. None threatening non aggressive ones, someone even said the N word to me to supposedly prove some point.

You will find that the older people are now, the more likely they are to be racist. Plus all those people who don't like people for any reason they can find, like because they are ginger, or have spots...    Some people just judge by appearances and if they don't like them then they can get nasty.    I dont really understand it though. I think dark skin looks attractive, but i am pretty pale myself.|`|th9iHEL7aa	Wow I am not racist but I am ethnocentric meaning I know and judge others based on my knowledge of the culture I grew up with.  Every culture is ethnocentric.  Being exposed to other cultures and ethnic groups is not something everyone gets to experience in life.  Usually the poorest people in the world will never let go of their racist views because there is no way for them to get out of the poor house.  Most racists probably don't interact with diverse ethnic groups until it is too late in life.  Notice I used the word 'too' in order to indicate the gravity of 'late'.  Instead of using the word 'to'.    The word is spelt attitude.      Stereo types are used by humans in order to recall the most important information from a given situation.  Stereo types will never go away.  They are a tool we all use to survive.

yHllNUrPaa	To cut drugs you usually have to go to the doctors and they give you replacements that are not harmful, it can take years but obviously it is worth it because of the health issues and where it is illegal.    I would say people generally tend to do things that they know they shouldn't. Like if you saw a sign saying do not look in that window, most people would have an urge to look. Just out of curiousity and wanting to try stuff. But many people take drugs because they think it will help their coping skills, but really it just makes them vunerable and makes them really unhealthy.

6aIuZZi7aa	Baphomet is not a Wiccan deity itself, but it can be used as a representation of The Horned God in Wicca. This is the same as how Baphomet is represented as Satan in Satanism; it is not a Satanic image itself, but it can be used as one. I would think that Baphomet is an image that can be used by any religion, group or individual person. I use Baphomet personally, but I have no problem with Wiccans, Thelemites or any other religion, group or individual person that chooses to use Baphomet.|`|AA10076207	baphomet is considered a wiccan deity(The Great Horned God,or at least a representation of Him). we're to search out the pantheon we feel the most resence with.and follow it.|`|fQkb26jWaa	He probably follows Aleister Crowley's Thelema.|`|mFy3M8mVaa	Interesting.

Many Wiccans follow deities borrowed from other cultures (such as Aphrodite).    There's nothing in Wicca that says you can't follow Baphomet as your god.  Usually people called to the idea of Baphomet really just don't find Wicca suitable for their beliefs.    The name Baphomet first entered the historical record when the Christian Templars were accused of worshipping him.  It's probably a corruption of Mahomet, which is a variation of Mohammad, although he was described in very Satanic terms.  Baphomet pops up again in the 19th century in occult writings, sometimes equated with Satan, sometimes not.    Here's some quick info on the occult Baphomet:  http://altreligion.about.com/od/symbols/...

Look at the majority of the developing countries and the majority of the countries that are doing well. Overwhelmingly the countries with a huge light skinned population are more financially secure than the dark skinned nations/continent. White and fair skinned is the look of refinement and luxury.|`|OTnSwNwZaa	1) Many cultures, especially east asian ones, have always viewed lighter as better.    2) Whites have the power in the world.    3) Whites control the majority of the media and spread the notion that whiter is better.|`|c9b39ba1619a86eb939cf1b78c3d4a15aa	lighter is better is a white perception that has been promoted by white people.|`|jzG8QcWQaa	Light is always Right! in the eyes of some ppl.....but that's just something we'll have to overcome in time....|`|pfke6Jieaa	u know what man i was thinking the exact same thing. i actually also served the navy special operations team before and we never looked at race. tv is very biased to making white the best features. and the closer you are too it the better looking you are, hence why u see more light skinned actors than dark skinned. if ppl take the time to see the beauty in every person they will see that light is not better than dark. there can good looking and bad looking from both sides so it cancels out. but its the perception from europe and america (white ppl) that sink this into ppl's brain. my brother is dark skinned and he has no problems finding girls, most of them are dark skinned too. a lot of time i think dark skinned girls in my area tend to prefer dark skinned guys. same with light skinned.    in general, dark skinned ppl have this insecurity being ugly and if they marry a white person or become lighter themselves then they will be beautiful and so will their kids. its pathetic if u ask me. beautiful men and women come in all shades, not just white. and white is NOT the standard of perfect beauty. if that was the case then god wouldnt create diversity am i right?|`|uC2Whritaa	Lighter has historically been seen as better because darker people were associated with being poor and working the fields. It applied to both western and eastern countries. It had NOTHING to do with black people then because we never even knew about blacks. For sure Asians never knew about whites or blacks, but they still had this concept.    Now being black is associated as being bad, not necessarily because white color is prettier or better than black inherently, but that the black race taken as a WHOLE has shown us nothing but disgrace. Both from their motherland to where ever foreign country they decide to plant roots in. Just look how many ghettos they have all over the world. Poverty and violence follow blacks like the plague. So no it's not the black color but the people of the black race that's to put it mildly, such losers over all. So if this is all we see, I think over time, people want to disassociate themselves from being black or dark.   If today Africa was a top nation, and most all blacks were as smart or hardworking as the Chinese, we would never view blacks the way many of us currently do. Does that make any sense?|`|XQRwQkQoaa	I was reading something about Beyonce having dark-skinned african american women in her videos dancing next to her to make her appear lighter to the viewing audience....so she would seem more marketable.

Immersed early in the mystic rites of the city and in the worship of the Mother and Earth goddess Demeter, he was once sent as a child to watch grapes ripening in the countryside. According to Aeschylus, when he dozed off, Dionysus appeared to him in a dream and ordered him to write tragedies.

Be careful when you do this. Do not stop until the full fart has been expelled. Walk an extra 30 feet to make sure the smell has left your pants.    FLY BY    The act of scouting out a bathroom before pooping.  Walk in and check for other poopers. If there are others in the bathroom, leave and come  back again. Be careful not to become a FREQUENT FLYER.  People may become suspicious if they catch you constantly going into the bathroom.    ESCAPEE    A fart that slips out while taking a leak at the urinal or forcing a poop  in a stall. This is usually accompanied by a sudden wave of embarrassment.  If you release an escapee, do not acknowledge it. Pretend it did not happen.  If you are standing next to the farter in the urinal, pretend you did not hear it.  No one likes an escapee. It is uncomfortable for all involved. Making a joke or  laughing makes both parties feel uneasy.    JAILBREAK    When forcing a poop, several farts slip out at a machine gun pace.  This is usually a side effect of diarrhea or a hangover. If this should  happen, do not panic. Remain in the stall until everyone has left the bathroom to  spare everyone the awkwardness of what just occurred.    COURTESY FLUSH    The act of flushing the toilet the instant the poop hits the water.  This reduces the amount of air time the poop has to stink up the bathroom.  This can help you avoid being caught doing the WALK OF SHAME.    WALK OF SHAME    Walking from the stall, to the sink, to the door after you have just  stunk up the bathroom. This can be a very uncomfortable moment if someone  walks in and busts you. As with farts, it is best to pretend that the smell  does not exist. Can be avoided with the use of the COURTESY FLUSH.    THE POOPING FRIENDS NETWORK (P.F.N)    A group of co-workers who band together to ensure emergency pooping  goes off without incident. This group can help you to monitor the where  abouts of Out Of The Closet Poopers, and identify SAFE HAVENS.    SAFE HAVENS    A seldom used bathroom somewhere in the building where you can least  expect visitors. Try floors that are predominantly of the opposite sex.  This will reduce the odds of a pooper of your sex entering the bathroom.    TURD BURGLAR    Someone who does not realize that you are in the stall and tries to  force the door open. This is one of the most shocking and vulnerable moments  that can occur when taking a poop at work. If this occurs, remain in the stall  until the Turd Burglar leaves. This way you will avoid all uncomfortable eye contact.    CAMO-COUGH    A phony cough that alerts all new entrants into the bathroom that you  are in a stall. This can be used to cover-up a WATERMELON, or to alert  potential Turd Burglars. Very effective when used in conjunction with an  ASTAIRE.    ASTAIRE    A subtle toe-tap that is used to alert potential Turd Burglars that  you are occupying a stall. This will remove all doubt that the stall is  occupied. If you hear an Astaire, leave the bathroom immediately so the pooper can poop in peace.    WATERMELON    A poop that creates a loud splash when hitting the toilet water. This is also an embarrassing incident. If you feel a Watermelon coming on, create a diversion. See CAMO-COUGH.    HAVANA OMELET    A case of diarrhea that creates a series of loud splashes in the toilet water. Often accompanied by an Escapee. Try using a Camo-Cough with an ASTAIRE.    UNCLE TED    A bathroom user who seems to linger around forever. Could spend extended lengths of time in front of the mirror or sitting on the pot. An Uncle Ted makes it difficult to relax while on the crapper, as you should always wait to poop when the bathroom is empty. This benefits you as well as the other bathroom attendees.|`|Lc8hkjHPaa	The Christians didn't invent, and don't own the morality. That comes naturally to sentient beings.

Morality putting what God said into practice. Develop the same conduct as the Lord Jesus.    Having a concern for what God has a concern for his creation. Man.    To lose the chains of injustice.    to untie the yoke     to set the oppressed free    share your food with the hungry    provide shelter for the wanderer that is poor.    to cloth the naked    do not turn away from your own flesh and blood.

It is only the body or the matter aspect that is shed.|`|8oi3gCZoaa	I too have a problem with the basic premise of your question.      That aside, however, there is no way to answer any such questions until you know what happens to a person at the time of death and after death.  No one has died and come back to tell us (and, even if someone did, we wouldn't know whether his or her report was accurate, objective, or complete).      (Okay, not to include Jesus Christ, who is said to have been a magical being, not a "regular" mortal human.  There are myriad variables of any such report because everything about it is filtered through the reality and sensibility of that specific person.  A musician might tell you one thing, a welder another, and a mystery writer something else altogether.  A Buddhist or a Jew; an Italian or an Ethiopian; a short man or a tall woman; et cetera.  We are not all truly alike in that we see reality differently.  But I digress.)    We know only that the physical body ceases to function and, like all carbon-based life, decays.  If left in its natural state in a natural environment, it would eventually return to the earth.    As for a person's energy or her "spirit," we don't know exactly what the life force is;  whether a spirit exists; whether a spirit or soul would actually have mass, i.e. matter (some people believe it does);  whether the personality ceases to exist; exactly what becomes of the electrical impulses inside the human body; or... a million things about death.      In the meantime, my condolences on your loss.  I'm sure you take comfort in your memories of your cousin; focusing on the happy times can help ease your grief.|`|GcOWoAmSaa	No. Everything that lives gets energy from other things that were alive. The plants and animals we eat died and gave us their energy. When people die, our energy is given to other things.  It is God's form of recycling

This person must have been clinically dead up until the point where the BRAIN was completely gone. Then if the person somehow came back to life, against all scientific possibilities, with a unique description (not just O tunnel white light), then I would take his experience into account. But at the end of the day, if one person thinks they experience something that does not make it the truth. When I was 9 I swore I saw a cowboy on a blue horse walk by my room.

Now I now I was just a scared little boy who couldnt sleep and my imagination got the best of me|`|7c0eb610d871f4900af356753fbd90b4aa	yes  but that is not what they tell me|`|cOLbrnLTaa	well i am a christian but hearing it from a person that died will make my faith stronger. im sure some people would convinced|`|4UaHYaDcaa	If they could back up their claims.  I imagine that during their time being dead their brain would have deteriorated, so they couldn't be that credible, possibly not even coherent.|`|wR1XyyrUaa	And what if he said that your religions beliefs were wrong, would you give them up?|`|CCf6Y7DIaa	probably not, though i'd find it highly curious. we all experience a major dmt trip right as we are born and right before we die (the common, 'white light that contains everything'); anything the guy experienced could have been because of the trip.    usually the trip conveys some meaning about humanity. it'd be interesting if it said something solely and specifically about death and the afterlife.    :/    EDIT: dmt is a substance that exists in all living things and is highly regulated by the brain; if the proper amount is taken into the body, one will experience a powerful visual and auditory hallucination, lasting only up to 5 minutes in 'real time,' while being physically paralyzed (albeit still being able to breathe, as long as one's airway is not restricted --it's better to do this while sitting than while laying down). take any more or any less than necessary and you will simply get auditory hallucinations, if that. dmt is not an illegal substance, but is a major trip (albeit by nature it doesn't cause one to ever go 'insane' like lsd); take it with trustworthy friends around.|`|5dd8eBDYaa	Hypothetical question about an event that has yet to occur in human history...    Thanks anyway, try again later.|`|1TYZDRUqaa	Sure.  IJR is just waiting for someone who has been dead for three or four years or longer to come and tell me all about the good things you get in Heaven.|`|mU2eMSi3aa	I've returned from the dead and so no, I would believe my experience over anyone elses.  You never know what anyone's agenda might be.  I personally believe in God but I think heaven and hell are man made things.  Notice that even though it might seem that I have proof positive having come back from the dead myself I do not say it is fact.  Everyone has to find out truth for themselves and no one should take someone elses word for it, even if they came back from the dead or claim to be the son of God.|`|d529cebfe13576f3ddee3e55b4cd08ffaa	It's such a "what if" question that there is no *real* answer.    Like asking if dragons showed up at your door and told you they have treasure, would you believe them?|`|TYQOafA8aa	sure|`|434cdba191b138eb36e563b9ef737a76aa	No one has come back from the dead and no one will.|`|AA11264399	No-one comes back from being dead.  Dead means, by definition, that life is over, permanently, forever.

If it is from another source, it is an an illusion.|`|rdoPeWnzaa	There is no such thing as black magic, or someone cursing you. Jinns can't do anything to you. Maybe it's to test your faith. Just pray, and read the quaran. I hope you feel better.|`|frxEgBaxaa	I'd give a tarot reader a call, they should be able to detect whether you have been cursed or not.  You can then use a cleasing ritual or cas a white light spell to protect yourself in the future.|`|6Df48ywcaa	You have absolutely nothing to worry about, because curses, jinns, etc. are NOT real.  There is a purely physical explanation for your cancer - because what happened to you is statistically unlikely doesn't make it supernatural.|`|faNLFzwmaa	Karma maybe, but I must say, WOW! Your story is so scary.|`|ccccc3a7fff67561896e1cd6e04c515faa	Put a piece of real silver in your mouth, under your tongue. If it turns black, you're cursed; if not, you're fine.|`|QRG2L5Qjaa	freaky. But uh, you ever watch supernatural or stuff? You'd probably need to find something through religious writings or something relating to satan and curses. Or shes just a gypsie and ur dead. that is freaky though. i just dont believe in it and its all ok

nFBwt5Cfaa	even though i do live in south carolina, i get things that are like "South Carolina is so beautiful" and " I love Oconee County" and many things like that. It is amazing. I love the small towns. Theres just one thing wronge with it is that news travels fast. But its amazing. Great shopping. Great camping areas. Friendly people. A lot of great food. everything is just simply amazing. But i couldnt tell you anything about north carolina but that it is just really cold during the winter and it snows more than it does in south carolina.   i hope i helped.

I think you should tell him how you feel about him. I think things will work out!|`|30b5fac62378b9be69757aa6b696edf4aa	Well, I am not a guy but in my experience...straight guys (friends or not) don't typically kiss each other, even if it is only on the cheek.  I may be wrong but it sounds to me as if there is something there.  Don't push too hard, but I think it is definitely worth exploring : )

TDLdVmqEaa	Hm, isn't it if they are move in love with the outside, its called lust, and if its the inside, its love. I know it works different ways but that's what I heard.  I mean, lets just say you weren't asian, would this guy still like you?  It shouldn't matter what ethnicity you are, you know, love is love but it seems this guy's fetish is more lust than actual love, and it seems he's trying to cover that up by making you think sex isn't all he wants.    Simple thing is, Fetishes are a thing of lust, not love.|`|NvQMQv8Daa	Your racists and highly innacurate.  Loving asian people IS NOT A FETISH.

It could be useful though.|`|sZoYD6Hfaa	i think most of it is in your head, and now you notice it more because you're paying too much attention.  le i-pod think, sometimes happens to me too, i think the ipod sometimes (even thought it's on shuffle) it shoufles them the same way as a previous time (sometimes) and you have the song somewhat pre-thought on your head.  when your mom asked you if you wanted something, sometimes your body language can express that b4 you even have to say it...(especially w/moms they have an extra instinct or something...lol)  the rest about coincideing with your friends...it definitelly seems like a coincidence, but enjoy it....that only happens with very few friends and it usually means you're kinda in sync with each other.|`|ZXOAh6VHaa	Your a Witch .

You may have some sort of pyschic ability, but nothing in what you said relates to that very much. Uhmm. The possibility that your sister was going to watch the same movie isn't anything weird, she probably saw it and thought "huh, haven't seen this in awhile. Let's watch!".    And mom's tend to ignore children when they're busy, happens to me all the time lol. You know that feeling when you think your listening and you're really not? That was probably it.  So all in all, I don't think something is going on with you, but if these things persist, email me :]

Buy a necklace chain (cheap) and a simple, charm (masculine-ish) like a thunderbolt or something and make him a necklace.    You could always make a small scrapbook for him with photos of you and him, pictures of love hearts, handwritten memories, inside jokes, romantic lyrics or quotes etc.    Buy a cheap photo frame and decorate it with love hearts etc. and pop in a cute photo of the two of you.

I am not being "judgmental".  Fact: there is no Christian body in the world that regards Mormonism as orthodox.  Mormons say they are Christians.  They're not, it really is that simple.  Look at their belief system.  Look at their re-writing of Old Testament and American history.  Study any impartial account of Joseph Smith's and Brigham Young's life stories.  If this is Christianity, I really AM King of the Woad, and I go to work in my blue war paint every day.    Being "judgmental" might entail saying that Mormons are male chauvinists with a secret agenda that threatens to undermine civilized society.  I might believe one of those things; I don't believe the other one and I haven't put my name to either of them.  All I am doing in saying that Mormons aren't Christians is trying to use the language correctly.  Muslims aren't Christians either.  It doesn't mean I am condemning them.|`|p18BmlIxaa	Why are some Mormons so judgmental of the FLDS and others?    For example, the constant thing I always hear from some Mormons is that the FLDS aren't Mormon.    They happen to believe: 1) Joseph Smith was a prophet who translated the Book of Mormon and restored Jesus's "true church".  2) That polygamy is the true order of families, as Joseph originally taught. 3) NO mortal has the RIGHT to judge that relationship.    All FLDS claim they are Mormon, and most act like it, too.  Where do some of these judgmental Mormons think they get and have the right to judge the FLDS?|`|7422ddf097669bd7b6e3d48e56258b87aa	Sorry.    The Jesus Christ Mormons claim to know cannot be the Jesus Christ of the Bible and of authentic Christianity.     For the same reason, Mormon scriptures cannot be authentic scripture.

It is one thing to disagree about doctrine.  Doing such a thing can be done quite easily with love and Charity.  But what so many Christians do is so much more than simply express disagreement.  When, for example, CJ says "Catholicism is from hell", like he enjoys doing so much in every single question about Catholics, he is going above and beyond expressing disagreement and diving deep into the realm of hatred.    Why do people do this?  I think it is because people create a dichotomy in their mind.  They see a belief as wrong and they thing "I can either be nice, OR I can speak the truth", and so they say things like "Mormonism isn't Christian".  Of course, the problem with that is that it's a false dichotomy.  You can speak the truth or you can speak lies.  You can speak in kindness or you can speak in hatred.  It is quite easy to speak truth in kindness or speak lies in hatred, and people fail to understand this, so they speak what they believe to be truth, but do so in hatred.    So really, I don't think that most of them are intentionally judging(Westboro Baptist Church not withstanding), but they're not getting their point across in a very Christian way.|`|Io9288c7aa	Even by the way you have stated your Question, you imply that even you accept that there is a big difference between Christians and Mormons and yet you still think that we should accept you as the same as Us.      Mormons are not the same as true Bible believing Christians. And that is why true believers in Christ as the son of God, God Himself, and the Holy Spirit (i.e. the Trinity) try to both correct and draw the distinction between the two beliefs.       On a similar vein, true Christians believe the Bible is the whole word of God and should not be altered or added to.     Mormons on the other hand, have an extra book, in contradiction to    even what the Bible says.( Deuteronomy 4: 2 & Revelations 22:18.)|`|td56KmCBaa	Excellent question. I was raised a Christian, a Baptist, and the one thing that irritates me more than anything is judging people of other beliefs and saying that someone is wrong just because they believe differently. It says in the Bible that we are not to judge one another, that is God's divine right. There are many that claim to be Christians that act otherwise. It is my firm belief that everyone needs something to believe in, because it is part of what defines us. I don't care what it is, Christians of any denomination, Buddhists, Wiccans whatever. But I have been exposed to those that believe that they are always right and there is no reasoning with them. So, sometimes it's not that people believe they have the right to judge, it's just that they are very firm in believing you are wrong. Believing something whole heartedly is to believe that you are right. It's just the way it is. So there will always be arguments about religion and there will always be intolerance. It's sad, yes, but it will always be that way.  Many believe that Mormons are not Christian per se because there are some major, key differences. One is the Book of Mormon, because most would say that it is against the Bible to have another 'scripture'.  Another is the belief that you are destined to be a god yourself one day and rule your own world. It seems to contradict quite strongly the Bible, when God says 'I knew no God before me'. He is the Alpha and Omega, beginning and end.  Now, I don't believe it is ever right to belittle someone's beliefs, but I do understand where those that do come from. They just go about it in the wrong way. I have several close LDS friends and I don't think there's a thing wrong with them.|`|EAix5Av9aa	If someone has thoughts does that mean they cast an opinion.?  Do people ask what others think of their denomination.    I really do not understand Mormonism as it relates to the  Bible .   What does the bible have to do with Book Of Mormon/?   I know some Mormons that strive with a good Christ ;lke attitude.   I ask little about the Moroni stuff since that is like asking about add ons that I do not accept.      Plenty of American's believe and apply their bible to their faith.    Those that are sikhs too havetheior own doctrines that exclude JESUS Christ. Many of you know the difference of faith and denominational differences as we ask to find out.            pentecostaslls.Catholics, Methodists and a host of others have differing views. Jesus Christ is a large part of their ongoings.     Mormons that are in Christ can judge their doctrines better than I since I choose not top follow Mormonism.  I know most of the faiths yet Mormons I know little about. Some have similar names as the founders like Joseph Smith coincidentally.    Largely religious groups are used by those taking advantage of their ministries and those of other christains/   My insurance agent name is Joseph Smith for State Farm.    I do not know if He is a Mormon.|`|97f3e02ea0c61fb5033e4520729f2781aa	Ultimately, it is their rebellion against the authority claimed by the LDS Church - which, if true, demotes their churches to clubs - so they seek fault and hold on to the traditions of their fathers [or the traditions of the teachings of generations of man] and hold these things in greater esteem than the simple truth discovered by a humble farm boy in the spring of 1820.|`|wU0c3i7baa	I'm pretty sure that you'll find people who are wary of Mormonism across all kinds of different faiths. I'm just telling you the honest truth based on what I hear. Many people consider Mormon practices strange, secretive and cult-like. I would compare it to the public image that Scientologists have, but not quite as bad.    Part of the bad PR comes from the fact that the Church of LDS has been known to be intolerant in the past (i.e. not allowing black people to convert until the 1970's). It doesn't help when fundamentalist polygamists pop up either.     Religions are never accepted by the general population when they're new. When Protestants broke from the Catholic Church, they were persecuted even though they were adherents of Christ. The same can be said of Jehovah's Witnesses.     In the scheme of things, a 200 year old religion like Mormonism is extremely young when you think about the fact that Judaism is 4,000 years old.    New religions threaten those who practice older ones. Also, the Book of Mormon basically says that mainstream Christians have misinterpreted G-d's will and have lost touch with Him. Observant Christians probably don't like being accused of this and feel denigrated as a result.     I'm Jewish, so I consider anyone who believes Jesus was the son of G-d, G-d, or the Messiah to be a Christian, including so-called "Jews for Jesus." To say Mormons aren't Christian is completely illogical. Jews, Muslims, Hindus, Buddhists are not Christian. Mormons are.

de947568c9e8173e12d8a9930bab48abaa	This is the same thing I keep hearing over and over again and have experienced myself every single time I have ever had a female boss/supervisor/mgr, women in the workplace are just b*tchy and very territorial, just like feral cats which they strongly resemble personality wise. She is more than likely trying to submarine you by giving you totally conflicting orders, so your best bet is to immediately register at several employment agencies post your resume on monster and check your local job listings because she will never be a decent human being and will continue to victimize you every chance she gets.|`|OzgLRw9Daa	I think it's very common to not get trained properly,I mean I would call costumer service for a company and have to call back many times,well lets just say people pc,and every time a costumer service rep would have a different solution,so I wonder sometimes if they had any training at all??But like you said you can't be rude to your manager so ask another worker what to do,or the proper way to do it,I think I would ask alot,people in general are getting so rude with others and getting away with it to,just don't get frustrated take a deep breath and say I forgot what you told me how to do what ever,could you please tell me again so I can do a better job for you,and that might just make your manager feel good about themselves ha ha,but kiss butt,eventually you will get the hang of everything,don't worry yourself sick,no job is worth that .good luck|`|DUWwcfSIaa	Unless the pay is substantial, i would recommend finding a new job, one that you enjoy with good management|`|AA11946005	No need to argue, just ask her if she has time for a sit down to answer some questions, since you want to clarify some procedures.

AA11648578	Isa. 7:    13 And he said, Hear ye now, O house of David; Is it a small thing for you to weary men, but will ye weary my God also?     14 Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign; Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel.    In the House of David ..Joseph was the seed of David Jesus was born to the house of David and also related to David through Mary.  In order for  a virgin to give birth it is understood that he would not be born with an earthly Father.|`|WpA7n8Iwaa	Selah's link is great.  Here's the short version though - Both Joseph and Mary are in the line of David.  There's an interesting phrase in one of the gospels that Jesus is of the house and lineage of David.  That sounds like the same thing but isn't.  Through Joseph (house) Jesus gets his rights to one day sit on the throne of David and rule the earth.  (Isaiah 9:6 and other places).   Through Mary He is related to David.  The geneaology in Matthew is different from the one in Luke for this reason - they split right after Solomon.     What makes this more interesting is that because of Jeconiah's actions, he was told that nobody of his line could sit on the throne, so the lineage had to come through Mary:    Jer 22:30 Thus saith the LORD, Write ye this man (Jeconiah) childless, a man [that] shall not prosper in his days: for no man of his seed shall prosper, sitting upon the throne of David, and ruling any more in Judah.|`|eAMq1iBWaa	Here ya go!    in detail!       http://ldolphin.org/2adams.html|`|3ba0ab7304ca31210254987d14dbe035aa	That is correct.|`|k7FD3rt5aa	Jesus said "I am the Root and the Offspring of David."  Revelation 22:16.  I believe it was thru Joseph.|`|HWoLbR7Aaa	Phase 1: David  Phase 2: ????  Phase 3: Prophet!|`|B7TFX4wUaa	Correct.    Both contradictory lineages specify that they are of Joseph.  Some apologists claim one is Mary, but reading the passage shows that to not be the case.    I'm not sure about Hebrew custom of adoption and inheritance, but that seems to be the only way around this contradiction.|`|NaM4ZT64aa	Jesus was supposedly descended through Joseph (who apparently isn't actually his father) to David.  However, both accounts of this lineage are drastically different and extremely contradictory.|`|eDYXQxA9aa	Mary's lineage is unknown - in order to address the inconsistency in the two lineage's of Jesus in the NT, one is generally ascribed to Mary, despite both ending in Joseph.     In any case, it doesn't matter. The messiah is supposed to be a direct descendent of David through Solomon - in Judaism, familial affiliation is passed on the fathers side, religion on the mothers. Being "adopted" or "fostered" or someones stepchild as Jesus has to be to Joseph does not make one a descendent of that person.    I'll qualify the first comment too - any lineage quoted in the bible is obviously extremely suspect. Think about it - how would they know? The office of births, deaths and marriages didn't really exist back then...|`|ubj2alqXaa	The genealogy in Matthew is Miriam's and the genealogy in Luke is Joseph's.    >Matthew 1:16 states, "Jacob the father of Joseph, the husband of Mary"...." Matthew 1:18-19 similarly provides, "Because Joseph her (Mary's) husband was a righteous man..." Based on this language, it appears the text is describing the same Joseph. This contention is reinforced by the Greek translation, where the word "aner" is used to describe Joseph in both contexts. However, when one examines the Aramaic version of Matthew, the Joseph mentioned in 1:16 is described as "gowra," a word used elsewhere in Matthew to signify "father". For example, the Greek translation of Matthew 7:9 provides, "Which of you, if his son asks for bread, will give him a stone?". The Aramaic reads "which father (gowra) among you...."     >The counter-argument is that Matthew was written in Greek and not Aramaic, thus, the point is moot. Historical evidence does not support this position. Papias, the Greek church leader who composed the earliest known information on the gospels, states that, "Matthew composed his history in the Hebrew dialect, and every one translated it as he was able." It is crucial to point out that Papias refers to the Hebrew dialect, and not the Hebrew language. The Hebrew dialect of the time was Aramaic.    "Joseph was not his biological father...he never had sex with the virgin"    Well, not before Jesus was born anyway. ;)|`|s40sgQ45aa	From both sides
9g8spRvPaa	I know I would at least skip a few meals but I really don't think I would put my health at great risk for a strange child.  I would for my own child but would only cut back for a unknown one.  Sounds sort of selfish but this is what we all do everyday anyways.  It would be more realistic to do for a child that you knew and had a face.

I had been a Christian for a few years. I began reading about the Holy Spirit and that when you are born again you are baptized by the Holy Spirit. So I prayed and asked God to baptize me in His Holy Spirit. What happened wasn't all of a sudden, it was over a period of 2 or 3 days. I was filled with an overwhelming sense of love and caring for all mankind. It was like, if someone had stabbed me, I still would have loved them. I had just wonderful peace and happiness. It is hard to describe in words. It was definitely spiritual and I will never forget it.
Kb7ZvQ65aa	For you, I would strongly suggest inviting your friend in person because you do not come across very well in text.  You may use the  telephone if needed, but be sure to talk to him; don't just leave a message.  Also, do not confuse words like "Who" and "How" as your friend may not understand what you're asking.    You won't need to worry much about a full dialog as this is a good friend you won't need to impress.  If you have a specific topic to meet about over lunch, you may want to say so right away.  This will give your friend time to prepare.  Otherwise, just ask your friend if he or she would like to join you for lunch.  There's nothing to it.    Best of luck!

It's sort of like dreaming in sleep. You are in it, you know what is happening and then all of a sudden you wake up in your bed and everything is going on as it is supposed to. Except that with my thing the dream was actual and the waking up was also actual.

545c8190dd574a20dff4291cb029a8ccaa	Yulia is correct. Nobody can see the baby for 40 days.    Between 40 days and 1 year, nobody outside the family is supposed to see the baby.

igI5yX0vaa	You're absolutely right.  I have always wondered the same thing.    Vanessa Williams (Ugly Betty) was Miss America for a short time, wasn't she?  There was at least one Miss America of color I believe since then.    TV is dominated by whites because they are the highest percentage of Americans.  You can relate better if you look like the people portrayed.    Look at every popular movie regarding Native Americans (Last of the Mohicans, Dances with Wolves, the New World, etc).  There is always a white person who has a prominent role in the story.  Without it, it wouldn't have the mass appeal.|`|D9k5Fou5aa	Most Americans are white, so it would be tedious to keep saying white Americans. It's like that in other countries as well. If you're a white person raised in Asia, nobody is just gonna consider you just Asian.  As for history, most countries done bad and will rarely talk about the bad things they done...that's just how it is. As for tv, most Americans are white and unfortunately, most white Americans aren't open minded to entertainment by non-whites, unless it's stereotypical. White Americans are even closed minded to other white dominated countries. The reason is that America is the super power of the world and when you are the super power, u don't have to conform to others because they conform to you. However, that is starting to change because people who are looking to the future are learning Chinese.|`|th9iHEL7aa	Because white persons were the first humans to make something grand out of the land known as America.  There were native americans and african americans neither of which knew anything about masonry or ocean ferring ships.  White people dominate television because they have been in control of the company's that make all that stuff used in television.  Go to Japan, the Japenese are in control of the television.  Where is all the Latinos and Africans?  Nowhere cause they don't live there.  Though the Northern Native Americans have really bit the bullet in terms of survival, without all that happening none of the cures for diseases would have been created.  The native americans like the middle easterners would have never united under one nation because of the vast number of cultural differences.  America is about creating one culture we can all call our own.  If you think television is not representing your culture then stop watching it.  Go out and make it yourself.  All things happen for a reason.  Don't worry about any of this by 2050 no ethnic group, not race, will dominate the american population.  You should know there is only one race, the human race.  The idea of the different races is ignorant of the fact that we all can have children with each other.  I mean its not like our parts are not interchangable.|`|lv9ahVwgaa	You are very right for pointing this out.

The living word of God is His spirit so everytime we say living really we mean it's the spirit of God. In order to sustain life in His kingdom He gives us scripture to follow by so we can later join Him in a kingdom that does not have error as we know it here on this earth. It's not boring, it's just also that you have to really seek God and ask Him before you read to reveal to you all truths and He will, trust me.|`|O2Kfusnmaa	I'm glad you asked this question, because before every Christian receives the Holy Spirit, reading the bible is boring (for the most part) and becomes a duty or chore. The truth is the Word of God is not boring, it is full of life, but if you are not reading it with that life in you, it's gonna be boring.     Have you asked the Lord to give you the Holy Spirit? He wants to give Him to you! You don't have to anything to earn Him, all you have to do is ask and believe you will receive Him.     The Holy Spirit makes everything alive and points out verses and tells you books He wants you to read. Don't live a Christian life not knowing the Holy Spirit.     If you already have received the Holy Spirit, tell God you think His word is boring. The best thing you can do is be honest with Him... He knows every thought you are thinking.

Be careful when you do this. Do not stop until the full fart has been expelled. Walk an extra 30 feet to make sure the smell has left your pants.    FLY BY    The act of scouting out a bathroom before pooping.  Walk in and check for other poopers. If there are others in the bathroom, leave and come  back again. Be careful not to become a FREQUENT FLYER.  People may become suspicious if they catch you constantly going into the bathroom.    ESCAPEE    A fart that slips out while taking a leak at the urinal or forcing a poop  in a stall. This is usually accompanied by a sudden wave of embarrassment.  If you release an escapee, do not acknowledge it. Pretend it did not happen.  If you are standing next to the farter in the urinal, pretend you did not hear it.  No one likes an escapee. It is uncomfortable for all involved. Making a joke or  laughing makes both parties feel uneasy.    JAILBREAK    When forcing a poop, several farts slip out at a machine gun pace.  This is usually a side effect of diarrhea or a hangover. If this should  happen, do not panic. Remain in the stall until everyone has left the bathroom to  spare everyone the awkwardness of what just occurred.    COURTESY FLUSH    The act of flushing the toilet the instant the poop hits the water.  This reduces the amount of air time the poop has to stink up the bathroom.  This can help you avoid being caught doing the WALK OF SHAME.    WALK OF SHAME    Walking from the stall, to the sink, to the door after you have just  stunk up the bathroom. This can be a very uncomfortable moment if someone  walks in and busts you. As with farts, it is best to pretend that the smell  does not exist. Can be avoided with the use of the COURTESY FLUSH.    THE POOPING FRIENDS NETWORK (P.F.N)    A group of co-workers who band together to ensure emergency pooping  goes off without incident. This group can help you to monitor the where  abouts of Out Of The Closet Poopers, and identify SAFE HAVENS.    SAFE HAVENS    A seldom used bathroom somewhere in the building where you can least  expect visitors. Try floors that are predominantly of the opposite sex.  This will reduce the odds of a pooper of your sex entering the bathroom.    TURD BURGLAR    Someone who does not realize that you are in the stall and tries to  force the door open. This is one of the most shocking and vulnerable moments  that can occur when taking a poop at work. If this occurs, remain in the stall  until the Turd Burglar leaves. This way you will avoid all uncomfortable eye contact.    CAMO-COUGH    A phony cough that alerts all new entrants into the bathroom that you  are in a stall. This can be used to cover-up a WATERMELON, or to alert  potential Turd Burglars. Very effective when used in conjunction with an  ASTAIRE.    ASTAIRE    A subtle toe-tap that is used to alert potential Turd Burglars that  you are occupying a stall. This will remove all doubt that the stall is  occupied. If you hear an Astaire, leave the bathroom immediately so the pooper can poop in peace.    WATERMELON    A poop that creates a loud splash when hitting the toilet water. This is also an embarrassing incident. If you feel a Watermelon coming on, create a diversion. See CAMO-COUGH.    HAVANA OMELET    A case of diarrhea that creates a series of loud splashes in the toilet water. Often accompanied by an Escapee. Try using a Camo-Cough with an ASTAIRE.    UNCLE TED    A bathroom user who seems to linger around forever. Could spend extended lengths of time in front of the mirror or sitting on the pot. An Uncle Ted makes it difficult to relax while on the crapper, as you should always wait to poop when the bathroom is empty. This benefits you as well as the other bathroom attendees.|`|AA10011095	Yes, and in every country except the US, race and religion are connected in pepople's minds.

OeVGYXhxaa	Some sins are unforgivable. Jesus Christ said: Every sort of sin and blasphemy will be forgiven men, but the blasphemy against the spirit will not be forgiven. (Matthew 12:31) So, then, blasphemy against Gods holy spirit, or active force, will not be forgiven. The apostle Paul alluded to such sin when he wrote: It is impossible as regards those who have once for all been enlightened, .?.?. but who have fallen away, to revive them again to repentance, because they impale the Son of God afresh for themselves and expose him to public shame.Hebrews 6:4-6.     Only God knows if a person has committed the unforgivable sin. However, Paul shed light on this matter when he wrote: If we practice sin willfully after having received the accurate knowledge of the truth, there is no longer any sacrifice for sins left, but there is a certain fearful expectation of judgment. (Hebrews 10:26,?27) A willful person acts deliberately, or is obstinately and often perversely self-willed. (Websters New Collegiate Dictionary) Anyone willfully and obstinately continuing to practice sin after he knows the truth is not forgiven. Hence, it is not so much the sin itself as it is the heart condition, the degree of willfulness involved, that affects whether the sin is forgivable or not. On the other hand, what is likely the case when an erring Christian is deeply disturbed about his wrongdoing? His great concern probably indicates that he has not, in fact, committed an unforgivable sin|`|3ba0ab7304ca31210254987d14dbe035aa	This verse means the person who claims to follow Christ, but indulges in sin, is only fooling themselves.    This has a special meaning for all those who claim to be Christian and yet violate what the bible calls sin, insisting they can live any way they like.    If you are a Christian, and sin, and repent of it and try not to do it again, God sees this.  Much different than a person who calls themselves a Christian and lives in unrepentant, blatant sin and doesn't care what they are doing, thinking they can live as they like.|`|eO2rnf7yaa	I think it means that if you intentionally sin - fully aware that you are sinning, and you do it to deliberately offend and completely reject God, then for you and that sin there is no sacrifice or forgiveness.   I think Paul was talking here about sin against the Holy Spirit,  and trying to give an example of a sin against the Holy Spirit.   I don't know how to read Paul's letters in their original language.  Maybe it would make more sense that way.  I think Paul sometimes wrote in a way that was difficult to interpret.  That doesn't mean he was wrong,  just that I can't always understand him.  Unfortunately some of the Bible is not written in a way that is easy to understand.  That's one of the reasons I am Roman Catholic.  I like having 2000 years of scholarly work in theology and Bible scholarship to help guide me.

If that is the case, why then does the bible say this?  Because the law is still good and yes after you are baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sin and start to keep the law.  If after than you sin willfully, no there is no more forgiveness for your sin.  What you may think is sin is not.

It was directed to Jewish Christians tempted to abandon their faith.     The Greek word for 'sin' indicates persistance, but it is NOT talking about weakness of the flesh, sins that you don't want to do, sins in ignorance or backsliding.     It is all in the present tense, the "sin", "remains no sacrifice" and "will consume" are present tense verbs.  Present tense indicates a ONGOING and CONTINUOUS action.     The author may not even be speaking of sin in general, but the sin of apostasy from the faith (Hebrews 6:4-6). As long as someone continues to be an apostate, he cannot be renewed.    Remember James 5:19-20?    Brethren, if anyone among you wanders from the truth, and someone turns him back, let him know that he who turns a sinner from the error of his way will save a soul from death and cover a multitude of sins, (Jas. 5:19-20).    It is never okay to sin, but do not let that verse scare you. God is merciful, he knows your frame and how fallible you are.   Man has a natural bent toward sin.  Paul calls this the natural man. (1 Cor. 2:14; 1 Cor. 15:46, 47)  Even after becoming a Christian, one is still heavily influenced by this earthy nature, which is why Paul tells us that we must mortify the deeds of the body and die daily. (Rom. 8:13; Col. 3:5; 1 Cor. 15:31).|`|RQHCwZE2aa	It means you're a bad person and you're going to hell and that's that.

"Forgiveness is always available to those who repent and confess their sins (1 John 1:9). This warning is against deliberate, persistent sinning.

AA11104965	The problem is not that people judge others. It is that they don't put any thought into it first.    Judgment is a necessary part of life. If any action or idea is wrong, then the people who perform it or believe it are wrong to do so. The fact that people criticize other for judging proves that even they are aware of this.    So is the Bible. People who claim that the Bible is against judgment are deliberately taking it out of context. It is really against hypocrisy, not judgment. For example:    "Do not judge, or you too will be judged. For in the same way you judge others, you will be judged, and with the measure you use, it will be measured to you." (Matthew 7:1-2)    In other words, there is no punishment for judging others unless you are a hypocrite.    "Why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brother's eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye? How can you say to your brother, 'Let me take the speck out of your eye,' when all the time there is a plank in your own eye? You hypocrite, first take the plank out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother's eye." (Matthew 7:3-5)    Notice that it doesn't tell you to leave the speck in your neighbor's eye. You are supposed to get it out, but only after you have first removed the plank from yours. Judgment is necessary. Hypocrisy is what is wrong.|`|uu2MV1KSaa	not at all.|`|eHyJ9mYFaa	No, Jesus tells us that there is but one Judge and that is The Father.

IT says if we judge, we will be judged by the same standard.   Since we judge by the righteousness of JESUS, and everyone will be judged be that anyway, we will be OK.|`|wkIAnDB6aa	No one has the right to judge, but everyone does. It's almost a human instinct.|`|OeVGYXhxaa	In the Sermon on the Mount, when stressing the need to stop judging others, Jesus said: Why, then, do you look at the straw in your brothers eye, but do not consider the rafter in your own eye? (Matthew 7:1-3) Can you visualize the scene? Someone who is prone to be critical offers to extract a mere straw from his brothers eye. The critic would be claiming that his brother could not see matters clearly enough so as to render acceptable judgments. But the critics own ability to judge is impaired by a raftera log or beam that might be used to support a roof. What an unforgettable way to stress how foolish it is to criticize the minor faults of our brothers when we may have major faults of our own!|`|AA11668191	Everyone has the right to judge. Scifiguy already said a lot of what I would say, so I'll only add that it is the consequence of your judgment that really matters. All too often, people (myself included) use their judgment as an excuse to mistreat or disregard others' feelings. "You're gay, so I can call you a ******," "you're a Christian, so I can call you gullible," or "you're poor, so I can call you lazy." Sentiments like this are wrong even though they aren't necessarily hypocritical. It's the wrong way to build self-esteem; taking others down doesn't raise you up.|`|jdRKZe18aa	Well if you are a real "christian" then you know that none of us have ANY RIGHT TO judge another - you remember that phrase that Christ clearly stated "Judge not lest ye be judged...."

But as Christians judging others to condemn them etc. this is not our job. It belongs to God to judge the person, because we are not God and we don't see the heart of that person.|`|ObLMLZ74aa	Sure, judge yourselves.

eb4e977a0cb9ce50b08bf74f0f3a0c61aa	Go see a psychologist or your family doctor.  There is absolutely no medical condition that makes you "want to drink blood" - if a person does think they "want to drink blood" that is a psychological issue, and not triggered by any physiological response. There is a unique delusion where the victim wants to drink blood, aptly named Renfield syndrome, after the character in Dracula, but it is not a physiological need.    If you drink blood, it does not transfer into your blood system - it goes to the stomach where it is broken down chemically, and the iron in it is destroyed by the hydrochloric acid in your stomach. Humans cannot ingest iron in an unprotected state - iron pills are coated in order to allow them to enter the small intestine in a ball of chyme (semi-digested food matter), and be digested there away from the stomach acids. Blood would be broken down to water and the molecules that make up the blood cells and platelets. There is thus no way ingested blood can do anything for you except to provide water. There are little inherent nutrients in blood - and most of what is there is from the person eating a good meal, which is digested and the nutrients enter the bloodstream through the walls of the small intestine - proteins, carbohydrates, and fats. Anyone who tells you they need to drink blood to survive or stay healthy is a delusional wannabee at best, or a lying psychotic at worst.    As for "psychic" vampires, there is absolutely no proof whatsoever of any way to "drain" energy from another human being. There is no evidence of chi, prana, blood energy, or any of that twiddle-twaddle. The body does generate a low-level electrical and electromagnetic field, but has no way to physically drain those fields from someone else. A person might claim they can do such , "feeding" off your emotions and so on and so forth, but it is a delusion.     Lastly, every single one of the self-professed "vampires" out there are 100% human, with average human physiology, no different than you, me, or Captain Kangaroo. If they go to the hospital for any reason needing bloodwork or DNA testing, they will be proven to be human, no anomalies, no glitches, no organs they don't need, etc. etc. etc. This need to be a "vampire" is a psychological delusion, and for anyone throwing a temper tantrum and screaming, "They do exist! They do exist!" - fine. Let's see some real proof, and not from these stupid vampire websites spewing their fictional trash. No, go to your doctor, have the aforementioned labwork done, and if he says, "Look, you're a vampire!" then scan those lab results along with his affadavit on stationery with his letterhead on it, and post them as a downloadable file so we can all see your proof.

Did you know, it is natural for men to desire women who remind them of their own mothers and women to desire men who remind them of their fathers? so, with that being said...why are soooo many black men feeling less drawn to women who look like the same woman who birthed, nurtured and had his damn back? makes no sense- shows there is a problem. They see how the black woman is degraded, they have heard the stories of their mothers and grandmothers, yet...they add more fuel to the fire against black women.

I think, especially when it is a family member. it is some times a lack of respect for a woman who would continue to be with some one who walks all over them and treats them like garbage.   I say this because i have a relative who is a crack/cokehead when he wants to fukk up he gets a white girl because he can snort and beat her *** and order her around.    but after he drys out he's back to wanting a strong black woman by his side...|`|ugdutKAnaa	That is so 1998...and bch pls with this topic.|`|jzG8QcWQaa	Let me let you in on a little secret!...... Most black women don't care if a black man is with a white women..... it's just the way some black men treat those black women they have rejected.......

My friend's girlfriend is black and black guys always give them dirty looks. And her father and church talk bad about it.  In fact the black community seems more okay with black men and white women then with white men and black women.

I am a white female in an interracial relationship and i have gotten both sides of the spectrum since weve been dating.  I get the ppl that call me things I shall not repeat here haha, and then i also get ppl (a lot from his family) accepting me no matter what.

sRvfF732aa	People just get off on gossiping about others and even like to make up flaws so that they can feel better about themselves.  It doesn't matter how old you get, this will always happen, but the point will come where you will just be like "let em think what they think." I'm 24, and I still get this and I hate it too, but it doesn't bother me as much as it used to.  My family is always saying that I'm overweight because all I eat is chocolate and candy, which is SO not the case, but whatever. I'm tired of arguing about it so I just let them think what they want.

6quRjsHGaa	I prefer low rise briefs. Usually in dark colours but lights are ok with me (especially if I'm wearing light shorts).    I prefer the support they give as my parts are held in place & don't jiggle around (like they do in boxers), which can get very uncomfortable.  I also like the fact that, as they're tight & have short sides, they don't get irritating when your running (or doing anything physical). I found that boxers would ride up my legs all the time which, again, became annoying.    Personally, I can't stand boxers because of those reasons. I just find them far too uncomfortable. (I haven't tried any other types)    I find briefs to be more attractive. If you get the right ones (ie. brand/style/etc.) they can show of your package very well & just, generally, look great.    20/m/UK|`|l2qtG4yfaa	I wear Boxer briefs.    Im 16 in the U.S.

AA11312653	While I agree that this sort of answer probably isn't what the asker is looking for, when you participate in a public forum then you must be prepared for a representative cross section of the public including the mannerless, the smart alecs, the block heads, and the obnoxious right along with the kind, the helpful, and well informed.|`|f6fCixDnaa	No offence..but "who thinks they know whats better for that person" Its a bit of a funny comment.  I dont know anyone who would think cancer vs not cancer is that strong of an argument to use the word "think they know" rather than "knows".  Smoking is bad, dangerous and unhealthy, and it is stupid to purposefully and knowingly put your health at risk. So although it is rude people saying that kinda stuff when someone wants a genuine answer...it is the total truth. (although they can keep it to themselves, i agree with you there)    if you are a non-smoker you would know that smoke smells absolutely disgusting! Smokers breath is disgusting! They can stand 4 or 5 metres away and its still all in my face like burnt toast.   People can make their own life choices but in the end i shouldnt have to be breathing in second hand smoke, not to mention smelling it..its one of the most overpowering smells!  Im a medical receptionist and some patients go outside and have a cigarette while waiting, then they come back in a minute after they finished and talk to me..all i smell is smoke.  I dont think smokers realise just how overpowering and how long it lingers on their breath.    I guess im just passionate cuz i see patient after patient come in with cancer and being a smoker or exsmoker. Not to mention..the women who smoke age so quickly. The 40 yr old smokers look 55. Its pretty sad.|`|5vO61nuvaa	I don't think that this is something that soley pertains to questions on smoking. Unfortunately it's just something you have to deal with when posting a question on a public forum.|`|6f812b070bb6a7494447f70abb1119fdaa	This is an open forum where everyone may read and everyone may respond.  You can't say "just these people" because that's not the format here.  Asking questions about smoking is going to get the spectrum of responses.  If you only want certain kinds of answers looking to support an existing opinion, you should stick to talking with friends.  What you get here is a majority and unbiased sample of people throughout the world.    Frankly, what IS better for EVERYONE is that they don't smoke.  It's a scientific fact.  One cannot hide from the truth.|`|KBVAbwUXaa	Smoking is nasty|`|sv1HeVfDaa	Well smoking is generally looked down upon because people are killing themselves, the environment, and others around them.|`|3021dd59122a043dd94c0dcf8ea2b684aa	I don't know if you want someone to answer your question or not but I will anyways. People are not really trying to be rude but they are trying to look out for the other person in a way. They think this person will make the choice to smoke mary jane or tobacco or whatever which ruins a persons healths and potentially relationships and so they're hoping the yahoo asker will chose not to smoke. Besides it affects us too because we're second hand smokers and the smell is just nasty!|`|dVMfCdikaa	Inhaling smoke can put you in the hospital and more importantly it allows chemicals into your blood. If you are looking for chemicals in your blood you either need a real doctor or something is wrong.    Weed can cause you to have mental problems. The fact is that weed harms your body.

I40vnqNyaa	a BOX..   lol..  sorry had to do it. :)      edit:  ok.... ok..  seriously... http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandora%27s...|`|4TX26viFaa	She wasn't in charge of anything. Hers was a morality tale, she had curiosity and released evil into the world because she couldn't contain her curiosity inside herself.|`|10fef0b14524d535c54a941a510b7f6baa	okay, so Zeus saw that there were only men (humans) on Earth, so he created a women. Her name, Pandora, meant many gifts or all gifts or something, so the gods all gave her gifts. Zeus' gift was a box (sometimes a jar) filled with grief and sadness and he advised pandora not to EVER open that box. But she did, and she let all of the bad things out in the Earth, leaving only hope inside... so in short, a box (sometimes jar) that Zeus gave her  it's a variation of Adam and Eve and the apple... :)|`|HjMbOgvqaa	pandoras box held the evils that would inflick man|`|sjMIFH9Faa	RUINING THE WORLD!!! Really, its true, read Thegony by Hesiod, he tells the story. I will summarize it for you.    Zeus became angry with man (note: not mankind, women weren't around during his era) and to punish them he took away fire so man couldn't cook their food or warm their homes. A titan named Prometheus felt pity for man so he stole fire from Zeus and gave it to man. Well, Zeus was pissed when he found out so he punished Prometheus by chaining him in a cave and having a raven eat his liver which would regenerate daily.    Now to man, well Zeus gave them the worst thing imaginable, woman. Pandora carried a jar around with her which contained plague, discord, toil, and finally hope. Well soon Pandora became curious of the contence of the jar she was carrying around and she opened it, setting free toil discord and plague, while leaving hope contained in her jar.     What this means: Well the Greeks were not feminists by any stretch of the imagination. In fact, socially anyway, they saw woman as the root of all problems that man experiences, hence Pandora's Jug. Later Greek authors added to this thought. Thucydides for example proclaimed that the only good reputation a woman could have was none at all. Other authors suggested it would be easier if men could just purchase sons.|`|b6cd9d6fe5a0ec1d495444c45c2b75f2aa	Pandora, according to Greek mythology was the first woman created. She was given a box that she was instructed not to open. Of course, she opens the box letting all the evils out into the world. She closed the box just in time to save hope, but that was it. Pandora was a mortal, so she wasn't really the goddess of anything. She was just given this box.|`|Ei0gyK3Iaa	Pandora was the first woman. She was crafted by the gods, and given to Epimetheus (prometheus's brother) by Zeus as a punishment for Prometheus's stealing the fire of the gods. She was given uncontrollable curiosity and a jar full of woe. She opened it and voila! Life sucks.    If she's in charge of anything, it is ruining mankind

By definition Nudist are definitely a minority, but society tries desperately not to even acknowledge it.    There are fewer men in the world than women, so by definition, men are the minority.  But by society's standards, women are.    There are fewer blacks in the US now than Hispanics.  Both are minorities, problem is now the Hispanics are getting more preference because its a larger voting block, they are the minority majority.    So... what is it exactly that you ask.|`|hIdzQoquaa	Consorted? I've consorted nudists.|`|c425bd77add075a97bdceeb9591a73bbaa	In a strict definition of the word, yes, nudists are a minority.

o0Q7LmMsaa	i have a friend that doesn't really speak english and   she told me that english is really hard for her to learn  because there are so many words that are spelled differently but said the same and mean a different thing. also the conjugation of words can be irregular too.  but just because it's hard for one person doesn't mean it  s hard for everybody  it depends    =)|`|AA11564934	yes, it's one of the hardest actually.|`|qJkRPhIKaa	Many experts say english is the hardest language in the world to learn. Im 17 a junior in highschool born and raised around the language and still havent mastered the entire language.|`|1ce0748c0ab23dcbbd0d889d57183122aa	Yes I think it's the hardest... I'm a native speaker and I STILL don't get it o_o lol. We have complex grammar, strange pronunciations and soooo much slang, and spelling is messed up. For example: Phone. Why is it a Ph? Another one- Tough. Since when does gh make an F sound? Cause in Though the gh is silent. See? It's wierd.|`|35dbXfY6aa	Well it's not hard at all, especially when you speaks French.  I just began to learn English when I moved to Canada(5months ago) and now I get a good level.  The only difficulty for me was and it's steel be is the pronunciation of some words. But I think time will help me out to obtain this ability.|`|DqbkhWCxaa	It depends on what language.  Most European languages sound almost the same when you sound them out slowly; whereas Asian native speakers may have a more difficult time, with their vocabulary a lot different than ours, for example, most Asians have a hard time using our 'R' sound.|`|tcmsBE4taa	Actually, I think it is the easiest language to learn - Im not bragging or anything -  but i think it is....just try learning French or Spanish, languages where you have to conjugate verbs and stuff. =D|`|lRU7na0yaa	English is supposed to be the hardest language to learn.. personally I thought it was really hard ... there's just something about the diffirence between the way a word is spelled and how it's pronounced .Then there's the fact that one word can mean fifty million things depending on how its used. Overall though how hard it is to learn really depends on how much contact and practice the person has and how old they are..|`|3uiIrxojaa	It depends ... for example if you're learning english in ..let's say Sweden, it will take a while to learn it there, but if you come from Sweden to America to *LIVE*...  you'll probably  learn the language faster..
SlPncQjcaa	Well, I am Muslim, but I assume when you say "beliefs" you mean those of all kinds.  Nothing on this Earth could "threaten" my beliefs as a Muslim.  There may be people or circumstances who can threaten your ability to practice or exercise your beliefs or your peace, but nothing could scare me away from something I truly believe in.  There are many wars and conflicts happening present day and those of the past as well (Gaza and the Holocaust) that may threaten or threatened the lives of people solely based on their religious beliefs, but they more threatened their lives than their actual religious and moral beliefs.  Someone could threaten my life or physical well-being, and I will still die with my religious beliefs in tact.

AA11394813	What about people who were born in South Africa and then move here and become citizens, but are white? Caucasian refers to a mountain range between Europe and Asia, so in theory Asian people are Caucasian too.    I can understand not wanting to be called a color, but to be called African-whatever is a term I would find insulting. It makes it sound like people belong in Africa and are just camping out here; dual citizenship type of thing.    Why don't we get rid of affirmative action, and make it politically incorrect to refer to a persons' race as being their skin color?|`|f714ef26ad8f0b92d25c68a6b4041d5daa	I understand what you're saying because I also see a difference between race and national origin (however, I don't care what people call themselves if it makes them happy).      But here's my take on this:  If someone is called "African American" while living in the United States, does he become an "African European" if he moves to France?  In other words, his race would be the same, but he would be described differently depending on his place of residence.  That seems a little weird.    I'm white and don't care whether I'm identified as white or Caucasian; I don't have a problem with either term.|`|mRt7ReHLaa	I agree with you about how the word Caucasian sounds weird. I think the reason you don't hear Irish Americans or Italian Americans because the whites have so many ethnic groups mixed within them.    I'm not a full African American, I have some Jamaican in me. But I think the reason why the term is used a lot because mainly all blacks that live in the US can trace back that their family came from Africa. Not all, but many.|`|o4zAMlCoaa	Seasoning- lol!   African American sounds more professional, even though most Black-Americans aren't from Africa.   We use those terms to associate with region decent- Caucus mountain region- Caucasian; Africa- African American.  But Black just sounds kinda negative.   And you're right! We're all Americans, and should drop the political correctness.|`|qe0RNp7xaa	Exactly! When was the last time some one called you caucasian? If I'm white, your black. My family is from England and my sister and I are first generation Americans, but they've become citizens. They are American. They don't go around calling themselves British-Americans.|`|qJkRPhIKaa	African american sounds good. and is politically correct. Irish american italian american all sound politically correct but people dont think they sound good.|`|jzG8QcWQaa	Stop your complaining MR.!..... Does it matter? Really?....SMH!|`|dSOfuO3Laa	Right on!|`|AA11484353	Why do you care how others refer to themselves? You can call yourself what you want to call yourself. No one is stopping you. The fact of the matter is someone conjured  up the term African American one day in attempts of being politically correct. However, at this point, all the black people I know, refer to themselves as just that... black. I think the fact that we are american is pretty much obvious. There is nothing wrong with being proud of your culture, no matter what that is.|`|q6kvVkNPaa	OMG this is exactly the same way i feel!!! I think that's very annoying also. People don't go around saying "hey im an Italian American." People usuallyy just say i'm American. I no some of my friends that aren't white don't even like to be called african americans.  Just because their that color doesn't mean their from africa.|`|fOYp0gGqaa	You know the actress Charlize Theron is African American?   lol|`|AA10272424	African-American is something cooked up by the media because they had no better word when referring to the black race (ie: white race = caucasian).  For me .. an African-American is someone who was born in Africa & is now an American citizen. Im seeing a few ignorant stupid answers here. You have the right to rant (just like any one else) & voice your opinion. Im sure there are many others who also feel the way you do. My heritage is Scottish-Irish-German-English-American Indian but bottom line is I was born in this country so therefore I am an American .. period.|`|UspK4SQBaa	Nice rant.  As an American, you are free to call yourself what you like, and so am I, period.  If you don't know what the terms mean, you should look them up.  They are readily available.|`|FKxrJxbPaa	lmao you sound bitter.    Black people...and any ethnic group at that...reserve the right to refer to themselves in the manner in which they please. They're of African decent and their culture and ancestral identity was systematically robbed, beaten, raped and brainwashed out of them for the last 400 years, while they had to live in a society that is hostile to their cultural existence. If they wanna call themselves African American then f*ck it...let them.    How is it any of your buisness anyways?    And FYI...come to the east coast. 4th GENERATION Italians and Irishmen still call themselves as such because its ultimately where they come from and what made them. Their ancestors fled disease and edured intense prejudice so that they could be where they are, and refering to themselves as such is their way of acknowledging and respecting their forefathers.     Stop Hatin'...it aint a good look|`|LvnEbqxAaa	Black people don't like any whites saying anything about them (it's ok if other black people say anything; they even call each other the N word.)     They also think that white people are the only people who can be racist for some odd reason. They are some of the most racist people.. it's aggravating. Racism is racism, period.|`|LVe6MJfMaa	Uh..what if your black but born in England? Seriously lol. Everyone in the world isn't american.|`|SBF6jqlLaa	American is the nationality- so that shows that we were born here, but the African part, or italian, or Irish shows ethnicity...it explains your features, your hair. It is not offensive to me, at all. And black and white, is not descriptive enough. There are 'white' colored "black" people. I personally dont like white and black, as there are no people with black or white skin. Maybe, very dark- very pale- but look at your keyboard (assuming it's black) who the hell is that dark? look at the white letters (assuming again) who is that white?|`|398p9O07aa	Damn straight:)  haha.

Honky will do in a pinch.  But that is just me.|`|Czpfs8RLaa	Obviously you werent asking for an answer but ill give you one anyways, It was a way (in the times of slavery ending) for people to accept dark skinned people but also to show that we are not all the same personally I think that African American is an endearing term as is Caucation we should all be proud of ourselves no matter our colour!
Hr2tnZtqaa	It is my belief  If you commit suicide you jump right back in. Otherwise  you  stay on the other side for awhile. You  review and work on your weakness and decide what it is you need to work on. Some may decide not come back. A situation  has to  be right, that would best fit you. It can  take awhile in our time.|`|yCTxg4t5aa	If you choose to, you can take a break, most do. And some even wait around and choose what family they want to be born into. But they're not exactly Ghosts, when we die we are removed from this 'dimension' (for lack of a better word) there's a veil that separates the physical world we're in now, at different times of the Year,Day,Month ETC. the strength of the veil fluctuates, so depending on the strength you can sometimes influence the physical world. Ghosts are actually people (or animals) that are confused, sometimes they don't even know that they've died or have unfinished business, Others are simply impressions that are left over from strong emotions, so not all ghosts are actual entities.|`|AA12384132	No|`|uFJXz1x3aa	nope. the second you die is the second your born|`|aZKgs79Naa	No, but I believe that you're only re-encardinated 7 times.    after that, you're judged by God.    Just my beliefs :))|`|uPNP1xzpaa	you are given a right to choose.

AA11729666	I think it does.  It also seems to drive people away from Christianity.  In all honesty I got more of Jesus' messege out of Jeffersons' Bible.  The Evangelical direction seems to be centered around Paul which seems odd to me given they (Jesus/Paul) don't always agree and the apologetics used to reconcile the difference dig the hole even deeper in trying to rationlize the issue.  Jesus' messege gets lost and diluted in the apologetics and details.    ~Respectfully|`|3ba0ab7304ca31210254987d14dbe035aa	I have no idea what you're talking about.|`|e8a42257dd2b34817d2020222ee63839aa	Evangelical/fundamentalist theology has its roots in Calvinism, which has its roots in Manichaeism, so it undermines the whole Christian message:  love.|`|AA11648578	Jesus taught the Gospel which is the atonement that is the good news.  Paul taught the same Gospel.  What on earth do you keep on about?    John 6:    51 I am the living bread which came down from heaven: if any man eat of this bread, he shall live for ever: and the bread that I will give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.       What do you think Jesus taught?|`|4boTYkt7aa	Jesus gave us all the same gift.Belief is never enough,if it were, even the demons in Hades would be saved,because they also know and believe in Jesus.They tremble at hearing His name,James 2:19.|`|51fe01ef6db0c1bd743afcb3e7a2e1ffaa	Absolutely. It teaches "just say this little prayer and you're forever saved" no matter what you do, how you live, etc.     And they certainly do not teach their followers to be Christ-like.|`|dmHr3orqaa	Belief is where it starts though, isn't it? If you believe the sermon on the mount then you will change, or seek to change. It's not easy to be meek or humble, or be a peace maker in these times, but it is something to strive after. We will reap the benefits when we do, and God will help us if we call on Him.  John 6 verse 14 (i think) talks about belief as a work.  (sorry, I may have the verse wrong, but it's in chapter 6)|`|8IHfytEvaa	No.    Evangelical theology follows the Bible.    What you are talking about is the view of liberal theologians such as the Rev. Mr. Wright from Chicago.|`|TEaFwk1Baa	They were the light of the world because they were holding up their cigarette lighters|`|IbtQ5IKNaa	If this is the case where you have to stand and listen to one person, then everyone should be paid equal amounts and everyone should be able to receive the benefits that that one person is receiving.    In fact those before that talked like this, usually didn't have much but the cloths on their backs... I have to always ask myself how many sheep love to graze on grass.    If these people were so great, they will then take every dollar they have and put it directly back into the congregation and the building they are in and community for most. If they did that then see Adam to Muhammed SAW message complete.    They don't do that, they all live in better places than you and the Lord will destroy them in hellfire with all that to burn them as fuel.|`|534a53962aea0e3af7a266ab51ec01ecaa	YEP.    Evangelists are supposed to teach the Word  of God.  I know not one who calls themself an evangelist that teach the word of God according to the bible.  To beleive in something is altogether different that knowing something.

Have a nice day!|`|530e3f8d6a946003d76d09039006b8e2aa	Well, the problem here is that we would have to be very careful in defining our terms here.  But essentially I think I get the gist of what you are saying.    Yes, I think that certain theologies do undermine - if not contradict - the Sermon On The Mount.    Some evangelical types (though certainly NOT all) that I have met are into this idea that you are saved just by making a decision and saying a prayer.  I just don't think its that simple.  And some preachers pervert the Gospel message and make salvation into this totally individual thing, going as far as to say things like "Don't worry, you are prosperous because God has rewarded you for being his servant".      I believe that being a Christian is not about stuff you do alone.  Its about living in the world, being a part of other people's lives, accepting them warts and all, forgiving people, giving away possessions, loving your enemies, and walking with others.     Jesus tells us that the first will be last and the last will be first.  He also makes it very clear that if you are rich, you may have a very, very hard time getting into Heaven.  He doesn't say its impossible, but he says it could be unlikely.  The analogy of trying to fit a very large animal through something that is a quarter of an inch wide pretty much says it all.  Jesus didn't use that analogy for nothing.|`|Q2aikWjUaa	So tell me when did a evangelical fundie ever follow the bible|`|L70U9Pevaa	da sermon is bs

I have been just drinking about a shot of it a day cause I can't have too much sugar. It is actually good for a person the way red wine is but for people who don't drink alcohol this stuff is made. We buy it right in our grocery store. So you can just call & ask them what kind they have then look up the 800 number on line of the co. that makes it to see what kind they sell. This stuff I had was Welch's.|`|6f812b070bb6a7494447f70abb1119fdaa	You can ask if they have anything non-alcoholic.

I'm sure they have water and other beverages you can ask for.|`|b165361aa3bdfd3dd4401459ad6b7836aa	Cider, sparkling juice, water, or orange juice.  It just depends on what they have.

eb4e977a0cb9ce50b08bf74f0f3a0c61aa	There is absolutely no medical condition that makes you "want to drink blood" - if a person does think they "want to drink blood" that is a psychological issue, and not triggered by any physiological response. There is a unique delusion where the victim wants to drink blood, aptly named Renfield syndrome, after the character in Dracula, but it is not a physiological need.    If you drink blood, it does not transfer into your blood system - it goes to the stomach where it is broken down chemically, and the iron in it is destroyed by the hydrochloric acid in your stomach. Humans cannot ingest iron in an unprotected state - iron pills are coated in order to allow them to enter the small intestine in a ball of chyme (semi-digested food matter), and be digested there away from the stomach acids. Blood would be broken down to water and the molecules that make up the blood cells and platelets. There is thus no way ingested blood can do anything for you except to provide water. There are little inherent nutrients in blood - and most of what is there is from the person eating a good meal, which is digested and the nutrients enter the bloodstream through the walls of the small intestine - proteins, carbohydrates, and fats. Anyone who tells you they need to drink blood to survive or stay healthy is a delusional wannabee at best, or a lying psychotic at worst.    As for "psychic" vampires, there is absolutely no proof whatsoever of any way to "drain" energy from another human being. There is no evidence of chi, prana, blood energy, or any of that twiddle-twaddle. The body does generate a low-level electrical and electromagnetic field, but has no way to physically drain those fields from someone else. A person might claim they can do such , "feeding" off your emotions and so on and so forth, but it is a delusion.     Lastly, every single one of the self-professed "vampires" out there are 100% human, with average human physiology, no different than you, me, or Captain Kangaroo. If they go to the hospital for any reason needing bloodwork or DNA testing, they will be proven to be human, no anomalies, no glitches, no organs they don't need, etc. etc. etc. This need to be a "vampire" is a psychological delusion, and for anyone throwing a temper tantrum and screaming, "They do exist! They do exist!" - fine. Let's see some real proof, and not from these stupid vampire websites spewing their fictional trash. No, go to your doctor, have the aforementioned labwork done, and if he says, "Look, you're a vampire!" then scan those lab results along with his affadavit on stationery with his letterhead on it, and post them as a downloadable file so we can all see your proof. Will you do that for me?    I am a Nurse, with real medical education, training and knowledge.|`|0s190C7Zaa	Hard to say I've never met a real Vampire before.|`|yCTxg4t5aa	For starters don't ask about it on YA? you'll never get any good responses on here, find a forum or something and ask there.|`|AA12223669	You're not, you just wish you were.

And even if you thought you might need to ask, you wouldn't, because you'd be a vampire, and that would be ridiculous.    I'll indulge this, though, because its a funny question. If you think you're a vampire in the classic sense that you know from movies, you could try going out during the day and if someone sees you burn up and turn into a pile of ashes, at least everyone else will know you were a vampire, even if you don't. I'm pretty sure you have a heartbeat and that's a big clue. You may have been bitten by the crazy bug but unless something came within inches of taking your life and then offered you salvation if you drank their blood, you're probably good to go. You could also try not eating for a few weeks and seeing if you die, You wouldn't die if you were a vampire.

In fact he said that even he did not know (at that time...could be that he knows by now).  So the very fact that people say that it is 2012 probably is a sure bet that it isnt. Remember that in 1999, many people believed that the year 2000 was the time too.<br>  However, there are many things that have to happen before the new heaven, & I personally do not see it coming in even this millenium. Remember that time is meaningless to God, & 'soon' to a God who is eternal can be a million years. <br>  That being said remember too that when we die, that is the end of the world to us. That could also be why we all have to be constantly prepared. Death could be at any moment & no man knows when it will come either. Many people awake each morning all health & good, & are dead by the end of the day. Many people go to sleep at night & wake up dead in the morning (lol). <br>  Though some people believe that we knows nothing at death, the parable of Lazurus & the rich man (Luke 16:19) suggests otherwise. So it is possible that we meet our Lord at death & be in a new world. Of course this is just an opinion as noone knows for sure.|`|CEQpDpnPaa	God only knows<br>  <br>  just be glad He hasn't come yet because there is still time for us christians to save unbelievers.

I'm a woman, married to a woman, and have been for 15 years. That does not make me NOT bisexual, anymore than a straight man marrying a blond becomes a blondosexual.

What is true for you, may not be true for everybody.    For instance, I am yet to find a woman that causes me to have a sexual response, that certainly seems to put a hole in your bi by birth argument, at least for me and I would think for many gay men.    It is about who you fall in love with, not about who you have sex with.

Maybe the creationists should design an experiment which would do so.|`|f79a4e31211ec881cdd7df7de85a9262aa	nope.  its still a theory just like cell theory and atomic theory.|`|AA11726497	Evolution is a theory, not a fact.  Evidence support Intelligent design.  Accidents don't create the complex systems we see in our universe.  The earth's complex system, the human body, and all the other creatures that we see in our world.  A rock, cannot produce life, it can only produce smaller rocks, as it deteriorates.  Where and what's the evidence?  I have not seen a cow change into a Dolphin.    Mathematically speaking evolution is impossible.|`|bbb941465ccc4a1ec3a57d5ff0a4b17baa	Not really, it is a scientific theory, always will be, like the theory of universal gravitation.  There's no need to change established nomenclature due to ignorance.|`|CaDrjGoVaa	ALL Science is a Theory!    and i dont beleive in anything until I see 100% CONCRETE proof that it is real!  so therefore i personally dont believe in alot of things scientist say!      i mean i just saw on the news how scientist are saying that obesity is contagious!   R U KIDDING ME?   CMON!  get real!|`|JqzCRh1paa	I hate to Start this,   But There is NO concrete Fact that Evolution is true.....However The Catholic Church acknowledges that if Evolution is the means in which all life has come to be it was God's Will And design to be So... It is in the Catechism of the Catholic Church.    Life.. (A living Organism) did not begin from a non living matter...Micro Biology ANYTHING living had to come from a Living Organism to get it there..    There is NOT ONE SINGLE fossil ever found that shows the exact transformation or even the beginning or the end transformation of ANY life Form Found on Earth....fish to a bird / bird to a horse.....The Missing Link .....well It's Still Missing!|`|3NDYC91Zaa	Why would the Sumerian culture of 6000 years ago leave us story's of how the Anunnaki, space travelers took the creature they found here on earth and by gene splicing and then inter-marrying created modern man?  The old testament thousands of years later ,in Genesis tells how the sons of the gods had children with the earthly daughters.  So this tells us we were enhanced genetically.  There is more in my web site.      http://TheAsender.com|`|AA10482044	Socrates taught that there is nothing that we can be absolutely certain of, to paraphrase: we only know with absolute certainty that we do not know w. absolute certainty.  Fact is, if we are actually butterflies having bad dreams everything is/was a theory.. Electromagnetism and light are considered theories too and we certainly don't know everything about them either but they are no less useful.|`|YZv8Ub3Haa	It is both.    Just like gravity.|`|B7TFX4wUaa	No since the theory of evolution explains the observed fact of evolution.  This has been the case for a century.  I don't see why we have to change terminology because a bunch of denialists are abusing it.|`|wR1XyyrUaa	Theory is a scientific term. Gravity is still a theory.    Even if we had record of every single organism that ever lived and could see the actual differences with each generation, it would still be only a theory.|`|3ba0ab7304ca31210254987d14dbe035aa	Who is "we"?  Huh uh, "we" don't.|`|D9lMg7A2aa	They said that in the 70's too and then all of a sudden gradualism was out and Punctuated Equilibrium was in.     But forget that, cellular biology is the death of evolution. When more people study it, E. will die. It's called selection by Intelligence.|`|qCtbizzPaa	It is a scientific theory and a fact.|`|W0qNkROpaa	No, that's not what theory means.  Evolution is a fact.  The theory of evolution describes how evolution happens.|`|DQjAGWXQaa	The particle "theory" has been proved on countless occasions yet it is still referred to as a theory, but it is still taught in schools. As long as everyone knows do we really need to spend our valuable money buying new textbooks?|`|AA10556726	No, the theory is our explainable of what we know about it, In some ways it reminds us that we need to continue to learn.|`|IhzeHAx4aa	NO EVOLUTION IS A THEORY    SHOUT IT LOUD AND PROUD!!!    There is nothing better in science than to be a theory.  Theory doesn't mean guess|`|332vXA6oaa	Have you found the missing link.? I don't think so. That missing link only exists in your imagination.|`|3GAiVmEAaa	Scientific theories are essentially fact. Gravity is a theory. There is no reason to change words, people just need to understand them better.|`|hYzfzu9yaa	There is a big difference between a theory and a scientific theory.|`|fdb2eb2f4c9344e092dc65cdb24a9c1eaa	It's a theory all right ... It is the 'evidenced' and 'well supported' part some have trouble with. These obvious, logical facts make it clear that natural selection is a far cry from the creative, 'uphill', limitless process imagined by Darwin. Evolutionist theoreticians know this, of course. They know that they must rely on some other process to create the required new information, because the evolution story demands it. 'Once upon a time, it says, there was a world of living creatures with no lungs. Then the information for lungs somehow arose, but feathers were nowhere in the world--later these arose too.' But the bottom line is that natural selection, by itself, is powerless to create. It is a process of 'culling', of choosing between several things which must first be in existence. There is no known natural law through which matter can give rise to information, neither is any physical process or material phenomenon known that can do this.    Edit: Evolution is a fluid, unstable theory. That is, it changes. What evolution stated as scientific fact ten years ago is, today, a verified fallacy. And the observable, provable scientific facts of today may be dismissed during the next decade. The science upon which atheism is anchored is floating. And if the fact of today is the fallacy of tomorrow, then in reality, it is no fact at all. It is upon that anchorless rhetoric that atheists build their claim of reason.|`|LEAx00NEaa	how is there evidence?  u weren't even there so how can u know???

K3PR7Mivaa	No problems here  kjv is   baptizing the verse questioned in your sites, is intentionally being word by "scholars" to sound if it contradicts teaching..of salvation  Salvation is when you accept by faith Christ Jesus as savior at that moment you are baptized into the body of Christ by the indwelling Holy Spirit and placed into the body where it pleases God...  Of course the style is different and people don't like the ending of Mark as it deals with the Resurrected Savior in His same Glorified body...why Mary didn't recognize Him..  Its in my Bible and I believe that a Holy all Powerful God who could create a world, pay for my sins out of love, can also preserve His word and I believe its the King James...|`|D9lMg7A2aa	Simple reason, even a monkey would know. The factuality of the Bible can only be established by a competent religious authority. The question isn't whether the ending is canonical or not, It's who is competent to say whether the ending is canonical or not.     Only Catholics have the pericope about the woman caught in adultery, right ? And forget Mark, Catholics have 7 ( SEVEN !!!! ) more books in their Bible than the Prods. Amazing that you don't know this.    But you are rehashing the old Protestant claim. I am a Catholic I find the self-substantiating Bible thing to be ludicrous.|`|0yPfYLEFaa	The Bible does contain errors. If you knew very much about evangelicals, you would know that there is a very heated debate going on among evangelicals, some of whom (inerrantists) claim that the bible contains no errors--an indefensible position, since it has been proven that there are some 200,000 discrepancies in the manuscripts--and those (the infallibility camp) who claim that the bible contains errors, but that they are insignificant and the bible still unfailing conveys God's revelation.    EDIT:    Of course. I should have expected a thumbs-down for mentioning something you've never heard of before. How dare anyone tell the truth, right? Put your thumbs in your ears and refuse to educate yourself--just like a fundie.|`|9mLjDa5kaa	My Bible has it.     If yours doesn't, try getting a real Bible.     (I said this on purpose, since you're only looking to stir up trouble anyway)|`|eO2rnf7yaa	Check with a Catholic translation.  The Catholic Church has had the same Bible for almost 2000 years.  Peace to you.|`|EBGdlo35aa	Your question can be answered very simply:  is anything in the "long ending" of Mark erroneous?    My bible includes the phrase, "copyright 1985".  Now, I know that is not part of the original bible.  Is it in error?    Just because something was added - admittedly inappropriately - does not mean that it is in error.    Jim, http://www.bible-reviews. com|`|2hpKujaoaa	There's no errors in the Bible.  So what if there was one mistake?  The Bible is perfect.|`|M6VcuiyDaa	Later versions of the bible also have changed words to give christian apologists more scripture to contort.    Isiah 40:22, which many claim says that the earth is round, originally said "...circle of the earth...". Newer versions now say "...sphere of the earth...".       lol at Jill's answer. If you admit something has mistakes, how is it perfect?|`|759ae5ae6e1570ab62326b25526ef339aa	The original manuscripts are without error. Translations have mistakes.|`|tzz0BG8yaa	The bible is full of errors.     http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/j...    Jill-You just pretty much contradicted what you said. lol 10 points for self fail.|`|8IHfytEvaa	The original manuscripts contain no errors.    No translation is perfect.    Bart Ehrman teaches at a state university since no Christian school would hire him.  I would not rely on him for anything.    The King James translators did not know any better.    Today we have more than 24,000 manuscripts of the New Testament and we are very sure we know what the original manuscirpts contained.    Some New Testament manuscripts date within a few years of when Jesus died and rose again.    Some church leaders from the 2nd century told us that Matthew's gospel was written first in Hebrew, but we never found a copy of that until just recently.    We now have Greek and Hebrew manuscripts that are more than 1,000 years older than were availabe to the King James translators and for that reason we know that modern translations such as NIV and NASB and ESV are more accurate than the KJV.    Still from the time of the KJV til now, no point of theology has changed due to these discoveries.    The doctrines taught in questional passage of Scripture, were also taught in other passages of Scriptures where were never in question.    So whether those last verses of Mark are included or not, it does not change a thing.

Of coarse not!  You have to pay for not believing and have to be punished forever!|`|zKOZ8Gafaa	Sorry.  You can't trick God|`|AA11989753	The Bible specifically states that you will have a body in Hell.  It doesn't matter what you do to it here, you are STILL going to be tormented forvever if you die without the forgiveness of your sins by Jesus Christ, and you die in your sins. You will go to Hell, and you will go forever.<br>  <br>  When a person dies, his or her spirit/soul will depart from its earthly body and ascend back to God who gave it: <br>  <br>  Ecclesiastes 12:7 Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was: and the spirit shall return unto God who gave it.)--either accepted or rejected by Christ: <br>  <br>  John 14:6 Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me. <br>  <br>  Many people will try to justify their own means (good-nesses, wonderful works, giving to the needy, etc.) But it’s God’s salvation, and His plan, and one must abide His rules! Many people will plead with Christ on their death-day, but of no avail: <br>  <br>  Matthew 7:22 Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works?<br>  Matthew 7:23 And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me , ye that work iniquity.<br>  <br>  Right now, we have an earthly body that is equipped with six senses: Sight, smell, taste, touch, hearing and audibilizing. We have a nose for smelling, ears for hearing, eyes for seeing, a tongue for eating or talking, a brain for multiple purposes, etc. The new body will be given before or after Christ tells someone to "depart". It really doesn’t matter when one will get this body to live eternally in. What really matters is if you’ll get one!<br>  <br>  The hell bound body will be made to withstand the eternal and unceasing fire of hell. It will also have senses like our earthly body. It will feel pain (a soul/spirit feels no pain). The body will have teeth to gnash (no food), ears to hear, eyes to see, and a tongue for talking. It will have the capacity for emotion. One will remember the people he knew, and the things he did, and will be able to reason and speak. As the torment continues, I’ll bet people will think about their missed opportunities to accept Christ and His salvation; there will be plenty of time!<br>  <br>  Matthew 10:28 And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy BOTH soul and body in hell.<br>  <br>  Mt 5:29 And if thy right eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell.<br>  <br>  Teeth and Emotion: <br>  <br>  Matthew 8:11 And I say unto you, That many (the saved, believers, or just persons) shall come from the east and west, and shall sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven.<br>  Matthew 8:12 But the children of the kingdom (the unjust, lost, unjust unsaved, or unbelievers) shall be cast out into outer darkness: there shall be weeping (emotion) and gnashing of teeth (teeth and emotion) <br>  <br>  Eyes, Emotion, the Feeling of Pain, Talking, Memory or Remembrance, Reasoning, and Hearing:<br>  <br>  Luke 16:23 And in hell he lift up his eyes , being in torments, and seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus (remembrance) <br>  in his bosom.<br>  Luke 16:24 And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me (emotion), and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame. <br>  The Feeling of Pain and Talking <br>  Luke 16:25 But Abraham said, Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things: but now he is comforted, and thou art tormented.<br>  Luke 16:26 And beside all this, between us and you there is a great gulf fixed: so that they which would pass from hence to you cannot; neither can they pass to us, that would come from thence.<br>  Luke 16:27 Then he said, I pray thee therefore, father, that thou wouldest send him to my father's house:<br>  Luke 16:28 For I have five brethren; that he may testify unto them, lest they also come into this place of torment. <br>  Reasoning <br>  Luke 16:29 Abraham saith unto him, They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them. <br>  <br>  Hearing:<br>  <br>  Luke 16:30 And he said, Nay, father Abraham: but if one went unto them from the dead, they will repent. <br>  Reasoning <br>  Luke 16:31 And he said unto him, If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded, though one rose from the dead. <br>  <br>  Conclusion <br>  <br>  God will give a hell bound soul a fireproof body having fireproof fluids, for there’s nothing He can’t do! I never gave this subject any thought before, but it’s clear from these verses--He will. Are you going to get this kind of body when you die? The subject is a very serious one, and your eternal destination is determined by your choice! Will you believe the Gospel of Christ or not? Will you ask Him for forgiveness? Or are you going to reach Him your own way--(goodness--how much? Good works--how many?) ONLY by faith you’ll enter into heaven! <br>  <br>  Hebrews 11:6 But without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him. <br>  <br>  John 10:1 Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that entereth not by the door into the sheepfold, but climbeth up some other way, the same is a thief and a robber.<br>  <br>  Hebrews 10:31 It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God. <br>  <br>  Know how to obtain eternal life, and never get a new hell bound body.|`|2059629ba703ea51b813a449b0cb4431aa	If you continue to spread that around, then NO ONE will end up going to hell, and then you'd be ruining a lot of fun for a lot of Christians.|`|JREs9K0Gaa	I don't remember ever reading that in my Bible.|`|BhEsZMG8aa	The Bible does not say that.|`|hqroE4ARaa	Hell doesn't exist, so how the hell could anyone go there?

I was born over 64 years ago. I went to school, infant,junior and senior in the same area. Memories there, the teacher was out and I asked my classmate how to work a maths problem. The Teach. came in and asked who had been talking. Mary stood a little before me and was excused. I was called out, bent over the desk and caned on the upper leg. I finished school 2nd in 4th year. So much for early days.  I had wanted to join the Queen Alexandra's Army nursing Service but there were no vacancies so I applied for an office job and the Supervisor, MISS ARGYLE asked among other things what my interests were. I gave classical music, Bagpipe playing, Gilbert and Sullivan, Scots and Irish folk and gardening. I was put alongside Gwenneth B as MISS A thought we would get on well together.  Neither of us smoked or drank and as the office lunch room was usually hazy with tobacco. we would go outside to eat.   We began going out to films and the theatre and concerts and would exchange a kiss at the end of an evening. This became serious and one night Gwen said that we had better discuss if we should continue in this way.We thought we should go on and see what eventuated.   We did gardening at each others houses at the weekend and I was :"welcomed" to long religious talks, one topic of which was that Methodism was not really Christian but a device of Satan to snare the unwary.   About three years after meeting, we decided to purchase a house and live together.  We decided to tell our Parents. When I told Mother( Father had pased away) she said. "You know I always wanted grandchildren but Gwenneth is a lovely person. Love her and be kind to her."  When our house was ready fof final fittings we had a housewarming. Mother, my Brother and his Fiance came. I never learned what Gwen's parents said when she first "came out" to them but the answer to our invitation to the house party was so shocking I burn to think of it even now.  After the meal, Gwen and I declared our love and promised to care, protect and trust. I still have a coy of our vows Toasts were drunk and we were as happy as if we had been united in the High Church of St Giles in Edinburgh.  Rose P..|`|hIdzQoquaa	But I'm not actually gay.

I had kissed guys before (and have done since), but have never felt the way I feel when kissing a woman, whilst kissing a man.     I didn't go to a gay club until I was about 22! When I did, I instantly felt that I belonged. I am proud to be part of the gay scene in the city I live in. It makes me feel part of something and makes me realise that I should be incredibly happy to be who I am!    For me at least, having even just a vague sense of a gay community has helped me become happy with myself and my sexuality.|`|33b8882eea02cff57b6f2ace9959c946aa	. . . .. . . . . . . . . . . ,.-. . . . . . . . . .``~.,  . . . . . . . .. . . . . .,.-. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .-.,  . . . . .. . . . . . ..,/. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . :,  . . . . . . . .. .,?. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\,  . . . . . . . . . /. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ,}  . . . . . . . . ./. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ,:`^`.}  . . . . . . . ./. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ,:. . . ./  . . . . . . .?. . . __. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . :`. . . ./  . . . . . . . /__.(. . .~-,_. . . . . . . . . . . . . . ,:`. . . .. ./  . . . . . . /(_. . ~,_. . . ..~,_. . . . . . . . . .,:`. . . . _/  . . . .. .{.._$;_. . .=,_. . . .-,_. . . ,.-~-,}, .~; /. .. .}  . . .. . .((. . .*~_. . . .=-._. . .;,,./`. . / . . . ./. .. ../  . . . .. . .\`~,. . ..~.,. . . . . . . . . ..`. . .}. . . . . . ../  . . . . . .(. ..`=-,,. . . .`. . . . . . . . . . . ..(. . . ;_,,-  . . . . . ../.`~,. . ..`-.. . . . . . . . . . . . . . ..\. . /\  . . . . . . \`~.*-,. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ..|,./.....\,__  ,,_. . . . . }.>-._\. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .|. . . . . . ..`=~-,  . .. `=~-,_\_. . . `\,. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\  . . . . . . . . . .`=~-,,.\,. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . `:,, . . . . . . . . . . . . . `\. . . . . . ..__  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .`=-,. . . . . . . . . .,%`>--==``  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . _\. . . . . ._,-%. . . ..`\.
i6Mi8uWIaa	I've got to agree with you.    And I am a pro-lifer.    First off, less than 1% of all abortions are due to rape or incest.     Second, women who have been raped and have abortions later report having felt violated all over again.    Third, if you found out that your biological father raped your mother, would you suddenly think you no longer  had a right to live? No, you wouldn't. Now think if you were a fetus and you knew that you were an unborn child and knew that you were a product of rape (I know this isn't actually possible, but I'm playing Devil's Advocate here). You still don't think you no longer have a right to live, do you? You still want to be born, don't you?     The "rape" case, the so called "hard cases," are all based on logical fallacies.|`|ce26AOVzaa	I am not saying she has to keep the kid or kill her. it is not her kid in her eyes. To have a child it has to be man and woman. In that case it is the mans child and not hers. If she wants to keep the kid, go ahead. I just do not think God will judge her of murder. Now with the others they willingly mate knowing of possible creation of life. There is a difference. One kid they both made and now are cursed with a kid or not. The other it is not her kid at all. But a constant evil in her, and she will always remember the rape. I do not think the woman should have to carry the pain. BUT in defence of how I believe holy spirit speaks to me. He says all should have to live and their is no choice. In a way you all rape each other anyway. The old testement woman had to be with the man that raped her if he joined in her, all he had to do was pay for her....like a whore. Shows God hates man and woman again with the eyes because he kinda in a way takes the side of a rapest. Not much of a judgement to have to pay for her.... If you are all raping eachother in the eyes and thoughts anyway, what difference is it unto the Lord? So  all that are born any that you kill child and whatever is murder......but "I" believe a woman should not have to take the pain if the kid is not her's anway.I will have to seek my heart before the Lord and see if it is of him.  BUT I think I have to walk with what my heart says on it and say pro life to all even rape. So I will correct myself from my last letter. But again I will seek about it, thanks for giving me something to seek about.     thanks, I feel as if I am speaking a lie to you in my last answer and a bit in this one. I wonder if I am right or wrong about how God see it? i fell wrong with my heart, and right about pro life in all things. Woman do not have a right to choice life or death.

Is that what you want? Apparently.    Until all pro-lifers actually do care about the orphans that were abandoned because they were born into a world without love, and EVERY SINGLE child gets adopted, that's when I'll become pro-life. Because being "pro-life" ALSO extends to the children once they're born, not just when they're in the womb.|`|5tMCDu8gaa	Well, according to the Bible, a child isn't even a human life until it's a month old, let alone in the womb.    So they really don't have a leg to stand on with that kind of BS. Especially considering how many people they have tortured and killed over the years for their god.|`|Ze2MlcTUaa	WHO GETS TO CHOSE...FEMINISTS....

Rape is horrific, but to have an abortion is to add suffering on top of suffering.
mFy3M8mVaa	Have you been reading into Shamanism?  Yes, I believe that's a possibility.|`|5tMCDu8gaa	I think every child does at some point. I hit 104 once or twice in my childhood. I have a low average body temp, so that's like 105 to most other people.    The only things I ever took antibiotics for as a kid were strep and ear infections. The rest of the time my parents gave me a Tylenol and let me sweat it out, which is the right approach. Unless the high fever persists for more than a day, it's not dangerous. Just part of a child's immune system getting used to the world.    I never hallucinated strongly - my mind is very resistant to it. But I did get paranoid and things seemed very big and sort of rippled.    Hallucinations are nothing more than misfirings in the brain. You can take from it what you like, but it's nothing more than delirium.|`|L70U9Pevaa	nope never    hi personal informant|`|3dcc4e932de9c8b89aae565f1ad8f688aa	I did, but seldomly.  No, I didn't take any antibiotics. Maybe Tylenol, Ibuprofen, etc...    That's a very interesting question. I've never even thought about that. But maybe that's because I've only hallucinated a couple of times.|`|oSME7B23aa	Yes. My parents had to stick a thermometer up my rectum. It was good.|`|AA11430900	I didn't take antibiotics and I don't remember hallucinating (perhaps I did) but I do remember I'd forgot if I did things.    One time when I was 13 I spiked a very high fever and I woke up as my father had just come home from work (4 am) and I told him I didn't feel good and was going to take some tylenol.  I remember popping the bottle open and the next thing I remember is asking my dad if I took the pills.  After I asked him that he got my mother up and they made me lay on a block of ice while they put rubbing alcohol on my arms and legs.  I remember asking to get off the ice because I felt like my stomach was freezing and that's about all I remember of the episode.|`|RedEGIfZaa	When I was a child, I had a fever.    My hands felt just like two balloons.|`|MJYqMm05aa	Certain types of hallucinogens seem to demonstrably and repeatedly produce the same hallucinations in subjects separated by culture and experience.  Users of peyote often report contact with similar seeming cactoid entities, and users of Salvia Divinorum talk of hallucinations of a "Lady", while ketamine and DMT often produce hallucinations involving entities known as Machine elves.    Whether these are "genuine" experiences of objective entities is impossible to say, since their very existence defies the concept of what existence means.      Even if they are merely some kind of expression of the group-mind, or the jungian archetype, or direct experience of entities beyond our ken, shared hallucinations are an important and essential part of human evolution.|`|S0ueSuUnaa	Hey there i'm 19 years old and for as long as i can remember ever year i get a high fever. One year i had vivid hallucination that was also like a lucid dream    A guy came up to my door and i opened it and showed him to the kitchen. I went through to the living room to sit down. The guy came through with a knife.Just as the knife was about to go through my chest i woke up with a knife lying beside me.     Thats the worst hallucination i've had but others include flying, running for ages (ending up somewhere other than my room if i don't turn round and go home) and sometimes thinking i'm in a computer game situation.|`|Eos7bQKRaa	yeah me once i hallucinated that i was sleeping with millions of cone shaped clown hats who were also sick like me and every time i moved around on my bed they would all tumble and roll around all over me.|`|nw0fqXj9aa	I was born with an illness that required a spinal tap after birth. That was about as sick as I have ever been. Aside from strep throat once or twice of course.      After having done enough LSD to see permanent fractals behind my eyes, I am convinced there is no other dimension, only states of mind.|`|IhzeHAx4aa	no hallucinations happen when your brain begins to fail and can no longer process input properly...it has nothing to do with dimensions.  please seek an education and stop believing in nonsense.|`|jDmoGKU5aa	Yep, I had pneumonia twice. I used to take Italian lessons but I could never speak it very well. When I had pneumonia and my temperature rose, my mom later told me that I had spoken perfect Italian. Oh, and I took antibiotics both times. Anyways, that is why people do drugs like LSD -- to tap into the other dimensions of the brain.

I worked for Oxfam (UK charity)and finding they were unethical I left.... as any morally responsible person of any religion would do...........|`|0yPfYLEFaa	I don't really think that counts as sin. Now, if you allowed someone to get beaten up and left for dead in the street because you were afraid to act, THAT might be sinful. But God always forgives. He understands fear, along with all other motives to sin. He loves you. He will not fail to be merciful if you ask.|`|rFFYCmOGaa	Hard to say for others, particularly in a bad economy so I'm hesitant about giving advice to others because what has worked for me might not be the best for others.    I work for myself these days but back when I was in the corporate rat race I left several not so bad paying jobs due to similar reasons and in almost every instance was able to land a better opportunities elsewhere.    So it really depends on the overall sate of the economy and your personal financial state.      I don't see how ideas about "god" have anything to do with it in the least.|`|IbtQ5IKNaa	If they ignore their heart then their brain gets too big.

But, here is what I think.<br>  Unfortunately, the outfits, the way men "gawk" at cheerleaders, it is not the greatest thing ever, I'll be honest..<br>  BUT, in the end you/your friend has to be true to your own heart.

IVy35SE2aa	It is not uncommon to see girls dancing together and even, at times,<br>  caressing.  I think you can have that kind of an open relationship<br>  just as friends.  And it is alright that she knows you love her but<br>  that does not have to threaten her with sexual love.  Love is love,<br>  but sex is something else most of the time.  It sounds like she<br>  has similar feelings for you, but does not know how to express<br>  them.<br>  Don't come out to her sexually, but maybe that will be the natural<br>  outcome of relationship.|`|2TXCaLWraa	well maybe she is bi/gay in denial...nd doesn't want anybody 2 find out so by saying derogatory things about homosexuals she things no one would suspect of her being gay...next time u guys are talking about homosexuality just tell her ur bi...she might or might not understand u, but if u guys r really good friends she will come around with time...<br>  <br>  =D<br>  <br>  Good luck<br>  *Hugs*|`|c8597904b477399309702aaa485592abaa	If she is your friend be truthful with her.

So for someone to say "it shouldn't be about the crowns", is grossly inaccurate.  Jesus said to go for as many crowns as we can, the crowns are so very worth having!  :)|`|KgsfMJWTaa	Romans 8:17 says we can become joint-heirs or co-heirs with Christ.    Define it how you will.    http://bible.cc/romans/8-17.htm|`|EAix5Av9aa	The answer is in the Book Of Revelation as the elders cast crowns before God's throne/ They are for suffering of various kinds that many face in life. The 24 elders set an example of praise and worship in Revelation that gives God the glory for all the efforts we accomplish through.  Worthy is the Lamb.   In Revelations 4:4And round about the throne were four and twenty seats(24): and upon the seats I saw four four and twenty elders(24) sitting, clothed in white raiment; and they had on their heads crowns of gold.And out of the throne proceeded lightnings and thunderings and voices; and there were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne,which are the seven Spirits of God. In   verse 4:10 the elders worshipped god and cast the crowns at God's feet.   Other passages of the bible tell exactly why the crowns will be given to each suffering believer.    These are in effect some rewards that some fail to understand.|`|zkovxRseaa	i received a few dental crowns, is that good?|`|N8wutNoLaa	it shouldn't be about the crowns.
2JvM6hucaa	Taters, I suspect most of us know the gist of the rules.  But we have learned through our lives and, as long as we are not doing something dangerous, we sometimes resort to common sense first. Rules are good, they help us keep in line as long as they are not too rigid.  I think some people get so caught up in the "rules", that they become unbending and loose touch with the reality around them.  Kinda sad, huh?  Remember, it's the young person that knows the rules but the old person that knows the exceptions.|`|bf4cc388616ba9cb48357f54373c609eaa	I have learned that if you mind your manners and behave and are decent and respectful of others then the details usually take care of themselves. I admire and am intrigued with the person that can bend some rules and still maintain the respect and friendship of everyone. Sometimes the bending of a rule for effect and impression entertains. Besides, Texans have license to tease and embellish upon and  stretch the blanket a bit.|`|GdvzZRFMaa	When I started posting on Seniors I have always tried to be caring participate as much as possible, most member seem to do the same.<br>  <br>  being reminding be a member all the time about the guidelines is getting old fast.

3WYcPsm4aa	Keara,<br>  Please be aware that the ELCA is falling so far away from Lutheran teachings that it is getting hard to classify them as Lutheran anymore.  Not that all congregations are as liberal and un-Lutheran as others, but there is a trend.  Yes, they are accepting of homosexuality and yes, they do ordain women. <br>  Also, you may not find that traditional liturgy and feel of Mass in the ELCA.  Some have gone to contemporary services only, but most will have a traditional service and a contemporary service.  Do try attending some of their worship services.....that's the only way you'll know if you like it or not!<br>  And please do a comparison of LCMS and ELCA.  <br>  <br>  Whatever you decide, blessings on your journey!|`|llDXCv4raa	Episcopal is accepting as well, and has traditional services similar to Catholic churches.

Get those people to voluntarily put their names on a mailing list.  Email them with updates of information, and if you need researchers, ask them for help finding information.  Add that info to your website.    3.  Organize your group to contact local (in their area) leaders, such as politicians, church leaders, etc.  You don't want many helpers contacting the same people over and over by accident, so you have to use your website to assign areas to each volunteer.  You also have to make sure that your volunteers are working and not goofing off.  If they are not performing, put a different volunteer in their place.    4.  Be flamboyant.  (For example:  The Red Hat Society is a group of women who wears red hats, and they do nothing else.  The society is a social network that allows housewives to socialize).  You need to get all members to wear recognizable clothing (this is how Mother Teresa did it, with her blue striped headpiece, and this is how the Salvation Army did it).  People will eventually ask who you are, and they will want to know what you stand for.  When they realize that it is for a good cause, they will join.    Notice that my suggestions would cost you nothing (except a bright colored hat).    Good luck.|`|279ac5587c0a982b23b03bde3f0bbf91aa	Sure she accepted Jesus before she died   She was brain dead!

She was taken off life support. She died a natural death. It is unethical and a crime for doctors to choke a patient  to death. I am sure you information was not from a reliable source but someone who did not agree with a family or medical decision. Murder is murder. The doctors would have been arrested if they tried to choke her to death.|`|UyDkYaXuaa	Yea sure. She wanted to die.

Try telling people about it, and make sure they understand what REALLY happened to Terry.|`|Fpi8im9taa	By cutting off her life support? Have you ever seen anyone that was in a vegetative state in real life?    I have. One of my closest friends in high school was in a vegetative state for weeks due to heart-brain incompatibility.

She was spared.|`|baaf30673b204103b269ddf718be2c5caa	How can she possibly have accepted Jesus? She was brain-dead.

Thank you for writing this. Many people do remember and pray for her and others in her condition in hospitals all over the world.|`|AA12270622	By doing something more important.  People need to get over the fact that meat sometimes has a face.  Terri Schiavo wasn't murdered.  She died of a heart attack.  She was pronounced brain dead shortly after she had it.  If her parents had been ever so slightly more rational, the matter would have ended there because she signed a flipping DNR order saying if she was ever stuck in that state, her body should be left to go naturally.    That's exactly what should have happened here, because it cost everyone a bunch of time, money, and pain to keep a husk alive because it had a face still attached to it.  When they autopsied her skull, do you know what they found where a cerebrum should have been?    Empty space.    Not only was she brain dead, the thing had rotted away and atrophied inside her skull.  All that was left was a body and reflex action, and there was no chance of her recovering from that.  None.  If the woman had a soul, it left her years ago.    ADDENDUM:    I would like to take this opportunity to respond to your email telling me to burn in Hell...    Awww, that's so sweet of you.  =)|`|iHDYncuXaa	Don't listen to these nasty replies. It is good to keep thinking of the ones lost to such tragic situations. Yes, Terri was murdered. Denying food was the cause of her death. And her husband denied food for her. Her own familiy tried to stop this. But her husband wanted her gone so that he could get on with his life. Terri is in a much better place today. And unless the husband repents and receives Jesus as his Lord and Savior, he will never be reunited with her again. God Bless!|`|P91FugsAaa	Oh good grief... go look at the MRI pics of her head.  70% of her brain had liquefied.

Anything else, is really not our business...or yours for that matter.|`|gwqS6xHpaa	I will remember as a triumph of the separation of  church and state.  And, proof that marriage is a good thing.  It should be up to a spouse, not the state or false religious zealots, who decide when someone is artificially kept alive.|`|jW0VqZcOaa	I will remember poor Terri by having a bowl of vegetable stew... and then choking the life out of something.

But taking them off is murder?    What the ****?|`|N0WF1CuGaa	Open your mind up. She wasn't murdered her husband fought hard to keep her alive. She was in a vegetative state she had no mental thoughts. She was physically alive but mentally dead. They put her out of her misery.|`|ea9GINjKaa	She accepted jesus while brain dead?

ojHFFpcBaa	Therefore means " For that or this reason".

I'd be suspect of any who claim to be, as Yahoo Answers is NOT designed for experts, but as a way to get a bunch of QUICK answers from the general public.<br>  <br>  However, as a NON-theologian,  I'll render my opinion..<br>  <br>  Define Therefore:<br>  used to introduce a logical conclusion from that fact or reason or as a result;  It is the relation that holds between a set of sentences (or propositions) and a sentence (proposition) when the former "entails" the latter. ...; For that or this reason;  because or for that reason. Compel: 1. To force, drive, or constrain<br>  <br>  Next let's start with the verses itself..<br>  Matt 28:17-20<br>  17When they saw him, they worshiped him; but some doubted. 18Then Jesus came to them and said, "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. 19Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in[a] the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, 20and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age."<br>  <br>  To ME,  therefore, is a logical conclusion of the previous point. So Jesus says: "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me."  [ SO, based on this fact,] "go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, 20and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you."  <br>   And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age."<br>  <br>  The significance of the Therefore is that by linking those 2, he DELEGATES some of his authority to the Apostles, giving them authority, thru him. They are commissioned to go forth and TEACH what he has commanded them to do, previously,  based on HIS authority over Heaven and Earth. <br>  <br>  The "THEREFORE" is where the transmission of authority is delegated SPECIFICALLY to the apostles. '<br>  <br>  Without it, the apostles would NOT have authority to forgive sins, appoint successors, transubstantiate wine and bread into the body and blood of Christ. <br>  THIS verse, along with the verses where Jesus "breathes" upon them and says "recieve the holy spirit" are the 2 points where Jesus delegates his authority to THEM.|`|759ae5ae6e1570ab62326b25526ef339aa	It means "this is the consequence" or "because of 18, 19 follows"

WjRqYf6naa	It is supposed to be a two-way street. A husband and wife should submit to one another insofar as is possible. Having said that, I will note that while some women, not just Christian women, are naturally meek and submissive, others are most assuredly not.    Ephesians 5:33 ESV  However, let each one of you love his wife as himself, and let the wife see that she respects her husband.      Loving your wife as yourself kind of takes the edge off of any tendencies  toward domination.|`|POxgn8LEaa	Colossians 3:18-19 (New International Version)     18Wives, submit to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord.    19Husbands, love your wives and do not be harsh with them.    Ephesians 5:23-25 (New International Version)  23For the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head of the church, his body, of which he is the Savior. 24Now as the church submits to Christ, so also wives should submit to their husbands in everything.      25Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her      Ephesians 5:21-23 (New International Version)     21Submit to one another out of reverence for Christ.    Wives and Husbands    22Wives, submit to your husbands as to the Lord. 23For the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head of the church, his body, of which he is the Savior.    As you can see it doesn't give you free reign and even says for you to submit to your wife as well|`|2Gl70bifaa	no. they are loyal and true. marriage is a cooperative union.|`|CWk5CI8caa	Think about it, they're christians.

But the description that you provided is the way that they are supposed to be.|`|23eGz7kcaa	Every time wives are told to be submissive to their husbands in the Bible, the husbands are instructed to love them like Jesus loved the church. Wives are supposed to be like the church in relation to God. So if women are not living up to the standards, it has to do with the fact that the men are not doing their part. So be a good man, you'll get a good wife.|`|SfJqgZDkaa	My Christian wife says they seem to exist in your imagination and the imagination of many Atheists who troll with antiquated stereotypes they pulled from the ideals of Pat Robertson - but she's feisty.    Or you could just get someone who idealizes Twilight. You know that Bella does everything for that Edward fellow including giving up all her dreams and hopes for his love.     So maybe look for the fictional woman or woman with incredibly low self-esteem? Or try India or Saudi Arabia where women are essentially second class citizens with little voice or power because the law's on your side of having an obedient wife.     Maybe it's just me, but I expect most adults to acknowledge that all organized religions have their share of oppressive hateful folk and especially from a "proud" atheist who supposedly shirks the "limitations" of religious belief.     Even jokingly, it's depressing that one would even attempt to assert that the oppression of women is limited, lead by, or committed by a single religious affiliation.

They come from a planet called Merania... And fairies are living on a planet right beside Merania called Zavia..  ZAVIA and Merania are in a complete different galaxie then ours and they are the only planets consisting of life in their galaxie...  Zavia is 50 percent made of water 25 percent made of magical forests and 25 percent made of just plain old grass and hills and what no, Zavia holds the life of elfs, fairies, some mer (most mer have now moved to Merania), giants, and pretty much anything that is magical... but nothing evil of course.  MERANIA is 93 percent water and 7 percent rock... Merania holds life to mer and nothing more.. mer have anual meetings on the rocks in Merania.. although some mer decided to stay on our home planet in Zavia... but yah right I would stay there!!   The prince of Merania and all mer (me) and the princess of everything on Zavia (one of my VERY good friends) can transport from Zavia and Merania to this world or any other world and take that worlds inhabitants form..

I was 12 years old  (1957) when we got a television and my favorite show was Wagon Train and then later Lawman.  My dad and I were great western fans, so anything with cowboys in was always watched.|`|JTu1cLkYaa	1956, I remember I loved the Lone Ranger and later Zorro. And the family always watched Arthur Godfrey and Red Skelton.

I watched the shows by way of a mirror.|`|rJJhMQ37aa	I was in seventh grade when I was told that my (grown up) cousin was bringing us a TV set.  So excited, I couldn't pay attention in school that day.  When I got home, there it was. Brown, table model, with kind of a rounded top.  WOW!  I think the screen might have been 15 inches or so, black and white.<br>  <br>  There was only one channel, so the choice was watch it or don't.  It was in our dining room.  My aunt sat in the rocker, I sat at the table, my little brother sprawled on the floor.  We watched everything that we could.  My aunt adored wrestling, and the Eddy Arnold Show.  We had to be quiet as mice while she watched Eddy.<br>  <br>  If I remember right, my favorite show was Ben Casey.|`|AA10045620	I am thinking it was around 1956.

I vaguely remember seeing wrestling matches with Gorgeous George.  But I was a wee child and don't remember much else. My sister got to be on Howdy Dowdy show.  If you are in my area you would remember Pick Temple.|`|bf4cc388616ba9cb48357f54373c609eaa	We got our first television circa 1954. I believe many of my friends already had one in their home when we got ours. The manufacture was Raytheon and Dad chose that brand because it was the same company that manufactured the fathometer and radio-telephone on a commercial  fishing boat that he owned.  The captain on the boat recommended Raytheon equipment so I suppose Dad figured that their televisions would be good ones also.<br>   I remember the Ed Sullivan Show was our favorite.

But it also might very well be a trick. Maybe someone else sent that to you in his email for fun. Or maybe it was him himself for a joke. Just be careful and kind.|`|ssV4NDUVaa	Something like, "Thanks. I'm flattered, but i'm straight." Be friendly and you'd want to set some boundaries.
mGfCY4Ytaa	the guys are probably trying to exert their masculinity by hitting on you. a lot of straight guys have the misconception that lesbians need "fixing" like they think you just need a good experience in bed with a guy and then you will be straight. Also, a lot of straight men are really hung up on lesbian sex. they think its a threesome waiting to happen. so they might think that they can just jump right on into bed with you and another girl.<br>  <br>  maybe its just curiosity. is it possible they they just want to be your friend so they can know more about homosexuals? ive found that a lot of straight guys that want to hang out with me have a lot of questions because they've never known gay people before and they are interested because its something new to them. in this case its not that they want to have sex with you, they just want you to be like one of the guys.

Usama Bin Laden himself denied responsibility for those attacks in a fax to the news agency...which was ignored by many channels but not the AP, BBC, JUS. Anyways, there is a lot of misrepresentation about what they do. What you hear about the majority of the time is the media amplifying several isolated incidents out of proportion. They are a military foe that cannot be defeated because they are a guerilla army. If they feel pressure, they will turn to the ground. As they are a guerilla army, they cannot function without the support of the people. The fact that they enjoy an abundant amount of supplies, food, shelter, and military grade weaponary from 'unexplained sources' and the fact that they can operate with impunity in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Pakistan clearly shows grassroot support for the movement.

When you are in a country who's LAWS are Sharia then the laws of that country apply to anyone in it. In Sudan if you break the law of the country Muslim or not it applies to you. If I break the law in a Non Muslim country the law still applies to me as a Muslim correct?

In Sharia, if you convert religions then you are killed.  You are also killed if you are gay.  This goes against personal liberty as we believe to be best in the west.

QZfpGWPIaa	You have more ahead of you at a younger age. You still need to develop skills. Why would you risk getting STDs at a young age. Drugs just mess with your head and are often deadly. Why should a teenager add to the stresses they may already have. The point is, that stuff messes up the success you could have by not doing it. Don't take your chances.|`|qJkRPhIKaa	because.

I am also good with veggies so pretty much i would be eating plants and grass, will make a hole in the ground to find those worms and insects until I get someone to help me. Some flowers also are eatable, usually if you see an animal eating it, then you can eat it too. (like grass for example or worms) Also, if you make a deep hole you can find water and some plants have water inside them..      I think i can do a month or two, who knows maybe more.    I am from Peru and have lived in the Amazon. I have had friends from the Chipibo tribe and they told me and showed me about this.

baksmHQRaa	You could be bisexual. I'm going to agree with a lot of the other answers and say be honest with him. If you feel like you like him and its worth a shot,then go for it,take it slow and who knows? Maybe he'll even be "the one" =P But seriously, if you are going to pursue things with him it is important to be honest with him. One, because he has a right to know if your unsure, and two, it is always easier to take this journey with someone, and he'll probably take things slower and try and make sure your ok with everything that happens.    Any way, I hope that even if you don't end up in a relationship together, you two still have a great friendship, as you seem to be nice guys (as far as I can tell from a single post on Yahoo =P)|`|QYy0vU4maa	At least he is honest!

You can't know if you're gay until you try things, so why don't you tell him you don't know about things, and if you figure out you're not that's fine, and if you are then that's fine to. Just take things slow, and figure it out. If he's really as great as you say he'll back off if you figure out you aren't, you know.|`|Nsgh1XzLaa	uhm if your straight then it is immposible to "turn" gay because your orientation is straight ( if your sure ur straight).  so if you were straight you wouldnt be even asking this question (knowing that your an adult).    feeling repect for a person is another thing and that is called a friend.  but you said you got to turned on, so are u still confused about ur orientation (you should know by now since your an adult)?    hoped i helped    ur friend roger|`|nQW1MSMpaa	Dude, just take things one day at a time. You don't have to label yourself or anything else. So you got a bit turned by another guy who shares some interests the same as you. No biggie.    Just let things progress in their own time. If something happens, it happens, if it doesn't, it doesn't. You seem to be open to the possibility so you might be just a little bi-curious, and that's ok.    If something does happen, just play safe and don't judge it, it is what it is.|`|wRfqMK89aa	follow your heart..... hahaha  cheeeeeesey!!!
ew7nQKXSaa	Webcam will definitely be better, because he will at least be able to see you.<br>  <br>  First, find out what he already knows. Do what I call a "Tense guantlet." Start by asking him things that require answers in the Simple Present tense:<br>  <br>  Do you like Cheese? He should say "Yes I do."<br>  <br>  Then check his understanding of modals.<br>  <br>  "Can you dance?"<br>  <br>  "Will you study English with me?"<br>  <br>  "When should we study?"<br>  <br>  Then move to the Simple Past:<br>  <br>  "What did you do last night?"<br>  <br>  Progress through the tenses.

Bb6fQtl0aa	No there is no evidence for this act.<br>  <br>  The proof against this act of saying a communal "takbir" out loud is the following hadeeth in Saheeh al-Bukhari:<br>  <br>  Narrated Abu Musa:<br>  We were in the company of the Prophet, peace be upon him, on a journey, and whenever we ascended a high place, we used to say Takbir (in a loud voice). <br>  <br>  The Prophet, peace be upon him, said, "O people! Be kind to yourselves, for you are not calling upon a deaf or an absent one, but You are calling an All-Hearer, and an All-Seer." <br>  <br>  Then he came to me as I was reciting silently, "La haul a wala quwwata illa bil-lah." He said, "O 'Abdullah bin Qais! Say: La haul a walaquwata illa bil-lah, for it is one of the treasures of Paradise." Or he said, "Shall I tell you a word which is one of the treasures of Paradise? It is: La haul a wala quwwata illa bil-lah."<br>  (Saheeh al-Bukhari: Book of Invocations)<br>  <br>  Also, if I may add....<br>  When a particular act is accused of being an innovation, the "burden of proof" is upon the one accused, NOT the accuser. As all claimed acts of worship are haraam until there is an authentic proof (understood in proper context) giving permission for that act has been given.<br>  <br>  So in this situation, the more appropriate question is "What is the evidence for this act of saying 'takbir! Allaahu Akbar!' ?" instead of asking what is the "proof" against saying it.|`|Wgsl0hVLaa	<a href="http://www.qss.org/articles/celebrations/4-5.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.qss.org/articles/celebrations...</a>|`|757ce30489e7f56556925d17f1f49f76aa	I heard that as well. That people shouldn't do it. I'm not 100% sure on this so don't take my word for it, but I heard when people did it in the prophet's (pbuh) time he told them not ahh I can't remember why. I should probably try and search for it. <br>  <br>  But I'm not sure, I don't think there is evidence.

ade88a86096da6caf982d633e21cd939aa	The bread and wine of the Eucharist (Communion Service) are reminiscent of the bread and the wine that the Lord and the Apostles shared at the Last Supper. They commemorate His broken body and shed blood, broken and shed for the sin(s) of mankind.|`|atfKCzmPaa	Mass<br>  Definition: As stated by the Sacred Congregation of Rites of the Roman Catholic Church, the Mass is “—A sacrifice in which the Sacrifice of the Cross is perpetuated; —A memorial of the death and resurrection of the Lord, who said ‘do this in memory of me’ (Luke 22:19); —A sacred banquet in which, through the communion of the Body and Blood of the Lord, the People of God share the benefits of the Paschal Sacrifice, renew the New Covenant which God has made with man once for all through the Blood of Christ, and in faith and hope foreshadow and anticipate the eschatological banquet in the kingdom of the Father, proclaiming the Lord’s death ‘till His coming.’” (Eucharisticum Mysterium, May 25, 1967) It is the Catholic Church’s way of doing what they understand that Jesus Christ did at the Last Supper.<br>  Are the bread and the wine actually changed into Christ’s body and blood?<br>  In a “Solemn Profession of Faith” on June 30, 1968, Pope Paul VI declared: “We believe that as the bread and wine consecrated by the Lord at the Last Supper were changed into His Body and His Blood which were to be offered for us on the cross, so the bread and wine consecrated by the priest are changed into the Body and Blood of Christ enthroned gloriously in heaven, and We believe that the mysterious presence of the Lord, under the appearance of those elements which seem to our senses the same after as before the Consecration, is a true, real and substantial presence. .?.?. This mysterious change is very appropriately called by the Church transubstantiation.” (Official Catholic Teachings—Christ Our Lord, Wilmington,?N.C.; 1978, Amanda G.?Watlington, p.?411) Do the Holy Scriptures agree with that belief?<br>  What did Jesus mean when he said, “This is my body,” “This is my blood”?<br>  Matt. 26:26-29, JB: “Now as they were eating, Jesus took some bread, and when he had said the blessing he broke it and gave it to the disciples. ‘Take it and eat;’ he said ‘this is my body.’ Then he took a cup, and when he had returned thanks he gave it to them. ‘Drink all of you from this,’ he said ‘for this is my blood, the blood of the covenant, which is to be poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins. From now on, I tell you, I shall not drink wine until the day I drink the new wine with you in the kingdom of my Father.’”<br>  Regarding the expressions “this is my body” and “this is my blood,” the following is noteworthy: Mo reads, “it means my body,” “this means my blood.” (Italics added.) NW reads similarly. LEF renders the expressions, “this represents my body,” “this represents my blood.” (Italics added.) These renderings agree with what is stated in the context, in verse 29, in various Catholic editions. Kx reads: “I shall not drink of this fruit of the vine again, until I drink it with you, new wine, in the kingdom of my Father.” (Italics added.) CC, NAB, Dy also show Jesus referring to what was in the cup as being “this fruit of the vine,” and that was after Jesus had said, “This is my blood.”<br>  Consider the expressions “this is my body” and “this is my blood” in the light of other vivid language used in the Scriptures. Jesus also said, “I am the light of the world,” “I am the gate of the sheepfold,” “I am the true vine.” (John 8:12; 10:7; 15:1, JB) None of these expressions implied a miraculous transformation, did they?<br>  At 1?Corinthians 11:25 (JB), the apostle Paul wrote concerning the Last Supper and expressed the same ideas in slightly different words. Instead of quoting Jesus as saying regarding the cup, “Drink all of you from this .?.?. for this is my blood, the blood of the covenant,” he worded it in this way: “This cup is the new covenant in my blood.” Surely that did not mean that the cup was somehow miraculously transformed into the new covenant. Is it not more reasonable to conclude that what was in the cup represented Jesus’ blood by means of which the new covenant was validated?<br>  What did Jesus mean by his statement at John?6:53-57?<br>  Jesus replied: ‘I tell you most solemnly, if you do not eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you will not have life in you. Anyone who does eat my flesh and drink my blood has eternal life, and I shall raise him up on the last day. For my flesh is real food and my blood is real drink. He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood lives in me and I live in him. As I, who am sent by the living Father, myself draw life from the Father, so whoever eats me will draw life from me.’”—John 6:53-57, JB.<br>  Is this to be understood as meaning that they were literally to eat Jesus’ flesh and drink his blood? If so, Jesus would have been advocating a violation of the Law that God had given Israel through Moses. That Law prohibited the consuming of any sort of blood. (Lev. 17:10-12) Contrary to advocating such a thing, Jesus spoke out strongly against breaking any of the requirements of the Law. (Matt. 5:17-19) So what Jesus had in mind must have been eating and drinking in a figurative sense, by exercising fa|`|AA11521494	Jesus commanded it during the Last Supper.|`|HUePP83xaa	The bread and wine is a symbol of Jesus christ|`|CVvYhEfGaa	pretty sure society thinks cannibalism is wrong.

And gave wine, and said 'drink of this for this is my blood'.   Amen|`|2f6d591b87634e2c1909160eb45e94a1aa	Because that is what Christ used at the Last Supper.<br>  <br>  Besides Bread and Wine are pretty much universal foods.

a53UbiOXaa	It already exists.  We are slaves to consumerism....|`|loy04C98aa	I believe there already is, it has already started.  Outsourcing is one way in which huge swaths of the country were firmly placed outside of the "American Dream".      The 80's saw another form of economic disaster in the change in our trade agreements which continued right up into the 90's.  This change meant that no longer could US companies manufacture in the US and compete on price; international manufacturers could now ship into the US without duty or tariffs being imposed to balance cost and ultimately price to market.      Finally toward the end of the 90's and now into this century we have seen the incremental growth of the H1B Work Visa program.  Focused primarily in the IT sector, on average 100,000+ "temporary" workers come to this country every year and stay for 6 years or longer on their temporary Visas.  Yep, do the math.  They bring their families with them and after two years, usually at least some of their family members will also be granted permission to work.  The force down salaries by a minimum 20% across the board.  They will work in union shops but not in unions.  They are replacing the US worker every day because they will frequently work as "contract" workers without benefits through one of 5 big off-shore owned IT contract houses.    Economic Slavery? Why wait we are already there.  The market failed and wiped out many of us.  The US debt is so high that taxes will have to be raised to pay for them, if not on us than on our children and their children.  If we don't recreate a fair trading environment and balance our population putting Americans back to work first, we will not just be enslaved; we will be enslaved to a foreign power.

So many people think its hypocritical to all of a sudden begin a new category now that someone biracial, who identifies as black, has reached such a historic level.      Back in segregation, just 40 years ago, Barack Obama would not have been able to sit in the white section, or drink from the white water fountain.  Also, many prominent black leaders in history are actually biracial, like Booker T. Washington, and they have always been known as black.  It is due to the country's history of dividing the races.  Maybe in the future it will change, but remember that Barack Obama was born in the 1960's, and when walking down the street, I'm sure he was treated as a black man.|`|gwqS6xHpaa	LOL.

Iqp3ZUAlaa	She does a lot.<br>  <a href="http://www.royal.gov.uk/" rel="nofollow">http://www.royal.gov.uk/</a> has links to the Queen's duties and schedules.Here's a peek:<br>  The Role<br>  As Head of State, The Monarch undertakes constitutional and representational duties which have developed over one thousand years of history. In addition to these State duties, The Monarch has a less formal role as 'Head of Nation'. The Sovereign acts as a focus for national identity, unity and pride; gives a sense of stability and continuity; officially recognises success and excellence; and supports the ideal of voluntary service.<br>  The Daily Schedule<br>  The Queen's working day begins like many people's - at her desk. <br>  <br>  After scanning the daily British newspapers, The Queen reviews her correspondence. <br>  <br>  Every day, 200-300 (and sometimes many more) letters from the public arrive. The Queen chooses a selection to read herself and tells members of her staff how she would like them to be answered. <br>  <br>  This enables Her Majesty personally to see a typical cross-section of her daily correspondence. Virtually every letter is answered by staff in her Private Secretary's office or by a lady-in-waiting.<br>  <br>  The Queen will then see, separately, two of her Private Secretaries with the daily quota of official papers and documents. This process takes upwards of an hour.<br>  <br>  Every day of every year, wherever she is, The Queen receives from government ministers, and from her representatives in the Commonwealth and foreign countries, information in the form of policy papers, Cabinet documents, telegrams, letters and other State papers.<br>  <br>  These are sent up to her by the Private Secretaries in the famous 'red boxes'. All of these papers have to be read and, where necessary, approved and signed.<br>  <br>  A series of official meetings or 'audiences' will often follow. The Queen will see a number of important people.<br>  <br>  These include overseas ambassadors and high commissioners, newly appointed British ambassadors, senior members of the British and Commonwealth Armed Forces on their appointment and retirement, and English bishops and judges on their appointment. <br>  <br>  Each meeting usually lasts 10 to 20 minutes, and usually The Queen and her visitor meet alone.<br>  <br>  The Queen may also meet a number of people who have won prizes or awards in a variety of fields such as literature or science, to present them individually with their prize.<br>  <br>  If there is an Investiture - a ceremony for the presentation of honours and decorations - it begins at 11.00am and lasts just over an hour. The Queen usually meets around 100 people at each Investiture to present Orders, decorations and medals.<br>  <br>  The Queen will often lunch privately. Every few months, she and The Duke of Edinburgh will invite a dozen guests from a wide variety of backgrounds to an informal lunch. Occasionally, the guest list may consist of far fewer people, such as a newly appointed or retiring Governor-General and their guest. <br>  <br>  If The Queen is spending the morning on engagements away from her desk and other commitments, she will visit up to three venues before lunch, either alone or jointly with The Duke of Edinburgh.<br>  <br>  On a regional visit, The Queen and The Duke of Edinburgh lunch with a wide variety of people in places ranging from town halls to hospitals.<br>  <br>  In the afternoons, The Queen often goes out on public engagements. <br>  <br>  Such visits require meticulous planning beforehand to meet the hosts' requirements. <br>  <br>  And The Queen prepares for each visit by briefing herself on whom she will be meeting and what she will be seeing and doing.<br>  <br>  Royal engagements are carefully selected by The Queen from a large number of invitations sent to her each year, often by the Lord-Lieutenants (The Queen's representatives in counties throughout the United Kingdom). <br>  <br>  This helps to ensure the widest possible spread and to make effective use of The Queen's time.<br>  <br>  If the engagement is outside London, her journeys are often by air using a helicopter or an RAF aircraft. <br>  <br>  The Queen carries out around 430 engagements (including audiences) a year, to meet people, open events and buildings, unveil plaques and make speeches.<br>  <br>  Such engagements can include visits to schools, hospitals, factories, military units, art galleries, sheltered accommodation for elderly people, hostels for the homeless, local community schemes in inner city areas, and other British and Commonwealth organisations.<br>  <br>  The Queen regularly goes out for the whole day to a particular region or city. If the visit is a busy one, or if it lasts more than a day, then The Queen will travel overnight on the Royal Train. <br>  <br>  The Duke of Edinburgh will often accompany The Queen on such visits; when this happens, they will carry out some engagements jointly and others separately to ensure that the maximum number of people and organisations can be visited.<br>  <br>  The Queen may end the afternoon seeing a number of Government ministers in a meeting of the Privy Council.<br>  The Queen's working day does not stop at the end of the afte|`|Ku3A8kkzaa	Yeah, She has a very similar role to president . . .<br>  <br>  Look at her website for more info;<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.royal.gov.uk/HMTheQueen/DayInTheLife/TheQueensworkingday/Morning.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.royal.gov.uk/HMTheQueen/DayIn...</a>|`|nGkCWpRVaa	wave a lot|`|vOODVZbNaa	I'd say she just gives out orders & has everything done for her all day!LOL!

They take all of the credit and none of the blame for everything that happens around them. As far as they are concerned, if they hurt you, it's either your fault, or you made them do it. In graphic terms, if they stab you, it's only because you ran into the knife. If you criticize them, it's not because they deserve critisim-you are either too stupid or too shallow to appreciate them. Self-justification is as natural to them as breathing. In their eyes, you are lucky to be among the chosen few they have decided to grace with their time and attention. And trust me, any relationship like that is demeaning and unacceptable to begin with.    In psychiatric terms, dark entities in human form are the true sociopaths among us. They can mimic human emotions brilliantly without ever really feeling them. They can seem incredibly charming (all the better to seduce you into their proximity); they can seem deeply sensitive, compassionate and loving; they can seem genuinely sorry after they've wounded you, to keep you off balance about their true nature. They can feign interest in anything that interest you-including God and Spirituality - in order to create the illusion that you and they have something in common. It's all a performance and they drop the act as soon as they're convinced their control over you is secure.    Sadly, we white entities, because our emotions and faith are genuine, have a tough time grasping the concept that it is all a performance. So rather than walking away from the dark entity once they have "removed their mask," we stay with them, trying desperately to rescue the wonderful person we are sure that is in there because we saw them with our own eyes. It is almost impossible to imagine that wonderful person isn't lost, but never existed in the first place. But in the case of a genuinely dark entity, it is the cruel, bleak truth.    Secondly, dark entities don't generally get to know or care about the people around them. What they do care about is the reflection of themselves that they get back from the people around them. As far as they are concerned, white entities are walking mirrors in which to admire themselves. As long as their reflection through our eyes is flattering, we're of value to them. But the minute we catch on that we're only looking at a disguise, and that whatever character and integrity that they possess exist only because we "filled in the blanks" ourselves, they will react in one of two ways. Either they'll distance themselves, or they'll repeat the performance that won our approval in the first place, to try to win it again.    Third, dark entities live by their own arbitrary, self-serving rules, which can change without warning at their convenience and which don't necessarily apply to anyone else around them. In their minds, their behavior is always acceptable, but they may become outraged or deeply wounded if someone else aims that same behavior at them. White entities invariably try to make sense of all this and adjust accordingly. That's logical. It's also useless. The rules and behavior that please a dark entity on a Tuesday night, might throw them into a tantrum on Wednesday. The result is that a white entity is kept constantly off balance and confused, which gives the dark entity that much more control and power.    The goal of a dark entity is not to turn a white entity dark. That can't be done. Their goal is to destroy a white entity-not physically, necessarily, but certainly emotionally. Let's face it; the one way for darkness to survive is to destroy the light, so that's their purpose and their pleasure. They go about it trying to create as much emotional turbulence, self-doubt, guilt and depression as possible in as many white entities as they can lure into their dark grip. They insult, they demean, and they threaten to end a relationship if the white entity doesn't "Shape up" while insisting that no one else would even want a relationship with someone as worthless as the white entity anyway. They promise to take away anything that is truly important to the white entity if they do leave. In other words, they will do anything that makes the white entity feel insecure, and, as a result, eliminate any power the white entity might have. The problem is white entities have a conscience. We are sensitive and compassionate, and we take our responsibility seriously. We have a natural tendency to believe the best about the people we care for. Those are the qualities that attract dark entities in the first place. They love the flattering reflection of themselves in our eyes, and they know we're likely to perceive their darkness as some kind of sadness or pain and try to help. You may have heard the saying "No good deed goes unpunished." I have a good feeling that saying was coined by a white entity who tried to rescue some supposedly troubled, misunderstood

62b2cd2d722d9ef592a49afa50095ba5aa	"Mom, I love you very much and I hope you know this. I would never say anything to hurt your heart, so please dont take this the wrong way. MOM...the HOUSE REEKS!! It's time to do something about the cat problem."    She may nut up and cry. She may be upset. I'm sure you are prepared for that. Let her know that you are behind her and more than willing to help her fix the problem. I suggest you BE more than willing to help her with the issue because if not then don't expect much. Come up with a game plan on how it can be fixed and present it to her. I don't suggest you say "Get rid of the cats" because she will become defensive and put a wall up. First off research if your area has a "No Kill" cat shelter that she may be able to give up some of the cats to. There are many of these shelters run by "Friends of Pets" and the like who's goal is to place the cat in a loving home. She may say that she loves the cats and can't give them away, but honestly she if she can't love the cats in a healthy way, in a way that the cats can live in a clean environment, etc. then the most loving thing she can do is place them in a clean, safe environment. Point out that if she only had one or two (even 3 depending on how many she has now) she could give the kind of love she wants to give to the pets. Once the cats are placed, have the carpets professionally cleaned, the walls, furniture etc. (vinegar is the only thing that neutralizes cat urine and it works absolute wonders) and help mom to start over fresh.     Good luck!  ~Kim~|`|de947568c9e8173e12d8a9930bab48abaa	No one should ever have more than 2 cats at the most, they stink to high heaven and unless you clean those litter boxes 2-3 times a day, it is always going to stink plus the cat urine and fur is very unhealthy to inhale. Take the excess cats and drop them off at a shelter, that is ridiculous.|`|AA10378447	"Mom, the house smells like cats. Do you invite anyone else over and they say this, or is it just me?"|`|7c73d357ee89c177275de5c2d1c35fd2aa	She already knows this.  Every time she enters her house from the outside she will smell it.    I'm assuming that she has a working sense of smell, of course.|`|31v7TjzFaa	If she has too many and can't cope she should give some of the cats to people who can. I also doubt a person with many cats can give each cat the attention it needs, it's about more than just giving them food and cleaning up after them. But if she wants to take care of many cats that's her choice aslong as she can manage it and they are living well and happy. Better than being a stray and it's a nice thing to do.    It would be a huge job to make the house perfect if she has many cats especially if she's busy with work.|`|6f812b070bb6a7494447f70abb1119fdaa	You might just have to hurt her feelings.  If you can smell a cat, they are not being cared for properly.  Either the litter box is not being emptied frequently enough causing them to want to eliminate elsewhere, or one or more of them are ill for which improper elimination is a sign.  Either way, with so many cats you cannot give them the proper attention.  This may be your way to bring it up to mother.  Tell her you can smell cat urine throughout her house which means they are unhappy or unhealthy.      Sadly, unless you rip out the carpet AND the padding, you will never get rid of the odor regardless of whether you solve the problem of improper care.

e8a42257dd2b34817d2020222ee63839aa	The main thing Paul is important for, is bringing Christianity to gentiles.  Until he came along, it looked like Christianity was going to be limited to Jewish people for a little while longer.|`|3ba0ab7304ca31210254987d14dbe035aa	I think one of the things most interesting about this conversion is that Paul did not ask for it.  He was on the road to Damascus, papers in hand, to actually tear believers out of their houses and murder them.  Jesus came to Him, unbidden.    This is very comforting to me because I know people who "fight against the goads", like "Saul" was doing, furious at God, not desiring to know God.  To understand that nothing is impossible for Jesus Christ, that He can transform anyone, that is very awesome.|`|lU5mdniUaa	where is the proof of Jesus giving Saul a second chance he has deceived you all|`|9mLjDa5kaa	The main meaning is that the Lord Jesus chose Paul to preach to the world that believing in Jesus alone is the only way to get into heaven.  Even trying to be a better person, won't get anyone into heaven.|`|759ae5ae6e1570ab62326b25526ef339aa	The conversion of Paul is a good example of predestination.  Paul had no intentions of becoming a Christian, but God had chose him before the creation of the world.|`|0yPfYLEFaa	I don't know how you feel about the capital punishment debate, but if you want you might say something about how Paul was a murderer--after all, he killed thousands of Christians in his zeal for God--yet God did not desire death for him. Instead, He took Paul and turned a seeming monster into one of His greatest instruments.    So you could use that as an argument against the archaic "eye for an eye" viewpoint that many Christians still hold today.|`|THYJUsavaa	Maybe you could talk about how often people do things that they wouldn't otherwise do if they saw the Light of Truth.  Paul did what he thought was right until He was literally blinded by the Light and his vision later restored.  When we know the Truth, it's a lot easier to recognize and accomplish our mission on this planet.  Without the Truth its impossible.    Blessings|`|nBERj16Eaa	Maybe just add that St Paul's conversion (being thrown from horse, blinded, etc) was a specific event.  Most conversions aren't like that.   For MOST of us Christians, conversion is a PROCESS that happens over a period of time.  We have "daily conversions" of the heart.  And sometimes, to us,  conversion is not  turning a prostitute into a holy woman,   or a bank robber into a priest,  in most cases, conversion is:     continuing to do the right thing.... but this time for a BETTER reason or motive.      Hope this helps.|`|AA11962632	Maybe you need to revise the 2nd chance part over.  Remember Saul/Paul was dead spiritually and an enemy of Christ until he met Christ personally on the Damascus Road.  And Paul even spoke of how he was the enemy of Christ.  He said for me to live is Christ but to die is gain; which should be all the saints attitudes.  We are to live for God and Christ through the power of the Holy Spirit within the saint of God.|`|fYZ1XOhNaa	Paul was dead and was given 'LIFE'.Its a mistake to think he was given a second chance. Second chances come to those who have already recieved a first chance!! We are all born into sin.We either are born -again or still remain dead spiritually.  So i think you need to re-think your whole perspective on his salvation!|`|JqzCRh1paa	Another Part of the Story often missed ,  you may need to re word it better then me.    St Paul (birth name saul) was the Biggest persecutor of Christians, He was A Jew..He was also The Most Highest regarded Student of the Rabbi's and Pharisees, What that Means Is He understood the Old Testament Better than Most anyone of those times & Today, He was responsible for persecuting the Christians, Killing them ,Condemning them because of his Stature as A TRUE MAN OF GOD...A Great Future Leader Amongst the Jews.  What is interesting Also to note is The Message Jesus Gave Paul in the Question He Asked " Saul Saul Why do you persecute me?" Jesus did not Say, Saul Saul we do you persecute My People? Paul Knew what Jesus ment, He New then that Jesus is Directly Connected With All of Us Jesus is a Part of All of us. Jesus at that point was resurrected, Paul was persecuting Christians because they Worshiped Him & were not following Hebrew Law.. He wasn't persecuting Jesus physically , But More the Idea of Christianity, But by condemning the people of Jesus, he actually was Persecuting Christ. he realized this when Jesus Made that statement , It is Paul who writes saying We are All one Body in Christ We are in Him & he is In Us.    By the way Who Better then Paul to Have Promote Christ & Christianity ....Remember he was the Best Student and Master of the Old testement ...He was a Complete Package to help establish Christianity and the Traditions

Q5BM2POnaa	Christian or not I see a few issues:    You only describe yourself as either passive or aggressive and not inbetween.  You need to work on your backbone and ability to be direct without resorting to violence or inappropriate language.    You are enabling his behavior by not being honest with him, and you're doing that out of cowardice.  Trust me, this guy isn't the first time these issues have come up for you, and this won't be the last.  Life gets a whole lot easier when you learn some assertiveness skills.    If you truly can't bring yourself to actually just have a conversation and tell him how you feel, then at least be honest with him via writing or phone, even if it's an email.  After all, if you aren't honest with him, maybe his annoying habits elude him?  You might actually be helping him by being honest, and isn't honesty important as a "Christian"?    You are exacerbating the problem here, not the other guy.|`|eAMq1iBWaa	Been there and it's difficult. Never lie or mistreat. Sooner or later the situation will resolve itself. Nothing wrong with you.

If the other person listens and confesses it, you have won that person back. Mat 18:16  But if you are unsuccessful, take one or two others with you and go back again, so that everything you say may be confirmed by two or three witnesses. Mat 18:17  If that person still refuses to listen, take your case to the church. If the church decides you are right, but the other person won't accept it, treat that person as a pagan or a corrupt tax collector.      You are supposed to be upfront. Why is that hard? That is what you are called to do. By lying and sneaking around, you are creating a sin nature of deception.

Its much better than what I would have done, which would be to flat out tell him to leave me the **** alone.    You have to remember that even Jesus got pissed off when people were acting ignorant and annoying. When the merchants were peddling goods and such in the house of the Lord, he destroyed their things and told them off. While this situation is a bit different, the point is is that if someone is doing something to you that you don't like, you have to stand up to them. Being a Christian doesn't mean being a pushover.

Yet beforehand, pray for Him.     Ask him why he's acting like that. What are his motives. If it's a wrong motive, tell him that your not interested or you'll call the police for his attitude.

It is a funny thing that several countries in Central Africa (Cameroon, Gabon, Tchad) were granted independence at the same period, August 1960, with a one or two-days delay, so as to allow the French envoy to travel from capital city to capital city and attend the ceremonies.

They say that if you can say that you would have accidentally reacted and hit them with something that would naturally be in your hand then you are less likely to go to jail. For this reason I would choose a really big heavy torch, like my Mag light.
oY4vwdjVaa	They're just pissed off because you can get the benefits of being black (scholarships and such) but not have to deal with as much racism as they do because your not skin deep black.    It's all bologna. Don't worry while you have a nice job and family, those kids will go on complaining about crap that has nothing to do with their progress in life. It's what they do.    Please - remember not all black people are like that. Coming to that conclusion makes you just as bad as they are.|`|BHb5LPb1aa	Pure and simple they are jealous of you and your sexy exotic looks you have, so next time they make fun of you just take it as a compliament|`|UyDkYaXuaa	They're just mad because your hair won't fall out if you wash it too much.

I would have thought you would be worshiped and adored like him.|`|K1QjTwzaaa	them is not a person nor is it a group able to be judged based upon the actions of one or many. I'm black and 99.9 % of my friends are white because i grew up with so much of what your speaking off. I've been the "boughie *****." so i can relate.    you refer to *them as a them and us as a *we    everything you've said is baised and extremely contradicting..  you ask..."Why do black girls judge me for being mixed?"    the answer is this.  because you judge *them for being black."Why do most people judge a few individuals as a group, as if they were all the same just because of a single similarity? that is something someone should ask you..    i'd have no probable with this personally being that i am a male but when you speak ignorant statements condemning the innocent it generally offends me.    you speak about the "black community" and say thing like "We are STILL judged by the color of our skin" but then you mess up again "why are *blacks so judgemental of each other?"    if all you can see is blacks against whites, and blacks against blacks sweetheart open your eyes because my child has to live here one day too. an ignorantly condemned world based upon stereotypes isn't something i'd wish for anyone|`|6dP60V3zaa	it's 2009, and it's a shame that stills goes on, but I don't think it's has anything to do with you.    as you know most blacks were slaves in the south, and what happened was that if you were of darker tone you worked in the fields and if you were black with fairer skin then you worked in the house, so there was some tension btwn the darker skin and light skin blacks, with still goes on today sad to say.    but it's nothing you can do about it b/c you can't help the way you came out, and if they want to judge you on just your looks it's their lost. and they must don't have much of a life if all they have to do is judge and harass you. just continue to be yourself and ignore the haters.|`|AA11484353	Unfortunately some people are stupid, and thats just the way it is baby girl.

I'm a balck female and most of my friends r mixed and I NEVER judge them. I think the reason why so many black females judge other half black females is because they r insecure. Yes I said insecure. I think most Black females think they r losing some type of battle with orther raced females. Like black men r changing over to white women and hispanic women and even asian women. And now they see you the mixed girl with the black features but not to much just enough for for another full black women to get tossed to the side. I think it's a ego thing idk. Hope this helped. :)|`|M4ZGDSfIaa	I thought I answered this question already. Oh you just posted it twice.

kx9zeEiFaa	This is obvious, the only people that judge you are the ones who are jealous of you. They like the way you look and they feel threatened by the competition. Cuz most guys especially black guys are suckers for a lite skinned chick (that's assuming you came out that color) because its the best of both worlds.|`|wluJx79taa	is it just black girls?  probaly not.  you know what your are and what your not.  so why worry?|`|4Vmlf902aa	Those girls are just mad that your hair is real, and theirs isn't. Or maybe they just hate you cause your mixed, and think you'll get all the attention.|`|69YQw3Kwaa	insecure|`|UspK4SQBaa	The racism between Blacks and Whites has caused the colorism between Blacks, and has been going on for hundreds of years.  Sadly, teenagers make snap judgments on people based on looks.  These people are partly jealous and are partly using an irrational dislike for you as a way to bond with other girls.  Please don't allow their immaturity and ignorance to make you feel bad about yourself.  You know who you are and will do well in life.  Pity them, and pray that they mature as they age.  They probably won't.|`|CdTe8MO4aa	maybe deep down they like you and there trying to show that you should be proud of what you are|`|3QNwf2eMaa	probably because you act arrogant and you don't even know it.  maybe that's why they hate you.|`|X40Ww89qaa	black girls judge everybody|`|aUScPZFYaa	How long did it take you to make this up?

The best thing to do is to try to ignore them or just talk it out with them. But still be proud of who you are no matter what :D Don't let them bring you down!     -and jeezus i agree with damex above, someone asked a reasonable question about some black girls and people think it's okay for them to be racist when answering >.>?  What a wonderful world.|`|LiOOF1Plaa	Jealousy. Blacks are notoriously ruthless to their own kind. Just because you have some of "them" in you.........makes you hated. Be proud of your skin, and don't mind those chunks of coal.|`|AA10652430	Because:    1. They're jealous.  2. They're immature  3. They need some enlightenment (BIG TIME), some of these girls and I know what I'm talking about.|`|WAoNhHB1aa	Honey, it's a good thing I'm below drinking age, because if I had a shot for everytime somebody asked a question like this, I'd be wasted by now.    My answer is, I don't know.  Girls suck sometimes.  If you went to an all mixed-race school, they'd still find some reason to tease you.  Like in an episode of Fairly Oddparents, Timmy wished for everybody in the world to be gray blobs and some people still thought they were "the grayest and the blobbiest."|`|sbDa2JcPaa	Ignorance and childish.|`|iVapI5JPaa	I noticed this. There was this girl in my class she was half white half black and all the black girls hated her. They always told me that she thought she was better than them, but I never got that impression.

I know what it is like to get judged, believe me, sorry.|`|lXOjqvcPaa	I know how you feel girl things will never change|`|c9b39ba1619a86eb939cf1b78c3d4a15aa	dont know where im from there is a range of skin color in black people, so it's common place.... I suggest you grow up and not worry about what other people think!|`|OL7p0Tdnaa	.well first of all racism is never going to change..  nd also you can't just ask why some blacks are racist against mixed race because only they can tell u that.why wud we know..  .It could be jelousy..because liter skin girls usaully get more positive attention then a darker girl wud... but i'm not sure what goes thru other peoples heads. they were probably hurt by somethin some1 sed to them  in there life involving there race or skin color and you can't really blame them 4 that...  ..although i'm mixed also  ..w/ black.. colombian..native American...nd a little chinese. . but i don't quite no what your going thru cuz my skin is not lite mor like fair  nd i hav more black features...so most ppl consider me to be Black.  .and most likely you connect more with the hispanics because you relate more to them appearance wise . i wud  confront them nicely show them that your friendly and not what they might think you are.that alredy shows your a bigger person. but other then that  i don't know.  . mamita.?|`|0818EVcWaa	It's only because some darker toned black women are sick of hearing how beautiful mixed girls are and how ugly they are. Personally, I would never do anything like that to you since in my eyes, you're my sister since your mama is black and I feel like I should hold you up. Just tell those girls that you understand how they feel and that you don't think that you're better than them and I'm sure that their opinions of you will make a 360 degree turn around, I promise you. I would just explain myself to them whenever they start saying stuff like that.|`|Ogu8kZGxaa	Ur judging blacks by saying what you jus said which makes you a hypocrite, but im mixed too..75% black 15% white and 10% other lol but blacks are still angry about past black history and im not using past black history as a crutch or an excuse but its reality and no one would understand it but a black person... that sounds ignorant i know but its true yall and everyone judges so don't jus say its black people because that's ignorance. Another thing is that dark skinned black gurls get picked on because of there skin tone... "ooo look at her shes blacker than night time!" or "ewww she so black all you can see is white teeth and eyeballs" and thats why they pick on you because they see want they want and cant have and because you have black in you they dont like it because your skin is lighter and most guys like that. Most women think dark black guys are sexy. "sexual chocolate" lol so there excepted more than dark skinned black women    I was picked on because of my lighter skin tone, im a light skinned black mixed women so i was called wanabe white girl, sell out.... everything! just ignore it like i did... and i wish people would stop saying bad things about blacks in general because not all blacks are ignorant, ghetto, wild and crazy... and the blacks that are that way pick on the blacks that aren't! and not jus black people are this way either!    Jus do you and ignore the negative stuff|`|57oHulIDaa	1. Maybe they are just jealous of you, or they just don't like you in general. Or maybe you've done something that made people think of you as stuck-up.   2. I really don't understand why you address yourself as a "mulatto", its an offensive term.   3. Being a multiracial person doesn't mean that you will be more or less concerned about your physical appearance or more intelligent.   4. As long as you're proud of what you are, it shouldn't matter what other girls think that you are, girls will be girls, girls can be really jealous, the only advice I can really give you is to let it go or deal with it.|`|68vju75baa	they're racist|`|a2DW1Bqgaa	Because they are RACIST|`|2AH1EjGAaa	Most people are judgmental about mixed folk like me and you. Lol, just ignore it.|`|mnwN4QuRaa	excuse you dvk, saying that black girls judge everybody is a judgement on all black women. Hypocrite|`|3Gag96sbaa	Ignorance, and probably jealousy.|`|o43uZSDJaa	Yeah, they do judge everyone, and as long as you can love yourself it should not matter. Plus, they are most likely jealous of your features and are trying to find flaws to make themselves look better.|`|jTOZLjsOaa	wow really racism isn't easy to stop.|`|Gph0c0kbaa	im sorry, but black girls judge everyone!  im talking about groups of black girls you see in highschool or that are all ghetto and shi-t.  "oh-no she di'in! gurl was trippin all ova ma boo so i bit-ch slapper her across the face! damn tha's right, wassup foo'?"  god theyre so annoying, get over yourself  im sure youre really cool and pretty and theyre all jealous because youve got great features and nice looking skin tone|`|7pJuA3MJaa	dvk is my idol|`|M4ZGDSfIaa	They are probably just jealous. Unfortunately you run into African American girls like that because they are insecure. All of us aren't that way, but some of us have poor self image because our skin is darker. They probably have had bad experiences because of how dark their skin is compared to anoher light-skinned girl and it has transferred into their everyday lives. I do no appreciate the fact that people leaving comments are grouping all young black women together because I assure you I am 100% black but I have plenty of biracial, white, black, and other races of friends and I love them all. All black girls are not the same. We do not all judge people. Do not group us all together and give us that stereotype crap because it's bullshit because I, and plenty of other black girls prove it wrong everyday. But like a lot of people are saying, do not let it get you down. Keep living your life and don't let them effect you. They are jealous, but you keep moving on and pay no attention. And you aren't insulting anyone or being arrogant (more haters).|`|NBK3s2LVaa	Because ghetto black girls are racist and unintelligent for judging you like that but I think you could have figured that out yourself. Don't let them get you down girl be proud of your heritage I mean think about it our president is half black and half white too.. Keep your head up and anyone who doesn't like you or judges you based on your racial heritage isn't worth your time or worry.|`|7iR0l7mCaa	WELL,i THiNK THEiR HATERS FOR REAL..iM AFRiCAN AMERiCAN,(BLACK),NiCE HAiR,SMiLE,AND EVERYTHiNG ELSE  OTHER PPL JUST DONT HAVE THE SAME AS EVERY1 ELSE WE'RE ALL DIFFERENT SO TELL THEM THAT iTS NOT GOOD 2 JUDGE BEFORE U DONT EVEN KNO ME:-)     P.S. iM DEALiN WiT iT MAh SELF:-)  STAY STRONG,iM NOT TAKiN SiDES THO:-)    OHhh YEA,i HAVE (MiXED)PPL iN MAh FAMiLY SO iTS OKAY 2 BE DiFFERENT yOhH+|`|lqzmJlrRaa	I kind of agree.

LMJVHOWLaa	The Jobs: Despite the odds, it is possible to arrange a job beforehand.  That stalwart of ESL web sites, Dave's ESL Caf??, occasionally has ads for positions in Brazil; I even saw one recently for a school in a little town in Rio Grande do Sul.  If you're interested in living in S?o Paulo, the heartbeat of Brazil and a world city with restaurants, entertainment, and shopping to rival major cities anywhere, check the web site of the S?o Paulo newspaper O Estado de S?o Paulo.  Simply type in "English" and see what comes up.  If you can teach computer skills, you will be in high demand at computer schools.  Rudimentary Portuguese will come in handy for this.    You will undoubtedly have more luck if you research where you want to go in Brazil first, then contact schools in that area directly instead of waiting for ads to appear on worldwide web sites.  This way, you stand out as a proactive teacher with some knowledge and a particular interest in that placea good first impression.    Most people, however, do work under the table.  This does involve risks, not the least of which is being reported to the police by a rival school that doesn't like having competition.  For the most part, you will not be taken advantage of by the school since you will be an asset to it in attracting business.  There are a few national chains in Brazil: SKILL, Y??zigi, and Fisk are among the biggest, but not always the best.  As franchises, they are individually run and management style is subject to the professionalism of the owner.    Nothing irks Brazilians more than to be lumped together with Spanish America; indeed, the Spanish had a completely different colonial experience from the Portuguese (as in killing the natives instead of marrying them).  Do your homework:  as in any country, the more you know about it before you arrive, the more warmly you will be received, the easier will be your assimilation, and the more help you will be offered.    Unfortunately, online resources in English for jobs in Brazil are few.  Be weary of corporations that guarantee a teaching job after you have taken their training course or any other ad that sounds too good to be true.    For More Info   International ESL job sites:     www.eslcafe.com/joblist   www.eslworldwide.com   www.berlitz.com   www.tefl.com   These are just a few; there are many others.

We also have other selves in the multiverse that are lower vibrating beings and they are us. Some may call them demons, but they are us. You don't get rid of them. You incorporate them into you as one. lol No, this is not "demon possession".|`|NsLtN7oLaa	Nothing.|`|0s190C7Zaa	Dude they can't be confined they're every where!|`|bxlYleZkaa	Oh but theyre not!|`|N2PcehV4aa	Demons are not confined to darkness.

The darkness brings on a vibrational change within us because of the cold dark nights, shorter days and rainy weather.  We are like bears and should go into hiding during these times.  This is a time to rest and await the coming of spring.  There will be a renewal during this time no matter how bad the economy seems.  We are like the plants getting ready to bloom.      The other day I looked out the window and in the midst of the drab weather and plants retreating for winter a cardinal was sitting on a branch of a mountain laurel.  Wow, a red bird in the black and white of winter.  What a beautiful abstract and an uplifting moment.  Hope, the cardinal brings hope.    Peace.

vFQOAsUKaa	The simple answer would be NO.  On the other hand you have the burden of proof.  You'll have to be able to trace your ancestry farther back than the Civil War.  Now if your ancestors came to this continent prior to the 1800's there is a good chance you may have a Native ancestor back there somewhere.  If that ancestor was female you may never be able to find her though.  Many men married "Native" women but kept it secret for reasons only known to them.  So there may be no record of any such marriage.      It took me 15 years of searching to find my "Native" ancestors....|`|l1ctIW7eaa	your family would have had to live here before Christopher Columbus discovered america if you're a native|`|agh18eT2aa	pab is correct.  The Native Americans were here before Chris got here, and long before the pilgrims landed at Plymouth Rock.  If you are a direct descendant of those peoples, you have Native American heritage.  You would know it if you did.|`|lrqZHi9Jaa	Unless you have indian ancestors, no.|`|8RmazUuBaa	I can trace by family tree names and all before the civil war but my ancestors were likley here 200 years before the revolution and Im still called "African American"....So many would say no, but I say anyone here pre-1865 gets honorary American status to me..Its just immigrant haters who have no histoy in this country saying "no ones American"..|`|PdY9ylZCaa	in general, when people say "native american" they are referring to people of a specific* ethnicity.    although you are culturally native** american (of the United States persuasion), you are not ethnically "native american" (unless you've traced your ancestory, but by now any "native american" blood you had in your family is going to be very dilute in you)

God loves you and asks you to just believe His redemptive work thorugh Jesus, and you will be saved.    But people's pride and sins kept their hearts hardened to not believe in Jesus.

Joh 3:17  For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through Him might be saved.   Joh 3:18  "He who believes in Him is not condemned; but he who does not believe is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.     Rom 1:18  For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who suppress the truth in unrighteousness,   Rom 1:19  because what may be known of God is manifest in them, for God has shown it to them.   Rom 1:20  For since the creation of the world His invisible attributes are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even His eternal power and Godhead, so that they are without excuse,   Rom 1:21  because, although they knew God, they did not glorify Him as God, nor were thankful, but became futile in their thoughts, and their foolish hearts were darkened.     Summary:  Men are wicked, period.  Christ offers us redemption, apart from our own works.  The world today which denies God does so in the face of the obvious, and all logical thought.

Anyway, by saying that you will "never change you beliefs", you show that you take things 100 % on faith, and you are completely impossible to reason with. What kind of position is that?!    If someone could prove to me that a god did exist, I would accept it!  It's just that until now, I have not found any of the arguments particularly convincing. Same goes for creationism.    It probably won't happen, unless completely new evidence comes to the surface, which for some reason undermines all of the evidence we have discovered this far. But I am not saying that "I will NEVER change my opinion, no matter what!!" That's intellectual dishonesty. You should be more flexible than that.    If one day you discover that the arguments and proof for evolution are more convincing than the ones for creationism, you should be able to change your mind! Otherwise, what are you..?

WRyHOEjSaa	Nice question. Not a lot of people making clear choices from the menu so far. Shocking, I know.    Interior Castle wrote: How can a different part of the cell encode for the same information that the symport and antiport membrane transport mechanisms decode for -- when the organelle came from outside the cell.    Response: You do realize many of the original mitochondrial genes have transferred to the nuclear genome, right?  http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/article...    Martin S wrote: When considering how to define information you have to realize that information is only information when it means something to someone.    Response: And theres your problem! Youve established a definition according to which DNA can only carry information if God exists (given that no one else knew the DNA code until the early 1960s). What you havent done is establish that DNA must meet that definition of information. As far as is evident, the only information in DNA is the kind that allows variations in that molecule to produce corresponding variations in an end product (the protein or RNA or phenotypic trait). Similarly, variations in rainfall up in the mountains can produce variations in the silt layer at the mouth of the river. Changing wind patterns out in the ocean can move the wrack line on a distant beach. A rock comes loose from a cliff-face up there, and ends up down here. In each of those examples a passing intelligent person might be able to discern things about the initial conditions from changes at the endpoint, but those endpoint changes still occur, and are specified by the initial conditions, regardless of whether the intelligent person is there or not. Sequence variation in DNA specifies, through a series of intervening chemical reactions, the amino acid sequence in a protein. There is no requirement that the code mean something to someone.    Martin S wrote: Or,...you believe that a code far more complex than the code that runs on your computer just came about through massive amounts of time and fantastically lucky breaks with natural selection canceling out all of the "bugs" in the code along the way.    Response: Its not more complex than the code that runs on my computer. The DNA code consists of 64 codons that map to 20 amino acids, a start prompt and a stop prompt. You could learn it in a couple minutes if you were allowed to write it down. People study for months to learn computer languages, and thats just so they can interact with the machine code.    Furthermore, the system according to which DNA sequences eventually produce phenotypic traits is much more forgiving than the one by which programmers make computers perform tasks. Screw up a tiny bit of spelling or syntax in thousands of lines of computer code, and the computer will just sit there. By contrast one can change DNA in all kinds of ways without causing any problems at all. Whole viruses and transposable sections of DNA get inserted all over the place. Chromosome strands regularly cross over and switch places with their homologues during meiosis. Bases get miscopied. But DNA doesnt work like a computer program. Every word of a computer program specifies an outcome, and changes to any such word generally result in failure to produce any outcome. By contrast, most of DNA doesnt do anything, and any changes to the parts that do merely result in a somewhat different protein or RNA. Usually the changed protein or RNA works the same as the original, sometimes worse, occasionally better. Natural selection lets the neutral changes stick around, tosses out the bad changes, and increases the good ones. In short, a computer program is highly subject to error, and intelligence must be used to avoid such errors. The DNA-to-phenotype system invites errors, and works better when they occur. Not only is it idiot-proof, its idiot-friendly! One has to wonder why God would design an idiot-friendly system that only He can run.|`|M6VcuiyDaa	It has something to do with "kindology"|`|ATPPWOpWaa	The realm of God and Christianity is of a spiritual nature.  You ply Christians with spiritual questions while requiring them to give answers according to the rudimentary elements and limitations of this world.

Your foundation is not correct.    Finally, the first life wasn't like a modern cell.  A modern cell is the result of 3 billion years of evolution.    You need to read a textbook NOT published by the Discovery Institute.|`|WbaN6osZaa	Not a creationist -     But I do like the 'you are fat' answer best of all.    I thought that showed some major input on their part.|`|AA11232725	When considering how to define information you have to realize that information is only information when it means something to someone. If you spilled a bowl of alphabet soup in the sink you might look at all of the letters and be able to find four of them that spelled a word and to you that would be information. But if someone couldn't read they wouldn't see anything there but some spilled soup in the sink.    So how does that definition fit in with the "information" found in the DNA code that is in every living cell?    Consider a computer since computers use coded information. A computer has a lot of zeros and ones stored on a hard drive that wouldn't mean anything to most people. But the people who designed the computer created software and processing devices so that all of those zeros and ones serve a function to make the computer do certain things.    That's why it's clear that in order for DNA code to work in living cells either some intelligence had to design the cells with all of their interdependent parts, and the code in them that sends orders to keep  the cell functioning...    Or,...you believe that a code far more complex than the code that runs on your computer just came about through massive amounts of time and fantastically lucky breaks with natural selection canceling out all of the "bugs" in the code along the way.    It's like saying a natural computer with all of the right chips and power supply and software all came together by chance and more than that, that all of the information in the software came from randomness.    http://www.khouse.org/articles/2000/256/    As Michael Denton has pointed out, "Although the tiniest bacterial cells are incredibly small, each is in effect a veritable microminiaturized factory containing thousands of exquisitely designed pieces of intricate molecular machinery, made up of 100,000,000,000 atoms, far more complicated than any machine built by man and absolutely without parallel in the nonliving world."    The "simple cell" turns out to be a miniaturized city of unparalleled complexity and adaptive design, including automated assembly plants and processing units featuring robot machines (protein molecules with as many as 3,000 atoms each in three-dimensional configurations) manufacturing hundreds of thousands of specific types of products.  The system design exploits artificial languages and decoding systems, memory banks for information storage, elegant control systems regulating the automated assembly of components, error correction techniques and proofreading devices for quality control.    All by chance?  All without a Designer?|`|D9lMg7A2aa	Ok, poseur.     It is like the informational coding under the endosymbiontic theory of Plant cell organelles. How can a different part of the cell encode for the same information that the symport and antiport membrane transport mechanisms decode for -- when the organelle came from outside the cell. It defies my highly mathematical mind to think it could happen in 10 billion years. That's what I mean, poseur.    ====> Almost forgot. You frauds get me so excited. I am NOT a creationist.

I haven't heard that.

F3nlVXJ5aa	since a man woos a woman and you should not be chasing him, he should be chasing you, I suggest you get him a nice hallmark card, maybe even a funny or cheerful card, nothing super serious.  You should not buy him a gift.  It's ok if a man buys a woman something (cards, flowers, a nice card, takes her to dinner, maybe an inexpensive necklace with a heart) but it's not your place to buy him anything.    Remember too that etiquette says that the first piece of clothing a man buys for a woman is her wedding dress so don't insist on him buying you a piece of clothing until then, or anything expensive unless it's a diamond ring.|`|Nl64RmRWaa	You could get him a dog tag necklace, a silver chain, or a bracelet. Maybe even a ring. Getting something engraved on it would make it even more special.     Do the 365 reasons why I love you. That is very romantic and shows how much you love him.    Also, check this website out, it has some cute ideas!   http://www.personalizationmall.com/Whims...

3ba0ab7304ca31210254987d14dbe035aa	Yes in fact this happened recently.  I really was upset over it.  I was even angry at God that He would ask me to do something like He asked me.  I prayed and prayed, finally ended up doing what He wanted me to do, and saw that my rebellion was prideful and my fear was unfounded and from came from satan, since the bible teaches God does not give us a spirit of fear.    Quite a lesson.|`|78a004f4953e767d0c2c36ffd1bf1c39aa	Funny you should ask.  I recently heard a Preacher say that if God asked you something you could do in and of yourself it was not God.

I just worry He will give me something that will interrupt my life and will be something I don't really want to do.|`|uFAoq4idaa	God will not be asking us what we couldn't handle.

That is why the Lord told us to pray "DELIVER US FROM EVIL"  the evil to come that will tempt you, Lead me not into temptation but deliver me from evil, this is speaking of a specific evil to come.  You can find out what evil at theisraelofgod.com  the UNCUT WORD OF GOD|`|6QheioCMaa	Not any more, I used to,  I know now, that I can do whatever He asks because when God tells you to do something, He will also give the faith to do it well, along with the ability,      I also have learned that sometimes, alls that He asks, is that we stand willing, and now I know, He knows perfectly, which things are too much for me.    I used to think, that if a thing was good for me to do, and I had trouble it was only from a lack of faith. When God tells you to do something, and it is from God, you will not only have faith to do it, you will also have peace which is the absence of fear.    I also had to learn, that not everything good to do, was up to "me", to do. That's why there are varying gifts in the Church.    So now, If I do run into something that is too much for me, I know right then, that It is ME, it was my will I was following and not His, and I've gotten off course .    And if it is God's Will, He will prepare the way "in" you, first. He will equipt you with all that you need, so that you will have all that is required and be able to do whatever He asks,|`|eAMq1iBWaa	Many have. Take Moses for example. And Daniel. There are others. But all these persevered through faith and voila God enabled them to do His will!|`|HdmlZdyHaa	I used to but then I realized God never gave me a challenge I could not over come without him, when I did it by myself I realized I would fail.|`|DQjAGWXQaa	Wonder how many "God would never do that" answers you'll get?|`|e8a42257dd2b34817d2020222ee63839aa	No.  I pretty much trust He's not going to do that.

2dfdfcdb4d65c895a40f81c0cb21ef17aa	If only the reporting rate really was that high....<br>  <br>  You may think you're being cute with flinging around statistics so casually as your way to discredit black men, but in doing so you also are doing Black women a disservice! The reality is that domestic/intimate partner violence is happening, and it's no laughing matter for Black women.  <br>  <br>  While in mainstream communities there is increased awareness of domestic/intimate partner violence,  and lots of sympathy being demonstrated for white women who are victims.....it's still something of a dirty little secret within the Black community, and little if any concern or sympathy is being shown to black females who are beaten or abused by those who claim to "love" them...and often times Black women victims of DV are blamed for the problem!  <br>  <br>  According to the University of Minnesota's Institute on Domestic Violence in the African American Community (IDVAAC), African-American women experience intimate partner violence at rates 35% higher than their White counterparts and 2.5 times the rate of men and other races.<br>  <br>  Most legitimate sources (see links below) cite that Black women are MORE likely to become victims of domestic/intimate partner violence but they are also LESS likely to report incidents of domestic violence or sexual assault! So right there, that "statistic" of yours is skewed!<br>  <br>  In a study done by the American Bar Association, of African-American sexual assault survivors, only 17% reported the assault to police. Why? Several reasons. <br>  <br>  Within the Black community, there is a general distrust of law enforcement because many police officers have demonstrated a lack of concern regard Black crime victims and will often assume the Black person is the perpetrator rather than the victim.  Even when the police are called, the response rates from police are a LOT slower when the calls come from Black or low income neighborhoods than they are from White or more upscale neighborhoods.<br>  <br>  Sometimes there's societal pressure imposed on a Black woman not to turn against a "brotha."  So the women, even if they do call the police will drop charges for that reason.<br>  <br>  If the woman is a churchgoer, she's sometimes advised by her pastor to "forgive" the abuser. <br>  <br>  Black women are also told far too often that it's a "private" matter and that she should not put her business out on the street, and that we should be "strong" and handle problems "on our own" <br>  <br>  Even if the woman does leave, sometimes she has nowhere else to go, and she's told that relying on batter women's shelters is something that  "only white women do" or that it won't help...and the abuser takes the attitude of "she always comes back to me anyway!"<br>  <br>  The Surgeon General of the United States reports that domestic violence causes more injury to adult women than cancers, heart attacks, or strokes. The really sad thing here? Black women are also more likely to DIE from domestic violence than women of other races!  In fact, it is the #1 cause of death amongst Black women ages 15-34.  Black women comprise 8% of the U.S. population, but account for 20% of the intimate partner homicide victims.<br>  <br>  So are you still laughing at the seriousness of this issue? I certainly hope not!!!|`|ZmdIlkpQaa	Please provide a credible source for this assertion.

Jesus being God in the flesh was subject to the temptations of men and yet did not sin.  I'm sure He enjoyed some of the things that you have mentioned with moderation.  Jesus knows that we are tempted and knows temptations strength.  This is why He forgives us.  Just repent and turn to Him and follow Him.|`|rU6nh42Eaa	I'll bet your bedroom is all pink and stuff.|`|6QheioCMaa	As a matter of fact, He walked this earth for 33 yrs and is now sitting on a Throne in heaven, and has far greater things to enjoy, things that the Bible says, no eye has seen, or any mind has ever even begun to be able to imagine.    A man reaps what he sows, we suffer the consequences when we do wrong.    He does all that He does because He is full of loving kindness and mercy.    The Bible says,  that Our ways are not God's Ways, neither are our thoughts His Thoughts.  That God's Thoughts are higher than the heavens are from the earth, compared to ours.    He is also, in the hearts of all the believers, throughout the earth. Seeing His children happy, healthy and free is His good pleasure.|`|cc7bb4a1d7aea36d431a0fa34dbdec91aa	time for your trip to la-la land i think, sleep well

Then I HAVE to laugh, otherwise I would cry...|`|azPlK9ckaa	"Making fun of" is kind of a subjective phrase. There is a difference between ridicule and criticism. People usually ridicule the beliefs of others (religious or otherwise) because they are insecure in their own beliefs, or they have been taught by others that particular beliefs are crazy or ridiculous. People usually criticize the beliefs of others when those beliefs seem illogical and are being used as a basis for policy making.    For example, if you believe that God wants us to execute people, you might lobby to enact legislation for capital punishment. If I tell you that you beliefs are wrong, and that God doesn't want us to execute people, then I am criticizing your beliefs.    If, on the other hand, I say "you're stupid religion is wrong, and you are stupid for believing it", then I am ridiculing your religious beliefs. I'm not sure which of those you were asking about, exactly, but hopefully I've answered it either way.|`|346e6e2923d4e46195fcf8100cba96beaa	For some, a good amount.    I'm guilty of it in the past, and I bet if you look back far enough in yours, you've done it too.    Here's one poke I heard on a movie: "A Lutheran is a Baptist that can read."   Told by a actor portraying a Presbyterian minister, I laughed and loved it and used it for years, until I realized, either through time or study or both, that I shouldn't be that way.    I'm sorry for it. Really am, and I don't do it anymore.    Anyway, my beliefs are constantly being poked at.   Either seriously, or jokingly.   The ones that are just joking, I generally think are funny also.   The serious one I've learned to overlook.|`|NlzlBV8Haa	A feeling of superiority.

1fd9957e2ec9a7bf90a8eb7c7c9d3c47aa	I would have just laughed it off. These people were probably just having some fun with you. They obviously like you enough to try to find what you wear to be a conversation topic. If they didn't like you, they would have been whispering about your clothing choice behind your back. Try to take it in stride and realize that some people do not always mean to come across as rude, even if you might have taken it that way that particular day. If it really bothered you, save those "loud" clothes for home. Your boss may have been trying to convey this with his comment, so even if there is a free dress code at your workplace, he may have thought your shorts were a bit distracting.|`|pTaf7PtTaa	Even though you do have a "free dress" policy at your workplace, you should definitely be considering what you wear, especially during summertime. Shorts, lounge pants and other "revealing" clothes are simply not appropriate at work no matter what the policy is.    I'm not sure exactly where you live, but in Canada we have policies on workplace harassment. The comments that can't be made at work are long and varied. I think you went through at least a mild form of sexual harassment, which is definitely on the list.    I don't think it's so big of a problem that you have to tell your union or something. It's definitely unfair, though, that people made those comments to you. The comments should never have been made at all, and you have a right to discuss the comments with your boss if they really bothered you. Just keep in mind that it's probably not a good idea to wear shorts to work :P|`|juMKsO6laa	tomorrow, show up in something even weirder, like an umbrella hat or feather boa or something. see what happens.|`|de947568c9e8173e12d8a9930bab48abaa	Let it go.

It is not harassment, especially when you did it deliberately knowing it was "loud" and would raise eyebrows.  Also, free dress usually has limits and this was a polite way for your boss to "dress you down" without making an official notation of it.  Next time, wear pajamas or a wet suit if you think it falls within the realm of acceptable attire for one's job in this economy.|`|vjIUUajsaa	Ugh.. I hate it when people make rude remarks like that. And if you have free dress code then you should not be getting any heck for what you wore. For what your boss said to you I think is so wrong. I am sure that would be illegal. Let me know what you decide to do.

8Nqq7tkwaa	well my nation is split into several reservations and reserves on both sides of the canada/usa border and in one case right on the border so....  we don't use blood quantum and traditional people want to keep it that way. band council government indians want to limit enrollment through blood quantum but they always find themselves at odds with the traditionals. its a good thing we don'trecognizee that they have any authority over us.   for us you must trace yourself to the nation through your mother. we are matrilineal. if you are mohawk on your fathers side only, then you might be enrolled but you would not have a clan as these are only passed by the mothers.    i see blood quantum as a government tool to "breed us out" of existence. there is no other reason. pencil genocide. why native nations enforce our own extinction is beyond understanding. each nation MUST be allowed to set their own criteria for enrollment without government interference. under present rules it is possible for a person who is all native to be descended from so many tribes that they are unable to meet blood quantum requirements for any tribe. that's wrong.    there was a gathering of native leaders not too long ago and at that meeting, they were presented each with a copy of software that they could use. they would answer some questions about present enrollment and requirements etc. once they answered all the questions, it would tell them the exact year they would cease to exist as a native nation. in other words, when they would be extinct. that's what some enrollment requirements are doing. helping the government deal once and for all with the "indian problem".  i have other thoughts but..not for a public forum.|`|vFQOAsUKaa	This subject is a two edged sword.      The enrollment requirements for my tribe is as follows:  The person seeking citizenship must be able to prove they descend from a person on the Baker Roll of 1924, in addition they must have a minimum of 1/8 blood quantum.  Citizens of my tribe do receive a per-capita payment but only if you live on the reservation, I don't live on the reservation so I don't receive any payments.    In regards to the Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma's recent recension of the blood quantum requirement.  You must remember that the Cherokee in Oklahoma have the most "diluted" Native blood of any Tribe or Nation.  The Cherokee as a whole intermarried with "whites" more than any other group of "Native Americans". You have to remember that at the time of the removal the "Chief" of the Cherokee (John Ross) was only 1/8 Cherokee by blood quantum. So I think the Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma have taken a step that many other Tribes or Nation will have to eventually go along with if they want to survive. The reason I say this is that with each generation that comes along the blood quantum goes down (unless all the full bloods marry full bloods). Each time a citizen of any Tribe or Nation marries a "non-native" person the blood quantum goes down.  If the Tribes or Nations don't lower their blood quantum requirements they soon will have no citizens. And when that happens the goals of government past come true, we will be assimilated into the "white" culture and will lose our identity, and that will be a black day indeed...|`|ppR5kH4Yaa	Enrollment requirements for my tribe come from the 1934 IRA Constitution adopted by my tribe plus amendments.  As amended, the enrollment requirements are 1/4 or more Shoshone or Paiute (alone or in combination) from Duck Valley AND a direct descendant of a person listed on the 1934 base roll.  Direct descendancy isn't a big issue and I think it is a good requirement.  The reservation-based blood quantum though is a tangle.  A person can be 4/4 Shoshone-Paiute but with only 3/16 Duck Valley Shoshone-Paiute blood and not be able to enroll because they do not meet the 1/4 Duck Valley Shoshone-Paiute blood quantum requirement.  (However, that same person will probably be eligible for enrollment in their other parent's Shoshone or Paiute tribe.)  Other than those two requirements, all a person has to do is fill out the paperwork, submit it to enrollment and enrollment takes it before tribal council.  Once tribal council approves, you're issued a card.    I think my tribe's enrollment requirements can be changed/improved to remove the reservation-based blood quantum requirement.  This way a person who is a direct lineal descendant can still be enrolled as long as their total combined Shoshone-Paiute blood quantum is 1/4 or more but that Shoshone/Paiute blood can come from other places in addition to Duck Valley.  For example, a person who is 1/8 Duck Valley Shoshone-Paiute and 1/8 (or more) Shoshone or Paiute from anywhere in Nevada/Idaho/Oregon/Wyoming/Utah/Califor... would meet the 1/4 minimum blood quantum requirement and be eligible for enrollment.  This would increase our enrollment without 'lessening' the minimum blood quantum requirement.  :o)      Our tribal enrollment numbers around 1500 or so.  We have people from 4/4 on down.  There are many other Shoshone and Paiute tribes all around us, each with 1000 or more enrolled members.  Lessening the minimum blood quantum is not the answer in my opinion but it is incredibly important to me that all who are enrolled remain connected to the tribe and tribal activities.  I have family members who are residents of my reservation but cannot be enrolled.  While lessening the enrollment requirements would benefit my relatives, it is really not good for the whole.|`|7sgJuukQaa	Gawd, such long drawn out answers....blah blah, and blah..just answer the question already.........my decent is: (Choctaw,Chickasaw,Creek)....although I can be a member of only one Tribe which is:  (Choctaw) our requirements are as follows= http://www.choctawnation.com/Programs/ds...|`|i9XnU8pkaa	Hey...sorry I'm not native american. My fiancee is half black and half Pascua Yaqui.    I don't get involved in tribal politics that much, but when I listen to her family talk, I think they say 1/4.    She disagrees and wishes they'd go by direct lineage like the 5 "Civilized" Tribes or w/e, b/c she says she knows fullbloods who don't know squat about yaqui history, but knows people who are as low as 1/16 who are so proud of their heritage and can even speak some of the language, and are "genuine."|`|LQQAQDkIaa	We have only recently gotten federal recognition. The enrollment is still a fiasco. The rules change with each tribal council. In order to get the recognition, there were about 1200 people of varying blood degrees enrolled. As soon as the recognition was given, disenrollment began. We still don't have an ironclad procedure, and there is a lot of bad blood over it out here. The other part of my tribe are still trying to get recognition. It is sad, they took Yosemite from us, and say they don't recognize us. Pray for us.
NYU37jfGaa	a.  Dickens was very concerned about the conditions of the poor.  However, his depiction of life among the poor was usually set in an earlier period than the one he was actually living in.  Some of the conditions he wrote about had ceased to exist before he wrote the books.  As in Great Expectations for example, where he points out that the conditions in which prisoners are kept in the present (i.e. when he wrote the book) are very different from those portrayed in the novel.|`|de947568c9e8173e12d8a9930bab48abaa	A.

4vrUbRujaa	um... i think it's yes and no; it depends.... like my family isn't really sensitive, but when i'm with other asians, my parents r always like 'do not do this and that', 'don't say this and that,' or 'if u put it this way it will be more appropriate.' <br>  Why? cuz ppl r sensitive.... <br>  <br>  And it's that asians' face won't tell the truth. when i accidentally offended other asian, they won't look mad or unappreciated, but in their hreat 'u stink mannerless little brat.' it's really make me uncomfortable, like if i'm doom and no way to undo the little mistake....<br>  <br>  they kept thinks in themselves; i'm afraid if they will just blew up anytime..... <br>  <br>  anway there r good and bad ppl; therefore there will be sensitive and unsensitive ppl.|`|StRaKUf6aa	I don't think they appreciate the small penis stereotype at all.|`|pUWszP1Uaa	Well, I would say so. I have a few Asian friends, and they do get sensitive and sometimes touchy about certain things...|`|5l2kTANaaa	No more and no less than any other races but they keep things for themselves better and would generally observe a lot first and act.<br>  They have a long memory also.<br>  They tend to repress a lot though in my opinion, because the culture demands so. So it is "smile" , good manners etc when they do not feel like it. Which can lead people thinking that they are untrustworthy and all that........Quite the contrary actually !<br>  Face for a lot ( maybe less so for Asian Americans) is very important and they will try to reciprocate also : meaning not to offend the other person.<br>  <br>  But boy....when things have been bottled up a lot, can they explode ! Although confrontation face to face is not exactly in their nature unless really pushed ( among them perhaps more).<br>  <br>  source : I lived in South- East Asia.<br>  <br>  And oh.....the worst thing you can do is laugh at them. I once took a cab and knew my way home but the taxi driver thought I was just a mere tourist and tried to take advantage. When I pointed out that I perfectly knew what he was doing...he really exploded " you do not know anything about Chinese Culture and etc etc etc". I did not say anything : I just laughed and it drove him madder. ( it was a very rare occasion though). I thought the car was about to explode too lol !<br>  <br>  And oh well all the cliches that am sure you know about. Nerd , gold-diggers etc etc..( but since most are extremely well educated...).<br>  <br>  Mind you some ethnies tend to be more direct : Thais, Vietnamese..Koreans sometimes too.<br>  <br>  I just do not put all Asians in the same basket..<br>  <br>  And yes.....they are all individuals once you get to know them better. (although outward expression of individuality is not normally encouraged. More group conscious)<br>  <br>  But still I see a difference between Asians born in North America and the "FOB" ( sometimes looked down by the previous group). The former will tend to be more extraverted and open whilst the latter might be very wary of a new culture and some only mix with those of the same race.|`|tlUihEOvaa	So you can determine that with one Asian you talked to? <br>  <br>  yeah yeah even if you're Asian I won't go easy on you if you generalize.<br>  <br>  I see people of different backgrounds on here complaining or disagreeing with what others think or say about them.|`|e9gXZsKxaa	not more than whites, blacks, greens, and purple.....|`|tYtJDXaQaa	Yes.

This research is based on observation and facts collected, not on belief.>><br>  <br>  This statement is false. The only "research" that has been done on evolution in the last 150 years has dealt only with variation within a kind, which is NOT evolution. This is the only observable science that can be attached to evolution theory, but variation within a kind ALSO supports creationism! Every other supposed bit of evidence that evolutionists use to support their theory are only INTERPRETATIONS of the facts, not the facts themselves. For every point of evidence, there are at least two different explanations for how it got that way - one an evolutionary interpretation, one a creationist interpretation. Both use the same facts, just different interpretations. But evolutionists want you to believe that their "interpretation" is part of the fact, when it isn't. <br>  If you truly believe that evolution is a fact, and you also believe in the scientific method (which is the only acceptable means of verifying observable science), then try this experiment:<br>  <br>  Demonstrate, using the SCIENTIFIC METHOD ONLY, how a dog can either come from or produce a non-dog ("dog" here being defined as any member of the canis family). Your results must be repeatable and falsifiable. <br>  <br>  Can't do it? THEN IT'S NOT SCIENCE. IT'S A BELIEF!<br>  <br>  We can verify scientifically that there are over 250+ breeds of dogs in the world. We'll call this a "fact", because it's observable. This is what we call "variation within a kind", and it also applies to fruit flies, corn, bacteria, salmon, etc.  But to take it a step further and say that this variety somehow "proves" that the dog and the cat had a common ancestor, you have now moved out of the realm of observable science and into "faith". You have to BELIEVE that this occurred, despite a lack of observable evidence. This is exactly why we call evolution a secular "religion". You have to BELIEVE in it, because no one was there to observe it, and it is not occurring today.<br>  Today, what we see in the natural world is exactly what Genesis 2:17 says - animals only bring forth after their "kind". That is all that is ever observed. Change between kinds has NEVER been observed, either in nature or in the lab.<br>  <br>  Conclusion? Both evolution AND creation are religious in nature, and neither can be substantiated by the Scientific Method. It just comes down to where you want to put your faith. I choose to put my faith in God's Word.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Chaz - and you don't seem to be able to tell the difference between a "transitional fossil" and a species in its own right. I guarantee the fossils found in India are not "transitional". Wishful thinking doesn't make it so. All so-called "transitional" fossils found over the last 150 years have been proven to be hoaxes and outright lies. What makes you think these in India are suddenly "authentic" transitionals? Scientists are so desperate for missing links that they'll label ANY fossil as "transitional" - but it's just their belief!|`|9XAqnmOQaa	The following is a complete list of peer reviewed studies in support of Creationism or Intelligent Design.<br>  <br>  ______________________________________...|`|2fBnlLoeaa	I will suggest the documentary " EXPELLED" featuring Mr. Benstein.

Nevertheless, Darwin confessed, "To suppose that the eye with all its inimitable contrivances for adjusting the focus to different distances, for admitting different amounts of light, and for the correction of spherical and chromatic aberration, could have been formed by natural selection, seems, I freely confess, absurd in the highest degree." <br>  <br>  darwin said it was absurd..come on  and wake up.<br>  <br>  yet with advancements in biology we have proven thousands of those systems, and yet atheists still lay claim that evolution is right.<br>  <br>  Darwin was at least a free thinker, why arent' most atheist today?  could it be they are scared to be wrong|`|pakIAYWoaa	observation is the same since both sides are armed with the same data; it is in the interpretations of this data where it becomes a matter of faith.  The discilplines of mathematics and logic when applied can be used to rank probabilities on the odds of each of the various scenarios for the evolutionary model for man to exist.

fd5f2954d03f8ed32926400fe1b18cfcaa	I agree with you. Anyone who is truly seeking enlightenment will seek out all ideas, to discover which ones fit their personal philosophy, and which don't. Those who cling to their religion like a lifejacket and never go outside the safety of it never grow or learn, and turn into the hate-filled bigots who are afraid of everything.|`|J7KSKm54aa	Yes, we may gain something from someone else's point of view. I always like to say "how do we know if no one tells us?" Meaning that sometimes it is impossible for us to think of an alternative solution or even epiphany. Another thing I say is "I may not agree with what you say or believe, but I need to respect it and you may not agree with what I believe or say, but you should respect me" For example- I like to acknowledge people's birthdays, so I try to make a point of remembering them and also may tell other people, so that they can say Happy Birthday too. I told someone it was his brother's birthday and he was like so what, big deal. He is this way, because his family did not celebrate birthdays. He made me feel like I was wrong to care about the birthdays and ask him to acknowledge them too. So I learned that epiphany due to this situation- he made me feel stupid many times because of this birthday wishing. So it was important to me and he had the opposite point of view. I did not change his point of view and he did not change mine and we both feel that we are correct. So respect me and keep your opinion to yourself and I will respect your opinion as well. Another example was when my friends were talking to me about God. It was when I first moved here and I really wanted to find Om. They are stout Christians and they talked to me about God- of course they believe that God is Jesus. I explained that I did not want to talk about Christianity and they respected me.

I see that here a lot - from all sides.

UTak66q0aa	It could be fate that we make choices that determine our future.You determine your future.     Psychics are fake. And I really don't care how other people react. If you believe in god the almighty then you don't believe in psychics no more than you believe in ghosts that are stranded on the earth.     How to tell if a psychic is fake.    1) Many fake psychics on-line ask for your date of birth or your star sign.   2) Fake psychic online will ask for the country or city you live in and sometimes your age, this is because where you live can say a lot about the kind of life, education and your social status - work class, middle class, upper class etc.  3) A fake psychic will make all kinds of promises that they can bring back your lover with spells and candles which, of course, will all add up to extra and expensive charges.  4) Many of the tips I have already given you have been used by fraud psychics, both on and off-line. Another sign that you are dealing with a fraudulent psychic is if they tell you they are famous or internationally world known, or have read for Hollywood stars.   5) Fraud psychics don't like to be tested, so they will never be interested in you asking a few questions that only you have the answers too. If they will not let you ask a few questions first or refuse to do a general reading, then it is more than likely they're con artists.   6) For face-to-face readings offline, it is better for you to go wearing some casual clothes, wear no rings, jewelry or designer wear. Everything from the way you sit, talk, clothes and jewelry you wear can tell a fake psychic a lot about you. If you speak very proper using a lot of big words, then it probably means your well educated, designer clothes can tell the reader you not short on cash.   7) Do not let a fake psychic reel you in and manipulate you into giving them more information than you should or need to.   8) A fake psychic will be more interested in telling you what they think you want to hear, rather than being completely blunt and telling you your situation or problem like it is.   9) A fake psychic will try to reel you in and make a lot of cash out of you by pretending that they are your friend and that they care. Fake psychics are experts in manipulation.   10) Fake feedback is a big problem in finding a genuine psychic among the fakes.|`|uPNP1xzpaa	show me your latest pics that you want me to read.

The Talmud is commentary from several sages on the Torah (which is part of the Tanakh).|`|AA12245463	The Talmud is a continuation of the Tanakh, just as the "New" Testament is a continuation of the "Old" Testament.  Would anyone understand Christianity without the "New" Testament?  No.  That is exactly the reason Christians do not understand Judaism.  They have been forbidden from reading it since the 4th Century and the creation of Orthodox Christianity.  As a matter of fact, Christians have burned Jews together with their holy books in order to exterminate them both.    "Love your neighbor" has long been the Christian mantra -- unless they're Jews.  .|`|qCtbizzPaa	There is no Hebrew Bible. There is the Tanakh.

The Jewish Bible consists of the Laws, Prophets and Writings.   Beginning with Genesis (Beresheit) and ending with Chronicles.|`|AA11245447	The Jewish Bible is known as the TaNaKh (T - Torah, N - Nevi'im, or Prophets, and K - Ketuvi'im, or Writings).    The Talmud, consisting of the Gemara and the Mishna, is a collection (formerly oral) of commentaries and discussions on our Law.  In the Torah, G-d tells us to keep the Shabbat holy, but never explicitly outlines HOW to do so.  The Talmud outlines what must be done (or not done!) to keep the Shabbat holy.    For one to study Talmud, you need a good understanding of Torah; otherwise, it's like trying to learn advanced law without first sitting in Law 101!    Check out http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsou...  for an online version as well as http://talmud.faithweb.com , which debunks a lot of the nonsense that can be found on anti-Semitic web sites.|`|AA11047076	OK- let me explain some of the misconceptions that seem to abound here...    The Torah consists of two sections both given at the same time on Mt Sinai:  The Chamishei Sifrei Moshe (the five books of Moses) and the Mishnah (Oral law).  Both are considered to be equally the words of G-d.    The Tanakh consists of Torah, Nevi'im (Prophets) and Ketuvim (Writings).    The Talmud contains the Mishnah and Gemorrah (Ranbinical commentaries on the Mishnah).    So is the Talmu part of the Tamakh?  Not when written in book form, but one cannot be studied without the other.  teh Torah requires the Mishnah to be understood since they are essentially two parts of the same thing, the Mishnah requires the Tanakh to illustrate where the laws come from and how they are understood.    Note:  The above is the Orthodox POV- the various liberal streams of Judaism vary from accepting the Mishnah (but not the Gemorrah) as in Conservative- to rejecting the Mishnah as in Reform.Reconstructionist and Humanistic where it is seen as non-Divine and only Rabbinical

AA11138696	This is a mystery to me.  It clearly states in the Bible which day was to be the Sabbath.  It is clear which is the seventh day of the week and which is the first day of the week if you look at any calendar.  There is absolutly not one word in The Bible that changes the Sabbath from the seventh day to the first day of the week.  Again this is a creation of the Catholic Church and it was followed by the Protestant churches.  It is one way in which the whole world has been deceived as stated in Revelations.  The real Sabbath has not been changed|`|AA11962632	We are to treat every day as special; not just Saturday.    AND BESIDES     Keeping the Saturday was only for the Jews    NOT,    the Gentiles.      AND,    every day is to be holy.  So, as a     CHRISTIAN    I observe Sunday worship service because Christ returned to heaven on Sunday and it says that they worshiped Him then.  Read the Bible.  It says the 1st day of the week.    BUT,    everyday I treat as Sunday for lack of better words.  It is you who are confused,     NOT,    US.|`|mA6ef2LNaa	Because if they would accept the sabbath they would have to then acknowledge all ten of the commandments are for all christians and every denomination.  When God created the heaven and earth and rested on the sabbath day, he sanctified it and said it would be a covenant for the jews for ever.  Everyone who believes in Jesus is grafted on by having a relationship and following His example.  If he keeps some laws and breaks one, he is guilty of all of them.  The sabbath was made for man.  Anyone that has a right to the dictates of his consious will reject or accept.  Jesus was lord of the sabbath and most christians today think that the sabbath is for the old testiment believers.  If they read the whole bible they will find that the sabbath is mentioned through the old and new.  Revelation states clearly that Blessed are those that do his commandments, that they may have a right to the tree of life.  Can a person make their own law, after God gave moses them? All of those that reject the true sabbath of the Lord,  will be lost and will reject Jesus.|`|pSCHJJ7raa	So many of the comments made to your question are the same excuses that have been made since the Sabbath truth has been brought to the forefront in modern times. Jesus spent more time trying to clarify the true observance of the fourth commandment than any other. There is one commandment not mentioned in the New Testament, the second. The disciples were gathered in the upper room not for worship but for fear of the Jews. The Sabbath was made more than two thousand years before there was a Jew of even an Hebrew. In the Epistle to the Hebrews Paul says that if Jesus or Joshua depending on your translation had given another day of rest, would he not have told you so. The Catholic Church offers a substantial reward for the scripture that authorizes the change of sanctity of Sabbath to sunday because it is not there. The moral law tells us what sin is. The ceremonial law (the sacrificial system)  was added because of sin. That was the law (the sacrificial system) that was nailed, that was an offense to us, a shadow of things to come (Christ's sacrifice  on the cross). People do not like change. It is easier to go with the flow than to oppose the system. But Jesus warns us in His word, In vain do they worship me teaching for doctrine the commandments of men.  Josh. 24:15 says, Choose ye whom you will serve.|`|Ldxf1tW1aa	They didn't want to copy the Jews|`|KgsfMJWTaa	Good question.    At least in my sect of Christianity, we believe that it is still a commandment to Honor the Sabbath and we try to do so.|`|sz33MLTsaa	Simplified, as modern humans seem to require..constantly, is thus...    one day should be set aside to worship, pray, and reflect ~    our sunday..the seventh day..isn't the same day that it was in 1500 BCE.|`|SOza8NBqaa	by fundamentalist I believe you are referring to the fundamentals of the Christian faith such as: the deity of Jesus Christ, the bodily resurrection of Jesus Christ, the substitutionary atonement of Jesus Christ, the tri-unity of God (Father, Son, and Holy Spirit), the infallibility of God's Word, the Bible.  And of course, the depravity of man, mankind's radical corruption, we all have an inward disposition toward sin and rebellion against God.  (Romans 5:12).      First, what is of utmost importance so that one's eternal destiny depends on it, is rejection of Jesus Christ that He was the Father's love gift to humanity to provide salvation to all who repent and believe. Rejection of Him is an offense against God when man's redemption cost the Son of God His life and His resurrection is proof that God accepted His sacrifice and man rejects that and turns to his own self righteousness for his or her salvation.  That rejection is the ultimate rejection and unfortunately will cost many eternal life with God.      Secondly, all the 10 commandments are repeated in the New Testament except one, that's right, remember the sabbath.  Colossians 2:8 warns believers not to let anyone cheat us with deceptive words regarding some things that have passed away. Feasts and days are among them.  The book of Acts nowhere says the church is to remember the sabbath and the pastoral letters Paul was telling Timothy how to conduct himself in the house of God nowhere mentions the sabbath.  The true Sabbath of the Lord is Jesus Christ. He is our eternal rest.|`|AA11966875	Because not everyone knows and or understands everything.  Because people who are learning must have a teacher, and this is what they are taught.  You speak of the true Sabbath of the Lord as if it is merely a day of the week - the True Sabbath Rest maybe is now the Ultra-Real Rest of a spiritual place of which these physical Sabbath days are only a mere shadow and symbol - in which case there may truly be some fundamental believers who have never rejected to True Sabbath of the Lord, but only the weekly observance of the Sabbath as a day of rest, which law was given to the Jewish nation (Exodus 31:13-16) as a covenant between the LORD and them (as is stated in other places).  See the other scripture links in the sources below for other reasons that followers of Christ maybe do not observe Saturday as a day of rest.  But if you truly believe that it is part of what Jesus called people to do, then you must also realize that not everyone learns everything at the same time.|`|ZJ2k7Ynqaa	Let  no man therefore  judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of an holyday, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath days.

Why do you reject the true sabbatismos of God in favor of the inferior, shaddow sabbaton?|`|XKhNw221aa	the Sabbath is one day a week to rest, not a particular day.

It was the 7th day that was for rest, who's to say what day that really is?|`|AA11648578	Do you know what the Sabbath is?  The most important part of the Sabbath wouldn't you think?  The Sabbath is more than one day of one week.  God did not get tired but his rest was for your salvation.  Before the coming of Christ the laws of Sabbath were practiced as shadows of the coming salvation.    No one changed the Sabbath and if you wish to follow Jewish law you should learn exactly all that this law entails.  The Sabbath is God's rest for the salvation of the world.  We who accept the atonement that Jesus provides us have by faith entered God's rest...we are saved, The literal day of the Sabbath Jesus brings with his return this is made clear in the Bible the seventh day is God's rest and his day is as a thousand years and this day Jesus will reign on the earth.    Do you really know what the Sabbath is?  If not how are you going to instruct us in how to keep it holy?  Hebrews 4:  1 Let us therefore fear, lest, a promise being left us of entering into his rest, any of you should seem to come short of it.   Must be a day that is yet to come huh?    We see here that the seventh day the Lord's rest is a day which is yet to come. We also see the fulfillment of this day is Jesus Christ.Today it is by faith and it is fulfilled with his return.    Mat. 11:28 Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.     We also see we enter this salvation to day by faith through the aontment of Jesus Christ.      Gal.3:24 Wherefore the law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith.   25 But after that faith is come, we are no longer under a schoolmaster.   26 For ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus.   27 For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ.   28 There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus.   29 And if ye be Christs, then are ye Abrahams seed, and heirs according to the promise.  The Sabbath is a covenant of salvation...without this covenant man would die.It is an understanding that man is sustained by God. His Sabbath the day of rest. The Sabbath represents many things including God's kingdom. All law is to be followed the wages of sin is death.It is like the tithes a percentage of every man belonged to God. This day was the day of the lord. The kingdom to come is the Sabbath called the day of the lord or the Millennium. All sin translates to death not merely physically but also spiritually. The law was to demonstrate this to man. It is the reason for Christ to come. All have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God. the wages of sin is death. From Adam to present day man we all have a death sentence it is the reason God came to the world in the flesh Jesus Christ to overcome sin and pay the penalty of death for us.When we accept Jesus Christ as savior by faith we have entered his Sabbath "God's Rest" and his kingdom.|`|1GytoT0xaa	If there were people that lived their entire lives according to the Bible, they would be in jail so fast.

I don't see why it has to be said again.|`|CQz8dMzFaa	It would be helpful if you were more specific. Iman can be weakened for many reasons, some can adhere to certain rules easily, while finding it difficult to follow others.|`|atAZlwGdaa	by understanding the Koran|`|mOWyzwubaa	The Importance of Reason in Iman    The Quranic view of reason and its place in human life deserves careful consideration. Man has been granted a mind which enables him to think, and through the instrument of intellect, is supposed to build up a system of knowledge. Reason converts the raw data supplied by the senses into knowledge and the Quran assigns to reason an important role in life:    "The worst of beasts in the sight of Allah are the deaf and dumb who do not use their intellect to understand." (8:22)    This is a graphic description of the degradation of man when he does not employ reason to his service. Such a man, the Quran tells us, not only lives a worthless and debased life here but also renders himself unfit for the hereafter which he enters after death:    "There are many among Jinns and human beings, who lead such a life as makes it obvious that they are meant for Hell. They have hearts wherewith they understand not, they have eyes wherewith they see not, and they have ears wherewith they hear not; they are like cattlenay, are worse; they are the heedless." (7:179)    This point is again emphasized in Sura Al-Furqan. The Prophet is addressed:    "Do you think that most of them hear or have sense? They are but as cattlenay but they are further astray." (25:44)    The Quran expects man to think and use his power of understanding in the light of the guidance provided by wahi or revelation from God. These two sources of guidance, i.e., reason and revelation, are supplementary to each other. If they are kept within their proper spheres, then there will be no conflict between them. the Prophet is commanded to say:    "This is my way. My invitation to you to follow Allahs path is based on reason and insightmine as well as of those who follow me." (12:108)    Aspects of Iman    Let us list here several aspects of Iman from the Quran which shed light on its reality:    Iman is not to accept it with the tongue but to accept it with the heart. (2:8-9)    To accept everything which the Quran says as truth is Iman. (2:26)    In order to acquire Iman in Allah, it is necessary to first reject every authority other than Allah. (2:25-26)    Iman will lead human beings from darkness towards light. (2:257)    In matters of Iman, ones profession is irrelevant. (26:111-112)    Unless Iman enters the heart, it cannot be called Iman (and consequently, one cannot call oneself Mumin). One can only say that one has surrendered to Islam. (49:14)    Allah does not discard anyones Iman. (2:143)    Finally, an important aspect which must be emphasized here is that no form of force or coercion (direct or indirect, temporal or spiritual) can be used in connection with Iman. This is because it contradicts the very definition of Iman. (As we have seen, Iman is derived from a-m-n which means peace in the heart.) So any forced conversion cannot be allowed in Islam. In fact, forced Iman is no Iman at all.        try to understand Glorious Quran,not through hearsay but by Glorious Quran itself. you will find The difference|`|UhyvM73iaa	Assalamu Alaikum,    It is a good question. Most Muslims who perform salat because they are supposed to but very few of us have real connection with Allah. To reach to that level first you read more than one best books on the life of Prophet Mohammad. I have Ar- Raheeq Al-Makhtoon, an award winner book on Seerah of Prophet Mohammad SAW.. It is available online with Islamic Book Stores. You will know how Allah helped Prophet SAW  and his companions to overcome the difficulties they had in first 23 years of Islam in Mecca and then Madina and how Prophet and his companions overcome the hardest times of their lives and won wars against enemies who were three, four and some times ten time more than Momineen.    You also make a habit of reading every surah of Quran with meanings and tarsier and memorize the meanings of Ayahs and specially Surah Faith, so during Salat when you are reciting the surah, you understand what you are saying to Allah. When you understand you can concentrate and develop concentration with Allah SWT. You will experience that your hair on your body rise, you shiver, slow waves of energy flow in your body from head towards toe and last stage is tears flowing from your eyes.     This is the best Salat. I have seen men crying during their prayers. I have seen one man with tears when Muezzin said in beautiful voice Ash Hado an La elaha Ilallaha Mohammadur Rasoolallah. When you reach to that level it is called Ibadah with Khushu, then you will enjoy and feel that today you had connection with Allah, He listened to your Dua and accepted your Salat. Many time you won't be able to concentrate for days. Having no connection with Allah will make you feel sad and unsatisfied on your salats. Don't be discouraged.  It happened to even Prophets. But it will make you try harder to concentrate.     To develop concentration a Sufi trained me to do Muraqaba meaning getting closer to Allah. He made us sit in semi circle in front of him. Then he explained how it is done. You close your eyes and concentrate towards Allah by doing zikr of Allah. He explained Muraqba is like swimming against the flow of water of the river. You struggle against the flow and gain some feet and then a stronger current pushes you back (meaning your thoughts slip into worldly thoughts), you keep trying harder and harder and a time comes when you develop strength to swim and gain longer distance than in the beginning against the flow of water ( you become able to concentrate longer towards Allah). Exactly this is what happens during Muraqba and Salat. We read Fatiha will complete concentration but when we start reading another surah, some thought creep in and take us away some where else. We complete the salat and we know we were lost half the time.     Make a dua to Allah to help you concentrate before you start Salat. Raise your voice little so you can hear what you read. It helps in concentration. Say your Salat alone in closed room, so no one else's sound in house interferes your concentration..    Once I had too many worries of wife and child when I first came as a university student alone leaving wife and one year old son behind. I couldn't concentrate and felt bad and stop praying bcoz without connection with Allah, I felt I wasted my time and Allah is not hearing. Then I asked a fellow who was Director of MSA headquarter in 1971. He said your concern itself shows higher level of Eiman. But it is haram to stop praying. You must pray regularly and keep trying on concentration, Insha Allah it will come back to you if you follow the above advice I have written for you. When I saw him crying during Dua at the end of Salat, it made my eyes flow too. Soon my concentration came back praying in his company. He is one of the great Muslims I know.    May Allah guide we all to the right path of Allah, forgive our sins and make us closer to Allah.

Maybe if they are raped/molested (this is only what I've heard) by a person of the same sex and deep down liked it, than that may have something to do with it. On the other hand, if they are raped by someone of the opposite sex, than they may lose trust in them and then become gay. But personally, I don't think you choose.|`|AA10723657	i think that is bull **** you are born gay or bi not because you were molested when you were a child.|`|J0h1TKkxaa	nah i was never touched|`|Ws78Uqesaa	i was molested a couple years ago to my brother who was 2 years older than me but i had attracting feelings to girls before than so i dont believe in my case maybe its different for others :]|`|d8ox561maa	LMFAO!!!!!|`|IxP2IMbcaa	Everybody gets molested, but not everybody is gay. Explain that!|`|qJkRPhIKaa	No it is not true. They may have serious emotional problems but most wont just go gay because of it. They may even molest another child because of what they went through.|`|Iy36xZMOaa	That's a stereotype.  Most people who are victims don't become gay and most abusers aren't gay either.  Most abusers are heterosexual men preying on young heterosexual girls and women.  And these women don't turn out to be lesbians.  They are mostly str8.|`|kNscpF4Faa	I think you are born gay..BUT I think some molestation victims honestly get confused and go for same sex because of abuse    Friends mom was abuse counselor|`|Czpfs8RLaa	It all has to do with how the child handled the molestation, some children who are molested kill themselves but that does not mean they all do, you may have become bi because of your molestation but you will have to decide for yourself whether or not that is true|`|TpKpQ50jaa	I think it ***** up you head but I believe you are born gay|`|zXNfrimRaa	Some of the answers to this question are ridiculous.  Just because someone is molested does not make them gay any more than being gay means you have been molested.  molestation and/or rape are usually performed by married, straight men.  According to the National Organization for Women website, 132,000 women are victims of sexual crimes EVERY YEAR, and those are just reported cases.  Not to mention that every year, 1.2 million straight women are raped by their straight boyfriends.  These women are not any less straight because of the incident, but perhaps more cautious.  ONE IN SIX WOMEN HAVE BEEN SEXUALLY ASSAULTED, while only one in 33 men have been sexually assaulted.  It has nothing to do with being gay or straight, and molestation does not make someone gay.|`|eydt3Rewaa	and your point being|`|Jdp6Cgs6aa	i dont think its true.  im gay & & never been molested.|`|qcOJY8Feaa	Your answer is....in the form of a question...ok...Why is the VAST majority of victims young BOYS??|`|nsZuZ1O9aa	Im sure theres allot of straight people who have been molested, but people never talk about them, do they? I don't think molestation has much to do with sexual orientation. I don't really believe someone can be "turned" gay, but sometimes people will get scared so much they don't want anything to do with people of the other gender.|`|Y4ygzFC5aa	Yeah. Michel Jackson did anal sex with his kid, and Richard Simmons impersonated a priest, so he can check on them kids.
jpqSnCpuaa	you aren't blindfolded because you need to see what letters the thing is pointing to.  i do believe that ouija boards are real but i would never use one bacause i think they are morally wrong.|`|ebc5fdfac8f50e088056beb5d5d6f767aa	The board is nothing. The planchette is a working tool of divination. If you don't have the talent there will be nothing. The Ouija board was created because those without talent would pay money to have something that they could get their adrenaline high with.    The planchette has been in use for many centuries. It is not a toy or game.|`|4YqVNiJzaa	its all fake dude|`|fKyFCg5Iaa	im going to say this epitomal statement...but yea, i do believe in the ouiji board;ive had my own little experiences. when we did it nobody had their eyes blindfolded, i would gently touched the pallete with my index finger and it would move. no force was applied, i had no certain letters in mind. it truely freaked me out...all i remember it spelling out was tears. two nights later my friend died, and all that night i was crying...so yea, that word flickered back into my mind, and every since then me and black magic havent come in contact.

e8a42257dd2b34817d2020222ee63839aa	Right.  Atheism is a belief that there is definitely no God.    But agnosticism isn't some middle ground between belief and atheism.    It's the belief that human beings can never know for sure whether there is a God or not.|`|xxSGhywoaa	I don't like to call myself that because it seems (and I'm referencing Y!A R&S) that all the atheists seem to be in a clan of god haters.  Not the fact that they don't believe in but more in a way of worshiping a hatred for people who do believe in God/Jesus.    So I don't call myself anything simply because I have no beliefs in any religion and I don't hate people that do.|`|8d89b255ad0cc448257f013c1fb8f3a8aa	Yeah, it's pretty much laziness. You don't have to think too hard if you just stay "in the middle".|`|5dd8eBDYaa	"Agnostic: A person who believes that nothing is known or can be known of the existence or nature of god or of anything beyond material phenomena; a person who claims neither faith nor disbelief in god."    Don't confuse belief with knowledge. I simply accept that I cannot know and leave it at that.     Since the "god thing" is such a sensitive topic, think of life after death. Believe? Don't believe? Again; I accept that I can't know.|`|QC94lBXOaa	Well, agnostics ARE less filling.|`|9adfd40573a5f8454356f9c074106d83aa	Then you fail to understand agnosticism - which represents a stand between complete faith belief in God and an absolute determination that God does not exist.  As an atheist, you have no doubts and are sure that when you die there is no after life.  An agnostic is not so sure as you are and looks at the large number of people who believe and the instances where there seems to be evidence of God's activity or lack of other explanations.   Since you have no doubts, it would seem that atheism is agnosticism lite - eh, no worries, mate.|`|IhzeHAx4aa	people who claim to be agnostic as if it is some sort of middle ground between atheism and theism really have no idea what they are talking about|`|AA11595906	No, it just means you're not sure yet.  I went from Christian to Pagan to Agnostic to Atheist over about a 19 year period.  For me, it was a step between religious and not.|`|B5Fm455paa	To answer the original question No, Agnosticism in not the Atheist-Lite. and yes you are a  ******* moron.|`|5tMCDu8gaa	I've never met an agnostic who, when they are being honest, wouldn't admit that they find the idea of deities ridiculous.    They are just afraid to say so. So, yes, atheist-lite.    EDIT: To those saying atheists believe there is definitely no god, you're wrong. Most atheists, including myself, will leave the room for possibility that we are wrong - because we base our lives in realism.    I am 99.99% sure there is no god, and thus it is reasonable for me to live my life as though there isn't. But that doesn't mean I "believe" in atheism. I am simply persuaded by the facts. The same reason I accept evolution.|`|0yPfYLEFaa	An agnostic allows for the possibility--if not the probability--of God. Atheists deny there is a God and claim to know for certain. Agnostics are more honest.|`|AA10556726	Technically an agnostic believes that know if a god exists or not is impossible or unknowable with any certainty.  Realistically, this is not quite the position of many agnostics.    The whole point to Russell's teapot is that you do not disprove claims, but that the claimant must present proof of their claim.|`|LDBvgEG0aa	I do not believe that the human brain is capable of grasping what the universes(plural?) cause is. I also believe that many humans think that they are capable of making an informed decision about something that probably has 7 more dimensions than they are capable of perceiving.  I do not believe in a personal God or in any religion.  I think there is likely a reason or a cause for the existence of everything.  I doubt if it's the Boogie Man.  What leaves my mind slightly open to the God concept are a few experiences that I've had.  I just can't explain them away, but I'm certainly not the sharpest tool in the shed.    Edit: I side with atheists almost all of the time.  Look man, I have no freakin' clue what's floating around out here - http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive... - I don't have enough information to make an absolute statement.  I'll admit it, I'm not that smart.|`|jRcdbna5aa	Basic atheism is simply a lack of belief in gods.  For example, a newborn is a basic atheist.  They haven't developed the thought process necessary to determine if there's a god or not.    Atheism as adults view it is the belief that there are no gods.  It's more of a positive declaration than a simple fact.    Agnostics lack knowledge one way or another.  They may view that there is not enough evidence to say there is a god, and there is not enough evidence to say that there isn't a god.  They believe that they simply can't know.|`|oSME7B23aa	Not really, no.|`|5gqc5qyzaa	I just call myself agnostic because I'm open to people trying to convert me, although no-one's ever managed it because I'm too old for imaginary friends|`|8927d354bcc7758ca946e0b5d715c39baa	Good question. But I believe agnostics "suspend their beliefs" and maybe don't want to seem close-minded to theists or atheists' point of view.    EDIT: and you get less of a gasp from ppl if you say you're agnostic than if you say you're an atheist|`|Rw0ff6M7aa	Yes and sinful|`|mFy3M8mVaa	How do you come to the conclusion that theistic agnosticism is an oxymoron? All it means is that you lean on the side of believing in a deity but that you aren't completely convinced.|`|399b8d4579ac145bf601ea2ecd4bf934aa	atheism is a stance on belief, agnostic is simply the thought of weather or not it can be proven.|`|AA10116612	ATHEIST = THERE IS NO GOD  AGNOSTIC = I DON'T KNOW IF THERE IS A GOD|`|AA12341690	You are correct that atheism is the lack of belief in god rather than the belief that god doesn't exist. Those who claim it means the latter are wrong.    Atheism refers to a lack of belief, and agnostic refers to a lack of knowledge. They're very similar but not quite the same.|`|oHjqlr82aa	I think some people think agnostic means 'undecided'.     Edit: Either you believe in a deity, you are undecided or you don't believe. Agnosticism can be attached to any one of these three positions.|`|RfOLqUKlaa	Gnosticism is knowledge, Theism is belief    Gnostic Theist: "I believe in God because I know for a fact that he exists." (Very scary people)    Agnostic Theist: "I don't know for sure there is a God but I choose to believe in him anyway."    Agnostic Atheist: "There is no proof of a God and I choose not to believe in things for which there is no evidence."    Gnostic Atheist: "I don't believe in God because I know for a fact that he doesn't exist." (Equally as scary as the gnostic theist but fortunately much, much rarer)|`|EepiLrmZaa	the idea of a super intelligent being designing everything in the multiverses has been resolved in my mind. no matter how it all started. it was a natural process. if agnostics can't come to this conclusion. I can accept that. your lack of knowledge is not causing any damage. your not pumping money into the god machine.

Marriage bears much of the burden of child rearing, unemployment support, medical care, elder care, etc. No society is going to succeed without strong marriages.    Polygamy is a very unstable form of marriage in a free democratic country.

So you cannot separate them yet they are 2 persons. The other person in the Godhead is Christ. All three are God. The fullness of the holy Spirit was on Jesus enabling Him to do miracles.

The above verse speaks a lot about who Jesus really is.    There are a lot more chapters and verses mentioned in the below website along with music, speeches and praise and worship.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com    Jesus is God. He is alive forever.    The questions usually asked are:-    1) Did Jesus really exist?  2) Is Jesus God?  3) If Jesus is God, then why did He keep praying to the Father in Heaven? How can the Father and Jesus be one God? Why did Jesus have to suffer on the Cross?  4) What is the Holy Spirit?  5) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet? Why should I see him as God?      It would not be possible to give a short answer to these questions .    I suggest you visit the below website.    After visiting the below website, you would get a lot of answers.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com    1.Thomas calls Jesus God in John 20:28 (Note, Thomas addresses Jesus  specifically.)  2. Jesus is God in Heb. 1:8  3. John the apostle states that Jesus was the Word which was God that became  flesh (John 1:1-14)  4. The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as  "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT  (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)  6. Jesus said that He and the Father are One (John 10:30), that caused the Pharisees to  claim that Jesus was making Himself out to be God.  7. Jesus knew all things (John 21:17)  8. Jesus knew all men (John 16:30)  9. Jesus is everywhere (Matt. 28:20)  10. Jesus Christ, dwells in you (Col. 1:27)  11. Jesus is the exact representation of the Nature of God (Heb. 1:3)  12. Jesus is eternal (Micah 5:1-2)  13. Jesus gives eternal life (John 10:27-28)  14. Jesus is our only Lord and Master (Jude 4)  15. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6)  16.

Jesus created all things (Col. 1:16-17), it is God who created all things  by Himself (Isaiah 44:24)  19. Jesus searches the hearts and minds of the people (Rev. 2:23)  20. Jesus is worshiped (Matt. 2:2-11; Matt.14:33; Matt.28:9; John 9:35-38;  Heb. 1:6) Only God can be worshipped (Matt. 4:10) (same Greek word for worship  is used in each place.)  21. In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts  7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father  that was seen in the OT (John 6:46). Who, then were they seeing? See John  8:58.  22. Jesus claimed the divine name, "I AM", for Himself in John 8:58 see  Exodus 3:14.  23.

But really, do some more research and expand your mind.

You CAN'T decide if you want to be gay or not.   The reason why it SEEMS, like some men "change" to homosexuals is, because they wait for the right moment to make their coming out. Many men are afraid to do so, because they have been taught, that homosexuality is something wrong. So they marry, get children... all that just to make it right for their family and the society. And then, maybe with 40 or 50, they figure out, that they don't want to lie to themselves for the rest of their lifes, so they make their coming out and LIVE their homosexuality.   This is the point. Just because you don't live and show that you are gay, doesn't mean that you are not gay!!    Homosexuality is a civil right, because every person has the right and freedom, to prefer, what he or she likes.  Or would you like somebody to force you, to be gay for the rest of your life???  Claiming that homosexuality isn't a civil right or even, that it isn't something normal, is just stupid, bad educated, terribly bad informed, and most of all, extremely narrow minded and intolerant.|`|gDEFlWnOaa	Your sexual orientation cannot be changed...|`|tBuvCsK9aa	The argument is over homosexuals HAVING civil rights, not BEING civil rights.

This is a farce and a lie supported by right-wing bible-thumping-speaking-in-tongues churches hoping to make easy $$$ off of scam ex-gay conversion camps run by motivational speaker-type charismatic preachers.  There have been many high profile cases of these so-called ex-gays coming out as really gay after the so-called "therapy".  More than one of them have been caught in gay bars.  Just look at Ted Haggard, President of the Evangelical Association.  He struggled to be str8 and live a lie for years only to be gay in secret the whole time.  The only people who become "str8" after this are those who were bisexual to start with or are living a lie.  If you were gay yourself you'd realize this and not make foolish assumptions.|`|p0zA0zyHaa	Homosexuality is a state of being.  It is not a right.

It doesn't change a person's sexual orientation. What it does do is make people feel guilty and ashamed of themselves. Not only is it ineffective in doing what it aims to do, but the damaging effects of reparative therapy are so severe that there is actually a new specialty emerging in the field of psychology that aims at treating these effects. There's a reason why every major psychological and medical association has condemned reparative therapy as the crock that it is.|`|w7Ej7KFhaa	You can't change your sexuality.

I want to come and explain a few things to you face to face, as you have been misled by someone who wants to control the things that you think about and do. If you can take the time to look in the biology section of your local library you will find the truth; that no one had any choice in the matter of their skin color or hair color or sexuality. Sure you can change the color of your hair, but it will still be the same color underneath or eventually it will grow out to be its original color. You can pretend that you have changed from homo to hetero, but sooner or later you will grow out of it and live your life as it was supposed to be lived. Roberto

7iEk06aDaa	If Jesus were here today, no doubt the first place he would stop is the Catholic Church. They've become a kingdom unto themselves.  They are everything that is against the teachings of Christ. They worship idols (statues of Mary, saints, Jesuit priests, etc..) They gamble in Gods house (bingo), They take vows of chastity and then molest our children ( Suffer the Little children to come unto me...) They make up their own versions of the bible even adding places such as purgatory. Where the heck did that come from?  Your so right about the Vatican.|`|FGcwxZz0aa	The Church preserves a great amount of art for the glory of God and benefit of mankind.The Church has little monetary wealth and infact usually operates at a deficit. The Church feeds, houses, educates, gives medical care and clothes more people than all the govenrnments, secular and religious groups. The wealth of the Church is in the people within the Church that give so generously to those in need around the world. Other ecclesiastical groups should be as generous to those in need. God bless!    In Christ  Fr. Joseph|`|LQQAQDkIaa	Jesus Himself told Judas when Judas whined about the expensive ointment being used on Christs feet Jesus said the poor will always be with us. He was right. The Vatican has been paid for for about 700 yrs. No more mortgage. The priceless art has been kept there for many generations of the faithful past and future to see, like a museum. . It is held in trust for the people. The Catholic Church is the biggest charitable organization in the world. The Vatican operates in the red almost all the time. There are 1.3billion Catholics in the world, and we all look to the Vatican. It is built over the sites of the execution of 2 of our Apostles, St Peter, and St Paul. Our history there is long, and filled with the defeats and victories of the ages. Would you truly suggest that we sell our birthright? In a moment, the money would be gone, and just like Christ told us 2000 yes ago, the poor would still be with us. I as a Catholic, feel no shame in the Vatican, or Her treasures that are in trust for all people. I take pride in the fact that my Church helps more of humanity than any other outfit out there, even govts. Do you know that many of these artworks were donated by Catholics to the Church? Do you know that artists like Michelangelo, DaVinci and many others contracted with the Church to create these works? They put their hearts and souls into their work for Holy Mother Church, to display for ever. Should we betray them? Do you think that the Church scoured Europe like the Nazis did, searching for valuables? It didn't happen that way. We would be poorer as a world if the Vatican was broken up and parceled out. What other institution on earth has the history we do? Certainly not the organizations of CJ and Selah. Pax Christi|`|51fe01ef6db0c1bd743afcb3e7a2e1ffaa	It's a reasonable question, though it could just as easily be applied to some of the protestant mega churches.    The wealth of the Church to which you refer is primarily in the form of works of art and manuscripts; there is very little cold hard cash setting around.    It's a vast organisation which requires a lot of money to run, to pay all the clergy and administration and buildings around the world... plus, they spend a great deal of wealth on charitable functions, which includes helping the poor, and helping them to help themselves.    Just because we don't hear about the enormous worldwide work which the RC Church does for the needy doesn't mean it isn't happening. The Catholic Church feeds, clothes, houses, medicates, counsels, and educates more children than any other non-governmental institution on this planet.    We are more likely to hear about the charitable work done by the wealthy American protestant churches who spend a lot of money on self-publicity in order to rake in even more cash.    The Vatican itself has a yearly budget that is equivalent to the Archdiocese of Chicago, and frequently runs on a deficit. The majority of the Church's "wealth" is tied up in real estate and in art work. These assets are "public wealth." They are open for all to visit and see, much like a public museum.     The Church could sell off all its art. These beautiful contributions to our faith and culture could be put in the back rooms of private collectors' studios. This would be comparable to Evangelicals closing down their recording studios, selling the recording equipment and stop making great Christian Music. We could redirect all this money to the poor. If the Church got fair market value for all its art and property there would be no more than a couple of dollars for each poor person in the world.     Tyndale, the largest Evangelical Bible College in Canada bought the 56 acre grounds of the Sisters of St. Joseph. It includes what they describe as "One of the most beautiful [Catholic Chapels] in Canada." These Evangelicals were happy to pay $40,000,000 for the property. Evangelicals are building big beautiful Churches as fast as they can get the money to build them. Catholics just have a 1700 year head start :-)    Catholics are not the only Christians who feel good art is valuable to the kingdom. Newsweek reports that the Evangelical Christian music industry sells over a billion dollars of artistic products every year (music, posters, movies etc).    Again, through its various arms (organizations such as Catholic Relief, Catholic Charities, the Sisters of the Poor, the Knights of Columbus, and the Saint Vincent dePaul Society, to name but a few) the Catholic Church is the largest non-governmental provider of relief to the poor in the world.|`|AA11440601	The mission of the Catholic Church is to proclaim and establish the Kingdom of God begun by Jesus Christ among all peoples. The Church endeavors to save souls.    Keeping the priceless art available at the Vatican in trust for all mankind to come, see, and inspire belief in the Kingdom of God is part of this mission.     The Church might be able to raise a couple of billion dollars by selling everything but that would soon be gone and the world would not be much better off. Especially if mankind does not change for the better.    Both the Old and New Testament says that it is the mission of all mankind (including you and me) to love our neighbors as much as we love ourselves. It is our job to stop poverty and create justice and peace.     If every human being on the planet gave $10 then $60 billion would be raised.     If the one billion people in the richest countries gave one $100 each then $100 billion would be raised.     Not only do these riches make the Vatican art collections look paltry, this is only a fraction of what can really be raised if people got their priorities straight.    You and I and the rest of humanity can do much much more to "help people" than the Vatican can all by itself.    We need to stop making excuses for our selfishness by pushing the blame on to the Catholic Church.    By the way, the Catholic Charities worldwide distribute billions of dollars in goods and services each year to the needy and have been doing so for well over a thousand years.    Oh, and lets not forget that the Vatican has the ultimate responsibility for the lifelong support of over 400,000 priests, over 54,000 religious brothers, and over 760,000 religious sisters worldwide. http://cara.georgetown.edu/bulletin/inde...

Eze 28:14 Thou [art] the anointed cherub that covereth; and I have set thee [so]: thou wast upon the holy mountain of God; thou hast walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire.

Yes the Church has valuable paintings and works of art, BUT the church does not own these valuable pieces, they were all donated or given as gifts to the church and they belong to the world. Yes the Catholic Church is the biggest charity in the world. They provide clothing and food and shelter,medical care, education, to millions of people thru out the world every single day. How is this done? By donations from it's members. If the catholic Church were to sell everything in its possessions who would buy it? How long would that money last ,a week , a month?

Most parents 'just know' somehow. On the other hand, whether they choose to deny it or not is a different story.  It'll come as a shock at first, but when they think about it, they'll find it was kind of obvious.|`|w7Ej7KFhaa	If they don't want to accept it they'll turn a blind eye, that's what my girlfriend's mom does. It's better for them to ignore a situation than to deal with it. My mom however asked me before I was even sure myself...but I'd tell people I was a little boy named Ralph when I was 2, so I guess she had time to warm up to the idea.|`|Idb89cCeaa	Can't speak for most people but mine acted shocked when I told them I was gay. It caused friction for a bit but they came around after a bit.|`|FCRGHlicaa	No, they most definitely do NOT know that their kids are gay!!! My parents were completely shocked, even though i had thought it was obvious for years, lol
wrmiIMRdaa	thats ignorant of your friends to say..how rude..and its a stupid myth.|`|FYaZutedaa	Its just a myth. It is bad luck. But you cant expect someone to die again!|`|d3VV4b6vaa	I don't believe in that at all. death comes, period.|`|hQWucH5uaa	Because it does seem to happen.  <br>  <br>  I remember when Mamma Cass, Jimi Hendrix, and Janis Joplin all died young and within a short time of each other.<br>  <br>  Then you had JFK, Martin Luther King, and Bobby Kennedy murdered within memory of each other (I remember these murders also).|`|sOoz0Fduaa	The saying isn't about death, it's "bad things happen in threes." You're probably confused with the Three Fates, Greece's version of Grim Reapers.|`|I8fNn4G9aa	<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wM6kppDtADY&feature=channel_page" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wM6kppDtA...</a>|`|mjQhyQktaa	I do believe that's bad luck, not death, and both are ridiculous myths.|`|Nuu5zUWuaa	its a stupid myth, death doesnt come in any number, death is infinite
NoZAofgOaa	Yes, i watched that movie too, i thought that was horribly un necessary.    my only advice is for you to make her watch the movie.  hopefully she will come around, at least maybe the movie will help.|`|XnNT4l0Xaa	Mom's are more emotional and they're the ones who look out for you more and want more for your future, I think. But personaly, I think Dad's are more unconvincing.|`|ZSlXrXsCaa	It is probably more personal for her considering she gave birth to you, she probably wasn't expecting her daughter to be bi, and is having  a hard time accepting it.|`|TLOgBy3caa	The Legend of a Woman's fury.  No, kidding, um. 'cause they're more emotional and more idealistic, apparently. When someone ruins their perfect little life plan, they go ballistic.   I dunno really, I just wanted something to do so I decided to answer you question.|`|QeTPWhf7aa	my mom is the same also :o|`|Q5cEmhDEaa	Mums have this perfect idealistic view of how their children should be. She wants you to grow up according to societies expectations. She'll get over it. Church cant change people.|`|AA10723657	mothers just want the best for their kids and want to see the grand kids coming so if you are gay they are thinking to them selves no grand kids not good which is not fair either|`|3dAhyHMaaa	OHHH|`|a22TvtfMaa	I think it depends on the gender of the kid sometimes. Trust me, dads can be just as bad!|`|w7Ej7KFhaa	I asked my mom when she calmed down, and basically she said that she had expectations when she had me of what her life would entail. Weddings with a dress for me, and stuff like that. It's just when you change someone's expectations it's hard. Also, they think they know best, and with anything it takes time.|`|4pZxnpVkaa	Women are generally more emotional and will take things more personally than men.  Men see things as more factual.  My mom cried when i told her, but thank god I lucked out in life and I have a very accepting family.  Its just the way women's minds work i guess.|`|Iy36xZMOaa	i think a lot of mothers just want their kids to have happy, regular lives with a husband or wife and kids.  they don't want their kids to be out of the ordinary and be gay.  it is not "normal" to them.  my mom accepts me as lesbian, although it took her awhile to accept it, but i still think she believes it's a little strange.    you just have to believe in yourself, make new friends and love your mom and accept it might take some time for her to be ok with it.  she might not ever fully accept it and you have to learn to live with that and move on in your life.|`|nsZuZ1O9aa	Dads can be just as bad. One of my gay friends dad won't even look him in the eye because he's so ashamed. It's terrible how one day your parents will be saying "we'll always love you no matter what." then when you tell them one simple truth about yourself they don't even want to be related to you anymore.
o0Jdcev3aa	Sen oradayken Istanbul'a gittim (ben).|`|XvWotokIaa	Agree with Sepsal: she is right.    Just oradayken is written as one word, not two.|`|FLLoVSlMaa	"Sen oraday ken , ben Istanbul'a gittim "|`|JfzUfSo5aa	the orginal one should be "Sen orda iken , ben istanbul'a gittim."  But "iken" can be joined to words as in second answer ;  "orda iken"= "ordayken"  then we may say "sen ordayken, ben istanbul'a gittim"    as in english , turkish has its own "Time Conjunctions"  -iken  = while
EtCRnDJMaa	I started by asking my Google search tab for the answers I needed.      sounds funny!  it's true!    when i did that, it sometimes would show me similar question as mine and then I would go see what it was.  This is how I started YA.  I went to the R&S section for my Bible lessons. My parents never taught us anything about Religion or the Bible growing up.    I also go to the parenting section, fitness, & poltics.  R&S tops my list.  Politics is a fun place too!!!|`|agW17i4Kaa	I use it to pass the time at work.|`|XxDQGEalaa	Of course. How horrid that would be to remain in a constant  Atheist/Christian cage match. Some categories are quite serene and thoughtful.....but it is fun to check out the Colosseum once and a while.|`|e4yczpKsaa	Yeah, I like the Jokes and Riddles section and the Mythology and Folklore section but, nothing beats the thrill of proving people wrong.|`|3ZgOAUOTaa	i wouldn't trust any answer on y!a...|`|n3Rx3PYyaa	.  I've asked questions and used "search" feature for answers regarding . . .  ...taxes and real estate, housing economy, family after divorce, car tires and engine, movies, relationships, spiritual experiences, dreams, etc.  Mostly "hang out" in R&S section though.    Haven't used YahooAnswers to purposefully "spar" with others...Though have seen some questions and added edits that show "sparring" dialog.  Their pretty easy to spot though, so just skip past them.  .|`|3oCdTWYZaa	Yes, because I use other sections than R&S.|`|wtg8vtzBaa	I dispense my knowledge of Womens Health on a regular basis.|`|1TYZDRUqaa	There's other things on Y!A besides R&S?  Blasphemy!!|`|J7KSKm54aa	I only play in the R&S section- the other sections could not possibly be as fun as this one.|`|VFmmVHGVaa	Yes Im always seeking knowledge.  t|`|HWoLbR7Aaa	I sometimes give serious answers in the Pets - Rodents section.  But mostly I'm just a smartass in R&S.|`|5dd8eBDYaa	Politics on occasion, for sparring.    P+S, for honing my sarcasm skills.    Motorcycles, because British bikes have SOUL.    Photography, because it used to be my profession.|`|jRcdbna5aa	Sometimes, I do look up information.  I've even asked a couple of questions to other groups.  Primarily, however, I do it to spar here in R&S. :0)|`|XeiTdhyUaa	Computer and Internet->Security  Computer and Internet->Software    Its fun, really|`|c1wCuGzpaa	yeppers. And to help those out there that need me.|`|a375l0D7aa	I pretty much use the R&S Section not for sparring, or for getting information, but for sharing information and helping others come to the Truth.|`|fJ1dII6oaa	I use it for the laughs. fireball, losasha, and jayden's mommy do that part. hahaha I love the fundies! (:(:|`|8nKyRiahaa	Yes I do, and besides that this place is hilarious!|`|urQQ6kbcaa	I come here to have a laugh & to give my knowledge if it's required|`|TEaFwk1Baa	You can't really spar in the Science sections.  I'm all like, intelligent design, but they just want to say things like mesozoic and paleolithic and things like that.|`|mFy3M8mVaa	Mostly I use Y!A to answer questions...because I'm a nerd and that is fun to me.  I frequent the Zoology, Pets (Reptiles, Fish and Other Pets) sections as well as R&S.|`|Hjwp1yGWaa	Yes, doesn't everyone, I have not posted many questions, but I have posted them and got legitimate answers, if you are just doing this for mischief than you have bigger issues than you realize.  I mainly post to see perspective other than my own, so I can evaluate my own perspective, to see if it is a common perspective or not.|`|AA11430900	Yes.    I've used the military category to get explanations of certain rankings that my ancestors held.  I will ask and answer in genealogy.|`|WCo25oFmaa	Yes, I ask how to work my gadgets, because I fail at that.      But i come here for the good laughs.|`|b2dUtX0raa	I do the main pages too, but I usually check back on R&S and Homework Help most often.|`|IbtQ5IKNaa	Oh man was it ever big too... we had to drag it for miles and miles.    Did I ever tell you the story? Man, those where the days. Whats that sparring, is that like a bird? I'll have to check with the manual on that one.  Search? I don't remember going to far to call it a search. You mean a peak of interest?    Topics? Is that what this is a whole group smashed into one topic?  I don't know, thats why we are here, to know something like you said, get some better information than what we have already been given, right?    What did that snap something in your neck, because I think I heard it pop all the way over here.|`|AA11149408	Mostly, I look for questions that I can answer, sometimes, I just want to defend someone or to argue the 'other point'.  I have asked less than  50 questions in my 3 years here, but I did receive good answers.  Each question resulted in food for thought.|`|i81cQUyhaa	Yes I've learned alot on Yahoo Answers. Theres alot of smart People on this site|`|8eeKI0h0aa	Hi Moose,        I have asked specific questions but I usually just answer some questions either to help with something specific, or just to air an opinion. hey did ya get that book?|`|sz33MLTsaa	Yes. For answers. Specifically JW's...or ex-JW's.    What's sad is most of the trolls are hollywood educated.
14pjwQPLaa	"Looking forward to class tomorrow . . ."    If she's blind, she's quite used to colloquial speech such as "see you tomorrow", or "do you see what I mean?".  I highly doubt she'd be offended.  Besides, you are saying that YOU will see HER tomorrow -- which is technically exactly true.  You aren't saying, "You'll see ME tomorrow!".|`|nVfN8usNaa	Ehrm...

VDrNhLMPaa	Bsm Allah Al rahman Al rahiem ( in name of Allah )<br>  <br>  Lets ask our selves some Questions and answer them to logically find out the answer of that question for all Muslims and non Muslims.<br>  <br>  as an introduction, you may would like to know that:<br>  <br>  - Prophet Mohamed SAW married 12 woman. and he died while he had 10 women. as in his life Alsayedah Khadijah and Zaynab bent Khozaymah (RAA) died.<br>  <br>  their names are listed in other answers. ( so no need to repeat them i think.)<br>  <br>  Now ... lets start the Questions:<br>  <br>  How many virgins and non virgins did he marry?<br>  ---- Only One of them was virgin, Al sayedah Ayeshaa, and the rest were non versions.<br>  <br>  ***************<br>  Was they all Arabians from gulf ?<br>  --- Yes , they were Except Sayedah Mareyah as she was Egyptian.<br>  <br>  **************<br>  Were they all Muslims?<br>  --- Yes, except 2 of them , Sayedah safeyah she was Jewish , and sayedah mareyah, she was Christian.<br>  <br>  ***************<br>  <br>  Was those marriages for a sexual reason ?<br>  <br>  if we looked through the prophet's marriages we would find that passion for sex has disappeared. and here is the logical reasons:<br>  1) Prophet Mohamed SAW was single till 25 years old.<br>  2) From 25 till he became 50 years old ( his very youth years ) he married Only sayedah Khadiejah , Who was 15 years older than him, and was married to 2 men before him and has children.<br>  3) From 50 - 52 he didn't marry because of his sadness and loyalty for his first wife.<br>  4) From 52-60 years old he married many times for  * POLITICAL , RELIGIOUS and SOCIAL reasons. ( i shall show them, later ) <br>  <br>  ***************<br>  so .. is it logical to have sexual appeal in a surprising way by 52 years old ??!!! and is it logical for a man who loves to marry women to marry in his real youth years from a non virgin that married twice before him and marry her 25 years without marrying ANY other woman beside her, and stay 2 years with no marriage due to being so loyal to her??? !!!<br>  <br>  Besides, The first marriage after Sayedah Khadijah was to Sayedah Sawdah , and she was 80 years old ... it the reason was that she was the first Widow in Islam, so Prophet Mohamed SAW wanted to honor her and women like her, so he began with him self and didn't ask/order any of his followers ( sahabah ) to marry her , but he did honor her him self to let this humanistic action be taken as a good example after him.<br>  <br>  So ... we can conclude that :<br>  The Prophet SAW married in 2 ways<br>  1) Mohamed the man ( married khadijah )<br>  2) Mohamed the Prophet ( married the rest of his wives )<br>  <br>  ***************<br>  Lets ask our selves ... Is Prophet Mohamed the only prophet to have multiple wives?<br>  <br>  No, he wasn't the only one ... other prophets also had multiple wives<br>  such as :<br>  Prophet Ibrahim , Soliman and  Dawoud Peace be Upon All of them.<br>  <br>  ***************<br>  Now let's mention the POLITICAL , RELIGIOUS and SOCIAL reasons for multiple wives :<br>  <br>  First reason:<br>   Bequeath to the call of Islam and the exact details and privacy ( like Prayers and its movements)<br>  so there should come people to his house to transmit the required details to let the Muslims Learn.<br>  So Allah wanted by the prophet's marriage to sayedah Ayieshah as she was young to learn alot from him as she was young (  Education at a young age is as Engraving in a stone  [ an Arabian proverb] )<br>  and she lived 42 years after his death spreading knowledge.and she was the most knowing one with each Fariedah and Nafielah [sunnah].<br>  <br>  The total number of Hadith narrated by the prophet's wives is 3000 Hadith.<br>  <br>  Concerning his marriage to Sayedah Ayieshah while she was young, it was the nature of the desert environment that the girls be adults ( have monthly period ) quickly and the young marriage was familiar not only to Arabs but to the Roman and Persian as well.<br>  <br>  Second reason:<br>  Consolidate the relationship between the prophet and networking leading to the consolidation of the nation.<br>  <br>  As he SAW married daughter of Abu Bakr, and sister of Omar Bin Al Khattab<br>  And two of his daughters to marry saydna Osman<br>  And his third girl to sayedna Ali<br>  ( May Allah be pleased with them all and "ardahm" [let them be pleased as well] )<br>  <br>  Third reason:<br>  Mercy with widows, where the prophet SAW married widows (Sayedah Sawdah, Umm Salamah and Umm Habiba)<br>  <br>  Fourth reason:<br>  <br>  The completion of legislation of Islam where the Prophet of Islam do things himself to be role model for Muslims after him.<br>  Whether by honoring widows or Being merciful with converters to Islam Like his marriage to Safeyah after her father's conversion to Islam and honoring them in front of all Jews.<br>  <br>  Fifth reason:<br>  <br>  Love of the Prophet to hold the links between all the countries of the Earth<br>  His marriage of Sayedah Maria ( the Egyptian ) was aimed to constitute the entire country<br>  The Prophet peace be upon him married Sayedah jouayreah so that the Bani Almstaleg would convert to Islam.<br>  Where they were prisoners of the Muslims,after the invasion of Almstaleg and the story is well known .<br>  <br>  *****|`|IYQbl1bSaa	Prophet Muhammad had that many wives to HELP THEM.<br>  Every wife he has, is because they needed help in some way, whether it be financial or just support.<br>  I don't remember the exact number he had, but I think it was 9?<br>  <br>  And no, the Prophet(PBUH) did not rape anyone.<br>  Get your facts straight before saying anything.<br>  Ignorant morons.|`|UibsALccaa	He had 12 wifes:<br>  <br>  -Khadija Bint Khuwaylid<br>  -Sawada Bint Zam'a<br>  - A'isha Bint Abu Bakr<br>  -Hafsa Bint 'Umar<br>  -Zaynab Bint Khuzayma<br>  -Ummay Salama Hind Bint Abu Umayya<br>  -Zaynab Bint Jahsh<br>  -Juwayria Bint Al-Haritha<br>  -Umm Habiba Ramla Bint Abu Sufyan<br>  -Maria Bint Shamoun<br>  -Safya Bint Huyayya<br>  -Maymuna Bint Al-Haritha<br>  <br>  Most of these married where done to help the women because they were in need.|`|qPSkkPqwaa	It was order of Allah and it was to set example to the Arabs that you can have widows as wives and non virgin wives...After all is order of Allah taken lightly?|`|uzBQCXw6aa	I SHAL  TEL YOU IM A MOSLIM  OUR PROPET SAW JUST HAD THOSE WIFS  BEGUASE HE WANTED TO PROTEGT THOSE GIRLS<br>  HE WAS A GOOD MAN  HOPELY THIS EXPLANS YOU A LITLE|`|Ipheh638aa	not sure, but i  sure wouldnt mind being his next|`|7dGpL4mSaa	I think 9. I'm not sure. I'll check in a second.<br>  <br>  <br>  According to my research, 9 insha'allah!|`|IxoBFCpTaa	?Allaah states that the Prophet sallallaahu 'alayhi wasalam was given a special privilege. Notice in this verse:<br>  <br>  Ahzab {33:52}<br>  ((O Prophet! surely We have made lawful to you your wives whom you have given their dowries, and those whom your right hand possesses out of those whom Allah has given to you as prisoners of war, and the daughters of your paternal uncles and the daughters of your paternal aunts, and the daughters of your maternal uncles and the daughters of your maternal aunts who fled with you; and a believing woman if she gave herself to the Prophet, if the Prophet desired to marry her-- specially for you, not for the (rest of) believers; We know what We have ordained for them concerning their wives and those whom their right hands possess in order that no blame may attach to you; and Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.))<br>  <br>  Prophet had 12 wives:<br>  <br>  1.

4WqvTAfmaa	There are specialists who study these things, and they have classified several types of events. Some are displaced, old business to take care of and not ready to move on. Some just want to say they are ok, but end up appearing in the state of decomposition that their body is in. (This one is a good argument for cremation). Some are not souls per se, but rather horrific emotions that have impressed on objects or places, that still echo in our psyche.    Remember, there is more to this world than fits within most of our philosophies.|`|AA10746826	An untimely, harsh death. Something brutal and horrific maybe. And if the person isn't put to rest properly.....it's all wacky!!! There aren't ghosts!!! They are myths just like unicorns and fairies and crap like that. Some people actually took it literally one day and just got caught up in the lie....our mind plays tricks on us when we are looking for something that not there.|`|CKHzrI7Waa	Unfinished business of course.
jRcdbna5aa	When I was stationed in San Diego, there was an awesome deli less than 100 ft away from my apartment.  The guy was Muslim, made the absolute BEST pizza in San Diego, always had my favorite cigars and beer stocked, and was in all other ways, a great guy.    Now, for the rest of your issues.  First, ignore the famous ones.  They are not you-you are you.  In what ways do you feel you are being punished?  Is there possibly a more natural explanation for it (for example, did you not get a promotion at work because the person they gave it to was more qualified?).      Even when I was a Christian, I knew that not every tiny detail was controlled by either God or Satan.  Most things really do have natural causes, even in your own life.  Examine what has happened to you that you consider "suffering".  See if there are possible natural causes for these.  Are the things that caused them within your ability to fix?    If they are in your ability, make a plan for how you can fix them.  Take my promotion example.  If you didn't get the promotion because you lack certain qualifications, what do you need to do to get them?  Are there classes you can take?  Is there someone specific who needs to train you?    Your life is yours.  You have control over it, even if you are submitting it to God.  Don't just give up and say, "God must be punishing me."  Look for ways to make things better that are within our own power.  Like the old saying goes-God helps those who help themselves.|`|7J1D1IyRaa	In logic, it's called "Hasty Generalization."

4WqvTAfmaa	Here is my experience. Yes, it is real.    A family used one, and got results. They were typical results: the spirit that they ended up with was a tough bully who pushed everyone (spirits) else away. He was also bullying the people using the board. I was one of two people called in to fix things.     The spirit resisted our getting rid of it. It liked playing with the family. I mean, playing nasty hurtful jokes on them. Most of the spirits I have run across on Ouija boards are like this, although occasionally a nice but lost one comes around. Anyway, we had to sear the connection between the Ouija board and the platen, the part that moves. We also had to do some fairly strong banishing and cleansing to get rid of the spirit, and to clear the house.     People are so fascinated with contacting ghosts, the dead, that they forget, assh**s and idiots in life get no smarter or nicer when trapped for years in the betweens. If anything, they get stupider, meaner, and more hurtful.     And that, my friend, is why they are not for innocent beginners.|`|1cGlucXyaa	don't do it.|`|d78420f6881261db90170d41d16536a0aa	Well, you can find it in the toy department, because it's a toy.|`|aEdkaXmtaa	ideometer effect look it up...im tired of these dumbasses saying it's evil|`|5tMCDu8gaa	It's just a game that people have assigned a superstitious value to.|`|9Dq2176oaa	The Ouija BoardHow Can It Affect You?

During the following six years Americans purchased some ten million Ouija boards, which, in turn, lured an estimated twenty million persons to try them out. They are also popular in other countries.    What is the Ouija board? Why does it attract so many people? If you were to use it, how could the Ouija board affect you?    What Is the Ouija Board?    The Ouija board, about two feet long, a foot and a half wide and a quarter of an inch thick, contains on its surface the letters of the alphabet in two arcs, one under the other. Below these in a straight line from left to right are the numbers 1 to 9 and 0. Underneath the numerals is the phrase Good Bye. In the top left corner is the word Yes, and in the top right corner No.    Upon the polished surface of this board rests a small heart-shaped indicator mounted on three felt-tipped pegs with a transparent disk toward its pointed end. Usually two persons place their hands lightly on the indicator and ask questions of the board. In many cases the indicator moves from letter to letter spelling out words and sentences in answer to the questions. Sometimes the answers are amazingly accurate, even foretelling events that actually take place.    A Result of the Subconscious?    What makes the indicator on a Ouija board scurry back and forth spelling out messages? Is it due to the subconscious of the person (or persons) working the board, as some have suggested?    Evidence indicates otherwise, for information received through the Ouija board often is not and could not be known or produced by the person operating it. Russell Chandler, religion writer for the Los Angeles Times, explains: A reporter tried unsuccessfully to get any of three physicists queried at Caltech in Pasadena to offer a scientific explanation for Ouija power.    What Makes It Work?    The Bible, however, sheds light on what makes the mysterious Ouija board work. How so?    As a way of probing into the unknown, the Ouija board is a form of divination. The Bible, at 1?Samuel 15:23, places divination parallel with the use of uncanny power. Many who use the Ouija board attest to acquiring psychic ability, a truly uncanny, mysterious power that enables them to know things about other persons and events without using normal means of communication. What could be behind that power?    The Bible book of Acts of the Apostles pinpoints the source of a certain servant girls ability to predict the future as being a spirit, a demon of divination. When the apostle Paul ordered the spirit to come out of her, she lost her power of prediction. (Acts 16:16-19) Could the Ouija board, too, involve wicked spirits, or demons? Consider some effects of its use.    Some researchers warn, observes Russell Chandler, that the game can lure the susceptible into the weird world of spirit communicationeven demonic possession. Harold Sherman, president of the ESP Research Associates Foundation in Little Rock, Arkansas, observes: The majority who have become involved with possessive and other spirit entities came by this experience through the Ouija board.    Writer Alan Vaughan, who never had a psychic experience until the age of twenty-eight and had been skeptical about such things, relates what happened to him:    It began on November 7, 1965, when I was trying out a newly purchased Ouija board to amuse a friend convalescing from an operation. .?.?. Spirits began to appear on the board. One, who called himself Z, answered our questions accurately and with a peculiarly old-fashioned vocabulary.    Later, I began to experiment alone with the Ouija and soon found myself possessed by a rather neurotic personality who called herself Nada. .?.?. But then, both to my fascination and fear, Nada got inside my head. I could hear her voice repeating the same phrases over and over again. .?.?. I took my Ouija to visit a friend to investigate further what was happening. I felt the presence of Z and across the room my friend announced that the pointer was starting to move. It went to Z and then spelled out a message: Awful consequencespossession. At that point I became alarmed, for it had not occurred to me that having a strange voice in ones head was tantamount to possession.    A Pennsylvania woman tells of an experience in her family as a result of using a Ouija board:    It told us many lies but it also told us many things which were true. .?.?. Then one night when we were all in bed, my mother was having her usual bedtime snack before turning in. All of a sudden we heard a crash, a yell and a cat hissing and spitting and running like mad around the kitchen. When we got up to see what was wrong, w|`|Ze2MlcTUaa	OUI MEANS YES IN FRENCH JA MEANS YES IN GERMAN.....BUT THE BOARD IS AS POWERFUL AS YOUR IMAGINATION|`|Tledw3eAaa	It's a fun game until it works.

The Inquisitions in itself wasn't a bad thing. The Church never condoned the torture and abuse of people brought into the Tribunal Courts. What most people overlook is that in many countries it was the law of the monarchs that their people be Catholic. When Protestantism was created, many monarchs imprisioned those who were not Catholic.    The famous Spanish Inquisition was ran by Isabelle and Ferdinand. The Church sent many missives telling them to stop their torture and murder of these people as that was not God's way. Yes, the Church has apologized for the abuse those people faced, but again, the Church did not condone it.     And as for our "infamous perverted pedophiles"...We have the LOWEST percentage of convicted priests than any religion. 1.3% of priests were arrested between 1960 and today, 1.3% and less than that were actually convicted of crimes.    The Methodist Church has stated they have a larger problem than the Catholic Church. The Church of Christ has been found to have the highest amount of pedophiles throughout the U.S. The HIGHEST. And yet the news didn't call that a "crisis".     Jesus promised that "the gates of Hell would not prevail" against the Church. He did not promise that those gates wouldn't prevail against people. I stay true to His Church and I will remain so that I might bring back some of her glory, I will not abandon her when she is in need of true Catholics.|`|AA11796124	Consider yourself reported, and thanks for the two points.|`|d0MIgl38aa	TOOL who understands nothing, and uses other peoples words as his own|`|lWy5M1x9aa	Despite the fact that I agree with many of your points, Yahoo Answers is not the place for trying to get people to agree with your rants.|`|qJkRPhIKaa	first never use religion/church and common sense in the same sentence.

They are more interested in having  the religion or the religious form than having the true spirit of Christ.  They go through this daily repetitive ritual that they have had memorized all of their lives that when they say it and do it its  not genuine because it doesnt come from the heart yet they think  it makes them religious which being religious what is that without  the spirit of God? I would rather have the Spirit of God active in my  life and not be religious. Being religious is what caused them to  murder individuals over the centuries many for not accepting their  doctrine of the Virgin.Its the same religion that twisted the cross on  Hitler's Nazi Emblems, its the same religion that Bishops kept  trying to shuffle Priests from place to place to cover up their sins  as they harmed the multitudes of  the innocent.

If you read your European history, you will find that secular govts. handled much of the inquisitions. The Church conducted their trials, about 500 yrs ago, but secular govt. took it from there. The priest scandals would never have happened if the Church had not ordained gay priests. They took the priestly vow of celibacy, and preyed on our children. Seems to me to be a gay issue, but we all know we can't say anything about them. Then we would be "homophobic, or bigots, or haters or whatever other psycho babble term you want to throw out there. So, the Church is blamed. The Church was castigated for not ordaining gay men, then when She did, She is castigated for their predatory actions. Our dogma is the teachings of Jesus Christ, and His chosen Apostles. Nothing more, or less. It is not ridiculous, and it has lost no common sense.

Fr5xabUmaa	I'm a speech pathologist and I'm curious what other language you speak? It's possible that when you speak English, it is being effected by the other language.     I would not consider it a speech disorder, but instead it is a speech difference. If you spoke only English and you had trouble producing some of the sounds, then you would have a speech problem. Right now it sounds like you have an accent, which is typical for someone who learned English after they learned another language. Bilingual people sometimes have trouble with learning the pronunciation of another language if they learned it in later in childhood and beyond.    I think you could benefit from accent modification services. Basically that is speech therapy for people you have accents. You can contact a local university to see if they have a speech clinic (where they train master-level speech pathologists) that has an accent modification/reduction program. They would offer services at a reduced cost. Otherwise you can open your phone book and look under speech/language services. Look for an ASHA-certified speech pathologist who can help you learn how to pronounce those sounds correctly. Good luck.|`|0n5zMFg5aa	Is English you first language?

With the Peace Corps, they basically look for volunteers based on the projects that they have going in any given country. So I would imagine you would be a good candidate for projects in public health or health education, while your husband would be suited for construction or skilled trade training - related projects. In either case, I think what matters is your willingness to use your skills in different capacities - like in training or developing programs to train people in your areas of expertise.    To answer your question, you are qualified and ultimately will have to go through the whole gamut of interviews and health testing (in my experience the medical testing/clearance takes a bit longer than all the other stuff).     As you know, it's a two-year commitment and that can seem like a little or a lot depending on your perspective.

ZRiIBPrQaa	I am definately for it. Love is love, no matter what.    It really annoys me how people against gay marriage always bring up religious beliefs as reasons to why it should be banned. I am personally a very religious person, but not everyone shares the same beliefs. Not everyone believes that God made marriage between man and woman. Not everyone even has a religion or higher power they believe in. So why should we deprive others of marriage because of beliefs they don't even have?    Plus, it's extremely discriminant of some people who are against gays to judge them so harshly. Shouldn't people be able to like/love who they want without being judged? Seriously, for people to hate gays because they like the same sex is just wrong. I once had an arguement with a guy about gay marriage. He said that it was 'gross' and 'wrong' for guys to like other guys. Well, if he and other prejudice people think being gay is wrong, then it's a good thing they aren't, huh? Really, they should start worrying about themselves instead of other people.|`|iNojIEt2aa	FOR!!!    I believe everyone has a right to get married. who cares if your 2 guys, 2 girls or a guy and girl.

(I'm not trying to preach.)|`|Qswzc6w7aa	I totally agree with it. I'm straight and I am so for it.

JTkFxYxfaa	It says "the slope changes".  You'll see, in Spanish the word "cuesta" has several meanings, one of them is "slope/hill" (either down or uphill).  When you say that something is going downhill for you (in Spanish, of course) then you mean by that that it's taking so much more work to be done or achieved than you expected, i.e., that it keeps getting harder and harder to complete or that it's each time closer to hit rock bottom.  So, if the slope changes then it means totally the opposite. Things are, metaphorically, going smoothly uphill for you.    e.g.  Mi reputacin va cuesta abajo.  Lit. My reputation is just going downhill.    I can't really think of an appropriate saying in English equivalent to that one right now, but it pretty much means what I just said.    Hope it helps.|`|8usxEMNeaa	I have never heard that expression before, but "a cuestas" would be like burdening yourself with whatever you're doing.    "La cuesta cambia." would translate as "The slope changes."|`|jQIGk39vaa	"to move mountains"? Cuesta means slope,hill etc. and cambia(r) means "to move".    my Spanish is rusty!|`|FEGtnUEcaa	I am Spanish and never heard that expression.

c23478f3a6f6ccbb83145c92645bca1aaa	i didn't goto your sites but.... why is it okay that you don't believe in the Word/Scripture but it's not okay for someone to believe in your ways?  I have wonderful friends who are gay. I love them dearly, however they know that I pray they find peace in themselves.|`|QLDMmp6Taa	I'm Catholic, and if the pope puts out a public opinion about something, it's not infallible...it's just his opinion.  I never really listen much to public comments and stuff of that nature anyway.  I read the bible, I have read the catechism (which is the book that teaches what we believe) and I study the history of the Church.  Unless he has something infallible to say, I don't really pay that much attention.  I have not heard anything about the pope complaining about people getting human rights...that doesn't sound inline with the Catholic Church's teaching and views, so I seriously doubt this is true.      And too the guy above who said something about being outspoken...not sure why you think negatively of that.  We need someone that is outspoken.  I'm so sick and tired of people acting like everyone has to tiptoe around them because they might get offended.  We're turning into a bunch of cry babies in this world.      Don't wish me luck...I have Jesus and I don't need your luck.    EDIT:  Okay, I read the article now.  My opinion is this:  The Church is not going to change so that men can do as they please and receive approval from God.  I'm with the bishop on this one, and I stand by what I said before.  I still don't see how the article had anything to do with denying someone basic human rights.  The church isn't trying to kill gays or put them in jail or anything.  Looked to me they were just saying, 'You don't like what we teach, leave, and quit crying and screaming that you want change, because it's never going to happen here.'-- and I agree.|`|XxDQGEalaa	I'm sure they must see it as condoning sin rather than outright oppression. By the way, if it is a sin, then it's their sin and not a threat to those that think otherwise. We should learn to be more loving and less judgmental.|`|2SNRIRrbaa	I tried clicking on the article.. but there was an "error".     But to your last statement, most catholics have nothing against gay people. They just don't allow them to marry in a catholic church. The bible states that marriage is meant for a man and a women. Not two women, or two men.   They are following their bible, their religion.   Just because they will not marry a gay couple doesn't mean they don't give gay people the human rights they deserve.|`|Iea4UeItaa	Catholics aren't the only ones with leaders that discriminate in the name of religion.    You will find many Catholics do not agree with the Pope and will follow their hearts.|`|i6Mi8uWIaa	The link didn't work, so I can't give you my opinion on the article.    Now, regarding the UN's statement about gays, lesbians, bisexuals, and transgendered people and the Vatican "complaining" about it.     I haven't read any articles about the issue you raise, but I can make an educated guess that the Vatican reitirated its position that homosexuality is a sinful behavior.     We Catholics do not deny people basic human rights. Basic human rights include a right to life, to freedom to live without harming others, to property, and to basic necessities such as food, water, clothing, and shelter, as well as a basic dignity as human beings. We believe that ALL people deserve these rights and that they are inalienable.    However, we do still view homosexual behavior as a sin, as outlined in the Bible. We also do not view things such as marriage as a right. Marriage is a sacrament, not a basic inalienable human right. God meant it to be between one man and one woman. In case you haven't noticed, we also frown on divorce, abortion, birth control, drunkeness, lies, premarital sex,and basically anything that involves breaking any of the ten commandments or committing one of the seven deadly sins.     People do not hate us because we deny others basic human rights. In fact, we are the leaders in ENSURING that all have basic human rights.     No, people hate us because we still follow the words of Christ and continue to live as He taught.|`|sz33MLTsaa	This new improved Pope is their leader. He's very vocal.    Best of luck to the Catholics. :(|`|dCLnLlsCaa	I was raised Catholic, however I don't practice it because I don't believe in organized religion, I feel it separates people and I don't feel like I need a priest, pastor, or whoever telling me what and how to believe.  I believe in Love above all and love of ALL people, not just some.  If more people in this world practiced love and would stop judging others they don't understand we would live in a much more peaceful world.  That all being said, it's also not right to discriminate against Catholics as a whole.  I live in San Francisco and there is a parish here that welcomes ALL people and respects everyone and loves everyone for who they are.  They have bbqs and events specifically for the LBGT community.  So just because someone chooses to practice a certain religion, it does not mean they are hateful like the vatican.

Have a happy valentines day!!|`|SbZ71ME4aa	It all depends on what he likes! For my guys birthday, I had golf balls custom made for him that said Happy Birthday Brady! Love, Eleni He loves them!! You can get a lot of different sports equipment or t-shirts customized for them at different websites like ziplinegolf.com or through google!    Also you could try personalized boxers, polos, or cuff links at personalizationmall.com, its a great website! Ive also found Ralph Lauren and Express have some great mens clothing. Another idea is cologne* or a nice watch**, maybe engraved with a loving message on the back!    Soapcard.com is a cool website where you can customize bars of soap and have images and cute messages printed on them. At American Eagle or ae.com they have adorable red heart boxers, those are what I got my boyfriend for Valentines Day! And dont forget a nice card with a loving note written inside.     Hope this helps you out!    *May I suggest Ralph Lauren Black or Abercrombie & Fitch fierce?  **Kay Jewelers carries Citizen, Sieko, and many other watch brands for as low as $100.

The best site to start with for real vampire research is Saguinarius.org. Email me if you want more real vamp sites.     I figure if someone is a Twilight-obessed wannabe, they ask at Y!A if vampires are real. If they're really going through a vampiric awakening, they do serious searching and can tell if a vampire site is full of B.S.    Ask yourself, "Do I burn up in sunshine?" and all that other B.S. If the answer is no, then either you're not a vampire or all that stuff is B.S.    Tell your doctor if you're having weird physical symptoms or blood cravings.

KyAjmaOyaa	I'm sorry but you know a lot of people like you have similar things happen to them as well. It's part of life and there is always going to be people that do evil things to each other with bad morals. It's already been a year past and she seems to be of no harm to you now. I suggest you just let it go, it's best that you just forgive her. It'll make you feel like a better person.  You can always just ask for an apology and tell her not to do such things again. Hope all goes well.|`|de947568c9e8173e12d8a9930bab48abaa	You can't resolve it because you have no closure and the only way you can get that is to subpoena her and take her to small claims court and sue her a$$ get your money back and make her pay court costs, THEN you will feel better.|`|1cef0b31719e047b8c16caf5d29cfedbaa	What kept you from taking her to civil court? If you had her on tape then it should have been an open and shut case. You should check in your municipality about statues of limitations. With any luck you still be OK and you can embarrass her on Judge Judy.|`|14pjwQPLaa	Well, if you filed a police report and you had evidence that she had taken it, then she SHOULD have been arrested for theft (possibly grand theft, depending on the money limits in your state), prosecuted, and you should have been able to sue for restitution.      Check with the police and see what happened.  If it's been forgotten, see what needs to happen for it to be reactivated. If the police refuse to handle it, then you might be able to sue her in small claims court.  Hope you still have the tape.|`|xNs7wLaCaa	If it was me I would have my money back some way
QJ8sEwbcaa	@chopzsite3  You're a prick. Stop spreading dirty lies and half-truths. Your sick Japanese side is showing mighty strong as you either have some kind of bias or you're really as ignorant as you write.    I was born and raised in HK. From the way you tell it, it seems the closest you ever got to Hong Kong was across the border from your crap hole of a little village on the Mainland. Or you got your info off a bad book. Really I don't know from where you get off being an expert, but I am sorely offended by your stupidness. FYI it is ILLEGAL to kill and eat Cats and Dogs!! In Hong Kong, a local ordinance dating from British colonial times, which has been retained after the handover to Chinese sovereignty, prohibits the slaughter of any dog or cat for use as food, whether for mankind or otherwise...  I don't know of one person who has ever eaten a cat or dog. And no, there are NO wild animals running around the streets in Hong Kong. It is quite a modern and civilized city, also a very clean city. Much cleaner, litter wise, than NYC. As for chopz saying there are  no western stores nearby, western stores are EVERYWHERE! In fact, it's more like you wish there were less of them. Yes we have 7-11, McDonalds, Starbucks. Ikea. Duh.  And Hong Kong is NOT like some hick city as chopz is making it out to be. Citywise, it has the most Rolls Royce's per capita in the world! And also the most expensive apartments in the world.    As for Mainland China, life varies depending upon where you go. Most people do NOT go to or move to the rural villages, where chopz seems to come from and only knows about.   Mostly life is centered around Beijing and Shanghai where life is on par with most western lifestyles, but a lot cheaper! There are plenty of foreigners in Shanghai. Infact, the largest expatriate population to be found in Shanghai are the Japanese. Food wise, the Japanese restaurants there are very authentic. There is also top-notch french, Italian, etc. And there are plenty of clubs with all types of people from around the world.  And again, no, they do not eat dog/cat in Shanghai. It is not a part of the traditional diet in any way and never has been. For westerners, the easiest city to adapt to is Shanghai. In Shanghai, they speak mandarin as the official language but also have their own, which is Shanghainese. Shanghainese is very different than mandarin. Both in vocab and sometimes grammar. Also, Shanghainese is not tonal but pitch/accent. Ironically Shanghainese language sounds closer to Japanese than to Mandarin. This is due in large part to Japanese deriving many of their vocabulary words in the Go on period from the Wu Shanghai area. Yes that is a fact, chopz. Go look it up.      However, for those who want some history to their itinerary, should go to Beijing. That is where the Forbidden Palace and the Great Wall is located. But then I suspect most know that already. As for language, Beijinger's speak mandarin only, but they speak it differently. They roll their r's strongly and sound like they have a mouthful of marbles, sort of.    As for hygiene, Shanghai/Beijing is clean. However there are a lot of migrant workers from the countryside who do not practice the best hygiene and tend to make the city look bad. Water wise, yes, make sure to drink bottle water. But that usually applies to many foreign places one visits.    Lastly regarding those ethnic minorities chopz was speaking about. Many of those people live on the western side of China and most Han Chinese do not have contact with them nor even ever seen one such as; Turks, Tajik, Tibetians.     As for seeing real cultural, historical China, taking the route of the old Silk Route is a good way to see the different peoples and lifestyles. Although hygiene wise, it'd be more of a challenge as one would probably by entering the inner, rural areas.    For living purposes, definitely Shanghai or Hong Kong.|`|LVe6MJfMaa	Well firstly...I think life in China is a lot different than it is in Japan..so you can't really compare the two, so i'm just going to ignore the fact that you said china/japan when they aren't alike at all really... But with any different cultures they will have different traditions. This includes food, clothing, religion etc. In both, chopsticks are used alot..lol. And China is communist so i'm assuming they'd have more strict laws than Japan. And I would also assume you'd be eating alot of rice XD.|`|i0OVwfcyaa	Just about everything.  Western cultures are very individual-centered whereas Eastern cultures are more concerned with the well-being of the whole than the individual.  There are certain ceremonies and habits which are hard to remember, and while there are some western toilets, many places still just have the old squatting style.    I suggest you wikipedia it to get the details, but I'm not exaggerating when I say that almost everything is different.|`|sLtmg9xzaa	In China, it's dirty... LOL Good luck trying to find a decent toilet that's not a hole in the floor. I missed terribly on the first try.    Most of the places are poor and cramped up. Don't expect to have a lot of living space and think about moving to a larger one? Very expensive...    If you live in Hong Kong, you'll live a much more normal life than other places in China. But the larger cities, it's almost much the same as Western society, except the food... and the people, lol. There'd be more food markets out in the street than anywhere else. There would be old ladies on the street making something whatever they can do or find the time to do to sell for a few pennies in USD for a living. There would be wild animals walking around and no one would care if any of them are missing or not. Sometimes your dinner might be a dog or a cat, or that cute little duck that the children used to play with every day after school just up the street.     You would have to adapt to the WEATHER. One thing is that if you're in Tokyo, Japan, it'll be highly humid and HOT in the summer time, and it doesn't snow either, sometimes it'll snow, but rarely. In Hong Kong, it does not snow, but the lowest temperature I remember was around 10C, I think... And they freaked out when it was 17 C once, everyone went out to buy winter coats just for that weather LOL!!     It's not hard to obtain supplies and provisions from the store as they're quite close and convenient. But you won't find any Western/European products, maybe some... but only in wealthy areas like department stores.     Be careful of the food that you do eat. Don't take any drinks with ice in it, and please make sure the water you drink is from a BOTTLE container. Clean water over there is extremely hard to find, and expensive to purchase, except in Japan, but it is expensive regardless, Japan is always expensive LOL. Some Chinese restaurants are usually in the streets, cheap and convenient, it may be unhygienic though, be careful what and where you eat, but don't go to McDonald to salve yourself from food poisoning, you'll only get more sick and fat.     The people over there think more of a group (collectivism) than as an individual or oneself. They think about their families first than themselves. So their families are highest priorities, and their reputation is highly important to maintain clean and good as it can represent their entire family image (ie. How the family raised them, no divorces, 2-3 children (unless mainland China then it is 1 except rural lands), everyone lives together).    The laws in Japan, China, and HK/Macau are all different from each other. Usually the Japanese government tends to disregard of the foreigners as "residents" or "citizens" as they disapprove of foreigners being citizens and obtaining full rights to what a regular Japanese native there might have. Even if you do marry off to a Japanese woman and have children, she may take your name, but it'll be difficult for her in the social run. Officials or people in general will find her awkward and it would be hard to pronounce the last name as it'll be in Katakana format. Your children will be considered as "bastards" and the wife is not "married" despite of the marriage documents.     In China, you will never be able to be a citizen, regardless of marrying a Chinese woman. From China's laws, it is stated that you are considered to be of Chinese citizen if your mother is full Chinese. Just like in Japan, your future or potential children will obtain citizenship and rights, but not you.     In China, it is illegal to practise publicly of different religion organizations other than Buddhism. Even something similar to of Buddhism, it is ILLEGAL and can be FATAL. As the secret police will beat you and take you away and may even rape you, if you are a woman. If the police finds secret or hidden religious practises, they'll usually raid it and jail them.    It is also known that in mainland China, there are different cultures and a huge diversity. There are the Mongolians, Turks, Indonesians, Tajik, Tibetians, Han (Chinese), Cantonese, Tai, Koreans, Miao Yao, Hui (Chinese-Muslims), Mon-Kuhmer, Tungusic, Burman, Portuguese, Jewish, and a fairly small community of Indians mixed Chinese and Turks. Because of such a large diversity, in each province, there are different rules and regulations. In the outer provinces from the sea provinces, they have allowed different lifestyles and cultures and religious practises. For in the North of China, there are Muslim-Chinese.     Despite the fact that China has Turks residing in the mainland, they have been part with China for over 2000 years. They speak, read, and write the Chinese official language and share similar culture and traditions, but they have their own mother tongue language, like my people of the Cantonese tribe. Cantonese is not the official language, but it is a language that many overtake in the south provinces of China, and dominantly in|`|Csg5qnHhaa	Idk bout china, but japan has (tokyo) Has nightlife, lots of cute things to buy, eat, ITS SUPER SUPER CLEAN.

If that's the case then I don't believe he ever existed.  I'll use an example.  There was a man born in the middle of December to a virgin mother.  When he was born 3 wise men came and gave him gifts.  When he grew up he became a prophet and was baptized in a river by a holy man.  He had disciples that followed him around as he spread the word of god.  He was eventually betrayed by one of his followers and crucified and after he died he arose 3 days later.  His name was Horus and he was an Egyptian deity.  His story predates the story of Jesus by over 1000 years.  Can you see the similarity between the story of Horus and the story of Jesus?  Here's an example from the old testament.  The story of Noah's arc.  Noah built a boat that housed 2 of every animal in the world.  LoL that is a fairy tale.  It is obvious.  There are so many holes in just that one story I'm not even going to go into it.  Use your brain.  I haven't even gotten into the ToE yet.

I was without hope, mentally and depressed until I dumped the oppressing, fearful, death-obsessed Christian religion.

There are still holes in our understanding of this universe, but just because we don't know something 100 % for sure, "goddidit" is NOT a plausible explanation! It's no better than saying "a purple monster created the world by farting". There is NO evidence for either, just wishful thinking and imagination run wild.    Big Bang, on the other hand, has quite a huge amount of evidence supporting it. And even if it was proven to be false, that wouldn't have any bearing on whether or not your god exists!! Just because A isn't true, that doesn't automatically mean B is. It could be C, D, E, F, G, H... Or something we haven't even considered yet.    Also, there is a god because YOU say there is one..?

Here's my personal proof:    I was about 7, 8 yrs old and it was Thanksgiving and there was a little "situation" with a pedophile if you know what I mean, and so we were planning to have a bonfire so we went to a park, and actually started one in a BBQ pit and so we burnt all the picture of us and that man, gifts, everything that reminded us of him. And at the end, we prayed and I prayed (my exact words) "I pray the fire will burn like crazy" and so we went to our friend's house to eat, and hang out, and before we left back home (another city/town), we went and saw the fire. And it had been 8hrs, and the fire was still burning, like crazy.    And then, also, on Christmas day, it had been snowing in Corpus Christi, TX, so we were amazed, but we lived in Seadrift (small town, same as the last story) and so we were driving back to Seadrift and there was a bridge, and a deisel was on the other lane and so we were just driving, and my little brother wasn't in his seatbelt, and he was laying there sleeping, and so then we drove, across a piece of ice, and we started spinning (my mom had been on cruise control, which made it spin) and we were just holding on and screaming while the car spun around like an out of control roller coaster. And then when it stopped spinning, we got out and checked all around the car and there wasn't a dent or a scratch or ANYTHING. We could've easily fell over the bridge. And then the diesel driver just sat there in astonishment, so my mom went and told him all of us were okay, and then when my mom got back my little brother woke up and asked what happened. And we took it off cruise control and drove home w/our Christmas miracle.    There's a ton more and I can e-mail them to you, but that's my personal proof.

They put the idea of Jesus and God on the same level as Santa and the Easter bunny.    Ancient gods that ruled like Horus and many others can be explained in the Bible and the Book of Enoch, these werent Gods, these were Fallen Angels who lay with men and ruled over many ancient civilizations.  These Fallen Angels, Watchers or Annunaki taught men how to mine and work minerals from the Earth and  build great cities.    Evolution cannot explain the massive enlightenment of humans 5000 years ago, humans who they say were once hairy apes or single celled bacteria that took billions of years to manifest, the Bible can.    edit: If anyone has doubt about this, I dare them to look it up for themselves and make a  comparison of the oldest known civilization of Ancient Sumeria and the Book of Enoch- who was the great grandfather of Noah.

John 10  25Jesus answered them, "I told you, and you do not believe; the works that I do in My Father's name, these testify of Me.    26"But you do not believe because )you are not of My sheep.    27"My sheep hear My voice, and I know them, and they follow Me;    28and I give eternal life to them, and they will never perish; and no one will snatch them out of My hand.    29"My Father, who has given them to Me, is greater than all; and no one is able to snatch them out of the Father's hand.    30"I and the Father are one."      1 Corinthians 1  21  For since in the wisdom of God the world through its wisdom did not know him, God was pleased through the foolishness of what was preached to save those who believe. 22Jews demand miraculous signs and Greeks look for wisdom, 23but we preach Christ crucified: a stumbling block to Jews and foolishness to Gentiles,     Matthew 11:25  At that time Jesus said, "I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from the wise and learned, and revealed them to little children.    2 Corinthians 4:4  The god of this age has blinded the minds of unbelievers, so that they cannot see the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God.     Luke 8  9 His disciples asked him what this parable meant. 10 He said, "The knowledge of the secrets of the kingdom of God has been given to you, but to others I speak in parables, so that,     "though seeing, they may not see;  though hearing, they may not understand.'    John 1:5  The light shines in the darkness, but the darkness has not understood it.|`|DR7mTpnXaa	. . . . .. . . . . . . . . . . ,.-. . . . . . . . . .``~.,  . . . . . . . .. . . . . .,.-. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .-.,  . . . . .. . . . . . ..,/. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . :,  . . . . . . . .. .,?. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\,  . . . . . . . . . /. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ,}  . . . . . . . . ./. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ,:`^`.}  . . . . . . . ./. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ,:. . . ./  . . . . . . .?. . . __. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . :`. . . ./  . . . . . . . /__.(. . .~-,_. . . . . . . . . . . . . . ,:`. . . .. ./  . . . . . . /(_. . ~,_. . . ..~,_. . . . . . . . . .,:`. . . . _/  . . . .. .{.._$;_. . .=,_. . . .-,_. . . ,.-~-,}, .~; /. .. .}  . . .. . .((. . .*~_. . . .=-._. . .;,,./`. . / . . . ./. .. ../  . . . .. . .\`~,. . ..~.,. . . . . . . . . ..`. . .}. . . . . . ../  . . . . . .(. ..`=-,,. . . .`. . . . . . . . . . . ..(. . . ;_,,-  . . . . . ../.`~,. . ..`-.. . . . . . . . . . . . . . ..\. . /\  . . . . . . \`~.*-,. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ..|,./.....\,__  ,,_. . . . . }.>-._\. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .|. . . . . . ..`=~-,  . .. `=~-,_\_. . . `\,. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\  . . . . . . . . . .`=~-,,.\,. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . `:,, . . . . . . . . . . . . . `\. . . . . . ..__  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .`=-,. . . . . . . . . .,%`>--==``  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . _\. . . . . ._,-%. . . ..`|`|sz33MLTsaa	they are without hope, mentally ill, depressed and usually unloved.|`|AA11709855	I have yet to be given proof of an invisible God.|`|VQmHIrStaa	Are you a troll or do you want an honest answer?

nwRBiyMFaa	Sounds a little bit like homework...!    Okay, here we go:    1. Yes, I do feel so. Of course, there are many different people in this world, with many different views and opinions, but in the deepest core, we are all the same.  All humans (I mean, except people with disabilities) have two arms, two legs, a heart, a brain...  and even more important: we all aim for the same, simple things. Love. Peace. Happiness.  And if you look at it biologically, it's even more obvious, how similar we are (genetics etc.).    2. Yes, because all these things I mentioned above will still be as important as today. In two years, in twenty years, and in two hundred years. People's views and opinions change, but their hearts stay pretty much the same.    3. Of course do they make us better. I would hate a world in which everybody is the same. Just imagine how boring that'd be. No thanks. And no, of course I wouldn't want to lose my individuality. It's not perfect... not at all. But still, it made me to what I am. It just belongs to me. And it makes different to others.
eb4e977a0cb9ce50b08bf74f0f3a0c61aa	There is absolutely no medical condition that makes you "want to drink blood" - if a person does think they "want to drink blood" that is a psychological issue, and not triggered by any physiological response. There is a unique delusion where the victim wants to drink blood, aptly named Renfield syndrome, after the character in Dracula, but it is not a physiological need.    If you drink blood, it does not transfer into your blood system - it goes to the stomach where it is broken down chemically, and the iron in it is destroyed by the hydrochloric acid in your stomach. Humans cannot ingest iron in an unprotected state - iron pills are coated in order to allow them to enter the small intestine in a ball of chyme (semi-digested food matter), and be digested there away from the stomach acids. Blood would be broken down to water and the molecules that make up the blood cells and platelets. There is thus no way ingested blood can do anything for you except to provide water. There are little inherent nutrients in blood - and most of what is there is from the person eating a good meal, which is digested and the nutrients enter the bloodstream through the walls of the small intestine - proteins, carbohydrates, and fats. Anyone who tells you they need to drink blood to survive or stay healthy is a delusional wannabee at best, or a lying psychotic at worst.    As for "psychic" vampires, there is absolutely no proof whatsoever of any way to "drain" energy from another human being. There is no evidence of chi, prana, blood energy, or any of that twiddle-twaddle. The body does generate a low-level electrical and electromagnetic field, but has no way to physically drain those fields from someone else. A person might claim they can do such , "feeding" off your emotions and so on and so forth, but it is a delusion.     Lastly, every single one of the self-professed "vampires" out there are 100% human, with average human physiology, no different than you, me, or Captain Kangaroo. If they go to the hospital for any reason needing bloodwork or DNA testing, they will be proven to be human, no anomalies, no glitches, no organs they don't need, etc. etc. etc. This need to be a "vampire" is a psychological delusion, and for anyone throwing a temper tantrum and screaming, "They do exist! They do exist!" - fine. Let's see some real proof, and not from these stupid vampire websites spewing their fictional trash. No, go to your doctor, have the aforementioned labwork done, and if he says, "Look, you're a vampire!" then scan those lab results along with his affadavit on stationery with his letterhead on it, and post them as a downloadable file so we can all see your proof. Will you do that for me?    I am a Nurse, with real medical education, training and knowledge.     I've had hate mail from these so-called "vampires", public attacks in the Y/A! forums, death threats, told to "shut up", told I don't know what I'm talking about, told I'll wake up "covered in blood", etc. etc. etc. ad nauseum. Every single one I've invited to come find me, and told them where and when. Guess they couldn't get out of remedial math class that morning. ROFLOL.    Here we go again - kil roy, if, as you postulate, vampires are demons possessing dead bodies, then they, like anything else, must then obey the laws of physics while in a material shell. A dead body necroses, or decays, and can only ever be as strong or fast as it was in life - it cannot be stronger. Also, if you admit to the existence of demons, then you also admit to the existence of God. As we see in the Bible, there were demons inhabiting the living bodies of men during Jesus' day, and they begged him not to destroy them but to let them leave in peace, and when he did so they fled into the bodies of swine, or pigs. Those pigs, maddened by the demonic entities, plunged over a cliff and died, releasing the demons. The host of fallen angels that rebelled in Heaven was a "third" of their number, don't you think that we'd be inundated with "vampires" if they could do as they pleased? They can't. They are not allowed to physically manifest in such ways - even Lucifer had to ask permission to torture Job. A demon would find it much easier to wreak havoc just by influencing our minds so we commit atrocities while we are drunk, doped up, in rages, etc. And no demon would risk giving us incontrovertible proof of Heaven this close to endgame.    Jiminy Christmas - does no one read? Anemia cannot be controlled by drinking blood - blood is broken down by the digestive system. Iron in it is destroyed. Jeez - READ!|`|0s190C7Zaa	sure why not the world is big enough for them to hide and thrive in.|`|agh18eT2aa	The Lord has spoken and it is good.........|`|jard50Yiaa	Vampyres are out there...    http://www.christiananswersforthenewage....|`|ff545BLyaa	Not real...|`|AA12384132	Well here we go again if we were talking about humans bear claw would be correct but alas we are talking about paranormal creature the are as real as a sunset or a sunrise....................|`|Xm4NvBPLaa	There is no medical condition that forces you to drink blood !?!?!  how about Blood amnemia !?! never heard about this one  in my opinion this is how Vampires originated becuse in the past this sickness was unknown there are people out there who's blood simply does not produce red cells and they need to get them from other source (Vampires blood also does not produce red cells as its the only condition that would explain this) If vampires do exist they're propably  Demons that have blood Amnemia and thats why they drink blood however since the myth originated from eastern Europe (Dracula was Transylvianian which now makes him Hungarian)  I should explain that Eastern Europeans have a habbit of eating blood in their meals for example a blood sausage known as 'Kaszanka' which is similiar to black pudding you propably don't know but you yourself eated a blood sausage as well many times salami that is ussually sometimes added to pizza is a blood sausage ...ad revelations about the Transylvanian count known as Vlad the Impaler  and you know how the original Dracula came to live besides theres this biblical fragment about Kain   Which was used to prove that he is the first vampire to be born !

Basically, homemade items = +! It doesn't tell him that you're in love with him, just that you took enough time to make that present just for him.

pjGhLLEdaa	Rats:  To see rats in your dream, signifies feelings of doubts, guilt and envy. You are feeling unworthy Something that you are keeping to yourself is eating you up inside. Alternatively, it denotes repulsion, decay, dirtiness, and even death. The dream may also be a pun on someone who is a rat. Are you feeling betrayed?  To see a black rat, represents deceit and covert activities.   To see a white rat in your dream, denotes that in your time of distress, you will receive assistance from an unexpected source.  To dream that a rat is biting your feet, symbolizes the rat race that you are experiencing in your waking life.      Snakes:  To see a snake or be bitten by one in your dream, signifies hidden fears and worries that are threatening you.  Your dream may be alerting you to something in your waking life that you are not aware of or that has not yet surfaced. Alternatively, the snake may be seen as phallic and thus symbolize temptation, dangerous and forbidden sexuality. If you are afraid of the snake, then it signifies your fears of sex, intimacy or commitment. The snake may also refer to a person around you who is callous, ruthless, and can't be trusted. As a positive symbol, snakes represent healing, transformation, knowledge and wisdom. It is indicative of self-renewal and positive changes.      .|`|3159ba3bf7bf777ace6d092394020e75aa	You fell asleep at the Republican national convention?

All creatures that are powerful in nature can be called gods.  Satan is called the god of this system of things.  The angels are powerful and are called gods. Jesus is also calles a god and people like to confuse him with his father JEHOVAH but they are not the same.    Gods can also apply to inanimate objects that you attribute worship to..for instance back in Moses time, they made a golden calf that they worshipped like a god.  Buddists worship Budda as a god.

baksmHQRaa	15 is a horrific age for falling in love. Not because the love isn't real,but because it doesn't always last.  Firstly, true and keep in mind that there is nothing wrong with feeling these things. Nothing good will come from being hard on yourself. You need to love yourself first.  Now, as far as your problem, I'd suggest that you keep in contact with this guy. Keep writing and be open and honest with him. At 15 it is difficult to know what will happen there, so don't get to upset about it (and be careful, you know what the internet is like =P)  And with this girl, is the problem that you feel like your cheating? If so, talk to the guy, because he may be fine with it. If that's not the problem then just see where things go. You may end up really liking her. Be honest that you are unsure of things and that you want to take things slow.  Just remember that things will work themselves out and you should focus on being good to yourself and those around you, and not focus on possible bad things that could happen.  I hope that helped in some way =P and Good Luck!|`|Q5cEmhDEaa	When your that age, there's so many emotions and hormones running wild. Even though you really like this guy, at the end of the day will anything ever happen between you 2? Long distance relationships rarely ever work. And have u ever actually met this guy in person? Don't let yourself fall in too deep, you will only end up getting hurt. As for the whole crushes on girls thing. Its only normal. Your still young and discovering who you are. Doesn't mean your bi or anything. You have plenty of time to figure out what you want. Probably seems harsh cuz im not telling you what u want to hear, but in the long run, its not worth tying yourself up with a guy online. Just stay friends.|`|4pZxnpVkaa	Bisexuality isn't a phase, its the way some people are for their entire lives.

Sweetie you're boyfriend is Bisexual|`|nQW1MSMpaa	This is not necessarily true. In a survey done by jackinworld.com it was found to be common that men are often aroused by the sight of male genitals.      --------------------------------------...    17. Imagine that you're masturbating in front of two TV screens. One TV can show images of naked women. The other TV can show images of naked men. You can watch only one TV while you masturbate, but you must watch one of them. Which would you more likely choose?  ? The one showing women: 52.5%  ? The one showing men: 47.5%    18. Imagine that you're masturbating with two books. One book is devoted to pictures of female genitals; the other is devoted to pictures of male genitals. You can look at only one of the books while you masturbate, but you must look at one of them. Which would you more likely choose?  ? The one showing female genitals: 44.8%  ? The one showing male genitals: 55.1%    Of those who answered "women" in question 17, those who would choose the book of male genitals: 24.4%    Even among readers who are more aroused by the female body than the male body, male genitals are frequently a source of arousal; about one-quarter of these readers find male genitals more arousing than female genitals.    --------------------------------------...      It therefore shows that your boyfriend is just part of the norm in society. He may want to try to get help with his view about sex being something dirty though, that is not particularly healthy. Sex is a normal, natural part of life, regardless of your sexuality.|`|WlSelrj5aa	Just watching Dennis Lecorriere,he turns me on,at my age even!!

TLOgBy3caa	::ahem::  "I don't have any interests in having sex with a guy."  "I like girls."  "He looks good and I wish I looked like that, but I don't want to have sex with him."  Does that answer your question? Think about what you say before you say them.  It's not even a phase, you're just over thinking it. Being homosexual is not a virus. It is not contagious. You are being a guy.|`|FtoSIA0aaa	You worry too much.|`|RhX0TxOBaa	You're an idiot and straight.|`|AA10723657	why are you worrying you are straight. you can,t catch it you just are gay or not .|`|ZSlXrXsCaa	Your feeling towards other guys is what we call envy, we all are envious of others at times its perfectly normal, your straight there's nothing to worry about.|`|01NUrwfYaa	well from your commentary I'd say you might be attracted to guys. just worrying about it gives it away. I'm pretty gay and can tell you that I've had crushes on girls, although never tried anything because they wouldn't excite me as far as sex goes. It's not an easy thing to talk about, but perhaps you should see your therapist (if you have one). Yeah the faith stuff gets extremely iffy when you add a little bit of homosexuality. One thing though, don't lie to yourself and honestly reflect your true feelings that way you can live knowing your life won't be a lie. being gay is not something we can control (as most people believe )... it just happens... its innate, in my personal opinion. You haven't stated your age, which could help a bit to determine a much better answer. If your lets say 13 or 15 then you may just be "excitable"     take care and best of luck.|`|xJdAxPtWaa	Then you are not gay, nor will you be. (Unless you realize it at a later time in your life.

Being gay isnt something you can psych urself into. Noticing and envying another guy for his attractiveness does not mean ur gay. Stop worrying! It wont help at all!|`|Qswzc6w7aa	If you are worried about it then you must be curious as to what it would be like. There is nothing wrong with that. I'm a female and I wonder what it would be like to be with another girl.

Dont worry about it. guys look at other guys and some may acknowledge the other's attractiveness. girls do it all the time... are they all lesbians? i think not. just because you find people attractive doesnt mean anything. gay guys find some girls to be hot... lesbians can find a guy attractive... and same goes for straight individuals towards the same sex. youre cool. and one more other thing... being gay isnt wrong, or a choice... its how people deal with it that makes it wrong at times.|`|3dAhyHMaaa	LMFAO|`|nsZuZ1O9aa	I don't see why your worried.

65QqZBnjaa	Let me get this straight:    You were watch a video of a transsexual MAN.    I'm assuming you're a woman from your avatar so    MAN + WOMAN well that usually = straight|`|xuuaMTmtaa	You just said you are straight, and then you question your own sexual identity by asking if it makes you bi or what?    Sexual orientation is defined by the self, not necessarily through practice.  Even a virgin can know who and what they are attracted to.        I personally don't think it means anything significant, unless YOU feel it does.  I remember watching a comic one time who said everyone must be a little bisexual.  He asked his friend if he liked watching porn. The guy said "Yeah, like who doesn't?" and then the other guy was like "Well..when you watch it, do you want the guy to be limp, or do you like watching a guy hard?" and the other guy was like "Wow..I never realized that about myself!" And the guy was totally straight.     So see, I don't think it necessarily "means" anything.     However, if it did and you DO find yourself not only sexually attracted, but could see yourself in a relationship with an FTM as well, then I would classify you as more heteroflexible, or possibly pansexual, IF I had to give it a label.    I get this question ALL THE TIME from girls I potentially want to date.  I'm FTM as well.  They ask "Ok, so what does this make ME?" To which I reply, "How does what I choose to do with my life affect YOU? You're still who you are, you still like what you like.  Just because I've come into your life, doesn't change your own personal self identity." You don't become gay or bi by association.|`|BHb5LPb1aa	Yeah dont worry i feel the same when i watch that same stuff as well even though i consider myself str8 guy as women turn me on and guys dont  You are str8|`|TLOgBy3caa	Unless you actually have feelings for them. No. Honestly, being gay is not a light switch. You are not straight then all of a sudden not.|`|Iy36xZMOaa	what's the url???|`|MCW5tHv3aa	no, if you attracted to the opposite sex then your heterosexual.    a trans-man is a guy, he's male  a trans -woman is a woman, she's female.     additionally most trans-guys are hot!|`|4pZxnpVkaa	Nah it makes you curious, and maybe you have a dirtier side than you imagined ;)
HH90Eghaaa	Yes that works!

Its really the parents preference and what they call themselves as the child is learning to talk that will influence the name, so really its up to the parents.|`|Qswzc6w7aa	Mommy and Mommy    Mom one mom two  Not really sure, that is very interesting question though.

Wo5Ezmwiaa	I know, sexuality is so complicated and confusing, especially if you are a teenager. The important thing to know is that figuring out your sexuality can take time, even years, and that you should not feel rushed to label yourself. I wasn't sure about my sexuality till I was 17.  Being bi means that you are interested in being with both sexes physically and that you could fall in love with either a man or a woman, and are interested in dating both men and women. Being bisexual also does not mean that you have to like both sexes equally, you can be more interested in men, or you can be more interested in women. So, only with time can you figure out what you want in life and what you want in a partner and in a relationship. So you may experiment and find that you really just want a man, or you may find that you could go for either sexes. But either way, don't rush yourself into labeling yourself, and just see where life takes you.|`|4pZxnpVkaa	You are bi if you are attracted sexually to members of both sexes.|`|LJxKNAdVaa	well if you think girls and guys are hot   i guess   just kiss a girl and if you like it your bi|`|Nsgh1XzLaa	only if you want to have a relation with the same sex.  if you fantasize with girls then you are most likely bi.  you also have to kinda like guys to be confirmed (as a bi).    ur friend   roger|`|HH90Eghaaa	Time is a good indicator!  Eventually you just know your sexuality and sexual orientation!  For now you might not want to limit yourself to labels!|`|BHb5LPb1aa	if the thought of sleeping with or having a relationship with either a guy or girl turns you on or makes you happy then you are bi and theres nothing wrong with feeling like that|`|Iy36xZMOaa	you are romantically attracted to both or either sex.     this doesn't mean you are curious about messing about with a girl or kissing a girl for a laugh or joke.  it is about having romantic feelings and deep emotional crushes for women and men.|`|qB3hMFPVaa	time will tell    ;D    peace|`|igkbUflbaa	If you are both physically and romantically attracted to members of both sexes.

Because, it sounds like you're older than me, and I came out at a really young age (11). I just told people, I didn't care if other people knew, I didn't care who they reacted.

It really doesn't matter what everyone else thinks.|`|4pZxnpVkaa	Especially if you are going to be living with someone, its time to be honest.  You aren't going to want to stay single forever and when you start bringing girls home for "sleepovers" he might start to get suspicious.  Just be honest, and don't let him tell anyone else.  That's your job, they will want to hear it right from you, instead of whispered down the lane.|`|zXNfrimRaa	This is quite a situation you have found yourself in.  I come from the red spot of California--a little piece of conservative, cowboy Texas rolled into the golden empire-- so I understand your frustration.  But I can assure you, the only way you can be happy is to come out.  If you are certain (because this WILL cause a lot of unnecessary headaches if you decide later that you are not a lesbian), then come out.  Be proud of who you are.  If you and your cousin are as close as you insinuate, I would first talk to your cousin.  Maybe just ask him a hypothetical question about his feelings on you being a lesbian.  If you move in with your cousin and choose NOT to tell him, the pressure for you to date one of his friends will ultimately be overbearing and you will have to tell him eventually.  Telling him before living arrangement are finalized, you can decide if his reaction to the news will not change his opinion on you enough to make living together a living hell.      good luck.|`|Y4ygzFC5aa	Just go to the sun.

dbbc96707652448861857d7e1a147af3aa	In ancient art, Demeter was often portrayed (sitting) as a solemn woman, often wearing a wreath of braided ears of corn. Well-known is the statue made by Knidos (mid forth century BCE). Her usual symbolic attributes are the fruits of the earth and the torch, the latter presumably referring to her search for Persephone. Her sacred animals were the snake (an earth-creature) and the pig (another symbol of fertility). Some of her epithets include Auxesia, Deo, Chloe, and Sito.

By 20 weeks, the spino- thalamic system is fully established and connected.    There are three different indicators providing evidence that the fetus feels pain.       1. Anatomical          - pain receptors spread over the body in stages: 8-16 weeks          - pain impulse connections in the spinal cord link up and reach the thalamus (the brain's reception center): 7-20 weeks (summarized by Anand, K.J.S., Atlanta)       2. Physiological/Hormonal          - fetuses withdraw from painful stimulation          - two types of stress hormones, normally released by adults subjected to pain, are released by adults subjected to pain, are releases in massive amounts by the fetus subjected to a needle puncture to draw a blood sample:           (a) from 19 weeks onward (N. Fisk; London, England)           (b) from 16 weeks onward (J. Partch; Kiel, Germany)       3. Behavioral          - withdraw from pain          - change in vital signs          A 20-30 week old fetus actually will feel more pain than an adult. The period between 20-30 weeks is a uniquely vulnerable time, since the pain system is fully established, yet the higher level pain-modifying system has barely begun to develop.     They feel pain|`|rU6nh42Eaa	It's a very, very misunderstood concept.  No one is aborting babies to provided stem cells.  You don't need embryos to get stem cells.    I am not sure why there is such a hubbub about the issue.  I am against abortion, because I think the unborn child is as human as I am, only in a much more vulnerable phase of life.  Possibly some people are against the use of embryonic tissue, in case it moves us one step closer to "harvesting" tissue for medical research and procedures. We need to be sensitive to the  humanity of all people.  It's terrible that there are many people who are praying daily for some medical breakthrough that can save their lives or make live better, but don't look to stem-cells as the answer for everything.  This research can save lives, and what's being done with it is promising.  However, it won't help everyone's problem.    I hope you get a great home soon, honey.  Always stay close to your brother.|`|nGyOmjPsaa	It can and does kill lives.  Stem cell research includes the destruction of human embryos...the destruction of human persons (aka murder).  But if stem cell research is done using adult tissue without causing harm to the adult then that is accepted.  But using God's creation of a human being by extracting certain goods and discarding the others is not humane!  With all due respect, your eyesight is nothing compared to another person's chance to live!  It does not give a person the right to tare apart another human being just so the one can have better eyesight or a better life in general; because you have a life!  If you use stem cells from an embryo (which includes discarding the rest of the person) then he or she (the embryo) does not have a life because of you.

That's when I went back to read everything.    (((((((Josh)))))))    Josh, I've had Type 1 Diabetes for nearly 45 years.  One of my brothers has had it more than 50 years.  It is a terrible disease and I sure would like to be cured but not if it comes to embryonic stem cells.  From everything I've read and heard, it simply replaces one bad with several others.      I've had Diabetic Retinopathy for the past few years after having had excellent eyesight all the previous years of my life.  I've had several rounds of Laser surgery, Cataract surgery, Victrectomy and shots of Avastin and Kenalog in one eye,  I have no medical insurance and in 2008 I spent all of my income and some of my savings on medical expenses even though my wonderful doctors gave me huge breaks.    I have some wonderful doctors and am very grateful but my hope is not in them.  My hope comes from the LORD.  I have offered Him my Diabetes for His glory.  I know that He is able to cure my body just as He has already cured my spirit.  There was so many people that Jesus cured just by His Word - lepers, the blind, and the lame.  I look to Him, not to man    Josh, I've actually been blessed in many wonderful ways by having Diabetes.  I was days, maybe only hours away from death before I was finally diagnosed.  I was being treated for a virus even though I had ALL of the classic symptoms, including unquenchable thirst, rapid weight loss, blurred vision, constant urination.    I still remember what it felt like to have that first shot of insulin running through my body bringing me back to life.  These vivid memories are what came to mind years later when it dawned on me that I was dying from Spiritual Diabetes.  When I started reading the Bible and looking to my Heavenly Father, life started flowing back into my very being.    If I hadn't experienced the near death symptoms of physical diabetes I would have never recognized the symptoms of spiritual diabetes.  The former only lasts for this life but the latter is eternal.    Yes, I want to be cured of diabetes but I want it God's way, not mankind's way.    I'm praying for you and for your brother.    For His glory,  JOYfilled - but missing Schneb|`|27d6fd19ae9c4fc896c24ed094c8929faa	Could I possibly add some reason w/o the emotion here? Those against it see it as the destruction of POTENTIAL life. Plus anytime you begin seeing something as having no value beyond your use for or lack of need for it you start on the slippery slope of debasing all life. Roe vs. Wade came in the 70s for the first trimester. Now it's legal anytime up to birth including partial birth which is so gruesome it's illegal to do on animals.    I do understand your desperation and pain but there are no guarantees. In fact they are finding that there is the same potential with adult stem cells w/o harm. But the other are simply easier to manipulate.    But here's something to consider. If stem cell research is so wonderful & can do so much why aren't the wealthy donating millions for it's research? Why aren't insurance companies donating millions. Think of the money they'd save on those with diabetes, blindness, etc. One quick fix instead of 40 or 50 yrs. of meds, dr. visits, syringes, etc.    When you're sick and/or in pain it's human nature to grab on to promises of ways to end it. It's doesn't make you foolish, just a hurting human being. In my opinion your life does matter more. But the reality is nothing has been proven for a fact. If it had been millions the world over would be clamering/demanding public access & money for it.    Please give the link to the blind child who can suppossedly see. There can be all kinds of other factors you're not considering. So I'd have to read it to know for sure.    It's not illegal to research it. It's only illegal to use government money.|`|l1ctIW7eaa	because stem cell research makes me want to get an abortion!|`|3qqvFEsHaa	According the the Vatican the potential life of one person is more valuable than cures for cancer, scoliosis, alzheimers, etc...|`|GQk0UNjfaa	the people who are against stem cell research claim 'pro life'. the fact that they oppose stem cell research shows just how 'pro life' they really are.|`|wtg8vtzBaa	They oppose embryonic stem cell research because apparently it encourages women to have abortions.

It happens spontaneously too.|`|bsHkZH1kaa	Because the stem cells from a baby don't heal people.  full grown human stem cells that can be taken from the fat on people or brain tissue that won't hurt or kill anyone; that saves peoples lives.  To get the stem cells from a baby; that won't work anyway; you have to either kill it or have a child.  The cord that is on the baby has great stem cells; but to have that cord; the child must live.  The cord, adult fat, and just very small amounts of brain tissue heals people; because it's the riches of the stem cells that are working and alive.|`|iHDYncuXaa	Why take one life to save another? Isn't that an oxymoron? I'm not against adult stem cell usage. That doesn't take a life and has had positive results.|`|VRl1jENHaa	So far, at least 75 ailments and diseases have been treated using adult stem cells.  Despite research on a limited line of fetal stem cells, NOT ONE ailment or disease has been treated using this method.    And there's a factor that many who champion fetal stem cell research "forget" to mention:  that the research so far shows that fetal stem cells often cause uncontrollable tumors in the recipients.  There is no way to alleviate this (if there was, we would have a cure for cancer!).    So far, there have been no adverse effects following the use of adult stem cells in a patient.  Plus, when the patient's own stem cells are used, she or he doesn't have to take anti-rejection drugs for the rest of his or her life -- which is not the case when one considers fetal stem cell therapy; those patients are facing a lifetime of taking expensive, toxic drugs that prevent them from rejecting the transplanted fetal cells.    The bottom line seems to be that adult stem cells truly hold more promise than fetal stem cells ever will.  This doesn't have to be a moral issue -- the facts speak for themselves that adult stem cells are better and more promising.|`|IbtQ5IKNaa	So this is a generation of reincarnation of yourself.

Just recently, a lady in South America (forget where exactly) whose spinal cord was severed regained use of her legs because of adult stem cells.    Embryonic stem cells, however, have, as of yet, done nothing but cost a lot of money and end lives.

At 6 weeks has a fully functioning brain and nervous system and can feel pain, can suck it's thumb can do numerous things in the womb. It is alot more then a clump of cells. It is a baby from the time of conception|`|fER8XF68aa	Part of the problem is misinformation.  Some people hear "fetal" or "embryonic" stem cells and picture little "babies" being cut up for parts.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  Stem cells are obtained from fertilized eggs in which the cells have not yet differentiated, meaning they're simply clusters of cells that have not yet become anything.  They are *not* obtained from aborted fetuses.  - - -    Frequently Asked Questions  http://stemcell.uconn.edu/content/faq.ph...  [Excerpts]    "What are stem cells?    "Stem cells are unspecialized cells that are distinguished by two very important characteristics. They can live indefinitely and through the process of cell division can replicate themselves endlessly. More important, they can differentiate. They have the remarkable capacity to mature into any of the 220 tissues and cell types in the human body. From brain cells to liver cells to bones, stem cells are capable of transforming into the myriad specialized cells the body requires for specific functions."  ...    "Where do stem cells come from?    "The most useful stem cells, those most capable of developing into multiple cell types, are embryonic stem cells, which come from four to five-day-old embryos. Dividing and replicating rapidly, a few of these cells can produce millions of duplicates in a short period of time. These cells, used for research in laboratories, are referred to as embryonic stem cell lines. They are derived from human eggs that were fertilized in vitro in fertilization clinics, but were never implanted - and never will be implanted - in a womans uterus. They are donated to laboratories with the consent of the donors. It is estimated that there are upwards of half a million unused embryos, frozen in U. S. fertility clinics."  .|`|gdYN39gtaa	Why stem cell research?  There is not one proof that stem    cells can save lives. It sorta makes my stomach turn to     know that these cells came from real baby cells that are    destroyed on purpose if not used. We don't have to use    live cells from real humans to find ways to save lives.    Let's go with "adult stem cells". We already know it works.
AA11100707	No, will not need it as I am connected to cable. However, I did order two boxes which I have donated.    Re: the seeming confusion on extension dates...there are TWO dates to have been reckoned with.    1. the last date for provision of the box coupons [which has been extended]    2. the date for switchover from analog to digital...that has NOT been extended. 2/17/09 is the date    Further: regardless of age of the TV, if you do not have cable or satellite service, OR you do not have a totally digital TV you WILL need a converter box...|`|uoDhDLUvaa	we have direct tv so dont need one ha,ha|`|uVQ6OSu3aa	Yes I hope the date is pushed back even further. Im not a radical but I do feel this is a prime example of Gov. control over the American people. It has been slowly coming and eased into our lives and with the hustle and bustle of our lives we have not even noticed how we have been pushed into two groups, the haves and the haves not. If you think back ten years, there was a influx of high interest credit cards made available to anyone that wanted them. It was not one year later there was an influx of defaults on these cards. This marred millions of peoples credit reports and they became the have not because they have not a good credit report. ( Opinion )|`|Ks6Ac9SSaa	Yep I have them and they are already hooked onto the tv. Got them with the coupons last summer.  They only cost $10 with the coupon and that's a lot cheaper than cable or satellite every month.|`|UspK4SQBaa	It is very sad.  The change will actually be pushed back to the summer if the House approves Obama's legislation, so that gives you a bit more time.  Perhaps they will come up with a better solution other than the coupons, like free boxes, by then.|`|Dm9L3EdAaa	I started seeing information about the switch to digital in April of 08, but I didn't think much about it until my son brought it up.  Anyway, I just did a little googling and got everything together by the end of July..     I applied for the coupons on-line.  Then, I ordered two converter boxes for  our two televisions.   With those coupons they cost me around 25.00 with the shipping.     My son put us up a decent antenna and trashed our old rabbit ears.  Then he put one converter box on our older television.  Apparently I didn't need two of them.  Out newer TV was already digital.  So I gave  him the extra one.      We are already watching digital channels.  And I'm so glad now that I didn't procrastinate.    I think I heard on the news that the digital deadline will not be extended. Hopefully I'm wrong about that.  I don't know personally anyone who will be left out.  One of my co-workers gave each set of parents (his and hers) a digital television for Christmas.     You don't need a coupon to buy a converter box.|`|AA10462593	I have the converter box and can pick up extra channels and get a much better picture.

As for your question Gladys I don't know the answer to that one. Could we try and organize a fund raiser at a church or maybe boy or girl scouts could do a project to help raise money and buy converters for seniors.    EDIT: I am in a area that to watch TV you need either satelite or cable so that takes care of it for me.  I have notice some saying there is a $10.00 difference between the coupon and price of the box. Here or in the neighboring town where they would work I heard there was a $30.00 difference.|`|m1V5ws73aa	How could it be a matter of using the coupon or buying prescriptions?

There is published phone numbers for people to ask to have them hooked up that haven't yet, that can't figure it out. It's a free service.

As they slowly trickled in , in small shipments, the boxes were gone as soon as they hit the shelves. .

It is real unfortunate some people will go without tv this is when the rich should donate and help others who aren't as fortunate.

Everyone has known this has been coming for well over a year now. It has been advertised over every T.V. station including cable everyday for a long time. If they don't have one by now, they won't have one in June. I feel sorry for the people who really can't afford it but It really isn't that much. They could let their hair salon appointment go for a week. I am willing to bet the rest of the people who say they can't afford it have Wii and x-boxes, play stations, dvd player and lord knows what all. I bet the people who say they can't afford a box are the same ones we stand behind in the checkout line while they pay for groceries with food stamps and then walk out and load them in the trunk of a brand new cadillac. They can afford one but they just want one given to them like everything else.|`|8yE2sYGeaa	It is NOT coming next month    Congress postponed it until June 12, so now you have time|`|h5p9exIDaa	Hi Gladys,   I understand what you mean by prescription medicine or using the coupons for a converter box.

I know so many wont have the coupons and wish for the elderly it would be waived and just done for them......because your right, they have to have their meds and its not a choice for most, the meds come first.|`|d4bd8b0d4b217939ff505d70042c7c38aa	They have extended the time because of the problem with the coupons.  They've been sending out all these coupons, but there aren't enough boxes to redeem the coupons for... or some such problem.    I do not need a box... I have satellite.    There are actually relatively few people who will be need the boxes.  Then, out of those, only a small number cannot afford the boxes.  So the problem isn't as big as you may think it is.  Then, there are also parts of the country which are actually NOT converting in Feb 2009.  These stations have 2 years to change out their old ANALOG sending towers for DIGITAL sending towers... and these towers are VERY expensive, not to mention in REMOTE places (Wyoming isn't exactly metropolitan!).  Therefore, the FCC is giving these areas an exended time to make the change-over. (read this in a local newspaper)      Have a Senior day.|`|ozwLZwXeaa	That is exactly right.

They were $45.00 but with my coupons, I only paid $5.00 each. But I also had to buy a antenna splitter at Radio Shack, That cost $11.00.  That's so that I can still Dvr a program, on one channel,  while watching another program on another channel. Now I just have to hook it up, now if I could just get one of my sons to get over here to do it for me. If not I will just have to figure it out my self I guess, that or do without TV for a while. Heaven forbid.   Why don't you go to Wal Mart where you can get your generic drugs, a 30 day supply only cost $4.00 or a 90 day supply is only $10.00. I would never be able to afford prescriptions drugs if it wasn't for that, as I have no insurance, or medical coverage and I have to pay cash for   prescriptions and doctors visits, and tests.|`|66ATKuknaa	No, but I have a coupon for one.|`|NFY4A1csaa	Comcast installed the boxes in June of 2007 in my senior complex.  This was because it is the only cable available to all of us who paid the $20 per month extra for basic cable.  Since then, they have increased it by $10 per month.  At $30 it seems to be a fair price for all the channels we receive.  Comcast in my area claims that if you are already a subscriber to their service in this state, it will be an automatic change to digital without the addition of the converters.  We shall see.|`|AA11570788	This conversion has caused a lot of trouble and inconvenience for many people what with coupons and converter boxes. Many seniors depend on their TV's for news and entertainment.  I hope they will be able to make the conversion easily.  Fortunately, we have a digital TV and get Comcast, so we are all right.  But many people are not.  Hope it works out for them.|`|2050b6d291fcdfd5a7d8aa27df83196aaa	I am confused by the answers I see here.  I just read on yahoo news that the House voted down the extension of the date to switch to digital.  Also, the coupons are for $40.00, not $50.00.  I do think it is correct that you would need to add about $10.00 to purchase the converter.  The stupid mistake I made was to order the coupon, then put it aside when it came.  That was a few months ago.  I got it out a couple of weeks ago and planned to check prices for the boxes but discovered that the coupon had expired.  I had no idea they would not be good until the time for changing over.    As for the answer to the problem for people who can't afford even the $10.00, maybe churches could help out or senior centers.  I think the coupons should have covered the whole cost.  I am not much of a tv watcher but I know plenty of people for whom it is their only source of entertainment.|`|lebSL2yaaa	I have cable, which is digital, so no problem with the changeover.  I feel for those who won't be ready, but really, they have had close to two years to prepare for this, and could have put away a couple bucks a month toward it.  It was not unexpected.  Even without the coupon it would only cost about $75 bucks.  Most old TV's should probably be replace soon anyway, and all the newer sets have digital tuners so there is not a problem with any of them.  Time marches on, and progress will always leave some behind.  That's life, and not always fair.|`|VWAl3tcnaa	What has the coupons have to do with prescription medicine, I sent for the coupons of $40 each, went to Walmart and bought 2 converter boxes priced at $49.99 each.  After applying the 2 $40 coupons I paid the $20 difference.  Basically $10 for the box and get exceptional picture, no ghost lines, no snows, and get more channels.  I am sorry if any senior cannot afford $10 but it sure beats cable or dish satellite subscription of over $40 a month.|`|AA11722373	Here is another side to this story: There are 3 families (my parents, my daughter and myself) that are living at this same address, 2 of which would need the coupons to be able to watch their TV. Well a friend of the family sent off for a set of the coupons, we got those. Tried several times to get them at Wal-Mart where they would be able to purchase them cheaper, but Wal-Mart was always out of them and the coupons would be expiring soon. So we had to end up going to CircuitCity to get them. They are not cheap there even with the coupon. Then another member of the family tried to get theirs, but that address had already been used, so it was denied. Wrote a letter to the company letting them know that more than one family gets their mail from the same address, it was over turned and said that the coupons would be sent to that address, the coupons were never sent but their records shows that the second set of coupons were sent to this address just under a different name. There will not be a recovery for those 2. The other member of the family had to use yet a different address to get theirs. Then a big mistake was made and the coupons ended up expiring before they could be used.      My parents have theirs, we just can't get it hooked up for them. Several of us have tried to get it hooked up with no luck. If it is a fact that it will be this summer before it switches over, at least my parents will get to watch TV for awhile longer.    Now as fas as the coupons or precripitions, I know what you mean there. Like I said, even with the coupon, I paid $50.00 for the 2 for my parents at CircuitCity just because Wal-Mart was always out of them and their coupon was really close to expiring. My daughter never did get hers because she couldn't afford the ones at CircuitCity and was waiting on Wal-Mart but her coupon expired before she could get hers. Mine just flat never came in. So we are all SOL. As they say on the ad when getting the coupons, they will not replace even if they are lost, stollen, or expired.    My personal feeling about the whole converter box business, I think it all stinks that they make you pay for their update. They should be a lot more flexible than they are. I am not just talking about extending out the time as to when they are going to do the switch over. I talking about the converter box coupons their self, on how, when and where to get them.|`|SfGyzMSFaa	No one in my family needs the converter boxes; because we all have cable tv.     There isn't one single answer that would work for everyone who uses antennas with older tvs that are not digital ready; and who are unable to obtain and install a converter box. This is because people and their communities differ. For older people, a good place to start might be through Local Area Agencies on Aging; because this group coordinates with several other agencies. I think it is possible to identify people who need help; and then find groups/clubs/charities that can donate the time and money to provide the converter boxes.     I think the switch to digital tv signals is very necessary. Analog tv signals use large chunks of the "airwaves" that are shared by many other devices-including devices used by our public safety agencies (law enforcement, fire, emergency medical services) along with all of the less necessary wireless devices people use (wireless internet, etc.).|`|FG0HcKbPaa	I don't need one, however I heard on NPR that although the date for the switch has been pushed back til June, many television networks were already in place to switch to digital and CAN STILL DO SO BEFORE JUNE if they choose...they do not have to wait til june so some stations may switch in FEBRUARY anyway...    I sent for the coupon early in 2008 and it never even arrived! I sent for the coupon because I know a few people that would need it and I figured having one would be convienient to give away...    I think the converters should be free.|`|hallarIxaa	I bought two with  the coupons at Wal-marts it was only $7 It is sad to think there are people that can'afford $7.|`|1b611f18c550f86e4004e2a498a5d55aaa	No, sister, I don't have a darn coupon so I guess I'll be left in the lurch.

wfWAlztVaa	I take Latin  Um, honestly, it's pretty hard for me...  Some people get it easily, and some struggle  Basically, if you can practice a lot, and have a good teacher you should be able to grasp the basics. Plus, a lot of words are easy, because you'll find that they resemble English words (English stemmed from Latin, after all).  If you can get all of the cases, and remember the grammer rules, you'll be golden.  Latin IS  a good language to study, because it increases your vocabulary too :)|`|R5UIMBvcaa	I found French a little easier to learn, but then I'd already had a year of Latin when I started French.  Although I loved Latin and still do, I think it's probably a litttle harder for most students than a modern Romance language, because of the many inflections.  But learning something you like and want to know is usually pretty easy!  Besides, Latin will be beneficial to you in many ways, all your life.  It will make it easier for you to learn many other languages; it will improve your English vocabulary and grammar; it will enable you to know what your doctor is talking about--  And the sooner you start any language, the better!|`|sXwBN5sSaa	I think your teacher is pulling your leg! I am a professional linguist who speaks several languages, including Turkish and Hindi;   I can assure you that Latin is *by far* the hardest of all the languages I have studied.|`|E70A7aqcaa	I took Latin in highschool, many decades ago, and, as a Roman Catholic, we said Mass in Latin before the 1960's and the Second Vatican Council, and I can say Mass has never been as beautiful as when it was in Latin.  I'm not sure I'd say it is the easiest language, but it sure is the most beautiful, and the root language for what is known as the Romance languages, which include Italian, Spanish, French, and even English, I believe, and maybe more.  It's a beautiful and artistic language, but not necessarily an easy one, at least for me.  I do wish, however, that I could role back time and take my highschool Latin courses all over again, and try harder with the perspective I've gained over the years, and have all Roman Catholic Masses return to Latin only.  It's so beautiful, and I hope you'll do your absolute best in your Latin class so you won't have regrets of not having learned it as best you could when you had the chance.  God Bless you.

It might disturb the others around me.    I assume that you're referring to Matthew 7:6, which reads "Do not give what is holy to dogs, or throw your pearls before swine, lest they trample them underfoot, and then tear you to pieces."     Dogs and swines were common were Jewish terms of contempt  for Gentiles (non-Jews). When Matthew wrote it, however, he was most likely writing for a Christian community dealing with an obstinately impertinent fellow Christian.    Examples can be found every day here on Answers when you see Catholics constantly dealing with obstinate and impertinent Fundies.

They have a life force , but not all have life force like humans have called the Soul.   The difference is that Life Force don't retain a character like souls...when a life force reincarnate, an eagle can be a bear or a lion.  But a soul...on most circumstances retain to reincarnate as Human.  Life force don't have the consciousness of existence on the after life, souls do.  All souls' evolution are written in the Akashic Record or the Book of Life, while the life force of the animals goes back to the Universe as a collective force.    Animal Life Force on the other hand with divine grace of Sentient can help in the evolution of the Life Force to human soul.  Especially pets...since the empathy and love of Humans masters vibrates these animal life force...and in turn awaken an awareness.  It will take life times for them to fully evolve to Human Soul but setting the motion is what is important.  And they will be grateful for it.    Human Souls...under forbidding circumstances may have bad reincarnation due to allot of karmic causes, and may find himself in the body of an animal...if this happen...suffering will be endless and it will take allot of lifetimes for him to regain his soul.     Sentient Beings seen and unseen are vital to the complex matrix of life and existence, no one is ever alone and truly alone.  All are inter dependent.  Some thought you might have may not be really yours...that some unseen sentient have been dictating it to you to manifestation as your own thought.    There could some your own thoughts and ideas learned from lifetimes...and some unseen force is also learning from you.  This knowledge of good and evil is what makes the matrix of life...thoughts are energy pulses and vibrates the Universe.  Souls and Life Forces are likewise energy of the same force...all in different levels and frequency.|`|C42YeDPuaa	There's NO heaven for everyone and all.|`|0dDT8Hgdaa	the same place as you...dust to dust...or dirt, your choice .  nothing else    hey whack job...if you eat in heaven then you must have to take a dump in heaven too.   you know the BBQs are better in hell|`|HxKfgzB9aa	animals do NOT have souls so they do NOT go to HEAVEN!!|`|ZLabz00naa	apparently, heaven is a place to buy yarn  http://www.yarnheaven.com/images/store/Y...|`|JpgLxU1Laa	lol!!|`|1MgpiqfJaa	animals do not have souls in the biblical sense..God did not breathe life into them as he did Adam..

At any rate, I don't think atheists are more dangerous than a crazy Fundamentalist Christian holding a bible in one hand and a gun in the other.|`|XxDQGEalaa	I think Atheists have eradicated some of the fear in their lives. How can this be anything but good for them? It doesn't mean they will go on a killing spree.....just that they are happier with themselves.
StJGeiFyaa	Technically speaking, yes you're correct. Practically speaking, this is not how it usually works. If you see that they are insulted, by all means, take the high road and explain to them what you meant and tell them you're sorry that you upset them. If they don't express to you their feelings, then it's not really your problem. Although, in the end it will effect your reputation. I would probably end up explaining, and apologizing.|`|rx20pKgOaa	No - you are responsible for your communication.  If it was misunderstood you are responsible for the misunderstanding.  If you wish to be understood correctly it is up to you to send the message in a way that it will be accepted.    Take responsibility.|`|AA11202852	Not necessarily. You may not be aware of the way you come across. Rather than demand an apology, your best option would be to talk to the person, and find out where the conversation went wrong. It takes some effort, but in the end, it's worth it, because the result is usually understanding and forward motion, rather than anger, hurt feelings, and a dead end.|`|O7SshRl6aa	If you realize something you said inadvertently insulted someone, it would be the adult thing to gently apologize in a way like "I'm sorry you misinterpreted what I said.  I meant [explain]".|`|AA11788494	Yes but they probably won't.  You may have to talk to the person if you need to work it out.  If not, let it go.|`|2Y9U5jlGaa	Yes but somtimes you may be saying things that you don't relize could be offensive.|`|Ao3Fl3iSaa	Both parties are at fault.  You for not making yourself clear  and  the other party for not clarifying what you mean|`|28d1daabadd63d26e86fd71474b9230daa	Yes and no. I mean, the person will most likely not apologize to you, and will still harbor a bit of animosity, even if you do say that you meant something else.    Even if you know you're right, this is the type of situation where you just suck it up but acknowledge it. Something like "I'm sorry if I said anything to offend you" should suffice.
Ieqp1kIhaa	Dear,    Peace be upon you.    Mosque is the House of Al-Mighty God Allah Subhanahu Wata'ala, the creator and the governor of the universe. To respect the house of Al-Mighty God Allah Subhanahu Wata'ala, cover your body except both of your palms and face. Wearing tight cloth and show your figure is just like naked. Give Salam (peace be upon you) to the Imam. Tell him straight about your sincere intention. Maybe, to avoid zina you want to marry the man. Maybe the Imam will advice matters to be done. Maybe the Imam will call your parent and advice and will ask your parent to allow you to marry the man that you love.    Wabillahhitaufiq Walhidayah Wassalamu'alaikum Warahmatullahhi Wabarakatuh.|`|VN30ib8eaa	Just make sure when you get into the mosque, call your mom and let her know that you are gonna get married in 30 mins.

You could probably shake his hand or say assalamu alaikum.|`|spOAhjcZaa	just walk in a calmly matter and make shure your clothes are long Wear a long shirt (or a Alba if you have one) just make shure that your shirt covers your bottom and Wear a head scarf  just be calm put on a friendly fase and just tell him your situation.and write down the questions that you want to ask him|`|kjUqJLyKaa	ok well of course as respect it would be nice if you wore long non tightfitting clothes and a scarf. you can start with "i have a problem i hope you can help me with" and go right into it. im sure you'll get the help you need. good luck.. salam
mSFjbetxaa	Because when God made man, he made a few mistakes.  Just like a man, God was lost and did not ask for directions.

Therefore, Eve was a copy of a perfect copy -- so she was ALSO made in the image of God.|`|fdb2eb2f4c9344e092dc65cdb24a9c1eaa	The term, "in His image" has its roots in Genesis 1:27: "God created man in his own image. . ." This passage does not mean that God is in human form, but rather, that humans are in the image of God in their moral, spiritual, and intellectual nature. In other words, humans mirror God's divinity in their ability to actualize the unique qualities with which they have been endowed, and which make them different than all other creatures: rational structure, complete centeredness, creative freedom, a possibility for self-actualization, and the ability for self-transcendence. This obviously goes for women as well as men.|`|2b262d236b57238a4521e83f95a4b9feaa	I know a few women that look like men.  I even know a man that is trying to be a woman (but it's not working very well).      Why do you think this anyway?    Men and women were both made in God's image and God is neither man nor woman.  I think you are confused.    My opinion is woman was taken out of man's side because man needed to understand his need for a woman and see that she was made equal to himself.|`|D4LnRg2Daa	God made us both in his image LHOOQ.

We are made eternal with physical limitations only for a time.

GoRFRY2naa	Re the reply by Splinter, saying that his god made man from his image and that woman was made from man.    THE PERFECT EXAMPLE OF PATRIARCHAL WOMB ENVY!    Men want to be the creators, the ones mon top, the more vital and important sex, and they can never be that bc they lack the ability to create life from their bodies, a talent that women have, thanks to evolution, not some made up god.     The last time I checked, men come from WOMEN, not the other way around!  All people come from women.      To answer your question, it is just another in a long line of examples of patriarchy and misogyny trying to keep women down.  It is completely meaningless in a day and age where it is known that both sexes are necessary for the perpetuation of the human race, and both are created by nature, and that no one has to cover his or her head to appease some nonexistent god.    Lady Morgana|`|JTu1cLkYaa	Check out the creation of man. God created Adam from the dust of the earth. He created Eve from Adam's rib.

It was felt that if the woman covered her hair  then the angels wouldn't get excited and want to have sex with her.I also think it was a visual that said women are beneath men, subservient.|`|IIhiSprlaa	..And you couldn't post the verse for me?|`|casg30Ataa	i refuse to open the holy buy bull|`|47f596346f675aa52012de1d79feedc9aa	Usually with my words.

After the fall, this was no longer entirely true, due to the entrance of sin and rebellion into their souls.    When giving the curses to Adam and Eve, God said that the woman must, from that point on, obey her husband who would "rule over" her.  This means that she is to be submissive to him, because it is his responsibility to guide the family -- a responsibility that Adam failed to perform.  Therefore, a woman who faithfully submits to her husband is a "glory" to him.|`|KhJwOurLaa	Like Suzanne says the Bible states that women must be doormats.|`|91b8e457b5505f973a8026a5f3d8f686aa	1.Please always read a few lines - & + .Read from verse 3 to 10.It is self explanatory,if you really want to obey the Word. Majority is against this message.   2. You are mixing up creation of human with functioning.You question was good if woman was also made as man.Woman was not made from dust.   3.The order of life is given for both, their status & duty is explained in this.|`|XzEGvaXjaa	In the Bible, man (Adam) was created directly in God's image and woman was created from a part of man. Therefore, man is God's glory and woman is man's glory. However, if woman is created in man's glory and man is created in God's glory, then woman would also be created in God's glory (transitive property in geometry; it works in everyday life too). Therefore, both men and women are created in God's image.    And don't take Bible passages out of context. If you do, you'll often find it does not make sense and that's why it often seems as though the Bible is contradicting itself. Here's all of it: "Now I commend you because you remember me in everything and maintain the traditions even as I delivered them to you. But I want you to understand that the head of every man is Christ, the head of a wife is her husband, and the head of Christ is God. Every man who prays or prophesies with his head covered dishonors his head, but every wife who prays or prophesies with her head uncovered dishonors her head, since it is the same as if her head were shaven. For if a wife will not cover her head, then she should cut her hair short. But since it is disgraceful for a wife to cut off her hair or shave her head, let her cover her head. For a man ought not to cover his head, since he is the image and glory of God, but woman is the glory of man. For man was not made from woman, but woman from man. Neither was man created for woman, but woman for man. That is why a wife ought to have a symbol of authority on her head, because of the angels. Nevertheless, in the Lord woman is not independent of man nor man of woman; for as woman was made from man, so man is now born of woman. And all things are from God. Judge for yourselves: is it proper for a wife to pray to God with her head uncovered? Does not nature itself teach you that if a man wears long hair it is a disgrace for him, but if a woman has long hair, it is her glory? For her hair is given to her for a covering. If anyone is inclined to be contentious, we have no such practice, nor do the churches of God" (1 Cor 11:2-16)    This passage is about the traditions of the past and nothing more. But what they are probably is referring to the basic order when it comes to men and women in the Bible. God is over man and man is over woman. However, simply because someone is "over" you does not mean they can treat you whatever way you want or that you are not your own person. Take for example a business. The boss is over you and you are to obey him. But without you, that boss is nothing. Because the boss chose you, the boss needs you, and you make the boss who they are. Same thing with a husband and wife. The husband is supposed to be over the woman, but because you choose each other, you obviously need each other, and without one another you won't be who you are.     Basically: man may be the head, but the woman is the neck and without the neck, the head falls.|`|CBUPymktaa	i dont try to explain things .. but i DO eat m&m's like theyre going out of style ..|`|ZLabz00naa	If we were created in gods image how come we arent invisible?|`|nQ6RZJs0aa	C'mon, at least post it for us heathens with no bibles.|`|6AT498UTaa	It is the order of God.

Christ respects theocratic headship; man and woman are also obligated to do so. The first man, Adam, was not produced by birth from a woman but was created by God. When creating Eve, God used a rib from Adam as a foundation, and God stated that she was to be a helper for Adam.      Thus to man, who was produced first, was assigned the position of head. The man does not wear a head covering when praying or prophesying because, in regard to headship, man is Gods image, having no earthly head in matters relating to his family. However, for a woman to pray or prophesy without a head covering would show disrespect for mans God-assigned position and would shame him. Even the angels, who are members of Jehovahs wifelike heavenly organization, observe the sign of authority worn by faithful Christian women and are reminded of their own subjection to Jehovah.|`|xpvbDnthaa	Paul is wiriting (as he almost always is) to a specific group of people at a specific time, in a specific place, about a specific subject.  (See the "if"s in verse 6 of the same chapter).      Your larger question seems to be about "God's image."  And understanding God is like understanding physics...everybody who can move themself from a to b understands at least something about Newtonian Physics even if they don't know they know.  But that doesn't make them a physicist.      Anyone who senses good from bad knows something about God...but that doesn't make them Mary, Moses, or Abraham.    The happy thing is that we can all keep trying and we can all eventually succeed.  It's all a matter of how you use your own power to choose.|`|XpZumlkwaa	First you need to study the scripture before you make a statement about it. Just taking one part out to justify an argument is foolish.   The veiling of women: Read all of it reader.  What is the first thing a person thinks about when they see a womans head dress covering. Of course they think on a religious basis. It is a sign that she has God in her life. God is directing her life.  Men are not to have their head covered because as men, they represent god-man on earth, if he is a believer in a congregation setting.  Please dont think he cant wear a hat in the winter.  You would think Paul is confusedhe is. Again, proof of what Peter said about his letters. They will lead men to teach his letters all wrong and deceive many people. I Peter 3:16.   For instance, one place he said women ought to be silent but in this instance here he said they should have their head covered before they pray.    What is it going to be Paul? Can we speak or not?  Well, of course we can.  Thank God.          Some women need to learn how to cover-up more parts, so as to not entice men into excitement,(temptation). Thats another topic.
53216puqaa	If he has anything, then he'll need to put it out where it can't be intercepted. That means going public on an international forum. He can not afford to have an injunction to suppress any evidence. That would allow his enemies to have anything he might have ruled not germane to the proceedings. Once that happens then the evidence could be destroyed.  If he does have anything, he'll only have until Noon,Thursday 29 Jan.'09 to break it out.    I think he's done fore.

I yelled to her to give me my clothes. my crush replyed to look out the window. so i got down low so no one could see me and opened the curtain and my clothes were outside. seh said u can get them. but the bathroom was in the front of the house. I thought she was kidding. but i was in the bathroom for 10 minutes. then decided to go for it. i knew if i jumped out the window i would land behind a bush. so i did. then she must have been waiting for me to go because she went in the bathroom shut and locked the window. then ran outside and grabbed my clothes before i got to them. and locked the door inside.. i freaked! i was locked outside butt naked. I couldnt run inside or my jason would see me nude and i didnt want that! Then the front door opened. my friend says hey you can come in i sent Jason upstairs, im not lieing! youve been embarrased enough! so i stood up about to run and a bunch of guys from school drove bye, screaming! then stopped and pulled into her driveway. so i went back to the bush!because i had barley left it! but they came over to me! and laughed! and then took out their phones and took my picture! and videos and said hey stacy do you need some clothes? but i like this look of yours way better, why dont you come to school like this. you will be very popular with the guys. they left i ran inside got dressed. and left in tears!later that night i found out the guys sent the pictures to everyone! the bush i hid in did no good to cover me up! i was so embarrased that the entire school saw a naked picture of me, in a bush.|`|nsZuZ1O9aa	Same happened to me! well, it wasn't a poem but she looked through a journal I used to write in.

2DJNz3Exaa	I was 16 and it was Homecoming night (i was in highschool).. I went to a friends house and three of us drank alcohol and then I drove to the homecoming football game with my friends and I ran into a tree. I totaled my car and split open one of my friends heads. I got arrested when the police came and then when i went to the hospital they took a urine sample. The urine sample came back positive for marijuana and showed that my blood alcohol concentration was higher at the hospital than at the scene of the accident (where i was given a breathalizer as i was being arrested). This resulted in me spending the next entire year going to court every month facing charges against under age drinking, DUI, driving under the influence of marijuana, not to mention the amount of time it wasted. In addition to that, the car was scrapped, the court fees were in the thousands and the lawyer costed a couple thousand too.. it definately was not worth it and was the most irresponsible thing i have ever done in my life.|`|7k6TKpIzaa	This is probably a homework question, isn't it.

I'm bi-sexual (curious*).    Muscles: I would rather not have muscles on a guy but I wouldn't mind if a female has tiny muscles.    Weight: I found that I don't really care what weight a person is. I can see myself being with girls that weigh more than myself- in fact, I'd rather it be that way. I don't mind for guys but I can't imagine myself being with a guy if he weighs a lot.    Skin color: No problem.|`|Nsgh1XzLaa	muscular body with six pack, same or a little taller than me, deep voice, good personality, and has to act (not always) masculine.  ill totally kill for that type of guy.  those are the types of guys that make me feel weak.|`|Idb89cCeaa	A muscle bear but not overly muscled because thats what I am.|`|sEotS9K1aa	give me a manly man please!    when a guy is athletic, toned, and all that good stuff (not crazy body builder. muscles are nice, but to a point), he'll attract me like walmart attracts shoppers! i typically go for a preppy look, but it really doesn't matter. there are a few things i dont like though. goth/emo is not my type at all. but other than that i the look doesnt really matter.    so. if the guy is tall. athletic. and comfortable with himself, then i'll jump all over that :D    one last thing. i like guys because i like GUYS. so im not into super fem gays. they are awesome, dont get me wrong, but not the type i would preferably date.    the end.    **fun question!|`|lCwjDDcoaa	I dont like them to big, but they can't be smaller then me. :)   She needs to have hips too.|`|fdMKpXCHaa	Toned, smooth bodies.

StJGeiFyaa	The rehearsal dinner is paid for by the groom's parents. The wedding is paid for by the bride's parents. The honeymoon is paid for by the groom. This is all traditionally speaking, of course.|`|0d4X54rMaa	as i recall.. it's the parents of the guy who pay for rehursal dinner  the groom pays for the honeymoon and the girl pays for the wedding    if the parents don't pay then it's the bride and groom themselves who pay|`|ZeFyWGOCaa	There are books and magazines about typical expectations for different aspects of the wedding event.  The rehearsal dinner is traditionally paid for by the groom's family, and includes the wedding party, immediate family, and out-of-town guests.  Gifts are not part of a rehearsal dinner, there might be a toast by the groom's father and/or host.  Please feel free to buy a Bride Magazine.|`|rx20pKgOaa	When my son got married my husband and I hosted the rehearsal dinner at a restaurant and yes, we paid for everything. (We preselected the menu.)    We also provided a small gift, a personalized engraved memento, for everyone who attended but that is not required.    Whatever the setting the grooms family is responsible for hosting, (and taking on the costs) of the rehearsal dinner.|`|0td65n04aa	Usually the groom's parents pay for the rehearsal dinner and the bride and groom get small gifts for the groomsmen and bridesmaids.  A lot of times the bride will give her bridesmaids special jewelry to wear at the wedding and guys usually a monogram money clip or something along those lines.  The guest list would include anyone who is at the wedding rehearsal.  However, if you are paying for your own wedding or the groom's parents cannot or are not willing to pay for the dinner you would be responsible for it.  It could be something informal in that case like pizza at your home or something along those lines.

The dangers of formalized religion are: fixation of beliefs and crystallization of sentiments; accumulation of vested interests with increase of secularization; tendency to standardize and fossilize truth; diversion of religion from the service of God to the service of the church; inclination of leaders to become administrators instead of ministers; tendency to form sects and competitive divisions; establishment of oppressive ecclesiastical authority; creation of the aristocratic "chosen-people" attitude; fostering of false and exaggerated ideas of sacredness; the routinizing of religion and the petrification of worship; tendency to venerate the past while ignoring present demands; failure to make up-to-date interpretations of religion; entanglement with functions of secular institutions; it creates the evil discrimination of religious castes; it becomes an intolerant judge of orthodoxy; it fails to hold the interest of adventurous youth and gradually loses the saving message of the gospel of eternal salvation.

I've learned in my religious experiences that informed, educated and open-minded individuals are willing to entertain questions about what was written and how it should be interpreted, whereas those who are opinionated and closed-minded refuse to. However, it goes against some religions to question what was written in their respective texts, and ergo close followers of a given religion will not entertain those questions. I guess that'd part of being closed minded, but people who live in cultures that adhere to a single religion and follow traditions of people like them who followed the same religion before them are less likely to want to discuss whats written or interpret it any differently than anyone else did.|`|FuqdMHfMaa	ask me anything you like.  i am willing and ready to answer.    lol, wait let me pull out my Nave's Topical Bible, KJV Bible, ASV Bible, and my Greek Dictionary.    no, actually, i think i'll stick with bible.com    haha    seriously, ask away.  what do you want to know?|`|FK3lCrUaaa	We are free to question what is written in the Bible.|`|SOza8NBqaa	First of all, the Bible is not "our" holy book as compared with other religions holy books.  Our holy book is filled with unholy characters but a holy God qualified them for heaven by grace. The only holy character in it is the Jesus, the Holy One of God.  All of us rascals, guilty sinners as we are, need to be justified by grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus.  No other holy book has that message.  They all promote works salvation, do this and do that, take a pilgimmage here, pray 5 times toward such and such a city as you are alright.      What question would you like to discuss over what was written?

JCnSm91uaa	Dora... You are awesome...!!! Good point!!!    When the Bible was written and up to about 500 years ago this microscopic speck of dust that we call Earth located at the edge of the Milky Way was thought to be the center of this humongous universe. The Bible writers got their science from the Babylonians who also believed that the stars were hanging from a firmament as they revolve around the Earth and the rain water was coming down from above the firmament and that the Sun was not a star and so on.  When the Christians ruled most of the Western world anybody disagreeing with this Church dogma on science in the Bible was severely punished. Galileo was one of the most famous victims of Church cruelty. Throughout history the Christians struggled to stop any scientific and social advancement to benefit mankind outside their control.  The Bible writers never stopped coming up with new ideas on how to discipline and keep under Clergy control the people that God loves so much. The Bible writers provided all the necessary instructions for Judeo-Christianity not to function without an authoritarian Clergy organization!            Deuteronomy 17:12-13 (NIV) The man who shows contempt for the judge or for the PRIEST who stands ministering there to the Lord your God MUST BE PUT TO DEATH! You must purge the evil from Israel. ALL THE PEOPLE WILL HEAR AND BE AFRAID, AND WILL NOT BE CONTEMPTUOUS AGAIN* (*Holy Mafia talk! Most low IQ Christians of the Westboro class love it!)    Luke 16:17 (NIV) (Jesus said) It is easier for heaven and earth to disappear than for the least stroke of a pen to drop out of the Law.    For every expression of loving recognition when you behave according to this Gods dysfunctional pleasures the Bible writers listed countless vicious warnings of punishment if you dont. Check Deut 28. The first 14 verses are teasers, but the remaining 54 verses will blow your mind! No wonder Christians hate to read the Bible. They are very content paying their tithes and offerings to the Church and letting their favorite preachers tell them what Christianity ought to be all about! They ignore that this narcissist God wants his obedient followers to be despicably cruel to the members of their own families to the extreme of killing them for any trivial matter that displeases him. In fact, God wants to have all the inhabitants of a city killed and the city totally destroyed if they begin to worship another God (Deut 13:13-19).  Even within Christianity the definition of God varies from one brand of a Christian faith to another! Only the secular law and order prevents Christians from going crazy killing anybody worshiping the wrong brand of a God like the Christian Crusaders did in the Middle-Ages.    The Bible writers say that God already destroyed the whole human race including innocent children and pregnant women once before in a big flood because they became wicked! Only a psychopathic God in the most primitive cultures would act this way (Psa 78:65).|`|wdmp9eYXaa	i was taught in Sunday School that the Bible was written by the HAND of GOD using humans to do the actual writing. therefore what you read in the BIBLE is supposed to be the actual words from GOD HIMSELF.|`|Mok3ewI2aa	Religion = Idiocy.|`|25qUTYLEaa	I trust in God, not in man.

You don't have one, its just a question, right?  Well your question is an epistemological one, not a religious one. Your question is "how can we KNOW that x, y, and z happened", and its plainly true we cant.   If religion (whatever one your thinking about, if your thinking about a specific one) argues humans as imperfect, and at the same time, argues humans should trust the scriptures as God's word and scriptures were written by humans, then yes, we should reject the scriptures as God's word because they were written by humans.     But that in now way means theres no God, it just means the scriptures aren't Gods "words" and Gods "words" are different from Gods "ways".     Just because we should reject the Scriptures as Gods "words", as our conclusion has established regarding the epistemology of your question, that in no way implies we should reject the Scriptures as Gods "ways".     If you want to question whether or not the scriptures as Gods ways you will have to find a new contradiction, respectively.    Im sure they are around.|`|bkav003oaa	We can trust the Bible because not only is it a book of fulfilled prophecy but a book of practical and clear counsel.

But Jehovah who know all things i believe picked people who were very trustworthy. and all the bible writers where good people so what are you talking about??!!|`|YMrkBr1qaa	it's like the universal conscious thing, we are all attached to the universal conscious and the guys who wrote the bible were tapping the universal conscious which is god. you have the same ability to tap that power that the guys back in the bible days had. how do you think people figure scientific formulas out, they don't sit around and ponder them, they tune them in, as you get older you will find more and more that you operate off of intuition than you do knowledge. things Will just come to you without your having studied the basics. that's the universal conscious and as you progress through life , you learn to tune that in. those old timers were just tuning into god and passing it on verbally until someone decided to write it down. ask god any question you want and then wait and see if the answer doesn't come to you. but you gotta speak to god in the voice, he is a spirit and you have to speak to spirits. god will answer any question you ask him. even if you don't profess to be a prophet.|`|3Bc4FoLdaa	Religion can say we're imperfect or perfect or that my blood is really green and not red, but it's the Bible that tells me "all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God", not religion.  That's in Romans 3:23.    So, believing the Bible, I move over to II Timothy 3:16 where it says, "All Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness, that the man of God may be complete, thoroughly equipped for every good work.     The trouble is, without faith, a person will say, what came first, the Bible or the man?  So, I could argue Biblical points with you until my blood really is green, and it wouldn't get anywhere.

fIK9LBEuaa	I'm Catholic, so I'm also Christian.     I think, as well as my very conservative family, that not kissing before marriage is a little extreme. I also think the courtship is a little old-fashioned, and they should get to date to see who they should truly spend the rest of their life with. I do commend them for not having sex until marriage, though. I don't think that's to extreme and I say that anyone who wants to wait should wait. They won't get a STD, they won't get pregnant, and they won't have any regrets.    I think the parents did a great job of raising their kids. I don't know any other religious family that every single one of their kids believe in God and want to live a religious lifestyle. Much less 18 of them! I also think that if you have enough money and love to support kids, then you should have as many as you want. They can obviously afford to live debt free, and all the children are nourished and loved. So good for them.     I also think the Michelle and Jim Bob are a little hypocritical. Michelle was on birth control for the first part of their marriage. I absolutely understand that they want their children to learn from their mistakes, but how many young, newlywed couples can afford to start having children right away?    In conclusion, I think the Duggars have done good for themselves. They don't deserve a lot of the negative attention that they seem to be receiving.|`|h9ELsZUVaa	as many as ya can pop out.|`|fL7858DMaa	The problem with the Duggars (ok, just one of the many) is that they're part of the Quiverfull movement. This movement is based on the fact that European ("white") race has been declining, and hardcore devout christians believe that God thinks "white" race is the best, so they "let god" give them as many kids as "he" wants, so they can rebuild the white race in praise of him. Dont believe me? read about it sometime. its pretty f'ing awful.|`|TnquzeM5aa	http://images.wikia.com/wikiality/images...|`|XwQxKwRcaa	Of course I wouldn't. Geez.

I don't agree with everything in their life, (considering I'm an atheist) But their kids seem fine. Now, I myself couldn't deal with that many kids. It seems to extreme to me and waiting till marriage for your first kiss seems a little extreme.

Kissing's not sex. And I'm not a Christian, so I won't talk about how they raise their kids.
Euj25fcXaa	sure.. yes, i will do.
3Log8BVeaa	2 thoughts regarding this question:    1) I am not so sure how arguing atheism as a *religion* is helpful.  I do see how it is beneficial to show an atheist that he too has *faith* -- that tomorrow will come, that a given chair will hold them, etc, etc.    2) Though an atheist may state that he is being purely scientific, I would argue that my Bible and Christianity are in perfect harmony with science.  I do not feel that there are two categories:  faith vs. science.  In fact, I believe that God is the author of science.  He has told us in many instances that He is the God of order, not disorder.|`|YZv8Ub3Haa	There is no "god of atheism".

When you logged on to Yahoo Answers, you were using science.  You were using the ability to type, the ability to use electricity, the ability to use a computer, and  the ability to connect to the internet.  All these things were made possible because of science.      Atheists don't worship science and the scientific method any more than theists do.  We know that science is a tool to study the natural world, and know that the scientific method, with it's peer review, is a pretty reliable method for getting at the truth of things.|`|LGBNKuxRaa	no, that would be nature, or reality (if anything). science is a method, not a thing, and anyone can use it.|`|BIl0MOHGaa	There is no god of atheism.

We just tend to like it because it works.|`|53MiP9bEaa	science is a tool used by the human race to measure, observe and utilize the natural world.  It's also been used to create things like Oh say the internet your on right now making smart @$$ remarks.  It's also been used to disprove christianity and intelligent design and all that crap.  The same scientific methods used to create the ToE were used to harness electricity.  So if you really want to be a good christian I suggest you throw your computer away.  Maybe go live with some nice Amish folk.|`|2VFR5AKHaa	dont be daft|`|eDYXQxA9aa	Atheism = lack of belief in god/s    Therefore, no.|`|nEw1ZccTaa	yes.

The idea of god applies to religion, only, and is not applicable to atheism. There are two types of science: 1) the Scientific Method, and 2) the scientific community in social terms. There is nothing to worship or reverence with regard to science. Science does involve ethics. If one claims to have used the Scientific Method to validate ideas, for instance, it is assumed that person really did so, and the work should be reproducable.
Wo5Ezmwiaa	Hmmm...well I always thought that it'd be fun to have sex to Maroon 5. Their album "It Won't Be Soon Before Long" especially.  Also, 30 Seconds to Mars, their 2nd album "A Beautiful Lie" would be exciting to have sex to.  I guess it just depends on your taste in music. I don't like country either, but I think Maroon 5 sounds sexy, since a lot of their songs are actually about doing it.|`|LVe6MJfMaa	Let's get it on - Marvin Gaye  No pun intended.|`|pd2GnHnIaa	underoath  when the sun sleeps  AWESOME SONG!!^^|`|DMfNi6Pwaa	Give me your sex|`|V2IJHt94aa	Sonic Youth- Bull in the Heather      Put it on repeat.

They're romantic and dreamy, with a soft sound that still stirs real emotions. Their songs are different and recognizeable, but at the same time they're similar enough to go by fluidly from track to track, ie, they don't take away from the moment. Of course, everybody's different. Is there a song that you and your partner identify with? That's always good. Or, you could take an album that your partner really enjoys, regardless of your feelings about it, and play it on repeat.|`|2nQynHp7aa	Between the sheets- Isley brothers   or the slowed down version with different lyrics:  Luxurious- Gwen Stefani    That synthy guitar lookin' piano "funk" sound gets me in the 70's frisky mood haha...|`|NVSvpNLiaa	I remember this one song.... oh, how did it go??    *remembers*    "I wanna li- li- li- lick you from your head to your toes," etc., etc., and they would talk about sexual positions.

The name given to a river or canal located in Babylonia, NW of Babylon, where Ezra gathered together certain Jews and held a fast before undertaking the trek to Jerusalem. (Ezr 8:15, 21,?31) It evidently was a journey of about eight or nine days from Babylon. (Compare Ezr 7:9; 8:15,?31.) Herodotus (I, 179) speaks of a little river named Is, which flows into the Euphrates, and states that the city of Is on this river is about eight days journey from Babylon. Is has been identified with the modern Hit, and some suggest this as the probable location of Ahava.    Concerning the town of Hit, The New Encyclopaedia Britannica (1987, Vol. 5, p. 949) says: On the Euphrates River, Hit is a small walled town built on two mounds on the site of an ancient city; bitumen wells in the vicinity have been utilized for at least 3,000 years and were used in the building of Babylon. This source of bitumen may correspond to the Biblical account of the construction of the Tower of Babel, in which bitumen served for mortar.Ge 11:3.|`|K3PR7Mivaa	Ezra 8:21   river Ahava  Then I proclaimed a fast there, at the river of Ahava, that we might afflict ourselves before our God, to seek of him a right way for us, and for our little ones, and for all our substance

lz4nK3ibaa	People with Asperger's tend to not be so socially aware, so having a sharp sense of style may not be a frequent occurrence within people with an ASD (Autistic Spectrum Disorder) but its definitely possible. Who knows her uniqueness may be the very reason she could be considered cool, and that "sassy" aloof attitude may in fact be a way of disguising her anxiety and inability to converse comfortably at a high level.     There's not one specific pin pointing symptom of Asperger's, there are many so people can have some traits and maybe not another.|`|JiWQlMlmaa	Isn't Aspergers a social disorder, like a form of autism? It doesn't seem like you really have it, if that's what you mean. You don't seem socially handicapped.|`|wF2G3Krcaa	Hot, yes, cool valley girl? No. They don't know how to act in social situations and they would probably be known as the hot loner, or the hot angry girl before they were the hot valley girl.|`|AA11759000	You stumbled on something VERY interesting here....  I have AS (and male)...    Here's what i noticed (and i'm right, i have the mind to work this stuff out).    The more sexy you LOOK the less you will have Aspergers, hence the blond thick type syndrome most people think about.    This also works on the "computer geek" no one will go out with, more likely to be AS (aspergers syndrome).    Its been proven your face features are different with AS, animals can see it, most with AS connect with dogs and cats very well, you talk to a dog it WILL listen as it can see your not the same, not only in smell as AS don't have social skills AND women can see it, as they don't feel "connected" to you and dont want sex with anyone AS as its a genetic make up...    The age old rumors are ALWAYS based on fact, it takes wisdom to word them out...    "Large car, no sex" true, large car = loads of money = works hard and good at there JOB (= AS) also means unable to get women for sex as they have AS so no sex....  There's always a truth behind the saying.    I have a HUGE car (BMW) and AS, i haven't had sex in YEARS (and we are talking over 10 years).    So to answer your question, if you find you get left out of parties 9 times out of 10 then you have AS, however if you have more than 1 friend who WILL ring you and talk to you every 2 days then you DO NOT have AS....  If you make friends very easy then you dont have it....    And women are way less likely to get it anyway (its 80% a male thing), its a spectrum disorder so everyone has it to a degree, its only when you are so much of it that it creates a problem,

HUXMgyp1aa	Absolutely. You tested their teachings just as they tell you to do and found them to be false. I'm very happy for you and I admire you for acting on your convictions. I get the impression that getting out is not easy and comes with all sorts of complications and hardships. Enjoy your freedom and never stop seeking.    Ask, and you will receive; seek, and you will find; knock, and the door will be opened to you. For everyone who asks will receive, and anyone who seeks will find, and the door will be opened to those who knock. Would any of you who are fathers give your son a stone when he asks for bread? Or would you give him a snake when he asks for a fish? As bad as you are, you know how to give good things to your children. How much more, then, will your Father in heaven give good things to those who ask him!

EDIT:But good for you if you left it out of feelings of constriction.

They also believe they should not get blood transfusions.  But if their members are doctors and nurses they have to give them, how contrarry to what they believe.  Also they believe that they should not let others pray for them if they are not Jehovah's Witness. They go door to door preaching their gospel making everyone else's religion be in vain by the way they approach people telling them their the only true religion. Ask them if they believe in Jesus? they will tell you he is God's son but when you tell them they have to accept him as their saviour, they will tell you that Jehovah is the only one they worship.
AA11232725	The Bible didn't start to be written unitl Moses wrote the first 5 books somewhere around 1500 BC. Moses came from Egypt and lived as a Prince there so he knew how to write and how to produce writing materials. Whether he used papyrus or animal skins or tablets, no one knows for sure.    As to why God chose to use a book that his Spirit moved the hands of men to write, I guess it's because God knew that was the best way to make sure that people could have a common record so that if someone claimed that God had said something in the past they could look it up.    God didn't only communicate with writings however.    Hebrews 1:1  God, who at various times and in various ways spoke in time past to the fathers by the prophets,  2  has in these last days spoken to us by  His Son, whom He has appointed heir of all things, through whom also He made the worlds;  3  who being the brightness of  His glory and the express image of His person, and upholding all things by the word of His power, when He had by Himself purged our sins, sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high,|`|9ZwFQadRaa	Moses was the first to put the Bible on paper.

I've been calling myself that for years. Actually, I've been agnostic longer than I've been an atheist. I'm well aware of the definition of agnosticism.|`|JQ3J5cdZaa	Despite what most people think there is a difference between atheists and agnostics, granted it's similar to the differences between christian sects that we believe similar things in different ways.  Atheists believe absolutely that there is no god, agnostics don't even have that much belief and typically don't care one way or the other.  Then you also have existentialism that says if there is a god the human mind wouldn't be able to comprehend such a being anyway so why bother thinking about it.  I've known atheists that are just as closed minded as the most devote christians when it comes to their beliefs, agnostics tend to be more open minded about the possibility of there being a god or not.  I'm not trying to say all atheists are closed minded just like not all christians are I'm just trying to point out the fundamental differences like you asked.  I can't say one way or the other if there is or isn't a god so I consider myself agnostic rather than atheist.    Edit:  There are levels in all things and most people, myself included, tend to take atheism to mean "strong atheisim" the absolute belief that there is no god.  If you want to take atheisim as simply the lack of belief in deities then yes a lot of agnostics are then also atheist but they aren't mutually exclusive.  Atheist don't believe in deities, Agnostics say there isn't enough evidence about the exsistance/nonexsistance of deities to say for sure.  While yes that lack of evidence leads most to not believe you can still recognize the lack of evidence but believe anyway.  So honestly if you were to ask me "Do I believe in God?"  My answer would be "I don't know, I need more proof one way or the other."
AA10100036	If you're looking to improve your conversational skills, I suggest getting a penpal (or an email/IM buddy).  The conversation moves slowly enough that you can really think about what you want to say.  The more practice you get, the better you'll be at carrying a conversation.

That God gave man a specific duty to respect women and be equal with them.

That does not mean that women are to bow down and worship the man at anytime nor is he to rule over her by being domineering or being a dictator.  Absolutely no abuse ever.  Remember when God created man, he said it was not good to be alone, so he gave him a helpmate and a soul mate.

Similarly, the husband is supposed to follow the commands of Jesus.    Note, however, that the bible ALSO instructs husbands to "love their wives as their own bodies".  Notice how well this corresponds to the Jesus/man relationship.  Jesus' commandments are for our own good!  Jesus is giving us commands NOT to please himself, but for our sakes.  Similarly, WHEN a husband "commands" his wife, it should ONLY be when such "commands" are for her own good or the good of the family as a whole.  The "man" is a commander, not a jail-keeper or puppet-master.    Jim, http://www.bible-reviews.com|`|0e4fea790f4ea59363811798798d53a0aa	Man was made in God's image. Woman was made from man.

And it never works unless the man is willing to lay down his life for the wife like Jesus laid down his life for the church.And the bible says for each to submit to one another.Submission is simply to be under ( sub) a mission.

4095b081c8ae931b4eebbb56c3c07a64aa	Pot is illegal by federal law, however, it has been decriminalized by some states.  But you're still subject to federal laws.  The issue is there are currently not (albeit Obama is working on it) a federal police force for patrolling civilian areas.  But it is not technically illegal.    Prostitution is different as there is not a federal law defining prostitution as a crime.  The statute which criminalizes prostitution is done in each states respective criminal code.  Note that in Nevada prostitution is legal OUTSIDE of Las Vegas and only indoors, not street solicitation.      In Rhode Island it is also decriminalized indoors due to legal precedent, but not specifically legal.  No where is street prostitution legal.  Prostitution is either legal, decriminalized, or tolerated in most countries other than the U.S., including Canada, Mexico, most of Europe (except UK) Australia, New Zealand, Japan -- everywhere but Muslim countries and other totalitarian countries like China, North Korea, etc.  We're in great company, huh?      Legalizing both is something we should be seriously considering right now.  First, by way of disclosure, I am totally anti-drug.  I smoked pot continuously for about 6 months when I was maybe 13.  All it did for me was lead me to loathe potheads and pot dealers (and still do.)      We absolutely need to deal with the drug culture in this country as it is the worst thing that ever happened to the American people.  90% of crime and social ills are a result of drugs.  And the irony is the vast majority of drug addicts are miserable.  The women (or the guys -- think about it) who resort to prostitution to get the next fix; you think they're having a party?  Yet another legacy of the baby boomers -- who have done everything possible to destroy this country.    But here is the deal.  Pot represents about 70% of the profits from narco gangs and Mexican Mafia (La eMe, Nuestra Familia, et al.)  We can easily link several of the greatest threats to our country to the criminalization of crime -- more than 80% of U.S. crime, funding of terrorism and domestic terror cells, illegal immigration, wholesale deterioration of boarder communities, exploitation of children, government costs out of control, etc.    So not doing the worst thing (as was done here in Massachusetts) of simply decriminalizing pot (simply an economic stimulus bill for the Mexican criminal gangs) but the actual legalization and regulation of pot.    That would overnight eliminate 70% of the profit margin of drug gangs, and about 80%+ of the interaction between drug pushers and minors.  This would make the remaining problem much more manageable.     The rumor was that Obama would toy with 'decriminalizing' pot, not legalizing it.  What that means is you would get only a minor offense for possession, but it will still be illegal to grow and sell it.  That means we would get no benefit, just more consumption and thus an even greater problem than we're facing today.    The only viable strategy is to actually legalize and regulate pot, just as we did we the repeal of the 18th Amendment.  While we're at it, we should lower the drinking age to 18 for purchase and 16 for consumption in the presence of guardians, and raise the minimum age for obtaining a driver's license to 18.|`|l1ctIW7eaa	because some states are backwards    a bunch of rednecks get outraged any time someone wants to decriminalize a harmless weed, and then go home and ruin their liver with alcohol, maybe beat their wife while they're at it|`|EXurNsB4aa	Because each state has a certain amount of autonomy to govern its own citizens.|`|0dbDQh8Haa	each state has their own opinion on these issues so each state votes separately.|`|SLBb7uWgaa	Because some states are controlled by the religion, especially Catholic who is in-favor for marijuana and prostitution.|`|5fLEd3o5aa	Each state is able to vote for or against certain laws but in my opinion both should be legal!

XN0cYCATaa	While the word "dinosaur" is a relatively new word, there seems to be evidence in many places around the world that men and these creatures have co-existed.  In the Bible, when God is responding to Job, in Job 40 and 41, we see two creatures described, the 'behemoth' and the 'leviathan.'  Both are described as extremely large animals and seem reminiscent of descriptions of a dinosaur and a giant sea creature.  Although Bible notes in many modern translations suggest these animals might be a hippo, a crocodile, an elephant, or other known animals, the Biblical descriptions defy those identifications.   http://www.rae.org/pteroets.html        The Bible and Pterosaurs:  Archaeological and Linguistic Studies of Jurassic Animals that Lived Recently         The Chinese histories and legends abound with dinosaurs.  But they are not called "dinosaurs."  They are called "dragons."  The dragon is one of the twelve animals of the Chinese zodiac.  What is interesting is that all the other eleven are commonly known animals and there is no hint of 'mythology' involved with their identities.  It seems as if the dragon was just a commonly known at one time.  The pictures are often fantastical, but so are their stylized pictures of horses and other animals.  I checked the web for accessible information on this.  I was able to find a few things that were not having to do with video games, sculptures, movies, items for sale, and such.  The following links may be of interest.  There are more.  If you have access to books, you might want to check the epic of Beowulf, in which he battles a monster.  If you have access to a good book on the history of art, you may be able to see some dragons and sea monsters painted on ancient Roman pottery.   The legends abound all over the world.  They do not seem to be connected to each other, but each telling of its own place.  We have the story of St. George and the Dragon; there is the reference regarding Alexander the Great of his army disturbing some giant monster in a cave on their way to India.  The American Indian thunderbird may very well be one of the ancient flying reptiles.  An excellent essay by Lourella Rouster is "The Footprints of Dragons," at http://rae.org/dragons.html         A couple of pages which chronicle a bit the possible existence of monsters in Europe are dragon myths from Austria http://www.strangescience.net/stdino2.ht... page includes two paintings of dragons from the seventeenth century that are quite interesting!          Doug Sharp, whose webpage "Revolution Against Evolution" has Rouster's essay, also carries the following:   http://rae.org/tuba.html         The Rhamphorhynchoid Pterosaur --  Scaphognathus crassirostris: A "Living Fossil" Until the 17th Century   All in all, then, there is reason to doubt the evolutionist timeline that says dinosaurs -- or the dragons -- died out before man ever arrived.

By the way, Job is supposed to be the oldest book in the Bible, so he may have seen dinosaurs.|`|yu53u5TFaa	So you're saying that the Bible MUST be true because it mentions animals people know about and have known about...?|`|LGBNKuxRaa	hello circular reasoning, how are you?    one might think you'd decide if it's a dinosaur based on whether the description specifically matches what's known about dinosaurs. but you don't do that, why not?|`|FSDjC3Uyaa	Dinos died out around 70,000,000 years ago.  Mankind wasn't around until 2,000,000 years ago.  Job was a tall tale written to explain a point, belief in a particular god in every adversity, about 2800(?) years ago.  Dinos weren't recognized for what they were until around 250 years ago.  Quit trying to make someting out of you fairy tale bible.

1NHzFpHNaa	In order to graduate from school she needed to take a few more classes...and she left the school before doing so.|`|R5UIMBvcaa	It means that she left secondary school or college before she completed her last course requirements for a diploma or a degree.|`|01NUrwfYaa	means she didn't have enough credits (credit hours) (maybe from high school or college) and she wasn't able to graduate.    in univ every hour is a credit so 12 credits is about 4 courses...    in h.s. it depends    but 5 credits is one semester or .5 is on semester so depends.|`|a6fUSU2Paa	She left school without enough credits to graduate.|`|UsbG30Gaaa	There are two different meanings.    1.)

N9WzNLsRaa	They're both light skinned... So they're both more accepted. And they're black... Black people don't exactly fit America's standard of beauty at all... No matter how light your skin is, or how straight your hair is, or how light your eyes are.    When compared to other black people, they may be seen as more attractive... But not when compared to other white people.

To the majority of non-Blacks, Blacks are not desirable at all. Just hanging out on Yahoo Answers shows this fact.    To the guy below me:  1) Most white girls don't like Black guys. I just don't see many girls of any race going for Blacks; they pine over non-Blacks though.    2) I could care less. I don't like white girls; I like japanese girls.|`|pC1rRb9Oaa	both would do very well in african surveys|`|4a43ce24fc25ee210c17b8882b616386aa	@ ello Omarion is not light he's medium brown but light skin has nothing to do with attractiveness.

EtCRnDJMaa	I love it!|`|X9rXRNUxaa	You misunderstand the nature of Hell. You say He doesn't HAVE to let people go there. So you think it's better for those people just to suffer in sin?   According to the Bible, Hell does not yet exist, but will at the end of the Millennium. When people die (both the righteous and the wicked), they do not go directly to Heaven or Hell, nor do they "float around" as ghosts. They both remain in the grave, in a state of "sleep" where they have absolutely no consciousness of anything, nor the passage of time, until Christ returns. At that time, Christ will resurrect the Saved of all time back to permanent, physical life and take them with Him to Heaven, while the Wicked living at that time will be slain by the brightness of His coming. Both they and the Wicked dead of all time shall remain dead for another 1,000 years. During that time, all life on this Earth will be dead, and Satan will be trapped here on this dark, dismal planet littered with corpses during that Millennium. At the end of the 1,000 years, Christ will return with His Saved to judge the wicked (who will be resurrected into their old, mortal bodies), including Satan and his angels. Every person will see every sin they've ever committed. Satan will attempt to lead them in an attack on the New Jerusalem, but then Hellfire will rain down from Heaven and consume them all. They will be instantly and permanently incinerated, never to exist again. They will NOT be "tortured forever", as the pagan idea of Catholicism suggests. This is not scriptural. Even Satan and his angels will be destroyed in this fire; he will NOT be tending it, poking people with a pitchfork!   The fire will completely cover planet Earth from pole to pole, burning up EVERYTHING, even the elements themselves, and all the ocean water will be evaporated. It will completely remove all trace of sin and sinners forever. Once its work is finished, it will burn out on its own. Some people use the Biblical verse that says the fire will be "unquenchable", but that only means that it cannot be PUT out, but it will burn out on its own.  Once this fire has burned out, then God will set about to re-creating the Earth the way it was in the Beginning - perfect, beautiful and unspoiled. Then the Saved of all time will be allowed to live on it, and build permanent homes and grow their own food. All the animals will be friendly, even former meat-eaters. I'm really looking forward to it.    May God bless you as you study His Word        King James Bible|`|qbelhflAaa	YES.|`|XgejRqWsaa	I WANT ONE.

As you leave your body  you realize something is happening. You hear a sound. . . getting louder and louder. . . screaming . . .weeping. . . wailing. Terror and fear beyond anything you could imagine overtakes you. "This cant be happening!" you scream. Your nostrils are filling with the awful stench of burning souls. Your face ignites from the heat. Flames are now blazing from your eyes, nostrils, ears, mouth  every opening in your body, flames are roaring out. Your body is sizzling and crackling from the flames.     Your body is now madly thrashing and convulsing from the horrible pain. "Why dont I die?", you scream. You begin weeping and gnashing your teeth with the millions. "When will this pain stop?" But you know it will never stop. . .    The darkness is so terrifying, it begins engulfing you. You feel something moving in the darkness. . . something horrible is happening. "No! No! This cant be happening" you scream  as your worm is emerging.     You begin cursing the day you were born. You scream  "Oh God, why didnt you warn me?" but you remember the preacher pleading with you to receive Jesus Christ. You remember reading that gospel tract. You cry  "God dont you care?"  but you remember John 3:16 "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son,. . ." "God is a God of love  He won't allow this", you cry  but you remember John 3:36, ". . . he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him."    And you soon realize, that Jesus Christ was right!  There is a place called hell. AND YOU ARE THERE______ FOREVER.       In heaven there will be no sin, suffering, sorrow, or pain. We will never do anything to displease God. There will be no persecution, division, disunity, or hate. In heaven there will be no quarrels or disagreements. There will be no disappointments. There will be no weeping because there will be nothing to make us sad.     And this is how heaven is described in the bible    Rev 21:16 And the city lieth foursquare, and the length is as large as the breadth: and he measured the city with the reed, twelve thousand furlongs. The length and the breadth and the height of it are equal.   It says that this city is foursquare. That means that it is cube shaped. The length, breadth, and height are all equal.   The city measures 12,000 furlongs.   There are 8 furlongs to a mile. So that means that this city is 1,500 miles in length and 1,500 miles in breadth, and 1,500 miles high.   Heaven is foursquare like a cube. You could set one corner of it on the city of New York. Another corner would reach to Denver, Colorado. From New York one side would reach all the way down to Miami. And the other corner would go on down across the Gulf of Mexico. And this city is just as high as it is wide. God said that this city is foursquare.   This city is huge. We are given the outside dimensions of the city but we are not told how high the levels are. If each level was a mile in height, there would be 1,500 levels. If each level was a half of a mile high, there would be 3,000 levels. If each level was ? of a mile high, then there would be 6,000 levels. If the levels were 1/8 of a mile high, then there would be 12,000 levels. We simply do not know. Regardless of the number of levels, There will be plenty of room for all of the saved thru all of the ages. We will not be packed in like a bunch of sardines. There will be elbow room. Jesus is preparing us mansions and not condos.   Now stop and think about the height of it for a minute. Mount Everest is only about 5 miles high. This City is 1,495 miles higher than mount Everest.   We are also given the measurement of the height of the city walls.   Rev 21:17 And he measured the wall thereof, an hundred [and] forty [and] four cubits, [according to] the measure of a man, that is, of the angel.   The city is 1,500 miles high, but the city wall is only 144 cubits.   A cubit is about 18 inches. That works out to about 216 feet.   So the city wall is taller than a 20 story building.   And listen to these building materials for the city wall.   Rev 21:18 And the building of the wall of it was [of] jasper: and the city [was] pure gold, like unto clear glass.   Rev 21:19 And the foundations of the wall of the city [were] garnished with all manner of precious stones.   Just think of how much jasper and precious stones that is. Just to walk around this wall one time you would have to walk 6,000 miles. And this wall is about 20 stories high. If that is the beauty of the city wall, just wonder what the mansions must be like.|`|hZjPYyFTaa	Dante said it all in his trilogy and epic poem The Divine Comedy. In Inferno Dante mapped out Hell in one of the world's greatest epics. It cast the die for Hell ever since.|`|2k8TEiRtaa	What ? That little girl with reading all the books ? I don't get what punishment that could be. Unless that's all she had to read for eternity. There is nothing like that hell everybody believes in. Hell is the grave. You and me both will go to hell. Jesus descended into hell and on the third day he arose again from the DEAD. We will be dead. Until the ressurection of the DEAD. Opposite of life.

On a more serious not, its because we are so used to being discriminated and judged that we learn not to care what other people think about us, also, we are easier to talk to sometimes because it feels good to be accepted by someone, so we try and keep the accepting people in our lives, just to get away from all the suckish homophobes out there.|`|u04pBBq3aa	we just so totally rock dude that it plain lol|`|VERrlErvaa	Have you actually stopped to ask; Why are non-gay people so quick to judge?

I'm unsure why but gay and bi-sexual people aren't very afraid to be open when you get to know them, and they also have unique ways at looking at things. I'm personally bi-sexual and my best friend is gay: together, we create the randomest, weirdest jokes a person could ever come across.    As for the shy gay/bi people, I think that when you open 'em up you'll discover a prize inside. ^^ As in, they tell you their own inside-jokes and all these other interesting things.|`|baXQe4xLaa	my theory is that subconsciously we want people to accept us for being gay. and thinking about it now... it must be VERY subconscious because its true... a lot of gay folks are exactly what you say to be... however.. there are TONS of nasty individuals out there... but anyway... personal experience... bump into a guy or girl at a straight club = stares, attitude, and aggression. bump into a guy or girl at a gay club = apologies, smiles, and more dancing.|`|3ApWrFcNaa	im not gay or anything like that...but gay people are pretty cool.. (:  they are more relaxed and nicer than a straight person....i have no idea why though..|`|UiSEJGVnaa	Lol, gay men and women are way more comfortable with there surrounding and themselves. But usually because, well let me see. With most people, or a lot of people ...care what others think, and dress to impress, and are uptight because they want to look good for others, and not there self. From my eyes, gay people don't and that's why there so relaxed, they don't care what people thought otherwise they probably would prevent being gay, even though that's impossible. That don't care what others think, plus lets not forget they have a sense of us, or me. im a woman. and having a guy who's gay as a best friend, is like opposites thinking alike. Gay people know who they are, and they aren't ever ashamed.   help yeah?|`|6N9eV8IGaa	is that a socially accepted stereotype? yes....im sure all gay people just love hearing about straight peoples probs all the time esp the ones that look like arnold back in the day at my gym.|`|Idb89cCeaa	Thank you. The LGBT community is very open because we believe in ourselves since lots of folks don't give us much of a chance. So we give others a chance.|`|xuuaMTmtaa	Most of us have had to deal with discrimination, harassment, rude behavior, snarky remarks, etc..so most of us take it with a grain of salt and have learned to rise above it.  We also use it as a learning tool of how NOT to treat others.      And the smart thing?  Well...to be honest with you, studies have shown that homosexuals on average are one standard deviation above the mean over their heterosexual counterparts on intelligence testing. Transsexuals are two standard deviations above the mean.    The part about us being chilled and relaxed.  I think it comes from the fact that we are usually more open minded and accepting of things, because we live it everyday.      I agree with you though. I think GLBT rock.  We ARE generally friendlier, happier, less stressed out about stuff, kinder and more compassionate.

AA11428459	I'm offended by the word African American|`|lKn7nZfBaa	This is more than a racial question. You have not factored socioeconomic issues into the equation.     Just as one could say a certain percentage is uneducated, from a broken family, children of abusive or neglectful parents,no parents, etc.    I am not  as offended as I am saddened.    What do you plan on doing to improve the situation ?    Just wondering.......|`|lz6vAjSEaa	because theyre more likely to be in the lower income brackets, which are more likely to commit crime|`|EXurNsB4aa	Because they're more likely to be less educated, which is because they are more likely to be poorer.  Poorer neighborhoods have underfunded schools and higher dropout rates.    I'm not offended by your question but I'm offended by the general inability of others to connect crime to poverty instead of crime to race.|`|GSOLv83Waa	A really messed up justice system.. If you think otherwise, you should think again.|`|WV36m31Zaa	44%  have got themselves caught due to crimes they committed...

Also move it off the road.    Came across a fawn in the road that had been hit, and its mama and sibling were sniffing the body.  Scared them away then moved the corpse off the road to prevent additional deaths/damage.|`|XF3aVadlaa	WHY WOULD YOU KILL SOMETHING THEN SHOW MERCY, THAT IS NUTTY AND RIDICULOUS..........I WOULD NEITHER KILL IT OR LET IT SUFFER, B/C IM A VERY GOOD DRIVER , BUT IF IT HAPPENS I WOULD SHOW MERCY|`|TnquzeM5aa	How would I kill it since I don't carry my guns in my truck? Hit it again?|`|AA10811674	Of course kill it. I would call the police let them know, and they would shoot it.|`|434cdba191b138eb36e563b9ef737a76aa	Kill it.|`|xsZfN0JHaa	Kill it and  show mercy. After that clean it out and take home the meat for the family.|`|fEkKuGlEaa	I'd call my neighbor to come shoot it and take it it to the deer processor so the food could be saved.     When you live in the country that stuff happens a lot.|`|AA12059478	The Buddhist in me would be heartbroken.  But the Cherokee in me would have tossed it into the back of the truck, taken it to the elders, had it blessed, skinned cleaned and neatly put into little deer packages.  Deer sausage. Yum.|`|HWoLbR7Aaa	Kill it, take it home, and eat it.|`|Z5TuccoIaa	I'd call animal protection and see if they could help it if they could not I'd pay to have it put out of its misery.|`|1ioSvnb3aa	call the cops  if it was in alot of pain i'd kill it|`|U36GI9FUaa	You don't do any of that you grab a phone and call 911.

However if the neck is broken it's doomed.|`|rFFYCmOGaa	Finish it off and take it to my buddy who knows how to butcher it, distribute the meat amongst ourselves and plan on having some good deer plates during the next couple of weeks..|`|7mhRDbvsaa	call a paramedic|`|JpgLxU1Laa	omfg. put that poor thing out of its misery|`|OUbNSXjJaa	I am sure such things will not happen in my case.|`|UyDkYaXuaa	Kill it immediately. I don't think it would be able to live a proper life without a good neck.|`|ZjrFsYz5aa	kill it and eat it  free food|`|bwKZ8MWWaa	mm mm Eatin time|`|RSrnKPIkaa	probably kill it because it will die and i think its bad in my religion to let it suffer or maybe life support|`|pjgQAXM7aa	I wouldn't put him on life support, because to be honest with you there is NO absolute way that I'm going to take care of the poor deer. I know that it was my fault I hit the deer with a car, but really it'll die anyway once it's out in the wild. I wouldn't kill it myself, but HONESTLY, I would leave the deer there and pray a million times to God and the deer that I am sorry and I wish the deer to go to heaven.|`|xHcQSLiVaa	Kill it and show mercy.  That hurts to think about.|`|0dbDQh8Haa	if at all possible i would try to save it, but if i couldn't i would kill it so it wouldn't have to suffer.|`|ELzYeHUsaa	Good question I have no idea...  Ughhhmmmm By any chance did you run across this question because you hit a deer and broke it's neck???? LOL.|`|28216207e17752f6c782dd9a28e07f1faa	Put it out of its misery, of course.|`|HYh5NrV4aa	If I had a way of killing it quickly (i.e., a gun), I would do so. That isn't likely to happen though (for me to have a gun, I mean)... so I would probably just try to notify the proper authorities...|`|AA11430900	Kill it.  It would be inhumane to let it sit there and suffer.|`|2CBxqNcaaa	venison makes good jerky.|`|i6Mi8uWIaa	Probably kill it and show mercy, though it would break my heart to do so.     Then, of course, I'd have to report it. I think in my state you have to report all accidents involving animals, such as deer, to the nearest state game officer, or, if none are nearby, to the nearest highway patrol officer.|`|mFy3M8mVaa	I would kill the poor creature immediately. And since I am the big cat (lions, jaguars, tigers, etc.) keeper at an animal sanctuary, I would bring the body to work and feed it to the cats. Deer meat is excellent for them. That way at least something good would come out of such an unfortunate accident.|`|D4LnRg2Daa	A|`|VB3ZK5f9aa	Kill it.  Instant decision.|`|23c0c10dbc7c5d1840f5c4de91f1c424aa	If it were suffering, I would finish the job. I believe that it is the responsible and merciful thing to do.|`|nVfN8usNaa	I'd try not to hit the deer in the first place XD  Ehm, life support...? lol|`|RAsZw6CXaa	i'll call the cops & tell them to put it to sleep peacefully.|`|AA11961672	If it's neck was broken wouldn't it be dead or dying already?|`|Cm4EQ8GRaa	I wouldn't think about it as letting it suffer, but i would probably drive off...|`|UaC1fQd5aa	Kill it gut it and put it in my trunk on the way to my freezer!|`|AA11709855	I'd run it over again...|`|Pd1QSnzUaa	The only reasonable thing to do is to mercy kill it and then enjoy deer jerky or let someone else do so.  I doubt if any vet would ever put a deer on life support, and letting it die is pitiful.|`|OkOpH3Q6aa	first off i wouldnt hit the deer     BIG THUMBS UP FOR NOT KILLING A DEER..... YEAH!!!!|`|82fdac47003fd405ff244c6f7af240d1aa	If I hit a deer with a car and its neck was broken I SERIOUSLY doubt it would be alive at all. Furthermore, I don't carry firearms in my car so it would have to bleed out as I would not run it over a second time.|`|1a10b4584a07d2861c8d2a8b0698898aaa	Happened to my father, sort of.  He came upon an accident where a deer had been hit.  The thing was unable to move much and suffering.  He took out his knife and put it out of its misery.|`|qVuYGiF2aa	Put it on life support and see if a vet can do anything.

j7EwfvUsaa	i see ghost all the time but it is when you can not see them that is the scariest!    when i first moved into my new apartment i stared having strange feelings like i was being watched. one night i was laying in bed and all the hair on my body stood on end, some thong in me told me that some one or thing was standing behind me, i knew if i turned around and saw something i would never sleep in that house again so i closed my eyes and prayed for sleep. i used to have a touch lamp in my bedroom, one night it started turning on and off by it's self, i chalked it up to wiring problems so i unplugged it, then i heard a large crash from my daughters room when i went to check her dresser had been up ended, she is two, there is no way she could have moved the heavy wood thing. i took her back to my room and plugged the light back in for a few min it was fine as soon as i had my daughter calmed back down the light started turning on and off again. than in a very distanced voice my little girl pointed to the light and said...look at the little boy mommy! i have done some research and found that a young boy died in my apartment complex in the late 70's and that i am not the only person to have experienced the haunting from this child.   The scariest experience I have had was when I was sixteen a friend and I were working on my aunts apple orchard,  we were cleaning out her old barn to store new product in when we found a spirit board.   We were almost done so we decide to take a brake and play around. Mind you it was the middle of the day and we were alone because every one else was on picking duty on the other side of the 20 archer orchard.   We set it up on an old blanket and at first we were playing around  spelling each others names and such, witch is why I thought my friend was the one who spelled out the word apple on the board.  But when an apple came flying at me from behind and hit me on the back of my head we went running across the orchard screaming for help!  We never did finish cleaning the barn!  I see them all the time but have never tried to talk with one thought my fried believes that this might be possible for me, however I accidentally walked through one once and I felt the sudden feeling of complete depression and desperation.   My wiccan friend said I was feeling what he felt at the time of his death.  my mother saw a ghost onec durring a near death experinace...yet she still does not belive that i see them!  My mother had this child hood friend,  his name was peat.  they grew up together, were in each other's weddings,  his daughter was my best friend.  when i was two he got into a really bad motorcycle accident.  he was rushed to the best hospital around where he held on for two weeks.  unfortunately "uncle peat" did not make it.  a few years later my mother, having not learned her lesson about motorcycles, was in a bad accident her self.  four of her ribs was broken.  one was broken so bad it moved and went through the head of the baby she was carrying and killed him.  she was rushed to the same hospital where she lay dieing.  she said she looked up and peat was standing at the foot of her bed.  she though she must be  dead to.  she managed to choke out "am i going to die?"  she told me he shook his head no and disappeared.  now she was on a lot of pain medication, so they told he she was hallucinating.  but she maintains to this day that Peat was there to tell her it was not her time to go.|`|8k6kxOh2aa	well, i'll tell you let see here....3 of my experiences.    i was coming out of a room next to my bedroom one night when i turned around and saw a being with what looked like an extremely deformed face. (i actually believe this one was a demon though after studying it.)    i axcidentaly sat on a mischevious spirit (aka a poltergeist) one day, and it messed with my energy and i felt like a something passed through me quickly. it disoriented me for a while. this spirit likes to mess around every now and then, waking my friends from their sleep when they stay the night and knocking things down every now and then.    i was also coming down the stairs one day, and i saw a pretty clear picture of a lady. she appeared all white, but you could still see her details and stuff. i haven't seen her since then, but she has since started staying in my bedroom and i can sense her. she rarely moves from one spot, but if there's something negative, she'll follow me or she'll move to stand by the window as if she were looking for someone.    i have had more experiences. this is just 3of them.    ~stardriven09|`|3uiIrxojaa	I've known plenty of real life ghost stories.. but i've never seen one or would like to!|`|AA10623639	No but I have experienced a ghost encounter.  My uncle took me to this cemetery in Northern Los Angeles he claimed that the cemetery was haunted, but I didn't beleive him.  He told me this story of a school bus back in the 40's or 50's.  This bus was filled with children and it was going on a field trip but a train ran the bus over and everyone inside died.    But the spirits stayed in that cemetery (note: that during the time of the accident that this wasn't a cemetery and was a busy highway) and the spirits dedicated themselves to saving drivers from crashing into trains.  But the only thing was that the train track was no longer in service but the spirits stayed anyway.  He claimed that if you stop in that area of the accident, the spirits would push you up the hill.  And that exact thing happened he put his truck in neutral and we enjoyed the ride.    At first I thought someone was pushing the truck and he was just fooling me but I proved myself wrong by standing in the back of the truck looking for anyone.  And this is going up hill!    If you put baking powder on the back of your car while they pushed your car up hill they leave hand prints all over the car, it's pretty sweet

They've been dating for almost a year, have met the families, and spend the night in bed with each other-- just no sex of any kind.   But really, the age and race differences don't really stop anyone, for some they can make it more exciting.|`|YdwHmohPaa	is he a HOMOSEXUAL!!!|`|5Fm45guAaa	nope not at all they might be doing it in your bed|`|wvJxtmJTaa	your dad is dating the younger guy because odds are whatever reason plus his energy and that doesnt have a factor that ur dad is black and his boyfriend is white or age difference really.|`|DMfNi6Pwaa	Boyfriend = sexual relationship. whats age got to do with anything, or race for that matter.|`|baXQe4xLaa	does it matter? i mean, they are boyfriends... so the chances are most positively there.|`|fCdB7mDRaa	Nope, many white guys prefer black men because they have big *****.

01NUrwfYaa	well you could write about how a healthy diet is absolutely vital for a good health and longer life. Its absolutely necessary that all people know what there eating ... etcetera    just re-word all the paragragh and go from there.. use the same stuff that it says on there and say its good.    before a word that starts with a vowel you have to use an "n" 
9X4MS2uxaa	boku wa totemo guai ga warui desu.    "very" means totemo. But "very sick" can't be translated as "totemo byouki" because byouki is not an adjective but a noun in Japanese. So you should say "guai ga warui" for sick. guai means "health". warui means "bad". Then totemo can modify warui which is an adjective.    And this is my suggestion. When you convert a romaji into a kana letter, you have to be more careful. Because sometimes romaji especially long vowel is written being based on a pronunciation. For example Tokyo is written as toukyou if it is based on kana.  If these are based on kana,  domo must be doumo.  (do, u, mo)  byoki must be byouki.  (byo, u, ki)|`|6b732103367783f78c674ad4ce821550aa	yeah it's correct.    but remember don't pronounce  with too much emphasis with "u"  essentially it sounds more like "des" than "desu"|`|Xsen794Aaa	Put "totemo" (very) instead of "domo."  You don't really need the "boku wa" because it's obvious from the context who's sick; it's not wrong to have it either.  Other than that, it's fine.
c816Ebkvaa	The preps at my school label themselves as preppy. They definitely think they're cool too, because they walk around the school like they own the freaking place.    And yet, they hate it when someone outside of their clique calls them a prep, and they'll always argue with the person and say they're not. It's pretty stupid, really.|`|txI8rKYdaa	Oh yes. But just remember everybody is just as important as everybody. It doesn't matter what kind of clothes you wear or how good you are at sports. And trust me, sports is NOT everything. Also, remember it doesn't matter how "Hot" preps are, you are beautiful too, and it matters what's on the inside. And yeah they all say what you think.|`|E98jJXzKaa	yes, they think that they are SO cool! I am so glad that i do not have to deal with the high school preps anymore now that i am in college. What a relief!|`|H0LfFGmlaa	Listen man I am called that all the time and I think people are just jealous because I have expensive clothes and don't run around like a mule. I mean yeah I'm on the football team and the basketball team and have a huge ego but shouldn't I? Aren't I better than you because of my clothes and the sports I play? I think I am at least.|`|xcF30urOaa	They think and belive they are popular & they label themselves as preppy which is stupid but they don't care because they think it makes them more popular and people will like them more.They get mad when other people call them preps .    By the way at my school preps aren't the popular ones :)    They think that they are better than everyone else , and they all shop at hollister and American Eagle and that's the only place they shop . It's super anoying they all dress and look the same and have anoying voices & guys preps are just ew . Im sorry but when I see a guy that dresses in hollister I think "Gay" or pretty boy . Thier is nothing wrong with being gay I have many gay friends tho haha    Also I wear nice "expensive" clothes but they don't nescarly come from hollister . I do shop at the mall but Ill shop anywhere .I do like areopostale though :)|`|IDVFsy5waa	they know that they are popular but I dont think they label themselves though..|`|BJ4Q6QoQaa	Sadly, i would have to say yes. And Sadly, i have to say that most of them think they're better than everyone else. When they're not, they are just like everyone else in the world. We're all people.|`|xogws8vMaa	Yes|`|b0cf194d51a7889f74b6caa215c4087daa	yes i am aware|`|mKDSnQO5aa	we do. we know what we are. but me as well as my friends are all insecure about things. more than non popular people i think|`|YFgREceaaa	i dress preppy but only cause thats the uniform at the school i got to..  preps are really losers..|`|CsieMFy0aa	Most likely they do know they are popular. They just think they're cool and stuff.|`|j49IqTdiaa	yes they label themselves preps but get upset when you call them preps|`|0dbDQh8Haa	no. i've talked to some people who are in the "prep" group and when i say the word popular they deny it and say there are no populars in our school.|`|bM71Fp1raa	Oh yes; they believe in what they think they are.|`|PhdK3S6uaa	if they call themselves popular, they are probably real fags. IM POPULAR (real squeaky voice like in gay movies).
1y1c5QWHaa	Because some people have triskaidekaphobia: the fear of the number thirteen. Here's how the number thirteen became superstitious (quoted from Wikipedia):     Some Christian traditions have it that at the Last Supper, Judas, the disciple who betrayed Jesus, was the 13th to sit at the table, and that for this reason 13 is considered to carry a curse of sorts. However, the number 13 is not uniformly bad in the Judeo-Christian tradition. For example, the 13 attributes of God (also called the thirteen attributes of mercy) are enumerated in the Torah (Exodus 34: 6-7). Some modern Christian churches also use 13 attributes of God in sermons.    Triskaidekaphobia may have also affected the Vikingsit is believed that Loki in the Norse pantheon was the 13th god. More specifically, Loki was believed to have engineered the murder of Baldr, and was the 13th guest to arrive at the funeral. This is perhaps related to the superstition that if thirteen people gather, one of them will die in the following year. This was later Christianized in some traditions into saying that Satan was the 13th angel. Another Norse tradition involves the myth of Norna-Gest: when the uninvited norns showed up at his birthday celebrationthus increasing the number of guests from ten to thirteen-the norns cursed the infant by magically binding his lifespan to that of a mystic candle they presented to him.    The Mesopotamian Code of Hammurabi (ca. 1760 BC) omits 13 in its numbered list. This seems to indicate a superstition existed long before the Christian era. Ancient Persians believed the twelve constellations in the Zodiac controlled the months of the year, and each ruled the earth for a thousand years at the end of which the sky and earth collapsed in chaos. Therefore, the thirteenth is identified with chaos and the reason Persian leave their houses to avoid bad luck on the thirteenth day of the Persian Calendar (a tradition called Sizdah Bedar).       Thirteen is my favorite number, though, but only because it's superstitious. Coincidentally, I own a black cat, but he has brown streaks in his fur. :)    -??T? ???? ???T? ???!!!|`|bXl12I4Baa	Many claim that the 13th floor is a bad luck. Many people believe the number 13 is a bad luck is big story behind it ,but I do not know|`|f9sL3WgQaa	Its just an old myth and most tower buildings or hotels do not even have a 13 floor (in numbers anyways). They will skip it!|`|agh18eT2aa	It's not.  Only if you are superstitious and backwards.|`|QbFXIwkAaa	13th floor is not a bad luck.Let's say you are at the Hotel, 13th floor has the same rooms,models with 12th,11th,14th floor.  It is only a fiction from people.|`|RqDgxhTHaa	i used to live in 13th floor. i think it's just made up cause it's really high(it is) and people wanted to prevent stuff. i turned out to be okay, i turned out to be lucky after it. ha ha that's just a joke but seriously, it's nothing.|`|0jmVA50Jaa	Only in the eyes of the beholder.     The 13th Floor always brought me good things .|`|sLmX4H3Caa	It's a phobia, I can't remember the exact name though. It's the fear of the number 13. So anything with 13 in it is said to be unlucky because of the 13phobia.|`|I6CrOcu6aa	cause like friday the 13th. idk supersticious stuff|`|3DJVIsjiaa	Dunno..some people associate the number 13 as a bad omen.for example friday the 13th..but if youre not superstitious then its no big deal.its whatever you believe in|`|ZvAiuW2Kaa	its a myth.|`|rSqSxIyOaa	Comes from the number 13.  The King of France and the Pope had the Crusaders whipped out on Friday the 13th and from that day on it became thought of as a bad luck day.|`|uPNP1xzpaa	it is just a superstition. It is like number 4 means death in Chinese customs.|`|XMzicF0Xaa	it's not|`|DvgBKS5Caa	because 13 is considered a unlucky number to the chinese and arabic. like friday the 13th!|`|UTak66q0aa	A lot of people are superstitious and so they refuse to stay on the 13th floor. Thus, hotels decided to "eliminate" the 13th floor--they change it to the 14th floor.     Even though it might have originally started with the idea that the number 13 causes bad luck.  The real reason many building omit the 13th floor is because they make a profit doing so.   When you rent or buy property in a tall building, prices go up as you move up. so a 14th floor will sell for more than a 13th floor.   If a building is really tall. lets say 50 stories. the difference in price for a 49th floor vs a 50th floor is enough to make any developer want to remove the 13th floor.
nooocNV1aa	You are clearly very stereotyped if you immediately assume that the LGBT community would know more about Madonna than the other sections.

9hib6oJLaa	"A mark of punctuation ( ; ) used to connect independent clauses and indicating a closer relationship between the clauses than a period does."    "I'm not sure why we are such great friends; we're total opposites."    Since both can be sentences on their their own, it can be separated by a semi colon. And it's 'We're' [we are], not were.    I would spell things out as "two", because just typing the number looks very sloppy.    "Whom" is the objective "who".   "Who gets whom?" "Whom called you?"|`|NfSLXHU3aa	If you have 2 separate sentences, but they're of a similar thought, you can connect them with a semicolon.    Spell out numbers if they are the first word of the sentence.  All numbers ten and under should be spelled out (except as a house number, zip or phone number).|`|8usxEMNeaa	If by were you meant "we're" then yes, you do need one. The most common use of a semicolon is to separate two independent clauses without the need of a coordinating conjunction (such as "and, but, or"). The other uses are really not recommended because the sentences become awkwardly constructed then.    Oh and spell out numbers when they're short. one, ten, thirteen, twenty-one, a hundred, a thousand, a million, etc. 135, 1234, 3,456 etc. would probably be left as numbers.

I think it means something like this:    The lives we "plan" for ourselves are mapped out early on in our heads, or - worse yet - in the heads of others. But life is not a plan. Life is often a series of surprises that ambush us and move us in other directions.    When life moves you in a different direction than what you had planned, don't fight it. Go with the flow of your life and find your bliss.

ccccc3a7fff67561896e1cd6e04c515faa	The Romans and Italians weren't too big on abstract symbols, and those that were known were usually for military standards or fertility charms -- not much for motherhood or love specifically. That the Romans tended to be rather misogynist (though not as bad as the Greeks) further degrades the liklihood of finding sacred symbols of daughters and mothers -- no one cared about daughters and mothers and non-erotic love.    Sometimes goddesses had sacred items that would be used as symbols of a sort. Juno's were cows, lilies, geese, pomegranates and peacocks, though they are often fertility symbols instead of family symbols.|`|RoHjjzXWaa	Sorry, but I've never heard of "symbols" for motherhood or anything similar in the Roman civilization.

GBjMqElBaa	1 John 1:8-10 (New International Version)     8If we claim to be without sin, we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us. 9If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness. 10If we claim we have not sinned, we make him out to be a liar and his word has no place in our lives.    Jude 1:24-25 (New International Version)    Doxology    24To him who is able to keep you from falling and to present you before his glorious presence without fault and with great joy 25to the only God our Savior be glory, majesty, power and authority, through Jesus Christ our Lord, before all ages, now and forevermore! Amen.    Saint Paul had the same problem. Yes, even him. Look:    Romans 7:18-20 (New International Version)  18I know that nothing good lives in me, that is, in my sinful nature.[a] For I have the desire to do what is good, but I cannot carry it out. 19For what I do is not the good I want to do; no, the evil I do not want to dothis I keep on doing. 20Now if I do what I do not want to do, it is no longer I who do it, but it is sin living in me that does it.    Take a look at Romans chapter 8 and study it fully! It is one of my favorite chapters.  Feel free to Email me if you would like!|`|Lc5FtItDaa	FIrst, we aren't saved by what we do.  We are saved by accepting Jesus' willingness to save us.  We do the right thing because we are close to God and want to please him.  Like you want to please your mother when she asks you not to wear boots in the house.    Second, there is nothing that can separate you from the love of God.    I am praying for you.|`|9mLjDa5kaa	If you believe in Jesus alone to save you, then you will NEVER be sent to hell    Salvation is a FREE GIFT that happens in a split second when you believe in Jesus! It is impossible to lose or "leave" salvation.     The truth about Jesus is that the only way to be saved and to get into heaven and avoid being sent to eternal hell, is by believing in faith alone that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for all our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Believe this and you will be in heaven, no matter what!     Please pray now: "Jesus, please forgive me of my sins. I believe that You died on the cross for my sins and You rose from the dead. Thank You for eternal life!" You will be in heaven with Him forever when you die. :)|`|FOZGMadaaa	Faith comes by hearing the word of God. So we read the word of God .    Prayers is developing a relationship with God.So we pray and worship him.    God is love,so we fellowship with other believers.    Jesus frees us from sin.So we seek God daily in prayer and worship.Asking God for wisdom and understanding in the name of Jesus.    It is all about our attitude towards God. Do you have time to show your gratitude?|`|gmaCvh00aa	Your fears are exactly the reason I jettisoned Christianity.  The whole set-up thrives on the fear of death and hell and feeling guilty even if you didn't do anything wrong.    I believe it started out as a positive religion but now it is very negative and frightening.  You certainly don't feel loved being a Christian, but you are supposed to say you believe Jesus loves you.    It's sick and scary and fodder for psychiatrists.|`|f10424ac1ac7b1791b4f665094823d61aa	I pray for your peace of mind.|`|if8pS6cGaa	Whisper this prayer to God so that only you can hear yourself and say:    Lord Jesus I ask you to forgive me now of all my sins and come into my heart as I now repent of all my sins and be my own personal Lord and savior and save me now from all sin and hell, write my name in the lambs book of life so that on judgment day I will be allowed to enter heaven for accepting Jesuss sacrifice of dying on the cross for me and I will not be cast into hell which  was not prepared for me but was prepared for the devil and his angels, I thank you now Lord Jesus that I am now saved and on my way to heaven because you are now in my heart as you have promised if I ask you to come in as you are not liar but are a God of your word,  now teach me all your correct ways and truths in which you would have me walk and make all my ways well pleasing in Your sight even as a sweet fragrance to thy nostrils and a sweet sound to thine ears In Jesus Holy Name, Amen.|`|jrwaSSYGaa	love god and love your neighbor.

It's Satan's lies that is telling that you are going to hell... He is the accuser... Just remember the story of the woman to be stoned... Jesus never condemned her, but rather forgive her and tell her to sin no more...That's how it works... justification then sanctification.    Maybe the question that you want to ask is, how can I get out of this sins... Actually you can, with the help of God, you can have a breakthrough in your life and be the person that God want you to be.    Please visit this site or search for this ... www.settingcaptivesfree.com.  or search for it.. It's a highly recommended websites for Christians who suffers from any type of addiction-pornography,alcoholism,drugs,h...    And read the boook... Bondage breaker by Neil Anderson... a very powerful book.    Godbless, I believe that you will be free from those sins. In Jesus name.|`|EjkW5NHRaa	Fear not brother I will explain to you the gospel.    THE FACT OF SIN:     Romans 3:10  As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:    Romans 3:23  For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;    Now who know that you are a sinner.    THE REMEDY:    Ephesians 6:17  Take the helmet of salvation    The helmet of salvation points to God's ultimate victory over the forces of evil. Jesus' death on the cross and his Resurrection from the dead provides all believers with Freedom from the bondage of sin, and with Eternal life with God in heaven.    To put on the helmet of salvation is to-    have assurance that Jesus has saved you, not because of good deeds, but because of his mercy. 2 Timothy 1:9    Know that every believer is a ''new creation,'' no longer living for selfish purposes but living for the Lord. 2 corinthians 5:17    Accept that you are in a battle and will be persecuted for believing in Christ. Keep the faith and you will be blessed. Mathew 5:11-12    Look forward to being delivered into Eternal life. John 3:16    Know that God will forgive his followers when they fall and ask for forgiveness. 1 John 1:9    Euangelio (that we call 'gospel') is a greek word, and it signifies good, merry, glad and joyful tidings, that makes a man's heart glad, and make him sing, dance and leap for joy.    Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ

Its like a stage towards coming out.     1) Self recognition.  2) Come out as BISEXUAL  3) Gay or Lesbian.    // she is in the 2nd stage, where she is coming out as lesbian. Believe it or not, thats true ! You can be Asexual, but as you described above, she tends to lean more on just being lesbian. Her kind of love towards you, is a different kind of love. I hope this helps =X GOODLUCK ^^
qQWYeOpgaa	Get him really good smelling cologne so you have an excuse to be close to him and smell him,  I did that for my boyfriend.|`|Nl64RmRWaa	You could get him a dog tag necklace, a silver chain, or a bracelet. Maybe even a ring. Getting something engraved on it would make it even more special.     Do the 365 reasons why I love you and make it into a scrapbook. That is very romantic and shows how much you love him.    Since it's only going to be February, you could go to Walmart and take 12 pictures to make a calendar for him. Then he can have your picture hanging in his room. Or you could simply get him a picture frame with a picture of you both together in it.    Also, check this website out, it has some cute ideas!   http://www.personalizationmall.com/Whims...    If you're sexual you could light the room with candles, have rose petals on the bed, and have some sexy lingerie on for him.

One side red (Hell side) and one side White (Heaven side) and she had each guest dressed in white or red only.    I bet you can get lots of ideas off of that show.      I knew someone who had a party and had it all themed like the movies.  The invitations were giant ticket stubs and the gift bags were popcorn bags full of candy and stuff. She had a red carpet event in front. It was pretty cool.|`|5nvgGbcmaa	you could do a decades themed party (like 70s, 80s, 90s... you get the idea)     if you have a favorite movie/ book/ video game or something you could do that (i.e. batman, harry potter, twilight... pokemon! haha ; ) )     you could have a food themed party like ice cream or mexican or chinese or just a huge superbowl-like bomb of pizza and fried chicken (YUM)     you could do something really formal like have a semi formal at a hall or something      depending on when your b.day is, you could have a beach party or even an indoor pool party     well have fun : )... wow i really gotta start planning my sweet sixteen...

God is not proved by a man but it is through faith that a person receives revelation from God.

And at the end, we prayed and I prayed (my exact words) "I pray the fire will burn like crazy" and so we went to our friend's house to eat, and hang out, and before we left back home (another city/town), we went and saw the fire. And it had been 8hrs, and the fire was still burning, like crazy.    And then, also, on Christmas day, it had been snowing in Corpus Christi, TX, so we were amazed, but we lived in Seadrift (small town, same as the last story) and so we were driving back to Seadrift and there was a bridge, and a deisel was on the other lane and so we were just driving, and my little brother wasn't in his seatbelt, and he was laying there sleeping, and so then we drove, across a piece of ice, and we started spinning (my mom had been on cruise control, which made it spin) and we were just holding on and screaming while the car spun around like an out of control roller coaster. And then when it stopped spinning, we got out and checked all around the car and there wasn't a dent or a scratch or ANYTHING. We could've easily fell over the bridge. And then the diesel driver just sat there in astonishment, so my mom went and told him all of us were okay, and then when my mom got back my little brother woke up and asked what happened. And we took it off cruise control and drove home w/our Christmas miracle.    There's a ton more and I can e-mail them to you, but that's my personal proof.

Belief is born of hope and that hope is rational as long as the object of our hope is possible.  As far as I know, even most atheists agree that the existence of our Creator is possible.    We all seek that which we hope to find.  Christians hope to find their Creator and the atheists hope to find independence from any authority who would tell them how to live their lives.  In the end, I think God grants us our desires.|`|N4A3pKStaa	There really is no rational proof of gods existence, and it is irrational to believe in god.

I don't take any bible or revealed religion seriously though.|`|ATPPWOpWaa	Heres some fun facts from that 2500 year old Bible.  There are many prophesies in the Bible concerning the end times.   One needs to consider that it is written that these prophesies will occur within a relatively short common era of time thus compounding their validity.  Additionally, things are prophesied that ancient peoples wouldn't even have thought of or would have any way of knowing.  Below is short list of the end times prophesies;    * That mankind would greatly increase in knowledge in the last days.    * That mankind would travel to and fro far more in the last days.    * That the Jews would re-establish their homeland in the last days(Israel reformed in 1948).    * That man kinds 'chariots' would rush to and fro along the broad ways and be self illuminated and travel like lightning.    * That there would be increased natural disasters in diverse places.    * That there would be famines.    * That the Jews would again speak a common language (the Jews now speak the long dead Hebrew language).    * That Christianity would be spread to the ends of the earth.    * That there will be great distress at the end, unequaled from the beginning of the world until nowand never to be equaled again.    * The existence of a 200 million man army(China attained this capability in the 1960s).    * The Jews rebuilding of the Temple of God.  The specific piece of ground needed is called "The Dome of the Rock" and is currently held by the Muslims.    * A red Heifer (cow) must be used in the purification in the end times.  The first red Heifer born in 2,000 years was born on 1997 and another in 2004 in Israel.    * The return of the Ethiopian Jews to Israel was prophesied in Zephaniah 3:10.   Between 1984 and 1999 some 38,000 and the last of the Ethiopian Jews were airlifted to Israel.    *  That all nations of the world would have instant and live communication as they will see certain events in real time the world over.    * That the nature of people will change for the worse.  They will be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents,      unthankful,  unholy,  without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good, traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God.     Again, the important thing to note is that these things will all happen in a common era.   It is very easy to recognize the above events and their relatively recent connection to one another.  There are things prophesied that simply weren't knowable at the time that they were written.|`|7c0eb610d871f4900af356753fbd90b4aa	I believe in God because it makes sense to me due to my personal experiences so far    what makes you think I believe in the bible , or hell , or being baptised ?    this way of thinking makes me think you are one of those ...

Their "faith" gets them into heaven, and if you don't chose the right religion you spend an eternity in hell get poked with pitch forks and goat legs.  When Christians understand why they reject every other religion, they will learn why we think Christianity is bull $hit.   I think it's just security for weak minded people."Oh god loves me, God loves err'one." L0$3RS!|`|Di7JoX70aa	I'm with Selah!! I am praying for you. baptism has nothing to do with it.. You must be washed in the blood of Jesus and know him as your personal Saviour..Your a lost sinner and you need to be saved... I do not have proof that you can see but it's in my heart.. the Bible is real and God is just something you believe and trust in... it's like air you can't see it but you believe that it's there and because it's there you can breathe and live. God is the same You can't see him but you believe he is there and because of him you can live.... May God open your eyes to the truth.|`|n3CVPXrVaa	well im sooo sorry you feel that way. i will pray for you but tell me this...    1. How is there love?  Science can't explain it, but im sure you tell people alll the time that you loved them!!! If science can explain everything than there must be no such thing as love. GOD is love.     2. Where did the first human come from?  A science lab CANNOT produce a baby from scratch    So I'm gonna pray for the conversion of your soul that you may find GOD and be saved    HE LOVES YOU NO MATTER WHAT AND IT'S NOT TOO LATE TO TURN TO HIM
HuL6bKNMaa	I don't want to offend you or be rude, as this is my opinion: Well it sounds like your friend isn't hurting at all (no offense), and this happens a lot in society. There are plenty of people who get older and stop contact with their family. There could also be a lot problems you don't know about. Maybe your friend didn't get along with his parents, maybe he needs the separation to find himself as a person, maybe he is living his dream in CA and his father is just against it, who knows? How do you know he doesn't care about his family values? How do you know his parents don't have family values? It sounds to me like you're trying to interfere in some one else's life when you don't know or really need to know everything involved.|`|L4eEuaanaa	Ok, I really have no experience with this, or anything, but I'll try to give you my honest advice.      You could maybe try writing a letter to the boy, or showing him what he is becoming.  Maybe try to sneak good things into his life, and always show him kindness.  I'm not sure if you were looking for help with the dad too, but you could try to make (both of them) feel welcome in the world, and give them kindness and good things.    Ok, these aren't very good ideas, sorry!  But i hope this helps...|`|3yltQ2Euaa	If you are his friend, just spend time with him the best way that it is possible ! its all you can do, you cant go talk to the members of his family it does not seem right. Dont judge the non-going-to-church thing because some people live well like that- i do. Church is not very popular in Canada :P Anyways he needs you as a friend and confident, so just be there, this is already so much. To his stubborn attitude, it might be only to escape all this family drama going on- If he has a great time doing something else, maybe he'll forget about all this and act nicer : /    hope that helped|`|AA11232725	Pray for your friend and if he lives in the California Bay Area suggest that he check out Abundant Life Christian Fellowship where we always welcome people just like him http://www.alcf.net    If he wants to know what goes on there tell him he can listen to what the Pastor sounds like here http://oneplace.com/ministries/enduring_...

If you want to help, find someone (psychologist, etc.) who will talk to his father and try to diminish those suicidal thoughts. Aside from that, let him be. You won't be able to convince him of anything, and he's probably content with how he is, just like you are content with how you are. Would you want someone nagging you to change your ways just because the other person thinks that their way is better for you?    And... what's so wrong with him moving away now that he's 18?|`|MDzPFiUCaa	wat?|`|kFpFU97zaa	The father: Offer what solace you can. Be a shoulder or a hand when needed. Be a friend.    The son: People who want to change will do it themselves or will ask for help or guidance.     Finally: Trust me when I say you will drain yourself and hurt yourself trying to fix someone else's problems. The father you can offer what you can, but the son needs to get his crap together, himself.|`|eoqTXCGxaa	I wouldn't butt in. Just support him, and be there for him.

44fe68ac48e4256fe9ab6ffbd1ee8375aa	I would NOT recommend depilatories for your face at all. Try waxing, you can get a decent home waxing kit for around 15-20 dollars. You will have to grow out the hair first. If you have the money than I would suggest laser hair removal which is far more pricey but will rid you of facial hair for good. If you ever change your mind though, waxing will allow you to get back the hair if you want it.|`|LVe6MJfMaa	I wouldn't wax your face... waxing sensitive areas such as your face and pubic areas HURT LIKE HELL. You can try things like nair or veet, they're for girls but they would work on guys too. They remove hair from the root. It also makes your skin softer. Be sure to get ones that say "for sensitive skin/areas" or "for face"|`|pd2GnHnIaa	SHOOT YOURSELF IN THE FACE  (im kidding xD)  you could................wax?or just keep shaving|`|defde0b6e42848179471ab740c517f46aa	Try electrolysis or Laser hair removal.|`|DMfNi6Pwaa	oh yeah, wax it, thats a great idea, especially your nose hairs and mustache.

This can be expensive.  I suppose it depends on whether or not you can afford such a procedure.  I would totally avoid waxing... OUCH.
9BeUbORtaa	Usually, we use "at" for a specified location (like "at the library" or "at the school"), and "in" for countries and cities ("in India," or "in Paris"). There are some exceptions, often indicating a state or status (to be "in church" indicates that one is not merely "at the church" but actually partaking of a service; to be "in school" suggests that one is not only "at school," but that one is attending a lesson).  "In" is also used for specific rooms within a house - if the building is already specified, or if the speaker is already in the building being referred to, one can say that someone is "in the bathroom," or "in the sitting-room."

eb4e977a0cb9ce50b08bf74f0f3a0c61aa	There is absolutely no medical condition that makes you "want to drink blood" - if a person does think they "want to drink blood" that is a psychological issue, and not triggered by any physiological response. There is a unique delusion where the victim wants to drink blood, aptly named Renfield syndrome, after the character in Dracula, but it is not a physiological need.    If you drink blood, it does not transfer into your blood system - it goes to the stomach where it is broken down chemically, and the iron in it is destroyed by the hydrochloric acid in your stomach. Humans cannot ingest iron in an unprotected state - iron pills are coated in order to allow them to enter the small intestine in a ball of chyme (semi-digested food matter), and be digested there away from the stomach acids. Blood would be broken down to water and the molecules that make up the blood cells and platelets. There is thus no way ingested blood can do anything for you except to provide water. There are little inherent nutrients in blood - and most of what is there is from the person eating a good meal, which is digested and the nutrients enter the bloodstream through the walls of the small intestine - proteins, carbohydrates, and fats. Anyone who tells you they need to drink blood to survive or stay healthy is a delusional wannabee at best, or a lying psychotic at worst.    As for "psychic" vampires, there is absolutely no proof whatsoever of any way to "drain" energy from another human being. There is no evidence of chi, prana, blood energy, or any of that twiddle-twaddle. The body does generate a low-level electrical and electromagnetic field, but has no way to physically drain those fields from someone else. A person might claim they can do such , "feeding" off your emotions and so on and so forth, but it is a delusion.     Lastly, every single one of the self-professed "vampires" out there are 100% human, with average human physiology, no different than you, me, or Captain Kangaroo. If they go to the hospital for any reason needing bloodwork or DNA testing, they will be proven to be human, no anomalies, no glitches, no organs they don't need, etc. etc. etc. This need to be a "vampire" is a psychological delusion, and for anyone throwing a temper tantrum and screaming, "They do exist! They do exist!" - fine. Let's see some real proof, and not from these stupid vampire websites spewing their fictional trash. No, go to your doctor, have the aforementioned labwork done, and if he says, "Look, you're a vampire!" then scan those lab results along with his affadavit on stationery with his letterhead on it, and post them as a downloadable file so we can all see your proof. Will you do that for me?    I am a Nurse, with real medical education, training and knowledge.     I've had hate mail from these so-called "vampires", public attacks in the Y/A! forums, death threats, told to "shut up", told I don't know what I'm talking about, told I'll wake up "covered in blood", etc. etc. etc. ad nauseum. Every single one I've invited to come find me, and told them where and when. Guess they couldn't get out of remedial math class that morning. ROFLOL.|`|hwIMJBVpaa	i believe there are vampires, but not in a sense that you would think...the scary story vampire..actually i know there are real vampires, there are people that get pleasure from drinking blood. so i guess that is a vampire. there are actually recorded cases of real vampires.|`|uq1GXvSdaa	there are many supernatural things that exist Vampires are not one of them    Vampires are not real no matter how much you wanted to ber   There no such thing as Energy Vampires Either.    or how many book there are on the subject     of course if you are a teenager in love with twilight you wont hear reasons|`|517360c1a1db979fb2f19bbb959f22eaaa	They're pretend in books and movies only.|`|h1eBWehMaa	Vampires as depicted by all of the stories, legends, and movies are not real.

I never had an orgasm with the few men I was with, however my partner takes me to heights unimaginable.  Yet, even when I am with her (we seldom use toys-just lips, tongues and fingers) I still mostly have to imagine male penetration to achieve orgasm.  I am very difficult to reach that point, I have to concentrate alot and any distraction will throw me off.  It is a terrible chore sometimes, but after 28 years we know each others bodies pretty well.  So basically, what I am saying is...you can find a female partner to use toys with you and/or you can fantasize male penetration if you want to.  With the right partner, you can find the lesbian in you!  Just my thoughts!

sVClfrldaa	al is the contraction of a + el.  So, if you're saying "I'm going to the market," the market is masculine (el mercado), so you'd say, "Voy al mercado."    If you're going to the store (la tienda), you would use "a la": "Voy a la tienda."    Ir + a + infinitive is a formation used to describe something you're going to do in the near future.  I'm going to fall asleep soon:  Me voy a dormir muy pronto.

No.  He did mention to the apostles that they would perform miracles greater than his (which some did).  He also mentioned that someone with faith the size of a mustard seed could move a mountain.    Jim, http://www.bible-reviews. com|`|JTD3M8Ziaa	Jesus was also the most prolific liar in the entire bible...here are some more of his whoppers:      And Jesus answered and said to them, "Truly I say to you, if you have faith and do not doubt, you will not only do what was done to the fig tree, but even if you say to this mountain, `Be taken up and cast into the sea,' it will happen. "And all things you ask in prayer, believing, you will receive." (Matthew 21:21-22)    Amen, I say to you, whoever says to this mountain, 'Be lifted up and thrown into the sea,' and does not doubt in his heart but believes that what he says will happen, it shall be done for him. Therefore I tell you, all that you ask for in prayer, believe that you will receive it and it shall be yours. (Mark 11:24-25)    And whatever you ask in my name, I will do, so that the Father may be glorified in the Son. If you ask anything of me in my name, I will do it. (John 14:13-14)    If you remain in me and my words remain in you, ask for whatever you want and it will be done for you. (John 15:7)    It was not you who chose me, but I who chose you and appointed you to go and bear fruit that will remain, so that whatever you ask the Father in my name he may give you. (John 15:16)    On that day you will not question me about anything. Amen, amen, I say to you, whatever you ask the Father in my name he will give you. Until now you have not asked anything in my name; ask and you will receive, so that your joy may be complete. (John 16:23-24)      "And all things you ask in prayer, believing, you will receive."???  Tell that to the families who prayed incessantly for their for sick loved ones, just to have them suffer and die before their eyes.|`|AA11536715	Yeah - here are some that sort of talk about that:  Matthew 17:20  I tell you the truth, if you have faith as small as a mustard seed, you can say to this mountain, 'Move from here to there' and it will move. Nothing will be impossible for you.    James 5:15  And the prayer offered in faith will make the sick person well; the Lord will raise him up.    Mark 11:24  Therefore I tell you, whatever you ask for in prayer, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours.|`|SOza8NBqaa	no, Jesus did not say that.  He said that we are all evil and need to be saved from our sin and that He is the only remedy. (John 14:6).  When He saves us, He gives us His joy, His peace, and His love (John 14-16) in the midst of trials and tribulations.|`|UqhApIvHaa	no|`|Hjwp1yGWaa	He said greater miracles than the ones he has performed will be done in His name, and they were throughout the book of Acts, and it is an open invitation for all who will meet the challenge of following Jesus' righteousness, and his instruction through the Holy Spirit, but this call is for Disciples of Christ, not laypeople, one needs discipline in their daily life to be a Disciple, when is the last time you have fasted and prayed for 24 hours up to 40 days?  Not many have the spiritual discipline and understanding of the Bible, or an active prayer life that is profound enough to pursue the Miracles of the Apostles/Disciples of Christ's day.  You need to be willing to die in the flesh, and serve Christ completely before you take on the daunting task of Spiritual Warfare with the Adversary(Satan), which is what the power you speak of is for, to convince the unbelievers, and dismantle the strongholds of the enemy.  I am currently discipling under another man at least once a week, and less than 4 days ago 22 people came to Christ 10 Spanish Speaking, and 12 English Speaking, do you consider that a miracle? considering I don't speak Spanish fluently, although there was one person there who said I did it perfectly, go figure.  Dedicate yourself, or even better resign yourself to His will, and see for yourself.|`|dz5Og81Qaa	Yes He did and when we purify our personalities and expand consciousness we do have that power. The phrase He said was, "...All this and more ye shall do."

ZJ2k7Ynqaa	When, and if, one humbly realizes his need for the Lord, he will choose that path.    Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.  Matthew 5:3|`|E9chZY74aa	No one is self-sufficient.  No one can be a market by themselves or be born without a mother or many things.  We also know that we are not alone and are too finite to know what is truth or not.  We are simply too small of mind and body.  But, God freely give truth in the Bible.    Because we will spend an eternity somewhere else, we should school ourselves more on what God desires than to be a lawyer or doctor or anything.|`|SoY4IiYBaa	what's god like?  Is he more of a Hip-hop fan or a Rock fan?|`|426a3dee7ed8c56e74b81f48767f2bbaaa	When trying to live it everyday.|`|xsZfN0JHaa	I believe that the path is already chosen before we realize we have to choose a path when life is too much. It is just destiny that we are following after that point. The path has been already laid. Whichever path we had chosen is the path to follow to live life with. In essence, whatever religion you choose is the religion you follow.|`|ba0d5ff814e4de743ed883cab2a57206aa	It is different for everyone.  Sometimes God lets you go on your merry way and you live happily.  Sometimes God wants you to know that you are not doing what He wants you to be doing and lets you know by maybe making you or a loved one sick, hurt, or you lose your job etc.  Then you must depend on someone else instead of just yourself. If you are smart, you will start to pray and ask God for help.  If God answers your prayers and you are appreciative, you start to wonder about God and want to find out more. You read the bible and pray for the knowledge you want about God and find out that your life is more peaceful and there is joy in what you do.  If you just wanted God to fix your problem and then go on your merry way again. You do and God waits for you to return. Sometimes you do and sometimes you do not.  The more times God invites you back and you refuse the harder your heart becomes until you cannot go to God.

Humanizinga  celebrity is a story, and with a photo or two it can be worth thousands (not quite millions of dollars).      Since people pick up the magazine in the supermarket they tend to buy it.  Good business, bad for the mind.

bOhCDVK2aa	It helps. Because, you just said: "When a person SEEKS HELP" which just means that they're willing to stop, and wants to be helped. If a person is good at persuading and trying to help the person who smokes, then more likely that they will be helped to stop.
TMb076n6aa	Yes I believe it. Some people are not always the best choice and they leave your life or you have to cut them loose because they drag you down.

Mental health can be depression(and until control it is ok) or it can be something more serious. Did the courts give the child to your parents? are you a danger to the child? You do have rights but if your parents can prove you baby is not safe with you or your husband they will take the baby. You really did not give enough information.|`|k3LbhASGaa	depends on the mental health issues you have , are you considered dangerous?|`|o0VyLaPiaa	I would contact your local Legal Aid, and see if they can help you through this.|`|366aa3bbb60558f11aecb9d3750bceb2aa	Is there a doctor or mental health center in your area who will advocate for you and help you get the appropriate training to parent better.

If you mean that kind of difference, then I guess, it's not so bad.

That's a positive way to be different.|`|UsbG30Gaaa	Very weird, when I moved to US from Russia, people looked at me like I was a communist.

I can't blame anyone for hating anyone, since it's their life experiences that have lead them to what they are today. I would say that it is very strange, that if you're doing it for the approval of whites and others, then you'll never get anywhere, and that you should always love yourself. However, if you don't want to get along with other Black People, then that's your life and  wish you the best of luck, provided that you don't intend to hurt or hinder me or anyone that I care about.

Tyra had a show about women like this,hating their own race,look it up, you might learn something.|`|r6bSSVKbaa	no, it is perfectly normal of you to hate your own race.|`|CufYHwLgaa	It's called self hatred.

RrQNJsVsaa	I am a professional at writing. It starts out with patients. You just want to get to the main part. You will finally reach patients while you keep writing. If you want to read my books, "Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment" and more. Just keep writing. You will be exerianced. Trust me you WILL start out little. Everyone does. Just keep writing. You will finally get up there. If you want to get up there I was going to try this but I have patients now so I can't, try to write main details and than add extra details making it longer. E-mail me on my page for more teaching skills. I hope your story is sucsessful. You are sucsessful. So good luck! And remember, it takes a few stories to get a push onto start going to make books. You should stick with short stories for now. Hopefully this is what you are asking or else I screwed up bad.

To find out a percentage like that divide your total score from the possible score.  In this case it would be 940/1175.    I think the reason your question ended up in this section is because people often ask what percentage of the population is gay.

iLFYj6Qgaa	"Quand tout est all" can't be used, because aller is "go" in the context of going to school, going to the supermarket, going to work etc.  "Quand tout est parti" is possible, but I would rather say "quand tout a disparu".    For the second part, both options are possible. It's hard to tell the difference. Maybe we can say that   "il y a toujours l'espoir" = there is still hope   "il reste l'espoir" = hope still remains    Personally, I'd use:   Quand tout a disparu, il y a toujours l'espoir.|`|ecOfV8Blaa	quand tout est all, il reste l'espoir im prvoyant sur obtenir ceci comme tatouage.

Clearly my friends who are gay just have sex with men and enjoy it to attract attention.  I'm bi and I like men I always have... You're an ignorant ignoramus.|`|0LKIsD7Oaa	Well, that "camp" stuff is a behavior, all that can be learned and unlearned. But being gay is just apart of who you are.

You are not gay and clearly have no idea what it's all about. Only us gay people know for sure that it is real. There were many times in the past I wish I wasn't gay and that's the truth. Why would I subject myself to abuse and beatings?    Not all gay people are camp much the same as the way that not all camp people are gay, it's just another stereotype. Why would somebody want to 'pretend' to be gay and risk rejection from friends and family members?    Anyway I'm not going to waste my time trying to convince you because the truth is I couldn't care in the slightest whether or not you 'believe' me. I'm just saddened that there are still people who think like this in the year 2009...|`|2nQynHp7aa	TROLL! You're obviously one of those people no matter HOW MANY TIMES that I tell that "its what YOU feel for girls, that I feel for guys", you will still not believe it until you, yourself feels it!

Have you really thought this out?     What you're suggesting is that for thousands of years, select people from completely separate races and geographical locations have decided to attract attention by having sex exclusively with people they are not attracted to, just for attention and the abuse that comes with it.|`|PLZrvfFEaa	Is being straight made up?    Did you get dropped on the head when you were born?|`|gpO5thmSaa	The +10 / 0- thumbs up to your first answer pretty much proves you are wrong.    Made up? Hell some of us wish it was then we wouldn't have to put up with abuse and fear right?|`|tuR7uui1aa	There's a difference between being gay and being camp you know. So my answer is no, being gay is not made up.|`|tvARcEawaa	u just hate us cos we get laid more than you do cos ur a jerk|`|xKoNt1h5aa	In my opinion its inherited and sometime in your life something will trigger this ''gay gene''... now that trigger could be anyone or anything. Its not made up lol|`|3uRM7FKIaa	You do not inherit gayness like the colour of your eyes mate. It is who you are. Now I may be wrong but you must be het and homophobic and you just keep telling yourself that yes, there are no gay people. We will all go away and leave you to it as long as you go away and find someone else to shine that puke pink light on.
65QqZBnjaa	Major flaw in your premise.  A transsexual woman was NEVER a man.  Studies prove our brains are quite similar to brains of other women.  As a result we have ALWAYS felt female.  Surgery does NOT makes us female.  As far as sexual response goes hormones play a bigger role.  After starting hormone replacement therapy testosterone is reduced, estrogen is increased and a persons sexual response changes to that of a natal female.  So:    1. Transsexual women have a female brain    2. Estrogen allows that brain to operate more effiiciently and changes sexual response.    3. Surgery brings the body into alignment with the persons brain.  Thus they are now whole in mind, body and spirit.        None of this would work on a man because well he has a male brain!  Transition, the long, expensive process of correcting our birth condition, is only apppropriate medical treatment for people born transsexual (brain-body mismatch).      More information can be found here:    http://www.LynnConway.com        Hope this helps        edit: And YES I can orgasm.|`|AA10985602	Weird.  m2f- can orgasm, but different equipment sort of  f2m- still has same equipment had before- no testes,sperm, or hole in penis- no male ejaculate|`|LVe6MJfMaa	Maybe they can. If it's a Male-to-Female they're basically just cutting a pole off and digging a hole. If it's a Female-to-Male they are just attaching a pole. Most sensitivity is lost.. I think they can still have sexual desire and feelings but as far as ejaculating no.|`|KGrMMAOaaa	i dont think so. they dont actually get a real "part" lol so they cant feel it no|`|Xef2mbGcaa	Nope.|`|VRsu7c3Paa	Emotionally transgender people will go through the motions of whatever their gender is (post hormones). A good book to read about the mental state of a person on hormones would be the Testosterone Files.     The orgasm does actually change. I know many FtMs that before hormones could have multiple orgasms but after hormones were satisfied with one orgasm, and couldn't do any more than one. FtMs can ejaculate, although it does not contain sperm.|`|HhPgZDDzaa	I'm not sure about the MTF, but I know that a FTM cannot ejaculate post op.|`|5Fm45guAaa	i have no clue but i was told they cant masturbate or have orgasm|`|m7I5QnE1aa	I know that a new male cannot ejaculate.  But I can't see why a new woman couldn't have an orgasm.  It's just from stimulation right?  It may take a little more coaxing, but I'm sure it's possible!|`|NekOuxFEaa	Well if your taking male/female hormones, you'll be able to feel aroused slightly differently, but you will not unless *female to male* you get a penis be able to ejaculate and male to female, (get your penis removed) may not be able to orgasm but you will feel a slightly different arousal.|`|3OZgcntfaa	A transwoman can orgasm, yes.    A transman does not ejaculate in the conventional sense of semen coming from testes ejaculation. Even those with a female body can ejaculate ("female ejaculation" look it up), its a matter of training one's body to respond that way. He doesn't automatically gain that ability after surgery though, no.

28d1daabadd63d26e86fd71474b9230daa	I would go with the classic "Dear Sir or Madam"     I think it has a nice air of respect which is good, especially since you are applying for an internship, and want to come across as very respectful.
O3k4t0i9aa	Hm. That depends. Who do you want to write the story about? There are quite a few characters. You could do a background story of Queen Guinevere, King Arthur's wife. Where did she come from? What was she like? What led her to be unfaithful to Arthur by having an affair with Lancelot? You could even do a story on Lancelot-what type of man was he? Why would he betray his king by having an affair with Guinevere?   You could even do a story on Arthur's parents, though you'll have to do a lot of research there. Or you could write about his half-sister, Morgan(a), the "evil" witch-how did she get that way? Why did she hate Arthur so much? You could even write about his son Mordred, the man who would bring about Arthur's death. Little is written about him, so that would be a lot of fun. Good luck.|`|JlMT4SYkaa	Well heres an idea i came up with a while ago.

rHwMf2P4aa	Just talk to the owner.  Request gas money or to meet you half way.  I think its absolutely fair.  The worst that could happen is they say "no" right.  Your going to get the dog anyway right?  You have nothing to lose.|`|28d1daabadd63d26e86fd71474b9230daa	I would say no. I mean, they are already giving you the dog for free. Plus, since its 2 years old, I'm sure they want as much time with the dog as possible to say goodbye.     Since they are doing so much for you, I think it would be a bit tacky to ask them to drive halfway to meet you.|`|quYp2Ajtaa	um 1/3 of the way, yes it is fine|`|J9C90TIbaa	well......just think of a store or something about halfway between and set a time to meet....if the owner says no then ask how far they would b willing to go.....hope i helped|`|928d3c3f724692764257407068fe45d4aa	If they are not charging you anything for the dog, then you can't ask them to drive the dog closer to you. You need to make the effort.|`|O7SshRl6aa	Perhaps to meet you in THEIR town, but if the dog is free, you should be doing most of the work.|`|upIrlDm5aa	To ask them to go more then halfway is not right, but halfway or less is usually reasonable|`|2404nDvSaa	i would say at most two hours. not much more than that. possibly if they have free time they will bring it farther!  hope i helped.|`|AA11788494	yes|`|eTFYpcQIaa	I think about half way is fair enough. As long as you aren't asking them to drive all the way to you is fine.    I hope you like your dog!! :)|`|yPjw6lzYaa	that depends on how far you are driving. some people are nice enough to do that but some people are not, the only thing i would do is call them and very politely ask them if they have a problem meeting you somewhere between you two that way you don' have to drive as far. just explain the situation to them and they should be alright with it depending on the person|`|CPZA5qrGaa	Take an adult and couple friends with you.

Answers and everyone else cares.|`|y67OLTiLaa	Halfway. It is acceptable for both of you. If they cannot make it halfway, see how far they are willing to go. It would be one thing if they lived an hour away, but I personally think it would be rude to ask 'drive 7 hours please'. That is taking advantage, to me.      I don't understand why you would drive 7 hours for a dog, however. That is just a little crazy, and even if you were lucky enough, you'd be driving at least 3.5 hours each way.|`|Xnh2tmQlaa	You want the dog, you should take the trouble to go and get it.|`|WrMNnEumaa	meet them half way if its ok      but if your the one thats really intrested in the dog you should drive those 7 hours girl =)

6Whz1p5Eaa	I do like Christian music a lot, and I do listen to Christian rock sometimes. Honestly, I definitely would not listen to that style of music if it wasn't Christian.     I prefer "Sacred" music like chants and stuff. Or Christian indie. Also, I really like the new movement to modernize hymns. Red Mountain Music churns out tons of amazing CDs of old forgotten hymns put to beautiful, unique music    I have made the choice to only listen to Christian music or non lyrical. Not because I feel the Bible commands it or anything, it's just a personal choice I've made, because I always get songs stuck in my head and I'd prefer the song I listen to all day (in my head) to at least encourage me.|`|AA11108627	1. Either or both.  There are some songs with lyrics I dislike, even though they are "Christian" songs.  Other songs I would appreciate if the lyrics were "Christian" or not.    The artist I feel is the best at producing music that is technically, aesthetically, and inspirationally of high quality is Larry Norman.  A quinessential 60's rocker who writes his own songs & lyrics, is a creative & talented musician, who also inspires me through his music - an unbeatable combination!  Of course, that is a matter of taste.  But in my book he is one of a select few who produces quality music that is truly inspirational.      2. I appreciate quality music as an art form.  The word "explicit" can mean different things, so I'm not sure how to answer this question specifically.      If a song has lyrics or messages that are overtly offensive, it is impossible for me to ignore that (ie, I refuse to listen to "Sympathy for the Devil" by the Rolling Stones, or music with obscene, demeaning language).  Nor will I listen to anything by groups who clearly identify as anti-Christian or pro-Satanic (ie, Iron Maiden).  But I will not dismiss all secular music, even some that other Christians may find offensive.  If there is a definitive message and/or an artistic quality in the song, it tends to be attractive to me.      3. What do you mean by "sinful"?  Is the music sinful in and of itself, or would it be sinful for someone like myself to listen to or like it?  Well, in general, the Bible says that "whatever is not of faith is sin", so it would be hard to separate obscenity from sinfulness.      I think it depends on the intent of the artist.  Are they presenting obscenity as something good or something bad?  If the artist is spouting out obscenity as something to desire, something as a substitute for quality art they are not talented enough to produce, or as something specifically designed to offend believers such as myself, I will reject it.      But if an erotic love affair is presented as something it's not all cracked up to be, you can make a case that despite having "obscene" subject matter, positive lessons can be learned from the song - hence, it may have some redeeming value.    So, in summary, the answers depend on what is specifically meant by some of the terms you used.  But I hope my answer helped and was reasonably clear for you.|`|P544Sbmqaa	Both.      I dont think music in and of itself can be explicit or obscene.  Only the lyrics can be explicit.    I wonder how many people answering this listen to Southern Gospel, which is essentially country music with religious lyrics.  If rock music in and of itself is explicit, so is country music.|`|dCUOdbEbaa	I like it for BOTH of those reasons.|`|LVe6MJfMaa	1. No I don't enjoy it because it's Christian, because I'm atheist. I enjoy it for the musical qualities.  2. Who cares if it's explicit curse words or sexual themes is a part of life.  3. No, I'm an atheist. I don't consider anything a sin, but I consider things wrong. I don't think obscene music is wrong though, it's an expression of emotions.|`|WO1jgqWqaa	There is nothing obscene about electric guitars or any other element of rock aside from the lyrics and the lifestyles that secular rockers live. The same goes for any kind of music; music is a vessel for self-expression so the use of electric guitars or any other element  aren't what's important; it's the lyrics of the songs and the way that the artists live their lives that matters.|`|ZDDya5Ibaa	Don't be silly. no one enjoys christian rock.|`|lh2hEzoMaa	No, i like lots of music. Christian and explicit.|`|JmNs0Hgbaa	lol i like hillsong (:    its okay if you hate it, cus most people do.    i like it cus its like.. bible in music. its relaxing to listen to.|`|kltRWD81aa	I like it for BOTH reasons. I also listen to music that is explicit I know I shouldn't but I do. I know that god doesn't approve..... and I don't know why I listen to it then.|`|eLAkduCJaa	I enjoy listening to it simply because I know the members of the band are Christian. It gives me a sense of security almost to know that. The lyrics can be nice at times as well.    When it comes to explicit music, I don't mind TOO much because there are a few non-Christian bands that I like that curse in their lyrics, but don't exactly give off bad messages. Now when it's satanic...that's totally different >.>    I don't consider cursing in a song sinful...I guess it may be "wrong" but I don't mind it as long as it's not overused.    By the way some bands I listen to are Underoath, Relient K, and blessthefall just to name a few.|`|3qnZKLcTaa	I'm not even Christian and I like Christian rock. The Devil Wears Prada and Underoath are awesome! :)  Well anyways other music is not sinful.|`|q5lreoiWaa	Christian Rock is pretty much like any other genre of music - there is good and alas, there is bad. If music is explicit for a reason, as in the theme of the song, then ok but gratuitous  anything is a little objectionable. I do not consider music of any sort to be sinful in and of itself, but I try to follow the counsel of my Church leaders who advise that we members try to surround ourselves with positive music.|`|rRCTvT7Saa	Two bands that I love are Stryper and Petra--two Christian rock bands.  Both bands are extremely talented and, along with that, their songs send out a Christian music.  I honestly can only listen to Christian rock when the artist is musically talented.  I mean, if they're not talented music-wise, there'd be no point in listening to their music.    When it comes to explicit music, I'll listen to an artist as long as the musicianship is good.  Take the rock band Jackyl, for example--their songs contain bad language, but they're all very talented as musicians.    In some cases, I would consider obscene music sinful.  In other cases, I wouldn't.  I guess it depends on how obscene a song is.|`|wyXCRGv6aa	ok well i don't like either but some have a weird sense of music i am currently listening to scar singing on lion king!|`|eBqMhpOEaa	well it totally depends on the artist and the song....|`|zYAQrnjcaa	There are all genres of Christian music out there just as in non-Christian music. Some I like, some I don't, it's a matter of personal preference really.    As for obscene music being sinful, more than likely it is, but I guess it depends on your definition of the word "obscene".|`|2so60OEZaa	I like it because of the lyrics and its rhythm some songs are really good like Perfect Love and it's not sinful because it still has its meaning and just because it's Christian doesn't mean it has to be quiet.|`|ZLabz00naa	I dont like it because I dont want my music trying to brainwash me     anyway, all the best bands are affiliated with satan|`|TkUL4OINaa	Hate Christian Rock..    Had the motive similar to all types of musics.    Trying to get people saved easily through concerts.. isn't scriptural..  by touching their emotions through hearing of touchy songs...    The proper way is to teach the Truth, speaking the Truth into the people even if the way is not as attractive as the concern because God bless those who labor abundantly like Paul, who broke bread from house to house.|`|KZ9ZE3yJaa	I love christian rock.   I like it for both reasons... the way it sounds and the lyrics.    Hmm... In my opinion I don't think its sinful.  Others may though.      You should try to listen to Seth Condrey. He's really good.|`|AHeLeaMBaa	I enjoy both.  I love the lyrics of most of the hymns and what they mean, but the music doesn't inspire a lot of passion.  I enjoy Christian rock because it parallels the passion of the lyrics, imo.|`|9XRUBkWCaa	hahah both. I like all rock, but i cant stand rap songs with all that sex. its disgusting.|`|CKHzrI7Waa	I love Christian Rock. The lyrics have to speak to me in any type of music. Profanity just doesn't speak to me. It's not sinful just stupid. Reminds me of little kids trying to act grown but looking ridiculous.|`|K2o7xcstaa	I like Christian rock. I like it because of the musical quality and b/c it's christian. I do not consider it sinful.. It's not my favortie genre of music though by far. I listen to everything.

lvBUl3Zdaa	The "American dream" is based on working class white men earning a good enough wage to support a Leave it to Beaver family in suburbia, while their wives stayed home and kept house, whether they wanted to or not. Women at that time did not have their choice of jobs, and single mother households often lived in poverty, the good jobs all going to men who "needed them to support a family". There were plenty of people who didn't earn living wages at the time, who were never part of the American dream (anybody remember how many of those American dream families had maids?), and without their cheap labor and the labor of foreigners abroad, the American dream of the time would have been considerably more down-to-earth.|`|a4LWildhaa	Within the next four years, pretty much.

51fe01ef6db0c1bd743afcb3e7a2e1ffaa	It's amazing, really, when they insist on sola scriptrue and a literal interpretation of the Bible, that they reject the most literal teaching of all.     It also seems to me that if the Early Fathers taught anything, they taught the Real Presence of Christ in the Eucharist. People like Ignatius of Antioch, Justin Martyr, Irenaeus, Clement of Alexandria, Tertullian and Origen all taught the Real Presence. It was a teaching handed down from earliest times and is certainly Biblical. How can it be rejected so easily? What I would like to know is why so many protestants insist that the Real Presence isn't even a possibility? If they truly upheld their ideals about personal interpretation of the Bible they would have to admit it.    What about the fact that later Jesus says my words are spirit and life? Does that not mean symbolic? In fact there is not one time in the bible where spirit means symbolic. God is Spirit, he obviously is real and not symbolic. Surrounding vv. 6:61-65, Jesus says that the Son of Man will ascend into heaven. This is right before the words "My words are Spirit and Life". Do those Protestants who reject the Real Presence hold that Jesus symbolically or figuratively rose to heaven after his death? Or do they believe, with Catholics, that he literally bodily rose from the dead, not only by his power, (Jn 2:18), but by the power of the Spirit was made alive (1 Peter 3:18). How many bible believing Protestants believe that Jesus did not literally ascend into heaven? So they seem to take that part of the saying literally and the next verse make a symbol, just to avoid the overtones of Jesus' actual words. Honest exegesis requires consistency.    If one understands his flesh to be symbolic, he does away with that idea by saying that the same flesh will be given up on the cross. How many Protestants do not believe that Jesus literally gave his flesh on the cross? This flesh will be given to eat. If the flesh we eat for eternal life is meant in only a "figurative way" or "spiritually speaking", then so is the flesh of the crucifixion! Jesus equates the two. Either they are both literal, or they are both figurative.    Jesus comes to us physically because of his great love for us. Anyone who loves wants to be physically close to the one who is loved, but it is sometimes impossible. It is not impossible for God. Divine power changes bread and wine into the real body and blood of Christ, and he dwells physically on earth in every tabernacle, and comes physically into us in Holy Communion.          "They abstain from the Eucharist and from prayer, because they do not admit that the Eucharist is the flesh of our Savior Jesus Christ,.." - St. Ignatius of Antioch, "Letter to the Smyrnaeans", paragraph 6. circa 80-110 A.D."|`|IqYQLL0jaa	We does not reject the feast of the Lord, we just reject some of your church's teachings as non-Biblical|`|ac0rRBHCaa	Because I'm not hunger I just ate|`|q3Lae9p1aa	I'm a noncatholic christian.

I am Church of Christ and we have communion weekly. It is a very serious & important part of our 'denomination.'  It is basically eating the cracker(symbolic of the body--unleavened bread) and drinking the grape juice(symbolic of his body--wine). We do this after we have repented, just as Catholics do. Afterwards, we also tithe to give back a portion of what He has so richly blessed us with.      I could go into more detail, but I'm going to leave this at an answer rather than a sermon.    EDIT: "If you are doing a symbolic titual then you are committing a desecration of His commandment and bringing condemnation on yourself as St. Paul warned."      I have to ask, do you personally have stored somewhere real flesh and blood from Christ's body?  If not then whatever you use in your communion is only symbolic as well. I'm having issues seeing the difference here.  I agree with what someone said above me. Why must we, as Christians, condemn one another when so much of our religion is based upon love? And why does it take an atheist, who doesn't even believe in our religion but seems to understand it better, to point this out to us? Have we all really became that blind?    EDIT:  Trying to clarify my beliefs for some of you:  Ok, I partake in communion. We use crackers and grape juice at my church. One also doesn't partake unless they have been baptized, because they have not accepted Christ as their Savior. While communing is a personal matter decided upon the individual, we are taught to not partake unless we have repented of our sins. Also, that we do so to remember Christ and the sacrifice he made. If I didn't feel or believe in his presence, then why would I even go to church in the first place?  (Also, tithing is a separate from the communion. I just threw that in as part of what we practice)     I'm not wanting this to become a huge religious argument. At this point I'm trying to understand how we are rejecting it when so many of us practice it.|`|zYAQrnjcaa	Simply put... we do not reject it, we simply do it differently.

In the book of John, Jesus is speaking to the nation Israel. He is speaking to Kingdom believers. Not to the Body of Christ. The Body of Christ had not even come to be, as of yet.    Try reading the Gospel of the Grace of God, given to Paul by direct revelation from the risen Christ. There is nothing said about this in that gospel.     We must follow the RISEN Lord Jesus Christ, not Christ in the flesh.    "Wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh: yea, though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now henceforth know we Him no more." 2 Corin. 5:16|`|oVHFz52Laa	Protestants protest teachings like this. We have the holy communion every week at my church. We do it in remembrance of Jesus. It is not a stipulation for our salvation to believe this is really his blood and flesh we are eating. For us it is symbolic.|`|QLDMmp6Taa	It just amazes me that many so-called Christians do not desire the Eucharist and even go so far as to make a mockery of it-- especially since the bible has the Eucharist both prophesied and instituted within it.  In fact, the very Eucharist itself is historically CENTRAL to Christianity.    God demanded circumcision and blood sacrifice in the first covenant.  What would they have thought then?  Would they have made a mockery of the tabernacle?  Would they have scoffed at circumcision?  Would they have been distressed by the blood sacrifice?      Certainly they would have!  Because God gave to them the bread of life, a pure oblation (Malachi 1:11), so that they could give honor and glory to Him.  And in eating and drinking they can enter into communion with Him so that they can have life within them.  But they have rejected it just as many rejected Jesus when he said "I am the bread of the life" (John 6:51).  So if we who take part in the Eucharist place ourselves within the one true sacrifice our Lord made for us, then by their mockery and by their scoffing they crucify Him; making themselves guilty of the Body and Blood of our Lord.|`|E9chZY74aa	I partake of the Lord's Supper each week as commanded.

They simply believe it is a symbolic feast and not literal flesh and blood.    edit: Desecration? That is a strong word my friend. Throughout the gospels Jesus spoke in symbolic terms and taught by allegorical example. What makes you believe these passages are any different? If I am wrong in my beliefs, God will show me.    edit: My friend, I have never heard of Ulrich Zwingli. The bible taught me that Jesus would teach by using parables and allegorical examples rather than using literal terms.    Psalm 78   1 O my people, hear my teaching;         listen to the words of my mouth.     2 I will open my mouth in parables,         I will utter hidden things, things from of old-    edit: I would like to add a couple more things to this discussion. I was simply trying to answer your question from my perspective. You asked why I reject the Lord's Supper and I told you that I do not. The other point I tried to make is that I do not believe the bread becomes the literal flesh of Christ anymore than I believe I suffered a literal death at the time of my baptism or that I must be literally born again to gain eternal life. If you chose to believe differently, I have no problem with that.|`|X9rXRNUxaa	Christ, having thus spoken of himself as the bread of life, and of faith as the work of God, comes more particularly to show what of himself is this bread, namely, his flesh, and that to believe is to eat of that, Joh_6:51-58, where he still prosecutes the metaphor of food. Observe, here, the preparation of this food: The bread that I will give is my flesh (Joh_6:51), the flesh of the Son of man and his blood, Joh_6:53. His flesh is meat indeed, and his blood is drink indeed, Joh_6:55. observe, also, the participation of this food: We must eat the flesh of the Son of man and drink his blood (Joh_6:53); and again (Joh_6:54), Whoso eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood; and the same words (Joh_6:56, Joh_6:57), he that eateth me. This is certainly a parable or figurative discourse, wherein the actings of the soul upon things spiritual and divine are represented by bodily actions about things sensible, which made the truths of Christ more intelligible to some, and less so to others, Mar_4:11-12. Now,  (1.) Let us see how this discourse of Christ was liable to mistake and misconstruction, that men might see, and not perceive. [1.] It was misconstrued by the carnal Jews, to whom it was first delivered (Joh_6:52): They strove among themselves; they whispered in each other's ears their dissatisfaction: How can this man give us his flesh to eat? Christ spoke (Joh_6:51) of giving his flesh for us, to suffer and die; but they, without due consideration, understood it of his giving it to us, to be eaten, which gave occasion to Christ to tell them that, however what he said was otherwise intended, yet even that also of eating of his flesh was no such absurd thing (if rightly understood) as prima facie - in the first instance, they took it to be. [2.] It has been wretchedly misconstrued by the church of Rome for the support of their monstrous doctrine of transubstantiation, which gives the lie to our senses, contradicts the nature of a sacrament, and overthrows all convincing evidence. They, like these Jews here, understand it of a corporal and carnal eating of Christ's body, like Nicodemus, ch. 3, 4. The Lord's supper was not yet instituted, and therefore it could have no reference to that; it is a spiritual eating and drinking that is here spoken of, not a sacramental. [3.] It is misunderstood by many ignorant carnal people, who hence infer that, if they take the sacrament when they die, they shall certainly go to heaven, which, as it makes many that are weak causelessly uneasy if they want it, so it makes many that are wicked causelessly easy if they have it. Therefore,  (2.) Let us see how this discourse of Christ is to be understood.  [1.] What is meant by the flesh and blood of Christ. It is called (Joh_6:53), The flesh of the Son of man, and his blood, his as Messiah and Mediator: the flesh and blood which he assumed in his incarnation (Heb_2:14), and which he gave up in his death and suffering: my flesh which I will give to be crucified and slain. It is said to be given for the life of the world, that is, First, Instead of the life of the world, which was forfeited by sin, Christ gives his own flesh as a ransom or counterprice. Christ was our bail, bound body for body (as we say), and therefore his life must go for ours, that ours may be spared. Here am I, let these go their way. Secondly, In order to the life of the world, to purchase a general offer of eternal life to all the world, and the special assurances of it to all believers. So that the flesh and blood of the Son of man denote the Redeemer incarnate and dying; Christ and him crucified, and the redemption wrought out by him, with all the precious benefits of redemption: pardon of sin, acceptance with God, the adoption of sons, access to the throne of grace, the promises of the covenant, and eternal life; these are called the flesh and blood of Christ, 1. Because they are purchased by his flesh and blood, by the breaking of his body, and shedding of his blood. Well may the purchased privileges be denominated from the price that was paid for them, for it puts a value upon them; write upon them pretium sanguinis - the price of blood. 2. Because they are meat and drink to our souls. Flesh with the blood was prohibited (Gen_9:4), but the privileges of the gospel are as flesh and blood to us, prepared for the nourishment of our souls. He had before compared himself to bread, which is necessary food; here to flesh, which is delicious. It is a feast of fat things, Isa_25:6. The soul is satisfied with Christ as with marrow and fatness, Psa_63:5. It is meat indeed, and drink indeed; truly so, that is spiritually; so Dr. Whitby; as Christ is called the true vine; or truly meat, in opposition to the shows and shadows with which the world shams off those that feed upon it. In Christ and his gospel there is real supply, solid satisfaction; that is meat indeed, and drink indeed, which satiates and replenishes, Jer_31:25, Jer_31:26.  [2.] What is meant by eating this fl|`|9ZwFQadRaa	I don't reject anything the Bible teaches. I just don't believe in all of your extra stuff. Not necessary to have a relationship with Jesus.|`|38f15601baa14cb41ff2021454524fbbaa	Let me ask the "symbolic" and "memorial" crowd one thing: how can a symbol or a memorial service warrant spiritual death?    1Corinthians 11:27-30  Wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread, and drink this cup of the Lord, unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord. But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of that bread, and drink of that cup. For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord's body. For this cause many are weak and sickly among you, and many sleep.     St. Paul spelled it out for everyone. If you don't discern the Lord's body (i.e., the Real Presence of Christ in the Sacrament of the Eucharist) and receive Him unworthily (with mortal sin on your soul), you have brought down damnation on yourself.     God wouldn't send anyone to Hell just for eating a cracker and drinking some grape juice. Only profaning the Body and Blood of Christ could merit a punishment like that.    Edit:    Point  2 -- the sentence structure that Christ used at the Last Supper also proves that the bread and wine become His Body and Blood in all but appearance.    The King James and most subsequent translations do the reader a disservice by adding the word "is" to "This is My Body. This is My Blood." In the original, the verb doesn't exist. Christ is making a direct correlation between "this" (bread and wine) and "Body, Blood." A more accurate way of putting it is:    This (bread)= My Body. This (wine)= My Blood.    Jesus didn't leave any doubt about the bread and wine becoming His Body and Blood. He didn't intend to.|`|2CBxqNcaaa	Friend,    I do not believe in the literal changing of bread and wine into flesh and blood.    I do partake of the Last Supper as our Lord directed   "In remembrance of Me"    The biggest reason is that to believe in the literal change means that Christ would be sacrificed over and over, mass after mass for nearly 2000 years.    He suffered and died for our sins once.  That is all that was necessary.    thank you.|`|VRl1jENHaa	We don't reject it; in fact, some Protestant denominations have Communion each Sunday.  Others have it once a month.    The difference is that most (but not all) don't believe that He is literally present within the Eucharist (i.e that the Eucharist literally turns into flesh and blood).  It is believed that He is symbolically present, but yet His literal presence comes as the Eucharist is partaken.  In other words, it's considered a "mystery."    EDIT:  You wrote:  "If you are doing a symbolic [ritual] then you are committing a desecration of His commandment and bringing condemnation on yourself as St. Paul warned."    I have two observations:    1)  Paul didn't warn against this.  You're using Scripture out of context; and  2)  Romans 14:4 Who are you to judge anothers servant?

Nowhere does Jesus say  He is speaking symbolically or in a parable.      Jesus first repeated what he said, then summarized: "I am the living bread which came down from heaven; if any one eats of this bread, he will live for ever; and the bread which I shall give for the life of the world is my flesh. The Jews then disputed among themselves, saying, How can this man give us his flesh to eat?" (John 6:5152).     His listeners were stupefied because now they understood Jesus literallyand correctly. He again repeated his words, but with even greater emphasis, and introduced the statement about drinking his blood: "Truly, truly, I say to you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of man and drink his blood, you have no life in you; he who eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day. For my flesh is food indeed, and my blood is drink indeed. He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood abides in me, and I in him" (John 6:5356).       No Corrections        Notice that Jesus made no attempt to soften what he said, no attempt to correct "misunderstandings," for there were none. Our Lords listeners understood him perfectly well. They no longer thought he was speaking metaphorically. If they had, if they mistook what he said, why no correction?     And yes if they do not believe in the true presence of Christ they are descrating the flesh and the blood of Jesus Christ      Whoever therefore, eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of profaning the body and blood of the Lord. " (1st Corinthians 11:27)    Where the True Presence of the Holy Eucharist is, there is Jesus Christ.  Where Jesus Christ is, there is the Catholic Church.|`|VsCrYYMeaa	Their understanding of Scripture is erroneous.    The Apostles have  taught the real presence of Jesus in the Eucharist.  True Christians have always believed this truth.|`|C8gLsP3Taa	"I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread: and when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said, Take, eat: this is my body, which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of me. After the same manner also he took the cup, when he had supped, saying, This cup is the New Testament in my blood: this do ye, as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of me. For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do shew the Lords death till he come. Wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread, and drink this cup of the Lord, unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord. But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of that bread, and drink of that cup" (I Cor.11:23-28).     Transubstantiation is an  interpretation is held by the Roman Catholic Church. It declares that by the consecration of the priest the bread and wine cease to remain, as such, and become the actual body and blood of the Lord Jesus Christ. This Faith contends that when the Lord said, "Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, ye have no life in you" (John 6:53), he meant the actual flesh and blood of Christ. Therefore, the Mass is that ritual which turns the bread and wine into the actual flesh and blood of Christ. The priest alone drinks the wine, as not one drop of Christs blood must be spilt. The bread is in the form of a wafer, so that not a crumb of His body should be lost. In answer to this we ask, "How could Christ, while being in His perfect body, hold part of His body in His hand when he said, This is my body?"   Consubstantiation is an interpretation held by the the Lutherans and the Church of England who believe this interpretation, which states that, while the bread remains bread, and the wine remains wine, the body and blood is present in a spiritual sense; the body and blood are present only at the moment when they are partaken of, and after being taken, cease to be the body and blood of Christ.   Symbolism  is held by usually the non Catholics. This is the true interpretation, which states that the bread and wine are only symbols of Christs body and blood, which were offered upon Calvarys cross for the remission of sins. "This do in remembrance of me"; it is observed in blessed memory, and that is where it ends.

This is not meant to be a pro-Israeli comment.  The word Hebrew comes from the word Heber, and Heber was a great grandpa to Abraham, and Abraham was the father of Islam, Judaism, and Christianity (and some argue also of Seeks, Hinduism, and Buddism).

As anywhere, some people do not like it, but at least here ... it doesn't matter if they like it or not. Land of the "sorta" free... :)

uky2nsh8aa	first of all, ur born gay, u don't choose or want to be so, and some do, some don't. depends on the people and the relationship.|`|1hS27eJuaa	it depends on the couple, just like any couple there all different because every person is different.|`|bRAmXcowaa	yes there can be, like in all relationships. Someone wears the pants and the pother gives the love, just like straight couples|`|HH90Eghaaa	Nope not for me, those roles are give and take just like in my heterosexual relationships! No one is entirely dominate and no one is entirely submissive!|`|4kqvnQtUaa	Gay, Submissive, If you have any more questions send me a E-Mail, I'll ba happy to answer anything.|`|376ce902307f5e574ed98c7f99ccba8daa	There may be a dominant and submissive role structure, but no male and female role structure.

It really depends on the people and the relationship.|`|YdwHmohPaa	go to church|`|R4EYPeLGaa	Aww it's not offensive when you ask it like that.    Um, yeah. There can be dominant and sumissive partners. Or the relationship can have versatile people.     When you go to find a boyfriend, do you say... "Hi, I'm subby, I can't date you unless you're dominant?"     No you get to know the person. Same as same sex couples.    Good answer? lol      Hugggs. =]|`|62eb64f00529ec4e271b0beecf4776c0aa	Well in my relationship I'm considered the guy because I dress like one but that's only because she's girly and I'm guyish. If it were too girly girls then it's different same with guyish girls if there were two of them then that is pretty much their decision who wants to be girly or guyish or if they even want to do that. I may be guyish but my girlfriend is more dominant in the relationship. It just all depends really on what you and your partner want.|`|PSzzjf4naa	Some gays play out such rigid roles , but it was more commen years ago , when strait ideas of how gays should  act  were actually paid attention to -|`|NekOuxFEaa	Oh my, when I first became bi this was the MAIN question on my mind, haha.  Alright.  USUALLY on a GIRL and GIRL relationship, there is a more dominant, aka more "male" girl in the relationship. Not necessarily do they have to be more guyish, but they usually are the one who starts the hand holding and kissing.  in a GUY on GUY relationship sometimes there is no more dominant male, it's really mainly in girl on girl for some reason.|`|6dP60V3zaa	just like in a straight relationship, in a gay or lesbian relationship there are dominant and submissive roles, but sometime you can have couples that are both dominant and submissive. as for me i'm a butch, so i'm the dominant one in the relationship and I date women who are more submissive otherwise there would be a constant power struggle.|`|2nQynHp7aa	You're just curious so there's no need for me to attack you :]    There is some misconception on that because I have come to find out that not many people follow by the "you're the submissive, I'm the dominant" thing. They just flow with how they were raised. Me, being practically dependent on everyone my whole life have come to be "submissive" because of that.|`|fp7yIOBhaa	Yes, sometimes one partner will be more dominate and the other will be more submissive.|`|Nsgh1XzLaa	uhm not really it depends on their personality.  some gays (not me) act femenine and some act straight.  no it is the same as two guys being together.  and no i doesnt always work that wa (male and female).|`|YvNMUnR6aa	I am straight too and there is an equal, a submissive, and a dominant side. although most are equal, a dominant would be more masculine and submissive would be more feminine.|`|LCCsJ62Saa	It just depends on the couple. For me it's like having two wives. Female and female.

NKeXfLAYaa	Thanks for answering my question. :)   You could always go to a mall, and watch a movie with them.   Or, you could go to an outdoor skating rink, and then   go out for lunch with them, maybe grab a hot chocolate?   Sleepovers are always awesome. You could paint each other's nails?   Makeovers? Listen to awesome music, play truth or dare?   Hope this helped. Have a good birthday!|`|T7L5r1i3aa	Roller-skating rinks usually have birthday celebrations.

But there's no use crying over every mistake  You just keep on trying till you run out of cake  And the science gets done and you make a neat gun  For the people who are still alive.  I'm not even angry.  I'm being so sincere right now.  Even though you broke my heart.  And killed me.    And tore me to pieces.  And threw every piece into a fire.  As they burned it hurt because I was so happy for you!  Now these points of data make a beautiful line.    And we're out of beta.  We're releasing on time.  So I'm GLaD. I got burned.

Maybe Black Mesa    THAT WAS A JOKE.  HAHA. FAT CHANCE.    Anyway, this cake is great.  It's so delicious and moist.    Look at me still talking  when there's Science to do.  When I look out there, it makes me GLaD I'm not you.    I've experiments to run.  There is research to be done.  On the people who are still alive.  And believe me I am still alive.

3OZgcntfaa	Two females interacting in a sexual manner is considered a low risk sexual activity... but that doesn't mean you are 100% safe from STDs.    There's always a chance of contracting something when engaging in human interaction, let alone sexual acts. If someone has a cold sore, a rash, anything like that... It could be signs of a contagious condition.    Love yourselves enough to get in the practice of safe sex. Get a test and use protection if you two aren't exclusively each others only bed partners.|`|376ce902307f5e574ed98c7f99ccba8daa	You don't have to have sex to get an STD, so YES you can catch one from a virgin. What about sharing needles? Has there been any drug use? Other accidents can happen where one comes into contact with contaminated blood.    Be careful always - virgin or not.|`|4kqvnQtUaa	You never know if they were lieing or not.|`|DMfNi6Pwaa	How could you transmit something you can't have.? No|`|oY4vwdjVaa	Technically yes. If your mother had an STD like herpes, and gave birth to you the normal way, you would have it too.    But most likely you're both clean. Either way, you should always use protection no matter what.|`|le29yexraa	Well if she made out with people then it's possible, and it's possible she was born with one. But it's probably unlikely|`|BHb5LPb1aa	Not that i am doubting your friend but just because someone says they are a virgin dosent mean they are     And yes some stds can be transfer if say the person got a cut and came into contact to another persons blood through lets say contact sports or there is a a certain strain of hemptitus that you can get if someone who has it went to the toilet and didnt wash their hands afterwards and they handled your food    Not all STDs have symptomes or are transfered from unprotected sex the only real way to know for sure is if both of yous to get tested at a sexual health clinic or your school clinic if they provide that service    Dont want to sound negative but thats the facts and if you dont belive me ask any registred nurce or doctor|`|AA11156135	Sure, - is she otherwise sexually promiscuous?|`|NekOuxFEaa	If she's a virgin, you cannot get an STD.

He was called by other names, all of which described certain aspects of His nature or Divine Character.      Yahweh is His covenant name to His covenant people, and it means:  "I AM (or HE IS, depending upon which form is used at the time) present to help, save, deliver, heal and keep covenant."  His name IS His covenant to His people.  Yahweh is constructed in the Hebrew text by what's called the tetragrammaton, Greek for "4 letter word" - YHWH, with vowel markings between the Y and H, and between the W and second H.

Because names have so much power.  Example, if someone call you from your back..you turn your head right.  This also one of the reason why God as you refer don't have name.    God you refer, is already present in everything.  Lift a stone and it is there.  It is in every DNA, Atoms, Protons, Electrons...and in between them.  It is the seen and unseen...the positives and the negatives.  It is all around you and in you.  It is formless because it is present in all forms.  It requires no name because name is a character of a "Self" and he have no self because he is a non-self.  Name is an attachment and in turn an aggregate...that is also why he have no name.    He is not even he nor she...because he is not a man nor a woman...because the existence of man and woman is for the basis of procreation...It doesn't need to multiple...it just exist and cannot unexist.  Humans..name people and things... just to refer, so that in a point of conversation there would be logic if say you call God...it means Allah, the All Seeing Eye, The Absolute Goodness,  THe Almighty..The I am.  Nothing more.    If one dwell too much on the name...and attach himself to that name...other than just to give reference...then he didn't learn anything.  Attachment brings chaos and great suffering.  Wars have been fought since even before the time of Christ until this very day people still die because of blind faith.  If people cannot agree on simple faith...why not believe in the preservation of goodness and planet earth.  If Earth is gone...where will humans be?

8k6kxOh2aa	by the song the devil went down to georgia      The devil went down to Georgia, he was looking for a soul to steal.  He was in a bind 'cos he was way behind: he was willin' to make a deal.  When he came across this young man sawin' on a fiddle and playin' it hot.  And the devil jumped upon a hickory stump and said: "Boy let me tell you what:   "I bet you didn't know it, but I'm a fiddle player too.   "And if you'd care to take a dare, I'll make a bet with you.  "Now you play a pretty good fiddle, boy, but give the devil his due:  "I bet a fiddle of gold against your soul, 'cos I think I'm better than you."  The boy said: "My name's Johnny and it might be a sin,  "But I'll take your bet, your gonna regret, 'cos I'm the best that's ever been."    Johnny you rosin up your bow and play your fiddle hard.  'Cos hells broke loose in Georgia and the devil deals it hard.  And if you win you get this shiny fiddle made of gold.  But if you lose, the devil gets your soul.     The devil opened up his case and he said: "I'll start this show."  And fire flew from his fingertips as he resined up his bow.   And he pulled the bow across his strings and it made an evil hiss.   Then a band of demons joined in and it sounded something like this.  When the devil finished, Johnny said: "Well you're pretty good ol' son.  "But if you'll sit down in that chair, right there, and let me show you how its done."     Fire on the moun, run boys, run.  The devil's in the house of the risin' sun.  Chicken in the bread pin, pickin' out dough.  "Granny, does your dog bite?"  "No, child, no."    The devil bowed his head because he knew that he'd been beat.  He laid that golden fiddle on the ground at Johnny's feet.  Johnny said: "Devil just come on back if you ever want to try again.  "I told you once, you son of a *****, I'm the best that's ever been."    And he played fire on the mount, run boys, run.  The devil's in the house of the risin' sun.  Chicken in the bread pin pickin' out dough.  "Granny, does your dog bite?"  "No, child, no."

I usually notice the person who appeals most to my personal tastes regardless of their posture. But I'm sure some postures are more attractive than others just in general--people normally aren't attracted to someone who looks miserable, slouchy, and not confident. An attractive posture for me is probably just someone who is standing casually but confidently. Nothing fancy, just normal, hands on side, and in a confident way.
0HYfFZKVaa	I have been told that at interview you have to sell yourself. Why should they pick you over the other 200 applicants? Evaluate your self, strength weakness that kind of stuff. Just as you were going on a job interview speak clearly and try not to let your nerves show. Think of things like this. GOOD LUCK!!!

She had passed away and we were living there. Mx ex helped his cousin steal my mom's antiques and sell them for drugs. The cousin purposely burned the house. (We have proof, but live in a very corrupt county in Illinois). 2 1/2 years after the house fire, the guy that burned the house died of natural causes ON MY EX HUSBAND'S BIRTHDAY!  Karma, or message from God?|`|eCaLnoSiaa	Eventually people get whats coming to them. Its called karma|`|6kixFzrGaa	i've always wondered that! maybe because the good people grow stronger? just a thought.|`|zPb24HrQaa	We have all felt that the people who deserve to get caught don't and the ones who always do the right thing trouble seems to find them. I believe that you get what you put out into the world. Every ones luck runs out sometime. I agree with last post, KARMA!
