My older brother recently moved out and got a pitbull, i think he's almost one year and whenever my brother needs to bathe him, he brings him over the house.  This afternoon i happened to be home and i took my little poodle out to see what they were doing.  He went to go get the hose and sprayed him so much with it.  Throughout the whole thing he was crying and whining, and shaking obviously since the water was cold.. Is this wrong?? or am i just sensitive since i would NEVER do that to my poodle.     By the way... i did scream at him MANY times =/ hes not hurt or anything, he just ignored me.

I've always fed my dogs Pedigree; because i thought it was a decent dog food until i found out about all the fillers that were in it!   Then, I went to Petsmart and purchased Nature's Recipe. I was pretty satisfied because I heard a lot of good things about it online; but then I searched further into some of the questions on here and saw that it has a lot of fillers.  But the bag says it doesn't....      Is is true that it's a bad food?      I only want the best for my male aussie, female husky, and female pom.      if Natures Recipe isn't too good, Whats another healthy dog food thats affordable???         thanks so very much to all who answer !!!! xx

Did you hear that there have been reports of Labradoodles turning on their owners when they get older?    It has been reported that because both Labradors and Poodles have Hypothyroidism that run through their breeds that the chances for the Labradoodle to come down with this has increased. It seems that the genetic make-up of the Labradoodle seems to make it react with "symptoms including mental dullness, mood swings, and disorientation." When this happens, the dogs can and have turned on their owners!    What do you think? Are these dogs dangerous?

20061227162459AAk9m1P	Pets;Dogs	My response to my many answers.?	I have had many responses to my question about shooting a dog with a BB gun. Before I get flooded with anymore uninformed answers let me say this. (1) Building a fence is very costly and beyond my means. (2) My children play outside and are not inside everytime a dog comes into my yard. (3) Unless the dog is too far away I always pump my BB gun only 2to3 times and I always hit them in the back legs. (4) I don't know whose dogs these are and most do not have collars. AND we do not have a dog catcher or a kennel in my county. (5) I am not a cruel person and I have used a water hose as well as other means such as banging trashcan lids to scare them off. - EVERYONE is bouncing around the question without giving a simple answer to a very simple question. There has been a lot of over reaction.  I SIMPLY want to know would a BB shot at close range by a pump action gun (only pumped 2or3 times) could injure a dog such as the BB going thru the skin. Please, no uninformed answers.

We have tried every method in every book we could find.  She absolutely adores hot things and bitter apple.  We have no cabinets it will fit in.  We live in a very open concept log cabin style house and cannot block the door because there isn't one.  We purchased a heavy metal can with a nice lid. No luck.  Noises?  She doesn't even notice them.  She will use a toy of hers to knock a mouse trap off the top.  When we put it temporarily on the counter while we left the room she used a chair to jump onto the counter and knock it off!  I have had dogs my whole life and have never had a problem like this.  She knows enough to make sure nobody is around and is a perfect angel when there is somebody around.  We already have safety locks on the fridge, the cupboard doors, and our doors outside.  If anybody has ideas it would be greatly appreciated!  Other than the garbage she is an extremely well behaved dog and has no problems with obedience.

I have been talking with vets in my city (Kolkata) and it seems that they do not do hip-replacement here. Any good hospital for dogs in India which might do this? In Europe hip replacement has been done since 1970s for dogs ... there has to be something in India!!! The puppy is suffering and we cannot see it like that. We are trying out the other softer alternatives like making it swim to strengthen its muscles without hurting the joints ... and lose weight so it reduces the stress in the joints. But since he is young a hip replacement is a good option to give him a lease of life.

The day after Thanksgiving is the last time she really ate.  She may have picked here and there, but not really eaten.  I took her to the doctor three days after Thanksgiving and he ran tests, no parvo, no parasites.  Gave me antibiotics and sent me on my way, 200.00 later.  By Thursday I was becoming more and more concerned so I took her back to the shelter and they gave me stronger antibiotics.  Two days later, she had blood in her stools.  Since she really hasn't eaten, some of the stools were just blood.  I took her back to the shelter and they said she has the symptoms of distemper and put her down.  I left there, and took her to the vet.  They said she probably has distemper and wanted about 1,500 to keep her in the hospital and give her antibiotics and force feed her for a couple of days. Right now, I have her isolated in a room where I am still giving her the antibiotics and trying to foce

20090205120113AAfPnFi	Pets;Dogs	An Indestructible Harness?	We have an 18 week old puppy who can't wear a collar (he's growing out of them too quickly), but he can wear a harness.       We've bought him two harnesses in the last month and he's eaten through them. He bends his neck down and gets his bottom jaw under the neck harness and chews away until he's free of it.       We've tried bitter barrier, removing it when he doesn't need it (but he usually has to wear it because he's taken on hourly walks), redirecting his attention, corrections, and everything- but nothing works.      Thus- we need to find some type of indestructible harness. Or one that tastes so horrible that he wouldn't think twice about chewing on it.

20081003073525AAKGDeK	Pets;Dogs	Puppy or Ipod what should i get??? HELP READ ALL DETAIL!!!?	Hey      Well I actually want the puppy NOT the ipod i just wrote it so get people to answer my question.    I am NOT one of those kids who just want a puppy because its cute and i just want to pat it.       I want it for alot of reason's and having a dog might be good for me to learn about animals because i am thinking about becoming something with animals and i haven't had a dog before so yeah it is something new.      I am 13 and i was thinking about getting a dog for years but i didn't think i was responsible enough to take care of it.   And now i know  i can.       I go for walks 2 times a day for like an hour so having a dog would be a great  for that.      I would spend most of my time with him, only when i am at school (8.35-3.00) i wouldn't be with him ( but my dad & older sister  will be there to keep it company though out that time )      I have a huge backyard, for the dog.    The vet is just around the corner of my house, and around the other corner is a huge park which is great for dogs.      I have read alot of books about dog's and i have written a list of how much the dog would cost. eg. bed,lead,collar,bowl,food,vet bill's  etc.      So yeah.   I want a German shepherd puppy, i know somebody who is selling some for $350. My older sister would pay for the puppy and i would pay for the bed , lead , collar , toys , bowl , treats etc... ( I have the money )       BUT !!!!!!!!!      The only problem is my MUM doesn't WANT the PUPPY!!!!!!      My dad said i can have it but she says NO!   My mum works during the day so she isn't even home so what is her problem.She probly think im not " responsible enough"      I wash the dishes everyday, help make dinner , bring clothes for the clothes line inside and fold then in the wardrobes. How am i not responsible?? I do WAYYY more things then my older sister does and shes 5 years older then me. She doesn't do nothing around the house.         Ok well what i am wanting to ask you is how can i convince my mum.?   My dad is fine with it he thinks it will be great.      How can i convince her thanksss

20070804193824AAfiTk2	Pets;Dogs	New puppy?? Jealous older dog???	Hi everybody.      I just brought home a new, blue merle pomeranian puppy who is only two months old. I currently have an 11 year old lab named Honey. Honey is "okay" around other dogs...and that's about it. We never considered buying a another dog until one day we found an abandoned yorkie in the back yard that we decided to keep. Unfortunately, we found the yorkie too late and she died shortly after. Anyways, Honey was just fine and didn't seem to mind her. After she died, that's when we decided we'd buy a puppy. The puppy is all about play play play, and sometimes when he messes with Honey too much she'll grunt or growel at him. Honey doesn't like him or hate him...she just tolerates him. I'm really disappointed because I thought everything would work out better. I'm hoping this is just a phase for Honey because she's not used to living with a puppy and when the puppy gets older, she'll get used to him and everything will be okay. what do you think and/or suggest I should do?

20090205105455AAU8tJD	Pets;Dogs	Continuous light shaking?	this is about my moms dog. it's a chihuahua. As far as I know this is not a seizure. My Dachshund has seizures so I know what they look like.    Best way to describe what he is doing is like when you hold up a new born baby and they are trying to hold their heads up, they have that light shake to them. What would this be classified under?    We took him to a emergency vet clinic Sunday they did all kinds of blood work and they said he was fine (physically). It is also important to mention he has had at least 2 seizures. one of those was when he was at the actual emergency clinic.    I told my mother I think he is having some kind of neurological problem. She took him to the vet yesterday and she said they said he might have an inner ear infection. They gave him a shot (of what I don't know) and some ear drops.     Now today he is markedly worse. she is at work but she is going to take him back today.    They (family) said he is not eating as much, this has a red flag going up in my head. I am watching him right now while my mum is at work and I can also say he is lethargic.    has anyone had a dog with similar problems?

20090205120951AARKm0e	Pets;Dogs	Help!  My beautiful cocker has hot spots all the time.  What can I do?	Courtney is 2 1/2 years old.  She keeps getting horrible hot spots.  I take her to the vet.  She gets shots and prednisone pills.  I keep her on Frontline Plus.  Recently, Frontline has not done a good job.  She and the rest of my pets keep getting ticks.  This last time, the tick left a fingertip size hole about 1/16th inch deep.  I discovered the nasty hole when I was giving her a bath.  I'll spare you the gruesome details, but let's just say, it was pretty nasty and infected.  I called the doc again and they put her on more prednisone and cipro antibiotic. I noticed this morning that she has another hot spot coming.  I have fed her quality food since I first brought her home.  Currently she is on the venison and rice formula.      What else can I do for my little girl?  I love her and hate to see her going through this every few days.        I have tried multiple remedies and nothing seems to work from pills, shampoos, creams, etc.  I'm at my wits end.  Help!      Any advice will be greatly appreciated.

20090205121917AA75mUS	Pets;Reptiles	Do Asian Water Monitors brumate?	I was wondering if asian water monitors brumate? If so, how young do they have to be before doing so?     I have a 5 month old salvator, and he rarely comes to bask. The basking spot is 120F, the cool end is about 75F, his cave is under the heat spot, it's at 80F. He has a heat pad under his cage, on medium strength.     He's not eating as much though. I offer food every day, and he eats maybe every other day. He's also into his second shed with me. I think that's why he's not eating much.     His light cycle is 8am - 8pm. The bulb is a Solar Britte 100watt bulb. He's currently in a 55 gallon long. Sand and soil mixture. He has reptile approved plastic plants in his cage. All plant, rocks, cave, and log are secured so they won't fall and hurt him.     Any suggestions? I haven't read anywhere that they do brumate.

20090203025725AAqkPrm	Pets;Other - Pets	Rabbit breeding question - Second Matings and different males?	Everytime i read a page about breeding rabbits, it sais to bring the rabbits back for a second mating a few hours after the first to increase number of babies and higher chances of pregnancy. Well...What would happen if you did that but with a different male the second time? Would she reject him? Or would it work and the babies born would have different fathers?       Im not suggesting im going to ever try this I was just curious. If it did work it would be cool though. If one dad dosen't produce good babies and the other does then maybe half of the litter would be show quality and one not.

On Saturday 31-01-2009, one of my gerbils had 8 pups, quite unexpectedly - I asked for a male and the pet shop and they gave me a female.  I got home Friday to find Oscar (now called Lulu) very very pregnant!      I already had 2 males in the cage with her and when she had the first one, one of the males tried to eat it.  I didn't realise she was giving birth until this point and I took him out straight away.        However, the pup was bleeding and I think it was missing a hind leg.        I presume that the one that tried to eat the pup did so because he wasn't the father.        Anyway, I left the pup in the nest with mom but it died and yesterday which was Monday, she left it out of the nest and covered it with bedding.  What do I do with it?  Should I leave it or take it out?      Thanks in advance.

20090203032636AAXSObz	Pets;Cats	My cats maybe got freaky!?	I got my male cat when he was 4 weeks, and my female when she was 12 weeks.  Both late july (* july 29th and july 31*)  Now it might just all be in my head, because I am pregnant.  These two are like BEST friends, they NEVER leave each other.      My female cat is sorta a brat and always has been, but lately she has been acting like I dont feed her, and needing to sleep in my bed.  Which is weird.  I read up on the possibility of pregnancy but her nipples arent getting bigger (*i dont think*)       He would have turned 5 months old on Dec. 10th and she would have turned 7 months on Dec. 8th.  Is it possible that they could have bred while I was not at home, and I didnt know about it?  He would be the only possible suspect :-).  My other animals here are both male dogs.  They are quite fond of her, but a yorkie or chihuahua breeding w a cat is slightly out of the question      Should I bring her to the vet and see if they think she is pregnant?  Or would it cost me money?  Either way It wouldnt really matter, my Fiancee and I would keep all the kittens, if she were.  And my male will be getting snipped asap.       The only other thing I was thinking is since they have been around each other since babies, maybe they would think they are siblings, or maybe since I am pregnant I am hallucinating. haha      Thankyou!

Both I have kept in a glass tank, 18"(L) x 11"(W) x 18"(H). Almost 60% of the area is dry land made of Rocks and stones. Some green plants, a dead wood and some Dry wood-bark Mushrooms decorate the land. The water is approx 4" deep. I have placed a 100W bulb for heating. Although there is no thermometer but the environment seems quite cozy.       I have one problem which is worrying me. Both the RES & YBS remain underwater all the time and would never come out to bask. They would just poke their nose out of the water and sit whole day and night. They do eat but only dried turtle food pellets. Tried feeding live fish and green veggies, but they wouldn't care.      Is it normal behaviour?   Is there anything wrong with them?   What should I do in case there is something wrong?

Now don't start telling me that I'm cruel because the guinea pig can jump over and get lost, because there's no-where TO get lost. He has access to the garden(if he dares to jump over the bricks), but it only has about 3 skinny trees and is covered in tan bark, so he cant get lost in a jungle of weeds.      He has a covered house type thing that he sleeps in, and 3 quarters of the area is covered by a roof, and he can still have access to a sunny area as well.      Omg my guinea pig is so cute: Hes a rosy guinea pig: Exactly like the Abyssinian one below, but has patches of fur that spreads out like roses.       http://images.google.com.au/imgres?imgur...    Hes fully ginger but with a ring of white fur around his neck that's a 'mane'. So Cute ^_^         Anywho, do you think its right to let your guinea pig live outside? (except in the winter months of course, i'm not cruel.)

And also, can I just leave him or is there something I need to get for him?

20090205133338AAbqzg6	Pets;Rodents	Is it unhealthy for my two boy rats to be so amorous?	I have several rats that are kept together, all boys. One of the boy is named Monty, and we've had him for almost six months (he was about four or five weeks when we got him, making him about seven months old now). He's always gotten along splendidly with our other boys, lots of playing, never fighting. About a month ago, we got a feeder rat from the pet store who was fed only dog food, making him a very fat, squishy rat. We named him Fatty. From the moment Monty saw Fatty, he started humping. I know this is a somewhat normal behavior for rats, but the problem is, he does it constantly, pretty much only stopping to eat or sleep. The other rat doesn't seem to mind and sort of acts like nothing's going on. Could this hurt a rat at all down the line--like could little Monty's hind legs suffer from him being on them so much during the act, or something? I'd appreciate any help. :)

20090205135642AAJVDtP	Pets;Fish	My betta fish has fin rot..So many different treatments.....Any Ideas?	With the help of previous suggestions and research, I am treating my fish Archie (that I bought from a grocery store with deathly sick fish) for fin rot by keeping the 2.5 gal bowl warm, very clean (changed every 3-5 days), and giving him darkness for 10 hours. He gets 4 pellets of food a day and sometimes freeze dried blood worms, and I mix in a conditioner with aged tap water and aquarium salt before I put him in. His color has gotten dull/whitish/grayish (he is usually dark blue/purple) but he seems ok--maybe a little stressed but still exploring and moving around. His fins are not that eaten away yet, either. He has started to spend a little more time at the bottom of the bowl, though. The infection (I am not sure if it is bacterial or fungal, but there is no white stuff so I am thinking that it is bacterial?) has slowed but NOT stopped; which is SO FRUSTRATING! I have been using Betta fix (because that was the only betta medication at the local pet smart- where the fish likewise looked like they were at death's door) and am considering buying Maracyn-2 (minocycline) and Maracyn-TC (tetracycline) and using them together to knock the infection out.       But will I kill the fish with this combo?    He is a nice little guy and I'd like to give him a chance after all that he has been through!

Dear answerer's, to let you know I have read 4 books and have buy-hearted it, I have met 5 vets , and have searched on all the websites about dogs. I have gone and met 15 of my friends who have a dog and guess what! they ask me to train it. My name is Aditya and I live in India. I'm living in an apartment and have been convincing them for 6 years ( and i'm not nagging them at all ). My age is 12 but I know that I can take the responsibility of taking good care of the dog no matter what everyone says. I cannot wait till grow up. And yes I do not force them at all. My father had promised me that he would get a dog in Jan( 2008 ) and has not brought me 1 yet. He also wants a dog but something is forcing him to get it later on or it can be my mother because she hates any kind of animal and does not want a dog to come in the house but she has no problem if it is a big house.

20090203041304AAZXjeZ	Pets;Fish	Lobster cooking--does it hurt them?	okay, this may sound like a stupid question, but please hear me out before you call me an idiot...      I was wondering if lobsters feel any pain when they are boiled alive? My uncle says that while he freezes them first, just in case it hurts them, they shouldn't feel any pain because the water is so hot that it shocks them and they die instantly. There is also apparently no knowledge of their impending death like there is with chickens and other animals. Is this true?      Do crustacea suffer less because they are built with their bones on the outside, so they die quicker?      Yes, these questions may sound silly, but I really do want to know. I won't eat animals if I know they have suffered, but the other day I was served Marron (like a small lobster) which I found out was boiled alive, and I feel horrible and don't want to risk eating any other animals that have suffered.      Please help!   Thanks xx

I ran out of olive oil but what should I add to get rid of it? Person who cuts his nails said to add oil and it would eventually peel off? But, what should I add exactly? Neosporin, veg. oil, dettol??      I'm confident that it's not scaly face...there are no changes in him other than the cere color change and it's clearly extra cere skin growing on top and I can see the shade of original blue on the bottom?

20090205161542AA7InPd	Pets;Rodents	When is it TOO early to get a new hamster?	I posted a question asking about how my hamster died yesterday. I was talking to some of my best friends that all have experience with hamsters and they said that i should get a new one. They told me that after school tomorrow we'd go pick one out. I said okay. My hamster died yesterday.. is it TOO early to get a new one? Also, how do i properly sanatize the entire cage and all my other hamster toys like his wheel and ball? Can i just add like a couple of tblsp of bleach to a tub full of water and let it soak for a while? This is the first time i had a hamster, so the first time i had one die. (Please don't lecture  me about how i didnt know enough to take care of the first one, because i did. My dad made me study hamsters for an entire year before he even THOUGHT about letting me get one. I also have manuels about hamsters. And Hey, we were all first time hamster owners at one point, werent we?)
