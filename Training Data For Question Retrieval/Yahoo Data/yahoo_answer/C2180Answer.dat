lFC2mqCcaa	Seriously did they not tell you at the begining of the game that you cant win with just one strong pokemon.....um did someone not listen...anyway.  Keep infernape in the PC and go out and level up the others to the levels 50-60.  Elite four use pokemon up to level 60 so thats why you need your pokemon up that high...plus the last person has WATER pokemon....um for some reason i forsee a problem if you go right now.  I would recomend either leveling up alot or use the GTS which always has somme good pokemon on it.    Hope this helped, just level up and you will do GREAT!|`|vtGlSJfCaa	level up prinpulp,luminum and palkia a little higher|`|Xcd8ZGu3aa	Infernape 86?! lmfaoo  yea as others said, level up prinplup, he's quite useful cuz of his high defense (once he's evolved of coursE)|`|RQ9xB0i8aa	Yeah, it's a good team. But you just have to level up all of them to at least level 55, then you'll be all set.|`|S8OtM9S2aa	you have some leveling up to do. good choices on pokemon though.
wpLgoBOsaa	DotA is not a video game.|`|AA12108038	u need to up your counter helix first and take ulti when u can. the best build is  helix, call, helix. call, helix, ulti , helix, call , call and then hunger    however if ur opponent is not very good at last hitting and denying make the most of hunger by taking just 1 lvl of call early game.    axe is a ganker and not really a 1v1 hero but u can try this build    vanguard, phase boots, radiance heart/ cuirass    most 5v5 games ull have to buy a dagger but its not that needed in a 1v1    fite ur enemy when his creeps are near so u spin more and thereby damaging ur opponent more have fun

a7a7a0bfe671ddedd1999ac93097444caa	Other than Testors is enamel and Tamiya is Acrylic... virtually no other difference.  The color chips on the website for Tamiya shows it MUCH greener than it actually comes out of the can.    http://www.tamiyausa.com/product/item.ph...  http://www.testors.com/products/136194    I am NOT a fan of acrylics (just my opinion), but I DO have a can of the Tamiya so I can mask of certain panels on my Navy birds and spray them with the Tamiya as a contrast.    Certain panels on Navy aircraft are FREQUENTLY pulled and abused during maintenance, and CAN be painted.  There WILL be minor color variations from batch to batch of paint, and this is a good way to reflect the differences.    FYI, you asked earlier WHERE people store or display their 1/32 scale birds... Mine sat on my coffee-table for a year, and then went to a local recruiters office.  I've donated 2 F-14A's, 1 F/A-18C, and one SH-60-B (actually 1/35).  Sitting there NOW is my second SH-60B "Oceanlord 22"  I modify ALL my Navy birds so they're in the FOLDED configuration.|`|suLTN10laa	The Tamiya is slightly darker and a touch "greener"  The difference is slight.|`|xsPTpzAYaa	they r almost the same

If you're going for the latest titles then you should go for Fable 2. i'm playing it right now and i'm pretty much addicted to it and i never thought of myself to be an RPG gamer. Gears of War 2 is also a fantastic title. (Horde mode!!) and Left 4 Dead.    for titles that have been out before then you should try Command and Conquer Tiberium Wars and Red Alert 3. Also you should give Unreal Tournament 3 a try. it totally awesome.

5wufIH1Haa	You could make a banner like the students who make their first communion make. Cut out felt in the shape of a shield and let him make his own coat of arms to hang in the window with "100" standing out. You don't even have to cut out the shapes but you could buy foam shapes, glitter, puffy paint, pipe cleaners, basically anything. It would help get you ready for the First Holy Communion. And just let him do whatever he wants on the felt. I am sure he would love using different supplies.|`|5Gxgp0IWaa	You can check out this web site http://familyfun.go.com/  They have some cute and easy crafts.Maybe you can get some ideas and inspiration.

It's basically just "combining" . . . combining only 2 things would be the simplest.    So you'd combine the number 100 with "something else" in some way.     That something else could be:  ...something that has to do with your son (his favorite toys--maybe Legos or , TV shows, activities, sports, pets, family, colors, etc.)   ...something that has to do with the school or learning (name of school, teacher, or classroom, classmates, pencils or art supplies, etc.)  ...something else you or he choose for no special reason (a color scheme, outdoor theme, toys of all kinds, winter/spring/Halloween, a movie, foods, a particular material like string/yarn/aluminum foil/nails-screws-nuts/rocks/"found objects"/dried noodles/*whatever*)    The "ways" you could combine those 2 things could be all kinds of ways too... making the 100 from them (like glueing together perhaps), putting both on a backboard of some kind, putting them all into something else, hanging or stringing, etc, etc.    HTH, and you may also want to read around on this page at my site for other people's comments about their experiences with "creativity and inspiration," how it happens, and what they do when it's not happening:  http://glassattic.com/polymer/creativity...  ...click on CREATIVITY & INSPIRATION      Diane B.|`|PXWVGQyAaa	Here is a link for you with lots of ideas.|`|suLTN10laa	Ok, here's what I would do...  Give your child a piece of tracing paper to water color on how ever he wants.   You fold 3 sheets of construction paper each in half, trace a number 1 on the first and a 0 on the other two.  Cut them out then cut the middle out so that you have two of each number that looks like an out line.  Take your son's tracing paper and glue it between the two like numbers and trim the excess, so that it looks like stained glass!  Then hole punch and attach with yarn vertically.  (have him help glue, punch and tie knots)  If you think you can not draw good numbers, print one to use as a template from your computer font size 80(-ish)|`|3149d8c79c2c2fd573c8fb1acb44e350aa	http://www.dltk-kids.com/  I am a teacher's assistant and this is  one of my favorite web sites.

When you have a chance take it. if you have the bomb for an example. use it rather than shoot enemies because the bomb will get you 3 points. if you have the chance sneak and use knife attack because it will able you to steal your enemies point.

If you don't have a folder called Downloads, create one but remember the capital D, that is important.    I suggest that you arrange your downloads either by type (clothes, hacks ect) or creator. That way if you have a problem you can easily find which is the problem.    Once you do this it should show up.
MKZyKVWLaa	I'd say it's pretty likely that the new car came with the equivalent parts, and thus you wouldn't need to buy them as they wouldn't be an upgrade. That's how it was in NFS: Most Wanted, anyways. When you unlock the next set of upgrades, you should be able to purchase those.

fAPnuzg3aa	On COD4 the prestige mode is little more than getting a different symbol in recognition of moving through the ranks. It does allow you to earn more points because all of your 'challenges' are reset and you can earn more points by doing them over again. A big drawback to prestige is that you lose all of your earned guns and perks. You have to start over as if you are a level 1. Since the game has been out for a while I don't think being number 1 in the leader boards for points is possible, so it really comes down to a new icon. In COD: World at War, prestige mode earns you another customized set up slot, which can be useful.    To get gold guns you have to complete the marksmanship challenges for each type of weapon. For example: If you complete all challenges for the assault rifle class, then you will receive a gold AK-47. Each class of weapon has a different golden gun. If you prestige however, all of your challenges are reset, therefore you have to start these gun challenges over as well. If you want a gold gun, I suggest that you do not prestige otherwise you will have to reach the 10th prestige to earn the gold guns.

But the thing is, in the process you will have to let go of all your guns and challenges and start all over. You can do this 10 times. It's nothing more than a brag and to make the game lenghty. I did this one time and not planning to do it again. Here is a link to the icons you get: http://happyboredom.com/home/files/COD4p...    In order to get the gold guns you have to max. out the guns in that class in the challenges. Which means to get 150 kills and the right amount of headshots also.|`|ocjRl7Mcaa	you usally get golden guns when you complete all of the challenges for a series of weapons. like youll get a golden shotgun when you complete all of the challenges for both shot guns. and prestige mode sends you all the way back to level 1 and you don't really get that much, im not to sure i htought the idea was stupid|`|jr4aNLLlaa	you have to complete all of the challenges for the gun,i think im not that sure i haven't played in a long time|`|uekDJ3gqaa	You need to get 150 head shots with every gun in its class.

With this device, you can download ALL and EVERY SINGLE Nintendo DS games on the web (for free), and load it on your Nintendo DS. This unit even cost less than the price of single game. Its call the R4 DS card. I have over 3000+ Nintendo DS games on my computer now and I have trouble playing them all indeed. Definitely worth the money.    Check out the following for further details about it. To be honest, its just so amazing!  http://aephou.notlong.com

oIz9HYaraa	After accepting the mission, head to the Metalworks.    Look for Cid in Cid's Lab.    - Cid will give you Blue Acidity Tester that you need to use to test the waters of Dangruf Wadi.     Visit the Dangruf Wadi area, located in the southwestern corner of South Gustaberg.    Head to the geyser located at (I-8) and stand in it until it propels you to the ledge above. There are Goblins in this area that may aggro while waiting for the geyser.    Check your key items to make sure the Blue Acidity Tester has changed to a Red Acidity Tester.    Once it has turned red, return back to Cid to complete the mission.|`|0412100dc3df1a3e6f5380848485a277aa	http://wiki.ffxiclopedia.org/wiki/A_Geol...

Once that time is gone you can never, ever get it back.|`|X4uQ75P7aa	I would love to have that ship map there cause i always go on a sniping roll there.|`|ZsnelFnkaa	yeah im sure they will have one or to from Cod4.

Crash would be another good map, i want that in there 2|`|MX7eJqfFaa	really anything besides wetwork|`|E48JPEkMaa	ship map sucked.  all time best map would be Showdown you can snipe from top levels or run and gun around the hole map. (i suggest M21 or Dragonuv for sniping, and AK47 or G36C all with stopping power)
Rc1351g4aa	you might have the wrong type if not it should appear as usb device on the menuit will be the top one above music above video and above pictures if it still dosnt work try all of the slots if still dosnt work your drive is not compatible but if you no it is compatible it could be the ps3
kGWD8Uafaa	I would suggest not using cheats for gold as they have messed up my save data, but if you want to read the instruction manual.  An english version of crystal can even be obtained at a pawn shop but you could get it at a close Gamestop, if it is a main branch, smaller branches send their color games into the main stores.
itabVvIMaa	Just go to Twilly and select Go to Trainers or something and you can train any stat.|`|kGWD8Uafaa	Yes but you must be high lvl, almost the top.|`|ZsnelFnkaa	no
6N3yjlXhaa	Edit:  Now that we know the actual model is not the same as the "28", check your local dealers (some service all brands) and Sears for quotes on service fees.    ***********  Double check your manual.    According to this site - http://pages.sewing-machine-manuals.com/... - the Kenmore 28 is a straight stitch only machine.|`|fvre0o9laa	My first thought is that you've got a dirty machine or one in need of oil.  You may also have a jammed or broken cam if this is a mechanical machine.    Or you may have accidentally hit a "double needle switch" that limits the machine to straight or very narrow zigzag stitching when a double needle is being used... some machines of that era had them.  Or... or... or....    Wny not give it as good a cleaning and oiling as you can yourself, if you're in the cash conservation mode?  Pull the bobbin case and needle plate, use a brush and vacuum, do all the oiling recommended in the manual. If it still doesn't work properly, then take it in for an estimate.    Everyone else is right... a good professional cleaning might just fix it, or it may need more attention than that.  But if you're like me, you've got a project you want to finish NOW, and a hour spent cleaning at home may allow you to get this project done now before taking it in for a pro.    (Why yes, I'm currently using a 1951 Singer 15 while my main machine is in the shop for a routine COA.  But you didn't expect me to not sew this week??? )|`|PXWVGQyAaa	Check to see if you have it on a buttonhole setting .  Here is a link for you to check.|`|BhFeii5Xaa	Ryan's suggestion first to check the stitch width and length, then!!    It costs about $50 to $75 for complete cleaning and adjusting at a good sewing machine shop. It might be just a matter of the old oil congealed and won't allow it to work.    It is well worth the cost of even $150 to have these cleaned, oiled and adjusted at a good shop every year or so! Even backup machines need annual physical exam!|`|AA12227836	The timing is out.
AQibk7sHaa	No, because they have reconfigured the nds software so when you use the r4 it wont recognize it. i would recommend  waitig till someone has made one that is compatible with the new software. hope that helps! ^ ^|`|xPeIvywdaa	yes it will    the dsi is basically just a ds with a camara lol    ill probably get it anyway, it looks cool|`|E48JPEkMaa	just looked it up and i have to say that nintendo is the most retarded company ever. the DS was awesome its the only reason that nintendo is anygood because the wii sucks ballz. now theyre taking away the GBA slot? im sorry but nintendo has just lost a customer. if anything, im sticking with my DS Lite

1MeMsVYeaa	Harvest Moon DS Cheats    Unlockable GBA Cast  This game can import characters from the GBA Harvest Moon Friends of Mineral Town and More Friends of Mineral Town. Be sure to boot the DS game with the GBA game carts (one at a time) inserted in the DS' GameBoy slot.      Unlock Casino  To unlock the CTo unlock the Casino you must rescue the following sprites:    Roller - On 8 Spring, walk towards Vesta's farm, crossing the bridge who runs the Medal Exchange.    And any one of the following:    Press A in front of the well next to the Blue Bar for Hops who runs the Poker Table.    Press A in front of the stove to the left of the Inner Inn for Tep, who runs the Blackjack Table.    Press A in front of the fountain in Romana's Courtyard for Jum, who runs the Memory Game Table.    If you find all three, you can play all three games, but finding just one of the games will open the casino (albeit a sad looking one).        Hint - Money Making Scheme For Upstarts  Early on, you can use a really "quick" way of making money that does not take much energy or in-game time (although it may take quite a bit of real time). Just enter the Excavation Site and before you do anything further, save your game inside.    Proceed to dig for jewelry but do not save your game again. Instead, simply note the map cells where you found the jewelry by digging up the whole place. Go reload your last save and go directly to the spots where you found the jewelry pieces before and dig only those squares. Save your new found riches, and reset the Excavation Site by exitting and re-entering the map.    You can loop the exploit -- the interred jewelry will randomized upon entry to the Excavation Site (note leaving a mine and then going back won't do; you need to exit completely to the 'outside'). You can repeat this as long as you want (or as long as your dude's energy holds out). While not helpful when other avenues of revenue are available, you will find this quite helpful early on in starting up your place.        Unlock The Shopping Network  Unlock the Shopping Network by ordering items for 10 days from Karen's Supermarket. Doing this will rescue the Sprite who controls the Channel.        Clear All Monsters On Mine Floor  This is a simple way to clear ALL monsters that are on the floor you are currently on. You merely need to save your game once inside the floor you wish cleared, then proceed to shut your DS off. Turn it back on and load your save game, and voila! All of the monsters on that floor have been defeated and you can continue to mine without any pests. Of course on the next floor you proceed to there will be another new set of monsters, but you may repeat the process if you want.          When you first reach any floor of the Mine, if you did not go too far (in falling), save your game immediately. Defeat all the Dark Creatures and save again. Now, smash all rocks and uncover all squares with your hoe to find special items, but DO NOT SAVE.    When you find any special item, reload your game without saving and go directly to the location of the special item and collect it. Now save your game. Do this again and again until all special items on the floor are found.    WARNING: Always save your game on any floor of the mine before you move at all, as you may fall through a hole in the floor and go too far. Do not walk in the mine if your energy level is at zero. If you fall through a hole, you will pass out as soon as you reach the next floor. It's another reason to save your game immediately.        Hint - Weather Control  You can cheat the weather in this game in the same way as you do in FoMT/MFoMT. Simply save your game before you go to bed. When you awaken in the morning, watch the Weather Channel immediately.    If a hurricane or snowstorm is predicted for the next day, reload without saving. It is useful always to save your game before you go to bed at night. Although most Events will occur on sunny days, there are a few that actually require rain. You can control the weather here as in other Harvest Moon games by reloading until you obtain the result you desire.        Verified by Freyashawk  Hint - Brush Bonus  Have the rucksack open on the bottom screen. Not only have the brush and glove equipped, but the slot in your rucksack immediately next to the equipped tool space should be either the milker or the shears. When you have a sheep ready to be shorn or a cow ready to be milked, wash with the brush and touch glove BEFORE milking or shearing, and before petting.    Now wash your animal. When done, use your STYLUS to hit the BACK key. With your stylus, quickly move the milker or shears to the equipped spot. 7 out of 10 times I have done this, there is now either wool or milk in my hands, and then I have still been allowed to shear my sheep or milk my cow and get double product from the animal for that day.

X11j9qe5aa	Hmm I haven't play that is a long time. I remember that you have to buy them at a small market that will appear in your town. The market is a small tent. I remember that a fox sell it.

Unfortunately, once you beat it there is not much left to do.  All that is different is you become a glowing once you beat the game|`|2SYrVb3faa	I got it for Christmas, and I enjoyed it.  It only takes about 10 hours to beat, but using the force powers is a blast.  Plus once you beat it, you can go through again with all the upgrades to your force powers.  Oh, and in the first level you get to be Darth Vader.  Who doesn't like using the choke move?

Phone Microsoft and ask if you can get ya 360 fixed :)|`|3rgJpqjZaa	http://support.xbox.com/support/en/us/xb...|`|kGWD8Uafaa	Check the connection cable, if nothing is wrong there call the company, if they cannot tell you how to fix it they will replace the xbox if it is within the warranty.
RTzJhnBSaa	I'm also a pretty big fan of MGS. Mostly the solid series though.    Someone said earlier that they'd make one, but without Snake, so I'm pretty sure that's the right answer. However, I don't think it'll be called Metal Gear Solid anymore, since it seems slightly pointless to call the series "Solid" without "Solid" Snake.    So, in other words, the Metal Gear SOLID series is dead. However, the mainstream games and characters can still be used. Just not Snake. That is, IF Konami goes through with their plans of not using Solid Snake anymore.    Basically, it's not gonna be called Metal Gear Solid anymore, so don't expect the words Metal Gear Solid 5.|`|d889ec36bb9adc89f3addb3dde100e23aa	Kojima said there will  be a MGS5, but Snake will not be involved (obviously) and that Kojima will probably  not be directing it|`|WQk0Xps3aa	They are still thinking about it.      NOT! Of course they are going to make another one because it is so popular.
d5928aef823e729cbef56cb2408fdda4aa	Don't do it. Modding your system not only voids the warranty but is also traceable when playing on LIVE. If Microsoft finds you are playing online with a Modded system they will kick you off of LIVE.      It's really not worth it anyway. Many modded games don't transfer fully and you don't get the full experience. Just leave it alone dude and pay full price for the games or wait for them to get cheaper.|`|aXbSpXhCaa	U WILL NOT BUY GAMES FROM A FREIND cuz il stop u|`|CEchFOhqaa	Do not void your xbox's warrenty. These things break all the time and while cheap games might be cool, its not worth having to buy a brand new xbox because yours got the red rings and microsoft wont fix it|`|X4Dhx4uCaa	I would flash it. Then do what you want to.|`|dnJrOj96aa	wha?

fcOZ7BpGaa	You can hire up to three men in your crew.  You can hire lots of men and assign them different weapons, ranks, and skills.  But you can only bring three with you at a time.  So depending on the mission you assign different men to come with you.  You can also hire guards too! :P|`|d5928aef823e729cbef56cb2408fdda4aa	Nobody knows- it has not been released yet.

(which is a lot of fun)...plus the pc will give you a wide coverage of games...MMORPG, RTS, FPS, and many more!|`|goe3y4FPaa	i heard the dell xp or xs whatever it is.. was designed for gamers|`|9QyU1Tcjaa	i prefer a), but if u want to play games choose b).For consoles buy xbox 360 or ps3.Xbox 360 games are cheaper and almost same as on ps3.But ps3 can be online so u can download games for random prices on ps3 online store.If i'm on your place i would choose xbox 360|`|NmBUnDoraa	i would get a game console like xbox360 because of its cheap online play|`|7df12b17b4fd8d3c75162c6bd0fd4d22aa	Well if you looking for first person shooters you should choose a pc because its more of  a challenge plus theres leagues but if you want games that are fun and easier to play  you should get and xbox 360 and get live because its just like the computer and you can play withf riends
N82omPDdaa	I cant tell you how many times I've tried that strategy and it failed. I usually just shoot bomb arrows at their feet to knock off their armor. Once you get one of them de-armored, kill that one (since it moves faster than the others it will be easier to get it away from the group). use this strategy on the rest of them.     Tip: make sure you bring some fairies and blue potions with you|`|dnJrOj96aa	tactics soldier|`|tkSll6Gtaa	i beat it 6 times and forgot
4oEuCkjPaa	If you jailbreak it you can. There is also an app called stanza in the app store which has some stories.|`|dq993QC7aa	You can, but your iTouch should be jaibroken, than you can put E-Books on it. There may be other ways, but this is how I do it.    Heres what you need to do :    1. Get a jailbroken iPhone/iTouch. There are many ways to jailbreak your iPhone/iTouch. Please be aware that this may break (brick) your phone and void your warranty. That said, I used ZiPhone to jailbreak my iPhone and it was quite painless process.    2. Once your iPhone is jailbroken, you should have a new icon on your iPhone called Installer. This is installer.app, a fantastic tool to browse, download, install and manage third party applications on your iPhone.    3. Using Installer, find and install Books.app. This is an ebook reader for the iPhone. Theres a Books category in Installer so you can immediately install some ebooks to read.    Now, that wasnt so difficult, right? So how do we get more ebooks on the iPhone? This is the not-so-simple part. There are a few ways to do it (using SCP, iPhuc, etc), however they all require quite a bit of technical ability. I found a simpler way to do it, and it involves manybooks.net.    Manybooks.net is a huge repository of publicly available ebooks in a variety of formats (PDF, Mobipocket, Palm Doc, HTML, etc). It also has a mobile version which works well with the iPhone.  * Go to manybooks.net and create and account. This is free.  * Create a bookshelf. You can browse the manybooks.net site and add ebooks to your bookshelf.  * Open Installer.app on your iPhone  * Tap the Sources tab at the bottom of the screen  * Tap Edit then Add and enter the URL for your new shelf - something like http://manybooks.net/shelf/38  * Tap Done  * Switch to the Install tab and select the ManyBooks category to see your selections.    This is where I faced a few issues. After installing a book, Installer.app would give an error message. However, when I open Books.app, the ebook was indeed successfully installed.    Hopefully, once we have the iPhone App Store in place, we will have an easier way to browse, purchase, download and read ebooks on the iPhone. In the meantime, Im quite happy with this method.

They currently have 4 released games and one beta. Mabinogi to me is very good graphics, with no class system letting you customize skills. Combat is real time, with monsters having high AI, meaning you can't click repeatedly and hope to get somewhere. Also they have many life skills, including weaving, tailoring, fishing, blacksmithing, cooking, and others. NOT LIKE RUNESCAPE though. You need to actually have some skill to do these.     For buying NX, (No monthly service) you can get pets, and buy items like gachapons, dyes for clothes(Sell for alot), and others from the cash shop. If you buy one of the 3 monthly services ($9.50 for one, $14.50 for all three) you can do mainstream quests which bring out the storyline of the game. Currently G1 is free although skippable.     Overall, it's a good game, but can get boring when you run out of quests. But you never grind hard in this game, because you need so much more to progress in the game.     For Swordfighting and Ship battling, I believes Tales of Pirates online has all of that.|`|7Ca2ns47aa	Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion for the "sword fighting"|`|JR3Ol1VGaa	the new version of Sid Meir's Pirates probably fits the bill.    You get to be a pirate in the Carribean. Ship battles and sword fights galore. It's a fun game with some good strategy elements and fairly decent, if a little cartoonish graphics.    It's based on a very old game (which was also a lot of fun) that was one of the classics of early PC gaming.    Pirates of the Burning Sea is a MMORPG (like World of Warcraft) about pirates. It supposed to be Ok....but you have to be in the mood (and money) for an MMO......which you may not be. But Ok graphics.|`|dnJrOj96aa	halo 2 get it|`|6OgkoKB7aa	well if you want sword fighting game then you should try the devil may cry3 or legacy of Cain:defiance or god of war.if you are sword fighting game lover you would love these games too|`|TqdEEJJFaa	zOMGGGGGGGGGGGGG!!!!! get World of Warcraft i promise you it will be life changing.

6000349dbd0a8f8b344256f6899b5461aa	I've had mine for over a year now, and it's fine. The battery life isn't as long, and sometimes my screen freezes but it might have something to do with how many times the Kindle has been x-rayed in the airport security. I travel a lot & the Kindle always goes with me, which means it also goes through x-ray machines.      I dropped my Kindle about half a dozen times. And it was sort-of squished by my 17-inch laptop when my carry-on luggage fell from the overhead bin.    So far, mine sustained a small crack in the top left corner. But that is when it fell on a hardwood floor. The other times it fell on carpet, about 2 1/2 feet.    Also, you should know that Kindle Support is great. Even if it is your fault, they'll replace your Kindle for a minimal fee.|`|6UmjlJHTaa	what the!

7Ca2ns47aa	Safe in what way?     Safe from "innocent" children? Depends on how strict your parents are on that. There's obviously "sex" in the game, which if the 3rd one is anything like the others, they probably came up with their own word for it, like "Play" or "Woo-Hoo."    ...Or safe as in glitches and such? Perhaps, but even if it's not, that's why there's updates.|`|d5928aef823e729cbef56cb2408fdda4aa	What do you mean safe? Just go to GameStop and pay the $5 to reserve a copy.

QsQj8jO7aa	A game company will develop games that are in demand in the market place. If they are making "too many" 1st person shooter games it is because that is what people are looking for, there are "too many" people wanting to shoot things up.     These companies won't invest money in games that aren't going to have an audience...in my opinion though, there will always be an audience for rpg style games....so it just may be you having a hard time finding these games, look harder.     If that doesn't help at all write them a letter telling them you want more diversity in your video gaming experience and you want different types of games...they will promptly respond with "go buy a wii".     What Im saying is that you are at the mercy of the market place go with a system that consistently develops games in your prefered style, whether they be rpg, 1st person shooters, racing, etc...|`|972OdSIJaa	left 4 dead  street fighter (this month)  resident evil 5 (this month)|`|6e2191f96a837588ddf197c3f002bc49aa	Get a PS3.

There are a fair few out there, and I do see what you mean about FPS's, a lot of things are 3rd person shooters aswell (Like Gears of War 1+2... well everything lol).

I think that one of the problems with 2007 and 2008 was that the Wii had the stranglehold on non FPS shooters (i.e. platformers), Xbox and PS3 rather than compete with this decided to show what their machines could do by creating super realistic first person shooters.    I personally like FPS, however at times you don't want to laugh for 20mins about getting another head shot....  Hopefully now that games companies are starting to listen to the general public and understand its quality not just looks which make goods games, a decline of FPS will be begin and games with decent life spans which don't involve "tea bagging" the oppenent will be on the uprise.|`|4QSsJ23Caa	Oh my god you need to get a ps3.

So, here are a few suggestions:    Fallout 3 - Rated "M" (has FPS elements, but plays like an RPG)  Mass Effect - Rated "M" (RPG)  Resident Evil 5 - Rated "M" - March 13 release. (Survival Horror)    If you're looking for something with toned down violence and/or simplistic gameplay but doesn't skimp on the fun-factor you should check out either Lego Star Wars: The Complete Saga or Lego Indiana Jones. I haven't played Lego Batman, so I can't personally recommend that game.    Or, if you're a fan of The Simpsons, RENT that game. It'll make for a fun weekend!
J3kfQtViaa	It's an error, for some reason it shows you to be in versus mode when it really isnt.  Either that or it was in versus mode but everyone joined the human team, therefore it goes back to normal mode.  I think its an error though. Ive seen it happen a couple of times.
vtJDHJDYaa	After the cutscene, enter the door to the Lift Stop. Head first to the red crystal to turn it blue. Return to the blue crystal to head up. Use Gravira on the chest platform here to receive an ORICHALCUM. Now head back down. Turn the other crystal back to red again, and ride the platform down this time. Head into the Waterway. There are two platforms you can take from here. Take the one to the right to get to the Lift Stop area again. The red crystal here shoots out MP Balls and a MYTHRIL when you examine it. Head back down and take the other platform to the Dungeon area. You've been here before, remember? Use the BLUE TRINITY MARK (16/17) nearby to get a MEGA-POTION, a MEGA-ETHER, and a COTTAGE, as well as HP Balls.    Now head back up to the Waterway, and head through the door back to the Lift Stop area. Ride the platform back up, and exit the area past the red crystal to reach the Castle Gates. Be incredibly careful when fighting in this area, as you don't want to fall off back into the Waterway area again. Wait for the Wyverns to come to you before attacking them. Head around the corner and activate the red crystal. Wait for the newly activated platform to come by, and use it to cross the gap to another chest. Use Gravira to bring it down, and open it for DALMATIANS 94, 95, and 96. Hop on the moving platform again, and ride it all the way back to the opposite end of its track. Glide to the other floating platform from here, and ride this one to a chest on a pillar. It contains a HOLY-G. Glide to the chest in the distance on a pillar to get an ORICHALCUM. Simply gliding to the chests themselves works too...     Now head back to the main platform, and use the blue crystal to ride to a new area. Continue up the steps to reach another red crystal. Use this to enter the large platform nearby. When it stops moving, fight the enemies and use the crystal to get it started again. Use the nearby BLUE TRINITY MARK (17/17) to get MP Balls, a MEGALIXIR, and two COTTAGES. You should have used all the trinities now  except for the white ones. Check your journal in case you are missing any, and try to find them later on. The nearby chest contains a   DISPEL-G. Head through the door into the Lift Stop.    Use the blue crystal in here to reach a higher platform. Exit to the Great Crest area. To the left is a chest with an ORICHALCUM. To the right is a blue crystal which you can use to reach another area. After the enemies out here are defeated, use Gravira on the chest to lower it and obtain a THUNDAGA RING. Head over to where the blue crystal is, but jump off the ledge and turn right to glide along the wall. There is an opening to the right as you glide under the giant yellow blocks. Enter the door here. Using Gravira on the platform here gets you a FLOAT-G. Was it worth it? I dunno, probably not. Anyway, exit this area back out to the High Tower area. From here, glide to the left towards the blue line. You will automatically land on the platform below next to the blue crystal. Use it to return to the area you were just at.    Use the red crystal in the corner to make the block lower itself. Turn around and enter the nearby doorway to the Lift Stop. Head through the other doorway to the High Tower area again. After defeating the enemies out here, use Gravira on the chest to get DALMATIANS 97, 98, and 99. Only three more to go! Examining the red crystal lowers the other block. Head up and Use the yellow crystal to raise the other block back up. Now you can reach the MEGALIXIR on the ledge. Use the red crystal to trigger a change in the platform way back in the secret room of the Library. Go back down the yellow blocks, and enter the Lift Stop. Head into the Castle Chapel area.|`|PTovC2Dqaa	To get the treasure chests floating in the air, you have to Target Lock the treasure chests and use a Gravity spell to make it descend down.

Examine the crystal console to be taken to a small, magically sealed chamber. There's a treasure chest on a floating platform above you containing an Ultima-G. You can bring the platform down by casting Gravity. Use the crystal console to return to the area below. Continue back to the library, and enter the door on the second level of the library. You now need to complete a series of tests.    If you need more I got this off of : http://www.gamefaqs.com/console/ps2/file...

I know BIG disapointment, i can't wait till it comes out!|`|FQdE11IBaa	No, sadly the new date is the 5th of June :-(  This is because bugs need to be "ironed out" and EA games want to release on all platforms all at once :-/|`|zGjrKTHhaa	I'm not sure but the best place to check is ign.com, they always have release dates for major games
JxCtNXn3aa	For the PS3, PC, 360 and Wii:  Black Cat   Black Widow   Electro   Kingpin   Luke Cage   Mary Jane Watson   Moon Knight   Rhino   Spider-Man   Terrible Tinkerer   Venom   Vulture   Wolverine    For PS2, PSP and Nintendo DS:  A.I.M.   Aunt May   Big Wheel   Chtylok   Galactus   Green Goblin   Hobgoblin   Hypno-Hustler   J. Jonah Jameson   Jackal   Kraven the Hunter   Mysterio   Nick Fury   Nightcrawler   Professor X   Sandman   Shocker   Spencer Smythe   Spider-Woman   Stilt-Man   Storm   Wolverine    So if you want one with more characters go for the PS2, PSP and Nintendo DS versions but the PS2 and PSP ones are poorly made.  I'd definitely go for the PS3/360/PC/Wii versions because the graphics are much better and you'd have less characters for a more understandable story!
u8Km1J3Gaa	I haven't done this for a long time but I think this is the way.    Load up Sims 2  Locate house you want to upload from the neighbourhood screen  On the info window that pops up there should be an arrow on another shape that I am finding difficult to describe.  Click on that shape (it will be the only one with an arrow on it)  Then it will ask you to package to your computer (puts it in your sims 2 folder in My Documents) or to the website.  Follow on screen instructions.    If you are still having problems there may be a story on the exchange on www.thesims2.ea.com that will show you with pictures.
I1J7nNFbaa	Yes. Many sites are already getting ready for it. The Sims Resource and Mod The Sims have already made pages for The Sims 3. There will probably be hundreds more once it comes out, so you can look forward to having custom content for it.|`|IcEQcIWbaa	After its initial release,there will be probably a lot of them!  I assure u.A game like the sims 3,there can't be any mod site to download custom content.    Hope so as the sims 2 did!  Peace!|`|eq4fZWYgaa	so do i. i loveeeee Sims. :] .. probably it would have a mod site.

aeApup5oaa	I ran a 4-3 defense and blitzed quite a lot. I kept my corners up close on the receivers. It completely shuts down the run, the only real hole in the defense is you are vulnerable to deep passes if you don't have a good safety. But using The Ohio State University your offence should keep you in the game with Wells and Pryor, and that D should make it hard for people to walk all of you.|`|FWRcz5VGaa	4-3 def 2 man deep or you can mix it up|`|TaX9wy5Yaa	run the 3-4 defense. that stops the run and pass. trust me it works.

P4f7asdvaa	Get your hunter to 80 so you can start running dailies; they're the fastest way to earn gold aside from farming.  As for professions, go with mining and either: jewelry crafting for gems, skinning, herb, enchanting for disenchant items, or glyphs.  Remember to save up your cloth as well and sell it in the AH; selling green and up trash loot is a good idea as well.|`|7H9q5P5Paa	Mining and Skinning are excellent source of income.    I suggest continuing to quest on your hunter to 80.  Farming becomes so much easier at a higher level.    Happy gaming!|`|Wuo6qYQMaa	download Shaiya    its a fre 3D MMORPG game, like WOW only better    its all free, and awesome!    there are humans    fighter - powerful attacks  defender - MASSIVE health and can take a lot of damage  priest - can heal himself and allies and attack as normal    and elves    archer - uses long distance magic arrow attacks  ranger - goes on his own (not in party) and can turn invisible, sprint,              turn into the darkies (affectionate name for the enemy) and               turn into animals  mage - mages can use earth wind and fire attacks to cause severe              damage from around 24metres away from the enemy, these              can attack singular or an area of creatures      darkies (dark side)    warrior - like the fighter  guardian - like the defender  oracle - like priest  pagan - like mage  assassin - like ranger  hunter - like archer      you can PvE with your side alone, or you can PvP on maps wit other players on both Alliance of Light, and Union of Fury      i seriously suggest checking it out, its set out, and the controls are pretty much the same as WOW, only the magi cattacks are so much better    youtube it and just see it    it is 100% free, although you CAN choose to buy items with real money, that give you advantages, mainly in PvP|`|JZVsrKWgaa	Dude just get your hunter to lvl 80 and geared then once you can't really do anything much more make you a death knight and gather some herbs and mine you will make loads of gold and mabey afford that new mount you been wanting although you really don't think its worth it. what else you really need gold for, other then those beautiful sockets right.

JZVsrKWgaa	Well for me it would be basic squad commands up to the breach and clear. Also maybe a new cool thing like picking a kit and playing its story line such as if you were a medic or a light machine gunner you know. Yes more vehicle action and a lot more blood detail as well as limps flying, lets face it if we are playing a war game its not just to shoot at terrorist its to see their arms and legs go the other direction of their face. So thats my thought.|`|UyYvkmlPaa	better stop the juggernaut noobs  better guns  no glitches|`|DTlFaJkaaa	a game that actually f'n works for most people.

AA11001595	I work in a tribal casino as a table games supervisor. All casinos in my area that are tribal start out with the same requirements:    NONE    All you have to do is not have a criminal background and be a legal US citizen and they let you take their blackjack class. The class usually runs around 3-6 weeks at about 20 hours a week. If you pass the class, you get a job as a dealer and then you can move up as fast as you want. They need people to learn the games first hand before they hire them as a pit boss.    Once you spend a couple months dealing blackjack and other basic carnival games, they let you move on and learn the rest of the games. It generally takes 6-12 months to be considered for a promotion to a dual rated supervisor, which means you deal sometimes and you're a pit boss sometimes, depending on what they need.    From there, you can move up to a full time floor (AKA pit boss). And from there you can move up to a shift supervisor and so on.    Starting dealers are generally going to make $14 - $30 an hour depending on what casino they work at. Usually, the smaller casinos with fewer customers are more willing to train new dealers and offer more dealer classes. They are also more likely to offer the class for free. It takes about 6 months before you can apply to a higher paying casino.    Good luck! It's a fun job. Just ask around and find out which casino in your area offers the blackjack class first!
BfmV2KpUaa	Erm, Rebsziz, GW is free to play, you only need to purchase the game.    First you need a large professional development team, which includes programmers as well as story writers and graphic artists (meshers and skinners) and illustrators, both for concept art and box cover art.  You also need to be able to pay them wages in the 3-4 years of development (at least) it'll take before you actually have a product which can go into beta. Then after at least a year of beta testing, you'll need a publisher and a massive marketing strategy to convince people to buy your new game. You also have to hope that sales profits will excede your expenditure to make a handsome overall profit so you can keep paying your dev team to create new content.    Keep in mind that Arenanet, the developers of Guild Wars, have other pay-to-play MMO's bringing in a steady cash flow, so GW isn't a free-to-play success story in its own right.|`|Lq9tBgdaaa	easy, keep releasing expansions, like guild wars.|`|Ue831INUaa	you could buy this game where you make a game yourself where just you play it or you could make one with multimedia fusion but you will need to know how to program and you'll have to take a class for that|`|zzheoCZ5aa	Try to download the game from www.shareiso.com
DfPyyDssaa	No.  If you kill Derrick, you can get Francis to lower your wanted level (once) but this ability is removed once the main storyline is complete, and besides it's nullified by Kiki's special ability (one of the girlfriends on love-meet.net). Francis will also give you cash for carrying out the hit. If you call him while you are on the roof, and he will offer to increase his payment to $20,000.  Killing Francis on the other hand provides no rewards or special abilities whatsoever, but it might be satisfying to kill him after all that blackmailing he did? Who you kill is entirely your choice, and it only has a slight effect on the next mission "Undertaker" (killing Francis makes this mission slightly easier, but not by much). Once you've made the hit, leave the rooftop and escape from the area to complete the mission.|`|DTlFaJkaaa	I took out Francis because I thought he was a douche bag from the get go...|`|2g28k1XVaa	If Niko kills Derrick, Francis provides him with a more detailed online version of the suspect detail system. He will also remove a three star (or lower) wanted level if Niko calls him. Killing Francis changes the storyline slightly, and the dialogue of McReary family members.    The player does not receive anything from Derrick for killing Francis. However, killing Francis makes the next McReary mission "Undertaker" much easier, as Derrick helps Niko and Packie fight off the attackers of Francis' funeral.
tL9SuAWbaa	I don't think you can...I believe the only ones available are the cheap ones. You maybe able to get it special made by someone, but that would probably be pretty expensive.
mde1I2Qoaa	Since I haven't download the demo yet, I'm not sure.  It's most likely that it'll just come with part of a mission and no achievements nor multiplayer.

uu9fmHqfaa	Yes you can in both situations, that's because the IO and RD's effects don't negate anything till their activation resolves.    By chaining to the activation when the chain resolves they would be destroyed then there effects would go but with them no longer being on the field the effects disappear.|`|VM5cTP4Jaa	Many people got confused with the term "destroy" and "negate".Cards that destroy spell or trap cards like Dust Tornado and Mystical Space Typhoon can only target continuous/equip/field spells and continuous traps.It cannot target other types of spell or trap because it does not negate nor destroy them(the effect will still be activated even if you chain Dust Tornado to Monster Reborn.    Negate on the other hand,can target any type of spell and trap cards so long you negate them when they are activated.For example,you can use magic jammer on Axe of Despair or Premature Burial.    Therefore,in this case Dust Tornado can be activated in response to Royal Decree or Imperial Order as above mentioned.

tL9SuAWbaa	I believe you can, but not positive as I have never tried it myself. You might want to just go ahead and try it.|`|WalnRzfGaa	if it says unique on the item that means you can only equip one.  if it doesnthave that you can equip as many as you can find.|`|SfdTlJ6Vaa	You can if the trinkets arent unique.     If they say unique, then no, that means you cannont equip it more than once.|`|Y2Ctlwetaa	Well kind of,when one is used the other one goes on a about 30sec global CD,Hope that helps|`|qbzen2XYaa	AS long as the trinket does not say "Unique-Equipped" you can equip both.  Since you say it has no Use, i woudnt go out of my way trying to find a second one really.. You definately want to get a Trinket that has some sort of use out of it, even if its only a trinket that will occasionally increase your SP or something else.    Honestly though, you might be better off with a few dfferent trinkets.  Trinkets that help you depending on your situation.  I know a few of my guildies have 2-3 sets of gear and different trinkets depending on if they're tanking, healing, or DPSing a fight.  However, odds are, unless your at level 80, and these trinkets are epic, you'lleventually end up replacing them anyways, so it really shouldnt matter too much.|`|bQn2zDvkaa	Well... There's different type of trinkets most of the trinkets - no.. I'm not even sure if you can use any trinket as the same type. But all trinkets with the unique can only be equipped once if it says unique-2 or more you can equip it 2 once or more.|`|JUtEAadjaa	if they are the same name and such no
m9HkheDfaa	Get 60 in attack , it will  work out, u will be better then.  If u want to increase ur combat lvl, u should elevate ur prayer and def.|`|CAAcoqtYaa	Usually I trained on hill giants till 50 att. Then I went to the spiders in the Stronghold of Security till 55. Then trained on Dragons. Note: They best one is Chaos Tunnels for Green Dragons because there are no Revenants. You should train defense for these things.|`|eme9lhueaa	I'd say go for defence, atleast till 40. I think rune's 40? =p  Then work between attack & defence.   Right now, you're a str nub. lol jk.  :]]|`|pGKOJZgYaa	Get 60 attack, then you can wield Dragon Weapons, which are really good, although the only dragon weapon you can wield without completing quests is the Dragon 2h.    Btw, raise your defense and prayer. Low def will make you fail.|`|NN8VlrvFaa	You might want to get your defense up before you try attack. Then you'll be able to wear higher level armor.
m9HkheDfaa	U should increase ur prayer, because it's useful, all players use it,  at least the good ones, and increase at least ur attack to 60, if u're gonna get member, so u can can use dragon swords, or the dragon weponds.        I wish u luck,  Be happy, and smile :)|`|4TqhDN9Laa	get defence to 20+ then go p2p|`|JZVsrKWgaa	Depends on your weapon. I suggest your getting all your stats up.|`|50LnUAVLaa	Hmm..

aCcRsh7uaa	At the moment you cannot blow any limbs off in Far Cry 2.  Apparently they were planning on having that feature in the game, but due to time constraints and the ESRB, it was removed from the final product of the game.  I read an article on Gamespot saying that there is a downloadable patch in the works that may be able to add this functionality to the game, but I;m not sure if that has been confirmed by Ubisoft.|`|IcEQcIWbaa	Nope....actually there's no limbs dismembered in Farcry 2.

I suppose it's bothering you but wait until you end it till the third difficulty, a REAL surprise will waithing for U... trust me !!!    take this hint and save the mission when it's started, because if you don't save it and don't end it, next time you should start from previous mission :p

AA11522925	I think you will find it's all to do with your theoretical loss, not how much you play through.   If you playing BJ well your theoretical loss on your $1500 is about $30 an hour. You need a supervisor, dealer, cards, tables and space.  The slot player will lose around $48 an hour and need nothing.|`|L2S9jjdLaa	Casino house edge for slots is around 5% to 15%. Less for table games.|`|96zZlJVYaa	I ask the same question when I was out in Las Vegas and Atlantic City.  When you playing table game like Black Jack, Poker, etc you get a low return in comp points than playing the slot machines. The only explanation they gave me was it not how much you play it how long you play. Which I totally disagree with, I play poker from 8pm to 5am (9 hours) and only got $4.50 in comps.     The way I see it that it set to be in the casino favorite and not ours.|`|aSjdL4heaa	It is because the slots have a lower payout than blackjack.  It isn't just a question of how much you bet per house - the issue is how much the house can keep per hour.|`|pAqfWJ8Haa	here, instead of there..............ask @ the casino....probably get a buffet just for asking......a good rule of thumb is 40% comp for your expected loss....by the way using basic strategy is a 5% casino edge...12 bucks.....here is what you do....drink lots of high caffeine expensive coffee......this way you can offset the extra hands played because of the shuffling machine by missing hands played by taking extra bathroom breaks.....you're playing $15.oo per hand...that's less than the comp is worth......so don't dwell on the comps....it's a sucker play..|`|VALo05Zdaa	because they own the business and they do whatever they like.    only way to change it is to start your own casino with your own rules.
UIT1khqtaa	In The Sims 2, the top of the careers is the Athletic career, in which you're working as Hall of Famer with daily salary earned is 3 033 simoleons - weekly salary earned is 9 099 simoleons.    Business careers is definitely not the top one. In this career, you are working as Business Tycoon with daily salary earned is 2 100 simoleons - weekly salary earned is 8 400 simoleons.    On the other hand, for teens/elders jobs:  Athletic, Law Enforcement and Medical careers are the top one. You'll be working as Team Mascot [Athletic], Security Guard [Law Enforcement], or Emergency Medical Technician [Medical]. Daily salary earned for all three jobs is 125 simoleons - weekly salary earned is 625 simoleons.    If I were u, I won't go for cheats.  Because in the meantime, things will end up easy as a pie, you'll get so addicted of using cheats and you'll end up saying the game is boring.    P/S: The General daily salary is 1 138 simoleons.|`|MCTyWCu2aa	Well you could just use motherlode that cheat and you get tons of money.

1T0MQ5zwaa	It depends on the condition of the games, and rarity.  If they're scratched up pretty bad they're gonna ask for a $2.00 refurbishing fee.  Since they're ps2 games, they are not gonna give you much.  The most they'll probably give you is anywhere between $15 - $20 and that's in store credit.  If you want it cash, then it's less.    You can also call them and ask for estimates over the phone, if they're not busy, they'll give you the prices.|`|JrKDKkR2aa	It depends on the inventory that they have for games, how old, what condition, etc.  Since they are ps2, they will probably only be worth 20-30 dollars for all, if even that much.|`|5accc44482612beab885b32f178ed312aa	maybe 20.00 if your lucky|`|YPYzqLNxaa	i will say the money in the order you you havet he games...im just estimating this to what i think is right  $15.00  $10.00  $7.00  $5.00  $3.00  $5.00  $5-8   $5.00|`|1O6bbqplaa	all togeher, 30, maybe 20.
s6emVQleaa	I'm pretty good at it, but I've been drug to antique and estate sales since I was a kid (hated it then and now guess what is all over my house).  It depends on what you are interested in collecting.  If it's dishes or pottery- start by looking at books of different pattern makers.  If you look under most tea cups etc- they will have a stamp of who they were made by and where.  There are a lot of great books out there that will get you started and give you an idea of prices.  If you tell me more specifically what you have in mind I might be able to come up with some recommendations.  The other thing is- there are plenty of things out there that I love that are probably "junk".  If I like it- I don't really care if it's worth anything or not.  Antique stores are going to sell at higher prices.  Estate sales are a great place to look because you have a persons life long collection.  Flea markets are garage sales are great too.  Do you know anyone who is into antiques?  Tag along with them while they shop and you'll start to get an idea of what is out there.|`|um29wkUPaa	You don't always know, but don't enter suspicious, buy what appeals to you.  Plenty of antique homes are regular items given an antique look.      But wait!  There's more!  I have unsolicited advice to accompany this to maximize the collector's experience.  Don't go about it as "collecting", at least while you're starting out, or you'll be constantly aware that you have nothing or a small amount of stuff.  Don't not get something because it'll be the only antique-y item in that room, and therefore look silly with the other stuff.  It wont be a fun hobby if you make it too logical.  (Ask me how I know this.)        Go forward one thing at a time, if you like it and the price strikes you, pick it up.  Don't overthink where you're going to put it, or how it'll look next to something else.  Just get it, that's what makes it fun.  By the same practice... don't go shopping for something - - browse a store or flea market instead.  That's how it stays fun.  Before you know it you'll have the collection that has everyone buzzing.      Or, if you're in a big hurry to build up a collection now, you can start with my wardrobe.  It was last replaced in the early 80s.|`|55adc012d4a1ec0f669d8a4670b7ff63aa	Find something that you really like, say Depression Glass, or Victorian Furniture, for example. Learn as much as you can about them. Get books, go online, go to flea markets,  garage and yard sales, Estate sales and thrift stores.     Most antique shops are over-priced and some will tell you whatever they want to just get a sale. Not all, mind you, but many. Have fun! I love collecting (Silver, Deprssion Glass and Linens for me!) Find what you like and happy hunting!|`|omQq9KMcaa	The library may be the best place to start, you can find books on many different forms of antiques and collectibles. Don't overwhelm yourself by trying to learn everything about the whole field of antiques in one sitting it takes a life time.   Pick type of one item, say vintage butter pat dishes, or stickpins. Then start reading, ask questions of dealers and other collectors. You can also join an online group. Try Yahoo groups. You should find plenty that fall under "Antiques."   We all get taken from time to time and by that fake, but it's all part of the learning process. Just one more reason to start with fairly inexpensive antique, and you will be amazed how much you will learn about other antiques as you go.   Good luck and enjoy.

1T35X8dEaa	you can now lay 3 traps down.     Best and quick way to do hunter is to get an axe, a knife, and 2-3 bird snares    Go to Piscatois hunting area (woodlane), located west of the Gnome Stronghold.    Set up a deadfall trap near Prickly Kebbits, dont bait the trap.  In that area, set up two bird snares.    You should be able to catch the kebbit and two birds. just make sure you set up the bird snares near a deadfall trap that is near birds.    It is a good and easy way to get hunter up      good luck (lvl 60 hunter)
Igtow68zaa	Endless online sure is getting overrun by speeders, hackers and scammers, but it is still an active environment. Vult-r and Arvid are the only people who I beleive are still working on Endless Online, working towards v29, but that doesn't mean it wont come. Earlier on in the month, Rexor (an admin with little powers, who does nothing for the EO team) said that v29 wasn't being released, and then logged on again a few minutes later and said his account was hacked, and he didn't say this. Honestly, I dont think that EO v29 will be comming soon. The only evidence we have seen for v29 is a couple of GFX released on the forums. The new GFX released new spells, in elemental classes. Cool new weapons like Pick Axe and Electric guitar, and spells that mages learn by reading books. Maybe v29 is taking so long because the programming has to be perfect, to do all this and to prevent duping, speeding ect.   I don't play EO looking forward to v29. I go on to socialise with people. You could try to lvl up (with very vigarous training), you could try to work the economy and become rich. EO is what you make it.   It may be moving VERY Slow, but if Vult-r really did desert us, he would stop paying for the immence server cost to keep EO up.   When you say "i cant even log into endless online anymore", It is probably because awhile back, there was a server move. Just go to EO setup and change the game IP to: game.endless-online.com   The Admins still log on once in a while, even if you don't know it. They can become invisible so you cant see them on the online list.  IF YOU HAVE MADE UP YOUR MIND ABOUT QUITING, DONT DROP ALL YOUR ITEMS. You will probably be drawn back like everyone esle does. Pm me in game, my name is Martex.  If you need to contact me, plz Email me @ Quackman24@hotmail.com|`|7bFjuYvhaa	no if its that bad you should try runescape. the missions are fun but $ is teh key.

But you can give in a report on the user by giving feedbacks but the feedbacks will not get you banned.  When people mess around with the bomb, it's not reportable.  Some people do this for a strategic move.  If there are enemies around him, he has to stop defusing in order to use his gun.  Maybe if all the enemy players are dead and there's like 40 seconds left until it explodes, the one guy that's left standing can do whatever he/she wants with the bomb.|`|BzKdDJ07aa	No everything you said is not reportable but you can give them bad reports if you think their actions are undesireable.  Although leaving the game early will give you a lose on your win/loss game record.  Also if you do not touch any buttons long enough while in a game the server will automatically kick you.

WzKrZoHQaa	Portable DVD player with DVD's and spare battery.  Write letters to ppl - everyone LOVES to get mail with lovely stationery but these days they don't due to electronic mail etc and phones/text.    Do some goal setting - start with what you want to end up with in life and pop this in a column at RH side of A4 then pop several columns right way across and it should look like this    Today }   1wk  }    1 Mnth  }  3 Mnths  }  6 Mnths  } 12 M  }  3yr }  5yr }10yr } 15yr      etc until you reach that last RH column.      In the RH column should be EVERYTHING you want to have achieved in yr life and the "before" columns are merely helpful pointers so that you carry out things in life to ensure you get exactly what you want by the time you draw last breath    Yes do include things like have family, own house, move out of home etc.  The first column is merely - well what can you do Today to purt systems in place to be able to achieve my ultimate life ?    This needs time spending on it and a journey like this could well be the one that ensures you are on the Right Life journey also.    It sounds boring but when you get into it - it keeps you focused - nothing is set in stone and you can alter accordingly and set things back a little.

AA10411048	Remember those old paper-cut snowflakes we all used to make when we were kids?? Do some of those and hang them all over the place. Use some "Glitter-glue" on some of them. On the tables for the "ICE" theme, use lost of clear crystal serving platters, and bowls.     Go crazy with orange and red paper products in the "fire" area. If you rent a "Fog/smoke" machine, this would work well for BOTH areas, because there would be smoke/fog involved with both fire AND Ice.     You should get orange or red twinkle light for the "Fire" area, and clear white lights for the "Ice" area.     If you're creative, you wont have to spend a ton, but it will still be very cool!

Use tissue to decorate, Make flames from the tissue and wrap boxes in the light colors to make Ice to stack.   Ask friends for old costumes of angel and devil styles or look for a $1 store or re-sale shop for those items. Fill costumes with stuffing and hang on walls, from ceilings or where ever.  Spider webbing (another good halloween thing) can be used in the Ice side to give it a Foggy or Cloudy look (in the heavens right?)  If possible, get colored light bulbs of red and blue for each area if you can control lighting.  That is all I can think of for now.. Have fun.

caOfuKl5aa	So sorry to hear about that.  A red light doesn't necessarily mean that you have the red ring of death.  Your problem lies with what the red light looks like.  Is it a solid red circle?  That is the RRoD.  If it is 1, 2 or 3 red lights that are blinking, it could be a hardware issue.  The red light issue is generally covered for 3 years.  You need to contact Xbox immediately to get this resolved asap.    http://support.xbox.com/support/en/us/xb...    Good luck, this stuff really sucks!|`|gvWLgYx4aa	try unplugging all the cables and leave it off for a few minutes. if it still shows the red rings and the xbox isnt turning on then you're kinda screwed. you are going to have to call microsoft and let them know.|`|0LQ5CuL0aa	It is the red ring of death. there are three thing thaat could be the problem.     1. your system is failing take it to be fixed    2. if u have it pluged in to multi socket outlet it is not getting enough power and u need to plug it strait into the wall    3. the power boxed is not getting enough ventilation it has a fan in it and it needs space so set it somewhere where it has plenty of space.|`|1T0MQ5zwaa	If the it shows a red ring it means something is wrong.  It depends on the circle.  If its a complete circle, then your in trouble and need to send it back to microsoft for them to fix it. (If you still have a warranty)    If it shows just 3 parts red, then it could mean that you have a loose connection in your wires and can be easily fixed.  Unplug everything and reconnect it back.    If it blinks, it means you have an overheated system and need to place it somewhere where its well ventilated.|`|2Wysnyquaa	call microsoft and they will send you  a sticker for free shipping,or get it off their website.it will take 4-6 weeks.  it could be that the plug,not the power one) is set on the wrong setting hd or regular try switching the the setting and see what happens then.  it could have just overheated too many times though|`|de14HtA9aa	Depends on how much of the ring is lit up red.  The best thing would be that it's just she didn't plug in one the cords well enough.  If it still happens than it means it needs to be sent back to Microsoft cause it's deffective.

3rgJpqjZaa	The Conduit.    The Conduit is a futuristic first-person shooter game under development by High Voltage Software for the Wii console. The Conduit was first revealed by IGN on April 17, 2008, and on October 29, 2008 the developer announced that Sega had signed on to be the game's official publisher. The developer has confirmed that the game is set to be released in North America sometime in Spring 2009.    Development of The Conduit began in October 2007. The game makes use of the Quantum3 engine, a game engine designed by High Voltage Software specifically for the Wii. The engine allows effects such as bump mapping, reflection and refraction, and gloss and detail mapping to be implemented in the game. High Voltage Software created the engine to make The Conduit a comparable experience visually to games on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 despite the Wii's hardware limitations.    The storyline focuses on an alien invasion of Washington, D.C. in the near future. The alien race uses the eponymous Conduits, which are portal-like devices, to deploy their forces throughout the city. An organization called the Trust sends Mr. Ford, a newly inducted agent, into the area to discover the reasons for the attack. The online multiplayer feature of the game includes several game modes such as Deathmatch and will have voice chat capability through the Wii Speak peripheral.    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Conduit|`|1T0MQ5zwaa	I say Super Smash Brothers Brawl, MarioKart, and Legend of Zelda|`|TFnE3qisaa	I love Super Smash Brothers|`|0LQ5CuL0aa	carnival games    call of duty 3|`|Ioyt2RnYaa	I'll list 3 really fun games...  -Call of Duty: World at War (for online)  -Mario Strikers  -Super Smash Bros Brawl|`|sxpklh7jaa	screw you people resident evil 4 is the way to go    but brawl was good    maybe you should get a gcube controller and get some of those games.|`|HwiJWBJaaa	I would say, super smash bros or something like mario is a classic, but seriously super smash bros is incredible.|`|Ewwi9c5uaa	sonic Vs mario olympic game one is so tired but very excited lol :)|`|exep6XWlaa	DO NOT LISTEN TO CHAZZ!!!! carnival games is a 5 second thrill and cod3 is so bad. super smash bros brawl i agree is amazing!! if u would like an F.P.S then get CoD5 and for a basic fighter ssbb.

AA11522925	Sounds like you will need a remote licence, here's what the gambling commission has to say about it:    Operators can for the first time provide remote gambling facilities using British based equipment.     Remote gambling is defined in the Act as gambling in which persons participate by the use of remote communication, including the internet, telephone, television, radio or any other kind of electronic or other technology for facilitating communication.    Under the Gambling Act 2005, remote gambling operators need an operating licence from the Gambling Commission, and the majority of senior management need personal licences. The provision of facilities for gambling without obtaining an operating licence will be an offence if at least one key piece of remote gambling equipment is situated in Great Britain (as defined in the Act), irrespective of whether or not the facilities are provided for use wholly or partly in the UK.    I think you will also need a personal licence.|`|fda66a3825ca9cdd945fd0f771540bddaa	You need to apply to the Gambing Commission.

1W7geggMaa	Unfortunately, the only thing that you can deduce from seeing the lights come on is that you have successfully plugged it in and that the main transformer works.  It's similar to saying "my car doesn't run, but if I open the door the interior lights come on."    If you have experience repairing electronic devices, you may be able to fix it yourself.  Otherwise you'll need to hire someone to do it for you.

If thats not the case if you got windows you can try to sync it or mabey you need to dl some kind of software on your pc to use it to be honest I have never owned a psp but they are awsome. There could be many reasons why your pc doesn't connect. Your talking drivers software or maybe they are just not compatible with one enother. If your trying to get internet from your pc don't connect through your pc connect through your modem. It should normally recognize it once you plug in the usb cable though. Just for say.... not sure if any of this helps just a bunch or random mabey try bluetooth connection if you got it. Sry if this is useless though all i could think of mabey check the psp website to see if there is anything you need to dl from the web.
Xm5ab6F6aa	The clam will have to be filed from the seller at the post office electronically or in person and for media mail its 30 day wait, it can be reported as lost mail.     If you had paid for insurance you will get your money back, but if not then its a lost box, hopefully it will show up.     A good seller will send you another DVD, and as a good buyer and if the lost one arrives send it back to the seller. I have been selling on ebay or 9 or 10 years.     This is a post office problem, so look at the tracking every morning to see if there is any progress on the missing dvd. The seller did there job the post office did not.     hope this helps|`|5lnwpiyAaa	If your item has been shipped but hasn't arrived, it doesn't mean that your order just "disappeared" or isn't coming. It just means that it needs more time for your item to arrive. Wait a few more weeks (yes you must be patient with ebay). If you still haven't gotten your item, complain to this person, and give him negative feedback.   But I don't think you can get your money back if it's already been shipped to you. If you can though, somewhere in the confirmation email it should have an option that let's you cancel your order.|`|XYsqMNvRaa	Well you can always go to a lawyer and tell him what happened, or you can wait. If you already contacted the seller he should answer your message, maybe there was a problem in the mail, the package got lost or somethign so you should also try contacting the mail company.  Again you can always talk to a lawyer about it because the seller stole your money. (it happened something like this to a friend, she bought a camera that was supposedly new and it was opened and broken when she got it, so she went to a lawyer and they made the guy give her money back.)    Well, good luck!|`|d5928aef823e729cbef56cb2408fdda4aa	Email this person again letting you know that you have not recieved your item yet and you are considering leaving negative feedback. If this person cares about their rating they will respond quickly and do something to try to make things right (either send a new one or refund your money).      Give the seller the chance to fix this but be aggressive about it. Yes the package was shipped but if it was due on January 13th and still has not arrived--it's not coming. Approach the seller first and if you don't get a response in a few days then go ahead and contact ebay directly to file a complaint. At that point the case will be reviewed and a decision will be made. This can take up to a month's time though so don't expect an answer overnight.|`|kIqq7yIAaa	start hounding the shipping company the seller did his part well by providing you with a tracking number that is active  the postal service has eaten your package so you need to make them cough it up    next time get insurance on your packages   and set up a paypal account to CYA     BTW DVD's can be sent through the regular mail in a small box  in their jewel cases for protection  as they're not magnetic they won't be harmed by the magnetic scanners used to trace packages|`|nMzzwrtUaa	You can get your money back easily if you call ebay and they refuse to refund your money then go threw your bank and file a charge back under the notion you never received your items. Also if the person does not respond back you can also use that to your advantage. you have to give the seller at least 21 days (yes i know its past 21 days) but if all else fails go threw your bank. When it comes to ebay and amazon.com i tend to trust amazon.com|`|ZKVlF2pKaa	If the tracked package is shown as being as successfully shipping to a Cincinnati hub/post office then the seller has already done there end of the deal and it's the post office's fault you don't have your DVDs yet. You should have gotten insurance. I'm pretty sure you're just out of money but you can try finding out the number of the hub and seeing if they can figure out what happened to your package. It also can take 4-6 weeks for it to get from the hub to you so I'd wait a little longer if I were you.|`|SLSX6QQsaa	You payed with PayPal right?  So contact PayPal and file a claim, immediately. There is a time limit so do it right away.  Then they contact the seller and ask for tracking info, or resolution.  If you don't get your item, PayPal will refund your money.  Also an FYI, I just got ripped off on ebay from a seller that had 100% great feedback.  I guess some Chinese guy broke into the US sellers account and put some items for sale, then took the money I sent VIA paypal and ran.  So its a big time rip off, PayPal was a pain to deal with but told me the process to follow to get my $$ back, but my CREDIT CARD COMPANY actually will reverse the charge. Thats the other route to go, if you don't receive the item in 30 days and PayPal isn't helping, you can file a dispute with your credit card company or bank.  Chase immediately refunded the money back to my card and took it back from PayPal.|`|9Kt7p7Vfaa	Ebay sucks these days. If you payed with Paypal there is a chance you can get your money back. File a dispute with Ebay and another with Paypal. The seller will need to reply or face possible repercussions but Ebay still holds no liability. If you payed by money order, you're screwed. Ebay will not help you get your money back in even the slightest way, happened to me three times because I didn't have Paypal set up. You can also request the seller's information and phone number from Ebay.
e6c0dea2b61e835f2262b43b2ed5d1ebaa	60 Cards - check  40% Land - 20 Land works when it's cheap creatures, the extra 4 land is irrelevant.  Kill Condition, Explained well.  So a Test of Endurance deck (card you were thinking of with the 50+ life) for the win?  Problems with counters already experienced, should also have problems with green as they naturalize artifacts and enchantments.  Would have problems with white fog deck that runs Oblivion Ring (one way to stop a planeswalker too).  You need a side board for this deck.  I might run 4 Oblivion Rings for big problems that Unmake cannot target.  Sometimes you just need to clear the board, so the new Conflux card Martial Coup, would be perfect, but you probably don't have those as of yet.  If your opponent has a lot of creatures, use the life gain against him there too with 4 Soul Warden in the side board.  I would also use 4 Rebuff the Wicked to protect your stuff or even 4 Eight and a half Tails so that you get a creature that gives all your stuff pro-white and makes all your opponents spells white.  You might consider even replacing the marble chalice and angel's feather with anything just mentioned for sideboard use.  Those cards gain you life, but they are a waste in your hand if you draw them late game.  You might also want to consider Fuedkillers Verdict.  Gain the life and get a Giant in the process.    There's my opinion, I hope it helps.|`|8M7b1PAHaa	I would toss the marble chalices, which only gain one life, and get some Beacon of Immortality from Tenth Edition. It's a 5W sorcery that doubles your life. If you can get one of those in play after you've got yourself up to 30 or 40 or whatever, it's much more efficient than a lot of weaker life gain.    However, while your deck seems like it's built around building a lot of life it doesn't seem as though you have enough offense. Yeah, a 75/75 avatar is dope, but what if it gets terrored? Just seems a little too vulnerable to creature removal or a fast swarm deck. Maybe some Wrath of God to clear the board before you drop your avatar?
6eROUvT1aa	TMD is surprisingly good for exp, i can get 400-600 exp a match (sometimes) when im in the mood, its very good exp, about the same as an average S & D match its quite surprising - but S & D is still the best :P|`|mde1I2Qoaa	Well, if you're good at the game, S&D will be a faster playlist to play on if you're looking to level fast.  TDM does suck but if you don't want to play S&D, try Domination.|`|aUB0oRHBaa	it might be that he just completes a lot of gun challenges or that he was playing on a double xp weekend. every once in a while they do that. either that or he plays way too much.

aUB0oRHBaa	go on vacation or go to the movies. a job would take up a lot of free time and youd be making money too. try a new hobby like skateboarding or bike riding.|`|rZSOjQA9aa	get yourself some free games or whatever you want, really simple, just check out this link, loadsa people already use it.    http://www.prizerebel.com/index.php?r=95...|`|kIqq7yIAaa	try amtgard a medieval live action roleplaying game  using foam weapons    very safe  tons of fun  easy to learn  meet lots of new friends  CHEAP to play  yes girls do play too and they're just as good  the fastest known way to kill boredom    go to amtgardwiki and look for a group near you
2b6bec3d7f2fe8f5707c7d178253ef15aa	Go early Park as far away from Bayshore as you can walk. Park near a place to sit and eat after the parade because everyone trying to leave at once just keeps traffic snarled. their is a difference of about an hour from the starting point of the parade and the end of the parade. (Meaning the first float will not be seen until an hour after the start time if you are in downtown Tampa)
7XGa9zcdaa	If you really want to snag a deal, and do not mind a used console, check out the eBay store link below for 2ndTurn Electronics.  They only sell used electronics, and if you look around, you can find a practically new system.    I got the computer I'm using right now off this store, and I'm not even sure if it was ever used.  Yet it only cost me $160, and it works wonderfully.    I've provided you the video game console sub-section, so keep an eye on it, because the 360s will often show up in waves.|`|wGUQqZrVaa	http://www.geeks.com/details.asp?invtid=...    http://consumerdepot.com/products.asp?id...    this is about as cheap as you will find one they are both great  websites and come with a warranty  good luck!!!!|`|O2HJjOZwaa	lol buy 1 used from the game store ill sell you 1 that i fixed myself for $100|`|rZSOjQA9aa	get one free from here, wud take you about a month, but who cares if it costs nothing, the site will direct you how to do it.    http://www.prizerebel.com/index.php?r=95...|`|aZcD3ibyaa	I'd suggest a used one from Gamestop or someplace similar.  At least you'll have a warranty.|`|I1J7nNFbaa	I went and got the Xbox Aracde and ordered a 20 GB hard drive off Amazon. All together it was about 220 bucks. A good deal, I say, since your getting six free games with the Arcade.     It works great, I have Saint's Row 2, Oblivion and Skate. The harddrive is big enough to store all the saves, music and whatnot I need. This way, when you save up enough cash, you can get the 60 or 120 GB harddrive.    Good luck and hope this helps.
THJCWCoMaa	They are worth about 25 cents at a garage sale.|`|Btsctjydaa	Beanus babbies are much more valuable.|`|uKLJYYVlaa	Only if you can find someone willing to buy them.  I have 4 totes of them. I guess just save them.  Who knows.|`|DUGZa0Zgaa	Yes, in tough economic times, as families struggle to pay their mortgages and feed themselves it is important to have a strong portfolio of Beanie Babies.|`|TRvAhhNKaa	I can't believe people paid over $1000 for the Princess Diana Bear.|`|uIF9Wtbjaa	Look on ebay.  The sell for under a buck each.|`|we2Csi51aa	hold on to them!  my grandmother has decade old beanie babies and they will be worth alot in years to come.  hold on to them in your bassement or attic until they go up !|`|NuOGOflkaa	You should hold on to them for sure! In not too many years they should be worth more than they are now (which is not very much). I thought of selling mine and then I looked around on Ebay, and the prices are lower than what I originally bought my Beanie Babies for! Someday though, these precious little plushies will be worth a lot....at least, thats what I think. :)

37fchEXVaa	You take only one new ability in Mission 2  so you see that blue glowing circle ?  stand on it and use Snatch (Lock-on + Devil Arm)|`|JjKUpJ6naa	plz give me more details, which part of mission 2 and which broken wall??? after taking what ability, you mean after taking the skull?
BzKdDJ07aa	I dont think its possible, if it is I would imagine you just use the colors to hit the right notes.
IcEQcIWbaa	Yeah if u play a lot in front of a screen,ur eyes will get doomed later!    Hope u understand.  Peace!|`|OikNR8Ufaa	i think if you play games a lot on the computer or portable games systems it's not good for your eyesight, because you get used to looking at the screen at one distance all the time and when you look up your eyes struggle to re-focus. I know since I started playing WoW alot my one eye'd gone super blind and now I cant see close up with it to do my make-up! eek!
AA10010715	Take your Downloads folder out of    My Documents>EA Games>The Sims 2>Downloads    Start the game.  If it starts then you have something in your downloads folder that is causing the game to crash.|`|eD2SzJ2Jaa	if you have 64 bit vista try running it in 32 bit mode|`|JsWnIi72aa	There's a few things you can do : Right click the program and run as admin, make sure you have the latest version of DirectX, make sure the program isn't blocked by a firewall.|`|hZUzv4qgaa	Well, I'm not very familiar with Sims 2 and adding things to it but if it keeps crashing (as my Sims 1 does), I would just delete it all and reinstall the Sims 2, see how that works.|`|I1J7nNFbaa	This could happen for a number of reasons.     You could have too much custom content, and the game can't handle all the things you have downloaded. So it will either crash, not work at all or freeze often. You may have to find what download is corrupt or just get rid of the Downloads folder in the EA folder.    You may need to right click the Icon on the desktop, go to security and click to "Run as Admin." This usually makes it work.    You may have had a bad install, and a file that is needed for the game was not installed correctly or wasn't installed at all. If this is the case, try re-installing it. If it still messes up, you may have to get a new disc.    Hope this helps, I had a lot of issues with various things in that game, but mostly its what you download. Custom content can seize the game up, and if you don't have all the expansion packs needed for the file your downloading....it won't work at all or will cause the game to freeze.|`|tcPaHzkUaa	Ouch! I clipped my nail way too short!
IcEQcIWbaa	Emulator:  It depends on the manufacturer of the console.  They consider it as illegal.    Both are the same.  U can download PS games and burn them to a cd.  or use a PS game directly if u have.    Peace!|`|0UpFkX5oaa	Well.... technically if you don't own the game yourself, it's illegal to download them.  With the emulators, you can either use an original game disc or download an image of the game.|`|g54tGcRvaa	ePSXe is a good one IMO.  It will play either discs or images.  If you own the disc you can extract the image to play it more efficiently.|`|6UHuyZ6vaa	Play station - PSX  Playstation 2 - PCSX2  Playstation 3 - I donno    They are completely illegal    U can use a CD as well as Download the game|`|3cLWlMQxaa	Don't get me started with these. Anything over Genesis, emulators just don't work properly. I tried dreamcast, gamecube, and playstation. Ps1 worked, which is rare, but ps2, wii, xbox? No. Even if you have a high spec rate for your machine, you have to configure BIOS, plugins, set up the emulator, wait DAYS for certain roms to download, even though many don't even work. It isn't worth it. Sorry.|`|FxEXgZDWaa	as far as i kno ....theres no word of illegal   u can use disc or download games.    but it dose  not work properly.....i hve tried on many games ...but with failer|`|Tk29jePpaa	As far I as know they are legal do to most of the games copyrights have expired. Also there are alot of websites to download them from, ps1 games will not work in a cdrom drive.
F3gpgvRGaa	I havent played this game in a while.  But he might be around the water fountain where all the hotel shops are, the sundeck, the basement, or the desert.  Try the basement first.
AA11850311	look in the paper or on the computer for a job in the criminal career.  It's like any other job, you don't go to work with your sim .

mOTCr8Pxaa	Why don't you create a team like the rest of us do: Training from the ground up. I have over 60 lvl. 100's on my diamond and every one was trained the old fashioned way.    You wan't to cheat lvl. 100's with 999 in all stats is that it? People can't stand cheaters and neither do I. It's a throw in the face to us, the real players who took the time and effort to get a legit lvl. 100 team. And people will not wan't to battle cheaters.
YPYzqLNxaa	It matters on your connection...its still slow no matter what.... then scrolling is odd and all that stuff|`|09CkgnEHaa	It's sorta difficult to navigate the internet on the PSP
