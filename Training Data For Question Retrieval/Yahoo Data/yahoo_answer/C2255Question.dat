I just scheduled a vacation to Disney World (Florida) from March 22nd to March 28th (Sunday to Saturday). I plan on going to the parks from monday to friday. Will it be busy then? I know most colleges, but not all, have spring break the week before that. And where I am from, elementary schools and high schools don't have break until April.   So I am wondering, will the crowds be light during the week? Or do the southern schools have break during this time or will college break kids be crowding the place?   Also, does anyone know how the economy is effecting Disney attendance? I personally got a great deal on flight and hotel, so i don't know if that's a sign that they're struggling or if they're just going to attract more visitors. IDK, just trying to plan how it's going to be.   Any advice would be great :)

20090226103715AANojN5	Games & Recreation;Toys	Barbara Millicent Roberts(Barbie) and Klaus Barbie the nazi?	Upon searching wikipedia, i have found out that "Barbie's full name is Barbara Millicent Roberts". "Barbie is a fashion doll manufactured by Mattel, Inc. and launched in March 1959"   "Klaus Barbie (October 25, 1913 – September 25, 1991) was an SS-Hauptsturmführer (rank approximately equivalent to army captain), soldier and Gestapo member. He was known as the Butcher of Lyon."   "On July 4, 1987, Klaus Barbie was sentenced to life imprisonment for crimes against humanity, and died in jail in Lyon of leukemia four years later, at the age of 77."      Question, for those who lived or know what it was like back then.. when you have such a war criminal as Klaus Barbie, is it ok to invent a doll named after(or at least bearing the identical family name of) that person? People must have knows about him, it was all in the papers. Was it like a mockery? although, if you invent right now dolls named Saddam, not most children would even touch them.. I really don't get it, how come they are so popular, with such a controversial name? thank you.

20090225112143AASPbHS	Games & Recreation;Hobbies & Crafts	Too small crochet hook for this pattern?	there's this pattern i want to do but i couldnt find my bigger hook so i had to get this hook instead. size G.   the pattern calls for a J or K hook. how do i fix the pattern so the hat will turn out the same size but work with my hook. thanks      Puffy Slouchy Hat   Bulky weight yarn, size K hook. For Worsted weight use a J hook      The numbers in the [] say how many stitches there should be.      Puff stitch: (YO, insert hook in next st, YO, pull up a loop) 4 times, YO, and draw through all loops on hook. (Here’s a video)      You do not have to join rounds, and this will create a spiral, and there will be no seam. Use a stitch marker if you do this, and keep the stitch count the same.      1: ch 4, 12 dc in first st, join in ch. (Just grab one loop from top of the chain. This makes the seam less visible, and this will make a circle.) [12]      2: ch 3, work 1 dc where chain is (in same st as join - ch3 counts as first dc), 2 dc in each stitch, join with sl st (remember, the ch counts as a st!). [24]      3: ch 3, work 1 dc where chain is, (work 1 dc, 2 dc in next stitch) around. Join. [36]      4: ch 3, work 1 dc where chain is, (work 1 dc in next 2 sts, 2 dc in next st) around. Join. [48]      5: ch3, work 1 dc where chain is, (work 1 dc in next 3 sts, 2 dc) around. Join. [60]      6: ch 3, 1 dc in each st around. Join. [60]      7: ch 3, 1 dc in each st around. Join. [60]      8: ch 3, 1 dc in each st around. Join. [60]      9: ch 3, puff st in same st as join, dc in next st, (puff in next st, dc in next   st) around. Join in top st of first puff. [60 sts: 30 puffs, 30 dc]      10: ch 1, (sc in top of puff, sc in next dc) around. Join. [60]   * It will look like you are skipping stitches here, but you aren’t. Just   remember, sc in top of puff, skip spot, and sc in top of dc post. Make sure you have 60 sts here!      11: same as row 9. [60 sts: 30 puffs, 30 dc]      12: sc around, same as row 10.
