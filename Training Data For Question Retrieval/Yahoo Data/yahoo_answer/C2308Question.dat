20090220182832AAVCun0	Education & Reference;Quotations	Which contradicting quote do you agree with: "Live every day as it was your last?" or "Live for tomorrow?"?	These quotes contradict themselves. If we were to "live every day as it was your last", we wouldn't be able to "live for tomorrow". I hear people say both, and personally, I choose "live every day as it was your last" because I believe tomorrow is not promised. As difficult as it is to live by that sentiment, I believe it is very important to make the most out of the present moment.       I believe "Live for tomorrow" is a great idea, as to follow your dreams and plan out your future, because as humans, we have to keep tomorrow in mind as well.      In conclusion, I think that today is more important than tomorrow for "tomorrow will worry about itself".      What is your life mantra and why?

This is only part of the whole thing. Thanks a bunch!      "It is giving a value to truth. It is never telling a lie. It is being genuine and real to oneself and to others. It is being loyal, fair, and just. It reaches deep within each of us and forces us to act with sincerity and tell the truth during tough situations regardless of future judgment or condemnation. This has many saved lives, as well as destroyed some, but it is always the right thing. Without it, one is immoral and lost without a sense of guidance. It makes us worthy of trust when giving constructive criticism on another delegate’s bill, or helping a friend with his or her brief. It has saved lives, as well as destroyed them. With this small trait in our hearts, it helps us build stronger bonds with the people around us. It is a moral and ethical strength. The word is honesty."

I am an IB student in grade 11, thinking about my future... and feeling very stuck. I am more of a bio person; I've been getting 100 in my bio ib class for semester1 and recently started my semester Chem class, so I'm not sure if I'm all that great in Chem. However, a lot of good schools I've checked require 2 HL's and my school only offers HL for bio and math, but I only decided to take bio HL because I'm not too good at math. We don't have chem HL so this means I only have one HL in sciences...       Are there any exceptions? What are some other options? Any other suggestions for me?       It'll be great if you could answer any of those questions. Thanks!

20090220164131AAYlhPn	Education & Reference;Financial Aid	Regarding financial aid/FAFSA - what do you enter for 'Adjusted Gross Income'?	Gross income is $60,000, but I have a ton of deductions from employee/business expenses (like $28,000!) making the adjusted income on my taxes around $30,000.  I have read somewhere that you can deduct moving expenses (relocated for job), and another place that you can deduct charitable donations too (which we have a lot of, also)  Can I deduct these expenses and apply them to make a lower AGI on the FAFSA?        Also does anyone know anything about the 'displaced worker' on the form?  I think I qualify for that as I was laid off from my position and my spouse does not work outside the home.        Any info from anyone with experience on this?  THANKS

I began student teaching about a month and a half ago in a rather notorious fifth grade classroom. I enjoy the group and the curriculum immensely, but they test me daily and are well known throughout the school as a tough crew. My current struggle is asserting myself as an authority figure before they cross the line and I have to "shut them down" dramatically. You know, "Everyone stop! I want complete and total silence... not a single word!" They are a chatty, chatty, CHATTY bunch with little regard for themselves, their peers, or adults. Any suggestions? I'd really like to try out some fun lesson plans, but with management such an issue I am not sure if I can. Thank you in advance!

20090220180715AA862zs	Education & Reference;Words & Wordplay	What the heck is wrong with me?	Ok, so I'm a common senior guy in high school and I got this serious confusion. I have my friends around like everyone else (guys and girls, both) and there's this guy who I talk once in a while but is not a really close friend, and for some reason I feel partially jealous of him. I'm gonna say that he's pretty good looking but I think that I am just a little bit better looking than him, he has a girlfriend and I feel ridiculously jealous at him, because I don't have any, even though I don't really want to, because I don't want to get involved in serious relationships and stuff. I like his personality, the way he gets a joke out of anything, the way he talks to people, I just like the way he is, and by the way, I know I'm not gay, if a sex scene would pass by my mind, I would smash my head against the wall first before that happens and then shoot myself, I just like him but feel jealous at the same time because I want to be like him but I can't. So my question is, how can you like a person and slightly hate him at the same time? I just don't get what the heck is wrong with me. What should I do to solve this problem? Thanks :)

My mother has cancer, and paying the co-payments can be tough. Even with her illness, she works as a nurse full-time [usually, she's out for the next few months for surgery, so I think she might get disability payments]. My father is a nursing assistant[not much pay].       I have just started community college, a big sacrifice personally, because I've been told FAFSA won't give me a second look when they see my parents bought 2 cars and a house in the last decade. I'm a hard worker, a full time student with 19 credits by May.      I intend to take classes in the summer and fall, so the money crunch will get even harder...I can't get a job as of yet because of my mother's unpredictable condition,so THAT doesn't look good to FAFSA either...      Help me,please. Are there liable options that are useful here?   I've considered simply moving out,and living as an 'independent'. Could that help?      For anyone that answers seriously, I thank you in advance. It is duly appreciated!

Two “solid” digestive organs, the liver and the pancreas, produce digestive juices that reach the intestine through small tubes called ducts. The gallbladder stores the liver’s digestive juices until they are needed in the intestine. Parts of the nervous and circulatory systems also play major roles in the digestive system.     When you eat foods—such as bread, meat, and vegetables—they are not in a form that the body can use as nourishment. Food and drink must be changed into smaller molecules of nutrients before they can be absorbed into the blood and carried to cells throughout the body. Digestion is the process by which food and drink are broken down into their smallest parts so the body can use them to build and nourish cells and to provide energy.

So I'm in gr 11 right now, second semester (out of 2) and we have to do course selections by march 2nd, and I mean it kind of decides our lives because it's grade 12 and I still don't know what to do. I narrowed it down to either going to film school and learning to produce films, hopefully become either a producer or a director. OR I could also go into computer science/software engineering and become rich off that. I'm pretty good at both and really love doing both. Please don't tell me to go to software engineering because it's in demand or because I'll never make it as a producer/director I've herd it all before. I don't know what to do, I mean if you have statistics sure tell me them, but don't be like ur not gona make it. I also don't know which school (university) is good for either (I want the best)... any advice? Also other possibilities include: A) create my own software and perfect it and try to sell that and start my own software company or B) start my own production company.... I know I don't have chances with these two, but I am confident in my skill with both programming and film production, so considering those factors what would you say for me to do? feel free to add another extra option

I am applying to study abroad for one semester ( six months) and I hope I get accepted. I want this for myself, for my enhancement as a cultured individual and to expand my global range of interests. However, my mother feels that going to Japan is pointless and is selfish of me, since I visited for 3 weeks on a student tour back in High School ( 2005) and living with " a bunch of asian people" is not going to make a difference in obtaining a job or achieving in a career. I disagree with this, and I can't believe my mother is being so negative about it, but I would like more opinions.So you all know, I don't just want to go to Japan to play the latest video games and watch anime ( I actually despise Otaku culture but to each his own). I am a Sociology Major and have thought about research, field work, teaching..so many things but I have yet to pinpoint what it is I want to do.    if you've studied abroad, has it made an impact on your current career? would u have not gone if u could go back and do it over?    thanks alot.      -chicbelle

I'm friends with some of "cool kids" and the losers. Mostly its girls, and what I don't get is how they ignore me and think I'm a loser when I look at the other guys they like. I'm make pretty good grades and I would consider myself smart and I even play guitar but apparently girls don't like that since the ones they like are skill less idiots that I guess are better looking than me. I would consider my self a nerd but I never express it, I make sure that I don't. but still they ignore me, and some are even very hateful to me when I do nothing to them, and I know that people say high school doesn't matter down the line and stuff like that but still, if I don't do something school will just be another 3 and a half years of hell      So please whats wrong with me?

We have been together 5 years and apart nearly all that time and enough is enough. He doesn't want to transfer and wants to finish there, but it might be another half year before he is done and we were supposed to get married this summer =/ and if he moves here though he might have to take some stuff over and spend longer time in school..i have a good paying, stable job and dont think it would be smart for me to move away and lose that job.

Does anyone know what would be best to do? we're at a standstill.....

Okay I know there are a million questions exactly like this but I want to hear opinions on my particular situation. I want to either take Ap Chem or Ap Bio next year but I don't know which one. I REALLY hate math. I can do math fine, but I don't like it at all. If AP Chem has simple math then thats okay, but if its complicated I'm not sure I want to deal with that. I am more of a english/history girl, so Ap Bio sounds better for me. The problem is, our AP Bio teacher is notorious for being a really bad teacher. And I love our AP Chem teacher. Which one should I take?       Oh and I am also taking AP US History, AP Spanish, and honors English.

20090220203506AAWePqI	Education & Reference;Homework Help	Help me edit my english paper PLEASE!(I'M TO WRITE A SHORT STORY ON SOMETHING THAT HEPPENED TO ME IN REAL LIFE?	I was just fifteen. I was already living in Naples by then. School had let out on Thursday giving us a three day weekend. My parents had agreed to bring me to my grandmothers house in Miami to visit during the weekend. Little did they know what I was really looking forward to doing was just being with my old friends. The next morning after arriving at my grandmothers house, I called my cousin to see what was up for the night. It was the night that I never forgot.    Friday January/13/2006 it was already dark out. we were on our way to the metro rail to catch a train to sunset. Julian was telling me how things didn’t really change since the last time I was there. When we got to the train station I felt my stomach growling so we went to get some sausage dogs from some food cart. It was about nine o’clock, just the two of us waiting on the train to arrive when we saw a group of about four of five guys walking towards us. Julian seemed to recognize them. But not in a good way. They looked a bit older than us, they had to be in their twenties. Julian whispered to me “don’t punk out”. One of the guys called out Jewels! Julian’s nick name as if he knew him. His name was Johnny Carson, he asked if we would spare some dollars for the train fare. Julian said no in an unfriendly voice. That’s when they rushed us. We were on the ground getting kicked and punched when I saw some rusted pipe laying on the floor so I swung it with all my strength to the closest guy. It hit him hard enough to stop everyone in their tracks to pick up their injured friend as we ran down the electric stair case and ran through the government buildings. We slowed down at some bus stop where no one was in sight. I could feel the sweat dripping down my eye brow. Tasting the blood in my mouth and the feel of adrenalin rushing through my veins as the smell of sweet victory flowing in the calm night breeze hit my face. My senses keen to the slightest movement. angry voices coming from the alley we ducked behind some abandoned car in an effort to hide from the angry group as they walked by in a rush. A few minutes had passed when Julian said “everything is good, we can go know“.    We were walking for several minutes when I heard the sound of several gunshots so I turned around to see. All the people in their apartments ran outside. It was just another party for them to see just who they would know. It didn’t take long for me to realize those bullets were for us. We made it to the end of the street when a homeless man too doped up to pay mind to anything, was sitting on the side walk singing some old tune. I felt a pain coming from my ankle and the singing suddenly stopped and I looked down where I was bleeding. I couldn’t believe I got shot and this was just it? I always thought It would be more painful? that’s when Julian yelled “King“! A bullet had tore through the homeless man’s back as it went back through his abdomen and hit my ankle.    I almost threw up right on the spot. I could see the ripped, punctured skin. He started to get pale and I could see tears roll down Julian’s face. Julian must have known him. I screamed for help I don’t think anyone could hear and if they did they didn’t care. I hated every one at that moment. The old man lye here gasping and I wondered what could I do. I heard the sirens coming. When they finally arrived and were lifted him up into the ambulance, I sat there in disbelief. A policeman had told me we were shot at with a .44 magnum revolver and if it had hit me without slowing down and weakening through the mans flesh, I would have been gone.   I watched as they loaded the guys up who shot at us. They were found in some abandoned apartment. I wanted to stick a bomb in Johnny Carson’s mouth and watch it explode. To the police and reporters it was just a story. They didn’t feel anything since they didn’t know the poor man. I never thought I’d ever be back because it would never be the same there. So I wiped away the tears and left the scene just the way I got there. Though people said I was crazy and the night could have been better. I’ll never forget the night that King sang his lullaby.

Why do you want to go to college? What do you want to study and why?   Here's my essay:                 When I was in grade 9, I think that going to college is not an important thing. I can have a shop of my own as long as I have a skill, making jewelry. But as I grew older, I realize that going to college is so important. Although I can make and design jewelry, my techniques didn’t improve at all. I found that the things I drew were all in the same style and making similar jewelry all the time is boring. From that time on, I decided to work hard to get into the school I want. Going to college can help me improve my skills and I could learn a lot of new things. In college, I want to study product design, or maybe furniture design instead of jewelry design. I didn’t choose to study jewelry design because I hope I could learn more things about design. For jewelry design, I could continue learning that outside of school and as I learn through college, my drawing skills and the creativity will definitely improve.

I probably want to double major in med. and philosophy, and Johns Hopkins is at the top of my list for colleges I want to go to.      I'm currently a freshman in high school, and have had some teacher problems in the past, but are resolving those and becoming a better student. I'm a good academic student, and dabble in some extracurricular activities, not much sports, but an area that I excel in is music. Also, I may be ruled out from joining NHS, is that a big deal? I may be able to join music honor society or French honor society, though.      What all can I start doing in order to build my resume for college, besides getting straight A's, high test scores, etc.? I'm planning on joining debate club and model united nations next year, I think I'd be good at those.      I've been written up 3 times this year, 2 were warnings which say I had a conference with the principal (those times I happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time) and 1 referall which says I broke a school rule (for talking in class). The referral and one of the warnings are from my French teacher, who I will have for the full 4 years of high school. I've started behaving better, if I got a reccomendation from her that said that I had a bit of trouble at the beginning but became a much better student later on, and if I don't get any more write ups for the rest of my high school career, (the write ups so far were all first semester freshman year, will Johns Hopkins look past that?

20090220213932AAE9ZF1	Education & Reference;Words & Wordplay	Shall anyone help me to write the following article in another way, please! 10 points for sure!?	Anabolic Steroids   Anabolic Steroids are powerful drugs that help the body gain mass, but also hurts the body with drastic side effects. Anabolic Steroids are a type of natural and synthetic hormone that stimulates cell growth and division, resulting in an increase of muscle tissue and strength. The growth only occurs when combined with physical training (Wikipedia.org/wiki/Anabolic_Steroids).   Anabolic Steroids may help you gain muscle mass, but with a high price. Steroids have noticeable side effects including acne and scars, an increased sex drive, increased hair growth in Androgen-Sensitive areas, deepened voice along with an increased vocal cord size, more or bigger muscles, a larger appetite, bone remodeling, increased production of Red Blood Cells, liver damage, headaches, irritability, trouble sleeping, and jaundice (Santella 613.8). In Males, the penis may decrease or increase in size, breasts can be developed, premature balding, and testicular pain. In Females, development of man-like features may occur (Santella 613.8).   There are many different types of Anabolic Steroids, but mostly there are oral anabolic steroids and intravenous steroids (Santella 613.8). Oral Steroids are usually pills that one would take through the mouth. Intravenous Steroids are injected into the body (Santella 613.8). Some different types of Oral Anabolic Steroids are Anadrol, Anavar, Dianabol, Maxibolin, Methyltestosterone, Primobolin, and Winstrol (Santella 613.8). Types of Intravenous Steroids include Triamcinilone, Betamethasone, and Prednisone (Santella 613.8).   Teenagers are often users of Anabolic Steroids. Teens often acquire Anabolic Steroids from dealers at school, the Internet, or some types are even sold over the counter at local health stores. For that reason, a large amount of teenagers have access to the drug for their use. As for the reason teens use steroids, those who have admitted to taking them have said they used them to be better at sports, "fit in" or "be sexy" (Santella 613.8). Statistically, Male teens are more prone to use anabolic steroids than female teens, because males are more likely to try to get an advantage in sports. About 14% of athletes in the 12th grade were found to be using steroids, and about 13.3% of 10th grade were found to be using steroids (Santella 613.8).   Teens have even made up their own slang terms for Anabolic Steroids. Some of these names include "juice", "gum", "candy", "pumpers", and "pops".    "Arnolds", and "Stackers". Such slang terms can be used as "code names" in order to keep them secret from adults or authorities (Santella 613.8).

Then the science teacher saw us and grabbed the english teacher and told him to remain calm but he didn't so he started to beat up the science teacher, and the science teacher beated up him back. Later the police came and took him away. Should I switch schools?   Or should I just wait and see if they get fired?

20090220210628AASqYED	Education & Reference;Teaching	Please Help! Elementary School...question...?	I asked this earlier, but now that I got a yes response that it is possible for her to skip a grade can someone please tell me HOW? :( Long story, short version... I put my daughter in kindergarten 1 year late. Now at age 9 in 2nd grade (she should be in 3rd), I would like her to be placed in the appropriate grade for her age level next year. She has been in private school since preschool...2 yrs of preschool, followed by full-day kindergarten, and then 1st and now 2nd grade. Next year she will be attending public school. I called the student services office and the lady was not helpful and very rude, hence the reason I am on here. She quickly said no they don't do testing or move kids up. But, I am not asking them to advance my gifted child... I want her to be at her age-appropriate level. My daughter's age should have something to do with it, and also the public schools here only have halfday kindergarten of 2 1/2 hrs -- she had full day. She should be able to do the work, but it doesn't seem fair they won't even let her try. Does anyone know if this is controlled by the state? School district? Any help would be appreciated. As I said, the lady I spoke with is not helpful. Thank you. :) Oh, and we live in Sylvania, Ohio...if that info is helpful.
20090203092259AAwPK5W	Education & Reference;Higher Education (University +)	Could you please help me write a cover letter?	Hi! I'm writing a cover letter to apply for a bird banding internship. In the requirements they say " Strong applicants will have at least some passerine mist-net/banding experience".    Now I don't really have  much experience on that, but I did participate in a short workshop (half a day) on banding and misnetting . There I assisted the setting up of mist nets and removed some birds from them. As well, I got to band and release some of them.      What should I put in my cover letter? "I have some experience banding and mist netting" or "I have some minor experience banding and mist netting"   If I don't say minor I feel as I am lying, but if I do it might be a set back.    What do you think?   Thanks!

I stated:      "Yes, connecting two closely related sentences with a semicolon instead of a conjunction is a valid technique. But apparently the relationship can't be just sequence in time. (I hadn't realized this until I had to figure out WHY your example doesn't work.)"      Am I correct that a) the example is an incorrect use of a semicolon and b) my sequence-in-time explanation is the reason? I'm morally certain of a), but maybe 80% sure about b)!

My situation is that during my freshman year I did poorly on several classes because I did very poorly on several due to depression. I never really told anyone that I was depressed, people just thought that I was stupid or unmotivated and my parents thought I was on drugs. Eventually over the summer of my sophomore year I was able to come to terms with my depression and conquer it.  I asked my parents to send me to an academic boarding school to help me turn my grades around.  I now have around a 3.5 GPA as a senior however I have been rejected from the colleges that I would like to go too (Duke, Davidson, Dartmouth, Wake Forrest).  What I am wondering is if I can go back and retake those classes that I did poorly in to improve my GPA so that I can re-apply to those colleges next year?

20090220214522AAyw620	Education & Reference;Home Schooling	How do you go about homeschooling?	My son has a tremendous amount of problems at school and has had them since he started. We've tried everything under the sun, work closely with the all the schools he's attended and his teachers.      He has gone from a regular classroom to the most restricted enviornment, and nothing has helped. He is currently in a behavior unit and is only in the 1st grade, and will quite possibly repeat this year I fear that without some kind of intervention he will not learn anything because his behavior is so severe.      I'd like to give home schooling a shot, but clueless as to where to begin. I know it requires commitment, from the parents mostly and I do feel that because my husband and I both run a home based business we can do this rather than having to stop what we're doing to go sit in with him at school for basic stuff.       I'd appreciate some help from parents who have or are currently homeschooling their little ones.      Thanks in advance.
20090220220134AAuLrEv	Education & Reference;Words & Wordplay	Can someone edit this for me please? One paragraph?	Here it is. If you decide to help, don't use the word honesty ANYWHERE besides the last sentence. That needs to stay the same. And this is for a devotional for a program I'm in called Youth and Government. This is only part of the whole thing. Thanks a bunch!      "It is giving a value to truth. It is never telling a lie. It is being genuine and real to oneself and to others. It is being loyal, fair, and just. It reaches deep within each of us and forces us to act with sincerity and tell the truth during tough situations regardless of future judgment or condemnation. This has many saved lives, as well as destroyed some, but it is always the right thing. Without it, one is immoral and lost without a sense of guidance. It makes us worthy of trust when giving constructive criticism on another delegate’s bill, or helping a friend with his or her brief. It has saved lives, as well as destroyed them. With this small trait in our hearts, it helps us build stronger bonds with the people around us. It is a moral and ethical strength. The word is honesty."
