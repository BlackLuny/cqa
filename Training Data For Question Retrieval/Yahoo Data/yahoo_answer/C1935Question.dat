I turned the system off, then back on again and got the E74 error. I've been reading sites over the last hour and it points out that the AV cord may be the problem. I unplugged everything, but it still comes up. I'm not sending this piece of **** in for a second time and having to pay $100. I want to cause the system to get the 3 red rings. I've had it wrapped in 2 towels for the last hour and will turn it back on once it shuts off. Does anyone know another way to cause the 3 lights to come on so I can get it repaired for free? My warrenty expired. Big thanks to anyone that can help.

I suspect the website is trying to subscribe me to the movie's podcast, which was what was happening before I reformatted my PC and downloaded the new iTunes.      Do I need to change some settings in my PC or does the new iTunes have a bug which Apple needs to fix?

20060930224023AA9hZZ9	Consumer Electronics;Other - Electronics	Help hooking up cable box, vcr/dvd recorder, & tv... snowy picture?	I got a new entertainment center today, and the delivery guys took all my TV stuff apart...  Trying to hook it back up, I can't get a clear picture when I go through my VCR/DVD recorder.  The way I have it hooked up is wall to cable box, cable box to vcr/dvd recorder, vcr/dvd recorder to tv... and the picture's all fuzzy.  When I bypass the vcr/dvd recorder, I get a PERFECT picture.  Now everything worked fine before it was disconnected... just a few hours ago.  I went and bought new coaxial cables, I've tried using the RF cable that came with the vcr/dvd recorder.  If it helps, my TV is a Sony Trinitron KV-36XBR400 and the DVD/Video Cassette Recorder with HDD is an Emerson WEH100F.  I have tried to call my cable company and they tell me to bypass my DVD/VCR until they can send someone out to look at it... which is a week... HELP!!
