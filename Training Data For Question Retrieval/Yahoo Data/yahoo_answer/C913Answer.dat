A 60 pound text stock is equivalent to a 24 pound bond paper which many businesses use for letters and letterheads. A 70 pound text is which is equivalent to 28 pound bond paper is commonly used for newsletters and brochures.<br>  <br>  Card stock is heavier paper and sometimes referred to as cover stock is thicker and stiffer. This type of paper is used for business cards, invitations and postcards. It comes in varying weights as well.<br>  <br>  For flyers a 50 to 70 pound text weight paper is sufficient.<br>  <br>  A more important aspect than paper choice is the message on your flyer.

But you still need to find the legitimate ones. With all the scams on the internet you don’t want to waste you time or money.

I am currently receiving paid survey invitations from 20 paid survey sites that I have found there.<br>  <br>  At theguruseye they have 300+ survey sites you can join for free along with video reviews ( they tell you which ones pay by check and paypal) of these sites.

However, even for a part-time student enrolled in a university outside Canada, such a learning program must also include at least one course that lasts at least 13 consecutive weeks and leads to a degree.<br>  <br>  If you qualify, your school needs to fill out Form TL11A, Tuition, Education, and Textbook Amounts Certificate - University Outside Canada:<br>  <a href="http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/E/pbg/tf/tl11a/README.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/E/pbg/tf/tl11a/...</a>|`|nYnZr8AMaa	To claim tuition fees paid to a US college or university for part time studies, you must have lived in Canada near the border throughout the year and commuted to the school.<br>  <br>  If you qualify, you need to get the institution to complete form TL11C.<br>  <a href="http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/E/pbg/tf/tl11c/..." rel="nofollow">http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/E/pbg/tf/tl11c/...</a><br>  <br>  For more information refer to CRA pamphlet P105 "Students and Income Tax."<br>  <a href="http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/E/pub/tg/p105/R..." rel="nofollow">http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/E/pub/tg/p105/R...</a>|`|7HKTDcvYaa	You normally get a form from Canadian institutions of post secondary learning, But what is not clear in your question is whether you are using online filing.<br>  You do not have to have the forms for online filing, and you can use tuition for part time studies.

qLvhoRpsaa	A location is the only thing your question is missing. The U.S, Canada, Australia, where are you? It is different for each place. If you were in Canada, I could give you great links.<br>  <br>  Another tips is Google or Yahoo to search and using specific keywords like job banks, employment, work wanted, and so on. Each province(in Canada) has its own free government funded employment centres, job banks, workshops, training, employment counseling and is all provided for free. I would think that the U.S. would have something similar. <br>  <br>  Good Luck. <br>  <br>  Peace:)|`|3mAgM405aa	Here's a short list of jobs in the U.S., Canada and Europe which you can create to generate income:<br>  <br>  1. Learn calligraphy so that you can provide handwritten invitations and thank you notes to prospective wedding parties, birthday celebrations, etc. Seek out clients through wedding planners at nearby churches and temples. A starter calligraphy kit usually runs around $20 and anyone can easily pick up this skill. The going rate is usually $1 per hand addressed item.<br>  <br>  2. Seek from your neighbors a gardner position which involves planting, weed removal, plant/tree trimming, light brush clearance. You will be using the neighbor's equipment and tools. Again, do not represent yourself as a lawn mower since there are any number of safety issues involved. A door-to-door solicitation of surrounding neighbors is required and you can charge between $6 to $9 per hour.<br>  <br>  3. Offer policing/removal or clearance of trash services to surrounding neighbors which involve trash pickup within nearby residential area. Limit the extent of pickup to small areas and be aware that there are no hazardous terrain or elements involved in this process. Again, a door-to-door solicitation of neighbors is in order. You can charge between $6.75 to $7.50 per hour.<br>  <br>  4. Acquire a set of window cleaning tools [a bucket, liquid window cleaner, sponge, squeegee, handle with an extension and a small step ladder] and solicit local businesses for your window cleaning services. However, be careful to limit the height of the window cleaning to no higher than one story. Charge $1 per window panel.<br>  <br>  5. Visit your nearest beauty salon and ask to be trained as a shampoo person who is also willing to sweep up fallen hair on the ground and do set ups [arranging dye kits, curler holders, etc.] for a set hourly fee.<br>  <br>  6. Become a sign flipper by contacting your nearest realtor. A flipper is someone who stands at a major intersection and flips a "For Lease/Rental" sign in order to attract visitors to an open house or to a particular real estate listing. The hourly pay is at least the minimum wage.<br>  <br>  7. Why not become a paid feeder servicing the disabled at nearby nursing, convalescent, assisted living/care centers and hospitals. It involves feeding food to patients who are unable to feed themselves. The starting rate is $8.00 per hour. The only downside is that one has to take precautions to wash one's hands after each feeding. A posting of your services [by a business card or flyer] on a reviewable bulletin board would be enough to generate customers. The paid feeder position is one of the fastest growing occupation at this time.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|AA11197089	Follow up on your interviews to every place you had applied and let them know how flexible you can be.

Prep chef can be a hard job depending on where you are working, and to be a back up cook you would be expected to go into any kitchen and start running the place there and then, so if you want to be a chef you will need to start as a trainee, then you will progress to a commis chef and so on until you become a head chef or an executive chef

d9f5eef57376876109b9a113a7c9af2eaa	If you are going through the same temp agency - then your resume should NOT "look choppy" - the temp agency is your employer - not the businesses that you go to work in.  <br>  <br>  List the name of the temp agency on your resume, and how long you've been there.  you will look much more stable.  Then you can list underneath that the skills you've used while in their employ, and maybe the different positions you've held at clients' establishments.<br>  <br>  As for the clients not taking you full time...take their explanation at face value - that they were looking for a temp, but their current situation precludes them from taking on a full time employee.  The fact that it's "temp to hire" probably has more to do with a box they checked, leaving the option open, when they asked for a temp worker.  Don't take it personally.|`|TotgRmRZaa	the business world is cut throat.if they need you for 3-6 months as a temp,you are being exploited.these temp agencies do not want you to get a permanent job.|`|2PDBxlYDaa	Don't temp anymore. Most temp jobs are temporary which is why they call them temp jobs. A lot of businesses like to use them because then they don't have to convert you to full time and give you benefits. If I were you I would just list the last two places of employment or maybe just the last place because you were there for years and then apply for a permanent position elsewhere.<br>  <br>  A lot of companies lie to employees even to their own full time employees. So if I were you, I would research companies that you would like to work for, and then send in a new resume where you either list your last place of employment or the last two. When you go in to interview or get hired, be as professional as you possibly can. Its better to be overdressed than to be too casual.<br>  <br>  The employees want to know that you'll fit into to their company, so make sure that you say that in the interview. Say that you like the company and that you think its a perfect fit for you. Also you might want to go see a career counselor and ask them to give you constructive criticism, sometimes we can be blind to our weaknesses. But I really suggest that you quit taking temp jobs.<br>  <br>  Usually if an employer sees you have had one temp job, that's okay, but two and three are not cool. Temp jobs are fine for people in their twenties that didn't know what they wanted to do so they took them to try out different things. But if you want to be taken seriously then just stop taking them.|`|pHUsumU7aa	Screw that, I hate temp agencies. I think they make you look bad, and they say temp to perm just to get people in the positions. I'd make a resume and list the jobs you've had and make the temp agency invisible, just show your experience. <br>  Just my opinion, and it worked for me.

YOUR NOT GOING TO WORK THIER FOREVER AS THEY HAVE MAJOR PROBLEMS! so your relationship is going to end eventually, so you had better end it on your terms!!!! call the state of california, and talk to the state labor folks that handle labor laws, wages, and laws that protect workers in the state of california!! good luck!!!! that fact that they didnt pay you is outrageous!!! and they can be in deep **** for this as the state can penalize them for not following state employment laws, you should be paid the wage agreed etc. the state can sanction them and take their workmans comp insurance away etc. call the state asap!!!!

Unfortunately, you probably cannot secure a job in computer programming or repair without a degree.

I cashed checks at 10.<br>  The issue is having an account to put the money in, to get cash without waiting, you need to take it back to the bank it was written on.  government checks are the exception.  Things will be much easier if you have an account like I did.  I sold straw at the fair for animal bedding.  I was 10, I bailed it, and dad hauled it to town for me.  When people bought the straw the check was made out to me, I deposited them and paid dad back for gas, twine or wire, equipment repairs and other consumable, I got to keep the rest.<br>  Checks I put in from out of the area had to wait for them to clear, checks written on the same bank I had my account at were credited to my account upon deposit if the check was good.  If it wasn't good, I had to call the people and ask when it would be good or if there was another way they would prefer to pay.

lbX75d1xaa	I bought a house that I could afford.  It is nothing fancy - it is modest.  I only did remodeling that I could afford, and bought very little furniture.  I was very careful with my money in other matters.  I paid my mortgage on time, and whenever I could I paid extra to the mortgage.  I got my 12 year mortgage paid off in 8 years. Now I own my simple, cozy, house outright.  <br>  <br>  And apparently I am now going to be paying for other people's houses that are much nicer than mine?
5Af6j1qsaa	Perhaps you consider yourself responsible with your own money, but you haven't shown any responsibility with anyone else's money.<br>  <br>  Credit is basically borrowing someone else's money to purchase goods and services that you either can't afford now, or you don't have enough cash in your wallet to do so at the moment.  When you repay the money that was loaned to you, the company that loaned the money will report to the credit bureau that you repaid your debt as agreed.  The longer and the more you use credit, the more trustworthy you become.<br>  <br>  Suppose you have a brother and a sister.  Your brother has borrowed money from you in the past and usually pays you back late.  Your sister, on the other hand, borrows regularly and always pays on time.  They both approach you and ask if they can borrow $500 from you.  Who do you think is more responsible and deserving of the $500...your brother or your sister?<br>  <br>  Because you have never borrowed money, no one knows if you're the kind of person who will pay late or not repay the loan at all.  You can certainly get through life without using credit, but you will have to save up your money to buy expensive things such as houses and cars.  People who use credit, on the other hand, borrow money to buy the houses and cars right now, and then they slowly repay their debt.  Would you spend 5 years taking the bus (along with several transfers) while you save money for a car, or would you rather borrow money to buy a car now and then just pay it off for the next 5 years?  Would you rather save money for 40 years to buy a house, or would you rather borrow money to buy a house now, and then slowly pay it off for the next 40 years?<br>  <br>  People who don't want to use credit fall into several categories:  (1) They don't really know how the credit system works, (2) they irresponsibly used credit in the past and it burned them, (3) they have simple needs and don't need to buy anything that they can't afford.<br>  <br>  You admitted that you don't use credit.  Personally, I wouldn't loan you $50 even if you promised to pay it back next week.  As I mentioned before, you don't borrow money, so I can't trust you since you have no history.|`|z88IMXNFaa	I agree with much of David's answer.  I think the reason that people who don't use credit are seen as fools is that the world doesn't work on cash.  And someday, you are going to want a house and you're going to be shocked and horrified that you can't get a mortgage because you haven't got a credit record.  It is just as easy to get credit and use it wisely to build up a credit score as it is to live a cash existence.  And the benefit of choice number 1 is that you are building a record for your future.

When the paper statement arrives, write a check or use one of your credit card's convenience checks.<br>  <br>  "I have a credit card and pay with my debit/credit card all the time."  <---  Paying off credit card debts with another credit card is what gets alot of people into trouble.  The interest then becomes principal, and so on and so forth.<br>  <br>  You can call the credit card company since they should have 24/7 customer service.  However, I doubt they'll let you access someone else's account, even to pay it.|`|KPmfrevlaa	ur stupid. let him pay it|`|8sCrSqJqaa	Pay him the money so he can deposit it into his bank account and pay the card from there. It's the simplest and easiest way. <br>  <br>  Extra notes:<br>  There is also a way to add another name onto the same credit card, and then you can both pay. But then one of you could really screw up the other person's credit rating. The simplest thing is to keep financial things separate, and pay each other the money. Even in a marriage it might be a smart idea. Because otherwise things get abused, unnoticed by the abuser, but building up a lot of hidden negative emotions in the other person. It's very rare that people equally spend. If you think your commitment in the relationship is at the level where you're ready to pool your resources together as a family, with complete openness and trust, and a common unity, and you find yourself always agreeing on how to spend money, which is rare, then you could do a two name credit card. But there are very successful and lasting relationships and marriages where people disagree on things such as how to spend money, and each have separate accounts, and regular transfers between them - but they maturely learn to absorb disagreements and still be happy together.|`|Pur8Ghc8aa	I wouldn't pay for his bills.

You also need to focus on how and where you want to sell your goods. Business loans are hard to come buy today so you are likely to be on your own.<br>  <br>  I started a woodworking business by making things and selling them at craft fairs.  It took me a couple of years to find out what people wanted to buy and to get good enough at woodworking to command a premium over my competition which was Chinese made goods.

I got my MA dergee 1st. i love it in the medical feild u can work  side by side with the nurse in most case's not one even knows the diff. u get paid less of corse. in most places dr offices are choseing to hire MA's instead because the can do the same job for less pay. the good thing about MA's is u r versital u can do ins. billing and coding, to filing, to giving shots and drawling blood its a good place to get ur foot in the door to deside do ilike the office part and being involed with medical or am a more hands on type? dont like the office? you learn medical trancripiong in the class also! u've seen those adds work from home? some dr records his voice into a recorder (his visit notes) then pays u a whole buttload to type them up verbatim. <br>  <br>  <br>  pay rangers between $9- $12 (in OKLAHOMA) <br>  the tuition for mine was total under $4000 and i got a pell grant to pay for most. and a scolarship to pay the rest.|`|WniOOchkaa	The best thing to do is call the schools and call where you would like to potentially work for to get accurate information.  Just write down questions you want to ask and they should be more than willing to answer them.  Medical laws are different in every state and pay is different region to region.  Also, what do you really want to do in the medical field?  I found out that I the next state over I couuld have worked as a respiratory tech and get paid almost the same as a therapist and been hired as a therapist after graduating.  Just check around.

I've seen kids as young as 14 doing dishes in the back.  They usually are not chain restaurants and looking for some part time/extra help.  However! There should be no reason you have any trouble getting a job at 17.  I guess the issues a lot of people would face in hiring a 17 year old would be maturity.  So make sure you have a nice resume, good references (not a relative or a friend preferably), and present yourself well (properly dressed).  That might help people feel less nervous.  Regardless, your age should not stop you from being hired =)|`|hzxplycYaa	Typically, 17 to host and 18 to be a waitress/waiter.<br>  <br>  I know Lucille's BBQ, Pat & Oscars, Chick Fil A may hire you but as you can see we are obviously in an economical crisis.

9c7d64a28e8acf14270f5aa9f8e3e1e0aa	You have to understand how the shortsale works....short sales are very, very difficult to get approved to start with...every rarely do they go below the list price.<br>  <br>  The appraisal value that the appraiser came up with has NOTHING to do with the short sale...it is to determine fair market value.  <br>  <br>  So, if the home appraised for $112K then you CANNOT offer more than that unless you are bringing $13,000 cash to overpay for the place...so my question to you, is why would you do that?<br>  <br>  Your contract should have an appraisal contingency (I sure hope you didn't waive that), that if it comes in for less, there are three options:<br>  <br>  1. The seller drops their price. (this is what usually happens in a short-sale situation).<br>  <br>  2.  You can walk away at this point (unless you were foolish enough to waive the appraisal contingency).<br>  <br>  3.  You can bring the difference to closing...which anyone would be a fool to do.<br>  <br>  Your bank should have done the appraisal that you were getting financing through....I find it very, very scary that you had no idea of who did the appraisal.|`|7HKTDcvYaa	Appraisal was done when? If it is appraised for 112,000 offer them that amount. You should expect to be asked to put in a significant down payment at that price.|`|tIUfOJyHaa	we have a similar situation in our area. Homes in certain price ranges are becoming extremely hard to get - not to find but to get them into an accepted contract. There are a lot of cash buyers out there and they are "bargain hunting". Of course the short selling or foreclosing bank wants always the highest and best offer. Sometimes the bank will go with a lower offer just because the buyer offers cash and a fast closing.<br>  <br>  Here is your dilemma. You are competing against those Cash buyers already, you can not or don't want to offer cash, you are going for 100% financing and probably you can not close earlier than 4 weeks from the day you signed the contract.<br>  <br>  Now you need to give the short selling  bank something which makes your offer better than the offer of the cash buyer. - Here apparently the only way you can do is increase the offer price or in your case pick up the closing costs.<br>  <br>  However, should you go this route make sure you get a closing cost estimate, so you know exactly what you are dealing with. Also if the house "only" appraised for 112,000 there is no room for you to include the closing costs into your mortgage. I guess you need to offer the $ 112,000 and include the closing costs and keep your fingers and toes crossed.|`|qsqmykzsaa	If you have already signed purchase contracts, you can not negotiate with the price.<br>  the price is the purchase price.<br>  It is not unusual for a valuation to come in at less than the purchase price.<br>  Banks are very conservative now. <br>  you will have to find the money yourself.<br>  If you haven't signed, then you can negotiate.<br>  good luck with it all.
tIUfOJyHaa	Not because I am a Realtor but I think the best way to go is to consult a local Realtor. They know where to ask those questions and they know about certain areas and the probably issues with certain lots. Also if you want to write an offer make the offer contingent on: build able land, permitting, utilities and so on. Also give yourself some time and write the offer contingent on a due diligence period with enough time that you can get all answers on your questions. The City or County is the best source to get the information you need  - but like I mentioned above, a Realtor can do all of this for you.|`|qsqmykzsaa	You just need to speak with your local authority, power, water, and speak to the council about a building permit as well.<br>  There could already be a Planning Permit issuid on the land. This means you definately can build on it.

A prospective landlord might want to do a credit check on you before they agree to rent the apartment to you.<br>  It's a form you fill out and sign and may cost you an additional $20 to $60 bucks to get the credit check done.<br>  <br>  You should have the funds to cover first month rent and security deposit and you will need money to turn your utilities, garbage, phone and cable on.<br>  <br>  Moving into a new place can cost you anywhere from a couple of thousand dollars upwards....

A debit card will not work.<br>  <br>  I think they also add a day to draw intrest off of our money, but that is my wild opinion.<br>  <br>  Also, you don't have to send the money directly to paypal out of your account to pay for something. They will take it out of the account when you make a payment.   You have funding options after you log in to paypal when you are trying to pay.  You just click on the bank account that you want it to come out of.

MbzyriZ4aa	Go to "rippoffreport.com" and enter Persels and Associates...<br>  <br>  Here is one of the complaints copied from that site:<br>  <br>  I got seriously ill in 2007 and had to have emergency surgery with no medical insurance... I struggled with bills, lived off credit cards until finally in September of 2008 I was desperate and started looking for a way out of my financial mess... I turned to CareOne Credit first, they took a payment from me of $426.00 on October 15, 2008 and I immediately started receiving refusal letters from my creditors (but amazingly never received any of my money back). <br>  <br>  Since my creditors refused their debt management plan, CareOne suggested I use their partners Persels & Associates, LLC a debt settlement plan. I was told that my creditors would be more amenable to this program due to the fact that it was run by attorneys. The way the program was explained was that I would make a monthly payment, they would send cease and desist letters, that I should not contact them or pay them, that if they contacted me I should give them the toll free number they gave me.<br>  <br>  Now my wages are being garnised $228.00 every 2 weeks, I have another creditor who will be garnishing me next. A third creditor that I pulled off of the list from Persels. I called Persels to cancel my service and they told me there was a $150.00 cancellation fee, and there is only $92.00 in my account. They took $258.00 on November 15, 2008; $158.00 on December 15, 2008; and $218.70 on January 15, 2009. Now I ask you, how come there is only $92.00 in my account? When I called them about the Garnishment they told me they couldn't help me, and it would take years before they could pay any of my creditors.<br>  <br>  Please don't use these people, you're better off calling your creditors and working with them personally. Honestly, Persels & Associates will destroy your life. <br>  <br>  Kathleen<br>  Gladstone, Oregon<br>  U.S.A.
g4nlUfmeaa	At some point in running a business of any real size, you're going to have to rely on credit of some sort.  And rather than get into a career just for the sake of money (so you have the capital to make more money doing what you really want to do), you may be better off raising capital by seeking investors.  Most careers that reliably make a lot of money require a lot of school, which probably means taking on some debt in the form of student loans ... which defeats your purpose.<br>  <br>  Some jobs pay pretty well while requiring little schooling.  I'm told that air-traffic controllers are one, as are certain civil service jobs (including law enforcement).  I personally looked into becoming a Radiographer for a while, which is a 2-3 year vocational program.  Nurses, of course, also make fairly excellent pay.<br>  <br>  Then there are jobs that require little to no schooling, but may require some combination of great skill, hard work or luck.  These are often jobs where you're paid on commission.  If you want to invest in real estate, perhaps it'd be a good idea to try your hand as a real estate agent.  You can get an idea of how the business works, and if you excel, you may be able to make a lot more money a lot sooner than you would if you went the traditional route of attending college for 4-5 years.<br>  <br>  Or if you do plan on going to school, you could always major in business to learn some of the skills that will serve you well as an entrepreneur, and operate as some sort of middle-manager after you graduate (which may be a good education in itself) while you save to realize your ambitions.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|NtIOVAxkaa	That is your problem , if you want to make money you don`t need to work......look the Banks , Wall Street , Politicians.<br>  Now if you want a paycheck then you need to choose a career.|`|2tdokuWvaa	Im guessing you want something that's legal?

AA10392539	Hi. You need to look at the specific tenancy agreement which you signed at the beginning of the tenancy. Most landlords/tenants use the standard 'Residential Tenancy Agreement' drawn up by 'The Department of Building and Housing' (a government agency) and approved for use by 'The Office of The Tenancy Tribunal'. If you have signed this agreement then please refer to section seven - Rights of Entry. The agreement permits the landlord to enter the premises in order to inspect it at any time between the hours of 8am and 7pm provided 48 hours notice is given. I'm afraid it doesn't have to be any more precise than that. If you have signed a different form of agreement then look at your copy and I'm sure you will find a similar section specifying the various rights of entry. <br>  <br>  In my experience most landlords/agents understand a tenant's concerns about unsupervised entry, and so I suggest you call and try to come to a more specific arrangement. Hopefully, they will be able to accommodate you. But, in the final analysis, the property does belong to them and they can enforce the terms agreed in the tenancy agreement. Good luck.|`|cLJT3yZNaa	I think it would be illegal for them to enter if you were away. They will have to come when you are home.

Thanks to rip off stores like Walmart running actual decent discount grocery stores out of business here and then jacking up their prices to match the high cost grocery stores, food costs in my household rose well over $100 a week in less than six months!  And that's buying the low quality generic junk that tastes like crap!<br>  <br>  OK...well, quit smoking, clip coupons, pay off debt as quickly as possible, be energy efficient (ie. hang clothes out rather than using the clothes dryer, unplug the electronics not in use, and let your hair air dry rather than using a dryer and styling tools)...walk or ride a bike when you can rather than driving...buy energy efficient bulbs and make sure to shut the lights off when you're not in the room...find out what you can use as cleaning products around the house rather than paying for expensive products (for instance, a dollop of mayo on a water ring on your furniture keeps you from buying new, and vinegar is a great odor remover, etc.)...recycle what you can, and try flea markets and thrift stores before buying overpriced furniture from a furniture store.<br>  <br>  Sadly, I had plans to fix my place up so I wouldn't pay yet another $1800 in three months for propane like I did this winter...but that won't happen now thanks to everything going to crud at once (truck now needs three things fixed...hundreds of dollars and it's not even paid off), so saving isn't in my future anytime soon!<br>  <br>  Hope you have more luck than I do!|`|7XCXVoNhaa	You can find useful information about this problem in my source site|`|NtIOVAxkaa	I will buy SALT ...because not even gold will work.|`|4f3GfrN6aa	I don't think there will be another Great Depression.  People and institutions learned their lesson back then, and have been applying it ever since.  I haven't heard of mass suicides yet because people are broke. <br>  <br>  Think about what it means to be broke now, as opposed to what broke meant during the 1930s?  Our standard of living has increased dramatically.  We have electricity in our homes as a standard.  We have plenty of clothing, even if we are poor.  <br>  <br>  I think practical frugal living will be the only strategy to benefit people during the coming recession.  I predict this recession will last maybe nine months at the most.  Be aware that as of now, it still isn't officially a recession in many countries.  A recession is 2 quarters with a GDP decline of 10%, and many countries aren't anywhere near that yet, so a world Depression is a long way off.<br>  <br>  My advice is live within your means and save 10% of your income.  I seriously doubt that it'll come to a barter economy, but if you're concerned, start growing your own vegies to sell to others.  It's always good to have your own home grown food.<br>  <br>  Don't buy anything new.  If you need something, get it secondhand.  On one hand, you'll be getting it cheap, and on the other, you'll be supporting charities, who need our help.<br>  <br>  I think you're overreacting about inflation.  People and the economy in most developed countries will just have to adjust.  It isn't as bad as people are making out.  They just had a very good boom a year ago and that's what they are comparing it to.  Booms don't last forever, and neither do recessions.|`|bfe4ad38e28ddda61b321173866c1f9aaa	What I am trying to do is pay off my debt as fast as I can to free up more money when the Democrats in Congress cause inflation.

That means that your tax liability will be directly reduced by $8,000 for this tax year.  Just make sure you get a reputable real estate agent and loan officer.

AA12074269	I'm amazed at many of the answers - you mentioned that you were in Australia but they immediately mentioned the things to need to study in AMERICA. Australia is not America!!!!!! We dont have MCATs, pre-med, students able to go to fire stations for training (THATS St JOHNS)<br>  Maybe they need to learn comprehension!!<br>  <br>  Well, to answer your question. It depends on your state. Medicine is fast becoming a postgrad only degree so you will need to complete a BSc first (which has no humanity component, but you would be advised to study zoology, biochemistry, microbiology and animal based subjects - for Vet science and Biochemistry, Micro, Anatomy, Physics and chemistry for Medicine). There are still a few unis where it is an undergraduate degree (6 years)<br>  <br>  Vet Science is still an undergraduate degree but not all states teach it so it may involve relocation. For Vet Science you needed a 99.2 to get in for USyd. Medicine was a 99.4. I think Murdoch (in WA) was a bit lower but you will need over 98 to get into undergraduate medicine and pass the interview. The interview is not easy - in Adelaide some years ago the states #1 student failed the interview and didnt get into medicine. <br>  <br>  Salaries are as varied as pizzas. There is a misdistribution of doctors in  Australia - there are many out of work doctors in the capital cities and many vacant positions in rural and country towns. There are a large number of medical grads who are leavinig medicine almost as soon as they graduate to go into research instead. So dont pigeon hole yourself too soon.<br>  <br>  Plastic surgery is a speciality and will require 6+ years ontop of the standard degree - wait and see what you feel like in a couple of years.<br>   <br>  If you havent started HSC - choose Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry.|`|wvDh3PdFaa	if you want to be doctor someday concentrate studying more on science,like human anatomy and physiology,microbiology,zoology,clinical pharmacology,and many more sujects in science. you need study english because if you plan to go to different places it is a means of communication , english is an international language spoken so good luck in your future endeavor.|`|5Z90vsGJaa	obviously every college in this world requires all their students to take the basic core classes of math, language, social science and natural science. sometimes with disciplines in humanities, fine arts, and physical education. <br>  <br>  since you want to be more medically-bound, start concentrating on subjects like human anatomy and physiology, histology, cytology, animal physiology, medical microbiology, mycology, vertebrate histology, zoology, biology, chemistry, organic chemistry, pharmacology, pathophysiology, disorders, genetics, biochemistry, physics, calculus, statistics, psychology, sociology, and maybe other enrichment courses such as logic and philosophy.|`|3cBeyNWxaa	Ever major or degree you're going to undertake in ANY college requires the basic courses of English, Mathematics, Humanities, plus several others depending on the school.<br>  <br>  Contrary to popular belief, if ever you're contemplating a career in medicine, you don't really need to take heavy science courses for your undergraduate degree to get into medicine or veterinary (yes, you need an undergraduate degree). You're better off taking a degree you're best interested in and do best in them rather than a heavy science degree with B's on them, or even worse.. C's. There are even surveys where most of their first year med students were history, philosphy, or humanities majors!<br>  <br>  My advice: Don't get stressed too much about these things, concentrate first on your interesting undergraduate degree and do best and then you can worry about those grad degrees. You don't want to miss the joys of being an undergrad and science free while being in an undergraduate setting.|`|NhnEtII3aa	I would start by looking into volunteering at your local fire department as an e.m.t. most have classes that way you can see if you are the type of person or have the mentality for the medical profession.

HJHfKpspaa	Yes definitely leave books!!!!! Many, Many years ago when I sold Avon, I left the books everywhere I went. Doctors, dentists, lawyers, restaurants, hospitals, apartment building lobbies, laundromats and every home I visited and well anywhere I went! For the first few campaigns I bought at least 40 books each time. <br>  <br>  After you have left them and people start calling for orders, ask them where they found your book at. Then you will know exactly where people saw them and where you should leave them again. I found that by the third campaign I was off and running and had a good list of customers. <br>  <br>  Avon can be a good source of income if you get up to district manager or sign people up under you. Although be careful that you are not your biggest customer or you'll spend all your profits on yourself! hehehee!

The critical thinking skills you can in philosophy or poli-sci are not the same as problem solving skills.

They sometime cancel accounts like this although I've never experienced it and I pay my accounts off every month.|`|5BmnSiqUaa	.<br>  There's only two major ways any credit card affects your score:<br>  <br>  1) How long have you had the credit card?  <br>  (The longer, the better.

You only need two.)<br>  <br>  2) How much UNUSED credit do you have available? <br>  (The larger, the better.  That's why it's a good idea to ask for a credit limit increase from time to time - IF you never use it.)<br>  <br>  That's it.<br>  <br>  All else is fairy dust.<br>  <br>  So, to answer your question, paying off your card in full is good because it gives you 100% unused, available credit.<br>  <br>  Good Luck.<br>  <br>  .|`|MbzyriZ4aa	It is not bad to pay it off in full every month.<br>  <br>  What is "bad" is to charge more than 30% of your credit limit every month or even max out the card in full every month....

Only use the card up to 30% of it's limit and then pay it off in full before you charge again. That will keep your score up.|`|Pur8Ghc8aa	Uhh, if you pay it off, you don't pay interest charges.

It is best done with a local bank you deal with directly rather than on the Internet.|`|Pur8Ghc8aa	Ok, when if you do get a credit card, and you don't pay them, it's only going to hurt your credit score even more.  Why are you even worried about a "get into debt" score?<br>  <br>  The best way to clean it up is to pay off those bad debts.  Then once you do, don't go into debt again.  Just pay cash.  You'll look a lot cooler and a lot more responsible when you're out with your friends and you take out a $20 bill to pay for a meal and not a Orchard Bank $300 limit credit card.<br>  <br>  Oh, and banks really aren't issuing credit all that much now adays.  With Obama raising taxes on small businesses, there's going to be a lot more layoffs, and with that comes people unable to pay their bills.|`|MbzyriZ4aa	First... get a copy of your credit report at www.annualcreditreport.com.<br>  <br>  Just to see whether your unpaid cell phone contracts ended up on your credit report as delinquent accounts...<br>  <br>  If they are on your report you need to figure out a way to pay off that debt.<br>  <br>  To start getting a credit card go to your bank and deposit $500 into a savings account and ask them to issue you a secured credit card that reports to the credit bureaus. They will "freeze" the money in your savings account and issue you a secured card with a $500 credit limit.<br>  Don't confuse this card with a prepaid card. It is real and the $500 you gave them is only a security deposit in case you screw up so that they don't lose any money.<br>  <br>  Use that card for only small purchases up to $50 a month and pay that off immediately when the bill comes. After a year or so you should be able to get an unsecured card since you have had a years worth of hopefully positive payment history on your credit report.|`|YpUoqVfTaa	Try:<br>  <br>  1) www.creditone.com<br>  <br>  2)www.orchardbank.com<br>  <br>  They prob give you a credit card!but you might have to pay a fee first.

Get an extension from whomever you owe.|`|SK2gGFoyaa	In all honesty the only thing that I can think of is for you to sell something that you already have. Only you can decide if the value of what you have to sell is worth whatever it is you want or need the money for. Any kind of traditional employment is not going to earn you $500 in a couple of days.|`|anHLJesKaa	You're going to have to do several things at once.  Since I don't know what area of the country you live in, nor do I know what skills/resources you have,I will be guessing.  But here are a few things to look into.  <br>  1. Do you have anything that you can sell on Craig's List - electronics, jewelry, musical instruments.  I suggest Craig's List because you don't have time for a bidding process and you'll still get more money than with a pawn shop. <br>  2.  Day labor - we have companies here like Labor Ready who pay for day laborers and pay at the end of the day. <br>  3. Special skills - proposal writing, technical writing, computer repair, landscaping.  Once again - using something like Craig's List or posting ads at your local grocer.  Our grocery stores have community bulletin boards where you can post jobs or items for sale.  <br>  4. Pay day loans - here you can get a payday loan and pay it back when you get your next check, hence the term - payday loan.  <br>  5. Pawn shops will take pretty much anything - jewelry, video games, lawn mowers and other lawn equipment, etc.  The only thing they won't take is computers, I believe.  <br>  6. If you need money for rent,food or utilities and you are eligible - your state may have grants in lieu of long term assistance.  Check with your local Department of Social and Human Services office.  <br>  <br>  That's all I can think of - you can sell something, provide a much needed service, borrow or get public assistance.  Hope I've helped in someway.  Good luck|`|YpUoqVfTaa	1) Sell yo momma's T.V.<br>  <br>  #2) Go to quick loan center, they can loan u $500, if u have a job!<br>  <br>  #3) be a prostitute, stripper, they make tons of money
nYnZr8AMaa	Accounting rules require that financial assets such as equity investments in other firms be classified as either Available For Sale (AFS) or Held For Trading (HFT).  The difference between these two classifications is the method of accounting for unrealized gains and losses due to changes in market value.  Unrealized Gains and losses on AFS assets are recognized as Other Comprehensive Income, that is to say they are not included in Net Income; whereas with HFT assets, the gains and losses are included in Net Income.

Why buy a car now if you can't use it yet?<br>  <br>  If you still want to get a car now, you'll have to let your dad buy it (by getting his own auto loan and you co-signing for it).  Then, when your credit is better, you can refinance the auto loan and remove your dad's name from the loan.  The transfer of vehicle ownership/registration in the DMV will be easy since it is occurring between immediate family members.
63e413147f262ec68d5946ef36ffb354aa	1. After 4 months you will owe them more than the $900.  There will be late fees and they may get a new judgment against you because you stopped making payment.  They do not believe the adage "you can't get blood out of a turnip" They will squeeze you for every penny they can get. They are not nice people so do not treat them as if they were.  They could care less if you feed your kids or pay your rent.<br>  2. If you can avoid getting a bank account or any credit cards you may prevent them from finding you. If you have a phone in your name, they can find you.  If your landlord did a credit check on you, they can find you.  If you now have an Internet connection in your name, they can find you.<br>  How fast I can not say.  It depends on the size of their business and how busy they are.  They may not chase you as hard as others because $1000 is not that much in their world.<br>  <br>  Keep your head down and hope for the best.

When you pay them do it with a money order and keep the receipt for the money order.<br>  <br>  Good Luck.

If your family medical emergency fell under the Family Medical Leave Act.  Which means you have been employed for a minimum of one year and worked 1,250 hours and the organization has at minimum 50 employees since the previous calendar year (2008.)  And again if the family emergency fell under the FMLA criterium. If not.  Unfortunately, nothing illegal unless you are leaving something out.|`|nyqoPvL2aa	This is going to depend heavily on which state you are in... the laws that control the circumstances under which companies can hire & fire vary widely from state to state. Some states basically say that the company can lay anyone off for any reason at all, without having to justify their decision. In a state like that, the best you could hope for is to convince the unemployment people that you were not laid off due to fault of your own, and therefore you get to collect unemployment insurance payments.<br>  If your state has stricter controls it'll be easier to argue your case... but chances are good that you still won't be able to get your old job back. Even if it's legally viable, the costs would be prohibitive. So the best is to probably have your file amended so that you were laid off, not fired for cause (since there doesn't really seem to be cause).

5Gxll9Hkaa	Yes.  It depends upon (a) how your attorney writes your Ch 13 Plan and (b) local practice in the court in which you file.<br>  <br>  Many attorney advise adjusting your withholdings on Form W-4 (or adjusting your estimated tax payments, if applicable) so that the amount withheld during the year is very close to the amount of taxes you will actually owe.  In otherwords, don't have a lot over-withheld, and then it won't matter whether your refund (or part of your refund) goes to the trustee or not, not to mention that you will have the money yourself - as it is earned - rather than lending it interest free to the IRS until you receive your refund.  If you want to save a little out of every paycheck, arrange for an automatic transfer into a savings account rather than using over-withholding (resulting in a large refund) of taxes as a savings mechanism.

His sister in law did too. Now he has a business and she works for him. She never thought her investments would tank in the first year or two of retirement.<br>  <br>  I have no pensions at all so will be living on investments. I will be 62 in 13 months and my investments lost 50%. I am lucky to have a good job where people work even when they are old. The woman I replaced was 71 and the old chairman for the board is the father of the current one, the current one is 66.

12VQ4ETcaa	Don't say anything to your employer until you have a firm offer for another job.  If you want a different role at the same place, go to your supervisor and say that you're interested in exploring your potential with the company.<br>  <br>  It's definitely best to have an employer as a reference, especially when your experience is somewhat short.  One's first job is always crummy.  Hang in there.

Personally I used to write a nice friendly (generally personal) e-mail, then attach both a covering letter and a CV.  Look at university websites as most have sample CVs and covering letters, both of which will give you the edge.  Avoid typing 'covering letter' into google and using the first template that comes up.  I cannot begin to imagine how many letters must be virtually the same.

BcVAWOCLaa	If you are an option player, I would sell puts on a lot of commodities.  I have found that there are always suckers out there that buy some really bad options.  For example, put on oil @ 55 when it was 70…..sold over 2,000. Dumb people….oh well.<br>  <br>  As you know, when playing options, you don’t necessarily want a stock “to tank” but just show a lot of movement.   I like to play shorter term options that are in the money.  If you bought an option that was going to expire in 2 weeks, and it is already in the money….the momentum of the stock will generally force the price in that direction (up or down).  For example, Call AMZN May 38 @3.5 on 4-23-07.  Stock was 3 pts in the money.   With the momentum you would have exercised @ 68ish.  Also, Call XOM May 75 @ 3, exercised at 84ish. <br>  <br>  I found that with options it is like a casino.  The house will always win (in the long run).  90% of options expire worthless.  If you want to make some good money in options, I would write a ton of options.  The only problem is that you need to keep a lot of money in the margin account to write calls.  A lot of broker/dealer won’t write uncovered options for clients.  I am limited to how many I can write and I don’t know if I could get approval from my compliance department to write an uncovered options for clients.  The risk outweighs the reward 10 fold, but at the end of the day 90% expire worthless.     <br>  <br>  Look for trends with technical analysis.  I have also seen the sub prime stock starting to bounce back, but there is still a lot of uncertainty there (might be a good play).

If you want to figure out whats risky just look at the chart. Stock that move less than 3% each day on average is a "safer" stock/commodity. Stock that move 5,10%. . .  and upward each day are risky.

eACZ1Rhjaa	Don't do it, now is the worst time for that. The only reason to rent to own is skyrocketing prices when you are a little short on money for closing. <br>  <br>  You will pay extra each month for the option and if you don't buy you lose that money. The owner has no obligation to not borrow money on house you are renting so could owe more than it is worth and not be allowed a short sale. He might also have the house foreclosed on and you could be evicted and not recover your option money.<br>  <br>  Go ahead and rent then save your money for buying on your own.|`|il36RWQDaa	The only thing that I know of, is owner financed rent to own.

Ak3ryEmyaa	nope,they will run a backround check! good jobs are tough to come by with a felony these days.
xoqQbHi1aa	Please do not consolidate. It is not free, they will lower your payments by increasing the length of time until you are debt free, and you will take a hit on your credit score. Or they negotiate your debt down after telling you not to pay for awhile adding another hit to your credit score. There is a better way.<br>  <br>  A. Have a garage sale and sell anything that you no longer need or want.<br>  <br>  B.Get a temporary part time job, if you have one, get another. <br>  <br>  <br>  Here is a plan that can help you. If you work the plan, the plan will work for you:<br>  1. Make a budget. Make the budget a week before you get paid. A budget is not a punishment! It is a tool which will free you from ever having to worry about money again. Put everything in your budget. Especially those annual, biannual, or quarterly bills like car registration, insurance, etc. Give every dollar you are going to bring home the name of where it is going. Add an "emergency fund" category to your budget for 25 dollars and save up until you have 1000-1250 dollars. Your emergency fund will help keep you from getting into new debt because of an emergency. If you can, set up a direct transfer to a savings account for your emergency fund. That way it moves automatically and you don't even have to worry about it. You must cut your spending and live on less than you make.<br>  <br>  2.First get current on all of you debts and make no more late payments. Stop using your credit cards immediately. Do not take on any more debt. Credit cards are like quicksand only the death is much slower. Make a list of all of your debts in order of highest interest rate to lowest interest. Use cash only for your spending from now on.<br>  <br>  3.Pay the minimum due on all of your debts and then put your extra money towards paying off the highest interest one first. After you get that one paid off, you put the money you were paying on debt #1 (the minimum payment and the extra payment) towards debt #2. That will pay debt #2 off faster. When that is paid off, you put all three payments towards card #3 and that one will be paid off pretty quickly. As an example:<br>  <br>  To start :<br>  Debt #1 (highest interest): minimum payment+ extra payment<br>  Debt #2 (middle interest): minimum payment<br>  Debt #3(lowest interest): minimum payment<br>  <br>  Debt #1: paid off<br>  Debt #2: minimum payment from Debt #1+ Minimum payment from Debt #2 +extra payment<br>  Debt #3: minimum payment<br>  <br>  Debt #1: paid off<br>  Debt #2: paid off<br>  Debt #3:Mimimum payment from card #1+ minimum payment from Debt #2+ minimum payment from Debt #3+ extra payment.<br>  <br>  That way, you will get them all paid off, on time, and pay the least interest. It will also help towards rebuilding your credit since you will no longer have any late payments. This works no matter how many different debts you may have.<br>  <br>  4. After you get all of your debts paid off, add to your emergency fund until you have 6-12 months of income saved up. Put that emergency fund money into a liquid money market fund or into a Bank of America no-risk CD so that if you need the money you can take it out without penalty.<br>  <br>  5a. When you have your emergency fund in place, add a category for "fun" to your budget. Save for a holiday, a vacation, a big screen, or dinners out, whatever goal you want. Remember to enjoy your life.<br>  <br>  5b. When you have your emergency fund in place, start saving for your retirement. Join the 401(k) plan at work and contribute the maximum. Your employer probably matches at least part of your contribution so why give up free money? Open a Roth IRA and contribute the maximum on a monthly basis. If you start saving for your retirement now, you will probably retire a millionaire.<br>  <br>  5c. When you have your emergency fund in place, start saving for your next car. Only buy cars, or other things that depreciate, with cash. Save up for a nicer car. That way you get the interest instead of paying the interest.<br>  <br>  You can do it and it isn't as hard as you think.

You choose what credit cards and other debt to go into the debt consolidated loan so of course you can keep a credit card.<br>  <br>  You should be careful when choosing who you go to for these debt consolidation loans, many times they can actually ruin your credit score and you wont be able to take out a car loan.

Send certified letters explaining that the items belong to your Father with the same name and same birthday. <br>  <br>  Its also possible that your dad is screwing you over by using your social security number. If that's the case, then you are the victim of identity theft by your father and you either have to live with it or file a police report against your father. I hope that's not the case but that kind of stuff happens sometimes.|`|qGfAlDd2aa	At one point, the credit bureaus had me Married to my father!

2opG5Qaoaa	If a person owning two houses either 100% owner for the 2 houses or joint holder in the houses, <br>  <br>  Then he can claim all the benefits on 1st home that is up to 1.5 lakhs interest and up to 1 lakh on principle repayment <br>  <br>  But on the 2nd home he can only claim interest. More details are given below.<br>  <br>  Tax benefits on second house<br>  <br>  Suppose you invest in a second house. This is not treated like the first one which is a self-occupied property. The second house is treated as a property that is rented out.<br>  <br>  There are no benefits of principal deduction that borrowers can avail. Homeowners can however claim benefits for interest repayment of the home loan. There is no limit on the interest repaid unlike the Rs 1.5 lakh limit under Section 24 for self-occupied property.<br>  <br>  You can seek tax benefits under Section 24 and deduction under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act only when the EMI payment is made. If you default or fail to make EMI payments, you cannot claim tax benefits for them.<br>  <br>  Further, only the person who has taken the loan can claim tax deduction. In case of a joint loan, the persons can avail tax benefits in proportion to their individual contributions towards loan repayment.<br>  <br>  It is left to the borrowers to use these benefits well and reduce the overall cost of the home loan.
KgvUC9bzaa	Hell no. Make that money.

You have to do what is best for you. Unfortunately for the other company, they will be losing a potential great employee. It is a little in bad taste to quit after all the plans have been made, but such is life. Do what you need to do! By the way, congrats on getting two jobs so close together!

I know its a dog-eat-dog world out there, but if you stick to the original job, and simply apologise to the second company for not informing them, no one will think any the worse of you.  If you jump ship, after the first company has already invested significantly in you, then you will definitely annoy them greatly.  Depending on the industry in which you work, thats the kind of thing that can stick to a reputation.  You never know what's going to happen, and you might need that reputation with either company in the future.  Plus, its the honourable thing to do, and a gentleman's word is his bond!

THEY have to respond to your interrogatories.<br>  <br>  NOTE:  FOR $2,000, they ain't filing a lawsuit.  It costs too much for so little.

You don't respond to those, you just show up at court and bring the items requested on the Subpoena.<br>  <br>  If you do not show up, they will issue a Show Cause [why you didn't show up for that hearing] and, if you don't show up at the Show Cause hearing, they'll issue a Bench Warrant for your arrest.<br>  <br>  Avoiding being served your papers only prolongs the inevitable.

You can find some in your area by contacting the counties directly.  Go to the phone book and look for your county appraiser or county assessor or even the county treasurer/tax collector.<br>  <br>  Please note not all states are tax lien states.  Make sure you read up on this subject before you start thinking of investing in this venture.  It is lucrative but also carry risks.  I suggest buying a book on it before you jump into it.  Suggestion can be found below.|`|d9db1a50041eeb0dcb4b6e4728ff8a4baa	Call your local tax authority, which is in the county that you live in. Each county handles the tax liens and foreclosure, and most of it is public record. In dallas, they hire a law firm for foreclosures and tax liens, the law firm lists the auctions, and it's a free service. Also check your local newspaper, there are ads in their for local foreclosures as well. <br>  <br>  If you live in a decent size city and county, you should be able to find the number to the tax office online, along with information on foreclosure and auctions.

PxlGvowEaa	First, make sure that buyer is qualified to purchase your home.  Ask to speak with their lender who will be making the loan for that buyer.  Find out if they are "Pre Approved" or "Pre Qualified".  Pre Approval is the better of the two and it means that the lender obtained documents from the buyer sufficient enough to make a preliminary loan approval.<br>  <br>  Then, get a REALTOR to help you with the paperwork.  Typically you can negotiate an agent to handle only doing the paperwork for you.  That way, all the t's are crossed and i's are dotted.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|AA10193753	Find a real estate lawyer, who will explain the legal procedures to you. It's all too complicated to explain online and it needs professional assistance.|`|AA12153514	They make you an offer and you choose whether to accept it. If you accept it, then they will instruct a solicitor to represent them (the buyer) and you will need a solicitor to represent you (the vendor). The buyer will also pay for a surveyor to survey your home - they will check the overall condition of the property and make a report. The buyer can opt for a simple or more extensive survey. Also, the buyer will make a mortgage application (if they require a mortgage) and the survey above will be part of this.<br>  <br>  Your solicitor won't have much to do apart from answer questions, draw up a sale contract, exchange contracts and handle completion. You will have forms to fill in, which detail what is included in the sale of your property e.g. are you leaving the curtains or taking them, and also details about whether anyone has right of way through your property etc.<br>  <br>  Once the buyer starts the ball rolling (solicitors, mortgage application) then it normally takes 4-6 weeks. The slowest part of the process is the formal mortgage offer on the actual  property (don't get this confused with the initial mortgage decision in principle). If there is a chain involved, then it may take longer.<br>  <br>  In addition, the buyers solicitor will apply for searches through the local council. These verify that there are no plans to demolish your property to build a bypass. Also, there may be other searches just to confirm that there is water and electric going to your property, and adequate drainage.<br>  <br>  When the buyers solicitor is happy and everything is in place (mortgage offer etc), then your solicitor will release the contract. When the buyers solicitor phones your solicitor after that, then exchange of contracts will take place. At this point, the sale/purchase becomes legally binding. When contracts are exchanged, then a completion date is agreed. This is the date when you must vacate the property by. If you fail to vacate, or the buyer fails to complete (pay) then the offending party can be sued for breach of contract.|`|5cec67029ee83fc8d1526f4f1bc54c49aa	If you have already got a buyer and have negotiated price, then you need to put it on paper.  Do you know a Realtor that will give you paperwork??  Not  do the deal, you have done that, but just someone who will print out the paperwork for you and give them to you.  If not, go to your Library and ask the front desk for MIBOR forms, most of them have them.  Just fill in the blanks.  You will need to make sure how the deed will be transferred (by General warranties Deed)  You will need to mark who pays for the title policy (buyer, seller, or split).  How the taxes will be done(just mark seller to pay theirs and buyer to pay theirs)  Was there any consessions to the buyer, ie closing costs and prepaids?  Does the buyer want a home inspection?  That needs to be marked along with the amount of tim they will allow you to respond to the Inspection.  You need to set a closing date on the paperwork.  Then call up a title company in your area and ask them what their fees are.  when you find one that cahrges in the 400-700 range, give thema  copy of the paperwork and they will do the rest.  All you need to do is move out.  If you are in Indiana or florida,  I can send you the MIBOR papers through email if you need them, juset email me at shaneshomes@yahoo.com
