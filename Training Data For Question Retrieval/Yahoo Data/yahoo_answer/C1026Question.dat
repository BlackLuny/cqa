There seems to always be that debate about who should be our #1 and for some reason Habs fans and media still keep on pushing that Price is our #1.      Now I've never been much of a Price supporter (not saying that I didn't wish for him to be our #1 or that I don't wish him to be that superstar people so want him to be..but at the moment, he's far from it)      I think given the chance Halak can be the Habs' best next thing..(I don't understand how people haven't seen it from the start..afterall, he did wear Roy on his helmet... I had to love him for that alone lol) Not saying he's the next Roy..but the closest we've come so far since      so my question is, who do YOU think should be our #1 and WHY???

Like, any idiot can throw out the reason they don't like him: "He's married to the boss's daughter." Or the new line they use (because they heard someone else say it, now they repeat it): "He's a backstage politician."      I feel like people target him because it's easy. They criticize him highly but let others off because when it comes to Triple H all they offer is a few easy lines and move on. Criticizing other people would actually call for them to think, but oh! We don't want to have to think for ourselves.      Also, people who dislike him use it as a way to invalidate his abilities. They say he can't wrestle, is talentless, and has no mic skills. Anybody with any sense would know those statements are flat out lies.

20090304103423AAfgKlD	Sports;Football (American)	Will the Patriots ever be able to resurrect their reputation?	Ever since Spygate proved that all of the Patriots Super Bowl victories were gained by cheating, the whole New England area has been cloaked in a veil of national disgrace (besides the one caused by the corrupt Kennedys). It has even called into question the Red Sox and Celtics successes.    Can New England ever recover without first firing and then prosecuting Billicheat? I think not.   I think only this series of steps can ever lift their disgrace.      1. Fire and prosecute Billicheat immediately.   2. Forfeit all victories since he has been coach   3. Send back all Super Bowl rings- just adding asterisks to them is not enough.   4. Make a televised public apology to all the other 49 States who have suffered under their shameful acts.   5. Sign a Letter Of Intent to voluntarily leave the Union if any further acts of cheating occur. This would help the other states greatly for not having to fund their runaway taxes.      Then and only then will we allow them to return to the fold of legitimacy. (Hey, all that still doesn't compare to what the South had to endure under Reconstruction largely due to Massachusettes based Carpetbaggers!)      Do you agree with this policy?

If he all the sudden decides against the LHW division, then it would be Okami, Hen/Bis, Nate/Maia, and then whomever between Nate, Maia, Leben, Cote, Almeida, Santiago, Lister, Belcher, Day, Reljic or maybe Franklin that gets another win or two this year.

20090227070714AAljb6m	Sports;Baseball	Spring training as regular season predictor?	I know that spring training games tend to be crazy -- rusty returning players, inexperienced young players, etc.  And I know that no one really gets bent out of shape watching their team lose games in spring training, because we know that it's as much a try-out as it is an actual game.      Having said all that, I wonder:   How often have you seen a team's performance during spring training reflect what they actually do in the regular season?  Teams that have been unstoppable all spring that go on to win it all?  Teams that lose all their spring training games and end up in last place?        (I guess the opposite would be interesting, too -- do you know teams that have blown away everyone in training, and then finished dead last?)      Just curious!

20090304113803AAjE5ol	Sports;Running	What to do since I can't do track?!?! =(?	I love, love, love to run and am a distance runner for my high school's track team. Usually, I do XC or winter track, but this year I didn't, just because I was too busy. However, I have been running since spring track ended last year and kept running up until about a month ago when I was injured and tore muscles in a car accident. Now, I'm still a little injured, and when I tried to run the other day, I was only able to run a little less than 2 miles without stopping. Point being, I'm too out of shape/hurt to do track, which starts this week, and it's killing me, because I've trained year-round. I'm a Junior, so there's always next year, but I'm just soooo upset over it! How have you dealt with not being able to run because of an injury or something? I need to get over it, but I just CAN'T!

20090304112558AA9pIiR	Sports;Hockey	Are the Leafs trying to lose? Should the NHL change the rules for the order of draft picks?	Gerber? Really? Toskala goes out for the season all of a sudden to get surgery?       I don't know. However I do know that the NHL needs to change this rule. How fun is it for a fan of a team like the Leafs (and we know there are many many many) to think that it's possible for them to be losing on purpose to get higher in the draft order? That isn't how sports is meant to be played, from a competition standpoint and more importantly a fan standpoint.      Bring back the lottery please. The team in last place should get the best chance at getting the 1st pick in the lottery, however EVERY team should have SOME chance. Salary cap? Good idea in my opinion. But not having a draft lottery just takes some of the fun out of the game.      Agree? Disagree?

20090304123311AAerK5u	Sports;Football (Soccer);2006 FIFA World Cup(TM)	Are you at all surprised Sampdoria is up 3-0 right before halftime?	I'm not, as soon as I saw Rivas and Materazzi in defense I knew there would be major problems.  Especially when you have the genius of Cassano coupled with Pazzini that is too much for any defender that doesn't know how to handle them.  Rivas was responsible for Cassano's goal and Pazzini's second goal.  Rivas marking cassano and Materazzi marking Pazzini is just not working haha

20090304124004AAd5SA6	Sports;Boxing	Is the Myth that Foreman regained the title with a "lucky desperation shot" one of boxings TOP MISCONCEPTIONS?	Many an untrue story is told in bars and pubs all over the land. The story that has been twisted to state that a desperate "old man" got lucky and basically hit the lottery with a shot in the dark that miracuously found it's mark, scored the knockout and made history.......But nothing could be FURTHER from the truth!      Foreman prior to the fight badly wanted the 3 knockdown rule. He wanted to use Michael Moorer as a basketball the way Holyfield would later do. Score several early knockdowns and take home the title. However when that possibility was taken away from George by the powers that be, George adopted another strategy of "slow Chinese Water Torture"-Foreman Stlye! ....Jab, Jab, Jab, followed by suprisingly and relatively inocuous right hand. THEN REPEAT. Occasionally however the right hand would not be inocuous. It would be THUNDEROUS! Then just go back to making it seemingly harmless once again. This pattern slowly wore Moorer down as the rounds went on. Moorer on the other hand was of course winning on the scorecards. He was certainly outlanding George. But as Gil Clancy would later say, "He wasn't out toughing George." As Foreman was losing rounds, Michael Moorer was losing strength. The combination of actually trying to hurt the indestructable Foreman while also enduring George's methodical drubbing was slowly wearing Teddy Atlas's prize pupil down. The highly intelligent Teddy Atlas had a notion of what Big George was slowly doing, but Michael Moorer did not. The fact that many of George's punches were disguised as lazy paws gave Moorer the overwhelming confidence and true belief that he actually had a chance to knock Foreman out { something that NO ONE in Big George's storied comeback had come close to doing }. As Foreman would later say, It was a case of "Come in to my parlor, said the spider to the fly"!      ROUND 10      Round 10 WAS NOT a round with a desperate punch. It was Foreman, for the better portion of 2 minutes jolting, reverberating and clubbing Moorer with shots that were noticeably moving the wide stanced Moorer around. THEN, a hard 1-2 that froze Moorer solid like an unfortunate victim of the mythological Medusa. Foreman then imploded the human statue in front of him with another identical 1-2. Moorer crumpled to the canvas with so much blood spilling out of his head that the MGM staff was still trying in vain to clean the stains out the next morning. In the words of commentator Jim Lampley " Michael Moorer momentarily went to sleep". George Foreman was once again the heavyweight champion of the world after 20 years!      Foreman was champ. BUT NOT on a "lucky desperation punch"! He had regained the title in much the same way that Ali did to him 2 decades earlier.......WITH STRATEGY-AND CHARACTER! XO

Maryse is in a submission and tries to tag Michelle, but Michelle refuses to tag herself in, since she's still angry at Maryse for taking her title. This allows Melina to pin Maryse. Maryse slaps Michelle afetr the macth and they fight in the ring. The previous week (This Friday), Maryse beats Eve and Melina attacks Maryse and Michelle McCool attacks Melina. I was guessing that Maryse and Michelle would be a team vs Melina and whoever else WWE ties in. Now that Maryse and Michelle hate each other that's gone. My prediction is now back to Melina vs Maryse at WM. Now here's the Gail Kim part. I think she'll be debuting at the draft. She'll come up as a Smackdown pick and walk onto the ramp and blow kisses and wave and everyone will be shocked, and Michelle will attack her from behind. Those two will start a grudge on Smackdown. My prediction. What ya think?

20090304121410AALpjQb	Sports;Baseball	Little League Question about "safety baseballs" for tee ball and coach pitch.?	I am in charge or ordering baseballs for our league and it's been several years since my kids played tee ball and coach pitch.        Not sure what to get...There are 3 levels of reduced impact "safety balls" out there.  Level 1, Level 5 and Level 10.      Never seen a Level 1...don't know anything about it except that it is recommended for this age group.      In the past we have used both Level 5 and Level 10...my memory is that the Level 5's were dangerous because the hits would bounce so high (literally face level).  The way they bounced it was like hitting a superball.  The Level 10's are harder but the stay down a lot better.      My concern is that if Level 5 is reacting like that...Level 1 will be just as dangerous. At the moment I'm leaning towards getting the 10's      Anyone have experience or opinions they would like to share?

20090304130032AA3BwZo	Sports;Baseball	What is there to like about baseball?	The sport has no athletic capabilities what so ever, its drug infested and the players have bellies the size of 40-4 trucks. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I thought sport(not including pansie ones like Golf) should test a mans physical capabilites more so than any other attribute. Don't shoot the messenger, but if Baseball is a sport thats garnering so much money in the US, doesn't that say something about our expectations. I mean if you're Frank, and you weigh 300 lbs and you couldn't power walk to save your life, then by all means sit down and watch a sport that was made to your liking. But if you're someone like me, who likes to see warriors test it out ands push themselves. Then come and watch Football or Basketball.

20090304142054AALEFg7	Sports;Football (American)	How sad is it that the remaining two players missing at sea decided to give up their lives.?	On Tuesday searchers found a life jacket and a cooler 16 miles away, but that was all.      Schuyler told Coast Guard investigators a strange story about the fate of the others, according to family members of two of the missing men. However, they said, given Schuyler's condition when rescued after two days on the sea in cold weather, he may have been delusional.      Schuyler told investigators that about two to four hours after their boat flipped in rough seas, one of the two National Football League players on board gave up hope and let himself be swept away, according to relatives briefed by the Coast Guard.      A few hours later, the second one did the same.      "We were told that Nick said the two NFL players took their life jackets off and drifted out to sea," said Bob Bleakley, whose son Will, 25, a former University of South Florida football player, is also still missing.      With former Tampa Bay Buccaneers Marquis Cooper, 26, and Corey Smith, 29, gone, only Schuyler and Will Bleakley remained clinging to the boat.      Then, sometime early Monday, Will Bleakley thought he saw a light in the distance. He decided to take off his life jacket and swim to it, hoping to get help, Bob Bleakley said Schuyler told the investigators.      "I think he was delusional to think he could swim someplace," Bob Bleakley said

So today was a nice day of football with us going 7 points clear of Liverpool and Chelski, with a game in hand and our game against Liverpool, it would be fair to say we would be 13 points clear of Liverpool next week. Don't you think?

20090304143134AAFRCbi	Sports;Basketball	Why Has Everyone Forgotten About Mike Bibby?	I mean he is just 30 years old and has a lot of more basketball in him. Considering, he has been virtually healthy his entire career. He has been unscathed by serious injuries that could cut his productivity therefore his career short. All he has had to battle are nagging and reoccuring finger injuries nothing much after this.      Not to mention people talk about CP3, D.Will, Mo Williams, and Harris - all these up and comers over him. Personally, I think Bibby is the best PG out East and it is funny how people forget him hyping the CP3's when Bibby is the ultimate playoff PG. He has made a career of 40 point playoff games and clutch shot after shot, so why be unmentioned like he is.      His productivity on the Hawks is the same as it was on the Kings and he even took them to the playoffs. Before, that trade the Hawks were nowhere near the playoffs.

I'm not that good yet, but I can skate pretty decent.        I know how to teach a little bit of basic skating stuff, it wasn't so long ago that  I was being taught.        I just met a kid who's 11, and he's wanting to learn to skate, so I'm going to coach him. While i skated with him today, I noticed that his ankles turn in all the time when he move on the ice, it's very bad, and I never had trouble with that> i tried to get him to straighten his ankles out so he wasn't doing the "A frame" kinda of thing, but, he just didn't seem to be able to, and I don't know what to help him stop doing that. I never had troubles with that when I was learning, so I never was coached on how not to do that.        So, bottom line, what would be some good ideas to help a beginner skater keep their ankles straight, no collapsing in?

20090304133302AAo2Cgc	Sports;Fantasy Sports	1st pick in Keeper for Life League...a little help!?	I currently own the very first pick in the inaugural season of a keeper for life league....this will be the only draft ever if everything runs its course. Big money, 16 teams, ultra competitive, H2H format, both AL and NL. Hence, age and position scarcity obviously is a little more influential with regards to drafting strategy. I've narrowed my pick down to three obvious candidates I guess: Hanley Ramirez, Jose Reyes, and David Wright.         I know everyone says Han Ram and book it, and in a redraft league I probably would have to agree...but I'm skeptical to be honest in this format. I see Han Ram switching positions in a few years, losing that precious SS eligibility, and not running as much in the not so distant future; especially with the proposed lineup change in Florida. Honestly, my gut says go with one of the Mets boys, as they have a way more comfy lineup there and will both stay in their positions for the duration I think. Some key stats to consider:                                                                                                                          BB: 1 pt                                                               K:   -.5 pt                                                             SB:  2 pt                                                           CSB: -1 pt        Who you take with the first pick in this league setup if you were me?

20090304143806AA2uQKu	Sports;Outdoor Recreation;Fishing	Can you recommend a good fly tying book?	I have been tying flies for a short time and I would like a good reference on tying flies. I do NOT need a "beginner's" book and I do not necessarily want the newest book or the one with the most patterns. What I'd like is a solid, well-known reference written by a well-known fly tier that includes a lot of "classic" patterns with basic tying/material instructions, and then maybe some bit of background and/or fishing instructions for each fly. I am considering Ted Leeson's "Benchside Reference," but I've looked through it seems to be only techniques -- no actual pattern instructions. Older books are fine, as long as there is some form of photos or illustrations. Thanks!
