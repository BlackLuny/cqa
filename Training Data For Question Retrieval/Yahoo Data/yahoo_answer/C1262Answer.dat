ybeHW6Kiaa	Alright since nobody has answered this yet I will try to help you.  I have heard W before, but now I don't remember what it is, anyways I think i understand the logic how to go about to solve this question so I'll try to explain it.  <br>  <br>  First you have to figure out what W represents, and than find out how many grams of fat the bird would need to burn to release 3.70 W (this should be given to you from a chart or sth).  After you have that you would need to find out how many W would 4 g of fat release.  Than you woul find out how many grams of carbohydrates you would need to burn to release the same energy as you would if you burned 4 gr of fat.  As a rule I know for sure that the amount of carbohydrates needed is going to be greater than the amount of fat, because 1 gr of fat has more energy than 1 gr of sugar (carbohydrate)<br>  <br>  So to give you an example to illustrate it a little better say you found out that in order to release 3.70 W the bird has to burn 0.4 gr fat.  now the bird would be releasing 37.0 W if it burned 4gr of fat.  Next based on that, and another value that should be given to you from a chart or sth (lets say this value is 1 gr carbohydrate = 3.7 W) you would calculate the  amount of carbohydrates in grams needed to be burned to release 37.0 gr.  This amount would be 10 gr.  GL

695354591fcd4c8acf43d958f3d5442daa	The core temperature and pressure is not high enough to begin the process of Helium fusion.
Gnfc4wRlaa	"While a main sequence star, energy production by nuclear fusion in the core causes a transformation from hydrogen nuclei to helium nuclei. At some point in time the hydrogen nuclei in the core will run out. When this occurs there will no longer be a balance between gravitational pressure inward and photon pressure outward. This is due to the fact that the photon production ceases when the fusion process runs out of fuel. At this point the core (almost pure helium) will begin to collapse again. As the core collapses its temperature will rise. Surrounding the core is a shell of hydrogen. This hydrogen shell will increase in temperature due to its proximity to the core. At some point the hydrogen shell will reach the temperature to burn hydrogen. When this happens the radiation pressure outward will be greater than the gravitational pressure inward and the star will expand. (Recall that gravitational forces will decrease with distance from the center.) As the outer layers of the star expand the temperature of the gas cools causing it to turn red in color. In addition, the increase in radius will cause an increasing luminosity. The star is now considered to be a red giant.<br>  <br>  Meanwhile, the helium core is continuing to compress and get hot. At some point it will reach 100 million Kelvin and helium will begin to fuse. This fusion converts helium nuclei into carbon and oxygen nuclei. And once again photons generate radiation pressure outward balancing the inward pressure of gravity. In the case of a star like the sun, helium burning will not occur until the core has collapsed to a point called degeneracy. Degeneracy occurs when electrons, generally ignored up to this point, are pushed too close to each other. When this happens the gas is more metallic in nature than gaseous. The effect is that energy generated by helium fusion increases the temperature of the core but the core has no mechanism to release that energy as a gas would. Therefore, the core continues to increase in temperature until it explodes in what is called a helium flash. This flash does not destroy the core but forces it to re-contract until stable helium burning can take place."|`|525m5qrTaa	it is my understanding that when the sun collapses, the upper layers will rebound against the lower layers and expand out quickly in a supernova.  <br>  <br>  The example typically given is:<br>  a.)

When the hydrogen is depleted to the point where fusion stops the sun will have lost so much of its mass that the residual radiation pressure overcomes the crush of gravity and the star will begin to expand, this is the first stage of the death of the sun. Eventually the mass will cool and radiation will cease completely, then the gasses will  begin to contract and the sun will become a white dwarf, it will cool to become a cinder.|`|ftwGaZ4Uaa	Currently, the energy produced by the fusion processes creates a pressure, which is countered by gravitational pressure. <br>  <br>  When the fusion processes cease, because the hydrogen (H) is depleted, this internal pressure drops and the core collapses under gravity.|`|77cb033374598e8c10938763c9fe03f7aa	Core collapse only occurs in massive stars when fusion produces iron.<br>    In stars like the sun when helium begins to run out the star expands,dims then shrinks and eventually in 10 billion years turns into a big cinder.

WpPHo5qJaa	The angle of attack is related to the amount of lift. Lift will increase as the angle of attack is increased up to the point (usually around 17 degrees) where the aircraft stalls, the critical angle of attack. <br>  <br>  The angle of attack is the angle at which relative windmeets an airfoil. It is the angle that is formed by the chord of the airfoil and the direction of the relative wind or between the chord line and the flight path. The angle of attack changes during a flight as the pilot changes the direction of the aircraft. It is one of the factors that determines the aircraft's rate of speed through the air.<br>  <br>  The increase in angle of attack increases lift up to a point. Too high an angle of attack results in a loss of lift and can cause an aircraft to stall.<br>  <br>  Depending on the angle of attack,there will be a force backward (induced drag) and a force upward (lift). The amount of force depends on the angle of attack. If the angle of attack is small, the drag and lift are comparatively small.<br>  <br>  (The relative wind is the flow of air past an airfoil relative to the path of flight. It is parallel and opposite in direction to the aircraft's path of flight.)|`|KxpVOYrPaa	So it could cover more area that the wind hit so it could convert more kinetic enegrgy from the wind|`|ppgJyj2yaa	becuase different points on the blade are going at different speeds (the centre is going the slowest and the tip is going the fastest) different angles of attack are needed to create the greatest force

I1RV9xiMaa	Removing chlorine from water is somewhat complicated.  Chlorinated water is simply water with Cl- ions floating around, and washing would certainly not help.  It would depend what kind of water you would want to remove it from.  For fishtanks, you could use Sodium Thiosulphate, it complexes and removes Cl- ions from solution.  For drinking water, a simple carbon filter (e.g. Brita) should remove ~99% of all Cl- ions.  Another method is to aerate and allow the Cl to leave as a gas, but it will take time, similar to how a soda goes flat after the CO2 has left as a gas from solution.|`|811e85ac0ec3c30f0a5df20da0063fe8aa	Chlorine is a gas.

Instead, a safer why to harness the power of chlorine is to use chloramines. <br>  <br>  Even if the water is initially treated with gaseous Cl2, the predominate form is NOT going to form Cl- ions in water.

LUiOVr21aa	I think a quick look-up on Wikipedia might suffice.  Under "conservation status" in the Pdog Wikipedia article:<br>  "Ecologists consider this rodent to be a keystone species. They are an important prey species, being the primary diet in prairie species such as the black-footed ferret, the swift fox, the golden eagle, the badger, and the ferruginous hawk. Other species, such as the mountain plover and the burrowing owl, also rely on prairie dog burrows for nesting areas.  Even grazing species such as bison, pronghorn and mule deer have shown a proclivity for grazing on the same land used by prairie dogs.  It is believed that they prefer the vegetative conditions after prairie dogs have foraged through the area. Many creatures that prey on them are threatened."

z7BiMSWmaa	1.Glucose converted to sucrose as soon as made and transported around the plant.<br>  <br>  2.Have answered this one in your other question.<br>  <br>  3.Photosynthesis requires chlorophyll, light, CO2, water, ATP, NADPH and the key enzyme in the Calvin Cycle is RUBISCO and results ultimately in glucose production. Starch synthesis does not require chlorophyll, light, NADPH, CO2 but does need ATP. The biosynthesis of starch originates with glucose 1-phosphate, which is derived from photosynthetic products. Glucose 1-phosphate is activated by ADP-glucose phosphorylase to form ADP-glucose. The enzyme starch synthase catalyzes the addition of glucose monomers onto the end of the growing starch polymer, with one ADP as a leaving group for each new glucose unit added onto the chain.

z7BiMSWmaa	Starch breakdown in plants involves a phosphorylation step and so if there is a phosphate deficiency the starch will not be processed.

QPWjtDzcaa	And just how would someone hide the sky from everyone on the planet?<br>  <br>  If it's as massive as they say, and due to come here in less than four years, I personally, along with hundreds of thousands of other amateur astronomers would be able to notice deviations in the orbits of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.  So, if the government is going to make this a cover up, they would have to silence people all over the world.  <br>  <br>  And that's assuming Niburu has an albeido of exactly zero...  making it the only discovered object in our solar system to absorb all light it receives...  and it would have to emit zero as well, completely impossible if it is massive enough to do anything to earth.<br>  <br>  If it has a "normal" albeido, it would be the second brightest starlike object in our sky.

Even closer, if it does so after the perihelion passage. It can't be hidden. <br>  <br>  How should NASA hide it? Just by not allowing you to go out at night and watch the sky? Ah of course. NASA can do anything, except landing on the moon, I forgot.<br>  <br>  BTW: Astronomers discovered dwarf planets in the outer solar system lately, which are about 100 times further away from the sun, than Nibiru can be  and about 60 times smaller than the fictional planet. The people who discovered these dwarf planets had not been employed by NASA, but by the CalTech and used the 48 inch telescope of the Mount Palomar observatory.|`|17d2136cb28b3dcd96bfa98507022f5eaa	I don't know how many times I've explained this here, lots, but NASA is not in the business of searching for asteroids and mythical planets like Nibiru, they're in the business of launching space vehicles. The actual searching the skies for odd bits of rock is done by a bunch of independent university-based research observatories. When they find something interesting, _nothing_ will shut them up, because their research grants depend on them gtting interesting results. In addition, there are many dedicated amateur astronomers constantly searching the skies who are not funded by anybody but themselves, and not behoden to anyone. So the chances of NASA or "the government" or anyone else hushing up any major discovery are absolutely zero.|`|OLHiZ045aa	Watching the skies for what?<br>  <br>  Even the most powerful telescopes can't spot little people on distant planets!

Since sodium chloride is composed of Na+ ions and Cl- ions then they must be attracted to one of the electrodes.  The law of charges states that opposite charges attract and like charges repel.  Thus, the Na+ ion must be attracted by the negative electrode and the Cl- by the positive electrode.<br>  <br>  When a chemical species gains electrons it is said to be reduced and when it loses electrons it is oxidized.  Thus the Na+ ion will go to the negative electrode where it will be reduced by gaining an electron  and becoming Na metal.  That should give you enough information to choose the correct response.

Instead of holding water however, it is holding heat. How much heat depends on the heat capacity, and the mass. The amount of heat in the iron is :<br>  <br>  (25 g)*(398 K)*(0.449 J/gC) = ???!!!<br>  <br>  Of course, your instructor has taken the dark path and is out to make you suffer, since the temperature units have all been scrambled. <br>  <br>  USE THE FORCE!!  <br>  <br>  273 K = 0 C, so this means the iron is 398 - 273 = 125 C. <br>  <br>  (25 g)*(125 C)*(0.449 J/gC) = 1403 j<br>  <br>  Now, 1 joule will heat 1 gram of (liquid) water 1 degree C. The water is 298 - 273 = 25 C, which is about 75 F. One other thing is understand (and eventually appreciate) is the fact chemistry is based on the metric system. The metric system is based on water. This all means weight is equivalent to volume. As far as the problem is concerned,  25 ml is also 25 grams of water. Therefore, subjecting 25 grams of water to 1403 j will heat it:<br>  <br>  (1403 j)/(4.18 j/gC)/(25 g) = 13.4 C<br>  <br>  The final temperature is 25 C + 13.4 C = 38.4 C<br>  <br>  at least this is how I think this stuff works .....<br>  <br>  ////////////// how to use THE FORCE<br>  <br>  Observe the math closely and one will see how I've multiplied and divided things to cancel the units I don't want.

For homework. But I'm in school.|`|JQqvohOXaa	The question involves the law of conservation of energy.  In thermodynamics, in a system, the heat gained by one object equals the heat lost by the other.  In this case you have water at a lower temperature and iron at a higher temperature.  When the iron is placed in the water heat is transferred from the iron to the water.  The iron and water will come to an equilibrium temperature (final temperature).  In your problem the system involves the iron and the water.  The styrofoam cup is the surroundings and no heat is lost to the surroundings.  Also, the density of water is 1.00 g/mL.<br>  <br>  Usually the symbol Q is used for heat but you can also use H.<br>  Q = (mass)x(specific heat)x(change in temperature), where (change in temperature) = final T - initial T.  Specific heat usually has the symbol s or c.  You might see Q = mc(Tf - Ti).  <br>  <br>  You have to set the equation up so that:<br>  <br>   Heat lost by iron  = Heat gained by water.<br>  <br>  25.0 g(0.449 J/g.C)(Tf -125 C) = 25.0 g(4.18 J/ g.C(Tf - 25 C)<br>  <br>  You will need to solve the equation for Tf to obtain the final temperature.  This is just algebra and while tedious, is not difficult.<br>  <br>  In your data you have some units that need to be addressed.  Your temperatures are given in K while the units for specific heat are in J/g-degree C.   It is important to realize that since the degree size in degrees C is the same as in degrees K that the specific heat can also be given as J/g-degree K. In any case, the numerical values above will be the same.  Or you can just calculate the celsius temperature from the Kelvin temperature.  The difference in temperature will be exactly the same in either case.  <br>  <br>  Sorry for the length of this but it is a fairly involved process.

You would also need about 2.5 liters of water per day. You would need food that does not break up into crumbs. In null-g these crumbs could get into your air filtration systems and clog them. You would need some sort of air scrubber to remove water vapor and CO2 from your air after breathing. Obviously, you would need a ship which can keep a constant pressure of 1 atm inside the compartment while withstanding a pressure of 0 atm outside. You would need solar panels to keep computers, filtration systems, and air pumps running. Some sort of composite material on the outside of your ship would be necessary to keep the 16,500+ mph chunks of space junk from ripping through the hull of your ship. A radio would be nice so that you could communicate with earth. If you plan to leave the ship, you would need a space suit, but not if you have no plans to get out and about. If you stay for extended periods of time, you will need exercise equipment modified for zero-g. Over time, your muscles and bones will weaken in the microgravity and if you ever plan on going back to earth you will be incredibly weak. A fire extinguisher would be necessary so that you could put out small fires before they spread across the ship in the 100% oxygen atmosphere.

lNyZ4ZN2aa	I used to do that as a kid, my parents were local weather forecasters back then.  And we did it old school, no instruments attached, just a big balloon filled with helium.  They'd keep one eye on the stopwatch and the other on the balloon but I can't remember clearly how long it took before it vanished from sight on a clear, calm day.  <br>  <br>  A smaller balloon, the kind kids play with, can go up maybe 5 miles, at that point it will start to freeze due to the dropping temperature and expand because of the decreasing pressure in the atmosphere.  The balloon shreds into pieces due to the brittle effect.<br>  <br>  Larger balloons that can withstand cold temperatures better than the small latex balloons go higher and expand increasingly as they go up for the same reason, the drop in air pressure.  The balloon will rise and expand until it bursts into small pieces and the debris will fall down to the earth.  These are weather balloons <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather_balloon" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather_bal...</a> .  Similar to what I used as a kid but ours were smaller and had no instruments attached.|`|ZH3Qc5mcaa	it will pop as it reaches or goes out of the earth's atmosphere|`|wuJ2pHoDaa	if you would let a helium balloon go into the sky, it would rise up, and eventually pop... the helium inside the balloon is exerting a force, and once that force is greater than the balloon material can withstand, it would pop. the reason that this doesn't happen on the surface is that the pressure from our atmosphere balances it out, so it doesn't pop... it will eventually make it's way back down to earth, after a long fall of course.<br>  <br>                                                 POOP!|`|NnMIb5hHaa	It will eventually pop, as you've probably observed when you blow up a balloon it retains it shape because of the air pressure. In other words the outward expansion of the balloon is countered by the downwards pressure of the air. As the helium balloon travels higher into the atmosphere, there will be less and less air pressure, and as such the balloon will keep on expanding until it pops|`|ZNVV1LDeaa	When it reached a height so that the pressure inside the balloon became excessive to that of the atmosphere it would burst unlike aeroplanes which are built to withstand the difference.
QPWjtDzcaa	Apparent magnitude is how bright a star appears from wherever you are observing (for all intensive purposes, this means, how bright a star appears from earth.)  Magnitude is a logorythmic scale, and the brightest stars have lower numbers of magnitude...  i.e. a magnitude -1 star is 2.51 times brighter than a magnitude 0 star, which is 2.51 times brighter than a magnitude +1 star and so on.<br>  <br>  Absolute magnitude measures how bright the star is, and ignores distance.  It assmues that if all stars are the same distance, how bright they would be in relation to each other...  "luminosity" is the key word for that.

Field strength E =  k. q /r^2    N/C<br>  It is defined as the force per unit positive charge at that distance r from the charge q.<br>  <br>  When there are 2 (or more) charges, the field E is the vector sum of the field from the individual charges.<br>  <br>  So with the two charges +Q   and  +2Q , there will be a point on the line between them where the force on a unit positive charge will be zero since the +Q and the + 2Q will both be repelling and the 2 forces will cancel out<br>  <br>  So where is this point: not half way in between since the 2Q would be pushing with a larger force(2 times).(r the same for both  but charge twice as big)<br>  I think you will see that the point of zero force has to be nearer the smaller charge.<br>  <br>  If the distances are R1 (for the +Q) and R2 (for the +2Q) ...

E0j6mhqhaa	I'm not sure what the "critical depth" means concerning ground water.  I guess the critical depth is where ever you find it at.  The thing is, that depth can vary 100 feet in depth within a half mile of each well and the production is the same.  Any time you're drilling into glacial till you'll find this great variation.  The glacier may have scoured a channel here but not there and may have deposited gravel there and fine clay here.  <br>  <br>  Here in north Missouri there's plenty of old hand dug wells 12-15' deep that produce water.  They're not high producing by any means and wouldn't be adequate for the modern household, but they were 100 years ago.  I know a fellow who had a well dug and it produces 20 gpm @ <400 feet.  One mile away another fellow has two wells, both over 600 feet deep and one produces 6 gpm and the other 8 gpm.  There's places in the Flordia peninsula where you can hit substantial ground water at 25'.  In the Missouri bootheel you have 12" wells 50-75' deep that produce >1,000 gpm because of the proximity to the Mississippi River. <br>     <br>  Salinity has more to do with prehistoric topography and whether the land was above ground or under a sea millions of years ago.  In north Missouri it's common to find saline water because this whole area was the bottom of a sea 200 million years ago.  In fact, not far from here is the salt lick where Daniel Boone's sons dug a well and boiled down the saline water to make salt.  South of the Missouri River, you rarely ever hit saline water because that part wasn't submerged for any length of time.  In areas of Florida, the pumping of fresh ground water has lowered the on land water table so much that underground salt water is moving inland to fill the void.<br>    <br>  To answer your question, there is no such thing as an equation that will give you all the answers.  If this is a question some science teacher gave you, it's a trick question as far as I'm concerned.|`|7HKTDcvYaa	In my farm we have ground water at 4 meters and there is no salinity when going down to 60 meters. Over close to Lake Huron, where there is salt from the old inland sea, we have salinity in water 2 meters below the surface, and that salinity just increases as one goes deeper.<br>  <br>  I do not know what this tells you.|`|LTspANO6aa	I'm not sure what you are asking either.<br>  <br>  Are you asking for equations to evaluate how far down the water table needs to be to not have a saline problem due to the water evaporating and leaving the salts behind?<br>  <br>  If so, I'm not really aware of any equations that really handle the job.  The critical depth is affected by soil texture as well as whether there is a postive or negative evapotranspiration.<br>  <br>  It basically comes down to if the overal movement of the water is down, no saline problem, if up, there is a problem, but I've never seen it reduced to a couple of equations.

During beta decay, beta particles (electrons) are emitted from the nucleus of an atom.<br>  <br>  b) the mass number of neutrons remains the same<br>  This statement is confusing.  Beta decay involves a neutron changing into a proton.  This happens when a neutron splits into a proton and an electron (beta particle).  The electron is ejected, and the proton stays in the nucleus.  Electrons have a very tiny mass which is insignificant next to a mass of a proton or a neutron.  However, strictly speaking, the mass of what used to be a neutron is reduced a very tiny amount.  So, in a sense the mass number of the atom decreases very slightly, but the difference is too small to matter.  For all practical purposes, the mass number stays the same during beta-decay.<br>  <br>  c) the number of neutrons remains the same<br>  Since during beta-decay a neutron changes to a proton, the number of neutrons decreases by one.<br>  <br>  d) the atomic number changes<br>  Since during beta-decay a neutron changes to a proton, the number of protons in an atom increases by one.  Atomic number is defined as the number of protons in the nucleus of an atom.  Therefore, during beta-decay, the atomic number increases by one.<br>  <br>  Answer:  d)  the atomic number changes|`|u7Y1SAViaa	d|`|JQqvohOXaa	Beta emission involves a high energy electron being ejected from the nucleus of an unstable atom.  Since electrons are negative and the total charge balance of the atom must remain the same (including the ejected beta particle) then the nucleus itself must have one more positively charged particle after the beta particle is emitted.  That is to say that the number of protons in the nucleus must increase by one and the number of neutrons must decrease by one.  Essentially, the mass of the nucleus is unchanged.  The answer to the question is d), of course.|`|E1gN87H0aa	Beta emission is when EITHER a neutron splits into a proton and an electron and a neutrino OR a proton splits into a neutron and a neutrino.

M3kcL8Giaa	The proteins would stay the same, since the can't cross the SPM. The NaCl in B would diffuse across the membrane until the concentration on both sides is equal. Both would end up with a concentration which is the average of the two starting concentrations. <br>  <br>  So the finishing concentrations would be:<br>  <br>  Side A - 8% protein, 5% NaCl<br>  Side B - 2% protein, 5% NaCl|`|ZYTwLVhpaa	The NaCl will flow form B side to A side(because it can). Proteins can't cross but the concentration has to be the sam on both sides. So water will go from B side to A side to equal concentration. There will be more water on A side than on B side. Concentration of NaCl and proteins will be the same(you can't see it though).<br>  <br>  to Soup: Water can cross either so the concentration will be the same on both sides for proteins and NaCl.

AA12034021	This is the diameter of the lens.  The bigger the lens, the more light it brings in.  When viewing things like stars at night, this means the more objects you will be able to see in the night sky (because some are more dim and put out less light, so you need the bigger lens to bring in enough light to see them).  Perhaps an over simplification of the issues, but that's essentially the gist.<br>  <br>  Focal length (expressed as f#) is very important too.  Perhaps the telescopes you've been looking at have a better focal length too?  I want to say the lower the number the better.<br>  <br>  Something else that is harder to quantify is the quality of the lens.  You can zoom the heck out of a fuzzy image, and it's still  a fuzzy image.  You want to go with some well know respected brand of optics.<br>  <br>  If you are serious about viewing objects in the night sky, then you will want to get something that can correct for the earth's movement, so that while you are viewing, you don't have to keep manually correcting the angle to "stay on" an object.<br>  <br>  Having looked into these recently, I am of the opinion that Celestron makes really good quality and is the most reasonable in price.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.celestron.com/c3/home.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.celestron.com/c3/home.php</a><br>  <br>  Their NextStar SLT series is a good example of ones with the correction computer on it:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.celestron.com/c3/category.php?CatID=8" rel="nofollow">http://www.celestron.com/c3/category.php...</a><br>  <br>  If this is not in your price range, and you want a good quality manually adjusted telescope, their Explorascope is really good value for the money:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.celestron.com/c3/product.php?ProdID=10" rel="nofollow">http://www.celestron.com/c3/product.php?...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.celestron.com/c3/product.php?ProdID=11" rel="nofollow">http://www.celestron.com/c3/product.php?...</a><br>  <br>  They have discontinued making them, however, I'm sure there are still places out there selling them.

Hence an 80mm lens is more expensive to produce (and the associated parts of the telescope have to be larger as well).  Also; as the size of the lens increases, the difficulties of optical problems such as aberration increase; so they are more difficult to grind.<br>  Hence, an 80mm telescope is more expensive (other things being equal, such as the overall quality of manufacture)|`|17d2136cb28b3dcd96bfa98507022f5eaa	The difference between the two is 10mm of aperture, 14% better resolving power, 31% greater light gathering power. But you also may be comparing apples and oranges, as all "refractor" telescopes are not created equal. There are different degrees of colour correction, and with each step up there is a marked increase in cost. There are achromatic refractors (cheapest, poor colour correction), ED refractors (more expensive, better colour correction), and true apochromatic refractors (very expensive, superb colour correction). The better quality telescopes tend to besold on better quality mounts, which also adds to the cost. So make sure you are comparing similar types of refractors. If you're comparing a 70mm achromat to an 80mm ED (both of which Orion sells) there will be more than aperture causing the price difference.

aNlT1NRqaa	The distance from the earth to the sun is in proportion to it's diameter the same as the moon's.<br>  <br>  Imagine putting a Matchbox car down in front of the real version of the same car. If you put it at the right distance, they will both look to be the same size. We're alive at the right time to see this effect in a total solar eclipse. The moon is moving away from the earth by 3.8 centimeters per year. This causes the length of an earth day to increase 0.0018 seconds every 100 years. This also means that in the distant past, the moon would have been bigger & solar eclipses would not have been as interesting without the "diamond ring effect" as the sun would have been completely hidden.<br>  <br>  In the distant future, the moon will be too small to block the whole sun, so it will just be a black disk moving across the face of the sun.|`|vxSXsn59aa	The sun is 400 times the diameter of the moon, but it's also 400 times farther away from Earth than the moon is, so they appear to be roughly the same size.|`|2lQ8DJAcaa	Although the Sun is really much bigger than the Moon, the Moon is much closer, so it appears to be the same size as the Sun in our sky.|`|AA10008098	By a happy coincidence, if the moon is between the earth and the sun it is just large enough to block all the sunlight (during an eclipse) for a small spot on earth.

DAMZKbpDaa	Due to the adiabatic expansion of gas, a "bubble of air" will raise in temperature approximately 4.5 degrees F every thousand feet. The "heat" content will be the same, but the molecule vibrations will be spread out over a wider area, due to the decrease in air pressure. IT warms up the same going down, for the same reason.<br>  <br>  This is assuming no precipitation takes place.|`|eJwAZEyZaa	Heat is a form of energy and temperature is just a measurement of that energy.|`|AA10008098	Try this.  If you operate a 10 watt light bulb in a cubic foot of (well insulated gas, a bubble?) for a minute you will add a certain quantity of heat energy and the gas will have a certain temperature.  If the bubble is now doubled in size (without adding or subtracting any heat energy) the heat energy will be less concentrated and its temperature will drop.  As the gas expands it does work on the retreating container wall and thermal energy is converted to mechanical energy.|`|i0Exuxi2aa	Okay, can I describe them in compare?<br>  Imagine two glasses of water.<br>  Glass 1 has 10ml of water with the temperature of 150 degrees. Glass 2 has 250ml of water with the temp of 100 degrees. <br>  Glass 1 has a higher temp, but less heat, while glass 2 has more heat but a lower temp.<br>  Basically, temp is just the temp of something, not considering the amount of the material (i.e. water), and heat is more like the temp of the material, considering volume, all summed up together. Hope that explains it.
DAMZKbpDaa	The sun is the major of the two sources of energy on earth (the other being nuclear decay).<br>  <br>  Light comes in from the sun in a broad spectrum of electromagnetic radiation. Most are reflected or absorbed, heating the atmosphere (sorry, truth hurts). Many, especially in the visible light range, pass through the atmosphere and heat the earth underneath (the air is mostly clear to the visible spectrum).<br>  <br>  Carbon dioxide is opaque to certain limited frequencies of infrared. (water is more opaque, but why confuse things?). When the earth heats, it radiates infrared, which is absorbed or reflected back if the ray happens to hit a carbon dioxide molecule on the way out. Otherwise, it passes out to outer space.<br>  <br>  To deal with the vertical temperature profile of the atmosphere, one has to know what it is, and compensate for the adiabatic expansion of gasses to calculate "heat" as opposed to "temperature." One would predict on the model just given that it would be warmest nearest the earth (heat) gradually cooling until the upper atmosphere, where it would be warmed again from the slamming of high energy particles from mostly the sun against the air molecules.|`|AA10008098	Charles G has a good answer.  Also consider that the sun's energy arrives at earth as photons of pure white light (a mixture of all the colors) that can pass through the vacuum of space and even clear air without being absorbed.  When the photons strike matter (the ground) some are reflected but most are absorbed and interact with the electrons orbiting atoms and molecules in the ground.  This heats the ground and the air just above the ground that rises and is replaced by cooler air.<br>  <br>  The temperature of the air depends upon how much heat energy it has received which is exhibited by the average velocity (kinetic energy) of individual gas molecules.  At sea level the atmospheric pressure is maximum (with the full weight of the air column above pressing down).  As you gain elevation there is less air above and the pressure is reduced and the air is less dense.  Therefore, thermal energy is less concentrated and the temperature is reduced.

Later, Johannes Kepler estimated the AU was at 24 million kilometers (15 million miles). In 1672, Giovanni Cassini made a much better estimate by using Mars. By observing Mars from Paris and having a colleague, Jean Richer, also observe Mars at the same time in French Guiana in South America, Cassini determined the parallax of Mars. From that Cassini was able to calculate the distance from Earth to Mars, and then the distance from Earth to the Sun. Cassini calculated the AU to be at 140 million kilometers (87 million miles), which is lower, but very close to the modern day number.<br>  <br>  I just showed you how different scientists found out the distance. The distance is 87 million miles/140 million kilometers calculated by Cassini.

iQvkT8Doaa	Homework, or homework assignment, refers to tasks assigned to students by their teachers to be completed mostly outside of class, and derives its name from the fact that most students do the majority of such work at home. Common homework assignments may include a quantity or period of reading to be performed, writing or typing to be completed, problems to be solved, a school project to be built (such as a diorama or display), or other skills to be practiced.<br>  <br>  Main objectives and reasons for homework<br>  <br>  The basic objectives of assigning homework to students are the same as schooling in general: To increase the knowledge and improve the abilities and skills of the students. However, opponents of homework cite homework as rote, or grind work, designed to take up children's time, without offering tangible benefit.[1] Homework may be designed to reinforce what students have already learned,[2] prepare them for upcoming (or complex or difficult) lessons, extend what they know by having them apply it to new situations, or to integrate their abilities by applying many different skills to a single task. Homework also provides an opportunity for parents to participate in their children's education.<br>  Amount of homework required<br>  <br>  <br>  This section needs additional citations for verification. Please help improve this article by adding reliable references. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. (August 2008)<br>  A review of over 60 research studies showed that, within limits, there is a positive correlation between the amount of homework done and student achievement. The research synthesis also showed that too much homework could be extremely counterproductive, causing students to "burn out". The research supports the "10-minute rule", the commonly accepted practice of assigning 10 minutes of homework per day per grade-level. For example, under this system, 1st graders would receive 10 minutes of homework per night, while 5th graders would get 50 minutes' worth, 9th graders 90 minutes of homework, etc.[3]<br>  Many schools exceed these recommendations or do not count assigned reading in the time limit.[4]<br>  In the United Kingdom, recommendations on homework quantities were outlined by the then Department for Education in 1998. These ranged from 10 minutes daily reading for 5-year-olds, to up to 2.5 hours per day for the pupils in Year 11 aged 15 or 16.[5]<br>  Homework strategies<br>  <br>  Effective study skills can help to speed up the completion of homework, giving a student more free time.<br>  In cases where the teacher assigns homework verbally or on the chalkboard, the student can avoid forgetting or misremembering the assignments by writing them down and keeping them well-organized in a notebook, planner, or agenda. It is also recommended that one develop a strategy that decreases the student's chances of forgetting completed homework at home.[6]<br>  Students with a positive attitude toward homework, who enjoy it and work on it enthusiastically, generally complete their homework faster than if they view their homework negatively. Reluctance and resistance can make homework take longer. Minimizing distractions,[7] by studying in a quiet room and leaving the TV off, etc, make it easier to concentrate and get homework done faster, while doing a better job. Contrary to specialists' recommendations, there is no evidence that the radio, as opposed to the television, hinders performance. This may be because radios emit only audio and no video, so there is less distraction.[7]<br>  One approach for minimizing the amount of homework a student has to do at home is for the student to complete as much of it as possible while still at school. Spare time between classes, during lunch, and especially during classes may be enough to get most or even all of the student's homework completed, depending on how much is assigned. This approach may have negative consequences, such as causing students to skip lunch or miss important information in other courses.[citation needed]<br>  Homework resources<br>  <br>  Internet homework resources<br>  <br>  <br>  Computers are often used to complete homework assignments.<br>  There are many homework-related resources available on the World Wide Web.[8] There are web-sites dedicated to communicating about homework, for teachers to post assignments on-line for students, and to keep parents informed. Many schools host their own homework posting services on their websites. There are non-profit organizations on-line that help students with their homework for free. There are also tutorials on most school subjects, especially math, which students can use if they don't understand their homework assignments.<br>  Many libraries provide on-line resources which present subjects specifically for students who are looking for something to write about. And there are archives of ready-made homework assignments, including handouts, which teachers can use to provide homework to their students.

xld3BqZhaa	Thats basically what radioactivity is, isnt it? Like how neutrons decay into protons and electrons and antineutrinos in beta decay, or whatever they do. <br>  <br>  But as for stable atoms, I dont think they (or the subatomic particles) would decay, because of all the conservation laws. I mean, the proton is the most stable of all the baryons. It can't decay into other things because baryon number has to be conserved.<br>  <br>  And you cant just have all the neutrons in atoms decaying into protons because they're more stable. Its to do with energy levels, see the source.<br>  <br>  So... I hope that helped a bit. I'll stop pretending to know what I'm talking about now.|`|FT4mVJMzaa	There is no such thing as "energy form."

Everything around would be blurry with no dimensions, and colours would be mixed.|`|o66JpGfHaa	It depends upon the specific geometry of the problem. For example, in a very hot day, when traveling on a road you can see what seems a spot of water on the road. It is indeed the blue light rays coming from the sky whose path continuously change its direction due to different temperatures of air layers above the road. Different temperatures causes different refraction index of the air and make light rays travel along a curve path. You are seeing a piece of the sky where it really exists the road.|`|GvLOIgWqaa	probably a bent image of light.<br>  take a black hole for example, light enters and becomes disrupted by strong forces. it bends and probably becomes another form of energy.<br>  you would probably see distorted images.|`|Qn6mtaZFaa	yeap right u can see a stright line|`|v8INGQ6taa	a glare

In some cases (such as the burnt-out Windscale reactor in the UK) they were used to produce radioactive materials for nuclear weapons. And some small-scale reactors are used to produce radioactive isotopes that are used in industry and medicine (americium, for example, is used in smoke detectors; molybdenum-99 is used as the precursor to technetium-99, which is used in radioactive imaging in medicine).

nTKuRFlKaa	C. the shape and size.<br>  <br>  *In the US, the length and diameter of a nail is designated by its penny size. This unit's abbreviation is d (e.g. 10d for 10 penny nails), as for British pence before decimalization. A smaller number indicates a shorter, thinner nail and a larger number indicates a longer, thicker nail (e.g. common 10d nails are .148" in diameter and 3" long). Nails under 1? in., often called brads, are sold mostly in small packages with only a length designation (e.g. ?" (12 mm), 1?" (28 mm), etc.).<br>  <br>  It is commonly believed that the origin of the term "penny" in relation to nail size is based on the old custom in England of selling nails by the hundred. A hundred nails that sold for six pence were "six penny" nails. The larger the nail, the more a hundred nails would cost, hence the larger nails have a larger number for their penny size.<br>  <br>  This however is a false legend: the reference is instead to the nominal mass of the nail expressed in pennyweight (dwt), 1/20 of a Troy ounce.

lMN59lv2aa	If previous generations thought along the lines of "don't mess with it," we wouldn't have many of the medical advances that we enjoy today. Antibiotics alone have led to at least a doubling of the human life span, and have virtually eliminated many once-common killers.<br>  <br>  To my mind, the question isn't "Should we..." but "WHEN should we." We are not yet ready to make huge alterations to the genome, but some small alterations may well be called for. For example, a new procedure is ready for testing in AIDS patients that inserts a modified gene for CD4 receptors into T-cells, thus rendering them immune to HIV infection. Perhaps in the near future similar gene insertions could be devised to enable people with diabetes to produce normal levels of insulin.<br>  <br>  At this point, genetic engineering is very young, so today's experiments should probably focus on altering somatic (rather than germ-line) cells. This could treat many chronic diseases WITHOUT leaving these changes in future offspring, thus minimizing any "unintended consequences."<br>  <br>  For the most part, I believe that our efforts of the next century or so will be focussed mainly on reducing or reversing the effects of harmful mutations. Beyond that time, who knows...|`|AA12010793	This is an ethical question that's been tackled way too many times by scientists and average people everywhere. I believe the minute that humans begin changing their composition to improve themselves, we stop becoming human, and instead become machines that can have parts removed and inserted for efficiency. Anyway, as humans we each have different perceptions of what's "better" and so it will be difficult to define and act on such an impulse. Also, isn't that sort of like plastic surgery? Changing oneself for your own personal conceived notion of what is better? Do you think cosmetic plastic surgery is ethical?|`|5DOfJeNNaa	It's clearly an ethical question - what do you mean by "improve" It has evolved and survived this far, against many odds. It has mechanisms that remove poor performing organisms from the genetic pool (Darwinism) and allows what may appear to be limiting (of deficient) genes to allow for the survival of some organisms in the right environment (sickle cell anaemia).<br>  <br>  To decide what we need to "improve" we would have to look at what we consider to be a failing. Medical advancement will usually be interested in prolonging life or improving the quality of life of an organism. Genetic engineering can prove beneficial in these circumstances to the indiduals affected, but its benefit or otherwise to wider society creates its own considerations and conflicts.<br>  <br>  Do we engineer to tailor make individuals and if we do can we be sure that we completely foresaw all confounding variables and possible long-term interactions within any given Biosphere (and if we get it wrong does it matter).<br>  <br>  Huge subject in itself "should I act as God does? Do I understand the true essence of God"|`|nAD4ArHraa	Nope - don't mess with it.  The Law of Unintended Consequences will show up if we do this, and suddenly we'll be a species that is immune to cancer and AIDS, but for some odd reason can only produce male offspring, or some other deal-killer like that.<br>  <br>  If we can make small, deliberate changes in specific individual embryos to prevent certain serious birth defects, that might be worthwhile, but again - watch out for the unintended consequences.|`|b9c206476271de6c0a321ebe042eb7f6aa	Yes.  We should cure sickle-cell anemia, Tay-Sachs, Huntington syndrome, phenylketonuria, hemophilia, and plenty of other genetic diseases.<br>  <br>  Then we should think about fixing things like colorblindness, lactose intolerance, albinism.|`|YYLybWHSaa	First this fixing would not be by removing a 'gene' it would be by removing/altering alleles that are known to always link to disease states. The functional versions (alleles) of the gene must be retained.<br>  <br>  Genes are controlled in when they are expressed, in what cells they are expressed, and often in what splice variant they are expressed. <br>  The 25,00 genes produce some 90,000 proteins that are combined in multiple ways through out embryogenesis and later in growth & repair of the body. Some combinations are more likely to produce diseases than others but that can not be fixed by eliminating alleles only by avoiding those combinations of alleles.<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_splicing" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative...</a><br>  <br>  We could not just eliminate a gene without eliminating it from all the many different jobs it has. Just because one job is not done very well does not means all its jobs are not done well. Rather we must learn all the normal functions  plus how every variant allele alters the functions. Only then could decisions be made about eliminating alleles from the genome.<br>  When a species has a larger gene pool it has greater chances of surviving shifts in its habitat. We live in an enormous range of habitats so need as wide a variation as possible in the genome.  We would not just eliminate all disease causing alleles because that would drastically reduce our genetic variation. Where possible we might alter the alleles to eliminate or reduce the malfunction if possible without altering its function in other jobs. Otherwise we would inform people of behavior that could trigger disease states to reduce risk from genetic based diseases developing.<br>  <br>  When we know what environmental triggers produce a disease state with some combinations of alleles we can plan to prevent the disease rather than reduce the species genetic variability. If children were haplotype mapped (told what alleles they carried) they could be informed about what risks to avoid. <br>  Example:<br>  Many people carry the genetic predispositions for diseases like diabetes type I but not all get sick. Not all people with the diabetes genotype manifest the disease. Understanding the exact progression of triggering an autoimmune disease can alter the risk of carrying the disease causing alleles.  It turns out that people living in regions with more sunlight make more vitamin D so have far lower incidences of type I diabetes as adults. So those people who inherit diabetes type I alleles need to receive more vitamin D to help prevent expressing the disease.|`|Xl7Hak1Zaa	Yes. I feel that the human genome should be improved. This would make the species more adaptive and survival. <br>  <br>  By working in an environment such as the office, humans could make use of DNA which couch potatoes grasp such as a heavy structured behind and a lazy revolving base.|`|AA10283947	Leave it to nature, the way of the universe is far smarter than some people would have us believe, nature finds its own faults and has built in systems to rectify faults over time by weeding out the weaker within a species.<br>  Science does it far too quickly to allow for the safety factor of time to flag up,  time for the consequences to be thwarted or averted naturally.<br>  Look at the state the poor old bees are in at present, some claim it is because they are transported too great a distance too many times per season, firstly a field of barley, next pineapples, then vineyards and back to corn never settling and feeling secure in a home environment, thus they have become stressed and are dieing off at an alarming rate, all because we know better.<br>  Leave it to nature and they will recover, allow science to get involved and we could loose them for ever, as someone once said "without bees... we'd have five years to live"... unless we get the Chinese to manually pollinate the crops with a feather.|`|9it5nGJjaa	Yes. It would be so cool! We all ready have stuff locked inside our brains that we haven't even tapped yet. We only use 10% of our brains; if we find a way to harness the rest of the 90% we aren't using, there would be no stopping to what we could do.|`|URZeQfQCaa	i think thats what EVOLUTION is for, dont ya think? natural selection is surely better than playing god.
VlsvYCzuaa	Superposition: newer sediments are deposited on top of older ones. So unless there has been extreme disturbance, older rocks are overlain by younger ones.<br>  <br>  Index fossils are fossils that occur over a large area and are unique. If you find the same fossil in two different places, the rocks in which you find them must be of the same age.<br>  <br>  Superposition and index fossil can thus be used to determine the relative ages of rocks (which one is older than the other, not the exact ages)<br>  <br>  Rocks that are older than the earliest fossils can still be ages using superposition.

oVz6sPsIaa	Let us talk about the ideal case and then let's talk about real life....<br>  As the magnet enters the coil, assuming that there is a complete circuit that allows current to flow, yes the magnet will slow down because there will be an induced magnetic field in the coil which contains stored energy.   However passing through the coil, upon exiting, the magnet will recover the energy lost and it will speed back up. In real life, the complete coil circuit will have resistance.  This resistance will dissipate the magnetic field of the coil that was created by the induced current.  The energy is dissipated as heat generated by the resistance.|`|qaMPEdL2aa	The magnet will slow down.  The energy resulting from current in the coil will come at the expense of the kinetic energy of the magnet.|`|GjR4pEDyaa	Yes the velocity of the magnet will slow down ???<br>   because the cylinder magnetic field flow in the opposit diraction of the coil magnetic field this cause to slow down the velocity|`|KHjYq2bHaa	The current in the long coil creates a magnetic field in the opposite direction to the permanent magnet.

pXqjKcq7aa	What do you mean by blending traits? Do you mean the theory of blending inheritance (that was wrong)? Or do you mean incomplete dominance?<br>  <br>  The theory of incomplete dominance arose in the 19th century and stated that an offspring are an average of its parents. However this proved to be incorrect. <br>  <br>  Incomplete dominance is the correct modern way of thinking. <br>  Here is an example of incomplete dominance:<br>  A red flower has RR genotype and a white flower has rr genotype. The offspring of the red flower and the white flower will all be Rr genotype (draw a punnett square to see this if you don't understand). If the offspring's genotype Rr is pink, this is a called in incompletely dominant trait. The offspring is not the same color as either parent.

rI7lfuN9aa	River water flowing over a steep grade contains more potential energy than an equal amount of sea water in waves.|`|qiLKlSmHaa	This souds like a homework question?  First, the small river is a single small location...its alot easier to build infrastructure around it to capture energy.  Second, all the energy is produced in that one area so you only have to target that river.  How would you begin to collect energy from currents that run thousands of miles?  Also, the energy is distributed throughout the current so its hard to pick one spot to collect it.  Finally, I'm not sure even sure how you could collect energy from currents...does that technology/machines exist?

F4phWwBdaa	Well, I can think of a "fun" idea.<br>  This is to demonstrate the functions of the 3 main types of neurons. <br>  Start off with a quick explanation of each neuron and its function. Once everyone understands, you get to play a game!<br>  Have teams of 3. Have a question written on the board. Keep it hidden. One person will read the question and run to the next teammate who will answer the question (teammate 2 can't move). He will give the answer to the third teammate who will run and give you the answer. Make it a race and have a candy bar as a prize. You can do 5 questions or something and teams can't solve the next question until they get the right answer to the previous question. Good way to demonstrate this if you have a class with a lot of energy.<br>  Finish with a summary and I think you'll have a pretty good project.

However, from another post without the deuterium there, the poster was still seeking another answer. <br>  <br>  Since this compound is in equilibrium with the other tautomers, incorporation of deuterium could be expected to occur there. However, in a chemical mechanism or logic point of view, that deuteration reaction is not part of the formation of product, especially if noted for the non-deuterated example.

TL1Jkqunaa	I wonder if this is meant to be a trick question.  All the original rock of the continent is older than the rift that splits it.  Al the rock that gets eroded and transported is older than the rift.

The basic premise is that sea floor is created at spreading centers.

LhwaVIgtaa	There are actually two reasons, which are completely unrelated, and one will most likely be more appropriate to your analysis. The first, kinda stupid answer is that cyclohexane is achiral, (has 2 equivalent protons and 2 equivalent carbons attached to each carbon) and thus has no stereoisomeric center. However, if you're speaking of derivatives displaying the cyclohexane moiety, then the reasoning lies behind the presence of the (ether) C-O-C bond attached to the C1 (I'm using glucose, but the others should be analogous.) One of the lone pairs of electrons on that ether C-O-C oxygen picks up a proton from water (forming an oxonium ion, which is a good leaving group). A pair of electrons on the 1' alcohol then forms a π bond (giving a protonated aldehyde on C1) and kicking off the leaving group.

l0Ojx5DCaa	Your wording is questionable, so I'll make some assumptions.<br>  <br>  You're saying that the probability that a single randomly selected person is male is 78%, while the probability that a single randomly selected person is female is 22%. As well, you're assuming that each selection is independent of each other. Then, you're randomly selected fifty different people. If all of this is true, then continue to read.<br>  <br>  Let the probability that a single selection is male be p = 0.78.<br>  Let the probabliity that a single selection is female be q = 0.22.<br>  Let the number of people selected be n = 50.<br>  <br>  Probability of selecting 50 males is (0.78)*(0.78)*...*(0.78)*(0.78)<br>  Or more simply, (0.78)^50 = 0.000004025<br>  <br>  Probability of selecting 50 females is (0.22)^50 = 1.322 * 10^-33.<br>  <br>  Both of these events are unbelievably unlikely.<br>  <br>  The find the probability of 20 or more women, or 20 or less women, you would have to make and sum 20+ calculations. Alternatively, since your selections constitute a binomial random variable, and since np and nq are both greater than 10, you can convert the binomial random variable to a normal random variable (the break-point of both np and nq being greater than 10 is a common statistical assumption).<br>  <br>  Since we are asking questions about the number of women, we will use q for the expected mean. A binomial random variable is converted to a normal random variable by finding assuming that the normal mean is nq and the normal standard deviation is (npq) ^ (1/2). So, your selection constitutes a normal random variable with mean of (0.22 * 50) = 11, and a standard deviation of (0.78 * 0.22 * 50) ^ (1/2) = 2.93. The expected number of women is 11 with a standard deviation of 2.93.<br>  <br>  The normalized score of 20 in relation to the given mean and standard deviation is (20 - 11)/2.93 = 3.07. The probability that a standard normal random variable exceeds the mean by more than 3.07 standard deviations is (according to a standard normal table) is about 0.0011.<br>  <br>  So, the probability that the number of women is 20 is about 0.0011. This is slightly inexact because of the conversion from a binomial random variable to a standard normal, but it is correct to at least 4 decimal places, so I don't think we need to pursue the error further. Conversely, the probability that the number of women would be 20 or below would be (1 - 0.0011) = 0.9989.<br>  <br>  Speaking gently, there is a 99.9% change that the number of women is 20 or less. There is a 0.1% chance that the number of women is 20 or more. The chances that there are exactly 50 men or 50 women is miniscule. Small enough that I won't repeat the above calculations.

GgClh7dbaa	C. The number of eggs lost from each nest.<br>  <br>  The independent variable or variables is/are the one or ones that we set or choose, and the dependent variable is the one that we measure, and which depends on the independent variable(s). In this case, the distance of the nest from the trunk is the independent variable, and the number of eggs lost from each nest is the measure of the safety or danger associated with each distance. <br>  <br>  The type of bird might also be an independent variable, since the danger of being such and such number of centimeters away may be greater for one kind of bird than another. But only C is a dependent variable for our experiment. It varies, but we don't vary it. Nature does according to the independent variables: how far and what bird species.<br>  <br>  The predator may also vary, and although we wouldn't be varying it, it's not a dependent variable for our experiment because we're not looking for that data. The type of predator is not a measure of the danger, just how many eggs get snatched regardless of who does it. For example, ground predators may be a bigger threat to nests nearer the trunk, and owls may be a bigger threat to nests near the ends of the branches, but that doesn't tell us which one is more dangerous to the nest and will get more eggs, the only variable that is a measure of the danger.

HTmj2BXDaa	There are also halogens and LEDs (light emitting diodes).  You can get light from electric arcs, from gas flames, oil torches, buring wood, some materials "store up" light and give it off over time (phosphorescent materials).  Some animals and single cell organisms produce bioluminescence.  The light from our sun is created by nuclear fusion.  An atomic bomb (nuclear fission) produces a significant amount of light (but you have to read pretty fast because even thou it is not as fast as the speed of light, the shock wave is coming pretty quick).  <br>  <br>  All of these sources produce some electromagnetic radiation in the visible spectrum (which is what I think you meant by light).  Most of these do not produce perfect "white" light which means it is composed of the entire visible spectrum (the rainbow).  Most of these have characterisitic spectra based on the atoms and molecule that are producing the light.  That is why we can identify some of the chemical elements present in distant stars just by analyzing their light.

lMN59lv2aa	Protein synthesis is really not that hard to understand, once you break down the steps.<br>  <br>  Before a protein can be synthesized, its gene must be transcribed into messenger RNA (or mRNA). In eukaryotes, this happens in the nucleus. Transcription is not strictly speaking part of protein synthesis, so I'll describe it really briefly. An enzyme called RNA-polymerase temporarily unwinds the DNA encoding for the protein, builds the mRNA by base-pairing with one of the DNA strands, then rewinds the DNA.<br>  <br>  In eukaryotes, this mRNA (or more appropriately, pre-mRNA) usually undergoes some sort of "processing" while still in the nucleus to remove segments that are non-coding (known as introns) before being transported out of the nucleus for translation. Again, this is not strictly speaking part of protein synthesis.<br>  <br>  The mRNA is carried into the cell cytoplasm to a RIBOSOME. This is where protein synthesis (also called TRANSLATION) takes place in earnest, so I'll cover this in a bit more detail.<br>  <br>  The ribosome consists of two subunits, usually called simply the small subunit and the large subunit. (You may also sometimes see the terms "30S subunit" and "50S subunit" in prokaryotes; and "40S subunit" and "60S subunit" in eukaryotes. See figure 1: <a href="http://img156.imageshack.us/img156/5541/img001.gif" rel="nofollow">http://img156.imageshack.us/img156/5541/...</a> ) With the help of certain enzymes called "initiation factors," first the small subunit of the ribosome binds to the mRNA. (Figure 2: <a href="http://img11.imageshack.us/img11/103/img002.gif" rel="nofollow">http://img11.imageshack.us/img11/103/img...</a>  Figure 3: <a href="http://img408.imageshack.us/img408/2668/img003.gif" rel="nofollow">http://img408.imageshack.us/img408/2668/...</a> ) With the help of another initiation factor, next the large subunit binds to the small subunit, and translation can begin. This initiation factor also carries with it the first tRNA and amino acid for the protein, which is ALWAYS the amino acid methionone. (Figure 4: <a href="http://img408.imageshack.us/img408/1669/img004.gif" rel="nofollow">http://img408.imageshack.us/img408/1669/...</a>  Figure 5: <a href="http://img156.imageshack.us/img156/6681/img005.gif" rel="nofollow">http://img156.imageshack.us/img156/6681/...</a> )<br>  <br>  Now, transfer RNAs (or tRNAs) are able to enter the ribosome at what is called the "A" site. tRNAs each carry a specific amino acid at one end, and at the other they have three unpaired bases, called an "anticodon." When the tRNA enters the ribosome, the anticodon is aligned with three exposed bases of the mRNA, called the "codon." If the anticodon doesn't match the codon, that tRNA cannot enter the ribosome; only the correct tRNA can progress protein synthesis.<br>  <br>  When the correct tRNA (with its amino acid, figure 6: <a href="http://img11.imageshack.us/img11/9903/img006.gif" rel="nofollow">http://img11.imageshack.us/img11/9903/im...</a> ) enters the A site, the amino acid on the previous tRNA (the one at the P site) is linked to the amino acid on the incoming tRNA and released from its own tRNA. (Figure 7: <a href="http://img11.imageshack.us/img11/6570/img007.gif" rel="nofollow">http://img11.imageshack.us/img11/6570/im...</a>  Figure 8: <a href="http://img11.imageshack.us/img11/6890/img008.gif" rel="nofollow">http://img11.imageshack.us/img11/6890/im...</a> )<br>  <br>  The ribosome shifts along the mRNA, exposing the next codon at the A site, and shifting the tRNAs from the A and P sites to the P and E sites, respectively. (Figure 9: <a href="http://img408.imageshack.us/img408/1596/img009.gif" rel="nofollow">http://img408.imageshack.us/img408/1596/...</a> ) The tRNA at the E site, which no longer carries an amino acid, exits the ribosome. (Figure 10: <a href="http://img156.imageshack.us/img156/2926/img010.gif" rel="nofollow">http://img156.imageshack.us/img156/2926/...</a> ) Meanwhile, the next tRNA-amino acid enters at the A site. (Figure 11: <a href="http://img11.imageshack.us/img11/2325/img011.gif" rel="nofollow">http://img11.imageshack.us/img11/2325/im...</a> ) Again, the P-site amino acid binds to the A-site amino acid and releases from its tRNA. (Fig 12: <a href="http://img11.imageshack.us/img11/3037/img012.gif" rel="nofollow">http://img11.imageshack.us/img11/3037/im...</a>  Fig 13: <a href="http://img156.imageshack.us/img156/7528/img013.gif" rel="nofollow">http://img156.imageshack.us/img156/7528/...</a> )<br>  <br>  This process repeats (Fig 14: <a href="http://img408.imageshack.us/img408/4334/img014.gif" rel="nofollow">http://img408.imageshack.us/img408/4334/...</a> ) until a specific codon, known as a termination codon or stop codon, arrives at the A site of the ribosome. (Fig 15: <a href="http://img11.imageshack.us/img11/1120/img015.gif" rel="nofollow">http://img11.imageshack.us/img11/1120/im...</a> ) At this point, another enzyme called a release factor enters the ribosome at the A site, rather than a tRNA. (Fig 16: <a href="http://img156.imageshack.us/img156/6052/img016.gif" rel="nofollow">http://img156.imageshack.us/img156/6052/...</a> ) The release factor catalyzes the release of the chain of amino acids from the final tRNA, which is now at the P site (Fig 17: <a href="http://img408.imageshack.us/img408/1684/img017.gif" rel="nofollow">http://img408.imageshack.us/img408/1684/...</a> ), and causes the two subunits of the ribosome to disassociate from the mRNA, thus completing translation. (Fig 18: <a href="http://img11.imageshack.us/img11/4582/img018.gif" rel="nofollow">http://img11.imageshack.us/img11/4582/im...</a> )<br>  <br>  I've added some crappy little MS-Paint images to illustrate the process. Hopefully these will help make it clear!<br>  <br>  – Wil|`|ze9Pah8Gaa	As simplistic as possible: You chromosomes come packed with DNA. This DNA is coded for thousands of proteins that perform the millions of cellular processes in our bodies. Proteins are the most abundant and some of the most important things in our bodies. As a chromosomes DNA unravels mRNA is translated by using that DNA as a template. Ie. if the DNA sequence is AAGCTT the mRNA would be UUCGAA. From this mRNA strand a tRNA strand is brought together with this mRNA strand and their codons and anti-codons are matched. Codons are sets of three nucleotide sequences, ie, ACG, is a codon. The process of this synthesis is carried out by Ribosomes, which are organelles found in all cells. The ribosome is formed by two chains of RNA called rRNA and a lot of other proteins. The ribosome attaches itself to the end of the mRNA and tRNA and adds amino acids to these strands to produce a new protein.
TfwYPeV3aa	This problem takes advantage of one of the properties of light as it crosses between two different mediums: refraction.<br>  <br>  First we need to find what angle the light hits the surface of the water. To do this we construct a right triangle with 1.2 m as its height and 3 m as its length. We find the angle θa to be equal to arctan(1.2/3) = .381 radians.<br>  <br>  Next we use the equation for refraction, using the index of refraction (Na) of air to be about 1.000 and index of refraction of water (Nw) to be about 1.333.<br>  <br>  sin(θa) x Na = sin(θw) x Nw<br>  <br>  sin(.381) x 1.000 = sin(θw) x 1.333<br>  <br>  θw = .279 Radians from the perpendicular.<br>  <br>  Now we construct yet another right triangle using this angle as well as the 2.1 meters given to us in the problem, which we'll use as the height.<br>  <br>  tan(.279) = 2.1/d<br>  <br>  d = 2.1 / tan(.770) = 7.331 m from where the light entered the water originally.

O7rMKLEMaa	In my Fractal Foam Model of Universes, ethereal pressure waves (dark energy) exchange momentum with ethereal shear waves. This exchange is the ultimate cause of everything in our universe. But the pressure waves are caused by sub-universe cosmic-foam bubbles popping, and time reversal turns that into un-popping ether-foam bubble in our universe. So the cause of the pressure waves which drive our present lies in our future, which is the sub-universe past. This time reversal of cause and effect may explain what appears to be instantaneous action at a distance in our universe.|`|77cb033374598e8c10938763c9fe03f7aa	It is a theory but it is not True any and all influences between points in space takes time and is limited by the speed of light.|`|a1VK1L64aa	It does appear that space = 0 (not a factor) in quantum entanglement.

This can be shown through tedious but straightfoward analytic geometry and differentiation.  For an easier way, we know that for a circle, the minimum is the line with slope = -1 and length 2r, so since the ellipse is an affine transform of a circle, this mininum line now has the length a + b, with slope = -√(b/a).  A little work with the Pythagorean and some algebra can demonstrate this.
lMN59lv2aa	Eye color is determined by at least three different genes. One gene produces brown pigment, another produces green, and a third produces gray. Blue eyes result in the absence of all three pigments. For the purpose of this discussion, we'll label these B (for brown), G (for green), and Y (for gray).<br>  <br>  In each case, the allele that produces the pigment is dominant. Furthermore, the brown pigment can mask both the green and grey; and the green pigment can mask the grey.<br>  <br>  Thus you should see that it is possible for someone with brown eyes to carry the genes for all three pigments.<br>  <br>  In your case, the grey pigment is irrelevent, so I'll omit that from the rest of the discussion.<br>  <br>  Your paternal grandfather had blue eyes. This means that he must have been homozygous for the recessive alleles for both brown and green eye pigments:<br>  <br>  bbgg<br>  <br>  Your father must have inherited at least one of each of these, but since he had brown eyes, he must also have received the dominant B allele from his mother. But since the brown pigment masks the green, we cannot determine which allele she carried for the green (unless she had HAZEL eyes, in which case she was probably bBGG, thus guaranteeing your father inherited the 'G' allele.) Thus, your father's genotype could have been either:<br>  <br>  Bbgg -or- BbGg<br>  <br>  Now on to your mother. The only thing we can say for certain is that she must have carried at least one copy of the dominant B allele. Thus, her genotype was any of the following:<br>  <br>  BBGG, BBGg, BBgg, BbGG, BbGg, or Bbgg<br>  <br>  However, since YOU do not have brown eyes, that means your mother could not have been homozygous for brown eyes, either, leaving us with:<br>  <br>  BbGG, BbGg, or Bbgg.<br>  <br>  For you to have green eyes, you must have inherited the recessive 'b' allele from both parents. Furthermore, you must have inherited at least one copy of the dominant 'G' allele from either your father or mother. (You may have even inherited it from both. We don't have enough information to determine which.)<br>  <br>  "Sage green" eyes USUALLY (but not always) results from a genotype of bbGgYY (bringing the grey back into the discussion again), which means that both of your parents are probably carriers for the dominant 'Y' allele, also.<br>  <br>  However, it is very unusual that you have children showing brown eyes. How light or dark would you describe them? Has anyone ever described your eye color as "hazel" rather than "sage green?" Given your children's eye colors, this would make more genetic sense.<br>  <br>  EDIT: After seeing your answers to my questions, it makes more sense. Chances are, you are heterozygous for both brown and green eye pigment (genotype BbGg). This would result in hazel eyes, and would explain where your children get the brown gene, since your husband's light blue eyes obviously doesn't have it.<br>  <br>  I missed the last part of your question: No, green isn't a mutation per se; it has its own gene. However, the green pigment is often masked by the brown when it is present.|`|73b14b603d54a8ec9ccaff378cb52bb1aa	your green eyes r probobly a gene that is just not seen much in ur family. see i have blond hair and my last relitive to have blond hair lived 150years ago... u got a rarer gene insted of the dominite gene in ur family.|`|5FuRcRdKaa	No it's hereditary.

Mol of C will be 80/12 and mol of H will be 20/1. Mol ratio of C and H will be 80/12 : 20 = 20/3 : 20 = 1 : 3 so the empirical formula = CH3. You just need molecule mass (Mr) to find molecule formula of the compound.

XydWCwZVaa	In traditional logic, an axiom or postulate is a proposition that is not proved or demonstrated but considered to be either self-evident, or subject to necessary decision. Therefore, its truth is taken for granted, and serves as a starting point for deducing and inferring other (theory dependent) truths.<br>  <br>  In propositional logic, a tautology (from the Greek word ταυτολογ?α) is a propositional formula that is true under any possible valuation (also called a truth assignment or an interpretation) of its propositional variables. For example, the propositional formula ("A or not-A") is a tautology, because the statement is true for any valuation of A. The philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein first applied the term to propositional logic in 1921|`|1EEKnaWOaa	A axiom is a fundamental rule that cannot be proved( but you've got to start somewhere) whereas a tautology is proved by logic.

AA11513203	It's not just about the Y-chromosome.<br>  <br>  The Y-chromosome is just one of 46 chromosomes that humans have (and only males have it).   It is also one of the 48 chromosomes that chimps have (and only males have it) ... and gorillas, and orangutans, and gibbons.   It is also one of the chromosomes that all primates have (and only males have it).   In fact, almost all mammal species have a Y-chromosome.<br>  <br>  This is the chromosome that (for the most part) determines whether mammals are male.<br>  <br>  When scientists say that humans share 98.8% DNA with chimps, they are referring to *all* the chromosomes, and *all* genes.   It means that out of every 1,000 "letters" in the genetic DNA, we find that about 988 of those letters are the same in both species.   With gorillas, the number is 984 (98.4%).   With orangutans the number is 976 (97.6%).   THAT is the evidence that humans share a common ancestor with these other apes ... not just the single 98.8% number with chimps ... it is the *ever-smaller* amount of commonality between humans and other species, as you go further out from humans on the tree of classification (from great apes, to lesser apes, to the monkeys and other primates, to the mammals, to the birds and reptiles, to the other vertebrates, to the other animals ... and beyond.    <br>  <br>  The fact that we have so much DNA in common with the chimps is only a tiny piece of the puzzle.<br>  <br>  (Incidentally, I should also mention that the exact number can be different as you examine other sources, as it can depend on whether you are including *genetic* DNA (DNA that actually codes for something) or *non-genetic* DNA (DNA that doesn't actually code for anything).  Again, it's not the exact number that matters (it's always between 92% to 99%) ... but this *PATTERN* of ever-smaller commonality with the other species.)

It's 7.5 but you only have 7 mols.<br>  <br>  So it must be H2 the limiting reagent. All 7 mols of H2 consumed and mol of N2 = 7/3 = 2 1/3 = 2.33 mols.|`|ThYN1mFFaa	Notice that the ratio of moles N2 to moles H2 is 1:3, so it takes 3 times as much H2 as it does N2 for the reaction to go.  The ratio you have is 2.8 times as much H2 as N2 so THE H2 WILL BE LIMITING.|`|0w191D34aa	The best way is to compare the mols of these elements to the reactant.<br>  <br>  So, N2 : NH3                  H2 : NH3<br>         1  : 2                        3  :  2<br>  2.5mols: 5.0 mols        7 mols: 4.67 mols<br>  <br>  First you note down the coefficient of the reactant then the product. And write the amount of the reactant and multiply the mols with the coefficient. the coefficitn of the known amount of the reactant goes in the denominator and the unknown quantity in the numerator.<br>  <br>  So H2 is the limiting reagent of this equation because there is only 4.67 mols of NH3 that is created. but there are more mols when in N2.

For example, if they say the interests compounds quarterly, you use the first formula with n = 4 periods per year.<br>  <br>  The continuous compounding is just the limiting case of discrete compounding.  If you were to determine the limit as n goes to infinity, you'd end up with the continuous compounding formula.  You use it when the problem states that it requires continous compounding.

HyUE9ON0aa	The Ross seal is native to the Antarctic, which also includes the Ross Sea.<br>  The Seal gets its name from this sea.<br>  <br>  @@@@@@<br>  <br>  Because of their remote location they survived the slaughter that went on during 18th-19th century on other species of seals. Humans simply couldn't get to them to kill them.<br>  <br>  Population: 200,000 individuals  <br>  <br>  Ross Seals are very rarely seen, as they live deep within the consolidated pack-ice. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  @@@@@@<br>  <br>  The Ross Seal (Ommatophoca rossii) is a carnivorous seal of the family Phocidae and only species of the genus Ommatophoca. It is named after Sir James Clark Ross, who led the Erebus and Terror expeditions to the Antarctic. It is native to the Antarctic, including the Ross Sea, from which its name is derived. They eat meat<br>  <br>  @@@@@<br>  <br>  Ross seals are the least common of the four Antarctic seals. Until the 1970's, fewer than 100 people had actually observed one. Virtually inaccessible among the heavy pack ice surrounding the Antarctic continent, Ross seals have been protected from large-scale commercial hunting, which had decimated other seal populations in the 18th and 19th centuries. Much remains to be learned about this solitary species, which is becoming better studied as powerful icebreakers more frequently penetrate the densest interior regions of the pack ice. <br>  <br>  In appearance, Ross seals have dark grey to chestnut coats with buff undersides. Adults molt in January or February. They have relatively short heads and snouts, with very large eyes. Distinctive light and dark chestnut or chocolate stripes can be observed from the chin to the chest. These throat markings are clearly visible when the animal is disturbed. When approached it throws its head back, inflates its throat, and opens its small mouth revealing sharp, recurved incisors and canines. Ross seals also have the shortest hair of any seal. Females are typically larger than the males and most adults have small pale scars around the neck and shoulders. <br>  <br>  Specializing primarily on cephalopods, particularly squid, Ross seals' limited populations may be due to a lack of significant feeding resources. Fish and krill are preyed upon as well, but in lesser amounts. The Ross seal is believed to be able to feed at depths of several hundred feet, where its large eyes aid underwater vision. <br>  <br>  Ross seals reach sexual maturity between three and five years. Pups are born on pack ice in November, and are approximately 4 feet long and weigh about 60 pounds. Though rarely observed, the pups are born with dark brown fur which is lighter on the underside. The female nurses her pup alone for about 25 days after which the pup is weaned. <br>  <br>  Ross seals have distinctive vocalizations which they use to attract a mate or warn off intruders. These include: a trilling, siren-like call and a warbling-type sound known as 'chugging.' <br>  <br>  Ross seals are preyed upon by Killer whales and Leopard seals.

ze9Pah8Gaa	I just recently finished my Bachelors of Science in Biology. Ive come to realize that a bachelors in a hard science will only get you a lab assistant job at a laboratory if you are lucky! Unfortunately you must think beyond your bachelors. If you love science, get your degree in whatever section of it you love but always plan to get your M.A or Phd, otherwise you will make roughly 10-15 an hour and have very little vertical movement in a lab. I have searched and searched for jobs but especially now there is not much out there. I got married two months before graduation and because there are no jobs out there for me we have started a family, i am currently 4 months. So from my experience just get your foundation down now, ie a B.S in biochem, biology, chemistry or whatever but then think about your masters and then think about a forensic scientist, vet, etc. Just worry about getting excellent grades in your undergrad right now. Hopefully by the time you are out of school more opportunities will be there but i would doubt it. Good luck! dont worry about the long run right now, get your foundaton.

beCps1Ozaa	my thought is this I need to know the width by the length that is two sides of the rectangle kinda forming an L shape the length of the rectangle is three times the width. since I cut my rectangle in half I'll cut down the total perimeter to half as well. so I have 22 cm that needs to be divided up between two sides. the width is one part and the length is three times that so I'll divide the 22cm by the four parts giving me 5.5cm for the width and 16.5cm for the length, which is three times the width. add all four sides 16.5+16.5=33+5.5+5.5=44cm<br>  This is the best answer I have But I do not guarantee it to be correct, but in my mind it seems to be right everything adds up.

Gnfc4wRlaa	Sorry, I wasn't able to shorten it to a few sentences.<br>  <br>  Roswell Incident July, 1947<br>  A rancher named Mac Brazel discovered strange metal strewn across a wide area of range land.  Brazel took pieces of the debris to the authorities in Roswell, New Mexico.  Colonel Blanchard, commanding officer at Roswell Army Air Field, ordered two intelligence officers, Major Jesse Marcel and Captain Sheridan Cavitt to investigate.  Upon their report, Colonel Blanchard had  area cordoned off. Soldiers removed the debris, sending it to Army headquarters in Fort Worth, Texas. <br>  At first the Army command at Roswell issued a press release announcing it had recovered a "flying disk."  This press release was retracted, and further press coverage restricted. At a press conference in Fort Worth, the Army explained that the intelligence officer and others at Roswell had misidentified the debris, which was, according to them, the remains of a downed weather balloon.<br>  <br>  It was not until the late 1970s, with Jesse Marcel's decision to comment publicly on the strange material and other aspects of the Roswell event, that the UFO crash story was revived.  Roswell citizens who were around when the incident occurred reported being threatened by the military and ordered not to tell about what they knew of it.  Major Marcel said that he had been ordered to pose with weather balloon debris, but that it was not the debris recovered at the Roswell site.<br>  <br>  Area 51<br>  Area 51 is a nickname for a military base located in the southern portion of Nevada.

79c9c785d3b3b5697c24113df628c839aa	You are using non-standard terminology to describe quantum behavior. The underlying behavior of the quantum evolution of information is entirely deterministic. Meaning, if you know the current state of the system and know what forces it is subject to, you will exactly know the next state of the system.<br>  <br>  However, our experience is a projection out of the quantum realm. Meaning, information is lost as it becomes known to our senses (however amplified it may be by experimental equipment). It's as if we were a shadow cast from a higher-order-dimensional structure.<br>  <br>  Consequently, what we observe when we make a measurement is that all outcomes of quantum experiments are probabilistic, even though the underlying mechanics are deterministic. So, it is impossible to exactly determine the outcome of a measurement with absolute certainty. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|fLHs5dd1aa	Well, I'm not sure if it's common in the field to dismiss it as irrational. Generally, when we're talking about quantum behavior, we call it "non-deterministic"- basically, once you get down to the level of particles, the rules that massive objects (like stars, bowling balls, and people) follow don't apply, and you have to deal with probabilities rather than certainties. What the layperson might consider "rational" is merely a case of being conditioned to the specific case of low-velocity, medium-mass objects. When you're existing at such speeds and masses, the probabilities of quantum mechanics "multiply together" such that it becomes extremely improbable that systems will deviate from their Newtonian description. This doesn't mean that it's guaranteed, though- the probabilities are such that at least once in the history of the universe, it's likely that there will be an event of the same improbability as walking through a wall!

737e8ad896c16931d3da06dca8c8e2b4aa	Yes it is plausible. <br>  <br>  My reasons are several:<br>  <br>  First history:  With European settlement in the late 1700's eastern Ohio's vast forests were cleared for agriculture.  Settlers were relentless in their extermination of predator species and cougar, black bear, coyote, wolf and other species were driven from their former range.<br>  <br>  In the second half of the 20th century forests in parts of the state matured and expanded as agricultural land had been abandoned 50 years earlier. As a result we began to see the return of many species. Black bear are now established residents in Ashtabula and Geauga counties.  Coyotes are now common in many areas.  Fishers have made a comeback in New England and there is some anecdotal evidence they have returned to Ohio.  <br>  <br>  The history these species making their return follows a common pattern.  Anecdotal report dismissed by "experts" and officials. Physical evidence dismissed as escaped captive animals by "experts" and officials. Mounting evidence and sightings and then the quiet acknowledgment the species has returned.<br>  <br>  Last year the Ohio division of Wildlife issued a statement that there was no evidence of a "sustained breeding population of cougars in northeast Ohio."  after numerous sightings south of Cleveland. Sustained breeding population makes this statement very very specific and left open other possibilities without specifically confirming.<br>  <br>  That said.  I spend lots of time in some of the most remote areas of NE Ohio.  I have found evidence of Bobcat and Fisher.  but I have not seen any cougar sign. <br>  <br>  We make new discoveries about wildlife in Ohio all the time.  In 2004 a species of dragonfly (tiger spiketail) never before found in the state was found to have a breeding population in multiple locations.  In 2007 Common Loon was confirmed breeding in Geauga County, a first for the state.<br>  <br>  Given the history and changes in the landscape I find this very plausible.|`|kjAWsDwLaa	It's always possible, one was supposedly sighted in a city in western Indiana last week, causing a school to be locked down.

More importantly, that means methylammonium has more electron density on N than ammonium. That means methylammonium is more stable than ammonium. Therefore, ammonium is the stronger acid. Probably.

23hPHjOqaa	It is crucial you do biology and chemistry to full A-level, if you do not, no medical school will accept you.<br>  <br>  You can take another two courses (most people only do three) and drop one at AS level (so after your first year). Generally the best to take are either maths or physics, however if you want to take four A-level, you can take Biology, Chemistry, Maths/Physics and one of your choice, something you like just because you'll get a good grade in it, and when it comes to non-medically related subject medical schools will just look at grades.<br>  <br>  When it comes to medical schools, they all offer the same courses, though the final degree awarded is a little different (MBBS, MBChb, BM etc...) they are still all medical degrees and are equal in both curriculum and career progression. The best Universities are Cambridge and Oxford, however I wouldn't waste your time because its not the University you go to which makes you a "better" doctor its the course, and all the courses are the same no matter where you go.<br>  <br>  Choose a medical school based on your learning preferences (lecture-based, PBL (Problem-Based Learning) etc.. and how long into the course you get first patient contact (some courses you don't see a single patient until year 2-3, others you can meet patients within your first few weeks.)

AA12266052	* The United States Preventive Services Task Force recommends screening mammography, with or without clinical breast examination, every 1-2 years for women aged 40 and older.<br>  * Due to the high mortality associated with colon cancer and the high effectivity and low risks associated with colonoscopy, it is now also becoming a routine screening test for people 50 years of age or older.<br>  * The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the PSA test for annual screening of prostate cancer in men of age 50 and older. The American Cancer Society recommends that individual men discuss the potential benefits and risks of testing with their doctors in order to make an informed decision on whether or not to be tested. Screening should be offered annually to African-American men and those with a family history of prostate cancer upon reaching 45 years.<br>  * It is generally recommended that females who have had sex seek regular Pap smear testing. Guidelines on frequency vary, from annually to every five years. If results are abnormal, and depending on the nature of the abnormality, the test may need to be repeated in three to twelve months.<br>  * Women over age 65 should get a baseline DXA scan. Men with history of vertebral fractures or history of use of corticosteroids should also get a DXA scan|`|oVxr5B3Eaa	Mammography is 50. (I only know this because they called my mom to get hers and she chickened out)... <br>  Pap depends where you are. Some countries say as soon as you get your period. Some say when your 18. Some say when your sexually active. Some say only if you think there is a problem. Here in Canada they USED to say 18 or when you become sexually active, whichever happens FIRST, but now they say 21 or within 3 years of becoming sexually active. <br>  <br>  I'm not sure about the other ones, I think Colonoscopy and Dexa are around 50-65 (a little older anyways) and no idea about the prostate at all.

The force exerted on the bucket by the rope before the bucket moves is then the mass of the bucket (8 kg) times the acceleration due to gravity (9.8 m/s^2).  <br>  Gravity pulls downward.  Raising the bucket pulls it upward.  The acceleration placed on the bucket is then gravity plus the lifting acceleration.

The triangle represents the forces on the plane. The hypotenuse of the triangle is the 7394N force.  <br>  What you need to do is find the x and y components of that force using basic trig (for example, the force exerted in the x direction will be Fx=7394*cos(74.8deg). <br>  If what the question asks is for the WEIGHT of the plane, you're done.  The force that is purely up is equal to the weight of the plane--otherwise the plane would accelerate up or down. <br>  If you need the mass, there is one more step. Dividing the vertical force by gravity (in meters per square second) will give you the mass of the plane in kilograms.

92f97d29e3d55f3219cc25dfabd347c7aa	The main motivation for SUSY is fixing the heirarchy problem.  Without SUSY, the scale of the higgs mass should be very large, and it would be a very large coincidence for it to be as small as it appears to be.  Theorists don't like extraordinary coincidences.  WIth SUSY, the large divergences cancel in a very natural way--the loop corrections for particles get canceled by those of the superpartners.<br>  <br>  In addition, one of the superparticles could be responsible for the dark matter floating around galaxies.<br>  <br>  As for unification, that's a very uncertain thing.  But one interesting fact is that if you look at the running of the coupling constants for the different forces, they almost (but not quite) intersect at some large energy scale.  When you introduce SUSY, they run slightly differently and meet up to within the margin of error.  That doesn't hand us the grand unified theory.  But it is an interesting tidbit.|`|vSkqJ813aa	The original string theory, developed during the nineteen sixties, by Veneziano, did not include super-symmetric partners for the known particles. This first theory, was a 'bosonic' one in that all the vibration patterns of the strings had whole number spins. Photons of light are bosons with integer spin. However, particles with half-integer spin, such as the electron, are fermions and these particles could not be described by the original super string theory. In 1971, Pierre Ramond incorporated fermion spin, vibration patterns into the theory. In this new version of the theory, bosons and fermion spin, vibration patterns appeared in pairs. Thus, by 1977 the work of Gliozzi, Scherk (not the big green person in the cartoon (joke)), and Olive had made the superstring theory super symmetric! The problem with ‘this’ supper symmetry is it makes super string theory possible in five different ways, with differences between the competing theories!<br>  <br>  Hence, according to string theory each fermion (half-integer spin) such as a proton, a neutron, an electron, and a quark  are also accompanied by a bosonic (integer spin) super partner.  The LHC will search for these super partners as ‘proof’ of super string theories.<br>  <br>  P.S <br>  I should have added, that with five possible TOE theories, super string theory may be given some proof if a super boson is found but the overall theory of everything may well be still some way off in the distance. It seems that G?del’s incompleteness theorem, the inability of mathematics to fully prove itself logically, is somehow working its 'black-magic' within string theory.

RZF5KgiEaa	To keep A, B, and C in the same initial plane the force applied to A and C will also need to be in that plane.<br>  <br>  The force on A will, of course, be equal and opposite to the force on C.<br>  <br>  If you make your force coincide with the initial segment AC you can guarantee that the force is in the initial plane, and guarantee that the resulting positions of A and C remain in the initial plane.<br>  <br>  At least if you look at it from a purely geometric point of view.<br>  <br>  In practice (in real molecules), I believe that distances AB and BC will always be effected as the molecule responds to the additional force.

Sky-watchers with telescopes could have seen the object from Australia and Japan.<br>  <br>  The latest flyby was not the closest object to whiz by Earth in recent memory. In 2004, the tiny meteoroid 2004 FU162 came within 4,000 miles.<br>  <br>  The 2009 DD45 asteroid was about the same size as the so-called Tunguska object, which exploded over Siberia in 1908 and leveled more than 800 square miles of forest.|`|bae299c73e121a8a45067e0818073b1baa	Asteroid, not comet in both cases.<br>  <br>  The asteroid you are thinking about 2029/2036 is Apophis.

VkwrVPQHaa	As long as the probability is greater than 0, the event CAN happen.<br>  <br>  But some events (e.g. flipping a coin 1 million times on heads) are so incredibly unlikely that they are *almost* impossible. If you kept flipping a coin over and over, the universe would probably end before it landed on heads that many times.<br>  <br>  So the short answer to your original question is: No. Events can only become *almost* impossible.<br>  <br>  <br>  By the way, the probability of flipping a coin 1 million times on heads is 1/(2^1,000,000) = 1/(10^301,030) - roughly.<br>  So since one googol = 10^100, the probability of this event occurring is LESS than one in a googol googols!

2wcyi4sgaa	There are many reasons how and why transformation can be useful, granted you are talking about splicing a gene out of an organism, and putting it into another.  Many transformations are used to give a cell such as bacteria antibiotic resistance to  a certain drug, some are introduced into a new organism for fluorescence.  Sometimes transformations are done to "up" the production of a particular protein, such as a transcription factor.  Some are the opposite, they would be called repressors.

nTKuRFlKaa	*Pump for engine oil is designed for a particular viscosity .If it pumps higher viscosity oil pump will get overloaded and oil may not reach its destination .Read the following and you will come to know that the function of both types of oils is different.<br>  <br>  If you use non-recommended oil , it will hamper the performance in a long run which will put your generator in trouble at any time.<br>  <br>  Motor oil, or engine oil, is an oil used for lubrication of various internal combustion engines. While the main function is to lubricate moving parts, motor oil also cleans, inhibits corrosion, improves sealing and cools the engine by carrying heat away from the moving parts. The majority of motor oils are derived from petroleum. Motor oil mostly consists of hydrocarbons, organic compounds consisting entirely of carbon and hydrogen.<br>  <br>  -Other non-motor oils include gear or transmission, and differentials oils. These are used in manual gearboxes and driven axles. They could include specialty uses including EP (Extreme Pressure), hypoid, and limited slip functions.<br>  Again, they are not to be used for engine lubrication.<br>  <br>  Gear oil is a motor oil made specifically for transmissions, transfer cases, and differentials in automobiles, trucks, and other machinery. It is of a higher viscosity to better protect the gears and usually is associated with a strong sulfur smell. The high viscosity ensures transfer of lubricant throughout the gear train. This is necessary since the devices needing this heavy oil do not have pumps for transferring the oil with only a portion of the lowermost gears bathed in an oil sump. This heavy oil can create viscous drag leading to inefficiencies in vehicle operation. Some modern automatic transaxles (integrated transmission and differential) do not use a heavy oil at all but lubricate with the lower viscosity hydraulic fluid, which is available at pressure within the automatic transmission.|`|j1jysy6baa	Why do you want to screw up your home generator?<br>  Look in the manual and put the specified engine oil|`|UJAKJx3xaa	ask a mechanic|`|hwRdT156aa	gear oil isn't thick enough to keep the engine lubed|`|wJTsifugaa	You stand a good chance of frying the engine.  Gear oil normally runs at an SAE viscosity rating of around 90.  Small internal combustion engines would normally take a viscosity around 30 although they may take a multi viscosity oil like a car engine (check your manual).  So the much thicker oil may not reach everywhere that needs lubrication (especially the tighter clearances) and you stand the chance of having those parts overheat.

The electron is [one of]the elementary particle[s] which carries electric charge - and so you can have charged monopoles.  There is no particle that carries a "magnetic charge" - so no isolated north poles.<br>  <br>  If you imagine a bar magnet - it has a north (let's say red) half and a south (blue) half.  If you cut it in half, so you have only the red (north) half, the bottom half becomes the south pole - so you just have a smaller magnet and not a separate north pole.|`|aSjdL4heaa	Monopoles (a magnet with only one pole) are the stuff of science fiction.  They are theoretically possible - bot the Grand Unified Theory and String Theory require them.<br>  <br>  The link takes you to a more in-depth discussion|`|9yghYDo8aa	in theory it is possible , but in practice nobody ahve ever found one  and there is a high probability that anybody will find any , maybe with nanophysics they might be able to divide magnetic materials , like dividing their atoms , but for now we dont posess that technology|`|0ujkDPc6aa	You could do that by placing the magnet on the protonulite machine for at least 5 minute and bombard it with electron particle to complete the uni-demagnetise process.

Gnfc4wRlaa	No, it won’t.  None of the claims by the doomsday prophets are based on science, just wild speculation.<br>  The Mayans didn’t predict doomsday.  It is just the end of the current cycle of their Long Count calendar.<br>  Nostradamus didn’t predict it.  He never mentioned 2012 and all the Nostradamus "quotes" being thrown around aren't what he actually wrote. They are what some people have decided that he meant. Even Nostradamus scholars don't agree on how the various centuries and quatrains should be interpreted.<br>  The Bible never mentions 2012 or references it in any way.  It talks about the end times, but there is no mention of when.<br>  <br>  There is no actual scientific theory or evidence that anything unusual is going to happen in 2012. It is a collection of myths and disproven theories being promulgated by doomsday predictors, who predict a new one every few years. <br>  This timing is based on the end of the current cycle of the Mayan long count calendar. Their calendar was done in ages or cycles and their years ended at the winter solstice.  The current cycle ends December 21, 2012.  The Mayans didn’t predict the end of the world, only the end of that cycle.<br>  <br>  Nibiru (Planet X) doesn't exist. Zecharia Sitchin is not a scientist, but is an author of books promoting the ancient astronaut theory for human origins. He attributes the creation of the ancient Sumerian culture to the Annunaki (or Nephilim) from a hypothetical planet named Nibiru in the solar system. The Doomsayers predicted that it was to hit Earth in 2003. Undaunted when it didn't show up, they just moved it out to 2012 to coincide with the end of the current cycle of the Mayan calendar. <br>  <br>  Alignment of Solar System with galactic plane – There is no galactic alignment occurring in 2012.  It takes 36 years to precess through galactic equator, and we will be 6 degrees off in 2012.  Even if we did have an alignment, it would have no effect on us.  The vast distances involved outweigh the effects of gravity.<br>  <br>  Planetary alignment – it is impossible for all the planets to form a straight line out from the Sun (or viewed superimposed on each other in the sky) because each planetary orbit is tilted slightly with respect to the Earth's orbit.  John Gribbin in the late 1970's book  The Jupiter Effect  predicted the end of the world would occur in 1983 due a once in a millennium planetary alignment.   The 1983 event was ALL the other planets lined up as seen in our view of the sky -- not in a straight line as most people would misinterpret with the term alignment.  In 1999, The Survival Center had claimed the destruction of the Earth to occur in May 2000 due to the "planetary alignment."<br>  <br>  Asteroid Apophis - the collision alert was for 2029, and was canceled after additional observations showed it would not hit us.<br>  <br>  Geomagnetic reversal - These reversals of the magnetic field have occurred in the past, as shown by magnetic striping, but we can’t predict when they will occur again.  However, the time between reversals is not constant, varying from less than 100,000 years, to tens of millions of years. <br>  <br>  Although fast by geological standards, reversals are by no means quick on the human time scale. They take roughly 5,000 years, with estimates ranging from 1,000 years to 8,000 years.<br>  <br>  Homo Erectus and their ancestors survived previous reversals. There is no evidence of any extinctions resulting from these reversals. Although the inspection of past reversals does not indicate biological extinctions, present society with its reliance on electricity and electromagnetic effects (e.g. radio, satellite communications) may be vulnerable to technological disruptions in the event of a full field reversal. <br>  <br>  Photon belt - We are not heading for a photon belt in the Pleiades. The earth isn't heading toward the Pleiades but away from them. In the 1850s it was conjectured that the earth orbited the Pleiades, but this has long since been discredited. No photon belt or other such region of increased energy has been discovered. Photons in any case are merely particles of electromagnetic energy, which we commonly experience as light. Upon exposure to excess photons the most common transformation of your being is sunburn. <br>  <br>  Solar flares – These do increase and decrease in an eleven year cycle. They haven't caused any serious problems in the past. The direct effects of solar flares are mainly related to communications and radio transmissions. We had a major series of solar flares in 2005.|`|ad08fe27604f983a2b098f5c3a9bdfa5aa	The Mayan long count of days runs out of space in 2012, they predicted nothing for that.

We could also lose some plant species that are indegenous to the area. For example, the plants that are in Central Park that was brought over from England because they thought it would be nice to have all of the plants mentioned in one of Shakespeare's plays in NY. Those imported plants can take over the environment at times, many of them are aggressive and overpower the area. Deforestation can occur due to lumbering and development of land. Land cleared for agriculture uses can be detrimental to the soil. For example, slash and burn methods of agriculture can be useful for growing crops for a couple of years, but in the long run, the soil is depleted of all of its nutrients. This is why people who use slash and burn methods of farming are nomadic because they can't occupy one location for a long period of time. The land becomes unsustainable. <br>  <br>  I hope this was the kind of alterations in nature you were talking about. Good Luck.

By increasing the temperature, you would force the equilibrium to shift to the left.  This in turn should increase the amount of HF.<br>  <br>  For part 4, if you quantitatively remove UO2, equilibrium will attempt to be re-established by shifting the to the left, in other words, the amount of UO2 will increase.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!

XiMQLv8Oaa	Occam's Razor is the principle set forth by a Franciscan friar that says  when it comes to assumptions in a theory, "less is best."<br>  <br>  Let me illustrate on our own Big Bang Theory. There is the problem of "homogeneity" of space, and in order for it to be preserved, in addition to the many pressumptions of this theory, another pressumption has to be made: that space may have to stretch or contract equally or remain static. <br>  <br>  Another pressumption:<br>  That  before the Universe was a thousandth of a billionth of a second old, it consisted of hot  PLASMA, of essentially MASS-LESS fundamental particles that inter-acted with the FUNDAMENTAL FORCES. What are these fundamental particles? Another assumption, the QUARKS, BARYONS, MESONS  etc. And what are the fundamental forces? They are the WEAK, STRONG, ELECTROMAGNETIC and GRAVITATIONAL forces. What is this QUARK? It combines into triplets to form BARYONS and into doublets to form MESONS. A QUARK is the elementary particle that forms HADRONS such as PROTON, NEUTRONS and PIONS. And quarks are six types, which are  UP, DOWN, STRANGE, CHARM and the other two, for symmetry, TOP and BOTTOM.<br>  Additional assumption was that the Neutron consists of TWO DOWN QUARKS and one UP QUARK.  The PROTON was assumed to consists of TWO UP QUARKS and ONE DOWN QUARK.<br>  <br>  So to take the Big Bang, you have to swallow as well all the other pressumptions attached to it. It's not that I have anything against these "quarks" but I am only pointing out the issue of numerous pressumptions. So Occam, the Friar, pressumably can't take it anymore and made this principle of this Razor of his. "Less is Best."|`|a3a5074999cbc867b5f0aeb63bbc3f15aa	Hi Christer!<br>  <br>  Occam's Razor is principle of logic.  It holds that when you are confronted with conflicting hypotheses to explain something, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, the hypothesis that requires the fewest assumptions is likely the correct one.<br>  <br>  Here's an example from astronomy:<br>  <br>  There is compelling evidence that distant galaxies are millions or indeed billions of light years away from us, yet we can see them.  One possible explanation is that the universe is millions or billions of years old and that the light from them has been traveling millions or billions of years.<br>  <br>  Another possible explanation is that God created all the galaxies about six thousand years ago, complete with light that appears to have traveled almost but not quite all of the millions of years, so that it is just reaching us now, six thousand years later.<br>  <br>  Occam's Razor tells us that in the absence of evidence to the contrary, we should choose the former.  The second explanation requires extra assumptions, such as the existence of an otherwise unknown creative process that allows light generated by a star to instantaneously be transported millions of light years from its source, and indeed that God should choose to create conditions that falsely mimic great antiquity for the universe.  The first explanation, that the universe looks old because it IS old, is simpler, and is probably right unless evidence to the contrary be found.<br>  <br>  (Another possible explanation is that the galaxies are billions of light years away AND the universe is only six thousand years old, but because of physical laws currently undiscovered, light moves far faster than the 186,000 miles-per-second speed of light at great distances from us, or at different times in the past.  You can see how this hypothesis, too would violate the principle of Occam's Razor, because if there are such physical laws, they are as yet unknown and we would have to assume them.  Since we currently have no evidence for them, the first hypothesis, that the universe is very old, likely is the correct one.)|`|ul7Wq7QVaa	It means that you use the explanation that explains all the facts with the least complexity.

For example, if you see a tree in a meadow, both 'that tree grew there from a tree seed' and 'that tree was placed there by an alien flying saucer from Vega' are explanations consistent with your observation, but the former is more likely because it would require more additional assumptions to have the flying saucer scenario.

The pot with a lid on it has a higher pressure above the liquid which would cause the liquid to boil at a higher temperature.<br>  <br>  3) A<br>  - Without any additional information the compound with the lowest molecular mass will boil at the lowest temperature.  Larger molecules have higher boiling points because there is more interaction with neighboring molecules.<br>  <br>  4) vibration and some linear motion like sliding around<br>  - All phases (solid, liquid, gas) have vibration.

Gnfc4wRlaa	I don't know why you asked this again, but here it is.<br>  <br>  Roswell Incident July, 1947<br>  A rancher named Mac Brazel discovered strange metal strewn across a wide area of range land. Brazel took pieces of the debris to the authorities in Roswell, New Mexico. Colonel Blanchard, commanding officer at Roswell Army Air Field, ordered two intelligence officers, Major Jesse Marcel and Captain Sheridan Cavitt to investigate. Upon their report, Colonel Blanchard had area cordoned off. Soldiers removed the debris, sending it to Army headquarters in Fort Worth, Texas. <br>  At first the Army command at Roswell issued a press release announcing it had recovered a "flying disk." This press release was retracted, and further press coverage restricted. At a press conference in Fort Worth, the Army explained that the intelligence officer and others at Roswell had misidentified the debris, which was, according to them, the remains of a downed weather balloon.<br>  <br>  It was not until the late 1970s, with Jesse Marcel's decision to comment publicly on the strange material and other aspects of the Roswell event, that the UFO crash story was revived. Roswell citizens who were around when the incident occurred reported being threatened by the military and ordered not to tell about what they knew of it.

FgO8GPCYaa	The eggs hatch after some seven to 14 days, depending on the weather. Young larvae feed on thyme flowers for about two weeks during late July and early August. Then, they fall to the ground and are adopted by red ants and taken off to the underground ant nests where they feed on ant grubs. <br>  <br>  The larva spends 10 months as a predator in the ant nests, then pupates there.<br>  <br>  The butterflies emerge during the period early-June to mid-July, after some three weeks in the pupal stage.<br>  <br>  <br>  Now here is some extra info if ya need it hope all this helps!!<br>  <br>  <br>  The large blue produces only one generation a year. The adult individuals do not live long. The average lifespan is 5 to 7 days, but many butterflies die before that. Females lay their eggs on the flower buds of thyme, Thymus praecox. The caterpillars spend the first three weeks on the thyme flowers. They feed on it and rapidly develop until the last larval instar L4. Once having reached this instar they stop feeding and fall to the ground. From that point on, the caterpillars depend on the care of Myrmica (red) ants. The worker ants on their way to collect food for the colony will find the caterpillars and take them to their nest. Once in there, the caterpillars change their diet and feed on eggs and larvae of the ants. The caterpillars hibernate and pupate inside the ant colony, and the adult Large Blues appear from late June until mid July of the next year.<br>  <br>  <br>  Habitat: Grassy places with flowers, especially Thyme (Thymus) the larval food plant. Usually dry habitats which, presumably, suites species of the the ant genus Myrmica on which the larvae also feed. See the section on Behaviour below. Frequently amongst bushes or woodland edges.

63d39edd821952e38c5dbce9762a0d7baa	Excellent question.<br>  <br>  I think you mean 'isotopes' rather than isotypes.<br>  <br>  If we take carbon as an example. The most common form of carbon atom is sometimes called 'carbon 12'. This is because it has an atomic mass of 12. In the nucleus are 6 neutrons and 6 protons, each weighing 1 atomic mass unit. It also has 6 electrons whizzing around, though these weigh so little they don't add to the atomic mass.<br>  <br>  There is another type of carbon atom called 'carbon 14'. This has 6 protons, and 6 electrons (just like carbon 12), plus 8 neutrons. For whatever reason, this is unstable. (Another way of saying 'unstable' in this case is 'radioactive'*). To become stable, one of the neutrons turns into a proton. It does this by emitting an electron. (When talking about radioactivity, an electron is called a 'beta particle'). <br>  <br>  But this new atom is no longer Carbon - carbon only has 6 protons, and this new atom has 7, making it nitrogen.<br>  <br>  On average, it takes almost 6,000 years for a carbon 14 atom to turn into a nitrogen atom. This means you can measure the amount of carbon 14 in something very old, and you can work out how old it is.<br>  <br>  *When a radioactive substance gives out alpha particles or beta particles, nearby radio receivers will crackle - that is what 'radioactive' means.|`|X98qlf2iaa	You mean isotopes?<br>  <br>  Some are stable, some are not, it's as simple as that. It's more of a physics question really - the nucleus of the atom is made up of protons and neutrons. The protons (+ve charge) repel each other because of the electromagnetic force, and both the protons and neutrons are held together by something called the 'strong nuclear force'. Due to the balance between the two forces, some isotopes will be more stable than others. Those which are unstable decay into other things, so only the stable isotopes are found naturally.

Also, the shortage of man power in the US because of the war increased mechanization of agriculture. During the 20's, farming was still done largely with horses, but better machines were being developed for planting and harvesting and farmers were generally able to make a living. However, at the beginning of the great depression, sever droughts caused large crop failures and the closing of banks caused loans to be called due that couldnt be repaid and farmers began to struggle badly, in ways that arnt comparable to any current situations.|`|921fd3e5c127d3dd26ff9bd25b494b9aaa	Farms were mostly smaller family farms.

They did not need a lot of money as they traded their produce products.  I talked to an old Oklahoman who said they did not notice the depression very much unless they owed money on their land.  Now only 2% of the people grow our food.  So we absolutely need money for food.  Best to put in a nice big garden this summer.  Food stayed expensive last summer.  Now tomatoes are $!.18 a pound, peppers are $.98 EACH.  Stock up on canned goods, rice keeps pretty well, Even water storage or better yet a water distiller.  Also candles, maybe some guns and ammo.   If the government does not dole out enough money, there could certainly be riots and unrest.  Nobody will want to go hungry.  I do believe we are in a depression right now.  How could it be worse for many many people.  The French had a similar episode and they were cutting off the heads of their government people.

2bKgIMSsaa	As Sarah said, what you need to find out is what adaptations koalas could develop, not what a koala could evolve into.<br>  I can think of three adaptations that would help koalas survive the difficulties they are currently facing. <br>  Firstly, if they became immune to diseases, mainly chlamydia, that would help a lot. Chlamydia kills a lot of koalas.<br>  Secondly, if koalas developed a way to defend themselves when dogs attacked them, that would help. That suggestion is very general, and a lot of adaptations would have to occur for koalas to be able to have any success when defending themselves against dogs. Another possibility is for koalas to develop an understanding that it's not safe to go anywhere near any place where there are dogs, eg. towns and around houses, as a lot of koalas are killed by dogs.<br>  The third adaptation would be for koalas to develop road-sense; in other words, for them to develop an understanding that going near cars and roads is dangerous for them. <br>  Hope that helps.|`|1a25a30b0fd9f9c2f744041ef4826fa7aa	First based on your wording, the koala would not evolve INTO anything. That being said, developing adaptations for the digestion of eucalyptus (which is technically toxic, but koalas tend to fall asleep before poisoning themselves) that would increase the likelihood of reaching sexual maturity and producing viable offspring would make them more adapted.<br>  <br>  In fact, that last bit is pretty much the definition of adaptation.<br>  <br>  <br>  Why on earth do you need to come up with koala adaptations??

You will see that 2 moles of H2 react with every 1 mole of V2O5.  So, if you have 6 moles of V2O5, then you need 12 moles of H2 to fully react with it.  Because you only have 10 moles of H2, then you know that this will be your limiting reagent.<br>  <br>  Now that that is known, you know that only 5 moles of V2O5 can react with the 10 moles of H2.<br>  <br>  moles of V2O5 are equivalent to moles of V2O3, this is determined by looking at the balanced molecular equation and noting that 1 mole of V2O5 will react with 2 moles of H2 to form 1 mole of V2O3.  Similarly, moles of H2 are equivalent to H2O.<br>  <br>  So ultimately, your answer is as follows:<br>  5 moles of V2O3 can be formed<br>  10 moles of H2O can be formed<br>  <br>  Hope this helps

l0SN3nWCaa	Most fish are poikilothermic, their internal temperatures change and match the water surrounding them. These fish need to produce much less energy than warm-blooded animals and therefore only need to eat a fraction of the food. In that way they are adapted to the cold environment of a higher altitude.<br>  Because of the low levels of oxygen and nutrients available to the fish they grow much slower than low-altitude fish.<br>  Some high-altitude fish can even change their gill morphology to adapt to a hypoxic surrounding. The lamellae become elongated in order to increase the area of contact between capillaries and the surrounding water. The filament epithelium of the gills also becomes thinner to shorten the distance oxygen is needed to diffuse.<br>  The leather carp is a species with these adaptations. This particular fish has less scales than most and could possibly be because it needs less protection because of less predators in the frigid environments where it can survive.

Gnfc4wRlaa	I believe that it did, but there is still controversy on this.  <br>  <br>  Study: Dinosaurs Died Within Hours After Asteroid Hit Earth 65 Million Years Ago <br>  May 24, 2004<br>  According to new research led by a University of Colorado at Boulder geophysicist, a giant asteroid that hit the coast of Mexico 65 million years ago probably incinerated all the large dinosaurs that were alive at the time in only a few hours, and only those organisms already sheltered in burrows or in water were left alive. <br>  <br>  The six-mile-in-diameter asteroid is thought to have hit Chicxulub in the Yucatan, striking with the energy of 100 million megatons of TNT, said chief author and Researcher Doug Robertson of the department of geological sciences and the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences. The "heat pulse" caused by re-entering ejected matter would have reached around the globe, igniting fires and burning up all terrestrial organisms not sheltered in burrows or in water, he said. <br>  <br>  A paper on the subject was published by Robertson in the May-June issue of the Bulletin of the Geological Society of America. Co-authors include CU-Boulder Professor Owen Toon, University of Wyoming Professors Malcolm McKenna and Jason Lillegraven and California Academy of Sciences Researcher Sylvia Hope. <br>  <br>  "The kinetic energy of the ejected matter would have dissipated as heat in the upper atmosphere during re-entry, enough heat to make the normally blue sky turn red-hot for hours," said Robertson. Scientists have speculated for more than a decade that the entire surface of the Earth below would have been baked by the equivalent of a global oven set on broil. <br>  <br>  The evidence of terrestrial ruin is compelling, said Robertson, noting that tiny spheres of melted rock are found in the Cretaceous-Tertiary, or KT, boundary around the globe. The spheres in the clay are remnants of the rocky masses that were vaporized and ejected into sub-orbital trajectories by the impact. <br>  <br>  A nearly worldwide clay layer laced with soot and extra-terrestrial iridium also records the impact and global firestorm that followed the impact. <br>  <br>  Dinosaur Killer May Have Been Volcanism, Not Asteroid<br>  By Andrea Thompson, Senior Writer<br>  posted: 15 December 2008<br>  Scientists have found evidence that volcanism, not a space rock, may be the culprit behind the dinosaurs' demise.<br>  The first well-supported theory for what wiped out all large dinosaurs involved a space rock that created the Chicxulub crater in Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula. But climate change and volcanism have been suggested in recent decades, too. A set of new studies further shifts the blame away from the impact and toward volcanism, a position that geologist Gerta Keller of Princeton University has taken in recent years.<br>  <br>  Keller and others now say more about the life-extinguishing work of a massive series of sulfur dioxide-spewing volcanic eruptions that occurred in what is now India at the time of the dinosaur-destroying K-T mass extinction (the Cretaceous-Tertiary extinction).<br>  <br>  The asteroid-impact "theory is now facing perhaps it's most serious challenge from the Deccan volcanism and perhaps the Chicxulub impact itself," Keller said.<br>  <br>  The colossal volcanic eruptions, occurred between 63 million and 67 million years ago. The huge volcanic explosions created the Deccan Traps lava beds in India, whose original extent may have covered as much as 580,000 square miles (1.5 million square kilometers), or more than twice the area of Texas.<br>  <br>  Both the impact and the volcanic explosions would have spewed sulfur dioxide, dust and other emissions into the atmosphere, altering the Earth's climate. Sulfur dioxide can react in the atmosphere to form sulfate aerosols that can cool the surface of the planet and create acid rain.|`|ftwGaZ4Uaa	It is unlikely that the asteroid impact alone is responsible for the end of the dinosaurs, but it was sure the final nail to their coffin.|`|bae299c73e121a8a45067e0818073b1baa	In favor: There is overwhelming evidence for a catastrophic impact on the Earth 65 million years ago. The remnant crater has been located and identified -- 100 mile wide crater on the tip of the Yucatan peninsula. In addition, the geological record shows a layer of iridium (an element rare on Earth but common in asteroids/meteorites) at the 65 million year level.<br>  <br>  Against: Paleontologists have observed from the fossil record that dinosaurs were already dying out from changing climate and habitat loss for several millions of years before the asteroid impact.

It is thought that the extinction was possibly a combination of volcanic activity, climate change and an asteroid impact. <br>  In short, 'for' arguments could be: Chicxulub crater is of correct size and age, global layer of iridium in fossil record<br>  'against': no way of knowing for sure what the effects of such an impact would be, educated guesses are the best we can do.|`|77cb033374598e8c10938763c9fe03f7aa	It didn't wipe out other species so one must wonder if it was not the asteroid that wiped then out but their inability to adapt to severe condition changes.|`|dyvliTTbaa	there are so many different story's but i would say yes it was x|`|swWg9TGDaa	There was certainly a massive impact which clearly had a devastating impact on life on earth and dinosaurs, flying and marine reptiles in particular, you simply don't get evidence of these giant reptiles after it.

They do have additional training in osteopathic manipulation but most rarely, if at all really use it in clinical practice and DO training is otherwise similar to that in allopathic medicine.  There is a common perception that most D.O.'s originally were unable to get into an allopathic medical school and instead opted to go into osteopathic medicine which is less competitive.  Because of this DO's unfortunately have a far harder time getting into the more competitive specialities and generally most DO's enter primary care.

It is a graduate-level first professional degree for physicians and surgeons, requiring four years to complete. Holders of the D.O. degree are known as osteopathic medical physicians. D.O.s are trained much in the same way as M.D.s, with the addition of osteopathic manipulative medicine techniques.<br>  <br>  M.D.<br>  Doctor of Medicine (MD, from the Latin Medicin? Doctor meaning "Teacher of Medicine") is a doctorate degree for physicians (medical doctors). The degree is granted from medical schools.<br>  It is a first professional degree (qualifying degree) in some countries, including the United States and Canada, although training is entered after obtaining at least 90 hours of university level work (see second entry degree). In other countries, such as United Kingdom and Australia, the MD is a higher doctoral academic research degree resembling a PhD.[1] In Britain and many Commonwealth nations, the qualifying medical degree is instead the Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS or MBChB).|`|23hPHjOqaa	I'm not entirely sure as I live in the UK but I have heard rumours (at least) that it is harder to get a job as a DO than an MD, and that if you want to work anywhere else in the world such as here in the UK then you have to prove that you've studied adequate modules whereas an MD has no such questions asked and are free to practice (as long as they pass citizenship and visa requirements of course)

The earth's poles shift on a somewhat regular basis, as do the poles on many planets and moons, and even stars.  But because the earth has magnetic rocks, there is a very clear way to tell when the pole shifts occurred, several feet of rock may be polarly oriented one way and the next several feet will be in the polar opposite direction.  Because scientists have a fairly decent means of establishing the age of the rocks through sedimentary rates as well as carbon dating it means we can tell to a fairly accurate degree when the polar shifts have happened.  Incidentally we are in a period right now where many in the scientific community believe we will have another polar shift.  Because the earth moves at about 1 measurably degree every million years the polar shift is an indication that the earth is very old.|`|3BzLab9yaa	Carbon dating, Fossils, Geological Science, Ice cores.<br>  <br>  A good book to read lots of arguments about diferent aspects of religion is 'the god delusion' by richard dawkins|`|RVW9mTx9aa	Carbon dating?
Nk3eQbM7aa	There are lots of arguments:<br>   The distance of galaxies indicates that the universe is at least 12-13 byo (billion years old)<br>  Uranium-lead dating puts the age of the oldest rocks at ~4.5 byo<br>  There's lots of evidence for continental drift that doesn't need radioactive dating, and current drift rates show that it's been going on for 100s of millions of years.<br>  Without using radioactive dating, we can look at sedimentation rates, and then look at huge stratigraphic records, like at the Grand Canyon.<br>  Mitochodrial DNA has a pretty constant mutation rate. It shows divergence of species would take 100s of millions of years.<br>  I'm sure there are more.
iTS8qJfoaa	1.  Load monitors are the best means of monitoring dulling as a dull tool will draw a lot more current.<br>  Poor specimen finish.<br>  Increase in cutting noise level.<br>  Discolouration near cutting edge.<br>  <br>  3.  This is too specific, there must be other information in the question that you have not provided.
2GhrOlokaa	1) Individual current and total current in circuit is related in that the current that flow through each load load equals the total total current in circuit since charges flow through the same medium and do not get consumed or pile up some where in the circuit.<br>    with that of parallel connection different current flow through the circuit components but since the charges that flow in a circuit undergoes a cycle whereby by charges leaves the positive terminal and back to the negative terminal where there are energize the sum of the current in a parallel network connection equals the current of the supplier(total current)<br>   2)For series connection the sum of individual voltages is equal in input voltage ie the total voltage of the circuit. while for parallel network connection, components in parallel have the same voltage.<br>  3) imagine that you have and 3 friends are to run a raise for 500km on a particular tract and you guy have been restricted to use just that tract.suppose that they have put 20 dogs on the road on the road to provide some resistance you guys will have to encounter all of them as obstacle on you 500km raise and each dog will have it own resistance to over to you guys and if one asked for that total resistance that you guys had provide each dog over the same resistance to each of you .then total resistance will normally be equal the sum of resistance offered by the 20 dogs for this analogy to apply it to circuit the charges in a series connect have to encounter all the resistive mechanisms in that medium as such their total resistance is the sum of their individual resistances. the reverse works for parallel connection for if you guys had more that one medium  say three medium and the 20 dogs available for the different media then the total resistance will be equals the sum of the individual resistances divided by the product of the individual resistances .that works for circuit.|`|FuzqedPgaa	hey, lol, i asked da same Q ^_~ and someone answered it...if u need it...just search: circuit connections<br>  :)
