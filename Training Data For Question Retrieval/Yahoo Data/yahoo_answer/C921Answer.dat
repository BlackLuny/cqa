Also you could be prosecuted if it could be proven that when you had the goods/services you had no intention of repaying the money. I suggest pay what you owe, that way you will be sure that nothing more could happen to you. (Bad debt can affect your ability to gain credit).

AA10464818	Yes I have received grants, but not for my personal use but for the non profits I worked with<br>  <br>  The government is NOT in the business of giving away free money for the sake of giving away money. There are no grants for paying bills, for getting out of debt or for buying a car. Grants are free, but it means OBLIGATION. You will be obligated to do as the grant sets out to do. Grants have objectives, and your purpose must fit the objective of the grant.<br>  <br>  For one, you have to write the grant application and the grant application is not a simple document - you have to explain how your purpose for applying for the grant fits well with the objectives set out by the grant.<br>  <br>  There is a stringent review process through a committee. You will compete with other applicants for the grant money, and this grant review committee will evaluate the merits of each proposal. Only those that they feel exemplifies the objective of the grant will be approved.<br>  <br>  Nonetheless, you can go to the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA) <a href="http://www.cfda.gov" rel="nofollow">http://www.cfda.gov</a> and Grants.gov <a href="http://www.grants.gov" rel="nofollow">http://www.grants.gov</a> - these are two sites created by the federal government to provide transparency and information on grants.

Most of the federal grants are given to specific target groups with specific requirements (e.g. minority business owners involved in transportation related contracts emanating from DOT - Grant#20.905 Disadvantaged Business Enterprises Short Term Lending Program. Individuals especially for personal purposes are not eligible for federal grants. <br>  <br>  Grants are also often given to non profit groups or organizations involved in training or other similar activities (grant 59.043 Women's Business Ownership Assistance that are given to those who will create women's business center that will train women entrepreneurs|`|8bc1419f3268344a5964f48cc6672e36aa	FAFSA for college.

Und nicht die s?tze beenden mit N? oder ne!|`|3d651d0e7a49a35ecbfe107626d5231faa	An ein Bewerbungsgespr?ch solltest Du immer gut vorbereitet gehen. Es ist sehr wichtig, dass Du über die ausgeschriebene Stelle informiert bist und Du auch über die Firma, bei der Du Dich bewirbst Bescheid weisst.<br>  1.) Kleider machen Leute: Es ist eine Tatsache (ganz gleich, was Du über Kleiderregeln denkst), dass der erste Eindruck, den Du von einem Menschen gewinnst, auf seinem ?usseren Erscheinungsbild beruht. Die Kleidung ist dabei in jedem Fall von gr?sster Wichtigkeit. Dein Outfit sollte zum Profil der gebotenen Stelle passen. Aber Achtung: Glaube ja nicht, dass Du, wenn Du Dich zum Beispiel als Clown in einem Zirkus bewirbst, erfolgreich bist, wenn Du mit einer roten Nase und einer Punkfrisur ans Bewerbungsgespr?ch kommst! Die Kleidung sollte a) sauber, b) m?glichst unauff?llig und bieder und c) nicht overdressed, d.h. in etwa der Stellung, für die Du Dich bewirbst angemessen sein. Bei einer kaufm?nnischen oder Bankanstellung also für M?nner der klassische dunkle Anzug mit weissem oder schwarzem (auf jeden Fall uni) Hemd mit einer nicht zu extravaganten Kravatte - bei einer h?heren Position auch für die Frauen ein "m?nnliches" Outfit (also Anzug mit weisser Bluse und ev. sogar Kravatte) aber auf keinen Fall Jeans oder Minijupe mit Strapsen (mit diesem Outfit degradiert sich Frau zum Objekt und bekommt allenfalls einen Job in einer zwielichtigen Bar). Für einen typischen Handwerksjob ist das Business-Outfit natürlich nicht angebracht, da gehst Du am Besten in einer anst?ndigen Jeans und einer passenden Jacke hin. Auch hier: Für Frauen ist ebenfalls M?nnerkleidung empfohlen! Auf keinen Fall Schule mit Stiletto-Abs?tzen.<br>  Zusammengefasst: Gleich für welchen Job, die Kleidung sollte unauff?llig, sauber und gepflegt sein. Dasselbe gilt für die Frisur. Wenn Frau Hosen tr?gt, dann riskiert sie auch keine Pannen wegen Laufmaschen. Das Schuhwerk sollte zum Anzug passen und auch die Socken (Achtung keine Socken mit L?chern, k?nnte peinlich werden, wenn Du aus irgendeinem Grund die Schuhe ausziehen musst!) -zu einem dunklen Anzug geh?ren zwingend schwarze Socken. <br>  Parfum: Mann ein dezentes, herbes Rassierwasser, Frau etwas unaufdringliches (nicht zu sexy! - ein Sexy-Outfit hat an einem Bewerbungsgespr?ch absolut nichts verloren!).<br>  <br>  2.) Selbstsicheres Auftreten: Nicht zu verwechseln mit überheblichkeit! Kein Chef stellt gern Mitarbeiter an, die klüger als er selbst sind ... - also keine grossspurigen Erkl?rungen über das Fachgebiet des zukünftigen Bosses und auch nicht hochstapeln: Du würdest sehr schnell entlarvt! Aber auch kein Understatement. Zuh?ren ist das Zauberwort und dann kein Z?gern bei der Antwort. Wenn Du ein Superjob-Angebot erh?ltst, dann annehmen und keine Bedenkfrist verlangen! Sogar dann zusagen, wenn Du allenfalls noch ein anderes Gespr?ch vor Dir hast! Du kannst dann immer nochmals absagen, wenn Du aber den Anschein erweckst, Du seist am Job nicht sonderlich interessiert, dann wird mit Sicherheit Dein Mitbewerber ausgew?hlt.<br>  <br>  3.) Lohnansprüche: Du solltest eine einigermassen realistische Gehaltsvorstellung haben. Am besten ist es, irgendwie rauszubekommen, was Dein Vorg?nger bzw. ein Mitarbeiter in ?hnlicher Position bei der besagten Firma verdient. Diese Informationen solltest Du mit Deinem pers?nlichen Lebensbedarf in Relation bringen: Ein Job, von dem Du Dich nicht ern?hren kannst, ist auf jeden Fall absolut problematisch. Von Vorteil ist es natürlich, wenn Dir der zukünftige Arbeitgeber ein Angebot macht. Aber gerne überl?sst der Chef diesen Schritt natürlich Dir in der Hoffnung, dass er, wenn Du ein zu tiefes Gebot machst, billiger weg kommt ... Auf jeden Fall immer ein heikler Punkt. <br>  Wenn Du weisst, was ein Mitarbeiter in ?hnlicher Position bei derselben Firma oder der Konkurrenz verdinet, dann kannst Du ein Angebot machen, das bis maximal 5% über diesem Lohn liegt. (Da kannst Du Dich dann um diese 5% noch runterweibeln lassen - wenn Du mit Deinem Bewerbungsauftritt überzeugst, dann bekommst Du die 5% mehr sogar. Gehst Du aber h?her, dann wirst Du entweder zum Voraus als zu teuer abgewiesen oder aber das Runterweibeln ist praktisch sicher!)<br>  <br>  4.) Bewerbungsunterlagen: Es braucht einerseits eine Kurzfassung (Lebenslauf auf 2 Seiten und wichtigste Zeugnisse: Das sind h?chster Schulabschluss und wichtigste Arbeitserfahrung). Ungefragt wird nur diese Kurzfassung vorgelegt. Chefs haben keine Zeit von 100 Kandidaten 100 dicke Dossiers zu studieren! Das Wichtigste sollte also auf den maximal 2 Seiten Kurz-CV ersichtlich sein. <br>  Andererseits solltest Du auch ein komplettes Dossier haben mit allen Schulzeugnissen, s?mtlichen Arbeitsstellen usw.<br>  Dieses reichst Du nur ein, wenn Du darum gebeten wirst. Sonst sieht das eh kein Mensch an!<br>  <br>  5:) Wahrheitsgetreue Antworten auf Fragen: Fragen des Arbeitgebers bei der Bewerbung sind grunds?tzlich wahrheitsgetreu zu beantworten. Das Gesetz sieht aber ausdrücklich Ausnahmen vor. Auf Fragen, die der Arbeitgeber nicht stellen darf, braucht der Bewerber nicht wahrheitsgetreu zu antworten. So darf die Frage zu einer bestehenden Schwangerschaft nur dann gestellt werden, wenn die zu leistende Arbeit eine objektive Gef?hrundung des ungeborenen Kindes bedeuten würde, also etwa beim Einsatz mit gef?hrlichen Chemikalien oder in einem Atomkraftwerk: Der Gesetzgeber hat die Frage nach der Schwangerschaft gerade deshalb verboten, weil sonst eine schwangere Frau auf dem Stellenmarkt praktisch chancenlos w?re. Dasselbe gilt für andere intime Fragen, die nichts mit der Arbeit zu tun haben. Du brauchst also zum Beispiel auf die Frage ob du lesbisch oder schwul seist, wenn Du nicht willst, nicht wahrheitsgetreu zu antworten - solche Fragen sind grunds?tzlich unzul?ssig und eigentlich macht sich ein Arbeitgeber, der solches fragt strafbar.<br>  <br>  So, das w?r's in etwa, ja noch etwas: Wenn Du an Deinem Bewerbungsgespr?ch falsche Angaben machst (z.B. sagst Du h?ttest einen Hochschulabschluss, dabei hast Du nicht einmal eine Hauptschule gemacht), so lieferst Du a) einen Grund zur fristlosen Kündigung und wirst b) schadenersatzpflichtig! Und hochstapeleien kommen immer irgendwann ans Tageslicht. Also bewirb Dich nur für Jobs, für die Du auch tats?chlich geeignet bist, andererseits untersch?tze Dich auch nicht!|`|4243d71fea56c577d2df85bdab6e03f5aa	Vor allen Dingen, wenns nicht so gut wird, immer gut gelaunt bleiben. Nicht jeder Arbeitgeber tut einem gut, au?er, dass er vielleicht regelm??ig den Lohn überweist, vielleicht!<br>  Lass dich nicht verunsichern, soviel wissen andere garnicht über dich, wie sie vorgeben es zu tun.<br>  Immer ehrlich bleiben, wenn du ein Kriegsgegner bist, dann bist du das. Und wenn es dich st?rt, dass in deiner Gegenwart geraucht wird, dann st?rt es. Genauso immer bejahen, wenn du etwas magst. Schlie?lich soll man ja noch l?ngere Zeit miteinander gut auskommen. <br>  Ansonsten nicht zuviel aus dem Privaten plaudern, au?er bei gezielten Fragen, aber immer abw?gen. <br>  Ansonsten, an erster Stelle steht Freundlichkeit, auch wenn der Gespr?chspartner nicht so freundlich u. geduldig ist wie du.<br>  Nicht über andere Bewerber reden, nicht über andere Stellenangebote urteilen u. dergleichen. <br>  Wenn du sehr unsicher bist, u. Angst hast vor diesen ganz pers?nlichen Fragen, oder vor dem direkten Blickkontakt usw... w?re eine psychologische Beratung gut. Oder mit einem Freund oder einer Freundin das Gespr?ch üben. Da geht schon eine Menge Angst verloren.<br>  Viel Glück.|`|4398d4ce02876d583e4bf2b207487087aa	Bei einer Bewerbung ist es sehr wichtig das mann Sich ganz sicher ist das mann überhaupt diesen Job will und nicht das mann es nur macht weil mann nichts anderes kriegt!|`|10bcfe81370e35deca0c8e289ac2ac11aa	Einfach natürlich bleiben und sich auf das Berufsbild vorbereiten. Dann kann eigentlich nichts mehr schief gehen. <br>  Am besten ist die m?glichen Fragen die gestellt werden k?nnten vorher mit Freund zu üben.|`|1339c1e03d9a2e0cd00af471bcb2752baa	Gut angezogen sein und immer h?flich!|`|4a9d396e11fa75c81d41e81dd802d236aa	Kleidung:<br>  Für die Leute, die es gew?hnt sind leger herum zu laufen: Falls Ihr nicht unbedingt eine Stelle als Führungskraft oder Banker anstrebt, ist es kein Problem auch in etwas legererer Kleidung zum Vorstellungsgespr?ch zu kommen. Aber bitte folgende Regeln einhalten: Da die meisten Chefs einen direkten Vergleich zwischen Aussehen und Arbeitsmoral ziehen, sollte das ?ussere nicht ungepflegt wirken. Also unbedingt Haare frisch waschen. Piercings und andere auff?llige Dinge bis auf ein Minimum reduzieren. Für M?dels: bitte keine Minir?cke oder extreme St?ckelschuhe oder Plateausohlen! Am besten eine Stoffhose in dezenter Farbe oder zur Not auch eine gut sitzende und nicht zu enge Jeans. Bei den Schuhen am besten ewas schwarzes oder braunes, nach M?glichkeit keine Turnschuhe. Oberteile sind natürlich auch zu differenzieren. Am besten sind Hemd oder Bluse (bitte vorher ordentlich bügeln!), wer sowas nicht besitzt, kann auch einen Pullover anziehen, am besten Strickpullover o.?.. Was gar nicht geht sind bei Frauen tief ausgeschnittene Stücke oder Tops ohne was drüber und bei M?nnern T-Shirt (wom?glich noch mit Aufdruck!) oder Sweatshirts. Das sieht viel zu schluderig aus. Und Ihr wollt doch nicht, dass Euer neuer Chef meint, Ihr macht die Arbeit genauso schlampig. Make-up bitte nur dezent, keine bauchfreien Shirts.<br>  <br>  Verhalten:<br>  Keine Angst, der neue Chef will Euch weder fertig machen noch frisst er Euch auf. Er m?chte sich lediglich mit Euch unterhalten. Dazu hat er natürlich im Vorstellungsgespr?ch nicht so arg viel Zeit, daher versucht er mit gezielten Fragen herauszufinden, wie Eure Lebenseinstellung so aussieht. <br>  Eins ist dabei wichtig: niemand kann schon alles k?nnen oder wissen! Das verlangt auch niemand. Was allerdings verlangt wird ist, dass Ihr interessiert seid und Euch bemühen werdet, Neues zu lernen und auch umzusetzen. Das k?nnt Ihr bei Fragen, die in diese Richtung gestellt werden auch ruhig so wiedergeben. Denn nichts zu sagen ist genauso schlecht, wie über alle Ma?en zu übertreiben, wie gut man doch ist. <br>  Meistens erz?hlt der Chef (Personalfritze) erst einmal was über die Firma. Solltet Ihr über Internet verfügen, seht Euch vorher mal die Homepage der Firma an, denn dann wisst Ihr schon ein paar Sachen, falls eine Frage über die Firma kommt. Auch hier dürft Ihr sagen, dass Ihr im Internet schon mal nachgesehen habt, Freunde oder Bekannte gefragt habt etc. Das kommt immer gut an, da der andere erkennen kann, dass Ihr Interesse an der Firma habt. <br>  <br>  Pünktlichkeit:<br>  Es ist immer ratsam, mindestens 10-15 Minuten vorher da zu sein. Bloss nicht zu sp?t kommen. Eventuell vorher schon mal die Strecke abfahren, damit Ihr Euch auskennt.<br>  <br>  Ausstrahlung:<br>  Es ist einfacher gesagt als getan, aber alle Menschen senden durch ihre Haltung aus, wie sie sich fühlen. Daher solltet Ihr Euch vorher schon Gedanken darüber machen, dass Ihr halbwegs gerade auf dem Stuhl sitzt und nicht rumlümmelt. Das klingt noch relativ einfach. Schwieriger wird es mit dem Rest: Wenn irgendwie m?glich, seht Ihr dem Gespr?chspartner wenn er redet - und auch wenn Ihr redet - in die Augen. Es kommt unangenehm rüber, wenn Ihr st?ndig nur auf den Fu?boden oder auch aus dem Fenster schaut.<br>  <br>  Sonstiges:<br>  Bitte niemals negative Erfahrungen mit einer Firma, Schule oder Person erz?hlen. Das hat folgenden Hintergrund: Wenn Ihr wie verrückt über die alte Firma herzieht, dann hat der neue Chef Angst, dass Ihr chronische N?rgler seid und in seiner Firma nur alles und jeden schlecht macht. Und m?glicherweise dann auch über ihn herzieht. <br>  Also wenn Ihr schon in einer Firma ward und entlassen wurdet oder selbst gekündigt habt, erz?hlt einfach bei der Frage warum, dass Ihr ein neues Aufgabenfeld sucht, das Euch interessiert, weil Ihr immer gerne neue Dinge dazu lernt. Das ist unverf?nglich und kommt immer besser an, als wenn man behauptet, der Kollege sei doof gewesen oder der Chef h?tte einen nicht gemocht.<br>  Auch bei der Frage nach dem bisherigen T?tigkeitsfeld keine Negativargumente, wie "es sei ?de gewesen" oder so. Lieber mit Begeisterung die sch?nen Dinge aufz?hlen, auch wenn es nur wenige sind, die wir gelernt haben: z.B. Teamarbeit, neue Maschinen oder Techniken, selbstverantwortliches Arbeiten etc.<br>  <br>  Warum gerade dieser Job?<br>  Na darüber sollte man sich sich schon vorher Gedanken machen, die Frage kommt bestimmt. überlegt, was Ihr für Interessen oder Hobbies habt, was Ihr besonders gut k?nnt oder Euch Spass macht. Davon kann man bestimmt auch einige Dinge im neuen Job gebrauchen.<br>  <br>  Stellt ruhig auch Fragen:<br>  Das zeigt, dass Ihr interessiert seid an diesem Job. Hier kann man nach der Arbeitszeit fragen oder auch wieviele direkte Kollegen man hat, welche T?tigkeit man genau ausübt, Probezeit, ob der Job befristet ist oder unbefristet, feste Arbeitszeit oder Gleitzeit...<br>  <br>  Fiese Fragen:<br>  Manchmal hat man das Gefühl, das Gegenüber stellt einem richtig fiese Fragen, um einen in die Enge zu treiben. Eine solche Frage kann lauten: Warum glauben Sie, dass wir gerade Sie nehmen werden? Tja, und nun? Keine Angst, der Chef will nur wissen, wie sehr Ihr gerade diesen Job haben m?chtet und wie selbstbewusst Ihr seid. Also ruhig antworten. Am besten damit, dass Ihr sicher seid, dass Euch genau dieser Job Spa? machen wird und Ihr genau diesen Job haben m?chtet, weil Ihr genau solch ein Aufgabenfeld sucht. Durch z.B. Euer Interesse, Euren Teamgeist, frühere Arbeiten/Praktika und dem festen Willen, die neuen Sachen schnell lernen zu k?nnen und auch umzusetzen zu k?nnen, kann der Chef sicher sein, mit Euch die richtige Person auszuw?hlen. (Hier muss man irgendwie ein Zwischending rausfinden zwischen selbstsicher und aufrichtig, bitte nicht zu überheblich und auch nicht zu demütig).<br>  <br>  Bei der Verabschiedung kann auch nachgefragt werden, wann sich die Firma entscheidet und wann man ungef?hr Bescheid bekommt. Natürlich wird nicht gefragt, ob man nun genommen wird oder nicht.<br>  <br>  Sich noch bei den Anwesenden bedanken und mit H?ndedruck verabschieden.|`|15629bb1b80af81b4c365b7c8b0939d9aa	Ruig, bleiben, geflegtes Erscheinungsbild, aufmerksam sein, Inttresse zeigen, nicht aufdringlich sein, auf gar keinen fall gelangweilt sein!

Um das Stressniveau zu minimieren:<br>  a) tief atmen kurz vor dem Eintritt (wirklich hilft, Dein Gechirn funktioniert besser trotz Stress)<br>  b) in der Toilette die Handgelenke mit kaltem Wasser spülen - damit schweissen die H?nde nicht so stark<br>  c) NICHT VERGESSEN - dein Ansprechpartner hat viellen Bewerber zu befragen - er/sie wird deine Aut?ntizit?t schnell bewerten.

Nicht entmutigen lassen, wenn man w?hrend des Interviews angegriffen wird. Hier wird die Standfestigkeit getestet. Deshalb h?flich aber bestimmt entgegen treten. Realistische Gehaltsvorstellungen begründen und vertreten. Und: Immer locker und freundlich bleiben. Wenn man′s bis in die zweite Runde schafft, hat man schon viel gewonnen.

Hier ist Zurückhaltung absolut fehl am Platz. Nichts ist schlimmer, als wenn Dir aufgrund der Aufregung und des vielleicht etwas l?ngeren Bewerbunggespr?chs pl?tzlich die Zunge am Gaumen klebt. Alkoholische Getr?nke sind hier natürlich tabu!<br>  <br>  Wir gehen mit unseren Bewerbern auch mal gerne zum Mittagessen um zu sehen, wie sie sich so bei Tisch verhalten. Hier stehen die Bewerber st?rker unter Beobachtung als beim Bewerbungsgespr?ch, denn darauf sind sie normalerweise ja vorbereitet. <br>  <br>  "Verkaufe" St?rken als Schw?chen. "Ich bin oft zu ehrgeizig wenn es darum geht, etwas fertig zu bringen". Jeder Personalchef durchschaut dies natürlich,  aber bei der Frage geht es in der Regel nur darum zu sehen, ob Du Dich im Vorfeld mit dem Thema Bewerbung und m?glicher Fragen auseinandergesetzt hast. Absolutes don′t: "Ich glaube ich habe gar keine Schw?chen"  <br>  <br>  Komm ausgeschlafen, angemessen gekleidet und pünktlich zu dem Termin (pünktlich = mind. 7 Minuten vor dem Termin bist du dort). Lass die Zigarette vor dem Gespr?ch und am besten mind. 2 Stunden vorher weg. Ein Nichtraucher riecht die Nikotinfahne, die du in den Raum mittr?gst. Mundspray etc. vor dem Termin schaden nicht (KEIN KAUGUMMI ! )<br>  <br>  Vermeide es über vorherige Chefs oder Kollegen herzuziehen. Sag (wenn man Dich danach fragt) einfach, dass es Probleme gab, es aber nicht Deiner Art entspricht, diese nach aussen zu tragen.<br>  <br>  Lücken im Lebenslauf solltest Du erkl?ren k?nnen. Auch die "4 Stellen in 2 Jahren" :-). Personalchefs wollen keine OPFER einstellen. Mit der "die waren alle so b?se zu mir und haben mich gemobbt"-Nummer f?hrt man meist ganz schlecht. Such Dir lieber etwas heraus, was Dir die Firma bieten kann und die anderen nicht. "Ich interessiere mich speziell für den Bereich ..., leider konnte ich mich bei den anderen Firmen in diesem Bereich nicht einbringen/gab es diesen Bereich nicht.<br>  <br>  Frag unbedingt nach dem Gehalt und den Sozialleistungen bzw. betriebsinternen Leistungen, falls nicht von Seiten der Firma bereits darauf eingegangen wurde. Es ist klar, dass Du den Job nicht machst um von der Stra?e weg zu sein. Frag auch wie die Fortbildungsangebote sind und welche M?glichkeiten der übernahme (bei Azubis) es gibt, bzw. welche Aufstiegsm?glichkeiten vorhanden sind. Wer fr?gt, führt! <br>  <br>  Sei stets h?flich und frendlich aber vermeide es schleimig zu wirken. Verstell Dich nicht, aber achte auf Deine K?rpersprache. Schau Deinen Gespr?chspartner an und nicht die Tischplatte. Setzt dich ordentlich in den Stuhl. Mach dir ggf. Notizen, dann hast Du eine Besch?ftigung. <br>  <br>  Du must nicht auf alle Fragen antworten.

Der Berufswunsch sollte im Allgemeinen auf der Basis der eigenen<br>  Interessen beruhen. Um sich nun für eine bestimmte Berufsrichtung zu entscheiden, sollten<br>  mehrere Faktoren wie schulische Interessen, Hobbys und Talente berücksichtigt werden.<br>  Auch ist es m?glich, sich durch gewisse Institutionen oder Veranstaltungen zu informieren.<br>  Dazu z?hlen:<br>  ? Arbeitsamt bzw. Berufsinformationszentrum<br>  ? Tage der offenen Tür bei Unternehmen, Universit?ten, Fachhochschulen, etc...<br>  ? Beratungslehrer in der Schule<br>  Ausbildungsstellensuche<br>  Du wei?t nun also, was du für einen Beruf einmal ausüben willst. Es folgt also die Suche<br>  nach einer Ausbildungsstelle. Man hat jetzt mehrere M?glichkeiten: Man kann die Zeitung<br>  nach Stellenangeboten durchsuchen, man kann sich konkret an Firmen wenden oder ihre<br>  Internetseiten besuchen, man kann Freunde und Bekannte befragen. Auch das Arbeitsamt<br>  bzw. das Berufsinformationszentrum (B.I.Z.) haben ein gro?es Angebot an<br>  Informationsveranstaltungen, bei denen sich Firmen vorstellen.<br>  Hier sind ein paar interessante Links:<br>  ? www.arbeitsamt.de<br>  ? www.stepstone.de<br>  ? www.jobs.zeit.de<br>  ? www.stellenboerse.de<br>  ? www.jobrobot.de<br>  ? www.stellenangebote.de<br>  Kontaktaufnahme und Bewerbung<br>  Du kennst nun deine Interessen und hast auch schon ein paar Firmen herausgesucht, bei<br>  denen du dich bewerben willst. Jetzt mu? der erste Kontakt hergestellt werden. Heutzutage<br>  geht dies schon sehr leicht via Internet, aber auch der konventionelle Postweg ist nach wie<br>  vor eine M?glichkeit.<br>  Vielleicht m?chtest du dich zuerst einmal telefonisch bei den potentiellen Chefs melden.<br>  Dabei solltest du dich auf jeden Fall gut vorbereiten. Hier die wichtigsten Dingen, die du<br>  ansprechen solltest:<br>  ???? Grund deines Anrufs / Wie bin ich zu dieser Firma gelangt?<br>  ???? Hinweis von .... (z.B. Freund, bereits besch?ftige Mitarbeiter, Azubis, etc.)<br>  ???? Anzeige in der Zeitung .... vom ....<br>  ???? Durch die Berichterstattung in der ... Zeitung vom ... bin ich neugierig geworden.<br>  Informationen zu deiner Person<br>  ???? Alter<br>  ???? Schulbildung<br>  ???? voraussichtlicher Schulabschluss<br>  ???? Beginn der Ausbildung / Lehre<br>  ???? dein Ausbildungs- bzw. Berufswunsch<br>  ???? Begründung und Interessen<br>  positive, für gewünschte T?tigkeit nützliche Interessen<br>  Wichtig ist, dass du schon jetzt einen guten Eindruck hinterl?sst. Also sprich laut und<br>  deutlich, sprich die Gespr?chspartner auch einmal mit dem Namen an und sorge dafür, dass<br>  du nicht durch Nebens?chlichkeiten abgelenkt wirst (laute Musik im Hintergrund; Eltern, die<br>  dich zum Essen rufen; kleine Geschwister, die dir pl?tzlich den H?rer wegnehmen).<br>  Egal ob du dich bei der Firma telefonisch schon einmal gemeldet hast oder nicht, du wirst auf<br>  jeden Fall eine schriftliche Bewerbung abgeben müssen. Eine solche Bewerbung besteht im<br>  allgemeinen aus einem Anschreiben, einem Lebenslauf mit Foto, Zeugniskopien<br>  sowieBescheinigungen von Praktika oder absolvierten Kursen.<br>  Das Anschreiben<br>  Das Anschreiben ist praktisch das Kernstück der Bewerbung. Es sollte nicht mehr als zwei<br>  Seiten umfassen. Dieses Schreiben ist zumeist das erste (und oftmals auch das letzte), was<br>  die Personalchefs lesen. Es sollte gut gestaltet und ansprechend formuliert sein, um ein<br>  gr??tm?gliches Interesse am Bewerber zu wecken. Inhaltlich müssen folgende Punkte<br>  berücksichtigt werden:<br>  ???? die Angaben des Absenders (Vor-/Zuname; vollst?ndige Adresse; Telefonnummer)<br>  ???? die Anschrift des Empf?ngers (Infos mit GELBEN SEITEN/Internet abgleichen)<br>  ???? der Betreff (es wird klargestellt, worum es geht)<br>  ???? die Anrede (wenn m?glich zust?ndige Sachbearbeiter mit Namen nennen)<br>  ???? die Einleitung (Hinweis auf ein Telefonat oder eine Stellenanzeige)<br>  ???? das Anliegen (hier sollte alles das genannt werden, was dem Leser die Entscheidung<br>  ür genau diese Firma zu<br>  arbeiten oder eigenen Interessen bzw. St?rken)<br>  ???? der Wunsch nach einem Vorstellungsgespr?ch<br>  ???? die Schlussformel<br>  ???? die Unterschrift (mit vollem Namen)<br>  ???? der Anlagenvermerk<br>  Der Lebenslauf<br>  Auch der Lebenslauf ist ein wichtiger Bestandteil der schriftlichen Bewerbung. Er wird<br>  zumeist in tabellarischer Form verlangt, u.U. aber auch als ausformulierter Text. Der<br>  Lebenslauf gibt Auskunft über deine Person, den schulischen (und evtl. auch beruflichen)<br>  Werdegang. Wird nicht ausdrücklich ein handgeschriebenes Exemplar verlangt, genügt eine<br>  gedruckte oder auf der Schreibmaschine getippte Version. Es sollten diese Themen behandelt<br>  werden:<br>  ???? deine pers?nlichen Daten (Vor- und Zuname, Anschrift, Geburtsort- und Datum,<br>  Staatsangeh?rigkeit, evtl. Name und Beruf der Eltern sowie Zahl und Alter der<br>  Geschwister, Bewerbungsfoto)<br>  ???? Schulausbildung (welche Schulen wann und wo besucht wurden sowie die Art des<br>  erreichten Abschlusses)<br>  ???? Wehr- und Ersatzdienstzeiten<br>  ???? besondere Kenntnisse und F?higkeiten (Praktika, Aushilfst?tigkeiten,<br>  Fremdsprachen- und EDV-Kenntnisse, Engagement in gemeinnützigen<br>  Organisationen oder Vereinen, Führerschein/e, etc.)<br>  ???? besondere Neigungen und Hobbys (nur wenn ein Bezug zum Beruf besteht)<br>  Datum und Unterschrift<br>  Bewerbungstests<br>  Du hast die Vorauswahl anhand der schriftlich eingereichten Unterlagen bestanden. Entweder<br>  du wirst direkt zu einem Bewerbungsgespr?ch oder aber zu einem Auswahlverfahren<br>  eingeladen. Solche Tests scheinen nicht immer ganz sinnvoll zu sein, aber da es sie nun<br>  einmal gibt, müssen sie auch absolviert werden. Wichtig ist, dass man sich bei<br>  Einstellungstests nicht selbst nerv?s macht. Das ist leichter gesagt als getan. Hier sind ein<br>  paar nützliche Hinweise:<br>  ? Setze dich nicht selbst unter Zeitdruck! Viele Tests sind so konzipiert, dass man sie in<br>  der vorgegebenen Zeit gar nicht schaffen kann.<br>  ? Auch andere Teilnehmer sind aufgeregt. Niemand ist wirklich so cool, wie er oder sie<br>  aussieht!<br>  ? Man sollte versuchen, sich vor und w?hrend der Tests zu entspannen und nicht zu<br>  verkrampfen.<br>  ? Schraube deine Ansprü<br>  Beste sein. Bewerbungstests sind nicht allein das ausschlaggebende Kriterium für die<br>  Stellenvergabe.<br>  ? Die meisten Tests weisen Parallelen auf. H?ufig sind sie nach einem sich immer<br>  wieder wiederholenden Schema konzipiert. Wichtige Themen sind Mathematik,<br>  Deutsch und Fragen der Allgemeinbildung (z.B. Wer w?hlt den Bundespr?sidenten?).<br>  Je nach dem für welchen Ausbildungsplatz oder welche Stelle man sich bewirbt, kann<br>  fachspezifisches Wissen getestet werden.<br>  Vorstellungsgespr?ch<br>  Gratulation! Du hast es schon ziemlich weit geschafft, wenn du zu einem<br>  Vorstellungsgespr?ch eingeladen worden bist. Um so wichtiger ist es den ersten pers?nlichen<br>  Kontakt gut vorbereitet anzugehen. Je besser du dich vorbereitest, desto ruhiger wirst du sein.<br>  Dazu geh?rt auf jeden Fall, dass du ordentlich gekleidet erscheinst. Natürlich kommt es auf<br>  die Firma an bei der du dich bewirbst ob, es eine Kombination mit Sakko sein muss oder ob<br>  die Stoffhose mit Hemd und Schlips ausreicht. Auf jeden Fall sind Jeans, wenn m?glich<br>  sogar zerrissen, mit Sportschuhen unangebracht. Die Damen sollten bedenken, dass<br>  Sexappeal nicht unbedingt positiv aufgenommen wird. R?cke sollten dann doch etwas l?nger<br>  sein und das Bauchnabelpiercing sollte nicht im Blusenausschnitt zu sehen sein. Es ist auch<br>  sicherlich empfehlenswert Piercings im Gesicht mal nicht zu tragen, da manch ein<br>  Personalchef doch noch etwas konservativer eingestellt ist. Weiterhin geh?rt zur<br>  Vorbereitung, dass man ausgeschlafen ist und auch etwas gegessen hat. Man sollte auf jeden<br>  Fall pünktlich sein und sich genau informieren, wo man hinbestellt wurde. Es ist stets<br>  praktisch sich schon im Vorfeld über den potentiellen Arbeitgeber zu informieren (Zeitung,<br>  Internet, etc.)<br>  Wird man nun in ein Zimmer gerufen, so muss man beachten, dass man Türen nicht mit dem<br>  Rücken zu den anwesenden Personen schlie?t. Normalerweise ist es der Personalbeauftragte,<br>  der auf einen zwecks Begrü?ung, H?ndeschütteln und ?hnlichem zugeht. Platz genommen<br>  wird erst, wenn der Gespr?<br>  Sicherlich wird die Gespr?chssituation etwas unangenehm sein, da man einem oder sogar<br>  mehreren fremden Leuten allein gegenübersitzt. An dieser Stelle ist es wichtig so ruhig wie<br>  m?glich zu sein. Spiele nicht mit den Kn?pfen an deinem Hemd oder dem Stift, der vielleicht<br>  auf dem Tisch vor dir liegt. Betrachte nicht st?ndig das Bild an der Wand oder die V?gel, die<br>  vor dem Fenster vorbeifliegen.<br>  Nun wird man mit einer Reihe von Fragen konfrontiert. Man sollte sich deshalb schon<br>  Gedanken zu folgenden Themen gemacht haben:<br>  ? Wieso habe ich mich bei dieser Firma beworben?<br>  ? Wieso habe ich mich für diesen Beruf entschieden?<br>  ?<br>  ? Welche beruflichen Ziele habe ich?<br>  ? Welche privaten Ziele habe ich?<br>  ? Wie werde ich diese vereinbaren?<br>  ? Welche F?<br>  ? Welche Hobbys habe ich?<br>  ? Was sind meine St?rken?<br>  ? Was sind meine Schw?chen?<br>  ? Informationen zu meiner Familie<br>  ? Wie stehe ich zur Bundeswehr bzw. Wehrpflicht?<br>  ? St?rt es mich zeitig aufzustehen?<br>  ? Darf ich bestimmte T?tigkeiten aus gesundheitlichen Gründen nicht ausführen?<br>  ? Ging/Gehe ich gern zur Schule? Wieso?<br>  ? Bin ich mit meinen Zensuren zufrieden? Wenn nein, wieso nicht?<br>  ? bei Abiturienten: Warum will ich nicht studieren?<br>  ? Habe ich schon einmal Ferienarbeit gehabt? Hat sie Spa? gemacht?<br>  ? Wo habe ich mich sonst noch beworben?<br>  ? Was wei? ich über dieses Unternehmen, seine Produkte?<br>  Folgende Eigenschaften halten Betriebe heutzutage für wichtig:<br>  ? Teamf?higkeit<br>  ? Belastbarkeit<br>  ? Selbstst?ndigkeit<br>  ? Zielstrebigkeit<br>  ? Flexibilit?t<br>  ? Kommunikationsf?higkeit<br>  ? Verantwortungsbewusstsein<br>  ? Lernbereitschaft<br>  ?

Lass dem Gegenüber das Gefühl etwas besseres als du zu sein. Und denk daran: dein Gegenüber hat genausoviel Angst wie du: seine Angst ist es, den falschen Bewerber auszusuchen. das kostet nicht nur das Geld der Firtma sondern auch seinen guten Ruf!<br>  <br>  <br>  Garderobe - frage dich, was dein Gegenüber erwartet. Anzug + Krawatte sind im Handwerk weniger angebracht als im Büro.<br>  Sauber und nicht overdressed, nicht zu stylisch eben.<br>  <br>  Vorbereiten musst du dich inhaltlich auf folgendes;<br>  sammele Informationen über die Firma - und überlege dir, warum es gerade diese Firma sein soll.<br>  <br>  Klassiker 1 - warum hast du dich beworben?<br>  Klassiker 2 - warum sollte man dich nehmen?<br>  Klassiker 3 - was sind deine St?rken und Schw?chen?<br>  <br>  Sehr unangenehm - dein Gegenüber stellt dir die T?tigkeit auf die du dich bewirbst nicht vor, sondern erwartet von dir, dass du ihm beschreibst, wie du dir die T?tigkeit vorstellst!<br>  <br>  Sehr unangenehm - dein Gegenüber erz?hlt dir von den Arbeitsabl?ufen in der Firma - und es widerspricht allem, was du bisher gelernt und/oder erfahren hast.<br>  <br>  überlege dir, was du antwortest, was deine Hobbies sind, was du in deiner Freizeit machst. Hier will man h?ren, dass du "aktiv" bist und dich nicht h?ngen l?sst. Sei nicht zu aktiv, dann kommt die Angst wieder: Angst vor deiner vollen Arbeitskraft. Oder auch Angst davor, dass du dich bei deinem Sport verletzen k?nntest.<br>  <br>  Bereite dich darauf vor, deinen beruflichen Werdegang vorzutragen, obwohl dein Lebenslauf bekannt sein sollte. Dein Gegenüber hat das Recht, so etwas nicht zu lesen.<br>  Siehe zu, plausible Erkl?rungen für scheinbare Widersprüche parat zu haben. Verkaufe Brüche und Widersprüche als etwas Positives, indem du aufzeigst, was du daraus gelernt hast.<br>  <br>  Rechne mit der Frage, was dein gr??ter Erfolg und deine gr??te Niederlage war.<br>  <br>  In der Fragestunde will man auch dein Sozialverhalten prüfen. Finde heraus, ob Teamf?higkeit oder Teamorientierung gefragt ist. Vermeide alles, was den Eindruck erwecken kann, dass es Probleme mit dir geben wird.<br>  <br>  Wichtig ist neben einer akzeptablen Allgemeinbildung, dass du dich beim Tagesgeschehen auch mit den wichtigsten Punkten des politischen Tagesgeschehens auskennst. Regional, national, international.<br>  <br>  Rede nicht ungefragt über Schw?chen und Krankheiten.<br>  Lass dir zur Beantwortung der Fragen Zeit. Fasse dich kurz. Vermeide Gegenworte. ?ffne keine Tür, die es erlaubt, dass man dir Fragen stellt, auf die du nicht antworten willst. Lass dich auf keine Diskussionen ein.<br>  <br>  Und schrecke nicht davor zurück, dass zu sagen, was die andere Seite h?ren will. Die andere Seite wird dir auch nicht erz?hlen, was sie nicht erz?hlen will.<br>  <br>  Sei weder zu bescheiden noch zu selbstbewu?t. <br>  <br>  Benühe dich, so positiv wie m?glich rüberzukommen.<br>  <br>  So und jetzt die anderen - und viel Erfolg.<br>  <br>  ******<br>  <br>  Und nun noch einige nicht unbedeutende Nachtr?ge:<br>  betone nur die St?rken, die für den Job nützlich sind. Mir ist schon passiert, dass ich die falschen St?rken betont habe - und gefragt wurde, "Und warum bewerben Sie sich dann hier?"<br>  <br>  Wenn das Gespr?ch nicht in einem Besprechungsraum sondern in einem Büro stattfindet - schau dich genau um.  Manchmal findest du Anhaltspunkte, um eine pers?nliche Ebene herzustellen - Sportfotos, Urlaubsfotos, Tierfotos... Nutze geschickt diesen Aufh?nger, sprich diese Themen an, wenn du dazu etwas zu sagen hast!<br>  <br>  Ansonsten - übe Zurückhaltung. Du kennst dein Gegenüber nicht. Wenn du von tollen Urlaubsreisen erz?hlst - vielleicht ist dein Gegenüber seit 10 Jahren nicht mehr im Urlaub gewesen. Dann war es das wohl.<br>  <br>  Und zum endgültigen Abschlu?:<br>  La? nie Zweifel an deiner Motivation aufkommen.

With that, there isn't much practical stuff I can do. But you need to stay strong. There is light at the end of the tunnel; and it IS NOT the light of the oncoming train. I suggest you go to a place where you can think, and just write down on a piece of paper all your talents. What can you do. What are you good at? Then use that stuff and do job searches on the internet. Organize stuff. Plan things for yourself, and get yourself back on track. No one is going to do it for you, and until you realize that, you can't get far. So motivate yourself. Search for something that can help you move on. What do you want most to achieve? Once you get that, aim for it, take steps towards it, and other stuff will start to fall into place, which you can also then pursue. Make goals. You'll get far.

The minute you give them your credit card and personal information you have now opened your computer to unwanted cookies on your hard drive, annoying pop-up windows and if you are on a PC you open your computer to viruses that can wipe you out.<br>  <br>  A lot of work to collect the "reward payments" that payout is not worth the effort over time. You will need to sign up for many types of offers, most of which require you to use a credit card. You start a week trial service with varies types of businesses or services, such as, an Internet service provider, book club, credit monitoring service, etc. to get your reward. If you don't cancel the trial, you end up being charged for the service and each service has different rules about how and when you can cancel. Very cumbersome!<br>  <br>  Since you will need to sign up for at least a dozen offers before you get to $100 in rewards, it's very easy to forget what you have signed up for, or the problems you will have canceling in time to to be charged the full amount. The Cash Create recruiters you see here over exaggerate how much money you can earn because once you've done the high-dollar trials ($8-10 each), you are left with small rewards of a dollar or two.

And the people there are very friendly.<br>  <br>  I have found four legitimate work at home sites so far, and one of them made me $494+ in October, $700+ in November, and $838.57 in December.  They are free to join.<br>   <br>  <br>  Please click my screen name or avatar for more information and a link for proof of payment and lots of specific details.<br>  <br>  <br>  I made some nice money at first, but once I found out these sites were legitimate, I started adding referrals and the money got a lot better. For every person you refer, you get 20% of what they earn. And for every person that one of your referrals refer you get 10% on one site and 5% on the other. In time--this could be a great source of income--making money while other people are in a sense, working for you. <br>  <br>  If you get 5 referrals who earn $20 a month, that is an extra $20 in your pocket. If you get 100 referrals earning $20 a month, that is an extra $400 you'll earn every month!!!<br>  <br>  And by the way--never join a work at home program that wants you to pay up front. If they were making that much money, they wouldn't need to charge you.<br>  <br>  Note: There is a third site whose referral program works a bit differently, but they have a really high payout.|`|6193bc547cd74b5d2e6e0e47517d2e3faa	i have been there i find that most users are there for the money only and the same questions are asked over and over again i have seen the same question 14 times in an hour by different users|`|6e200b0e940ad334e77fac1a5f2a2ec1aa	it is quite good<br>  i liked it<br>  if yo r not registered click on <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.mylot.com/195734687951235475..." rel="nofollow">http://www.mylot.com/195734687951235475....</a>

AA11033854	Vendor rating is a process having strategic implications for managing a supply chain. Vendor rating can be done using analytic hierarchy process either by a single decision maker or by a group of decision makers. This approach may suffer from some drawbacks including bias in estimation process. A methodology is proposed in this paper which makes use of estimation of the rating by a group on an individual basis following the principle of anonymity. A statistical analysis is carried out to determine the confidence intervals for the estimates of the composite rating of the vendors. The procedure presented here helps in identifying those members whose opinions may significantly deviate from that of the group. Emphasis is placed on establishment of confidence limits in group decision-making.

There is no need for you to join some type of scam site, all you need is this legit information ;). I believe that one of the simplest and effective ways to make money online is by simply writing up your own information product or ebook and selling it through your own site.<br>  <br>  <br>  Step 1 Think of a solid business plan<br>  <br>  Before you take off writing anything, you need to make your own business plan. You need to set both short term and long term goals and determine the proper accounting for your business. How much will it cost to start up, and how much do you currently have? <br>  <br>  If you do not know html or have no clue about putting up a website then will you pay someone to do it for you? How much money are you predicting to make in the first six months? How will you raise the capital to start up with? Well, just to tell you, starting your own online business is very cheap compared to an offline one. <br>  <br>  In matter of fact, all you need is about $1000 to start up. This may seem like a lot, but let’s say that you invest $1000 in your business, and 6 months later netted in $100,000. I do not know about you but that seems like a darn good return on an investment. That is what I love about the internet…. you can start up for next to nothing and make tremendous returns on your investment. It would be very difficult to invest little money in an offline business and generate extreme returns. So, just to tell you, if you are new to the game then here is what your start up costs will most likely look like. <br>  <br>  Start up costs <br>  <br>  Asset One: Domain name/Hosting: An example of a domain name is www.google.com. An example of a hosting service is godaddy. This is where your website servers will be hosted at. It is like renting space for your website online, very similar to real estate. <br>  <br>  Costs: Around $20-$30 per month. <br>  <br>  Asset two: Website professional done: You can hire a good graphic designer on a freelance service and have them do your whole website for you in matter of days! The good news is it is very affordable. <br>  <br>  Costs: Some will do your website for as low as $200-$300 USD.  <br>  <br>  Asset three: Autoresponder: You can get a good autoresponder for around $10.00 USD a month. This is critically important so that you can snatch visitors contact information that come to your website. Once you collect their information, you can keep in touch with them throughout the years. If they come on your site and leave then you will most likely not see those visitors ever again. So, always have a way to collect their information, and an autoresponder is a great way to go about this. <br>  <br>  Costs: Around $10.00 per month. <br>  <br>  Asset four: Advertising/marketing dollars: It is always a good idea to have money saved for your marketing/advertising campaign. Sometimes you will have to pay to drive traffic to your site. Traffic, is basically the count of individuals that come across your website. You will need targeted people to come so that they can check out what you are offering and hopefully purchase a thing or two. <br>  <br>  Costs: Around $400-$500 USD for starters.<br>  <br>  <br>  Asset five: Payment processor: the good news is, you can always use paypal, which is absolutely free! <a href=”https://www.paypal.com/us/mrb/pal=... Click here to sign up for paypal</a>. I cannot recommend this enough to starters you can make your website a virtual cash register simply by adding a “buy right now” button on your website via paypal. <br>  <br>  Costs: $0 per month. <br>  <br>  These are the basic start up costs that I can think of. You could always use more, but this is what should get you through in the beginning. Once you start getting sales then you will need to properly reinvest back in your business in order to expand it more.   <br>  <br>  Step 2: Research your niche<br>  <br>  Before you invest all of the time and money into developing a product, you had better make sure that people are looking for information about what your about to sell. How do you determine this? Simple, you play with the keywords in the search engines. Contrary to belief, you want to target niches that have a lot of competition in them. Where there is lots of competition for a niche that tells you that this niche is established. When a niche is established that tells you that you can dig your own hole in the area and make some money for yourself. The overture search tool has been giving me some problems recently and has been down quite a bit. Here is a link to a keyword tool that works nicely: <a href="http://our.affiliatetracking.net/w... here for an excellent keyword tool</a>.  <br>  <br>  Once you find a good niche then you can get an idea on the type of product you want to sell. You should try to find your usp (unique selling proposition). If your niche is saturated, then what will make people want to purchase from you as compared to all of your other competitors. Does your website offer innovation, or is your product that remarkable, how are your prices? These are some crucial factors that you should keep note of when developing your product. <br>  <br>  Step 3: Premarketing<br>  <br>  This is a huge mistake that I made in the past so do not do it yourself. That was simply waiting to do all of the marketing once my product was finished. No,no.no. You should always be doing the marketing before your product is released so you can build brand awareness and anticipation about your product before it is out. Just think about it, have you ever saw a movie come out and then release their trailers? Of course not, they always have their trailers weeks, and months before it’s officially out. You want to work on driving traffic to your website before its out, and capture the individuals names and emails so that they can be notified of your product once its out.  Of course you should always work hard on generating traffic to your website once its out, but to get things rolling you should always build anticipation about your product before its live. Just look at a lot of showbiz believe it or not to see how they do their prerelease marketing, its very cleverly done. <br>  <br>  Step 4: Follow through<br>  <br>  Make sure to follow your business plan through! Before your website is done and has everything that it needs, you should try your hardest to stick with your business plan. Set money goals, and how much time that you plan to achieve them in. There is a high chance that things will not go 100% the way you attended it to, but try to bounce back and adjust once plans go off stray. Hurry up and get your first information product out there and written, the internet is a huge monetizing opportunity. Take care and the best of luck.  <br>  <br>  I provided you some resourceful information so please take the time to vote me for best answer, take care.|`|GW7t05eKaa	Here is a fantastic company that will allow you to work from home.

You use the federal filing copy when you file federal taxes and the state filing copy when you file state income taxes.<br>  <br>  If you live in one of the few places that require you to file a local tax return, then you file 3 returns (state, local, and federal) and use the corresponding filing copies for each.<br>  <br>  You keep all the "reference" copies for your own records.  You do not file them.|`|BoAEgaAGaa	When you live in states like here in Ohio, besides the federal income tax return, you then have a state income tax return to file.  Also most cities have an income tax so then you need a W-2 for the city return.  There are also a portion of the school districts in Ohio that have a school district income tax which needs a W-2 attached.  Many times we have to make extra copies of the W-2s to complete all the required returns.  <br>  <br>  Also there could be more than 2 localities withheld on the same W-2 that requires more W-2s created to list all the different locations the the taxpayer has worked.  <br>  <br>  Oh wonderful Ohio and all our taxes.  It keeps us tax pros very busy this time of year.  Some states only have a federal income tax return.

Can you supply them if they say yes?<br>  <br>  You will most likely need to go to Arkansas to see the buyer who buys products like yours. It is very competitive and price is everything.

UV8bN0Giaa	This is just brief and not in depth but according to my rough calculations a $10,000 investment with an 8% compounded growth annually would be worth approx $21,589 at the end of 10 years which for all intensive purposes is more than double your original investment so yes, nothing wrong with putting $10K there.  <br>    <br>  A $10,000 initial outlay with 8% compounded growth<br>  At the End of Year 1 should be  $10,800<br>  At the End of Year 2 should be $11,664<br>  At the End of Year 3 should be $12,597<br>  At the End of Year 4 should be $13,605<br>  At the End of Year 5 should be $14,693<br>  At the End of Year 6 should be $15,869<br>  At the End of Year 7 should be $17,138<br>  At the End of Year 8 should be $18,509<br>  At the End of Year 9 should be $19,990<br>  At the End of Year 10 should be $21,589<br>  <br>  Problem is nothing is guaranteed and there is always RISK INVOLVED causing the market value to flunctuate, sometimes downward in the wrong direction,  Best Bet is never be greedy and put all your investment eggs in one basket.  <br>  <br>  By the way, one major shortfall or something often overlooked in a lot of investment strategies is paying taxes, yuh!|`|AA10033605	Based on the compound interest calculator in the link, a $10,000 investment at 8% compounded interest would be worth $21,589 in 10 years. The $20,000 is obviously less than the 8% target.|`|3IWcasy6aa	if you require 8% return from an investment based on its risk profile and the current risk free rate you should not make the investment.  I am estimating since I do not have a calculator with me but the rate of return to double in 10 years is about 7.2% less than you require from the type of investment

For the basic info, see Seller Education on the Site Map at Ebay.<br>  <br>  DOING BUSINESS... <br>  <a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/SELL-ON-EBAY-Super-Simple-8-PROFESSIONAL-E-PROGRAMS_W0QQitemZ220109205060QQihZ012QQcategoryZ46685QQtcZphotoQQcmdZViewItem" rel="nofollow">http://cgi.ebay.com/SELL-ON-EBAY-Super-S...</a><br>  Get yourself a starter kit...but watch out for "FREE" ones that actually bill your credit $39./mo starting in 14 days!! (I just saw one here).<br>  <br>  Alot depends on how many different items you will be selling. If you just have one or two items, and aren't planning on doing a business, then you can just AUCTION, the more expensive listing costs.  Just do some research so you know what to price so it will sell, and some of the ins/outs of FIXED and RESERVED auctions if you will require that for these couple items. Auctions are on a sliding scale, but suffice it to say - up to $9.99 (item cost only, shipping doesn't count except in Paypal money receipt)....it's about 65 -85 cents to list.<br>  <br>  If you have 20-30 items laying around, - and plan on finding popular selling types of items that you can get wholesale to keep on "moving on" after whatever it is you are starting with is dwindling (though if you have a garage, it never has to!)...<br>  <br>  ...then you open the EBAY STORE for $15/mo and you can still (and should)  AUCTION the popular items once per week or so (now this is just a generic comment)... which brings buyers to your store. You would then just be auctioning a couple things a week and keep costs in line with whatever your budget/goal/product line will bear.<br>  <br>  (auctions cost more to list, I have a formula somewhere - it's auction and pay 8% + $1.00 (I'm including Paypal), or inventory, and it's 10% +, well nevermind, I can't find my piece of paper right now! email me!)<br>  <br>  The cost to list each inventory item (in the $15.00/mo Store), is only $0.06 cents each, and includes a gallery picture. ($0.05 cents without). However, when it sells you do pay approx. 3% more closing costs, but that is really nothing.<br>  <br>  I started my Store over a year ago, and including the first month - have always made minimum double my FEES and COSTS. I.e., profit. It's a bit tricky with a small store like mine, so knowing some the ropes, tricks and tips really helps.<br>  <br>  I auction popular items once per week, and offer discounted shipping, - people tend to look at what else you have in a store setting, lured there by the GREAT item on Auction at Great price...., and many purchase more than just the auction item.<br>  <br>  TIP: To have 100 pictures in your ad, and only pay for the gallery (little picture that shows up in auctions and in your store)....get a web-host, ($3.99/mo at Peaceful Sites.com), and upload your pictures there. If you "host" your own images, Ebay doesn't charge.<br>  <br>  For a VERY popluar and run-down, I have a bundled package that gives people all the information, plus programs to use- it's what I use -and sell in my Ebay store ....<br>  <a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/SELL-ON-EBAY-Super-Simple-8-PROFESSIONAL-E-PROGRAMS_W0QQitemZ220109205060QQihZ012QQcategoryZ46685QQtcZphotoQQcmdZViewItem" rel="nofollow">http://cgi.ebay.com/SELL-ON-EBAY-Super-S...</a><br>  <br>  For all it's faults, Ebay is the leader.

3IWcasy6aa	if you bought the car not lease which I assume is true because you said loan you should have some options.  You say you were 18 and no credit when you bought the car.  If you have made the payments on time you should have built up some decent credit by now, not long enough for excellent credit but decent none the less.  If your main goal is just lower payments and assuming the car is in good shape which after two years I hope it is you can just refinance the car check with your bank/credit union or even the original lender (if they know you will refinance anyway they usually work with you to lower the interest rate.  This is usually the best option financially since you have already taken alot of depreciation on the car.  You have 3 years left on the current loan so it would be smart not to get a loan longer than 3 years you do not want longer because you will end up paying more in the long run.  Otherwise you probably owe about what the car is worth unless you put alot down and since you were 18, I doubt you did.  This means if you sell the car or trade it in you will end up getting nothing out of it and will start over, you could still get a lower payment on the next car assuming similar price because you hopfully have some credit now and can get better rates.  I suggest you seriously consider refinancing and keeping the current car, it really would be the best for you financially.

AA12008845	I have to assume your Realtor showed you many properties and made every effort in his/her power to help things along.  Most of their efforts likely included driving around and considering the gas prices today, I suggest you buy the Realtor a GIFT CERTIFICATE for gas accompanied with a card that includes your appreciation and desire to work with him/her in the future.

Talked with them & work out a payment arrangement and get them to sign a promisary note promising to pay the amount. Then if this is successful and they default by not paying then take them to court and the promise pay in writing is your proof.

3IWcasy6aa	I did not know you could invest in investopedia, but if you have a margin account you can carry a negative balance if not it really depends on the broker.  The law says you have three days to deliver the money but some brokers won't let you place the trade if the money is not already there.  If they let you place the trade you will have a negative account for three days or until you put in the money.  If you do not they will sell of your account enough to pay the negative amount.  The do not need to sell the asset you bought that put you negative.  They will sell what ever is easiest for them.|`|ea8a7d4da7b649e06dea521fe9df2a24aa	I can't imagine they or anybody else would let you invest money that you don't have in your trade account, so I would say that you're not able to go into the negative.

So go to it.|`|hl4kkvXhaa	Talk to your father.  Since you weren't close to your grandmother, I am guessing what she would want wouldn't be an issue.  When my great grandmother died, I was torn about going and about another commitment I had made prior...I talked to my grandma (I was close to both grandma and great grandma), and she told me that my great grandmother wouldn't have wanted me there mourning anyway, and to go to the other school related commitment because Great Grandma wouldn't have wanted me to be there to mourn while taking away from my education.  It helped ease my mind.<br>  <br>  My guess is, your father will realize how bad things are for you financially, and realize that this interview isn't one that can be put off.  My guess is he'll tell you to go to the interview.  You can still offer him support before and after, as he's going to need you in the time after the funeral.  My advice is to talk to your dad, and hopefully he can ease some of your worries.|`|bgnHRESjaa	are they both at the same time? maybe you could go to the interview and show up late to the funeral.|`|00390bee0bdfb56e0334bd2845fadd9aaa	what would SHE have wanted you to do?<br>  LOOK she is already gone<br>  If YOU were MY granddaughter, I would NOT want you to pass up an opportunity to try for this job.<br>  It matters MORE how you treated this person IN LIFE< not after death....
3IWcasy6aa	this does seem high to me but one reason is short selling.  When a stock is sold short the current holder (lender of the shares) still effectivly holds the stock and the entity that buys from the short seller also holds the stock.  The short position is not subtracted from the institutional ownership<br>  <br>  a company has 100% institutional ownership, some one opens a short position worth 10% of the company selling short to an institutional buyer.  The company now has the original 100% institutional ownership plus the new 10% institutional owners so 110% institutional ownership but there is also a 10% short interest which offsets this since it will have to be eventually bought back. <br>  <br>  I know this is one reason this happens but I am not sure if their are any others since warrents, rights, and options would not increase ownership above 100% they simply dilute the ownership right of a single share thus the difference between nominal share counts and fully diluted share count.|`|4Td20wgraa	1) Those numbers are reported quarterly.  There may be some overlap in reporting.<br>  2) Short selling.|`|AA10160243	That is a good question.

If you apply for another job your boss is going to know because they will probobly contact for a reference. Try this approach. Find a time when you and your boss can talk. Tell your boss that you would like more challenging work. Maybe ask what is the realistic chance of you moving up or into a different department. Whatever you don't come accross as threatning. Don't say things like if you don't get this then you're leaving. Come across sincere. Any good boss will want to work with you unless your performance blows chunks. That may be another question ask what your boss thinks of your performance and depending ask for more challenges. If your comfortable where you are then that's what you do. If you really want to get a new job you might be back to square one.

AA10233692	In the US, it mostly depends on how many people are sending bills to that payee.  The more bills get sent out, the bigger likelihood the bank is going to want to stop writing checks and paying postage and will just direct deposit the bills.<br>  <br>  Sounds like you're not running a megacorp, so you're probably stuck getting paper checks every time someone wants to pay you.

AA10065077	Any injury that happens at work falls under worker's comp. insurance. The company itself can deny her sick leave but she will still get some money from the worker's comp insurance and the company can not fire her as long as she adheres to their attendance policy ie calling in everyday even though they know she'll be gone. Also if the accident happened at work and she wants to come back most places have what's called light duty and she will do that for however long the dr says she has to. It sucks because worker's comp only pays you like 70% of your wage.

3IWcasy6aa	If anyone could tell you this they would already be putting all of their money into it driving up the price and reducing the return.  The more you want to gain the more risk of losing money you take.

If you pick the right stocks (or mutual fund/etf whatever) you can hit as much as 6X that amount (some would argue more but then thats going into areas like Forex and penny stocks which I will not discuss/recommend or endorse). Whjat you want to do is look for trends in the market and one year is a pretty safe area (any lower and I woudl also recommend the above post). Right now the hottest areas are FOREIGN MARKETS, Mining, Some financials, Oil to a point, telecommunications and consumer staples. It also depends on what you want to gain in a year. If you want to swing for the fench then I would say an ETF with total foreign exposure. But beware mine (VEU) has gone up almost 10% since I bought it a month ago.  For a more conserative play global stocks like GE, Exxon, Boeing etc should be safe. For some real risks try Delta when it comes out of bankruptcy in a few days (and that is really risky I don't like airlines right now) if you are not sure about what sectors are hot then an ETF on sector rotation from Claymore/Zacks (XRO) would be a conservative play as well. Or you could go market emulation like DIA and mirror the stock market. or maybe go really safe and go a bond route. <br>  <br>  Basically the point is its up to you. Whay you feel comfortable with, keeping it for one year helps on your taxes when you sell it but whatever you pick put in a stop loss under it so you really don't lose a lot.|`|45d9a03dccc2df3ad514ba7237bcc81eaa	Of the stocks I own, here is the one that I think will do the best over the coming year:<br>  <br>  NVBF.ob - Nova Biosource - they are building 4 biodiesel refineries<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.top10traders.com/ViewHolding.aspx?symbol=NVBF.OB" rel="nofollow">http://www.top10traders.com/ViewHolding....</a>

For example stocks can be sold and you would get the money in 3 days, but to sell a house that fast you would likly have to take a loss that would not be considered reasonable.  So stocks, bonds, mutual funds, savings, checking and of course cash are all liquid capital where as art, collectables, real estate, and many hard assets are not.

You will need to pay for this so yes there is a CC involved<br>  <br>  You can also go to FICO at www.myfico.com and get scores from them they have annual packages or what I use is one time checks for 14.95 per agency in other words $45 for all of them which is what you should do.  Yes they need a CC for payment.<br>  <br>  Another option which is new to me is Washington Mutual Bank www.wamu.com just started advertising free monthly credit scores with there MasterCard, this is in leiu of any rewards or cash back program.  So this is a free way to get the score but rewards cards generally have slightly high credit requirements so you may need slightly better credit to qualify.|`|6mbXEKa3aa	Hmmm, that doesn't make much sense.

Any bank will work if you are the city, I would look for an online account at a major bank.  This will give you the benefits of an online account, basically better rates and lower fees.  At the same time you can go to a brank if you need to for any reason.  I would suggest Citibank or Bank of America because they are everywhere and you will likly find a branch where ever you are in the country, good for travel and in case you go to college in a different city which you do not know now regardless of what you think.  If you travel internationally then I would use Citibank.  You could also consider a online only bank which would get you slightly better rates.  For my own account I felt that the slightly better rates were not worth the convinience of having a branch if I ever need it.<br>  <br>  Mom or Dad do not need to be on the account.|`|lKx965X7aa	i had my own bank account and atm card when i was 17...try bank of america.
3IWcasy6aa	Most US investors like to see steady income growth from a company.  Managers can "manage" earnings in several ways they can take some liberty in when sales are booked, they can offer clients a special deal to get sales into a certain period or they can you available for sale investments as you said.  Using available for sale however is not as effective because many analysts will quickly see through this and count them as extraordinary income not as regular income.  What happens is these are carried at book unless they are traded securities or something else that is efficiently priced and can be sold at any time when all profit or loss would be booked at that time.  Think of your brokrage account only telling you the value of you account based on what you pay for investments and when you sell them all profits or losses only show up then.  This is not a popular method of earnings managment because they are easy to see as not part of the course of normal business and are on the financial income line not in operating earnings.  Companies do this not to manage income but for the same reason you have these investments, they do not want their cash just sitting around if they can earn a return on them.  The other ways mentioned can be nearly impossible to see so this is how managers manage earnings
dZMg1aNQaa	Your on the right track!<br>  <br>  To protect investors, all mutual funds are highly regulated by the federal government, through the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). As part of this government regulation, all funds must provide a prospectus to potential investors free of charge. The SEC requires a fund to provide a full prospectus either before you invest or together with the confirmation statement for your initial investment. A prospectus is designed to provide investors with the information they need to make informed investment decisions. <br>  <br>   A fund's prospectus describes the fund's goals, fees and expenses, investment strategies and risks, as well as information on how to buy and sell shares. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|4b630af2206ab6496f2ef1fcfee51cf2aa	ETF's have prospectuses as well its pretty much a tell on on how they invest and why, expenses, holdings sector breakdown. Pretty much mandatory to get before you buy one.|`|3IWcasy6aa	A prospectus is a detailed document that gives a huge amount of information about any listed investment.  Stock and bond issues both have prospectuses when they are first issued to the public.  Mutual funds and investment type issurance policies both have prospectuses that must be updated annually or more often since they are continuosly sold.  Much of the information is similar to wht you would find in an annual report from a company, the 20F which you can download from the SEC not the one that companies have on their website or they send out to investors which is sometimes a streamlined version filled with glossy versions of the detail in the 20F.<br>  <br>  It basically gives almost any information an investor would want to make an investment decision.
MoOwhKAeaa	What this sounds like to me is the company setup with you a payment plan of some sorts. The credit card was where they were to get their payment. When you filed bankruptcy, the credit card company blocks all transactions. Thus your payment was not made. So they are entitled to either get payment in full (figuring no other card is available) or repossess the purchased item.

xzyzLoamaa	My brother sent me an email regarding this and the one he told me about was for May 15 there was to be no gas pumping at all.|`|3gQr9dN3aa	I get an e-mail every other week to not buy gas. They are boycotting Exxon and Mobil. They figure if enough people boycott, the price will go down. I personally don't believe it. The gas big wigs will make their money regardless.|`|f714ef26ad8f0b92d25c68a6b4041d5daa	None of these boycott schemes will have any effect.  The only thing that would have an effect is if we reduced our overall consumption of gasoline, which I don't think will happen anytime soon.|`|3IWcasy6aa	These boycotts are going to bring down the price of gas because if no one buys gas from XOM they will have to drop the price, this will work because it will take 3-10 Billion US$ out of XOMs pockets per day depending on who's numbers you use.<br>  <br>  Ok lets think this through in a place I like to call reality.  If you do not buy gas from XOM but use the same amount of gas that means that alot more gas is being bough from the smaller guys who are less able to handle the volume so they will raise prices at the same time that XOM lowers price.  This is at the retail level because at the wholesale level they all buy from each other depending on who is more convinient and then mix in their additive before delivery to the station.  <br>  <br>  Actually I love the Citgo Venezuela boycotts even more because Citgo provides 42% of the gasoline in Florida but does not own a single one of the stations with their name in the US.  Back the topic on hand so I drive along I see a shell station with a big line selling gas for $3.10 and accross the street a Mobile with no line for $2.95, hmmm I think I'll buy from the Mobile soon more people buy from the Mobile and they raise their price and the Shell lowers their price.  <br>  <br>  In the mean time XOM corporation has sold their excess gas to shell to cover the shortfall at Shell so they still made their money.  Who lost?  Well what about the small business owner who owns the Mobil station he didn't sell gas for a couple of days while the protest went on and had to lower the price to loss in order to get things going again.  Who won?  The small business owner accross the street with the Shell station raised his profit margin because he was selling about as fast as Shell could deliver.  DID YOU THINK XOM OR SHELL OWNED THE STATIONS WITH THEIR NAMES ON THEM???? sure they own some but most are franchises held by the small business owner who owns one or two stations, a few own several even less own alot.<br>  <br>  What happened to XOM and Shell in all this?  Well Shell was buying alot of gas wholesale and XOM was selling it but the price did not change much and they both made close to the same profit in the final delivery to retailers.  XOM will lose some money because the franchise fees from the small business owners will drop and Shell will make the same amount more but this is minor and as we saw it self corrected itself really fast.<br>  <br>  So what woulod help?  Use less gas, guess what your small difference won't change any thing but if 42 million Americans (13% of the population)  use 1 gallon of energy (not just gas but all oil products) per week there will be 1 million barrels less demand per week and over the course of a couple of months this would lower price.  Really it does not seem far fetched to think the average American could cut energy use by 2-5 gallons a week. I know I could.  Just combine driving trips, if it is less than 1/2 a mile walk, drive more paitiently.  this would make a big difference.  If everyone that sends these stupid emails did this we would have a lower energy cost in everything.

aiDV9FgGaa	I have never heard the expression, but my guess would be the value of a loyal customer is a selling point to doing business with someone. For example, a customer promises that if you do his loan, he will bring you all of his business accounts to your bank. He will remain "loyal" to you.|`|6yHQxmhOaa	Loyalty is of huge value. Companies strive for loyalty, it's a main goal - because with loyalty come repeat visits, evangelizing to friends/family/co-workers, and ensures engagement with the brand. The more engagement with a brand, the more they could potentially spend. Loyalty is very valuable.

In it there are letters and a lot of information on how to handle these people. Also, it will guide you on how to get out of debt using the debt snowball method.  This book is really helpful, I did it on my own and it worked.  <br>  <br>  Good Luck!!!|`|xoqQbHi1aa	Please do not consolidate. It is not free, they will lower your payments by increasing the length of time until you are debt free, and you will take a hit on your credit score. There is a better way.<br>  <br>  A. Have a garage sale and sell anything that you no longer need or want.<br>  <br>  B.Get a temporary part time job, if you have one, get another. <br>  <br>  <br>  Here is a plan that can help you. If you work the plan, the plan will work for you:<br>  1. Make a budget. Make the budget a week before you get paid. A budget is not a punishment! It is a tool which will free you from ever having to worry about money again. Put everything in your budget. Especially those annual, biannual, or quarterly bills like car registration, insurance, etc. Give every dollar you are going to bring home the name of where it is going. Add an "emergency fund" category to your budget for 25 dollars and save up until you have 1000-1250 dollars. Your emergency fund will help keep you from getting into new debt because of an emergency. If you can, set up a direct transfer to a savings account for your emergency fund. That way it moves automatically and you don't even have to worry about it. You must cut your spending and live on less than you make.<br>  <br>  2.First get current on all of you debts and make no more late payments. Stop using your credit cards immediately. Do not take on any more debt. Credit cards are like quicksand only the death is much slower. Make a list of all of your debts in order of highest interest rate to lowest interest. Use cash only for your spending from now on.<br>  <br>  3.Pay the minimum due on all of your debts and then put your extra money towards paying off the highest interest one first. After you get that one paid off, you put the money you were paying on debt #1 (the minimum payment and the extra payment) towards debt #2. That will pay debt #2 off faster. When that is paid off, you put all three payments towards card #3 and that one will be paid off pretty quickly. As an example:<br>  <br>  To start :<br>  Debt #1 (highest interest): minimum payment+ extra payment<br>  Debt #2 (middle interest): minimum payment<br>  Debt #3(lowest interest): minimum payment<br>  <br>  Debt #1: paid off<br>  Debt #2: minimum payment from Debt #1+ Minimum payment from Debt #2 +extra payment<br>  Debt #3: minimum payment<br>  <br>  Debt #1: paid off<br>  Debt #2: paid off<br>  Debt #3:Mimimum payment from card #1+ minimum payment from Debt #2+ minimum payment from Debt #3+ extra payment.<br>  <br>  That way, you will get them all paid off, on time, and pay the least interest. It will also help towards rebuilding your credit since you will no longer have any late payments. This works no matter how many different debts you may have.<br>  <br>  4. After you get all of your debts paid off, add to your emergency fund until you have 6-12 months of income saved up. Put that emergency fund money into a liquid money market fund or into a Bank of America no-risk CD so that if you need the money you can take it out without penalty.<br>  <br>  5a. When you have your emergency fund in place, add a category for "fun" to your budget. Save for a holiday, a vacation, a big screen, or dinners out, whatever goal you want. Remember to enjoy your life.<br>  <br>  5b. When you have your emergency fund in place, start saving for your retirement. Join the 401(k) plan at work and contribute the maximum. Your employer probably matches at least part of your contribution so why give up free money? Open a Roth IRA and contribute the maximum on a monthly basis. If you start saving for your retirement now, you will probably retire a millionaire.<br>  <br>  5c. When you have your emergency fund in place, start saving for your next car. Only buy cars, or other things that depreciate, with cash. Save up for a nicer car. That way you get the interest instead of paying the interest.<br>  <br>  You can do it and it isn't as hard as you think. Just follow the plan|`|DZ9sDyDhaa	What I do is when I get extra money or sell something I call and settle and pay off a bill. It takes some time but when I first started I had 8 credit cards. With no job I have been able to pay off 4 of them and have 4 left.

I hope it all goes well.|`|y4SUDnpaaa	I can only agree that you should read Dave Ramsey's book, Financial Freedom.It is not a get rich scheme rip off, it's written in way that anyone can understand and gives you sensible advice on how to get out of debt and stay out of debt.
fTR0VCU9aa	The answer named Judy to completly wrong on her answer. Research before answer a question is key. <br>  A company should not be asking to see your social security card. First you complete the I9 this determines your eligibility to work in the USA. The directions state clearly that a company can not tell you what documents to use (you can show your passport, birth certificate i.e.). For the W4 I am not sure why they are asking for the copy. They should not be. They can however call the SSA and confirm the validity of your number. Some employers believe this is in their right but actually they are only required to confirm to the best of their knowledge that the info given to them is accurate. This is just a misinformed company and I would be leary of using them. If they are not up to date on employment law then the possible quality of candidates would lack the same knowledge.|`|AA10469473	They can require you to show it to them.|`|zuGKIWfNaa	They shouldn't need any additional documentation to go with a W-4 form.

Or you can get a loan for a car, furniture or personal loan and pay it back as agreed.<br>  <br>  A paid repossession is not near as bad as a unpaid one but it's still bad.|`|Tvcn83Adaa	The only thing that can be taken off of your credit report was that a balance was owed, not the repossession.

The problem is that the repossession is just one of your problems.<br>  <br>  Your past credit history is important to your score. Other factors are the age of your relationship with your creditors, the percentage of your outstanding credit to available credit, applications for new credit and your payment history.<br>  <br>  You will have to pay all your bills on time all the time, and use as small a fraction of your available credit as possible. Also avoid applying for new credit for a while.|`|e499cc2d1f4f4aefd7f159ea74492043aa	over time  - get some credit cards and dont max them out
Z9jtdw17aa	The first thing you do is STOP charging anything.  Cut up all but the one with the lowest fees and interest rates, and put it away for use only in an emergency.  Let me say that again: CUT THEM UP so that you are not tempted to charge more as the balances come down.  <br>  <br>  Go "cash and carry."  If you can not pay for an item you absolutely have to have, put it in lay-away instead of charging it.  You don't have access to the item until it is paid for, but you can pay it out over time and there is rarely interest on lay-away programs. <br>  <br>  Identify the rates and fees for the cards you have.   Your next step is bring down the rates you are paying.  Call the company that has the card with the lowest rate, and ask them to decrease it further.  If they will, great.  Even if they don't, proceed from that point.  Call every company you have a card with and tell them about the lower rate you have with a competitor.  Ask them to meet or beat it.  They probably will.  If they will not, transfer your balances to that lowest rated card.  If you max out the lowest card, then go to the next lowest and keep on transferring until you can eliminate the highest fees and rates.  You can call the company with the lowest rates and tell them what you are planning to do.  They may re-evaluate your credit limit to facilitate the move.  <br>  <br>  Eliminate the highest fees/rates first, and pay them off as soon as possible.  Apply windfall income to the highest fee/rate balance, rather than spending it on a splurge.<br>  <br>  Consolidation may be over-rated.  It really doesn't matter if you make 5 payments if they are all getting an identical rate.  It will be more convenient of course, but if your limits can't be increased, just make the various payments and learn from the hassle not to get into this situation again.<br>  <br>  Another hint - DO reward yourself with non-monetary splurges when you get a card paid off or reach a milestone (Like after every $3000 reduction in debt, you'll spend an afternoon doing some favorite activity that you normally are too busy for. )  You must learn to reward yourself in inexpensive or non-purchase oriented ways.  An evening with friends over and a meal at home might be just the ticket, or perhaps an afternoon neglecting housework while you just relax at the park and really feel how good it feels to be that much further out of debt.  Save up a bit for a bigger splurge when you are out of debt, but for goodness sake don't go into debt for the splurge!<br>  <br>  |`|7ygicWvzaa	Real estate is probably going to be your only way. Most loan companies have limits far below 40k.  So unless you can refinance a house or purchase an investment property the only other way would be to go through a credit counseling program.  They will put all your debt together  and work out a more affordable payment, call and negotiate lower interest rates with your cc companies and you pay one payment.

Consolidation is perfect for those who are looking to better their debit for the future. There are many advantages for cardholders who consolidate debit card debt. If you are thinking about consolidation, then there are a few things you should consider before doing so. Use these tips as a guide while you consolidate your debt.<br>  <br>  There are several great reasons to consolidate debit card debt. One of the best reasons is to get better rates. If you can get a better rate on a consolidation than you currently have, then there is no reason not to consolidate. Anytime you can consolidate debit card debt and save yourself money, you should. Locate all of your interest rates from each card and write them on a list. Then note the new rate you would be given. If the new rate is lower than the average of the old rate, then to consolidate debit card debt would be profitable for you. If there are cards that have a lower rate, then you don't have to include them in your consolidation. Another reason people love to consolidate debit card debt is to make their lives simple. By paying one bill, they can cut out a lot of stress and bill paying time. You should probably not consolidate debit card debt for this reason alone however. You don't want to pay more in the long run just to cut out a few pieces of mail monthly. Consolidation also gives those in a debit card mess a chance to get out of it. By consolidating, they may be making lower monthly payments than they would be if they didn't consolidate debit card debt. By closing out the other accounts, their debit may also be improved.<br>  <br>  When you want to consolidate debit card debt, you should turn to professionals. There are many great debit card companies and banks that would love to help you with your request. Make sure you do your research so that when you consolidate debit card debt, you are certain you are making a decision that is profitable to you. Make sure there are no hidden fees that come with different consolidation plans. Doing your research can help you save money for the future.<br>  <br>  If you want to consolidate debit card debt, you should first look at all of your debt in detail. Once you know what you have, it will be easier to contact professionals to help you with your consolidation. Don't be afraid to tell them you are shopping for the best deal. You should do yourself the honor of getting the best deal out there to making your consolidation as worthwhile as possible.<br>  |`|AA10802454	     I do not have the time now to look up any references,besides any leg work would be geographic.

RqQDKEVHaa	Realtor in CA has it right.<br>  <br>  Problem is, you apparently went into this without having a strategy. For example, if this is your own residence, not a rehab/investment property, you've done it wrong. Should have gotten a 203k loan. That's an FHA-insured loan that combines purchase money (like a regular mortgage) with money to fix the property up. Like a hard money loan, it's based on the fixed-up value of the property, not the pre-rehab cost.<br>  <br>  If it's an investment property, you should have purchased it with a hard money loan. A hard money loan is based on the value of the asset, not your credit. Around where I am, hard money lenders will lend up to 65% of the ARV (after repair value) of the property. So, if a property fixed up would be worth $100,000, they'll lend up to $65,000. That means that if you can get the property for $50,000, you'll have $15,000 for rehab. If you can get it for $40,000, you'll have $25,000 for rehab.<br>  <br>  However, you did it backwards. Hard money loans are only for 6 months to a year. They're meant to cover purchase and rehab. Then you refinance into some other mortgage, or you sell the property. Doesn't make sense to buy for cash, then get a hard money loan. Also, hard money loans are expensive. Where I am, they typically run 5 points and 15% interest. So on a $100,000 loan, you'd pay $5,000 in points and $1,500 a month in interest.<br>  <br>  Maybe you can get a mortgage or a HELOC (home equity line of credit). Or maybe you can find a contractor and work out a deal to share the profits of the sale. But, I'm sorry, you did it all backwards by paying cash, then hoping to find fix-up money.|`|aQhjEz66aa	Hard money lenders will primarily lend money based upon the asset that is backing the loan as opposed to things like credit scores and other items that a traditional lender takes into account.  They typically charge a high interest rate (usually 10% - 20%) and points (3 - 8) for a short period of time (3 to 12 months) with a balloon payment due at the end.  They usually loan at about 65% loan to value or less. <br>  <br>  If you use hard money, you need to have a plan to pay the money back when it's due, otherwise they will foreclose on the house.  If your house is currently unmortgageable because of it's condition, you can go the hard money route and then refinance with a conventional lender to pay off the hard money lender.  Make sure you are preapproved (not just prequalified) for the loan you will need pending an appraisal that will be done after the house is repaired.<br>  <br>  As an alternative, you may want to look into construction loans through a local bank.  The rates/terms will be a lot better.<br>  <br>  Also, if the house is mortgageable, go the regular route.  It should only take about 4 weeks to close the refinance loan.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|AFepJWRlaa	"Hard money loan" is made by private lenders usually at a high interest rate and short term, because the risk is high. It's still secured by the property, so if you default, the property goes to them.<br>  <br>  What you are asking the lender to do is be your partner! If you succeed in completing the repairs and selling the house, you both make money.<br>  <br>  If you are unsuccessful in the "flip", you loose, he gets the house. <br>  <br>  If you only need it to fix up for your own living, then the above is irrelevant.<br>  <br>

In the West Spanish language local papers are booming... the chances of employment are great if you are bilingual.<br>  Also, major retail stores recognize the importance of having a bilingual (Spanish/English) speaking person on the staff and many pay extra for it. (In California employees in the Department of Motor Vehicles get extra pay if they can also speak Spanish).<br>  Try checking with your local state department of employment and ask them what businesses are interested in a bilingual employee.|`|AA10065077	Become a translator.

bmvhfaOLaa	Florists are more successful than gift basket stores. I work in a florist and we not only do arrangements but we do gift baskets. Our flower shop's arrangements and gifts are also available for purchase online, so it easy to shop for too. We provide service for almost the entire houston because we own 10 stores in Houston. It depends on good management also. We don't sell anything with poor quality ever. Our florist has many regular customers and we always get new customers that become regular customers every week. So yes, I would believe that people would be more likely to go to a florist because of the variety of gifts (flower arrangements, gift & fruit baskets, chocolates) than a gift basket business.|`|YCaAnrjWaa	I had a gift basket business and it did not do well online at all.  You can check out giftbasketsharingcircle, you can read posts and ask questions.

3IWcasy6aa	Unless you work for a bank you could have to work on a Bank holiday.  Federal hodidays however are a different story, if you have to work on a federal holiday and you are an hourly employee you should get overtime pay as your job pays it.  If that holiday work is already overtime you should expect to get paid double overtime.  This means if overtime is 50% more than your pay you would get 100% more.  If you don't get this see if your coworkers will stand with you to fight it.  If not consider a different job|`|17a72a560aa5bc8c675beeee9f261401aa	Most people that I know of get paid time and a half for holidays.

3IWcasy6aa	You would pay a 10% penalty so $2,100 plus the 21,000 would be added to your income for the year which means you would pay regular tax on it as well and probably at a higher tax rate than you other wise would.  Fidelity will be required to take out 30% to pay taxes and you would need to wait until you file the years tax return to get back any overpayment, or of course pay any underpayment.  This means you would currently recieve $21,000 - 2,100 - 6,300 = 12,700.<br>  <br>  This is a bad idea if you must move I suggest you see how far you can go on the money you have and only do this as a last resort.  You may get lucky and find a job quickly and not need to take this money out at all.  At that point you have a choice of leaving the money in the 401k or rolling it into an IRA tax and penalty free, of course the money still would have the same penalties if you take out before 59 1/2.  <br>  <br>  By the way when you say this money won't add up to much anyway, if you figure an 8% average growth rate which is below the S&P 500s average growth of about 10.4% you would have $334,000 by the time you turn 64.  Not that small a sum of money.  At the average 10.4% it is close to $650,000 at 64 thats the magic of compounding.  You have done well to start early with your 401k you should do your best to keep it.  Remember even though these sums sound like a lot inflaition is compounding also so great start but you still need to keep working and you should try your best not to have to start over.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|EzrdyxAiaa	postpone  the wedding and see if it is true that distance  make the heart wonder  or fonder == mean while keep you job and get you debts under control == no one should make a major change like this heavy in debt == but back to your original question since love is blind == off the top of my head lets say 2100 for fees plus taxes maybe you would net 14K!!!|`|0d48b95c977a1e94afbc64b60d0d2d75aa	As told, you would pay about 40% in taxes.

Stay local and do your research.<br>  <br>  Since the stockmarket crashed it seems like all our portfolios including our super can do nothing but lose value. We do still have 2 investments that are performing well, some options in a mining company we bought over 2 years ago and a little home business we run for about 2 hours a week in the afternoons. The home business profits anywhere between $150 - $1,100 per week , with only 1 week in 14 months showing no profit at all so we're pretty happy with that. I cant remember the full name of the company but they abbreviate it to PGI and the websites www.pgi.net.au<br>  <br>  If u want, see if you can get in touch with a guy called Ben something from there, he was the one that showed us how to do it all.|`|4wL6QC5Xaa	If you are looking at starting a home business here are 10 steps you should take if you are in it for the long run. <br>  <br>  1.

Can you do small jobs around a home- gardening, painting, mowing lawns, washing cars? This is one type of business that requires little capital. In fact you can start this business with only human capital - your endeavour. Walk around your neighbourhood and see how many opportunities you have to wash cars or mow lawns. Knock on doors and let people know you are available and able to do this work. Do a letterbox drop in the area offering your services. You can start this business without any equipment as long as you let people know that you will mow their lawn using their mower or wash their car using their bucket, detergents and water at their home. Most people will have all the necessary stuff to use. Later on you can get your own.<br>  Remember, nothing is easy. Any business requires a plan, and constant effort and endeavour to succeed. One of the best bits of advice is 'find a need' and then 'satisfy that need'.|`|e301b21841125f44696fecf03b4b134faa	E-Bay.<br>  It's fun and you can make some bucks.<br>  (Profitable part-time hobby).
AA11326471	DON'T DO IT!! Physicians now make less than 30% of what they made in 1980 and spend more time hasseling with insurance companies who might or might not pay them.  It's insane to pay $200,000 for an education that lands you in a job with revenue that DECLINES EVERY YEAR.  Nurse practitioner or physicians assistant gets you the same responsibility without weekend call or calls at night and with a salary that is likely to go up each year.  Especially with the elections coming up, NONE of the candidates have a good solution.  Half of our congress voted to decrease physician payment by 10% and it was voted on again today.  If the cut goes through. the plan is to cut medicare payment by 40% by 2011!!!!  By the time you get into medicine, doctors will be paying people for the privilege of taking care of them!  It's not worth the investment of time or money because the return is declining every year.

As far as a field, HEALTHCARE is a great choice.If you like people and talking, think about working as a switchboard operator at a hospital. Good money, great benefits. If you are a loner, check into claims processing-mostly a one person working on tasks w/o alot of interaction. There are alot of other positions: check the job lines for entry-level. If you like healthcare, you have LOTS of opportunities for advancement, and in the meantime, plenty of exposure to what is out there while you are earning a check. Worked for me!

AA11988604	If you did not send your notice by certified mail, it will be their word against yours.  A lot will depend on how credible you seem in court compared to the landlord.  The fact that they are offering you something to stay suggests they are in trouble with vacancies.  This would be an incentive for them to claim they never got notice when in fact they may have.   Can you round up some other tenants or former tenants that had problems with the landlord being honest?  A few witnesses to other problems at the property might be persuasive.<br>  <br>  In the future, whenever you are required to provide written notice, send it by certified mail, with return receipt requested.  This will be sufficient proof in court, even though you could send an empty envelope.  :)|`|8063947433f50c3e93546a4ba2133fdcaa	hope you kept proof that you gave notice, that is what the judge will look for.|`|DyEIc0K8aa	That is why you always keep a carbon copy for something like this.

Turn the vent off of you soon it will be winter and they will turn it off.  Chances are they know it's bugging you so they are pushing you to see how far they can go.  Try to ignore it and get through the day as best you can.   It's hard to work in an office with others who do not share your same body temp.  |`|NlG3Vkdlaa	I would kick box my boss then quit. .. ..

Report the person who has control over the air conditioner to their boss. Perhaps there is an air vent you can block off with tape that's nearest you.

Just say you're sorry, you can't chat right now, you have work to do.  You should talk to your Manager/Supervisor about this to make sure they don't consider her to be your work superior in some way that she needs to know what you are doing.  <br>  <br>  If she still grills you like she deserves to know, suggest she talk with her supervisor if she is unsure what her own responsibilities consist of, and if they cross over what you are supposed to be doing.  Are you each others' back-up?  You don't need to catch her in a lie - she will do that to herself soon enough.  Just stop giving her any ammunition.

Zn8A9vWdaa	As different from a credit card, a debit card does not need a signature, but you do need to key in the PIN (personal identification number) of that debit card.  If your parents allow u to use that card, u may try to use it, until the store clerk asks for a ID card from you showing your ownership of that card.|`|MmTe8W8uaa	In MOST stores, they do not check the signatures.  They simply require you to write something where the signature goes; they do not check whether it is the signature of the person to whom the card was issued.<br>  <br>  However, Wal-Mart is one of the few stores that does sometimes check signatures or identification, so you would not be able to use it there.|`|MMeHdlu2aa	A debit card works like a check, it electronically debits the amount from your checking account, but unlike a check or a credit card, you don't sign for the purchase, when you are in person making a purchase, you enter a "personal identification number" (PIN) that proves you are authorized to use the card. <br>  The debit card should have your name on it since the account is yours even though your parents' names are also on the account.  You can use the debit card online as a regular credit card to make purchases.  <br>  Keep in mind that excellent bookkeeping is a must, this is your first account and using a debit card is easy to do without keeping the receipts to keep track of what you are spending.  One of your first purchases should be a Quicken program to keep track of your account and money that you will use to reconcile every month with the bank statement- it's easy and fun, and you want to get your financial life off to a good start keeping good records.<br>  Good luck!|`|ViZyM2AUaa	I use my dad's / mom's credit card all time.

They have been wonderful for him.  They work hard to work around his schedule.  As a server, you don't make a good salary, i.e., 2.15ish an hour, but you do get tips.  Depending on which nights he was working made a difference in his tips.  But he switched to "To Gos" and was making $10.00 an hour plus tips.  Due to the economy, people still want to eat out, but they don't seem to want to tip.  So, it's a gamble for you.  If you're a good server, people will reward you.  Another good place is the Mall stores.  Besides the salary which can be pretty good for college students, you also get a really decent discount on your purchases at the store.  On the con side for Malls, you tend to spend what you make before it gets home, so it takes discipline.  If there's anyway to get work study at your school, that's probably the best.  It's close, no gas to get there, and you're wearing what you wear to class.  <br>  I do wish you the best!!

eojDX3itaa	This year's stimulus payments are being delivered in a diff-<br>  erent fashion than last year's. The only people getting<br>  actual checks ($250) will be folks who receive Social Sec-<br>  urity, SSI, and veterans (pension and disability). Workers<br>  will start to see a small increase in their take-home pay as<br>  of April 1st as the withholding of federal income tax will<br>  decrease. The maximum amount of stimulus is $400 single<br>  and $800 for married. Any of this amount that you don't re-<br>  ceive via your paycheck will be a credit on the 2009 return<br>  you will file this time next year. At least, that is the plan <br>  right now of how this will all be administered.

XAesYVU9aa	The documents on your plan will spell this out in gory detail.<br>  <br>  401(k) plans, I believe, must allow you to do a direct rollover to avoid the 20% withholding.

It is the company and its stock.  <br>  <br>  With CL, you want to compare it to its competitors.  It has one major competitor--PG.  <br>  <br>  CL has revenue of 15 billion and earnings of 3.66 a share.  Its 10 year average p/e ratio is about 23. Its current p/e ratio is about 16.  Its dividend is about 2.9% and it has increased its dividend about 11% annually for the last 8 years.  Its revenue has increased about 6% annually and its earnings about 10.7%.  Its debt to equity ratio 1.75/1.  Its return on assets is about 19.5%.  <br>  <br>  PG has revenue of  85.5 billion and earnings of 3.64 a share.  It 10 year average p/e ratios is about 24.

It revenue has increased about 9% annually and its earnings about 12%.  Its debt to equity ratio is 0.35. Its return on assets is about 8.6%. <br>  <br>  Now you can do a proper analysis by comparing CL to PG.   To me they appear to be about similarly valued.  The one thing to notice about CL is it extremely high debt to equity ratio.

OCVFrgeXaa	1.  You are about spot on with the mortgage repayments.  Not taking into account any fees being added to the mortgage, an ￡84k repayment mortgage over 15 years with a 3 year fix of 4.49% will cost you about ￡642 each month.  'free palestine' is slightly off the mark with the mortgage repayments, but what do you expect from a Compliance Supervisor!  Joke!<br>  <br>  2.  'free palestine's' description is pretty good.  Forget about the fixed rate for the time-being, when you take out a repayment mortgage, regardless of the term, you will pay some capital in the early years, but mainly interest.  The further down the line you are, more of your monthly payment repays capital and less interest.  The fixed rate simply sets your repayment.  The proportion of interest and capital is the same whether you have a fixed rate, discount or tracker rate.<br>  <br>  3.  I would expect in the first year, that you would repay about about ￡335 each month in capital, ￡350 in year 2, ￡405 in year 3 and so on at the same rate.  By the end of your fixed rate you should have paid off about ￡13k.  You can find out for certain by looking at the payment schedule at the back of the Key Facts Illustration that your advisor or lender will give you.<br>  <br>  Regards.|`|w3rnnH3zaa	a fair few questions here eh your certainly investing your 5 points wisely.<br>  <br>  Right i'll do my best to answer as many as possible.  The bad news 1st, although I did know how to work out how much capital and how much interest you will be paying since i have moved to a more supervisory position I have forgottten, so thats 1 question down.<br>  <br>  I work out your payments for the 1st 3 years to be closer to ￡750. After that you will move onto the lenders SVR which noone can predict at this stage.  If we have a stronger economy at that point your payments will likely go up, if the economy is still in shambles you will save a packet (as a generalisation)<br>  <br>  You are correct that when you take out a mortgage that at the start of a mortgage you pay more interest than capital, think of it as a "hump" shape.  when you start a mortgage you are at the peak of the hump, the curve stays fairly level for a little while before it starts going down. this represents the amount of interest you are paying. each time you remortgage you just continue that curve although if you factor in reservation fees etc there might be a slight "step" in that curve.<br>  <br>  Apologies I couldnt give a far mor difinitive our precise answer however hope that gives ou a general overview of the info you required

AA10464818	I doubt if you can find a legitimate survey company that allows 13 year olds<br>  <br>  The rule, as always, is to stay away from those that ask you to pay before you can get these surveys. <br>  <br>  Legitimate market survey companies such as Pinecone Research recruit members based on demographic characteristics -- e.g. mothers of babies 0-12 years old -- and will send surveys of products and services targeting this demographic group. Pinecone Research, however, pays only $5 per survey -- you're definitely not going to be rich with that.

AA10426969	Hi, I am a housing counselor in Greensboro North Carolina, which means that I run into these situations all the time.<br>  <br>  Here's what I can tell you:<br>  - Rules on giving notice change from state to state, look online or call up your local "legal aid" to find out how much the state specifies for your area.<br>  - Across the country state law trumps your apartment complexs' lease. That's to say: if the state says you need to give 30 days, but your lease says 60 days, then you only have to give 30 days.<br>  - In NC only 30 days is needed.<br>  - You didn't even give 30 days notice, which could be a problem. See if they will accept 5 days rent in April, so that you will have given 30 days notice, plus if you do that you'll have a couple days extra to move which is always nice.<br>  -The worst thing they can really do is take your security deposit.<br>  - They can also try taking you to court, but the judge will most likely just rule that they can have your security deposit, especially if you have vacated 30 days before April starts.<br>  <br>  -Seriously though, call your legal aid.|`|AA10747002	Sure, you can leave at the end of the month but have to pay for the extra month. I doubt there is much you can do about this.

Leave at the end of the month but pay the extra month.|`|QJQ6fmxpaa	YES THEY KINDA CAN........YOU MIGHT HAVE TO TAKE THEM TO SMALL CLAIMS COURT IF YOUR MONEY IS NOT GIVING BACK.....BUT I WOULDN'T PAY APRILS RENT!.IF ANYTHING LET THAT WASH OUT FROM YOUR DEPOSIT.....OTHER THAN THAT YOUR OK!|`|kOoCya9Oaa	Take the new letter to the manager,it was probably just a screw-up.|`|wzMhhJi9aa	you should talk to them about that notice. it could be a mistake|`|CfPQwq3Qaa	Double-check your lease.  You should have been given a copy.  If it does say that you need to give 60 days notice, then that is what you have to do and they can hold you to it legally.  They don't have to, but they can.<br>  <br>  Something else that you can do is actively find someone who wants your apartment.  If you are tied to being in the apartment for another month, you can have the new tenents sublease it from you for that one month.  That way you don't have to pay for that month you were not expecting.  Their official lease would then start the following month.<br>  <br>  But your best bet is to ask your manager.  Explain what happened and ask him/her what is up with it?  It could be that it was a detail the manager overlooked, or it might be routine to allow you to do everything you have done without penalty because the manager knew what was going on.  <br>  <br>  I have been in the same position on both counts.  I wish you luck and hope this helps.

MMeHdlu2aa	Unfortunately, the answer is no... nothing is certain on a short sale until the sellers' lender has agreed to accept the amount you are paying for the house, even though the seller owes more.<br>  In this situation, the seller has to "qualify" for the short sale, their lender or lenders needs to review their tax returns, income and other assets to determine if they can afford to pay what they owe- if not, they may refuse the short sale.<br>  Also, they need to approve the amount you are paying... they have received broker price opinions and appraisals and have an idea of the value, if your offer isn't in the ballpark, they would refuse the short sale in favor of taking the house back in a foreclosure to get more money.<br>  The reality is, many banks have refused short sales and by the time they take the house back in foreclosure and offer it on the market, they get way less than the short sale offer they refused. There is no rhyme or reason with short sale lenders and many times one department is not communicating with other departments and it can take weeks to months to get an answer.<br>  Hopefully your agent prepared you for the delays that short sale transactions are famous for, and you are patient enough to wait if you really like the house, but be prepared in case it isn't approved.<br>  A lot depends on the skill of the listing agent and how advanced the short sale package was developed before the offer was sent in...<br>  Good luck!|`|38c303a5bdc786d68c71014c678b49faaa	Not yet it doesnt.

Many LPNs measure and record patients’ vital signs such as height, weight, temperature, blood pressure, pulse, and respiration. They also prepare and give injections and enemas, monitor catheters, dress wounds, and give alcohol rubs and massages. To help keep patients comfortable, they assist with bathing, dressing, and personal hygiene, moving in bed, standing, and walking. They might also feed patients who need help eating. Experienced LPNs may supervise nursing assistants and aides.<br>  <br>  The duties of medical assistants vary from office to office, depending on the location and size of the practice and the practitioner’s specialty. In small practices, medical assistants usually do many different kinds of tasks, handling both administrative and clinical duties and reporting directly to an office manager, physician, or other health practitioner. Those in large practices tend to specialize in a particular area, under the supervision of department administrators.<br>  <br>  Medical assistants who perform administrative tasks have many duties. They update and file patients’ medical records, fill out insurance forms, and arrange for hospital admissions and laboratory services. They also perform tasks less specific to medical settings, such as answering telephones, greeting patients, handling correspondence, scheduling appointments, and handling billing and bookkeeping<br>  <br>  One of the chief differences is that length of schooling required. LPN/LVNs have some job mobility, where as Medical Assistants tend to be stuck doing that work until they acquire more training or leave the field entirely and do more straight foward administrative work.|`|cMsC5a14aa	About 30k a year
Saul1Bhuaa	Not the same, really -- 1099-MISC is what Turbo Tax is asking you to attach.|`|MmTe8W8uaa	There is no form whose full name is "form 1099".  There are several different forms with 1099 in their names, for example:<br>  Form 1099–B, Proceeds From Broker and Barter Exchange Transactions<br>  Form 1099–DIV, Dividends and Distributions<br>  Form 1099–INT, Interest Income<br>  Form 1099–MISC, Miscellaneous Income<br>  Form 1099–OID, Original Issue Discount<br>  Form 1099–R, Distributions from Pensions, Annuities, Retirement or Profit-Sharing Plans, IRAs, Insurance Contracts, etc.<br>  Form SSA–1099, Social Security Benefit Statement<br>  <br>  Except for 1099-INT, none of these are for interest.  <br>  <br>  Generally, you should attach whichever any forms that have names that BEGIN WITH "Form 1099" AND show federal tax withheld, except that you do not have to attach a 1099-G that show federal tax withheld from unemployment compensation.  Generally, you do not need to attach any form with a name that begins with "Form 1099" and does NOT show any tax withheld.|`|Daq9gituaa	Form 1099 by itself is generic as there are several different types of form 1099. Yours is 1099-INT.

You do this to get credit for the money withheld.<br>  <br>  It's rare for a 1099-INT to have withholding on it.  It's not impossible, just rare.|`|AA10469473	There are many different 1099 forms, for many different purposes.  1099-int is one, for interest paid.

KTNqah9eaa	It depends on the law that applies wherever the mobile home is. However normally if the mobile home is not built into the land and still moveable, it is not treated in the same way as the land. That means you should be able to sell and build.|`|AA11932637	We are shopping for a mobile home.  Where are you located?

ckxpknr0aa	I would stop your rent payments, put the money to one side so you can pay it when asked for. Other than that I would do nothing until you hear otherwise. Of course depending on what he's been put away for, his bank account may have been frozen anyway. I'm sure either his family or solicitor will be in touch, in the meantime you might get a bit of free rent!!!!<br>  <br>  Just seen your additional details - and I stand by doing and saying absolutely nothing. Just be prepared to have to move as he may have to sell the house to pay the stolen funds back....|`|mmMgfhf2aa	I would keep putting your rent into another account (if you don't pay directly into his account) so he doesn't give you notice on the grounds of non payment. That way you have the money ready if it's asked for. If you don't pay your rent and his house is re-possessed you'll be evicted a lot quicker by the bank than by him. I'd try to keep to your agreement with your landlord as much as you can.|`|N38pJIt9aa	Your contract should have his "notice serving" address on it.<br>  <br>  If you have his account number, pay in the rent when its due. In the meantime, it might make sense for you to start looking for somewhere else to rent. If you are afraid of a repeat eviction.<br>  <br>  Its impossible to say if he still has a mortgage on the property. One also can't tell what effect his being in prison might have on his mortgage payments (if he has a mortgage) and if there is a risk of a banks repossession.<br>  <br>  Don't panic!|`|e9f68812f71cca804ea0d7931ce5e819aa	Stop paying the rent, use the money to start searching for a new place to rent asap!<br>  <br>  Hows he going to pay his mortgage when he's in the nick? You might be alright for a few months, but odds are you'll be evicted sooner or later|`|eACZ1Rhjaa	Find out if you can who the lender is. Try to buy the house cheap.|`|U3jZFawtaa	Yikes! Well one out of three I agree with ...but before you make one more payment first do some research. Is the contract between you and his name only? (madoff LLC or madoff and dewey cheatem,etc). If it is his name only (and it is definately him that went to jail not someone with his name) and he has wealth he most likely has a trustee that will be handling his investments while living with bubba.<br>  <br>  So, 1. is he the right guy FOR SURE! 2. Talk to a lawyer to make sure everything can continue as agreed. The attorney can get records to see if the mortgage payment is more than the rent and if so will the difference still be paid and get a legal "certification" that payments to the bank will continue or sufficient notice will be given to you. 3. Dont fall for someone contacting you saying they will be "handling" things while he is singing "blue moon."<br>  <br>  Attorney will cost a little dough but it beats paying a months rent one month and then someone showing up ready to kick you out. Yeah yeah you can do the squatter thing and some other moves but that has stress and daily uncertainty in it. This will have you sleeping better at night. Verify its him then call a lawyer. Good Luck|`|49740c9daeea677fc86801fb2b3f41deaa	You should hear from a property manager soon.   If you have his mailing address just mail his rent to that address.<br>  <br>  His rights to collect rent from his property is not effected by his address.<br>  <br>  The house may indeed be seized, but you would be given notice to move, they will not just take the house out of the blue.|`|AA11215123	Set the rent aside into an escrow account and notify the landlord of what you are doing.

Anything could happen....if the landlord owes a mortgage and doesn't pay it he could lose the house. Or, if drugs are involved, the state could take the house. Call a landlord-tenant lawyer..the first consultation is free. He will advise you as to what to do. Make sure the bank titles the escrow account for rental purposes.|`|ezT7xruoaa	I'm jealous, my landlord belongs in prison too!!! hes an ***. <br>  <br>  Don't panic, you got your contract right? so stay and keep paying your rent through bank transfer, no one can kick you out.|`|pemGyfnwaa	That doesn't affect you at all!

Saul1Bhuaa	You can always have them send the claim form in again with the correct information.  (Or do it yourself.)|`|9FxR4khCaa	I don't really know what you mean by the "right" info, but if it was wrong, have them amend the claim and resubmit it.<br>  <br>  Bottom line, you received the services, you must pay them.|`|FGX5R5weaa	Depends, first of all are the contracted with your insurance company? If so part of that contract may state they have certain obligations they have to meet, if not a claim may be considered provider liability (they have to eat the cost). I would suggest having the Chiro office call your insurance company and let them straighten it out. <br>  <br>  If they are not contracted with your insurance company, they can charge you for whatever they want and are not obligated to submit claims on your behalf.|`|9PtZ8nvdaa	Was it submitted to health insurance or as part of a liability claim settlement?
RDgyb7W8aa	Most likely you got sued within the seven year time frame.  Only way to stop the garnishment is to file bankruptcy or make some arrangement with the creditor.|`|7QPv7ta7aa	If they have already attached your bank account, the creditor has a judgment against you.  Judgments are good for a long time and can be renewed.  They will continue to come after any bank account or garnish your wages until the judgment is paid.<br>  <br>  You can contact the owner of the judgment and try to work out payment plan for the balance.  They probably won't settle for small payments stretched out over a long time.|`|bb2cafcc1198c3f1dea9c78f472dc7e9aa	you can't stop garnishments you did not make.
c5xiQ5gMaa	It depends on your credit..If you have decent credit, then go ahead and go to a bank and get a $6000 loan, do what you said and pay off all your debts with that loan and just have that loan to pay off. If you have poor credit, it will be extremely impossible to get a loan for that amount, you will need a co-signer or put up collateral (house or car) to get approved for a loan.
4RjM5lElaa	Yes, went to college.  Original plan for career (law) is not where I ended up (and this was after I interned for three years!)  It seems the more exposure I got to the law and all who work in it the more I felt this was not for me so I stepped back and started looking elsewhere for a career.<br>  <br>  I like what I do (hire, fire, train...) and many things I learned from studying law have made me successful - I need to 'know' people - to know what their motivator is, to know if they are a match for the job I need done, to know if they are telling the truth.  I get clues from everyone I talk to by little signs that are given - attention to detail from studying law helped me develop that.  There is also tons of reading I need to do so I was already 'trained' on how to endure that.  Procedures and policies that must be written - again, attention to detail. And I have to make certain I am (as well as all of my colleagues and company) are following laws so we stay out of legal trouble.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps|`|QXQWDw1qaa	Hard question to answer.  I happen to have a degree in music and I have been a professional musician for over 50 years.. but I was already pretty successful as a musician before I ever started College.. (although my Father though I was a failure because I wanted to play music instead of being a business executive).<br>  <br>  Actually, the main reason I went for the music Degree was, it was the only one where I could show up for class strung out with a hangover and be just like everyone else in the class.

ltXxNfwRaa	You can definitely buy a phone off of ebay and have a plan separately...<br>  <br>          But...<br>  <br>  ... You should be checking the model of the phone and compare it with the service provider you want to have.  Some of those phones from ebay cant be used in the US or Canada, and if they can, they may not be compatible with all service providers.<br>  <br>  Get the model number and call the service provider you want to use... ask them if that phone can be used on their network.  Its the easiest way to avoid spending money on something that you may not be able to use!<br>  <br>  And if you buy a phone from ebay, you wont be charged AGAIN from the service provider... thats call highway robbery!  You'd just be charged the activation fees and service plan costs!<br>  <br>  Have fun!|`|RYtwD5NVaa	Well, if you but it with no service plan or anything, then you can go up to verison or t-mobile or whatever and get it activated. If it has a plan, and not the one you want, you can always change it, though it may be a little costly :P
bankzwwYaa	You've answered your own question...<br>  <br>  Until you make time to get a JOB.. you wont have MONEY....its REALLY that simple...|`|5p7cQAokaa	eBay is a beautiful, beautiful thing.  Never say, "I can't sell this, who's going to want THIS??"  Because I'm telling you, you will find the weirdest things on eBay and someone always buys it!<br>  <br>  Also, you do not have school on the weekends. Work the weekends!  Work after school.  I'm assuming you're in highschool, so I'm guessing you get out around 3 (give or take) which puts you home at 5.  So work nights.  Everyone and their mother has been through highschool and most people had an extra-curricular activity.  And they made it happen, so can you.<br>  <br>  Work at Panera.  You can go right when you get home.  You get 50% off all your food if you're working that day.  So think about it, you get there around 5:15ish, grab something to eat (50% off) then work your shift until close. Bring home a sandwich with you after work.  That way, you are making money, and you really aren't LOSING much because your food is next to nothing.<br>  <br>  I worked there all through highschool. It can be a little hard but it gets easier as you go. The discount REALLY really helps, and they typically will hire you above minumum wage.<br>  <br>  Can't do that? Talk to your career counselor.  Maybe there's something you can do AT SCHOOL.  My old principal hired students to do work around the school (gardening, weeding, etc.)|`|Ekg4H6HQaa	The only way to make money is to work. If you "can't", your only option is to sell some of your stuff. You can do the paper route. Don't say you don't have time. If you have no time, you have to make it. Otherwise you won't be getting a job anytime soon.

This varies from state to state.  Check with your states DMV or equivalent agency.|`|Daq9gituaa	That will depend upon the state you live in. In my state, as long as the owner retains title to the car, he is responsible for any personal property taxes.

That is weird. <br>  Anyways, yeah, if someone picks that up they have your info to make purchases via phone, or online.<br>  Online might be a bit trickier because sometimes you need to fill out your address...and if they don't figure out your billing address for your debit card they cannot buy something online.

ygbVWNTXaa	One thing for certain, worry will not change a thing. Speaking truth is always the best decision, maybe not particlarly changing the end results, but how it effects your self evaluation, something you cannot hide from, your conscious. Be honest, state the incident as it happened, offer your observation of the gentlemans conditionafter what could be defined as "bumped" into. Insurance companies don't want to pain that claim either, their on your side.The other question, ask your insurance rep, they will give an honest answer . blessings|`|AA11635143	You should have call the police and had them file a report; it would be a great help at this time.  Visit your insurance agent and explain exactly what happened and let them handle it.  Whiplash injuries to the neck and back are difficult to prove or disprove but......it can be done.  Get the taxi driver's address, take a camcorder, and park so you can see what he does when he isn't working.  If he is working, that's a good sign he isn't injured, so make pictures of that also.  If he plays golf, washes the car, mows the lawn, lifts a child, carries bags of groceries, jogs, or anything to arouse your suspicion, record it.  You can do the same with a camera phone.<br>  <br>  Your insurance carrier should assist you in paying your claim up to the amount you are insured for.<br>  <br>  I wish you all the best.

I would agree that following your gut is wise advice. Look for something you are passionate about. 200,000 may seem like alot but it can go very quickly. I know of a business that you may be interested in. It requires approx. 25k US but can be worked in the UK. It has a system in place so it can be easliy started although it does require work.

mx0T8RGXaa	The honest answer is no one really knows.  There is nothing that can predict the future.  The best idea would be to find someone who can analyze the trend of the US currency at this point and compare it later on.<br>  <br>  Right now the US dollar is stronger than it was because many all over the world are retreating from risky investments and keeping their money in "safe haven" currencies.  The US dollar and the Yen are the two major winners on that front.  <br>  <br>  What this has produced is a trend that appears to be stretching into the long term, of a rise in value for the US dollar.  As with all trends there are dips and valleys along the way and how long the trend will last is anyone's guess.  <br>  <br>  What this means to you is that there is a risk not matter what you do.  If you decide the price right now is OK then you can convert now with the idea that if the current trend continues you will have gotten in at a bargin...or you can wait and see if the US dollar dips a bit and try to "time" your convsersion.<br>  <br>  What this really maans:  There is no way to truly give you a yes or no answer and if you are really serious about finding the best value consulting an "expert" may be the best option.  Or you can just convert you cash when you are ready and know that the price is the price and just live your life and have fun when you visit us here.  <br>  <br>  I do hope you will enjoy your stay in the US and please know that the majority of us Americans are nice people, once you get through the gruff exterior.<br>  <br>  Best wishes|`|7qIflaLLaa	It may.

9bf0e103f2efa931acc3e4703e8fdb02aa	A Credit Card is normally an unsecured credit given by  bank to you, meaning the bank has not created any security interest (like mortgage, collateral etc)  should you fail to pay up their dues.<br>  <br>  Anyways, the bank can take the following actions;<br>  <br>  1) Report your name to the Credit Bureau of India Ltd (CIBIL) which maintains a list of defaulters. This ensures that you do not get another credit card or loan from other banks in the future. It also damages your credit rating for future credit.<br>  <br>  2) File a civil suit for recovering its dues from you. This is made in the local civil court. These cases go on for several years, and the outcome could be that the court orders you to pay up the dues in which case you will now be legally bound to pay up.<br>  <br>  3) If you have any assets with the bank whose credit card you hold, it may attach those assets as lien to recover its dues.<br>  <br>  4) Some banks could also file criminal charges on you under section 406/420 cheating of IPC. This is normally done to initimidate you to settle your dues with the bank.<br>  <br>  But in any case if you're insolvent, you may simply tell the bank the same and prove it too, and it wont be able to do anything thereafter.|`|5BTKscZraa	One of two things: They will sell it to a collection agency, which will try to annoy/scare/harass you into paying...or they will serve you a summons and take you to court to try to win a judgment against you.

They generally do not want to do this because it is expensive for them and they are often willing to work out an agreement such as waiving past interest and late charges on the account. But yes, they can sue and garnish your wages, put liens on your property, etc. <br>  |`|YzBVbvyWaa	Depends on where you are. I can only tell you from Australian point of view. After a few defaults they will eventually close your account but you will still have to pay this off eventually. Unless you declare bankruptcy of course (but things brings you a raft of other problems so wouldn't advise unless really necessary).<br>  <br>  Even if you eventually pay this off you will not be able to get another credit card with that bank for a few years.<br>  <br>  A couple of years ago I defaulted on an Aussie mastercard and just recently tried to get an ANZ visa and they refused because they were the underwriters of the Aussie. Even though my financial circumstances are much better now. So just be aware that the credit card may be linked with other banks.|`|P6AWsK6maa	It depends on how much is owed. If the amount is worth the companies time then they can (and will) take you to court, garnish your wages, put liens on your property and levy your bank accounts. <br>  <br>  If the amount is small or you are "judgment proof" then being put in collections and being harassed for the next 25 years (just joking usually only 7) looks like your future. |`|AA10065077	My bank actually took the money out of my account.

Even though you paid the loan off you still owe this other $ amount and if you don't get it taken care of you could face more charges.  I  imagine you signed some papers and if you did you're stuck.

Their scare tactics are meant to get you to pay.  You have the right to tell them not to contact you at work. Send a letter in writing, certified mail, telling them that you want in writing what is owed.  Keep a paper trail going, document phonecalls.  There are laws in place about harrassment at work or at home before a certain hour.|`|UcF86tBOaa	This web site seems to have reasonable advice....|`|cTsb7vFjaa	Your wages cannot be garnished without a court judgement.  They are trying to embarrass you so you pay the bill.  Usually pay day companies have something written in their contracts that if you don't pay on time that you owe extra, so they are probably after that difference.  I would go into the payday place and ask what the amount is for.  If it's legitimate (i.e. on your original paperwork) then you should pay the money.  <br>  <br>  If the business contacting you has a contract with you, then it is a civil matter, not legal, so it doesn't matter if you can't find information on them.  The payday company probably employs the company to recoup their bad debts.|`|AA10065077	You will be getting a form to sign. Along with it you are going to get a disclose form.

TEFfCt3Saa	There is an assumption that all mortgage bankers are like the banker in the wheel chair in the classic movie " It's A Wonderful Life" The true fact is that they don't wat your property they want the money and if you talk to them now they they just may be able to come up with a plan for you to save your mortgage. I take a lot of paperwork to foreclose on a loan. It takes a lot less to formulate a plan to save.<br>  <br>   I was forced into my second bankruptcy a few years ago we hand tried to work with the loan officer who refused to talk to us. We got foreclosure we went to our attorney who recommend chapter 13. However he threatened chapter 11 to the banks attorney. After the shock wore off my attorney told him they were going with Chapter 13 . <br>  <br>  The banks attorney decided that they had act prematurely in filling foreclosure action. The President of the bank decided that the loan officer had jump the gun as well and his refusal to talk to us had caused the whole problem he was fired with in a few minutes of the meeting between the  Banks attorney and the president of the bank. We got a new loan officer. We reaffirmed on the property started accelerating the loan.  We paid it off. The loan early. <br>  <br>  Last year I needed a newer car. We went to the car dealer and found a car we talked to our banker and then the salesman talked to the banker. He ask how long would it be for approval? The salesman got the strangest  look on his face. Then he said goodby. Then the salesman said they approved the loan. Our banker told him this about us "they day what they do and do what they say" .<br>  <br>  I just got a 73,000.00 mortgage a few months ago. Incidently did I way I am 64 years old and I am drawing early social security and not working because of a work related injury. I am also retired airforce so I also draw about 1300. retired pay. And if I can do it so can you "Say what you do and do what you say" This means more than a three didget credit score.|`|AMerE42Taa	I'm pretty sure I'm gonna go through a foreclosure with my home.

7628c38bd2b4ddbbe04c4cce50a9edf2aa	I'm sorry for the two of you. When I worked in the business world, I ran into these sorts of things myself. It's unfortunate, but sometimes we get "screwed!"<br>  <br>  And you are right, as an at-will employee, you can be let go provided it's a legal reason. In other words, you can't be fired on the basis of discrimination.<br>  <br>  But stealing is a perfectly legal and legitimate reason for firing you. And the one who fired you said she saw you do it. So it's your word against hers. Now unless somebody else was there or there was a camera, there's not much you can do but live with the decision.<br>  <br>  As I say in my book, many people get fired. And yes, it will hurt your chances, but it's not an automatic killer! In other words, it could make your job search longer, but it may not necessarily prevent you from being hired someplace else.<br>  <br>  My suggestion is to put down that you were terminated. Since you found another job, you can show that another employer hired you even after this one fired you. So as a prospective employer, I'll see another company took you on, so perhaps I should too.<br>  <br>  In other words, your having found another job afterwords makes me more willing to consider hiring you. But a lot of it will depend upon what your current employer has to say. If they have a problem with you, then I'll see 2 bad situations and that hurts you. But if this one says nice things, then I'll look more favorably upon you.<br>  <br>  And you are 100% correct, never badmouth!!|`|AA10065077	Since the HR lady is no longer there then no your new potential job will probobly not know.

It could end up on a forged document that can be used against you. Simply type your full name.<br>  <br>  When they call back, tell them: I have sent a certified letter to your office officially requesting written validation of this alleged debt per my rights under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act.<br>  <br>  Per this federal law they must provide written validation within 30 days and they must cease collection activity until they send you written validation.

Your better off spending 40-50K on a regular stick built home.  With the interest rate differences your payments would be about the same if you include what you'll pay in lot rent or a loan on property to put the home on. And while manufactured homes decrease in property value, regular homes will appreciate in value.

Some legitimate reasons would be that you have a new job that is far away and continued living there is unrealistic,  you are in the military and are being transferred or mobilized for deployment,  physical limitations make it impossible for you to live there, criminal activity makes it unsafe to live there, etc.  <br>  <br>  Though some leases require the remaining balance of the lease to be paid.  So if you move out nine months into a one year lease up you might be on the hook for the remaining three months.  Check on that. <br>  <br>  Landlords right now are not in a position to pick and chose who their tenants are.  So you have some leverage here.

4MypYVHYaa	Normally the period is between 2-3 years things might be a little tough now as credit requirements have stiffen since the mortgage collapse. <br>  <br>  In order to find out the type of loan programs you are qualified for you will have to fill out a loan application, with a mortgage broker, which you can find one in your local telephone book. <br>  <br>  Make sure this mortgage broker or mortgage banker is able to do government loans such as FHA and VA loans if you qualify for one.<br>  <br>  He will fill out this application, which takes awhile so grab your favorite beverage and sit down. Once you have completed the application, he will run your credit report which will have your credit scores.  These credit scores will determine your interest rate.<br>  <br>  The amount of your monthly debt payments you are required to pay as per your credit report and the amount of mortgage you can take on based on your income will determine the amount of house you will be able to purchase.<br>  <br>  When you speak with the mortgage broker you will need the following documents to complete the loan application, there will be others, but this will get you started.<br>  <br>  #1 One month of pay stubs for each person that will be on the mortgage.<br>  <br>  #2 Six months  bank statements from each bank in which you bank as well as statements from any 401K from you place of employment.<br>  <br>  #3 Two years of federal income tax along with the W-2 that match.<br>  <br>  Once he has all that he need to do he can then issue you a pre-approval letter so you can purchase a home. In this pre-approval letter will be the amount of house you are qualified to purchased. <br>  <br>  Once he gives you this pre-approval you may now find a real estate agent to find yourself a home or he might have a referral.<br>  <br>  Now make sure before you get your pre-approval you and your mortgage broker go over all your options as to the mortgage programs you qualify for, the interest rate, monthly payments. <br>  <br>  If you are getting a FHA, fixed rate, two loans to eliminate PMI like an 80/20 or one loan, if you are qualified for and approved for a 100% loan.<br>  <br>  You should select the loan that best suit your financial condition at the time. That could be an adjustable rate loan. It could be a fixed rate loan for 5 or 10 years and then adjust. Some adjustable rate mortgages only adjust once.<br>  <br>  Make sure your mortgage broker explain all your options so you may make an intelligent decision.<br>  <br>  What might be good for one person might not be good for you, in other words just because your friends and all your real estate buddies are telling you about the great fixed rate they got, your financial situation might call for something else.<br>  <br>  So select the best option for you and your financial situation.<br>   <br>  You should also get a Good  Faith Estimate (GFE) which will indicate the cost you will have to pay for getting this loan. It will also indicate the amount of your down payment.<br>   <br>  Once you have found a home the real estate agent will then prepare a contract for you and the seller to sign.<br>  <br>  Your mortgage broker will now order an appraisal to show proof of  the property value.<br>  <br>  The mortgage broker might ask for additional information or documentation, don't get all up tight this is normal, just supply the information or find the documents needed.<br>  <br>  After the appraisal has been completed you will be called by your mortgage broker to sign your loan docs so you can take possession of your new home.<br>  <br>  Before signing any loan docs make sure they say exactly what you and your mortgage broker went over when you decided on what mortgage program was best for you.<br>  <br>  I hope this has been of some use to you, good luck<br>  <br>  "FIGHT ON"|`|tCIUbIlSaa	buy a home that went into foreclosure.

xd7tSmQeaa	Credit Unions generally are a little more friendly than banks when it comes to loans.  <br>  <br>  What I would do is go into your credit union and talk to a loan officer.  Sit down with him or her and go through your credit history to see what, if anything, can be done.<br>  <br>  Going from one car dealership to another and having your credit run a zillion times is not the way to go.<br>  <br>  When buying a car it is best to have the financing in place first then go shopping.  Since you have a car in mind, go to Edmunds.com and see how much this car REALLY costs and what you can get it for.  There is also a web site that has an Excel spread sheet you can use to figure out your payments, get rebates, etc etc.<br>  <br>  I hate car dealerships and I want to see people get a good deal.  With dealerships folding left and right and auto companies in the crapper, buyers have all the cards in this one.  <br>  <br>  Just for fun  I will do the leg work and see what you can get a 2008 Impala for.  Then I will email you the results and links to the sites I got the info from.  <br>  <br>  That cool?<br>  <br>  Edit:  Ok since you don't allow email here is what I came up with.  Edmunds has the 2008 Impala LT with the 3.5 liter V6 listed for $21,549.00.  If you throw in the $3250.00 in rebates this car goes for $18,299.00.  Not bad really.  <br>  <br>  Never finance a car for longer than 4 years and never negotiate payments.  ALWAYS negotiate price.  And don't let a dealership run your credit without first having a deal in place.  And certainly don't let them run your credit if you pay cash.  Remember, YOU are in control and if something seems fishy, leave!  If you spend more than an hour in a dealership, leave!  There is no excuse to sit there all damn day.  <br>  <br>  Knowledge is power. <br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  Edit again:  Please folks, completely ignore the idiot below me.

Its hard to believe that someone with such a low amount owing doesnt have a higher FICO.  If your payment history is poor, then you need to step it up and make at least the min payments on time, every time to bring your score up.  If your payment history is good, then your idea of paying the debt off in 1-3 months is fantastic!  <br>  <br>  Two; Credit checks are also a big factor in your score.  The more credit checks you have, the lower your score gets.<br>  <br>  In short, pay in chunks on time... carrying a balance can be a good thing as long as youre not late.  Avoid credit checks in the next 3 months and I'm sure the next time you take a look at things, you'll notice a difference!

H8gsDRWeaa	In brainstorming, a problem is presented to a group of people who then proceed to offer whatever they can think of, regardless of quality and with as few inhibitions as can be managed. Theoretically these unrestricted suggestions increase the probability that at least some superior solutions will emerge. Nevertheless, studies show that when individuals work alone under similar conditions, performance tends to proceed more efficiently than it does in groups.<br>  <br>  Under special circumstances, however, a group may solve problems more effectively than does a reasonably competent individual. Group members may contribute different (and essential) resources to a solution that no individual can readily achieve alone; such pooling of information and skills can make group achievements superior in dealing with selected problems. Sometimes social demands may require group agreement on a single alternative, as in formulating national economic or military policies under democratic governments. When only one among several alternative solutions is correct, even if a group requires more time, it has a higher probability of identifying the right one than does an individual alone.<br>  <br>  One difference between problem solving by a group and by an individual is the relative importance of covert or vicarious processes. The group depends heavily on verbal communication, while the individual, in considerable degree, attacks the problem through implicit, subjective, silent activity.|`|8eCyY7RCaa	I would have to say that writing is a good exercise for your brain, so just do it!|`|Saul1Bhuaa	When you use your brains.

eACZ1Rhjaa	Beaverton OR is the closest one. Or maybe Wilsonville is closer I know where Wilsonville is just south of Portland but don't know where Beaverton is I think farther south.
YlDHcOEbaa	Generally no. There are labor laws in place for minors that would prevent such a thing, especially ones who are actually still in school. Businesses would be hesitant about doing it anyways, considering that you'll be going back to school, that means they will wind up losing an employee and having to hire someone all over again.

7b273a170e665a98a68fec3b0465485baa	i just started a small business, i am no expert but i will tell you what i did, i contacted the state of delaware ( secretary of state office ) and they have listings on their website of registered agents that you can contact and they will get the articles of incorporation, letter of good standing, and even your tax id number for you.  those things you will need to start a business checking account as well as the business itself, for me i did a LLC "s" corp, the reason this is important is because if someone were to sue you they could only come after the company and not you personally unless you were engaged in some sort of fraud, thats why only a sole propeitorship in my opinion is not a good idea, the reason i started my company in the state of delaware is because they have very business friendly laws, their laws protect businesses from people who like to sue companies for a living, and i do not live in the state of delaware, the total amount it cost me to get started is as follows  $ 450.00 covered the tax id number, articles of incorpation, and letter of good standing/ $ 250.00 per year for umbrella insurance policy/ $200.00 various others. hope this helps and good luck to you...|`|Saul1Bhuaa	By means of a sole proprietorship.

A snow Ski shop in Phoenix, AZ would more likely not be successful. Next, once you found a suitable location hire a local business attorney to advise you whether to incorporate or be a sole proprietor. If you plan to do business in one state and incorporate in another many states make it quite difficult, often certain type businesses are not allowed to incorporate in outside states. (example: California does not allow Corporations registered in other states to operate Cosmetology businesses, the Corporations must be registered in CA)   You may also use the same attorney to handle the license and permit paperwork for you. Make sure you have sufficient operating capital saved, as usually it will take a business a while to get going. If you intend to purchase an existing business, I suggest you find the real reason the owner is selling the business. perhaps the city officials do not want that type of business in that location. Perhaps the business has flopped, If they try to tell you how much the business has been profiting, ask to see the financial records. Another thing to check is the city planning department, see if there is a tentative zoning change, or redevelopment plan scheduled perhaps the environmental or health departments are requiring a substantial building/property modification.<br>  <br>  And always remember, check the qualifications of people offering suggestions, an attorney that you paid a retainer fee is more likely to give better advise than some internet know it all!|`|Thd7Vczfaa	Dont bother it will just fail.
