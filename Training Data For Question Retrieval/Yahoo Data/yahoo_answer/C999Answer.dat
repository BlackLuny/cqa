ORKQ572Laa	simple .......... he doesn't wrestle much<br>  <br>  """""""|`|XEGBUFwAaa	Why do you keep "sweating" Cena? Most of your questions today have been about only him.|`|63ce14dc7c788e16d783f90000ca7bc5aa	Maybe he does, its just that people unlike you dont care.|`|Ku8Q3Rt3aa	He has a moose face. Moose don't sweat much.|`|2mjJzDHkaa	First off its kind of wierd that your watching to see if Cena sweats, second its all framed and practiced so It doesnt take much energy to do something that you've practiced at least 5 times. And the other wrestlers such as HHH put baby oil on which gives them that slick wet look|`|gVo6q6cWaa	its all a show, he doesnt break a sweat thats why he doesnt sweat. the others put vaseline on.|`|94oVeYAqaa	Someone's obsessed with Cena......|`|CTf87xZjaa	He might have an underactive thyroid gland so he might not sweat as much..|`|lHDNdsOaaa	He's a real good wrestler he doesn't need to sweat!!!|`|H2GoIRq8aa	idk|`|bNHHxyZEaa	He is very fit, thats why.|`|SVWxrrxGaa	he may not put that oil on him do his stuff natural|`|79IZgREyaa	who worries about things like that|`|J2DfiV6zaa	your gay|`|dK2Y2sVWaa	doesnt wrestle much..|`|UWJinEbIaa	<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igutGrdCBgM" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igutGrdCB...</a><br>  word to your mother|`|eb26214e2847efefb3455944d849b224aa	becasue he does nothing in the ring to make him sweat...
UWJinEbIaa	Right now what is important is the health of Kurt Angle.....the two sides had opposing views on what should be done so as they say "had mutual agreement to part ways".  Merchandising and televised tributes be damned.<br>  <br>  Side Note:  WWE owns all the video footage of what he did in the company so they can do anything they want with it......be it positive or negative.   Let's hope that he does not get the Warrior treatment.|`|XMS6mD5paa	If Kurt just left and not run his mouth, he may have been fine. But to put down the company that made him in pro wrestling  isn't very smart. The DVD sets were made because the wrestlers are retired.  Obviously, Kurt can still go. So if he tries to change his tone he may have a chance to get on the WWE's good side again. Something happened between Vince and Kurt for Angle to be so negative toward the WWE. What? Not sure.  He may also have a hand in bring former WWE talent to TNA. If he does he needs to stop doing that. TNA has way too much talent as it is already. Viince would love to have Kurt back. He's a very talented guy to have on the roster. All Kurt has to do is stop being so angry with Vince and the WWE.|`|sqfjfR3iaa	If WWE would let him work a light schedule and  not have to wrestler 5-days a week, he probably would have stayed. TNA lets Angle work a light schedule and they also allow him to wrestle for other promotions, something the WWE would not allow him to do. Moreover, if he ever did take time off for surgery and rehabilitation, he could fight MMA. TNA would allow him to do this, but WWE would not.|`|oWD5wvqLaa	yeah, I miss him in the WWE. Ever since he was in TNA he has gotten boring. I would like see him wrestle some of WWE's new talent and be put in the WWE hall of Fame.|`|63ce14dc7c788e16d783f90000ca7bc5aa	I agree. Now that he's in TNA, some people have forgotten about his accomplishments in the WWE.|`|HMyGNmRiaa	Yes it is, but I think somewhere down the road he will be asked to be inducted and he'll probably refuse it for awhile but then accept it one day. Hes a big part of their history and I don't see how they can possible hope to cover up his name for very long.|`|TdP2k2VGaa	i couldn't care less bacause i just hate kurt angle's guts and i am glad that WWE released him in fact they said they did it for his own personal health and i don't mind TNA fans telling himw what WWE fans ToLd HIM before kurt angle YOU SUCK|`|sGE9qz47aa	I feel that tool kurt angle was one of the best he was athletic.<br>  and a great wrestler I can't believe that he part ways with the wwe like that.|`|PggHC5zkaa	i agree with you there but its because hes in tna and why ould the wwe realese a dvd of there computition.but like lets say he gets realese or takes a break from wrestling then they would.|`|LFJSPoTuaa	yeah kurt angle will never be in the hof or get a 3 disc dvd set of his matces|`|KG24o2geaa	I couldn't agree with u more.  u forget how good and how funny angle really was until he left!!|`|r2MfXmkqaa	i think its ashame but its angle's fault. all these tna guys try to bash vince and they wwe and i think thats a damn shame. enough with everyone saying wwe is a bad promotion. the rock wants to forget about wrestling, but unlike me they show that they won't forget about him by making him a DVD and giving him some of the cut. so as far as i see ... Kurt deserves it if they don't give him a DVD. i like Kurt, one of the best ... but he totally f*cked up.
dbc3503ab379d3f8b3803c2488ab5e36aa	SD GM that won't happen because Vickie is ratings, he will return and feud with Edge for the WWE championship.

It's a horrible storyline.|`|84ceqOC4aa	hmm it sounds good when is christian suppose to come again ?:/|`|H9COS7LRaa	This would never happen.    Christian didn't do all of the accident's to Jeff Hardy anyway.    Plus, If Christian did come back to the WWE, he would team back up with Edge like he did a few years ago.    Idiots.|`|1MdaqyL2aa	no i think that christian would return as a heel. maybe helping jeff at first but totally wreck him in a tag match. leave him all battered and bloody|`|4DzPhJgKaa	They teased the return of christian a bit last week at smackdown when edge did a 5 second pose.  I think he will team up with Edge, hope he does.    I dont like the story line however TLC match between all four at wrestlemania 25 would be awesome .

Z5xgSATSaa	If the condition and fit of this bike are good, it is a fair enough price. The bike shop will be able to tell if it has been ridden very much. Age is not really all that important, this is a nice bike, very light and responsive. You might offer a bit less but if the shop says that it is in good condition, I would buy it even at this price. This bike would be more than good enough to race with.|`|LiOOF1Plaa	In this economy...flashing $600 cash will have the owner foaming at the mouth...and likely accept your offer!|`|RQzsmvfiaa	You're talking about a bike that was easily $3,000 when it was new. If it fits and everything checks out, the price is right. It's not a smokin deal but it is a fair price.|`|DOVbF4Piaa	That's a good deal but only if the bike is the correct size. You should be able to tell right away and if it fells good have the size checked by the shop just to be sure. Never buy the wrong size bike no matter how good the deal.  It won't hurt to offer less for the bike.

Victory becomes much easier when you focus on the race and reward    Always remember that for every failure, comes an opportunity to learn from it. And with every success, comes an opportunity to aim for greater heights    Champions know if they want to win, they have to be prepared to constantly change the game plan and challenge themselves and their performance. Have you changed your game plan to success?    If you doubt you can accomplish something, then you can't accomplish it. You have to have confidence in your ability, and then be tough enough to follow through.    If you believe in yourself, have dedication and pride and never quit, you'll be a winner. The price of victory is high, but so are the rewards    Teamwork is the fuel that allows common people to produce uncommon results    Volleyball is the sport through which I am able to express my God-given talents of being an athlete.

E5mFWOqqaa	I've been going to the Bud Shootout since 2002. Every year, we learn something new that we apply to the next year- so far all but one of the applications was a good thing.    The first few years we would park across the street from DIS in the Volusia Mall parking lot- and after the race camp for a few hours till traffic quieted a bit before leaving. We did that for about 2-3 years. Then we learned we could go to the infield for $50 for the vehicle- and stay Saturday/Sunday. We did that for a few years. Then last year we brought the RV and stayed at the Speedweeks Campground near the track the night before the Shootout and then drove into the track at 6am on Saturday. The campground was very primitive, but it was a nice quiet retreat. We spent the night saturday (for a nice 2 1/2 day vacation) and left about 11am on Sunday after being well-rested.    I refuse now to leave the night the Shootout ends. It's like 11pm when the race ends, even later when all the festivities are over, and it's like 4-5 hours home (depending on traffic). It's just not worth the headache when you're probably not in the best of states to drive to leave right when the race is over. Plus, the post-race concert at the Shootout is always amazing. I still relive the 3 Doors Down concert in 2005 and Staind in 2006 (even though it rained) because they were awesome.    Camping is just the way to go. Especially since NASCAR is closely associated with beer drinkers, and you likely don't need to be driving right after a race. I've not been to any other track than Daytona sadly, but I can imagine that if the Shootout (a LOT smaller than the 500) is as bad as it is, then the other races must be like a living hell.|`|OdUZRBRtaa	I go one day first its dover so its only an hour away then once I passed it on a race weekend while going to my beach house and there was this fat dude getting changed right next to the highway it was horrible its a major highway and some guy is lke oh what a perfect place to change! so I couldnt do it but my family isnt too big on NASCAR except for my grandpa and "pop pop" my dad trys to talk to me about it but he isnt very interested and I probily read it on jayskis a week ago|`|YlmpBOpjaa	Did that exact thing at Phoenix 2008! Brought our trailer and just crashed at the track!|`|mIdcJEJNaa	I did it more when I was younger, but if I didn't rent an RV, I would have to have some back up plan, especially for Speed Weeks..  I've been stuck outdoors during Speed Weeks a couple of times, once we had to go across the street to Sears, and get long johns, and gloves because it was 29 degrees, with winds gusting to 50..  The 154 proof grain alcohol flowed very freely that night.. lol  That, and a jar of tabasco peppers..    As for the Shoot Out this year, I live 235 miles south of Daytona (three hours), and the forecast down here is 32 degrees for Wednesday night, that means colder up there.. Needless to say, the summers make camping for the July race like living in a steam bath.. Even the tents have air... Michigan would be nice though..|`|P3f94TJbaa	I haven't camped at a track yet, but it seems like the best way to watch a race. Your right there surrounded by the drivers with instant access to the drivers. It just seems like it would be perfect.|`|uQhyV2Dbaa	i do at dega every spring. the party is great with booze and breast everywhere. stay in the free campground across speedway blvd, but just watch the fun police|`|NC2BfEvLaa	I have only done it at Talladega a few times and it was a lot of fun .Last time I went we drove there saw the race and drove back. I will never do that again since I live in Southeastern Louisiana !|`|m7ZtX94daa	I came, I camped, I peed oops|`|iO12Vjnvaa	None, not really into the camping thing at the track. We mainly get up early drive for hours, wait in long traffic lines for hours, wait in long restroom lines, wait in long lines for food, wait again for the restroom, then wait to get into the speedway. Hmmmm....there COULD be something to that camping thing after all. LOL!    Just an opinion as always.
NlIsXIdWaa	wear lots of layers, and gloves/mittens defiantly, wear just regular socks that you wear with your shoes and put on a long pair of socks before you put your ice skates on    see if you can find, those kind of tights that are warm I think their called long johns? and then put maybe yoga pants over them or something, that would defiantly keep you toasty without looking uncool, if you get cold try to race around the ice rink that will get you warm again|`|oMbrgIBEaa	stay away from jeans . when you fall then you'll end up with wet and cold pants sad and did i mention wet?   i suggest either yoga pants like from hollister or anything like that and wear layers. that way you can take them off when you get warm.  dont forget gloves. wear some cute shirt and youll do well.  scarf hat|`|dNn1nFhEaa	Stay away from jeans those get wet, and will stay wet    Try some cute sweats paired with a cute fleece and maybe a colorful tank top, also wear some bright colored thin gloves|`|GECGmfbdaa	Get a cute jogging suit and wear a matching tank top underneath.

For several reasons.   1. Its cheaper, at Chase field we used to get in for a $1 now who can beat that!  2. Get more autographs, never been to a basket ball or football game but I can imagine its alot harder to get autographs then it is at a baseball game but I could be wrong.  3. Baseballs, I am pretty sure they do not give out basketball and footballs like they do baseball unless you go buy it in the team shop. A cute little kid all he has to do is stand on side line at a baseball game during batting practice give in a few minutes and mostly likely he will get a ball!  4. Besides football its a all America favorite sport!  5. More games than football to go to than having wait once a week to watch your favorite team!  These reasons are plenty enough for me to make baseball my favorite sport!|`|mml9J88caa	For my school i do cross country ( even though i don't enjoy running 7 miles after school) so i hate that sport lol.

I have to give football a slight edge, because I can watch ANY football game and enjoy it... whereas in Baseball, I'm really only interested in my hometown Yankees...  if it's another team on, I cant really sit through the nine innings and be interested.    However dont think I dont love baseball too...its my "soap opera" and I watch every game, every season for the Yanks.    Boxing stands on its own as the sweet science, but as its not a "team sport" I think of it differently then the other 2. In a category by itself I guess.    I also enjoy college basketball, but am sick of the selfish style of the NBA.    I like Hockey, but more so going to actual games.. not so much on TV.    I like to play golf, but not watch it.    Ditto with Tennis, but its more watchable if its a good match.    I'll watch the olympics every two years... but not hardcore or anything.    And Soccer... I respect the atlhleticism of the sport and all, but my god...

BlgZmV6uaa	I do not feel current management will taake them furthur then what they are now.They need to quit going after guys just because they were in the WWE.Vince Ruesso needs to go.If you can not come up with a more original storeyline then the ones that you had when whenWCW was going down hill you should be out the door.Sting,Kevin Nash are just way to old to be in the ring anymore.I am surprised that some don't learn where others failed.Sting,Nash,Ruesso were all part of WCWs downfall.The only thing that they did smart with these people was get rid of Scott Hall!They should work on devloping thier own talant and look for new writers.|`|dcNT65mTaa	I would prefer not. One of the things that makes TNA what it is is the fact that its an alternative to just watching 3 WWE shows and thats before u think about the stars like samoa joe, aj styles, jay lethol etc. so I think it's fine just trying to be TNA and doesn't need the competition plus why would u try to compete with a company that's been around for 50 years and u've not made it to 10 yet?|`|uEfoR5BLaa	Maybe one day they will when TNA's more popular.|`|LSFSfNCXaa	people forget TNA is only 7 years old,its not gonna be on wwe's level but TNA needs to stop trying to outdue wwe,they just need to be themselves and deliver the good wrestling they had when they first started|`|Jy7t6grDaa	no, they would have to erase many many years of history, TNA is a bunch of hand me down superstars anyway

c73AAq22aa	well you can but the only thing you need to do, is start bodybuilding   and doing a lot of cardio and LOTS of work outs that will increase your endurance   because when your fighting you'll really need it, BIG TIME TRUST ME,  and because in kickboxing theres a lot of brute  strength    and number one rule when it comes to martial arts work hard    and youll be the best   and go by this motto when you work out OR TRAINING  WINNERS TRAIN  LOSERS COMPLAIN|`|9c7376f26c36bc947149ca2f7eae4097aa	Do you want to take up kickboxing ? If the answer is yes, then by all means do so.|`|job9o5ioaa	That's the perfect disciplinary field for you and   surely concerning your height.    Kickboxing is a sick sport, you'll love it. Guaranteed.    Among the disciplines that Ive done, that would be favorite.    But i definitely suggest that, while you're doing that, mix it up with some Grappling, Judo or Jujitsu.  You don't have to of course.|`|vv5H7TRCaa	it will toughen you up it is a very demanding sport. but like any thing in life you get out what you put in hit the gym lift and start kickboxing i recommend mma it is an all around sport which you will train in everything i do it and i love it good luck friend|`|fZmvWv7qaa	If you're gangly and not very muscular I would not advise a martial art such as Kickboxing where brute strength is practically everything.    I suggest ju-jitsu, akido, or kung fu.  Your long reach and flexibility will serve you better there.

Im a die hard B's Pats and Sox fans but its entertainment get over it.|`|XqMMPSgVaa	I think you had some honest real Cards fans. To me part of being a great fan for your team is having some reality of your team other then just screaming we the best, we gone win it all, when the closest your team is set up to win it all is by winning a lottery pick or the 1st overall pick. Unfortunately I can tell you plenty of fans from almost any team that will do stuff like your saying steelers fans will do. Why you think every towns police dept hates when their team is in the big game/series? Cause win or loose they gotta stop people from doing some stupid stuff. I think you just saw some down to earth intelligent fans for the Cards.|`|ULw1777caa	I don't think most people do.  There are a very important part of the area here.  The parade today showed that.  Not many cities love their team like we love the Steelers.|`|fHxpycJSaa	Jumping off of a bridge because your favorite football team lost the Super Bowl is nothing to brag about or be proud of.

no92CTfZaa	no way|`|JZ1E66FEaa	hellllll yeah|`|SEcM9EDZaa	They play the same position but Randolph is younger, so if you're in a keeper league the answer is no.

Practice practice practice is the key. also have her put her hands up and stay every so often that way her weight is pushing her down and a good steady level...|`|f5R5BPTDaa	These type of questions should probably be best left to your gymnastics coaches. if you already have a coach that you pay, it seems much safer for your daughter. She could easily be injured taking advice from people over the internet that dont know her or her particular situation.  Gymnastics is dangerous enough when you have a coach right there watching her.|`|A46UYUNNaa	I couldn't do it last year and i just started practicing on my own. stretch each of your legs in a number of different stretches that stretch all parts of your leg. then just try it and hold it for as long as you can. take a rest for 30 seconds. then try again. and so on. make sure you don't slowly go into it and try to place your legs in the right position it won't work. gravity kinda has to pull you down. so hold on to the end of a bed or so and try it up against there. . if you do this everyday for a little while you should become more flexible.|`|yWXB5Eraaa	when she's doing the splits, her leg may be twisted the wrong way, and to be flexeble you had to start when you were young, like 3 years old.|`|TiQcyk5Iaa	to get her split straight,you can help by standing above her and fixing her hips. also try doing a split against a wall or laying on your back.|`|A3TpHyYCaa	its all about getting down once you are on the floor then its easier to start to fix your hips    strech the back leg muscles if you want to do splits correctly

That's because...well...not to mention the first game with Matt Cassel as quarterback after Tom Brady was injured after Week 1. vs. the Chiefs.

Lu7GJnsXaa	put weights on ur legs  trust me it works|`|195d481e791fe6dd37323b342df9fa94aa	well to begin with u need good stamina.  but soccer is not all about speed.  but if u feel u need to improve ur speed then u should improve ur stamina.  it might sound logic but try running more often.  both short and long distances.  see how far you can run without stopping then try running short distances as fast as u can.    if not find some drills wide recievers in american football do since they practice drills relating with improving speed.|`|kPbou3Vdaa	I don't know but I was lucky enough to inherit some border jumping skillz.|`|7SgcF7I2aa	Looky here bruder  Wat u can do is paint urself black  I min jus look at them "blacks" they are pretty fast|`|r4a376Ocaa	run like la migra is after you! and try running on sand.|`|WCf9V0ZNaa	ummm..buy a weight vest (10 pounds)...    wear it while playing a cascarita and maybe 10-15 mins before u finish playing take it off and u'll see a big difference...|`|A2p1izD4aa	Try squats its really good for you gluts and helps with explosive power on initial take off when running.  When starting  squats do it for about a month then stop and return to normal training for 2 weeks then do squats again for a month then rest for to week continue this cycle and you will see a dramatic increase in speed. Up too a full 1 second in an 100meter race.|`|nKDD0eNuaa	you have to get used to running  and eat alot of healthy food  eat your veggies and fruits  and please dont smoke|`|OwqqeqrSaa	THATS WHAT SHE SAID.
ILVCgXcYaa	Three weeks away, the best thing is grapple and box or just spar mma. Running is not going to help you in the long run. When you run it is a smooth rhythm the heart pace is constant unless sprinting then jogging mixing it up. MMA has it slow periods them fast pace periods you need to mimic that, plus the sparring will get you conditioned for getting hit.|`|3BGJETHYaa	Do stair sprints.  The irregular bursts more accurately simulate what you are going for.|`|r8CmwwNiaa	If that's the case then I don't think that it is your cardio......you just need to learn how to breath better while you grapple or box. Always try to stay relaxed. Control your breathing.|`|58e37d517ee1c00376f7fddeaa71cf1faa	You don't really have enough time to see much improvements at all....assuming you only have those 3 weeks, you'd want to lay off the training about a week beforehand to rest your body so that gives you only 2 weeks  But, for future notice  Whoever told you running in a gas mask is a good idea..should be SHOT IN THE FACE  Run Sprints  Run Hill Sprints  Do   Tabata Squats  Tabata Thrusters  Tabata push ups  Search them if you don't know what they are    Do Complexes  a complex being 2 or more compound weight lifting exercises performed back to back....where you'd perform x amount of one exercise followed by x amount of the second exercise, not putting the weight down until you're done the sets    an example would be    Easy  3 'sets' of  10 Clean  10 Front Squat  10 shoulder press    Hard  10 straight leg deadlift  10 sumo deadlift  10 bent over row  10 Clean  10 Front squats  10 shoulder press  10 back squats   10 good morning  10 lunges(each leg)    rest 30 seconds    then 9 for each exercise    rest 30 seconds    8    repeat until you get to one rep for each exercise....your legs will love it|`|ypIlLtanaa	Honestly three weeks isn't alot of time to prepare for a fight especially if you are trying to get your cardio better. The only advice i have for you is if you live some where were you can get to higher elevation, then running and doing normal work outs there will help but I am not sure on how much in 3 weeks. When it is colder out side hence harder to breath cold air, run long distances and do work outs outside so that when you get into a warmer climate it is easier for you to breath and you don't get winded as fast.|`|job9o5ioaa	Do lots of swimming.    I mean, Devote to it.|`|6wSmZrrsaa	You need to reduce your rest time. At the end of a round you get 1 min to rest. Rich Franklin at home only gives him self 45 seconds to rest. This will make actually fighting seem easier than the training. Try running at full speed on the elliptical and then rest for 45 seconds and get back on.|`|d3zT4NFaaa	Ok sorry dude! I dont have any tips to help you up the cardio within the next 3 weeks other than, perhaps swimming and running. I would suggest that in the week prior to your bout you do normal cardio, i.e. without that gas mask, so that your body adjusts to normal atmospheric pressure. You need to allow your body to condition itself to the kind of environment that your fight will be in. Perhaps do some shuttle running - alternate between short spurts of sprinting and longer spurts of jogging.    If you had more time you should actually do both yoga and pilates. Think about it?? Not only do they help you improve on your core strength and flexibility but they also improve your circulation. Why is circulation important? because circulation is what allows transport of oxygen to all parts of your body. It strengthens and conditions your abdominal muscles in a way that helps you breath more efficiently! I've started doing both yoga and pilates for a year now, and I can tell you that it has made a big difference in my cardio and endurance.    But this is more a a long term thing. Perhaps you could combine yoga/pilates with your running, both before (as a great warm up) and after as a great warm down.

WRh7eEXfaa	well, i have owned both exact base styles, the 1st was exactlly the same scottsdale table, without the tennis table option= i got home with it, it was brand new in the box, put it together, and tried 4 hours to level it up= impossible!!! i know how to level a table, as i have moved, and refelted many. the balls kept going to the center, and it was unlevel in a couple different spots as well= i boxed it back up, and took it straight back, and got my money back.    the fullerton table is the exact same 1 i have right now, but mine is a 3x 6 foot, which is about 8-10 inches shorter than the 1 you are looking at. it levels perfect, as the wood bed seems a little thicker, but cant tell you how the extra foot will be, in leveling it?  my current fullerton table has 2 inch balls, which regular sized tables have 2 1/4 inch balls. but the 2 inch balls fit my table demensions perfect, as you can take 2 balls ant try to put them into the corner pocket, side by side at the same time, and they barelly squeeze thru. so thats about what you are looking 4. barelly not fitting is fine as well, you just dont want were 2 1/2 balls could fit thru, at once= pockets are too big.      so i would definitelly stay away from the scottsdale model!  if your interested, email me, and i can help you find a 3x6 model like the fullerton model, which i know will level up perfect, roll true, play true, rails play pretty true, and the sheer cloth rolls true, as your going to get from that value of a table.     i bought mine to keep people off my 9foot, 860 simonis clothed brunswick table. i still mess with it once in awhile, and i can get into stroke very fast on the small table, and carry it straight to the 9 footer.     let me know what you are looking for in a table? do you want 1 with the ping pong option?  depending on what your looking for, i could help you find what you need, what size room, are you working with?    but back to the question, there is no doubt between the choice of thoes 2 you mentioned, id get the fullerton, as i know that exact size an model scottsdale is junk!!!    good luck|`|8fd43fc00327e91d3e12c8722a78447eaa	they are similar enough that flipping a coin might be the best way to decide

Knicks are better no matter what. And we did beat you all 3 games. so take out the :Even Though and the ? mark and put an ! point", and there is my answer!!! WE BEAT U NOT JUST ONCE,NOT JUST TWICE,BUT 3 TIMES!!! THAT MEANS ALOT COMPARED TO 1 GAME THAT WE ONLY LOST BY 9 POINTS AGAINST THE REALLY HARD L A K E R S!!!!  Lets see Charlotte come within 10 of L.A.L. and then we will see who asks a question like this!!!!|`|FWKEw2jCaa	Nope!!!!!!

Or would you rather just see him be a face and wrestle every week with no fans. This actually increases his popularity. he would have been another Val Venis who turned face and wrestled every week with no rivalries and got no credit.

Iron when forged produces a loose scale seen as impuritys in the metal that had to removed I assume purity tempering would refer to using pure steel only as forging steel does not produce scale and would be considered pure
HUQMqdDqaa	Canned goods can be stored for a very long time, although if dented certain canned foods can develop botulism. Military surplus MRE's are the best choice, approximately 3,000 calories per meal (if you eat everything in them). Additionally they contain everything you need to stay nourished per package. I would suggest finding the ones in the light tan bags versus the dark brown pouches, they are newer and taste better. I have seen on-line places that sell a case (12 meals) for around 100 dollars. They are shelf stable for 7-years, at which point they are inspected and if still good they are resealed and sit for another 7-years. To put it in perspective, in 1996 I had an MRE while in the army that had a production date of 1983 on the box. It was still good to go.|`|DV4xyeChaa	fruit cake...any thing canned can last 10 or 20 yrs easy...keep cool and dry..|`|AA12243350	The smartest thing you can do to start with, is buy the canned items that you already use everyday. These will easily last a year, and each week or month when you go shopping, buy the normal items and rotate out of your stock and put the new items in the back of the shelf. keep rotating like this and you don't have to adjust to new foods in a survival situation. Next, invest in a grinder, and store wheat, which can be used for breads, and cereals, as well as cooking. Next, invest in some freeze dried long term items, like rice, beans, etc from emergency essentials, and finish off with as many MRE meals as you can afford (about $65.00 per case of 12 meals). This covers short term, and long term storage, as well as day to day needs. Don't forget to stock items you use every day like meds, TP, paper plates, plastic utensils, special need items for babies, kids, and pets. And lastly , a few select firearms, ammo, spare parts, and medical supplies and clothing.  Make up a smaller kit to keep in each vehicle, and a "grab and go" kit in a back pack for quick get away during an immediate emergency.  shoot safe|`|ZuhJwjHWaa	HONEY!|`|f3cbb5ce9f2304adcda13ae360118e58aa	canned veggies & fruits.|`|QrjuueMCaa	MRE's.

6f36240af8847ca83ec28b5f2b425b32aa	Well, Foxy is the closest so far, but he is wrong.  you see for his theory of each having the same kinetic force would require the bb's to have a muzzle velocity proportional the the weight of the bb.  put simply if an airsoft gun could fire .20g bbs at 400fps, then with his argument .40g bbs(they do make these) would have to leave the barrel at 200 fps. But that's not how it works, Last time I cronoed my sniper rifle It was shooing 546 fps with .20g bbs(we crono all our guns with .20).  When I put the .30's that I normally shoot It only dropped the Fps to around 495.  so long story short .30's will hurt more|`|XYReu11daa	it's all about distance. from point blank it would be the .3 though, since it would have more force coming out of the barrel, but the .2 bb would retain it's force over a longer distance.|`|Iw8L15x8aa	.3 because .2 is smaller and wouldnt have enough weight to go farther and wouldnt put down enough damage|`|jEJxcWq5aa	Their both going to hit you with the same kinetic energy, therefore they will both hurt the same.|`|Szf3UEVNaa	Depends on the distance if you are close the .3g will hurt more at far range the .3g may not because it has slowed down. it really depends on the circumstance of the game.|`|AA10056762	You really can't tell because everyone has different pain tolerances. Generally saying they should hurt about the same. The .2 is lighter but traveling faster. The .3 would be traveling slower but it is heavier.

xhPKkkELaa	You mentioned one very important fact. He is 23. He is not some dumb 15 year old kid who doesn't know better. He knows that pot is illegal, he knows that it would tarnish his reputation if he got 'caught', and he knows he is a PUBLIC figure, and as an adult, he made a decision to do it anyway. So stop crying for him, adults are entirely responsible for their own actions. It was his choice, and he knew the risks.    How would I feel if somebody turned in a picture of me? Well, it sure wouldn't be a picture of me doing something (anything) stupid like taking a hit off a bong. Maybe you need to grow up a little yourself.    Now, I have plainly stated my position on his actions, but that still in no way justifies a "friend' jack potting his buddy by publishing that picture. If a friend screws up, a real friend tries to extricate him from the trouble, not blackmail him with it. Shame on both of them.|`|Op1WIwyPaa	It was his choice and it was wrong.

I think Kozlov will win at No Way Out to make it a really good storyline between Undertaker and Vladimir Kozlov at WM 25. The only reason I think he won't face Stone Cold or HBK is because HBK isn't on his brand.

Hope this help and good luck with yur fantasy hockey team...|`|LrS6fS8laa	Currently Carey Price (Montreal Canadians) is the starting goalie for them.  Although he has not been at his best i would for sure start him.  Steve Mason (Columbus Blue Jackets) on the other hand is on a roll, in his first NHL season he is in the top 5 for all three main goaltending catigories which are Shutouts, GAA, and Save %.  He has been starting most of thier games this year since being called up.  Then Mike Smith (Tampa Bay Lightning) is a solid goaltender but out of the 3 i would start him last, he has his games but he is over in Tampa spilting time.  So all in all i would start Carey Price and Steve Mason over Mike Smith.
MNws22r5aa	Yay, a check list! lol     Inner layer: this is the layer of cloths that touch your skin and let moister out.     Long Johns   1-2 pairs of socks, you want long socks or else your going to get really bad blisters, ouch.      Middle layer: this Layer keeps in warmth and lets moister out also.     Wool sweatshirt   Some really thin sweat pants       Outer layer: This layer protects you from the snow,ice,and water. Make sure it is water proof but also breathable.     Snow pants   Snow jacket or ski/snowboard jacket, it doesn't make a difference.   Hat   Helmet(highly recommended but optional)   Snowboard boots   Glove(breathable gloves that have double or maybe triple sstitching   BBandanna keeps your face warm, you can ssometimesdouble up on them too)    Goggles(optional)        Hope you have fun!|`|mperjS8caa	Ok, so this is what you will need:    First Layer: A tight, almost skin tight, long sleeve shirt.  They can be cotton or polyester.  Make sure they are not too big as you don't want them sticking out. (Tuck this layer in!)    Second Layer: A softshell.  Has to be at least water resistant.  I recommend the north face apex softshell.  Not the thermal, as you will get too warm.    Third Layer: Your snow jacket.  Must be at least 10k waterproof and breathable.  Some people opt for the more expensive gore text that will stay dry no matter what condition.    And for the bottoms, you can wear this:    First Layer: I wear a pair of spandex under armour ColdGear leggings.  You can also wear fleece sweats as long as they are smaller than your pants.    Second Layer: You Snow pants.  At least 10k waterproof and breathable.  They can be a little big, because most snow pants have a gator.    For Hands, i would get gore tex gloves. Dakine specifically.  I love their gloves.  They are the best gloves on the market. (On really cold days, you can buy burton liners that are really warm and you can find them for under $10!)    For feet, I would wear wool, crew socks. I wear burton dryride socks.  They stay dry in all conditions    For shoes, you have to buy snowboard boots.  I have boa boots and they are the best.  All You is push in the circular button and twist.  They are laces instead of wire.  You spin it until they are tight enough.    Here are some great sites where you can all this stuff for really nice prices:    http://www.sierrasnowboard.com/  http://www.the-house.com/  http://www.dogfunk.com/  http://www.porterstahoe.com/|`|HyZu0vUnaa	for shoes you can just wear normal shoes if you are renting because they give you boots and basically what she said|`|jTaW3goeaa	From somebody that snowboards in all weather conditions including the days when its well below zero this is what you want to wear...    base layer...    http://www.underarmour.com/shop/us/en/wo...    and    http://www.underarmour.com/shop/us/en/wo...    mid layer    http://www.underarmour.com/shop/us/en/wo...    and    http://www.underarmour.com/shop/us/en/wo...    I'd double up on this layer if you're going to be riding in single digits or below, unless this is your first time in which case just wear the one layer because you'll be doing a lot of work     outer layer    http://www.underarmour.com/shop/us/en/wo...    and    http://www.underarmour.com/shop/us/en/wo...    you'll also need a heavy pair of socks of some sort, only wear one pair, more than 1 will not keep you any warmer, in fact it usually makes your feet colder    You also need a helmet, you're stupid not to wear one, helmets save lives and also can mean the difference between a serious  head injury and just getting up and continuing with the riding.      You're also going to want goggles and some sort of mask that provides face protection, a cheap bandana will not cut it.    If you don't have gloves/ mittens here is a pair that will work    http://www.underarmour.com/shop/us/en/wo...    As for the shoes, you wear special snowboard boots.  You can buy them at a ski/snowboard store or you can just rent them at the mountain.    I recommend Under Armour clothing because its great stuff.  I ride everyday even when the temperatures are well below zero and I don't get cold.  The best place to buy it is online for the best selection, but I've also seen a lot of It at D I C K S sporting goods.|`|N3qc36Ataa	Check the weather and decide how thick of layers you will need.  Start with a synthetic or silk base layer, then fleece or wool over that, then a waterproof shell on the outside. You heat up and cool down a lot snowboarding, so make sure you can zip and unzip easily.  Pockets that zip or otherwise fasten shut are good.  You will need good wool socks.  Socks that are made for skiing or snowboarding are best.  Only wear one pair.  Don't wear anything made of cotton.  Cotton holds moisture and will not insulate when wet.  You need waterproof mittens or gloves, and a hat or preferably a helmet.  If it's going to be windy you may want a scarf or bandana for your face. Goggles or at least sunglasses for your eyes.  Take lip balm and sunscreen too.  Rent snowboarding boots.  Have fun out there!|`|8KyKsOLWaa	Depends on where you are headed and what the temperatures are going to be like.    Start with a pair of thermal underwear - pants and top. Put a hoodie over the thermal top and finish up with a snowboard jacket. If your jacket isn't insulated (ie. just a shell), you'll probably want another layer. Another sweater will do the trick (preferably wool).    Put a pair of snowboard pants over your thermal bottoms and that will usually do the trick. If your pants are just a shell, you may want to bring a pair of track pants but depending on where you are, you probably won't need it.    You'll need a pair of snowboard boots but if you are hiring your gear, just wear a pair of gum boots or something similar to the mountain. You don't particularly need snowboard socks but an advantage is that they are longer and a thicker. You don't want your socks to be shorter than your boots - that can give you blisters and your socks might slip down.    You'll definitely need gloves and it sounds as though you're a beginner so you'll want them to be waterproof! If you're going to stick to snowboarding, invest in a pair of snowboarding gloves (don't get park gloves - rarely waterproof and too too thin). If it's just for a day you can probably get away with some cotton gloves and a waterproof shell glove ... though you might not be warm enough.    Again, depending on the weather you will want to protect your neck and face. A fleece neckwarmer is ideal for cold winds but a bandanna will do the trick in warmer temperatures. In really cold weather it may pay to wear a balaclava. You can get away with a scarf but they can get annoying.    You'll also want a pair of goggles - you may be able to hire these. You'll need a beanie or toque (whatever you call where you're from) to wear to the resort but make sure you wear a helmet while you're riding! You will be able to hire one of these. Don't be a fool - I work at a snow resort so I'm quite experienced and I still wear a helmet! My boyfriend who is a very experienced snowboarder gave himself concussion last season. You never know what's going to happen. Some idiot could lose control and take you out. Protect your head! Take a look around while you're there, the ones who really rip always wear helmets.    Bring with you some spare socks and gloves and some more layers. You can always take layers off but if you get there and realize you're freezing, you can't make layers magically appear!    Hope you have a blast :)
11i3Xmb1aa	I agree with you it's stupid.   Like the throwback was better then the 'attitude adjuster'. Come on just because it is PG they should've not changed the names of John Cena's finishers. It's not like kids are going to go online and be like um I wonder what FU and STFU stand for. I find it really stupid in the first place WWE changed John Cena's finisher names.  Now what will the call the STFU I mean STF.|`|Z1ruPjmCaa	i think thats very stupid but they had 2 do it because there PG now i think they should stay 14 A|`|6E16tR6xaa	It's true! That's worse then the throwback. I'm still calling it FU, i dont care. What's next they do away with divas?|`|MxhZgjXWaa	It should be called The Rim Job|`|lr68XuMFaa	Its a gay name for a gay wrestler|`|3g08yf94aa	its full of crap|`|H9COS7LRaa	I just heard it on wwe.com and I thought the announcers forgot the move, Again.      LOL|`|vPpiHZSSaa	Seriously?? When did this happen?|`|LSFSfNCXaa	damn the throwback was ok imo but the attitude adjuster sounds like a gay timeout they give you in middle school|`|4DzPhJgKaa	Yeh it has  they also changed the STFU to the STF  so its now Shut The **** which isnt anymore childish :/  he now sucks even more

We may not be good but are fans are CRAZZYY|`|b3d5e01b61690541f093b9b7eaaacaf8aa	Is there really any one team that can claim that? Some teams have larger fan bases than others, but does that mean that someone who roots for the Steelers or the Cowboys is a "better fan" than someone who roots for a different team?     Anyone can be a good fan regardless of who they root for. I don't think that there's any one team that can make a clearly defined claim that they have the "best fans" even with the argument of popularity.|`|ErTVzpUUaa	STEELERS!  Steeler nation is far and wide!!!|`|EZecmaU7aa	definitely the steelers...and not just because i live in PA    but i mean...you can just see it if you ever watch a steelers game...    i would say the cowboys and giants come close too|`|yg3Pveakaa	Patriots have the best fans..|`|h5K2fcuDaa	thEEEE Pittsburg nation.|`|A6AJ6nxLaa	PACKERS!!!|`|ZD929uxNaa	whichever team i decide to cheer for|`|01uvdHbHaa	Carolina Panthers|`|bT0kyzRPaa	new orleans saints because they suck every year but we still got thier back...... oakland raiders are known to be the most hostile|`|np8T5cMuaa	well, everyone whos a fan of an NFL team is going to argue that their teams fans are the best. so really everyones fans are great. look at the devotion people have towards watching football for ALL the teams every single week.|`|cNv5PZTSaa	PATRIOTS!!!|`|AJEDjzC1aa	The Pittsburgh Steelers or Dallas Cowboys|`|AC7SEXWwaa	Redskins! because they havent been amazing lately but they still have VERY loyal fans!|`|rOZ1WSqNaa	Maybe we really gotta hand it to the Steelers...(barely)  I suppose Cleveland...

Like I think Roxxi is beautiful.<br>  Most of the WWE girls have less than a year of actual wrestling experience, and besides a few of WWE ladies, [Victoria, Mickie, Melina, Beth,] they put on two tons of makeup, which only makes them look worse, and then all they do is clotheslines and grabbing hair, disgracing women wrestling.<br>  Oh, and TNA girls are trashy??? Open your eyes.<br>  TNA girls cover up more than WWE chicks, even though they're not wrestling in a jumpsuits or anything, they still try to contain some of their stuff and they don't degrade themeselves by having bikini contests, and "dance offs". WTF.<br>  While it's personal opinion, I think women in TNA are prettier...and besides for those listed, tons more talented. They actually try to focus on the art of wrestling, instead of rolling around and getting seperated by WWE "security".|`|8DjzKfWDaa	OUTSIDE OF VELVET SKY AND GAIL KIM MOST OF THE KNOCKOUTS ARE DOG UGLY<br>  CANDICE<br>  KELLY KELLY<br>  MELINA<br>  MARIA ALONE BLOW THEIR WHOLE ROSTER AWAY AND IM LEAVING OUT ALOT OF WWE DIVAS|`|d8Jbc7zgaa	stop watching girls on TV and go get a girlfriend.|`|XTKpUSmKaa	TNA has a lot of good looking girls.

3pZ3nfGZaa	It's because he is 30. Ofcourse all the bumps have taken a toll on his body over the years.  And if he would keep doing crazy stuff. He wouldn't be wrestling for very long. It would be suicide.<br>  <br>  Good thing he slowed down.|`|VzUHIYH5aa	Hes still the same, I dont really think age is a factor, its how long you been wrestling. dont forget hes been with the WWE since he was 16. Plus remember WWE is nowhere as hardcore as it used to be. jeffs only 30 so I would definetly not blame that, most of the "newer" talents in the wwe are in their late 20s to mid 30s and they havent put their body ANYWHERE near what Jeffs been putting his through, Be grateful for his great wrestling|`|AA11808531	He's getting old and he still is an amazing wrestler I even thinks he wrestles better than he used to because I haven't start noticing him as a great wrestler until he made his WWE return in late 2007 or early 2008.|`|KMtjOhftaa	hes back and hes better dan ever|`|DBSseG62aa	Well he's getting older of course and yes drugs can take a toll on your body. He has also gained weight which slows him down. Also the man has been jumping off of some high heights and putting his body on the line for 10 years, things start to give out. I still think he is great and by far my fav wrestler. He's been showing new stuff lately. He's also on Smackdown! now which caters to a younger audience, he has to keep it fresh.|`|nvkKusgxaa	there trying to give them a single push they don't want tag gold anymore they want single gold and WHC gold|`|63ce14dc7c788e16d783f90000ca7bc5aa	no, he wrestled the same way he does now. Its just that he doesnt wrestle as a tag team right now, if he did, you would see him do the jumping over people's backs.|`|bea2393a51ca0e4eb0ee3529fc306f25aa	I'm sure all those moves he did in the past have taken a toll on his body!!You can't blame him for slowing down a bit,to prevent being crippled in the future!!He's still great tho!!
01d400REaa	HILARIOUS<br>  <br>  and to the marks who are running their mouth about CM Punk, I don't think it's unfair, i think it's IRONIC, i mean, Jeff Hardy got suspended over DRUG USE and CM Punk is straightedge, which means he doesn't take drugs and since he is straightedge he won the MITB breifcase after Jeff Hardy lost it cos of drugs...<br>  yep irony...<br>  <br>  <br>  WQ. Probably Batista, the kiddies go nuts for him..|`|3pZ3nfGZaa	Sure he will. <br>  He was suppose to win the MITB. It was pretty obvious. I mean he was on a roll.. VERY OBVIOUS.<br>  <br>  I think he will become world champion soon. Michael hayes headwriter off smackdown has said to always be VERY High on the hardy brothers.  He sells lots of merchandise.  He damn sure has alot of fans. So why wouldn't he.<br>  Wouldn't surprise me if he was world champion before the end of the year.<br>  <br>  And just so you know. I don't mind CM punk winning MITB and cashing in anyway. He is one of my favorite superstas too.|`|56uR1m8Zaa	Jeff was actually meant to win money in the bank this year until he was suspended. If it wasn't for that he would be holding the WHC now not Cm Punk. Both Matt and Jeff will have world title shots and will both eventually win.<br>  <br>  Haha actually he was and no he wouldn't of had it because he was suspended at the time Wrestlemania happened.<br>  <br>  <br>  HAHA.You know whats funny YOU AGREED to everything i said right here <a href="http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AgyTmOVYmROracK_taMdAsIhBgx.;_ylv=3?qid=20080704165554AACTHIt&show=7#profile-info-8DjzKfWDaa">http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a><br>  You gave me best answer. stop contridicting youself.|`|2GMvuliVaa	Lol I only I hate it because it really isnt fair that CM Punk has a title reign, hes sloppy and inexpierienced.

XTKpUSmKaa	I think it would be about the same, without the other company to force it to make the best shows possible it wouldn't be as good as during the wars. TNA wouldn't exist.|`|63ce14dc7c788e16d783f90000ca7bc5aa	It would be worst. And TNA will still exist, unless Jim Cornette quit because of WCW quitting.

He wasn't always the Deadman, That was his second gimmick. Hell the last one wasn't even the Dead Man but was called The Phenom combining Attire from many different gimmicks.|`|3pZ3nfGZaa	K .<br>  <br>  It's hopefully about paul bearer. Oohh yeees.<br>  <br>   It would make sense since he was supposedly "killed" at GAB 2004.|`|ww65eXn0aa	it is the undertaker hes coming in the great American bash|`|GQWGLSexaa	i think he is just getting mad because they will not let him have his way lol

d71392a8d7aafb5823c7f35357002dd0aa	MVP>Michael Cole|`|XTKpUSmKaa	MVP is not better than Kennedy. He is very good but not better than Kennedy. Kennedy probably has more pure talent than most of the guys in the WWE. But I think he is going to be a tweener. Because, Umaga is a heel and will stay that way and Kennedy will probably stay face. He also put JR down while at ringside so I don't think so. Maybe eventually not now though. I hope he does in the future though.|`|f2d3d8edde822210301b7dc5946235ecaa	Probably. I heard a rumor that he was going to be a face. Don't know if it's true.|`|sGE9qz47aa	yes i think that too.|`|6i1oWqtBaa	Nice thought, I agree with you|`|63ce14dc7c788e16d783f90000ca7bc5aa	Maybe but Kennedy>MVP
56uR1m8Zaa	Dont believe everything you read.<br>  And the match could hapen Because its in texas and they are both from Texas. But i don't think they are retiring. They are in their forties and still in fantastic shape. I hope Undertaker vs Shaun Michaels does happen because it would be a great match because Undertaker took HBK out the 2007 royal rumble and HBK took undertaker out the 2008 royal rumble. I think they have always had this long rivalry. And i think it is about time WWE put things like that to use and put on a great match at wrestlemania.<br>  <br>  Mr Wrestlemania vs The Dead Man 16-0<br>  GREAT!|`|GUwO3Z6Haa	If i'm not mistaken, they both are from Texas so it'd be a good match for the fans in Dallas. But I think Taker will stay on Smackdown and HBK will face somebody else. And Undertaker will probably face HHH or Edge in his last match (If that is his last match, which I doubt it will be!!)|`|htvl1AMeaa	No.<br>  The Undertaker lost a career threatening<br>  match didn't he?<br>  <br>  So he doesn't wrestle anymore.|`|Vwbqy8yBaa	i think it's going to be the undertaker vs booker t . they are both from houston,tx.|`|f2d3d8edde822210301b7dc5946235ecaa	I doubt it, but that would be a kick *** match.|`|bZVWUThtaa	It well be 17-0|`|63ce14dc7c788e16d783f90000ca7bc5aa	I dont know but i doubt it.|`|jtEOvGKsaa	Yeah I'm really hoping for Undertaker vs Shawn Michaels, this might be one of the best matches in WWE history... I don't think any of them is retiring though... And if this match won't happen, then I want to see a hell in a cell between Triple H & Undertaker!

7c77dbacf5909aba2841562659d686c0aa	Anteayer leí un editorial de La Nación en el que se daban detalles de las peleas que mantienen  nuestros atletas por ese tema. Por ej, decía que Bardach se quejó de que nunca hay agua caliente en las duchas del CENARD para ba?arse después del entrenamiento, y que los remeros practican poco menos que en una cloaca llena de basura y hasta de bichos...pero viste que canal 13 por ahí está de crítco y por ahí de obsecuente del gobierno, por eso no le va a dar mayor importancia a lo que pase con el CENARD.|`|ZHXPsQ8eaa	Hay mucha culpa compartida en estos casos.<br>  Primero, la dirigencia que no hace las cosas debidamente, destinando los fondos destinados a las necesidades primordiales, no te imaginas que deportistas están becados y ni siquiera compiten en deportes olímpicos.<br>  Los deportistas, no malinterpreten, pero muchos con marcas "B" viajan a un JJOO, sabiendo que no van a competir (participar no es igual a competir), recordemos que por cada deportista viajan 2 dirigentes, lo cual multiplica el dinero que se gasta. <br>  Nosotros, que apoyamos deportes amateurs durante esta época (o durante panamericanos) cuando no lo hacemos nunca, incluso esperando mucho más de lo que realmente está nuestro plantel capacitado para dar.<br>  Y como bien dicen en otra rpta, el periodismo que es parcial en muchos aspectos.|`|XxXExQnPaa	La mayoria de la gente, asi es.<br>  no se si tengan los argentinos la infraestructura adecuada pero eso pasa con Mexico, tampoco creo que mi pais la tenga, basta con ver el medallero y alli te daras una idea.<br>  <br>  Saludos.|`|SDHvDNGJaa	Estoy de acuerdo.

1ced09090a18210ce355123ea9003d99aa	Since the summer of 1967.  41 years now.<br>  <br>  I started watching wrestling long before there was an internet, PPVs, or 2-hour prime-time TV wrestling shows.  We had a one-hour TV show on Saturday afternoons.<br>  <br>  You have no idea how much the wrestling business has changed since the late 60's.|`|11i3Xmb1aa	Okay, I started when I was 4. And stopped when I was like 6 almost 7. And started watching it again at the age of 8 or 9. And I'm still watching wrestling. <br>  In total that would be like 9 years. :]|`|pT0SjzZGaa	I've Only watched it for 18 years but i've gone back and watched alot of the greats like Terry Funk in action on youtube and stuff, |`|63ce14dc7c788e16d783f90000ca7bc5aa	Thats long too, I watched it for 10 years.|`|iFuO8gy7aa	2 years.|`|mJvZhdAuaa	Since I was five.

And then came WrestleMania and the boom had begun.  |`|6e9wMh6yaa	5 years then the storylines got stupid. After the Rock left, I was disappointed.

If you actually think that CM Punk, John Cena, Randy <br>  Orton,... could survive then, you don't know wrestling. With the case<br>  of Mark Henry and Mabel. Sure they're big but they move as fast as <br>  turtles. Back then you had guys like the late Haystacks Calhoun<br>  and the late Jerry "Crusher" Blackwell. Blackwell could throw a dropkick whenever he wanted and he was around 450 pds.

Lztf4UL0aa	Ese Apodo se los Pusieron los Zorro Rojinegros del ATLAS<br>  <br>  Porque corrian como CHIVAS<br>  <br>  Saludos|`|6Lb3wteYaa	 DE AQUI SURGIO EL MOTE DE CHIVAS<br>  Artículo de El Informador, donde se utiliza por primera vez el apodo de Chivas.Como es normal en la relación entre los equipos de fútbol y sus seguidores, estos prefieren nombres cortos y con el mayor significado para referirse al equipo de sus preferencias, en el caso del Guadalajara, lo largo de este nombre favoreció la rápida popularización del sobrenombre "Chivas", con el que actualmente se identifica al equipo.<br>  <br>  Es necesario tomar en cuenta que los jaliscienses o tapatíos suelen ser muy afectos a imponer sobrenombres, incluso algunos con un sesgo peyorativo, así durante la temporada 1948-1949, las porras de los dos equipos más importantes de la capital de Jalisco llevaron su pasión al terreno de los sobrenombres chuscos y ofensivos, los fanáticos del Atlas llamaban a su equipo con el apodo de "Los Académicos" debido a lo depurado de su técnica.<br>  <br>  Pronto los del Guadalajara comenzaron a llamar a los atlistas como los "Los Margaritas" aduciendo que eran muy delicados. En venganza durante un juego entre el Guadalajara y el Tampico Madero Fútbol Club los atlistas los llamaron Chivas brinconas.<br>  <br>  Aunque el propósito era ofender a la afición del Guadalajara, el sobrenombre les agradó cuando fue publicado el primero de octubre de 1948 en el encabezado del diario "El Informador"[9] y desde entonces se convirtió en la forma más popular de identificación del equipo. Esta información se puede encontrar en varias publicaciones y páginas de internet como la página oficial, entre otras [1] [2].<br>  <br>  Derivado de ese sobrenombre, la afición chiva se refiere a su equipo como "El reba?o sagrado" o "El Chiverío", uno de sus signos, muy a tono con el carácter bravío de la región es el de "Soy chiva y qué".|`|Gyt7ENQdaa	porque en los a?os 50's luego de ser bailadas por el Atlas, hubo un periodista que las llamo chivas brinconas, porque no tenian ni pies ni cabeza, al principio se molesto la aficion, pero luego como nacos que son, se apropiaron de un apodo para hacerlo su grito de guerra... |`|EZzxyBK3aa	era una burla de los margaros por que se supone que   las chivas brincan mucho , pero   les gusto a las cabras  y se lo quedaron<br>  <br>  <br>  pero me pregunto  yo , por que no  Chivos  en lugar de Chivas ... como  que esta medio pu?al no ?<br>  <br>  "ORGULLO AZUL Y ORO"|`|6F9mRFHvaa	Por feos y cuernudos jajajajajjajajaa|`|QoUGRQBgaa	por que son el animal mas corriente y que siempre actua por acarreamiento todo como sus aficionados.|`|7drAsZvyaa	Es mas facil GOOGLEARLO|`|QpB6kWGTaa	es como llamar tuzos al pachuca, es solo la mascota representativa|`|171f87a2b0478db709f2c0a73e05fa42aa	X PUTTT OS Y CUERNUDOS<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  SOY AZULKREMA X ESO ENTIENDO TU ENVIDIA|`|12b9pd1Waa	por q cualquiera les pone los cuernos|`|yXX1mbyxaa	chigays|`|bLftrk1Jaa	me da hueva explicarte, busca en google<br>  <br>  ===================================<br>  <br>  mas o menos como lo dice mike|`|ovKsZmwmaa	chupame el pito|`|SDHvDNGJaa	El Atlas les puso así, por brinconas!!!<br>  =?)|`|tCh60crwaa	Como no soy mexicana...entro a aprender...porque no tengo idea.|`|3726563fac74dd3da5e239244077f36caa	Porque es el papa de los zopilotes.....<br>  Porque lleva  ganados  11 campeonatos con puros jugadores  100% mexicanos...<br>  porque  les  va  a volver a demostrar a los  americanistas que  con dolares no  es  suficiente para  serr un equipo grande  como las  chivas....<br>  Porque vamos  a  ganar y de paso  darles  un bonito  baile similar al que  se  le  dio  al Boca y al River.....<br>  Porque  es un gran equipo que  sienten su  playera desde fuerzas basicas (sabran los zopilotes  lo  que  esto  significa???)<br>  Pero  sobre todo porque ningun equipo de los  restantes 17 de la liga de mexico ha ganado un titulo con puros mexicanos y CHIVAS  lleva nadamas 11campeonatos, por eso  da risa  cuando  alguien  quiere  compararse  a las gloriosas   CHIVAS..LE PESE A QUIEN LE PESE<br>  <br>  Por eso  se llaman CHIVAS |`|6PzVO6Q5aa	es una larga historia, dale en google y sale completa<br>  <br>  saludos<br>  <br>  o o o o o Cien o pre Chivas o o o o o 11|`|bZ4gQMlaaa	en wikipedia dice que por que el tampico madero quizo ofender al guadalajara diciendo chivas brinconas, pero a la aficon le gusto chivas y asi se quedo.|`|05ed21495132dd0bce679d50b45043edaa	Que hueva , porque no preguntas algo interesante. a y paco7 di algo nuevo.

piZ4xDBqaa	The NBA has what's known as a soft salary cap.  Unlike the NFL, NBA teams can exceed the salary cap for various reasons.  One is to resign a player on their roster.  However, if a team is over the cap, they must pay the league a "luxury tax".  The tax is one dollar for every dollar a teams payroll exceeds the salary cap.  So the Cavaliers, for example, who are $31 million over the cap, must pay the league $31 million in luxury tax.<br>  <br>  Another factor of being over the cap is that a team is restricted when it comes to trading and signing players.  A team over the cap can only make a trade if the salaries of the incoming players is roughly equal to the outgoing salaries.  Thats why you have widgets like the ESPN Trade Machine..  you can't just swap players, you have to watch salaries as well.<br>  <br>  Which brings us to Wally.  He's valuable trade bait not because of how well he plays, but because he has a big ($13.775 million) contract that expires at the end of this year.  That makes him attractive to a team like Phoenix, which is way over the cap and has all it's big money players signed for the next two or three years.  The Suns really want to get under the cap, so they could have traded Amare Stoudamire straight up for Wally  Szczerbiak.  It's a horrible trade from a basketball point of view, but it would really help the Suns out financially.  Phoenix owes Amare $15 million for 3 more years, and they're way over the cap as well.  They could make the trade, let Wally become a free agent at the end of the season when his contract is up, and save themselves $30 million next year alone. ($15 mill for Amare's contract, and $15 mill for the luxury tax)|`|KR1FdEZgaa	there is a cap on how much a team can spend on there team, if they go over that they pay a luxury tax. money sent to teams with low payrolls and loosing records. it is considered a luxury to over spend on your team. if my team owner can spend 200 million on players and your team owner can only pay 20 million, my owner would pay a luxury tax and your team would get money to help offset the difference. so you have a little more to spend and try to keep up with my team. problem is some owner just pocket there cut. and the rich owners don't always field the best team. gm don't always spend the money well.|`|Kwywmcs8aa	their contracts had only a year left on them so if you can get rid of $13 million from next years spending by trading you might want to do it.|`|NaYoqWBOaa	Teams have a salary cap and if they go over that they have to pay a luxury tax.<br>  <br>  This year the luxury tax threshold it's $71.15 million.<br>  <br>  It's determined on how much the NBA makes worldwide. With the state of the economy nowadays the salary cap might actually be lowered next year.

c4r6jwLjaa	We have a day set aside in the weight room for ab work...here are some workouts that we do.  Each exercise is 30 seconds then we have a 10 second break in between. Try to do 10-15 reps.<br>  <br>  1) Weighted crunches/sit-ups. I would start out with very light weight then gradually get a little heavier.<br>  <br>  2) Weighted twists. Take light weight, lift your feet a little bit off the floor, and twist your upper body while holding the weight to your chest.<br>  <br>  3) Leg Raises. Lift your legs off the floor so they form a 90 degree angle. Lower them to the floor, but don't let them touch. Keep going!<br>  <br>  4) Leg and Upper Body Raises. Just like #3 except you lift your legs and body...you try to touch your head to your knees. Then you lower your legs and body and back up. <br>  <br>  These are just a few of the many exercises you can do...<br>  <br>  Everybody has a different workout, but this works for me :)|`|Qwwjfdeuaa	for abs i use an exercise ball because it works best for me.<br>  <br>  With an exercise ball you have to keep your balance and its hard but over time you will get it.

Most organizations weren't doing a lot of superly -dark- stuff like Undertaker was going to be... but they needed him for a plot point, if I remember correctly. <br>  <br>  And he just caught on so fast, so hot, it was insane.

Mark did parts, Vince did other parts and most of the creative staff sat around and threw out ideas at the two of them for a few hours. Some stuck, others didn't.

SDHvDNGJaa	Madera, lazos, son los materiales más usales para un puente colgante para personas...|`|140c0f1b332de295f8a3563c23af4fadaa	Gerardo O. Un puente colgante es un puente sostenido por un arco invertido formado por numerosos cables de acero, del que se suspende el tablero del puente mediante tirantes verticales. Desde la antigüedad este tipo de puentes han sido utilizados por la humanidad para salvar obstáculos. A través de los siglos, con la introducción y mejora de distintos materiales de construcción, este tipo de puentes son capaces en la actualidad de soportar el tráfico rodado e incluso líneas de ferrocarril ligeras.  La suspensión en los puentes más antiguos puede hacerse por cadenas o barras enlazadas(ver: Puente de las Cadenas de Budapest), pero los puentes modernos tienen múltiples cables de acero. Esto es para mayor redundancia; unos pocos cables con defectos o fallos entre los cientos que forman el cable principal son una peque?a amenaza, mientras que un solo eslabón o barra malo o con defectos puede eliminar el margen de calidad o echar abajo la estructura.|`|akK3VSqTaa	Te equivocaste de categoria pero de todos modos yo te recomendaria tablas y cuerda.<br>  Saludos :o)|`|SEu2ZoSnaa	que tiene que ver eso con el boxeo

No repitas este proceso mas de 1 o dos veces por semana porque te podes lesionar, es necesario que los tendones se recuperen por unos días luego de exigirles con la elongacion. Si lo haces como te explique y con perseverancia tu elongacion va a aumentar considerablemente en 6 meses.<br>  El hecho de que elongues no quiere decir que vayas a perder velocidad, te recomiendo que vayas con un profesor de educacion física o con un personal trainer, o también algún instructor de taekwondo (ya que en esta disciplina se trabaja mucho el aspecto de la elongacion) para que te ense?en los ejercisios de elongacion correspondientes.<br>  <br>  (NO HAGAS CASO A LOS QUE TE DICEN QUE NO VA A DOLER, SI DUELE Y HAY QUE BANCARSE ESA "TENSION" ES DOLOR PERO RINDE FRUTOS... {{TAMPOCO ES UN DOLOR INAGUANTABLE}})<br>  <br>  espero que te sirva!<br>  <br>  <br>  saludos<br>  TAEKWON!|`|31862142933509fa80eb3e5fb503917faa	Muchas veces se piensa que los estiramientos son por naturaleza dolorosos, pero no es así, el secreto a voces de la flexibilidad es la constancia y la auto evaluación cotidiana, no sé que deporte practica ni tengo conocimiento del baile que quiere practicar, pero puedo decirle que si practica los estiramientos con buena técnica nunca le serán perjudiciales, por el contrario le ayudan a oxigenar mejor los músculos y a fortalecer los tendones.

isf5gDbmaa	If i were you i would take it easy, run the 2.5 miles for at least a week, and then gradually raise it to about 3 miles.  You can really hurt yourself if you just jump right into it.|`|aYVPZjLVaa	I'd drop it to an increase of half a mile to a mile every week. But if you can handle it then it's fine. Just watch the number of days you run in a row. Too many consecutive days of workouts increase the risk of injury because you don't allow the body to heal and rest. So maybe take a day off every four to five days.|`|aSvOaAjiaa	Take it steady, you will never get in shape if you lay yourself up|`|IITnJjAjaa	Take my advice, gradually build it up or your asking for injury. <br>  <br>  I've been suffering from Medial Tibial Stress Syndrome for nearly 3 years now and it ain't nice :(
9kMJJ1giaa	batMAN, batWOMAN,  they have SUPER POWERS!|`|zkovxRseaa	the Vampire Bat|`|LGCTOxZxaa	Hopefully youre talking softball. The rip-it by michelle smith. It looks lame, but in my 9 years of playing i havent come across a better bat. Another great one is the catalyst. Its a Louisville slugger. I used it last season and it has amazing power transfer. But both these bats are around 300. You have to be a good hitter to buy an expensive bat. If youre no good, a good bat is just a waste of money.
Lol0iLfgaa	I wouldn't worry about slowing yourself down by running with other people.  With 5 months of running under your belt, you are probably in quite a bit better aerobatic shape.  The funny thing about that is that it is truly hard to tell if you are in better shape unless you really test yourself one day. <br>  <br>  It sounds to me that you should be in good physical shape, but you are having trouble with the mental aspect of running.  You need to have a bit of confidence in yourself.  Other people can't make you slower, only you can.

When I come out of my stance, I'm going to go high and right.  High and right results in a loss of distance.|`|Z446YQ10aa	check your ball placement.|`|jLtNViiEaa	It could be that your shafts are too weak. You should go to a golf shop that has a launch monitor. They can tell you if you need stiffer shafts in your irons.|`|H8c34ZBzaa	Lesson time!!!!|`|333a8b96e50ca7be29e4122a1437a3d4aa	Try stepping forward an inch or two and see if it helps.|`|0qu36suxaa	As a single figure handicapper, you'll know that with so many moving parts in the golf swing, there could be a multitude of reasons for this.<br>  <br>  Assuming you've not changed equipment recently and it's only a recent development, I think we can take out the correct flex in the shafts problem.<br>  <br>  I went through a phase of this myself and I found it was as a result of my weight transferring too quickly on the downswing (I was arguably even getting a little bit of lateral movement ie. swaying through the ball).  This was inevitably putting by weight too far forward at impact and also creating an excessively steep angle of attack on the ball.<br>  <br>  THis is type of movement is quite often accompanied with an open clubface, as a steep angle of attack will make it difficult for you to rotate your forearms through impact this squaring the clubface.  This is because by coming in steep, you're arms are getting stuck and you've leaving the clubhead open.  I reckon if you can calm down the weight transfer, you'll come into the ball at a shallower angle and be able to complete normal clubhead rotation through impact.<br>  <br>  Hopefully this makes sense!  As an already decent player, I'm sure you'll figure it out.
DcEBhY02aa	A 5.7 will not get you no where in high school football. Even linemans move that fast. If he wants to have a good position he needs to get faster around a 4.9 even then because of his height he still probably wont be a WR. If he can get faster they would try him at running back. The best thing you can do as a dad is encourage him to join middle school track and work out all summer.|`|Du8QhOmaaa	At 5'6 he is going to be a pretty tall freshman, which is pretty good.. i would urge him to join both the track and football team. Track will help him really take time off of his 40 yard. In two months with track i shaved a second of my 40 time.

bQqkdPL9aa	The NBA is way to different now then it was when robinson played... he can get close but i dont think anyone else will ever do it. he can get close. like 24 ppg (cuz he would pass more) 9.5 apg 8.6 rpg|`|mwxKnUleaa	He can, but I don't think it would make the team better because Lebron would probably get distracted on the stats and loose control over the score so the way he plays right now is a perfect fit for the cavaliers. I am not saying it will be bad for there team,but I don't think it will benefit them.|`|Lxj6kMklaa	Dude we heard this all over ESPN. **** off, it's getting annoying|`|2db7f31f8de2a63df2848a630426eea7aa	He could if he wanted to, but I think he rather just win ball games. <br>  <br>  Why wear yourself out for a triple double each night?|`|P93I8CHtaa	high possibility|`|yt05KPhBaa	He can't. He'd have to stop scoring more and on fast breaks, he'd have to miss purposely and grab his own rebounds.|`|uoIV59V6aa	no|`|piZ4xDBqaa	LeBron is the type of player who could do it, but I don't think he will.  When Oscar Robertson did it, the league was a lot different.  Teams were running up and down the court, and defense was an afterthought.  Teams would routinely score 110 or 120 points a game.  Think Phoenix vs Clippers all the time.  :)<br>  <br>  A faster-paced game means more shots, more scoring, more rebounds, more assists.  This eras slower paced, defensive gameplans mean lower stat totals all around.|`|fWMzd7y5aa	There is a possibility that he could.<br>  and btw Oscar Robertson has done it once so a NBA player has done it so it is possible.<br>  I might be wrong but i am pretty sure Oscar Robertson averaged 30 ppg 12 apg and 11 rpg<br>  LeBron averages 28 ppg and 7 apg and 7 rpg so it is highly possible.|`|aupDanleaa	he can if he averages 10+ pts 10+ rbs and 10+ ast|`|wXxJUnLJaa	I think he can. He basically almost averages already<br>  <br>  28, 7, 7|`|PjFLDSmdaa	It's possible...he's the only one in the NBA who has any chance whatsoever. I don't think he ever will but if anyone can do it, LeBron can.|`|Ez0z7Of3aa	he's a great player but no he can't.|`|eF60R7DPaa	no|`|Ab4HRBFpaa	Im with you. I doubt it, but then again, if he were to trade to the right team, he could at least up his assists and rebounds a little and come very close.|`|fAMpj8s2aa	can he? yes. will any nba player EVER do that? no.

WT8CbURxaa	To add to Jimmy's answer, in addition to being heavily protected, it apparently is also a Kings 2014 2nd round pick.<br>  <br>  Not only would they have to wait about 5 years to get the pick, but from there, it's also heavily protected.|`|fAMpj8s2aa	idk for sure. my guess would be it means that they will end up trading that 2nd round pick or, more likely, the 2nd round pick will be so crappy that he'll never get any playing time.|`|H8u7gMAYaa	Hey Jay, Conan is a better host than you!

qlJ0anfAaa	achilles stretches (ankle stretches) are a good idea to prevent injury and to help you become more flexible for your jump. Also any calf / thigh weight training is useful, BUT: don't get your legs too bulky, or you will lose the flexibility in them, plus, you will be heavier for your jump. <br>  Sitting on the wall for 30sec intervals, skipping, and squats will help you. I've worked on my vertical for volleyball, and I find skipping and stretching, along with weight training is the most effective.<br>  Also make sure for the weight training that you keep it at high rep, low weight. Do approximately 20-30 reps at about 70-80% efficiency.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!!

OIJ2iHQFaa	If your talking about defensively as a pitcher where they should play well theres a few different scenarios for this one.<br>  Smart pitchers can cover first third and home before they're needed there. Example: Ground ball hit to first baseman playing edge of infield. Pitcher has to immediately cover that bag. Good defensive pitchers are hard to find many intricacies to the position. They can be the difference in any game because they have to be sharp every pitch they throw. <br>  Catching is just as important if not more important. Email me about this i can answer more exact questions that you may have on the subject. Too many details to describe on this thing and its too broad of a question. Can help you with the equipment questions too and whats worked for me and teams played on.|`|ZB0ITe2Oaa	No, baseball cleats' spikes don't have to be detachable for a high school team. <br>  The pitcher usually doesn't hit for the team. The coaches don't want to risk his getting hurt. The catcher does hit for the team. In most cases, he's the strongest hitter because of his sharp eye; he can tell what kind of pitch is being thrown at him by the opposing pitcher's grip or by the spin of the ball.<br>  On defense, the pitcher simply pitches the ball to the opposing team's hitters, trying to strike them out. The catcher receives the pitches and sometimes decides what type of pitch the pitcher should throw. If a runner on base tries to steal any other base, the catcher throws the ball to the base, attempting to get them out. :)

1UID5JtNaa	Nike Free is designed for runners who land flat footed or on the forefront as opposed to heel strikers.   If you run barefoot it's likely the Nike Free is a good shoe for you.  I am not sure how durable- my experience with Nike in general is they wear out quicker than adidas or asics.  You need to transition into Frees gradually- don't just jump in and use them daily.|`|OHs8yJiOaa	Some people like them. The more recent Nike Lunar Trainers are made from the same last as the Nike Free though, and have probably become more popular than the original Frees. You might want to check them out as well.|`|lSvcX175aa	I use them for like lots of stuff so ya they r great! and comfortable!|`|eVvohzxMaa	I got Nike Pegusus' and they are GREAT! I think they are much better than my Nike Frees|`|OZxv2xPKaa	anything by nike thats a rip off is good.|`|K8ZAnuBHaa	yesss it iss|`|kRJ7Liu4aa	Yes|`|zQS8MjW0aa	it depends on the way you run (if you pronate or supernate) if your foot plant is neither than that would be fine to run in frees. If you do your gonna need more stable shoes. They would be nice to race in (if you don't have spikes, or you are running more than 2 miles) though because they are very light. most running shoe stores can tell you what kind of shoe you need.|`|9Ig4jyT7aa	I bought them a few months ago.  I run almost every day and they're still in great shape.  Overall i think they are a great shoe.|`|PAATM5fFaa	Yes, I think all Nike shoes are great for running.
7SSngsPmaa	It involves being physically fit.<br>  <br>  The exercises and stretches that you do in cheer keep you fit but a big part of it is the nutrition you get. <br>  <br>  I guess you could say it's a sport :] Involves more physical stuff than Poker, Chess, and others that I have no idea why they even call sports.|`|voa0KReTaa	not according to me....|`|KaQfKHkYaa	here think of it this way : football practice, you stretch<br>  throw a ball<br>   run<br>  catch a ball, anyone can do that right?!?<br>  <br>  cheer practice:<br>  stretch<br>  do a backflip<br>  throw girls 19 feet in the air<br>  constantly lift girls in the air<br>  go do some more back flips<br>  add a twist or two to the flip<br>  jump and hyper extent both legs into a "toe touch" position<br>  stretch your legs so that you can hold them back behind your head and under you chin without hands<br>  <br>  and maintain that while haveing to look adorable and femimnine at all times, try both and tell me which one made you feel like you got more of a work out<br>  <br>  yes cheer is deffinitley a sport|`|OrUkclf6aa	YES, I've been a cheerleader for over 4 yrs, and it is a sport. It involves gymnastics, aerobatics and dance.  It's also one of the most dangerous sport out there because of the stunting we do.  In what other sport can you throw a girl 20ft in the air and catch her. This is the one sport where another players life truly remains in the hands of his other teammates. Just because we make our sport cute, doesn't make it any less of a sport ;)|`|PxtmMAMnaa	cheerleading is legally a contact sport. but anyways, i think as long as a team competes, then its a sport. cheerleading is partly gymnastics, and if gym is a sport so is cheer.|`|RwQmN7Reaa	I definitely think it should be considered a sport, you have to be in great physical condition to be a good cheerleader. Some people don't see  it that way but just like any other sport you have to be in shape to get the job done.

4SF4KGu4aa	Most rocket fuel for models is in solid form but made of black powder. When it is in the state of a wet sludge, it is compressed into the engine tube, and  clay or ceramic nozzle is poured on top. When it is dried it is a solid fuel.<br>  <br>  Way back when, they likely did use powder but black powder is very flammable and actually explodes and doesn't burn like modern propellants.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't try grinding or smashing up powder. Black powder is sensitive to compression and can explode. Happens during manufacture process in the plants that make it. That's why they make it wet first , dry it in sheet form and granulate after. Roll caps for toy pistols explode because they are compressed minute amounts of very fine black powder. I would just buy the engines and not try making them. Too dangerous.|`|bSr3WeXNaa	The finer the powder the faster it will burn.|`|aJGAXYUIaa	because they just do|`|yaq7oaH6aa	I don't think you'll listen if I tell you to 'stop before you hurt yourself'.<br>  I didn't when I did that as a kid, so lets try to keep you in one piece:<br>  1.Don't even think about trying to grind black powder.<br>  (Even the pro's in industry have accidents doing this and allow for them.)<br>  The charge of a solid fuel rocket must be formed into a single slow <br>  burning grain, or you get a bomb, not a rocket.<br>  To form & pack your charge, get wood alcohol or another dry, (waterless), <br>  non-polar solvent. Make a thick paste with your powder. <br>  Form that into your charge, and dry it well..<br>  Inspect the charge carefully. <br>  If there are voids or cracks, it's dangerous. <br>  Start over.<br>  Use a long fuse or electric ignition and be well back, and behind <br>  something solid when it goes off.<br>  If you HAVE to watch, use a mirror.
dDhTMacAaa	They would be a 15-win team like last season.<br>  <br>  <br>  The have no depth or defenese and were blown away. They are contending in the East, but are still a year a way at least.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  And actually, most of the reason that he got to 50 was that the game was out of a reach. But that dunk before halftime was absolutely sick!|`|HiuNSScLaa	no where worse than this<br>  <br>  <a href="http://nba.suite101.com/article.cfm/2008_miami_heat_summer_forecast" rel="nofollow">http://nba.suite101.com/article.cfm/2008...</a><br>  <br>  2.0 thanks for the best wade fan on here   : )|`|GERlmBIUaa	that's pretty sad if there was no d-wade than heat < Kings...|`|1AzCDrO6aa	they would likely be in the bottom if wade is not playing.|`|4428a349d91ccc84225a0c79844341a6aa	They would still be a team, but they would be built differently.  Wade is a very rare basketball player, so Miami is forced to build a superstar based team like Cleveland, Lakers.  This type of team does not always work in case of Denver. <br>  <br>  Tough game for the heat tonight.  It would be tough to beat any opponent that is able to make 18 three pointers on you.|`|zqteIV4Qaa	LoL datz funny<br>  hmm......<br>  I think dey probably get moved like what happened to seatlle bcz of the lack of Fan support to a really bad team at the bottom of the league<br>  Luckily they got Wade and there a gud team|`|ISQAWUf2aa	lol member when bynum got injured everyone was like lakers arent gonna play good and stuff now look what they accomplished.Plus kobe was injured when bynum just got injured. so they only had gasol odom and fisher and the bench.|`|E6wEf4sAaa	wade took to many shots it threw the rest of his team off.

But f course they would be one of the worst team in the nba without him|`|9mtMw9Qaaa	THEY WOULD BE THE LIONS OF THE NBA....LOL|`|xhHfXuKFaa	he should ask for a trade.|`|3teWTOPqaa	Tough break. I would be looking up if I am a Heat fan, if J.O can stay healthy he can give you 16pts and 9reb on a nightly basis, if the Heat can sign one more shooter to complement Wade and O'Neal, then you guys have a pretty good combo down there, with Wade slashing and kicking out to shooters or dishing inside to J.O.

tzrLDbHWaa	Not even a chance.  His first year he was out with injuries.  This is technically his 2nd year, but only his first year playing, and he's awful.  So, he's technically still considered a rookie this year, and he isn't even the best rookie on his team.  Rudy Fernandez is outscoring him.  9 ponts 7 boards and 1 block isn't what you hope for when you're the #1 overall pick.  He's young and could get better, but he's going to need to get a lot better to even be a decent player, whereas you have the likes of Durant who's already a star.  <br>  <br>  Maybe Sam Bowie, but could also go with former #1s Kwame Brown or Michael Olowakandi.|`|SVWxTi3taa	He will be alright. Above average if he can stay healthy throughout his career - which looks highly unlikely. They should have taken Durant but you can't fault them for taking size, especially considering the injury problem wasn't much of  factor until after the draft.<br>  <br>  The Bowie comparison is unfair for two reasons. 1. Oden will probably have a better, longer career than Bowie. 2. A huge part of Bowie being the perceived bust he was is that he was taken ahead of Jordan. Durant will not be Jordan.|`|oMSTg5rQaa	I hope that's not the case, but it sure looks that way. I'm not writing him off though for another couple of years, he's just too big and athletic.<br>  <br>  By the way, the next Bill Russell is Tim Duncan.|`|fAMpj8s2aa	he can be the next great one when it comes to giving bjs. have you seen those lips? hey hey hey!|`|jbXTn7RXaa	yes i hear sam bowie|`|75BjjIEXaa	i think he is sort of overrated.<br>  i mean yes, he has the rebound and unusual quickness for centers,<br>  but hey, shaq, dwight, okur, gasol, J.O. had all those things but what made them really outstanding was their ability to stay consistent during their rookie year. But Greg Oden does not have this. I dont think he will be a SUPER STAR but a decent center (like Bogut) and i totally agree on your idea of Durant. THAT BOY CAN FREAKIN' FLY<br>  My prediction is that future stars will be: Durant, Bargnani, Mo Williams, Villanueva, Mayo and Rose|`|UyPNoXdRaa	The next t-mac or grant hill maybe, injury proned chump!!!|`|1Z0Lmrk1aa	He hasn't looked real good for the most part, but he has shown some moments of brilliance. It looks likes he's going to develop slowly. In all fairness to Oden, the so called experts have no business making comparisons like that.

H3nbC71eaa	I'll second one other answer and say that he would be feuding with The Sandman. For one, if he was in ECW he would have his Indy character that is Straightedge means I'm better than you attitude as a heel. Sandman and his beer drinking was way over with the ECW fans. Imagine how much heat a character like Punks would've gotten against that from the ECW fans.<br>  <br>  Even though he feuded with him in ROH, I could also see Punk feuding with Raven in ECW. Also for the same reasons as in ROH as Punk would hate Raven's lifestyle. I think Punk would've made a phenomenal heel in the original ECW. He would have to be more hardcore, but I'm sure him being able to do a lot of his moves in ECW would make up for that. Punk in ECW is something I would've loved to have seen.|`|xKXu0Qb2aa	The Whole F'N Show - Rob....Van....DAM!<br>  That Would Have Been CLASSIC.<br>  GREAT ECW Extreme Rules Match.<br>  There Would Have Be So Many Kicks & Knees Flyin'...<br>  <br>  <br>  The Sandman Would Have Been AWESOME.<br>  If Only For Gimmick Wise.<br>  Think about it - Biggest Drunk in Wrestling History vs. Straightedge!<br>  "Loser Swaps Lifestyle Match" - Punk Loses , He Drinks! & Sandman Loses , He QUITS Drinking!<br>  <br>  Raven - THE Best Indy Feud Punk EVER Had.<br>  Bring it To the Original ECW & Extreme - Priceless.<br>  I Can't Even Describe How Cool that Would Be!<br>  <br>  Also - Taz & Tommy Dreamer.<br>  The 2 Faces of the Original ECW - Plus Punk , GREAT Matches.<br>  Whether it be Brawling (Dreamer) or Technical (Taz) , It Would Have Stolen the Show Any Night.<br>  <br>  <br>  If CM Punk was Around in The Original ECW , It Might have Never Folded.<br>  It Would Have Been a Privilege to Witness.|`|mJvZhdAuaa	Raven, especially during the whole Flock thing.

S0VK07o3aa	Any of the three cleats are suited to a central midfield position like yours however, each of them boast different characteristics which only you can decide suits you most. The first set of cleats is designed for exceptional comfort and touch of the ball. I have these as astroturf trainers and they are VERY comfortable. The second set of cleats is designed for power and is basically a cheaper version of your third choice cleat. Now I actually have your third choice cleat, and not only is it said to give you a more powerful shot but I have found them to be very comfortable also. Going on what I have said I would recommend the third choice cleats because I am confident they will last much longer than your second choice, however if touch AND comfort are very important to you as a socce|`|33svYBUraa	The first ones.

D2CC2t0kaa	Because they dont play D|`|tzrLDbHWaa	I don't think its really Nash's falut, the team as a whole doesn't play D.  They have an up-tempo fast paced offense and they just try to outscore their opponents, so there are more shots taken, more points scored as a whole, so its more likely that youre going to score a career high in a 140-132 game rather than a 89-83 game.|`|piZ4xDBqaa	The whole team needs to learn to play defense.  Don't single Nash out for the blame.  The Suns are playing basketball the way they've been coached to, which means lots of running and shooting and not a whole lot of defense.  Players can't learn to play defense unless their coaches commit to it and spend the time it takes to teach it and practice it.|`|3BHmXNacaa	the suns don't even know the word defense.  I don't think it is in their vocabulary.  THe fact of the matter is, if you run such a fast paced offense, you should play a little defense.  Every time I check their score, their over 110 points.  Why play defense at all? just give the other team the ball at half court, or just give them the points.|`|WT8CbURxaa	Fast paced, no defense system = more possessions for both teams.<br>  <br>  More possessions for both teams = more points.<br>  <br>  More points = more career highs.|`|75nQwsVPaa	they give up so many career highs because every1 knows that the Suns can't play defense|`|Z6ULDFKlaa	but then again, he did win mvp twice didn't he... defense isn't the suns style.. they tried it this year with terry porter and well that didn't get them too far. they traded raja bell, their best defender. its kindof obvious that the way the suns win games is through offense not defense. and players have to get a career high against someone....lol

3d2ce992f7a4d06120c7b88f85ef2ee1aa	Definitely they use maybe not to the extent of MLB or the NFL but you people need to educate yourselves...not all steroids are bulking agents, there are performance/strengthening agents that do not bulk you up but will help you skate faster/longer as well as shoot harder/faster. <br>  goalies would get a huge advantage from the leg strength/foot speed as well as glove speed.<br>  Now I do not think its a major problem like in the NFL or MLB but it IS being used...I know some college players that have used so why wouldn't a pro?|`|7VPw1QNlaa	no, steroids in hockey would hurt a hockey players game because in our sport we need finesse based skill (aim and timing) however in other sports like baseball they want muscle strength to hit the ball as hard as they can.  additionally the most players play in the world cup every year and the Olympics every 4 where there are extreme measures used to make sure no one has used any performance enhancing substances|`|4n89Ou6Caa	No,maybe an extremely small percentage in all of hockey, and even smaller in the NHL. The only areas where it would help you are in hitting and slap shots. WIth that being said look at those two skill areas.<br>  In hitting, the steroids would slow you down, making it harder to play the body because you cant get to the guy you want to hit.<br>  In shooting, the steroids would give you added power but you would sacrifice the accuracy that you have spent to many years perfecting.<br>  <br>  Anyone who is smart enough to be in the NHL is smart enough to not use roids.|`|0XTSsephaa	I'd say amphetamines are more likely, that and painkillers.<br>  <br>  I am sure they are in Basketball and Football however.  Though there might be hockey players juicing...|`|MiWKmKgvaa	I thought Sean Hill got busted a couple years back?<br>  <br>  But there really is not a use for it in hockey.  Baseball, you dont need blazing speed, or there isnt a long period of time with strain on your muscles, so steroids can give you a positive outcome.  But steroids cause tendons and muscles to tear easily.  With the streneous stuff such as corner battles, body checks, and the all around effort given while o n the ice, it would result in a player being more injury proned than Forsberg and Tim Connely combined.  Also, bulk is not what you want in the NHL.  You want more lean muscle.  You want strencth, but being bulging is just not something a hockey player needs. You need to be graceful and strong.|`|UzhfaJH2aa	I would have to think that as long as the impression remains that steroids could lead to bigger, longer lasting paycheques, there will be those who risk getting caught. Unlike baseball though, hockey's star rely more on skating ability than strength and I can't see how steroids would make for a better skater. I can see where it might help out the enforcers and the grinders more than the star players.<br>  One other reason I doubt there is rampant use in the NHL is due to the high percentage of Canadian players. How would like to go home and find out you're being held responsible for sending Don Cherry off on another rant. Your summer would be a living hell.|`|dhs9QBMoaa	It was probably more prevalent during the hook-and-hold years (before the lockout).  Think of the size of some of the players a few years ago.  You didn't need any speed when you could hook or grab guys, so size was the most important thing for a player.  Guys were probably 'roiding up back then to stay as big as possible.<br>  The rule changes since the lockout have made immobile defensmen obsolete.  I suppose steroids can help you develop better speed as well, but I doubt that it is happening in today's NHL.  The backlash from MLB is probably scaring the 'roids out of the other sports.<br>  Or more likely, it's speeding up the development of masking agents to hide performance enhancing drugs.|`|sqeWNMbuaa	There probably is - if players use illegal sticks (cough, Ovechkin in the past did) why not drugs. I hope players don't, but there could be, some where hidden in the dark, a player or two who do take performance enhancing drugs and cheat.<br>  <br>  Edit: Light Bulb! Remember a Ranger's prospect named Alexi something (forgot his last name) drafted in 2008 and who died sometime last October. A sad story, a player so young died on the bench during the middle of a game in Russia. At first the officials there said that it was seizure. After farther investigation the officials later said that he had been taking performance enhancing drugs for the past month or so. It was too bad they don't have the best medical care in Russia (at the arena), for if that seizure happened in North America the results would be different.  But, that was just a case of drugs use in hockey I just remembered about.|`|eUbldFuOaa	sad to say, there probably has been some steroid use in all of the major sports, NHL included. The good thing now is that i dont think we are gonna have that problem anymore. With all that has happened to MLB, if anyone gets caught using steroids (in any sport) it's a huge deal, a big fine, and possibly being able to never play again. That should keep alot of athletes off the "juice".<br>  <br>  boooo de-twat red wings.|`|zgPr8HQyaa	It wouldnt surprise me if there was some steroid use to aid in recovering from injuries.  The schedule in hockey is brutal for such a physical game.  That being said, I dont think its anywhere near out of control, nor being used as a performance enhancer.  <br>  <br>  Who knows though, I havent heard any reports nor do I know the testing policy in the NHL, I hope there's not though.|`|axxQzOCHaa	I hope the NHL is steroid free = I have heard from a friend who used to play in the AHL some of the guys use supplements (I've seen some "sniff" something under their nose, kind of like when a trainer uses "smelling salts" when one is KO'd) but I seriously doubt the problem in our sport even pales to that of the other leagues.|`|Pc0QjrQ4aa	Because hockey is the only major team sport that has Olympic participation in the course of a normal season (MLB does not release teams, NBA is in their close season during the summer games), they are being tested based on IOC standards.<br>  <br>  Most players are smart enough to realise that using steroids is going to cause a positive test.  <br>  <br>  Now it's time to go skipping over land mines...namely, HGH.<br>  <br>  I don't know of a currently administered test for HGH.  So I suppose what we have here is a very difficult situation.  I don't know if players are using HGH or not.<br>  <br>  Baseball...they never tested in the 1990's, and only started testing at the point where it became ridiculous.<br>  <br>  Hockey has had very few players test positive for PED's (Sean Hill, I believe, tested positive a year or so ago...don't quote me).<br>  <br>  Has conditioning and recovery methods gotten better in the last 10 years?  Absolutely.  Guys are on year-round conditioning programs, and even after games, they're on the bike (getting the lactic acid out of their muscles).  They eat better.  They're fitter (they're all in great shape).  They don't go out on the tiles nearly like they used to.<br>  <br>  Can I say with certainty that none of them are cheating?  No.  I don't really know.<br>  <br>  The elephant in the room, however, is Human Growth Hormone (HGH).<br>  <br>  Edit-someone mentioned painkillers; it's fairly reasonable to say that, come May/June, a lot of guys are getting shots before games.|`|fB4RfiCgaa	For those saying that there aren't steroids in hockey because you need speed/stamina have not been following track, or cycling. Steroids would help most any player in hockey. They are even looking at stronger testing policies in tennis. I don't know if it is used in hockey, but if it were, I would not be surprised.|`|UADHt07Zaa	For the most part, hockey is about creativity and strategy, which doesn't come from having really strong muscles but a good head on your shoulders.  I hope that the game is completely clean but, for the most part, I'd say that the players are steroid-free.|`|c4b596d15eac948f611f72b6a99f85a0aa	It wouldn't shock me, but I don't believe it's nearly as bad as MLB or anything.<br>  <br>  It's just the nature of the game that skill players make it to the NHL and contact is something bred into players from a young age.|`|l5CKKXD3aa	Nope. If they had all that muscle and stuff, they wouldn't be as nimble as they should, and probably couldn't skate.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  btw... GO WINGS '09!!!
yxodOu2Caa	Wow.  For a second I thought you were going to school here in the US.  Maybe going to a basketball school or playing with big name or relatively good college prospects.  But, when you said Canada jeez.  I'm not saying Canadians can't ball, you have NBA greats such as: Todd MacCulloch (sucks), Joel Anthony (also sucks), Mike Smrek (sucks again).  The list goes on and on for a total of 16 players!  I'm not mentioning Steve Nash, Dalembert or even the great Rick Fox because they weren't even born there.  <br>  <br>  I hate to admit it, but you got almost ZERO chance of making it to the NBA.  Unless you turn yourself into some elite PG by your senior year.  If you can't even beat out people on your own basketball team for a spot then I really don't see you even playing in college.  Let alone having an NBA team use their 2nd round 30th overall pick on you. I think I have a better chance of creating a cure for cancer than you do at playing in the NBA.  <br>  <br>  What your parents and friends are doing is what every parent says to their kid when they're feeling down.  They try to lift you up.  But, in your case you're taking it too literal.  Maybe your parents have never watched NCAA college basketball or even American HS basketball games.  You should tell them to watch some games and see if they think our skill is up to par with that.  If they say yes.  Then they're just lying to you.  I think you should come to terms that if you're not on the HS basketball team something is wrong.  Your game is NOT up to par with what it should be and that your teammates are LEAGUES better than you.  <br>  <br>  I think you should try and improve on what criticisms your former teammates gave you and then try out for the team again.  If you fail to make the team again I think it's time to just throw in the towel.  And face the fact that you have NO CHANCE at playing CBA, NCAA and or Canadian college.  Let alone playing in the Dleague or NBA. I still think even if you were to make the team that you'd  have zero chance at any of the organizations I just mentioned.  <br>  <br>  Maybe the best you'll ever be is beating 50 year olds at the local YMCA gym.  Honestly.  You should get bigger.  You're 6'2 and 166 pounds? are you serious?  That's so skinny!  Maybe that's why you're having trouble playing basketball.   I think it's time for you to just change your focus.  It'll help you in the long run at chasing an impossible goal.  Or it might give you the drive to succeed more.  <br>  <br>  Tell your parents, 'thanks' for the wishful thinking and that they should go back to their imaginary castle in the sky.  Who knows.  If you really want to work in the NBA I suggest you try working in the offices.  But, as for playing I don't think so.|`|b4EAwNCYaa	Don't count on an NBA or college future if you aren't on your high school team. I encourage you to tr out and go as far as you can.

This happens a lot (see: terrible singers on American Idol who's family say they're great).<br>  <br>  I would suggest playing basketball for fun, but keeping a more realistic future in mind.<br>  <br>  Edit: I suppose the "additional information" is directed to me.<br>  <br>  You and I (and everyone else) knows that family will encourage you know matter how unrealistic things are.  You and I also know that some people, and I'm not saying your family do this but there are people that do, that try to push their children to do certain things for their own benefit.  Just think of all the stories about mothers or fathers pushing their children to do things like act or do beauty pageants when the children don't really want to.<br>  <br>  When you don't play with "good players" because they're better than you, that's a pretty tell tale sign that you aren't cut out for the a basketball career, much less an NBA career.<br>  <br>  There are 30 teams in the NBA with a maximum of 15 players on the team.  That's a MAXIMUM of 450 players in the NBA.  The world population is about 6.7 billion.  That means that NBA players make up about .000000067% of the population.  That ALONE gives you a VERY small shot, but to not have the ability to go up against high school competition pretty much seals your fate.<br>  <br>  Go ask them why they think you have a shot at the NBA when you high school players "make a loser out of you," and tell me what they say.|`|Lxj6kMklaa	Play hockey and be goalie.

C'mon seriously) He needs to fight Liddell, or Wanderlai, or Jardine, Babalu, Shogun, at least these guys are upper level LH's but I certainly don't see him beating Rampage or Machida or Evans, I'm way tired of his phony title as best pound for pound fighter when he's beaten no-one but Franklin and Henderson.|`|E563RzW2aa	Hmm after Leites (if he hypothetically wins, which is like an over 90% chance)<br>  <br>  1.

A lot of accuracy. <br>  Dont do it.|`|OAEuYZkZaa	It won't hurt the gun but it will scatter the pattern all over hell and gone.<br>  <br>  Use a smooth bore barrel if you are going to use shot.<br>  <br>  Doc|`|QrjuueMCaa	What you have there is just plain and simple, a bad idea. Why take the risk of 'possibly' ruining your rifling (probably not with lead, but tungsten or bismuth might), and second, which I can guarantee, is that you wouldn't hit water if you were shooting out of a boat with that setup. Get yourself a smooth barrel and have a successful hunt.|`|0R46pYb3aa	It won't hurt your barrel. Lead shot is much softer than steel.  The worse thing that could happen is some lead fouling that is easily cleane, but that is unlikely since high performance turkey loads have platic shot cups.  The pattern will stink and not make an effective turkey gun.  Rifled barrels are designed to perform with slugs, and sabot slugs in particular.|`|HZvdr8VLaa	I don't understand why you think you need a scope!  If you can't hit a turkey from a normal range without a scope, you need to practice shooting!|`|yaq7oaH6aa	It won't damage the rifling with lead shot, <br>  but your patterning is going to suck ditchwater.|`|dpSr0icwaa	I concur with Doc<br>  <br>  The rifling will spin the shot column as it passes through the barrel, which will cause it to spread out like crazy as soon as it exits the barrel.  This is not good.<br>  <br>  Remember, most 'turkey' chokes are 'extra full' chokes designed to keep a tight pattern at further distances.<br>  <br>  You might as well leave your shells at home when oyu go turkey hunting because unless you are within spitting distance, you aren't going to be able to get a clean kill|`|UQHfRU5eaa	nah... Estrato is correct in what he says. It will simply ruin the rifling in the barrel. It would be an expensive mistake... costing you a nice rifled slug barrel. ALSO.. why would ya want to hunt turkey with a scope anyway? It might be easier to get a nice full choke,smooth bore barrel and simply "point and fire". Just my 2 cents|`|69a47001c8449771a6964bf1c2360497aa	I concur with Doc & AK; just buy a smooth bore barrel from Remington.  I priced them and they were right around $115. new.<br>  <br>  H|`|Xl8CB3oEaa	yeah but it wont hold a pattern like it would with a smooth bore and a choke.|`|BTFFpdeOaa	No,it will damage your rifling!|`|Vakup5Jvaa	no
smcDn76jaa	The WWE released her last year because they felt she wasn't slim enough to be a Diva. It was a disgusting decision.|`|w173betxaa	her and domino got released, cherry got released because she wasn't slim enough|`|mJvZhdAuaa	Evidently she didn't have the figure WWE wants the Divas to have.

It was a damn shame to let her go... but that's the WWE for yah.|`|e19298ebe749b74cc076d9cc6ffa4b88aa	Tony S, I believe you would probably call vickie guerrero someone that got a job because the McMahon family felt guilty or sad for what happened to her husband.|`|GqhfNeGaaa	she got released because she was "fat"  if shes fat, then what is vickie guerrero?<br>  <br>  cherry was smokin hot and i miss herr|`|Rq2BZ2Zeaa	I don't see why they released her. I'm not lesbian, but I seen a clip of her in a WWE bikini contest, and she had a nice body! She was'nt even "fat".|`|U3KAgO0baa	She was realesed late last year|`|ZUTfMc8vaa	she was released but i thought she was great|`|i8W0e6P9aa	she got released cuz she wasn't slim enough to be a diva.|`|SBBNsgKfaa	Man I miss her, she was fine.|`|b7JS16dyaa	I found her very attractive when she put her hair down. Just because her ribs weren't showing through and she actually eats, they released her.<br>  <br>  Who the hell keeps giving random people thumb downs? Get a life...|`|uDh2QX0baa	I saw her compete at an indy show in November. Me and a friend of mine went to the after party.  Got my picture taken with Cherry. (Real name Kara).

561a42dcf730fd97fc3a2ebd788ea961aa	Mahela can re think about his decision and he ought to  change it..........Hopefully,...i wish too,....he will be greatly missed <br>  unfortunately,  dude,..He is too gentleman-type to re-think of  that sort of a thing..<br>  <br>  <br>  SL... jayawewa~|`|yeb7fyHsaa	One think that makes Mahela special is that, no matter what happens, he sticks with his original decision. When he decides to step down from captaincy, he had a very good reason to do so, and he won't turn back. <br>  <br>  If he did, he is devaluing his own word. I'm going to compare this with a NFL player, Bret Farve. Bret Farve is an amazing football (American football) player. But, last season he stated that he would retire. But, he turned around and decided to play again. After this season, he again said that he would be retiring, but no one paid attention, because no one believed him. <br>  <br>  I think that it is best that Mahela continues straight down his planned path|`|bHheiqY6aa	I do not think so! and it is good, once decided that is the final.<br>  I feel that it is good for srilankan team also, especially their middle order is very weak now. In this series M.Jayawardana's mind is clear and he doesn't have a burden of captaining. He can purely concentrate batting and the srilankan team will gain momentum.<br>  If sankakara able to bat well after being a captain, that should be fine for srilankan team. If he fails while as a captain, then there is a question mark!!<br>  Only time will answer.<br>  Cheers|`|M57aHEBnaa	i think mahela does not considers his decision again|`|BJNWnzDIaa	It was just a blue moon day for him so don't expect this kind of performance again from him. It doesn't matter whether he is a captain or not he'll always be an abysmal cricketer.<br>  <br>  Is Mahela a Mahila?|`|va8quhPtaa	I do not think so.|`|0OhQx2kvaa	no mahila is panchod he cheat to score runs<br>  now pakistan wil out him for 0 pakistan has best bowlrs|`|AA11088802	thinking of relief after this series helps him to do this... and he should not consider his decision.. and serve srilanka as a member|`|e7f9613d5b480e9758d037bfe66ac6b9aa	no

Too many people have Polamalu's|`|7oZv4KMhaa	AP everyone has Steeler jersey's since the won the SB.<br>  but if you wanna really turn heads get a Vick Jersey.|`|uU15o7Mbaa	All Day Peterson is the jersey to go with|`|yg3Pveakaa	Get Polumalu jersey and grow the same hair..that would be awesome..|`|oNFB8mFCaa	Long time Viking fan here i would say go with All Day Adrian because i have one:-P but, i know y u want polamalu i was thinking of gettin a defensive player myself. There are much better defensive players if thats the way you wanna go, James Harrison, Jared Allen, Joey Porter, the throwback cowboys jerseys are also nice if u wanna go with demarcus Ware, or u can w8 a month or so because Albert Hanesworth is gunna get a nice large wad of cash as well as lengthy contract so that is also a good choice because u wont get stuck with something thats gunna be possibly useless in a year.|`|agPn1LyCaa	adrian peterson, he's the bomb. i think ppl will defiantely turn heads when they see number 28. but a polamalu jersey would  be good too though.|`|qnREirWSaa	Adrian peterson broke rushing yard record probowler mvp all in one year too good troy is good but AD is too sick|`|54587a005ce491d9b4862a09ef7af9acaa	the BEAST Himself. <br>  Brandon Jacobs!!!|`|He86Nv7Iaa	Both!|`|qU78Ng3yaa	I think you should get BOTH

KdhNCnEjaa	The Detroit fans should start crossing out Millen on their famous shirts in favor of Curry|`|hkzGYQD4aa	Yes, he definitely needs to be fired. The Pistons were a dominating team in the East until this season. I don't understand why they fired Flip Saunders in the first place.|`|F65Km3Coaa	yeah,they are getting demolished|`|1Z0Lmrk1aa	I'm going to call the shot and say he gets fred tonight.|`|P93I8CHtaa	honestly,thats like making a big deal out of it,take some time,then they will be back to their old selfs|`|Zt1VDawZaa	yeah I mean they use to be so good.|`|4op3MIwjaa	Definitely!!  The Cavaliers blew out the Pistons tonight and it was partially because of Curry's coaching. He probably will and should get fired sooner or later. The team does not have good communication, chemistry and overall they are not the same Pistons team they were a couple of years ago. Most of it is because of the A.I. (Allen Iverson) and Chauncey Billups trade.The trade is helping The Nuggets, however not the Pistons. Seriously...the coach has to do something about the team. They just lost six straight and are probably going to lose some more because they have a long and hard road trip in front of them with Miami, New Orleans, Orlando and Boston coming up!|`|ED7bwcdnaa	Pistons needs Avery Johnson|`|NzS7yD32aa	Its not the coach its the PLAYERS. but I agree he needs to be fired. they need a veteran coach.|`|8zJy3jeOaa	I do!!!

oAjbBLDpaa	I think they will combine them. The tag team division is dying, one championship is the best move for the company right now.<br>  <br>  BQ: Yes, they are probably the greatest WWE tag team since Edge and Christian and the Hardyz in my opinion|`|mJvZhdAuaa	Technically, if Miz and Morrison won the WWE Tag Team Championship, they would be the Undisputed Tag Team Championship (just as Jericho was the Undisputed Champion.)  <br>  <br>  WQ: Since Miz and Morrison aren't winning (this is just to further the storyline with Miz and Morrison and The Colons) then it doesn't matter.<br>  <br>  BQ: Miz and Morrison don't deserve to be the first Undisputed Tag Team, and WWE won't give them that, I mean, come on, they didn't even televise the match where they won!  This honor should go to people who've been in the business for a very long time, and who've actually proven themselves.  People like The Hardy Boyz (hey, a fan can dream of a reunion!), The Brothers of Destruction, Edge and Christian, and for damn sure, DX!|`|w173betxaa	I think Miz and Morrison should win because the tag teams right now suck really badly!|`|SsodRf4kaa	Yup I saw the spoiler. They are  going to lose.|`|uEfoR5BLaa	What's the point? The tag division hasn't been popular since 2007.|`|H3nbC71eaa	Now I know next time I post a question I'm going to include don't post spoilers as an answer.<br>  <br>  My guess is they would combine the titles...and use one pair of the belts. Or they would have Miz & Morrison walk around with the 4 belts...and when they have the new belts as a pair they would give them those. I personally think there's no need to have 2 tag titles with a division that isn't that deep. If they had just 1 tag titles the division would seem a bit better.<br>  <br>  BQ: I think so, currently in the WWE I don't see anybody else deserving of that, besides them it would be Primo and Carlito.|`|b7JS16dyaa	I won't comment on the match since it involves spoilers, but I think WWE should just combine the titles since there aren't enough credible teams anymore to have two.<br>  <br>  WQ: They should just keep one pair and ditch the other, or make new ones.<br>  <br>  BQ: It would give them a major thing to boast about, which would help these future stars a great deal, so I say yes.|`|a45ffb40e1ff08eda37fb35f65c6eecaaa	morrison got his start as a tag team wrestler. then he had a brief success as a singles guy. now he is a tag guy again. so out of him and miz i think he would be more deserving than miz. miz is a golry hog and a spotlight hog. got HIS start on MTV. he hardly has any qualifications as a champion wrestler.|`|22f82d8d45e6cb20bd3007cf1b7900f2aa	SPOILER:<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Well I was at the event and it didnt happen, the Colons win so I dont know what would have happened if Miz and Morrison won|`|86kZ5uYwaa	Wq- No, I think they will keep them seperate.<br>  <br>  BQ- Yes, they are a great tag team with great chemistry. Not to mention they both have good mic skills and in ring ability.|`|MoxE1thxaa	ithink they will be combined but not yet maybe they will wait till wrestlemania and have like a fatal four way ladder match for da titles<br>  cuz da tag team division is dying so their is no need for two|`|YCqpmxF7aa	WWE NEED A GREAT TEAM FOR LAST CHAMPIONS : HARDYZ OR CHRISTIAN & EDGE|`|NZKramllaa	WQ: They will combine them. It will make the Tags Division more Interesting and SD has too many Titles as of right now. They may make the Tag-Belts part of ECW since its Improving but that's If Miz and Morrison Win.<br>  <br>  BQ: IMO, I think The Colons are a way better Tag, but I guess So, Miz and Morrison are One of the Hardest workers in WWE they basically Wrestle on Every Brand So it wouldn't Hurt.
rS0fpPyjaa	It sounds like you're trying shove-its backwards.  Your front foot is on the nose.  You push down on the nose, making the back wheels go up, then kick the board around with your back foot.<br>  <br>  You need some momentum to do them, so trying them on the carpet isn't going to help you at all.  Might as well use a fingerboard in the kitchen sink.|`|FLmHlYP3aa	just pretend u r on carpet then just do it      if u fall get back up and do it  again

I'm here with ya dude!!!<br>  <br>  However, Kenseth does deserve it as well.. great crew peeps hes got.. great crew.. that won him that race.. For now, I give it up to Matt Kenseth.. he's got a really good run so far.. 2-2.. thats A-mazing!|`|AA11971891	I love Jeff Gordon he is number 1 but I also love Matt Kenseth. He is my<br>  second favorite driver and has been for awhile.<br>  <br>  The race was great. I really liked the fact that my 2 favorite drivers were<br>  up there practically the whole race and that Dale Jr. had a bad day!<br>  <br>  Seriously, Matt Kenseth is the most underestimated driver out there.<br>  He is a great driver. He is consistent. He is a past champion, he has made the chase each year it has been around, he won the Daytona 500<br>  and now made a record for himself by winning Daytona and the next race in California. ( the last to do that was Jeff Gordon).<br>  <br>  So, Kenseth is in a league with the greats like Jeff Gordon.|`|bB3f4duZaa	Wins again?  He didn't win last week, he had it handed to him.  They should have finished that race or atop catering to the west coast and started the race earlier since the knew rain was in the forecast.  I guarantee he wouldn't have won the full distance.|`|3e1ELOgnaa	The last part of the race was awesome! Man my blood was pumping and I was really rooting for Jeff to pull off the victory but Kenseth was just a little better and deserved the win. Great way to start off the real season!

Great job by the bees and off to Vegas!|`|r5JwUTfPaa	YAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! GO KENSETH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 44 for the 24.|`|IrGapExUaa	I love it Matt Kenseth is my Favorite driver i have a Autograph of him when he raced in the ASA. He's a great driver and I"m sooooo happy that he won 2 in a row after not winning any last season. I think Kenesth is going to have a good season. Him and his new Crew Chief seems to hit it off good and lets not forget the 2nd half of the season Ford will have a new Motor they run and the ford teams are saying they have more Horsepower with the new motors i think Kenseth could be the man winning the championship this season.|`|bBFiiSG2aa	It was a good race. Kenseth won the race on pit road. His pit crew got him out first and that's what got him the win because his and Jeff's cars were almost equal. I was dissapointed that Jeff didn't get the win but seeing him run up front is so exciting. Can't wait for Jeff to win.|`|nQxSAhNvaa	I'm happy for Matt, he's been great. I'm sad that Jeff didn't win, but boy is he racing better. The way he was racing tonight, wow! I'm eager for next Sunday, Jeff's gonna get a win real soon. He's so determined to. This year is gonna be awesome!<br>  =)|`|eUNltGswaa	i thought the race was pretty good....minus the cautions for rain. lol. Matt wins again!! I love it!! I think he is going to go for the championship again!! <br>  <br>  WAY TO GO MATT!!!!|`|T1btuxBBaa	I am optimistic because yes he is off to a strong start but will he continue this start and motivation during the whole season.|`|MYC6Xv1Xaa	Jeff was patient the whole race and was sooooooo close to break his winless streak.Congrats to Matt though.Man,I wanted Jeff to win so bad.|`|VxN4tnJtaa	it was a good race, he definitely earned the win.|`|8ef867d45425e1bc31fb8258b0b7207aaa	Pissy, I wanted Jeff to win tonight. The man has not won since 2007|`|5FgfNndWaa	excellent but i wanted paul menard or dale jr casey mears or travis kvapil to win|`|9fAIXQeQaa	He's got the best crew chief in NASCAR!!<br>  <br>  Sorry Johnson fans, Chad Knaus is now 2nd best.|`|emKcof02aa	bull crap i wanted kyle bush and tony stewart to win|`|Crzpl2fiaa	I'm happy for him|`|EfVlOfmYaa	I am really happy he has won the first two races! He is gonna be strong when the chase starts I think!|`|mIdcJEJNaa	The race was one of the best that Cali has ever had..<br>  It went just as I expected, with Matt in front, but it wasn't <br>  a fuel economy run, it was a race.. If anyone was watching<br>  lap times, Matt had them covered all day..<br>  When he got the lead for the last time, he used a little more<br>  of his car.. Matt had something left all day.. I believe he could<br>  have gone faster at the end, if he had to..<br>  Jr went from last to 13 before losing an engine.. Tony Eury messed<br>  up, and almost got him lapped, by waiting too long on the pit stop<br>  that put him up to 14th.. He should have pitted when Harvick did, not with Jeff, and Jimmie because he was racing Harvick.. He was giving up ten mph to the cars that pitted six, or seven laps sooner.. When pit stops were done, those cars were in front of him..|`|21cf85dc961b3d03a8c5bb2f231c50aaaa	I am happy for Matt he is a great driver and is hands down one of the best in the field! Jeff did a good job too I like his new and improved attitude after the race is over! The guy I feel sorry for is Jr. he is clearly the odd man out on that team and he bit off more than he can chew. It really shows that he is not the driver that his daddy was or is he as good as the 24 or 48. Anyway its good to see Matt drive a Ford to victory 2 races in a row!|`|f8531989672c18c4535bcda561ab4073aa	well he earned this one. Daytona was just luck .. The rain came at the right time after some  better teams gambled a pitted  for tires and gas. Who would  ever guess NASCAR would call the race after 16 minutes.  Also this is a strong track for Kenseth .. I don't look for his success to continue. Besides it don't really count till the final 10 just ask Kyle Bush.|`|u4liwDhAaa	It was a good, solid race.  (We didn't have to put up with rain delays!)  Congrats to Matt and Jeff.  They both did well.|`|wMHw20WPaa	so mad i wanted martin truex jr.
AA11570394	Don’t let the name calling get to you. Every single one of them was a kid at one time, that cried their eyes out over something.<br>  <br>  I understand how important a knife is for hunting, camping and wilderness survival. I am in my mid 50’s and have some very expensive knives but find myself using some cheap ones more often than the high dollar ones. In fact my favorite butchering knife is a cheap carbon steel Old Hickory knife from Ontario Knife Company.<br>  <a href="http://www.ebladestore.com/knives/OH-77.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ebladestore.com/knives/OH-77....</a><br>  Many of my friends own several knives from that company here in Alaska. I mean Alaskan trappers, hunters and big game guides. That company also makes knives for the US Military.<br>  <br>  The knife you selected will do for starting out. But I would consider a better quality steel so it will hold an edge. Looks are not important, what is important is good steel and a good handle.  <br>  Beware of those cheap survival knives many of them will not hold an edge and break at the worse time.<br>  <br>  Here are some more I found for you to consider;<br>  <a href="http://www.cabelas.com/cabelas/en/templates/links/link.jsp?id=0043338517691a&type=product&cmCat=SEARCH_all&returnPage=search-results1.jsp&Ntk=Products&sort=all&Go.y=14&_D%3AhasJS=+&Nty=1&hasJS=true&No=90&Ntt=+Knife+&N=0&_D%3Asort=+&Go.x=9&_DARGS=%2Fcabelas%2Fen%2Fcommon%2Fsearch%2Fsearch-box.jsp.form1&_dyncharset=ISO-8859-1" rel="nofollow">http://www.cabelas.com/cabelas/en/templa...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/Ontario-Knife-Co-OK6150-Air-Force-Survival_W0QQitemZ350011557785QQcmdZViewItemQQptZKnives?hash=item350011557785&_trksid=p3286.c0.m14&_trkparms=66%3A2%7C65%3A1%7C39%3A1%7C240%3A1318" rel="nofollow">http://cgi.ebay.com/Ontario-Knife-Co-OK6...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/VIETNAM-MAC-SOG-COMBAT-KNIFE_W0QQitemZ300289840432QQcmdZViewItemQQptZLH_DefaultDomain_0?hash=item300289840432&_trksid=p3286.c0.m14&_trkparms=66%3A2%7C65%3A1%7C39%3A1%7C240%3A1318" rel="nofollow">http://cgi.ebay.com/VIETNAM-MAC-SOG-COMB...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/Winchester-by-Gerber-Fixed-Blade-Knife-w-Wood-Handle_W0QQitemZ280315212686QQcmdZViewItemQQptZAU_Hunting?hash=item280315212686&_trksid=p3286.c0.m14&_trkparms=66%3A2%7C65%3A1%7C39%3A1%7C240%3A1318" rel="nofollow">http://cgi.ebay.com/Winchester-by-Gerber...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/Two-Used-Buck-119-fixed-blade-knives-w-sheath_W0QQitemZ310123730801QQcmdZViewItemQQptZLH_DefaultDomain_0?hash=item310123730801&_trksid=p3286.c0.m14&_trkparms=72%3A1205%7C66%3A2%7C65%3A12%7C39%3A1%7C240%3A1318%7C301%3A0%7C293%3A3%7C294%3A50" rel="nofollow">http://cgi.ebay.com/Two-Used-Buck-119-fi...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/CT20-Colt-Trail-Scout-Hunting-Knife-fixed-blade_W0QQitemZ110065079987QQcmdZViewItemQQptZKnives?hash=item110065079987&_trksid=p3286.c0.m14&_trkparms=66%3A2%7C65%3A1%7C39%3A1%7C240%3A1318" rel="nofollow">http://cgi.ebay.com/CT20-Colt-Trail-Scou...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/NEW-Smith-Wesson-S-W-Knives-Large-Hunting-Knife-SW970_W0QQitemZ200310911226QQcmdZViewItemQQptZLH_DefaultDomain_0?hash=item200310911226&_trksid=p3286.c0.m14&_trkparms=66%3A2%7C65%3A1%7C39%3A1%7C240%3A1318" rel="nofollow">http://cgi.ebay.com/NEW-Smith-Wesson-S-W...</a>|`|8ivnzNi5aa	You get what you pay for, of course.

DONT get a folder.<br>  Trust me, get a fixed with the blade running through the handle.<br>  If seen crappy $30 knifes when the blade doent run through the handle snap in half if you try to f=do anything use ful with them, like try to pry open a box or cut down a small tree.<br>  A KA-BAR is an excellent brand, ive have a few, and have had no problems, it keeps and edge for a long time, but this makes it hard to sharpen, which i use a block for bcause all the factory shapeners ive used dont put as sharp a edge as i like. Same with SOG knifes. there both military spec knifes and i assure you you wont have any problems with them.<br>  Take a look at this knife. Its the one i'm going to buy next.<br>  It's mainly for survival but i bet you it would gut a deer just fine.<br>  <a href="http://www.sogknives.com/store/F03T.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.sogknives.com/store/F03T.html</a><br>  Her it lists it at $63 but Cabelas has it for $40.<br>  Also check out a KA-BAR<br>  <a href="https://www.kabar.com/product_detail.jsp?productNumber=1236&mode=category&categoryId=2,3,7&categoryName=Hunting/Sporting" rel="nofollow">https://www.kabar.com/product_detail.jsp...</a><br>  If you want to learn more, send me a message.<br>  Im happy to help.<br>  P.S. BREWMEISTER<br>  This is a webpage for answering question, if you get tired of it, get off ASSHOLE!!!<br>  We all have the right to ask as many as we want. It's YOUR choice to answer.<br>  DUMBASS!!!|`|yTkNT3OSaa	If your budget is that low then your ONLY choice is a Mora of Sweden knife.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.moraofsweden.se/index.php?cid=321&ssel=14" rel="nofollow">http://www.moraofsweden.se/index.php?cid...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.moraofsweden.se/index.php?cid=320&ssel=14" rel="nofollow">http://www.moraofsweden.se/index.php?cid...</a><br>  <br>  I know they don't look much, but if you want a good blade at that price, then you just have to put up with plastic handles/sheaths. They are the best knife for the price, no doubt about it. Extremely easy to learn to sharpen with too (you'll also want a good sharpening stone/system, otherwise your knife [any knife] is useless after a day of hard use).<br>  <br>  When you start looking to buy bigger blades, or better 'furnature' materials at that price you're taking a serious hit on build and blade quality; you won't be able to get a sharp edge on those knives, and any edge you do get will wear down very quickly, and the knives will probably fall apart under stress.<br>  <br>  You really don't need a bigger blade than 4" for hunting.|`|AA10232540	I like it.  It's clean and simple looking and it's a good design for a blade.  Great handle to blade lines, nice big belly for skinning, flat ground....all highly desirable in a skinner.<br>  <br>  I'd like it better if I could find out the steel type, but at that price I'd be willing to give it a try.  It appears, just from eyeballing it mind you, to probably be 420 J2.  While not the greatest (far from it) at holding a long-term edge, it'll do.<br>  <br>  If it turns out to be pretty decent, you might even think about adding your own wooden scales to the grip.  Maybe some ivory micarta?<br>  <br>  Ghost:  I like your posts, sir....but knives aren't designed to "pry open boxes" or "cut down small trees".  lol  It's that sort of thinking that leads folks to believe a knife must be everything from a prybar to an axe and *still* stay razor sharp....and that thinking destroys perfectly good knives and injures folks.  <br>  <br>  Any time someone asks me for advice on a "survival knife", I always tell them that men, for literally thousands of years, carried a sliver of flint about as long as your thumb.  Only when amateurs started carrying short swords and battle axes to make up for their lack of knowledge did "survival knives" like we see them today start appearing.  A perfect "survival knife" would be a good quality three bladed rancher-type (stockman to some folks) pocket knife.  It'll do anything you could want a knife to properly do.|`|UrNVuFx6aa	The best knife for you is the one that makes you happy. I think this would be a good starter knife; you can improve on it later based on the knowledge gained from this one. Eventually you will find what is best for your situation. Experience will teach you a lot about what makes a particular item "best" under specific circumstances; there is not any "perfect" knife for all situations and you can't carry enough to be prepared for all situations. (I think the first link would be better that the latter; just my opinion).<br>  <br>  Don't worry about the losers on here calling you a loser; they have to make themselves feel good somehow.|`|AA12134477	Just buy a K-bar their $50 so save ur lunch money a few more weeks.
sj8EM9ejaa	i know im really mad this coach is killing the pistons|`|YJIivf2Haa	Well you can thank Dumars for trading Billups. Pistons were better off waiting 2 years for Billups contract to expire and at least continue to be competitive instead of ruining the entire teams chemistry and taking away their floor leader and replacing him with a selfish Allen Iverson. Good luck to you Pistons.|`|8zJy3jeOaa	okay yes I think maybe firing Curry was enough. I live in Michigan and live 30 min outside of Detroit and I have lost faith in them ever since Billups starting losing his touch.

1jmXT4Vvaa	They do sell homeowner type compressors.  They only compress up to about 150 psi.  You need 3000 psi for a paintball gun.  You need a special scuba type compressor, and they cost several thousand dollars.  I have a scuba tank and an adaptor that I use to fill my hpa tank.  I have the scuba tank filled every couple of trips.  It has proven to be the most economical way to go.|`|13bc7214bebe9f20a8000b9480b7b9d7aa	Yes they sell compressors that work to fill your paintball guns, no you cannot get them at Lowes.<br>  <br>  Normal air compressors run about 300psi, to fill a paintball tank you need at least 3000psi.  But, if you want to buy one, you can.  A used one will run you around a grand or more, depending on the variables.  If you are running a field or team, you need to fill to at least 4500psi, so keep that in mind.|`|xMSESsGQaa	Ya they sell them but not specifically for paintball. Check your local harware store for deals.

QrjuueMCaa	Aside from accuracy, sure. Obviously, rifled slugs shoot best out of a smooth barrel, but they will certainly exit the end.|`|dpSr0icwaa	yes you can.<br>  <br>  your accuracy will be LESS than if you used a proper foster type slug, and you waste energy pushing plastic down the barrel, but it would definately work.  About the only time I'd advise it is if you sold your rifled slug gun and have some old sabots lying around and some pumpkins that need to be pulverized.<br>  <br>  Or I suppose if you had an appropriate gauge shotgun and that ws the only ammo you had on hand, it'd definately be better than nothing.  However, it isn't a smart combo.|`|BTFFpdeOaa	I tried shooting sabots through a smooth bore once,and they were not at all accurate, and there were oblong holes in my target,which means they must have been tumbling through the air.<br>  To answer your question,yes!|`|w5DfqQ9Raa	its be inaccurate|`|UrNVuFx6aa	The accuracy is the only real issue. With modified choke there is little chance of damaging the barrel. Improved Cylinder would be better, but isn't really required. Being a smooth bore there will be less accuracy, but out to 100 yards you should be able to hit an 8" circle consistently, with practice. Once you can hit an 8" circle at that range you should have no problem taking deer-size game. Beyond 100 yards the slug drops quickly; I would not risk anything farther without a rifle. <br>  Shoot well and stay safe.|`|8ivnzNi5aa	An open choke would be better, but in a pinch you probably could.<br>  <br>  I'm only guessing.|`|OAEuYZkZaa	The bullet would not spin to stabilize and would probably begin to tumble.<br>  <br>  Doc

The NAB cup games are practice matches but it's better to win them than lose them, you get to play on the better grounds around the country, your club gets exposure on tv, so it makes sense to try to win, it's not the end of the world losing the NAB games just makes more sense to win them.|`|2s244jGgaa	ONE MILLION FOR A NAB CUP?

Motors facing attrition(spelling may be off..lol), pit strategy, fast, passing and the fastest guys are in front.|`|Up2sP3eGaa	trust me, i just got back from there a while ago and it is a parking lot, and a very disorganized one in the middle of craphole of a city that you wouldn't want to get alive in too late at night, and wouldn't want to look at during the light of day. the race year was the best in a long time, but that's not saying a lot.|`|3971fad8bfeb5090ffc3629ffe9dbd80aa	Get rid of Fontana n give The Rock a race and Darlington the other.

Leave us west coast guys something PLEASE!!!|`|61c7b347ba41aac992d85106985e7af9aa	Yes.<br>  <br>  This track along with Vegas, Chicago, Kansas, and Texas make for NAPCAR<br>  <br>  They need to tear it down and build a short track in its place. Or better yet give Darlington their race back and give one to Iowa.|`|BD78ZzYkaa	Tell ya what if ya don't like it don't watch it. Go watch golf or something.

Even though Roush does really good here.|`|iO12Vjnvaa	That's exactly what it'd make! Alot better as a parking lot than a parade route.

It is actually the first time he scored 50 believe it or not. It is his new career high. But we just played lousey defense and we only scored 99 points and Dwade had more than half. We need Wade to get around 28,11,9. When he gets over 45 we usually lose.

Griffey is without question the best all around player I've ever seen. Better than Arod, Better than Bonds before roids and better than Alber Pujols. He played golden glove defense, he'd hit a avg of 45 home runs a season in his prime without juice, bat 300, come up with the clutch hits and he seemed to be such a cool guy. He's the only great slugger of the steroid era that i could guarantee didn't take steroids. I believe if all his injured didn't catch up to him he would have broke all the records that Arod's set to break clean.|`|bK5QIdivaa	Albert Pujols hands down. I don't think people really understand how good he is. He has hit at least 32 HRs, 103 RBIs, and .314 BA every year for 8 years. All Star every year but one, 2 MVPs at only 29 years old, has defense (06 gold glove), while playing for a rather subpar team. Sure bet for 600 HR and unanimous Hall of Fame induction. (little note: won MVP last year with hurt calf). I do agree though that Griffey could have become the greatest if he wasn't injury prone.|`|qAJWFJlqaa	chase utley. great at every piece of the game. hope he wins the nl mvp this year. if he stayed healthy last year, he would have had it.|`|9Yl0PaEDaa	Milton Bradley|`|dAM2o5lTaa	Melky Cabrera....CF for the Yanks<br>  <br>  He's may not be a superstar but he's my fav anyway! =]
7w0a7bOTaa	WOW...  There is a reason not anyone can just be a professional athlete.  Not only is there a certain basic level of natural skill needed, but training, practice, coaching, and dedication are all very important.<br>  <br>  Moving on to the next topic at hand.  Anyone who has never touched a bowling ball before has just a much chance as becoming a professional as someone who wants to be a pro golfer who doesn't know what a putter is.  Professional bowlers have strict diet regiments and workout routines.  They bowl weekly tournaments that last from Wednesday morning through the live televised finals on Sunday afternoon.  Just watching them casually on TV doesn't do them enough justice either.  Anyone who caught this afternoon's telecast of the PBA saw how they used the CATS system to track ball speed and what targets the bowlers were hitting.  Pete Weber in his first game threw 10 strikes in a row to end his game and shoot 269.  During that streak his ball speed was never less than 17.5 mph and never exceeded 18.0 mph.  That's as close to perfection as you can get.  <br>  <br>  All I'm trying to say is that bowlers are often underestimated as athletes, competitors, and people look at bowling as a sport for drunk smokers with beer bellies.<br>  <br>  <br>  No matter what sport you decide to pursue your future athletic goals in, I wish you luck.  Don't be distracted by all the haters out there.  They only hate because they wish they had the skills and abilities that you have.|`|7BHIyMFmaa	Bowling is not a sport. Just because you have that wrist thing doesn't make it a sport. Anything you can do with a cigarette in one hand and beer in the other is not a sport. Anything you get better at as you consume alcohol is not a sport. Judging by the "pros" on ESPN 2, I can safely say that 90% of the population is in equal or better physical shape that these professional bowlers. Even golfers have to at least walk the course. The bowler only has to travel about 5 steps in order to get his/her ball. I highly doubt if you'll ever see a pro-bowler running wind sprints or killing it in the weight room. Bowling is more of an activity or hobby.|`|go6FjwpNaa	Bowling, definitely

Id say more like a technical but i've never actually seen that happen lol and it would be very awkward to. Ive seen Tim Thomas who used to play for the Phoenix suns blow a kiss at Dirk Nowitzki of the Dallas mavericks when they were going at it in the western conference semi-finals a few years ago but nothing happened as a result other than it drawing alot of attention by the media.

fWMzd7y5aa	If LeBron went anywhere the team be instantly good.|`|tzrLDbHWaa	Like many people have said, he already is.  I think that he isn't in the arguement of "best overall" because there are far more Laker and bandwagon Cavs fans (yes, I think the Cavs fans are bandwagoners, I never saw even 1 outside of Cleveland before LBJ, at least there were Laker fans before Kobe) than there are Heat fans.  Also, the fact that the Heat aren't good makes it hard to put him in the "best player" convo, since many would expect that the best player could lead his team to a winning record.  As it is now though, with no team, he's still thought of as the #3 player by most.|`|ZdNSSm0waa	he is in the top 3 anyways....|`|H8u7gMAYaa	I don't know what you are talking about. He is already in the discussion as top 3 player in the game.<br>  <br>  And you saying Wade has never had teammates like LeBron and Kobe is crazy.

Tell them that since its your money and not theirs its your hard earned money that you would be using so it will teach you responsibility by letting you buy this gun by yourself. Ask them if there was ever something they wanted as a kid and when they finally got it how happy they were that they used there own money.

T0FTAeDoaa	yep and the latest he will get drafted is 2nd round i bet|`|lCR8d2hraa	Yes he is a Muslim. He is a really solid wide receiver, not a standout but really solid and reliable. I would think he could possibly be a early fourth round pick, it will be his speed that will scare teams from him as he has run a 4.60 before. He could possibly be a Brandon Stokley/Wes Welker type of receiver as he has great hands, will fight for the ball and is good receiver. Just like Stokley/Welker his speed is the big question mark as that is the only thing limiting his upside.
Z373lUYAaa	You do not know how happy i am right now. i learned to do kickflips perfectly! I've been practicing for about 3 hours a day for 2 months and today, i just tried again thinking, i am going to fail. but i landed it, and now i land it 100% of the time! Here is how you do it:<br>            -First, make sure you can flick it and make it flip first.<br>            -Second, here is how i first learned. try landing it while grabbing    on to something. you will eventually land it.<br>            -Third, once you can do it while grabbing on to something, try it without grabbing something. you will do it after a couple of trys.<br>            -Fourth, to do it while riding, ride towards a grass area, then kickflip and you will land in grass. after not scared, do it without grass.

Consider the worn finish to be a badge of honor ... if you need to carry, then you can look back on each rub and wear mark to show the security your 1911 gave you!<br>  <br>  Never, ever worry about finish wear on a carry gun ... otherwise, you will hesitate to carry it when you really need it!<br>  <br>  Good luck and good shooting!|`|KMASS2Gmaa	Bianchi:<br>   Model 5 – Black Widow<br>  <br>  Finish:<br>  <br>      * Plain Tan<br>      * Plain Black<br>  <br>  Carry:<br>  <br>      * Strongside<br>  <br>  A compact belt slide with the security of a thumb break.

g4MaHuJ0aa	I think he has earned a full time ride.  He runs well and qualifies well.  He often outruns his teammates, as well as MANY other drivers who have full time rides. Unfortunately, he is a victim of the economy.  I think a sponsor will notice and they will be able to run the full season.  At least I hope so. He has a great personality and people should realize he will represent their company well.  He is one of my favorite drivers.<br>  <br>  And, the only reason AJ is currently 39th is because he received a speeding penalty under green.  His team mate, Reed Sorenson, received one under caution.  When they were following the pace car, a lot of teams were complaining that the 2nd pace car was running too fast.  They were both victims of that error made by the pace car driver.|`|LSJyE4d0aa	He is not better than Reed Sorenson, but I do beleive he deserves a full time seat. I think Red Bull dropped a potential awesome talent. He is still learning and last week at Dayton really helped his stock.

Also, the other guys have contracts to run all of the season, that is why they couldn't give the 19 to him.  Plus, the other guys are more experienced and more marketable.<br>  <br>  If I were the owners in RPM and everything lined up(all cars in top 35, and AJ in top 25) I would sponsor him myself for a few races extra.  He would have to be bringing in some money with his finishes.|`|iO12Vjnvaa	Only if he deserves it. My jury is still out.

J9HEPVdaaa	It originated in Australia of course with the Aborinigines. If its too light it won't travel anywhere, if its too heavy you can't throw it fast enough.

nBqZBbtnaa	Given your legs aren't twigs, your muscles probably aren't as coordinated as they could be. Plyometrics is your answer. You should google it and read up but basically find a bench or box or something that's a good 2-3 feet off the ground. Jump up to it and jump back down backwards (you should always be facing the bench). Do 3 sets of 10 on both feet. Jumping back down to the ground, absorbing the impact and then jumping back up should be a fluid motion. Then do sets with one leg, switching off until it burns so bad you can't jump an inch. Then go back to both legs and jump till you can jump no more.<br>  After a 4-6 weeks of doing this every other day you should see a dramatic increase in your vertical. As you get better find a higher bench/box/whatever.|`|7lHt7Af6aa	play taps with the basketball and the backboard<br>  all you do is throw the basketball against the board or a wall, jump and grab the ball then throw it back before touching the ground repeatedly<br>  do this as many times possible<br>  i'm 5 foot 6 and i can touch the rim|`|gM0pk41jaa	Surprisingly alot of people think vertical is all legs but its not all true. WHile increasing leg strength can give you more explosion off the ground...to actually increase your standing vertical you need to work on other areas as well. If you notice some players like Lebron James....it looks effortless when he jumps like his legs don't even give him that much lift...cuz alot of vertical explosiveness actually comes from your hips/waist area. Having explosive hips can enable you to maneuver your whole body more quickly and stronger in both running and jumping. Just watch some of the best dunkers in the nba like vince carter, kobe, lebron etc and you can see them get up off the ground without squatting down or using any leg strength. Also shoulders and glutes can play a role in how much explosive power you have to jump. Google exercises to work on your glutes and hips and you'll see what i mean|`|21XmVm6Zaa	yoga|`|wFnp9ugVaa	Box Jumps.
mMFJrPbvaa	Blast it with your garden hose, if that doesnt work then rent a powerwasher just watch out you dont remove the mortar between the bricks|`|vF5lU8zeaa	If you have a pressure washer it should come right out|`|13bc7214bebe9f20a8000b9480b7b9d7aa	Well, its not so funny, the paintball community has been combating these things for some time now as they have a tendency to be the only aspect of paintball to make the news (never mind all of the money that ends up donated to charities and the life lessons learned on the field or any of the many other positive aspects).<br>  <br>  Here is what you do, get yourself a power washer and get it off.  Do it as soon as you can, don't lollygag around.  Many fields are field paint only (FPO) because some of your less expensive stuff uses inferior materials which will stain bunkers, and I'm sure houses as well.  These bunkers are made to be shot and cleaned and I know field owners who have taken power washers to their bunkers at a foot away to try to get some of the cheap stuff off and are unable.  (Most paintballs made in this country are made from high enough grade materials that they will not do this.)<br>  <br>  If you have problem spots, rubbing alcohol & elbow grease will usually do the trick.|`|sbW7cX0faa	ok the paint inside paintballs is NOT actual house paint or even finger paint. it is mostly grease. and it is biodregradable and completely safe for the enviroment. anyways a powerwasher  should get the paint off, it might have stained the siding so add some soap. if you dont have a powerwasher you could use your garden hose to get it off that should work as well, or wait untill it rains, that worked for me when sum spray hit my wall and fences, only stains left are on the chipboard i shot at.|`|J9HEPVdaaa	Its paint. It doesn't come off. Especially from brick. I guess an insurance company could pay a claim to have a company paid to remove it or paint over it. It will raise their rates I guess but vandalism is that way. Not so funny now I guess...
Z9WVDGDcaa	Thee velocity adjustment should be the big knob on the back of the marker.  There is a hex screw that should lock it into place.  Loosen that screw.  Turn the knob counter-clockwise to decrease and clockwise to increase the velocity.  If that's what you have been adjusting and still can't get the right velocity, the striker spring is probably too strong.  You might need to get a lighter spring.  There might also be a spring shim in there that might need to be replaced or removed.

a4LWildhaa	Daytona and Talladega only. A few years ago, Rusty Wallace under a supervised test at Talladega was going to run ten laps with the restrictor plate not on the engine. On his second lap on the backstretch, he was clocked at 232 mph !!! They flagged him in. Goodyear had no info on NASCAR stock car tires for that speed. Rusty said after it felt like the car was going to launch into the air. <br>  That's why they have restrictor plates, to constrict the airflow into the engine on these 850 horsepower engines.|`|kd9kWB8Kaa	they feel that they go to fast on those tracks and want to slow them down.|`|4l0yGuE9aa	Yes. In the Sprint Cup races Talladega and Daytona are the 2 fastest tracks and the  restrictor plates make the cars go slower so the cars doesn't fly into the stands. Also NASCAR requires some cars in the Nationwide series to run restrictor plates because some cars have newer engine designs that gives them an advantage so they require cars running those engines to use restrictor plates until all cars have submitted their new engine designs. Once everyone submits these new engines in the Nationwide series NASCAR will more than likely allow teams to remove the restrictor plates.|`|NxBljj6Baa	It all started back in the day when Richard Petty was about old enough to start getting Social Security Benefits.  He lost control at Talledega and tore the chain link fence down on the front stretch.  NASCAR couldn't have their Icon driver being killed in a race so they looked to slow the cars down, instead of putting him in a roust-a-bout.  Nascar has worked backwards ever since.  <br>  The guy above me posted about Rusty Wallace and a 232mph, but Bill Elliott turned laps back in 85 testing that was 217mph in a Thunderbird that was the true back breaker...  They not only added a restrictor but outlawed the 351 Clevelands use in NASCAR.  Which was actually a good thing, being the Cleveland blocks were getting so hard to find, they were sapped out of the American circulation and not readily available.  Ernie Elliott was reported to have started buying what is now collector cars and stripping the engines out of them for racing.  They were using stock cast iron blocks back then, not aluminum reproductions like today.  Hence back in the mid and late 80's Ford lost their reign and allowed the Late Dale Earnhardt a foothold into his glory days.  Ford had to begin work on a totally new engine, all in a matter of a few months off of the track during the off season...  <br>  Much like today, the restrictor plates were to do one thing, Focus on a team and slow them down, "Bill Elliott". The Cleveland engine was never going to run a restrictor plate, and NASCAR knew it.  The big heads and valves were made to suck the gas tank through the Carburator and create maximum power.  To put a restrictor plate onto the engine was to run them lean.  Hence Ford blew engine after engine in the plate races...|`|MYC6Xv1Xaa	They used to have them at New Hamshire.|`|jLvlcoFBaa	It's only on the super speedways to keep the cars below 200 mph.

I wouldn't worry about it too much now though, I mean you're a sophomore, you've got a few years left of high school, so work on your all around game, most importantly your shooting as you'll likely be a 2 guard, and definitely your ball handling.

z6pdWKa5aa	If their is any team in the Pac-10 that can challenge USC, it is Oregon, who I predict to go 10-2 in the regular season. They start off at Boise State (props to Oregon for going to the Smurf turf). Their only losses will be an upset to Boise State (sorry) and against California. Ducks beat USC, go to the Rose Bowl and make the Pac-1 the Pac-2!<br>  Enjoy what Gang Green's got in Eugene. I'm an Auburn fan, and we are in turmoil... Or are we???

I can see him going back to the Clippers too.|`|ED7bwcdnaa	He will resign with LAL|`|WT8CbURxaa	I don't think the Clippers need him, nor do they really have the money to sign him (unless he goes in a sign & trade).<br>  <br>  Supposedly there were Odom to the Kings trade rumors, but this was before Bynum went down and the Lakers needed to rely on Odom more.<br>  <br>  With the Kings acquiring the expiring contract of Drew Gooden, it could open up possibilities that they sign him.|`|38634d724472d6d2e903c2fa2cae8951aa	Damn really?

QA6SJ5Wvaa	sierrasnowboard.com<br>  <br>  If you're just getting into it, don't spend more that 200 bucks on a board and no more than 100 on bindings.<br>  <br>  have fun :)|`|mGTeNxpJaa	How much are you willing to spend? The prices can shoot up to the high hundreds.<br>  <br>  I suggest go here <br>  <br>  <a href="http://store.atticskateshop.com/snowboardstuff.html" rel="nofollow">http://store.atticskateshop.com/snowboar...</a><br>  <br>  Note that 5150 is a sister company of RIDE snowboards. This means you can generally get the same high quality deck as RIDE just on with 5150 graphixs.<br>  <br>  Not to mention with the prices you save here on your deck you may be able to purchase bindings and other stuff for the price of a deck alone anywhere esle. Something to consider.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|HVpeJzM4aa	contrary to some misinformed individuals a lot of snowboards these days are NOT priced on quality anymore, unless it is a higher model of the brand. A lot of snowboards are priced based on name recognition if anything and consequently the most over-rated, over-priced board will be Burton. If you want great deals on snowboards go to www.sierrasnowboard.com. they offer free shipping and excellent prices of up to 50% off on most items. by the way...k2's, ride', and lamar are probably your best bet at bargains and excellent quality.|`|bLrbDp0saa	It's all on quality.  I have a Rome Agent and it was $420.  It is defiantly one of the better boards out there i think.  But renting would be a good choice until you know your going to stick with snowboarding.  For a good beginner/intermediate board it would probably be around $200-$350.  And sorry to say thats just for the board.  Bindings will probably be $150 to $250 or something like that.  And boots will be around $150- $200.  <br>  Snowboarding is quite expensive but I would say it is my probably one of my favorite things.|`|nQCK5PRSaa	snowboard can vary from free(old ones nobody wants anymore) all the way up to almost $1000(burton vapor). it all depends on how nice you want your snowboard to be. generally(not always true) the more you pay the better the board. if you are looking for a cheap board that is nice, look to buy a used board on ebay perhaps. if you are looking for a new board try buying a board at the end of the season sale for around 50-70% off new boards. also check out brociety.com they throw up boards on that website pretty cheap every now and then. hope it helps. also remember you have to buy boots and bindings too so you have to factor those into the costs. you want to make sure you have the nicest boots because w/o nice boots you will be in pain|`|IDkPCzvnaa	$200-$600 you can get some for up to $1,000. the more it costs the better it is. You can buy some very great dc snowboards for like $300-$500.|`|JThgHiaoaa	Hi Meggi,<br>  <br>  Snowboards are expensive pieces of equipment. You can get cheaper ones from your big name sport stores but they are generally of a low quality and will not perform like a board that is worth a decent amount.<br>  <br>  If its your first time, I would suggest renting your gear. You may not get top of the line gear and it may have been used before but it will save you a lot of money and if you don't like the sport, you aren't stuck with $700 worth of equipment.<br>  <br>  If you do plan to buy, wait for the season to be over (if you can) and purchase in the warmer months. You can often bag up a great deal which will save you lots of money for next years season.<br>  <br>  If you really want one now, why not looking into a brand from the southern hemisphere like Force - <a href="http://www.force.net.au" rel="nofollow">http://www.force.net.au</a> and snap up one of their bargains. Remember the US dollar is 2 times the Australian Dollar so if the board is worth $250, you can get it for $125 US. Even with shipping costs, thats going to save you a ton compared to a Burton. In Aus, you can get a Burton for $500-600 and these force boards are reduced from those prices to make way for this years stock :)|`|yid0jeX4aa	200-300$$ depends on the quality

yHvh7tFlaa	There is a meeting this week of the Hempstead Town Board where the result of the stupid "Environmental Impact Study" or whatever nonsense they call it is to be discussed regarding the Lighthouse Project. The Islanders current lease at the Masoleum doesn't expire for 6 more years. Plus it will be hard for Uncle Charlie to give up the 2nd best cable TV deal in the league, which gives him 20 million per season and increases each year. If the NHL reclassifies the Isles and doesn't include them anymore within the NYC TV market, they can get an additional 12 million dollars. So unless Wang sells, I don't believe they will move.<br>  <br>  My former seats were actually turned into the first row of a luxury box. So that would be good if they come to Vegas and become the Las Vegas Desert Islanders.  Maryann and Ginger can be Caliche Girls, and Gillian can be the new mascot.|`|76nTvO4iaa	I think a NHL franchise would do well in Kansas City.<br>  <br>  Kansas City, Kansas/Missouri has more millionaires per capita than any other major metropolitan area in the US.<br>  <br>  They have active junior and midget hockey leagues.  The Russell Stover league (yes, the candy brand) is a premier youth hockey league in the midwest.<br>  <br>  I've been hearing Preds more than Islanders for the move, though.|`|AA12103453	No the Islanders will stay on the Island. Do you really think K.C. wants that crappy franchise with their former goalie as a G.M. Has anyone ever really stopped laughing at them hiring Garth Snow as a G.M. OK maybe LITY will correct me on it not being funny and could show that Snow is actually doing a good job(I don't do any research on this so I don't know).

He has stood in 14 Ashes Test matches and officiated in Bangladesh's first ever Test match.<br>  <br>  One Day Internationals<br>  <br>  Bucknor has officiated in the second highest number of ODI's, with Rudi Koertzen the only umpire to have stood in more ODI's.<br>  <br>  Awards<br>  <br>  Bucknor has received the ICC's Bronze Bails awards for umpiring in 100 ODI's, as well as the Gold Bails award for umpiring 100 Test matches.<br>  However, Dave Richardson, the general manager of cricket at the ICC, Bucknor's employer, indicated that his umpiring accuracy was 96% in 2005-06,[which was above the average of 94.8% for the Elite Panel as a whole. . In 2007, he was short-listed for the Umpire of the Year award, which was ultimately won by Simon Taufel.<br>  <br>  Controversial Memories;<br>  <br>  Bucknor's reputation has been damaged by controversial moments in recent years. He was widely criticised for a series of incorrect decisions during India's tour of Australia in 2003-04.. <br>  <br>  The BCCI also alleged Bucknor mimicked Rahul Dravid, who had been charged with ball tampering. Consequently the BCCI lodged a formal complaint with the ICC.<br>  <br>  on May 2006, he accused TV companies of doctoring their images to make umpires look bad. He was one of the officials, along with Aleem Dar, Rudi Koertzen, Billy Bowden and referee Jeff Crowe, responsible for the finish to the 2007 World Cup final, which finished in poor light. Consequently, all five officials were suspended from the Twenty20 World Championship in South Africa.<br>  <br>  On several occasions, Bucknor has also chosen not to refer decisions to the third umpire and has later been shown to be wrong. Most notable among these were his decisions in 1992-93 to rule Jonty Rhodes not run-out, in the first series to have the third umpire available, and in 2008 to rule Andrew Symonds not out stumped. Both players went on to play match-winning innings.<br>  <br>  During India tour to Australia in 2007-08, Bucknor received severe criticism for his umpiring in the Sydney Test match, most notably his decisions to declare Andrew Symonds not out twice in the 1st innings and to give Rahul Dravid out in the final innings. To alleviate escalating tension in the series, in an unprecedented move, the ICC replaced Bucknor with Billy Bowden for the third Test match at Perth.<br>  <br>  <br>  In the wake of the Sydney Test, former umpire Dickie Bird suggested that Bucknor had "gone on too long".<br>  <br>  Julia its indeed sad that one doesn't  remember Buckner for his good oll days .<br>  <br>  for a person holding such a high position as that of an umpire in sports,  decision that he makes then and there is to be abided  by  the teams  .<br>  <br>  and so  there is no mercy  when an umpire is  caught in deliberate wrong  decision making , <br>   it can greatly  effect  the position of the teams concerned .|`|7oHt9fTkaa	he was one of the greatest umpires and he lost a bit of his reputation in his career end.<br>  but now he done the exact thing to protect his remaining reputation and what will he do next?<br>  may be commenting........?lol|`|va8quhPtaa	Decisions of an umpire are  very delicate ones .He has to deliver the judgment almost instantly.He can not satisfy every body around him.

A jock strap will give support and limited protection.|`|ehfe97Zcaa	I know this sounds stupid, but when it comes to rugby I suggest you don't use pads at all, other than maybe head gear. <br>  <br>  I'm sure you could wear a cup, but I've never seen it before in the 21 years I've played. It'd be bloody hard to run properly when you're wearing something like that.<br>  <br>  If you're worried about getting your junk wrecked then just wear something like Skins (like bike shorts) under your rugby shorts. It helps keep everything out of the way. <br>  <br>  But yeah, in general I think pads are against all the fundamentals of the game.|`|DgS3MwYraa	I have been playing rugby since '97 and have never used a cup...nor have I seen anyone use one! Never had the need to use one, that area is pretty safe in a rugby match.<br>  <br>  It is allowed, but it seems a bit impractical for me because in rugby your constantly bending, running etc. could be more of a distraction than anything else.|`|aYVPZjLVaa	cup is allowed.

fS8joiTaaa	Yes it is possible to do so.<br>  <br>  The bottom bracket is basically a hole.<br>  Inside the hole for unsealled bearings is a bearing race with bearings that are packed inside the race but are still visible.<br>  <br>  Sealed is the same except the bearings are sealed inside of a race so the bearings cant be seen kind of like a skateboard bearing.<br>  <br>  Here is what you will need <a href="http://www.danscomp.com/456007.php?cat=PARTS" rel="nofollow">http://www.danscomp.com/456007.php?cat=P...</a> something along the lines of this. Just take off your cranks and clean the bottom bracket out then pop these bearings in and there you go you have sealed bearings and no more trouble of unsealed bearings.<br>  <br>  Howevere there is an exception to this. Say you are running one piece cranks and not three piece you will not be able to make the change because of alot of reasons that i really dont want to get into on yahoo answers. So you will either need to already have a 3 piece or purchase a 3 piece to make the change. If you have a 1 piece you might aswell get a better bike than even making the change.<br>  <br>  Then their is another thing you have to look out for. You need to know the size of your spindle in your 3 piece cranks before you purchase the bearings because they make the hole in the bearings different sizes so the spindle wont fit if you get the wrong one.<br>  <br>  If you want you could also join this website <a href="http://we-bmx.fairtopic.com/" rel="nofollow">http://we-bmx.fairtopic.com/</a> This is a very helpful website its good for begginers and intermediates and if you have any questions about riding or whatever its a good website to join and talk to other riders. <br>  <br>  Hope i helped and best answer please :) lol

i8soZLfRaa	Most of the teams have at least three haulers, three sets of tools and at least 6-8 cars. Different cars are set up for different tracks, so the Daytona cars would not have been used in CA anyway. The owners are all hoping their drivers can bring the cars to the finish in one piece tonight, because they would like to use the same car in Vegas, even though back up cars are already there waiting.<br>  <br>  The teams that don't have at least two of everything, and 4-6 cars are at a distinct disadvantage, and it usually shows on qualifying day.|`|g4MaHuJ0aa	The teams send a second set of haulers out.  They meet up with the regular haulers and swap the cars.<br>  <br>  I didn't read the question correctly.  I thought you were referring to the fact that they go from California this week to Las Vegas next week.  <br>  Daytona to California is not an issue.  They drive back to the shop Sunday after the 500 and leave sometime on Monday.  Typically, the haulers leave on Wednesdays.  But, they leave on Monday or Tuesday for west coast races.

xhPKkkELaa	Welcome to surfing. This question has been asked enough times before, but there is really only one true answer. You can get the answer to this same question, and lots of other goood info for beginners by checking the resolved answers.<br>  <br>  Lessons are the only sensible way to start surfing, either from a professional instructor, or surfing family or friends who are experienced surfers.There are way too many dangerous people in the water now, who THINK they can surf. Please don't join their ranks.The VERY LAST THING the rest of us experienced surfers want is people to take silly on-line advice, and go down to the beach, grab a surfboard, and go out and get in our way.<br>  <br>  Most people start out best on long boards, but I have seen plenty of surfers start begin with a short board and master it in no time. It just tends to be more difficult. The bottom line is there are NO RULES as to what kind of surfboard you learn on. Certainly a longboard usually is more user friendly.<br>  <br>  Most professional instructors will rent you a board to learn on. Beginners shouldn't even think about buying a board until they master the basics, and decide they really want to keep on surfing.<br>  <br>  This question comes up a lot on YA Surfing, and it is impossible to answer it accurately on-line. Although I am sure you will get lots of "advice" the real BEST ANSWER is to go to a good local surf shop and discuss your skill level, your size and local wave conditions with the folks there. they will give you much better info than ANYBODY out here in cyberspace. When you are finally ready, you should really think about buying a decent board, and avoiding popouts , and boards made in sweat shops in China, unless that's just all you can afford. And don't forget, there are always used boards for sale in every surf shop. After 42 years of surfing, I still get my surfboard buying advice at good local shops in the places where I surf.<br>  <br>  And, I know there are lots of nice kids who want to share information with you on line. But don't take the advice from youngsters, who may know even less than you do about surfing, a surfboard is a big investment. I am sure that a guy who is 6'3" is old enough and  mature enough to read through the BS that lots of people throw at you on line.<br>  <br>  Anybody, on-line, who gives specific advice on what size board someone should buy is foolish. Anyone who takes that advice is more foolish.Good luck! <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.avalonsurfschool.com/index.ht..." rel="nofollow">http://www.avalonsurfschool.com/index.ht...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.mckevlins.com/nopopstory.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.mckevlins.com/nopopstory.htm</a><br>  Boards made in far eastern sweats shops:<br>  <a href="http://bp3.blogger.com/_hPACOtZKKko/RkSTwhvv9kI/AAAAAAAAAfg/QMqBFAtXzQ4/s1600-h/chinaboards.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://bp3.blogger.com/_hPACOtZKKko/RkST...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.surfing-waves.com/beginner_surfboard.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.surfing-waves.com/beginner_su...</a>|`|oYGtkVwOaa	get a long board its easier to learn on|`|lFo5L9mYaa	Long boards and fat boards are easier to begin with, BUT, when you progress and get better you won't be able to move around as easily, and do lots of good tricks. And if you start on a nice short board, around 5-6 foot surf board, and when you get the hang of it you can do lots more tricks and move around easier, also, when you can ride a board from around 5-6" you can ride ANY board. <br>  <br>  If you want an easy board to start out with, get a big fat long board. <br>  <br>  But if you want to save money, become better faster, and have more fun get a board around 5-6" or at least a 7" board. <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|YSa3Mdz3aa	If you are still learning, I would recommend going with a softboard / foam surfboard. It should be around 9 ft. and only costs about $200 - $300 (a fraction of a hard board). Once you progress in your surfing and get more confident in the water you can move down in size. The foamy is also good because the only thing you'll hurt is your ego whereas a hard board can do some serious damage. I've ridden foamys before and prefer the doyle because it blends the best of both soft and hard.|`|NiRFfxeLaa	John F Knows what he is talking about.  Go talk to a couple of surf shops and they will have good advice.  Longboards are definitely easier to surf on, especially for smaller waves.  I'm 5'7 and 190lbs (I play football) and I learned on a 68 and now my main board is a 66.<br>  <br>  Get some lessons, and have fun!
6JE0mcrLaa	Take the food switching slowly. Make it over a period of 2 weeks. If you rush this process, your horse may develop colic. Take your current feed, but reduce it a bit. Then, add the new feed you want to introduce. For the first 2 days, follow the above instructions. Then, on the 3rd day, add a little more of the new food, and a tad less of your current. Add a little more each day.|`|tiCCWfT0aa	that should be fine. id suggest switching the feeds slowly though.|`|UIUMrurEaa	Strategy is really a better feed for her.

OHs8yJiOaa	A year from now? Yes.<br>  <br>  Your biggest concern is likely whatever injury caused you to go on and off since last spring, and if it's the type to return or if it's truly healed.<br>  <br>  And especially while you're re-adapting and dropping weight, I'd make sure to work in cross-training like an exercise bike.|`|AA10745377	Definitely, you just have to watch how soon you get back into intense training.  Gradually ease back in and keep a close eye on your injury.<br>  <br>  good luck!!!|`|1UID5JtNaa	If you mean a year from now, then yes.  This spring, no.   You need to get rid of that extra weight though.|`|ed377f9dc2958771e37512095f53f6bbaa	Yes!  You definitely can build on your time.  Make your comeback slow, back off if you feel any pain, and use what you learned from your prior running to make this your best race ever!
xPZm0Mxlaa	It depends on what you are going to do with your new gun. If you are hunting and shooting tin can ect. Buy the savage but if you are going to do a lot of target shooting buy the Anschutz. Remingting .Ruger,and Marlin (low end but they make good shoting 22.s) all make very good 22|`|8ivnzNi5aa	If you're trying to make the Olympic rifle team, go with the Anschutz.  Otherwise, buy the Savage and use the money you save to buy more practice ammo.  They both seem high-priced to me for a .22, but I'm just a cheap SOB.|`|fB8ujUVNaa	Get the savage. Save money for ammo.<br>  Then when you are ready for "Olympics" gun up with the Anschutz.<br>  very nice...
AA11488609	Connecticut beating NJ Tech?  Possible.  I think very possible.|`|piZ4xDBqaa	Sure.  When you talk "worst", you could be talking about some really, really bad teams.  Guys at some really small college who barely know how to dribble.<br>  <br>  Now, if the best womens team played, say, the team that loses the NCAA "Play in" game in March, then they'd almost certainly lose.|`|WT8CbURxaa	I suppose it's POSSIBLE, but definitely not probable.|`|b41cf14d8319aa56219d62c039eca8adaa	If you mean a community college men's team, then they might have a chance.|`|21XmVm6Zaa	yeah duh|`|iEbl30suaa	yeah at field hockey

Y4mz8BShaa	You bought a terrible airsoft gun. Had to be said.<br>  <br>  The hop-up would be located near the inner barrel, and you'll likely have to remove the slide access it. Being a cheap EBB, the "spinup" is very likely fixed and can't be adjusted.
0tpLq6meaa	Depends on how close you are. If you are close enough the pellets come out in a wad similar to a slug, and just as devastating.|`|8ivnzNi5aa	It could kill you, or leave you paralyzed or blind, depending upon how it hit.  Don't try to find out!|`|OAEuYZkZaa	It depends on several things.<br>  <br>  If the loaded shell is thrown at you from close range, it will probably raise a lump, but not be lethal.<br>  <br>  Now if you shoot someone with a skeet load at a range of 40 or 50 yards, you should survive without damage unless you are unlucky enough to get hit in the eye.<br>  <br>  At ten yards or less you might survive getting hit in the back of the head, if you are lucky.  Catch a full load in the face and you'd better have your affairs in order because your nest stop will be the Pearly Gates.<br>  <br>  And don't go testing the various ranges to see how  close you have to get to hurt each other.  All it takes is a single pellet to cost you your vision. <br>  <br>  Doc|`|fUDlbOP0aa	if you're asking is its possible, yes. people survive all sorts of amazing things- falling out of plane and without a parachute surviving to tell the tale, a 200 foot fall in a car without seat belts, shot 15 times in the temple with a .22 without any brain damage or mental damage, the list goes on and on. <br>  <br>  its is possible to survive nearly anything if you're asking if its possible. however its mostly sheer luck they survive these extreme types of physical trauma, without luck a shotgun load to the head would be fatal.|`|yaq7oaH6aa	1. 3 drams is not a skeet or trap load.<br>  2. The answer depends on at what range and how it hit.<br>  At close range, any direct hit with a shotgun round <br>  would literally explode your skull.|`|AA11620976	The question is not if it's possible to survive  But rather are you sure that you would want to ?|`|0R46pYb3aa	No.  It is one ounce of lead that will simply blow your head off.|`|0cLj35Fgaa	Don't mind brewmeister.  He is one of the official forum trolls.  He also posted crap in response to my questions.<br>  <br>  A while back, a senior member from this forum contacted YA! customer support about creating a separate gun section.  Their response was that you need a gun to hunt, therefore ALL gun questions should be directed to this forum, even if they aren't hunting-oriented question.<br>  <br>  As for your question about shotgun shells, I'm not exactly sure.  I'm sure that someone on this forum has the exact answer.  For those who think it's not a legitimate question, you need to ask yourself if this isn't a home-defense question.  Perhaps the OP got into this debate with a friend because he wanted to find something that was good for self defense.|`|4SF4KGu4aa	I will guarantee you would get killed at point blank distance. As a matter of fact, special effects guys in Hollywood have never been able to quite get the full affect of a "shotgun in mouth" type injury. There is, for all purposes, nothing left above the neck. The head literally explodes. You may recognize and eyeball and some hair and teeth but that's about it.<br>  <br>  That's with bird-shot by the way. Rather morbid topic and there is no way to prepare yourself for the sight especially if you were close by when it happened. Be just as lethal probably out to 15 yards if the gun had a full choke. Just not as messy.|`|UQHfRU5eaa	Man..I am under the impression that this 3 dram clay pigeon load would for sure do some damage.. how much damage would depend obviously on the distance between the target and the gun. <br>  I believe I would say it CAN be lethal even at about 30-40 yards. Depending on where the shot entered the body and IF it hit any major arteries, because the shot pattern will widen the farther the target is away, you may aim for the head... but also hit the neck region as well.<br>  ALSO.. it would matter what kinda choke you have as well.|`|Vakup5Jvaa	7 1/2 or 8 shot<br>  <br>  0-15 yrds your dead<br>  <br>  15-30yrds trip to hospital<br>  <br>  50 yrds You'll be picking out buckshot with tweezers and you may loose an eye.<br>  <br>  50-70 you will feel it but if you have a heavy jacket you should be able to walk away unscathed.<br>  <br>  <br>  Three years ago I was out duck hunting and an overanxious dipwad shot at a duck behind me about fifty yards away and hit my back. <br>  I was wearing an army jacket, heavy sweat shirt and there was heavy cattails between us. It felt like someone smacked me on the back but none of the steel shot went through my army jacket.<br>  <br>  BTW he pulled his boat in after dawn was breaking and parked his boat about 60yds away and walked closer to us....if brains were dynamite he couldn't have blown his nose.|`|1b98dcf55f3a990e7013ba04e6691faaaa	Depends on how far away.  <br>  If it were up close; you would lose the bet and your life instantly.  The pellets at point blank range act as one mass of lead and will cause the same damage as a slug.  <br>  <br>  The farther away you are from it; the less the damage caused since the pellets begin to spread out and lose power.|`|3b8557f01cef58611c2e78e57d57b1e5aa	* All i can tell you is don't try it because you won't be around to tell your story.*|`|nBUDjyhgaa	One way to find out, genius.|`|vm3Andzkaa	If your close enough it will kill you. However if your more than about 25 yards away it probably wouldn't kill you, just mess you up pretty good. If you need more information ask our ex vice president's hunting buddy how it felt.|`|5eWb3CWoaa	You'd be deader than a doornail.  Have you ever actually shot a shotgun before?  I doubt it!|`|hfeiRP6Yaa	Yes it would from even a decent distance. I can speak from experience that it sucks if they even hit you after bouncing back. And that lodged them in my skin.
ncSpnEI7aa	yes  since they are slide down the standing and if they lose to the maple leafs then they should. maple leafs is the fourth worst team in the league if they cant even beat them then the coach is worstless|`|nQlwiHfLaa	Honestly, I believe there is a better than 50% chance that you'll wake up to a fired Renney tomorrow morn.<br>  <br>  I've never had an issue with Renney, but this squad stopped playing for him after the AS break. There's 6 weeks left in the season and if the team is going to hold onto it's ticket to the dance - never mind do something in April - something needs to happen NOW.|`|bAR1Eeakaa	Rangers should fire Renney after this loss against Maple leafs <br>  DEFINETLY!<br>  and they should get Pete Laviolette or Pat Quinn if they dont fire Renney then they should just get Ilya Kovalchuck cause he aint happy in Atlanta and Rangers need someone big!!!!!!<br>  and u know every single hockey player would always want to play in the Greatest Arena in the World!!!!!!!! Madison Square Garden!!!!!!<br>  so Atlanta say bye bye to Kovalchuck!<br>  CAUSE HE IS THE NEW RANGER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|TYyINrYiaa	Yes, for sure, and with plenty of TOP FLIGHT coaching talent without a job (Laviolette, Tortarella) they should start talking to replacements soon, if not for this season, to lock up for next.<br>  <br>  EDIT: 2/23/09 4:55 pm PT, Tortarella hired, called it!|`|JlJ8W167aa	Renney should be fired. The Team has given up on him.  Over 60 games into the season and he does not know  where to put his players. Bench Prucha and Dawes but let that piece of crap Wade Redden be on the frist powerplay unit it makes no sense .|`|bcDt3ZpPaa	Rangers suck regardless. but it's better for the other teams if they just keep him and keep on sucking!! whoo! rangers suck!|`|rCeofkyVaa	yeah because penguins fired therrian and are doing better
hSOHLKUNaa	crosman c 11 or beretta elite 2|`|SsB7aRExaa	Dream on.|`|AA11707728	BB guns can't shoot far....because they shoot BBs.  I guess you could put any laser sight on a BB gun but what would be the point?  Again, it shoots BBs so it is inheritly inaccurate.<br>  <br>  Instead, get a pelletgun.  Pellets are designed to be drag stabilized.  And are far more accurate.

eTHEgWq0aa	higher flex, like 100, is good for a hella better slapshot. low flex like 75, is really good for stickhandling, and medium flex is like, for everything, i guess. <br>  i prefer 100 flex because you can learn to be soft with your hands when you stick handle, and have the great flex for a slapshot.|`|ll2y4YIGaa	the mid flex is (depending on brand) 75, 77<br>  The Regular flex is (also depending on brand) 85, 87<br>  <br>  <br>  the 77 and 87 is bauer. the 75 and 85 is most other brands|`|x7NtYD8Aaa	for senior...<br>  mid is around 75 or 77 and regular is 85 or 87|`|zgPr8HQyaa	Mid flex is easier to flex and (if you weigh a decent amount or are strong) easier to break.

Ghiy6Cwlaa	i dont know who ever signs to fight him|`|xDaesbudaa	Margarito's a non-factor now.  He's out of the boxing game for at least a year.  There's no guarantee the revocation will be lifted in a year.<br>  <br>  I heard Clottey may be next, but Cotto's calling out the Pacquiao-Hatton winner.  It will be easy for me to root for Cotto if he faces Hatton, but Pacquiao's my next favorite boxer.  Emotionally I'll be torn.<br>  <br>  Bottom line: Cotto's back, baby!!|`|LSg84ucPaa	He should go against Clottey of the ones u listed, however, i strongly believe that there should be a Margarito vs Cotto II and the final results will show who is the better man in a clean fight, i go for Margarito still|`|1AzCDrO6aa	I think clottey could be a bigger money fight than the rest.|`|ElH6jMEXaa	I'd love to see either Mosley or Berto.  I'd lean towards Shane as even though he looked great against Margarito, he can't have too many more fights left in him - I think he would be good to go this summer or fall against Cotto, but much later than that age would play a far more significant role.<br>  <br>  Berto is young and going to be around for a while, he and Cotto will almost definatley square soon enough, but Berto should take on Clottey and Cotto deal with Sugar - then the winners go at it to determine the top welterweight before the end of 2009.<br>  <br>  Eventually I'd love to see Cotto get a rematch with Margarito, but it won't happen this year as it appears there is no way Cotto will aide Margarito in circumventing the Calif. commission ruling.|`|kqP7GwOcaa	I think Miguel Cotto needs to fight Margarito again, to avenge his KO loss.  Without loaded gloves, I think Margarito loses.  The others can wait until that defeat is avenged.  Should Cotto do well against Margarito the 2nd time out, it would make the suspicion of Margarito's loaded gloves all the more possible, and even justify the loss, even it it cannot be reversed.  I think it's a given that Cotto avenge the loss.  Cintron's recent loss puts him last on the list of potential opponents for Cotto, and Berto would be an easy win for Cotto.  The Clottey fight is a dangerous one, and should the Margarito rematch fail to occur, Mosley is the best choice of the four you listed.  With a win over Shane already on his record, Cotto would have the psychological advantage going in, and I think Shane would be and easier fight for Cotto than Clottey.  You may be right about the Berto fight, but some how it just doesn't appeal to me, I don't feel Berto is in the same class as Clottey, Mosley or Margarito.<br>  <br>  I think Cotto's best move is a rematch with Margarito, the alphabet belts are all but meaningless anyway so Cotto should punish Margarito for cheating by KOing him in a rematch.|`|Yrcf7HGAaa	First of all I strongly believe Cotto should stay away from Mosley because to be honest as much as I am a Cotto fan I thought Mosley won that close fight against Cotto a couple of years ago.<br>  <br>  If I had to pick just one of the above fights mentioned I would have to go with Kermit Cintron versus Miguel Cotto.  To have a fight between these two Puerto Rican fighters made in Madison Square Garden New York City surrounded by Puerto Rican fans would generate a lot of money and bring excitment back to the great sport of boxing!|`|036906b3ee1ba2b6f544c6c2610a7cebaa	Berto would be a good one for Cotto because his defense is terrible but his speed is terrific so it make for a good fight.  But I think Mosley would be the bigger fight being that Mosley beat Margarito. Either way whenever Cotto fights your gonna have a Great fight because he is a lot of fun to watch.|`|aym20hIgaa	Im a True Cotto fan, and he should go after Berto as a set up fight, take Berto's title and then go after Mosley and take Mosley title too , Then Cotto will have all the welterweight belts.

You might want to check out the CMP website anyway for general information:<br>  <a href="http://www.odcmp.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.odcmp.com/</a><br>  If you plan on building a 1903 and not a 1903a3 you will have to be concerned with the serial number of the receiver the dreaded "low Number" springfields 810,000 or lower are banned from competition.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|vm3Andzkaa	fulton-armory.com has everything you could ever want for both the m1 garand and 1903 springfield.

HVpeJzM4aa	i'm going to give you the most basic breakdown you'll ever get in the process of buying a snowboard...only a rookie snowboarder or a misinformed snowboarder will tell you that certain boards are designed for beginners, intermediates, advanced. Some may be labeled as such  but the bottom line is that the only thing you have to worry about is how flexible you want your board, and how tall your board should be based on your WEIGHT not your height. as far as brands...there's nothing wrong with morrow, i've tried them out and they're descent enough to get you buy as a bargain boot...rossi bindings same deal...and board...well since you're avoiding the rookie mistake of buying a burton...you're off to a good start and yes they are excellent bargains. So go with your gut instinct since it is your money and your time that you are spending.|`|xhHfXuKFaa	u should look for a cheap burton board. burton is good. why the thumbs down?|`|JThgHiaoaa	Rossi is decent and the Zena board looks like a good board.<br>  <br>  Morrow on the other hand is not a great brand and I would definately look elsewhere for your boots :)<br>  <br>  @skimboarder<br>  Rossignol is the company that makes GNU and Lib-Tech... Get your facts straight before knocking a brand and then telling them to buy the same brand lol.|`|w2vvFmr8aa	Go to www.sierrasnowboards.com they have the best deals out there. Every once in a while they even do 60% off. My friend just bought a $240 pair of bindings for $100 five days ago. As for what you found, if its a local shop go in and try on the boots, see how they fit. For the most part, a snowboard is a snowboard when you start out. You don't need a high end brand, you need a piece of wood and fiberglass with a slick bottom. Don't let someone try talking you into something fancy. Oh and lastly, if its a local shop you are going to, offer them a lower price then what is posted. Local shops are dying for business because of the current state of the economy. Take advantage of the great deals out there|`|mGTeNxpJaa	Personlly I would stay away from snowboards made by ski companies. Solomon, Rossignal, K2 are ski companies that started making snowboards when the sport caught on. Prior to that it was ski companies against true snowboard companies jocking for position in the market place.<br>  <br>  I would go w/ a snowboard company because they are true to one genre of the sport snowboarding. Think about it how many snowboard companies do you see making skis???<br>  <br>  How much are you willing to spend? The prices can shoot up to the high hundreds.<br>  <br>  I suggest go here: <br>  <br>  <a href="http://store.atticskateshop.com/snowboar..." rel="nofollow">http://store.atticskateshop.com/snowboar...</a><br>  <br>  Note that 5150 is a sister company of RIDE snowboards. This means you can generally get the same high quality deck as RIDE just on with 5150 graphixs.<br>  <br>  Not to mention with the prices you save here on your deck you may be able to purchase bindings and other stuff for the price of a deck alone anywhere esle. Something to consider.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|bLrbDp0saa	Well if you really like it I would defiantly save up and get a good board.  The Zena will gte you through your beginner and starting intermediate  stages but once you get better the board wont hold up as well, especailly if you get into freestyle.  Sorry to say but all those brands yuo said are like that.  Some good boards would be Gnu, Neversummer, Burton, Ride, K2, and Rome would be some good brands.  They will be more expensive but will pay off if you keep boarding.|`|1dCBF7o2aa	Yeah Rossignol boards are cheap decent snowboards for beginners, also Burton snowboards are a good choice. You can find alot of cheap burton boards online and in my town they're used to be a snowboard exchange were you could buy used snowboards or trade in skiis for snowboards. You might want to check if your town is having a snowboard exchange because some people also will just sell them to you for real cheap like under 100 dollars.|`|YcLz2JFcaa	Woooooo.... are you serious?<br>  <br>  rossignol has no affilation with lib-tech nor GNU. Lib-Tech and GNU are owned under Mervin manufacturing, which is owned under Quiksilver. Get your facts straight.<br>  <br>  but i'd go with lib or gnu for the banana traction, reverse camber and magne-traction are great additions to snowboarding.
Rwwk98T5aa	stay low and keep your stroke fast and smooth..get off your walls quickly and use your legs a lot off the walls.keep your head down when you breathe and work on getting your legs stronger by running or bicycling. Get your arms stronger with weights and push ups/pull ups.If you do those things just in your spare time it will pay off.|`|Qas05nZraa	keep practicing

br1kwegaaa	An initial disqualification alleged that he had made an illegal turn during the race. Having been improperly entered, the disqualification was overturned, giving Peirsol his second individual gold.
GY3QTszgaa	DIRK NOWITZKI- he is the best shooter in the nba. he shifts the defense in more ways than anyone else. he can post up and gets doubled to pass out to open shooters. he's a great passer. he avged 4ast in 2008 playoffs and 3.5 in 2006-08. unlike anyone in the league if he stands behind the 3point line he's causing the defense trouble, bcuz at 7ft tall other pfs and center have to guard him and if that bigman is a great blocker he has to stick to dirk which helps j-ho and terry drive to the basket without being blocked. (THATS UN BELIEVABLE). ppl say kobe&james bcuz there the flashiest and most exciting but when you say best player i think of the player who impacts the game the most DIRK. he dragged role players to the finals in the western conference and no other star did that. (lebron did in a weaker eastern conference) dirk is an impossible person to guard. he can get past any bigmen with his quickness or take that bigmen out on the perimeter and use his guard skills to score. and if a smaller person is on him he will post him up. (KOBE IS A PERIMETER PLAYER WHO NEEDS A SHAQ OR A PAU OR AN INSIDE PRESENCE TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN THE PLAYOFFS, DUNCAN IS A POST PLAYER WHO NEEDS A GINOBLI OR A PARKER TO HELP HIM HAVE PLAYOFF SUCCESS. BUT DIRK IS BOTH INSIDE AND OUT AND THATS WHY HE WENT TO THE FINALS WITH NEITHER AN INSIDE PRESSENSE OR A KOBE TYPE PLAYER. DIRK IS THE BEST PLAYER ON THE PLANET|`|HWNXxNBBaa	Dwight Howard "Superman"!<br>  <br>  He rocks and is the best in da world!!!|`|3teWTOPqaa	Kobe Bryant|`|AA11580219	Kobe Bryant because he has talent that the NBA has not seen in a long time. Kobe has an incredible ability to score, he can shoot from anywhere on the court, he gets his teamates involved, and is as good a perimeter defender as anyone in the NBA. Also, in the last 5 minutes of a game, Kobe is the guy I would want to have the ball because I know he will put the ball in the hole|`|nunTclFFaa	dwayne wade easy... he has no1 to help him. he's gotten the heat to the 5th seed... bryant has gasol,odom, and bynum, KG has allen & pierce, LBJ has mo williams, dh12 has jameer nelson, hedo turkoglu, and rashard lewis. also, wade is scoring 44% of his teams points on a daily nite. its true go look it up. last year, when wade was injured, the heat only won 15 games and theyve already won 29.|`|GERlmBIUaa	Either Kobe or Lebron...<br>  Kobe cuz he is the most clutch player in the league no doubt...<br>  LeBron cuz he is the most athletic player in the league...|`|Cm2vFHQDaa	i like lebron because he is unselfish and usually has a better all around game. he also makes his team mates better.<br>  <br>  LEBRON 4 MVP!!!|`|IA4x5oPMaa	Agredd on that one so, the answer is ....................................Kobe
etErp8rcaa	I remember that they moved Joni Pitkanen to Carolina for Erik Cole, and Jarett Stoll and Matt Greene to LA for Lubomir Visnovsky.

Alphabetical order.|`|5c0ea2e937929dc820b4f96293aa83a2aa	they are right... Liverpools downfall is due to Rotation leaving out keane and playing muppets like Lucas..... Rafa is not the man for a big job
rvE7gyuUaa	2 piece sticks are  quality hockey sticks.  A couple of years ago, everyone used them. I remember keeping my first Easton Ultra Lite right by my bed everynight.  They get the job done,  But  technology has improved a little.   Using a 1-piece is just slightly stronger, faster (shot) and lighter.|`|ll2y4YIGaa	they are equally good as long as you compare two similar sticks.  i prefer the onepieces because i play roller hockey an my sticks never break (kinda wierd considering the slashes i give and take). but if you play ice or you break sticks easily, get a two piece.   i also use a two piece outside so that all i have to replace is a blade instead of a whole stick
lG1IgsZgaa	I vehemently verify that the velocity of said players vivacious volleys have been voluptuated following his choice to collect a vast and varied array of Jimmy James & The Vagabonds records bought from the contributions of the sale of his Medal for Valour which he set a precedent for winning for vanity.

Wrestler, and The reason for that because they know Taker is gives pain to the people who he faces in the ring and, yet, to teach them a lesson.     Most people try to stay away from from Taker, but with a single mistake that they make or get the GM mad, Taker is the first person that comes to mind when wanting to teach a lesson that they will never forget in theirs lives|`|0Dm3WEMcaa	They turn to the one man they know can teach them a lesson.

xXa3eQOeaa	HELL NO!!!!!<br>  <br>  Playing in the NFL is a privilege, he had his chance and did not respect it! Let him go find a "REAL JOB" in the real World!!|`|9f0eb3ac244a30553e7164baead93341aa	i think he is a great qb let him play. he is probably my favorite quarter back. so let him play. its the fans that should decide what happens|`|lTDeZ0Obaa	No, not EVER! Yes, he served his time, and he can be free to earn a living another way, but he should not be allowed back in the NFL. What he did was despicable. The NFL needs to start cracking down on criminals being allowed in the NFL. Just because they have talent does not mean they should be allowed to do whatever they want. By allowing them to continue to play after incidents, the NFL is basically saying they can do whatever they want. That should stop. It's not just the NFL...sports in general. Athletes, music, movie stars...they need to learn they are not above it all.<br>  <br>  AC Stylin ~ What human killers are playing in the NFL?|`|tzrLDbHWaa	Yes.  He did his time, whereas we have murderers in the league who have never even been punished.  Most offenses by high profile athletes go unpunished.  Vick actually paid his debt to society, give him a break.|`|tOIhNyCJaa	hes my brother so hell yeah!!!!!|`|0E8SPyyXaa	Yes he served his time and its better that he goes to a team so he can be Dicipline and think about football 24/7|`|pg5AHNcdaa	No, but we all know he will. And a team will pick him up.|`|yg3Pveakaa	"NO''..He is such a loser..|`|8QZDwehtaa	I cant believe this!!! 16 players violated 1 rule in 07 and they never came back but Micheal Vick violated the rules 5 times and he is coming back CRAZY!!!!!  (but the NFL could use his talent)|`|pOLBKKNpaa	yes<br>  <br>  he served his sentence<br>  <br>  however I don't think he will be a good quarterback and might make a better wide receiver or third down running/passing threat|`|f9d88043d8ba88ae6d8cec415fe76179aa	Yes, once he is released from prison he should get another chance.|`|c4b596d15eac948f611f72b6a99f85a0aa	Absolutely, Yes.|`|5etFAmrsaa	Should he? No<br>  <br>  Will he? Yes|`|nF9DZ0sOaa	No.  He's a creep.|`|q34vCB3Qaa	never|`|ETfgBxUbaa	i hate him but i say yes everyone makes mistakes|`|zcyTx4NZaa	"What human killers are playing in the NFL?"<br>  <br>  Ray Lewis for one.<br>  <br>  And Vick will be back. The 49ers have already shown interest in acquiring his rights from Atlanta. And I say let him. He served his time and if a team is willing to take him and all the baggage that comes with him then so be it.|`|bIbyAkHPaa	HELL NO!!!!!|`|LaKa3NYvaa	I think he should never be eligible for a job again. <br>  Why do I think that?<br>  Well, first off, you never touch an animal, that is so very very wrong. That poor soul must have suffered..<br>  may Micheal Vick burn in hell..or reside in heaven if god can forgive him.|`|KCS862Qaaa	Hell no. hes an animal beating fag|`|B46t8gkLaa	yes i think he will.|`|X6ZxYovlaa	Yes!<br>  <br>  I'm tired of everyone saying he shouldn't be.  He apologized, he did his time, he lost all his money and endorsements, and his reputation was ruined.  He didn't hurt anyone, just some dogs.  Everyone deserves a second chance.|`|6rHhrcWGaa	he shouldnt be....but hes going to end up in the nfl again|`|uU15o7Mbaa	yes he is not the only player in the nfl to do something wrong|`|e00627d6bcb03c3c3a41eb2fe611f647aa	Yes i think he should because there are human killers in the nfl and people dont see problem in that. Since when are dogs over humans?<br>  The question really is if someone will take a chance on him. that i dont know.|`|n3Pmuavnaa	yes heres why<br>  <br>  people like pacman who were involved with shootings and guns, attempts to kill people... <br>  <br>  yes what he did was wrong... but really... im sure he wont screw up a second time like pacman|`|AA11758925	He will be- i think pacman jones should be banned for life- thrown in prison for life|`|EKoRHgdgaa	No, what he did was wrong and would send a horrible message.|`|PSo5AwuKaa	no, hes a disgrace to the NFL and society. he deserves to serve more time then he already is|`|bgKitk9paa	No. He's a loser.|`|hzLQN2Heaa	Yes, he should be re-instated by the NFL, and no he shouldn't have to work for the ASPCA. I agree with the Chief. He served his sentence, and therefore he's served his debt to society.<br>  And what human killers are playing in the NFL? Leonard Little of the Rams. He was driving drunk when he killed someone. And he's been caught driving drunk since then! And if THAT guy is allowed back in the NFL, then MIchael Vick should be!<br>  And maybe Ray Lewis killed those two guys, and maybe he ordered his cronies to do it while he sat in his limo. You know what didn't kill them? Smoking.|`|xsuR8VJqaa	No, I don't. He had everything going for him and screwed it up. He knew what he was doing was wrong, but he did it anyway. He's been given so many opportunities that he needs to land on his own feet from now on and learn that just being talented in football doesn't get you everything you want. <br>  <br>  I'm a Virginia Tech student, and I'm embarrassed that we attended the same university. Yes, he basically put VT on the map in terms of football, but then he pretty much dragged the name through the dirt. He and his younger brother have skills, but not smarts. They didn't realize what chances they had and were too stupid to give back what they got.|`|qbOEN99Vaa	Yes I think he should be reinstated, he has served his time, and everyone deserves a second chance. I don't approve of what he has done in the past, but I believe it is time to move on, I hope everyone can move on also.|`|uvVMe2oDaa	noone would want him.|`|7m4tJffDaa	Yes!!! big time|`|20B68c1iaa	I would love to say yes. He was my favorite player before he got busted, scrambling quarterbacks are wonderful to watch.<br>  <br>  But what message would it send? Not a good one to all the young Michael Vick fans out there.|`|54587a005ce491d9b4862a09ef7af9acaa	Yes. He did His time and, though I in no way approve of what He did, I don't think that anyone, once they have fulfilled their commitments, should be deprived of their right to earn a living.|`|u0gFqbALaa	If he would accept a prerequisite of working 1 year for the ASPCA then go through combines again, I wouldn't have a problem. If not, then no.|`|cmkMBwTTaa	yes, why not? because he killed some dogs? dont get me wrong i love dogs but for a man to be taken out of his career because of that is not fair he already served his time get off his nuts|`|haR4lEhlaa	No. But then again, if he was reinstated he wouldn't be the only felon in the NFL.|`|S8dWlDvWaa	He served his time, now let him go back to doing what he was good at, if his arm is still good.
CyMJj1Mvaa	I think ALL the Divas have had some sort of plastic surgery.  Especially boob jobs.  But I  think mostly Candice Michelle.  Everytime you see new photos of her on wwe.com she looks different.  Especially her lips.  Sometimes they are just HUGE. And honestly, all the divas were just fine before, so I don't get the deal with all the surgery.  Makes them look worse :)|`|5f6fbccb8643408cbd62a8431b3e5c44aa	Jillian Hall is the girl with the most plastic surgery by far.|`|JiCfYfLraa	jillian hall because she got breast implants and liposuction the other wwe divas only get breast implants. jillian hall messed herself up she looks weird at times she looks kinda like that ugly blonde monster girl from  grease. but at the same time jillian hall looks good she has some sexy eyes. look at her photos on wwe.com there solid she isnt really ugly its just the surgery and the faces she makes.|`|sMTNLNF6aa	Candice Michelle|`|dGYR81enaa	Jillian Hall look at the size of her cheeks she cant even move her face lol!|`|Z0IKiIJ4aa	i agree with the Jillian Hall answer.|`|S0u3HKzhaa	Jillian Hall or Candice Michelle you can tell they have had a lot.|`|J1mIAF3kaa	Tish|`|HdjNf7cuaa	Candice

CoHl61Hjaa	: . No No No NO NO !!  o    CONTRADICTION - springs to mind ole chap !    We've gone from 900's to 800's - to reduce  speed and power ....    To every electronic / computerised / enhancing  rider aid device - with the hope of closer  competitiveness .........    To 2009 'Saving MotoGP' - ways in which to  reduce costs ........    To NOW - and the next big thing .... COSTLY  aids to bring in the power and speed again !!!    Huh - what's that all about ? (typical of the MALE  organisation skills - LOL) @//(*_*)\\@  - XxX -    I don't doubt the need for all this development  stuff - but from a racing point of view ...    ....

You're right about making the distance easier, but what about tyre management..we shall have to wait and see i think.    One thing puzzles me from the report however, it says that Tommy Koyama made a flier off the line. making up 8 or 9 places, surely it would'nt be available off the line, i thought it had to create the energy first, through braking  and such......|`|LDVEzHsvaa	Fantastic idea.    I was going to say " fantastic idea ....... if it works " but with Harrold Bartol holding the spanners then it will work.    Your right about the MPG, on the 125's its really not needed, but can you remember Nicky on the HRC at Assen ? Ran out of fuel on the last corner.    I think, if this helps speed with out changing safety, its  got to be good for Dorna.|`|IuwVj2kGaa	I dont think this is a good idea right now, and to be honest not even in the future for MotoGP. As Dorna and FIM are trying to cut expenses and bring cost down it will be difficult to do it in today's environment.     I dont think there is enough technical, economical or competitive advantages to justify such a complex pursuit.    Considering the case in F1 most teams are complaining about how expensive its been the development for them. In a year when they   are supposed to bring cost down, they are using quite a lot of money on this idea.  (a Max Mosleys whim for many)    The KERS idea in formula 1 is a gimmick to portray a politically correct stand over an environmental issue. As F1 racing is everything but environmental friendly, they have to do something to improve their image. From the outside it looks like the Formula 1 teams are developing something that will transfer benefits for the normal cars. I do not think thats the case. IMO the technology will not have any use in normal cars because of the cost-benefit ratio. The energy used to break on a sedan is SIGNIFICANTLY less that that used on a Formula 1 car, therefore the amount of recovered and stored energy is much lower and not necessarily usable (perhaps on hybrids).    Sorry I switched to F1 to answer the question, but I think MotoGP should learn from the mistakes of others, and I firmly believe F1 dropped the ball on this one.|`|WlSelrj5aa	Back to electric bikes next !!!!!!!!!!!  its a stage further you know. XxX      and you are all panicking about the B.B.C. eh.|`|ZjbbrRVoaa	Hello Proc,    This Kers system is completely in the prototype spirit, and as others answered (I couldn't come up with anything else heheh) I also agree it may not be implemented right now because of the costs, or if it makes the bikes go unsafely fast. I think that, if they start using Kers, they will try to maintain the speed spending less fuel :)    But I'm really amazed that KTM has done that!  One thing I "dig" a lot about this idea is that it contributes to changing the general (?) "underpowered" view on electric powered vehicles

I personally think that we will have to fight hard for La Liga title at the end of the season and that we won't win CL because this team is not ready yet, it's Pep's and Messi's as a leader first season.... but maybe Pep will be lucky like Benitez and he'll win it first season already :)))|`|p4H61jQDaa	they aren't overhyped, they are a solid team and the best one atm in the world, it all depends on the trophies they win.

This has gotten to the point of NO RESPECT and no class. Bobby Convey called Rafa Marquez arrogant and full of himself IN AN INTERVIEW and we all know about Sanchez's attempted slide for Johnson (on youtube) when he got scored on the second time as well as his comments. Donovan peeing on Jalisco Stadium. There is INTENSE HATE between the Mexicans and the United States fans as well.     like the article said, we dont boast a Ronaldo or Messi or Kaka but we have pretty good players who absolutely HATE each other.    Every game is good and i truly do believe that Brasil x Argentina is a baby rivalry compared to Mexico x USA    its not the level, its the matchup    the only rivalry that comes close/is on par is Argentina x England      REMEMBER, its the best RIVALRY, not the best players maybe but man there is fire in the eyes of every player in every game of Mexico vs. USA

He may wrestle in the US, but i dont want him too. I much prefer him wrestling in CMLL. Mainly because if he went to WWE, lol, he would not be used and watered down to 3 moves like Rey (if you have seen which i assume you have, his WCW HH match with Eddie in 1997), he can do alot more. Either way, i would like Mistico to say were he is, i like watching him in CMLL. He'd just be watered down or 'not fit in' in any promotion in the US. ROH is debatable because of the spots, but even then. He is talented, i'd like to see him go far, i just cant see a 'right' promotion (apart from CMLL), were he would be used to the best of his ability.|`|1z7M3Tntaa	I think he would if CMLL would let him , i read somewhere that he wanted to wrestle in places like TNA but his contarct wouldn't let him do that, something along those lines.

2ece24deba6e7760d2c205b331e95863aa	Since the gases exit the sides of the muzzle break almost entirely, the silencer will have little to no effect on noise.  The muzzle brake will actually increase the noise level at the shooters position a great deal compared to a gun without a muzzle brake.    Even the gap on a revolver between the cylinder and barrel reduces the effectiveness of a silencer so much that no one goes to the trouble of suppressing one.  A few exceptions are the 1895 Nagant which seals the gap with a cylinder that moves forward, and some revolvers that are custom made to have a very small gap.    On the other hand, muzzle brakes and flash suppressors are commonly used to mount silencers, but the brake is completely enclosed inside of the silencer.|`|xOReEw6Waa	The pressure peak will follow the path of least resistance and exit the muzzle break, not reaching the suppressor. Muzzle breaks usually make the weapon much louder because the gases can escape that much faster and in a more radial pattern than from just the muzzle end.|`|Y4RS35M7aa	Escape through the muzzle break, which, by the way, makes your weapon really, really, LOUD!  I had a Browning A-bolt with the BOSS, and that thing sounded like a cannon!

If theer is, Man city will get them. So Chelsea are in a mess, signing Quaresma shows that.|`|no3tD0OSaa	Biggest Flop?  He hasnt even kicked a ball and your dissing him already?|`|zJCWIWE0aa	He taught Ronaldo how to do step overs|`|V8HwYLlXaa	Scraping the barrel comes to mind. Aw well he is a winger. There might be some width in that team after all.|`|LyoKmnZZaa	work on ur footie knowledge|`|ccXJo7xUaa	Scolari has panick-bought, though he is better than malouda!|`|OKgbeWe3aa	Are you serious? Lucas for Liverpool is the biggest flop ! He always messes up somewhere, be it giving away a penalty or getting yellow carded for silly challenges.    Quaresma at least has class, and can pass the ball properly and can cross so he's not a flop. He just hasn't gotten the chance to shine like Keane at Liverpool.|`|yMP6mS2Vaa	no hes quite good tbh    plus chelsea have been struggling for wide players     its just no 1 have been giving him a proper chance|`|jiFHJ6daaa	i think he will work in chelsea|`|C6d5yElWaa	I think the biggest flop in football is a certain captain of Tottenham Hotspur... Formerly known as:   "the final piece to the Liverpool jigsaw?"  and   "him and 'Nando will be the best strikeforce ever!?"   ...among other gems ?|`|m7tjMSDCaa	i think he is overated, i remember in euro 08 when everyone wanted him because he tapped in a simple goal as a sub...|`|Hiasgb75aa	Yes. The fake Ronaldo. And he's older than Ronaldo!
KR1FdEZgaa	i think maybe pete rose? i am most likely wrong.|`|36zm5zK8aa	i think its Joe DiMaggio|`|40Ow9B1maa	its joe dimmagio and the qoute goes    '' There is always some kid who may be seeing me for the first time. I owe him my best''|`|WeEjc79Uaa	That would be Joe diMaggio. The quote is: There is always some kid seeing me for the first or last time, i owe him my best. Hope i helped.|`|a9d1c39e771753ee705728da48b7614eaa	I have a pretty good idea about what that quote is, but I cant remember exactly how it goes or who said it. But  Im pretty sure that it wasnt Manny Ramirez!|`|gwKxe7gGaa	Uh, pretty sure it was Joe Dimaggio|`|qTIWiOI1aa	I know it's Joe D. the Yankee Clipper
oSakZ1asaa	I'd go with the .22 to save money on ammo. I'd go for the .25 for more power. For the money, if it has to be .22 you are better off with an RWS 34P in .22. I'd choose the Walther if I really wanted .25, which is very interesting.|`|EGe0k8P6aa	You're not going to see much difference in performance, depending on the weight of the pellets you feed the gun. The .22 will shoot flatter and there are a number of heavy (20+ grain pellets available) which puts the .22 in the same weight range as the .25. Additionally the .22 caliber pellet will offer you a wider range of pellets. The only reason I can see for going with the .25 is if you want a little bit more power (though again, this is marginal depending on the pellets you use).|`|royw12RXaa	Go with the 22 cal. While the 25 will offer a little more knock down power and will buck the wind a little better, the long range trajectory will be much more pronounced than the 22. So if you sight in at, say, 20 yds, you will have to aim high at 50 yds. If you sight in at 50, you will be high at 20-25 yds.<br>  <br>  Also, not too many stores carry 25 cal pellets, so unless you have an air rifle store in your neighborhood, you might have to order your 25 cal pellets on line or thru the mail. There is also a much greater selection of 22 pellets than 25.
MTbgg5eyaa	Yeah, and please remember, that one loss you have in the Q.|`|xhHfXuKFaa	the lebrons can't beat the lakers. they won't even make it past boston anyway.|`|3teWTOPqaa	You mean like the way Cavs manhandled the Lakers in the 2 regular season meetings? Oh yeah I will be looking forward to that, but just a quick advice, get past the Celtics first.|`|lMDy8W0Raa	The Cavs won't be playing the finals, sorry, but have fun watching the Celtics beating Lebron and Co.|`|AA11580219	Yea right. The Lakers will kill the Cavs. Kobe will own LeBron in his sleep|`|1Z0Lmrk1aa	Thanks for the Karma boost fool.|`|2db7f31f8de2a63df2848a630426eea7aa	Ha I agree, there are other teams in both conferences.|`|Cm2vFHQDaa	the laker are lucky they didn't have to play cleveland tonight. i think the cavs will finally get the respect they deserve if they win the finals. i really think they can do it if they stay healthy. the laker fans are use to having their hearts broken.|`|38634d724472d6d2e903c2fa2cae8951aa	If the Cavs actually beat the Celtics you mean? Doubt it. <br>  <br>  Celtics will repeat as Champs. If LA does make it to the finals for the west the C's will beat them again. Playoffs are very different from regular season.|`|GERlmBIUaa	Dang we don't even no if thats the finals even though thats most likely... there are OTHER teams in both confrences..|`|AA10451854	It's too soon to tell. We don't even know if the Cavaliers and the Lakers will ever get that far.|`|WLXFAeSnaa	Most of them. The only ones whose won't be broken, are the ones that know the Cavs deserved it.|`|H8u7gMAYaa	Don't get too cocky now..|`|1AzCDrO6aa	get past the celtics first.|`|1w9yuykxaa	0 because cavs are overrated or my bad lebron is lol and they got owned with and without bynum and lakers owned there home record..im going with celtics or magic to beat cavs *** when nelson comes back.Lakers and Magic if nelson is healthy|`|E6wEf4sAaa	none david stern wont allow the cavs to win because he wants lebron to test the free agent market because of the attention he will draw. And lebron will def. test it if he doesnt win it all with the cavs|`|9nTqx0sRaa	none the cavs don't have the caliber to **** with the lakers|`|k5TKF2rRaa	None the Lakers will beat the Cavs|`|xpR64O9Maa	One million billion.
r5AMG8g7aa	It not worth bothering with. After more than 41 years of martial arts training, i can tell you that there are no quick and easy martial arts. Like the old saying goes, "If it looks to good to be true, it probably is".  Find a known style and stick to it.|`|YDpT2ClBaa	there is not such thing as fast an easy self defense.<br>  <br>  it takes time to learn and be proficient at self defense. you can not learn self defense in a few short weeks of class. you are best looking for a legitimate style with a good instructor that can teach you properly.|`|3DnX9NmAaa	I've never heard of it. You're not going to learn much in a very short amount of time. It take years of practice and training. I'd stick with a well established and respectable martial art.<br>  <br>  I highly doubt the American special forces are learning a "rape defense" system. It's not like the war is in San Fransisco.|`|qhdjpMPJaa	looks like a joke to me, you should probably look elsewhere.|`|v1mbL56caa	Years in the arts and I haven't heard of it.|`|AA11101806	looks fake / like a scam
6W68Qftdaa	sounds like your looking for a road course if your looking for a public track day.  Michigan does have an infield road course which might be open to the public.  also check out Gingerman, Grattan and Waterford hills.|`|FcRsyDf4aa	Berlin Raceway near Grand Rapids is owned by Johnny Benson.  Good short track, ASA runs on<br>  <br>  also theres Kalamazoo raceway that the nascar local regional series runs on<br>  <br>  theres another local short track near flint thats good<br>  <br>  theres local short tracks all over the place in every state just about you just have to look for them
cb2NxPERaa	It is easy within 30 minutes. I can say that and I swim 3 times a week for an hour. If you barely swim then you better training, because you're not going to pass. You would have to do each of the 25's at an average of 30 seconds for 40 laps. If that seems hard to you then you should train.|`|n4tPArAAaa	1000 meters is easy to swim within 30 monutes i think|`|wZYPFtL9aa	on average a 100 is like about maybe a little over 1:00 and then if you times that by 10 probably like 10-15 minutes      you sound like a terrific swimmer,     im glad i could help,     im in swimming and have been for 35+ years ,   and i know my stuff,     hope that helped you out some?|`|cPMQyxfJaa	well i can do 1000 in about 12 min but im on a swim team and most people on swim teams can do 1650 in about 19 min so if you get a little practice you may be able to  ok 13 year old swimmer does 1000 in 12-13 min|`|zmhQdYbDaa	I don't think you should have a huge problem with it, but you should definitely time yourself before you go for the job just so you know what you're capable of before you go. If you're over 20 minutes, you might want to wait until later to go for the job. If you're under 20 minutes, then congrats!    I have swam 1000 meters in 10 minutes, but I also train 10 times a week.|`|pXhoYvzkaa	okay on average a 100 is like about maybe a little over 1:00 and then if  you times that by 10 probably like 10-15 minutes|`|rXuSL76saa	My friend is 14, and he could do 1650 in less than 20 min. Like 19:30.  Around that time.   I think its possible. Maybee even too easy. I'm sure if you know how to swim, ever been on a swim team, or aree really fast in the water, then you'll be able to do it.|`|EBW1dk4Zaa	I can swim around 1800m in 20 mins however I train 8 times a week.    It isn't going to be reallyy hard but I'd recommend you get in a little bit of practice. Maybe 2 1 hour a week sessions.
