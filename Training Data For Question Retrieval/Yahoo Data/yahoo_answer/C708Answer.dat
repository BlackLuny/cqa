NrwJyffxaa	Don't wait for him to come home to start foreplay.  Do things that will remind him of sex during the day.   Put a pair of panties in his brief case.  Send him a text/email.   Put a condom on his gear shift in his car.  Make sure what ever you do doesn't get out in public eyes so you don't embarrass him or yourself.  Put things in his socks or shoes.  Leave him voice messages.  If he thinks about sex enough he will want it more. It will really help if you can twist a word that he has to use at work everyday to have a double meaning.  You could schedule an appointment at his clinic go in and say your having heart problems. Since you have appointment tell him how your heart has a empty feeling.  Say it get stronger as other areas .....are neglected and ask if the doctor would write a prescription for sexual activity that you can then go home and get filled by your husband.    He probably has a busy life make him stop and smell the roses.|`|8F33NnyYaa	i really understand you, i had this for 4 yrs, ive just filed for divorce, my husband never wanted me, last year we had sex 4 times, i felt so ugly and low, after the talking, begging , pleading, dressing up, going south for him to look down at me and say im really not in the mood, i stopped asking then i stopped approaching him, i know his ok down there so i asked him to go councilling we did!! and guess what he told me he doesn't like me all the time!!!!! well hey that was for 4 years this problem and i stuck with him through that but now im getting out, the damage it caused my self esteem is endless, im scared and on tablets to calm my nerves but i will make it through, you and me we are not the first and wont be the last, i wish you luck, but don't beg honey because you will always remember that awful feeling and it doesnt feel good x|`|Ki1gWTzzaa	This is frustrating for many! but i guess being a doctor, he says a lot of problematic people all day!    However he will need to understand your needs, as sex is important for a healthy marriage... Have you dressed your self up sexy, and walked around the house to arouse him. Does he like you talking to him in a different way?  You can change your environment at home to relax him more, and maybe give him a massage...    or you could suggest he prescribe some energy pills for himself.LOL|`|I71ePk4Haa	He either doesn't find you attractive, or he's got a very low sex drive. Hate to tell you, but it's probably not going to get any better. Your probably going to have to look outside the marriage for sexual fulfillment, or you need to consider a divorce (the better option).|`|AA10377289	girl, if your a doctor.. you see a lot of sick people, see female organs with yeast infections, crabs and all that kind of stuff.. will you still have sex at night? its hard but try to find some solution. talk to him.|`|ghHpGlVDaa	Your husband most probably works long hours and is exhausted.  A Doctors job is stressful and hard work.  Maybe you both need to take a relaxing holiday away together, so he can relax and be intimate.

ErGQOhjqaa	You are not to blame.  However, your co-worker should be deeply ashamed of herself!  She had no business involving herself in the situation.  Having said that, for one to take their own life, there have to be problems other than an isolated incident at a party.  If it was so bad, he could have simply moved to another job and let it go.  If he could not work through it, he was suffering in other areas of his life.|`|eiJOdPgxaa	Who knows. A person who takes his own life generally (and that IS a generalisation) has the balance of mind which is disturbed.  Your comments might have played a very small part, but I suspect your colleague should feel rather more guilt that you.      At the end of the day, he was responsible for his own actions - presumably at the works christmas do, and perhaps felt so badly about his own actions that killing himself seemed the only course open to him.|`|5769f110474fd157a0d6c0b3ca8ac6d8aa	Your colleague would have asked others for the information.    The bottom line is:  it is no one's fault.  Your friend made a mistake and didn't face up to it - he should have been able to deal with it or get through it.  Yes, it is sad - we should all learn a lesson from this.  But ultimately, the fault is his.
0835a06f68b65ba961b10b96482def90aa	honestly i would be like i have no idea why don't you ask her . i wouldn't get in the middle and tell ur friend (girl) that he likes her and when he asks he if she likes him back to be gentle when she tells him no .|`|veZLfnGFaa	Just tell him that you don't think they will be a good pair.

Why do you need encouraging words? Are you afraid he might hurt you or something? If you are wait until he goes out for a few hours and pack your things. I am not judging you, but I see this type of things from my family. Living together is not a good thing at all. I bet it was all good at once and then simmered down later. i wish you luck.|`|NWH3MnE9aa	Find someone else you care more about; ie, sleep with a few of those hot guys you know. Believe me, it'll make it easier to leave. Good luck and great sex to you!|`|sCwe3rVNaa	I'm not saying it's true, but have you considered he might be just as relieved to see you go?  I don't say that to be mean, but sometimes when two people can't get along, there is relief on both sides when it ends.  Just say you're leaving and then go.|`|sXVLD2whaa	This too shall pass.......just go, you know what you have to do, don't peel that band off too slowly .|`|Uv7tkyBPaa	If Neither of you is happy and you both don't want to work it out, I don't think it will be a big issue when you leave. Just pack your bags, get up and get going. Better for both of you if you don't make a big scene.|`|naequcqlaa	The courage you need is the word acceptance!  Accept the fact this relationship is NOT working & that neither of you are happy in it.  Once you accept this fact, it w/give you the courage to be able to move on.  Know things do happen for a reason.  That's one thing I've learned in life.  We might not know the reason now, but there IS a reason.  You can be glad this happened before you got more serious & actually got married.  So that's one thing you can be grateful for.  You know it is not going to be a shock to him that things are not working out between the two of you.  You just haven't found the rite person yet, & that's the only reason it's not working out.  When you do, believe me you'll know it!  You can make it on your own, so don't be afraid of that.  You'll have the freedom to go on w/your life & find true happiness.  You need to do this for both your sakes.  So take control of you life, your mind, & accept the fact your going to go on, you're going to move FORWARD.  In time you can put the past in the past, & go forward to a whole new beginning.  I certainly wish you the best, & know you CAN do it...:)|`|fd800537157025b01ab2fd3e2bfd7b53aa	You deserve to be loved. Deep  down, you know what real love is, and it's not what you were getting in this relationship. Your gut feeling is telling you "leave". You know deep down that it is right. You've made a decision. Your over-protective mind kicks in and starts telling you all sorts of "what ifs" cause all your mind wants for you is safety. Not happiness, but safety. It knows very well that you survived with this guy, so it wants to keep you there just in case. Your mind is worried cause it is not possible to know the future, it is not possible to know every detail of how your life would be when you step out that door. However, it is quite predictable what will happen if you were to stay - another argument tomorrow, another heartache. Crappy, heh? But it's comfort zone... Hey, I know it's not comfortable to get out, and it never will be. But you know what to do. Pack. Decide where to go. Decide on means of transportation. And go.    We experience a sence of loss no matter what kind of relationship we end - good or bad. A sence of loss is normal. All it means that you're wishing things would have been different with this guy. But they aren't.
yRpS6mNbaa	no because if ya do go out  you already started the relationship lying  so just tell him straight up that you like him|`|ovDqPtg8aa	yeah, ot works like a charm.! haha. i did the same thing.|`|AA11352641	No, just send him messages and see if he seems interested. You have a legitimate link to him, no reason to play games.|`|55pSqrDcaa	wow you have serious issues|`|ErNNjUdjaa	Oh no that just leads to drama and trouble.  I say just talk to him not over myspace and not using any fake account but rather see him face to face.  It's just the most efficient way, don't let myspace take over your mind!|`|pzJpT9xhaa	I would advice u not to do it cause I done that on facebook and I found out that my old crush lead me on cause I went under a different name and now we both hate each other I would suggest be urself and just add him as ur friend and then tell him that u have a crush on him.

yTD84yFlaa	The truth.|`|f1e26c00ff0b203d167fe64871d3eb87aa	It's impossible to answer this question because there is no reference point.  It is the kind of question which produces a logic error in computers because if you are a liar, then this statement becomes a lie meaning you tell the truth but if you tell the truth then it is a lie and you always tell the truth.    You can only get a certain answer if you have two people, one who always tells the truth and one who always lies.  Then they give some sort of challenge.  Watch Labyrinth and you'll see what I mean.|`|domEftoIaa	you are telling the truth that you lie?????????????????????
ZE6XtxgZaa	first i'd like to ask... whats so annoying about taking it slow? does your boyfriend say anything about it? sex changes EVERYTHING in the relationship and you should feel comfortable with the person you're with before doing anything past kissing. sweetie i've dated both men and women before and believe me, one of the best parts about the relationship is before sex, when you appreciate little things about the other person, like watching a movie while cuddling on the couch or just simply spending time together. be honest with him and if he has a problem with doing just kissing for a while then he's not even worth your time|`|eYYsxTXraa	never be scared to kiss anyone. i can always sense the fear when i lean in or they want to kiss me but are scared to do so. theres not that many ways to mess up at kissing.      *tip. never open your mouth all the way .  big mistake commonly made by a person that doesnt kiss people .  [:    good luck !|`|b0NCSShfaa	tell him youre not ready to do anything else|`|Vf5OnZ4Caa	just take it slow- get used to kissing, then making out, then start letting him touch your hip, back, boobs and wait till you get comfortable with that and make it a progression. good luck|`|MHQVnqaXaa	relax. dont do anything you dont want to or you'll regret it. but sit down and think about what makes you so nervous about it. are you religious? would you feel guilty? are you worried about diseases or pregnancy? you have got to find the root of the stress before it can go away.|`|5Tdz1q3Maa	if ur not ready, just tell him. if he really luvs u, he'll totally understand. i used to be like u, so just tell ur bf about it.|`|3JfADTIDaa	You're like that because you have a good head on your shoulders. The best way to explain to him is just tell him in your own words. Or write him a letter, that way you can make sure you say everything you want to- and not say anything you don't want to. Also that way you can not be interrupted. Good Luck!|`|F3VjJAdiaa	everyone is nervous the first time. if you trust him and love him just take it slow and you will know when to move past the just kissing part.|`|7b1f8172d4a9ac10c23b5f3870728bb8aa	its normal to be like that.    just tel him your not ready for anything else. if he loves you for you and not your body...hell understand and be just fine with it.|`|i7rYRvlTaa	thats kinda sad|`|fxxLgQrdaa	just tell him your inexperienced and want to takes things slow|`|tOoJL7sYaa	he'll understand, just tell him! im the same way.|`|qpAYU8Knaa	May be because subconsciously you think it is wrong to go beyond kissing and you don't want to do it. You are only 18 and if you have this automatic self control then don't blame yourself. You will stop doing it when you meet the right person.|`|fe2879005f528660584d6c591d71e1e9aa	jus tell him ur not ready yet..if he really love you he'll understand|`|LZKzV6zIaa	cool everyone else answering has no pic.  but any way just tell him.|`|1H56FPt8aa	Tell him directly. If he cares he will help you through it & if he doesn't then you know hes a jerk.    Haha otherwise he might start thinking he is doing something wrong.|`|odQewFgvaa	He will figure it out. Just tell him the truth.   I don't think you are abnormal. Obviously there are some people more comfortable with it.  It isn't a bad thing that you put thought into who and what you are doing.|`|Q8CS0x0Kaa	There's not a really easy way, just flat out tell him that your nervous and scared and don't really know what to do. If he really loves you and cares about you, he will completely understand.|`|MzVjkC9Kaa	just tell him. its fine, you shouldn't be worried. just try to go past kissing so you can get over your fear of it. (the first time may hurt so don't give up after the first time!)  if your boyfriend is good he will accecpt that you only want to kiss.  good luck! :]|`|8vfCRg7Caa	i didnt have sex till i was 21, so i dont know what to tell you. And i married the girl, now after that........im  going to say ive had my share of action. But at 18, and im a guy, i would be nervous as hell. So nothing is wrong with that, you should tell your patner so you dont get those stupid *** questions people like to give you all the time. "why are you not into this", "whats wrong". Even at my age i still get dumb as questions. People are sensitive during the time of passion, so speak up and say your feelings especially if you plan on doing what your doing with the person more than once. it makes everybodys job a little easier.|`|U1e7wJgYaa	obviously u love this person enough to let him kiss u. ask him to wait until you are ready but if he cant wait then he doesn't love you he just want to bet in your pants make a wise choice girl|`|twz3jQ1iaa	just tell him|`|OJJWNuDdaa	just do it. what ever it is. just make sure your boyfriend knows how far you want to go and DONT let him do anything you dont want to do.|`|XRD7qfg7aa	don't do anything past kissing. wait til ya married to him. you seem to have nice morals. congrats|`|m88ELjmPaa	You should just tell him straight to the point. You have all right not to do anything else with him. If he doesnt understand he is just a bad boy that wants only your vagina. If he understands, he will wait until you feel comfortable doing it. but the first time is always kinda scary that will never change.|`|brKp7aF6aa	JUST EXPLAiN iT TO HiM. iF HE TRUELY CARES ABOUT YOU, HE WiLL DEFiNATLY UNDERSTAND THAT YOU ARE JUST NOT READY TO MOVE TO THAT LEVEL. iF HE DOESNT UNDERSTAND AND PUSHES YOU TO TRY TO DO iT, GET OUT OF THE RELATiONSHiP, BC iF HE DOESNT RESPECT YOUR CHOiCES AND DECiSiONS THEN THE RELATiONSHiP WiLL MOST PROBABLY END BADLY, OR YOU WiLL END UP REGRETTiNG iT.|`|h0oceAwAaa	be like.. im only comfortable with the kissing stage so far.  when u get more comfortable, then you make the next move  to give him the signal that ur ready for the next stage=]|`|wnME0d4uaa	its okay i was like that too. But my boyfriend showed me that he wont hurt me and use me like other guys will and he said that he will wait for me to be ready and he doesnt want to force it on me.

She needs to stop being so insecure, and I can assure you she did her share of casual encounters to try to get over you as well.|`|Ki1gWTzzaa	give her more love! when you see those girls, give her a passioate kiss, and tell her who you love! and ingnore the other girls!|`|4B93B5H9aa	Too late, the past is already over.|`|nz2T73NPaa	How would you feel if your girl friend had sex with another man?   Even if your were on a break.|`|4POGapREaa	Just face it.  No girl wants to walk around with her LONG TERM boyfriend & run into chicks that he put his penis in.  Simple.  And then to add insult to injury THEY are giving HER dirty looks so she gets a double whammy.  Nice.  She's probably more pissed off at your lack of good judgment than anything else.  Broken up or not, you shouldn't have been screwing chicks that are that close to home & that are also apparently immature b*tches.  I'd be rolling my eyes at you too.|`|DDYwnut6aa	Perhaps she is angry because you went out looking for others even though you were apart for only for a week or two at a time.  To me, that says, "You didn't mean much, I'll just get a replacement.  No need to mourn the relationship."
p1RdTbP2aa	Get over your self mate god doesn't do this to us if you trust your faith then you would know. And stop feeling sorry for your if you want some thing go and get it, the only reason your hating is because you saw her as the only good thing in your life and now your looking for something to blame move on and stop trying to pin point the blame.|`|wJ1v0cX0aa	you are normal average guy, in love with a spoiled brat. You are probably afraid that she falls in love with a rich spoiled sexy guy and she might because she is available. If she doesn't give a **** for you, why do you give her so much importance ? you deserve a loving woman, and she is probably not the one.    She is used to her kind of lifestyle. Now, think of it, if you lived with her, you'd be there always trying to save and she would be there complaining she can't buy all those expensive useless stuff by spending your paycheck, she will be unhappy.    She is not rich, her parents are. Don't admire rich spoiled kids, you're worth much more. Find yourself a better girl.|`|miRVgJLmaa	sweetheart,  SHAKE IT OFF!!!!!  get your but up, go to the gym, make yourself available, and most of all, STOP COMPARING YOUR LIFE TO HERS!!!!!  she is no better than you and look at all the blessings you already have that she has absolutely no clue about.  trust me she will be the one having major problems later on due to being spoiled and always getting everything she wants.  it will be a miracle if she will ever find anyone who will be able to meet her standards of living.  trust me it is harder than you think for people of her status to ever be happy in a relationship because they are so use to having everything their way.  it sounds like she has ALOT OF GROWING UP TO DO. parents dont realize how much damage they cause by not teaching their children how to be responsible for themselves and how to budget money, and allowing them an oppurtunity to see what its like to not always get everything they want.  you on the other hand know all these things and therefore you would be better off with someone who can connect with you on a more spiritual level rather than a material one.  people dont flirt with you because you cut yourself off.  it is like you make it known, therefore,  you are non approachable because your so crazy and ate up with your ex and all her baggage.  get back to being yourself and doing things that make you happy and feel good about yourself.  just think you might have to study all the time now but what a payoff it is when you graduate and make the grade you know in your heart you can make.  the sooner your out of school the sooner you get on with your life as a professional adult doing whatever it is your heart desires.  the more you love yourself the more others will love you and i suggest you start by getting off your butt and getting back to living.  life is too short to sleep it away and if you believe in god then you know life is a gift and you should live like everyday is the last getting all you can out of each hour of each day.  we are all humans and no one is perfect even though it may seem that way on the surface but trust me life it what you make it and it sounds to me yours is pretty good.  dont throw away everything you have worked so hard for over a simple pretty rich girl.  i believe money can be the root of all evil it just depends how  its spent and what your morals and values truly are...  now get your butt to the gym and try to speak to at least one girl a day.  before you know it you will have girls talking to you all the time too.  good luck!
Jtd7kXQSaa	Now here is the thing. This is a 2way street honey. If he does not want you talking to your guy friends then why should you let him talk to his ex gf. Tell him it is either going to be you or her. If he loves you then he will drop her like a hot spork.
AA11022415	He's playing with you. Testing the waters. He probably just wants some attention because he knows that you like him. It's pretty mean really but people both guys and girls do this without even knowing it sometimes.

You are only alone in this if you choose to be.|`|f6YsGOynaa	If he's taking your checkbook and your child is witnessing his controlling and sometimes violent behavior, you are being abused.      Find a battered woman's shelter and get out.  Regardless of the fact that he may not have hit you, he's threatening you...especially if he's breaking things, and drunks can be VERY unpredictable.  Maybe the next time, it won't be something inanimate that he's breaking or pounding.. maybe the next time it will be you or your child.      If neither of you is working, where is your income coming from?  You should get a job.|`|n8lXItGraa	It sounds like there's a lot going on here.  He may be stressed because of school.  he might use the computer and alcohol as an escape from the stress.  I'm not making excuses for him, just trying to find probable reasons.  Was he always like this towards you or has this started since school started?  You don't have any money...more stress.  have you ever had a real heart to heart with him?  Some counseling maybe?  If you've tried everything and believe that leaving would be the best for all concerned, see if your family can help you get to them.  If your husband thinks that snatching the checkbook will keep you there, he has a few control issues also.  It's your choice.  If you don't want to be there, find a way out but don't let him know you're leaving.  Be careful.  Hope this helps...|`|NWH3MnE9aa	Been married 25 years, have a hellova temper, have NEVER raised my hand to my wife.

If after you've tried he doesn't listen/can't change, yu need to contact your family, ask if they will take you and your child in and leave him and get on your feet again and give yourself a two year period to really do so.    Sincerely,    Grace|`|S6FLJ64Qaa	You can call a battered women's shelter for free.  They'll come and get you or meet you in a place you can get too.  You won't need money in most cases.  They'll provide a modest stipend, perhaps a bus/plane ticket back to your family.  Issue solved....leave.  No one should be abused, unless you're a terrorist down in GITMO.    I think the major question, is you actually married someone who didn't or doesn't have a job.  Sure, it's good to get an education, but if you have kids before that happens, then school has to be placed on the back burner.  If someone decides to go back to school, then someone must work, and the student becomes the childcare provider. Even a female bird makes the male bird build her a nest before she mates with him.    Go home.  Be safe.  Next time find a real man, not just some male.|`|BC1XNijIaa	It seems ideal that your family are not close by because if you go to stay with them it will be difficult for him to follow you.

First, find your credit cards and checkbook so you do not leave anything important behind.  Same goes for birth certificates, vehicle titles, etc.  Good Luck|`|1SihjQh6aa	contact your local battered womans center, they can help you more than anyone, they will provide counseling, they can put you in a shelter, and help you get a job so you don't have to depend on anyone|`|5NKa5Y8laa	Report your credit cards as stolen, and get new ones.  Then pack up and leave him when he is not home.  Go back home to your family, if you dont have enough money, ask them for help. You have a child to care for, I dont believe your family would ignore the situation.    Leave him a note, or call him, and tell him that you love him but cannot live with him like this anymore, and that when he has cleaned up his act and is ready to be a real man in a real relationship, you will consider reconciling with him, but not before you both attend counselling together.  If he cannot be bothered with the effort to change, then he never will, and he's simply not worth it.|`|SHARt1k3aa	You only have one child.  Why don't you call your mother and explain the situation.  If you were my daughter, it would only take minutes before I had a plane ticket for you!  Family is there to help one another and it seems to me that you really need them right now.  Your thoughts on the situation your child is in are dead on!  You are 100% right, it is toxic.  But children are resilient, they bounce back really quick.  So, if I were you, I would start making some phone calls so you can get on with a healthy life for you and your child.  He doesn't have anything either, so why are you staying?  I mean, if you were near your family you might have child care and able to get a job.|`|FqV9oOYAaa	You have to leave. His abuse will only get stronger and probably lead to him hitting you. The child sees this and trust me he will remember all of this and will do the same to his spouse.
htWw0OlCaa	I think if your mom said that she doesn't want to be your mom any more is overreacting.... That's a ridicules thing to say to a child. I think when your mom cools off, she will see things differently and maybe let you go to the sleep over. And if she does leave you to your dad, maybe he wont have a problem with you going to the sleep over.....  I do hope things work out and everything will be ok, you really do need your mom and your dad. Best wishes|`|s6stLtvLaa	She is just upset.  Let her cool off and then go and talk to her.  Tell her you are sorry and didn't mean to upset her.  You have to remember, that when you are mad you tend to say things that you don't mean.  This is even true for parents.|`|mHpc7NUdaa	She is just mad right now. Apologize to her and try to talk it out without losing your temper.|`|UACIUmwtaa	did your mother say that she doesn't want to be your mom anymore??or are you just exaggerating? your mom is probably just mad and overreacted. try to talk it out with her...hopefully everything will get better.|`|RJb65ZuPaa	Im sure that she doesn't mean that, go apologise and have a nice talk sort things out and give her a hug.  Shes proberly just angry right now  She still loves you and she proberly only didn't let to a sleeep overs before because she was protecting you.    Hope i helped   x|`|pIagFECzaa	there will be other sleepovers!!!! she's never let you sleepover at anyone's house before?? geez. she's being overprotective but she cant stop being your mom anymore its not possible. really its not. next time you should slam the door to your house as well as the car. haha just kidding not really but maybe it would help if your mom talked to your friends mom. did u suggest that?huh?huh?huh?
YqoxcTN9aa	she will do what she wants unfortunately|`|VfcZvAbgaa	that is so sad.  i'm sorry about your situation. carnival rides don't sound like a good thing to me.  maybe by then she will have morning sickness and al that from the baby and wont want to go.  try and talk to her and tell her all the problems her baby could have and how she could have a birth defect when its born and shed have to live with it the rest of her life.  i hope it works out.|`|cIROBuszaa	She has no idea what she's getting into. She's not taking her pregnancy serious. Ask her if she even cares about this baby. She's going to have many responsibilities. Has she told her parents?   Tell her that she needs to to eat healthier for a healthy baby. Rides could hurt the baby.     If she's not willing to do this, she should get an abortion.   I know that's wrong, but yeah. =/    And if she wants to keep the baby or give it up for adoption, the baby's healthiness depends on her, and it's here job to that.    I wish you the best of luck to you friend and to you. =]|`|d1SdRRIaaa	its ok to worry about her. I mean i would also be telling her that she can harm the baby but if she doesnt want to listen oh well atleast you told her the right thing.|`|1DYMl9mPaa	tell her to come over your house and then tell her all the info but if she doesn't care say this "forget it if you want your baby to die don't cry to me and don't expect me to go to his or her funeral cause i told you to be careful."
XtvI9cVHaa	it was your first kiss with him  geez you need to be patient|`|sipXnwifaa	He might be too nervous, or even more likely he doesnt want to cheat on his girl.  If he frenched you, that is a much more powerful way of cheating than regular kissing so he wouldnt be able to lie about that if confronted.

AA12280291	Time is your new friend! It takes time to regain your independence and self confidence.  Don't think you NEED someone for that, that is probably what caused your self-esteem to go down!  You must first  "LOVE YOU," before you can LOVE anyone else, You cannot give away what you do not HAVE! Make sense?|`|jJwuMTSqaa	Yes, it is normal. You don't realize what you had until it is gone. You can not blame her for feeling the way she does. You broke up with her. Always think of consequences before doing something you might regret.|`|8F33NnyYaa	yes i think so, its such a huge change and its natural to find it hard to accept such a huge change, you need to mourn, you will get through this everyone does, you need to look for different activities to keep you active and busy this will help you, good luck|`|n8lXItGraa	Post breakup regrets are normal for any circumstances.  It sounds like you want her back because you need...somebody.  Your self esteem issues are about what you feel about yourself, not what you are when you're with someone. It's probably a good thing you didn't get back together.  Like you said...you were tired of the relationship, that  most likely wouldn't change.  You're the same 2 people, if it was stagnant then, it still would be.  Sometimes we really want to love the person we're with, but it  doesn't always happen.  I think that's what you might have experienced.  Maybe she and you could be good friends, but that's all.  In time your self esteem will improve and you'll be willing to take chances again.  Who's to say...Ms Right might be right around the corner.  Good luck.  Hope this helps....|`|AA10240683	Yes. Eventually you will become a stronger person for it.|`|vj2pWs9Maa	Post-breakup regret is normal.  That's when we start to romanticize about how "great" things were, when they really weren't.  What helps is writing down all the things you didn't like about her, how she treated you, and the relationship in general.  Read over them, and remember how unhappy you were in the relationship.  In time you will start to feel better about it, and start to build your confidence back up, and you won't feel so regretful.  Remember, things happen for a reason.   There is someone else out there for you.|`|HvhzBHc2aa	Yes, yes and yes.  Just pretend to yourself that she really, really wanted you back.  Was begging for you back.  You'd run the other way as fast as you could.|`|ISGDGh2laa	Yes.  Of course it's natural.    I imagine though, that while you're thinking about being together, there's a part of you that knows that you've made a good decision.    You've had plenty of good times and after 31/2 years, you've shared a lot of yourself with your girlfriend.    You don't have to leave that behind. You can appreciate the good times and now try to move on.|`|B2WyO7gjaa	it takes time...u'll get over her eventually|`|FqV9oOYAaa	This is quite normal, just because you broke up doesn't mean you still don't have feelings for that person. Only time will heal those feelings.|`|2tCbCvzXaa	it is natural its part of getting over someone. Try going out with your friends for drinks (if your old enough) or getting out of an environment that reminds you of her for a little while. When i broke up with my husband (while we were still dating) of 3 yrs that is what i did.
TRvAhhNKaa	Not unless they're crazy. Online jealously is so childish.|`|UbXp2K26aa	what? no lol. That's a lil crazy. I'd lose interest if a guy was jealous of me online. Someone I'd never even met?|`|uVH046Fjaa	They love it. You are a hottie.|`|G40fzdzcaa	No|`|ij9N9r5waa	One mans Opinion:  I Absolutely cannot deal with an Obsessive girlfriend I have other people in my life, They may not be as Important to me as you are but they do eventually come to the top of my priority list.  My girlfriend simply cannot stay on top all the time no matter how much I enjoy her company.  I have to make time for other things and other people. that's just the way it is.  Girls who seem to think they must be first or you hate them, are just crazy cant deal with need to go away girls.
VxC09hX5aa	No because i don't want to feel or live with a loaded gun pointed at my head with the hammer pulled back and the safety off that's exactly what you are playing with here.|`|AA10377289	is it really from blood transfusion..... hmmmmmm... interesting...|`|8794c8652f13a8a7695eba70cafff4a3aa	"in sickness and in health"......those aren't just words....|`|4POGapREaa	I would.  It's no different than having cancer.  I love him & I'm spending the rest of my life with him . . . in sickness or in health.|`|u7f0QB37aa	Yes but no sex so if you can be celibate until she dies which now days can be many years go for it you can't help who you love..  You still have your hand you know.|`|qXCSWQpdaa	I would.    Love in not only blind, but it is also blinding.|`|AA11969451	Yes I would.     I know many people that have HIV that are living full lives. (including physical intimacy while their partner remains negative)|`|afkygHMgaa	No. The reason is that blood transfusions are tested for the virus ahead of time so I would know he was lieing. Otherwise, I would stay with him.|`|XTBlOf9baa	Personally... I would not. I do not think I could ever feel comfortable being intimate with a man I knew to be infected with HIV. I am a nurse, so I know the statistics, I value my life, and I would be afraid of getting infected. Condoms are not 100% effective against HIV. Beyond that, I want a family someday. I would never be able to have a family with a man with HIV, unless we adopted, used a sperm donor, or used chemically washed sperm from him for IVF, due to the fear of passing on HIV to our children. Maybe that makes me shallow or a bad person, but I want what I want. I want to be able to live a comfortable, safe, long, happy healthy life with me and my partner and raise children. I couldn't realistically have any of that with a man with HIV. The sex life would be non existent for fear of getting infected, I would constantly have to be checked for HIV, and heaven forbid a condom would break, I'd get infected, and I'd get pregnant, and risk giving birth to an infected child. It's not a life that I personally would be willing to sign up for.|`|AA12280291	OBVIOUS GUY SaYS: NO!|`|uI4Dspi4aa	Whats the point of answering a hypothetical question?|`|AA11119892	yeah. but dude, i'd sue the mess out of that hospital. we'd be filthy rich.

But it's a plus.|`|HYnBeyJsaa	With me being a guy I think that these are the five top things girls look for:    1) Honesty: They want somebody they can trust, not someone that they feel will cheat around on them under there nose.    2) Respect: No relationship will get far if there is no respect being given, so that's definitely a high point that girls look for.    3) Humor: No girl wants an all-out serious dead-beat like Bill Gates or Donald Trump. They want someone that can bring some humor in there life when they are sad.    4) Time: Do you think any girl would want a guy that has no time for them? Of course not.    5) Height: It's obvious a guy does not care of the girl is shorter than him, but let's face it...if the guy is around 5'4 and the girl is about 6'0 then there's going to be problems.|`|qWL2aUxGaa	Personality  Looks  Height (to some girls)  Body Type  Attitude|`|BxCerdxlaa	kind, sweet, caring, nice smile, great personality
iPNOVR6Gaa	You're married.  Stop acting like you still have a decision left to make.  You married your husband - start acting like it!|`|LVlS4y7Caa	You made your choice when you had the children...Be the mother they can be proud of and finish the job...sit down and have a heart to heart with your husband about your relationship...it does sound as if you love one another.  So this other guy may be a "soul mate" (hate to tell you this, there can be more than one in a life time...)  You owe it to yourself and your family to stick together until those kids are old enough to understand life a bit better than they do right now...you're riding on a hunch when what you have is FOR SURE...a husband who loves you it sounds and children who love and need you.      If you're bored, take a class or get a part time job, if you're in need of destressing, try exercise, walking, curves, anything and keep doing it.  You've too much time on your hands it sounds...and romanticizing about what could have been is not healthy or productive.      Sincerely,    Grace|`|GpMRWESUaa	Kinda have a similar situation. It sucks but in time you'll have to make a decision to get rid of one of the guys. Do what makes you the happiest but don't forget about reality.|`|S9p8E8hBaa	Listen, you really need to realize that it is really not this other guy you love. You and your husband are having difficult times and you are fixating on another relationship, which is perfectly normal. You need to work it out with your husband and stay away from him. Take it from me. I recently left my boyfriend of 6 years to go back with my high school sweetheart. God, it took me 3 months to realize that I had made a huge mistake and I was in love with the feeling that I had for him when we were in high school. Not the person he was now. Seriously, everyone else will say stay with your husband because of the kids, I will say that is NOt a reason to stay together. However, with that said if you do not want your husband then leave him and spend sometime by yourself for awhile. If you want to date this other guy then, then do it. (My boyfriend does not want me back either).. Consequence of my action. I haved learned a lot from my mistake, I hope you can learn from mine too.|`|AA12107138	Do you think you dont have any flaws ha? You are so lucky to have a husband like that, wasnt he "the one" one day. This is normal, getting bored, do you think that you not gonna get bored with this guy, and wait a minute, you are like a little girl, you are talking about someone who dymped you so many years ago, and you are still not over it, what if he does it again, dont be retarded and ruin your life, just suck it up, and cut off contact with the other guy, did you hear me, cut off contact, dont be tempted.

Admit that you are wrong and be willing to do whatever she wants you to (if she wants you to move out than you should, etc). You should not be having sex with your wife AT ALL because you could infect her with an STD (unless your stupid, hookers sleep with a lot of people and you can get an STD such as herpes even if you're using a condom). I wouldn't be surprised if she divorces you. I rarely tell people that they should divorce but even according to the Bible, she has every right to do so. It sounds like you have no respect or commitment to your family and maybe even a sexual addiction. You are taking the first step in the right direction by telling her what's been going on.|`|UNZuciedaa	i can't really say if it's bad unless i know how much you're paying|`|kJ4g1vujaa	Depends on the reason.

Please disregard my answer!|`|Kr09aQJkaa	When I first read your question I thought it said I PRAY for sex....    Get yourself checked for std's and tell your wife. It is not fair for her to be having unprotected sex with you thinking the relationship is monogamous.     Tell her today!|`|NWH3MnE9aa	It is natural: Men have been doing it for tens of thousands of years. Who you have sex with is your business and no one elses. I would suggest two things: That you remain discreet and that you wrap it. Other than that, continue having awesome sex!|`|LVlS4y7Caa	Methinks this is a joke, and probably on you...for a guy to do this, well, he'd have to be a bonafide fool...lower than the lowest and of course, let's not talk about betrayal and disease...get the picture junior?      Grace|`|52092e43afb48f25c3b2832d7f29ae10aa	Ew..    Tell her to go get tested for the funk.    Isn't being married technically "paying for sex".    Geeezzz|`|S6FLJ64Qaa	You are gambling at the Craps Table of Life.  If you get caught and you will eventually, you probably have lots to lose.  The deck is stacked against you.  Here's a list of possibilities:    a)  you never get caught but spend thousands of dollars  b)  you get caught by your wife, you lose her and your kids  c)  you get caught by the police, you lose your dignity, your money, freedom, wife and kids  d)  you get caught by her pimp/manager in some disagreement, you lose your dignity, your money, possibly your life/health, wife and kids  e)  you catch a disease for which there is a cure, you lose your wife, self-respect, dignity (yes, the office staff at your doctor's do discuss you), your money, and kids  f)  you catch a disease for which there is no cure, you lose you wife, self-respect, dignity, your money and kids    Seems like a lot to gamble on something, that you can accomplish by watching 10-15 minutes of internet porn for free.    If you confess, then you get to pick between options b or d.|`|HjMbOgvqaa	Depends are you being responsible using a condom ,if not go and say honey i have been a dog slept with hookers so you need an hiv, hepatitis and mpv test.Because i have exposed you to all kinds of illnesses because my dick took over for my brain.But if your not sleeping with your wife and have no respect for her just keep doing what your doing and keep your mouth shut ,because you have 4 kids and she probably knows any ways because women know when their men are dogs sometimes we just choose to ignore it.|`|BhlGe0A8aa	How disgusting are you.!  I hope you do not sleep with your wife as well.You may give her an STD.  If you want to stay married I suggest you do not tell her and give up you filthy habit right away!  Isn't it amazing that all the thumbs down are given by men.LOL|`|q595MhH8aa	That is ABSOLUTELY horrible!   If you are not happy "intimately" with your wife, then maybe the two of you should seek counseling!|`|zOtiAN3xaa	Thats really not good!!! get a STD test.. if you pass, dont tell her.. just go down on her for like a half an hour and f*** the s*** out of her!!|`|GcsUwIAaaa	your a dumb ***|`|JFr7fCiXaa	of course its wrong, when you get married you commit the rest of your life to that person and you have broken the scared vowels that you took, you need to give it up NOW, properly tell her and then spend a long time making it up|`|AA11969451	While I do not condone adultery I will say that using a prostitute is better than having an affair and falling in love. I hope you have enough respect for your wife to use a condom when you are intimate with these enterprising women.     If you feel guilty you need to knock it off. Why do you want to tell? If it is only to clear your conscious...bad form.  You made a lousy decision and your guilt is the repercussion for your actions.|`|vmKO4lcBaa	its men like you that put the ideas into the heads of the writers for soap operas  basically  what do you value more?   Your family?  or  Your sexual satisfaction?  because you cant have both.    By the way, has anyone else noticed that nearly all the men have said 'Don't tell her' and the women have said 'Tell her'? really tells you something doesn't it...|`|87471ef53ee669c8c4e5b9ba179ec9d7aa	just tell her that after 4 kids she's gone a bit slack downstairs .......|`|60a3bbdca78e74fb19db426e27b9a087aa	You are offensively gross.    I can't even think of words.|`|AA10240683	Very bad indeed! Honor your commitment or get divorced and enjoy those prostitutes as much as you want.|`|e5f4c192231c92a0d059825b151f7553aa	Tell her - here is all my money - i have been cheating on you bigtime.  I will divorce you and send you all my money for the next 25 years.|`|uI4Dspi4aa	That you are a dirty scumbag?|`|MYbRICxqaa	You have problems you need to deal with. How can you not think that sleeping with someone else is not a problem. I hope your wife will get over your betrayal and you should tell her. Because you are not happy and that is not fair to those four beautiful children you have. Do you actually think they don't know something is not right?|`|g7wxHGjeaa	you are a piece of sh*t, my fiance admitted that he had sex with a prostitute once when he was young, this was years before we had even met he had broken up with his long time girl friend, he did this once when he was single and young.(he has no stds thankfully) He was single and had had no children, he had no one to hurt. How can you do this to your wife! and your children! you are disgusting! nothing else you can do better tell her  what a  piece of **** you are!|`|dcb024b5e2b5c65f694bdddd3199db68aa	"Hey Trickie,  You know I'm married with 4 kids.  Any chance i can get a discount?"|`|SHARt1k3aa	No, don't tell her!  I mean, yes.. it's very bad.  However, something is lacking in your relationship other wise you wouldn't be going else where.  I don't condone the behavior, but there is no emotional attachment, you are only doing it to please yourself.  I have mixed feelings about it because I would kill my husband, but on the other hand, a man does have desires women just don't have.  Keep it on the under for now, that is if you truely love your wife.  If you don't, then divorce her.|`|uFbytsw5aa	YES THAT'S BAD! GET A DIVORCE BECAUSE YOU ARE CHEATING ON YOUR WIFE!|`|HWnhBCXiaa	It is bad because A.) It's cheating with people who have a higher than average STD rate and you risk ruining your wife's health as well as your own.     B.) It's cheating and a horrible thing to do to someone.     C.) It's using family money to screw around. Selfish.     D.) You should tell her, and she should leave you, because you're not ready for a serious relationship.     E.) And you should go to a doctor.|`|MvxkNQg7aa	Why are you buying sex??  Does your wife not "do it" for you??  Please, you're in an adult relationship with a family, if you are bored, fix it!!  Toys, movies, places, costumes, role play, spontinaety(sorry for spelling), I hope your wife doesn't mind disease or a broken heart too much!!  LOVE YOUR WIFE|`|adfZkgRVaa	Thats VERY BAD.  remember children are involved.  tell  her the truth|`|Vew65vTWaa	GET A ******* GRIP....WHAT HAS YOUR WIFE DONE TO YOU TO DESERVE SUCH A **** HUSBAND?? && PROSTITUES??? YOUR FILTHY!! YOU SHOULD HAVE TALKED TO YOUR WIFE IF U HAD A DOWNHILL SEX LIFE. JUST TO THINK THAT YOU HAVE NO RESPECT FOR THE MOTHER OF YOUR KIDS YOU SHOULD BE SO ASHAMED.|`|B2WyO7gjaa	very, very,very, BAD! its called cheating! get a divorce! u ever think about STDs???|`|mHpc7NUdaa	tell her and get a divorce, it's the best thing scum like you can do for your families.|`|33bfd87a9333cc0bb06bc41c47f43f98aa	I think it bad and selfish. if you do not love your wife then get a divorce or separation. you're lying to your wife and kids which is also wrong. If you need counselling, find somewhere to get help now before you catch some horrible disease or lose your conscience if you haven't already done so.|`|Cp4ef6f8aa	well if its somthing that excites you. maybe u should get her involved.  but it thats not kind of option u can just open up to her about and ur hiding it from her then u obviously u know its bad and there was no reason to ask. if u can talk to her about it and move forward(and stop paying for sex) great. other wise do her a favor (since u've been only doing favors for your self) and leave her.|`|Ki1gWTzzaa	yes you should! it is pitafull dude! you need help|`|XD5WfExHaa	No, I bet you wife is like the typical fat @$$ cokehead American wife who is always "too tired" after she gets you to te point where you can't leave without giving up half. It's her fault!|`|4B93B5H9aa	Troll|`|9jG8spP1aa	Tell her. She deserves to know what kind of person you are! She needs to runs as fast as she can to the nearest clinic. You're a moron.|`|12Aifvf4aa	Yes it is bad, you are cheating on your wife AND using the family income to do it!!!  It is up to you whether or not you tell her. ask yourself, why do you need this, is it an addiction?  You need help.
YqoxcTN9aa	it is bad & could ruin friendships|`|13f8355359652cfde88b26bd8b3d6c6caa	I'm no expert, but having sex with "just friends" will most likely accomplish nothing but confusion.|`|8U8JJHPKaa	with friends its never good because if you have a bad break up you may ruin your friendship

aIEkNM0Paa	If your friend is making you break up with your boyfriend because of her issues then im telling you she is not a good friend.. I would never make my friends between these choices.. love u n.k. ;**|`|tyLM7VcAaa	wait three days. if the fight is still going nuts, then try to see why they're fighting. if it's something serious, you should consider breaking up. if it's silly, then you should tell them both that it's silly and to get over it.|`|cIROBuszaa	She's being a bad friend to ask you to break up with your boyfriend.   BUT it depends what they were fighting about. If he was dissing her in anyway, talk to him about it. Give him another chance.   And tell yout best friend that too, that you're willing to give him a last chance to try to make things worse, and if something else happens, then you'll break up wit him.     Boys come and go, unless they're your true love.   But your best friend, will be there for you as long as you return the same. =]
X7Vv0zPcaa	Trust me on this, Ashley is just jealous of u. my one friend used to post mean things about me online. Believe it or not, she was older than me. now I moved on. How 2 get over it: talk 2 a real friend or an adult. i told my mom, and she helped me through everything. I also relyed on some friends. Eventully, what happened will seem like history
0X9x5YrOaa	go to an amusement park. play video games.|`|0XvImpdFaa	go to the mall|`|s4FEJiNHaa	museum|`|a9qrXBBsaa	putt putt golfing? what does the girl like? do a scavenger hunt? go to a bouncy place?|`|QCdpBqhHaa	Where do you live? go to Disneyland or a theme park...an arcade...go bowling, go to the bat cages, go karts, pplay minature golf,...|`|7S0ore8Caa	Do something that you move around a lot and don't have to whisper to talk like bowling.|`|7BRJhrABaa	take her to the beach|`|eydwwJjDaa	Go paint your own pottery.   That's always fun. You guys can be creative, and make fun of each others "art work".   It always turns out great.|`|cUyxNNDGaa	A walk in the park to go get ice cream or some thing|`|OJJWNuDdaa	bowling and put put golf are my favirote. take her out to eat also. or find out what she likes to do with out asking her! that woudl be awesome!!!! yay!|`|cuE5zgwoaa	The beach is great fun!  Pick up some takeout food and sit on the sand and chat. It's always good to have talking dates when you first start - so, as tempting as a movie sounds, try to avoid it.|`|29ddeea7f871392bf7b17a12fc77a694aa	a movie at home then go out to a nice place and turn the radio up in your car, turn the head lights on and dance infront of the car..... after that just lay in the grass and talk, seriously if you talk to her and then take her home and just relax and flirt and dont have sex, be intimite with her without the sex you will be everything to her|`|AA10275738	If this is your first date you should keep it simple like a coke at the malt shop. First dates are just to get to know each other so don't go too far out of your way to try to empress her. lol|`|Pe7pXCbwaa	hmmm go out and have a picnic in nice weather, or if the weather is windy, then stay inside and play a game? dont be all dramatic with what u wanna do, just go somewhere to have fun, ice skating, rollerskating, etc have fun!|`|bSN0v4cEaa	talk a lot just hang out with them. that what i did its cool. take it slow. dont worry|`|wVZc9k9faa	haha! dinner and movies is definitely fun, but not creative at all... malls are great. just hangin out, learning each others' likes and dislikes, inviting them to casual church get-togethers, ice cream parlors are fun, so are pools, arcades, Christmas light trails at night, oh, and skating rinks.... a lot of these'd be even more fun if you went with several couples all together. :) good luck!!!
0Nfr3leOaa	yeah i think he would ask for ur number if him or maybe even a friend of his likes you hope that helps|`|QSodlfMraa	nah really, this guy took my number and he never call me, but when he did that 1 time we did it for about 2 minutes. his wack ***.|`|e28P8gWraa	Well it means he wanted your phone number enough to ask. Usually it means he likes you. Why didnt you just give him your e-mail or myspace?|`|3lssqacfaa	nah not necesarily. unless the only girls cell phone numbers in a dudes cell phone is all the girls he's ever liked. i have 233 contacts, and 103 of them are girls. in order to get there numbers i had to obv ask for it.|`|peckUVpzaa	Yeah but you should have given your home phone number lol..|`|BYdXXt4Oaa	Well, if he was shy in asking you, then yes, he likes you.  But if he wasn't shy, then he was asking for a friend.    If he does like you, then he will give you HIS number.|`|wj1OLn1paa	Perhaps
6egxGam6aa	I saw (and answered) your question about the peanuts on international flights. I must have gotten gypped, because I never got peanuts on the international flights I took. :\|`|VZPtCkweaa	ha.ha.ha. you're halarius.
W4CkDj47aa	she wants you even more interested she doesn't check her phone a lot|`|idmz2tvraa	maybe she's just busy and doesn't check her phone constantly.   if she said she likes you then you're fine.|`|aEDB2IvIaa	its because she doesnt want to seem like she is sitting by the phone waiting for you to txt her. its all part of her plan.
S9U2FtZdaa	if your with a friend, you should be able to tell that friend what you really think.  talk with them about your opinions and they may feel the same way and not know how to do anything about it or they might not feel the same way, but when its someone else's kids, you really have no control over the parenting aspect.|`|wJ1v0cX0aa	no, don't be. It's your friend's problem and they should be embarassed.|`|x24ERLPSaa	You have the right to feel the way you do; get yourself another friend and you'll feel more comfortable.|`|v1QIWugFaa	u should not say ur embarresed u can think that all u wont just dont say it|`|vJphK7cwaa	i don't think it's bad. i have two kids and i would not expect my friends to go places with me if my kids were bad. are these kids younger? what is bad about them? bad manners? don't listen? yell and scream? i could see how those things could be embarrassing.|`|nz2T73NPaa	Yes, you don't sound like a very good  friend.
ygGr1nX7aa	A bad person wouldn't care.    However, it might be best to get your mind off hurting by trying to get her to calm down so you can make sure she's alright.  I'm not sure what brought on that outburst, but it's probably got a lot more to do with her than it does with you.|`|rwodna0waa	I don't know what "s/hed" is, but if you don't do it anymore, don't start again. You're not a bad person, per say...but it was pretty selfish not to come tell them goodbye. What if they die on the way home and you never told them good-bye?? Don't hit your sister...|`|h0oceAwAaa	yeahh honestly thats bad...  and s/hed?|`|7tibLPi2aa	Bad people don't care when they do something wrong.
ToYmTw8gaa	ok deff send the photos in and if you get accepted then u will have a big arguing point for ur mom on moving. u can say stuff like."if i dont take this opportunity now, i may never get it back an i dont want to spend my entire life wondering what could have been" or something like that lol..best of luck! email if u want! :)|`|38fe66cc26fd24d41aff94bf6ba97574aa	Send your photos.  2hrs is not all that far away.|`|DcVoq5Tuaa	Send the photos and don't talk about moving until you know for sure. If you are accepted, I'm sure your mom will help you make what ever is schedule. Moving doesn't have to be the only option.
aSjdL4heaa	The human body is designed for the two sexes to fit together just right.  Relax.|`|7b1f8172d4a9ac10c23b5f3870728bb8aa	dont worry it will go in fine :)    and people are going to be rude no matter what kind of question you post.|`|TgU9P6pdaa	Take the tampon out prior to sex.|`|jAqVoGlmaa	jus have him lube up|`|wWzO9xARaa	Nope, no problem. The first time may be painful for you, but the placement of the body parts line up perfectly.|`|7BkbvD7Zaa	No.|`|AA10743159	Adam and Eve, had no problems, finding a way, and I'm sure you won't either. Men and women, have been having sex for Millenium, and when your time comes, it will happen for you too. It's not rocket science.|`|i4qaYAOaaa	well its most of the time hard for a virgin to get it in the first time but it will fit, may not be comfortable the first few times but it will get better.|`|AWoH1oN0aa	i dont see why it wouldnt ...unless u have a really gifted guy... just dont try to have sex while its in|`|cuE5zgwoaa	It's different for everyone and tampons hurt a little the first couple of times. The vagina stretches the more you use them and it becomes easier. As for sex, it may be a similar situation. If you're a little uncomfortable with the tampons, chances are it will be the same thing with a penis.   Don't worry that it's not going to fit. The more you stress about it the harder it is. Like the instructions say on tampons - relax the muscles and it will be less uncomfortable.|`|AA11955868	tampons are dry, moisture absorbing sticks. They are difficult because of those reasons.    When you have sex, you will, hopefully, be turned on, which will produce a lubricant that will make penis insertion much easier. It will fit, depending on your size (and your partners) it may feel different but unless he's literally hung like a horse, it won't be a problem.|`|Wf5ZUD3Uaa	ignore all these retards that say no yes girl if  you are using tampons they are still smaller than a penis it will have trouble and hurt less but it will still have trouble a hurt this is the best answer girl.|`|rOiIBmd1aa	It'll be fine your body prepares for sex naturally, just don't have sex with a tampon in - ouch!|`|Mr9McLtiaa	uncomfortable but over in less then 5 min anyway so ned to worry|`|KpQBsXbRaa	no not at all.|`|bf3914759431a2f8053994ebecf71128aa	nope its all good. perfect location if u ask me.|`|6dGB58pzaa	No Nothing Really happens|`|G1ntv3dDaa	I dont think it will be a problem. sometimes with tampons you cant find a comfortable spot for it. its normal and it will be normal when you have sex to not find the right spot at first' just keep trying!'(hahaha)|`|0HXI5tv2aa	well ur gunna be wet so it will slide in a lot easier    its ok 2 have questions =)|`|Q0DfC12xaa	chill nothings going to happen|`|foC5y3Eoaa	if you leave your tampon in for long amonts of time you can get toxic shock syndrome....at night try a pad.......and yes it will go in with no prob.|`|jWAzxHGvaa	You will be fine : ) At first it is not pleasant but once it starts to loosen up a bit, you will feel much better. The obgyn also has something called dialators that you can use to start the loosining up process yourself so it isn't as painful the first time and you can enjoy it more.|`|AsICkz9naa	The vagina is sloped at an angle, that's why your tampon doesn't always just slide in. It's a little up and then backwards. Sex is different though, as the penis will just slide in, when you are of course ready. You need to be sufficiently lubricated and you won't have a problem. Hope this helps|`|RMJ5OtO1aa	Will take a few times before it becomes easy.  Make sure you indulge in foreplay so that you are wet enough so it doesn't hurt...|`|Xj4bTobUaa	I wouldn't worry about it.  Sometimes girls can tighten up and may make sex abit uncomfortable the first few times but just so long as you relax and feel comfortable then the wont be a problem|`|dJAVfLHraa	The penis will go in fine. Tampons are way different and you control where it goes. A penis will just slide right in if ur lubricated enough. There should be no problem at all =) it might hurt the first few times but it will go away.    Good luck!
gxczXgvXaa	Just ignore her in every possible way.  If you have any of her clothes or something, give them back and walk away. Don't even look at her.     She'll go away sooner than later.|`|ymK1hg2Raa	whenever she's ignoring you when she's around the "popular" girls, say to her, "oh, by the way. your mom told me to tell you to make sure you use the vagisil cream that she stuck in your purse. you need to go put it on right now!"     then when she confronts you about it say, "you act like i'm nobody when i'm around them. but when you're not around them, you act like we're best friends. why are you such a bipolar *****? i don't want to be your friend anymore you fat, ugly, good for nothing skank!"     okay, maybe tone that down a little bit, if you want to. but that's what i would do.    good luck! also, tell her how bad she is at volleyball, that will make her mad.|`|4BS71Qvsaa	well if you really don't like her then just tell her how you feel but don't put her down. have you ever thought that she acts likes shes  so glamorous and perfect BECAUSE she may be heavyset and unattractive?she may have self esteem issues and if you don't think you 'd be a nice person to her then just leave her alone
3ee8101ef611dcb2fe20c82dfe728d6caa	in the short term I would see if I could spend the night at a friends house instead if I was you... This really isn't a children's services or a 911 issue, unless they are physically threatening to harm you if you don't go to their house.  In the long term, do you have a trusted family member you can talk to that may be able to talk to your mom, your dad, or both. Or that will at least be with you so you can talk to them. Even the school counselor may be able to help. They need to be told that you shouldn't be in the middle, that you love them both, and at one time they must have loved each other or you wouldn't be here, so they need to remember that when dealing with you...|`|38fe66cc26fd24d41aff94bf6ba97574aa	Stay where you want to, or whoever you stayed with last weekend, stay with the other one this weekend.|`|AYr6unifaa	do you have any other family that you can get in touch with? I would try that first. Also...are you in danger? If not,just tell them who youd rather stay with. I went through this also when I was younger and i was always worried about hurting their feelings, but that doesnt matter...its not your fault things went bad with them. JUst tell them where youd rather stay. BUT if you are in danger...then I would definalty call for help...and if thats 911..SO BE IT!

A year before I think I got her this really sweet clock for her wall that matched her room perfectly cause her clock was a piece. lol.      Try thinking about past conversations and stuff with her and try to think of something that would suit her that she would like!! :)      Hope I helped and I hope you find something awesome! :p :)
8di0rKm1aa	just keep hinting that you like her and hope for the best|`|PtqlQ5Anaa	you really never get out of that but you never know she may like you too.

Most relationships start out as friendships... u just gotta be sweet to her... Valentines is coming up- perfect chance for you to go above and beyond.|`|PF2FBKBDaa	pay girl money, then make boom boom, then she like you more|`|gO9tl2uhaa	It's really hard ESPECIALLY if you're good friends. And you're all to blame! =P (should've asked her sooner - like the first week).    I'm guessing (and hoping) you're asking this question because you asked her out and she rejected you. If you haven't, ask her !    Anyway, the best advice I can give you is take a step back. Start dating other girls. Don't stop talking to her, but you know, get busy with other girl (dating or hanging out).    When you give her less time (I'm guessing you spend a lot of time with her...), she MIGHT (sometime it doesn't work) realize how much she needs you. PLUS, it shows that you aren't a clingy wuss. If you want to be happy with a girl, you'll find yourself one.|`|5ajPMlrqaa	Be sure she is single before you try to pursue. If she has a boyfriend or husband, than no dice my friend, no dice.    If she is single,ok... you need to be sure you're not coming across as a push-over or a wimp. Some guys are too available, all the time. If their crush calls at midnight when they're asleep, they would get up to go to her house and hang out. Don't be that guy! Have a life, be interesting, so you'll be worth being interested in.    With that said, don't play any kind of games. If you've been friends for a long time, the idea of being more might scare her, so a subtle approach might work best. Try flirting. Prolonged eye contact, smiling, a wink here or there (if you don't think that's cheesy), a pat on her back, tell her she looks beautiful, you get the picture? Nothing too sexual but just enough to make her wonder if you want more than friendship.    After a little of that, you could escalate it - simply ask her out for a proper dinner and a movie. Or tell her that you often wonder what it would like to be more than her friend and ask her if she has ever had those thoughts.|`|VZPtCkweaa	you left out one important detail. . .    do you want to be MORE than friends, or LESS than friends?|`|7BRJhrABaa	hmmm damn thats hard...ahh lets see.. try flirting with her, see what she does. if she flirts back thats a plus if not try talking sweet to her. since you kno her for a few months it should be easy cause you know her good enough to do that. if she dont show any signs of attraction, forget it man dont mess up a friendship if you dont want to loose both.|`|KW77oNWraa	idk hold hands and if you ever go out just the two of you before you leave try and sneak a kiss in maybe =)|`|tDeYQV6raa	kiss her.|`|rOiIBmd1aa	Get out as in get out all together, never see her again cut off all contact or get out of the friendship bit and more of a relationship? Specify!
uA3yUdCzaa	don't even say anything because they aren't worth it... that happened to me in the beginning of july and i wanted to do exactly what you want to do... but trust me, ignore them and move on|`|WTASRbzAaa	there just being plain jerks. sometimes friends do that. just give them the silent treatment, &they'll come crawling baack2 yoou:) it workeed4 me|`|WW66AkgJaa	okay well you are definitely right they are being extremely immature. tell them this "i'm sorry you don't want to be friends with me anymore but i am not sorry that we aren't friends anymore because if being friends with you guys means that i can't have other friends then i'm glad we aren't friends anymore. and please stop staring at me when i walk past you because it's very immature, grow up. also if you continue to post things about me over the internet i will contact the police and they will have you remove that crap. thanks, bye."    you can edit what i said or you don't have to say it at all but i hate when people are rude to others so it gets me fired up.|`|tkRJwNJraa	woww thats harsh...  just ignore them. they do it cuz they know it bothers you, if you just smile and act like it doesnt bother you they wont get pleasure for doing it and eventually give up|`|cRMl6VHYaa	well ur right they do need to get over it. go up to them and say think wat u want we dont have to hate on each other but tht doesnt mean we cant be nice to each other. it happened to my fren. good luck and god bless|`|6282cae4780c315a4a883ed371640c65aa	Hello & God bless: If their is one thing I learn in the ways of God is that we can not please or make anyone do anything they do not want. We can not go around trying to make or say anything they do not want or like. We end up crazy in some kind of mental hospital. These days teens as well as grow ups are totally different in every word and action. If we believe in God than only him we give answers too. I as a Christan  I pray and talk to my God your god our god everyday the things that have happened to me are blessings that God   can only give. We all have friends we lose some and gain others. Live your life as a person that you are if your friends do not accept you for who you are inside & out than just pray to god for them and live your life the best way you can. never put pressure on yourself that you can not deal with. The best peaceful place to go to is  church even if your not a church person at less pray. do not write to your friends unless they do.no emails etc....... only do something if you think your life is in danger other wise leave things alone.  God bless be well be safe sister rose|`|jPv8AXAPaa	just say, "whatever, i'm not going to stoop to your level"|`|0L5qFnIJaa	tell them exactly how you feel. be upfront. its the only way to go. honesty is respected.
u70TaWI5aa	You need to go for it, at least take a risk. You do not want to end up in a state of what if? i would have done it and regret it later. Live your life and ask her out. She is 20 meaning she is a woman not a little teenager she can decide if she wants to go out with you or not. But you will not find out unless you try. That age gap is not bad, don't be scared if she does not feel the same oh well. At least you know instead of looking back and wondering.|`|UO7hD2Plaa	this is a hard one but if you like her then give it a go you never kno what could happen.. you wouldn't be the first person to date some one much younger then you x
hlq3Eo0haa	it means he cares for you,but does not love you. if he is your  bf move on.|`|LsBS5bOCaa	It means that he moved on.....and so should you.|`|iXSoX6Rnaa	its the same as saying I love you but I'm not in love with you. His feelings are changing for you honey and maybe it's time to talk to him about that.|`|7BRJhrABaa	i think what he means is that love is a strong word and he doesnt want you to get carried away once he says it again so he prefers to show his love in other words, for that reason. but then again it might be that he doesnt love you like he used to but he cares for you alot.|`|KW77oNWraa	maybe he realized that maybe love is to big of a word if he really cares about you then he's telling you that he cares what you think about him too so i dont think i would ever tell a girlfriend i loved her unless i was really sure it would hurt for a long time if i lost her|`|SyUeecsBaa	then consider the relationship OVER . pick up the pieces and move on . it's juss that the realtionship is slowly dyinq so juss end it now before it qets even more painful .|`|A7ovwP94aa	It sounds as though he has fallen out of love with you but cares for you as a friend.|`|uXeGsxSVaa	You are heading for the breakup town at a full speed|`|Zn8q98SBaa	he doesnt feel the same, anymore.|`|PdIRHRZgaa	ummm you screwed up, and he just cares 4 you know.|`|cUyxNNDGaa	he might just be a little confused all of a sudden  dont worry about it :)|`|Q0DfC12xaa	he doesn't love you anymore|`|2PTzgYuvaa	i'm sorry he doesn't feel the same way...move on|`|AA11532563	Mabe u did something wrong or he doesnt feel the passion anymore..or mabe he just isnt ready for love.and hes being honast with yuh.u guys should tlk|`|t58tRjwbaa	he doesn't love you anymore.|`|m88ELjmPaa	that he doesnt want you anymore
71VRvldJaa	It depends whether he takes meal breaks and time to sleep at night!    Seriously!!  What kind of question is that?  It might take a day, it might take a year....it depends on where he's looking, how hard he's looking or even IF he's looking.  He might be focusing on his career right now and not looking at all!    If you know this person just ask him if he's met someone.  Wouldn't that make more sense than asking an unanswerable question on here?  If you're wanting to know because this man is an Ex.....quit worrying about it!  He's your Ex!  It shouldn't matter to you, nor is it any of your business if he's met someone!
wf4TUcsmaa	21 years......my whole life.|`|QSodlfMraa	i was single for for 3 years, after being with this guy for 3 years, but now we are back together for about 1 year now, so 6 months is not that long.|`|XJqFqAnsaa	my whole life|`|1fB2UdRHaa	I have been single for about six years so six months is a very short amount of time in comparison.
CEqYjcBeaa	Well first off there is no ring involved yet, so it isnt that serious yet. He could have been testing the water to see if you felt the same way that he does. Love can come fast and be true, just make sure that is what is truly is before actually getting married. Now as for talking wedding plans, if you are engaged it doesnt mean that you have to sit down and plan everything out. If he does actually propose to you, that just means that he is willing to make that level of commitment to you, wether it gets finalized a month down the road or 3 years down the road. It simply says this is what I want, and when we are both ready we will follow through. You are just simply agreeing to make that same level of commitment. I wouldnt worry about it to much unless he goes all crazy on you. If you can see yourself marrying this guy, then why worry about it. Just let him know that you are willing to make the commitment, but you still want to get to know one another more before you actually tie the knot.|`|4810f1ddde8104d49db91aaae4bcd680aa	God gives us certain instructions on marriage.  None of them include "You must date for a minimum of "X"."  Time frame has nothing to do with the question of whether or not the two of you should marry.  My wife and I NEVER dated prior to engagement, and married about three weeks later.  We just completed eleven great years and often counsel other couples.    He says to not be unequally yoked.  Seems like both of you already did that once.  Having been married before, and divorced (both of you) tells both of you something about the other.      And it should cause BOTH of you to be very cautious about the other.    That does not mean that you cannot marry each other this weekend - but it does mean to make sure of what you're doing.    You cannot control or change him.  He cannot control or change you.  You only have control over who YOU are.  That is all you get to work with.    Recipe to marry:  1 - Run as hard as you can for Christ.  Reach a level of spiritual maturity - no dating.  2 - Once you reach your "pace" of running for Christ, look to the left and to the right.  Of the members of the opposite sex who are at the same pace (not you passing them, or them passing you) you may look for people to "court".  You are equally yoked with those people.  3 - Marry anybody in that group that pleases you and that you please and you'll do fine.    Courting is not dating - in dating, the guy shines his shoes, holds the door for you, shaves and wears cologne... and the girl lies just as much about who she is.  What a silly way to "get to know someone".  Courting is spending time with someone in real conversation about important things in life.  LIKE RELIGION AND POLITICS.    Satan hates for people to have any conversations about anything important, so he instituted a "polite rule" that nobody should ever discuss religion or politics - and never get to know anybody.    You need to know the person before you get married - for him to know you at that time, you need to first know yourself - that goes to step  1 of the marriage recipe.    God Bless you - and don't forget the other instruction God gives husbands and wives.  That is WAY important.....|`|MHwn4Tlzaa	Tell him that it's too soon for you but you want to keep dating.  That is very reasonable.|`|tRMgbldcaa	It is way too soon.  I'm speaking from a 19 year old stand point but I have been dating my girlfriend for over 3 years.  Tell him that you feel the same and that you eventually want to get married but its not the time right now and to maybe hold off for at least a few months.    Good luck!
wWzO9xARaa	maybe. I wouldn't count on that though.
aHWGRNbDaa	It is not a bad thing to be smiled at! If you're not shy go up and talk to them! If you're at the library don't make a move, if they're with a book ask them about it or if you know about it tell them your knowledge, they proboly think you're attractive. I always smile at gorgious guys. Good luck and stay positive!|`|RBGc1Hytaa	Girls stare at guys when they think they're hot. If girls are staring at you they think your attractive, hot, good looking, cute, whatever. I would take it as a compliment!|`|utQC6dhjaa	1) they notice that ur attractive  2) you smiling so there smiling back  3) shes a cashier and has to look at something when she's doing her job  4) you have a nice car    so many possibilities|`|vstLWg0Uaa	do you have any gum on top of nose?|`|MYbRICxqaa	How can it be that you don't know when people are attracted to you? How many girlfriends have you had?|`|2c88J3M7aa	Your probably attractive =)|`|ZYTmiU62aa	There probably interested in you|`|eDhNa7MKaa	You have a mole, and it makes them wanna laugh|`|PNbBi2Vsaa	probably because they're all attracted to you.    and usually if you make eye contact with someone and don't smile then its a little awkward. :)|`|XdqvvLaiaa	Your probably HOT!|`|AaWSU711aa	Maybe you had something on your face
y9CgveCGaa	Yes, I would.  They have been the best years of my life.  I would do some things differently of course.|`|rcut6bhoaa	ABSOLUTELY I would get married again.  Only problem now is I am facing divorce because of the mistakes "we" both made.  Unfortunately,  I am more of a forgiving guy and she is unable to forgive herself for the mistakes she has made.      Married almost 10 yrs.|`|IbJ2O0vpaa	First wife - good grief, I would love to go back and decline. Why? As our family therapist put it, she was a textbook case of borderline personality disorder.  I messed up many years of my life, my finances are destroyed for life, and my kids are so very screwed up. 18 years married. In my heart, I knew better before marriage.    Second wife: I'd get married again. In fact, we've had multiple ceremonies. Why? I love her a lot. It makes me very happy just to see her. She's the kindest human I've ever met. She's the smartest human I've ever met. She has an incredible sense of humor and is just so witty. She's artistic and adventurous. She's got the sexiest brain I've ever met and is the only woman I still felt this madly in love with for more than a few months. We're going on 4 years together.|`|EENUWAP7aa	If I could go back in time I would change my last lottery numbers I played and hit it right this time and I would have plenty of money to do the things I want to and probably have no time for marriage.|`|AA11946996	5 yrs. I would definitely get Married and even go through all the love and heartache all over again. Well I have my 2 sons and the experience of the Marriage is second to none. It's this experience that has taught me the feeling behind unconditional love.|`|AaZCmTGUaa	Mine probably wouldn't. I am a piece of work. And I am proud of it.|`|dcb024b5e2b5c65f694bdddd3199db68aa	Married almost 15 years.  After everything we've been through I would not marry her.|`|l7Qvbw9maa	NO way in HELL I would get married again!!!!!|`|98NiEivhaa	married 12 years, seperated 2 months    some wives age like fine wines....  mine aged like milk
8xPWd35maa	My boyfriend didn't know that I had already had sex with someone else.  Maybe your guy doesn't know that.   This shows that he really cares about you and he probably doesn't want you to think that having sex is all he wants.   If you start something he would probably comply.  If you don't want to start it, then maybe you should wait just a little longer.  Good luck.|`|SRZza0cWaa	i was in the same situa honey and o got bored of making the 1st move so i chucked him.. he didnt make me feel wanted like i was attractive..     He never makes the first move to kiss me or anything..is like he wants me to come to him.. i always go up to him and then starts kissing him.. i always initiate things..when i ask him to kiss me e just gives me a peck on the lips and i say is that it and then he tells me to kiss him and then i move in to kiss him proper with tongues and he gets really into and then we start from there.. but he never makes the 1st move..when i pull up against him then he grabs me tight and holds on to my waist and then looks into my eyes like he wants to kiss me.. but he never kiss me first unless i move into kiss him..but he looks at me all the time though in my eyes and sometimes i get so nervous lol we were together for 2months before any physical contact..which i made the move to kiss him..!!    my Best friend reckons guys that do this sees a lot of girls so he went really boyther cos he knows if youy dnt give him sex the other one would.. also if he doesnt nbotice you when you dress up for him.. then leave him asap cos hes not worth it.. am glad am through with that bastard....    hope this helps.. oh yeah and dont make the move for a while and see what he does...xxxxx|`|tDeYQV6raa	just start fooling around and see where it leads.|`|xccRugjHaa	Maybe he doesn't want to offend you by trying to initiate sex.  Most guys will appreciate a woman initiating it.
3m8JgWj1aa	if he did the breakup his feelings may have been dwindling before hand but there are usually some lingering feelings left, it all depends on what the reasoning was|`|e7f7b9508f28f00c8e34cd692587ca8caa	some people seem to
HYnBeyJsaa	Of course you can, there's plenty of things you can do. You can go out to clubs and the movies a lot or perhaps you can do a more "less crazy" thing and find yourself a nice woman to be with. Nothing makes a man feel more better than having a woman that can make him feel happy for the rest of his life.|`|FKwwByvEaa	What a sad thought that the best years of your life would end at 18 and you have another 60 to go.  The best year of your life is the year you decide to make it the best.  DO the things you want to do when you want to.  There is no need to try to make up for missed things.  Create new opportunities to do new fun things now.    I had a great time   in high school  in college  after marriage  after kids  in my career  last week  lots of great times and more to come|`|byWl2fw0aa	It's a way of thinking.  In high school...you're normally not worried about work. You get to see your friends on a daily basis...and you get to go home without no more stress than 'did you get your homework done'.    After high school...you're expected to take charge of your own responsibilities. A lot of people get a very demanding job, get into debt and have a cranky spouse who increases the stress at home.    You can make life better after school by working hard in school and getting a good education so you can get a good paying job so that you can reduce many of the stresses of 'not enough money'.|`|ct9GUupBaa	chyaa party like theres no tomorrow when ur 21|`|G64uE64Vaa	yes.  do u have a gf?|`|0qm2raXBaa	I think that everything happens for a reason.  I'm sorry to hear that you feel like you missed out of a lot of things, and maybe you have.  But sometimes that's okay.  There are many times where people have developmental gaps, where they don't experience what they are supposed to experience at a certain time and age, but that's okay.  It will affect you, but not in the long run.  Try to live life for what it is from now on and cherish the new memories and experiences you're going to create.  Life is too short, they say.  Enjoy it while it lasts.  Good luck.|`|utQC6dhjaa	thats a lie they tell you because high schools lame    believe me college is WAY better|`|idmz2tvraa	omg no, high school sucks haha|`|nz2T73NPaa	High schools ****. You can make any years the best of your life.|`|GzvLG6x5aa	People who think that high school was the best years of their life tend to be those who feel they're  missing out on something in adulthood.   My high shool years were far from my best - not that they were awful, but as you get older you get the hang of life better. It gets better.|`|kC6iAMDJaa	i dropped out but later got my GED and I think no you can't get those days back. I missed out on so much like dances and being a teen. If you can go back to school then i say go back if not then your like me, missed out on a lot, not the best years of our lives.|`|S9U2FtZdaa	i wouldnt say the best, but maybe the young, dumb, wild and carefree stage of your life, if you feel like your missing out on something, find out what you want to do or experience and go do it, dont sit back and have what ifs in your life, life can be very short, and until you live the way you want to , your going to cut yourself short in the living life to the fullest thing...you deserve to be happy.|`|rOiIBmd1aa	i HATED high school, well i hate high school|`|Vp1Wzu07aa	Even when high school is good it is not the best time in your life. Wait until you have more control...about 28|`|o8E9wsPCaa	No of couse not  high school is not all that fun  trust me  just make all you can of your life now  and have as much fun now|`|6c7QswANaa	Some things are good.  Most are bad. Just tonight I got a three-way calling attack and lost two immature friends... I knew it had been coming, but...     In a way though, high school is a good experience (including the bad) because the world isn't pretty, and these occurrences help you to prepare for life and help you to be quick on your toes and get used to rudeness. It is epidemic...
vj2pWs9Maa	Stop making excuses for this low-life creep.      Please leave!    Do you want to spend the rest of your life walking on eggshells?  Do you want to go without the things you NEED and WANT because this jerk controls your entire life?  Do you want your kids to grow up and marry someone just like him and be miserable for the rest of their lives, because they don't know any different?  It might seem to you they don't know what your husband does to you, but trust me they do.  Kids are a lot smarter and perceptive than we give them credit for.    This sad excuse for a man will never change.  He may change as in get worse, but he will never improve and actually treat you good.  It's up to you if you want to live as his miserable wife for the rest of your life.    Happiness is out there for you - and believe me it isn't with this man.    It makes me really sad.  You ask "What can I do to make him happy?" or "What can I do to make him love me more?".  There is NOTHING you can do.  Don't you realise he is one of those people that you can NEVER please, no matter what you do?      This guy is a piece of s**t.  You need to get some self respect and get out of this toxic situation ASAP.    ***Can you answer me this:  What has he done, or what does he do to make YOU happy?***      EDIT:  I want you to know - you aren't doing anything wrong (apart from still hanging around).  You haven't done anything to deserve this treatment.  I think what's happened is because of your abuse as a child (which most victims blame themselves for), you've probably involuntarily fallen for people that were like the abuser, and because your confidence is shot to hell and you don't know any different, you accept it as the norm.  Sure, people in bad relationships have "good days" every now and then.  But when the bad outweighs the good you have to start to wonder "Is this REALLY worth it?".    There is help for you out there.  It makes me sad that you're exisiting only for this man who doesn't deserve you, and your happiness and sanity is at stake.  I understand that while you may love him, he doesn't love you in the same way back.  You deserve to be really, really happy everyday of your life, not just sometimes.  And I understand that your circumstances are a bit difficult with your disability, but there IS help out there.  You should never stay in a situation that causes you so much grief and anxiety.  Never.|`|7b1f8172d4a9ac10c23b5f3870728bb8aa	ok i didnt read all of that    but he hits you its abuse    it doesnt matter if he only hits you sometimes.  if someone kills people but not very often, he/she is still a murder.    since he looses his temper even if you didnt do anything, you will never be safe, i suggest calling the cops on him the next time he hits you.    good luck!|`|498JdszFaa	Curious, he is NOT a good man, NOT a good husband and NOT a good father. You are being co-dependant, he is an ABUSER. That's the bottom line.    You are living in the mist while you are under his influence. You can't see what's happening obviously. He is projecting all his wrong behaviour on you and you buy it.     Think about what example you are giving your kids. Weather boys or girls: it is OK to abuse your spouse or: it is OK to let your man abuse you. What age are they?    You need serious help dear, please go talk to someone. If you can't break free on you own: any women shelter would open its door wide for you and your kids. You don't need to be black and blue physically. You are battered on the inside.|`|AA10339039	He sounds like a manipulative, selfish, foul-tempered jerk.  He has no right to control your entire life.

It is your choice if you wish to continue in an abusive relationship.    When he accuses you of lying, cheating, stealing, remember, people who accuse others of things are usually guilty of those things themselves.|`|BhlGe0A8aa	You are in a very difficult situation-you are ill and he knows he can play this to his full advantage.  Stop defending this man and realise just what he is up to. He is playing mind games with you,making you believe that everything is your fault.Well it isn't!  You may not be the brightest button in the tin,but NO person deserves to be physically abused . It is just not done period!  You sound like such a lovely person,I really feel as if I want to come to your home and sort your husband out.!  Please try to have a life of your own if you can-have you any friends?  I can't believe that this man is treating such a lovely lady this way.  Please feel free to E-Mail me at any time,just for a chat if you would like.  God Bless.|`|DAU9lIO7aa	Hi Princess!    I might have wrong but I sense that you should take a break. Request your husband money enough so you can survive on a two weeks long holiday on your own.    During those week you try to find out how you feel about everything. - Do you love your husband because of him or is it because of your children? and other question you try to find a response too.    If he refuse to give anything... Well, then it might be time to wonder if you should go different ways directly.|`|EJtIb3fCaa	I don't know if you'll believe me, but I will like to have the time not only to read your post completely (I can't sorry) but to talk and help at least by listening to you.  For what I did read, all I can say is you both need urgent help, go to counseling. God bless you.|`|TJiGs8S4aa	Sweetie, this man is completely abusive.  In every respect.  Have you ever seen the movie, "Gaslight"?  This is just the same combination of psychological abuse, coupled with physical abuse.  This man is trying to make you think you are crazy.  He is lying, abusive, and controlling.  You do NOT deserve to be yelled at and hit - there is NO excuse for a man hitting a woman.  And you never will make him happy, because that is part of how he controls you - and blames you.      Please speak to someone about a divorce.  You need help.|`|2keIEMFUaa	Why are taking all this abuse?  You need to sit down and have a straight hard one on one talk with him let know just how you feel, you really need to let him know how you feel and let him know that you have had enough and if things don't change then you want out of the marriage and then, Get out from under him already|`|5NKa5Y8laa	Im sorry but this sounds like your marriage is doomed.  He is uncaring and disrespectful to you.  If he is not prepared to be honest and face the problems and put in the effort to make changes, then there is no chance you will have a happy marriage with him.  Please attend counselling for yourself, or if you are unable to get out, find a counsellor who will come to you.  Work on your own self esteem, find the courage and strength to leave him.|`|fd800537157025b01ab2fd3e2bfd7b53aa	My dear, I'm sorry to hear that you are so confused. It sounds like you are unhappy, but at the same time you endorse his unloving behaviour by making excuses for him. This is the very essence of abusive relationship - the abused side starts to believe she deserves to be treated poorly. You say he's not supposed to be caring 24/7. Howcome he's not supposed to? What, he's supposed to be caring for 2 hours and then it's OK to turn into a heartless monster for an hour? You say he doesn't hit you very often. But he does hit you! It sounds like you have very low standards for what a loving relationship should be. You say he is a good and a wonderful father. How so?|`|x1VLBHOJaa	I read all of your question and I read all of your last question too, I am going to answer you again. You probably find the thought of leaving your husband horrific, but just think about what life would be like without all this crap you are dealing with at the moment. You've put up with it for 16 years from him, its time to call it quits once and for all! There are people out there who can help, organisations that have been set up for people just like you. Domestic abuse and violence goes on all the time and it is allowed to carry on because of people being afraid to walk away. It is a scary thing to do but trust me you will think its the best thing you ever did once you break free. DON'T LET ANY MAN MAKE YOU FEEL LIKE CRAP! That is the philosophy I have always stuck by. If a man ever makes me feel sad/stressed/depressed/hopeless then I'm better off alone.|`|KWL3Mwonaa	I think you know the answer to that question.|`|4B93B5H9aa	Tried but failed on that short thing.|`|YaB5bpv7aa	He is an abuser and you dont ahve to put up with it adn no u dont deserve to be hit or treated like a dog get out.|`|tzNqAWhdaa	GET OUT while you still can. I was in abusive relationship for 10 yrs and I should have left sooner, he said all the right things after he lost his temper, or hit me, or accuse of  me of cheating, and he NEVER changed even though he said he would change, it just got worse.  The nite that I told him to leave he put his hands around my throat and tried choking me to death if it had not been for a very close friend that was there outside, she got a bad feeling after about 10 minutes and sent her husband in to check on us, if he had not come in when he did I would be dead.  Your life is not worth you feeling wothless and you don't deserve to be treated like that trust me it is better without them and that kind of "love".  You should not have to ask for money either.  You need to get yourself together and get the hell out while you still have your life.|`|niSRQw53aa	He's emotionally, physically and verbally abusive.  As well as highly controlling.  My ex husband also gave me an 'allowance' although I worked for a living.  My check went into the bank account and I was allowed $100 per month to spend on myself and he was allowed $200 per month since he made more money.  I was considered less than him because he made more money.  I eventually divorced him because I could not handle being beat up anymore and no one should EVER be controlled.      You deserve so much better.  I would look at counseling or a separation.  But to tell you the truth, the hitting and the other abuses only get worse.  My ex twice a year calls me up to tell me what a POS mother and low life I am.  Divorcing him only kept him from hitting me.  He still emotionally/verbally abuses me and forces me to pay HIM food money in July when he has the girls or he keeps them from me.  That is his way of controlling me.  He despises paying child support so he punishes me for that.    By the way, I forgot to mention that my ex broke my face, kicked me numerous times in the abdomen (I have adhesions so this could have led to more surgeries), and pulled my hair hard enough to hurt my scalp.  And now for the kicker.... he beat me this bad because I threw a t-shirt on the floor to prove a point.  I divorced him after this.  I have children and I know from experience that seeing your mom beat up is highly detrimental.|`|bRBu0EYtaa	bloody hell woman what are you doing ring up social services they can get you a carer kick the toe rag out on his **** and never look back stop making excuses for him get some backbone and kick him out when he first laid a finger on you you should of kicked him out then     ring social services and get your life back on track you will find it hard at first but in time you will realise its the best thing you ever did     the social services website    http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/Hl1/Help/Soc...    all the best|`|M97iu7jQaa	I'll keep it short and simple.......LEAVE HIM!!

He needs help and so do you.   You have to love and respect yourself first, do not look to him for that, he is a mess.  If you want this marriage to work, you have to get the balance right, equal shares with everything including respect. You will have to be strong and do some work on yourself before you try to tackle the partnership.  My husband was abused as a child and I accepted years of abuse because I felt sorry for him, until he went too far, a fling with his PA, lying to me and doing his mothers dirty work by laying into me when she told him lies about .  You have choices, put up with the c**p, leave, get counselling for yourself and then face your husband to encourage him to see what he is doing is unacceptable. I know from experience this is not easy, I was there two years ago. My advise take small steps and start today, for your own sake
TJKij7gvaa	I am from San Francisco, and people are very progressive within the city. I think you will definitely feel comfortable dating outside of your race there.|`|eb215043bc75160cbf1c1380fe74d936aa	I'm hispanic and I don't care if you are blue. but I will tell you that everything will depend on the person.|`|5vT3UDYaaa	Thats a hard one, but I've seen more interacial dating in smaller cities. Like I live in Eugene Oregon and theres tons of mixed couples, I'm one of them. So I dunno, smaller cities with lower crime rates, and probably more northern to north western cities.|`|UO7hD2Plaa	i'm not sure were you are going to school but you should be able to date whoever you like doesn't matter if you black pink or purple x|`|A7ovwP94aa	Anywhere is ok for inter-racial relationships it is 2009 not 1889.|`|BjtqWNt8aa	In the past, 99.9999% of Black women would not consider dating a white guy. So getting a date with a white guy may require special effort on your behalf, not because they are bigots or racists, but  because most guys have very fragile ego's and will be afraid to ask you out for fear of being rejected.    If you are looking at the situation from that perspective, it really does not matter where you choose to live. Extending the extra effort that you may have to extend in order to let a white guy know that you are really interested in DATING and getting to know him...and not just messing with him, and/or not just interested in sex...will be the difficult part.     This is only my opinion...I have had zero experience. I had a crush on a cute black girl back when I was 17 years of age. She was also 17 and liked me too. Because she lived directly across the street from me, I felt comfortable knocking on her door one day after school to find out if she would come outside and sit on her front porch to visit. Her DADDY answered the door and that was the end of that!!...that was back in 1972. As for dating non-white guys that are not black either, I don't know what they think. Maybe the same as white guys.|`|Fc4WF8Pqaa	your right it isn't the 1950's so why did you say "I hear that it is okay for interracial dating" I'm pretty sure you can date who ever you want.|`|6mIYShv9aa	Don't blame you for wanting to date out of your race.|`|TMi1GhSHaa	why are you making it like a big deal lol?if your attractive it doesnt matter what race you are, guys will flawk to you.. Just be nice.     I think its a matter of diversity, chances are if the city is diverse then people would be more accustom to seeing people date other people of different races.. I use to live in NYC and you see all kinds of people dating with eachother.. Newyork is very diverse same with California.    When i went to canada last year i saw TONS of interracial dating going on..|`|e28P8gWraa	I would say go somewhere out of state. Like UT or something.

BTEUx4a4aa	you seem like a really good boyfriend so whatever you do dont think that her behavior is because of you it definitely isntt.  but so nervous you dont understand were much more emotional and overanalyze stuff. ask her to just come over to your house (since she lives NEXT DOORR ! omgg) for a movie sit on the couch and talk to her make her feel more comfortable and tell her that you feel the same way your both facing the same issue and say that your her boyfriend and she shouldnt feel uncomfortable with you tell her that youll take it slow and u can just start with a peck and thats its no big deal  trust me this will work outtt  prettysoon youll be making out alll tha time and wont even remember this issue  dont worry!!|`|bYYj151Zaa	you need to get her alone and just talk to her. it isnt going to work if you guys dont have communication. and maybe she just wants you to make the first move?
AA10743159	Ahh, we all love mysteries don't we, whether it's a murder mystery on TV or a novel, they sell by the billions.   And here you have one, so to speak, dropped into your lap. How exciting for you.   As you have already surmised, he is basically shy and reserved, and probably lacking in social skills with girls. It's always easier for we guys, to be friends with other guys, no pressure. But with girls, we feel that pressure, and if he hasn't talked to many girls,he's not going to be good at it.  If he's sitting alone at lunch, ask if you can join him. Don't ask to many questions of him, Just talk, even if you only get one word responses. After a while, he'll become more at ease with you,and most likely to open up more.  So don't push, just be there, let him get to know you better, you girls are way ahead of we men, at socializing. It's like taming a wild horse or animal, you can't do it on one day, they have to learn to trust you first, and that takes time. So be patient,and enjoy unraveling the mystery of him.|`|Xf3ixVWTaa	TOO LONG, TOO LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO...|`|O5G83gcQaa	umm you should keep trying to talk to him. ask him questions and answer the question to. ask about school and assignments, eventually he will warm up to you.|`|i4qaYAOaaa	i would ask him if he would like to hang out sometime and talk to him over lunch or walking to class something like that. just give him time and don't give up he probably likes you, from what he knows about you so far.|`|KW77oNWraa	the best way to get shy guys to talk are questions xD lol we'll start opening up like books when you get us going we just have to get to know you first =p which is probably why he is interested in your hand being raised. perhaps you should raise your hand and let the teacher know your opinions it could be what he is waiting for? to be to force full and be very kind dont act to preppy or "cool"     even so talk to one of his guy friends maybe and you could tell them to tell him that you asked about him which could stir up some thoughts to a girl asking about him =)|`|FUQ0sJNaaa	Wat, you really expect me to read that long a letter?

af644b7256e7bf5a53974bb99a32d482aa	I'm thinking she has feelings for the other guy, and has not broken it off. I would kick her out of the home until she either gets herself together and commits to working it out, or decides to divorce.     I'm sorry, but her mind sounds halfway made up already. Prepare for the worst.|`|c2dfad4dc1f663f9f98d8667a84e7f6daa	You can't fix this marriage on your own, especially if she's cheating. She's not working on it so it's going to be 100% you. Are you willing to take her (very occasional) sloppy seconds? You deserve a relationship that is reciprocal and your children deserve to see how a NORMAL relationship is. Good luck.|`|AXbdNdPzaa	You confronted her.  What did she say?  Ask her if she would like you to get the rings re sized.  Do something romantic for her.  If she had an affair, are you forgiving her?  Is she showing remorse?  Before a loving relationship can be reestablished, she must be remorseful, and you must be willing to forgive her.|`|qXCSWQpdaa	Stop dealing with rumors and get some facts!    Hire a private investigator to get the information you need.|`|AA12187979	Be a man, take your kids and leave.|`|xlm20MZ1aa	She is acting defensive because she is probably guilty and is trying to find an excuse to leave you. I woulndt fall for the acting. Why would you want to be with someone who is cheating on you anyway?|`|2PTzgYuvaa	go to counseling, find out if she wants to salvage the marriage|`|FqV9oOYAaa	Sounds like she is having somewhat of a personal crisis. Do you help around the house, play with the kids? Remember, you were only 19 when you started out together, maybe she thinks she missed something during those years and is hoping to find it. Try counseling.***Mildred sent me***|`|G0pDFMSPaa	Sounds like a normal marriage to me.|`|XD5WfExHaa	Of course she's cheating. She has you to the point whee you can't lav her without giving up half. I bet you this guy whoever it is has more money than you!    edit: Don't do something romantic for her. Typical woman dumb@$$ answer!|`|2tCbCvzXaa	The first thing i would try to do is get her the right size wedding ring if she still refuses to wear it. I would ask her to go to marriage counseling, if she refuses that the next step is divorce. Its going to be hard but i would try the marriage counseling first and the wedding ring idea.|`|4B93B5H9aa	My advice is to only ask one question at a time.  I'll answer your third one. Yes.|`|AA12202402	If the wearing a wedding ring to you is important...(Bands don't stop folks from messing around) Then get them sized so she can wear them. Problem 1 solved...  Problem 2 you confronted her and she says of course NOT!  Well ask he why the need to hang at bars without you? If they is an answer which there will be watch her face the second after the question is asked....I mean the second after you finish that question....If she breaks eye contact she feels guilty about something...Now doesn't mean she is having a affair but she need not be in bars for some reason|`|K7fVSLSKaa	It's time you put an end to the suspicions...check out this website and find out how to learn the truth once and for all about whether or  not your wife is cheating.  I tried it and it works...really    http://www.productsupplycenter.com/web18...
69bp1IMfaa	You should show that you like him.
TDiRmT9daa	Don't preach or demand. Just offer love and support. It really is the best approach.    Ask her if she has given any thought to quitting and let her talk first about how she feels, what she thinks. Encourage her to talk about her fears - withdrawal, weight gain...whatever they are. Take them seriously. Let her know that you are there to support her in every way you can. Tell her that you love her and treasure her health.    You know it isn't easy and you know it has to be her choice. And don't worry about the kids so much. Nonsmokers raise children who smoke and smokers raise children who don't. I raised 4 as a smoker and not one of them smokes. They all tried it as kids will do but I took the time and patience to explain that it is a prison they don't want to live in. They believed me, God bless them!|`|SU8z0TUoaa	I agree with ProudMom - don't marry a smoker and then complain about her smoking. Just tell her what you saw, and leave it at that.|`|1YdeUn1Caa	If you wanted a spouse that didn't smoke, why didn't you marry one? You shouldn't marry a smoker, then all of a sudden demand that she change for you. The world don't operate that way.|`|wscyjkPAaa	First, YOU'RE HER HUSBAND and it is in your place to say something. Voice your opinion, I'm sure she'll listen to you or at least think about what you tell her.  Second, i think you answered your own question.  Tell her you want her around and tell her that your toddler is emulating her by pretending to smoke.  I wouldn't worry about the second part though, I used to pretend I smoked when I was a child because I thought it looked tough but I never really took on smoking as an adult.

But remember we always never get what we want.   Focus more on what you need.|`|bYYj151Zaa	i had the same situation. but then we just talked one night and i told him how i felt and dont like pour it onto him like "i love you so much" just be like "i felt a lil spark between us, and i was wondering if u felt it too" and he says no he says no but if he says yes you will be happy.|`|ct9GUupBaa	Just play it like he isnt out of your league those kind of guys like confident girls

uXeGsxSVaa	I think you answered your own question - you don't argue when you see each other. It is the long distance thing that is killing you. All I can suggest is let go of previous arguments, and also try not to bring up any topics that might result in a squabble.  Good Luck|`|42IzT0Viaa	When was the last time you two were together, in the same place?  I know that when I was in a long distance relationship it was the physical distance that was the hardest part, and did spark a couple fights simply because we couldn't read facial expressions.  If its still going to be awhile before you two can get together, you might want to invest in a webcam.      Playing off of the above, you or your partner might be having some unconscious fear about the stability of the relationship.  If this is the case, you need to reassure each other that neither is going anywhere.      It could be that now the arguing is your only sense of any passion as well...you might want to explore that angle, especially if you are fighting over absolutely nothing.    It could be that the relationship has simply run its course.   Or your partner may be finding it difficult to ignore some of the other possibilities in his area, and thus harbors some underlying resentment.  In which case you need to be honest with each other and just split up in a friendly fashion.|`|odhBeflZaa	Usually you have overcome many obstacles like this ...Yu have to knoe the person yu love when he is mad and sad and the moodiest ways yu can think of. Yu can give up,but there will be radical changes he can make in her life and do stupid stuff she will regret same as you,but if yu care hang on there. Sex may be something big to,yu dont have to do that to show love but yu can do other stuff like..flirting gifts and just any lovable nickname yu can come up with n say it....If yu put alot of effort to go this far dont break up..  Just like a new car..yu like it so much and yu give it a little mileage and yu seem to think there is problems...yu will get out of the car and leave....but remeber...What can happen to that beuatiful car When yu leave it anywhere>
RMJ5OtO1aa	Sounds to me like he would get quite defensive and not want to back down. Instead of apologising, he qould probably have a row with you and then tell all his friends about how you were horrible to him, over a pint or two.  I'd wait if I were you, and then see if he changes his ways, if he doesn't then you can approach him. Face-to-face remember, NO texting! =D|`|3YfYWpAsaa	no, that will make him feel INSECURE and he will act the same way to try to get u back... u will end up both ignoring each other more and more, and the relationship will be ruined.  guys dont respond to that- only girls do! guys dont like challenges- once we have our girl we like it to be chill. f*ck stress and f*ck petty games!    the REASON he will act that way back is this: cool guys know how girls work- as in, they want what they cant have.  thats how he probly got u in the first place. so he thinks that if he does that again, it will work to make u come back to him.      if he was a nerdy guy who happens to be clingy, he would immediately ask u to hang out more, and it would work; but if he has senior friends then obviously hes not a loser and hes cool, so he'll play "the game" to try to get u back. your best bet is honesty and telling him straight up that you wanna see him more!    heres what you need to do: next time u guys are on the fone at night, at the beginning of the convo, ask him if he wants to hang out in person.  ALSO, tell him that you MISS HIM and want him to hang out with you more.  tell him you love him but ur tired of him ignoring you, and tell him that his friends are important but you should be too.    he will understand and he'll start hangin with you more often.  AND that fone convo time can be better spent hanging in person, as well! you could arrange night meetings, instead of fone convos that are pointless|`|0iPZ78esaa	A lot of guys want girls where they have them. Witch is bad for the girls. A lot of guys dont know what they got till it's gone also. So maybe letting him know that you feel your drifting a part would smarten him up. If thats how you feel. Just be Honest with the guy but guys like the chase also..  If you tell him hes not putting in as much to the relationship as you want If he really loves you he'll smarten up.|`|jcaoWIrZaa	I would say to him that you think you should be together but don't say that say " I don't feel comfortable with another guy" and see his reaction. Or you could say " I miss hanging out with you, this break-up was a big  mistake" And hopefully that will work!  Hope I helped,  Catherine Maylor|`|gOI2Bgfjaa	want u more|`|eS9nPWqBaa	EGO - that is all|`|fPviDdmMaa	Play hard to get. That always works.|`|AA10531094	Idk, tell him and see what happens.

Stop having those 1-2 hour phone conversations with him, slightly cut off communication and make it aware to him that if he wants to see you he will have to set things up with you.    Good Luck|`|rzfwzbgvaa	well by the sound of it in my point of view saying that you are losing interest may set a spark that will help him notice that you are upset, but you would have to explain it first    you sound like a Lovely couple but it's better you tell him how you are feeling:)|`|2PTzgYuvaa	only God knows,  don't say anything to him just start doing your own things [cheerfully] and see what he does.|`|jem0fyhiaa	maybe yes maybe no???????????|`|239ccaefea72d0c42e2659af5c76748aaa	Wan't you less|`|PtqlQ5Anaa	dont be so available to him.|`|HbksK8szaa	it depends if he really loves you. if he does, it will scare him. if he really doesnt, then he might feel relieved.  if you really are losing interest, be honest and tell him. dont keep going along with him.|`|OtgLLpn5aa	I thought he was your ex?

After a couple of months, tell him you just wanna hang out more.|`|EzNbeSpUaa	Well, I can answer this question pretty accurately since it happened to my best friend. Where do I begin.. I think that it depends on how much he likes you and you like him and what YOU exactly want from this. I'm sure he needs his friends time too right now especially if he knows he might never see his senior friends again.. don't hold that out against him.     Only tell him your loosing interest if you feel like you really are. A relationship after all is based on trust and honesty and maybe being honest with him will help out the situation and things will get better. It can go either way. Good luck
AA11955868	maybe you would, maybe you wouldn't. there are several types of grants and loads of qualifications. I would research that. maybe speak with a bank about a load for education. Perhaps see if the training course offers payment plans itself. You could always save for a year and apply next year.    Good luck.|`|2PTzgYuvaa	maybe or a student loan, speak with the financial aid department they can help you|`|aoaqVMKAaa	Thanks for the   |---  |-----------2 Points--------|||"|""\__  |__________________|||_|___|)  !(@)'(@)""""**!(@)(@)****!(@)|`|wZk80BaGaa	may be difficult with the current credit situation|`|KpQBsXbRaa	Thanks for the  |---  |-----------2 Points--------|||"|""\__  |__________________|||_|___|)  !(@)'(@)""""**!(@)(@)****!(@)|`|AA10275738	You won't really know until you ask. lol

That would just prove that no one can do what I do all day AND deal with my ignorant husband.    I'm going to call them right freakin now.

They only pick the extremes on that show, like swapping people who are basically recluses with people who are social butterflies, people who don't care about grades or school or work, with people who over work, etc. It's what makes for the drama and the good television. I work, have fun, relax too, etc. Basically I'm normal, so I wouldn't really make for good swapping material. But it would be a fun experience, I think.|`|6fLxNyVpaa	no way|`|SiniSj1eaa	im addicted to that show..

IqeQB85maa	Tell the person who is cheating that what they are doing is wrong and the faithful friend should know what's going on, as it isn't fair and that if they don;t want to be in the relationship they should end it. Give them a chance to come clean/sort things out. If they don't you step in and tell your friend.  Honestly if you were in their position you would want to know.    Just be straight and if that ruins any of your friendships with them, it's their problem! It reveals how much your friendship means to them. This world is so messed up because people make their lives unnecessarily complicated by not being honest in the first place.    Even if they stop cheating, they need to deal with why they cheated in the first place. So either way in order for the issue to be dealt with s/he must come clean.    I hope it all goes well.  = ]  P.S. I was kind of in the same situation, I told the girl he was cheating but she still stayed with him. He cheated on her with one of my friends and the girl he cheated with knew her vaguely. Friendships weren't ruined, because he knew he was in the wrong.|`|mfiA5Hcwaa	Just be honest, your friend being cheated on deserves to know the truth. I know I'd want to know.|`|NVUngN45aa	M8? That's a motorway isnt it?
47af2fda89839c0ec02e273cff59d82daa	well, make sure they know that you still plan on getting college under your belt before the actual big day.  so make sure they see you filling out apps, and looking at financial add stuff, and all that...      im not a parent but i suppose how i felt would depend on the guy my daughter was dating.  if i saw their relationship was strong and that they were mature in any decisions they made together, and he got along well with the rest of the family, i wouldnt mind.  but if they were fighting all the time and they went out and spent money without thinking, yeah, id be a little mad, but i dont know what i could do about it, cause legally she could do whatever she wanted.      i suppose just wait till you have the ring on your finger and when she sees how happy you two truely are together, she might warm up to the idea a bit more|`|76nTvO4iaa	How soon are you planning to get married?|`|dH9IhDIFaa	You shouldn't get engaged.  People change as time moves on.  It is possible that you and your boyfriend will grow closer together, but once you get to college your life will change substantially.  You will have more freedom than you have before and that might drive you to make different choices.  I would recommend you wait until after college before locking in.|`|s6stLtvLaa	First off, how long have you been with this guy?  If you get engaged, think about setting a wedding date 2 years from now.  That way when you tell your parents you will show your mom you are thinking ahead and waiting to get some college in first.  My sister-in-law was engaged at 18.  She had been with her BF for 3 years.  her mom knows, I know, my husband knows and that is it.  They have set a date for 3 years from now, when he is ready to graduate college.  She has a great steady job now, but her mom has approved because the showed responsibility in the fact that THEY knew it was too early for them to get married.  But, they have made a commitment to each other that they will one day be married.      Good luck to you!|`|JRQihhhwaa	Im 18 and im engaged and getting married a month after i graduate (getting married in june 2009). Ive known my bf for months now by reputation but we've been talking since june and dating since september. Ive never been the kind of girl who went out and dated, i had certain things that the guy had to meet before i would consider dating him and the top 3 were:    1) he respected his parents  2) he respected me for who I was and didnt push me to be like the other girls my age  3) he was great with kids.    Those were only 3 things that a guy had to meet before i would even date him, which is probably why everyone was shocked when we started dating. He was a redneck high school dropout and i was the smart all As and Bs shy smart girl. He was a partier and I wasnt but we hit it off and we love each other even though people constantly try to break us up.    We got engaged on Nov. 22 when we went out for a party with my aunt and uncle to a bar a couple towns later to celebrate her having a healthy baby boy.     A couple days later we told my parents and they were pissed.  My parents raised me that sex b4 marriage was wrong but me and my fiance have been living together as long as we've bn together. and they couldnt understand at first that i loved him. so for like the first month of our relationship they would hardly talk to us. then they sat down and talked and he made my mom cry with what he had to say about why he wanted us to get married.     It may take them awhile to get used to the idea but they will warm up to it. My dad called me a week ago and appoligized for how he first reacted because he just wasnt ready for his baby to grow up. Thats probably how ur parents will feel but they will warm up trust me, mine did.|`|a3e11f9fab12e9c7b5ac773d2818a3d3aa	If you're going to wait to get married, why not put off getting engaged too?  Use the engagement not as a 'we're going to spend our lives together' announcement and more of a 'we're planning our wedding' announcement.  That's what my fiance and I did.  We'd been dating for 5 yrs before we got engaged. We started dating in high school and waited until we were out of college to start planning the wedding.  We got engaged last spring, when we were ready to start planning our wedding.  If you get engaged now and wait years to get married, what's the point of being engaged?|`|GzvLG6x5aa	There is no easy way to do it. There will be screaming and tantrums. BUT it may help to write it all down first. You could even turn it into a letter to her to show at some opportune moment.   That way she gets to read your point of view without the emotion that would inevitably be injected into it when discussing in person. And you get to think it through properly as well.  If she's got things that she'd like to say that aren't coming out right because she's too emotional or uptight, it could help for her to do the same thing too.|`|btNUf7rcaa	i wouldn't be upset, i would be disapointed that that's the way my daughter wants to go. I don't have a daughter, i have a sister, and even though i would feel happy for her if she were to get engaged when turns 18, i would still feel a little weird about it. I only want whats best for her, and i think she should go to college and learn to know herself before committing to someone. There is so much to learn still, even when you think you are a mature 18 year old.  I wouldn't oppose, but I would much rather have her live a little, have her grow out of her teenage years, live a year on her own, and then marry.  I wouldn't want to go from being a daughter to a wife with no transition time for me.|`|3qUA5V3Saa	You can't live your life to please your parents. I live in England so cultures are different to yours. We are classed as adults by the age of 18 and make our own decisions. Obviously you will want your parents approval but ultimately its your life and you have to make your own path and mistakes. If you and your boyfriend have been in a steady, long term relationship then whats stopping you?? Just because you get engaged does not mean that you have to get married straight away. I would suggest that you live together first though as you really get to know someone well before you make such a massive commitment and getting a good education is also important. If you can prove to your mother that you are committed to making something of your life other then just being a wife and mother, then i am sure she will approve. Good luck.|`|0056ba0f2ca4852a4f7b389766f314d4aa	How about instead of getting engaged, you get a promise ring? You are still a little young to be making a decision like this and as time goes on, you may find that circumstances change.     With a promise ring instead of a full blown engagement, your mother may not go ballistic and you and your bf have still made your intent to each other.|`|8794c8652f13a8a7695eba70cafff4a3aa	Dads are very protective of their Daughters....I would ask her Fathers permission...it would help things go over smoothly and it will show them you're polite and mature.....but when you do this, you cna expect him to ask you questions about how "you intend to take care of my daughter and support her" .....don't tell him what you think he wants to hear.....tell him what's in your heart.....just tell hime verything you told us...but deff. ask her Parents permission first....espc. since she's 18.
JERUmEFzaa	Just say this. Guys I need to tell you something... My dad`s a rockstar and if they don`t believe prove it! I did the same thing when I told them my dad was a famous car dealership owner |`|lkmOWkk4aa	Who is ur dad|`|AMiYgUU1aa	is your dad relly a rockstar. dont tell them...theres no need to tell them. but if you want to they might not believe you. try proving it|`|xxiX1qQgaa	Just say to them that you really need to talk to her and be honest and if they don't believe you prove it to them, by the way who is your dad? everything is gonna be okay, there's nothing to worry about.|`|RpfOKba8aa	You say hey girls, my dad is a rock star.  if they don't believe it, you prove it.

GzvLG6x5aa	Oh, how sweet, he's always been honest with you about how he's cheating on his girlfriend to be with you..   This guy is no great prize. If he splits with this girl and you get him, perhaps you do just need a really harsh lesson.|`|FKwwByvEaa	This was a  bad idea from the start.  What kind of boy are you trying to date that needs two girls to keep him happy or unhappy.  If he lies to her then he will lie to you.  Don't date him anymore just be friends and find a real guy to date|`|AA11510511	If you meant that much to him, he would bring himself to dump his girlfriend.    Why can't you find your own SINGLE guy??|`|98JZcrO6aa	hang on, why are you dating a guy who is already going out with someone?|`|BGIsuNMTaa	I know this isnt what you want to hear but think seriously about this. Dont be naive either, if he will do that to her, he can do that to you and how heartbroke would you be if he was saying that to another girl about you.   Wipe away your rose tinted glasses and find someone better and worthy of you, hes playing you both along and the more you stand for it the more he knows how much he can get away with it and what good is that if he does finish with her.|`|wJ1v0cX0aa	i think you should ask him to choose between you or her. If he sees her, it's because he gets something out of her, something you probably will not like to know and as long as you endure that situation, it will stay like that. Give him an ultimatum...|`|zon13nY2aa	How can you look at yourself in the mirror knowing you are breaking up a relationship? If he's unhappy it's not your job to sort it out, he needs to be a man and end it!    If he does end it and you 2 get together, I hope you're looking over your shoulder coz chances are he will do the same to you.    Once a cheater, always a cheater! If he really liked/cared for you he would wait until his relationship was over and start over with you.|`|sZZ90ZOyaa	Tell him he has too choose between you and her .

SHARt1k3aa	What "sole" custody means is you have the child at least 80% of the time.  "Joint" would mean 50/50.  So, the answer to your question is yes, you can have sole custody.  However, you'll still have to work out a holiday arrangement.|`|FqV9oOYAaa	Not being a lawyer, I believe you can get sole custody. I would let the court know about the support not being paid.  *** Mildred sent me***|`|GfYUvnudaa	Mildred sent me.Yes you can.you can keep sole custody and keep the visitation rights.|`|lJPKjVqIaa	No, no, no. Legal custody is either joint or sole. And physical custody is either joint or primary meaning most of the time she will stay with you, and this sounds like what you guys already have.|`|EroXBvDNaa	yes, you will just make all major decisions in her life, but he will have visitation on weekends and holidays
AA11955868	I wouldn't worry about the 'few other guys'. It shouldn't be your goal to beat everyone else. It should be your goal to find someone that you have a connection with and enjoy being around. It sounds like you don't even know if that's a possibility, I highly doubt 'everyday' something goes wrong.     Maybe you're just making excuses to avoid talking to her because you're shy? I don't know what suggestions you're really looking for on this site...talk to her. That's it, and you seemed to have figured that one out, albeit surprisingly. So I don't know what else to tell you?    You could ask her and some friends out to movies so you have more of a chance to speak with her in a casual setting without having to give her an ultimatum of 'do you want to go out with me or not'. Because if she just learned your name 3 weeks ago, and rarely speaks with you, the answer will most definitely be no.    Good luck.|`|CZ1nO9C9aa	That isn't an emergency.  Just talk to her.  If you don't find a way to talk to her, then it's never going to happen.  Take responsibility.  When you get to be about 16, decisions you make in life actually start to matter.|`|YbDf0uDHaa	find her on facebook|`|G64uE64Vaa	do u have a class wit her?|`|FUQ0sJNaaa	I cannot read your question.

HANG OUT with her one on one sometime. maybe play soccer or basketball if she likes that. go on a walk with her. be REALLY personal, meaning talk about meaningful things and show your full personality and sense of humor. look her in the eyes when she talks and smile. laugh with her. agree with her on a lot of her opinions the first time, and provide funny commentary. be yourself. but MAKE SURE you get that day ALONE with her sometime. that is very important. if you cant get her alone, it isnt meant to be. trust me on this one man, i was RIGHT where you were two years ago. have kept the same girl ever since.|`|JvY5KL22aa	get her number! easiest way!!!|`|AA12127714	don't force anything in your life....what will be will be no matter how much you try to control it.....|`|GA5izZqGaa	Ah who cares if the other guys talk to her. I'm sure other girls talk to you as well, but you wouldn't want that to stop her right? Just walk up to her and start a conversation about something swimming related, if you need to break the ice, just ask a question about school or whatever and it should get the ball rolling. Build up the friendship, and maybe drop a couple of hints, don't go to fast.    Good luck!|`|Tc1BO5kkaa	Be yourself around her!! eventually if she gets to know you enough she may give you a chance! take it slowly too. it helps if you build a friendship first.|`|bVsRXAapaa	first of all, u need to calm down. second of all, not to burst ur bubble, but if she only found out ur name 3 weeks ago and ur on the same swim team, u have no shot in hell with her. plus, an 11 grade girl WOULD NEVER date a younger guy. if i didn't know ur name until 3 weeks ago and u were a yr younger, i can tell u there'd be no chance i'd ever date u cuz i would've noticed u by now.|`|Xprsabo9aa	i say make the first move   ask her for her number|`|tGP809Mkaa	yay swimming(im a swimmer)!  and just play it cool. whenever she's alone try to talk to her and get her number.|`|XdqvvLaiaa	Talk to her, even if you have to interupt! :)|`|Rnaub4P6aa	go up to her say hey im ... and ask her about herself dont sound nerdy  and for now let her talk about what she wants to. good luck|`|WEWO0yv5aa	ask a freind to tell her that someone wants to talk to her in the library then when u see her looking for that person talk to her she should be alone.|`|aoaqVMKAaa	ok if shes as a boyfriend id back off thats trouble if not try saying hi ask 4 her number and try cassually bumping into her when you see her and talk a littl|`|5Rml1s7taa	Myspace?

3d6bc93187edd6634c43ac022cad74b1aa	gah I know how you feel. Tell your girl bff to accept that you are dating the guy and she'll have to try to get along with him because she cares for you. Tell her you'd do the same for her if it were vice versa.    Actually forget about it, listen to Amy. Usually, some of the best romances starts out with a boy and a girl hating each other. Sorry.|`|MSzjOOOjaa	they probably like each other...i was in the same pool now there all over each other..yuck|`|zQ0mUDBUaa	well you really shouldnt get in the middle. my best friend sarah had a bestfriend named derek and me and derek really didnt get along beace sarah would tell me the mean things about derek and then she would tell derek the mean things about me sooo we would fight. Over time we realized that she was starting crap on purpose sooo we both said to hell with her and now were married and have children lol.    But seriously though dont get caught up in the drama
o8NPR0PNaa	I'm with him!!  If you are both still working, that says a lot about you, and great for you!  Have a nice get-together at another place, not your own home.  Tell them that you are going to do the best thing you can for them, by not giving them anything.  You need to stress that you both still earn your own way, by working and expect every one of them to do the same too!   Also, that you have plans for the remaining money, sorry but they aren't included in those plans.    By now, that $3.7M has probably dropped to less than $2M, thanks to buying things for others, like houses, cars, and giving monthly stipends, not to mention Uncle Sam's portion.  You are both still young, but you should be setting that money aside, and making it grow, for your own children and your old age.    I would get ahold of someone I trusted, like Suze Orman, and ask her opinion on what should be doing with the remaining money.  I have heard her say things about not giving others money to bail them out, because then they keep getting into more debt and expecting others to give them more.      Close friends and immediate family is one thing, cousins and distant relations are another.  I have considered what I would do if came into millions, many times.  Immediate family and close friends have always been near the top of the list, along with being bill free and having a secure future for my daughters and myself.  Aunts, yes for couple close ones.      Cousins?  Only indirectly, if paid money so aunt with alzheimers could stay in the facility she is currently in, so cousins didn't have to transfer her due to lack of funds.    By the way, your brothers should be taking care of themselves, you shouldn't be.  You gave them extravagant gifts already.  I would tell them that I love them very much, and am going to let them earn their own way from now.  After all, you are only teaching them to be dependent on you.  If the homes are too much for them to afford, help them sell them and get smaller places they can afford.    Momma, that is up to you, but I would have bought her a smaller, more reasonable place and give her extra money to pay for necessities too.  Note, I didn't say $3500 a month with you paying all her bills!  The more you give, the more they will want.      You have convinced me, I won't be telling anyone if I win millions...    Best of luck!!  ~ Suzi :)|`|DcVoq5Tuaa	You are right, sounds like your cousin just wants a free handout. I agree with you, you can't support every member in the extended family but the immediate family is enough. I'm sure I wouldn't want to pay your taxes, the gov't is probably taken more than they should. She needs to get off her fat *** and start doing something to improve his situation but probably won't. I like your hubby's idea of having a family meeting and letting everyone know that you can't help all the people all the time, you can only help those that help themselves. If they don't like it tough. You maybe related by blood but doesn't mean you have to be their bank.|`|AA11098866	If I had a family member,such as yourself, that bought me a house...  Holy Crap!  I would be so grateful!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I can't believe the nerve of some people.  Why should they just expect a handout?  They should get off their butt and get an education if they want the nice things you have!  God knows there are plenty of grants and loans to help.|`|KukyXRjpaa	honestly, thats a common thing when it comes to people who marry someone who is rich or someone who inherited money. family will bug the **** out of you for your money until broke!!!!!! you have done enough, do not give them anymore. trust me, they have to get themselves out of their own crap!    last year, i had a lot of money, and i all i heard was "give me this and give me that"    i said **** it, NO MORE!!!!!!!!!!     so please ignore them, money is obviously the only thing they care about, if they cared enough about you then they would realize you are frustrated and flustered. but they dont see it, so **** em!
Lsa2LPrMaa	you sound really young  so i wouldn't even pay any attention to this guy because um hello he already likes someone else but he's flirting with you.. sounds like a player.  & if you really still want to date him or w/e i'd wait till he doesn't like anyone else at the moment.|`|xvCvd5xhaa	Well, it's obvious that the guy likes you, for one he stares at you, and secondly the girl keeps giving you dirty looks. When you get a chance to see him alone, walk up to him and ask him flat out, say, I don't want to sound to forward, but, I noticed that you keep looking at me, and your girlfriend has been giving me dirty looks. I don't even know you or your girlfriend for that matter, and I just wanted to know what was going on, cause I do like you, but I don't want to hang around or try and get you into trouble with your girlfriend, and then see what he says. It's better for him to hear it from you then for any fights to start breaking out or for him or his girlfriend to hear it from a mutual friend, you don't want that. Good luck, and I hope this helps.|`|7igxiGrAaa	Learn english? You may stand a better chance.|`|dcd11iUwaa	ask him to make a choice.  if hes interested in you he will be with you.

I suggest to not to mind him at all. There are still other boys out there much better than him and who would like to know you more as you and not just to flirt with you.|`|qc9B2rMGaa	the situation sounds complicated , sound to me like you need to talk to the girl, don't tell her you like him ( the guy)! just ask her why she is being funny with you. things might make more Sense. and the guy well if it happens it happens
sJTPzFdlaa	Take him aside, say "look, ur a nice guy but im just not interested in that way. And please stop telling people we are together". You are going to hurt him, but he will get over it.
AA10440098	If she's already in the country on some kind of visa, just marry her while she's here and - viola - she's got a green card. That allows her to work in the country and only has to be renewed every ten years or so. By that time she can become a US citizen anyway.  Use a fiance visa if she can't get any other kind of visa, or if other visa types are going to cost a lot. But if she already has a visa to come to the US you can just get married while she's here. IF you want time to plan a big wedding, you can get a civil marriage at the courthouse and then have a proper wedding later on.   Congrats!|`|26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	Contact the immigration office for information since they are the professionals.|`|pMsMx817aa	you said she's coming to the states on a work/study type visa, so i'm assuming she's not here yet  she doesn't need to file for a fiance visa, if she comes here on a student visa she can get married while she's here  but after you two get hitched, you will need to file the immigration petition for her and she'll file the adjustment of status package. A part of that package is an I-131 which is a request for a travel permit. She'll get the permit in 90 days, sometimes less. With that she can exit and re-enter the United States with no problems while the adjustment of status works its way through the system.    im not a professional, but i'm about to be going through the same thing with my boyfriend in a couple months so i've definetly done my homework    good luck!  ella

Then when the time is right, ask her to the movies.|`|Tc1BO5kkaa	get to know her and build a friendship before you ask her out. youll have a better chance at sucess.
IsnHXRo4aa	I think the bigger problem is the definition of love that most people hold. It's not all hormones and butterflies, it's not easy, and it's not impossible to achieve. It's about choices, honesty, deep compatibility and commitment. The thing is, when two people connect on a few levels, they don't always stop to consider all the ways they don't connect. That stuff gets brushed under the rug in the heat of the moment, time passes, and before you know it you've been dating someone for 6 months and you feel like you're in love. But one of you wants to get married and the other doesn't. One of you wants kids and the other doesn't. Or you're both really strongly emotional and volatile so you blow up at each other all the time. Or you're both passive aggressive and non-confrontational so you just avoid talking about things, and resentment builds up. IMO the most important aspect of a relationship - even beyond honesty and communication - is compatibility. You can talk til you're blue in the face and air out your dirty laundry beginning with the time you put a worm on that girls desk in 3rd grade, but if the woman think it's ok to go on vacation trips alone or "with the girls" and the guy isn't ok with that, there are some very important lifestyle core values that are conflicting there. I think people need to get to know who they are, decide exactly what they want and then go after it. And once you find it, commit a thousand percent. Don't be afraid to ditch someone after one date if you don't like the music they listen to or their taste in movies. You'll save yourself a lot of time, money, and heartache. You might go for longer periods of time without a long-term relationship, but when you do find that perfect (for you) someone you'll appreciate it that much more.|`|D27mJKmWaa	*sigh*.... you speak the truth... unfortunately :(|`|7VSGyWCPaa	the point of life is to figure out what we want in life and achieve it. if anything in life was easy would we enjoy it once we have it, or would it last long. love is both beautiful and ugly. if we never lost love how would know when we found it or know what kind of love we want.|`|BSKJdZK3aa	its our instinct    before when there were cavemen our instincts made us get attracted to the opposite sex so that we can reproduce and we love so that we can stay with that woman and take care of that child otherwise there would be a chance the child would die    also our instincts tell us to breathe, blink, swallow saliva without us knowing about it    and also our instincts MAKE us feel pain otherwise we would die    eg: when pinches your arm quietly you instantly feel pain as your bodys way of warning you that that part of your body is in trouble and needs your attention just think about it if you were bitten by a poisonous spider dont you think you would have died if you didnt feel pain ?    there are ways to remove pain    1) medidate  2) if you get shot in the leg in a place far from a city or town or far far from a place were you can get medication then your leg doesnt feel pain because your brain knows that you need to get up and not feel pain until someone can help      AND THATS A FACT    damn this is long

This has dragged for the past three and half years. I would say be prepared for a fight.
sARTaNLNaa	well, yes! what you are saying is right, Thoughts trigger feelings, but i feel that love is somethig that should not be forced. it should just happen. and forcing yourself to love someone, will just be something like cheating the other guy, and to some xtend cheating youself as well.|`|SsEN9KRqaa	are you out of your mind no matter what you do you cant completely control your emotions to make yourself love some one love is something that just happens between two ppl|`|NQuPNHPyaa	No you can't force yourself to love anyone.|`|d5aa461bdb5fa1bfd8158df539805abeaa	You should get one of those shock collars for dogs.

You'll be head-over-heals in no time!|`|Kh9Wzrhyaa	You cannot force yourself to love someone and why would you want to? Love is a natural force of nature that exists between two people. It is an all-encompassing intense emotion that can be overwhelming, in a positive way. Believe me, you will have a true appreciation for it once you experience it for yourself. There are too many possibilities out there to have to relegate yourself to forcing it.|`|zQheOHReaa	no, love is a process that comes naturally, if you have to force yourself to love someone, then you don't really love them.|`|M0JfRNipaa	of course not!   you should love someone because you love them   anyways why would you force yourself to love someone?|`|2dV79LHiaa	No! i've tried you can not force your heart to love someone it dosent!|`|Js3qsee2aa	no its not the true love and it will come from the deep heart with anybody, love is blind,,,,,|`|4Dc44BC5aa	No- you can think your in love, but only a matter of time will prove you don't love that person.|`|QY0ETRH0aa	You can not make yourself love someone.

AA10361198	Actually yes, I would mind. If you must marry in Hawaii because your fiance is Hawaiian then that's easy to understand but if you want to do it just 'because' then that sounds selfish. If you know people will care enough to attend your wedding you should keep that in consideration and save Hawaii for your honeymoon since you have that kind of money. You know the economy now is not looking very good, give your family and his a break. What good is a wedding that nobody can attend, without your loved ones. Mine was in Grandpa's backyard but the entire family was there and my mother and trust me, i wouldn't change that for freakin' Hawaii.|`|8HnLYjK4aa	i would just assume you did not want me there. so i would not go to the reception either.|`|884v4VhGaa	Having a destination wedding is really equivalent to not inviting the people in the first place. And yes, a first cousin not inviting me to their wedding is improper. I'd be upset, not at missing the wedding, but at being tacitly informed that I wasn't considered family.|`|m7VMwAplaa	My fiance and I feel the EXACT same way. We have to pay for the wedding ourselves and a destination wedding is usually a lot cheaper (though I don't know about Hawaii!). We're sad that some people won't be able to or willing to go. But its about US, not them, not the gifts. We are also having a reception when we get back for those who couldn't join us. Of course people are going to be sad they missed it... but in five, ten, or twenty years, it's YOU who's going to remember your wedding day - not them. Do what makes you and your fiance happy. If a destination wedding with those people does, then do it! If YOU really want all those people there, then make other plans. This really is about the two of you and your life together and not everybody else.|`|JgT3k7Ocaa	you don't have to spend thirty-five grand - you can have a very nice wedding at home for less than a third of that.    destination weddings are simply a new way of 'eloping' but you still get to have your gown, attendants, etc. and a select few friends as well.|`|ifgzHzA3aa	When a couple decides to have a destination wedding, they are making the conscious decision to have their wedding in the location of their choosing regardless of whether or not anyone can attend.  It is something that you really have to consider seriously.  Are you going to be happy with only 10 people at your wedding or would you rather have everyone, aunts uncles, cousins etc?      I have been to several wedding receptions in which the bride and groom were married elsewhere and then had a formal reception at home.  I have never felt disappointed that I couldn't attend the wedding ceremony, instead was happy that they had something at home so everyone could celebrate their marriage.|`|0jUGSaZPaa	I would be upset yes, but I would also be happy that I was still included....  :)    You can't let people's absence distinguish what kind of wedding you want...  I think having a little BBQ when you get home is a fantastic idea!!  Then you can pass around photos of the ceremony too, and people can admire them and still feel a part of it.|`|AA11603468	We did that, and it was wonderful. Of course, I never wanted a big ta da, so it was great, but I wouldn't do it if I thought I'd feel regrets later. We did pay for our immediate families to attend-so that might be something for you to consider. I thought it was an awful lot to ask someone to pay for airfare and hotel for several nights to attend my wedding just because we wanted it in a faraway locale.|`|2f2338425d995c6d00e32cb38d57ee7faa	I live half-way across the world from my family, so not being able to attend family events is nothing new. My brother is married for the 2nd time, and I haven't been able to attend either wedding. My dad came to my wedding 2 years ago, but no one else in my family could come. I think, people will most definitely get over not being able to go to your wedding; do what makes you happy, and your family will be happy for you. If you throw in a local reception on top of it, I don't think anyone would have anything to complain about. Congrats.|`|OIJ3JBkSaa	i would be disappointed of course but that's life.  many young people are doing the destination wedding idea and this year alone we will miss seeing two weddings of people we care about very much.  however it is not in our financial budget to do so. flying in and out of a holiday destination over a weekend is quite expensive, then add in the cost of accommodations, meals, and transportation to and from the venue and airport.  add that to having to take at least one day off work without pay or use precious holiday time especially in today's economic climate - adds up to a very very expensive weekend for the guests. not to mention that many who want to attend may also have to use credit cards to pay their way.   sorry sweetie its a lovely plan and i don't begrudge anyone their destination wedding but its only good for the bride and groom and a few select guests.    as for a reception once you returned home i guess thats a good idea - at least those who couldn't afford to see you married could pay their respects and bring a gift for you.    wishing you many years of happiness.........|`|lgxE5nUoaa	I've heard that a lot of times people with destination weddings send out save the date cards a few years in advance so that they give their guests ample time to save money if they want to come on the trip.  I've heard this works quite well!  But no, I would not be upset if I couldn't attend the wedding because of the distance - I would be happy for the couple and wish them well and send them a nice gift.|`|tmh42R6Caa	Most people don't go to desitnation weddings.  I had almost 200 people at my wedding.  If it were in Hawaii, I'd probably expect 30 to show up.  As long as the most important people are there (family, close friends, etc) I think you should go for it.  If this is the wedding you want, then enjoy it.  Having a 2nd reception back in the US is a good idea too so everyone can share the event with you.|`|aOjMf5SPaa	Yes - If its the wedding of someone I love - I want to see them choose their life partner with my own eys, I want to see their happiness.  I am planning my wedding at the moment. Instead of presents from them - the trip is enough, and I have chosen to supply accomodation and forego exuberant spending on other things. This way, my family will be there - which is most important. Have a look into it. And if you plan far enough ahead, they should be able to at least afford the plane trip.|`|d62310b3e25bb263db275c523c9cfe86aa	yes and no. Yes I would be disappointed I couldn't go, but I would be thankful I wasn't required to spend a lot of $ to go to HI.  Anyone who goes will have a good time and should make it a vacation, however how much time will guests actually get to spend with the bride and groom? Very little. You and your new husband will want to enjoy some alone time. I think the cocktail reception is a great idea. Present a video of the wedding (if you have one) or at least have a slide show for everyone to share in your wonderful memories in Hawaii.|`|deAyKj2Uaa	although it is very nice of you to be thinking about others situations, it is your wedding.  if you really want to marry in hawaii, you could have your ceremony there, and then say a couple weeks or a month later, have the big reception at home with everyone you love.      or  if you really want everyone to be there, you could have your wedding at home and go to hawaii for your honeymoon.  this may be a good way to go that way while you are in hawaii you wont have to worry about all the details of a destination wedding.  whatever you decide, good luck and congrats!!!!|`|JCAgvgTxaa	You write: Would you be upset if you couldn't attend a destination wedding and it was someone like a close cousin or a niece, for example?    No, I would not be upset.  I'd be glad that they had the opportunity to go to Hawaii.  I would say, "Send me a postcard from Hawaii, please!" before the event . . . and then later congratulate the newlyweds when they return home.|`|HJ0YTWjVaa	My fiance and I went back and forth on the idea of a destination wedding. He always dreamed of a beach wedding and really wanted one. I looked into beaches in the states AL, FL, SC, etc... we really didn't care who could attend. We aren't getting married for them we are getting married b/c we want to spend the rest of our life's together. We finally decided to go to Jamaica. It was actually cheaper and less stress worrying about everyone else. His parents, my mom and her boyfriend, and his sister and her husband are the only ones attending. They are paying for themselves. We are not making anyone pay to go (we wouldn't mind being alone)  they want to go so they are paying for themselves. They are not staying the entire time we are.     As for a reception we went back and forth on whether or not to have one and we decided not too. We are saving that money and going on another vacation some other time! Good luck and try not to let it stress you out.|`|caa265fc73cd7f24fe83d9a186ac1af9aa	You - and only you - can decide if you want those people there or if you would rather get married in Hawaii.    Personally, I'm very family oriented so I chose a local wedding over a destination wedding so I could ensure more of my family would be able to attend.  That doesn't mean the same decision is what is right for you, but if you are second-guessing by posting this question perhaps staying local and having a fantastic Hawaiian Honeymoon would be better for you.    I wouldn't be upset if I couldn't attend a destination wedding unless it was for my sister.  I would feel bad that I couldn't get there, but the bride & groom need to understand that destination weddings are cost prohibitive to alot of guests.|`|2d281c378a62cabf9789c151186cae74aa	I would say get married where you want and have a simple reception back at home.  Some couples opt to have a party the day before they leave for their destination wedding.  That way the guests that can't be there for the destination wedding can send them off with their well wishes!|`|AA11192442	I think that I would be disappointed, but not upset. If you're willing to cater to the people who weren't able to go to the destination wedding, then I think you'll be all right. Its your wedding, and no one else. So do what you want, enjoy it, and love it.|`|HZvo9YFHaa	i would considerate it. maybe have a honeymoon there instead.|`|skWN7jWHaa	your wedding is about you and your husband...the cocktail reception is a perfect solution! nobody that loves you would be hurt by that|`|F12LdDJ7aa	I think so long as you include these people in a reception back home, it's perfectly fine if they miss the actual ceremony.|`|qttPOdRBaa	If you plan to have a small wedding then destination would be great.  If you plan to have a large wedding then bring Hawaii home.  Not everyone will be able to go to Hawaii.  It's just not possible, unless of course some talk show host and The Knot helps you out.
BySnX7Gvaa	Well, first of all I am not here to judge Im not into girls, but I haven't ever dated either. I am also 14 and I think life is to short, and you should take a risk if she says no atleast you tried and P.S. It kinda sounds like she into you!!!

Lv3RYzKGaa	It's hard to say, i am in the same predicament at the moment too!  Well, i would think (this is from a girls perspective by the way) that you would catch the boy looking at you alot, making an effort to talk to you, smiling/ laughing with you and perhaps teasing you alot to get your attention.  If they make alot of eye contact, then that is another good sign.  I try to understand the way boys think/ feel towards someone but i have no idea whether i will ever figure it out or not, guys are soooo complicated- one minute they are giving you signs that they like you- the next day, they completely ignore you!  Good Luck Anyway xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx|`|Kp46I3W4aa	dose he look at you all the time or dose he text you call you all the time or playing around a lot with you?  that how you will know but it depends how he dose it so yeah.|`|hJS71QFgaa	he slaps your face|`|Jx9qRCGnaa	Usually, you can tell because he wants to get all up in your junk.|`|zzfbE70Qaa	when he asks u out|`|GRgdSrRwaa	ask derek!!|`|AA11302281	omg, I'm experiencing the way a guy gets nervous around me. Well basically, he can't stop talking about you, he finds a way to see you or talk to you, he finds any excuse to be around you, and when he is, he can't help to stop smiling. These are obvious ways a guy shows his emotions. But not all guys are the same, some don't show it. Those are probably the "hard knock" or "shy" guys.   love. ruby( :    ps.goodluckk.|`|vxwwZuuUaa	That depends on your age and the guy's age. People of different age acts differently. Rule of thumb: talk to him, and go out with him (not romantic settings, better with a group) and time will show if he likes you or not|`|Fp1C5zPRaa	You know, it's really hard to tell, Because despite all the magazines who say they're easy to read and etc... they're all different. Some might be shy and not talk to you, for fear you will reject them, others will be forward and upfront. And still others might be friendly and really just want to be friends. They're strange and interesting creatures. I find it's easier to just be myself and not question or pursue. Just let things happen. Some of them pick on the girls they like, you kindof have to wait things out and be suprised by what happens ;)|`|alaUYtRcaa	Okay. Well there are two different ways he can do it. If he's a sweet guy, he's going to stare into your eyes and say very sweet things to you. But that could also mean he's just a good friend.    Another way is ignoring you, then talking to you again, like playing hard to get so you want him more. Or if he makes fun of you a lot so you think he's not into you. See, there's a difference between boys and girls in flirting. Boys think if they act like they aren't interested in you at all and your just a stupid girl, then us girls will never suspect them, but that's actually when they're most obvious.|`|sCr2iTczaa	i know guys are interested when they tend to stare or look at you a lot and that is a fact.|`|UH67GysTaa	ugh well i just had a guy flirt with me for months and i finally asked him to go out bc hes hinted a lot and he was like i just said yes to another girl. guys suck|`|ec9cd1a19bba30708d858894d59d9cb2aa	he will smile a lot .|`|ou2CHy9Raa	you can never really know when a guy likes you.  some factors include, though:  if they make fun of you, they could like you.  if they tell you youre pretty.  if they try to show off.  if they start acting weird in front of their guy friends.  if they keep looking at you.  if they whisper to someone and then they look in your direction.  if they talk about you to someone else.    then, usually, they like you.  :D
2ee7c7cc26d963adf4e22da471543493aa	I assume she was shy, unless of course your flies were undone.|`|9FyxeA1Zaa	Happens to me sometimes haha    I could be a FIRST sign shes attracted to you or just embarassed / shy :P     Just get to know her, talk to her!|`|nX5whEkOaa	she needed a wee =] (it has to be said) :D sorry....lol.....awww, she thought omg i look awful today and he's looking at me :P|`|wav24Tquaa	happens with embarrassment mostly     sarah x x x|`|2QiLmXfhaa	lol. she might have been embarresed u were staring at her.

Let him know your feeling have changed and you really like him as a friend now.|`|POVsINQ1aa	say no|`|vR6AwIppaa	if you really like his personality, then how he looks should not be a factor. love people for who they are on the inside, and if you really like him then how he looks shouldn't bother you.|`|pVUhlg4iaa	kids go out in 4th grade?????     what are u doing getting advice from strangers online? stop worrying ab this kids body and start focusing on ur social studies quiz.|`|8di0rKm1aa	you guys are too young  wtf lol rofl|`|zr2W7mEWaa	I don;t know what to answer but i think you are too young...|`|AWoH1oN0aa	you should never try to change somebody if theres something u dont like about them get over it or move on|`|d49ZA5xYaa	why does it matter if hes athletic? you should like him for him, not what he looks like. if you can't accepted him for the way he is then you should not go out with him. if you do like him then say yes if he asks you. if you dont like him, say no.|`|Ej5ykFwYaa	If you wish he could be any thing but what he is . He's not the one for you.

As for if you DO want to go out with him, you just want him to lose weight, then tell him straight up ill go out with you but only if you lose some up weight first.  or you could go out with him rite after u told him this, and then start going to the gym, running, and playing basketball together; he would lose the pounds in no time!    The all-knowing wrestler has spoken.. you have just been enlightened.|`|Wf5ZUD3Uaa	well there really no way to tell him that with out hurting his feelings. If you wanna go out tell him that you are worried about his weight. if you dont wanna go out with him don't even talk to him for awile. but its really your choice hope i helped|`|jh4JnZ6Faa	sounds like you're being a little shallow.  If you still like him, say yes. It doesn't matter what other people think.   If you don't like him, don't be afraid to say no thank you.
aDLvzG2Saa	If you have discussed it with him numerous times and he still doesn't want to respect your feelings, then he does not deserve you. You can always find someone who will respect you and your feelings.|`|ThqwMNaGaa	i had bascially the same bf.. and he never changed.. i was so crazy for him that 6 years later it still stings to think about it,    he finally married this really rude b|t(hy girl.. i think it helps that she puts him in his place whereas i was so sweet to him,    good luck..  he needs t o respect you. but you need to respect yourself and not let him do this. you don't deserve it|`|alaUYtRcaa	im sorry but it seems like things are not going to work out.. i would break up with himm dont wait for him to change he doesnt deserve the chance..|`|Rc00ne20aa	I can tell that he is not the guy that you feel in love with tell him how you want him to be and if he does not change then dump him.

poZfLPe0aa	Start off simple. You're young, so maybe you can approach the matter by getting your friends to talk to his friends for you, etc, and see how he feels about you.     Does he have a MySpace? Maybe you can add him and leave him a, "hey, I see you around sometimes.." type of message. If he's interested, he won't let it go by without responding.     Good luck in love and relationships.
7fE27hcIaa	Very dodgy
y4SUDnpaaa	You may be mature for your age, but you're still 14 and have a lot of life experience to go. Adults with life experience do not want to be lectured by a 14 year old and told they see things wrong. What makes you so sure you're always right and need to point that out to the adults. I was an only child, around adults a lot too. What often happens in these situations is that the child begins to think they are omnipotent.......which in turn (pardon me but it's true ) often means they act bratty  and pompous and have a terrible time adjusting to real life when they become adults. Lighten up and prove the child experts wrong.|`|HPlpIy9maa	You don't. You ignore them. That would be the mature thing to do.|`|aXqi9lYJaa	Um, just stop! Lol, have some fun. I mean what kind of things wrong?    -Like popping the popcorn type of wrong?  OR  -Like raising you wrong?    Because if it's like the first one, just chillax! Let them do what they want you to do. Stop trying to be so mature. Really...I mean, just be a kid.    But if it's like the second one...well if it is then go to my profile and IM me.|`|1D2UiAJeaa	just let them learn from their own mistakes unless it is something dangerous|`|DcVoq5Tuaa	do you always listen when someone tries to correct you when you do something wrong? I doubt it. Let it go and don't correct every little mistake they make. Sometimes they know they have erred and have chosen to stay on that path then correct it. Let them learn it on their own.
iEZ4j0kuaa	she's just probably busy. don't think too much.
8p31dENPaa	There is a difference between being IN love with someone and loving someone. When you are in love it's the best feeling in the world, it's written all over your face when you talk about him/her, when you see him/her. When you look into his/her eyes, you have this instant connection, bond, and you just understand without saying a single thing.|`|JKZUdhCPaa	If you're in love you would know. Loving someone is like you can love your best friend. Being in love is different, its like loving them for everything and having the best feeling when you talk to them|`|ID3eCpwCaa	Being "in love" is a feeling that can't really be described.  When you are near them it's almost like your heart beats faster and slower at the same time.  Like you are right were you belong, home.  Loving someone is caring about their wellbeing and happiness, but you could love your sister or your best friend.  Being in love is on a different level.  You would know it if you were in it.|`|WSbfkuSZaa	Loving someone and being IN love with someone can be very similar. You love your family, but you wouldn't want to spend your life making a "life" together would you? You care about their well being and would do a lot to help them, but it is just love between two human beings. I think that being in love with someone includes all of those things, however they are more to you. They are your mate, partner, teammate, best friend, lover and support person all rolled into one. You care about their well being and would sacrifice your own to make it happen. I think that romantic feeling definitely have a part in there because part of the attraction to a spouse should be as a lover. Mainly you just have to think about how far your love extends and whether the physical attraction is just lust.

If I don't like him at all that would be a complete turn off... unless of course he is absolutely gorgeous, then perhaps, but the whole not liking him at all thing would still probably be a turn off.|`|YLagYArhaa	its possible but its hard to not get attached and people like those above me will point fingers and say dirty names so i wouldn't advice it!|`|467145608db35ec4ccc89f1b16418af6aa	yes.  it's easier to find guys like that than girls.    but i don't recommend it.|`|AA11288692	No. A female can walk out and find any number of guys willing to roll, with no strings attached. Might as well find someone that turns you on.|`|u2rDNTPEaa	I don't think it's possible to separate sex from emotions. At some point, the emotions will get mixed into the sex causing it to end messy.  One person will develop feelings for the other and if the other doesn't agree, well they get hurt. they might even continue with the sex because they think if they stop, they'll lose that person completely...all this stringing along only makes them wind up hurting more. that's just my opinion. hope it helps!|`|d0lye0cyaa	Why would you want to do that?  Sex should be with someone you love not an asshole.|`|7543ecccee07c9c1c32ee1b21fd58295aa	Oh it is definitely possible. I have one that i dont like as a person, but in bed she is great. I think sometimes our needs overshadow our emotions.
PmC0e6e1aa	Dish soap, oils and butters should get it off. What ever you do, DO NOT heat it - it'll hurt you so bad!|`|0e0a0f1828f99f87ea3d5e5bc8cbd46daa	Try warm soap and water, or liquid dishwashing liquid. Hope that helps, it usually works for me. Have you tried butter? Or Olive Oil? Something has to make it come off.|`|fUBWB88laa	Windex will work EVERY time. That's what we used at the jewelry store when someone would come in and they weren't able to get their ring off. First run your finger under ICE cold water...that will help shrink your finger, then just spray some Windex on your finger, rub it around and twist your ring back and forth....then twist it and pull it off at the same time, don't just pull... if you try too much your finger will swell and you'll have to wait a while for it go back down.|`|tak8FsUAaa	get the ring hot. metal expands when heated..|`|J6wPJlvVaa	Why do you want your ring off? is it cutting off circulation? if i were you, i would just leave the ring on. But if you really want it off, try taking a long piece of string, and starting right at the base of your finger (in front of the ring) wrap it very tightly around your finger. Keep winding it around the finger, and see if that will make your finger skinny enough to get the ring off. If that doesn't work, i would get it cut off; this is the method they use in the hospital i work at, and after that they just cut the ring. Good luck!|`|7294c9edbf7c247468b6e48776c6fcadaa	Put your hand in ice water. Fill the sink with ice and water. Keep it in there until hand gets real cold to point it is hurting a little.  Then use dish washing soap. Pour it right onto the ring and and all over the finger, then work it around as you try pulling the ring off in a twisting motion.    If that doesn't work you will have to go ahead and get it cut off.  Go to the jeweler you are planning on using to cut it off for you.   Since you are getting it resized anyway don't worry about having it cut because the jeweler will do that when he resizes it anyway.|`|FnskUYpqaa	Try vaseline or oil around the whole finger that should work.|`|0XbyDBQLaa	Try some dish soap around your ring. Massage it underneath, and then try to pull it off.    Hope this helps! :))|`|kRh3slhdaa	You will only make it worse if you go near heat, not only will the ring expand, so will your finger, causing it to become swollen around your ring. Trying to pull it off will be hard. Place your hand under cold, runny, soapy water. Your finger will contract and become slippery enough to come off.|`|TZmzjFGzaa	If all else fails try goo gone!   went through the same exact thing!!|`|Y8AMVwXUaa	this one time i got this kids finger unstuck by soap. im guessing its a similar situation. so my answer is soap|`|884v4VhGaa	Have you tried holding your hand above your head? 15 minutes normally does it (you can rest it on something). I second the ice water suggestion if that doesn't work. And honestly, unless it's tension-set I'd just get it cut after that.
ivlOxlG6aa	Practice in front of a mirror. Be confident. Have faith in yourself. Always think that you'll do great. And if your thinking about asking him out, then your obviously mature and it's not weird. Good Luck :) :) :) :)|`|9220e99cf581203dda5db0c56616ac40aa	you should start a convo w/ him, but he should be asking YOU out.|`|aDLvzG2Saa	Go up to him and start a conversation!    Guys love it when a girl takes initiative like that. Say something like "I see you here all the time and thought I'd come over and say hello." Blah blah blah, stuff like that.    I'm sure he'll be surprised, but glad you came over to him.    Good luck|`|3bu2QCfnaa	If hes on the tredmile, then try getting one right next to him. Do something to strike up a convorsation, drop your water or something right next to him and when he picks it up say thanks and ask him his name and say you've seen him here alot and ask him how long hes been a member and questions will turn into a convorsation between the both of you. If he doesnt seem that interested chances are hes not. But oh well, youll look friendly !|`|Rn7zkS52aa	just go up and talk to him! say hi and introduce yourself. ask him how long he's been coming here to workout or something to break the ice. tell him you've been noticing him and was wondering if he'd like to hang out sometime.     direct, casual, to the point. be confident and i'm sure he'll be into it!|`|rfYXFV8Jaa	Well, if he has not talked to you yet, that could mean one of two things; he is in a serious relationship, or he is a shy guy....  If he is the latter, then you should be aggressive and start a conversation with him... He would probably enjoy it....  If he is the former, oh well, there is nothing wrong with flirting and getting to know someone by casual conversation.... just don't expect a date....  In either case, Go talk to him.... no harm.... no foul.....  Good Luck....|`|r1D9P4Vyaa	If I were you I would do something simple, shoot him a "wink" then see what happens. This is a suttle way of showing I think your cute but,don`t have to talk to him yet. if he does nothing, then as you walk bye him just a simple "hi". still nothing? Then the guy already has a girl or is not interested. If a girl did this to me I would be there talking to her right away!  Good Luck!|`|DvSuHNV8aa	No guy has ever been offended by a girl asking him out.  Go for it!|`|mOayTJDmaa	Talk to him.

Boys are real jealous when it comes to "babe" and "hun" if he really likes you then he would be jealous.    Or you could pick the pencil yourself in a sexy way. Bend down like the sexy way u no.|`|dQDL8iM6aa	If you think that your confident for who you are then your perfect. In my point of view, since i'm a dude. I dont like any of ex to date another dude after i broke up with her. And if she dates a chick!! Then WTH! lol What ima doing wrong lol. She would have to bite her bottom lips everytime when she's about to kiss her date. And she has to look sexy to make me jealous. And she would probably go out with her date everytime we meet eyes. That would make jealous in a sexy way.  1.BE CONFIDENT  2.DATE SOMEONE ELSE  3.LOOK SEXY AND ACT SEXY ( giving hugs or kisses )  4.Try not to be a stalker but see him with your date.  5."HIM' would probably be jealous after num.3   idk but i hope it helps you.! ( ^0^ )|`|MJ4zkWz0aa	While it is not a good idea, it is nice to know you are cared about,  maybe fake interest in another, or start a false rumor about some one else   liking you. Not that I advise this sort of behavior,  be careful.
UZsSWMupaa	omg weird my brother's name is Chad and he is 13 lol but the way it sounds like that he is a bit upset that you don't like him anymore i mean after all that you know the stuff you did like hanging out or whatever and you just don't like him sounds like it could be really upsetting to him but talk to him see what is going in with him i mean he has to tell some one
3RDOPzGeaa	no.. it's not right. it sounds like there are other reasons too though. Nobody breaks up with someone just b/c they like Michael Jackson.|`|vMY3EF8baa	NO|`|Talzm1x7aa	nopeee|`|ksEkWEd2aa	lol i think that's a really pathetic reason. if thats really the reason why he broke up with you i think you're better off finding someone else. imagine if down the line you had a great guy friend he'd probably dump you because you can tell your guy friend a lot of things too...that just shows he's very insecure and something to look out for
ZH1IE8kLaa	i have a friend who stutters. i never noticed it though until someone pointed it out. she and i have talked about it. she went to speech therapists to try to change her stutter, but it didn't help much. she just got really irritated. there was a time in her life when she wouldn't talk because of it. i'm so glad that she got over that though.. she even sings. ;)     that pic is probably what most of them want to do. to them it's a huge flaw and they don't want nor do they need it pointed out to them.
Vf5OnZ4Caa	oh this is easy, instead of flirting with him/ giggling around him/ stalking go up to him one day and just say Hi my names _____, whats yours? or if you know what already just say something like what did you think of the homework, or just a simple whats up? will do..    the key is to be different than all the other girls. DONT flirt, and try a little-hard to get, which will make him interested in youu/ good luck|`|IxreZ1qeaa	awwe thats so cute!  that happened ot me last year. (:  just talk to him like your talking to a normal friend.   just be yourself.|`|8a7c02df359d96db8ffa457a92b75e50aa	You should say  "Hi. My name is ___. What's yours? How was your day?"     You guys will probably become friends. Maybe even good friends after a while.|`|TaIfN5d0aa	All you have to do is be super polite! Do not throw yourself at him because then you'll look like every girl at your school to him. Ask him about homework, or say things like 'Don't forget about that test tomorrow!' things like that. Anything like that will make him feel like he's not just some boy. He'll know your thinking about him.|`|sz6VWpDYaa	you should definatley not ask him out...  just use small talk like ask him how his days been going. just get to know him more. then maybe when the day comes ask him does he like you through a note or try to get a friend to help u with it.|`|xLTyy8NIaa	what you need to do is just be yourself and at first just conduct a normal conversation but make eye contact with him and dont make him feel like you are like the other girls dont give him the feeling that you are going to stalk him too you want to show him that you are different so be sweet and easy going so you dont scare him   hope it helps :) good luck :)|`|U3ox0x6qaa	talk to him, then maybe ask him if he wants to hang out with you and your friends or something fun.  just be yourself and let him see the real you. dont put on an act just to impress him|`|F4KrClClaa	kewlll, i'm in 7th grade too. i think yuu should ask him how's he doing and stuff, that are normal, then, when he gives signs of crushing on yuu, yuu should ask him out. or let him ask yuu out, though boys seem to like to take their time.|`|4dOUhlTtaa	P/Z P/Z  listen 2 me k the thing you should do is ask him out FAST i bin there to i like a boy n ma class 4 summer skool and i know he liked me and other girls like him 2 but he jus look's at me ALOT and i was to shy 2 ask him out so i never did then he was goin out with MY OWN BEST FRIEND and i told him y did he did that he said is because he thought i never liked him so i never got over it i am in 7th grade 2 and that happen this summer               P/Z  GET MA ADVICE|`|C8DOT8Y7aa	Ask him out or talking is the best way.|`|m1IQDoUAaa	Talk to him at your locker!

That you have NEVER had a significant relationship?  Or are you just saying that you have never found the "one and only?"  I went through that too (the last one, that is).  I finally met my guy when I was 49, after literally giving up the search.  Everyone told me to stop looking and he would find me.  It happened.  Now I am widowed, and hope springs eternal that there might be another guy out there for me.  I hope so, because I loved being part of a "we."  Best wishes to you!
pq9nt5Lpaa	Because it's someone you have loved since you were born. Also to see the state he was in must have been awful. It's natural to hurt, even more so if they were close to you. It's just life. I hope you and all you're family will be ok soon enough x|`|PMPUQvUZaa	death is expected because you know that eventually you or someone you love is going to die. the part that hurts is not knowing when and how it will happen. my cousin from baltimore got shot in the head and he was only 23 it happened this month. he had a daughter and was doing well with two jobs. it hurt to know someone with nothing to do with their life took his but i am glad he doesnt have to suffer anymore. death is the expected unexpected. but if you just keep praying and putting God first it will turn into a celebration because the person you loved will be living a better life and won't have to worry about this one. And they would want you to be happy for them and celebrate their life not grieve it. You're is smiling at you from above and he wants you to be happy that he doesn't have to suffer anymore down here. keep your head up|`|OOYc7Mbfaa	Because it is a loss.  Even though we know that no one will live forever, when death comes, we realize that it is the end of the relationship that we had and it will never be realized again.  Even when we realize that death is imminent, it is still a shock when it comes.  We will miss the person, and depending on the relationship, may grieve for a long time.  Eventually the good memories help to ease the pain of loss.|`|5zdmwHIhaa	We are humans. We have feelings and we get attached to others. Animals may not be that way, but we are. We love our family and friends and we surround our lives with those people. It is perfectly alright to hurt, and cry over those that we lose.
d965e1ee32a568d9ac1b196430305a73aa	Depending on the size of your wedding, you may only need a competent caterer and florist to handle the decor of the ceremony and reception and flow of the reception.  It depends on what the caterer offers in their services -- will they direct the night: first dance, when to cut the cake, etc.?    It's a great idea to hire a wedding coordinator if your wedding is more than just immediate family.  They can be contracted for the a few weeks before to help with details (like choosing the ceremony music and invitations) and to organize or just for the rehearsal and "day of".  This take A LOT of pressure off of you and your mom or whoever is helping you out.    A coordinator can also help out by directing you to services that she/he is already familiar with, like a baker for the cakes, DJ, limousine service, make-up/hair artist, someone to care for the dresses the day of (steam out wrinkles, etc), photographer.    If you decide to hire one, ask for references with phone numbers.    Have fun!|`|s6stLtvLaa	DJ, Limo (how is your wedding party going to get around?) Photographer,  Wedding cake.  Someone to do the invitations (I just used David's Bridal, but some people like to be more personal with their invitations).  My suggestion (if it is in your budget) is to hire a wedding planner for the last month (or even just for the day of your wedding).  That way THEY can focus on getting everything going smoothly for the day of the wedding and you don't have to run around worrying about everything.|`|wzpCMI44aa	Don't forget a photographer! And remember, your wedding is a once-in-a-lifetime event, so choose your photographer carefully! Make sure he/she is professional, talented and that you feel at ease with him/her. And DON'T scrimp here... your photos will be all you have to remember your day 20 years from now, and you get what you pay for!|`|afkygHMgaa	A DJ or band. A baker for the cake. A photographer|`|6jZcr33paa	A DJ, if you plan on having one.|`|rvBPZRV6aa	DJ, Band, Photograher, Vidoegrapher.
dkyrRi87aa	I use to have this problem with my boyfriend of 3 yrs. He started acting like i was bothering him if i called or sent him a text! So, i started hanging out with my own girlfriends and then it got to were he was calling me and i was to busy. Honestly you both need some alone time and hanging out with friends will help you take your mind off him and have a good time without him. trust me it will definitely make your relationship better! it did with us
FoLpmJ3Waa	First off; you are very pretty (:  Secondly; I think that when he is around you, he is comfortable to be all shy and quiet, but when he is with his pals, he has to act all tough to act as if he doesn't care.  Which, based on this, I'd say he likes you.|`|WqRAWA4Yaa	lol  yer pretty cute : )     if u 2 are sitting like at the same dask   try to scoot yer chair closer to his  and sorta lean on he a minute  ascting like your reading his paper    but only for a minute    then get off his shoulder     and see what he dose...|`|Ua9CZtINaa	You look nice!!!  Ask him out, but keep it low-key, just tell him in private or something. :)  Good Luck!!|`|Z11jZXOmaa	idk it's hard to tell! he probably liked the clothes you wore that no uniforms day. Or maybe he does like you, he is probably just scared of what his friends might think.|`|LmpvelKtaa	yes ps if u can help me that would be so useful just look up does he like me? and wat sould i do? ok thank u bye|`|U9vE47hdaa	he likes you. he's just being a guy. they do that sometimes.|`|mINKANlAaa	aww, im not sure. i mean he could like you, but he could have just liked what you wore that day.....you should get one of your friends to ask him who he likes. you never know until someone asks :)    btw you are very pretty, so dont say "im not that pretty" lol     good luck with this guy!! :)|`|gsjndbkoaa	kwell,  I think he likes you :D  Go for it..  Tell him!|`|bNx1q5oWaa	hey you fine , im your age, just talk to him ask him out to the mobies or something like that.|`|HnWgVzDEaa	Normal ...no ... but history is his favorite class and anatomy is mine !

vKhZDRyoaa	Well girl , no need to feel idiot or something it's tottally normal   Maybe i am the guy you are talking about ? hehe   Well , Just take it easy as long you guys live near there will be Like many chances to get him   Be smart , do the things that he might love , if you cant talk with him directly talk to one of his near friends and then you will get him   Ummm wt else   Oh tell us when you get him ;)   Good luck|`|u49dfBkDaa	Do it the english way and go to a party you know he'll be at and get v drunk and dance with him and kiss him. Works a treat, and if it doesn't, you can always blame the alcohol. I'm too shy to actually start conversations with guys, but this technique works trust me.|`|RMYidmGaaa	You're too uptight on this haha.  Calm down, You're fine.  When you see him, give him a bright smile and say hi, stop him and ask him how his day went.  The first step is small talk.  Ask him if he wants to hang out after a few chats, or wait for him.  If you get rejected, atleast you tried!|`|cmB25Vxeaa	just relax and say something kinda flirty and see his reaction, if its a good reaction be bold and ask him out or something.
nOVyrsl4aa	I'm so glad someone asked this question! I'm an aries and my life long male friend is a Taurus, we've bad a rocky back-and-forth relationship for almost five years now. Although we've gone our separate ways, I still think of him often and we occasionally catch up to keep in touch.     I love him as a person now and realistically I don't think we make such a great match. Aries can be very strong-headed and Taurus by nature are more relaxed, It would have to take a lot of understanding on both sides.    I hope it works out for you two though...|`|yQRVxC61aa	it doesn matter.. i used to look up such stuff a lot.. but its not true.. m wid my perfect match but its relationship from hell.. it realy doesnt matter.. bottom line is. do u trust adn love each other|`|AA11501437	hmm - i am a taurus, and so far for me:    aries / taurus  taurus / taurus  and leo taurus relationships dont work.    but i dont believe in this stuff either...    good luck|`|6wR9QkAlaa	I'm Taurus too and I've always found Aries pleasant to get on with and a couple of strong life friends are Aries but I've never had a relationship with one.  I hear Taurus and Aries can be a fine match though. Look it up on the internet further, and tell you what for the most part just forget about it and go for it because girls love confidence and that can't fail!   But I appreciate your Zodiac curiosity :)|`|0XjSb8Udaa	I am an Aries too. I think it is a good match too, because there is a guy in my school who always stares at me and he is a Taurus too.|`|60AjkhZ2aa	I really dont believe in this stuff, but...

XtLZXIEyaa	Ask him out on a date.
lMZQJEsKaa	Did he remember that it was your 2-year anniversary?  If not, that's a pretty typical male.  (You should have reminded him)  If he knew, did he have a good reason for not showing up?  If not, I think it's time to call it quits.  Even if he didn't know, he should have called to tell you he wasn't coming.  Does he treat you this way often?  If so, don't put up with it.  Of course you should say something!!|`|0sPQnq7oaa	Here's what you should do: Dump his ***.  He cheated, and you took him back? Really? You have been dating a guy for two years who, a) doesn't care enough about you/your feelings/your love to stay faithful, and b) doesn't even give a rats *** about how long you two have been together.  Come on now, how do you think this situation looks to everyone else?  Who looks like the fool? Him, the guy who doesn't care (despite what he might be saying)? Or YOU?
DdfrWkbQaa	Ask him out. Trust me (I'm a guy), we get nervous too. We'd much rather get asked out than have to ask someone else out.|`|hIurSh3Daa	Carry a six-pack between your legs...............    :o)|`|wQiVfIciaa	BE YOURSELF. And if your really shy, ask 1 of his friends to ask him out for you or tell him u like him. Hope I helped.|`|o0zKfvImaa	what i would do is have one of my friends like ask him who he likes and see if he likes you, if he doesn't.. then movee onn.
gcG1jvbnaa	it means that they approach you truthfully or that they trust you or that they like ... Lol one of those
5c5e9767db0aa6f5bac57f3e406b4092aa	i dont know where you live, but typically after prom, my high school always goes to the shore
X6hK915Naa	1." you are loving caring and just loveable "  2. "i like these traits and i kinda like you"  3. "its just not working out between us" or  "i wish i could be with you more"  4. "i think we need to end this relationship"  5. "i care for you truelly"|`|8di0rKm1aa	i'm a guy    it means he definetly likes you duhh  he may be committed, but he doesnt want you, to be blunt. its not personal, he may be deeply troubled for some reason.|`|F3VPADcRaa	HE HATES YOU! HE THINKS YOUR GROSS AND WANTS NOTHING TO DO WITH YOU!|`|0sPQnq7oaa	"I'm just not that into you."|`|weckW02caa	excuses to not commit to you.|`|dWHSmESNaa	From my experience...    1. I want to have sex with you.    2. See  1. Could also just mean he's a sweet guy who really likes you.    3. I don't want to be in a long-distance relationship. Not worth it.    4. I'm not interested,    5. Either exactly what it says, or just not wanting to sound like a jerk|`|CcYpcSb1aa	as a guy, i would say it depends on the guy.    for me 1 and 2 would be compliments  3 to 5 would be facts, but im pushing you away.    all people are individuals, there is no such thing as one size fits all.|`|3r7aBIXeaa	1. were going to fast OR just simply that he likes you a lot    2. Exactly that    3. I've met someone else OR I don't do long distance daiting    4. He doesn't like you and is just trying to let you down easy    5. He doesn't like you the same way and doesn't want to hurt your feelings OR Hes got problems and doesn't want to hurt you, either way its not really a good thing to hear comeing from a guys mouth...    Hope this helps!|`|3ktg7iUyaa	1. Your very good looking or easy and the guy likes you.  2. You are those and the guy likes you.  3.  Doesnt want to date you just because he doesnt want to or you live to too far away.  4. He doesnt want to date you.  5. Thats kind of confusing but its either he doesnt know how to say no to you or is dateing you and doesnt want to hurt you and you mean the world to him.|`|Wf5ZUD3Uaa	1.He likes you  2.He is trying he is falling in love  3,4,5.A lame excuse to break up or not to date he don't like you and he is an jerk|`|476e4d0658d635ac13fff50369c427c5aa	Like the movie "hes just not that into you". Girls have a hard time understanding men and that's why many relationships don't work. I guess us girls need to get the point as soon as body language, reactions, etc. start to change and need to know if the dude is in for a serious relationship or just a fling! Like that one lady in the movie says "you better get some rims and some ice cream, because you have just been dumped!", sucks but its the truth!|`|agTCqkLDaa	If it's said all together then yes, it means I'm just not that into you.    If it's all said separately it means:    1. I'm not in love with you, but I could be...if you let me in your pants.    2. I'm trying to say things you want to hear so I can get into your pants.    3. I'd most definitely cheat on you if we were in a long distance relationship.    4. There's this other girl, but I'm not man enough to tell you that, so I'm going to pull this lame excuse.  The other girl and I have feelings but haven't pursued them because I'm kind of a decent human being, but this is the easiest way to let you down.    5. I will hurt you, but I'm trying to show you how sensitive I am so I still have a chance at getting in your pants.|`|d8DqZblcaa	Means you should move on.|`|G64uE64Vaa	i got  5 last yr.  i can still hear him saying that to me, in my head though.|`|pVUhlg4iaa	I could really see myself dating you, but the timing isnt right.|`|beiztH7iaa	1. "I am being my most charming self - hope you buy it".    2. "I like you and I want you to like me".     3. That one's unambiguous -  you live too far apart. But the fact that he's not making any effort to change or do anything about that suggests it's a handy excuse anyway.    4. "I have another girlfriend."    5. "I am just about to hurt you. A lot."  (be warned).|`|KW77oNWraa	well IF he's telling the truth then he wants to move on but doesn't want to run away until your okay. and was this a break up? if not im sorry it probably is.|`|NXJDsVfNaa	It might mean that he likes you, he just can't get involved because of conflicting things in his life.|`|7BkbvD7Zaa	He wants sex without the attachment.    Just my 2 cents|`|3qN2LC3Jaa	1 I like you.    2 I like you... and I broke your favorite vase.    3 I miss you.    4 Bye.    5 "Let's just be friends."|`|POVsINQ1aa	we can be friends with benefit's|`|U1e7wJgYaa	1.YOUR SEXY  2.TOTALLY THE ONE  3.HES NOT INTO YOU  4.GE OVER ME I DONT WANT U  5.JUST GIVE UP I DONT WANT 2 DUMP U
m7730ZPPaa	Well you could wait in the kitchen (doing dishes, making a meal) wearing shorts and a nice fitting t shirt, listening to music then when he comes quickly pretend your dancing (kinda cool sexily) to the music with your back turned behind and earphones, then you just turn around taking out your earphones and say "I'm sorry didn't see you there, hope i didn't startle you with my dancing...I'm [insert name]"      There you go.|`|rTscI3Lwaa	keep it simple, say hi try and talk ask if he wants a drink then ask if he will walk u back home because you dont feel comfortable walking back on your own. walk to door step ask him if he will do you a favor by testing your firealarm or an other exuse to get him in your home and then make a move drag him upstairs and *** the living $hit out of him.    or you could just go as far as the drink then put the offer of sex straight up, most men like a keen lass i know i do|`|eRGWEJOyaa	WOW  You're a girl and don't know how to seduce a lad?  EPIC FAIL|`|887TooCPaa	It's spelt seduce.    Wear something that catches his attention but doesn't mark you out as a sket....    Then, just start talking to him., Hey, you alright? is a pretty good starter.    Don't be too nervous.  Plus, don't work yourself up. He might have a gf/not be interested.    Good Luck!!  x|`|nX5whEkOaa	the two previous answers made me laugh! hahhahahah!    take your clothes off, that always works for me =P =P =P  just say i think you're hot do u think we could hook up some time =]manipulation is the key to seduction, but then again relationships that started from manipulation dont ever last =[    haha, have fun =P|`|acdf2a2c14fccbe7a3badc5fa8d3abe1aa	If you are new to the area - what is there to do around here?    Ask if he knows where something is, i.e. where the glue it, or how to do something, i.e. open the window that is stuck.    Just talk to him and get to know him, ask what he does (i.e. studies or type of job or what he had studied before and where, whether he liked it...).    SMILE at him, guys love it when girls smile. Be friendly, briefly touch him on his arm or shoulder, and just act like it is normal, laugh at yourself if you feel you have done something stupid.|`|cbp7Gukbaa	What you going to name the baby ?|`|om9PLGecaa	do you wanna go for a drink some time and take it from there     or if you dont drink(like me) do you wanna go have some fun and go bowling ice skating rock climbing or anything like that    get to no him first then seduce him|`|mdtkor2Paa	dance sexily|`|uO3RwRjUaa	Just go downstairs and be up front with him.  Just start by hey wats up? And as he starts talking interrupt him and go so i think you are really cute.  thatll get him. ;] trust me. -lillY
RCZCeBQsaa	Once you think hes in love with you because that's a great way to figure out if he is or not because that's a major turn off in most situations bt if he loves you he'll atleast try to wait if he doesnt drop you like a bag of rocks. well now that i think about it that would kinda destroy him from the inside out so ya right off the bat.|`|ZH1IE8kLaa	right at the start. don't wait.|`|OtgLLpn5aa	After you're sure you love/like him a lot.|`|dWHSmESNaa	As soon as you can and feel comfortable. You want to make sure he knows this before he tries anything. This also helps weed out guys who would use you.    I told my ex on the second date.    I told this other guy after one date (complicated scenrio though...I won't get into it).|`|oMIxJTO1aa	Have fun waiting, if your with the one you love i truly dont see the point to wait till marriage, wonder what will happen if you get married and do have sex and realize theres no chemistry, that u dont feel nothing when intimate? anyways not what you asked, as for whn to tell him, you should have told him rite at the start so asap..thats a big factor, dont make him think he has a cahnce to be close with u in that manner b4 marriage by not telling him...be honest with him and tell him how u feel and wut u want, nothing shld be kept between 2 partners, absolutly nothing!!|`|4ASrob17aa	be up front from the beginning!!! that's the most perfect time! trust me!!!  towards the beginning is most differently the best time! and go for you if you wait til marriage your great!|`|wVXXPRmZaa	When you notice he wants to have sex.

Now most people out there would leave but, all that means is that they don't respect the woman's decision.|`|ZGJZvGjZaa	Well, there are two main reasons people divorce:  1.) money    2.) sex.    So, I could not possibly imagine marrying someone without knowing whether we were sexually compatible.   I've been married 22 years so I know what I'm talking about.  Answer- leave her and find a nice woman with a healthy attitude about sex.|`|vMY3EF8baa	well im a girl but i think if u really love her then u should respect her decision. guys who are jerks and only want sex would dump her. which is bad|`|dJkNofnoaa	If he loves you he'll understand and wait, My boyfriend does and we're 16.

z6YwEjlpaa	My first time was when I was 17, and it was rather uncomfortable. It of course was a bit painful but all was well once I got in the mood. You need to make sure you are actually aroused because it causes you to become lubricated, thus making the penetration less painful. That's all I can really say. Just have fun, and be comfortable with yourself because if you are not mentally involved the entire experience might be more awkward for you than pleasureable.|`|dGB7leenaa	it will hurt the first coupl times   especially if you cant even use tampons  keep in mind a penis is bigger than a tampon  =]|`|4cQSsDaZaa	it feels great just go along with what he does and you'll be fine|`|wWzO9xARaa	it hurts, for some girls it hurts a lot more than it does for others. It basically feels like there is something there that shouldn't be. But after the frist few times it gets so much better and feels really good.|`|F5gtYbDVaa	bad in the beginning.  heaven afterwards.  :o|`|5vT3UDYaaa	Get plenty of lube because it hurts and its really not that great unless the guy's on the smaller side, if he's bigger, it will def, hurt and you'll be sore after. If he's a virgin too it prob wont be that great because both of you are inexperienced..It kinda feels like putting in a tampon but not really because tampons are dry and hard.

If it's another woman, I think it's very tacky and rubbing her nose in the fact you were out with someone else.

A: Well you could be if you worked half as much as my Momma and you ain't my momma! Get ghetto on them and embarrass them in public! Bet they will knock it off.    And when they say they are offended by your comment THROW IT BACK at them and say now you know how I feel when you make your snide comments to me.|`|DcVoq5Tuaa	tell them that you are just admiring it not asking them to buy it. Tell them you have a right to admire anything and everything and comment on it but it doesn't mean you are asking for it.
4HohViMbaa	I might have an answer for you. It's called empathy and bonds. You and your friend have formed a bond that is amazingly powerful. The strength of bonds like that is impossibly strong, trust me. You both like similar things and do similar things, like the same movies and boys, all those things. It could be that you and her have formed a bond similar to those formed by family, like sisters. The empathy is importent in a bond like that. She likes your family, and she can feel your pain from a distance by looking at you at a distance. These sort of people, I find interseting. I knew a girl like that back in primary school. She was cute and we had birthdays around the same time. But she had an amazing level of empthy within her, and we became best friends. I think we liked each other, like had a crush on each other, and she knew I liked her and she returned the feelings. I protected her once at the cost of my own psycological and physical health, attacking a boy three years older than me who was harrassing her, with pure rage and anger. I had an uncontrollable anger at the time. I won, but I was bruised and bloody and was destroyed mentally. I ran away, siting by a soccer goal. And do you know what the girl in question did? She walked over, wrapped me in a hug, and kissed me on the cheek. That sort of thing between 10-year-olds is rare. I feel you have a similar bond with this girl as I did with the one I knew. Who knows, If you live in Mornington, Australia, it could be the same one....|`|I8Wzd4h0aa	if she hangs out with you alot she will grow more attached and pick up somethings you do like if you say come alot shes start sayingg it   hope i helped  lots of love  - l a u r a ; x o
OWp5ndOmaa	im 14 and i have this, but not with a friend lol. we were friends and then he told me he liked me and that i like him then he left me alone, and now he wont even talk to me. different to your story but it along the same lines. I think he likes you but it seems he mite need some space. ur doing the right thing being mates but dont get too pushy and obsessed with him, stay reli good friends, go the cinema...town and have fun. then he'll get to  know you and he'll get to no u more and might see you more then a friend... who nos what will happen. just take life slow, don't rush into things! Have fun why it lasts and never put a boy before your friend coz there the most important. Good luck for the future x    actually its just like me coz my friend, whos 14 fancies him aswell but we sed we wouldnt talk to him coz he bin a jerk...but i cnt resist x|`|C8DOT8Y7aa	Hm to much writing but I read some and it sounds like you.|`|b9qRAcbIaa	HAHAHAHAHAHAH    jo is a playaa    lmao    um, i think that you should carry on being friends with him, maybe flirt with him abit so he kinda gets the feeling you like him, so if he likes you back he might ask you out then, and if he doesnt like you, its not like you've TOLD him that you fancy him, so it would be ok :)|`|G2ay40UOaa	he's a playaa :(  sorry but thats what   it sounds like,   so get rid of him;)
uOVepBl8aa	Wow that popular guy seems like a real douche!! gosh    I think you could try smiling alot. people tend to be more receptive to people who smile :). Also, what do the people at your scholl dress like, adn what do you dress like? If you look like a bum then chances are that not many people will want to talk to you.    You could also try wearing a little makeup, just so you can look a little more attractive, as shallow as it may be, generally people will gravitate to the pretty people in life. Don't over do the makeup though ( if you choose to wear any), like, you can wear a little coloured eyeliner (check sephora's flashy waterproof eyeliner line) and some nice clear lipgloss (like good ole' lipsmackers :) ) or dab on a little colour so your lips get a tint. If you have bad skin then invest in an scne treatment (try Proactive, Murad or neutrogena skin ID). If you wear too much makeup already, then maybe people will think that you're really fake and trampy, so you'd want to tone it done a bit. Anyway look into your appearance and maybe people will treat you better, just dont do too much at one time or people will say that you're trying to change because of what that popular guy said.    If you try too hard to talk to the 'popular' people then they probably notice and talk about you behind your back (darn hypocrites). if you try to flirt with guys too much then they'd probably hate that too. If your always too perky then people would probably get annoyed so you might want to mellow out a bit.    If you dont go out alot then thats probably another huge reason why they treat you weird. However if you do choose to go out, don't force youself on anybody or they'll just think your even bigger of a loser D: and try not to change yourself to suit anyone, it only ends up amking you feel like your lieing to yourself and it really takes its toll, messes you up as a person. If you plan to change then make sure its for the better, like being more funny, or being nicer, more outgoing or friendly or smiling more.    Another thing is that if you change a little and these popular people start to talk to you , NEVER ditch your 3 best friends. even though it may seem like thats the most impossible thing in the universe, it can happen if you get sucked into the whole "party scene" and "popular" world. if these new popular kids start befriending you and want you to ditch you best friends, dont do it, its not worth it!     (sorry its so long) Hope I helped. :)|`|i4qaYAOaaa	never change who you are so people will be your friend. i promise those people you in school will not matter to you in a few years. what will matter is that you are you and that you don't change for anyone.  you will be much happier in the long run if you stay true to yourself. anyone who takes the time to put someone down like that is not worth you worrying about, they will get their karma.|`|I8Wzd4h0aa	well you could try talking to more people and smilingg butt not like freakishly like this :D like this :] it will make people feel comforted !  hope i help  lots of love ;   - l a u r a ; x o|`|0sPQnq7oaa	Don't look at the ground when you walk- people are more inclined to bump into you...and walk all over you in general. Doing this will show people you have confidence. Make eye contact more too. Don't kiss their asses, but if you really give a **** you can always say "Hey, thats a really nice sweater you've got on. Did it cost you a lot? I bet daddy lets you use his credit card whenever you want!"    No, seriously. **** those people that say you aren't likable.    I mean, if you really wanna fit in you have to study how the "popular" people are, and sort of mimic their actions. Or something. Don't copy them- they'll know and think you're a tool. Just sorta start shopping at similar stores, or I dunno, talk honestly about your hobbies and stuff.   Whatever.|`|qaD2OqY3aa	Whoa... back up honey!    You are 14y/o. We've all been in that place, and I can actually relate to the story you're telling me. Obviously somebody DOES like you - you have your 3 Best Friends. High School changes - you have your ups, and your downs.     Do not change yourself to please others! There is never a reason for that! If you want to "seem" more friendly, walk down the hallways with a smile on your face, even if your going to your least fav. class. Smiles are contagious. And so are frowns.     Take care of yourself girly.|`|xvCvd5xhaa	I think you shouldn't change who you are just to impress someone. If they already said that no one likes you then you shouldn't be friends with them. But if you want to change yourself to become popular or learn what to do, maybe you should change how you dress to fit in, or the way you do your hair and make up to fit in, and to make yourself feel better, and it will build up your self esteem more. But I wouldn't change anything if you don't feel comfortable about changing just to impress one person, oh hell no. Do what's right for you, and be happy. Good luck.

Meet in a public area.|`|NuUdCz0Laa	It really depends on what the conversations have been up to this point and the reason for the meeting.  If they have been sexual in content then I would expect that is the driving force to meet you.  So save him the hassle and rent a motel room and be waiting for him.  If this is just a friend meeting for tea, then that is totally different.  Good luck.|`|AA11603468	bad idea...|`|FBhjhjR0aa	HA HA.... Funny thing is, it's really your husband! He's been spying on you and set you up. Man I wish I could see the look on your face, when you get all ready to meet this 'man', and see that it's your husband instead.      P.s he has divorce papers for you, so when you meet up that's what he's going to give you! HHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAH|`|oojO4WAraa	Yes, you should be nervous.

They can be a crazy rapist murderer.|`|qpAYU8Knaa	No. It should be safe. After all you know him on-line. Why should you be nervous?

LOL  Driving from Kansas? Wow? Making an effort for a first DATE  Friendly? LOL that is funny. There is nothing friendly about this meeting.  Especially with the "had to insert here part",     Just divorce your husband and go play the single life.|`|5MAx8mHxaa	you can think about that when your tied up in his trunk.Will he bury you in Kansas or somewhere else?|`|7e0356e9b4ce8ac13f39c23ba748f638aa	Madam, you are REALLY, REALLY stupid.    For all you know, your "hook up" is an ex-con out on parole.  He could have an STD, HIV, AIDS, Herpes, etc.    You need to find happiness and contentment within yourself.  Because you won't find it with another man's penis.|`|8758df9720f7d094342fbcef3c91a629aa	Be nervous, be very nervous because it is apparent that you and maybe even your on-line contact want something to happen.  BTW, does your husband have access to your email account?|`|RvND5eNfaa	You are married for goodness sake. You may not give a **** about his wife but what about your husband. You don't know for sure who your going to be meeting.Your taking a big risk.   On the other hand if you were both single and you checked him out and knew what he was telling you was legitimate then that's fine but meet in a public place to be on the safe side.  You have already said one thing might lead to another so you know what your intentions are so why do you continue in your relationship with your husband??
l16AnWclaa	tell him before its tooooo late:/...
Ou6CnTi0aa	only time will tell if she wants to be with you or not. be nice to her but do not come on to strong keep your options open and maybe someday you could try again. Try not to feel bad about the break up it probably wasn't your fault.|`|U1e7wJgYaa	GET ANOTHER GIRL SHES NOT INTRESTED IN YOU

4HoVVCenaa	It comes naturally. But being good at it is a skill, perhaps an art form. Being able to please AND be please takes experience, knowledge, and practice. When you are ready, books help a lot. Videos however, are not good because they give you a sense of inferiority, which will not be deserved, and the are very artificial, unless instructional videos.
VLgDxUJQaa	Honey you have to learn some how, and wouldnt u rather learn together instead of feeling the pressure of dating someone more experienced,, it will come naturally|`|YyMFDs6Eaa	yeah same here, but we're not "official" yet|`|hvZb0r3zaa	Shouldn't be. You'll figure it out. Its a natural thing ;)|`|Elaimr9qaa	don't rush into anything. first step is the simple kiss. but HE has to make the first move on the first date. good luck x
Zta4vVqjaa	1st of all, you make the first move. He's not shy because he told you that he likes you and that takes a lot! Um... My advice is you start the conversation but do it after school because then you guys can both talk with  out ur teacher yelling at you two to be quiet. If you like him tell him that you like him because that will give him the feeling that he shouldn't have regretted telling you that he likes you. Just be yourself around him. Don't ask him a lot of questions because then they will feel like your interviewing him. Not many guys like that. But just ask like yourself and play it cool. Since he likes you after you tell him that you like him give him a hug or kiss and he'll feel relieved that he told you and that now you both can maybe start something if you want to. That's all! Hope I could help!|`|tRoxSuMzaa	Hi there in my oppinion u shouldnt put anymore effort, ignore him for awhile make as if he never exsisted. Stay with ur friends and dont go to him. Ul see just by doin this it will drive him crazy which will ultimately make him want u more. And he will soon be running after u trying to talk to u.|`|0sw9nrcpaa	i feel sorry for u and him, he probably does like u but hes just really embarrased by talking to u thinking hell mess up|`|nO2vflnPaa	Maybe he's just not that into you.|`|Na3C1sPtaa	he is probably just really shy, do something talk about stuff at school and try making him more out going, if you can|`|TofmqjUaaa	HE is DEFINTITELY into you.... he's just shy. If you like him then say something like: "are you asking me out?" You should try to start the conversation.|`|CPxLHfKoaa	Your plan is good and you seem like a good person. He is most likely shy and most guys are. they just need that one girl to show them that theres nothing to be shy about. You can be this girl so just keep doing what your doing.|`|hvZb0r3zaa	Text him. Sounds like he is shy and can talk better through text or over the computer. Try that for a couple of days and maybe he will be comfortable enough to talk to you on the phone or in person.|`|imbcdRvXaa	hes really shy|`|Tc1BO5kkaa	wow. you may be over analyzing it... give him space?|`|N2KNgB93aa	Maybe he is embarrassed and regrets giving away his secret. Try giving him some time and space and see how things work out.|`|8ecApR9iaa	Looks like a good movie Tonya|`|oeZodAyeaa	Sounds like he's shy to me. What you should do is go up to him and try to talk, if he doesn't, make him, let him know that if he likes u as much as he says he does, you guys gotta talk about it. Be assertive, guys need to be provoked to talk about their feelings, it just doesn't come naturally to most.|`|uWqoJK71aa	i told a girl i liked her and then she smiled really big and said awww how cute! and then the next week came and we acted like nothing ever happened.    i was really shy and my heart was beating fast plus i told her in person so that made it worse.    but yea id say he is shy maybe too shy but if you like him back you just got to make him know that cause right now he probably feels like an idiot like i did.    just say you dont have to be embarrassed cause most guys dont have the balls to say that!|`|sZoYD6Hfaa	girly, don't stress much over this dude.

Don't give the dumb azz any motives to come in between you and your niece, just be there for her the best you can as you are doing now.

YqsND3Wmaa	I got the feeling he was seeing someone else when I read your question. When I read the additional details, I knew.  And he's been away two days and still is "not sure"?  Let him go.  Tell him to take all the time he needs to "figure it out".  In the meantime, have fun, try to be positive, and it would be good if he somehow saw you doing something innocent like eating ice cream with another guy.      Good luck.
sZZ90ZOyaa	Aww!   It's hard liking someone online especially if there is a huge distance between you both.   Don't let him ruin your A levels. Don't go on MSN for a while and it will get better.  It's not very healthy growing an obsession over someone online the only way to g et over him is to stop talking to him for a while.  You could always ask him how he feels about you.  He might be completely different off the internet alot of people are.   It does get better in time :)|`|mtV7dWJHaa	Did that myself once and felt the same way.

dL4YY0E5aa	Ok, if you're young enough that you're mom thinks you don't need a boyfriend; then listen. Us moms, maybe not the coolest all of the time, but we have been there. WE have even wrote some of the rules...LOL     I know that you have that feeling where you tingle every time you see him and when he talks to you... WOW, you can't even explain the feelings. But it will pass. I honestly can say, that I have had so many crushes and loves. And I truly loved them all. But people come and go for whatever the time, place, reason and or season. If they come back then they were meant to be in your life.     Good Luck.|`|xgJbxZgfaa	sorry to hear about that, but it's probably just puppy love right now, if he really likes you, he'll stick around, if not, then move on.. plenty of fish in the sea. he doesn't sound like he loves you b/c he doesn't even know if he wants u or not.
sLLgERQWaa	YES YES YES!!!!!    I've been saying this for as long as I've been on Yahoo Answers......  I just don't get these fake weddings....dressing up and playing bride just for the sake of wearing the dress....I've yet to be invited to a faux or re-do wedding.. knowingly,If I ever am I will decline politely...they are already married so why am I going to see a fake wedding?    In 1973 I attended a wedding on my ex's side..then 2 weeks later all the guests found out the couple had already been married for 8 wks...a civil ceremony, because they just couldn't wait for the DAY, but still wanted all the fluff.....no one except their parents knew...    Boy, talk about a bunch of pissed off people...they thought they were witness to the real wedding and they weren't..they felt deceived and duped....I thought it was one of the stupidest things going....it rendered the wedding as something trivial, not sacred, and reduces it to the status of a prom or birthday party.    Tell, me..if you never ever had a sweet 16 BD party can you have one when you're 21? Can you re-do a prom in your 30's? Don't like Uncle Ernie's original wake? Dig him up and re-do it...your child's birth experience not what you planned/dreamed of? Stuff the kid back inside & have a re-do birth...    Some things are a once in a life time deal...weddings are just that..it's NOT the party and the fripperies, it's when you actually exchange your vows-THAT is your wedding in what ever shape it takes...if circumstances prevent you from having your white wedding, then okay, have a fancy anniversary party...but please, you CAN'T be a bride if you are already a wife...and let's pretend denegrates the marriage ceremony....such a shame it's even permitted by churches..oh well, it's an easy buck.|`|58f00eb827abff12eac8ed561f2ced1aaa	I've seen a lot of this kind of thing also. Personally, I agree with you. You're married now and should be happy with that. Vow renewals are wonderful, after several years of marriage. BUT to answer your question and leave my opinion out of it:   Married women who want to have the big re-do do it because they feel as if they have missed out on the big day. Something unforseen happened and caused them to decide to get married in a small ceremony and a few years later, they have regrets about missing out on the fairy tale dress, the veil, the whole thing. I guess to them, its like waking up one day when you're 50 and not remembering how much fun it was to be 20! I think that they feel cheated out of the experience and want to have the re-do to live that day that they missed. maybe to them, its like adoption. Yes, you have kids, but you never had that wonderful moment of "oh, Im pregnant!" or the experience of labor. Life is to live in the moment and to have memories and when something like military leave, pregnancy or finances comes in the middle of "the big day" you have to hurry up and you miss out on "smelling the roses" so to speak. Those of us who are happy with our wedding day dont understand and yes, we can be rude about it. I guess what we all have to understand is, to each his own and hey, it's the bride's day, let her do what she wants, its not hurting us!|`|yCR6qg0baa	Agreed! Someone earlier asked a question and said she wants to secretly  elope in May and then still have her parents pay for a huge wedding next year. I just think that is so selfish... And if your family is paying for a wedding, they deserve to see you take your vows (the real deal), give you away, etc. I also agree with you that your wedding is a milestone day b/c it's the beginning of a lifelong marriage, not just a chance to wear a pretty dress and hold expensive flowers. People make such a charade of it anymore.|`|FlgkZOFOaa	i agree  i think a small wedding with people important to my husband and me was more important than a big wedding--that said we had a traditional church wedding with about 60 people present...although i'd like to renew my vows with him in vegas or something fun--just th etwo of us, tho...|`|6d718b2ca0424bba8e88fd0bd7a40273aa	It's ingrained in our heads. Hahah. No, seriously. I am happy to go to the court house b/c all of the ceremony with the wedding day I'm not really feeling. I wasn't going to have a flower girl, bridesmaid or any of that stuff, and I wasn't looking forward to finding an expensive wedding dress anyway so it all fit, but it's hard to get over not "walking down the aisle" it's weird really.     I see so many happy couples who were married in a Minister's church office or by the JoP in the courthouse but it's there in the back of your brain nagging you. It's all of those wedding shows I'm watching. Lol. I'm doing the JoP thing and I'm not going to do the "big" ceremony later. I want the reception to be big and fun. I want our marriage to last forever the wedding thing, not such a big deal. I think there's a fun spirit to just going down to the JoP and doing it right away. But, I do think it depends on that person and won't way them down. I only relented to have the JoP because he does vows as well and that was important to me.     Personally, I wanted to know that our union is supported by God and that prayers were said to protect us.  That was the big reason I wanted to have an officiant. So for some they may want that big moment and to share their ceremony with more people and family as well as have a religious angle.|`|a3422bad6666b60894e80bace0f14387aa	Some people don't see marriage as a sacred, one-time event. They think you can "legally" be married and still have a "wedding" - which is false, once you're married, you're married! I have no idea why some people would think marriage is "just a legality" and the big "wedding" makes it "real". Those people are the type who ensure the divorce rate stays high lol... Marriage is about the union between a man and a woman. The reception is just a party to celebrate that. If people take getting married so lightly they think get to do it twice, I worry about the future generations. I am with you. You get one wedding and you should be so excited about the marriage that it doesn't matter where or when you do it. My fiance and I decided what type of weddng we could afford and that's what we had. If someone can't affor di t"right now" but wants it "later", they either need to wait until they can afford it or take what they can afford now and be happy. It's insane to think you're "entitled" to lie to your family for the sake of insurance, txes, whatever...    Good question!
ej8iwJzqaa	ok, so you're a young girl & hes an older boy..noticed i used the term boy.. no big deal- do you have anytthing in common with him? how long have you known him? is he a good guy, or a p o s?? you need to sit down wih him and have a realistic, logical convo. with him about the 2 of you..now, you do understand that after graduation, he will probably go away to school.. are you prepared for that??|`|t8gWcBaeaa	4 year difference.  the age doesnt matter nyway.  it wont work out. hes a senior, ur a freshmen. think about it.  hes guna go off to college n do his things.  ur stil guna b in high school.  drop it sry.|`|oL7ah2Fhaa	hhmmm it might be a bad idea. he could just be using you. be very careful. maybe its better for you to date a sophomore or even another freshman. senior guys can be real jackasses....    unless he's not that type of guy...just be very careful around him. you may end up in big trouble.|`|PPKuHl9baa	Well, it's ok for now I guess but a little weird. However, next year he'll be a high school graduate and you'll be a sophmore. THAT is going to be weird. I'd say stay in your own grade +/- (1).|`|eFxN59SXaa	it's not really wrong, it's just one of those things that has always been around..seniors usually don't date freshmen. but if you really like him i would go for it and break tradition!|`|GZ9iMWr8aa	yah it is a big age difference, especially when it comes to maturity levels. also its illegal in some states|`|YLFKj0m9aa	Yeah, why not? Its not that big of an age difference.|`|AA10848249	As long as your parents are ok with you dating someone a little older than you than it shouldn't be a problem.|`|mTUQSlcpaa	It's nothing more than a crush for either of you . There is too much of an age gap is what he's saying , what he's not saying is that your a minor and he could get into trouble if he pursues you in any manner. He is right you should be dating someone your own age , you'll have more in common.

I know this can be addicting, but its fun...  When/If you get back on, look me up, if you want.  Have a good hiatus and I hope your life goes as you plan it to go.  Also, I wish you the best of health.|`|vAR22hz4aa	can i have best answer?|`|AA10495394	Just because you are taking a break from dating doesn't mean u have to leave us. I like to think of Yahoo answers as friends that will be honest with you and help you get though anything now matter what. If you do leave take care and get back out dating at some point because you don't want to take to long of a break brother.
ojNHRsj7aa	of course. some girls dont care abvout looks. they care about whats on the inside. they want a sweet guy who shows that they care.    a girl who is wya too into looks is the girl you dont want to be with|`|aO79RetYaa	smart girl will judge boys considering his brain as a parameter and not looks!!!!!!!!!!    they are not cheap minded like boys......|`|xAoE9P5Maa	usually skinny girls like  to date a skinny or athletic guy. But if they are your good friends and they really like you then they will see beyond your chubby outside and see the great person they've always known on the inside.|`|skkOXxQEaa	to some girls size matters. but them girls don't know that they may be missing out on the best thing that ever happened to them. the girls that choose a man by personality will be the truly happy ones. you should always be confident and not think down on yourself. women like confident men.|`|3lIAjgROaa	i think that unshallow girls will like you for who you are and definatly not base weather or not they go out with you by ur looks|`|4ccwsEryaa	To me personality comes first and looks are like the last thing that matters. So chubby or skinny you should have a good personality.
ltw7Xg6Xaa	haha well uhm im 18 and if im not with the bf, its a regular thing for me :)   not ashamed to say so at all, it helps me fall asleep when done at night surprisingly enough!|`|Js3qsee2aa	twice a month my girl friend do|`|4qT0TfMZaa	As often as needed - and no, little boy, we won't let you watch!|`|71VRvldJaa	That depends entirely on the girl and what their needs are|`|cYRZpGkqaa	i am 20 and i never masturbate. i have sex.|`|WLWojBO4aa	they wont tell you but prolly around every 10 min, ever hear a vibrating noise while talking to a girl, yup its not a phone.|`|iVnQ4aCiaa	3-5 times a week.|`|gZKCKO8gaa	way less than guys!!!!
ebac2c8416ceff0f61cd9f8cf423826faa	just make a comment on something random  like go to the library and look at a book some girl picked up and say something like, "Oh! i just read that book! it's really good!"     spontaneous is the best! just go up to them and say, "Hey! I'm _____. What's up?"     so just be yourself and all will work out. :)           will you answer mine please?|`|WFP46Ek9aa	email me  rustygirl_90210@yahoo.com  p.s. add your y/a name!|`|Gp4AP971aa	a GOOD pickup line?  hmm..just start a conversation..like if she's in a library finding some books/readin something..start talking to her about the book in her hand  Do stuff like that it's cute.
OIiwMWEVaa	I think the best thing to do now is to watch over her, not stalking, watching over her. When she's going somewhere alone, go quietly along, and make sure she doesn't do something stupid. Another way is to talk to her, make her feel how important she is to everyone around her and how she shouldn't just throw her life away easily. I really hope everything turns out right! Good Luck, and hopfully  you get to express your feelings to her!|`|828e8681c299a009930f6174f5138b49aa	Honestly, I don't think talking to her will snap her out of her suicidal thoughts - please be swift and tell her mom (if her mom is an emotionally-stable & caring person, not if she is distraught b/c of her husband's infidelity) - also tell your school's guidance counselors - they'll get her the help she needs.    Would you rather your friend be alive and mad at you for getting her help rather than dead & having done nothing?    Check your conscience and go with it.|`|mdtkor2Paa	go to school counselor|`|qe0RNp7xaa	Go to your school counselor.|`|lEWuugaFaa	Next time you see her, give her a great big hug and take her some where fun to loosen tension  Don't be afraid to bring up the topic.  In fact you should so that you can help her figure it out|`|LHjnWCfnaa	tell her people always go through hard situations. it's a part of life, but they always find a way to make it through. explain to her that so many people care about her and she needs to think about how it would affect them if she did something to herself. to want to commit suicide is being selfish. people like that never seem to think about others. ...if it comes to that point, go tell a counselor so she can get help. i had to do that with my friend one time. ..she hated me for awhile, but she still talked to me and she actually appreciates what i did for her.|`|bgbUQ3Wnaa	I'm so so so glad you're thinking of your friend. Please, please, please tell her parents or your parents ASAP and don'tl et her do it. Support her. I'm not kidding, you HAVE to tell your folks or her folks seriously right now, if not then she could commit suicide. Hurry and save her life, tell an adult you trust. ): good luck!!|`|8AaPQONGaa	D:|`|qMhLcn8Gaa	Tell her to "do it fgt"

Obviously if it is frightens you you should stop it now.  However, if you do enjoy it, there really isn't anything wrong (and I know people are going to get pissed at this), but you are both consenting adults.  Older men have more experience and better technique.  Maybe the fact that he knows his way around a woman's body is intriguing to you.  Lets be honest, 19 year olds maybe nice to look at but most of them suck in the sack.  But the good news is there is always time to learn.  Just enjoy the experience (and be SAFE!), don't read too much into it. Have fun. : )|`|wF8tea9Daa	Eh, it's normal!  You are 19 and it's the thrill of something new and exciting so you can't get enough of it!  It sounds like you are both enjoying each other, you're both adults so just have fun.  I would be careful though, your father will probably flip out if (when) he finds out you and his friend are shagging.lol.|`|IfCOvnA1aa	eww thats gross gurl.get away from him|`|pujlEZuqaa	Sounds like you like it rough. He didnt take control of you, you are letting it happen. Kinda sound like a slut to me too.|`|k1wAbgiHaa	If you are okay with it.. keep doing it    SteveC|`|xDlBM6N6aa	Um, that's plain sick!  Your father's friend that is 34 years older than you, and you want to do sexual things with him.  He's a pervert.  I'm 19 like you are, and would never let that happen.|`|JT4OkvFeaa	Well, you are 19 years old.  You can make the decision to stay with him or leave him.  Age is not really a factor since you both are old enough.     If you don't like the situation, then just break the relationship off.  If you enjoy the sex, then just keep going.     If the guy is married, you need to break it off.

a45c2cc73915d245be2735d9c1260381aa	There are way to many signs to just have one clear one because guys show how they feel in many different ways...    *How to tell if he likes you  (and if he's flirting with you in his special own guy-way).    A lot depends on the type of guy and his individual personality.    Shy Guys  These are tough to crack sometimes...  *He'll look at you, until you turn around, then boom, he's looking the other way.  You may 'feel' like he's watching you - but he's hard to catch at it    * He may do something physical - like grab you in a play way, poke you, play with your hair...  (Remember when you were really young and the guy you liked punched you or tackled you?)    *He may be working really hard to pay attention to you, but doesn't quite know how...    *He may ask a friend of yours about you - he'll say it's just for "friend of mine" that wants to know about you.    *He talks to everybody else - but when you're around he turns silent, or chokes up.  You seem to accidentally bump into him a lot of different places.    *He may not say a word to you, but he shows up in the same line, at the same movie, etc.    *He'll give you a little smile from across the room, but if you get near, he won't look up.  Basically - the BIG clue is that his behavior changes when you're around (compared to when he's around his buds or other girls).  DEAD Giveaway - when you talk to him he turns red.  (Bingo - you can pack that puppy up and take him home...)    These are some of the more subtle clues - keep your eyes open - you may have more guys flirting with you than you realize!!!    *He remembers little things you mention in casual conversation.  It may take you by surprise. You might have been talking when he was around and two weeks later he'll say, "Well, your favorite food is pasta..."    *His voice changes when he talks to you in a group. He may say "Hey." to everyone with you, but the "Hey." to you is a little different.    *His voice gets softer when the two of you talk.    Sometimes he stares straight into your eyes.    *His eyes get 'soft' when he looks at you. They change slightly or get relaxed around the edges. It's subtle, but you can tell if you watch...  (You may already be aware of it at a subconscious level - that's what made you start wondering if he likes you...)    When he's near you or talking with you, his eyes travel in a little circle around your face and land back on your eyes. (Like he's looking at your whole face - then back to your eyes.)    *He watches your lips. (Dead give away.)    *His friends start asking you questions - if you haven't met him yet - they may ask what your name is. Or may ask you what you think about 'him.'    If his friends are paying attention to you after he's been staring at you - it can mean that he's been talking about you.    *He tells you that you smell nice...  (No hidden meaning here - it's a good thing.)    *He might act weird around you or seem very nervous. His behavior may just plain change when you're around.  If he's normally quiet, he may get louder, or vice versa. It's the difference in behavior that's the clue.    If you ever need anything else feel free to email me @: godsbaby42@yahoo.com    *Much Love* ~God Bless~|`|i6WVPncnaa	One way to know that he likes you is if he starts flirting with you.

People just dont make sence. I cared about her so much I dont feel I could love enyone else ever again , but I try to keep my chin up and I know life will get better as I know it will for you to.

Boys are weird.  You do need to talk to him, and also figure why he did that on msn.  Because that's could mean that he was scared or sad to do it, which I'm sure he was.    :]|`|G1C5D0xAaa	wow.thats really gay of him.i just wana say that i thinkk its becuase hes feeling simpathyy for you...an to make you feel better he said i love you..but thats just my thery.find out the truth though.ask him.i hope i helped:]] but im bad at thiss.lol.|`|6OTpmNeVaa	Don't worry about it boys are just dumb a**holz!

Do you see what im saying! Or maybe if her parents find out!|`|F3jTjyBhaa	It's completely understandable that you two want to take the next step after dating for 7 years. If you're afraid of the law, don't be. It is illegal for two people under the age of 18 to engage in sexual intercourse, but unless you're telling the world that you guys are "doing it" there's not much that anyone can do about it. And it's only statutory rape if you're over 18 and she's under 18.    So if it's what you both want, by all means. Just be safe about it. :]|`|9gvxaYyNaa	and your question is?|`|Bd7Qfjggaa	hey you yes you..i hv to tell u something on it so if u r reading this msg thn stop reading it otherwise u r monkey..stupid monkey still reading ma msg..get lost go gooo away...if one more time u read a single work u r d basturd..stop it....foolish person stop reading it..no dont ever try reading it..ok..thnx for reading it :|`|3VxmsXWoaa	what's your question?|`|WiQQUNQLaa	wow awwwh thats so cutee talk to her about it and make it romantiicc and stuff aww thats so cutee|`|CUc2gqzjaa	well if you want to do it then do that, but dont tick off her parents, they could bring the law into it.
c5UAa65qaa	You're right; you can't interfere in their relationship by telling her boyfriend.  You can express disapproval and question whether she's really ready for marriage, though.  (Chances are it's going to wreck the friendship, but it doesn't sound like you'd necessarily mind that.)|`|vsSuEtG1aa	She is testing the waters.  She has the right to do that if her bf hasn't gotten around to making a bigger commitment.  She is your friend so if you want to keep her as one, I certainly wouldn't tell her bf.  That's her business.  My problem with her would be that she doesn't have enough self-respect to at least not let everybody in the wedding party know the way she was acting, therefore leading me to question why I was her friend in the first place.|`|f6YsGOynaa	Stay out of it.  What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas.  She's not married to this guy, so stop being so judgmental.  If you want to bring it up with her, just flat out ask her, "Ok.. so let me get this straight.  You had a fling in Vegas but now you're talking about marriage?  Are you sure this is what you want to do?"  and leave it at that.      Then butt out, and if her behavior continues to bother you, stop hanging out with her.|`|uJ9waJDYaa	Hm, if you think if you bring it up with her at all she will go crazy on you and you don't want to hurt any friendships then just let it go and hope the best for them and that it works out, but if you don't mind seeing a good or bad reaction and think you can talk your way out if needed, then if i were you id drop a hint like.  well are you ready for marriage? do you think he's the one, or is he the only man you can see spending the rest of your life with?  Id just sort of ask little things like that, and see what she says,  then if she gets shi.tty and is like why the heck wud u ask me that or something just say, sorry wasn't trying to offend but something it helps people see their future more clearly once they have asked and answered those questions.  That's what id do and seems pretty good to me.  But you can do what ever you want. good luck|`|2f2338425d995c6d00e32cb38d57ee7faa	I wouldn't say anything to her. Face it - you have no idea what kind of relationship arrangement she has with her boyfriend. Perhaps they have an open relationship, and it's their personal business, and theirs only. If "a lot of people know", it will surface sooner or later, without you meddling. Seems to me that if she's not being very discreet about it, perhaps she and her b/f have an agreement as to their expectations of each other. Open relationships and marriages are much more common than you think.
CBSNsk1gaa	Your not being 'just stupid'. You are concerned and that is totally normal. So you hung out on Friday, were supposed to meet up on Sunday, but he called sick, and then called sick again on Monday. I'm being optimistic here, and hoping for you that he is just sick, because to have gone off you after you had a good time together would be sad, but does happen with some guys... I say wait till tomorrow or Friday to call/text him again, if you've not done either yet today. If you have then wait a bit longer to give him space. If he does not make contact by next Tuesday then you are allowed to confront him, though gently just in case he is sick.  Best wishes and good luck!|`|U9vE47hdaa	a bit of both maybe.|`|qpAYU8Knaa	He will contact you when he feels better. Stop crowding him or he will think that you are desperate.|`|kItRaRmlaa	yes ur|`|uVH046Fjaa	No need to read the paragraph. Yes.|`|caArlzCvaa	well give him a couple of days for him to get better. and if it seems like excuses i think you should pass.|`|JEqt3dDRaa	give him a chance to get over food poinesning...that stuff is REALLY bad!   when he says he is over it...keep an eye on how much you talk, that will telll you something.    otherwise he is just wayyy too sick to talk right now! [unless u want to talk to him while he is pukeing his fricken guts out!]|`|CEKAqtB1aa	Well if he's ill give him time to recover. When he's better then see what happens.|`|OQqAlHL8aa	He's sick, you're being to neurotic.|`|lTOeMNnraa	yeah i think your just being stupid about it. i mean you said he's really ill|`|KmNAewUQaa	ask him, you never know until you are straightforward. don't worry just yet.|`|Gza8jaboaa	Hes probably just sick dont worry im sure he didnt forget about you hes just making sure he gets better (:|`|cOJVE9Wlaa	your being stupid, call him. x|`|W618lfZ6aa	You are over analyzing, my magic time is a week, if he doesn't contact you within that, no good.|`|8osdb6poaa	Be patient. Did your text require a response? If not then don't worry.   Feel free to send him 1 more text saying you hope he feels better & wait for him to get in touch with you, it may have been a bug instead of food poisoning so he might be worse than Sunday.|`|ozmRtpMyaa	he's probs just still sick.  don't call him for a couple days and check up on him later.|`|hyY5t2JKaa	juss fall back and if he wants it he will come get it. I was kindain a similar situation and u juss made me realize I was totally the girl which is sad lol!!!!|`|eFxN59SXaa	even if he's ill, his fingers aren't broke and could text you|`|O1GgnmgOaa	give it some time a couple more days see if he calls u more or not....pretty much if he doesnt call or text theres 2 reasons one he might really be sick or 2 he came up with an excuse to stop talking to u...youll be ok im 21 been there and seen that|`|06de8f8bd2139814a2ba53ab67d9d65daa	if i were you i''d give it till friday to start worrying, text him again friday.. if still nothing leave it till about midweek next week if you STILL havent heard from him, then perhaps its likely he doesn't like you ):  or maybe he found someone else..    good luck though (:  X|`|mTUQSlcpaa	He may just be busy and /or sick.  He may have  just lost interest. Just put your focuses elsewhere if the relationships  to be it will be. If not you won't notice. It will just be his lost.

B1sT1t44aa	Behind every good wife stands a good man that gives you the respect to be the best you can be because he has good morals and believes in his commitment to the woman that he loves and that loves him. We are living in a day and age of disposable marriages because times have changed from the days of our grandmothers. More women today have to work outside of the home due to the financial problems in our economy just to make ends meet. Men and woman are more exposed to each other in the work force and can be tempted to connect more than ever even though they are married to others. A woman that is fortunate enough to be able to stay home and tend to the family can only structure their environment to the best of her ability and make the home his castle a place where he wants to be. The most important thing is keeping the lines of communication open and making quality time together and never forgetting the two people that first fell in love. If a woman and a man through their dating ever thought to empress one another then they both need to remember to continue on doing that to keep interests alive. It is knowing how to give each other space then knowing when it is time to pull together. Being a good wife is only in the extension of her having a good husband because two people only get what they give in having a good relationship.A woman can lead her family through the bad and the good when the support comes from her better half in helping her carry it. There are some women out there that give a man their all but if he has issues and his own way of looking at and doing things you have nothing to compromise with.|`|4956eb69e2632956570e130278b4d855aa	My definition of a good wife is the same as for a good husband: mutual love and respect. A man has as much responsibility to care for his family as a woman does.|`|1tdOW2Pfaa	"concerned1"  Your answer made me cry......so sweet your kind words about your mother....    As far as the question, I too feel that a wife is the Heart of the Home, the Husband is the Head of the Home....My husband and I are practicing Traditional Roman Catholics, and our faith strengthens our marriage, and we follow God's plan for how marriage should be, and a Husband and Wife's role in it.    Good Question.|`|yd2SP7d6aa	Unfortunately women have started to unlearn the behaviors that made them the glue that holds marriages together as they embrace a more "male" attitude (ego, selfishness, recklessness etc.).      Women have always been more social than males (it's why you are better at communication, english etc.) and it is why scientists think married men live longer (we need women to give us a place / purpose).      The problem is that if women are changing to reflect more male oriented attitude (probably through the work force), who will be there to moderate our base impulses.  Think about it, kindness begets more kindness but if the one person who made us want to be better is now like us than what hope do we really have?    Women have always been the strong ones, I'm not sure why you have never recognized it.  As to what makes a good wife, one who is supportive (of children & husband), one who makes her husband a better man (instead of tearing him down), one who is caring / loving and being a goddess in bed isn't a bad addition :)    BTW, I'm not suggesting that women shouldn't have career's, are less intelligent, or not as capable.  However, they should be mindful that not every male attribute is a virtue or all feminists virtues are bad / undesireable (even in the work place).|`|ETHdEtPQaa	i love your question and i think women today are totally misguided. i work full time to pay for things that i had bought previous to my wedding. with that being said i talked to my husband and asked what he thought would make a good wife (i did this before marrying him) and he just said he wanted us to always be able to talk. so in addition to that i cook for him i make our bed and do the laundry. we have the same days off so we clean on those days so that i don't feel completely burdened. we read the same books and then discuss them. i say that you should ask your husband. i think a good wife has to be strong, consistent, loving, self sacrificing and really willing to do whatever it takes to keep her marriage together|`|UNZuciedaa	she has to leave the back door unlocked|`|HnWgVzDEaa	A Good woman takes CARE of her man and does irioning only if he appreciates it!  A good man takes CARE of his woman ...even if it means working on SUNDAYS!  Its all about loyalty in every sense of the word isn't it?|`|vsSuEtG1aa	I learned how to be a wife from my mother.  My father has been a terrible husbnad to my mother, but no matter what, she stood by him, she has never bad mouthed him to me or anybody else.  They have now been married to each other for 41 years and still going strong.  She has been patient, kind, and strong when she needed to be.  He loves her like crazy and would be lost without her.  I don't agree with the way she has always forgiven him and apologized for him and taken the crap she has off of him, but that's not my cross to bear, it's hers and I can honestly say she has done it with grace and I respect her and love her more and more for it every day.  She has always been my hero.  So...I try to take examples from her strength in her marriage and apply it to my own.  I have a son, not a daughter, but we instill life lessons in him everyday and are trying our best to mold him into a respectful young man who will be an awesome husband and father based on things we learned in our own homes growing up and the experiences we have encountered in our marriage.  I think your perception of women not teaching their daughters how to be good wives is not as widespread as you think. It still goes on and it always will.|`|tsBL19qzaa	Your first statement is flawed. Being a good wife doesn't imply that one loses their independence, nor their individuality. Being a good wife, like being a good husband, requires good communication, trust, respect, compromise and  being able to admit when you are wrong, without acting like a baby.   what you  declare in your first statement is only what you have in your mind as to what a good wife is.
Gl3zQNGWaa	Its sweet, romantic and beautiful-- duuh   And they like both the girl and the view :)|`|xpiGWrdMaa	They're hoping you'll put out and they think a beach setting will entice the girl into doing so because she'll think its all romantic.|`|K8lxbOdqaa	dont matter where im at i just love her in my arms and to look into her eyes and tell her how much i love her and kiss her softly
LfDrc2Thaa	Well I wouldn't think of her as primiscuos, I mean, everyone needs sex once in a while, and people sometimes don't want to be in a serious relationship because of their studies, work, etc. So I would think of it as normal, many people do that, and if she is only having sex with 1 friend that doesn't mean she is a sl0th, she doesn't want to be commited and likes sex, it's normal.|`|rGip5hMEaa	i don't have sex with my friends because sex to me is a special thing between two people that love each other and want more out of life than just a friendship.too many people are "just having sex to just have sex".people have forgot what sex really means.it's a bond of love|`|92n13q98aa	There's no such thing as a female you are only having sex with. You must have conversations, etc. Friends with benefits works, but it has to be established up front. Chicks get crazy when a guy bangs them; they think it means he loves them. I'm sorry, but not all guys that bang you love you. And just because you're exclusive doesn't mean he wants to be.|`|HjO6eCP7aa	this leads to problems you cant just be friends with benefits without 1 or both parties feeling attached after a while. if your friends with benefits it meas the sex must be good so when the other person finds someone else the other person gets jealous it never works just ask the guy out jeez you skank  and if your friend dated you for a while lets call your friend zach cuz this is annoying if this zach guy dated you fo a while then you left him but wanted 2 keep having sex then your at fault here ms.

wscyjkPAaa	He's looking up to you so I suggest to set a good example and act like a big brother.  Maybe he follows you around because you don't spend enough time with him.|`|DcVoq5Tuaa	be nice to him, he looks up to you.
R54BklqLaa	Honestly, hon;. I've went kind of like this but, if sparks were there the first time for him but, not the second. Then, it means he really did get over your relationship and just didn't want to face it. In this case I'm not going to give you a sugar coated anwser. I'm giving you a real one and I find yes, it's as hard as hell to get over your first love but, you can do it. and if you really don't want to let go and give in to the temptation of letting him fake it you'll only screw yourself over in the end.  I really hope you make the right choice as to not staying with him.  Love,   Kaylynn.|`|6wR9QkAlaa	argh I hate guys like this.  Hun please move on.   My ex did the same to me. made me feel awful to the point where I was depressed all the time and finally when I told him I was feeling so down he was all like "I'll look after you I promise" then a week later dumped me saying he felt so sorry for me that he felt more like I was his little sister than anything else.  Yuk. Anyway. Just move on, you don't love him that much, it feels like it but you need a rest and then back on the dating scene to find the right guy.  But it's up to you, whatever advice you get on here. You can't make someone do anything, but you can take the highroad and get on with life and he will have to respect that.|`|FiCl71flaa	The question you need to ask is "why do you want to continue to see him or date him in light of everything you know"? I know you said he was the only guy you ever loved and wanted but it appears he does not want you anymore at least not in a romantic or intimate manner. A relationship involves two people who agree to come together for their mutual benefit. You can not force this guy to love you or make him want you. He is honest with you but you do not seem to want to hear him or listen to him.While I can understand that he is your first love and you are naturally sad to see it end, you can not make anyone love you or stay with you. Hence ,as painful as it may be , you have to move on with your life and find a new love. If you insist on trying to force this issue , you only open yourself to being used and abused and more pain. I wish you the best.|`|45f0c56f7feb9ae97c2bd6ec5b691f76aa	well, if he got not emotionally as means feelings for you or love! than best thing is to separate ways to eachother, being stuck like that you will never find the answer, but you did find the answer for his emotionally.|`|376a0b518236d45e27355ee9bd22da43aa	hi, im sorry to hear of your problem, there is nothing worse than when you love someone but they no matter how hard they feel do not feel the same about you.  i know its hard but you must really thank this guy for being honest, lots of guys would of just cheated on you trying to find that spark, he was honest and told you the truth when you asked.  i know it hurts but we Always say we want the truth but it still hurts when we get the truth we don't want to hear.  just be friends but i really think its time to move on.  good luck..xx
pNMDhjiKaa	wow you need to be patient with him and see him through the darker times, if you get on well with his parents i think if it was me i'd let them in on the loop at the end of the day your trying to look out for someone you love but you must feel lost because at the end of the day how can you really deal with your boyfriend being depressed there is no written manual to help you with this thrust your instincts best of luck can't be easy on you either|`|lzgRNQjfaa	hey kaylie !     Don't  assume he is depressed. He may be lil stressed about some thing , but watch him very closely. If he you see changes in his behaviours or symptoms for depression the best thing you can do to your boyfriend is take him to see a doc and they will let you know what to do next.  Pls do help him out if he is in early stages of depression.    p.s you didnt really explain his symptoms or anything its hard to say if he is depressed or not.|`|zOtiAN3xaa	dam, its not really something you can answer without more info!!    could be a teenage thing!  something really bad could have happened  or anything      but the important thing is you stand by him and make sure hes okay!!  people can do silly things when their minds play tricks on them    but on the other hand people say things for sympathy!

sCr2iTczaa	tell him that you are already going with friends but maybe you two could meet up at the dance or something maybe hang out, that way it won't be a date and he won't think that you are really all that into him. or you could tell him you cant go with him because you have a bf and he wouldn't like the fact of another boy taking you to the dance and if he asks if he knows him so no probably not he goes to a different school.|`|1oGRuniyaa	do it in private and in person or on the phone saying hey you are awesome to hang with i just don't like you like that and i don't think i ever will so i don't think you should think that    it tells him hey stop it now.  it tells him straight forward|`|smyhq0Ggaa	Not around anyone else.

Even better let him say he dumped you.|`|K8lxbOdqaa	well i wouldnt want to be rejected at all...its that simple|`|Gl3zQNGWaa	Tell him you're a lesbian :p|`|EsnFmcMFaa	he asked you to the dance    go with him  its no big deal its just a dance  i mean you could change your mind about him     anyway if he already asked you and no other guy has then that means all the other guys have gotten a date    go with him to the dance trust me|`|d0lye0cyaa	Maybe you should of told him a few weeks ago.....|`|nA97uWdyaa	Tell him the truth in whatever manner you would want to be told if the positions were reversed. Maybe his feelings will be hurt, but there's nothing you can do about it. In the long run you are doing him a favor by telling him the truth and giving him the chance to see himself from someone else's perspective.|`|5AdVt7dEaa	Tell him "I only like him as a friend ".  If he's any kind of person, he'll be alright.  If you're not going to enjoy yourself at the dance, he'll be miserable too.  No need to feel guilty.|`|vDjy1eKDaa	sit him down and tell him nicely ur not interested..thats the best u can do..be nice about it.
eMXIQaQlaa	For me, I like big guys. I dunno why. I just like to feel protected or something.    Wide shoulders  Taller than me  Strong arms  Nice eyes  Nice smile  Short hair (no pony tails-ewww)  Clothes that aren't preppy or emo  I dont care if he's a little chubby either but overall I like a guy who looks somewhat athletic.  Calloused hands :) means he knows how to work hard    Haha- and I would have to agree with the first answerer although the only way I would be really disappointed is if it was like unusually small but I wouldn't want it to be too big either.    Generally I look for someone who is close to the same attractiveness level as me or slightly less.|`|xrICGT7Taa	i like honest eyes... cute smile.....  i hate beard....|`|Y38ZGHUDaa	my type of man, is   dark(mexican), tall, bearded, nerd that play world of war craft, glasses, braces, not too skinny, not to fat,      umm...   yummy..|`|AA10707686	gr8 & comforting smile, good physique because girls love warm hugs, and it depends on a girl if she likes the guy with stubble or clean shaved. also a girl expects a boy to always keep himself neat and tidy. he shouldn't be too thin or thick but should be fit and healthy. and eyes in which a girl would want to drown forever. and should be smart but it's not that a boy should be just good looking and handsome. Of course, looks matter. but it's the inner beauty that matters the most. height should be good enough to match the girl's height,  and so that the couple looks good together.|`|G2NoXxDVaa	everyone is different  but for me....    1.Natural looking tan  2.Taller than me  3.Nice teeth  4.Well groomed    I don't focus too much on physical appearance|`|YWdS1L7saa	a big shlong =)    ha.  Beautiful eyes  smile  a warm hug.  things like that    loveAVERs|`|7QEmeZuZaa	don't really know................ what exactly do you mean!!!!|`|WD52Mm9uaa	I love eyes... Also hands. If i guy has nice hands that's a plus. Strong arms that are able to hold you up when you need it. smell good..nice smile.. i guess that's all.|`|3H2pLKFvaa	honestly we girls want attention from our guy. physically strong pretty eyes, tall and so on|`|DFSHoO4uaa	your avatar, if i saw ur avatar in real life,i would be dreaming! lol a nice smile goes a long way.
cIBqQ0QEaa	I don't know what you should do... but I can tell you what happened to my mom. She was engaged to someone before she met my dad. The man she was engaged to went off to the Navy, so she left him not willing to wait for him. Here it is over 30 years later and my parents are divorced and she got married to the man she was originally engaged to.. Interesting how things work out.|`|jZ03Zdjdaa	Let's take your high school sweetheart out of this equation, b/c this has nothing to do with him.  You are insufficiently excited about marrying your bf.  You are saying that HE loves you but nothing about you loving him, and that he treats you well.  Then you listed a bunch of his flaws.  Plus, you have a lot of attachment to the h.s. sweetheart (regardless of whether he's really available.)  And you said yes, but reluctantly and with a lot of hesitation.      To me, it's a no-brainer that you should not be marrying the boyfriend, and in fact, you should have broken up with him a while ago.  You are insufficiently into him to marry him.  You should definitely break off the engagement and the relationship.
ycNxVrUfaa	My ex husband didn't want to spend the money for me to go back to school (although we had enough). I resented the hell out of him and started back at a community college. I realized I was good at it, smarter than he gave me credit for and I deserved an education if I was willing to work for it. Ultimately we divorced, he begged for me to come back and promised to pay for every cent of my education. Too late.|`|1YDpRGocaa	my mom conned my grandparents (my dads parents) out of money that was supposed to go to my college fund and spent it on her second divorce (the guy she cheated on my dad with) that answer your question?
mUed9bXYaa	18 months and you're already sick of it?  ive been single for 30 months (2 and a half years!) how do you think i feel?|`|0MOXObjkaa	I have the exact same problem!! only two bfs and for about 8 weeks, dont get hung up on that drunk guy, believe me once you start looking someone will find you:)|`|AA11755944	"fools rush in" was an elvis song.|`|IkWcwsj8aa	date me|`|d3y4iHSyaa	OMG i got that situation...but now im falling for my best guy friend. He too is in a serious situation. My best advice is to move on. if you're ment to be he will find you in the end|`|iqZUd5Fdaa	If you're bored being single you'll be even more bored as a couple. Life is a lot more interesting being single, you can fancy whoever you want, date different people, flirt with whoever you want without feeling guilty, do whatever you want at a moments notice, you cant do any of that in a relationship. You've got the next 60 years of your life to be setlled down with somebody, enjoy being single while you can
CtDBQwzaaa	i would say you need to punch "loser" in the face and say - ***** dont ever touch me again!- then walk away with "tila" because she will be like - wow your cool why did i even like "loser"- then you will live happly ever after with "tila" while "loser" becomes a loser for real and has no friends!!!!  ?Jess|`|7w9AM9Tnaa	no she's not. you deserve a better friend.
6mVpfmR6aa	For a long time, I thought it was subtle/passive things like laughing and giggling a lot around a guy, playing with her hair, a long uninterrupted almost hypnotic stare or having her jaw drop open for minutes while staring, or drooling, or when she faints after looking at or kissing a guy (aka swooning).      But women today sometimes are a lot less subtle/passive, like when a woman looks at a guy and shouts: "Wow!" When she snaps a photograph when a guy walks past her, or when she turns her back to a movie to watch a guy in the audience, or telephoning a guy, when he did not give her his phone number.  A woman will sometimes scream at the top of her lungs at the site of the guy.  Sometimes women will just go up put her arms around a guy, Some women go further and grab the guys privates and there are some women who try to follow a guy into the men's room.|`|HtpRBMFraa	They'll make casual contact to see how you respond. Watch facial expressions for interest or disgust. She may start asking your opinion on more intimate/personal things.|`|PPKuHl9baa	Dry Humping.,   No seriously, women are so hard to understand sometimes. Usually it's pretty noticeable. It's always hard to meet women in bars and clubs. I find most of my dates from people that I meet on a more personal level. Sadly, a lot of these come from work. Too many. School is a good place too. Any woman should watch out if she ends up being my lab partner in Chemistry class. I'll weasel my way in there.|`|56buyQZ1aa	if she looks you in your eyes bu than ignore you but only if she does that many times, when she kinda searches for you like in school or something likethat, when she laughs loud when you are around her :) :D|`|CSMv7U5raa	His ways and his character.Then she will want to know about his life,job,e.t.c.|`|xxmxNxULaa	Flirtatious moves are often really hard to read when it comes to women. In general, we are very flirtatious and touchy. Mostly, if we ask you questions about yourself, then we are interested in some way or another. When I like a guy, I find little ways to touch him, like picking lint off his shirt or touching his back in some way (this is my favorite part of a guy). I lightly place my hand on his shoulder or back to get his attention, rather than just saying "Hey" or calling his name. Again, this is just me, but from what I know, plenty of women do this also.|`|xRkXbmI4aa	sher wants to see him|`|9b6e3856ff9fd505bdf5544026fe01dfaa	money money|`|YqsND3Wmaa	She spends time with him, laughs at his jokes, compliments him, keeps her gaze on him.|`|alaUYtRcaa	Okay girls can be pretty obvious. If they either stare into your eyes and smile a lot or completely avoid your eyes cuz they're scared of you noticing. And laughing at everything you say is a definite give away. If they flutter they're eyelashes or touch your arm it's another good sign. They will also give any excuse to talk to you or hug you.
cG7z70Vgaa	That will be when he is sure you won't be freaked out by him saying it.|`|0PWnOjILaa	It could be awhile it just depends on when he falls in love with you. Just because you are going out with someone does not mean that you have to love them that is all up to you. Many he just does not fell it yet. If you really love him then you will wait for him to love you.:)
PmZIiP8jaa	well, it was just a mistake and you were telling your friend just to let things out I guess so don't worry about it. Apologize but if he never accepts your apologies just move on. But if you really care about the friendship try to restore it. If it doesn't work ignore him and move on.|`|3y0w1qIBaa	Apologize it to him face to face and ask him if you can make it up to him.  It can be anything.  Since that he is going through his difficult time, comforting would be the best thing.  Next time, you may want to think before you act because once we said it, we can't take it back.|`|jg5yg2ojaa	go up to him IN PERSON and say I know I wasn't the greatest friend to you an I am sorry but I was hoping we could just be friends I will never do it again and I was a total jackass please forgive me|`|WBpVZpb0aa	I suggest writing him a note or email, that way you can say what you need to say all at once. Tell him that you're so sorry about the text, you were sad about the breakup but trying not to show it. Tell him you really care about his friendship and not to let him ruin it over that.|`|2S6iXcmCaa	lol that sucks lol but just tell him that ur sorry but tell him that it was kind of weird that he asks you out and just breaks up with u right away just tell him if you want to forgive me then thats cool but if u dont whatever im appologizing thats all you now say im not going to beg you anymore|`|6282cae4780c315a4a883ed371640c65aa	Hello & God bless If I was you I would not worried be who u r if he likes having a girl here and a girl there I think he is not worth the time of air. If he is a teen image what would happened when he gets to an adult age things go bump in the road.             Just say hello                                    be well be safe God bless|`|uzVMSVJpaa	ohkaay, WOW :O    tell him..that it was never supposed to be sent to him  and even though you knw he wont beleiev you, tell him....uhmm  tell him tht you were confused, tht he broke up with you so quickly..so you were kinda upset [im guessing, i would be..? lol]   so you were telling yer friend [the one yu were supposed to send it too]  and tht you hope he'll forgive you, because you enjoy having him as a friend?    i tried..hope it helps, sort of..[:|`|L7pavNcaaa	wow. ouch.  Well honestly it was a mistake, its not like you intentionally went to hurt his feelings. Really if someone says something just tell them its between you two and when they say oh its my buisness now im his friend, say well i didnt date you did i? idk its hard but hey at least that'll hold them for a bit. He wasnt that good to you either so its stupid for someone to be mad  and honestly it was 23 hours. they need to get a grip on life.   he cant be hurt THAT bad.   about science keep your head high act like nothing is wrong. maybe smile at him to show your not wanting a harsh ending to this. It wasnt ment to hurt him, he wasnt even ment to see it and hopefully in time he'll see that. Anyways these things dont last long so try not to have those awful butterfly feelings when your sleeeping keep you up. This will all be over shortly. :]|`|9B40I3MZaa	I think you say sorry to this boy exactly how YOU think you should.  start with something like "Name, I really need to talk to you about what just happened." then maybe say that you only tried to send the text to your friend because you were trying to be funny and that it was never meant to be serious. if he doesnt forgive you than maybe you should just move on. these things take time.  good luck
jdVxsK4yaa	dont act lke a child n show ppl dat ur responsible n take care of urself|`|1D2UiAJeaa	Initiative is very important. Work when no one asks you to. Also when someone asks you to do something don't moan or make faces.    Hope I Helped  09!!!|`|e7f7b9508f28f00c8e34cd692587ca8caa	help around the house without being ask and do more things for yourself|`|wscyjkPAaa	Follow the rules of the house.  Show her some respect.  Do good in school and make sure you don't break any of your commitments.  Remember : Deliver on your commitments (follow the house rules, curfew, whatever ), you'll gain their Trust, when you do that enough times you'll get Credibility.  Then I'm sure when your parents notice how responsible you are they'll be more lenient.|`|q0A4enABaa	Well it is like this... Until you are 18 and / or outta the house then you are going to have to deal with mama.
jWAzxHGvaa	Hmm she might be hiding you from her parents or someone else. I would talk to her about it and let her know that you don't just want an email relationship, you want to actually speak to her : ) If she has a problem with it then get out of it because communication is key!|`|AA10397687	you should break up with her before she hurts you.
aDl1kZa6aa	Write down everything that happened and tell your parents if you haven't already...i guess they noticed the bruised nose lol and make sure you inform the police. Please just trust me and tell the police just incase something worse happens, get your word in first because she can easily get you in trouble if you try to defend yourself or she'll say you provoked her or whatever. Be brave, try to ignore her i know it's hard but just keep going about your life, whatever you do don't decide to stay at home tomorow, i did that once and it took me a while to get my confidence back and get out again, i was in a similar situation too you. hope you're ok x|`|NVUngN45aa	its assault  its a police matter|`|wL7v53Unaa	Tell the police,you don't have to put up with being treated like that and she will get what she deserves.|`|7FGsxx4Qaa	I agree with Mrs Boob,you must report it..............|`|qgpXxcuGaa	Whoooooa. What a *****!! I'd let someone know, she sounds like a nasty piece of work. Avoid her as much as possible, maybe get the police involved if she won't leave you alone. Talk about rough !! Good luck ..|`|2c726775df1bee382684b2b2b4d3e248aa	Tell your parents and the police - she assaulted you, which is a criminal offence at any age - let her get away with it and she will do it again and again.  Don't worry about her "little friends" - they will run away when they do not have her to hide behind.|`|jgxDtWawaa	yeh you should really tell the police. She did it 2 make herself look hard.  She sounds so pathetic, i rele hate people like that. They rele dont deserve a life. Dont wory about it. She will get wats coming to her one day, hopefully soon xx|`|bvgQV9lMaa	Call the police this is violent assault!
aIEkNM0Paa	I'd rather stay alone :D|`|PUUXbVK2aa	neither.|`|2wrEoTYgaa	Ok Honestly.. I wouldnt date either of them.  But if I was forced to by some painful means.. I would choose the second one.|`|YyMFDs6Eaa	icky niether, but if i HAD to choose, the second one|`|3YpVVRWpaa	none they are too babyish|`|l69tjl0paa	They both look like greasy 11 year olds! But if my life depended on it, i would take the second one. He will prob grow up to be not that bad. But they r both wayyyy too young for me!|`|BrEUh8U5aa	NONE|`|BaZBWq5Eaa	ummmm....neither!!!!!!!!!!!|`|IN1wPKwoaa	none|`|RtAML1fJaa	i don't know about dating them they are way too young for me but i think they are cute for girls of their age|`|wh2qOKJ4aa	neither|`|NkTC4eGcaa	You like those ugly little things? EW!
k04315Liaa	Try standing near her or her group.  If one of the girls is outgoing, she'll talk to you, and soon you'll be part of their group too! Good luck!
0108814c0be993aa40a2e5f0e69ae0f9aa	Don't worry about having him drive you.  Ask your parents if it would be ok if you ride there with one of your girl friends.  This way you don't have to worry about your parents taking you & you don't have to feel pressured into staying with this guy if you don't like him. Don't stress on dancing & what will happen there.  Just meet him at the dance & just go with the flow of the night.  Don't confront him or his friends about his motives for asking you to the dance.  Just focus on looking cute, having a great personality & getting to see if you like each other.  Good luck!!|`|pKzH1cFHaa	Hopefully, he will be fine with you meeting him there, or maybe even picking him up.     Most teens can't dance. What teens consider "dancing" at dances, is just usually grinding against each other, so no worries there. Just move to the music.     If he didn't like you, he wouldn't ask you. Don't ask him if he was forced to or not, because that is a turn off and could make you look like a fool for asking.|`|QBV4cFbqaa	It would not be tacky he will understand if you tell him the truth. Just dance the way you always do. I never grind or any of that . Don't confront him it will make it awkard. Only cause a friend hints doesn't mean he has to do it .If he asks you out it's based on his own choice. Have lotz and lotz of fun.|`|qV77sbc8aa	No one can tell you what you should do. It's something you need to decide for yourself. Think about the pros and cons of going with him, and decide. Don't let irrational fears take over.   And if you have time, at some point in the near future learn to dance.  It'll come in handy later in life.  :)  CHEERS!|`|UiZ4zOkHaa	Well, the age there is nothing wrong with that. No it would not be tacky? Meet maybe at a restaurant and eat with him, and let your Mom get to know him. It doesn't matter if you can dance or not, as long as your having fun that's all that counts. If you don't want to grind, then don't. Because nobody said you had to. Before you even come to him and ask him, ask your friends be like, "Hey, did you like ask him to ask me? Be like totally honest with me." If you trust them, then they should tell you the honest answer. If you think they are telling the truth don't ask him. Also if you don't believe them, just see how he acts around you and around the friends. Observe his actions but don't take it to the point of stalker.
JdOtCVHZaa	lmao where someone is located doesnt mean that they have good or bad personalities. its how they were brought up / what their morals are and such. ironically it would be shallow to judge someone on how shallow they are by where they live|`|f5u9sxbTaa	no. the guys in the middle states are dum as a doughnut.  guys on the coasts know how to get what they want.|`|5UwQtCzOaa	lol, interesting question but i think it all goes back to the parents, im pretty sure that there are shallow people all over, im not saying that i am any better by any means... you just have to look for the ones that are not shallow...|`|S7mrg4tiaa	no-thats wher i live

Long, styled hair is really hot.
0ve51pW9aa	I hardly see how she is obligated to sculpt her body to meet your approval. It seems to me that if you truly love someone you love them for what's on the inside.     Having said that, you are a grown man and have the right to leave her, as the first answerer said. If she makes you that unhappy then it is definitely best for the both of you to go separate ways. But if you truly care about her, try to find out the underlying reason why she seems to have lost interest in her personal appearance. She may be experiencing depression, or some other underlying problem.|`|8j7FCEOraa	Why dont you get off your 'cough' shallow' cough' *** and HELP her loose weight?     She doesn't need to be in shape, your supposed to love her regardless if she gained 50 pounds. Its not about appearances, its about health. She needs to get in shape for her health.  Go for a jog WITH her  Lift some weights WITH her    So why dont you work WITH her instead of basically calling her a fat *** and getting pissy when shes not motivated to do the extra work.    Plus I bet if you actual treated her with some respect she wouldnt mind getting in shape for you. Why do the extra work for a jack *** who doesnt actually love you anyways?!|`|cdXMQai8aa	I hate PHAT girls. They really anoy me. Soon no one is going to have any food. Tell her 3 meals a day. I skip lunch.    All they want to do it eat eat eat.    I don't care if they like are just fat and don't eat a lot.    But girls who are fat because they eat do damn much anoy the **** out of me.   OMG!    Dump her.    Don't pay for her food.|`|5699ac9816ed1f9d3230e170b3ef4793aa	You know what? My answer is going to sound shallow and misogynistic and there's no way around it so I'm just going to say it:    If you feel she's not the same girl you were initially attracted to, then dump her. There is no law that says you have to be unhappy just so she can remain comfortable. You've tried talking to her, you've done your part. If she doesn't act on it, then you owe it to yourself to act for your betterment and leave.|`|J6wPJlvVaa	Well first off, you should care about more than just your girlfriends appearance, how about her health and how bad 50 extra pounds can be for her to be carrying around.  Why don't you suggest you get into shape together? Invite her to come work out with you, it can be a good bonding experience together.|`|7BkbvD7Zaa	If you ain't feeling it, move on.    Relationships are based on three things: 1) Communication, 2) Sex, 3) Looks.     If you aren't sexually attracted to her anymore than we don't have a relationship.    Dump her, 4 years is too long anways.    Good Luck!|`|z15RhXfjaa	Is she sad about something?    Is she depressed, or is something bothering her?    May be its something that she is not telling you about?    Does she have a social life and go out with friends?    To be honest, if she cant get motivated she has probably lost her self esteem and self respect.    I feel sorry for her, I don't think she is doing it just to spite you, I think she is having low self esteem issues and therefore cant get motivated to do anything/    If she doesnt have a reason in her life to be thin for (going out with friends, having nice dresses to wear etc) then its going to be hard to get the motivation to do it.    Just being thin for YOU isn't enough, especially if she doesn't have any romantic moments with you anymore.    Start cherishing her and being more romantic, and you will see that she will start to make some improvement.    Give her a real reason to loose weight!!!!|`|xnMuRqsXaa	You're an ******. You're love and affection for her should not be determined by how much she ways. It doesn't sound like you want her to be in shape so she'll be healthy, it sounds like you're embarassed to be with a "fat girl."    If there's something in the way she's been treating you that's changed, focus on that. Not this.    Don't be a shallow jerk. She's probably going through a tough time right now.|`|P5ZNPyW4aa	I definitely see how people can take this as shallow, but I also see your standpoint as well.  (A family member got married to a woman that was drop-dead-gorgeous, and after having kids she went from in-shape and responsible to over-250lbs-and-lazy.)    If she is comfortable with her size and it has stayed steady for a long time now (meaning she hasn't been losing or gaining any substantial amounts of weight in the last couple months) then it's not such a bad thing.  However, if she is uncomfortable with it and it's an unhealthy type of weight, then something should be done; specifically for her health.    Make sure she knows you want her to lose the weight because you want her to be healthy, not because you just want an attractive spouse.|`|mewFgxtwaa	It's really not that shallow, she needs to learn to respect and take care of herself before she can expect anyone else to. I mean if it were just a few pounds like 15 or less I'd just try to get her to do physical stuff with you or something, but when it's changing your entire body and making yourself unhealthy then that's a different story. I think you need to sit down with her and don't criticize her, but tell her you are concerned about her health and even the way she looks at herself and if she isn't motivated to do something for herself then you really have to decide if you are willing to help her through it or just leave her alone to get herself together.|`|stRWElvPaa	Ok, I think if you've talked to her about getting in shape numerous times before then you have to come to a conclusion which is;  A) you love her, and can tolerate her being overweight for most of her adult life, and might put on more after having children, but you still want to be with her, or    B) You can't make yourself feel attracted to this woman and don't want to spend your life with a woman you don't find attractive, are worried your eyes might wander etc.    So, if it's A then try to take over the cooking and make it healthier, also a good tactic is to scare her into taking care of herself by showing her facts on how fat hurts her health.    If it's B then you should be very honest, that you aren't attracted to her now that she's gained 50 pounds, and although you love her you need to find her attractive too, after all this is a relationship not a friendship.       give her 6 months to change. good luck!    EDIT: No I don't think you're a jerk at all, it's very understandable that you can't force yourself to be attracted to someone who looks very different from when you first dated. How long after you met did she start letting herself go? Are you sure she's not just really comfortable? How old is she, sorry so many questions but as you get older you care less about how your body is I guess..
272OOwF9aa	he probably is very used to you and he loves you, but he is not IN LOVE with you...so this is something many people dont want to do, but its called marriage syndrome and in your case since your not married, its best to find someone who makes you feel good. You are just used to him and u dont want to lose him.|`|ee16bd6fa8f2d93667b5d5f76c2e7c8caa	I didn't see anywhere that you said YOU loved him. I know it will hurt, especially since you've been together so long, but its time to end things. If he isn't giving you what you need in a relationship, why stay together? Honestly, it sounds as though you are maturing and he is not. And on another note, people under house arrest often make the Big House their next stop. Do you really want to deal with that drama?|`|a1uoxczTaa	if this were me i would block my feeling out and leave him. maybe u need to leave so he can understand wat he is missing, dont talk to him for a while and wait for him to call and all that. i really wouldnt count on this working and i believe u should move on. there r great guys out there.
KcR829Edaa	He should kiss you. Guys don't really like girls who are dont let them make some moves it will make them feel less manly if you always call him and make the moves guys want to be able to chase girls. Be very suggestive at kissing (lick your lips, apply gloss chapstick bite you lips etc.) but dont kiss him. it will leave him wanting to kiss you trust me!|`|cqYi0OYXaa	the guy kisses first dont be stupid..everyone knows that|`|0XvImpdFaa	kiss him with out askin|`|fZjBVUE2aa	lol he kisses you.  you don't ask.  he might ask if he can kiss you.  but sometimes it will just happen.|`|oBk1bD1yaa	usually its the guy|`|7BRJhrABaa	well he is the guy..usually the guy does it. but you can make the first move too.|`|pVUhlg4iaa	i was about to say ur too young to be kissing but my first kiss was at 13 and it was a french, so i guess i shud not be a hypocrite. . .     just relax and go with the flow. ull both know when its right.|`|WPipgT9vaa	neither.....you are too young to be kissing|`|AWoH1oN0aa	when the time is right it will just happen ...dont rush into it|`|VY5dcdXVaa	Well it doesn't really matter who initiates the kiss, but it would be better if you surprised him with a kiss. Trust me|`|AA10339139	do whatever feels natural to you, have fun|`|NXJDsVfNaa	Either way works.   I kissed my boyfriend first, but usually the guy takes over and kisses the girl first.   If it feels like the right time, go for it.     But don't jump on him or anything. lol    Good luck!|`|4ESlizXraa	Ideally he tries to kiss you, you get to decide if he is successful or not ;)    Typically guys don't ask, but at 13 its possible.  I saw something that said most girls know within the first five minutes of a date if they're going to kiss the guy or not, not sure how accurate that is since his behavior on the date affects that decision, but the point is you get to know and he has to guess.|`|b7e963cdc8af9fe642ed7426ec8bf3b1aa	Whatever. Don't think about it too much. It'll happen naturally. Whatever happens, happens. Whoever kisses whoever.|`|zWB3jHHPaa	ewww your 13.   think about this.. the earlier you start making out/ having sex with boys, the greater your chance of getting herpes.. in the mouth AND genitals.. so think about that for a second..|`|d49ZA5xYaa	BOTH|`|Elaimr9qaa	on a first date the guy always makes the first move x|`|EgY9A6Xcaa	it depends if u both wanna kiss eachother or not|`|nz2T73NPaa	Don't kiss unless you want to, just because your on a date doesn't meen you have to kiss him.  When you do want to kiss there are no rules, you can kiss him or he can kiss you..|`|pai1hX9Zaa	If he really likes you and wants to kiss you then he will but you can make him think that you want him to kiss you by getting close to him and making an impression as in" kiss me"|`|Yu5AfOlXaa	Well, you can't really determine this from an outside point of view.  If you two have a great connection while on the date, and he's getting close to your face, and being touchy, then go for a slow peck. Dont' go immidiately for a make out sesh.    But GENERALLY the guy is supposed to go 90% of the way, then you go the rest of the way into the kiss.|`|mewFgxtwaa	I think the guy should always make the first move but sometimes guys are wimps. But then again if he's taking too long and you know he wants it to then go for it. Also if you're that young and needing kissing advice then you're probably too young to be kissing anyway lol but I'm not here to tell you what to do.|`|kPwHlu45aa	He kisses you, always..the guy always kisses the girl, unless your in a relationship together even then he should always kiss you first.  Neither one of you should ask, if he wants to do it, he will..but don't ask him you'll seem to eager..if its meant to happen it will, if not leave it at that!
d508e71226a169afed7ebfc7e78bbc5baa	Weird or disgusting, heck no, you need to let that loser of a bf know that he just lost the best thing that he ever had in his life.  This boy is so petty just because his father and your mother are dating, they are not married right?  I bet if you tried hard enough like going to the grocery store and stand in the vegetable isle, look perplexed and smile at the most handsome guy there and you will forget that loser boy that we were previously taking about.  Females of your beauty can have guys wrapped around your figure, no i mean your finger in the matter of seconds.  Wish you the best of luck!!|`|yj3GT7jOaa	I wish I could give you some better advice.  You can't make someone stay who doesn't want to.  He probably thinks it weird also and that may be part of the reason for the breakup.  What may happen next will be any ones guess.|`|6wxgyGy5aa	I can understand the weirdness of it all but I think if you want to date, you should.  You aren't related by blood so if you can both get past the fact that your parents are dating, stick it out.  Best of luck to you!|`|LbNXxRXnaa	Well that would make you guys step siblings. So yes, that would be a tad bit awkward|`|1UQCy2DVaa	I think both you and your parents should continue the relationship. If you parents relationship starts to get more serious, then it may be the time to break up. But for now, it seems completely fine|`|CEqYjcBeaa	There is plenty of potential, I see no issue with it. I mean having to explain your family to someone might seem a little strange, but who cares. The only thing that should matter is how you two feel about each other.|`|A9pQ4iFKaa	If you all are adults I don't see the problem in continuing the relationship and if you were together before the parents hooked up let them know they are out of line.|`|Vf5OnZ4Caa	ask yourself, who was in a relationship first? if the parents were, you should have known (he shouldve to) that you should avoid dating...however you you guys were dating first the parents realy shoud have not gotten together    however if he broke up w/you and does not want to see you there is not much you can do about it.goodluck|`|mXCA4vIYaa	its like gossip girl!    sorry.     but no. there is no reason to break up. there is definitely potential, and it will be weird. but if its how you feel about him then its how you feel - you cant change it.  just make sure he feels the same way.|`|c63d23a0d58654baa299d30bffb007bbaa	If neither of you lived with your parents and didn't see them all the time, then it wouldn't be such a problem.  Maybe you should be friends until your parents break up or untill you move out.|`|0sPQnq7oaa	Sure there is potential,  hell, you could even say that you have dibs on that guys last name.  Sorry mom.  But the real deal is that your ex boyfriend is just not that into you.  Clearly, because he is your ex boyfriend, and not your current one.  Sorry doll face. I know its important and it hurts bad. But I bet you any money he's gonna be the one to get another girlfriend first. Know why? Cuz he broke up with you and is not dating you anymore.   It's really sucky- I feel your pain.  I empathize with you, and so do many many many many other chicks out there.  But to be honest, if he is not even willing to consider getting back together with you,  the answer to your questions are obvious.
786cdd812ce5aab02a737d9a44746cdbaa	Age is only a number, and if he's still interested in a date with you then I say you should give it a try. Good Luck to both of you.|`|57xobgj2aa	Honey age is just a number! Being 21 or 61 doesn't make a bit of difference on ones ability to love someone else. You have one life, that's it, and you don't want to spend the rest of it wondering what would have been. If there is chemistry and the ability to make it work then go for it. He is a grown man and he wants you. To know that he can have young girls and these are his partying days but he would rather spend them with you is a huge deal. Most women would kill for a man like that. You need to stick with this guy!! Go get your man now girl! I want you to watch this movie, it will give you great insight.     http://www.mylifetime.com/on-tv/movies/f...|`|AA11249047	You go Cougar|`|XKoPyRsAaa	I believe in the saying, "Age ain't nothing but a number" so i think if you guys are both interested in each other and think that y'all can make something work then go right ahead, but if you are really concerned about the age difference that you can't look passed it then don't do it.
bDCSxkJtaa	NEVER  but my sister knocked her man out with a vision unbreakable pot ,she never replaced the pot coz she proved they can break never liked the brother in law anyway GOD BLESS HIM!!!!!|`|ZmdIlkpQaa	LOL    My wife never has, although she has probably been provoked to that point a few times.  My mother, however, is a different story.  When I was about 16, my dad and I got into a huge row about my girlfriend, and we ended up throwing punches at each other in my mom's kitchen.  She took a frying pan to us both, one lump each, and then ordered me out of the house for the night and my father to the couch, and then locked her bedroom door and didn't even cook dinner!  LOL    We got the point, needless to say, and managed to keep our altercations verbal instead of physical from then until I left the house for the Marines a year later.
fEeEP7vYaa	Personally i think you need to go with something sporty..  all dudes love sports..keep it real and simple.   it doesn't have to be much.    and if he truly doesn't want anything   then make him something like a cake or cookies.  that's pretty much all its really a guy giving a girl kinda holiday  hope this helps :)  good luck!|`|AA11030210	a kiss|`|ccb402364f76559985af31b2ece8e3ccaa	a kiss or some thing like that....or something non gushy or mushy cause i think guys get embarrassed when ever they get stuff like that.|`|78kT0KSEaa	Box o chocolate(some kind of candy), a card, maybe cologne, you could make a small cake, or even a computer game .|`|Nd8xn515aa	Try listening to your boyfriend for once.  He told you what he wants: nothing!  Who gets her boyfriend a gift on Valentine's Day anyway?  He's supposed to give you something.  Guys don't care about V Day.  Ask any guy.|`|yAOIB5SJaa	anal...|`|JiUwpYSXaa	An stenciled tee shirt with both your names on it.  I had one made locally at an embroidery shop and it cost $20.00.  You can also order online.
WQwCkbw8aa	i think i didn't ur qus.    But y i like her?? there is no reason to love but I know one thing, she make me happiest I have ever been and I wana make her feel the same way for rest of her life.    2nd part of ur qus... i dont understand. if u r asking Do I still love her, I would say ask me when I am dying. My answer will be I am dying because i can't bear more love in me then this...     I love her to death...Hope its clear|`|TZCzjpGmaa	I love her.. and will love her always...|`|8p31dENPaa	I love him with all my heart, unconditionally and without reservation. We bring out the best in each other. He is so good to me, makes me feel protected and taken care of and I try to do the same for him.|`|mo5N8tPtaa	i feel pain sometimes for loving him so much...i love him, but not because i can't love someone else but loving him makes me happye|`|89V3CTLdaa	i loved him becoz he is the best and he cares about me and yes i stil love him becoz he listen to me and does wat i want him to do and will always love him.|`|OBbuiqZ3aa	I loved him because he had a wonderful personality. We were 14 when i first met him. We were always together. Almost 4 years of happiness and a lot of growing up together.    He was my first love. It's the purest kind.    I will always have a spot in my heart for him. We shared so many firsts together. And i still love him. . . .   But. there is a lot time cannot heal or change. So i will never be "in love" with him again.|`|bef12fbc176623e3f52681ef8805e8f8aa	cause, she is an absolute 'lovable', I can bet if a guy comes in touch with her, he couldn't survive by not falling in her love...  she is very honest, cute, honest, noble, kind, wise, smart, intelligent, sobber, brave.............what else reason's to fall in and keep continue loving....|`|HoKOAN7oaa	yes i still love him. love just happens. he was is and will be my love for ever because  he is my first love we could not be together but i still love him.
GBr9YngTaa	Canada, around the age of 15 and 16.    Studies should that in the United States the average age is 16 and 18 in the UK. For other countries ages vary as well with gender, usually higher than age 18.    However, it depends on gender as well.|`|zb9TLvNkaa	I'd say 16-18 is average (USA)|`|467145608db35ec4ccc89f1b16418af6aa	here i would say from 13-16.  sad isn't it?

50b371e8637dae2470606af52c269bacaa	If I were him, I'd check with a lawyer.  I'm not sure about Texas, but I'm just about positive that the kids can't have another last name unless the new man adopted them, regardless of whether the dad is in prison or not.  As far as I know, just going to prison does not automatically cost you your parental rights.  If his rights were terminated by the ex, he would have been notified in the prison and he wouldn't be paying child support.  I think the ex can get into trouble.|`|bO2rzfISaa	The new name is not their legal name, but they can use it in many situations. If the visitation order is still intact, he still has the right to visit them. Somehow I doubt he was supporting those kids while in prison.    I live in TX and used my husband's name for my daughter after my ex had abandoned her for a number of years.|`|351cd68a64200905aea88f74e7661159aa	This is a question that needs to be answered by an attorney.  Laws are different in each state.  I know about my state, but not others.
rjYOC3Wpaa	I think it would be cool for both of you. age's is just a number. And if your happy and get alone all should be good. And you know sometimes your going to make each other mad so roll with it and enjoy life is to short. xoxoxox|`|8bq6S19Oaa	Yes, if she wants to... And no, if she doesn't want to.|`|ojNHRsj7aa	its unlikely but yes some women do date older men. you know why? money.|`|7pFVHdssaa	Dating has no limit on number or age as long as you are comfortable with a person.
s8d7gg5Haa	hey you helped me with my questions :)     but seriously you shouldn't fight that's all i did and i lost the one boy i thought was perfect for me   so donut fight its really not worth it your regret it in the end   it may or may not be your fault but talk calmly to each other don't fight!     and then if your talking calm to him he will have to and hopefully your problems will be sorted   if you ever want to talk im here :)   you don't know me and your probably like WHOA freak but if you just want someone to talk to then yeah cause i prefer talking to people that i don't really know   then you don't care if they judge you     good luck with your boyfriend its obvious You both care about each other as you got back together before just be strong :)|`|uVH046Fjaa	Go get plastered. Talking is much easier when drunk.
AA10227142	Yeah!!! Thats a great achivement. Id say he must be a hardworking determined soul and well done to him x|`|kQA7SbY9aa	I would think it's great that he was able to get a new job so soon. Having a job is very important to him. Does seem to be a positive and responsible person. I would be impressed.|`|VJsOvAecaa	If a woman liked the guy, then yes. But if the girl doesn't like the guy in the first place, then no!|`|vwMdEQPzaa	I would be impressed.  Jobs are going left right and centre if he has managed to secure another job fair play and well done. You must know his character from before so you judge him but I say well done and much respect to him.|`|9c664e07f8c2007897e3697258c8ca68aa	yeah he has done really well
KmNAewUQaa	seems like he's interested...ask him!|`|xRkXbmI4aa	yeaa, u can make a baby
AA10397687	I would die to be in your place right now. ask him if he's interested in a love triangle. . .I love gay guys.|`|b7gUW0CRaa	OK!so...stay away from him!|`|29ddeea7f871392bf7b17a12fc77a694aa	wow hes bi and trying to get with you lol|`|rHmMMPmtaa	an hero now
KwFaMD3iaa	My ex husband was that way. Oh man did it ever send me to a boiling point. It is soooo immature of him. He really needs to grow and act like an adult. I would ignore him. By you ignoring him when he acts like a child, he is not getting the response out of you that he is looking for. He is acting immature because he knows it upsets you. If you don't let him see that it bothers you and you ignore it, then he will eventually give up on acting that way. Be tough and ignore. It will be very hard, i know, but inside you can laugh at him, especially when he realizes he is not winning by acting that way.|`|c3NMbo3Qaa	r we married to the same guy, I bet he was his parents favorite and babied as a child, my hubby is 40 and still acts this way, I blame it on his mother who babied him and still does.      I sing hymns sometimes think bad thoughts but there is nothing you can do, just start acting like him when he wants to talk to you about something he thinks is important, pout, sleep say "I don't want to now"    if you make plans carry them out with or without him that will show him you mean what you say..and plan on doing it either way.  stick to your guns|`|LLeQyWGcaa	one can only put up with this behavior for so long. i am guessing he is or was a mommy's boy. i would consider counseling, and if he doesn't agree to go, tell him you are not going to put up with this behavior and are going to get on with your life. You want a man around the house, not a 5 year old. if he cannot be the man you need, you will find one who is. and soon.|`|IrCHNSNHaa	That is quite immature of him.  It's like a little kid saying "I don't wanna play with you guys no more!" because he's not getting his way.  Next time he does it, let him sulk and go out and enjoy yourself with friends. Don't let his lack of maturity ruin your day.  If he wants to waste his time, let him.|`|JtVG9Oamaa	I have the same problem in some way.  What I do is I get up and do what has to be done and the guilt sets in I guess sometime cause he follows to help.
Qq0naOf5aa	Yes It is Normal. My Boyfriend and I were the same. But it eventually Progressed, and now we talk about everything. There are still the occasional aquard silence, but it you will definately get closer in time, and it won't seem like your "just friends" anymore. =)    Hope this Helped.|`|JhrdIVBgaa	It is really normal. You have only been dating for a few days so no need to rush. Just take it slow, if you try to move to fast he might feel uncomfortable and not want to be with you. Just always remember that you need to take love slow if you don't the you get caught up.|`|nLiCiRnSaa	yeah. I think its because you're both self-conscience about what the other will think.    You guys are going out!!! You like eachother so why not just open up?  Give him 10 uncensored questions! It'll be fun and you guys get to know eachother better with maybe a few laughs on the way|`|sCbNP39daa	yes its normal, if u've been friends for a while it takes time to get used too|`|Yu5AfOlXaa	To be honest, it just kind of sounds like you guys don't have a connection as "boyfriend and girlfriend".  I've been there, and it's no fun.    But to be honest, it sounds like you might be better as friends. But keep up trying to keep those awkward silences away, and hopefully things will get better.     Good luck, sweetie.|`|eN5xA6RKaa	youve only been dating a couple days, obviously its not going to feel like a relationship yet, give it time.|`|ojNHRsj7aa	this happens all the time. its normal to feel like your still friends. it takes a while to get used to the idea of you dating a friend. wait another week or two [:
H9AlDTZOaa	just go for it... your a senior like me so u dont want to look back with any regrets
a8uM21jyaa	You nd me both hun you nd me both    I know it doesn't help    But i always seem to crush on guys who are way out of my league, always.    Nd ive only had 2 proper crushes.    =[

fTbYEKGuaa	I would just tell him straight up. Even though it will be SUPER hard, that's what I did with my BGF and even though he didn't like me, it made us closer. If he likes you, that will be great, but if he doesn't, if he is nice, then you guys can still stay friends :D Good luck!    Hugs&kisses,  Adrian|`|vNzc4RnAaa	woah, i was in the same thing this year  but the other way around. how to get my best girl friend  anyway dont do what i did, and that was wait to long. i was scared i would lose her, even though i liked her so much i didnt want to tell her because i wasnt positive, and i didnt want things to be weird or different. dont wait, do something. you can make him like you and he might already
TXSn9VwAaa	look him in the eyes then look down at his lips look at them for like a second then look back at his eyes, it usually works. it did for me anyway. good luck.|`|Vf5OnZ4Caa	when you apprach him/meet him wherever you guys are meeting just putt your arms around him look him in his eyes and just kiss him! its not very difficult.
7TQ5qGWcaa	Tell him to F O C  and if you want to know what it means  e mail me
vAR22hz4aa	yeah, just let him know you want to go as friends.
nLiCiRnSaa	omfg. besides dying, rejection is my like worst fear.     I would actually say that you DID like her. And see her opinion when you tell/told her that.|`|hmAA75lnaa	Tell her that you actually do like her. Maybe she was asking because she likes you too.|`|TZmzjFGzaa	Just tell her what you just told us!    "I was so afraid of getting rejected or ruining our friendship that I said no,... damm :( this was a horrible day.... "|`|b1b6e3d33b1a99da35a245dd5c6cae76aa	Well then CALLL her and tell her how you feel.  And that your afraid to get rejected. It's so much better to just get it out and tell the truth to her rather than having her think your a jerk.    I'd call her/message her w/e you gotta do but do it soon and explain everything.|`|AA10397687	sounds like you've had a confusing day.and you're stupid. we like it when guys tell us they like us. and usually we'll only ask a guy if he likes us because we like them. . .even if we deny it.
QM2UqZmuaa	Don't worry about shyness in front of a lot of people.    By the way, there's a fine line between being shy, and simply having nothing to say. The 2 are not the same.    If you have nothing to say, then of course whatever you say will be dismissed as irrelevant. If something falls out of a guy's bag, and you shout "Hey you dropped that," how could you be perceived as shy?    And so and so forth.|`|AA10471659	You sound like I was at your age, just thinking of walking up to a stranger and talking got me almost panicking. I changed with my first job. I had to talk with dozens of people every time I worked. There was no time to get nervous. Join a club at school and work with others in the group you don't know first. What changes is you find out that most people are not intimidating, they try to be friendly, like you do. This took a couple weeks and unless it was a super model type, they were just people to me, like your friends in a way, but not that personal. You just have to do it and forget your fears , most don't bite. good luck, I know the feeling|`|gC8xO53Oaa	Start by always keeping a smile on your face when you run across someone and it won't be long until they will be coming up to you because you seem approachable. I was always shy too, but the more I appeared friendly with my smile, people felt comfortable around me and thus I felt good around them. It's just a process to come out of the shyness and before you know it, you'll feel more comfortable with yourself and that develops confidence.|`|2PTzgYuvaa	practice, practice, practice  start by making eye contact for two seconds [do that for a day]  days 2-10 say hi to at least 10 people include eye contact|`|vstLWg0Uaa	don't worry be happy!!!|`|YyMFDs6Eaa	ohhh..you have the curse too...i'm the exact same as you--like down to the freshman thing--but i do have a cell phone...anyways be patient, you'll get a bf, guys do like kinda shy girls and some think it's cute when we blush|`|I4uIOp1maa	im 15, never had a bf  im quite shy too an its rli hard to tlk to ppl especialy boys  not joking, you should do meditating or joga  im doing it at school an ive made new m8s and im more confident and happy with myself.   gd luck|`|wIlNAKUwaa	I was the same way and it took my boyfriend of 5 years breaking up with me and just being out around people and forcing myself to talk to everyone. the blushing went away and I could go up to anyone. get a job in as a waitress you are then forced to talk to people you don't know. that's what I did and it made me a lot less shy. it takes time you just have to do things no matter if your face turns red it gets better i promise.
Slr6jtMGaa	ok...i think she's flirting with you....|`|uzYHWdgPaa	she sounds immature and spacey... furthermore she seems like she'd be needy if your relationship progressed. and she waited around for this other guy for 16 months? Definitely needy!
WPbwiGafaa	choose the best guys|`|UZsSWMupaa	well you need to hang out with your boyfriend more for one thing and you need to stop hanging out so much with this other guy. If this guy asks you to go out to the mall just tell him not tonite i am busy. Once you start to hang out more with your boyfriend you will begin to like your boyfriend way more and your friend that you hang out with will eventually begin to drown away and you won't like him but only like him as a friend|`|mINKANlAaa	um, thats terrible. go with the one you like the most and stop hanging out so much with the one your not with. if your bf notices hes gonna dump you because he'll think your cheating on him.     and please type clear sentences next time. geezz|`|9b6e3856ff9fd505bdf5544026fe01dfaa	nice!!!|`|DAfCatspaa	Well obviously go with the one that you like more.

4cc625c81315e3cc57858f7de7250b2aaa	Honey, you are experiencing what a lot of us did at your age.  When you catch a girl's eye and she looks away from you, it could mean one of two things:  (1) she's not interested, or (2) she is just as shy as you are.  Bet you didn't think about that second possibility, did you...?  You are assuming every single female is rejecting you, and my guess is that it's just not the case.  If you are good-looking, a lot of females get intimidated by that as well, especially if they have low self-esteem.  You have become "gruff and cold" to try to protect your ego, which is bruised right now.  You're telling yourself that if you don't put yourself out there, you won't get hurt.  Well, that's true, but you also won't attract girls with that attitude either.  We all get rejected (or reject someone else who might be interested in us).  Take heart, pull down some of those barriers, and try again.  And by the way, don't try to single out one female from a pack of women.  It usually doesn't work!  Good luck to you!|`|AA12130542	I dont think these people are rejecting you. Do you remember walking down the halls at school, and seeing someone you know and you look them in the eye and do that sort of upwards nod which means "hey hows it going" when you arent going to stop and talk to them? Its a way of acknowledging someone, letting someone know you see them but you dont have to talk. Just making eye contact is not enough. Smiling isnt enough. Personally, id try sticking my tongue out at people. If they stick their tongue out back at you, then go talk to them. And if they look away, well, its probably because you just stuck your tongue out at them. People are busy. They are wrapped up in their own lives. Most of them arent rejecting you, they just arent thinking about it. and women are very wary these days. Be nice, be funny, talk to them. if they tell you that they arent interested in talking, back off and let it go. Women are taught that it is rude to stare. so even if you make eye contact and smile at a girl, if she thinks youre cute, she will still break eye contact. but if she looks back at you a few times after that, shes probably curious. go talk to her.|`|YqoxcTN9aa	keep doing it, youjust havent met the right people yet|`|wyWPbnsKaa	Keep at it. You just haven't done it to the right gal yet. Don't lose hope! Being happy and enthusiastic is a better way of attracting a girls attention then being turned in. So of the two, being an extrovert is your better bet.|`|o5rfI7oUaa	Same here man i really dont know wat to say but all i will ssay is that i feel you on this one... I dunno say something i guess but u never know how a girl feels..|`|rGip5hMEaa	we are all confused by women.even the women are|`|OuQizrQ6aa	It can be difficult to overcome social anxiety and the fear of rejection, but if you don't find some confidence then your genes will be unapologetically weeded out of existence.|`|UvJ9mPlZaa	That's tough I am also an introvert but I guess it is easier for women as men tend to come to us.  A lot of introverts lack confidence or at least the sort of outer confidence that extroverts have. Try to develop a quiet inner confidence. You can so that by accepting who you are and not feeling like you have to be different to get other to like you. If you are really introvert you will probably be better suited to an introvert girlfriend.  If you have any special interests why not join a club and get to know girls who share that interest in that way.  Good luck!|`|WLWojBO4aa	they day you will understand women is the day this world will end. till then dont even try figuring them out. jsut do your thing. but deff dont cut yourself out from other people , if you do in the end you will just be lonely and depressed.|`|sIhPpdv3aa	First off, the reason some people don't respond is because THEY are afraid of being rejected by YOU. Stay consistent and above it all. They may come around    Second, don't be afraid of rejection. You can't please all of the people all of the time. It's impossible.    There was a study once where a person gave a presentation to a crowd and the people were given a questionnaire where they were asked, "do you like the presenter as a person?" 1/3 liked him, 1/3 did not, 1/3 were undecided. They were asked to give reasons.    Then the presenter did the presentation for a different crowd, this time changing everything the haters suggested. the result the second time was: 1/3 liked him, 1/3 didn't, 1/3 were undecided. That's with him trying his hardest to please everyone!    People are gonna like you or not like you. Sometimes it doesn't matter what you do. The key is not to think it's the end of the world when someone doesn't appreciate you.    One thing that's 100% is if you don't try, you don't get anything. If you tell everyone you hate them and yourself with your tone of voice or body language they will believe you. They think you don't even want to give yourself the time of day, so why should they?    If you decided you want to give people a chance, the best way to attract people is by being confidant and liking yourself. Tell them with your tone of voice and body language that you are worth something no matter what they say or do and people will believe you. Some may even want to be around that more often and try to get to know you.    Good luck.|`|tSlcfCI3aa	it doesn't matter if some people don't seem to notice you.  keep trying and try to hang out more with sociable/friendly people.|`|92n13q98aa	you have no confidence in yourself, that's the problem. Don't try to understand women because they're all insane. Just try to understand yourself and the rest will come with time.|`|8AaPQONGaa	Find a chick in you're league.  Actually talk to her :D  Don't look like an ***.  Go out for a while  Get laid.  Then marry her or repeat with another girl ;D  lmao.|`|alaUYtRcaa	well are you lying? maybe your personality doesnt appeal to the girls you like.. maybe you should try going down a social class|`|VWcJzia1aa	Maybe you need to not listen to others advice. Take what they say and change it into what you are comfortable with. Dont just stare at women in a crowd. Online dating, going out to places in public and making small tlk, or trying to find intrest in women who are already your friends are the best ways to go. I believe that everyone has a special someone, just not everyone looks for it.  I hope you look and find your girl!  Go for it.  Hope i helped! ;]|`|PrJLPaHfaa	Be nice on a regular basis.  Say hi...smile...things like that  ...but don't be a creep and start talking to them if they're obviously not interested|`|Oua88nRiaa	I think that it's all trial and error. I feel the same way you do. Although it is always said that guys should make the first move, I fine myself wanting to make the first move sometimes. However, I get scared of doing so lol. so i know exactly how you feel! i've done it before and nothing has happened, but obviously not everyone is gonna be into you; let's just get that straight. but obviously, some WILL be, and that's even better lol. and women really aren't all that confusing----guys are the confusing ones! haha, but no, just trial and error baby: trial and error. hope that helps!|`|1nhauvRsaa	You need Jesus! Lol...seriously tho...you do! He will take those feelings that are cold and unwanted...you just have to learn about Him and His character and what He has done for you...But aside from that, don't buy into the shallow idea that you have to meet total strangers etc etc...doesn't always work that way...that's why so many marriages fail nowadays, becuase people marry other people they didn't even really know...Make friends brother and live your life!|`|tufHFOv0aa	Honestly I think you should be yourself with your friends, and be yourself but more polite when meeting people for the first time. That's always a good way to start. Then I think you'll see what attracts others. Don't listen to other people talking about putting yourself out there. You figure things out with you first and then worry about others later. Good Luck.   btw, judging by your question, i can see you want to change. In my opinion, the only way to change something is to focus on it. Notice when you're about to be cold to others and then just say something different. I really hope it works out for you.|`|YqsND3Wmaa	Nothing    is    sexier    than    confidence|`|tb49Xw5maa	Don't try to act like someone you're not. You probably haven't met a girl that thinks introvert guys are hot yet. You'll find a girl who does, just don't worry about it. That's how i am too.|`|lB0Fd93Naa	I'm the same way, only female and in high school.  Think Kelly Clarkson's "Miss Independent" song, and you've got me.  I'm working on just being myself, which is rather bubbly and eccentric, because when I tried to be like others and flirt and outgoing, I got frustrated and gave up, hiding.  Now Im just myself, and more people like to be around me.      It can be tough around new people, especially if you've got a VERY outgoing friend who befriends them and makes you feel like a third wheel.   I'd say just let that great personality shine through, but don't "put yourself out there" if it isn't natural to you.  There's nothing wrong with making people feel like it's a priviledge to get to know you.    Good luck and I hope you find the right person soon!|`|gbYVF1A5aa	I also had that problem..It changed automatically at my Degree course  At first you need a self confidence, u said that ur good looking and smart.  then u try to make self confidence . its everything..  Do u feel shy to talk to ur friends.? when u talk to a women, u think that she is a friend of yours. look at her eyes and talk to her. u r able to do that.. It worked fine for me... believe me ...|`|BLgR6tDVaa	My advice is to do something that stands out. What you do depends on where you are. Respectable women love nice guys who do random nice acts. Just smiling at someone and saying hi won't do it because that act is so common that it is not unique enough to really strike up any really interest.|`|c815f0954f0cc607a22f3e49bfd31b48aa	Women like MEN. Men do the chasing. If a woman turns you down, move on to the next one. It's a numbers game. The more people you approach, the more likely someone is to respond.|`|ivhojwpTaa	Every man out there is confused about women. Be yourself, and the right woman will notice you. My husband's a tall, skinny, geeky kind of guy, and I always here other guys saying, "How did that guy score that hottie?" He was himself, and didn't try being something he wasn't, you do the same, and you'll get a girl.|`|WFRooU7Maa	Women are just confusing  They are like a conundrum    Don't even try to understand them, because it probably is wrong  and is impossible anyways|`|wXV5GxJHaa	that is NOT your fault. if ANYONE smiled at me i would never just ignore them. i dont care who they are. thats just plain rude. you'll find someone someday dont worry. but dont try and shut people out!!!! it wont do you any good.
8jxoTBWIaa	Pretend like its nothing. Just dont worry about it. I know it might be awkward but youll get past it =]|`|VZPtCkweaa	pretend it doesn't bother you.
jWAzxHGvaa	Men get tired because it builds up and builds up and releases, it takes a lot for their body to produce sperm. Women on the other hand are more awake afterward, almost completely wound up. Well I am after that is for sure.|`|SBEAOwdJaa	depends.
0sPQnq7oaa	Sure he will ask you out!...  If he's into you, that is.  Seems like you're probably in the beginning stages of the dating game.  If you are, there is a possibility that he is into you.  Sure, chivalry might be dying, or on its last weak breath, but a guy still usually feels obligated to ask a girl out.   That's just the way it is.  I mean, you COULD ask HIM out,  but isn't it nice to be asked out instead?  If this isn't the beginning of your flirty/whatever thingy you've got going on, and its been a few months or something, chances are he is not into you enough to want you to be his girlfriend.|`|iEf87pU9aa	just ask him, that's what i did, and he said yes|`|b7gUW0CRaa	he will cause thats the guys job.or u can ask him out urself.|`|xKX23XZTaa	If he don't then I'll will. lol    Ask what he thinks about you. If he wants to be more than friends he'll let you know. Just ask.|`|eWTjH5U9aa	Whats wrong with you asking him?|`|d49ZA5xYaa	just ask him out|`|zr2W7mEWaa	trust me im a boy i know this hes nervous about the whole thing~!
8p31dENPaa	To me it means that you have to emotionally and mentally put yourself out there, take a risk.|`|ee16bd6fa8f2d93667b5d5f76c2e7c8caa	it means to get out there and go where the girls are. Think outside the box. Bars and clubs are fine, but often not places to find relationship material. Red cross meetings are good...expand on that. There are a lot of women interested in civic types of groups...also, groups associated with the arts would be good places to find women. Take a class in something that traditionally attracts women. As one of the few men there, you may find yourself in high demand! Plus woman love to be helpful, so ask one that interests you if she can tutor you.|`|2ee7c7cc26d963adf4e22da471543493aa	It sounds like you are already out there.|`|yRRnbNqXaa	It means to start meeting girls and/or start dating. but where can you go to meet girls i can't tell you. Best at places you like hanging out because if you meet someone at such a place, you already have something in common. So, if you like working out, but not reading, it's better to start dating someone you met at a gym than a library. So just keep going to the places you've been going but keep your eyes open for cute girls :) good luck
MQ1QVNXbaa	I personally would go to the semi formal with the guy.  Just tell the girl you forgot you told your guy friend you were going with him to a dance.    She shouldn't be mad about it.  Just get her a card and give it to her next time you see her. Write happy b-day. sorry I couldn't make it. or something like that.|`|AA10682878	I would go to your best guy's because   1. he's one of ur best friends and also you never know it could turn into something.    Or unless the girl who invited you is a really good friend then i would go to hers.    But i would most likely go to the semi formal.    Hope i Helped  Dannii?x|`|AA10890553	It seems pretty clear that you want to go to the semiformal.  Well, if you don't know the girl that well then just say you have other plans, but if you're close then I'm sure you can explain to her how you feel about this guy.  Good luck!
GZ9iMWr8aa	i didnt have mine til i was 17 and i am glad i waited|`|B1WxEIyXaa	However long it takes you to find the person you actually care about.|`|Oua88nRiaa	honey, there isn't really a GOOD age for a first REAL kiss, althought it's fair to say that this happens within the ages of 14-17 ish? I got mine when I was 15 and i thought i was late lol. it's all just about when your friends had their first real kiss that makes us feel this way. it'll happen soon enough, but just don't waste it on any old guy, 'cause i feel like most of the people i know didnt like their first kiss lol. hope this instilled some hope or thought into you! good luck =)|`|wTqEOvqSaa	u cant rele determine wen a "first kiss" should happen. if u worry about it to much then it wnt happen wen its supposed to. let things go naturally, and if you end up getting a kiss out of it, then thats great. not everyone has that perfect first kiss.. so dnt always expect that. and even if ur first kiss with someone goes bad, jus kno that that kiss was a first kiss with that person..and the next person you'll be able to expierence a first kiss with them and it could be way better.   good luck|`|UvJ9mPlZaa	I think 14+ is a good age. Just wait till it feels right when you meet a boy you really like you will know.|`|PPKuHl9baa	You're doing good so far. Keep it up. You should have your first real kiss at no time before 16. Don't take anything further until your 18. Don't give in to pressure or you'll be labeled at a young age.
37bc2448f8a416f89ef2fc28bd18e67eaa	yea of course|`|AJ0X3j57aa	yeah you should have no problem. any guys between 18-21 who wants to date someone younger than 17 is just a little weird. thats kinda perverted.|`|B1WxEIyXaa	Go for who you like.. not who's older then you.  I'm 17 and so is my gf.|`|2dV79LHiaa	When i was 17 i was dating a 22 year old. he was ok. and when i turned 18 i was dating a 30 year old! but just keep in mind everyone is different! and keep in mind you have to stay within for 4 years of your age. well i know thats the law in florida! but i think its fine to date someone that old. not every guy wants somone younger.|`|djm2X1USaa	depends on the guy =]|`|LpjcqpZIaa	of course you can get a boyfriend. not all guys are the same, lots of them even like older women! just be yourself, be confident and everything else will follow.. good luck girl!! ;)|`|nZ4cOSDZaa	yes don't worry about it and good luck|`|sARTaNLNaa	well, i started dating when i was 17. and as of guys liking girls of younger age, i feel its a personal choice of that guy. some prefer younger and some prefer girls of their same age, and some even prefer elder girls.    what i would like to tell you is, when you choose a guy, be sure about it, and make it a point that that guy is a good guy. not lecturing you, but this is really bad bad, u do need to be careful.    njoy, bye!|`|wscyjkPAaa	WOW really, you think guys from 18 - 21 like girls younger than 17.  Hmmm Thats a little weird. I think you'll be able to get a boyfriend if you want.  If you're hanging out with guys 18 - 21 who are chasing 15 year olds, I think its time to get new guy friends.|`|RiGSq1r6aa	Yes, you can :)  17 is a good age|`|GLBWe3A9aa	First of all you have your own age range, so yeah.  And there's always a year younger or 1 -  2 years older.  Being 17 doesn't make you unattractivee|`|Gp4AP971aa	yessss it can happen.|`|fOOKtEhFaa	i got my first boyfriend when i was 15.  im 17 now, & before me & my ex got back together this last christmas i dated a 26yr. old.|`|cKeghBi7aa	no you can get a boyfriend...  guys only go for younger girls because they are easy and when they only want to fool around... they dont go for younger girls for serious relationships|`|M3CsxF2jaa	gal i started dating when i was 15 he was 19 you will regret it. go with your own age so they wont take advantage of you.|`|gHIEbYM9aa	Well ya of course i have a little sister who got her first boy friend when she was 15|`|sCr2iTczaa	nah they would date you... i know guys that age well some of them aren't in to jail bate, but when i was your age i had a 21 year old bf. well actually he wasn't really a bf but almost was. so go for it don't be shy|`|caArlzCvaa	um i dont think u can date over 18 when ur 17. u have to be 18 to date over the age of 18.|`|JEqt3dDRaa	of course you have a chace!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|f9dRts2zaa	some guys prefer girls the same age.|`|YqoxcTN9aa	everyone has their own preferences, just wait & see what happens|`|wwEnL5tBaa	Anyone can get a boyfriend, no matter how old you are.|`|3uls2NlXaa	are you saying your too old??  omg not even! your not even in your prime...ofcoarse you can date, your still 16, that is so not old|`|67ThRN4Taa	I have two sons ages 19 & 21 that would ***love*** to meet you!  :)  I don't suppose that you live in the Houston, Texas area?  They drive me nuts but they're good guys; both in college, no vices.    Otherwise, yes, you should have no problem getting a boyfriend.  May not happen overnight.  The very best of luck to you.|`|yXGlmUqlaa	yes of course. alot of guys like girls of those ages because they are more mature.    i've never heard of this being a problem before|`|FVDTXM68aa	Oh sweetie!! You will definitely find a guy!! I found my Love when I was 16, and I am now 22 (he is 25)! We are engaged! Hun, you WILL find a great guy! Just have fun hanging out with your friends. I met my man at one of my friend's family's parties! Always have your eyes open, and DON'T be shy in approaching guys! That's what I did, and I got the guy! Be yourself, have fun, and live life! Trust me, it will happen when you LEAST expect it! (I found my man when I had a bf; he was away at college! I went to my friend's party and fell in love with my Prince Charming! The rest is history!!). Good Luck!! Seriously, everything will work out!! :) It always does!!!
YqoxcTN9aa	to young|`|844DGAMmaa	Alllllmost legal.     Almost.

DqTO1dBVaa	She's just not that into you.  She is being very L (lame).  Why would you want to be with someone who disrespects you this way? and who is obviously embarrassed to be with you? Kick it to the curb, pronto. You deserve to be treated like you matter.|`|7a2e4d4207a92f423c9e8649aceaf762aa	Any person that would tell there friends that your a loser is not the girl for you. She should be proud walking with you , and not treating you like a court jester (JOKER) if you were my son i would tell you to dump the bit@  ASAP! Why are you allowing for her to treat you this way? She is not the only girl you can get, so look for one that has more class she sounds like a real tramp to me, young man you deserve better.|`|AJ0X3j57aa	girls act differently around their friends just like guys do. maybe just let her hang out with her friends for a while and not join her. a girl needs some time to be with her girl friends.|`|JKZUdhCPaa	Girls act differently around their friends. She probably loves you but feels awkward for some reason. You should tell her that's its okay if she just wants to be with her friends.|`|t58tRjwbaa	wow. well, there is a couple at our school and the girl does the SAME thing. she always is making him look like a fool, and I feel for him. idc if she's playing or not, sometimes you just don't do that stuff! if my bf did that, i would dump him. i think you should talk to her about it, and let her know it really bothers you. stand up for yourself! if she pops off about it, or doesn't care, and therefore doesn't change-- be with someone that knows what they have when they have you.
ILw3Rw3Jaa	Hmm, well it depends on you relationship with this girl    if your good friends then try act confident (even if your nervous) and start up a conversation about prom. then kind of hint and say you dont have a date and 'we should go together'  that worked on my friend last year ;)  hope that helps x|`|ubk21UBvaa	this would be really cute:    get a fish, betta fish are really pretty, and put it in a bowl with a note that says "your the only fish in the sea for me, will you go to prom with me?" put it in her locker, or her house.|`|jXAJZ23Saa	hmmm, well my proms comming up and the guy that asked me just started the convo talking about prom and i knew exacly what he was gonna ask so i was nice back to him and carried on the conversation.    i would start off talking about prom and how u dont know how ur getting there yet, does she? and who is she going with?    id kind of bring it up like that, and there arent any confidence tips really, just dont stutter. if she says no it wont be the worst thing in the world but im sure sheel say yes anyway ;)    good luck xx|`|WRRRChiaaa	Just something surprising. that she wouldn't expect you to do. take her out to dinner, and bring her back to your house .. if you have a nice backyard, drop rose petals on the ground, and light candles. and lead her back there. Have a sign that says.. 'Prom?' :]|`|FyyJ6lpbaa	well start talking to her, she might even like you back,   u can start with a hug, alota guys who like a girl hug them to show theyr a likable person, i get hugs from guys and i find out like the next day that he likes me...   and if she hugs back well thats good because then she'l start to get some hints..talk to her more  you could use some more physical contact for hints  and when you guys really get to know each other and u see her flirting back then just go for it  i hope i helped  good luck! =]|`|uRWhrmBPaa	I think it's cute when guys r nervous 2 ask out a girl! Start hanging around her more and flirt with her. Maybe even put your arm around her seat, but not really on her. I am not very confident when it comes 2 asking out guys, but when I get the guts up 2 do it, I just keep telling myself that I am a beautiful n smart individual no matter what he says or does. You kinda just have 2 get up as much guts as u can n just go for it. Whenever I go 4 it, I never regret it. Last but not least, just be yourself.  If you follow my tips, I am sure she will say yes n go 2 prom with u. Good luck!|`|Lq9Q1rAgaa	flirt with her by laughing at her jokes and making jokes yourself. try doing something that will get you noticed. then when it feels right to you, ask her out. hope this helps, good luck x|`|rhXKnirZaa	tell her she smells like fish|`|FaSzWvF2aa	Well I'd get a good idea if she likes you or not before asking her, just so you're positive she'll say yes. If you're friends with her already, just kick it up a notch. Go out of your way to be nice to her, compliment her, maybe buy her lunch one day... the little things tend to add up, girls analyze them a lot :). And yes, you're right to be worried about confidence- that's the first thing girls see. Before you talk to her, give yourself a pep talk about all the things you like about yourself as a person. If you're happy with yourself, she'll see that. Taking pride in your appearance shows confidence too, so make sure you're showered and ready to go (though I'm sure you would be anyway).    If after all that you think she likes you and would say yes, think of a creative way. Decorate her car or her locker, go up to her after school with a rose and ask her... most girls love public displays of affection like that, we are always looking for more romance in our lives. However keep in mind that even after all that, she might say no. So don't let your hopes get too high.
UXf6g6Sjaa	The foot fetish is one of the most common fetishes of all. Many guys have it. It can be fun for both partners, a lot of women like getting foot massages and wearing cute shoes.    Almost nobody has a hand fetish, though. The reason is that the nerves from the feet connect to an area of the brain that is real close to the nerves from the penis. And there is some crosstalk between the two systems.    It is silly to dump a guy because he has a fetish. Fetishes are fun!|`|ewDmdXAYaa	okay so there was this guy who was like a friend of a friend or something and well we knew each other and started chatting and stuff and yeah, well he seemed really nice and stuff so i agreed to go on a date with him....  everything was fine until we got to this bar/restaurant kinda thing and he actually asked me to take off my shoes (luckily just ballarinas but still!) so i did it thinking it was some stupid joke or that we were about to play a silly prank for which he needed my shoes or something but then he like bent down and just stared at my feet and told me they were really beautiful.... soooo weird!.... ontop of that he took a ******* photo of my feet! i was kinda really freaked out so yeah... you might have guessed never dated again^^|`|t8rKgXLyaa	Yeah my guy. I rub him off with them, wear shoes for him, and squish his stuff between my toes. Of course its a two way street when I want something too...|`|INJSpV4haa	It's the world's second most common fetish (right after a fetish for breasts). Nothing wrong with it, and certainly no reason to dump a guy.    However, I would say that the guy your sister met was really forward for a first date, but I would say whether it was feet or legs or breasts he was into.    So the only question left is: does Leggy Brunette have an available single sister????   GRIN|`|aR23OWgBaa	I have a foot fetish and totally agree with CJ.  It's common, harmless and fun. Stop being so puritanical, stiff, and immature.
vNzc4RnAaa	yeah, if he tries standing closer to you than normal  makes fun of you harmlessly  slips in compliments sometimes  is really nice to you
cYRZpGkqaa	it's the drinking. women just aren't that into alcoholics. and you are an alcoholic if you drink every day.|`|4293T0LNaa	it could be the mary jane or ur alcohol problem. women have enough problems to worry about, they dont want some fine as.s alcoholic pot head,|`|A7r8xX7saa	They get what they want and move on. They got their party with you and then went somewhere else.|`|WLWojBO4aa	Lol seems to me that we have the same problem. i guess bitchs just dont know what they wnat now adays. dont worry playa she will come one day. i still have faith that mines out there and i been with over 20 girls already. even posted the same question. guess it just takes time to find the right one.     PS -- send me some of that weed man, maybe we smoke together and go hunting for some *****|`|3bu2QCfnaa	The alcohol part could be a big possibility. And you have two jobs? They probably feel like they could never settle down because you'd have no time for them and just because you shower them in gifts doesnt make someone fall in love with you. Girls wanna feel like theyll always be the top thing in your life and wana be protected. If your going to party everynight and work two jobs theres no room there for a relationship.|`|ibRjKfvBaa	Well aside for the drinking part, excessive drinking equals not serious. They probably dump you because they get tired of the party, non- serious relationship. You can have the party end, but still have a serious side with a girl. The excessive partying probably become bothersome and annoying after a while.|`|FoLpmJ3Waa	Maybe they don't like smokers, alcoholics, and people who say they are "drop dead sexy"...|`|FG7e47UMaa	because you sound like an alcoholic.... you do drugs....you sound extremely big headed is that enough : )  x|`|bl7ZzF9saa	-I'm generous. I spoil them and unlike other guys, I pay for all of the dates.    Me: There are some things you cant buy. Ya know what I mean? If not, think about it.      -I LOVE to get drunk, in fact, I drink every day of my life. Unlike most other guys.    ME: Maybe they get sick of the fact that they barely get a chance to talk to you sober? Could it be possible that you care more about drinking than the girl?    -And I'm drop dead sexy....    ME: Cocky? There's confident and then there's cocky. You're 19?.........You have enough experience to know where to draw the line.          Sit back and take a look at yourself. Think about some of the problems that your chracteristics can create...not just for you, but for possible girlfriends too.
SdsUbqGqaa	I'm sorry but I have to side with you on this one! We can't watch over our kids 24/7 but since your kids don't want him coming anyways then you need to support  your kids and back then up! I feel that it's important for your kids to feel free to come to you for anything, silly or otherwise  and by supporting them you gain TRUST.|`|y4U1WHpnaa	I see both sides. However, I would say you are NOT over reacting in any way. You have every right to care about the protection of your son before any one else's child. But Maybe your husband just feels so bad that he cant do anything else except try to care for him. Wish you both the best.|`|0LHzaIuCaa	I don't understand.  If your son doesn't even want to play with him, why is there a need for him to come over?    I would explain to your son about sex (at least as much as you're willing to) and explain that what the kid did was wrong.    As far as your husband is concerned, I guess talk to him about it.  If the kid comes over and wants to play, just tell him sorry but you need to go home.  You don't have to be mean about it.  You gotta do what you gotta do.|`|8CTosi9saa	Your not overreacting, I would make sure that your son knows to just walk away from this kid if he tries to abuse him again. Maybe your husband was abused and he's tring to help this kid.|`|8ac2e5cbdd946ee60c803052559873c5aa	I'm sorry you're having to deal with this at all.  I'm sorry for that other child.  But I agree with you 100%.  My child comes first.    Your husband is being calm about the whole thing and you should probably be grateful that he didn't react strongly and half-kill the kid.  But he is over the line to expect the friendship to continue.    You need to call the state and inform them of what occurred, I'm sorry to tell you.  That boy needs serious professional help because he is on his way to becoming a rapist himself.|`|T4N6a7MQaa	You are toward your husband. You're assuming everyone has the necessary skills to handle this sort of situation. They don't. Cut him a little slack dear.|`|AA10500537	no youre not overreacting . i would not allow my children around this child.,  i would also speak to the parents and school and let them know|`|LNSiLxlBaa	I understand what you're saying completely. While it is sad that the child was exposed to such a horrendous situation, you also have to think of protecting your child. Why the hell is your husband ok with some kid coming over that clearly could have damaged YOUR child? Your husband sounds like a *****. You're not over-reacting. I think you were right to stop the child from coming over.
WKYO5oxdaa	I think it is bad but boys will be boys. If it really bothers you, then you should tell him to choose you or the porn and see what really matters to him more|`|PPFonRYdaa	He has probably been looking at porn from day one. Trust me. You have nothing to worry about.|`|oojO4WAraa	No, that is just what guys do.|`|YgPYv4OPaa	its natural for guys to watch porn .  it doesnt mean that anythings wrong in the relationship . but maybe he wants something more ? idk ,|`|ZqAufNvmaa	guys will look at it no matter what.  sadly..theres like no way to stop it!  maybe for a little bit but its almost guarenteed they always will go back to watching it..    i guess they like to have both??|`|AA10531094	No, he probably was doing it all along.  No, it means he likes porn.|`|TPBfzLqjaa	No maybe he always did and just never told you. But be careful b/c that's how you get viruses and things on your computer.|`|54d31d8ca1d93393903fc5f7a7334431aa	No. And I bet he's been looking at it the whole time.|`|844DGAMmaa	It has nothing to do with your relationship.     He was probably watching porn WAY before you met him.|`|K8lxbOdqaa	no i love my baby and our relationship is great..i watch porn doesnt mean anything...would u rather have him watch porn or cheat? thought so..|`|Ra6RZyDfaa	it means ur not giving him enough.|`|CUUjvakpaa	yup but give him sex and he will stop or he wants to get new moves for u|`|jLLkSWyiaa	haha no its not bad .. i love watching it with my boyfriend .. it turns me on =]|`|RncUc0traa	no men watch it for fun and to learn new technique|`|q1pwHXrMaa	No it just means it took you 4 months to catch on he was watching porn. haha    Guy watch porn....always. They could have the best relationship/sex life in the world and still watch porn.|`|GogRchzsaa	Its natural for guys to watch porn.|`|qMhLcn8Gaa	What's bad is you thought he wasn't watching porn before.|`|8AaPQONGaa	nah.  we just like porn :3|`|SAhAc8EXaa	He's probably been looking at it since you've been going out. I doubt it has anything to do with you.|`|92n13q98aa	Umm, he's been looking at porn since day one. Don't take it personally. If you think there's something wrong with your sex life, then work at it.. Do something spontaneous or find out what he likes.|`|0L4jmetAaa	ive been with my partner for about 14 years and i watch porn when home alone|`|FaSzWvF2aa	Nah. Guys watch porn. It's just what they do.|`|tnNEyKSgaa	hey theres nothing wrong   its normal with guys  i think u shud give him some more time n u two shud spend some more time with eachother  theres nothing wrong in the relationship  be cool|`|b5DvGJbqaa	Do not threat, it's normal.|`|Oa4mEs6faa	You said it...boys will be boys! thats all there is to it. My bf  (baby daddy) of 2 and a half years watches porn on a daily basis doesnt matter if im home wide awake sleeping or at work he watches. Nothing is wrong with your relationship he is just curious and guys always love porn. But the bright side of it is, least its on the screen and fantasy to him and not him going out and cheating. Depending on his age he may just have a high sex drive as well but like i said rather it be porn and not some other girl right??|`|SuOfQc5Gaa	IT MEANS NOTHING MAYBE HE WAS JUST DOING RESEARCH TO FIND OUT NEW THINGS TO TRY WITH YOU...PLUS THEY ARE PORNO GIRLS I MEAN WHAT MAN ACTUALLY WANTS TO GET WITH A PORNO GIRL THEY ARE NASTY AND THERE'S NOTHING U CAN DO WITH THEM THEY AIN'T ALL READY HAD DONE TO THEM.|`|kmpbOQxyaa	First, "Easy for you to say Owen. You're a guy!"    Okay. No, boys, even if they have sex every night of their lives will still probably look at porn sites. It doesn't mean anything is wrong with your relationship, he just probably got lonely, and masturbated. I mean, after all, it's not like he'll fall in love with a porn star. Unless he's secretly Borat...haha.    I wouldn't worry about it. He still loves you, I'm sure. Nothing is wrong with your relationship!|`|ej8iwJzqaa	ok, how old are you?? men like to LOOK at what they cant have- its not going to hur tthe relationship, UNLESS he calls you a different name- like maybe y'all are getting hot and heavy, and in the middle, he calls out some picture girl's name- thats a little akward-     it wouldnt hurt if maybe you'd consider looking at some with him- just think, those girls are not real.. mostly airbrushed and made over..i promise, it wasnt something i wanted to do either, but im still with the man ive been with at your stage of the "dating" game.. that was over 2 years ago..look at it with him- try new things- it is wonderful for the sex life- adds a whole new element-|`|EIfkpkSAaa	OK get the worries out right now. Its all normal and can be part of a normal healthy relationship as well. I have been married now for 18yrs. I am a man that has been watching porn way before I met my wife or any of my girlfriends and I am sure the same goes with this situation. The day he stops looking at porn is were you may have to start to worry because then he may be getting the real thing. no matter how hot a woman that a guy has he will still look at porn, its just fantasy no worries he is still with you, Good luck keep the trust going maybe offer to watch with him you never know it may take you relationship to a whole to level. Good luck|`|wAnK7clsaa	boys like to watch porn and he must be willing to have it with you
Talzm1x7aa	tell everyone he didnt rape u...
U6JvnfNVaa	i think he might like you!!!    but you know it sucks they are so confusing they can flirt with you but that doesnt mean they're interested ugh it depnds on the gut but it seems like he likes you :)|`|caArlzCvaa	Oooooooo....  sounds like he has has some intrest in yooh~|`|Jx9qRCGnaa	Just ask him out.|`|QY0ETRH0aa	I think he likes you. You should probably ask a friend or someone to see if he likes you. You never know what he will say. Oir maybe wait awhile and he may tell u if he does. Naother thing to do is ask him yoursel if he likes you.    Anyone would work. Hope it helps
AA12324049	I think you are old enough to wear your hair the way you want!  When my daughter was 13, she wanted pink stripes in her brunette hair.  I figured, "why not" at least it isn't permanent and it gives her a way of expressing herself.  She went through some other hair phases but now at 17 wears it natural and it is beautiful.  I'm glad I supported her because she got it out of her system (for now, anyway).  Tell your mom that while you love and respect her, you want to try growing your hair longer and at least you aren't asking for a piercing or a tattoo!  Is there another family member that could intervene for you and help convince your mom that this isn't such a big deal?  Good luck!|`|nWgTur4qaa	Well, I don't know if you work or not but parents usually compromise when you get a job and make money.     I know that really don't answer the question but the thing is you can't cut short hair any shorter unless you want to go bald, but when you grow it in and your peers don't like or you find out that you don't like it, you can use your own money to get it cut short again.     She seems close minded as well.|`|AEZ75dJ7aa	It sounds like you can usually talk to your mom about other things so ask her (when she's not stressed or busy) what she ment by "it will make her look bad"  Does she see all teens with long hair as rebellious and headed into trouble?  Is she afraid that people will judge you wrong because of your long hair?  Has your attitude changed lately and your friends?  She loves you and wants to protect you from this really strange, strong, destructive world out here and really does have reasons.  By asking her for a deeper explaination (in an adult way, not arguing and whining,  (yes you boys whine too! lol) you will be showing her that her opinion is important.  Then contunue to talk about why you want to make this change.  She needs and wants to see that your not going to throw your life away by following the crowd!  Hope this helps. It worked with my teens.|`|ZzEAc5ecaa	join the drama class .. then tell her you need it for a play .. ok mate
bQisGgSsaa	About 12 years old.|`|Jzzl2QAmaa	11-12|`|9jQ8QMwmaa	I'm 13, and I've pecked a guy. But that's it. I have friends who make out with their older boy friends. I'd say 13 is about right. Making out I'd wait till 14 definately. But, it really does depend about how mature your daughter is. If you think she'd get really bubbly just from a hug.... lol, then kissing would be kinda.. not good. If she can take it seriously, and all that jazz, then I wouldnt mind.|`|nLiCiRnSaa	I had mine in 7th grade.   My friends range from 6th to 9th grade.|`|VZPtCkweaa	12-14    and don't freak out on her about it!|`|0XvImpdFaa	i guess 12 becuz u have to let ur daughter have a bf becuz if you don't let her she is going to have one with out u knowing.. and might get pageant|`|T2isnQNKaa	whenever|`|sCbNP39daa	around 12-13|`|hR7fJ9y4aa	13|`|h0z5S6BSaa	When you get your first period....period.|`|HYnBeyJsaa	Personally, if you ask me I think an appropriate age would be anywhere between 14 and 16 because by then they will have enough maturity to handle something like that.|`|yGWQuL81aa	I remember a boy that had a crush on me kissed me on Valentine's day when I was 10. Sort of shocking and to young at the time. If she's 13, and she hasn't had her first kiss yet, she should make sure she really likes the guy, because thats the whole point of kissing. If so, then I think 13 would be a good age.|`|YbDCTlzWaa	Maybe she already got hetr first kiss.  95% chance.  im the 5% that hasnt.  Im 14 though.  All my friends have had kisses plenty of times.|`|KITQu2j7aa	it depends i have a 14yr old girl and i don't really want her to kiss yet but they are still babys they will know we did. i know that scarey i know im a single dad|`|22062b6f1df67b479dcd8d2bfc8b1b90aa	Depends on their maturity level.|`|lEm6Svecaa	well prolly 13 or 14  (7th or 8th grade)....i think twelve is a little early|`|t58tRjwbaa	she's at that age.|`|zKEVdGv2aa	I was 12, and I feel like it was a good age.|`|xy5LWTJ0aa	...i think 14 is a pretty good age for a first kiss...  that's when mine was and it was perfect...  on one episode of family feud there was a question that asked the average age of a first kiss and the number one answer was 14 haha  but i wouldn't worry about your daughter because when it happens for her it will happen and she would probably feel pretty awkward if she knew you were asking a question like this...my advice is to just let her be  hope this helped!|`|BeSteUwwaa	There isn't really set age on when its right for a person to experience their first kiss.  Its not like when you're 18; you're considered to be an adult...    First kisses should be based on the moment you have with the other person, that's what makes it special.    You just have to trust your daughter to make the right decision when the time comes or just talk to her about it and be open about it.|`|lhg9bqUTaa	im thirteen now and have had quite a few of them. i had minee in 6th grade i was 11. i think shes aht the right age.  [:
oZNgbIqYaa	DO NOT LIE!!  If you really like this guy, and start lying to him at this poing in your relationship....kiss it goodbye.    Just be honest..tell him why you have to cancel.  If he's really interested, he'll ask you out again, if he dosen't...he wasn't worth it.|`|LHsIyzOSaa	Well why do you have to cancel? Can't you just tell him that?|`|BLdla9dSaa	just say im sorry but i am busy can we do that another time?
FVDTXM68aa	YES!!! This can work!! Actually, studies have shown that by not spending each day together makes couples grow both as individuals, as well as a strong, happy couple! By spending time apart, this allows each person to still be an "individual"; then when they get together, they both can talk about what they have been up to! This also gives couples a chance to explore more about their partner! Keep in mind, you don't have to share every second of a day with your loved one. Keep some time to yourself; this also adds "mystery" to a relationship (in a good way!). So yeah, this can definitely work!! Have fun dating!!|`|DpCSx3Nlaa	wow...i had the same exact problem and its still in process. I went to a school and i used to hate this boy, then we found out that we had alot in common. we became friends and started to really like eachother. he likes me and i like him. then i moved and we kept in touch and started a try-out long distance relationship. its still going and we really cant take not seeing eachother...i cant see him again till april. But i think you can get closer cuz since your not seeing eachother everyday...u miss the person even more|`|Aj2iJZXJaa	Yes, people can always get closer as long as they both want to! ~I LOVE DEREK|`|W76VDFKCaa	Yes, it is possible.  I've became closer to a couple of guys just by talking on the phone with them and not seeing them too often.  Sometimes it is better to get to know someone on the phone/test/email because it is easier for them to talk about things that may otherwise be difficult to say face to face.  Good luck!|`|Uv7tkyBPaa	Ofcourse u guys can get closer if you really want to
t9rTToWYaa	Don't be friends with him.  Still be cordial and polite when he's around, but don't show any interest in him.  If it gets too serious, like if he starts flirting with you openly, etc, tell your friend.  She shouldn't waste time with someone that won't appreciate who she is.|`|85cf419cd1e3f93a6041239a56a0e3a5aa	bum him ! lol

3bu2QCfnaa	Guys get scared. When they run away from a relationship its because they afraid to give you thier all and be vulnerable. Im so sorry i know it hurts but you dont need to be with someone who is only going to give %50 when you deserve 100. Theres love waiting somewhere for you and you'll find it. Everybody is made for somebody and he'll come when you least expect it. Think of it as a growing period, your learning that getting hurt is okay and everybody has to go thru it and its just preparing you for the right guy. You'll be the strongest woman getting over heartbrakes because its unbelievable painful, i've been in your shoes. But a relationship requires two strong people. Try doing things you normally wouldnt do like take up a Yoga class, try kickboxing, do something to put your hurt into something productive, and its a great way to meet people. You never know who you'll meet...maybe Mr.Right?|`|KvgAwb8Vaa	Guys are mindless|`|HZuLVEEsaa	Im sorry this is gonna sound so harsh, but i hope itll make you move on.     He fancies her more.|`|DDduZ5q5aa	Well idk?? he just stupid|`|TasV2KaRaa	MAYBE B/C HE WASN'T SURE OF HIS FEELINGS...OR I'M SORRY TO SAY THIS BUT MAYBE HE DIDN'T LOVE YOU MORE THAN THAT OTHER GIRL.

TIME HEALS ALL WOUNDS!|`|BbziX8aZaa	He might be having a hard time trying to sort through his feelings for the both of you... he may love you more but in my personal opinion i think that when a guy like 2 girls at the same time they get just as confused as a girl does when she likes 2 guys so he may just be trying to get his feelings and thoughts straightened out but it depends on what kind of guy he is too...|`|FtMRxKf9aa	I'm truly sorry to hear that. Honestly, guys are really wired... wierder than girls. Maybe he saw something that he thinks you don't have or maybe he was never meant to be with you. I hope you feel better and whether or not you believe it, the pain will pass and soon you may be able to forgive him and maybe even be friends agin. If not, then PLEASE don't be this guy's puppy, always longing after him. Guys love that. Act as though you don't care, matbe he'll come back to you. GOOD LUCK!!!!!!!!!!!|`|sK73UzbUaa	there's no "more" or "less" in love... if he said he loves you "more" than her... it means he loves the girl... whether he loves you more... loving another one is more than enough to break up with the guy... move on girl...|`|LlhskRcSaa	He could have been lying....or he just wants to take some time to himself to think about if what he told you was realy how he feels.  Personaly if it where me and MY boyfriend told me straight up that he likes someone other than me i would be peeved! Seriously if you where a good girlfriend and you where REALY in love with him and him with you, then there shouldn't be any room for this other girl. I think the break up was enevatible, you would be causous arround him even if he didn't break up with you once you found out he liked someone else. That alown would be stressfull on you and annoying to him.|`|DAfCatspaa	Well did he actually say that he loves you more ?  Because if so, he's either just messing with your head, or just extremely confused on who to choose to go out with I guess.|`|ZCU7vIPfaa	because hes probably confused about what he wants and how he feels about both of you.|`|5DROluboaa	guys r jus lyk that they say they love u but st a certian point they jus get bored i guess im not a guy so i cant tell u for sure but lots of guys do that|`|Vy4rH01baa	I"m sorry, that really sucks.    Chin up, you can move on and you deserve better!  You will meet someone that is so into you they won't have anyone but you.  What is with this guy having "other girls"  aren't you better than that?  YES.  Do not settle for (or be) second best!|`|RpKnuAZFaa	No offense but how do you know he loves you more than the other girl he likes? If he left you for some other girl there must have had enough problems in the relationship to push him away, or he didnt love you anymore. Im not saying it was your fault but if its over and he is with someone else, let him go even though its painful. He will respect you more for it.     Good luck and I hope your heart heals quickly|`|hz8qm7XJaa	Aweh, I'm so sorry to hear about your situation.  But maybe he thought that you guys would be better off as friends, maybe he liked that relationship more.     Answer mine, please?  http://ca.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...|`|aZXnW6AUaa	rejoin|`|sCr2iTczaa	Honey guys are jerks, well not all of them, but most of them. Don't worry about him you have the rest of your life ahead of you and i'm sure you sill find a boy who will be with you because he likes you. I think even though you don't want to be his friend anymore you need to let him know how you feel and how he hurt you so bad when he did that. You can't just keep it bottled up inside. I am so sorry this happened to you, but you deserve better anyways. I hope everything works out for the best    peace and love|`|WPbwiGafaa	because it was probabley something you did|`|bNx1q5oWaa	i think he just wanted to use you for something,some guys are like that just talk to him and if he doesnt respond then forget about him|`|RncUc0traa	mayb he dont want to cheat on u wid d other girl and he ain wan say goodbye to her as yet..
205ce36b2214521105667ecdc666b6c5aa	she  should give an apology and she shouldn't have REALLY done it. you're in the right but as well as her saying sorry you should too for giving the impression that you were uncomfortable and appeared to be a little untrusting|`|cYRZpGkqaa	pretty touchy situation. she didn't necessarily do anything wrong, but it was pretty disrespectful of her to do that to you. and she should've apologized.|`|alaUYtRcaa	well i think what she did was wrong.. even if they were just talking there is no reason why they couldnt talk on the phone..|`|acdf2a2c14fccbe7a3badc5fa8d3abe1aa	If she didn't do any type of cheating then I don't see it as doing anything wrong.  Maybe they just wanted to leave you guys to whatever you guys were doing and just wanted to chat a bit without you guys interrupting.  You could have just told her that you felt a bit uncomfortable and next time you would prefer that the door stays open if she is ok with that, but if not then you understand because you trust her 100%.|`|uUMDZdOIaa	if she wasnt cheating on you, was she doing drugs and tryin to hide it?  i dont blame ya for being upset with it.  If i brought a male friend home, and went into the bedroom with the door closed, my fiance would prob get pissed too.  Theres no reason for her to be in her bedroom with another man, (cheating or not) if you are not there too.  I bet she wouldnt like it if you took another chick in the bedroom and closed the door!|`|gNBr1jAZaa	i think that you deserve an apology.  thats just not right what she did even if nothing happened.  good luck
dGyX3E8Faa	Stick with your girlfriend. Like you said, it's out of her control. And if you break up with her, her wacked up family will probably give her hell about it and put the wrong ideas in her head. No, it would not be a good idea to end the relationship unless your feelings for specifically her have diminished.     I think that you need to show her that she can be appreciated. You seem like the only stable one in her world right now, and being with you will hopefully help her turn her life in the right direction and gain some self esteem. It does not sound like she is too pleased with her family. A lot of people hate their in laws, but it's not like you will have to see them all the time or live right next door. Maybe if you want to stay in the same region you could just move an hour or two away. Close enough for contact but far enough from comfort.    You come off as a smart guy, and I think you will make a good decision.|`|0qLJXy3Zaa	deal! talk to her about it, but there's really nothing you cann do. try to see them not too much, but when you do be polite and put on a happy face.|`|CyHJlCZXaa	In every relationship there are going to be faults and you just have to learn to accept them. Just count yourself lucky it's not a problem with her!|`|wTqEOvqSaa	if you dnt like the family, then in the future you wont either. and it is rele hard to look past that. you may love her, but eventually her family will jus make you more aggravated and you will not want to deal with it ne longer.   good luck and hope all works out for you
ZSznCJhSaa	I recently broke up with my boyfriend and it was for specific reasons that are not important to explain... but overall he was a really really wonderful, great, loving guy. We just needed to work on some things on our own.   Anyways, because he was so great I really wanted to stay friends with him, we talked and such, but I realized that there was no way, absolutely no way, to really get over him unless I cut off all contact.    I have faith that if we want to be friends in the future we can, but right now if you just broke up with him it is NOT a good idea to talk to him. Give it a couple months time for you to really move on from your feelings, then maybe you guys can be great friends.    (ps. He is just trying to assert some kind of control in the situation again by sending you flirty messages and making you wait. This also just isn't a sign off a good thing to be involved with)|`|cYRZpGkqaa	tell him you just want to be friends now, and if he can't handle that boundary you're better off without him. i am now married and i'm on a friendly basis with four of my exes. my husband is fine with that. as long as there's honesty. that's what counts.|`|LNsVIV1naa	my ex is a really awesome guy and i stayed friends with him  tell him u want to be friends with him and thats it|`|xDlBM6N6aa	I am, but yet we've been friends off and on again...it's messed up.  Do it if you want to put up with a bunch of crap, or dont because you just want to move on.  Make your choice.|`|l1BG0Y9Daa	I absolutely forget about them. It's not fun seeing them with other girls.|`|467145608db35ec4ccc89f1b16418af6aa	i'm friends with most of my ex's, it also allows a closer friendship..  at least i think.    there are some that i'm not friends with, but that's only if they did something... unforgiveable.|`|BuxNfchCaa	Im friends with all my ex's. But some took more time than others. I didnt tallk to my highschool bf of 4 yrs till 12 years later. Now we are great friends.     Sometimes you have to give it  a little time.
aL0uWmSLaa	u sound like a nice girl and i don't get what's the deal with your boyfriend's parents    so i think u should set up a meeting with your boyfriend's parents and tell them how much u care about their son and if you've caused any downfalls to their son (which i doubt u have) tell them that u will do everything in your power to help him out through whatever he's going through    after that they should have no choice but to respect and admire u if they don't then i guess they really are "assholeish" huh    Hope i could help :)|`|wJ1v0cX0aa	i think that, if you want everybody to be happy, you can do so by encouraging your boyfriend to get good grades. They probably worry that he will end without a diploma because of you and it's going to cost them money to restart another year of school. So, encourage him to get good grades and they won't have any reason to blame you. By doing this, it will prove them that they were wrong.
BwNiS2Hmaa	Sounds like she fancies you...  Try striking up a conversation next time you walk by/see her. She seems interested.     Good luck! :)|`|l1zvTRVAaa	She was probably thinking the same thing you were. she was probably just being friendly|`|wscyjkPAaa	Maybe she's being polite or she finds you attractive.  Next time you see her, say "Hey, I remember you, I think I've seen you here before".  Then ask for her name and talk to her.|`|H0vicK8Kaa	When nice people make contact they smile.. doesn't mean anything just being friendly..Your staring right at her it would have been RUDE not to at least acknowledge you..     useless you say HI next time ans strick a convo YOU"LL Never know if she was really 'flirting' LIke i'm sure you would like to think... she prob thinks you were flirting     :)|`|uVH046Fjaa	She was checking out the hotter guy standing behind you.
tVluPTPraa	he thinks you are cute but not in bed...|`|dGyX3E8Faa	Haha he's just kinda flirting with you in a childish way because you were acting childish too.|`|OepO491daa	thats a little weird. maybe he thinks of you as a little sister?|`|KmNAewUQaa	go out with him! don't waste your time playing games, you both obviously like each other!!|`|0qLJXy3Zaa	it's sound like he's into you. just be careful, they tell you anything you wanna hear. and i don't know him so i can't be the judge but everyone thinks that their situation is different. in the end though, it's really not. lol i've learned from experience.|`|GUFWthimaa	wait till he asks u out ;)if hes really into u he will  for him to do that u need to say hes adorable too nxt time he says it to u.. but i wouldn't trust a guy who uses the word "adorable" to a girl... i met this guy and i didn't mind foolin around with (but didn't wanna sleep with) and i ended up going to his place for fun and he called me that.. which was a turn off... he basically just wanna f*ck me so (which i didn't ;)... yea like the other girl said, be careful...get to know him before anything...unless u just wanna fool around lol|`|dx2esPe1aa	When i say absolutley adorable to a girl... its a GOOD thing. really good. In my eye's, there are stages of attractiveness... Being HOTT is ok. Not great. Means you look good, but its all fake. Slutty kind of. CUTE and ADORABLE is where its at. A cute or adorable girl are the ones you want to marry. Sounds like this guy likes you too! Guys like girls to go after them... go get em!
WgqJaOxQaa	Usually if they're always staring at you, paying attention to you, blushing or sweating when they're around you. Some guys act differently around one girl they like than they do with other girls.    If they're your friend, then that might be a little harder to tell. If they're always nice to you, always trying to talk to you, trying to get your attention, and hanging around you.|`|WPbwiGafaa	what i do when i like a girl is i try to ask them if they would like togo out sometime|`|Gl3zQNGWaa	When a guy likes you, he'll either show it by being stupid around you (fooling around and have one of those insecure laughs they have) or some guys strangely appear meaner when they like a girl...  Usually they try to hide it but we always can feel when something's there... usually we feel it when there's been a change in their usual attitude around you  good luck -x|`|9b6e3856ff9fd505bdf5544026fe01dfaa	ask them how should i know
8P6MmLv0aa	well that all depends on whats going on at the time, Say there was a girl that I really liked and we went out say to bolling one night after flirting and having fun we would leave i would take her to a quiet place and kiss her passionately on the lips then when finished you don't have to say anything just hold her hand and walk.|`|IN1wPKwoaa	just smile  |---  |-----------2 Points--------|||"|""\__  |__________________|||_|___|)  !(@)'(@)""""**!(@)(@)****!(@)|`|l3eT6IZzaa	if you kiss a guy that kiss and tell you're in trouble cuz he will exagerate and say's thing that you've never done... but if you kiss a decent human being, then it's usually left at that...|`|eWTjH5U9aa	Stand there in shock!|`|KITQu2j7aa	thats a good ?? .....it depends on what kind of kiss it was.was it a o.k. kiss or a curle your toe oh my kiss?|`|s7UZZbVhaa	starts with:  saying something sweet  looking deeply in the eyes  holding/hugging    during:  eyes closed (important)    ends with:  i love you|`|sCbNP39daa	http://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-K...    go to that site it will b a big help|`|NXJDsVfNaa	It depends....  I mean it might build up to a kiss with dancing, hugging, talking, laughing, etc.  And after wards, it could end in just looking at each other (either "lovingly" or awkwardly) or you could just hold hands....    It all depends on the situation.|`|d49ZA5xYaa	Well before you say this. word for word. or else....  I want to kiss you    and then you kiss|`|3YpVVRWpaa	lets do that agin or kiss me again
xccRugjHaa	Just a day or two.  That should be fine.
Y8nTKWWpaa	Give him a text soonish. By that I mean don't keep it waiting or you will become more of a stranger to him by the day. It's always worth it to make a friend, just throw him a text asking him what he's up to. I wouldn't worry so much about what he might think of you. Eg. When should I text?  Being a boy, I guarantee we do not pay attention to smaller details such as this and we wont judge you upon them. Good luck!  Finze1
8xPWd35maa	Howie Mandel looks much better without hair.|`|8j7FCEOraa	They didnt even look like the same guy!

I've nver seen him with hair! HAHAH he looks weird.  I originally was not a fan of the bald, shiny head but now that i see him with the mini-fro i think he looks much better without.  oooh howie, gotta love it.|`|sZhTwzh4aa	i'm serious. neither.|`|uXeGsxSVaa	No hair. he actually kinda hot with no hair|`|wWzO9xARaa	He looks better without hair, but if you want my honest opinion hes ugly no matter what.|`|VYJp1Tifaa	YES he looks very sheek with out hair but i have to admit he is ugly anyway|`|mtV7dWJHaa	Definitely - without!|`|l2EFsjycaa	Without most definitely! :)|`|hR7fJ9y4aa	Without|`|5NLvFueBaa	he looks better bald|`|9cd8dcdb0f1ce93601311dd08f7c10f8aa	My response when I clicked on the hair picture was- "Oh mercy!"    So I would believe that he looks much, much better without any hair.
Vf5OnZ4Caa	dont automatically try to when him/her back..wjhen you see them at school let them know you want to be friends with them, because you miss their FRIENDSHIP. hopefully, he will like the sound of that and you guys can be friends. if your still interested by then, start to flirt etc..

Good luck though,|`|CUc2gqzjaa	he doesnt like you|`|Gza8jaboaa	he dont like u wow...  get a brain|`|DAfCatspaa	It doesn't seem like he's interested...  sorry.|`|eRGWEJOyaa	He either doesn't like you, or he wants you to say it to him.|`|ZCU7vIPfaa	YOUR A DUMBASS!

alaUYtRcaa	You should say.. hey whats up
AA11909552	That's not right. Something else is happening on his end. I would re-evaluate the whole thing. That's not right! If he is like this *now*, then what's to say he won't be even weirder down the road?  These particular "mixed signals" are not healthy and I recommend moving on.
p3nREIklaa	Ask her if you can kiss her lips, then work your way up to her belly button....    Or ask  her if you can touch her belly button.... From the inside...
u2rDNTPEaa	Honestly, you're not crazy. I'm 22 and when I was around your age, I was exactly the same way. But I dont think it's love you dont want, i think it's the act of being IN love. I always felt it's just way too much pressure. But love? well, i'm sure you enjoy being loved by your friends and family.  But I get what you're saying completely. Just enjoy being you. When and if you ever feel like you're willing and ready to be in a relationship or develop those kinds of feelings for someone, go for it. If being in love ends up never appealing to you, screw it. You have to just do, or dont do, what makes you happy. live for yourself.|`|MQ2GL5jhaa	so you wanna grow old alone headin out to go play bingo everynite only to meet up with fellow old  ppl that chances r wont remember your name the nxt day of play?  Sure u have friends now but when older and they r married and with kids, you will c that they will grow distant from you cuz they will have even more responsabilities and less time for "fun"  It will sadden you that you wont have anyone to really do anything.  It takes 2 to tango.  Your mind is in the right place...at the moment.  u dont need love right now cuz education comes first, but in time u will realize your gonna want it.  My sister was the same way around your age.  She is now 29 and has 3 kids and a husband.  No one expected that especially her but it happened.  The best things in life take time so your life has just begun so u have plenty of time to find your knight and shinnin armour or better yet he may find you ;) Just learn to love yourself for who u r rather than hatin for who ur not.  If you love yourself for not wantin love, well then thats who you are.    oh and i dont think your crazy cuz like i said about my sister, heck thats a way lots of ppl feel about life.  So your not crazy :) just a tad confused imo :D    Enjoy the rest of your day:)|`|GLBWe3A9aa	Of course your not crazy. Some people just don't like company like that.

Ask yourself - why do I want to have a boyfriend?    Write a list of the reasons and then ask yourself, is it really that important after all?    Most of the time the only reason someone at high school wants a boyfriend is because many other girls have one. Deny it all you like but at high school, this is just another way to fit in whether or not you know it consciously.|`|0108814c0be993aa40a2e5f0e69ae0f9aa	If you are 12 maybe it is better to hang as a group instead of boyfriend/girlfriend.|`|lZ7zfzLRaa	so find a boy you like and get on it.|`|7Mzopie7aa	self confidence and try not to be so conceded.|`|m8A8rj2Qaa	oh wow. your really young. too young to have a bf. boys your age have the mentality of a 7 year old. just wait until the boys mature and your beauty matures and they'll be all over you! you'll have a choice instead of setting with some sticky immature child.|`|CJWC4znPaa	ooh well liike yew may bee pwetty and all butt your personaliity matters alot iif yew have a good one well jus fliirt wiit a couple of guys and if you got a bad 1 then jus change    if anything just tell your friends to introduce you to some friends|`|wj1OLn1paa	Ask a guy you like out.|`|3r7aBIXeaa	Well, you might be considered to young to date, but I know how you feel.  If you really like a specific guy then try to get his attention, but don't do anything snarky and don't over do it, or he might think your full of yourself. Just be yourself because if someone doesn't like you for who you are then hes a total A$$Hole and hes not worth it.   If some guys don't seem  to notice your superior awesomeness then there the stupidest guys in your school.  Don't let it get you down. I didn't have my first date till' I was fourteen and I've been with this guy for three years. So sometimes waiting to date can be a good thing. :)  Best wishes!  With love,   Brie

You don't need a boyfriend. No one needs a boyfriend? And you are "really pretty" (you spelt pretty wrong) well that just makes you sound super cocky so no wonder you don't have a boyfriend. Oh and you shouldn't ask a guy out they should ask you if you are so "pretty"|`|ZvA10P1Haa	Okay. When i was 12, (Im 15 now, so trust me on this.) I wanted a boyfriend more then you could know! But now, looking back, dateing was a joke in the 7th grade. Trust me, wait a year or two! :-)|`|Zi1O7MpEaa	Im pretty sure if u were really "pritty" a guy would've asked u put already|`|0LogG37Aaa	First of all, no one "needs" a boyfriend. You shouldn't want a boyfriend just so you can tell everyone, "Hey look at me, I have a boyfriend!" or just to feel better about yourself. When the time is right, and you meet someone special because you like him and he likes you for who you are, then it's time to start a relationship. Besides, you're 12...nothing happens when you're 12 years old...and trust me, having a boyfriend complicates everything. Be an indepedent person and don't rely on superficial things to make you feel "happy." If you really, really want a boyfrined,don't go around saying that you're really pretty because that's vain and haughty, and boys don't like that (and girls will hate you).|`|5WjdFqMXaa	U don't need a boyfriend when ur 12. The only goin out ur gunna be doin is goin out the door together|`|S6WOighOaa	hey chica!  you do not need a boyfriend at the age of 12!  at the age of 12 you should be living up you fun years where you dont have to worry about anything!  having a boyfriend is just going to bring out worries, drama, and pressure in you life. Trust me i was there.. i thought i needed a boyfriend at that age just because everyone else had one and i thought it would make me feel prettier and be more "popular", but that's so not that case. i don't know you, but don't depend on a guy to have fun, feel loved, feel pretty, to look popular, or whatever else you think.   take my advice and live you life, high school isn't that far for you. there will be so many guys there and if you really think about it if you were dating someone right now how would they drive you around? because im pretty sure no 12 or 13 year old have their licenses yet. how would they pay for your dinner or movie ticket? most 12 or 13 year olds don't have a job and how to treat a girl or woman correctly.. they're still maturing and even if you don't think so you are to.    so have fun and live your life!  God bless  (:|`|rFJY5mfPaa	uummm yea...u def. do not need a boyfriend at 12.....    thats retarted....no offense|`|MzzEQd1Faa	You don't need a boy friend at 12 :P|`|IoT9ZO7Haa	u dont NEED somee1 but just confront them|`|WgoJoaqGaa	shuttup your 12... keep your legs closed ahahaha  lmao|`|22062b6f1df67b479dcd8d2bfc8b1b90aa	Hey kid, what's the rush?    I'm 15 and I've never even had a boyfriend.|`|L7pavNcaaa	try not being conceded and maybe learning to spell pretty.  uhm otherwise your twelve. you don't need one|`|8HOygNkGaa	flirt with some boys...  wait for them to ask you...  or send them a valentine...  they'll find out who sent it with out you telling them...|`|TZmzjFGzaa	No, no you don't.|`|4oVNfPnTaa	Get one of those webkinz things...you can interact with them online. ...which is all you should do with a "boyfriend" at that age.|`|1HPnlqTXaa	In humans, defecation may occur (depending on the individual and the circumstances) from once every two or three days to several times a day. Hardening of the feces may cause prolonged interruption in the routine and is called constipation.    Human fecal matter varies significantly in appearance, depending on diet and health. Normally it is semisolid, with a mucus coating. Its brown coloration comes from a combination of bile and bilirubin, which comes from dead red blood cells.    In newborn babies, fecal matter is initially yellow/green after the meconium. This coloration comes from the presence of bile alone. In time, as the body starts expelling bilirubin from dead red blood cells, it acquires its familiar brown appearance, unless the baby is breast feeding, in which case it remains soft, pale yellowish, and not-unpleasantly scented until the baby begins to eat significant amounts of other food.    Throughout the life of an ordinary human, one may experience many types of feces. A "green" stool is from rapid transit of feces through the intestines (or the consumption of certain blue or green food dyes in quantity), and "clay-like" appearance to the feces is the result of a lack of bilirubin.    Bile overload is very rare, and not a health threat. Problems as simple as serious diarrhea can cause blood in one's stool. Black stools caused by blood usually indicate a problem in the intestines (the black is digested blood), whereas red streaks of blood in stool are usually caused by bleeding in the rectum or anus.    Food may sometimes make an appearance in the feces. Common undigested foods found in human feces are seeds, nuts, corn and beans, mainly because of their high dietary fiber content. Beets may turn feces different hues of red. Artificial food coloring in some processed foods such as highly colorful packaged breakfast cereals can also cause unusual feces coloring if eaten in sufficient quantities.    Laboratory examination of feces, usually termed as stool examination, is done for the sake of diagnosis, for example, to detect presence of parasites and/or their eggs (ova) or to detect disease spreading bacteria.
OyjkRSh5aa	If it was me, and if I loved my girlfriend or liked her a lot, I would feel so great to call her, just because I'm allowed to call her and because she's my girlfriend. This guy isn't calling you! He doesn't text, doesn't do anything unless you do it first. Either he doesn't like you as much as you like him, or he thinks he's in a waay higher league (because of ego) than you, and if it's the latter case, then maybe he is just dating you to show that he has a girlfriend, or just so he can flock to you when he's super bored and has nothing else to do. It could also be that he's busy in school, but you told me he has plenty of time for his friends, so he is NOT busy. And how come he doesn't invite you to come with his friends? Do his friends bring their girlfriends? If they do, then dump him, and if they don't bring girlfriends (or they dont' have any), then maybe try to make him more interested in you by doing something interesting (non-sexual), like inviting him to a cool activity with just the both of you.     Seriously I would call my girlfriend if I liked her. Like pretend you're single and you don't have a bf, but there's this guy you have a huge crush on. You "feel" and "want" to talk to this stranger, but it would be ackward, so you don't call. But if you had an excuse to call the person you "like", you'd call him over and over and over, well, you know twice a week or at least once a week if the person is busy.      "he always tells u hes gonna come see you but then he never shows up and he never gives an excuse except for this one time "  okay that just killed it. NO PERSON IN THE WORLD does this unless they don't care about you.     A relationship should be two way, not one way. Don't like him and not expect anything back, cus then the relationship is all in your mind. If that's the case, leave him, fight the feelings of wanting to get back together (he might initiate it because he'd look bad if the girl broke up with him and not the other way around). Find someone else and allow yourself to start to get feelings for them, not just someone popular, but someone down to earth and not shallow like your current bf SEEMS to be.     Hope that helped!     Gamilstob|`|wzXJOSIeaa	It sounds like he wants a one way relationship! YOU GOING HIS WAY ONLY! That's stupid you need to move on. You seem like a nice girl and you can do so much better than that. Please do move on!|`|834IgNzRaa	I dnt care..............lol...............No but seriously I know how yu feel, I think yu should do wat yu feel iz right. I know yur lost cuz yu asked this question but inside yu know wat yu need to do. Either way im here for yu dude! Follow yur heart. YU know wat needs to happen no one can tel yu wat yu should do............. Good Luck!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ;) ;) ;)|`|9b6e3856ff9fd505bdf5544026fe01dfaa	i dont care|`|b2588303cd0bf17f0993891608852540aa	Break up with him and move on with your life.  He doesn't sound very interested in this relationship.
Geqb39wxaa	Sometimes 2 people need to fall apart before they relize how much they need to fall back together|`|ibRjKfvBaa	you have to figure out whether they are really just silly things or silly things covering up a bigger problem. If you mark them off as silly things of course you will end up getting back together. There may bigger problems you are ignoring so you can get back together.|`|UgcPxd4maa	yeah|`|6Y9zWhvHaa	it time to move on. i would call it a day.|`|9b6e3856ff9fd505bdf5544026fe01dfaa	are you playing a game people dont break up that much|`|xRkXbmI4aa	if he keeps dumping you the n wanting to get bak together, u dump him to show him what hes doing, then hell like you more        just some advice dont have to do it i dont know if itll work...
rmC59Zv9aa	im 18, I'm definatly not a nerd, my first gf was in 11th grade.. cuz i wanted to wait till im older so i could drive her places and stuff like that... its not a big deal if you dont have a bf.. but if you want to date him id say just try talking to him a lot, oh and 7th grade boys are dumb i would know, so when you start talking to him a lot through in a little thing like your just cute.. he will then get the idea...|`|r7gxrbqGaa	hmm... why do you really want a boyfriend lol.  anyways, just like flirt with him or whatever. he will get it, and if he's interested he might ask you out. or he may be like me and not bother asking girls out for uhm... various reasons. but if he starts like looking at you back and whatever then you should ask him out. personally i think its really cool when a girl asks me out. and the kissing and stuff, its not really important, and i don't suggest rushing it either, i didn't make out with any girl until this year in tenth grade.
2qmKDhmzaa	tall guys are better because then girls can wear heels without feeling like a giant|`|uff3kOoFaa	im sorry. sometimes we girls want someone to hold her, someone to watch over her, be her protector. thats an impression that generally tall guys make. there are probably other reasons. i am in love with a tall guy, sometimes it just happens. i have had crushes on short guys. dont worry. you'll find your girl. i promise. :)|`|3lVuNfLMaa	not necessarily, a lot of girls prefer their guy to be taller than them but not all, plus if the guy is 5 4 he can find a lot of girls who are shorter than him, unless he is majorly small he will find a girl who is smaller than him    Theres an old line however that a girl should be able to wear heals and not be taller than her man!|`|WfFmxZ7faa	Mmm kinda in a way i guess. Like i prefer a guy taller than me. He doesnt have to be real tall just taller than me. But thats not to hard to find seeing that im only 5'foot and im threw growing lol and its just because its nice to have the guy taller cuz you feel almost like this protective feeling ya kno?
uuMCGT9taa	dont get in the mix|`|4XlWLeSsaa	water canon to the crotch   get film..P.H
wzXJOSIeaa	Yes it is! And why wasn't your girlfriend with you?|`|4293T0LNaa	yes that is cheating. wtf kinda question is that, u got no common sense or what?? have u told ur gf about it?|`|GBr9YngTaa	Yes it still is cheating. You should have opt out of the game. Perhaps your girlfriend might've understood for playing spin the bottle, a small peck on the lips or cheek (That would depend on her, it is different for every girl if they care or not) But making out for five minutes? Sorry that it is cheating and unreasonable.|`|mdtkor2Paa	cool
6Mm3KV6iaa	Tell you mom that you have thought about it  and you don't feel that you like scouts any more   reasons not to go  1.i am to old  2.it is not fun  3.not entertaining me  4.non of my friends are in it so why should i  5.i know is is not what a kid like me should say but it is not eductaed enough  6.i dont learn any thing let me tell ya|`|DcVoq5Tuaa	tell her, she should be able to get her deposit back. I can't see making you stay in something that you are not enjoying.|`|tZ4Kyc0Waa	You might need to go to the camp depending on how much it costs. If its fairly cheap have a heart to heart with her about why you feel this way.|`|TBZ0ScFfaa	tell her the truth  she should not get dissapointed at something you dont like|`|hFNpkFyUaa	The honest way is to just tell her what you just said and mention that i don't want to hurt you but that's how i feel. The Sneaky way is to "Get" sick all of a sudden so you don't have to go and mention then that if scouts is going to make me feel this way i want to quit.|`|QUJIwRUcaa	Explain the situation. If she understands you in a way a mother SHOULD, she'll understand.|`|kdSuwt8paa	I don't think you can.   You can start preparing her for you leaving at the end of the year but you can't expect her to pay for another club and a dfferent camp.   She probably works hard for her money.   On the positive side you and your friend are not the only people at camp so you won't be stuck with her all the time.  The activities are group activities so you won't be lonely even if you don't have a best friend.  Just make the best of it this time, and then leave at the end of the year.|`|CwFVgcGbaa	just be honest with her,  If she loves you, she will understand.|`|71DWu22kaa	Just tell her that you aren't interested in it anymore.    Also, when I wanted to quit I would always keep my mom busy until the exact moment I was supposed to be at a Scout Meeting.  That way you have to rush to get there and after a while it becomes a hassle.  She won't mind that you want to quit if it means no more hassle.  :D
domEftoIaa	she is hurting you right?   im not saying that you need to hurt her or anything but apparently she don't care about you anymore. and if i was you i would just come out and tell her what she is doing to you and ask her if she is replacing you. trust me there are plenty of people in this world for you to find another friend. one that won't do this to you.  just talk to her, don't worry everything will be alright.   good luck!!!
z4c7zGKmaa	I would go with white flowers for the bridesmaids' bouquets, maybe with a few red flowers thrown in.  In contrast, I would do your bouquet with mostly red flowers, with a few white ones thrown in.|`|0jUGSaZPaa	I would say yellow...  http://www.flowersforrent.com/store/imag...    http://images.search.yahoo.com/images/vi...|`|3SSVBJAqaa	Blue Hydrangeas!!!!!!!|`|gRZT4pnUaa	white with pink or red flowers mixed in would be pretty.|`|a3422bad6666b60894e80bace0f14387aa	Pink, white, orange, yellow, off white, purple - any really!|`|3WQOa4sraa	I think keep a lot of red and pink tones in the bouquets;   :)      http://media.theknot.com/ImageStage/Obje...    http://images.theknot.com/ImageStage/Obj...    http://i17.photobucket.com/albums/b77/la...    http://www.truebride.com.au/images/bride...    http://www.silverlily.co.uk/Gallery/Wedd...    http://www.blumen.com/images/red%20rose%...|`|mxDoggk0aa	A cream color  would be good.|`|FzUoB9qkaa	I think that cream and red red flowers would be beautiful together for the bouquets.  Depending on the time of year you should be able to find a variety of flowers in these colors that won't break you budget.|`|50ab85f362cbbddab47844295a4bba7caa	You really could do just about anything. It may depend on what month your wedding is.    Cream colored  White - plain or red tipped  Soft pink  Purple shades  Pale yellow|`|gpL7W3jAaa	Anything but yellow.    Yellow and red reminds me of McDonalds lol|`|5zOm9crmaa	I would use a mixture of apple green & white or yellow & white.|`|NB5L3rpQaa	red, cream, pink and white, any or all of these should go well.
YqoxcTN9aa	dont give up if you really like him, there is a lways a chance something may transpire|`|jChbnuafaa	all fair in love and war     flirt with him   hell catch on that you like him  hes not going to dump his girl if he doesnt no you like him    good luck  -salsa|`|cDQLUjq1aa	I think you should maybe talk to him about it and see if the rumours are true, it'll make it less awkward for you that way, if you like him you shouldn't tell him though it'll make matters worse, especially seeing he has a gf...|`|KsoFu4Ieaa	just get friendly with him, but not anything that would threaten his relationship with his bird    good luck hen|`|GLBWe3A9aa	If he has a girlfriend then i suggest you find a boyfriend. Just a temporary one and if he likes you he will become jealous. then after a while finish the boy and see what happens.  Or you can just wait but theres no fun in that.|`|GwA7m9Fdaa	1 Thing NOT to do...Is ask him if he likes you  Just start talking to him and you become great friends.Friends talk about everything together and one day he might tell you and..  HAPPILY EVER AFTER FOR YOU!!|`|PAWuguZMaa	you know he has a girlfriend,u know you should give up then still why are you thinking a lot about it?be in reality............my advice is just to stop thinking of him........
x0Z19HJGaa	First of all your parents are WRONG!!! Color does not matter!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! That's racist and just plain ignorant! If you like him and you want to be with him then tell your parents to realize what color president we have and to shove it! My parents told me the same thing and I refuse to believe that! I know that color does not matter and that's horrible for them to say that about a teenager. Good Luck! Stand up for what you believe in if you know it's wrong!|`|wTqEOvqSaa	ive been exactly in ur shoes at around that age,  i was dating a guy that was a diff. race then i was, and my dad hated that. he tried everything to get me to stop seeing him. but becuz we rele liked eachother, we stuck it out.   you cant worry about wat ur parents think, or ne one else for that matter. wen ur in a relationship it is jus u and that other person. so stop worrying about wat ur parents think. as long as ur happy then go for it. Good Luck|`|eRGWEJOyaa	I had the same problem, except I'm older, so we were more serious.  I was the dumpee, it was mutual because she was a family oriented girl, and her parents didn't like me.  We knew it wouldn't work.  You're parents are racists, and I hate racism, with a passion.  Not the people, just the idea, but in your case, because you're only 13, I would let it slide.  He's not going to be the only sweet guy you meet.  If you really REALLY like him though, talk to your parents about their problem.    Good luck. : )|`|66423c4d314ba3c4d9ba9e3ff7a0a7cbaa	I know how u feel....but you should not let what your parents think get to you. Because think about it this way...YOU didnt do anything wrong so why must you let go of something you like..if you still like him. Just have a heart to heart with ur parents...tell them how u feel about him..and that its unfair to judge him on his race because thats not fair at all. And like...how would they feel if they were judged like that|`|pESS5I6Daa	Don't let race stop you from loving someone. Believe your own heart and don't take your parent's opinion serious. Also, you are only 13, so things will definately change as you grow.|`|mTUQSlcpaa	Your parents like him enough to allow him to come visit you and your brother  at your house so what is the problem??? Go for it!!! In time they'll come around on the interracial dating. It more acceptable today than in their day. Besides your just dating, hanging out and being friendly. Not getting married! Not yet anyway maybe 6 or 7 years from now( smile hahaha...) And if you were getting married soooooo what! HAVE FUN -GO GET YOUR GUY.|`|CwEWcIWuaa	It depends how long you have broken up. if it hasn't been long, you might want to wait a little while but if it was a few weeks ago then I think you should text him and ask if you can meet up and talk.Don't say it when he is with your brother because he has come to spend time with him and you might not get any privacy and your brother may want to know what is going on.   Go to a cafe or somewhere and tell him how you feel, say that your parents are just being protective because they care about you but you still like him and you are sorry. then see what he says, if it's not meant to be then he will say no but at least you will have given it a shot.    GOOD LUCK|`|zxQT3Uo5aa	You followed your parents advice.  You did him a favor.  He does not need/want a GF conflicted by her parents interest.    Delay the Bf/GF thing until you can make choice for yourself.|`|V7Y9ldTUaa	you are to young to be worrying about it.  but i would say hang out with him and if he'll take you back,date him anyway and screw what your parents say.  but again 13 is still really young to be telling your parents to f off.|`|PmVeQUdMaa	If your familys racist and you know it clap your hands.|`|4cc625c81315e3cc57858f7de7250b2aaa	Be friends while you grow up a few more years.  I never let my kids date or have boyfriends / girlfriends at 13, regardless of their color.  Why do you need advice ASAP?|`|ESsQeH8Aaa	Sadly, you have 2 things working against you here.      1) you under the age of consent and therefor your parents' assessment of who you hang around is pretty much legally binding.    2) your parents' are prejudiced against skin color....if THAT really is the reason they don't want this guy around.  Might be another reason you don't see, but I will never know for sure.   Either way, you might be dating this guy after you turn 18, when your parents don't have a say any longer who you spend your time around.|`|W618lfZ6aa	Yeah your parents are racist, but you are stuck with them for at least 5 more years.   Best thing to do in this case is suck it up and do as they wish, but don't become them.    You are very young, enjoy being a kid while you can, you shouldn't have to deal with this kind of stuff.|`|3se8BaJLaa	your parents are racist|`|hyY5t2JKaa	why arent u in school???? thats what im wondering...|`|HhsjeOoHaa	I think you should leave him alone. If you two do date and break up, then you'll still be stuck seeing him since he's your brothers friend. I think that would be even more awkward.|`|QgKAL3sEaa	It's up to you who you date not your parents, respect their opinions but they should also respect yours and your judgement. Whether or not you should be allowed to date someone shouldn't be based on their skin colour that's sick and racist!|`|o5ANsyK6aa	hit it, quit it , say you never did it|`|5Y9Ekm0naa	First of all... you're only 13, so you shouldn't be so worried about a relationship with anyone. I mean seriously, you are not gonna end up marrying a guy you're with when you're 13.     But besides that... This is 2009, not the 60's. You know race has nothing to do with him as a person. On almost all issues, it is usually good to listen to your parents. But this is one issue that shouldn't. I know you love your parents... but they are idiots!|`|0qLJXy3Zaa	there's a big maturity difference between 13 year old girls and 15 1/2 year old guys...sorry.|`|W60e5AA5aa	I have been in this exact same situation...  The best thing to do is to sit down and talk to your parents, explain to them.  You could also try to get them to see that it would be better for everyone if they give their consent, so you to could be together.   I am sure they would rather you dated him honestly than in secret.  If this doesn't work then I suggest you explain things to the boy involved...  The likely-hood of you two being together forever, getting married and having children is slim. (I know I don't know either of your or what you are like together-just on statistics.) You would be better off waiting for someone your parents approvee of.  But I  still think you should sit down with your parents, people are more likely to do something wrong/not meant to when they are told not to...    Good luck    XxX|`|Gp4AP971aa	:S  if u like him and he likes u..date him  well, if he asks u out anyway|`|79ZdM70Taa	You need a MAN, baby.  But not until your at least 21.|`|a8Qiv5r5aa	well there isn't much you can do since you're only 13.  So either wait till you get older, or move onto another guy.|`|sUJJYlk1aa	ur parents are racist:(|`|zzfbE70Qaa	wowow ur parents are wrong!  tell them that ur surprised that they react to someone that way  and its not up to them who u like and who u wanna go out with|`|PGHuUaGMaa	I say bone him and get it over with problem solved|`|WRRRChiaaa	your parents are flat out - racist.|`|qG752H8Qaa	ask him to go out with you again, tell your parents it shouldn't matter what color his skin is it should matter whats in the heart.|`|bl7ZzF9saa	first off, your parents sound racist. secondly, they should not be dictating who you want to date. It's your life.|`|48HZRYrsaa	Your parents are racist.  Tell them that color doesn't matter, because it doesn't at all.  If you like this guy, don't let it be awkward, and start dating him.  Your parents have the dumbest reason in the world for why you shouldn't be dating this guy, and it's not even a reason so...go for it.|`|58eFDvwsaa	your parents are racist.    heres a good idea, dont let your parents control your life. you are you and your parents are your parents.    stop telling them whats going on, other wise how will you ever grow up and escape them!|`|wtUmW35yaa	omg if you like him does it really matter what anyone else thinks??? at least if it doesn't work out you can always say that you tried and by the way things never last very long when ur 13 been there done that but if u really like him  u neva no.

7TQ5qGWcaa	The beauty of a woman is not in the clothes she wears,the figure she carries or the way she combs her hair,the beauty of a woman must be seen from her eyes,because that is the doorway to her heart,the place where love resides.|`|wqtwzzPeaa	The ugliest guy.|`|QBV4cFbqaa	UGLIEST Guy ON EARTH!
YqsND3Wmaa	It sounds like he likes you but it's turning a little stalkerish.|`|mTUQSlcpaa	Are you sure your not being investigated by the legal authority's.For some one to keep calling to get your schedule and address of place of employment sounds to mean like they either don't have a pen ,pencil and paper or attention deficit disorder.  In either event if they can't afford a pen they can't afford to date you! and if they have  such a memory lost they won't pick you up for the date( won't remember the address or date). Just like he forgets to show up after the calls been placed to your job and so many time's he's been a no show.That guy and his friend is just playing with you.And weird.He's old enough to approach you on his own. I mean what's going to happen on your dates? Will he bring his friends along and have them speak to you for him.Forget about it!! Forget about him.|`|JO3j4fpXaa	Why don't you try talking to him? He might be playing games. Ask around. See who knows him well enough to know what he's really like. Sounds a bit creepy to me. But never judge a book by its cover - prehaps he's just shy!|`|S01bUeHGaa	sounds like a creepy stalker to me!  call the police!

Dump him.|`|A6q6Ravhaa	yes|`|pvJH5HQ5aa	He loves you.|`|VSCYTZ38aa	It possibly means that he has issues and if you keep dating him he will leech on to you like no other and irritate you by proposing in three weeks and then start stalking you when you tell him you don't want to see him any more.|`|26eb811a3389534c3b02e6e2bb665965aa	He wants to hit it.|`|RncUc0traa	y will he tell u that to run away|`|CUc2gqzjaa	he cants wait till you guys have sex|`|54d31d8ca1d93393903fc5f7a7334431aa	CONTROL FREAK|`|8HnLYjK4aa	it means you are in big trouble. you should probably go ahead and get the restraining order started.|`|WPbwiGafaa	no|`|c0db8316a912bd936937ebd1b485c0e2aa	He sounds controlling to me...|`|kg6H6HDuaa	What he said is basically that he will not stick around for you to fall in love he is falling for you and wants to see that you are feeling strongly for him too.    Aquarius man and love.   Deep inside he longs for love but this causes him inner trouble because of his inability to understand emotion so an Aquarius man in love often stumbles on his own words, be patient with him and don't hold it against him because deep inside, he is having fun. Beware that an Aquarius man can fall out of love as easily as falling in love. The woman has to be able to adapt to him, he will not change for anybody and demands respect and understanding for the way he is, no matter how eccentric his ideals are.|`|9b6e3856ff9fd505bdf5544026fe01dfaa	it means so that he can run over you|`|uEs6VwyIaa	i am confused    sorry     fall in love and live together|`|xKcphGWIaa	Well if he said that, he's maybe starting to fall in love with you, but first he needs to know if you feel the same way, cuz if you dont he might change his mind ... you know what im saying ??  its sort of hard to explain ! =/|`|9Eq2Xxbmaa	mmm i think he probably said that lightly -- there most likely wasnt too much depth behind it. u never know whats going to happen when love comes around, but if you do start to love him, tell him. it will be worth it, especially if he did make that comment and meant something by it|`|AA11943537	It might mean that when you fall in love with him, he will treat you like gold.  Or it could just be a line.  Or he could be feeling like he's falling for you.  Aquarius's a more sensitive and will tell you stuff like this.|`|kedcv0glaa	He sounds pushy...or he wants to screw you.|`|Sagc26Rcaa	he wants to get laid|`|uJ9waJDYaa	He just said it to hint he really likes you and probably wants to move faster.  Don't force yourself to like him more and more because he has said this,  lt things take their toll and go at their Natural speed, that's the only way   you know if any feelings are true.    Good luck|`|sK73UzbUaa	he's tired of waiting for you... if you love him..tell him as soon as possible... before it's too late... and regrets are all left...
zHq5Pfvvaa	well i mean i don't think its just a male thing i mean i don't like them either i think there just kinda gross i mean its not that they don't like them its just theres really nothing most ppl find beautiful about them u kno and well ya i suppose its a preference thing i suppose but to be honest for ppl like me i don't like it when ppl even touch my feet even my own bf|`|ckATQTouaa	your question is absurd! it is as good as asking why doesn't evrey woman have beautiful feet?|`|AA10339249	Some men do have a foot fetish, so if you like that, then I'd look for those guys. For the rest of us, feet just look funny, especially larger than normal appendages. lol|`|tZ4Kyc0Waa	they just don't like rubbing them when they could be scoring|`|8A6A7UjLaa	i have a foot fetish you a**hole  jk|`|6wxgyGy5aa	I think if asked, most people would rank feet as their least favourite part of a persons body.  I know it's not just men who don't like feet..most women I know don't like feet either.|`|DDybzauSaa	Some girls have very sexy feet; but on most its just not the best part... For me, I'd say that its on a case by case basis...|`|U1e7wJgYaa	most of the time women dont care their feet so they seem crusty|`|mr9Zb9biaa	I don't know if men dont like feet.    I think some do, actualy!    But, I know, I hate all feet. EW! :(|`|Wy0lUjP9aa	Well, I heard they don't like ugly feet, like your second toe being longer than the first and maybe some other things. But who has perfect feet, it is going to take a while for them to find someone special if they want to be picky.|`|cUx9S1d1aa	some do|`|X6hK915Naa	i have a foot fetish (i really do) a womans feet are not disgusting right next to the legs they are the 2nd most attractive part i think|`|f43be0279e4f60717eb598a32d93faa0aa	When asked by a woman, 'What don't you like about me?' maybe it's the safest answer!
40qTdKuPaa	You know a guy is interested in you when he talk to a lot, and goes out of his way to talk to you. If he is always staring at you, smiles at you, and is a little shy around you. But a sure way to know, is just to ask him, and if he is a little shy, tell him that you like him, so he can come clean with you! Hope this helps.|`|mvZTm2pjaa	he flirts with u alot.   and trys to talk to you sometimes.   :D  andd.. u catch him staring at u occasionalllly .   :D   goood luck |`|0sPQnq7oaa	He will:  look at you a lot.  call you when he says to.  hang out with you when he makes plans with you.  if he has to bail on those plans, he will apologize for hours and make it up to you.  he will ask you out.    If he's not doing these things, and more, he's not into you.
CxshSxnHaa	as much as you don't want to, i'm sorry. i think the best way, is to end the relationship. if she continues to ignore and change the subject, just dump her. :[|`|jXAJZ23Saa	this might hurt, but i just dont think shes interested. but she might not want to hurt your feelings by breaking it off so id do it before she does. sorrt pall xx|`|A0XMJi3faa	I'd probably move on...other fish in the sea scenario.|`|6Y9zWhvHaa	dump her. move on.
oUDDsVu5aa	I don't know I don't make it a habit of getting kicked or kneed in the nuts if some one is mad at me I stand so they can't do that you have to always protect the family jewels at all times so you don't have to feel the difference between the two but just for the sake of argument I would say either one will suck just as much and drop you to your knees just as fast|`|WPbwiGafaa	getting your heart broken|`|6Y9zWhvHaa	i feel your pain brother. i would say the knee hurts more.|`|fe8aa5495caab3873690c07d37e65268aa	I would think it hurts the same both ways.|`|4293T0LNaa	im gonne guess that they both probably hurt alot, but maybe it would hurt more if u were kicked with high heeled shoes, the pointy kind!!|`|wCqzSt34aa	i would definately say gettin kicked hurts more, cuz there is more momentum involved lol|`|Ohncxt5Oaa	kicked|`|9b6e3856ff9fd505bdf5544026fe01dfaa	why dont you try|`|xRkXbmI4aa	why donbt u try and tell us then|`|eRGWEJOyaa	Depends on the knee and the foot...and how mad the kicker/kneeer is.  This answer is stupid only because the question is stupid.  You get what you ask for.|`|bC2ILdqOaa	well, being kicked would have power but more speed, when the knee would have lots more power but less speed.
66l0BPhaaa	it is the way your lips are positioned, you showing a tiny bit of teeth. put them together or smile. that would make if really nice.|`|IPS3hWweaa	Very nice! Change it!|`|ba428f6f619bfc67fa65e92c90d4c839aa	Very nice!  You are a beautiful girl.|`|WLWojBO4aa	its deff a nice pic.

K8lxbOdqaa	deffinately like beyonce body...slim stomach great figure, sexy curves and butt and good breasts|`|PIQeh6kCaa	Both, any, all. The more the merrier.|`|smyhq0Ggaa	Virtually everyone who asks this wants people to say curvy.    For me it varies between people, I find all of the women you mentioned sexy so body shape doesn't come into it a lot unless its extreme.    At least you got good examples of curvy women, a lot of women take curvy to mean fat when it just doesn't.|`|aUDVBmZSaa	A combination of curvy and thin is good. I don't why some girls think being curvy is having fat on you cause it is NOT.|`|ZCbkpnroaa	Thick/Curvy|`|pRjvM6Taaa	I love the curves of a woman....her hips, her buttocks, her breasts, the arch of her back, her legs...mmm....but not fat...she can be small and petite and still be very curvy.....God sure knew what he was doing! SMILE|`|MzSFaebraa	I'll take them all.
mINKANlAaa	i dont think that your age difference is a huge deal. your friend needs to get a life if shes gonna act that way. think about it, your friend wouldnt act like that if you were 14 and the boy was 15 so whats the difference. nothing to get worked up about. plus if you and the boy really like eachother, go for it girl! :)|`|ubk21UBvaa	pshhh, cougars are like 20 years older! one year is nothing!    love is blind. and age doesnt matter    although girls do mature faster than guys. and you might see a relationship differently. like you might be looking for real love, and he only wants a girl for action.    but if hes mature and sweet, go for it!|`|ba428f6f619bfc67fa65e92c90d4c839aa	First of all you are not a cougar!  Your definition is much closer to being correct.  Second, your only a year older?  That is nothing, I am currently seeing a girl that is 9 years younger than me.  We have the best relationship I have ever had.  Age means nothing when you are in love.  Now that being said I really doubt that at your age you are really in love.  But just go with it and have fun.    A 15 yo cougar.... who ever heard of such a thing.  Ridiculous.|`|caArlzCvaa	Girl friend, its not a big deal. lol its just 1 yr older :]|`|JEqt3dDRaa	a year and a half!?  dude that is nothing...me and this guy liked each other and he was 5 yrs older than me, of course notihng happened but still....    you have absolutly NOTHING to worry about. ur friend is prolly just jelous!|`|2BEMSGPdaa	tHE PROBLEM IS MORE  WITH THE LAWS. iN MOST STATES 18 CANNOT  "dATE" A 17. If there is  any problem they arrest the 18 right away. That is not right. Perhaps they should require there be like at least a 4 year gap before it becomes a crime..|`|3uls2NlXaa	um its one year, no biggie|`|W618lfZ6aa	Haha, 1 year is nothing, you two are still young so it might cause issues socially, but if you two like each other go at it, ignore what your friend is saying to you.    When you are 20+ age has no merit.|`|bl7ZzF9saa	a cougar is like a 45 year old women dating a 23 year old man. You are def not a cougar. And one year age difference is not a big deal ....dont listen to you friends. they clearly have no clue what they are talking about.|`|1117d18f8d71cf8ea1aa8a2c83b3cb4daa	No your not a cougar, you friends sound lame.. a year younger is no big deal!! They're immature.. so if you really like each other then it's perfect..|`|jtEk35keaa	He is just a year younger it's no big deal. If you like him then you should go out with him.|`|MpNCNQU5aa	that is sooooo not a age difference
Y4Ye3OLOaa	Someone i enjoy being with, relate to,  who's there for me as I'm there for her|`|p3nREIklaa	Go ask Marco, why you asking me....|`|PIQeh6kCaa	A lady in public and a total sl..t in bed.|`|k1wAbgiHaa	Feed me  Sleep with me  Be quiet    SteveC|`|TpBHi8S2aa	Someone who I can look forward to spending the rest of my life with....
wzXJOSIeaa	Men want woman to need them. They can't stand when a woman is independent. They want to be in control and the only person in your life. They run all your friends off so that they feel like they are so important because they are all you have left. I don't know why men are like that but it NEEDS to change. They need to learn to chill out and just enjoy a woman's love.|`|844DGAMmaa	Did you read what you just typed?    Also, which sex is more focused on getting married? Oh that's right, women.|`|q4b4f76Haa	Your question doesn't make any sense hun. For most women, the goal of their life is to find a man .  Life without a man is very tough, so be it 2009 or 1969, women will always need a man in their life
15429576f39fecdb6423a3bfaca3e7c8aa	Just be nice to her. Tell her what you like about her (give compliments, nice eyes...etc.) Ask her things about herself and see if you have any similar interests.|`|0iiaxpUSaa	It seems hard, but the first step to talking to her is going up and saying, "Hi, I'm *whatever your name is*."  She will automatically say hi too.  And BAM, you got yourself a conversation!!!!  Awkward silences... you ask her a question or say something completely random or remark on one of the gay teachers.    eg. "So, hows life?"  "I like your hair,"  "Mr. Paulsen seemed very happy today, must've gotten a new boyfriend,"  "Did you study for that test on Friday?"  "Have you seen The Heartbreak Kid,"  Or whatever comes to mind...

7s0GWKODaa	awww you should talk to her! but little advice plz don't say "when i count my blessings i'll count you twice" when your texting her. It sounds sweet if you call her then tell her that. then if you really want to go out with her ask out on a date (still on the phone) Just do fun stuff with her like movies & what not or ask what does she likes to do and do it. :] she'll be soo impressed   i hope this helps! :]|`|JEqt3dDRaa	aww thats adoroble!!!!!!!!!!!!!    yes totally|`|Tog7CqTcaa	speaking as another 14-year-old, i wouldn't. it's cute but at the same time a little weird, and it shows you have enough confidence to say that which could also mean you have enough confidence to be a player and stuff. it's a little to cliche to sound sincere.    well don't start the conversation with it. but if you feel that its right at the end, you can say it after you say goodbye.|`|xDlBM6N6aa	That sounds cute, and really nice.  Say exactly that, and she what happens.|`|nZ4cOSDZaa	think that's sweet|`|GLBWe3A9aa	Don't its cheesy.  If i were you next time you see her take her to one side and ask her out.  She had the courage to ask you to date night, return the favour.|`|uzYHWdgPaa	No, pleased don't, it sounds like a bad pick-up line. But you sound really sweet and so she's very lucky.   Text her this: Hey beautiful, how are you?    it's low key and will make her think you like her without trying to hard.

vqUVWPBAaa	I would suggest counseling. It sounds like your father has not dealt with the death of your mother. He could be blaming himself, counseling could be good for the entire family, including your stepmother.|`|67EaIAvbaa	you need to sit down with your dad and let him know what is going on..maybe a walk in the park..looks like you have important stuff in you that needs to come out..or it will get worse.|`|gpBicBEPaa	Avoid molestation.|`|wd0NmW0saa	First of all, this is not your fault. I think this is something that only time and God can heal. It may be hard on your dad for awhile, but as time goes on and he sees the person who you are your relationship will more than likely change. Ask him to go places with you. Also, I think its important to try to have a good relationship with your step mom if you dont already have one. : ) Hope that helps thats a rough spot to be in!|`|peckUVpzaa	That's really sad...  not only that it sounds like he still has feelings for your mom... Just tell him clear out that your are not your mom but I am ME somebody different, I am not her. Don't blame yourself and I doubt that your father blames this on you. I think he is only blaming himself...|`|diAqosiIaa	relationship goes both ways so when you do go and talk to him just make sure he is ready and willing and the same goes for you.....you both have been through so much pain so it will be hard at first but you could start by telling him how much you do care about him you guys should open up to one another...not saying be best friends but make sure that thier is that dad and daughter relationship there(you guys might feel like strangers towards one another)....you guys could hang out go somewhere for a lil while just to talk and then when you guys are both ready ask him to talk to you about your mom since you dont know but these things take time so dont rush things in one session....hope i have helped and be strong|`|UU0KkXhEaa	I'm really sorry about your mom :(  My advice is to do some ''bonding'' with your dad. Maybe even look at an old photo album of pictures of your mom. Sure it'll be uncomfortable at first, but just hold on. After a while, talking about your mom will be normal, still a bit painful, but normal. Your father will realize she's gone, but that he has YOU. :D

7294c9edbf7c247468b6e48776c6fcadaa	Actually a lot of it does not have anything to do with age.    common socioeconomic status, common interest, common goals, common maturity levels, common sexual drive{and that is not age related} more like if you both prefer the mornings when you wake up, the evenings when you go to bed.  I've dated women my age who were as dingy as a twelve year old.  I've dated women who were a lot younger that were more mature than I was.|`|AA10743159	Smart girl, you got to the heart of the matter, sure some will date older guys, because, they drive better cars, can take them to places, that other men their own age can't do.  But it's mainly the fact, that older men, with a lot more experience with women, treat them differently. The men and also, over the moon, that they can catch a  young girl. We have all heard the term "Trophy Wife"  When an older guy, walks out with some young honey on his arm, he's telling his peers, "See what I've got, Eat your heart out"  Then there are girls who have Daddy Issues, and are looking for that love, their Dads never gave them.   I am sure there are times, when two people, just hit it off and make a good combination, irregardless of their ages.|`|29maScwJaa	Lol what in God's name is alterly... lol    I think that age gaps that are that big are unacceptable. Like if all the old men take the women of our generation, what do we have left to choose from? Adult life isn't very fair.|`|e28P8gWraa	Most women would prefer if her man had money, but none of them really care that much about it if he has other qualities. Most women that date older men are looking for the qualities she assumes in him mostly maturity, responsibility, family values, manliness, experience in life.|`|8vfCRg7Caa	27 to 40, who gives a rats ***. 19 to 40, wholy crap, different ball game. And not that older but alot of girls date older men and marry older men cause we are late bloomers on how to treat a woman and how to pay our bills and be responsible. Ol men are consistant, and they dont have the sex drive younger men have were they want to screw everything. So thats another reason. And money matters. Anybody who says money doesnt matter is a liar. No matter if its how you manage it, what you spend it on, if you have it or not, it matters in any relationship. Usually in the top 10 reasons for breakups. But the real answer women who date older guys want consistancy and guys who know who they are and where they are going in life. Younger men just dont have that usually. And thats a guess, im not a woman so take as you will
BeSteUwwaa	Same situation happened to me, except with my girlfriend.    The thing is about first impressions, if its ruined and you're still with them..eventually your parents will just grow onto him/get use to you guys being together.    Here is something that I did and it helped the situation a little bit.  I told my parents that my girlfriend was goal orientated, knows where she is going in life and HOW to get there, looks out for my well being and respects me.     Good luck|`|FqgRGfnfaa	Announce it over dinner like its no big deal. Thats how I say everything. It also is quite entertaining for your siblings to watch when you do this
lmESBQb7aa	"The most effective way to remember your wife's birthday is to forget it once."    I thought it was funny! It really is true though. I think most guys are scared, cause we know what happens if we miss their birthday!|`|tTmRjUV5aa	This married guy wasn't getting any from his wife and was really really horny, so he walks into a whore house to get himself a good f**k. On the inside he remembers that he's a bit short on cash so he says to the mistress:    - "Listen, I only have five dollars, can you help me out?"  The lady says:  - "Sure, go up the stairs and go in the door on the right."  The guy goes up the stairs and in through the door. He sees a chicken sitting on a table. He is a little disappointed but  he figures:  - "Oh well you get what you pay for!", and he screws that chicken to near death, there are feathers flying everywhere.     So the next day the guy is still hormy and he had a really great time with the chicken and decides to go back to the whorehouse. He says to the madam:    - "Listen lady, I've only got two bucks today. Can you do anything at all for me?"  - "Sure!" says the madam. "Go up the stairs and in the door on the left this time".    The guy goes in through the door on the left and finds a bunch of guys staring through a two-way mirror at two beautiful lesbians having sex.    -"This is fantastic. Only two bucks for this!!" the guy says to one of the other men. The other man says  - "Yes, but you should have been here yesterday, there was guy in there ******* a chicken!"

8xPWd35maa	I think when you're having sex, you aren't worried about things like that.  You and your partner will find a comfortable position after time.  You probably want to keep it wet so that the penis will slide in easier.|`|3YpVVRWpaa	do whats gives pleasure for you. if you open your legs the penis goes much deeper but the vaginal pleasure point is not that far from your opening.  play with yourself find what you like you will know what you want with your boys penis
rmC59Zv9aa	if im not dating a girl... i wouldnt want her to get me a gift... thats just me, I'm happy if the girl puts her time and money into her looks on v-day rather than a gift
L4gtJfNmaa	If you are at least 21, have 2 beers then talk to her, it does wonders.  But just think about what might happen if you took multiple courses of action.    Course of action 1:  Keep being shy and dont talk to her.    Outcome 1: Nothing happens and you regret it later in life    Outcome 2: Someone else snags her first and you never get another chance and regret it later.    Outcome 3: She likes shy guys and has secretly wanted you for a while.  She asks you out and you both live happily ever after.  Fat chance.      Course of action 2:  Walk right up to her, tell her you have trouble talking to pretty girls but that you just couldnt resist this time.  get her number and ask her out.    Outcome 1:  She says no.  You feel bad for a short while, but life goes on.  You have no regrets in the future and will be more experienced and less nervous with the next one.    Outcome 2:  She says yes and you both live happily ever after.    Outcome 3:  The universe collapses upon itself and life as we know it ends.  fat chance    Seriously, its like tearing of a bandaid.  try not to think to hard and do it quickly and in one single motion.  If you take course of action 1 you fell bad, period.  if you take course of action 2 you may fell bad, but at least you have a chance.|`|b1b6e3d33b1a99da35a245dd5c6cae76aa	Talk to your friends about it. Im sure they would have a better idea rather then people you never met.    But i would just talk to her girls love confidence.|`|QUJIwRUcaa	Deep breaths, pretend she is one of your pals. Basically, JUST CHILL!  :)|`|BLTq0vLWaa	Just talk to her, If she rejects you, suck it up and move on to the next one ;)    Trial and Error :P
nLiCiRnSaa	one word.  cleavage|`|d508e71226a169afed7ebfc7e78bbc5baa	I have always found that when you dress the part and put the signals out there like hey check my goods out and maybe I might tell you the time of day you will go far, if this backfires you can always pin a sign on your back saying "Will work for a male and do what is needed" and have a look of desperation .  I don't advise the last as it is kinda degrading for a guy to be seen with ya.  I wish you the best of luck in your endeavors|`|rZuSN2kTaa	Try to wear short skirts, a fitted shirt, and make-up.|`|kX1PolCUaa	maybe hang out with them as friends less, so when you do see them its more like WOAHSHESHOT ?|`|AdTnizwOaa	Don't try too hard, the same thing is happening with me except i never cared to ask or flirt with them :P The right guy will come around sometimes but yeah it hurts to see them flirting with other girls rather then your self.|`|ts6kwthAaa	Cleavage tends to work.|`|cqYi0OYXaa	your either ugly as sin or just more of a boy than a girl...thats not cool you need to be more girls...take a look at mean girls and be bitc*hs like them|`|XoYHF1RLaa	wear skimpier clothing.|`|yuF2K1rLaa	Just be straight up with a guy youll find one.  ...sexual activites are always good too.(coming from a boy)|`|rTwsdq6kaa	don't know how you look like but try not to come on too hard or you won't be seen as a challenge|`|L4gtJfNmaa	Two thing:    Act more slutty    Ask out a guy without first being friends|`|AA10743159	Easy, stop being one of the "guys". . All those guy friends you have, don't really see you as a girl, they see you as a friend, nothing more.  You are just one of "them".  So you need to back of, hanging around them so much, dress a bit more girly, wear dresses instead of jeans or pants.   Stay away from them for a few weeks if you can, then doll yourself up, in some pretty cute outfit and with a touch of make up, and then go see them.  I think you will find a totally different reception from those boys.|`|zWB3jHHPaa	wow i thought only guys had this problem..  idk grow some boobs and a nice a$$, guys seem to like that in a girl.. or stop being such a mega tomboy.  I'm not telling you to go out there and act like a whore but if your gonna act like a boy all the time they're gonna treat you like one and not date you, unless they're gay and in the closet or something (=|`|yGWQuL81aa	I use to have the same problem in middle school, it sucked. I had at least 3 times as many guy friends then friends that were girls, and since I use to hang out with them so much, they would just ask me about girls, and how to act around them and they never really considered me. I started hanging out with more of the girls and not much at all with the guys, and dressing a little girlier. It seemed to help, they instantly were hitting on me.|`|hrjRq0Sjaa	be not ugly|`|AA10339139	just be friendly and be yourself|`|m8A8rj2Qaa	haha you should listen to katy perrys "one of the boys"|`|AZYv4B8oaa	your actions are worth a million words.....SHOW her you love her TELLing her is not always the best way cause she may not be ready to love yet but actions......she will warm up to the idea quickly|`|lZ7zfzLRaa	well it sounds like you are one of those, "one of the guys" girls. so cut it out. stop acting all buddy-buddy with guys when you first meet them and go for it!|`|zV7Qp7dbaa	make up and be very outgoing by saying hey! not hi and stuff like that good luck :D|`|h0z5S6BSaa	It's the reverse problem with me.  You just gotta be direct with a guy you like, or flirt a lot and give him a sign.|`|Tc1BO5kkaa	be more feminin? idk its hard, you didnt give much out about how you look and act.|`|NhSz7Xedaa	Start wearing flirty clothing. Don't go on too strong. They're just used to you.

But maybe wear more girly clothing and make up. Be more hard to get instead of acting like a friend.|`|CJWC4znPaa	oh well try to change the way you dress and act maybe    like have time to hang out with girls to and like that you'll become one of the girls and well have better luck with guys|`|zNRTCpmbaa	I'm just like you,  i have many guy friends, but none seem to be interested in me.  don't flirt to the point where they get freaked out,  take it easy, and try not be a "buddy", show yourself as more then a friend without being to subtle!    and if they still don't have interest in you, try somewhere else, maybe they just see you as a best friend or sisterly-like.    and if they don't bother with you, don't stress over them,  guys are assholes anyways.  why would you even want to get involved with them!?|`|zdMFykrsaa	Friends hang out. They don't want to or "don't have the time" too. In my opinion, you don't even seem like a friend. Sorry.    Try being more girly. Like the other people said. Wear make-up especially mascara. Wear short shorts, or skirts. Wear v neck shirts.    Unfortunately, guys are really attracted to the "slutty" girls. Well, most guys.|`|ToYmTw8gaa	hahaha listen to the song "one of the boys" by katy perry it totally sounds like u lol. anyways back to ur question lol umm i think you should get like a really nice shirt, something you think looks really good and try to do ur hair rlly pretty and stuff and come into school looking rlly georgeous and maybe it will shock them a little and get them thinking about u in a diff way lol
jp9OzuXoaa	Me and my best friend are like twin sisters. There's no other way to describe it. We're always on the same page, we know where we stand with each other and we have mostly the same interests. My best friend is 100% loyal and trustworthy too. She's been there through my darkest hours and seen me at my worst. There was even a time I pretty much had no one but her and yet she still stood by me (That is usually when most people's "best friends" leave; mine didn't though). And of course vice versa. I would do the same thing for her.|`|e7f7b9508f28f00c8e34cd692587ca8caa	being there fro each other no matter what|`|xZSRDNVOaa	I can talk to her about almost anything and she'll understand. Plus i can have fun with her|`|Rch68tXlaa	She is there for me through thick and thin.I can talk to her about everything and anything.We are there for each other.We just understand each other and that's what best friends are for.She's also great at giving advice.    I Love My Best Friend
iqZUd5Fdaa	You already sound like you're pretty in-tune with his body language, just keep looking out for those little things, but particularly eye contact. We say so much with our eyes, its the most primitive part of human nature, we have no control over it we instinctively look at things that we like and are curious about. Not so much when you're in a conversation, we maintain eye contact in conversation to keep peoples attention its not so much a sign of attraction. But if he's looking at you a lot when you're not talking or at the other end of the room, that's the thing to look out for. It means, he's thinking about you and looking out to see what you're doing, and he would only do that if he was interested in you    What you can do about it, is put him to the test :)    Next time he looks at you, don't look away. Just see how long you can hold it, if he doesnt back down, you're on to a sure thing. I actually tried his once on a guy i really liked, it was so intense, he was sat opposite me, and i caught him looking, and i just looked back, only for about 3 seconds, but it felt like forever, and he smiled, and i smiled, like we suddenly had this mutual understanding. A week later he asked me on a date, so there you go|`|4WT1IBqtaa	uhh... idk|`|zKEVdGv2aa	I've found that the people like this are doing it because they enjoy being a flirt and making friends with everyone. If he is seriously interested in you, eventually he will make it much more obvious. However I have found that the best boyfriends are usually the ones who are not big flirts with everyone.|`|AXUz7R4Raa	sorry to say that i don't entirely know  if he likes you but most of the out going guys i know will  calm down around a girl he likes and not be a touchy around you because  he does not want to  make you feel uncomfortable around him he want to get to know the real you so he can find out if he truly likes you or not.|`|nO2vflnPaa	I think if he likes you, you would know it by now. He would make it more obvious to you|`|e7f7b9508f28f00c8e34cd692587ca8caa	U would know if he liked U|`|B3napPyKaa	i actually know a guy like that that i am interested in at the moment. Yes, sometimes touchy feely guys are like that to everyone, but i would look for something special that he ONLY does to you. For example, if he blinks alot while looking at you, or a crooked smile, or an eyebrow raise, even something like touching your hair or face... If not, keep trying! You will make the connection i know it.  best of luck.|`|Ej5ykFwYaa	Don't worry ! This is supposed to be fun,   He likes you of course. And if he's affectionate with every one lucky you. The more up tight you get about him touching other people the less likely he will continue to like you. just relax and accept him for who he is.|`|FZMVjKweaa	i am one of those kinda guys but i do that with every1 and the girl i like i treat her the same but a little more special so she knows and if u have a gut feeling that he likes then he does, if ur in a class or a party and he comes up too and gives u more attention then hes trying to get your attention,  the chances are that he is shy about asking u out so u are gonna have to get him alone and tell him ur feelings.  if a girl told me how she felt i would have lots of respect and say yeah
af644b7256e7bf5a53974bb99a32d482aa	If I were you, I would tell him to DEAL with the fact that you can do what you like....or "there's the door!"  Sounds like he's trying to be your father instead of a husband, do not let him control you! You are American, therefore free.|`|dd2d386096f95b4c9c13d046234f4dddaa	I suspect that now that the "honeymoon" phase has worn off he is becoming aware of all the things you do that contradict his upbringing as a Muslim.. He may be getting pressure from his family or community.|`|CCFhjtNBaa	Why you marry an muslim? theres an reason they stick to their own kind|`|iZbgUtxcaa	Ha ha it set in for him that you are not going to leave him.    Ever.    Honey if you really did not know him before marriage, this is about the time when the good behavior's expiration date kicks in.      I would NEVER be with a Muslim man EVER for these very reasons.  Most of them are raised to disrespect women.  WTF were you thinking?  Does this cat look like Omar f'ing Shariff or something?|`|n8vBnA9Iaa	You married a muslim man, biggest mistake right there.  What made you think that you could ever change his way of thinking and accepting your American ways? The women are so repressed over  that you would think that you would be any different?  Fine, you can't help who you love but a muslim man?     Never in a million years.|`|uvWuVWb1aa	There's no compromise. It's your body.. and if you want to wear makeup to work, then he can get over it. If it ends in divorce, you may be better off. Most of the time, people like that don't change.|`|gjaPNWbTaa	You NEVER discussed this prior to marriage?  Why not???    I almost never tell someone this with so little information - but if what you are saying is accurate - divorce him.  ASAP.  This has nowhere but down to go.     NEXT TIME use your head when you get married.    EDIT I see no mention of kids.  If you have kids with him, then I'm afraid you should try to work this out, but do not let him totally dominate you like that.|`|1epjqrflaa	I think you should not have married a Muslim.|`|AA12202402	if these things didn't bother him and you was told it wouldn't bother him and now they pop up and make him upset maybe his mind has changed about the things he thought he could handle as you first got marriage.d. Now is the time to talk and compromise and find out if you can do this enough to make the marriage work and find out if he is also willing to compromise too. No one can actually make a promise like that 100% ly.......times years etc change a person.......

I don't think the problem is that she hates what you do. I think she might want you to start doing things with her more often. Maybe she feels second place compared to your hobbies. (Which i doubt)    You should take her on a romantic meal or something with just the two of you. Doing stuff like that for her will get her off your back about the things you like to do.

ycNxVrUfaa	Your ex is trying to intimidate you. He deserted you and your son so I seriously doubt a judge would even consider giving him much custody, let alone full custody. Get some legal help. Divorce his sorry butt. The military does not look favororably upon deadbeat dads. You actually have a much better case than you think. If you can't afford an attorney, go to legal aid. Trust me, it will be worth every dime. I wish you the best.|`|dd2d386096f95b4c9c13d046234f4dddaa	Legally, you can apply for joint custody (with you having residential custody) and child support.      He is legally obligated to pay child support, even if you're not divorced.|`|bUig1Fmlaa	Document everything that is happened, including as many dates and specific incidents as possible.    Get to a lawyer as soon as possible to learn your rights.    Don't let him bully you into thinking he can get custody.

Immediately go to you rlocal courthouse, Child SUpport or Family Court Division and GET SOME GUIDANCE!  They will have froms for you to fill out, will need previous years tax forms, birth certificate and sometimes a Paternity Declaration (hopefully obtained when child was born), everyone's SS  too.  Let them do the work for you.  Unless you are proven a drug addicted prostitute no one is going to take your child.  They probably won't give 505-50 because your son is too small.  You will have advocacy throughout the process.  No one can take your child unless they have severe reasons!  HELLO?  Look at the headlines....

He's not satisfied with you, so your okay with bringing another girl into the equation? So if this supposedly satisfies him, then what's next? 3somes every other night? Affairs? This is your husband telling you that he needs to cheat on you and your going right along with it. I don't think you want it to happen at all, I think that you want to please him so badly that you are willing to watch him screw another girl, right in front of you. Good luck with all the feelings its going to bring you and make you feel. Even the most self assured/ confident women, still have a very hard time watching their man stick it in another woman.   I hope you realize that your little plan may back fire, then what? All for a cheap f*ck. Do you really think its worth it?    Learn how to sexually satisfy your husband before you think another woman is going to. Have some common sense.|`|gjaPNWbTaa	1st - I am a swinger.    2nd - this is the WORST reason to go there for this sort of thing (that he is not sexually satisfied)    3rd - in the event you ignore what I just said, stay away from anyone you already know.      EVERY guy wants this - that's not a big deal.  What IS a big deal is that he is not happy with you on your own.

But emotionally it makes the physical feel better.  I lost my virginity late (age 25).  It's not that different from anything that you've experienced, just a new phase.

Also, now follow me on this one, you kissed another guy in a drunken snog and YOU feel hurt? With all due respect, he has more right to feel hurt than you - it was you that hurt him in this instance with your indescretion, not vice versa. Probably not what you wanted to hear, but would you rather have my honest opinion or a fabricated version to give you false hope or something? Stay well. :D|`|qmXFCVMIaa	ok to put this into perspective...he had sex with player girl, but he is mad at you for kissing a guy while drunk.  1. DUMP THE CHUMP  2.

6c8f7169075cda44362fe00b907ef3f0aa	You can't convince a girl to love you. It has to happen naturally; a spark that attracts the both of you. Maybe you should give her time to think about what you have said.|`|tZtBOdJyaa	Learn to spell.

At 16, you should be old enough to hang out with him. Maybe your mom would let you, but she was just mad that you didn't tell her about him that time. Just talk to her, and say "You know mom, I met this guy, I kinda wanna hang out with him, is that okay?" something along those lines. Just see what she says, and if she gives in you'll feel better because you'll not have to sneak around like that.
VEew2pkCaa	You parents kill me with this I can't control my child.  First of all at 13 it's to late to enforce rules you should have done that 13 years ago.  Second you are still the parent and that is disrespectful and respect should be demanded but you cannot walk around using fowl language and accept sometimes and find if offensive at others.  Tell her you will not have that type of behavior.  You stop it to.  It is very possible to be angry and express yourself without using bad words.  Her mother needs to enforce it to. That is not cute.  Plus in the times we are living in kids go to different extents to get back at ppl they are angry with.  She will try that with the wrong person and get hurt very badly.  So change your ways to set the example, and even if you don't she is to stop immediately.  Or take everything away.  It may be to late and you may be stuck with that til she leaves your house.  But don't give her what she wants just give her her needs until it stops. Be the role model you want your children to follow.  Life is short, their future depend on what you teach them now.  NO JOBS or anything else with these rude attitudes and behaviors.|`|XK39IXh6aa	She has learned this from you.|`|G5md2xf1aa	Rehab time for you guys.

Avoid the whole 'big group of friends' thing - this was what I had to do for my first date and it was awkward and embarassing and I hated every minute of it! Could just have been the guy i was with though!   Bowlings cool as well, gives you a chance to chat whilst having something to occupy your time so it doesn't get awkward!

Although the part that he hasn't called you back its kind of weird. I would try to call him and explain him that it was the alcohol and if you could start fresh. Otherwise I guess you just have to wait till he decides to call you again. Maybe he just needs some time to elaborate what happened.

It's all you can do to find out. No one on Yahoo Answers besides your boyfriend can tell you that, even if they are a boy. Boys have different minds. If he really knows YOU, then he would understand that it was a mistake...you know...and that its in the past and doesn't matter anymore. But, if he acts like a jerk about it then maybe he just isn't the one for you.

About your nipples, you still have to go through puberty, once you do. Your body also changes. Talking to an older girlfriend, who you can trust can also help. Don't be scared to ask. It's normal.  -Ruby( :    ps.

OBbuiqZ3aa	He's in love with you!!   No matter what you've done in the past, who your with, or what you do in the future, he will still love you. Those are the qualities of unconditional love.    When he says he's beginning to feel it, i think he already knows he feels it and is scared to admit it.            .|`|WQwCkbw8aa	he means he is in love with you...

No one can really make the decision for you, but I believe that you should confront him about him and see what he says. Its one thing to believe your friends, but its another to not believe your guy. If you feel like he isnt telling the tryth than thats when you dump him. I think that you deserve so much better.
HabNtVcKaa	You are different from most teenage girls or young women in general. It seems that you are very clear about what you want and you are on the right path. What I have learned throughout my early adulthood  is that people are going to judge you and try to bring you down no matter what you choose to do with yourself. You can't go around pleasing everyone, but I am sure you already knew that so just keep moving forward and do what is best for you. As for the guy thing... Most guys these days unfortunately will not wait until marriage. I think to find a guy like that you would have to find a guy that is religious. You never know however, there may be someone out there that will wait. Maybe all this online dating technology can help you find someone like that. As for falling in love, well it is not one of those things you can exactly control. Love is kinda abstract and defined by you, for you so if you don't want to fall in love then you will have to set boundaries for the people you let into your life, but remember that feelings just happen they are not something easily controlled. Yes, love can be a big distraction if you are in an unhealthy relationship. However, you can't just be all books and no fun. That is an unhealthy relationship with yourself. Dating can give you a chance to take a break and grow as a person as well. All the tools we need in life are not always found in books, we need life experience too, so don't close yourself off to the world.|`|zyTrMeovaa	WOW you could be "A" sexual|`|caArlzCvaa	If a guy really loved you, he would respect you and will wait to have sex till marriage.

I understand how it is, as a Christian striving to live the life of Christ everyday, I most of the time find myself at odds with the people I am surrounded by.  Doesn't mean you should hate them or dislike them, not everyone is as mature as you are.  Jesus Christ taught the life of abstinence before marriage, and I'm not trying to shove any religion down your throat, but just letting you know that there ARE people out there like that...|`|RpKnuAZFaa	I think that you should follow your dreams and keep to your goals. Ignore your family be your own person and do what is right for you. I recently did just that. My family wanted me to stay at the 4 year university i was at but i transferred to the community college i wanted to go to anyway and I love it I feel like i found somewhere i belong. So do what will be good for you. Personally i never was fond of dumb girls either. So my advice is stick to your dreams and do what you think is right for you. (listen to your parents advice but you dont have to do what they tell you, if you are over 18 that is, Its your life)   I hope this helps. And good luck with school.

08d1e5233f3b30ec082c65faefd9a480aa	Let it go and move on!!!!  He don't deserve you.  If he loved you then why did he start seeing someone else when you guys were planning on getting back together?  It won't be easy especially with having a child together, but you can do it!  If you do decide to get back with him then make sure you don't have any bitter feelings towards him and the fact that there is another womans baby on the way because you will drive yourself nuts.  Good luck!  Stay strong!
oUDDsVu5aa	Yes I agree with you on this   But that is for most but not all there is still a lot of people out here that feel as you do about women.I blame the generations before us for forgetting to teach their children how to treat women or anyone for that matter everyone caught up in their fast pace lives have just stopped caring about the true fiber of being faithful to their core values and when they don't feel it is important they don't feel it is important to teach their children until they look up and their woman is gone then they just say I should have done this and I should have done that and when they find someone new they forget again and it starts all over again.  when you never stop to smell the roses you tend to stop even seeing them and you never miss them until you notice they are gone and then you will stop and wish for their return.  Good question maybe you will make some people think with this one even though some will make a joke about it others will stop and think on it a while  best of luck|`|uVH046Fjaa	You're right, women are objects.|`|NWwGl4k6aa	they say women have all the power.  you know why it's true?  because women have all the vaginas|`|eFxN59SXaa	ahhh what a wonderful world this would be if all men thought that way!|`|7a2e4d4207a92f423c9e8649aceaf762aa	Being a 51 year old women, i am sorry to say that i am very disappointed at my own sex.

What ever happen to dignity and pride to be a lady, now women like me get laughed at for being old fashion. Women have the goal to get angry when men treat them like dogs, well if your going to behave like a BIT@  your going to be treated as one.|`|0967d46d02f1bd758bfcb38acf0a9aa5aa	Yes, men should learn to appreciate women who are honest, and hard working.   Those women who are lazy probably don't deserve it. Oh well, go ahead and flame me.       I try to appreciate men, but most of them are dis-respectful now a days. My husband is a rare gem! He is very considerate, respectful and a gentleman.|`|JKZUdhCPaa	You guys all suck|`|lStHi2GKaa	Do we love our women?  The question should be do our women love us?
l1zvTRVAaa	i know exactly what your going through! its the exact same for me. when you guys talk it feels like you are the one keeping the convo going? your the one asking the questions and trying to continue it. next time you talk, once your at a really good part of the convo tell him you have to go. as hard as it may seem, its better. the saying "stop while your a head" is what comes into play at this moment. if you stop the conversation when its at a high point, you'll leave him think, "wow! that was a good convo. I'm going to talk to her later" where as if you leave the conversation at a low point, or where its being dragged on, you'll leave him thinking "okay, that was really boring".          Now about the snow day. just start talking to him. ask him what his plans are, then let him know your not doing anything, but you don't want to stay home. wait and see if he gets the hint then if he doesn't, be like we should totally do something. or something along the lines. that way it looks like your just bored and looking for something to do, other than being needy. if you need anymore help, feel free to email me :) i'm going through the same thing right now so i may have some more pointers if you need them. good luck hun :D|`|MK5Ddtiiaa	Talk about sports! Guys love sports!|`|p3nREIklaa	Sure. When and where???|`|sbLqPIyoaa	You could talk about your interests. Like movies, music, sports, etc. Just casually bring it up. If you talk online and he asked whats up just say that you're listening to music and he'll ask who and it will just go from there.   I don't know exactly how to get him to go somewhere, but maybe you could say that your bored and that you wish there was something to do. Or maybe see if there's a movie that you both want to see!|`|3187cafaa9313c5c6575c8397c98a79eaa	here's good advise, guys don't like games. You don't need to come up with a "game plan" on how to do something to meet with him. Just ask him to meet up with you. You haven't realized yet that we don't think like women, to us it is either yes or no. You are looking to set a a way to control the situation with him rather then let things occur naturally. Just aks him, if he wants to he will say yes. don't be afraid of rejection. It happens. maybe he says yes, maybe he says no. if it's right, it's right, you cant make it right by running a game
N7kDc57Eaa	okay y'all have been together for 3 years NO GIRL can EVER move on not if they were with you for 3 years.. give her time let her date around and see what she is missing i promise i had this same experience i dated this boy for a year broke up with him dated someone else for 6 months and was like what the hell was i thinking i came back to they boy i dated for a year and now we are 100% more happier now.. give her time space but stay friends with her let her know you still care... and see what happens everything will work out i promise|`|ewbuVeTTaa	I'd move on. It's obvious she does not want you in that way again anytime soon. I wouldn't put your life on hold on account for her. I'm sorry that is a harsh way to put it, but as I often say, life is harsh. Best thing you can do is let her go, let your heart heal and move on. There are a lot of women out there, I'm sure if and when your heart is ready you'll be able to find someone else who is willing to move forward and grow with you.|`|xpiGWrdMaa	I know you are pained. The reality is you have already lost her. She wants to experience and explore other things.  She is in college and she is right in trying to do this for herself. It may be one of the hardest things you will have to do but you need to let her go.|`|TJiGs8S4aa	So you are in high school?  Sorry to say - but, please forget her.  She is a whiner, she has her feet mired in the past, and is afraid to grow up.  You are embracing growth and change, and she is throwing a pity party and stamping her feet on the floor.  Let her have the pity party; you will go on to much better things.  She is completely not worth it.  Move on, with joy.
poZfLPe0aa	First of all, tell your friend that her behavior is unacceptable. Tell her that you understand that life has been tough for her, but everyone has problems, and to move on.     Tell her if she was such a good friend, she wouldn't try to interfere with your ex. That's a violation of unspoken "girl rules." She should know better than to even THINK about talking to him.     She sounds like a terrible friend, and I personally think you're better off ditching her.
WgqJaOxQaa	I would let them know after I've known them for a while, but I'm bad at hiding crushes, so they usually figure it out right away.   I'm a little bit shy when I have a crush, I would leave hints. Like allowing them to catch me staring at them, or smiling when they look in my direction.|`|XtLZXIEyaa	Give your crush your number and tell him you would like to go out sometime.  See if he starts to warm up to you.|`|Df8GQoRkaa	Well depending on the person you like, i wouldn't make a move unless i feel like he's likes me back. i'd say once you are close to him/her. tell him/her whenever u feel comfortable. if you are shy or uncomfortable around them still, its probably not the right time yet.
Oua88nRiaa	Make those gestures, ya know? Like touch him lightly somewhere (stomach, neck, back usually works), and smile at him that special way, and he should get the hint. If not, you might just have to be real with him and ask him where this is going honestly. Guys are so hard to read sometimes, and it's very possible that he has NO idea what you are thinking so you might just have to tell him!|`|YqoxcTN9aa	put your arms around him or lay your head on his shoulder, or you make the 1rst move|`|wscyjkPAaa	Next time you're out.  Have a romantic conversation with him and tell him that you think its sweet when a man gives a woman a little peck on the lips.  If he doesn't kiss you, then he's dumb and you have to make the first move.|`|CYG3IOeYaa	well, make sure if you want to kiss him. every kiss is a special moment together. but if youre sure then look at his signs. if shows love and is all lovey dovey to you but is shy then go on a date and at the end give him a small peck on the cheek or the mouth. but if there are no signs, well then you know the conclusion. Personally i hate guys who are sure and arent bold enough to make the first move so i have to make the first move. but if this guys is a shy type, then u make the first move. hope this helps everyone!|`|RpKnuAZFaa	Make the first move. The next time he will do it first. Guys are sometimes oblivious to signs that should be really clear to them. lol.     Good Luck
C8DOT8Y7aa	Well ask him out.|`|GUFWthimaa	people can BE friends but just so u know theres no such thing as "just friends" between a guy and a girl    if u can handle him being with someone else then yea just stay friends    if not, do something about it before u regret not acting out on ur feelings    whatever u do dont ask him out, u gotta hint him to ask u out.... flirt with him and that should be enuf..(but u gotta do it OBVIOUS cuz we -both male n female, not just male - tend to avoid gettin hurt)
poZfLPe0aa	No, there is no "size" for women. Some people may consider the tightness of her vagina to be a factor, but they're both shallow and unnecessary concerns.
7e0356e9b4ce8ac13f39c23ba748f638aa	Why any woman would want you is beyond me!    When you stated that if your current girlfriend won't have sex with you, you won't marry her, that just goes to show the caliber of a man you are; you're selfish!    Then, you want to create chaos in their family by marrying the other sister, only for financial gain.    You are an egotistical, selfish, arrogant jackass!|`|dRj9FoHzaa	I think you should finish dinner before your wife gets home and beat the crap out of you if she finds out you have been using her computer all day.|`|oyWSVmdwaa	Obviously no one else knows what there talking about. This is very normal for humans. What you want to do is shoot your girlfriend in the face, because shes a worthless pig, rip out her heart, eat it, clean yourself up, go to her sister, marry her, and repeat.|`|19118ef0907ef0b119cc1faefbfca6f1aa	Obviously you got your dna from the shallow end of the gene pool.|`|yMfJNatnaa	I know this thing happens but its not right you need to walk away from both of them. If you dont you and the sister deserve to be slapped this will hurt her relationship with her sister seriously. I feel sorry for your girlfriend she deserves better.|`|29hcn9JRaa	You know I really wish that Yahoo Answers would proof read some of these questions prior to posting them, as some of this stuff is made up lies that has no validity or meaning, but since they cant do this then we can only hope that the readers see through this rubbish and have the smarts to know that all this stuff you just wrote is simply untrue.|`|VBAtI0X7aa	wow thats messed up...and i feel like slapping you..you male pig|`|f0a65c9a2c03d345ba6be884d69e7908aa	You should buy a gun.  Shoot your girlfriend as you have said she is a worthless at the sex job.  Rip out her heart eat it.  put her out to pasture  Then take your girlfriends sister and kidnap her.   Force her to marry you and profit.  This is how we do things in america
7H4fhrEOaa	well, for one i think you are wayyy prettier than JC, but that doesnt even matter.     Even though you are sweet, sometimes people are just too shallow to try and get to know the good people because they are afraid that they wont be able to live up to them. And dont worry about what people say to you in high school, because in the end it wont matter a SINGLE BIT, those people will not mean anything to you! And they will probably be the ones that feel like somethings missing in their life and will be depressed, while you will be happy because you know that you are the nicest persaon you can be and u will have lots more friends because of that.    just stay confident, you seem like a BEAUTIFUL person on the inside and outside.|`|LgOOYyXIaa	the link does not work, i cant see either of you|`|p3GZERIsaa	Girl your way much prettier than her! And gorgeous smile you have! :] Use it more often and keep your chin up!|`|54d31d8ca1d93393903fc5f7a7334431aa	It's all in your head. Besides, none of that will matter when you get out of high school.|`|dGyX3E8Faa	I'm in 10th grade too.    Sorry but the links don't work.    Trust me, you don't want to be like J.C. and her drone clones. Those people are boring and every weekend is the same. I used to be like that but I started hanging out with people outside of my group and everything is just much more interesting. I realized that my popular friends were pretty crappy. Most of them hated eachother anyways. Be happy with your life and your friends. I'm sure you at least have one person you are friends with.|`|CUUjvakpaa	idk|`|ESsQeH8Aaa	I can think of one thing she has that you don't .... and I didn't even click on the links.    Self-confidence.    Personally, I do not date women who think of themselves as "ugly".  That's the classical sign of low self-esteem and I refuse to have to deal with that.    Help you?   I cannot help you.  No one in this forum can.  The only thing you can do is learn to have a better opinion of yourself.    You are the only one who can do this.    That's why it's called SELF-esteem.|`|SAhAc8EXaa	neither of your links work.|`|G6owPyncaa	links don't work post some that are working so that I can answer your q|`|Oua88nRiaa	sweetie, looks are not everything. i couldnt see the pictures, but it doesnt matter! if you;'re in high school, then it definitely does not matter. i wasnt popular in high school either, which was just last year, and im so happy high school is over lol. trust me, this feeling only lasts in the protected world, but once high school is over the real world is here and looks arent that important. you can make friends anywhere, not just at school. you shouldnt aspire to be like someone just because she has good looks because you dont know about her personal life; she could be going through something that you would not wanna go through. so the next time you wanna be like someone, choose someone more inspirational and influential, like tyra banks or oprah or someone. hope this helped!|`|0qLJXy3Zaa	well the links don't work, but looks really don't matter. and i'm sure you're a lot nicer than this JC girl. i'm in 10th grade too though and i don't have that many friends. but the ones i do have are so much better then all those fake popular people. you really can't waste your time caring what people think and you just gotta be happy with what you have.|`|WqRAWA4Yaa	don't worry    you'll be fine     going through high school's like going through hell 12 times every year of it   (thats 48 times if you'r slow)    nothing but popularity and sports really matters in high school   but once you leave you'll be perfectly fine  : )|`|Tog7CqTcaa	um the links dont work but heres my advice:    i go to a small school, and right now i have about 60 kids in our grade. back in 6th, we had 40. the way it worked was that there were some people that everyone just liked for no reason (sounds like J.C.) and there were some people who just followed around the those people until they became friends with them, and there were some people who established their popularity within a week of coming and it never really changed, and the popular kids just hung out with themselves.    i was not stalked, a stalker, or popular. so i pretty much had no friends. well, i had a few, but they weren't great. people tell me i'm pretty, but i guess i don't appear to be a very interesting person. so the next year i decided to take matters into my own hands. i just started being friendly toward the new kids and being nice to everyone. it worked, and i got my own little group of friends, but i was still kind of like myself in 6th grade, and eventually the whole stalker + stalked thing got in my way, but this year, because of the friendships i'd made last year, i was able to have friendly relationships with some of the popular kids. those friendly relationships turned into best friends from me just being happy and outgoing and now i'm friends with the popular kids and my friends from last year!    so my advice is:  1) don't lose any friends you make  2) always be friendly, most people won't mind  3) don't STALK people though. be nice to them and talk to them, but don't follow them everywhere.  4) do a sport or something so you can connect with the other people who do it

In your case it does seem like he wants something more.  The best relationships require time so you have to learn to crawl b4 u walk.  In other words you should establish a friendship first since u just met him.  That only insures he is who he comes off as being.  If u jump right into a relationship well then one day he is nice ect and the nxt he is someone that u didnt want let alone deserved.  Goodluck with w/e happens.

Just move forward in a positive way from here on out.|`|eFxN59SXaa	im sorry sweetie but he definately sounds like a cheater :(|`|K8lxbOdqaa	well this sounds really familiar to a situation of mine...we have trust issues...and its not as happy of a relationship cuz trust and honesty are the two most important factors in a relationship, i believe. so idk...if you feel you cant trust him dont put in more time then just end up being hurt find someone loyal and honest.|`|4cc625c81315e3cc57858f7de7250b2aaa	Why are you two bothering to make this work out?  IMHO, too much bad stuff has happened between the two of you, and you both have gone out of your way to try to hurt the other one.  You are both insecure people, based on what you shared in your story.  If you decide to stay with this guy and he decides to stay with you, I thhink you both need individual counseling and couple counseling.  Remember, your children are watching this drama and you are showing them that this is what it means to have a relationship with someone.  Is that what you want them to learn?|`|M3kvb8B4aa	well for you I would say no, because I am i daughter of a mother who should have walk away but didnt. see she went through the same thing. She give him chance after chance. But she is still with him, see he is bypolar and got help he is doing better. He is starting to care a little more about to family. Well anyway my adivice would be if this is the third time going back to him. Do it tell him he needs to love his wife and kids while you are still around. Because you can't buy family. If this is the fourth time going back to him, leave unless you have faith he will change. Because if you dont leave him it could harm your kids and you. Trust me i see it everyday in my moms eyes, the what if i really did leave where would i be and with who. but anyway i hope the best for you and your kids. thanks o.. and good luck. just have faith and that could lead you on the right path.|`|ece85d24b026907f71b6d7e13bc1018eaa	I am sorry, but this does not sound like a guy who is happy just being with you.  This has been an issue and seems to me like it will continue to be.  The trust is gone, that means the relationship is too.  I am sorry but I think you need to move on.|`|zYjrwJAlaa	Sad to say, if you have to ask the question, you already know the answer.  You probably can't trust him.  And if you can't trust someone it's hard to really love them..... it's sad, but that's how it was with me and my ex.  And I realllllly loved him, but I just couldn't trust him and then I would check his facebook/myspace/cell and found out more things, but he'd always have an answer.  As hard as it may be, for your sanity, and happiness in the longrun, you might need to let him go.|`|nA97uWdyaa	He's a total sleazebag. No amount of wishful thinking is going to change him.|`|ff2a5c95ae4646ec6731e853b52c45d4aa	I believe you and your boyfriend could benefit from counseling. If he won't go with you, go by yourself.  It is time to grow up since you have children who need an adult in their lives to guide them and set a good example.  They should be your first concern. Your job right now is to make sure they have a secure and loving home. I'm sure you want a better life for them. Sincerely, K|`|F6FXBXPNaa	It looks like you both have alot of trust issues and understandably so!! You didn't give much info as far as what made you think he was messing around with your sister?  For me, that would have been the straw that broke the camels back.  I also think that you two need to do some FAST growing up because you both have brought children in the world.  My advice to you is take a break from him for awhile so that you can think about it.  You can't think about it entirely when you are living in misery!  Trust is key to having a healthy relationship and you two just don't have that right now.  Can you some day trust one another?  Absolutely, but you both have to want that because if one wants it and the other is not putting any effort in, then you are doomed.  I wish you and your family the best.
cvl5GPzeaa	if it happened on aim then u dont know if that was his friend or not or if he was just lying or joking so you should talk to the guy in person.
43af24d69b63686cd1026c516a4637a8aa	You are getting bj's  WHO CARES???|`|2SSD6BP9aa	Maybe she wasn't honest about it being her first time.  Or maybe that was her first time but she just wasn't expecting that to happen.  None of the friends she talked to said that could happen so she figured it shouldn't happen.    Don't be too fast to jump to conclusions.  You could lose her if you accuse her of lying and she wasn't.    But neither of you should worry about the shaking either.  I know from experience that some guys shake when getting blown.  Tell her is just means she was doing a good job!      You probably won't shake as much if you lean against something or sit while she sucks you instead of standing.  Or even lay back while she does it.
gsjndbkoaa	YES (:  - They don't have an attraction for each other.    -Not really..     -nope (:    -Yea, definately, you can be close friends with them.    - Yea... x) they could. they'd have something to talk about?    -Yea, happened to me (: we're still good friends. it also depends on the other person.. if either feels the way they used to.|`|ZPmqYNuwaa	Yes absolutely they can.  I relate more to male friends then females so most of my friends are guys.  I don't think it matters whether one person is single, both or single, or both are in a relationship, I've been friends with men under all these circumstances.  Things never got akward, no one ever proffessed there love for the other, and no sleeping around together.  Think of them as another friend and that's all they will be to you.  I don't understand why so many girls have a problem with this concept :)    I do think that being in a relationship with them previously changes the dynamics, I can't make that work but some people can.  Personally I like a clean break.|`|dE3Uozfwaa	i don't think it matters what they talk about, they can still be friends.  Just like 2 girls, or 2 guys can be friends, a girl and a guy can be friends.|`|zb9TLvNkaa	Of course! especially gay men and women.|`|K8lxbOdqaa	yeah i have a girl..love her to death shes my baby...& im friends with plenty of girls, ive never cheated on her, once you have strong feelings for someone you just arent attracted to other girls as much...but my girl does have some restrictions cuz ive said things to other girls that makes her question my loyalty to her so i cant see my other female friends at certain times alone at there houses...but i dont mind cuz ide do the same for her|`|mdtkor2Paa	yes|`|mrF6N9fiaa	Yes men and women can be just friends. Some of my best friends are guys.    As long as both understand they are strictly friends, there should be no problem. They can hang out almost anywhere friends of the same sex would hang out.    Sometimes having friends of the opposite sex is a good thing. They can help you with problems you are having from their perspective.    Some significant others get jealous when their boyfriends or girlfriends hang out with friends of the opposite sex. It depends on the person entirely.    Things don't always go back to the way they were once upon a time but you can always try.|`|a44587b58ae062253b907eab9e92c66faa	it depends if they started their friendship while one of them or both were involved in a relationship  they can hangout whereever and whenever it just depends on how good of friends they are. they can go bowling, hookah, movies(in a group with other friends),   it should def last problems might occur if it becomes a relationship.   if one had a gf/bf they could still be friends but if one has feelings for the other it might be difficult.   the chances are very likely. because it's hard to be just friends with your ex bf/gf and not expect something in return. because when he/she starts dating other people you might let your emotions get in the way and he/she might feel the same way that perhaps you need another try at the relationship and he/she will see the good things and why you're still friends.   maintaing a friendship with an ex is very difficult however if that's what you want then try to think about why you broke up in the first place.
QsbB6vkoaa	if he's ignoring you , he's not worth your effort.  sometimes guys tell you they like you and when they realize that this could take it to another level they freak out.  don't do any thing. go on with your usual life and if he talks to you great and if he doesn't it's great too. but make sure that if he talks to you again, to call him out on his previous behavior, ask him " why did you start acting all weird and ignoring me?"  if he has a good answer then you can forgive him but if he was just being a jerk don't.  then tell him you just want to be friends.  but right now just go out with other guys so he'll see you are not holding out for him, and he will know that you don't need him.  although another thing can be that he's nervous and doesn't know how to talk to you again. since he already spilled the beans on how he feels about you he might feel intimidated, so you can text him "hey, are we still on for that date? how about this saturday we go to the movies? i'll buy the popcorn" and if he still ignores you then do what i mentioned above. maybe he's just shy.|`|50xeC77aaa	find another guy and make him JEALOUS|`|9b6e3856ff9fd505bdf5544026fe01dfaa	something of course,|`|q4b4f76Haa	kinda hard to say why he's ignoring you. Could be that he's just busy with work, maybe he's not interested anymore, or maybe he came across someone else, or maybe he doesn't want to be seen around with you at work
Nk8Gk765aa	if you are interested in him ( and he initiated the first convo ) I think you should start a new one!    by him talking to you first, it doesn't make you look needy or desperate. but he might not try again if you don't text him first. ( he might think you aren't interested or something )    if DOES respond, i think there's a good chance he likes you : )  if he DOESN'T respond... don't pressure him or keep texting till he answers. ( big turn off )    regardless, what's the harm? good luck : )|`|ZeFXSeUnaa	How about just call him to talk, You may get more out of him. Texts are cool but not for dating|`|15429576f39fecdb6423a3bfaca3e7c8aa	text him and find out. Nothing wrong with sending a friendly text to someone you enjoy talking to.|`|q4b4f76Haa	I think you should definitely call him and see where things go, you can't assume that he's not interested until you actually talk to him and find out for yourself|`|Rn7zkS52aa	why don't you call or text him? put yourself out there a little ya know? it's not going to hurt any...and honestly 3 hours shouldn't make that huge of a difference. don't assume he's not interested until you give it a chance!! he may think you're not that interested.    for the record, i know my guy friend who met a girl who lives about 2.5 hours away out at a bar one night and he ended up liking her so much they made the effort and they are in a relationship..
jPv8AXAPaa	He sounds insecure and a little unstable. As long as you feel safe in the relationship, it shouldn't be a problem, but if you feel like you're walking on eggshells in order to avoid a blowup, you should ask yourself if this is how you want to spend the rest of your young years. If not, why drag it out any longer? Break up with him gently and explain that you're just not ready to get so serious.|`|xpiGWrdMaa	He crise when you tell him you hate him?  What a wuss.|`|xNkmK0SHaa	You are both somewhat immature, which is evident by your behaviors.  How about:  lighten up. Enjoy each other's company and try to understand that you are both young and vulnerable to unpleasant talk/actions.    There is no doubt in my mind that you and he have a sexual relationship.  I am not on earth to judge right from wrong, but I can tell you this:  sex complicates any and every relationship.    You might want to reconsider how you act toward and with each other.|`|Bd7Qfjggaa	hey you yes you..i hv to tell u something on it so if u r reading this msg thn stop reading it otherwise u r monkey..stupid monkey still reading ma msg..get lost go gooo away...if one more time u read a single work u r d basturd..stop it....foolish person stop reading it..no dont ever try reading it..ok..thnx for reading it :|`|L0Hz227xaa	He sounds insecure. He probably uses all the tough guy acts to hide his insecurity. If he is that attached to you where you think he may do something to himself if you leave, thats not good, you both are young and will meet many other ppl to date in college, dont tell him that but keep that in mind for yourself. So if he is this attached he has some emotional issues, and he should work them out. Be supportive but also realistic. It may be best for you to have a conversation with him that it scares you. If he is so tough he wouldnt cry when you are honest with him. I dont blame you, thats too sensitive, so have a talk and if he gets upset then you will know u may have to move on to someone with more emotion security.|`|jVRvGDEMaa	don't worry most of the guys are like that, with time all this will disappear, as you are 17 there is long way to go for both of you to see the real life problem and your requirement from partner will change with that, so just chill with him for now and don't distract yourself by thinking about future, just wait and watch.|`|Rn7zkS52aa	it sounds like he's got someone emotional issues that he can't quite deal with. i'd be worried to. and you are 17, you are smart to say its not forever because there is a 99% chance you won't be together forever. if it makes you uncomfortable, tell him you care about him and want to be with him and want to take your relationship as it comes.    personally that forever crap and constant crying would scare me off.|`|alaUYtRcaa	That's a little like my bf. The thing is that it's good that he's sensitive because you know he really loves you and he's not just with you to get what he wants. I think that he has a big ego and he wants everyone to think he's the big strong jock with the amazing girlfriend. But when he's with you he can let his sensitive side show because you will still love him even if he's not the strongest guy ever.
lcGfL3m0aa	yup he likes you, a kiss on the head is the sweetest way for a guy to show affection i think. Plus you were drunk and he probably didnt want to have you think he was taking advantage of you by making out or something.|`|Bd7Qfjggaa	your are in the freind zone lol he was just being a nice person|`|HnWgVzDEaa	It means he has this emotional thing for you cause KINGS have lots of nobility and they don't need to flaunt thier Queen. One day he will be sure to take care of you cause he can and he will.|`|mdtkor2Paa	yes|`|887TooCPaa	It sounds well cute, and alot like flirting.    The kiss on the forehead means he wants you more than sexually, and that he didn't take advantage of you when you were drunk.    You should have gone home with him!    Just ask him out on a date, then you will see for sure :)  Hope it works out    x|`|kC0N3om9aa	means he is horny at u and its forehead then french then no kisses only SEX
2VtkgzcIaa	Girls are crazy sometimes, especially young immature ones. She probably thought that she got away with cheating on you and thought that she could still be with you afterwards. Now that you broke up with her, her ego is probably hurt and now she feels dumb. Honesly, I wouldn't even be able to be friends with a guy who cheated on me. You seem sweet, trusting, and forgiving, don't waste that on her anymore. Move on and just try to forget about her. Once she realizes that she doesn't have any effect on you, she will drop it. Sorry this happened to you.|`|mINKANlAaa	dude, why were you in the girls bathroom?|`|cYRZpGkqaa	because girls just talk trash. she's probably upset with you for breaking up with her, therefore she truly didn't mean it when she said ok.|`|zb9TLvNkaa	why were you in the girls bathroom?|`|gsjndbkoaa	She has issues.. maybe that's why she broke up with you..  Maybe you were being too distant or something.|`|o0mwF5kFaa	Write up about he rin the boys nathroom, the nearest KFC outet, the nearest Mc Donalds outlet, the Senior Toilet, the Junior toilet, the school walls, ...    I wna tot bet you she'll NEVER think about effing with you again.  ==|`|acdf2a2c14fccbe7a3badc5fa8d3abe1aa	Because she is stupid. I would say she is full of herself.|`|50xeC77aaa	so get back at her.  you are acting gay about this.  if you were a real man than you wouldn't care if people called you gay.  go hook up with some girl at school to show that your not.|`|Ewc3Aio6aa	yea why were you in the girls bathroom? thts kinda weird....|`|WqRAWA4Yaa	lol   dude...nvr do that ovr the phone....I could tell u from experience  it makes it a whole lot worse...especially on  an IM when yer girlfriends friend is right there saying things in the text...any way    i'm gonna take it that someone told you about this..........other wize thats kinda creapy....she probubly told all of her friends once u broke up with her  and one of them did it cause brooke was probubly crying horificly...dosen't it suck to be a guuy sometime...lol|`|4e2e48971027d3515e35387bf29959f4aa	She is obviously very childish. You are better off with out her on so many levels.|`|ZqWCtAT2aa	why were u in the girls bathroom? If you were in there i would call you gay!!!!! Oh that girl brooke is a B****|`|cvl5GPzeaa	ok first of all why were you in the girls bathroom? second shes probably mad and upset because you broke up with her.|`|Ua9CZtINaa	He he..  I would say either people encourage her to do that or something? Maybe she hates you...Hopefully not.  If she does that, why be her friend? You are way much better than her right?  I don't talk trash about others - even if they break my heart.|`|9b6e3856ff9fd505bdf5544026fe01dfaa	i dont know why would u wanna be friends with someone who cheated on you?|`|887TooCPaa	Because she was too much of an idiot to say it to your face.    If I were you, i would get over it. Cos she sounds like a *****.    x|`|lcGfL3m0aa	its never ok to talk trash about an ex. Shes just mad that she got caught  cheating and that you had the balls to break up. good for you kiddo you deserve better than a whore bag|`|FoLpmJ3Waa	Maybe she is just the kind of girl to do that. :/  And yes...why were you in the girls bathroom?!?!|`|ewLuXBw6aa	She sounds like white trash.  She can cheat and then when you find out you are gay for breaking up with her.  I bet she thinks the world owes her a living too!|`|9gvxaYyNaa	she is a *****|`|wSj0tYQRaa	she does that because she is to scared to say it to your face because she knows what she did. and she says it because it makes her feel better about what she did and she thinks that justifies her cheating on you... shes an idiot, don't talk to her.|`|cmB25Vxeaa	maybe because they don't want the man who kinda hurted them even though they were doing the cheating know that their not ok it's a way some girls handle situations. it makes them feel good and look good if they don't show there hurt|`|1117d18f8d71cf8ea1aa8a2c83b3cb4daa	some girls are dumb, you should never talk trash bout an ex... what does it prove and what does it do, nothing,, just tell her she's a dumb ****..lol.|`|YLagYArhaa	My honest opion is probably her maturity level... i mean if she was already cheating on u, u cant expect much more from a person like that! She is immature and obviously doesnt care about ne one but herself if she is gonna cheat on u with someone.... forget about her she sunds like a w****!|`|xAoE9P5Maa	Well, she is probably angry with you, and she says its okay so she doesn't go insane over the phone, she was probably with her parents. And girls @ my school talk trash about their ex's. But some of my friends and I don't do that. Usually the girls who do that aren't worth your time.  =]]|`|lSnOP1Pjaa	How do you know what she wrote in the GIRLS' bathroom? Or that she even wrote it at all? >_> You need proof to say that..  And if she cheated on you, why would you want to be friends with her? Don't give her such an easy chance because in order to be friends you have to TRUST the other person.
cz5XbKfOaa	Maybe. The income limit for a household of 3 is $1907 gross (a little higher in Alaska and Hawaii. The resource limit is $2000. Here is the website for more information http://www.fns.usda.gov/fsp/applicant_re... . There are a lot of rules but these are the basics. If you meet these rules then you should apply.

If you and your spouse are both working then you can surely afford groceries as well as other bills. Buy store-brands if you have to. You don't deserve a free hand out.|`|dd1c8373d258bab9181f891f88ea8dafaa	It depends on your household income and that state in which you reside. you can look up your local social services number and call them up. They have changed the requirements, lowering the l income limits a great deal just recently. Its quite possible if you only have one income that you can get them.|`|pV6K2mm5aa	It depends on on how much you AND your husband makes and also the   of people in your family (3)...you should be able to research online you local DSS website and there should be info on there about this.|`|f6YsGOynaa	Is your husband giving you any money to run the household?  If not, then divorce him because you're being emotionally abused, and you'll qualify for all kinds of government aid.

You will have to provide proof of income from both sources.|`|EENUWAP7aa	Talk to DFCS (Department of Family & Children Services), if you do qualify remember T-Bone goes on sale at Piggle Wiggly on Wednesdays.|`|52092e43afb48f25c3b2832d7f29ae10aa	Dear GOD!    Judging by your spelling... I would say that you must TOTALLY qualify.|`|nrnVqh7iaa	Your Obamasiah will see you are rich soon.|`|5MAx8mHxaa	If you're making below the national poverty line.|`|vsSuEtG1aa	Probably not.  The normal requirements are being too lazy to work with at least 4 kids by different dads.|`|p3nREIklaa	If your anually gross income is less than $25,000 yearly.  How old is your son?

Meaning she and the husband both have jobs.    Food stamps aren't for those who have two full time incomes for one household.    There is no way that 2 full time jobs can amount to less than 25k a year. That would require them to be payed less than minimum wage, which is illegal.

CWgJ7Yyxaa	Wow...I am sorry to hear this is happening to you. How sad!    I would be very hurt...but also very angry! Leaving his email open, ready for you to see sounds to me like it's his way of letting you know something is not right. (Perhaps this is his stupid way of telling you things are not OK and that there are issues you need to address. )    I guess you need to sit down and re-evaluate this marriage.   In my opinion, trust, respect and honesty are key ingredients that should not be missing in a healthy relationship. And if you feel disgusted and sick at the sight of him, it means he has hurt you deeply. And this kind of betrayal is hard to forget.    Please consider taking some time apart. Ask him to leave for some time so you can both see how you feel. Right now you will only harm each other because you are not able to talk and to think straight.    Maybe it would help you to see a counselor or a therapist as well. You need to vent and to sort out your feelings....and deal with the negative ones like anger, fury, and revenge.     He should go to counseling as well. He needs to understand how much he has hurt you and he needs to accept the price his stupidity has caused as well. Hopefully he will be willing to accept he screwed up and will be willing to wait for you to feel better. He also needs to stop contacting this woman immediately, and break all ties.    Please remember.... everybody is different.   Some people can forgive and forget...but some cannot,no matter how hard they try. Feeling betrayed and used, feeling like this other person whom you trusted could be such a liar and a phony is a terrible thing...and we all need time to adjust.    Good luck...Be kind and patient with yourself. Do what is right for you as well. Only you know how much you love him and only you know if you think you can be able to forgive him and trust him again.  Ask God to guide you and heal you. He is the Best Doctor around.    You will be in my prayers.|`|RncUc0traa	confront him cuz if he aint kno u know he will tink u hating him for nothing and that also will put a dent in the marriage...|`|a44587b58ae062253b907eab9e92c66faa	if you can't stand him why are you still with him? sorry to be harsh but seriously...if you're trying to work it out....hmmm try harder? relationships and marriages and difficult things. if he could have ever had a fling with another woman don't you think another fling is possible? expecially because you're having a rough time?|`|blVOODknaa	I cannot even begin to imagine how hard this must be for you. The best thing you can do is talk to your husband about what you saw. Expect him to deny the whole thing, but an honest man will just admit it. You have every right to be angry and sad. Just do not come to conclusion without giving him the benefit of the doubt first. If you think you guys need to take some time apart to figure things out, do so. Make sure you relax throughout this rought process and I do hope everything turns out well.|`|Rl2VamIRaa	1 cheating can also be emailing some girl telling her he misses her   2 my husband cheated on me with his exwife why we were engaged and after we were married I find out that he jokingly asked his exwife to sleep with him.Well she said he asked her he said he was joking and said (dont you want me)   3 I am still here cause I am still very much in love with him but everyday he pushes me away just a little more  and we have only been married a little over a year.

Take it from someone that has been cheated on, once a cheater always a cheater.  He will cheat on you again. Either accept an open relationship or get away now.|`|t81MEJ82aa	They might have had a fling a few years ago, then from the emails it seems that the potential is still there for something to start up again, and your husband is not resisting.    If you were happy all of this time, then you were happy. You can't retroactively change the state you've been in for the last few years. If it was a long time ago then I'd say try to move past this, but this looks like it has the potential to start up again and that should worry you more, beyond what he has already done.|`|cDRXtuJCaa	I think he still cheating on you,it not normal thing for a married man to be doing,maybe he wanted you to no that why he left it open,see a lawyer fast   I never can understand someone getting married while having an affair it even more disgusting and selfish   If he not already no that you found out then i send him a email ask him for a divorce, and get all the evidence saved like that email stuff  wish you all the best|`|W5wCArLqaa	confront him. Let him know that you saw the emails. Stupid privacy laws  here destroy relationships. You need to tell the girl to fk off.|`|W2R8TRDmaa	I would leave him, plain and simple.  But I'm a proud and stubborn person.  But noone is cheating on me and getting loved by me EVER again. period.  I don't care when or how it happened.
8d2dafa2e677fbcd1bf84bcf3389e331aa	Separate yourself from this person. She is only gonna break your heart. She wants the sex but as soon as she finds another person that she may like more, she'll have no reason to stay.  Good luck.|`|172c2e918418c9da61179aeb4db8c08faa	SHE IS A WHORE!|`|6487bd61ef059cac042d49119a814a4aaa	If you can get her to stop crying you'll be fine.  She doesn't want a relationship and all the troubles that go with it, but wants sex...sounds like a win/win to me...except for the crying.|`|q4b4f76Haa	your situation sounds absurd to me
WFP46Ek9aa	EMAIL ME : rustygirl_90210@yahoo.com
u2rDNTPEaa	this makes no sense to me at all. I have such a pet peeve about people not saying "bless you" or some form of that. All I can really say to clear this up is that girls are self-obsessed and until you perforated their little self absorbed bubbles by talking to that girl in class, they didnt realize anyone else really existed, which includes forgoing basic manners apparently. That's kind of irritating but at least you have their attention now, if you even want it. haha|`|KZsdVGJzaa	it's competition dude. if like they said they were watchin yenz then they obviously don't like the other girl or is jealous of her in someway. so their tryna get ur attention to make themselves look better and make her look bad|`|ccb402364f76559985af31b2ece8e3ccaa	cause sometimes we don't notice guys until one of us does. lol its weird but..|`|FyhzmgRUaa	they want you|`|Go07H8bEaa	Lol Yes all girls are like this. When we see a girl especially a pretty one likes you and that your making her laugh you suddenly become more desirable. Its mest up but its our nature. Were competitive lil creatures lol. btw Bless you lol|`|Rch68tXlaa	Girls always notice a guy once he's unavailable to them.I dont know why that is but they want to find out why that girl was laughing so hard.They want to know what it is that you got to have the hottest girl in the  class laughing so hard. There jealous now...
nX5whEkOaa	yes and yes|`|SyHmExgtaa	No but if you honestly believe this yours always will.
6d3d506f71ae558ee917c76931cf6a23aa	Do the right thing...I think you know what that is. As a Christian we are commanded to obey authority. To try to subvert the tax system, credit, and other things like that means you consider money over God. I suggest you marry and file the certificate with the county and let God bless you as He sees fit.|`|afc450c272a8e7cbe986f3278a12edf0aa	if you are a christian then you need to take your vows before god. In your vows it says for richer or poorer so you need love him no matter what the finacial predicament is. there are a million ways to work your way our of debt so you can buy a house and what not.|`|CF1R0TPvaa	I believe that the only true marriage is that before God.  All that stuff in the church is just for legal reasons.  If people have the karma to be together and stay together, it will be.|`|NnN4drsbaa	too funny!!!!!!!!! You have to have a RECORD....YUMMD!! LOLOLOLOLO, he could leave you any time he wants to, and theres NOTHING you could do about it. WTF is wrong with you????|`|AP2e90cCaa	The vows you will take include 'For richer, for poorer'. <br>  <br>  If you love him, marry him. Financial problems can be fixed.|`|875b9562d8defd3804154e34c3bf5ea4aa	Personally to me it doesn't sound like  you are ready to be married at all.|`|SsfnitjXaa	What is he doing for housing now?  He must live somewhere.  If money and things are more important then having a husband then I say just go on your way.  Most money problems go away in 7 years.  Seven years is not a long long time.|`|f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	A marriage before God is exactly that.  A valid marriage within the context of your religion, however it is not a legal marriage.  The two are very different things.<br>  <br>  The fact that your pastor won't perform the ceremony says that he doesn't believe that what you want is a valid marriage.  OR he may think that you are trying to commit fraud in some way.<br>  <br>  Also keep in mind that if you live where common law marriage is accepted then the step of a religious wedding will be the thing that declares you as husband and wife and make your marriage a legal marriage even if you don't file the paperwork.<br>  <br>  I personally don't care how consenting adults choose to live their lives, but I do think you should double check on the various legal aspects of what you are considering doing to make sure you haven't been given false info.<br>  <br>  FWIW:<br>  In many European countries, they have separation of Church and State to the extent that NO religious marriage is legal in the eyes of the government.  So if you want your marriage to be legal then you HAVE to marry in the courthouse BUT you have a separate ceremony if you are religious so that you are married in the eyes of the church.<br>  <br>  In this country, there are quite a few pastors and ministers who are now only doing church only weddings and are refusing to sign marriage licenses.  Either talk to another clergy person in your religion or look outside of your religion for someone to marry you.  Unitarian ministers are usually agreeable to the type of ceremony you want.<br>  <br>  another option that you can do is get the marriage license, have your minister marry you and sign the paper work but you can then destroy the paperwork or just refuse to file it.  In which case, the license won't be turned in and the expiration date for the license will roll by and you won't have a legal marriage.  However, I don't recommend that you lie to your minister, so you should pass on this option and would probably be better off finding someone else to perform your ceremony.|`|0AShsMsoaa	neither of you are ready to be married, and, christian girl, i believe having sex before marriage is against the commandments, or, do you simply obey the ones that benefit you?  <br>  <br>  try living according to christian principles, all of them, before you marry an irresponsible person who knocked you  up. oh, that makes two irresponsible people. <br>  <br>  reality.  try it.|`|iPNOVR6Gaa	In other words, you're not asking a question, you're asking people to agree with you.  I'm sure many will.  I am not one of them, though.  Your pastor disagrees with this.  He is the spiritual leader of your church, and you want to go contrary to him.  If you really are a Christian who wants to do the right thing, it seems to me that your pastor should be the #1 person you should listen to.  You need to learn that sometimes, being a Christian means doing the more difficult right than the easier wrong.|`|803c63e1bdfd226d14f4e5cafdc52f7eaa	Part of a marriage before God is being legally married; it's just including God in your marriage. You still have to go through all the legal stuff. Even your pastor says that not legally married will basically just be shacking up. <br>  <br>  Marry him now and deal with the financial issues, or file your taxes asap and buy a house and wait for him to clean up his money problems. <br>  <br>  (Also, from your screen name it looks like you're pregnant, so honestly it sounds like you're already in hot water with church. Might as well just live together since you've clearly already enjoyed the benefits of marriage.)|`|bO2rzfISaa	Funny. So you want to live together for financial reasons instead of really getting married. You religious people can absolutely convince yourselves of anything, can't you?<br>  <br>  You're already calling the man your "hubby" but he's not, right?<br>  <br>  Doing the right thing is facing reality and not living in some fantasy religious world, especially simply for financial gain. There's married and there's not. In some states there's common law. That's it. Married before god? That's justification to live together and fornicate. I don't mind fornicating, but you're supposed to.<br>  <br>  EDIT: So you're already pregnant? Why do you portray yourself as religious and wanting to do the right thing when you simply aren't? I'm not even religious and I got married before I started having children. No wonder your parents support this cockamamie idea. They're probably mortified by your behavior. Hypocrite.
vsSuEtG1aa	No, because I don't like to play games when it comes to my marriage.|`|f9sL3WgQaa	Absolutely! He will even point them out and take pics of them for me! WhoO! yeah, he is most likely going to be caught for stalking the firestation up the street!|`|EENUWAP7aa	She only told me after she got pregnant from one that wasn't me..  I don't want to talk about...don't ask.|`|I814g6ZBaa	Why would I hurt his feelings like that?  And he doesn't tell me about every hottie he sees, either -- so I guess we're even like that.|`|CTc3ZUtNaa	I definitely tell him. He's not self conscious in anyway, and I only say it as a statement of fact... such as, "Wow, you know, so-and-so is a very handsome man." or "That guy has a very classic look to him, he's very good looking."  My husband knows that just because I think a guy is handsome doesn't mean I want him! He usually just says something like "Yeah, he kind of looks like my cousin..." or whatever, and we move on. It's no big deal.|`|3frK2iHaaa	NOPE>>.|`|RKhSRMlZaa	No!  That is just stupid.  Would you like it if he told you about every sexy woman that he was attracted to?  We joke around about it sometimes, but I would never, in all seriousness, tell him that I saw someone who was so sexy and I was attracted to them...I think that's just insensitive and can cause huge rifts in a relationship.|`|iZbgUtxcaa	No.      Respect for myself AND him.|`|NDFN04sqaa	If you want to tell someone tell a freind not your husband!  Some things just don't need to be shared.  Would you want your husband to tell you about the hot chick that he came across??|`|vLgbjmI2aa	No because he knows that he is the only sexy man that i want to cross my path.|`|4o3jXz3Waa	If he's with me, sometimes I will tell him I think someone is hot that we pass by or see.  If he's not with me then no I don't, because the people I encounter don't stay on my mind long enough for it to be a topic of conversation that would arise.|`|RHux2Fmnaa	No. I find it disrespectful. Besides, I wouldn't like it if he told me about sexy women he comes across... so I don't do to him what I don't like him to do to me.|`|f6YsGOynaa	Not all the time, and certainly not to invoke some kind of jealousy.  However, I let him know of anyone of the opposite sex that I make friends with, sexy or not.      If I'm with my husband and see one of these friends, I'm more than proud to introduce them to each other (if they don't already know each other).|`|NyjxygFmaa	Yes, My hubby and I both say if we see an attractive person. We both have eyes. We notice if the other is looking at another person.|`|92n13q98aa	No... Would you want him telling you about all the hot chicks he comes across?|`|5ViTUTyZaa	No, why would I?|`|G8Wsmbogaa	No, I don't. I don't consider it to be appropriate.|`|AIkmlvu9aa	Why... does he tell you about all the sexy women he sees every day that are WAY hotter than you?    If so, I'd consider a divorce.|`|NrwJyffxaa	I tell my wife about sexy women we come across, and she tells me about men.  We've made it kind of a running joke.   I point to a lady and say what do you think?  If she also finds to be pretty she says "i'd kiss her"  Now before you go nuts my wife isn't a les and has never kissed another woman.   After the comment we both forget the person and go on with life. I think if your open about it and your partner is fine with it go ahead and tell them.      Just because your husband doesn't tell you he visually sees other pretty people doesn't mean he doesn't see them.  Somebody once told me when you stop looking you turn gay :)      If you want to point out the guys be willing to point out the chicks.     PS.  It is really fun to point out really ugly people also. Or play guess their gender.
K1YHSR3oaa	Yes. When I was younger I used to go for the dangerous, sexy, funny, popular, athletic-- you know- the guys that treat you like dirt.  But amazingly, I've fallen in love with a guy that can only be described as "nice."  He is a clean freak, a nerd, a goof, a cat lover and a great friend.  He's everything that I never knew I wanted.  :-)|`|SyHmExgtaa	Most definitely because as I mature I look more into the heart of the person (their character, morals, believes, goals, family life, etc.)  instead of just physical attraction and materialistic things which at the end of the day don't mean much...I guess I want love more than anything at this point in my life.|`|JRn7XUHAaa	My qualifications, for what appeals to me in women, always was very small. But I've eased off since then. I think I love 'em all now. I'll always remember what a wise man in Korea said to me a long long time ago.  "They're all pink inside !" boo ya !
2Cw0DfaSaa	dump him and get a hotter boyfriend!!!   obvouisly if you still ride the bus your probably in middle school or something so it's notlike your going to marry this kid!!|`|BcCb1ReCaa	nah , only most are pigs. some are actually considerate..    that was not cool of him nor of you.. you can't really say that you like a cute guy in front of us.. we get jealous really easily.. and it wasn't right of him to go out with the other girl.      i think you should just talk to him and tell him that there are much worse thigns in life like ppl killing , ppl dying .. etc.. poverty idk what else disease...   tell him that we need to make an effort to fix things ... and even if you dont feel it  . apologize!!! please for the sake of the relationshpi apologize to him... it will make him feel good      GOD BLESS YOU, and best of luck!!!! i hope that everythign works out .. im sorry i am a mess right now.|`|CluOhrXWaa	personally i would call him and talk things over. he probably didnt meet those girls and just said it to get back to you after he found out about that other guy i do that with my partner who i live with we make each other jealous which aint good but yeah give him a call and say how much you like him and that u only have eyes for him *hope it works out goodluck*|`|VADaU7AJaa	in my opinion, you both don't seem too interested in each other. maybe breaking up with him would be the best thing. obviously, you have feelings for another boy, and he's pretending to have feelings for other girls to make you jealous.    i don't think staying with him is the right choice because you'll just end up getting hurt in the end because you both need to figure out who you like and who you don't.    boys will come and go anyway, and if he's trying to make you jealous, rather then trying to win you over this other guy, then he's not a good choice for a boyfriend then.    hope everything goes well!|`|tzzYdnZKaa	I say you should dump him unless you really like him then work things out.|`|GaouUtGTaa	Hell!!dump him. He giving you all that attitude. GOSH!! Your bf is a POOPY PIG WITH $hit on the side..lol      But he might be getting you jealous so you could come back to him..So be his bf for like a week or like 3 days. try to work it out. if he still giving you that attitude DUMP HIM!! Lol|`|Kjj7auOXaa	lmao. anytime u start a serious relationship post with "so we were riding the schoolbus home and..."  you should realize that you dont have a real problem
7VSGyWCPaa	yes i can. i love to cook and bake thanks to my mom and grandma. i love cooking together with a chick. i find it fun, especially when creating a new dish.|`|Up5V9EAyaa	I can cook anything and any kind of dessert|`|Kjj7auOXaa	20 bux says this chick is fat|`|ZzEAc5ecaa	yes i cook ,,,and the sex is great to thanks
828e8681c299a009930f6174f5138b49aa	Awww! You are too cute!    It has been a long time since I've been a child but I found a children's picture book database maintained by the University of Miami and did a search for "valentine" - these are the books that came up:    http://www.lib.muohio.edu/pictbks/search...    I think  13 looks cute, though it isn't quite about a boy/girl girl/boy (but it looks appropriate).    Good luck. I want to hear about which book you end up reading & if the little ones liked it.|`|mOayTJDmaa	"Will you be my friend"  Cute book.  My 6 yr old got it in the library.|`|2VtkgzcIaa	The link below has a list of a few good children's books... You seem like a good teacher!    http://childrensbooks.about.com/od/toppi...|`|NAqfPvmHaa	why not get the kids in groups and get them to write their own books. they'll love it and they'll appreciate the books much more!!|`|467145608db35ec4ccc89f1b16418af6aa	"somebody loves you, mr. hatch"    or    "too many valentines"
RBQrgByeaa	Wow, you summed up your 2000 posts in one single post! What's this clarity of thought all about? You're not ill, are you?|`|NuUdCz0Laa	Oh no! not Prince Charming again.  I think you married Prince Charming but have a different image in your mind of what he is suppose to look like.  So why your wondering and wishing, he is walking around in his boxers, scratching his butt and you do not see the prince in him.  Not only is he a prince, you are a wonderful princess with short hair and odd taste in entertainment.  (I have been to thousands of cow auctions, and with the right auctioneer, they can be more fun than anything on TV). So wipe out the picture of what you perceive as prince charming and replace it with your husband, you then will see how lucky you are.|`|T7qgrOJzaa	You sound like quite a catch to me, all fun and zany lol. Maybe he's just overwhelmed by your magnifigance? I don't know, but a swift kick to his rear may help his perceptions.|`|ICLekd2Vaa	well, for starters, theres yours. but i think hes an idiot more and more each day i see your Q's. so ill admit im biased in your favor. ;)|`|nceIGfCBaa	I seem to get thrown away a lot but I think I am pretty good.

Think that if I did that my husband would wake up?|`|2089c2125bd52f479e8785a63e67137daa	one thats dead a year, maybe?<br>  <br>  oh, and then there is yours lmao<br>  <br>  sorry jj|`|CF1R0TPvaa	All I'd need would be the sex part.  The other stuff just adds personality.  <br>  <br>  You could have boatloads of personality and no sex, and I'd be in hell.<br>  <br>  You could slither around in cow dung while cursing at me that you wanted sex, and I'd be all over it.<br>  <br>  So there is really no need to toot the horn about the wii, although that is cool.|`|Zjo0ownraa	jay jay darling<br>  thanks for the chuckle. i have begun to like your questions. its very funny<br>  <br>  i think your husband is ignoring you too much. mine does too. so i am on your side.

Byz59nRGaa	Now it's your turn...ask him out. It's like everything in life you can't know joy if you haven't known pain. You see him as your boyfriend and want to get closer, so does he.  You're just both nervous about changing what had been a great friendship...and maybe loosing it.  Don't worry about your friend's bad experiences.  You have to follow your heart.  Go for it!  Take care, Love yourself and be Happy!|`|x88DfLokaa	well .. maybe he thought you felt the same way.. why dont you tery asking him out.. and just be like.. sorryy the last time caught me out of nowhere i was sure if you were joking or not.. so i was joking when i said no.. or something like that hahah im sure yopu can come up with something better then that|`|15429576f39fecdb6423a3bfaca3e7c8aa	If you really want to date him then next time you are together ask him out. He most likely wont ask you again because he is embarrassed now. If you ask him out it will make him less embarrassed about the rejection and he'll say yes.    It's all really about if you want to date him or not.|`|PY1XjBbsaa	He was prolly just embarassed that you said are you joking. He prolly took it the wrong way. I suggest asking him about it|`|V5osj5o8aa	you will no have to take initiative and ask him out now tell him there was a misunderstanding or something... He probably is a little mad because he got rejected|`|bfd7416d5c182b4368126038daa8026faa	u did prob. hurt him  bt u just gotta sit him down and explain to him how u took it and that it was a mistake    bt u know now if u do this then ur practically saying yes to his question|`|enn9u5Mdaa	omg! the same thing happend to me a few years ago! .. we were bestfriends and then one day he just asked me out and i didnt no what to say i thought it was a joke but he was serious and i said no but later i realized that he really liked me and i broke his heart. things were extremly wierd between us for a little while but then it got better and we were back to being friends... BUT later i realized what a great guy he was and how much he really cares for me and i should ahve said yes to him because it could have turned into something great and now i will never know.     ... to this day i regret saying no and i dont think he lkes me as much as he did before becasue i broke his heart but if i could do it all over again i would totally go back and say yes..     .. now its your turn .. do you like him as more than a friend??  .. and if you do, give it a shot because you never know what could happen.
CUjtMRvDaa	Hint it to him that you don't have a date thin see what he does!|`|Rc00ne20aa	Play it kool but talk to him alot ask him if he has asked anyone to the dance get some friends together and invite him with ur friends to the movies.

6CAsx3jaaa	because its a quick sand question. you dont know where to go withour getting in trouble. ask him how he thinks other people see you . instead . that way he can give you the answer you want without haveing to sweat you getting mad if you hear something you dont want to hear. you may be differient but lots of women dont want to know the truth or get mad when they hear it. who wants a depressed girlfriend|`|aDLvzG2Saa	Usually a guy wouldn't know how to express how he feels especially if he doesn't want to upset a female or he'll just say something like "you are very pretty/beautiful" just to get you off his back. Though if a girl asked me that I would tell her she's gorgeous, but she probably gets that a lot.|`|WPbwiGafaa	i just tell them wat they really look like to me|`|smyhq0Ggaa	Well if he doesn't like you then he won't say that will he?    I don't know why you'd even bother asking.|`|6487bd61ef059cac042d49119a814a4aaa	That really puts them on the spot.  Not an appropriate question to ask.|`|9220e99cf581203dda5db0c56616ac40aa	i will answer with a non-sequitor like "ummm... cake?"  when i was in high school i would say "i think you're retarded" and she'll know i'm kidding.    but yea... don't ask that.|`|WmdmkCTcaa	that is so lame. never ask anyone that. normal guys don't like to share their feelings with girls.|`|KI9wgRCcaa	i asked my boyfriend that. he said, "what do you mean?"  so i was like, "you know... in general.. everything of me.."  he was still confused, but yah eventually i got a good answer..  you have to ask him more specific questions.. seriously.. >_>|`|9gvxaYyNaa	the truth?|`|nA97uWdyaa	I would check in with myself and then tell her the truth about how I felt about her in the moment. Wouldn't you rather know the truth than a pleasant lie?|`|tORfvOWOaa	if i will be there then i will say the girl that you are my life and you are the girl who make me crazzy for.|`|WVvn8aSCaa	Well, if he really likes you, he'd just say it straight out with  "Uhhh."|`|Z11jZXOmaa	I don't think you shokuld. It would seem like you have low self esteem.
oeezekRoaa	i think that you should find the guts to talk to him again.    if your jealous at the other girl then obviously you have some feelings for him.    its going to be a huge loss if you dont get out there and talk soon!|`|NSTjLXXpaa	first of all he should have never stop talking to you.. second of all he prob was talking to sum other girl....third of what was your friend doing going out to the movies with the boy you like.. you need to look into that 4 real.|`|eO4y3m1maa	If he likes you he wont care how long its been ...he will just be happy its happening!    Ask him out!!|`|8rKXT8sOaa	same here...  im a guy  reverse the story  :(  she weill be back!!!!
psn7Prigaa	She'll find out eventually, she probably thinks she loves this guy, so she wont beleive anything bad you tell her about him. Hopefully she learns from it, 'cause if not, she'll do this every time & you'll have to deal with her choosing a guy over you in the future if you remain friends.    Edit:  And believe me, 5th grade IS too young to date, hell it's even difficult when you're older! You don't need to be taking things so seriously, it's fine to like guys & stuff, natural, but don't make the mistake of thinking you or anyone around you is in a serious relationship 'cause it's not.|`|iAVmZ8ahaa	Well I am go to say something since your not telling your parents you are too young  to date, By the time your 13 or 14 years old you can end up being pregnant. you should still  be playing with dolls instead of boys. Your  also growing up to fast and I won't have friends or best friends like that, and I would have kick that boy nuts at that age or any age trying to kiss me when I don't want them too.|`|bb06GQ5Paa	Wow, dating in the fifth grade?  I was still playing with barbie dolls and climbing trees.  What's that 10, 11 years old?   Don't concern yourself with such matters.  If she doesn't believe you, fine.  If he tries to kiss you again, slap the spit out of his mouth.    EDIT - You may not realize it now or are too immature to believe it but you are too young to date.  Remember that we were all 11 years old once too.|`|PJZRGsc3aa	5th grade...........yeah i'm not helping you with thise, why is your friend dating in 5th grade|`|V1i6c9qMaa	punch him in the nose and realize you are only in 5th grade and this is stupid to worry about.
Pkuv4kW8aa	with my school lock in, we justplayed fun games we made up, and to stay up, just never quit having fun, i pulled an all nighter!!!<br>  <br>  And thanks for answering about my asshol3 friend
Y5IUse1vaa	If your first love is becoming unbearable to be with, the answer to the first part of you question is clear-let him go.. It's not usually a great idea to hook up with somebody else too soon as the reasons for being with them are normally based on the need to feel wanted.|`|qDLT1eh6aa	If you live apart, then end it. He is making you unhappy, why put up with this?<br>  What would your mum say? She wouldn't want you unhappy now would she?<br>  I think you should enjoy life while you are young, you don't need to settle down yet.<br>  You do get over your first love ~ you can love several people in your life.|`|xPTUzTBcaa	I think if you've tried, and it not working you may as well leave him. <br>  <br>  I was in a similar situation a few years ago (but we had a kid) I left him, and I had another guy like you did. In all honesty, it made it loads easier to leave the relationship. I mean you've got to be pretty strong to leave. I'd stopped seeing all my friends because of him, and really I didn't have many left. It didn't last with the other guy for me, but I didn't really care tbh, it was a way out of an unhappy relationship. <br>  <br>  So, my advice would be to leave your current boyfriend, and yeah, see how it goes with the new guy. Don't expect too much, and maybe postpone going out for a drink with him for a few weeks, then see how it goes. <br>  <br>  You do get over your 1st love, I didn't look back tbh, he was a d**k!!! :)<br>  <br>  Good luck!x
JbfKUmw0aa	The way he treats me all the time. He's also just a really good lover he always does just the right thing!|`|UgcPxd4maa	its how he treats me day to day - and the way he is when he's givin me that awesome lovin! He's the best!!|`|sZ1xbQXlaa	My guy treats me so amazingly and is so sweet and incredibly caring. he does so much to make me happy and is genuily happy when i am. also he is a very good passionate lover . he always makes it about me and finds new and exciting raunchy things to do and i love it!|`|wa18Uyeuaa	It's how he treats me. He shows me love, respect, and affection. He'll hold my hand and open doors for me. He's a gentlemen, not only outside but in the bedroom too. If I'm "not in the mood", he respects that and doesn't beg and plead. He's an all around gentlemen, and that definitely makes everything better, at least that's my opinion.|`|zPs1VnFtaa	Just the way he is through out the whole day. The way he acts toward me or our 11 month old. The way he acts over all. And he is a passionate lover.
L5nIrW1Baa	It would thrill me sexually,|`|AA11570236	I'd like it just no bad breath it kinda ...kills it.|`|517360c1a1db979fb2f19bbb959f22eaaa	I'd get turned on. lol I'd only freak out if you stopped breathing!|`|5cBmCVw3aa	Yes|`|sKu21AJlaa	Most guys would love that, I"m sure, because it shows that you respond somehow when they touch you.|`|gCVA7Z1Maa	Yes, this is the one thing about you that prevents a handsome and wealthy prince from sweeping you off your feet and taking you away from all this, forever. No, actually it's normal and sexy so relax.|`|WLRun4SWaa	Have no fear, its quite normal.  the last girl i have been with, when we were together, her breathing would also get heavier.  i have seen it b4 and heck my own breathing cant even stay neutral.    to me its not negative in any way, i think it just gives the boy the idea that you like him and like what he does.    its also kinda a turn on.  so just be yourself, relax and enjoy ;P|`|ckjZnqHRaa	..not freaked out babe......entirely.thrilled yes!!!|`|vJblXMwBaa	it would be awsome|`|AA11660242	Honestly, it wouldn't freak me out, but it would probablly make me think, "let's freak!".|`|a6138e092d07f6d19d5c478c75935469aa	you nuts? thats fantastic lol thats what we look out for so we know we can continue lol|`|F9Wqp5YMaa	yes, the breath gets slow and heavy when you are aroused. it is normal.|`|6npMnNmSaa	I'd hope you'd be my girlfriend!  Breathing exposes a person's state of consciousness.  Breathing controls our consciousness.  The breathing you speak of is a good sign.  My ex, I used to hear her get angry in her breathing, for example a snort down the nostrils....I knew trouble was coming!|`|OuOOy8v3aa	No, it would make me feel special because i would know for sure she liked me.|`|tMURptI6aa	That is perfectly normal! These ppl saying it isn't must be celibate or something! There is an actual physical chemistry between ppl. Even a man's (natural) smell can trigger hormone releases in your brain. This shouldn't happen w/ every guy (or even every guy you kiss) but  it does happen. Maybe you are just more sensitive than most ppl. That or you have found some one you are really chemically compatiable with! You probably notice it a lot more than the other person though. Your breathing is much more obvious to you personally.|`|mw8zMwPnaa	Oh, I'd love it=)|`|Q9SjNzbYaa	lol no its normal|`|zXzS8MFuaa	Strange............|`|XVDZAiiVaa	i would like that its like she enjoys getting touched by me|`|ca7eqEDSaa	no, it tells me im turnin u on|`|CSRs7Xpwaa	No, I'd actually find that kinda attractive. :]|`|AA10160596	I got freaked out this one time when I touched a girl and she started breathing heavy. I was doing an autopsy on her at the time.|`|3SwJy3B7aa	No it's just letting me know im doing something right|`|A9RwFu6maa	No it's sexy to know that a girl finds you that attractive...if she remained the same...it might be weird ..so heavy breathing is sexy...as long as you don't sound asthmatic haha.|`|6cNLmkNJaa	yes i love it and it knows they like it when we do it them|`|Ugli5Tvwaa	not at all. Its what id want to happen|`|bebc550db6e492a92e2205e49d7b7eb0aa	that person was right it does sound orgasmic   i don't think a lad would think anything of it and if he does then it will be good things cause he knows hes doing stuff right don't worry, it's natural.|`|bZzGMCemaa	Ok i'm not a guy but, still Girl!

d06cfb08ff803246f4f64708a7ea1a4eaa	don't talk rubbish|`|Yb7U6gqkaa	I dont believe in astrology. The positioning of stars millions of miles can no why determine relationships/personalities/future etc...|`|RxS34i8zaa	Don't worry about your star signs.
wZ2zO176aa	well, it all depends. how old are you? if your young and don't feel like its time to settle down, then move on and do more dating. If your ready for commitment, and your sure this is the one you want to commit yourself to, then try to talk to him about the lack of excitement for you in the relationship. Either way, you have to realize that an aging relationship will always feel mundane at some point or another. If you only seek the initial oh-my-gosh-im-so-in-love excitement forever, you will always have this same problem. You have to be sure the one you do end up with, you can find youself happy with and stay completely committed to, even when your board out of your mind with them.|`|ujYRfEbBaa	gcbgdfg bnvbnjvn    nvcncvncvnh    cvncvn     bvnvcncvncn|`|W99aAO5paa	Dumb him|`|7KXN0DDbaa	let go..it just won't work if you feel that way|`|1jIzBUkhaa	Dump him there are better guys

pdGvg3jsaa	Well how long have u guys been together? I mean im sure u guys love each other and everything but when it comes down to it its not fair for u to sit there and wait while he makes up his mind on what he wants. You have already made up ur mind apperently u already to him how u felt but he didnt seem to care. I say if he isnt in the same page as u then move on because if he isnt right now he might never be.. I had the same situation with my now ex bf we had been together for 3yrs I was ready for the next step and when I would ask him he would say I dont know so I waited and waited in the end he broke my heart.After 3yrs together and me waiting it took him only 1 month to find someone else.While im still here crying over it..In the end do what makes u happy cause its ur life. Good luck with everything:)|`|tCFoCNxbaa	I think the final decision is up to you. Personally, I think you should leave if he said the words "I don't want to commit" and your almost thirty. If you love him like you say do, try talking with him again. Find out how serious he is about your relationship and determine if you will be okay if you don't have kids. If you really love him and you are okay if their are no kids, then you should stay.
2Cw0DfaSaa	get a ride from your mom.. if you start being honest with her now it will be easier for you to become friends when your older and really need her help/ advice..   if she's like "oh well i though you guys didn't talk anymore" just be like "well you know mom people get into arguments and sometimes need time apart"...   im 18 and my mom is my bestfriend. i can talk to her about anything and when we have diasgreements about my boyfriend or anything i'll just tell her  "mom, i love you and apperciate your advice but, i need to do learn things for myself. and i'll never learn anything if you keep protecting me for the rest of my life"|`|YUjSRiv5aa	You should definitely tell your mom; she won't like it if you lie.|`|Go07H8bEaa	Be honest with your mother. Tell her you started talking to him again as friends after he apologized and that you just want to hang out. If she doesnt approve then get a ride from someone else but keep in mind theres no point in lying to her because if you do hang out with him and things are going great you will have to tell her eventually. Good Luck|`|u3Fnrvk3aa	Tell your mum.  She would much rather know than you keeping it a secret from her, its your choice not hers, if you want to see him to see if things work out then i totally think you should, it could work out this time.    Good luck!|`|UzGu9BD6aa	u should be honest with ur mom =]|`|izrZyHYraa	tell your mom|`|RthQ3whkaa	There's no point in lying. I mean, if you have to lie, you obviously are feeling guilty about it, so lying isn't going to make the situation any better. Ask your Mom for a ride, and if she disagrees with what you're doing, be straightforward and tell her, "Look, I'm growing up, sometimes I need to make my own mistakes to learn, if this is a mistake at all. You can either take me over there, or I'll find another way to get there, but you can't shelter me from the world forever." I mean, it's true.
h0CqELp5aa	Yes it is.   If you were to do it make it secret because its just something that you shouldn't do.   also it could get them into trouble incase other people think you're in a relationship|`|lSsYHpRbaa	yeah...unless you're in elementary school.  anything after that,it seems like you're a butt kisser or something.  but if you really like the teacher,do whatever you want=]|`|3UlGItEEaa	No, but it will make people think there is something between the two of you which could get him fired.|`|r0D3wLtbaa	yes...it's inappropriate|`|U9vE47hdaa	nope|`|LykjWv6faa	Yes, you may make him feel a bit uncomfortable.|`|W4C5p8qOaa	Yes. It's kind of inappropriate.|`|ozwLZwXeaa	If it says to Teacher other wise it is a            really bad idea.|`|smyhq0Ggaa	Yes    Just leave him alone, like he's going to want young girls to have crushes on him. He's probably going out or married to a real woman anyway.|`|ablriuUVaa	strange no,  i would consider it to be a lil bit of a *** kissing though  but whatver will get u better marks right?|`|90MSfEGSaa	i don't think women should give guys valentine gifts period|`|bfd7416d5c182b4368126038daa8026faa	yes it is  just because its valentines day|`|bNx1q5oWaa	no it just means that you care for him|`|ccb402364f76559985af31b2ece8e3ccaa	not if you give all of your teachers something. as long you have innocence in mind, you're fine..    good idea, we have that hot student teacher at our school jk jk jk!|`|4RiziMD0aa	not if you give all your other teachers gifts but if its only him yes. you might send the wrong message since valentines is a day of "love".|`|tTr6CU6oaa	yes i had a friend that gave one of our male teachers a gift and it weirded him out.|`|Kk9f3MdRaa	....yes|`|SDbbr1ALaa	it kinda is unless its an apple sorry
WtTUNC8Naa	Try going to a different place. Do different things. If you arent old enough to drink at a bar... why not try putt putt golf, bowling, the mall, movies, etc... there is alot of stuff you could do<br>  Take a walk in the park. Be creative. <br>  <br>  If you think that the time spent together is being wasted, why not say something. Do you like him? Does he like you? If the feeling is mutual between both of you that you two like each other, why not date? Go out and do stuff together. Stop going to the same place over and over. No wonder its getting boring, cause its the same place and probably with the same conversation. <br>  Explore! :-) be creative and spontaneous|`|1otrcKRpaa	End it with him.
jh9YA4gNaa	You know what !  he didnt use you he just wants you soo bad that he cant get over you and he only dated those girls cause he had to make you jealous   hope your happy :D|`|TmMuPgsIaa	I think he was trying to be polite as to wait a while after you broke up. The Time he broke up with his ex girlfriend i think maybe he was upset and just needed to talk and hang out with a friendly face.  If it was longer than 3 months then i would say he was using you but it was only a month. He,s just being nice and friendly because he knows your friendly and there for him.
jh9YA4gNaa	yeah you are stpuid for thinking this guy liked you when really he doesnt or never really did  so now your over him and your never going to talk to him again !|`|LykjWv6faa	Sounds like he's using you as a last resort.|`|eSI9c4Ncaa	It sucks to be the last resort, so don't. Tell him that you no longer want anything to do with him. He's chosen two other girls/women over you.|`|eG7pYnGxaa	Is he using you? Hang on, the second time around, you asked him to hang out with YOU!!!!!!    But judging from the question, i think your a very young girl with no life experience.|`|IA4x5oPMaa	probably he is|`|8JiTyw2Paa	most people call this hanging out, or being a friend. He can't use you if your not dating ********. Go get some therapy you stupid *** *****.|`|GV8bhsEcaa	Well sounds like he only likes you as a friend not a girlfriend. You broke up with him and if you still like him as more than a friend let him know and see what he says. So to me no he isn't using you unless it is more to what you are saying...|`|NVLHZZ0gaa	ur a idiot|`|8qVkSA4jaa	Using you? Are you giving him sexual favors?|`|SSmF7Zjyaa	Sounds like a friend to me...I think that you all enjoy each others company. If you all are having sex with each other after each break up, then thats probably using each other.
zdu3gh8jaa	At your age you should be deciding whether you want to go to church or not. In fact you should be making all the decisions in your life. As you are an adult, your mum should now have no say with regards your choice of religion, career, personal relationships or anything else really. The only thing she should have her say about is her house rules. Be respectful with her and just say that you have decided that you will not be going to church every week but you will still accompany her for special celebrations like christmas and easter. I hope it helps good luck.|`|AA12198711	If you are 24 then you should be making your own decisions and not being drug anywhere by anyone.|`|HJrTuihcaa	My mom used to but now she says, "if you don't want to go, that's between you and God"<br>  so she doesn't make us go, but it wouldn't do anything for me anyways because I try to listen but i have a very short attention span and i don't listen at all. but i do pray every night and so just tell her that it's your decision weather you want to go to church or not, she shouldn't make you.|`|UADLdXBtaa	That's where I'm at. If you are living with your parents and not paying them rent or anything you should still respect their rules. When I moved out I stopped going as much but I still go about once a month and on holidays out of respect for the way I was raised and to see my family. Move out and start supporting yourself and sleep in on Sunday if you want. You're 24. Do what you want.|`|cji3A8EOaa	omg yes! i hate it so much<br>  my dad used to drag me every single saturday<br>  i hated it, all i would do is sleep.<br>  then i threw like a fit i guess you could say<br>  and i dont have to go anymore.<br>  im 15 and he knows ive never believed in that stuff<br>  but he still tries shoving down my throat.|`|0ClA7HlEaa	Yeah, i hate too !<br>   i always have to go church every Sunday.<br>  every morning i have to wake up !!!!<br>  really early!! im always tired all the time!|`|aKjd20Ypaa	Trust me i understand u, i was forced to wear skirts all year round, no matter how much it snowed, because of my moms  religion, I went to church Tuesday, Thurs,Sat and SUNDAYS!!! N I HATED IT!!! <br>  But, then Again, parents do this because they thinks its whats best for their children. They try to look for every opportunity to make you get the best and be the best u can.<br>  That's why they take you to church, now you see this like a bad thing, but once you have your kids, and your getting old, and cant find ways to solve problems, you'll soon be going to church and dragging your kids with you, and Im only 21, so dont think i say this cuz im old.|`|QZgT8YZtaa	Stand up to her.........say you dont want to go........make an excuse like you have something to do or planneed something stand up for yourself u cant keep being bossed around like this especially at 24!!!
8nexYdUjaa	C'mon !!! someone that would say all of those mean things about you and then turn around & be nice to your face, is Not someone that you want to be with ! you should confront him about this and tell him that you don't appreciate this behavior. and he shouldn't think that after all of that, you're just going to fall right back into his arms ? until he's willing to show how he truely feels to everyone and not just you, Then you can consider. until then, have respect for yourself & let him go ! you can do better =) take care*|`|TXeUeiPHaa	He is rly stupid..ignore him.|`|DBdR26Ssaa	you probably just came on too strong and you scared him.|`|G9iIrib6aa	Sounds like he is playing games to me. If i were you i wouldnt even waste my time.|`|dGyX3E8Faa	Wow well he's really confusing then. Maybe the things you thought he said about you were rumors? It's not like you heard them directly from him. Some catty girls probably made it up. It seems he kinda likes you but is still unsure of his feelings.    If I were you I would ask him about the stuff you heard. Ask him if he actually said it, or if it was a misunderstanding.
v1tHjJ3haa	I've never Kissed a boy in my life, but does my twin kissing a boy on the cheek  in front of the teacher, his, mom, and other kids every week being 5 years old in Kindergarten count, LOL ! (: - later in 2nd grade the boy told me he liked me but I guess it's cause i never embarrassed him like she did! Lol ! :)|`|hiqdeojcaa	13 =] With my very first bf!
lAPUjEwOaa	It is called chemistry. Some times people just click and they work well together in a romantic relationship-- sometimes, you meet really great people who are meant to be your friend. It is OK to not have romantic feelings towards a really attractive person-- all it means is the two of you are not right for each other right now. Maybe in the future things will change, and you will see her differently, but for now, don't worry about it, and you certainly do not have to question your sexuality.  For now, if she asks you out, tell that you think that she is great, and you think that she is a wonderful and beautiful  person inside and out, but you do not feel that romantic connection RIGHT NOW. Let her know what you are thinking... honesty and clarity will make things a bit easier.    Best of luck to you!|`|HwVt9Zw7aa	Well, there's obviously a reason why you don't want to go out with her.        Tell us.|`|9LJupZrTaa	maybe u just don't feel like going out...and you're ok the way u are....|`|aXspxbXyaa	I think there is something about you that doesnt like her so its your choice but by the way it sounds you dont want to go out with her so i gues its best just to show her how you feel|`|b9sGbUD2aa	You say your not scared to go out and that may be the case but you may be scared of what will happen if you go out.  If she is a nice girl, has good looks and a good personality why not just try it out and go out once.  If you end up disliking the night then you dont have to go out with her again.  And if you do end up having a good time then continue to go out with her.  You have nothing to worry about. She's giving you the clues and hints i think its your turn to take them into consideration and ask her out.|`|OybeWztWaa	It's called chemistry.  Either you feel it towards someone or you don't, and there is no need to figure out anything more than that unless you're sensing a pattern and its somehow interfering with your life and goals.  Sometimes you just don't click with someone on a romantic level.  No big deal.    That being said, there is an important caveat:  You don't have to have strong feelings for someone to go out on a date... only to be dating.  Some might argue (like me) that dating is the process of determining IF you have that spark or not.  It is okay to have a date or two or more to see if chemistry can be found.  Some people hold back on parts of them for fear of rejection, and those might be some of the best things about them.  My wife, for example, does it for me on every level.  But the first time I met her she seemed a little snobby.  I thank god I gave it a chance, because I was all wrong about her.    Going on a few dates with someone who already knows that they are into you is tricky though and must be handled with grace and maturity.  Don't sleep with her if you're not sure, don't lead her on, etc.  Perhaps you can say (if you want to address it), "Hey, I feel like you might be interested in going out on a date with me.  I just want you to know that although you are a like able attractive person so far I don't feel a strong connection to you on a romantic level.  If you want to ask me out on a date or two I will say yes because you're an interesting person, but I don't want to screw up our friendship.  If after two or three dates I'm still not feeling it (or if you have second thoughts about me) and we shouldn't continue on, I'd like there to be a way to do that without hard feelings and to still remain friends."      Or something like that.|`|IVsUfHENaa	you like her but you are not in love with her .|`|s7gWSqV5aa	Are you sure you like girls?|`|U9vE47hdaa	maybe its just not time yet. either give it more time, or just date her.|`|aDLvzG2Saa	Homo much?|`|vF8DsOfRaa	There has to be a chemistry.  A wow factor.  You do not have to go out with someone just to be going out, there has to be a compatibility involved-that's what makes it fun.  You will figure it out...have some fun, but be safe.  Peace.|`|uqMK3rUZaa	Trust your gut. There might be a reason you two shouldn't date. :o)|`|vCTMZKrgaa	Maybe you just don't want a relationship right now.

KMT1v5mvaa	hey hun!   seems like youve figured this out for yourself...you just said your answer that "your not happy!" why hold on to something if  your not "happy". don't keep something going just to satisfy somebody else because you have to think about yourself and how you feel...to me it sounds like this relationship is EMOTIONALLY stressful and really isn't worth your time...if he thinks over-and-over-and-over that your cheating on him then he forreal needs to gain some self-confedience and stop trying to distroy yours! your beautiful inside and out..and he knows that and any man would b happy to b with u! so why waste your precious time on somebody that doesn't charish and love you as you do him! lifes WAYYY TO SHORTTT for all of this! so if you don't feel you have the heart to leave him..than take a break for a good 2months and make him relize his life without you in it!! but seriouslly hun its NOT WORTH the time, stresss, tears, arguments it really isn't because all this is just out of output  becuase hes simply "not confedient with himself" and taking it out on u isn't the answer! and if you wondering how i KNOW hes not confedient is becuase confedient guys don't "self-pitty" at all!   soo sweety thats my answer to your question i feel you can do ALOT better than that! but the choice is yours!      ?Cookie|`|Rch68tXlaa	Its time to let it go.

He needs to let go about the past, and focus on you and the future. But if you dump, maybe he'll feel crappy enough that he'll want you back.   He may think he's ugly, but he has one person that thinks the world of him and doesnt see nothing wrong except for the things he's doing and saying.     I think its time you two took a break and thought about things for a while.|`|nAYqN4xBaa	How many chances have you given him? If you're not happy and you force yourself to stay in this relationship, you'll be miserable for the rest of your life. If you really love this guy and want to give this relationship another shot BOTH of you need to do a lot of talking and compromising. There needs to be full honesty, if you want to try to make it work out. But it sounds like you're not happy at all and this guy really sounds very insecure, do you really want to live with that? or do you think he still has another shot?. Relationships are never easy, and love is not enough, it does not get any easier either. I cannot tell you to decide whether you should keep this relationship or not. This is YOUR decision. I can only give you advice on what to be aware of.

That seems like the case...you didn't provide any redeeming qualities about him. It might be an issue of you being afraid of being alone. Trust me, it is better.    P.S.- 98% of the time, if someone is accusing you of cheating and you are not, then it's them who is cheating. Especially if there's mental manipulation going on in order to make you feel guilty. Get out of there.|`|RMdIyIbFaa	He needs help, and not from you. You can't rescue him.

And I know you've heard the saying that misery loves company. I think that you should just let this relationship go, and if you really love himj and want to be with him, let him know that once he gets his life together and his head straight that you guys can talk about being together. But that you aren't going to allow yourself to be involved in an unhealthy relationship any longer.|`|9Eq9pozbaa	Break up with him. He needs to learn to trust in what he has to give, and let go of his insecurities before putting them into practice, in a relationship. It is not something you can help him with.

That means she must kind of like you. And is it a group, or is it just you two? If it is a group, then try to stay close to her at all times, and show interest. You never know what you will get out of it. If it is just you two, then make her feel relaxed around you, make her comfortable. Once you guys are really close, tell her you like her, but you don't want to ruin your friendship if she doesn't have same feelings. If she does have the same feelings, then you will know you did the right thing by telling her, and if she doesn't , well at least you tried right? Now you know where you stand with her, and that is always nice.|`|U9vE47hdaa	then eventually i might tell him my true feelings about him while we're on this date.
p6IGALzbaa	Well, love does exist. And people say that "there is only one out there made for you" but that's just not true in my book.  Beside the point, people can fall in love with someone and think the other person is in love with them too (the other person might even think they're in love, who knows?)  But it's honestly not love unless both people are feeling the same thing for each other and respect each other in the same ways.  Like... Two people can fall in love, but if one person is more into it than the other, then its not technically a functional, loving relationship.  You should always find someone who loves you, and you KNOW that they love you, not because they say it, but because you can tell by the way they talk to you.   You have to know by instinct if someone loves you.  Not only that, but if you love them.  Because its always good to have someone love you and make you feel special and happy, but you have to love that person too.  That's what makes a functional relationship, and it will make you proud when you can say with complete honesty that you are in love with someone.|`|tXFj8oSfaa	I think that love only last a short while, and when your tired of the person you love you feel like moving on with somebody else.|`|PoGtfu03aa	Love is real. I know that for a fact but its more than an emotion its an ability .. you have to allow it to grow and flourish. but you seem to not believe in it which is why you havent experienced it.       Open up.Go on a couple dates find someone you really have a connection with dont be afraid to get hurt and just give it you're all and then you'll realize that love does it exist and That its not just some silly emotion us humans feel.|`|AA11946390	Well, you're absolutely right. There's nothing wrong with not being in a relationship. Most people love the idea of being in love but don't have the discipline to really do what love requires of us.   However, love is definitely real, and your desire to rationalize the emotion may be where you're falling short. Loving is about selflessness, support, respect, companionship, hard work, trust, maturity, patience, and committment. These are the qualities and aspects of our lives that deep down we aspire to have. True love brings out those qualities in us. It also brings out our insecurities, envy, rage, and many other flaws. The best thing about love is that it reminds us that there is something bigger than ourselves. It exposes us to the world like no other emotion can.

xreWOKBYaa	Putting your daughter is a home is not a bad thing and don't let people tell you it is, you are not abandoning her! you just need to choose what is best, and if that means putting her in a home - then it's what needs to be done. I don't doubt you love her, but you just need to talk this over with your husband since it is "his" daughter (even though you have been raising her) just look at it from every angle.|`|f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	Take him and show him where you have in mind, arrange for him to talk with someone there.<br>  <br>  He's probably thinking he's a bad dad if he puts her in a home and he doesn't understand that this is no different than preparing a normal child for life on their own.<br>  <br>  In a calm moment, remind him that the two of you are getting older and won't be around forever and it's much kinder to put her someplace where she can have a life rather than shocking her with your deaths and she's lost not only her parents but her home.  What happens if something happens to one or both of you that doesn't result in your deaths.  if you become incapacitated due to age or disease then you still won't be able to take care of her.<br>  <br>  Remind him that you won't just be leaving her.  you will call her and visit with her and you can still take her on day trips or family vacations.  Ignore any family who speak ill of you.  I think it is more cruel to hinder her.  This way, she has a social life, she is around people like her and people her own age, she will learn to be as self reliant as she can possibly be and she will still be safe and cared for.|`|0AShsMsoaa	you have my support.  <br>  <br>  you are a smart and caring woman, i salute you.  <br>  <br>  knowledge is power, the more you can show him as to how this is good, hopefully the more he will understand. <br>  <br>  my thoughts and prayers to you, you are my hero.|`|EQbjmcYyaa	I am definitely on your side<br>  Take him to the home and show him around assure him that you two will visit her very often and that she will be taken care of very well<br>  <br>  good luck <br>  and its great you take such great care of her even though she isn't yours<br>  god bless

6chLhNJhaa	LOL.....O.k...Just go get another girl..it's easy as 123...expecially the girls IN D.C......They love white boys|`|Byz59nRGaa	Love is a chemical reaction to some extent and perhaps at some physical level you are "used" to her chemical sent and so the feelings for her aren't so strong.  But other than that, it's perhaps that when you started going out with her you didn't know her or yourself as well as you thought and probably had your own idea of how the relationship was going to play out.  As in anything in life we have expectations and sometimes they were unrealistic.  There's nothing wrong with you. It happens and as long as you take your next steps with respect and sensitivity towards her and yourself you'll be able to continue your life smoothly, with no regrets.  Take care, Love yourself and be Happy!

hZmmbLbEaa	i dont know this boy so i really cant answer the question "will he hurt me" i mean chances are no.  He is probably really torn right now and hurt.  And I can relate to your situation very easily, i just got out of a relationship that was horrible.  I think the best thing that you can do is distance yourself from him; and if you know he is going to be somewhere, dont go there alone or at all.  <br>  <br>  And i think now that you have had your closure it will be easier for you to move on and realize that there are better people out there and that you dont deserve a stupid boy :)
Sagc26Rcaa	haha how cute. i think you should maybe act friendly first and ask him to just hang out with you sometime, out side of church, maybe give him your number, and just start getting to know each other, and maybe then you will easily be able to tell if he likes you or not.|`|F8M5Qqbaaa	With ur description it's impossible to tell if he really likes u. It all depends on you, if you like him be nice to him, give him compliments, a pat on the back or something for some physical contact.

And ask if he likes you...|`|atNbl4ataa	his quietness might be a sign that he does. and if you both are to shy to say anything not much is going to happen. try to have at least a little bit of a conversation. glances and smiles dont get you far...|`|gShmclV8aa	this is not stupid i am currently in the same dilemma at school and i am also shy, there are a few signs if he keeps looking at you when u see him, does he seem to look for you a lot. the best thing to do is to try and get to know him better but that may be a problem seeing as neither of you have a car.|`|PducgYm5aa	Test, First Stare At Him Girl If He Laughs assume he kinda likes you and if he makes a face you got your answer. Second, BUMP into him a smile and say "I'm sorry are you okay?" If he says something bad then you know he doesn't like you and if he says something not mean like "I'm okay are you" then he loves you girl go get him!
TthDWtPTaa	yes
jtL8vb6paa	Honestly I would never stare at someone because I had bad thoughts about them. I find it hard enough keeping eye contact with girls because their beautiful! In my case it would never be nasty.
B7kPUmUWaa	I think anyone is capable of changing if they really want to. But you have to acknowledge that your behavior was wrong and truly want to do better for yourself and the women that you date. So, yes.|`|IPS3hWweaa	No, it's a part of them like an aspect of personality. It's very hard to change someone's personality.|`|rxScdXM4aa	he would really have to do some hard work...maybe he could change but the who would believe him?|`|FImMEdNIaa	Its improbable, possible, but improbable, people often stay in such relationships merely because we are resistant to change and thus hold on to whatever miniscule hope there is as long as we are within familiar grounds, more often than not its not worth it.|`|MdSDlnfcaa	Everyone can and does change a little bit, but probably not that drastic a change.  I would say likely not.|`|a984cQjKaa	if he truly wants to, but i don't advise a woman to ever stick around to wait and see if he'll change.|`|AA11324847	I donno can a slut ever change?|`|a1uoxczTaa	i would say yea because some I knews dad was a drunk and beat his wife and kids badly. today he is the sweetest guy i have ever met and has a great relationship with his wife and kids... he just had to stop drinking. i guess with a problem like that it would be easier to overcome then a real anger problem without even needing to b influenced by anything.|`|uAVbakOSaa	yea they can change into a cell queen when they end up in jail. It is called role reversal. Get ready tough guy|`|6Zr73g7zaa	Nope. Unless he really wants to. But its unlikely|`|nmiXLhwCaa	I think it is possible with help but unlikely.|`|mbvCTR2uaa	i have one word for you: RUN!!!! RUN AWAY AND NEVER LOOK BACK, I TELL YOU!!|`|G64z6K1naa	NO!!|`|HdRnppyUaa	Nope, he will beat your *** silly
poZfLPe0aa	Two weeks isn't long enough to consider it anniversary-like, but you want to get her something for the holiday itself. That's understandable and honorable.     Be creative. Maybe write her a poem or serenade her. She'll be pleased that you made the effort, regardless of what every you may choose.
oWJybhLTaa	Well, you might want to try shot glasses or beer tumblers, if they are a drinking crowd; picture frames, key chains, or something else generic and add with you and h2b initials.|`|ow4Ec8eqaa	How about something they can eat?  <br>  Like a box of cookies?|`|ECe1rgsdaa	Guys like food, so do some sort of cookie or something. :)|`|26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	Men never turn down food|`|XlhBBZPxaa	also depends on if they are bachelors or not maybe they would like the same thing as the women ( secretly ) let your hubby to be decide what to give the men|`|mQSk7fB6aa	They're not really my thing either.<br>  <br>  Perhaps just a simple bar of decent soap would be nice, maybe moulded into an interesting shape to match the bombs.|`|AcBbB39aaa	Cigar bars have become really big, you could give a cigar to each of the guys.|`|91f956efb63a51bcca06586fcc2fe99aaa	chocolates! key rings, lighters. my mom did a boy of matches with our names on it and date of wedding.
qbnrzyCZaa	Yea I would be a little pissed so just talk and say how you got mad/ sad from that and she'll probably make it up to you. Good Luck :)|`|GIqTYkgdaa	It depends i really wouldn't get that mad. It's not really that big of a deal a less she did it because she dosen't want to sit at your lunch table anymore. hope this helps|`|N8J84PFDaa	no; i mean she sits with you guys all the time one day isn't going to kill you<br>  <br>  answer mine please<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090225135333AA8XGFx">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|OMipl4lDaa	uh not really<br>  its rude<br>  but i wouldnt be mad|`|yqy5xfSbaa	not really|`|08FETUeZaa	I wouldn't exactly be mad. It's not a big deal I would just go to my friend and ask why they left. I wouldn't just be mad at them and not talk to them or anything. It's no big deal if she wanted to talk to someone about a party. Unless you were the only one sitting at the table. If she just left me alone I would be mad about it. But if you were with other people then no.
Y6Dx3ezvaa	its perfectly okay! I didnt havemy first kiss untill I was 16, I still haven't had a real boyfriend though :P   It sucks but its not that big of a deal. trust me theirs a lot of people who havent had their firstkiss/boyfriend yet.    Goodluck girl and dont rush it!  Kelly|`|JnlxjYNuaa	you need one i'm here just name what you want at travoltamangwiro@yahoo.com|`|B1WxEIyXaa	Yes, everyone moves at their own rate and someone will come along for you soon.  Don't sweat it.|`|AA11293866	It doesnt matter what the rest of the world thinks. What do you think? If you are not ready for kissing and having a boyfriend yet, then just wait. If you are ready, I still recommend that you wait for the right boy to come along.|`|wKsALWsdaa	yea  its ok girls are just such whores these days i was 18 when i had my first bf i didnt care that most girl did. i didnt want to date a random guy in HS bc i was waiting for the right person. why do you possibly need a bf at 15 hang out with your girlfriends  and focus in school!!|`|IcEQcIWbaa	It's time for u to become a "geek to freak" person.  15 is ok for dating.    Maybe coz u're shy that u don't have a BF.    Hope u'll have 1 and maybe ur first kiss.  Peace!|`|egN478Bbaa	Yeppers!  U need to wait until U are ready!  Don't feel pressured but neone else!|`|GaouUtGTaa	Yeah, sure! It really isn't a rush or a competition. You start having those REAL relationships in college or when you get older.|`|tzzYdnZKaa	Ya it's ok! there is plenty of time for that! You don't have to fall into peer pressure!
IPS3hWweaa	Common sense is what most people would agree to. It's the most common answer, which is why it makes it "common sense."<br>  <br>  For example, if you thought stepping in front of a speeding train was a good idea, but you were the only one out of a group of 10 people, common sense would say you are wrong, and you are! Of course, in real life, common sense is dictated by the world's population, not a small group of people.<br>  <br>  If there is a disagreement about what would make the most common sense, you need to poll a large group of people and find out what the most common answer is. Sounds like common sense to me.|`|0F8hauikaa	I don't think that common sense is always necessarily learned, or if it is, sometimes the lesson is lost. Some people just seem to have it and some don't. I think it could have something to do with individual brain chemistry. Example: Two children in the same family, when around the age of two, one puts everything he finds in his mouth, although Mom and Dad constantly discourage it, while the other just seems to have the "common sense" not to without having to be told. <br>  <br>  As far as who agrees with who, there isn't always a right or wrong answer if it's not based on facts, sometimes it's just one's opinion, even if you might not consider it to be a valid one.|`|Lqy9Lc9Oaa	Common sense is a mixture of many things.  We can be taught some, learn some and be born with some.  Some of it also comes from just a "gut feeling"  Some people have more then others and some people have (or seem to have) none at all.  Hope that helps!!|`|v3Motq8Iaa	Common sense means never having to ask for answers to questions like this on Yahoo! Answers.|`|iVnQ4aCiaa	WTF?  I shot the sheriff.|`|jK5FXm6Naa	There isn't a question here your just ranting|`|7It5ORAyaa	Okay, I think I understand what you're asking.<br>  <br>  When judging who is right or wrong in a situation, who really gets to decide if it's moral or not?<br>  <br>  <br>  My answer, would be in all cases the only person that can determine if you're wrong or right would be yourself.<br>  <br>  You know yourself better than anyone else does, and yes I'm aware that I'm saying that if you judge your own self you may perceive all of your actions to be good, when most of the time that isn't the case, but in all actuality your heart tells you what you're doing is wrong or right. So, before anyone else judges you, you should have already came up with a idea of it on your own.<br>  <br>  if the opposing judge agrees or disagrees with what you think, then that might give you an opinion on if you were right or wrong in the situation.|`|AA11733625	"How in the heck do we get to an area of common ground when it comes to common sense? If I don't agree with you, and you don't agree with me, who's the sheriff? "<br>  <br>  Common sense is... when two people do not agree and after all attempts to come to an agreement, you either have to compromise and meet in the middle, and if that cannot be done, then you have to agree to disagree. Respect that you have individual points of view. <br>  <br>  Heck... that is one of the things America prides itself on.. individuality.<br>  <br>  If all attempts to reach common ground fail... no one is the sherrif and you're all vigilanties...|`|6eSRjnx4aa	And I suppose wasting your time thinking about this is why you're single? I don't see any other reason for it being in this section.<br>  <br>  Like many things in life, common sense is controversial. What is common sense to you is not common sense to somebody else. We have reason to judge things with, and reason indicates that evolution may have been responsible for giving us reason and logic. Doesn't mean God can't fit anywhere, but our evidence today shows that evolution is a more compelling explanation.|`|fPHjh4Jsaa	are you asking what is common sense?<br>  <br>  common sense is just the smart thing to do, the right thing to do, or the most logical thing to do<br>  <br>  for example, if your pants is on fire and there is a bucket of water beside you, you would put the fire out with the water|`|f79674f11cb0d8833ea9b2f32ce01461aa	You make broad sweeping statements with no basis in reality. (Common sense from evolution?)<br>  You use run on sentences and sentence fragments.<br>  You do not clearly state your question and yet, insult those who try to answer you.<br>  And you think the problem lies with us and not you.|`|B7kPUmUWaa	I think that you are making something complicated when it's really not. Why does someone have to be right or wrong? I guess I don't understand what you're asking. I personally think common sense comes from life experience. But I'm also not the sheriff.|`|OjQpIa75aa	no i do understand<br>  totally =D|`|eZj1qCd7aa	Ok...|`|AA10724416	According to me common sense is something that a man of ordinary prudence would do or think or behave in a given particular situation. I guess it does not come from our parents. Its something we gain from our everyday experiences.<br>  Common Sense would probably be the sum of skills, ethics, morals, experience, principles and other positive virtues in life. <br>  Too difficult to define though.|`|AA10705246	Ok common sense and whos right and wrong are two different things.  Common sense is hard to define because it is based on many different things (values, location, hertiage, etc) what we see as common sense might not be the same as someone that lives in the woods.  Our common sense will tell us not to walk in front of cars where someone who has never seen a car would have no idea not to.  Its not something your born with its something you learn
ZzEAc5ecaa	terri.. its his b/day ...just wish him well.. and ask if hes having a party..|`|Y6UHIhB2aa	Yes, send the text and this will show that you are totally fine with being friends. It will make you look good ;-)|`|xNkmK0SHaa	I would send nice card (not "romantic") by US Mail.  If you don't have a mailing address, the relationship was much less than casual.|`|V1i6c9qMaa	Need more info then that, but if you feel like you can send the text with out any emotional attachment expected I would say go for it. If you expect something back, maybe just give him/her a call and test the inflection in there voice.|`|5ClyVGJKaa	Silence is deadly..let it go|`|jj2tSASnaa	i'd stop overthinking it.  do what is in your heart.|`|d0lye0cyaa	I would just say Happy Birthday to show I remembered and still cared enough to say it.|`|43d7a21af8d915738baae55d52dda119aa	i think its perfectly ok to text and say happy birthday.|`|0d449c620e934cbe25e669b17809e621aa	Talking it out..is better then waiting..=/!!  Things might go fine if you guy's just both let your feelings out..instead of waiting so much =/|`|CD9ZMxBTaa	since your asking this question it seems as if you have feelings for this individual.. the sooner you confront these feelings the better otherwise it will eat you up. if you dont have feelings for this person how are you going to screw up a true "casual" relationship with a hi?|`|dzbblpjgaa	Send a text for the birthday but be prepared for a call in reply. Are you prepared for that? We all have issues, it does let people know where you are in their priorities. In situations like this just apologise for not seeing them. You are not obliged to reveal all your life since the last meeting as you are "Casual". You save "Tell All" for your very best friend -if you talk about it at all!|`|bb06GQ5Paa	Yes, I'd call to say happy birthday.|`|dPULl5hjaa	Yes, definitely.........chill out until the drama is over!
AbAHhcwiaa	ok so im homeschooled and i went out with this guy for like 2 months,  my sis goes to the same school he does and she told him that i liked another guy, which was not true, so he dumped my :(|`|MwpRycHSaa	I've only been dumped once. I've dumped many people though.    The one guy who dumped me did it because he was jealous that I had a celebrity crush. His immature *** called me and just said "It's over" and hung up. It was pretty bitchh azz of him. Lol
BL4PEjAWaa	for 31 years now.|`|BPqK0c5taa	Yes right now but she constantly tells me the same thing. She is just so amazing, I wish I could give her more.|`|sCr2iTczaa	Yes and it sucks|`|JxNDTbS4aa	yes and it's all an illusion. you have your own beauty whether you're a guy or a girl and there's someone out there who can appreciate eveything about you. if you think you're not good enough then you're insecure and need to realize that you're just in a bad relationship and it's not your fault. you're a normal human being like everyone else but one of a kind.
hhduYRfdaa	I didn't know there was a minimum?|`|psn7Prigaa	I don't think it matters, it's whenever you feel like that person is "the one". Me & my boyfriend were eachother's firsts, and we both feel like we don't need to sleep with anyone else to be satisfied. He only gets turned on by me, and vice versa.
0mHi3S2Raa	Oh man I know how you feel. I'm in almost the exact same position. He's clingy and just always There! I can't do anything without him right in my face...man is it aggravating. I asked him to leave for a couple days yesterday, and he's already Begging me to let him come back. Of course I was too soft hearted to tell him no but I told him I didn't want to because I didn't want to put him through the same thing all over again, He doesn't care and wants to come back anyway!  I wish I actually had some advice for you but I have no clue what to do myself! At least we both know we're not the only ones in this position though. We should talk! lol|`|t0uIgY08aa	been there done that, left him... you should too.|`|cYRZpGkqaa	kick his *** out!|`|7543ecccee07c9c1c32ee1b21fd58295aa	grow up!
QePbhS8Caa	I read it all ... it hurt my brain, but I read the whole thing and all I can say is ...    WHY?! Why are you punishing me? I'm just trying to be helpful and answer people's questions. WHY, GOD, WHY???|`|W4C5p8qOaa	You are ridiculous.|`|7VfWz7zyaa	You like write like to much. And talk about like an essay...  + I take it that was a joke?|`|WN6tWLdYaa	i would ask him why he did that and what made him decide to go with your friend. i dont think it is even worth visiting him.|`|vHDiHL43aa	o_O wow.... i think my brain just melted from reading all of that... jeeze!  (I take it this was all a joke anyway....)
U6JvnfNVaa	that's a good height|`|UgcPxd4maa	Im only 5'3" so I love taller guys 6' and over|`|FWsv3Schaa	it depend how tall they are.. if the woman is short then 6 feet is a little too tall but not shorter than like 5'9    answer mine on my page?|`|Mu2XsFpeaa	I like my height: 5/6 or up to 6ft...dont really prefer really tall guys b/c its a bit awkward honestly!|`|gaqyFsktaa	i'd date you because you're tall! lol, i'm 5'10'' and need a tall guy. :)|`|xDlBM6N6aa	I'm 5'8 and like taller guys.  Your height is fine for me.  If you're in shape and are athletic that's def. a big plus, and tall guys with a nice sense of humor, I really like guys like that.|`|GSxUQbDMaa	well since im tall (172cm) I would prefer 177-185cm ^^|`|Go07H8bEaa	I'm 5'2 so he def. has to be taller than me haha. I would say between 5'10 and 6'3. I like to feel protected lol|`|tzzYdnZKaa	I just like someone who is taller than me. I am 5'3" and I like a guy that is 5'5" to like 6'
acWyJ3t0aa	Just ask her what she is going to have to present to her one day husband , her mate for life . She won't have that one special thing that you can only give to one person and only one time , her virginity . You on the other hand will and because you want it to be so . Explain to her that guys especially young ones will tell you anything , ANYTHING to get into your panties and then they are off to their next conquest . Then when and as you grow up , they begin to start looking for someone to take home to mom and dad , and they don't look for someone whos is really sexually active and has been since age 7 . Remember when you sleep with a guy , then you are also being exposed to anything or everything , that he has been exposed to in the past . No one is immune from STDS nor or they immune , no matter what method they use , from getting pregnant and with that type of guy , you can bet he is going to run fast when given that news screaming at the top of his lungs , she is easy , she's slept around since she was 7 and that kid is not mine .<br>  Think about it|`|YG4VMafEaa	I am so serious I lost it at age 8 but my friend made me do it with her...yeah it was a her...please don't send me mean messages and things I wouldn't lie about this type of thing. I don't like to tell anyone. My parents know and I haven't seen her ever since she forced me too do it and I don't think you should hold it against her. Maybe she didn't know what she was doing.<br>  :-(|`|y6hhAKDNaa	Oh my god she is 7 year old and she make sex oh it’s really sad for her, tell her to stop all that because she is still 7 year old. That doesn’t make sense to make sex of 7 year old girl.|`|1U42A309aa	She IS lying and is obviously an attention seeker.|`|m3lt0Sa0aa	I almost lost my at 6 years old with my friend, but I didn't know what I was doing so I don't know she could've lost it don't judge to quickly.
9TWdWoTwaa	O shut up you sod.Don't blame the drug dealer! Blame the idiots for buying the drugs from them. They have brains unless they are all sheep.    Edit: Are you sitting here and telling me a 11 year old can't think for him self. And doesn't know about drugs. Please you idiot. They teach this in 1st grade.|`|LykjWv6faa	I most definitely agree. I'm against capital punishment, but I would like to see them rot in prison.|`|SyHmExgtaa	Don't be so judge mental. Sometimes we see people doing wrong and immediately want to crucify them without knowing the whole story of how they got to that point in their life or what makes them do what they do... so I would say what others do to survive in this world is their business and none of mine.|`|kDZZuxYaaa	you're dumb. Its the people who decide to buy the drugs. No one is forcing them to do it. get your head out of your ***. If there were no drugs they would turn to something else.\    Sorry to say then but your 11 year old brother is stupid. I would never have thought of trying to buy drugs when i was 11.    One more thing, most drugs are not the enemy(besdies **** like amphetamines). Alot actually have medical uses, its just that people cant cope with life so they just end up doing them all the time. You should know what you're talking about before you open your mouth|`|scnW0Wzeaa	I think they should be taken outside and hanged.|`|7VSGyWCPaa	A drug dealer is no different than any other person(s) with a product. thank money hungry america for drug dealers and others like them. thank the government for not doing more to protect everyone. thank freedom of choice for giving people the choice to buy and sell drugs. and parents for not guiding the youth of today. and theres alot worst things and people out there than a drug dealer.|`|dzbblpjgaa	Why should the tax payers pay for a life time of meals in jail? Get them to pay there own way with hard labour in or outside. Even better, well supervised Community Service doing many necessary jobs helping rehab addicts and help the homeless. Each person should be interviewed and helped in some way to prevent further offending and enable them to then help others.     Family background can draw some of these young people to drugs as a sense of escape, others just experiment and get out of their depth. Whatever the reason the end needs to be the same. Get rid of the demand and the supply will dry up.    Drugs used to be pure. Now they are mixed with all manner of bulking agents. Some could be as toxic as the drug itself. This can change the strength of  the original drug and accidential overdose can occur.    So whether an addict or a dealer. Geting the person a better quality of life is all important. Get as good a job you can and get those important qualifications. For those who cannot read and write still it is a longer road. The self confidence that comes from starting to learn with support of other people of their own age, learning while fitting in around family commitments will get people to a higher level in society and towards a better way of life. It is a struggle to begin with but no more of a struggle than carrying on in a way that is of no benefit to them or society in general.      Incase the above is too long -   The countries where the drugs are produced are doing it because they need to eat. Help aid these third world countries with an alternative means to make a living and you reduce the production of the heavy drugs. Just a thought!|`|qWlLjdJgaa	i disagree, some are just trying to make money. My cousin ruined her life that way too, *she* ruined it not her dealer. she made the ultimate descion not da dealers same with ur bro. dont blame any1 but him|`|zd9dotWHaa	You said it, it's not the drug dealers fault, it was your brothers. Don't you realize that the war on drugs has failed?    Maybe YOU should have been watching YOUR brother more closely.|`|DBrNaYNyaa	did you know it cost 10 000 a YEAR to keep ONE prisioner in jail? not possible to put them in jail. And its their life, they can live it however they want. They dont choose to sell to some people, they clearly go to them. And some people just buy it to have a good night, have fun. Not use it everyday.  So no, they shouldnt its their lives and thats how they chose to live. Nothing wrong with it. Its the buyers fault for choose that path.|`|bRBZ5KX3aa	it supply and demand. if people didnt want the drugs there would be no drug dealers. you idiot    if somebody ruins their life by drinking do you blame the barman?|`|tXFj8oSfaa	well they should be punish, but more stupid than the drug dealers are those who actually buys the drugs from them. I mean why would anybody do drugs I know people can't be that stupid and know the consenquences of takeing drugs I mean people know what there' doing right|`|5gKg5S0vaa	I think people should accept responsibility for their own lives and stop blaming everyone else.  If it hadn't of been drugs it probably would have been alcohol or something just as bad,  Should landlords and liquor stores take the blame for alcoholics?|`|91aDQQ66aa	I agree with euphoric.  Besides how else are we supposed to make a living in this ****ed up economy|`|AqvEHHsTaa	I believe that they should be put in jail as well.  I agree that they target young people to get them hooked on the drugs.  It is disgraceful and completely immoral.|`|psn7Prigaa	No because sometimes the people dealing the drugs are just as much a prisoner as the people hooked on them. It may seem that they have it good, making money off of people's addictions, but you have to stop & wonder why they have to do that instead of making money & being successful the honest way.
rtk02g0gaa	If u dont want to see he just ignore he that would be so much easie just block anythin u have with her
L0Hz227xaa	First, she probably does like you because if sh didnt, she wouldnt pay you any attention. She probably doesent want people to know right now how she feels, the reason I say this is becasue if she turned her back on you when she was with a group, she probably didnt feel comfortable at that moment. There may have beena guy she liked in the group as well, and didnt want you both to know, one of her friends may secretly like you,a nd doesent want her to know, it could be anything but my advice is to not sweat it, let her show you she is interested and approach you, flirt backa nd show her attention but do not be too obvious because u may make an a** of yourself and make her loose interest. She probably had a bf back then or was dating someone. I dont thnk she is playing ahrd tog et, just fall back and be easy, she will come around.|`|cvl5GPzeaa	well if she changes moods and stuff she probably is playing hard to get or maybe shes not. try to go up and talk to her and tell her how you feel and ask her of her rude behavior.|`|cUyxNNDGaa	She probably just wants to see if you are really interested in her. If you go out of your way to talk to her or ask her out then she knows you are really interested in her. Just keep talking to her. Or ask her how things are going in her life, maybe there is a reason for all of this madness.  :)    good luck!|`|LpbDMyZkaa	Maybe she's bipolar or something. I don't know what's playing hard to get, because I don't have much experience. But it could be, or you tried to talk to her in the wrong time, when she wasn't alone.  She could be deciding if she dates you or not, so sometimes she wants something and in another she doesn't want the same thing. She's insecure? I don't know. Maybe she's ignoring you because you don't invite her to date her so she's showing you that you could lose her, advertising you to be faster. 'Cause if you're really a nice guy and she's nice to you, I can't think she don't like you.|`|wd7okk2daa	well, she probably likes you because you are such a nice guy but it sounds like she's a shallow ***** :/ maybe a little image obsessed? idk  I know it sounds horrible, but I used to do that to guys all the time, I'm not proud of it, but I was just so image obsessed. I would talk to really nice guys all the time, but once a really hot popular guy came around (jerk or not) I would be on him in a second. I know it was a really shallow thing, but I think she sounds nice underneath it all or who knows maybe she was just caught up in the moment! If I were you I would ask her out, so you know if she is serious or just playing games.|`|AA11192442	The thing is, anything could have happened to her. Something tragic in the family, a personal issue, anything. She's probably not playing hard to get, because you're probably not the only guy who's interested in her. You're going to have to ask her out or something, because girls who play hard to get don't go Jekyll and Hyde on you, from my experience.    So either ask her what was up or just ask her out.|`|WVvn8aSCaa	Maybe she got mad at you for a stupid or reason. Or something happened. Ask her if she was okay.|`|2d8c6f27c3437723163ff69e22f22598aa	rest of the semester*    anyway...  maybe she didnt like you that day.  bad hair day perhaps?  or maybe she thinks her friends wont like you
PoGtfu03aa	girl break up with him ASAP ..  it might not even be that hes embarassed, he might just have another girl so hes getting the names confused. Sounds bad i know but it might be the truth.         just drop him, he cant even acknowledge you why would you want him.  you deserve better and you're deff gonna find someone who wont be embarassed to say you're name around others. Thats the kind of guy you need to be with and if you're boyfriend cant do  that then drop him he should want to be around you all the tme not that he has to be but he should want to be.|`|BopBYwSdaa	He does not deserve you!|`|wMM8za2laa	sorry to say but i think he is a shamed of you..,,, i say because im a shamed of my boyfriend im with  him because  I feel sorry for him.
PRgf7M6zaa	depends on the person I suppose but with most women sex is such an all encompassing emotional thing that you really have to know the person to fantasize about them. You have no idea what a random stranger is like|`|2esGKO2Caa	When you figure women out Let the rest of us know Write a book and make lots of money|`|1oGRuniyaa	well if i'm in a good relationship, which i make sure is 100% of every relationship i agree on, i i look at other guys and think they are hot and sometimes imagine them in bed, etc  but then i turn around to my boyfriend smiling at me and i know he's the only one for me.      **However: if he never kisses me, i might look at other guys for more than a few seconds...|`|xgJbxZgfaa	everyone will look at someone if they're attracted to them- it's a natural human thing. just don't let it be more than a look if you're with someone! got it!|`|TZCzjpGmaa	no one should be denying this...  women are generally attracted by good looking guys and overwhelmed by the below two sentences.    "you are beautiful"  "you have got a beautiful smile"|`|aFaSMYPFaa	I think that all depends on people... I've got no problem saying to my husband if I think some other guy is attractive.... I cant say though, that I've never done this :p with a guy I was before I'd act the saint and denied it all--though he was so over-protective and paranoid about me that he would have jumped to conclusion that I was sleeping with them..    I mean of course we're still going to find people attractive outside our relationship. I wouldnt say all of us fantasize about the attractive stranger though.     I admit us women are strange creatures but I dont think theres any difference here from how a guy would react in the situation. Some will deny it, some will fantasize about things, some will be open to anything|`|aLgY4l3Naa	Women are moved by touch and by the way they are being talked to, so in most cases i would say a woman most of the time does not get attracted to some random guy off the street, more so she is definitely attracted to her significant other and who she has already bonded with, on the other hand men are moved by what they see, an attractive girl comes by and they don't care about anything else but HITTING THAT or at least FANTASIZING about that girl!! We are soooooo very different!!|`|alaUYtRcaa	They deny it because they are scared of losing their relationship. In my situation I would hurt my boyfriend if he thought I was attracted to another guy.|`|Byz59nRGaa	When in a relationship women do notice and admire an attractive guy but when you're connected emotionally, mentally and your mate is attentive, it's the attractive guy that looks on longingly at the two of you.  There is no fantasizing by the female of a partner if you are connected emotionally, mentally and they feel special to their mate.  There really is no desire to consider hooking up or fantasizing outside the relationship, and this includes when the boyfriend is not around.  Yes we look, but would never consider or imagine touching if all is good in the relationship. That's my two cents worth.  Take care, Love Yourself and be Happy!|`|ECv2QGYdaa	PPPHHHHTTTT women lie... hardcore liahs .. there might be the very occassional woman that is a one way only thing but the rest are lying..... most will look an fantasize but would never act out on them...
f7f0fd5f021b5d1e4672cdbda2a11ffeaa	Brain to mouth ratio.|`|AA11441704	I don't think it is only 7%..........look again.....    I like shoulders.......|`|f4Ms77qzaa	EYES .    with the lips, they can lie without showing it. if you look deeply into their eyes you can really tell if they lie or really mean it .|`|aWvuZJjRaa	im kinda shallow. so the man has to have a nice body and face.|`|QAGaQUDRaa	I'm kinda weird, but I find toned upper backs to be sooo attractive, lol.|`|56buyQZ1aa	tall, normal weight, normal or wide shoulders, doesnt have to have muscels, goooooooooood dressed- normal but wide clothes, masculine attitude, confidence, but some also shy, straight body when he walks, great aura!!!!!, if ypu look at him and you know he is a really good person, not arrogant!!!!   face: i dont go for the prettiest boys, but i like the pretty ones too, but i also like boys who are average or sympathic :D|`|e5FoLh2Paa	He's gotta have a nice smile.  This means NO missing teeth and no rotten ones either.  While the outside is good--that's not what's kept me happily married for nine years!|`|wKsALWsdaa	i love broad shoulders and height i love tall men! mine is 6'5|`|mbv2jLqDaa	Not muscular, not scrawny, but built  Toned body and nice arms especially   Broadish shoulders....not too broad  Slim waist? Meh...just no beer bellies!|`|yKWMSUd3aa	As far as looks go:  Tall,  broad shoulders,  toned - cut body... Not body builder material or steroid body,  just well rounded toned and cut..  But most importantly I am a girl that is about the little things.. A wonderful personality goes a long way.  Sometimes if a guy has the sweet stuff (personality) on the inside,  the outside doesn't always have to be exactly what we think our ideal man should look like.   Looks are not always everything!!  Good Luck!!
LxvA4vGpaa	There are a couple options:<br>  <br>  A) He has feelings for you and is upset that an idiot a-hole has you and doesn't realize what a great thing he has.   Your friend KNOWS he will treat you better and like you deserve to be if given the chance.<br>  <br>  B)  He knows something about your husband and isn't directly telling, but informing you in a round-about way that you are stupid for staying with him and that your husband will never change his cheating/stupid/immature ways.<br>  <br>  C)  He is a true friend and maybe doesn't have hard evidence that your husband is still doing "naughty" things, but knows enough to know that he is a cheating man-whore and is sick of seeing you be used and abused.  He is sick of seeing his friend being tossed aside by the one person in her life that should never toss her to the side.  he is saddened by it and can't take seeing it anymore.<br>  <br>  My recommendation?  Actually listen to what your friend said and examine your situation without the rose-colored glasses you have been wearing for so long.|`|aSoCKVJ3aa	Your friend is right and I think you know it. You said it yourself - "I mean is he so frustrated with me that he doesn’t want to talk anymore?"  He *is* tired of your situation and cannot understand that you don't understand that you have a one-sided relationship where your husband does what he wants whilst you just sit by and complain about it without doing something to correct the situation.  In other words he sees you as a hopeless victim who in some odd way enjoys being the victim. Good Luck : )|`|iPNOVR6Gaa	Sometimes, when you have a friend you really care about, you get so sick of seeing her stepped on that you don't want to hang around her anymore, because it's just too painful to watch.  That's the feeling I had when I read your details.|`|y9CgveCGaa	I think your friend is carrying a torch for you.  He's probably got a worse idea of you relationship than it is because he hears mostly the venting you do.  As for not responding I think it is because he was embarrassed about ranting and letting you know he has feelings for you.|`|Tl9bgQzFaa	If that was me I would have not forgive him for what he have done to me and to his son/daughter. Im just sayin if that was me in that situation.|`|875b9562d8defd3804154e34c3bf5ea4aa	If your friend is this upset there is only 2 reasons why.<br>  1. Your husband is a jerk and you are in denial, your friend is sick of watching you be treated like crap while you sit around and take it. Believe me love can be blind, and sometimes you put up with a lot more than you should just because you think it's suppose to be that way. Maybe you can't even see it since you are in the situation. But obviously there are some issues if your husband would rather go out than be with you. That's wrong. I mean once in awhile sure, but not all the time.<br>  2.Your best friend is in love with you. Only someone who truly cares about you would get really upset at the thought of you being mistreated. So no matter if he's just being a good friend, or if he loves you this guy really cares. But it's possible he feels as if you deserve better, (him) and that is why he got upset. <br>  You need to sit down with your friend and talk. Tell him you appreciate him sticking up for you, but that you don't understand why it's affecting your relationship with him. Get to the bottom of it. Ask him straight up why he is so upset about it.|`|9QyrW2iCaa	I would have to agree a lot with what your male friend has been telling you.  Your friend is frustrated seeing you NOT take his advice.  Your friend wants you to stick up for yourself more than what you are telling him with situations w/your husband.  <br>  <br>  Recently some of the best advice I got was to treat my husband like a dog.  Not a bad dog or scroungey dog, but like a loved family pet.  With a (pet) dog you give clear "NOs" and praise.  You set CLEAR boundaries.  There is no guesswork.  I felt mean treating my husband like this, but oddly enough (and aren't men odd sometimes?) he started responded much better to me and I started to get some more things that I wanted/needed.  I am very clear with him.  There is no mush-mush or expecting him to "guess" what I'm thinking and no useless attitude "that he should JUST know" what I need/want.<br>  <br>  As far as your friend, he probably misses the good/fun times you guys had talking and has now been relegated to therapist.  Ug!  What a way to kill a friendship.  Yes, of course we all need for people to hear us out in bad times, but no one in general really wants to be another person's (unpaid) therapist.  Your friend is probably overloaded and withdrawing from you so that you DO work it out with your husband, instead of turning to him with the marital problems.<br>  <br>  Another GREAT source of information would be the book by Cloud and Townsend entitled "Boundaries in Marriage".  I highly recommend reading this book (at least for you because I don't think hubby would read it.)  You can get it for super cheap on line used.<br>  <br>  Anyway, I wish the best with your relationship with your hubby and your friend!  Huge hugs to you!  = )|`|EZHZW7QFaa	I think he may has feelings for you....and listen, guys know what OTHER guys do when they go out. Your friend isn't stupid and i'm sorry to say that if your husband has been caught red-handed b4 only God knows what he DIDNT get caught with before that - and because you forgave him, he has probably dont more. Just being honest. I don't understand the compulsion of married men and women to "go out" - get real why do u think he's going out?? Hes flirting, mingling, and acting single. Especially if you have expressed to him that it makes you unhappy he still goes out? Cmon...you know what it is - you teach people how to treat you...once they get away w/ something they WILL continue. It's not fair to you. And as for your friend - he probably thinks your husband is annoying and doesn't think that he treats you the way you deserve and he knows you very well - and ya know whats funny i have no idea who you are but after reading this i don't think you're treated fairly either! Hope this helps....<3|`|NnN4drsbaa	Too long to read, but let me see if I get this. Your married, your husband not being attentive, his friend his, you like  hisfriend, his friend wants to get in your pants, you may have let him, now his friend aint showing you attention. Is this it?|`|TSmego9vaa	Maybe it is,you just dont want to accept it.You sound a little like me in my first marriage. The only way to find out is to follow your husband or have someone else. Think things through and use your head not your heart. =] good luck|`|egpVC6uMaa	I think you are a push over. Your friend is right...in a few yrs you might find out that your husband might have fathered other kids, but you will still stay with him. He does whatever he wants and you are ok with it, just to avoid a "fight"<br>  <br>  I would be frustrated too if I were your friend....and after a while, it would be really annoying talking to you and knowing that you are still with this looser. It seems like he likes you and is tired of hearing the same story about you and your so called husband.|`|yZ7vjv86aa	Sounds like this guy was trying to be a good friend to you.  He's heard you complain for years about your husband's behavior and how you allow him to push you around.  He hears from you the way your husband treats you and was hoping to show you how to stand up for yourself.  You have given him the details to form the opinion he has about your relationship, so that's how he figures it is as bad.  It's as bad as you describe it to him.<br>  <br>  You may think you're standing up for yourself, but something must be going wrong if the behavior doesn't change.  It could also be that he's tired of hearing you complain and make excuses (it's not that bad, he can't change) but not do anything to change the situation.<br>  <br>  I've had friends who have acted like this.  It's frustrating to hear someone only complain about something and never do anything to change it.  At some point, you have to step back and let the friend live in that situation.  I think your guy friend is at that point and that's why he's not talking to you.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|AA11108897	It sounds like your friend was trying to be a good friend, but feels his advice fell on deaf ears.  It does sound like you're being taken advantage of by your husband.  But it seems that he's the one you need to talk to.  Does he truly respect you?  Why does he feel the need to go out without you?  You've let him do it up to this point, but does it affect your relationship?  Are you truly equals in this relationship? It sounds like you need to worry more about your relationship with your husband than your friend right now.|`|b54d93db511477e3231a19a1adb0c354aa	oh honey! forgiving him and moving on was a good thing to do. however, you should have talked to him about it...your friend on the other hand...he obviously has feelings for you, and hates seeing you walked all over as he sees it...he does have a worse view of you and your husband's relationship bec of your venting. that, however is not your fault. i am the person everyone goes to for advice, and when they are venting, i have to take into account that they are angry when they are saying all this, and have to get the story again later when they cool down...you'll be fine...give it time...sit down and tell him how you feel.|`|07cdc5710ed692974b09c64c65058e4aaa	Your guy friend wants more from you... He is telling you and showing you that you & he should be together. He's tired of hearing your stories about your marriage, because it frustrates him that you are being treated (as he sees it) unfairly. If you are happy with your husband, then be happy with your husband.... this is the man who should be your BFF...|`|8txWayVnaa	Your friend has a different perspective on your relationship.  I would have to agree with your friend's prediction of 30 years down the line.  If you do indeed "go along to get along", then you will get everything you don't deserve.  A man is going to do what you allow him to do.  If you don't set boundaries (all in the name of "keeping the peace"), then you will get exactly what  you are getting.<br>  <br>  Your friend is concerned about you.  And, he's tired of hearing the same old sh*t about what's going on in your marriage, so he's keeping his distance.  Smart guy.
EZHZW7QFaa	Of course she knows!!! Don't walk around guilty forever! Mediums say it all the time that when they die they forgive and they are happy...she is a lot closer than you think..<br>  TRY THIS: Write a letter to her with everything you want to say, attach it to a helium balloon and send it up (make sure there are no trees around), it really helps watching the balloon go so high you can't see it anymore, it really makes you feel like it will go to her in heaven... it helped me a long time ago. <3|`|3d7bf3496a4dad494fcd0f1a09403acdaa	Ummm.  She is dead, so I would imagine the answer is no.  Maybe if you have religious delusions such as Christianity, then you can ask her when you are in "Heaven".  Take it from me though, move on with your life and don't concern yourself with what she thought.  She is not around to care anyhow.|`|9CoaKELzaa	Death is, unfortunately, a part of life.  It's very sad that your friend lost her life in a car accident.  Whether or not your friend is able to recognize that you apologized and that you miss her is anyone's guess.  If I were you I would use this as a learning experience.  You now know what it feels like when you "push someone" aside.  Maybe you can use this experience to go out of your way to treat others with respect or to appreciate the things and people you do have.  I bet your friend would be most satisfied if she knew you learned from past mistakes and bettered yourself because of them!|`|ANKJdJgxaa	If your sincere about it, then she'll know|`|7fh3JCVxaa	dont feel guilty about the way you were. she wouldnt have stuck with you if she didnt like your company. <br>  after someone dies, the people left behind often feel guilty and regretfull but all you can do is try to move on, because most likely you have done nothing really wrong, all best friends push each other away sometimes, and im sure she'll remember all the good times you had, the times that made you best friends.
TR5ntsavaa	No, she's not crazy. This might not be what you want to hear, but if I were in either girl's shoes, I wouldn't keep waiting for you. I'd just leave. If you told her you were going to leave your girlfriend, then yes, she probably expected you to dump her. She's not trying to send you hints, she's told you flat-out what she wants. You're just refusing to see it. Of course she's unhappy, and your girlfriend probably is, too, as it sounds like she knows what's going on. Pick a girl and stop cheating. It'll be better for all of you.|`|dsf5hGGnaa	You are just a prize.|`|FMP3BtSoaa	It sounds pretty clear to me. What don't you get? She wants to be in a real serious relationship and doesn't want to be a booty call. And yeah, she probably is hoping you're going to leave your gf for her. I was the "girl on the side" for years with this guy I was madly in love with. If you care for her at all and have no intentions of really being with her, do her a favor and break it off.|`|PdBG8JvRaa	First of all..if you are claiming that you have a g/f  then you are not single and should not have anything on the side. Keep the g/f, dump the weirdo on the side. She is trying to get you to feel sorry for her. If you were my b/f would it be fair to say I was single...hmmmm. Good Luck|`|XIH2oKtJaa	i hate people like you|`|TcMa4a7paa	Shame on you for putting her in that situation.  Shame on you for lying to your girlfriend.  Leave her alone.  So what if she cries herself to sleep... You are the one that caused her to feel that way!  She will cry, get over you, and then move on like she deserves to do. You should not continue to hurt her anymore, so leave her alone and cut off commuication with her.  If you can't be faithful, then you should just date around and not have girlfriends.

8AOgHjH0aa	oh my god is that Hayley that used to live in Brooklyn? I met her the other day, shes such a nice wee lass.|`|U9vE47hdaa	ummm... no. why? you like her? i might be able to find her for you.|`|ZzEAc5ecaa	sorry mate .. but i only hope you find her good luck|`|llEdx8Q2aa	Nope sorry.|`|haExfFegaa	No but i do know a Hayley, 20 years old, lives in Texas and went to Australia last summer!!|`|7tyRW6oIaa	i do not. are you trying to find someone? you should google her. or go on one of those websites that says their last known location where they live. unfortunately, i forgot the name of the site, but im sure theres many of them =]|`|DSp6zjeGaa	NO sorry|`|0ucPv5MJaa	No but if I meet them I will let you know.|`|04A7by3Naa	Good luck.|`|M4nXH7DTaa	sorry i live in WI but i wish i was in CA|`|8CZiBaxgaa	YEH I DO!              Oh sorry she went to sweden|`|pqAYtrHVaa	I know this doesn't help either, but all you who say "No, sorry"- don't bother. It doesn't help.|`|BsPVa8Kqaa	Lol! Good try though.    Try finding her on myspace or facebook.|`|9fAHd15Caa	no but i can see why she didn't contact you after reading your answer about that guy Brian wanting to attract some girl more|`|AA11293866	Sorry, I dont know anyone by that name. But I hope you find who you are looking for.|`|WHMcHlDDaa	im sorry but i dont...i hope you find out though! good luck!|`|Ugli5Tvwaa	Nope sorry|`|MOD9Poozaa	here i am honey. are you rich
JRpD7Yu5aa	Depends where you are. If you are both over 16, and consensual, I'm pretty sure its a go. (Unless you happen to live in some ************ super religious community) Remember to use protection!|`|8JiTyw2Paa	have a good time, if you know what i mean|`|rGWiOVDIaa	It's legal. But if you waited so long, whats 2 more years? At that point it would seem worth it to just wait to marry.    Having sex isn't going to pull her out of depression. Find out why she is sad and fix that. It will just make things more complicated and probably worse.|`|Kh9Wzrhyaa	As long as you are emotionally prepared for sex and you are mature enough to understand that your relationship will be forever changed, then proceed. You need to be responsible and that includes securing birth control and acknowledging the fact your actions could result in an unwanted pregnancy. I don't believe the law prohibits underage sex provided it is consensual and both parties are underage. Although, it most likely differs from state to state. Proceed cautiously.|`|AXjTE1rRaa	haha no bro it's not      go 4 it u will enjoy|`|8d2dafa2e677fbcd1bf84bcf3389e331aa	It is legal for you two to make love. But please remember to use protection. Your girlfriend getting on the Pill would be a good idea as well.|`|Vy4rH01baa	you only need to worry if one of you is over 18.|`|9gvxaYyNaa	go for it my boy have some fun ;)|`|HUd6mixfaa	I guess it depends on where in the world you are.  I'm not going to say not to do it, but think about it, what if something we're to happen and you 2 break up, this will hurt her a lot, showing her she's special would be waiting for marriage, cause you want her enough to marry her and be with her forever.    just google where you are and laws. lol|`|ckjZnqHRaa	....it's technically illegal..but not in all states actually..check with your local restrictions and laws I suppose.  It's only gonna be illegal if you get caught otherwise....  ..a pregnancy will get you caught BTW!!!...just thought you should know.|`|PducgYm5aa	Yeah Man Not Sexual Intercourse Though|`|uJ9waJDYaa	It is illegal, just talk to her and say  "i want to make love to you, but its not legal and you know how strongly i feel about you without doing this together for at least another year"  anyway, it is not at all legal but there are so many people under 17 who  do have sex, and well a large majority or them regret it or cant deal with the consequences of 'accidents' because they are young, that's why there are the laws to not have people usually under 18 or 16 to have sex, because its to protect them..but i mean i suppose you cant get arrested unless you walk into a police station and say hey me and my girlfriend are having underage sex, should you arrest us?  anyway, do what you feel is right but make sure she knows that you and her don't have to make love right now just to show how much you do love each other. Embrace your relationship for how it is now, if you have been together for this long chances are you will be together for many more years than that to come, so theres no rush, and you may one day look back on the days when you hadn't made Love and think what were things like then...more spontaneous, mysterious, exciting.  Any way, there is no rush. good luck|`|Z2gHpT8paa	no don't listen to anyone on here seriously don't do ANYTHING as in engage in intercourse till later on, i am also a sophomore and my best friend was on the pill and used protection and she is pregnant and can't stand her life, please don't my friend wish she would have chose the other option to not have intercourse so if you really love your girlfriend pass on my story to her. PLEASE DON'T DO IT!!!!!|`|RhGjyGxPaa	Unless you've been held back, you got together when you were 8. Yea right. So you're 15 or 16 now. Don't you understand? A condom doesn't work the best. If your girl gets pregnant, you'll be one of the very embarrassed couples out there. She can claim she was raped, you know. She might not be looking for the personality anymore, you know, no matter how dedicated you and her were. She might just realize how important she is to you. She probably realizes you want to satisfy her. Be careful. Just wait 2 or 3 years, so you can marry first.|`|Vhq3GURQaa	Well, if you are both underage no one can be charged with breaking a law..I am concerned that you say she is depressed that you don't want to. She should understand that you do want to and respect any wishes you have to wait. If you do not feel ready- don't do it. Wait. I think maybe she is listening to her girlfriends who probably are sexually active. That is not a good reason to make love.|`|AA11185479	Legally, no.  Neither of you are at the age of consent yet (this law varies by state, so check your local laws).  It would be similar to an adult having intercourse while drunk or drugged - they are not capable of giving consent.  Wait until you are both 16, at the very least.    It's wonderful that you love her, but that doesn't mean you're ready for sex.  You have to consider the possible consequences, and be prepared for that.  It's a lot more than just snapping on a condom.  If you can't speak candidly with your partner and your doctor about pregnancy, protection, and STDs, then you're not ready.      Have an honest talk with your girlfriend.  Let her know how much you love her and want to make love with her, but that you want to be absolutely sure this is the best time for both of you.  Discuss the hard question - what would you do if the condom breaks and she gets pregnant?  What would you do if one of you unwittingly shares an STD?  Is she willing to go on the pill in addition to your condom?  What will you tell your parents?  Don't assume that nothing bad will happen to you - that's naivety and arrogance.  Prepare for the worst, hope for the best.    Also, be honest with her parents.  They are trusting you with their child's safety and well-being, so you should be honest with them about your intentions.|`|WN6tWLdYaa	haha no not at all. but your really young and maybe you should talk to her and tell her that you both should wait a year or so........it will be worth the wait. show her love in other ways and take her out more.|`|FViagGVEaa	Yes, two underage people can have sex as long as there is less than a three year difference in age (in most states)|`|MzSFaebraa	Completely legal|`|P9oduCUgaa	yeah|`|cYRZpGkqaa	yes|`|Ehyzno5Faa	yeah both underage they cant do anything....    go get some!|`|rJq8TxHGaa	Depends on the state. I think the age of consent is 16 or 17 in most states.|`|GVlzdZKsaa	How old are you?
f7e207bacb96e05453dd798123720f46aa	Yes he would definitely know, but I really don't think you should bring it up.  It isn't like you did it on purpose and it is natural for him to get turned on, there is nothing to apologize for and you will likely embarrass him if you do.  Just let it alone.  I commend you for being committed Christians that do not have sex.  Just take it easy on him and don't embarrass the poor guy!|`|JQA1mnGfaa	If you were to say a physical reaction to me, I would think you meant you thought I physically reacting to it, meaning I was crying or something. lol But i'm just stupid anyway, lol.|`|2esGKO2Caa	Just tell him Straight up It will be okay!|`|8JiTyw2Paa	he wants you!
7VSGyWCPaa	yea i actually do. i think every f'ed up thing i did when i was younger is coming back now. lost a girl that i truly loved and loved me. and its like almost every chick i talk to now is playing games. what goes around comes around i guess.|`|SyHmExgtaa	YES YES YES I do and please believe it's a nasty b***h!!!!!!!!!!!|`|Rb087BsAaa	Yes...what goes around comes around.    I've been there and its a *****.|`|FWsv3Schaa	you did nothing wrong and YES i believe in karma. the beginning of this month this guy i was kinda with not really kissed this other girl in his grade. 3 weeks later and the b*tch is in bed with mono|`|ekRtrUnIaa	yess karma is a b***h  and i believe in it|`|GGfLLgkXaa	Haha, I do.  What goes around comes around.
3je7nsJYaa	ok calm down obviously you are worried about your friend. now there are a few things you can do depending on how bad the stituation is. <br>  1. talk to your friend and get her to talk to her paretns<br>  2. convince your friend to tell someone, teacher, other family member<br>  3. if it is getting really bad and your friend is tyring to kill herself then tell somone yourself someone you can trust, maybe ask your parents.<br>  good luck|`|SWz7ElbFaa	I would agree with 2) and 3) from above. telling a teacher or a trusted one will normally result in it being sorted but if she confronts her parents they could get angrier. <br>  <br>  Good luck x

AA10726533	Women are more emotionally involved in others, It isn't as much about the physical desires as it is with men. I mean, yes there may be a stranger that you may see and be attracted to, but I wouldn't fantasize about them. Women are a lot more complicated when it comes to sexual pleasure and  being attractive isn't all that does it for us.   Some may think differently, that's only my personal opinion. :)|`|XAw4cJmjaa	Some females fear that if we admit that we find another guy attractive then our s/o will think that we are or will cheat.  Another reason can be that when females are 100% attached to a guy, then in our minds no one else is attractive.  Good luck figuring that one out!|`|AA11946390	I think that usually if the woman is in a happy and committed relationship that she more than likely only fantasizes about her s/o. If she was going to fantasize about anyone else, it would probably be one of her ex-boyfriends before she fantasized about a stranger.|`|5UKw5D33aa	Because men are less acceptant of this. guys are territorial.|`|bbbf3755af9f136a17c38ee61766a578aa	for me i get fantasies but its rarely ever about a stranger and that is when im single. when i am taken i fantasize and get only emotional about my boyfriend and what desires i want to full fill with him. with previous boyfriends i would get  fantasies about them but had my moments of getting horny at other people but that was because i didn't love my previous boyfriends it was just infatuation and they got turned on by me talking about my fantasies. i was open with them about my desires that or i would hide it. i wouldn't completely lye to them. i loved them at the time so i want to give them my heart. it just depends on the girl of what she want to lye , hide or tell her fantasies to the guy or not.|`|W4C5p8qOaa	When in a relationship, many women don't think about anyone other than their partner in a sexual way. They're so besotted/mad about their other half that 'fantasies' don't even cross their mind.|`|U9vE47hdaa	they don't always lie. but they always do hide their true feelings.|`|WN6tWLdYaa	well they just dont want there boyfriend to get jealous and get mad at them but it is completely normal for women to be attracted to another stranger and that is okay if they do. they still like you. some women may fantacize  some attractive guy but that doesnt mean they dont like you still. it isnt really anything to worry about.|`|VEi3R0craa	I personally don't fantasize about being with other man but I don't have a problem saying someone is attractive.  I am married and my husband knows I love me some Lyfe Jennings and He loves Serena Williams.  But I guess that was us.|`|JlDcVTVsaa	I really love my husband, and its not a lie that i really cant see myself with any one except him. to me he is the most handsome, loving caring guy in the world.  and also sexiest ofcourse.|`|x88DfLokaa	yeah i agree.. its probably different for all women some may fantazie about the other people.. but somtimes they dont and sometimes they do.. hahah i feel like that makes no sense.. i know when im with someone ive wanted them so theres no fantasizing for me|`|2VHoLAkHaa	well some girls are whores and will cheat on there s/o but some of the other girls who said that prolly where telling the truth because it all depends on how happy you are with your s/o because i love mine to death and couldn't imagine cheating on him but in the past i have been with people who i didn't give to shits about and did look at other guys so i guess it all depends on you and how much you live your s/o
qZPL6PSVaa	It is a combination: symmetry of facial features as well as appearance (has to have stunning good looks), tending more towards "V" shape (broader shoulders, bigger in chest narrowing down thru waist in the torso, very proportionate all over, very beefy, Also attracted to a sexy stagger, the way they hold themselves. Well, that is my ideal anyway but my hun is not too far off the mark from that description either so i guess i kinda got what i was attracted to. =P|`|HMhUKAgkaa	Physically, I'm more attracted to facial features than any other part of their body. Especially the eyes. My ex was fat but his eyes were hypnotic. That's what got me! The man I married has amazing eyes as well but he also has a nice body.|`|DZB0WCmmaa	trim hips... and average body stature, i hate too much muscles, it looks unnatural and.. blee.

I think you've made a mistake somewhere.|`|J30kfJpQaa	It doesn't matter, because being attracted to someone because of their looks is shallow. I like someone based on common interests.

u2rDNTPEaa	it's a real toss up for me between 2 and 3. I love that 2 lives a nice humble life and that he's a dog/football loving teacher. I have a thing for nerdier guys, though, which is why 3 is such a draw. He's tall, quirky, and loyal which are also major plusses forme. in the end, it's about who i had the most connection with and on paper, i cannot make that call.|`|eXDepNHZaa	i say 3, 1 then 2. sunglasses on your head all the time? hahha lame.but yeah its a tough decision between 3 and 1. they all sound good though, good luck!|`|2tnFQYhEaa	It's a tie between 1 and 3 and then 2.|`|2c88J3M7aa	1 =)|`|f7e207bacb96e05453dd798123720f46aa	Not even close,  3.  Number one is a loser and isnt even on his own.  Number two sounds like a loser too, but only he doesn't realize it and thinks he is cool in his high school world.  3 is going to make something of himself and is probably a good guy.|`|Kh9Wzrhyaa	I find it interesting that you trust your instincts so much as to illicit the advice of complete strangers to make a decision on which of three suitors you are to date. If we choose door number three will you pick him? Basically, you need to make the decision based on how you feel while you are with them, provided you have met them. Chemistry is important early on in the dating process. You seem to be viewing them as more than potential dates and more as potential husbands. A bit premature don't you think? You are doing this by presenting their dating resumes. Seriously, trust your instinct.|`|bbbf3755af9f136a17c38ee61766a578aa	honestly i wouldnt choose any of them.  1 living at home.  2 a jock    3 rich parents and too brainy. i would rather choose a little bit from each of them.      1loves to travel and has a friendly personality and is shy. i love that he loves to visit new place and it is so cute when a guy is shy.   2 i love that he has a dog, is out going and is very active. i like someone that will keep up with me and loves animals.   3 i love that he is careful with his money and uses it wisely and can dress up nice, is loyal and has sense of humor. i love someone that can make me laugh.|`|acdf2a2c14fccbe7a3badc5fa8d3abe1aa	in the order that I would choose: 2 (not sure what Oakleys are though), 1, 3.  T|`|rtk02g0gaa	i would deff pick the 2nd one!!  that would be the best choice!!!!|`|EFpoaZBoaa	i cant decide between 1 and 2, i love guys who r shy but i also love a sense of humour, Whether they are very intelligent or handsome doesnt matter 2 me though, they both sound gr8|`|Byz59nRGaa	I'd  pick number 2 since he seems to be most confident with what he is doing in life and does what he likes. He stands on his own two feet, he's not worried about an imaginary bar to reach, this leaves him free to spend time on his relationships.  He also has a dog and this proves that he can be considerate of other, take care of them and can love deeply.  The others will always feel as if they have "bears" running after them, trying to meet others expectations.  No. 2 is his his own man and knows what he wants and does or goes after it and doesn't answer to anyone.  He's not going through life with baggage.  Take Care, Love yourself and be Happy!
epIsDqM4aa	Yes I do then we could cry on eachothers shoulders then eat ice cream, thats what friends are for. *hugs you* It will be okay.|`|OI29tkSoaa	Yes it is always good to know other people :)|`|6487bd61ef059cac042d49119a814a4aaa	"Knew" in the biblical sense?   Yes, I think I would like to know you that way.|`|ccb402364f76559985af31b2ece8e3ccaa	aw yes because then i would try to make you feel better!!! i'm sorry...|`|5UKw5D33aa	You better go get yo man from that heffa
RLXP4kwnaa	yes, go for it. your really cute (ive seen your pics) but dont come on to strong. try, "hey, so I was thinkin that maybe we could chill sometime. just you and me." she'll most likely say something like, "(smiling) sure, that sounds cool." after she says yes, your in. then you have to tell me all about it. okay.    WooHoo... Rock ON lover boy! ; )   XOXO ~Tayna~|`|ziU8msf0aa	go for it, but seems to me you might be in the "friends zone"|`|EgLTmiTjaa	step up to the plate|`|4HnLVepsaa	id give it  a bit of time.... she might b flirting with you more to get back at her bf. id let her settle back down and then tell her, its to soon atm.      make sure u support her loads through this time that way shell love you even more. trust me i no|`|nVFjNbnLaa	I think you should ask her out, for sure.  Put your man pants on big boy, it's time to grow up.|`|lqZKXXTCaa	Yes, ask her out.  If you don't ask her out you will regret it for awhile.  Life is short, and your youth will be gone before you know it.  If she says no, at least you tried and that is all you can do.  My 2 cents.|`|t7mwa7U6aa	Its seems to me like its a perfect time to do it! And its been prov-en that like 95% percent of situations with girls are less awkward if you just go for it and do it 100% confidently! Ask her to hang out and be as flirty as possible and if you can tell shes enjoying it then just tell her that you've really enjoyed all the times you've spent with her and you want her to be your girlfriend simple as that! Don't be shy. And most importantly DON'T THINK ABOUT IT!  when your hanging out with her just relax don't think about the things that can go wrong! you can do this and good luck :)|`|YtSGbYqEaa	i say go for it you might lose your chance if you wait to long say whats in your heart and just be real with her she sound pretty cool just don't get scared you'll be fine and if it doesn't turn out the way you want it to then just shake it off it wont be the end of the world but don't blow the chance to tell her how you feel you don't want to miss out good luck|`|AU4LAtqMaa	just tell her.|`|dIw1112Zaa	You should be honest and just tell her you like her.|`|nLFr9csfaa	I guess women can be confusing....trying to distinguish if we want to be just friends or more. I think you should just come right out and ask her. If no then continue being her friend. If yes which I'm thinking she's going to say then good for you|`|gk61uhtfaa	this happened to me befor also but i made a big mistake becaus when i asked her out she said she just wants to be friends. I think you can get a relly close friend u trust to find out for u, or try to find out if she likes u lik play truth or dare or something and then try askin her out.
AVzQs5Uhaa	well sorry to say but it sounds like its your friend who has the problem and issues not her bf. I am pretty sure she knew these things before dating him so why is she continuing. I know it sucks to say it but I'd tell her to put up or shut up, basically if you don't like it leave and if you don't leave then stop complaining. No one like someone who constantly complains about something that they have control over. She sounds to me like she is very spoiled and nothing would ever make her happy.She should be happy that he is taking responsibility for his child and not being a dead beat dad, also what are her living conditions and life style  if she is in school, does she live at home ,does she have a job, etc, who pays for her things and entertainment? She may not want to hear it but that's what real friends do they tell you the truth whether you want to hear it or not. It sounds like shes not breaking up with him because hes a fall back plan, as in like hes there when she wants to do something if you  understand what i mean by that. I know it sucks to say it but your friend sounds very self absorbed and like everything is about her, if shes dating someone who has a child she should know that ,that child always comes first no matter if your married,dating or single.|`|tXFj8oSfaa	didn't you just ask this question a couple minutes ago.

ExluLxQyaa	It's your scarf - if you want it back, just say hey give me back my scarf and that's that.  Don't have to think about it and analyze it.
CEqYjcBeaa	That is a hard situation. I would say generally that if after 5 years the other person isnt ready to make the commitment to get married and you are, then it would probably be best to move on. The house situation is another one that would speak the same truth. Buying a house on his own is one thing, but to do it with no consideration towards you and far away to where you guys are that limited in time...well sounds to me like he is trying to get his distance in. Maybe your best bet would be to part for a few months, do your own thing and if its meant to be then you two will end up back together.|`|mimykKnhaa	Sounds like he is afraid of commitment. I have been with my bf for 6 years, and we just got engaged. About a year ago we bought a condo together (will be ready in 3 years), and he wouldn't do it without my input. I think it will hurt, but you deserve to find someone who will not be afraid to take that next step.|`|WCkOUF9aaa	Talk to him and if he dosent want a future with you either shut up and take it or find someone that will treat you the way you want|`|AA11328507	I think he has plans that do not include making you his wife...ONLY you can decide if you wanna stick around.

That's real creepy and highly scarey.|`|fdSolQ0Aaa	Obvious troll is obvious.
JJUZFvggaa	Well that is a tough one. Have you talked to your wife about how her mom is and how you feel when around her? Does she also agree with you? If you answered yes to these questions then I ask your wife if she like company or would like to go alone? Have you ever thought that she ask you to come to help her deal with a mom who wasn't a great mom to your wife as just support for her?<br>  <br>  I personally don't ask my hubby to visit with my family (if I am just going over to see them just because) He more then welcomed to go but not made to go. Family functions are totally different story. How ever I am not required to go with him either (My In-laws are nuts and I don't deal well stupid people). Thankfully he has come to reasoning that family is great and distance is the key to keeping it that way. <br>  <br>  I would talk to your wife about her mom moving in with you guys. We talked about this recently my in laws made the comment of when they retire there going to live with each kid for 4 months at a time. I put my foot down we don't have a large home to support that many people, and even of we did I would not listen to there stupidity in my home, and deal with trying to be nice to people who are not nice to me. <br>  <br>  I would explain family always cause conflict (small or large issues) with a marriage and having it in your face daily will not make it better. Try to find a place for your MIL that will be able to help her and try to be a nice as you can to help your wife deal with all the drama.|`|nCWjdyddaa	First of all, although you have a responsibility to do what you reasonably can for your MIL, you do not have to let her live with you. There are resources which you can help her find so that she won't end up on the street. <br>  <br>  Secondly, I understand how hard it is to watch a family member go through something like this. But, if it were you, would you want your family to make it worse by just disappearing? She needs some emotional support, and some help to get through this. Talk to your wife. If she needs you to go with her, then that is what you should do. If she says she can manage without you, then let her go alone SOME of the time. Do not abandon her to handle this alone; that is not what a loving spouse does.
iaMBgc6iaa	Ok, I think its different for everyone. But for me, if she strokes me for a long time and it isn't doing the trick, it starts to hurt.....most of the time. After I get off, and she keeps going it hurts. But again thats just me. Best to do is ask. My girl asked and I told her...nothing to be ashamed of|`|H6tfjz8Saa	well, after your giving the hand job, if it hurts, just put your mouth on it, then he'll feel all better|`|s4vZ2zRSaa	if you do it for too long and he still hasnt came then it might hurt him a little. happened to my ex, he was sore for a week lol|`|tAygJFiTaa	lol no its just like soooo tingly its hard to handle lol and im super strong down there lol|`|FYdKoA4Paa	maybe, without lotion. but if it does you could kiss it and make it feel better.|`|8qVkSA4jaa	He'll be really sensitive down there after he comes.|`|TsKD2HX4aa	No you won't hurt him.  Sometimes after you come, you get a little more sensibility, but definitely it doesn't hurt that bad to ask to stop doing it.  Just don't grab it too hard, be gentle.    Good luck|`|ag4WG3wQaa	When it starts to hurt he'll tell you. Only thing with keep going after he comes you'll work it back up but after a while his balls will hurt.|`|bcab7e2824c9dc2b7643bdff851f90baaa	No no it wont hurt unless you are grabbing too hard or not being sensitive enough after he cums. After he cums, it is very sensitive and when i touch it after my boyfriend cums, he says it tickles.|`|87sj8YBGaa	Well, it depends on if you're using lubrication or not.  If no, then yes, he will probably get something like rug burns down there from all of the friction.  But if you are using some sort of lubricant, then as long as you keep your hand and your "target" lubed up, then you should be fine for a LONG time.  Your hand would likely get tired before any injury occurs.  But make sure that your man is okay with you doing that for an extended period of time after he's done, as all guys are different in their interests.|`|BopBYwSdaa	it won't hurt him  you have a sore arms and dry rough hands, lol|`|AZTNUH08aa	only if you try to rip it off will it hurt.  I know that from personal experience, and i was sore for days|`|GVlzdZKsaa	Ask him.|`|MHwn4Tlzaa	there will be a point when he goes soft that you can't go anymore.  that's the time to stop although he might want you to just slow down after he goes off.|`|ckjZnqHRaa	..keep some water based lube close by sweetie.....without it eventually things will get scary!
IHwMbLX5aa	If he asked if you just wanted to be friends? Maybe your not giving him enough attention. Or maybe he is looking for a way out without looking like the bad guy. Either way, I'd give him the boots. :P|`|auoLiBaGaa	I'd be kind of mad because who cares what other people think? Who cares if people ask if you're going out or if it doesn't look like it? You know you are, he knows he is, so what's the problem? I think that this guy needs to ignore wehat people think. If this guy and this girl like each other, they should stay together. Or talk about what's going on before they stay "just friends".|`|rMb4vyOuaa	tell him  if you really loved me you wouldn't care what other people say
tyGPEuBCaa	I had this to happen to me before but you no what i did i let her do her do her cause i guess this guy is more important than our friendship.|`|SWz7ElbFaa	I would confront her and ask her why she is doing it. Many people when they get into relationships can lose their friends but they are always an important aspect of life. <br>  <br>  Tell her that she is ignoring u and other friends and you want to know where you stand. <br>  <br>  good luck|`|CqdCQeOdaa	Let her do her own thing, when they break up, dont be so quick to let her back in. Then she'll realize what she has done.|`|oOqSpBmbaa	Wow I went through a summer of this. Just leave it be is my advice. I didn't and.. oh good lord!|`|yyIVrngcaa	forget her...if she wants to neglect her friendships for her relationships...who wants a friend like that?
ygimTNzoaa	LOL at first I thought you were talking about after he cuts his toenails at night hell grab them sit next to you like a kid and poke you with them. I was thinking what the hell? But I saw some answers and got the question. <br>  <br>  Yes my fiance's nails grow super fast, say within a week and a half they're getting rediculous. If he scratches me at night I tell him he needs to cut them again, and if he forgets, when he gets home from work the next day or whenever we sit on the couch next I hand him the clippers and say CLIP EM! Ha, it's for your safety!|`|ByUS0k8waa	Make sure they cut the claws and make them wear socks all night.|`|8tJPK69iaa	Tell him to clip his toe nails.|`|u1uECuFNaa	Cut them...and yes, he does.|`|GdBjTovfaa	yuck yes! take him for a pedi, i took my husband and he loved it, i had to trick him into it telling him i hear that men get woodies from it , i told him he would need a smoke after he had it done, anyway no woodie but he loved it so did i .. the only other thing you can do is sleep with long pants and combat boots.. and husbands like a nice nude body next to them so tell him the choice is his!|`|Deb4iqbvaa	Tell the spouse you have booked a special couple's spa day, and be sure that a pedicure is included for him/her. Then buy some toasty (and thick!) socks to "keep the feet warm" at night. And leave the toenail clippers in plain sight in the bathroom!|`|jzpKHdjsaa	How about trim the nails, or ask them to wear socks.|`|rqwXqmyTaa	Tell him to trim them..or her.  If they don't want to for some odd reason, then tell them to wear socks.|`|4DDSD9Syaa	trim the claws|`|FyuUzSHbaa	kick him out|`|AYfJWQuTaa	I give my man a relaxing pedicure, including massaging up to the knee! lovely feet, nearly as perfect as mine, just less the nail polish! LOL|`|2f2338425d995c6d00e32cb38d57ee7faa	No one has ever stabbed me with toenails, I've never even thought of that. Maybe it's because I've always slept under a separate blanket - just something I prefer. Nowadays, it wouldn't be an issue anyway, as my husband and I each have our own bedroom.
52zR9SHDaa	As an essay is a bit pathetic. As for the mate in my days somebody like her would have been sent to Coventry.
PdBmOPI2aa	Not racy, but very strange,|`|OIiwMWEVaa	... uh...|`|D4gixVFyaa	umm wow|`|vIiG3NILaa	UM.. yes. and it actually sounds like a great plot for a porn. Ha ha. if there was such a thing as a good plot in a porn.|`|tvWm1e4naa	yes|`|Kh9Wzrhyaa	Lay off the porn.|`|Grb85RJuaa	lol|`|YqoxcTN9aa	sorry i am not quite sure what you mean|`|196b73911133c4d75053bfa6ae887857aa	No it's actually quite.....nice?|`|pWO6Bu9Laa	wow dats quite interesting. hahahaa. dood u've got 2 be silly. but yeh uhm i'm not sure wut "racy" is either. & as far as 2 busty blondes wearing bikinis...well i'd have 2 c dat. lmao. wow, lesbo over here luvs porn. wth. but dis question literally made my dae cuz it was sooo random. but random is awesome. heyy dat kinda rhymes.|`|HNPOO56Raa	what
PTXFO6asaa	No, but he needs some space<br>  <br>  give it time
eO4y3m1maa	I don't think you should go out with him, your friend likes him and it could hurt your friendship. Take it as a compliment...and move on.. :)
165f72404d5b6cbc8f621fb7f48ae504aa	* If he wants to talk to you all the time.      * If he was acting like you're his friend but stopped doing embarrassing things in front of you,      * If you turn around and you catch him looking at you.      * If he starts acting nicer when you're around him.      * If he says "yes" to all the things you ask him to do.      * If he treats you differently than others.      * If he tries to sit next to you at work, in class, at lunch, or play on a team with you during Gym/Recess.      * If he looks at you a lot every time you smile or laugh.      * If you catch him sneaking a glance at you and he quickly turns away when he realizes that you saw him,and you see him blush.      * If he acts immaturely around you, like poking, teasing or playful flirting.      * If he seems to always want to hang out with you.      * If he gets closer with a body part, or if he tries to touch you (e.g. when you touch him he might touch you back).      * If you ask him for a pencil and he gives it to you, then you try and give it back and he says to keep it, there is a huge chance he might like you but be careful, he may know that you like him and he might be playing with your emotions!      * If you catch him peeking at you and he smiles turn around slowly and smile back playfully.      * if when your talking and you say that you have to go, if he says nite cutie or nite sweetie, then that might mean he likes you. If he says he misses you then he might like you.      * If he tries to make you laugh.      * If he tries to copy you.      * If he tries to keep you in view for as long as possible or tends to look around and stop when he finds you.      * If he subtly looks at you but makes it look like he is looking at the girl next to him.      * If he's immature he will act different around you, quiet and maybe even try to avoid you. Or, he'll act different around you than when he's just with his friends.      * If he constantly calls you and uses an excuse -such as What was the homework?      * If he goes out of his way to talk to you (e.g. if he goes to the other side of your school to talk to you because he knows you have a class there).      * If you see him staring at something by turning his head 90 degrees and when you look at him he smiles and turns away, when this happens, check his pupils, he might have actually been staring at you.      * If he invites you to a party.      * If you flirt with a friend of his when he can see, and he looks jealous or automatically flirts back, (but don't flirt with them just to find out if he likes you).      * If he talks to you and wants to know how you're doing.      * If he is nicer or tries to talk to your friends.      * If he asks about you to your friends when you're not around.      * If he asks you to dance with him at the dance. Note: He may be trying to be nice because he thinks you like him.      * If he walks past you and tries to look cool so you can glance at him.      * If a guy tries to show you things he got that are somewhat expensive (e.g. a cellphone) or he tries to impress you.      * If you notice when he gets out of class and starts to walk a little slower than usual, then he's trying to give you the opportunity to talk to him!      * If he always talks to you there's a great chance that he likes you.      * If he feels so awful letting you down that he lies.      * If he would do anything to spend more time talking to you (e.g. if he talks/texts/IM's you until midnight).      * If you realize that he ignores you when you're looking but when you look out of the corner of your eye, he turns back around to look back at you.      * If he's talking to his friends and nodding like he's paying attention but you realize he's not, he's actually been staring at you the whole time!      * If he walks down the hallway (at school) and he "accidentally" bumps/touches you, if he moves your chair or pulls your hair etc.      * If he ignores you almost completely. For example, when you call his name he does nothing, but when your friend does, he pays attention. This is because he might be embarrassed or not sure how to approach you. Be careful, though, he might ignore because he just flat-out doesn't like you!|`|Z8Gzb331aa	I think he does. Being as he asked you those "deep" questions, and also texting each other all night is a pretty big sign. :)|`|WVvn8aSCaa	Yeah.|`|cvl5GPzeaa	i think this guy is giving mixed signs.|`|prt4IU7Raa	Be careful, he might like you, but he might just be getting to know you and trying to get a new friend.  However, maybe he really does like you and he's just being very blatant!  From personal experience, boys are a bit clumsy with the way they talk to girls, not showing their true feelings. I was suckered in by this one boy i really liked and he was texting me asking questions like that, and then he started going out with my best friend, Eloise.  So watch out! Hopefully, you're in luck!|`|Wyo7r8VGaa	ya he is defiantly into you,try talking about another possible boyfriend around him and see how reacts.
QIwhMrBraa	he likes u and he's jealous u mite be texting the competition. keep him guessing. enjoy the chase.|`|kjgonYlgaa	I get extra curious about things that people try to keep a secret.  some might say I'm nosey but it's kinda more like a game to me.  He also may just be looking for something to say to get conversation going.  I think you're reading to far into this.|`|G64z6K1naa	Guys are stupid like that they get paranoid at the slightest things<br>  but think about it,, so do we.<br>  Maybe he likes you so hes worried you might become unavailable, just keep getting to know him and see how things go<br>  If he keeps doing it, hes not worth it!<br>  <br>  *Good Luck*|`|IgEYfBPJaa	he was just wundering, it was something he could say to you,he was just curious is all,  i think :)|`|UhnetgNkaa	maybe he was trying to annoy you seeing as he smiled afterwards.|`|2c7869fbf2bfda8e590501ddb5545f2caa	He is keen :)|`|hKOc2i8maa	Guys dont like that......|`|1aZ3QkAoaa	i'm not gonna read all that, but i guess guys get easily jealous and paranoid about other guys|`|v398Qalyaa	he wonders if you have a boyfriend because he likes you|`|2fsghqKoaa	maybe he was trying to see if it was another guy...<br>  <br>  i think by asking him so many times why he wanted to know he might have just thought it was some one you're seeing...<br>  <br>  and if you don't know him that well why do you like him?|`|8DN2jyRsaa	sounds like hes very possessive,and insecure,if i met a woman that was like that,i'd be friends but very reluctant to take it further|`|AA10266072	He either likes you and he's jealous that you might be texting other guys.<br>  <br>  Or...<br>  <br>  He was just asking.  All of my friends ask me that all the time.|`|530fc5625af617fef3f442bfdc20f598aa	He probably asked just for something to say. I don't think he was really that interested in your text.|`|7fh3JCVxaa	he wants to know if youre dating or not, so he can maybe ask you out...x
VJZ8KXSjaa	I don't think I understand what you are saying, you insisted that he have sex with someone else? And you made him hot? I don't know what is going on here sorry. But if you don't want to have sex with him just tell him and if he gets mad tell him you need someone more supportive of your wishes. If he still doesn't stop then you should brace yourself for possibly breaking up with him because you don't deserve to be pressured into anything you don't feel comfortable doing. Good luck and maybe next time read your question before you submit it. Thanks|`|SWzTydgXaa	Break it nicely like "hey, im really really sorry, but I am not in mood.  I'll make it up to you later."|`|Uy8ntukjaa	Just be honest with him, sit down and talk about what you are comfortable doing and what you're not. If he can't handle it then he doesn't really care about you and he isn't worth the relationship. You should never have sex because you feel pressured and anyone who pressures you doesn't have your best interest in mind.|`|PyAxwuqWaa	if he reallly loves you then he will understand that your not reday |`|2QS8j9aOaa	Be honest and tell him you are not ready and for him to respect your opinion if he wants to be with you. If he is older be careful they will try to convince you, by telling you they love you and you are the only one and stuff like that to get what they want. Don't fall for a heated moment and regret it later. Good luck|`|AA11660242	Just say no. If he truly loves you, he'll understand. If you truly love him, you'll discipline him by not giving into his sexual desires since you're not ready.|`|aGno0HAwaa	Well just stay away from him. Tell him your friend is going to come to stay with you and refuse like say you have homework and stuffs like that. Good luck.|`|HSYGbCGNaa	tell him your on your period.    Say no and dont give in.    you sound to young.|`|nqylxY7Gaa	You should have been upfront and honest with him. Now if you led him on no matter what happens he might get upset. But if you don't want to have sex with him, then be honest about it and let him know. You don't have to do anything you don't want to.|`|bIMtnIcIaa	Hmmmm well you can tell him tht everything is not abt sex inna relationship...what counts more spending time with u huggling and going out or just ur vagina for one night? Seriously tlk ur side of the feelings is not right tht he wants to have sex for his stupid pleasures and gets mad at u for not wanting to have sex....think abt it ok?|`|ChfnKMmNaa	Tell him your not comfortable with it, and you wanna wait till the right moment with the right guy and maybe it will be him in a little while but for now you wanna wait.|`|Qha8g6aoaa	Maybe you shouldn't have set such high expectations with him........now you need to be completely honest with him.|`|XJW7Yx8faa	Just tell him that you wanna wait till you get married, and sex is something special not something that you just do it cause you want to.If he doesn't understand that just let him go. It's gonna hurt yes, but if he leaves that means he did not love you that much.
PjyP8yEiaa	My wedding will be at 5pm 03.14.09. However since our reception place is booked 5-11, we will be having most of our pictures taken before the ceremony. However, I am hoping the after pictures will still be bright enough to take about 5:45pm. If not I am guessing I may have to do them before which I would much rather not. Talk to your photographer and see what they suggest.|`|239548019a89f1b3358d72761eef3170aa	take engagement pictures and ask the photograper to include some with a long zoon to include the surroundings.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|88234fa7f47e6fd5bb301672de45093eaa	Well, the not wanting the groom to see you before the ceremony is a big problem.  That wasn't an issue for me, so we took all the posed family photos before the ceremony.  There was still a good hour of light left after the ceremony, so my husband and I took the photos of just the two of us after the ceremony while guests were at the cocktail hour.<br>  <br>  Either get the venue as early as possible on the hopes that there's still some daylight after the ceremony, or see if you can go back some other day for photos.|`|R7b150Iyaa	I feel the same way and have the same dilemma!  My fiance won't be seeing me before the ceremony, but by the time it is over it will be 7pm (in April) so I doubt there'll be much daylight left.  I'm hoping the photographer is skilled enough to give our pictures more light than they really have, to take great indoor pictures, and that maybe there'll be some daylight left (after daylight savings time and all that jazz) for us to take a few pics outside.<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck and congrats!
d7dCdGqBaa	it sounds like your a homophobic........you should get to know him and get over whatever hatred you have......|`|2QljKpwAaa	it sounds like you hate the gays and even possibly the black people.. kick him out.|`|61ezlFAaaa	I have gay friends worked with gay men (Ms Drag Queen 1983 he's my boy white man but reminds me of a black woman funny as hell) and I know when they get into their moods it can be worse than a woman on her period<br>  sit him down and tell him how you feel<br>  or move|`|an967apaaa	change ur room i no its silly
EDYETUNCaa	Yeah not all girls are like this. The type of girl you want as a friend are out there, and they usually think the same as you - but about guys.     Perhaps you need to frequent other places to try and find female friends, do you go to college? Try to get study groups together with both sexes, reiterate that you want to be friends with these girls also. Meet friends through other friends, join a gym, volunteer places, go to singles events where people are just going to get to know each other.      The places you go might dictate the types of girls you come in contact with. Also, if your an overly flirty or sexual guy (you may not realize your projecting this) perhaps these girls think you want them to be forward. They could just be misreading you.|`|U9vE47hdaa	i'll be your friend. some times, girls go through emotional changes and that almost always changes their out look on some, if not all, their male friends. i recently went through this change and lost a lot of friends because of it.|`|xgJbxZgfaa	tell your female friends u want nothing more than to be just friends with them, and that you're seeing/talking to someone- don't be leading them on in any way if u don't want anything serious with them. if they don't like it that's their problem. they weren't your friend if they can't understand that.|`|6BffDmjsaa	do u give them signals that they are even comfortable enugh to want to have benifits? i would never ask any of ma guy friends. u shoudl watch wat kind of females u hang with or want to be ur friend, dont even let them get int hte way of anything, dress normal dont show off to them n dont talk dirty even as a joke|`|8xnwZfZkaa	Girls are weird now a days. You jsut have to deal with them. I mean do you tempt them or something???
428cf24d5b79898d5b660291ffda96e1aa	Start going and seeing her more often, texting isnt just enough and its not going to help keep your relationship 'tight' your going to have to go out and create memories together to keep your relationship 'tight' b/c she will have those memories to hang on to. Take her to the movies, take her out to eat (at the nicest place you can afford) buy her presents every once in a while (just because)<br>  <br>  also give her space, she is 14 therefore she isnt thinking about marriage, kids, settling down or anything like that, so dont smother her to death!|`|AA11102015	Face to face contact is the key here. Is it because she got bored of texting, or is she worried about jacking up the cell bill?
NSTjLXXpaa	i know what you mean because i am a very determined person.. so i need sumone thats going be able to handle me... just keep saying the same thing to make him mad and then he'll burst and he will see the true side of hisself and wat you like... believe me i know it works e-mail me|`|Kh9Wzrhyaa	So, if I understand you correctly, you want your boyfriend to slap you around every once in while to show he "cares." You mention your childhood, is it safe to infer that you were physically abused by your father? If so, I urge you to get some therapy. That is not healthy and it speaks volumes about your sense of self that you need someone to abuse you to show they love you. Your boyfriend is a good guy and you are lucky to have him. Get the help you need so tyou can live a happy and healthy life.|`|4gZYucHMaa	Trust me--you can't make a man into something that isn't in him.

TPVvddHWaa	Who ever agreed to pay for the furniture is legally bound to full fill that obligation.    As your friend is the owner of the furniture then they can ask for it back. However, it may have been considered a gift.    There is no reason why both parties can not talk to one another, even if they have decided not to continue the relationship.     Very likely the fiance's mother will be only too pleased to have the item removed from her home.    Phone up and ask when it would be convenient to collect it.

You don't want to be the pregnant girl in school that everyone talks about do you?|`|AA10726533	I was only 15 when I first decided to let someone take advantage of my body. I was with the guy for about five months and my best friend had been having sex and I thought I cared about him so one night I just wanted  to. He was a very nice and sincere guy but I was not in love with him. I regret it because now I am 17, about to be 18, am a senior, and have already been with 8 guys. I use protection and am very safe but you still are not respecting your body. I let myself stoop down to a very low level and did not care about myself.   Now I'm with someone that I have not slept with and things are good. We are taking it slow, and I feel as if I am beginning to be my own person and slowly getting the respect that i lost back.|`|vKhZDRyoaa	Ok , if tell you , you will tell us ?

J30kfJpQaa	Wow you're a whore if you let him kiss and "touch" you, but you don't love him.    Therefore, find someone else you do love. Tell him the truth. And tell him to have respect for women and not treat you like an object since you have no feelings for each other. You're only 13 for crying out loud.    Your parents should touch you, by giving you a good spanking. See how you like that.|`|eSI9c4Ncaa	Don't worry about it, he probably didn't mean it. He's 13.|`|0fVtHNtmaa	He don't love you either. You're 13 gosh.|`|tzzYdnZKaa	You don't have to say it because he does and at 12 he doesn't really love you. He is just saying it.
64a4NB15aa	First of all what you have is an impassioned connection . you really like each other a great deal . Love is something that grows overtime . Love is one day realizing that what you are doing is not as important as the other person in your life . Love is compromise and tolerance . The only way to know if you both are under the same magical moon is to get your feet wet in the adventure that is togetherness. Take the chance , but with caution . Hold the ticket yourself and make sure he purchases a round trip ticket . That way at any time it becomes uncomfortable or there is no chemistry you make walk out dignity in tact .Never compromise your belief . Life is a gamble if you do not put your chips on the table you will never know if it is your number that comes round . step up to the pool , but never jump in until you know how deep it is . Take the chance , but hold the round trip ticket just in case . Never pass up the chance to know if that person is your one true heart . Go for it  > it is my wish that he is truly the one for your heart just step with caution .|`|DcP1Fa0xaa	yes|`|1Sl45kHMaa	Girl you take your risk if you really like this guy.

If you are under age 18, that's a definite no. Other than that, if you have checked out his story about being on a world tour as a skateboarder and he really is one and really is going on tour, then invite him to visit you for a safe date in a public place.    Sounds fishy to me but I guess you'll find out one way or another.|`|hNvILDqLaa	no you should not end it if he loves you he will become a christain but if he dont love you then he wont and if he dont then you should end it|`|uJ9waJDYaa	I think you should just wait, if there's something between you and him that is kind of 'meant to be' then you and him will come back together by august and the wait would have been worth it, then i think it would be good for you both to meet in person, maybe if going all the one from one to the Other is too much you could meet somewhere halfway and spend a few nights together, go do activities, hiking, site seeing, beach, lunch, etc..  then after that you will both know how you feel around each other in person and if you both want to move forward then you can meet up again at each others home towns and see where things go.  Remember its easy for people to say what they have and haven't done when they aren't in a proper relationship with someone, so don't fall too hard or get your hopes up or want things to move too fast, just see how things go and good luck to you|`|XX7Z2atQaa	great love is too rare to find these days especially when people keeps running for life and misses the importance of life...you r lucky enough to find one great love which may never happen to every body. i say that great love must be accompanied with great courage to overcome hindrances that will surely stop this love...i am christian and my bf is a muslim and married, but because we feel that ours is a great love we fight for this love coz we consider our story is greater than titanic..yes we are crazy but to give u a tip, having difference must not stop one great love...i hope you will be inspired by my story. goodluck and congrats for having found on great love,|`|hxsM0Gt9aa	I think you would regret it if you didn't try. LOve is taking risks. What have you got to loose? Just be careful :-)      And if it ends up going sour remember this "It is better to have loved and lost then never to have loved at all"|`|3Xt4yWGtaa	sweety he's on a tour, do u have any idea how much fun and stress that is?  he prob might 4get about you form time to time. you didnt have much history with him did u?   so there's a good chance of him forgetting you.  he might keep you as an open option in his life. and you should as well. if he says he doing what he says then thats good, but don't be a **** if you don't trust him. Flirt around, get to know the world. don't wait for him, because you never know when life will end, and the waiting would be useless.|`|sIhPpdv3aa	Why doesn't he fly over to visit you? Wouldn't it be better to meet this guy on home turf?    Right now it's at the level of a great infatuation, not great love. Infatuation is great and can lead to love, but just know it for what it is! Love comes from living pieces of life together, so you haven't known him long enough or been in enough situations to love him.    If you're a christian and he's not that could make fundamental problems: does he have the same basic moral views as you? What does your religion really mean to you? Do you plan on having kids who are christian? Does God influence how you see the world or influence your decisions? If he doesn't believe in God you may find yourselves with very different priorities... trust me, it's not as easy as some people think.|`|bbbf3755af9f136a17c38ee61766a578aa	if you really love him then you should take the risk and be with him. it shouldnt matter if you two are from different worlds you love him and he sounds like he wants to settle down and be with you. just as long as he doesnt do random hook ups and stays faithful to you then you should give him the chance and see what a great guy he can be for you. my bf and me ended are relationship early out of fear and not being ready but i got a second shot at being with him and we have been together now for 7 months. some times you dont get a second shot and just should take the plunge cuz if you dont you may miss out on alot of good things in life. go for it girl .|`|ft8t98Pnaa	take the risk.. thats what life's about! have fun... I met my BF on the internet.. and we've been dating a year... and still goin strong|`|LykjWv6faa	I don't know about you, but I can't see myself with a skateboarder that tours every month. He'll be traveling in different places and you'll start to have trust issues. Think twice before jumping into a relationship with this guy.|`|fvyjQZ55aa	take the risk, yeah it could turn out bad but that's how it goes with everything. Life is nothing unless you take risks and go with what your heart tells you. Believe me, it may sound cliche but the truth is if you don't do this you're going to look back on these days someday and wish with all your might that you had done what you wanted. Love is a precious gift, don't let it pass you by.|`|ezI5HwRWaa	How do you *know* that you will fall in love in August? You don't.     He could very possibly just be telling you that he isn't sleeping with/kissing anyone, but how can you know that's true? He'll probably have a lot of temptations while he's gone.    And, I don't know how old you are. If you're underage, I strongly suggest you don't go and meet him.|`|aDLvzG2Saa	Girl just end that ish now. You will just end up heart broken either way. This is just me being honest. First you are Christian and he's a skater. You two only see each other on a webcam... Get out of the house and find someone who has your same values/views, someone you can see in REAL life regularly. Plus he's going on tour! He's gonna be having too much fun so just end it now.|`|NnFltKgsaa	long distance electronic relationships are more fantasy than reality. If he is willing to send you a ticket, do it, at least you will  be there and a flesh and blood him might be totally different from the the pixel him,but it works both ways. Stick to your faith as it seems it is important to you and guard the prize.|`|sn0V6bXAaa	Nah. He's gonna be banging skater groupies any way.|`|tpx1AHoPaa	don't do it it's a bad idea trust me ^-^|`|WkifEuHHaa	I'm in a simular situation & I have no advice. I feel awful.|`|ckjZnqHRaa	..what is a life without love sister....everything is a risk otherwise...even this!  Go for it darlin.....what else really?|`|uVuCx3taaa	What is the down-side of trying this out? As I have been told many times: love is where you find it. Of course I, myself haven't found it yet (maybe).|`|vm5TgsQwaa	Ok one hey another Massachusetts girl! Ok I just want to ask if your making this up because you said he was gonna write a song for you on tour. But you said he was a skateboarder not a artist.:) But heres my advice if this is true. You should wait for him till august. But it is fine to date someone while he is gone.|`|Gl3zQNGWaa	Love isn't always perfect, but the fact that you two are from totally different worlds is dangerous, risky, but at the same time sooo exciting - its like you're doing something challenging, and its beautiful :p I personnally love those stories that nothing could stop them (not even where they're from) from loving each other.  I think you should meet him - what if it turns out to be the best adventure of your life time -- trying something new  Or else you'll always wonder "what if..."  Good luck girl  x
v398Qalyaa	your friend is definitely lying!|`|3904bf9cec60af77f3ce3e9dfcd8c007aa	Yes Definitely.|`|M7365DToaa	if this isn't a joke, i'd be far more concerned with your inability to communicate anything which makes sense|`|jJheVSS4aa	Im saying yeh bu no bu yeh bu no bu...oh well i got 2points 4 that|`|K8NWUKiFaa	That makes no sense|`|VEgv5NhSaa	Say what?|`|h7ydm1graa	??
vG0tsqJtaa	Not wrong at all.  You should charge rent.  Give him a taste of what it will be like in the real world.|`|nMzzwrtUaa	No its not wrong at all, With this economic crisis we need other ways to keep paying bills and he is another mouth to feed, and some one else using utilities. I don't see how asking him to pay rent would hurt. You may also want to give them incentives to paying rent like they can do what ever they want to there rooms and allow any one they want in the house in there rooms.|`|sr0vZPQqaa	No it would be wrong NOT to charge. It's teaching them that you have to pay your way.|`|XlhBBZPxaa	No I have told all of my children that when they are 18 and if they still live at home then they will be charged rent and have to buy their own food they are not my firends until then they are my children|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	No. If he is an adult and still lives at home then he needs to pay rent. He may not be happy about it but why should he be able to live there for free? I would charge him at least $250/month.|`|O5KOwhovaa	Not at all, if he's earning a wage and needs to contribute to household expenses.|`|koVk3P9Gaa	My father did that, and to this day I resent him for it.  He didn't need the money, but yet he still used it.  It's one thing if you REALLY need the money to go towards bills, then do it.   But if not, I think it's rude.  The only exception would be is if you were setting the money aside in a separate interest bearing account to give it to them when they do move out.|`|LCn2TNHcaa	No that seems find to me. As long as the child is 18 or older out of school and woking that's ok. Sooner or later he is going to have to learn the responsibilities of payin bills.|`|PdBG8JvRaa	not wrong at all!|`|1JVAZbt7aa	no just make it something that they can handle.<br>  but other than that...its perfectly fine
M5hzHHvtaa	have you told him how you honestly feel?<br>  that you wish you could be there with him and it hurts you?<br>  if you haven't you should...he will listen to you and stop it<br>  <br>  if you have and he is still doing it then im sorry but he doesn't care about your feelings...his hurting you on purpose.<br>  <br>  the only way you can stop this is being completely honest with him...telling him how you really feel and hopefully he will understand and stop it.<br>  <br>  anyway good luck|`|h5UqTSG3aa	take his camera =]|`|Gyo0V4WRaa	TELL HIM IT BUGS YOU.<br>  AND IF HE DOESNT WANNA STOP... BREAK UP WITH HIM.|`|a77nWPXPaa	first say it feels kind of weird. if he doesn't get what you mean than start taking pictures with you guy friends. if he doesn't get the picture or does something drastic thann dump himm ..|`|Qhyovyj8aa	Tell him how they make you feel. He probably doesn't realize how upset it makes you. Once he knows that, he should stop.|`|auoLiBaGaa	Aw hun don't worry about it. I can tell you're really upset about it, but I'm sure it's fine. If he's sending you the pictures of him with these girls, maybe it probably doesn't mean anything because he's wanting you to see them. And if he liked those other girls, then why is he with you? I'm sure that he loves you and there's nothing going on. But if it seriously bothers you to a great extent, then maybe the next time he calls you can have a chat about it. Long relationships last on communication, so you shoudl tell him a couple of stuff you mentioned in this question. I hope everything works out. Good luck.|`|dSAuUNBHaa	I'm not a jealous person, but I'd definitely be a little upset or disappointing.  I would just tell him that it bothers you ALOT. Just be honest with him, cause I would be upset if my boyfriend had recent pictures with his arms around another girls. Just ask him how he would feel if you had pictures everywhere with your " guy friends" all over you.
bS3f0f1paa	it can. It just all depends on how you handle the situation, and if you guys hit it off or not. I met my boyfriend in Perkins when I went in there with my friends one night. And we have been dating for 3 1/2 months now and still going strong. : )|`|Lb15XHvBaa	I wouldn't count on developing a relationship with a stranger who talks to me at the mall or any other such place.  If someone does approach me in public my first question would be "do you have a job? What do you do?" Then that's where if he says the wrong thing I decide to not give him my phone # which is likely I would have Never given it out anyways.|`|GYobl7Xtaa	it can be if you talk to her, and she likes you, you ask for her # and then from there on you 2 plan out a date, and before you know it you 2 will be going out|`|EgzoiW4raa	There are no wrong ways to procure a relationship.

Otherwise, they'll just walk away and call their friend/s to tell them some creepy guy just hit on them.|`|BeBEOFGxaa	if you're not creepy about it, yeah of course!<br>  sometimes thats the most romantic way of meeting someone! like love at first sight aha!!<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|6H5IB26Oaa	Anything's possible|`|CpevWaQ7aa	Its possible|`|XnPnfFxPaa	hahaha YES! you would be surprised!|`|1EqwONoNaa	Yes.|`|5YQqMu8Xaa	everyone is a stranger before you get to know them :P I walked up to my boyfriend 3 years ago... and here we are today!|`|MKKx1luSaa	yeah it is posible|`|eZj1qCd7aa	No.... usually not, unless you go one eharmony.com lmao XD :D|`|3eCcTT7Caa	uhm maybe.<br>  but prolly not|`|dfRHG35Aaa	did with me|`|qpmGLd7laa	Isn't that how almost all long-term relationships begin?  Family and friends through family aside...|`|hXFndli2aa	yep it is possible, if you had a connection with this person|`|BO28Mn8haa	of course. seen it in clubs, libraries, coffee shops, school, restaurants, bars. how else do people meet each other? now a days it's barely through mutual friends|`|Un9CElCaaa	if u are confident in yourself and approach the girl the right way without being creepy about it you have a shot|`|JwnHKTabaa	Yeah. <br>  It just depends if you hit it off.|`|AA11119636	yup it sure does...as long as you're not completely drunk with beer goggles on|`|EyaqiWPwaa	only if she makes a good sandwich...thats usually how i judge them...i go to restaurants all the time and order a sandwich and find out if the chef was a girl ....and then usually we date for a long time|`|VFdC2wPlaa	anything is possible!|`|sNvF6KPbaa	ya bra, it has to start somehow.  Think about it at one point pretty much everyone was a rando to you.|`|xOX7yMczaa	i think its rare but not totally impossible. good luck with whatever is going on with that... :)|`|0fVtHNtmaa	They've made TONS of movies about it.|`|gMYoi210aa	yup yup yup! its hard tho, i have never done that yet|`|1jIzBUkhaa	who know's any thing is proable, love is blind|`|TPZZESeeaa	i'm certain it has
JN6LWA6Oaa	I agree with you too, I bet many guys workout just to get girls or because they think they need bigger muscles to be and feel like a better person. But yeah, the tables have turned, I workout because I like it, it's a personal thing, not to show off or feel like I'm better than anyone or to get girls, if a girl is going to like me I want it to be because of ME and not my physique.<br>  <br>  Yeah I agree with Danny too, they think buff guys are jocks, I'm a nerd, and geek, but I'm going to be one with a great physique hehe...<br>  <br>  Well yeah, society will accept the buff guy over the skinny or regular guy without a doubt and probably treat the buff guy better. It's true, society only accepts the fit and beautiful, our society is getting more and more superficial. And people know this so they feel they have to bulk up or lose a pounds, not to be healthy necessarily, but to be accepted. So yeah there is pressure...|`|iIBJWnStaa	I COMPLETELY AGREE WITH YOU! <br>  They also are making it be so very stereotypical that the guy has to be a jock. And even if you are you can't be "smart" in school.|`|coZ7Fm79aa	i agree with parker on this one..and your question makes sesne i know what u mean alot of guys think that way me personally..my girlfirend loves me for me and i know it..i was 100lbs about 1yr ago at 5ft 5 she went out with me now i m 132-135lbs and about to bulk again..she's still with me i feel she doesnt care as much as to how i look but how i present myself and how my personality is..i never ever worked out for anyone else but me all my problems go away when i workout..it's a "Joe thing" in my situation lol..so yeah alot of pple want to look good for that perfect girl and vice versa for women..i just wish the media wasnt so bad
UndijYHAaa	if you're not attracted to her, its better just to stay friends. if she likes you and you're not that interested in her, you will eventually leave her and break her heart. nothing wrong with being just friends.|`|tlgJrKoRaa	contrary to popular belief, looks aren't everything.  Someone may be very pretty but a complete fluff head|`|fVMzCP5raa	Yes, because you will get used to her and like her more as the time goes on.|`|492681182d7c9b1f14276670369e851baa	Yes because it's the personality that counts.  Give it a go.|`|2QS8j9aOaa	Why not, friendship is a good way to know if this can go to another level. Think about it a good personality is hard to find now a days. Pretty faces are just that a pretty face, but if she has no personality, you will just be sitting there with nothing to talkand that will get boring very soon with an empty head.|`|SekL1hy2aa	If you go out with her because the only thing you can think of is SEX while she really fancy you, I think you should let her go or being just friends really. But if you really like her company and want to see how thing goes, well I think you should give yourself a try. She probably has something right that still hold you on with her: personality (a bit something from the inside) and cute/looks. Types can change anytime when you met the right person, don't miss that chance.|`|pF4ahze7aa	go for it. =)|`|qYaINCrkaa	Give it a shot.  So what if it dosent work out, you will regret it if you don't try.|`|YQZui2R1aa	try it,,  but only if you know she wont be really upset afterwards.
NQFV2AdZaa	No you shouldn't worry as love is ageless and it's not that big an age gap to be a problem. My partner is 14 years older that me and we get along fine and i'm sure you and your girlfriend will too, good luck!|`|BP5ykmAmaa	given her age she is an adult and capable of making up her mind as to whether she wants to be with you, if you want to be with her then dont let the age get in the way.<br>  when i was 21 i was attracted to a guy of 40, we pondered things happening but decided against it, however that was more to do with the fact that he was married (very unhappily i might add, i knew his wife very well too and the two of them together was a disaster waiting to happen)<br>  age was never a concern, we got on soooo well and had soo much in common, different circumstances and who knows what might have been, but i wasnt about to be a home wrecker, he had to make that decision not me and to this day he is still married and miserable! <br>  we were very close as friends but not any longer as it was too hard to handle just being friends, 10 years on and im very happily married to someone just 4 years older and we have a toddler and i wouldnt change things for the world.<br>  if you are happy together then age shouldnt be a problem, you are both adult enough to know your own mind, kick back and bask in the glow of love and stop worrying as that will end your relationship quicker than anything!!!|`|xPTUzTBcaa	Hmm, I dunno. I'm 24 and I was seeing someone who's 42. Honestlly I broke up with him because it was too big a gap between us... we just wanted to do different things all the time.

The myth was propagated for a long time that it was a bad thing, but in all honesty, its instinctively conditioned from birth to seek out health, child bearing ability and fertility. And a big butt advertises those things, in width of the hips and weight, and it's been observed that certain areas on other primates tend to swell when at a fertile age. Maybe we're no different?    Though, that's only the logical explanation from observation. No man who is asked this can really tell you, logically, why. It's just pretty to look at and nice to the touch. :) lol If you have one, don't worry, it's not a bad thing. If you don't, well...we're all different with our own pros and cons.

CaogIDbXaa	Each person has this idea of the perfect companion that would make them weak in the knees and go gaga over that person.  While it is not really discrimination when it comes to dating, it is personal preference, although I feel that people should not limit themselves to just their "ideal image" in what they think is perfection in their second half.  It is their loss if they refuse to look past cultural differences and possibly finding true happiness or love with the person that "doesn't fit" their illusions.    The ones who refuse to look outside the box are closed minded and not worth the time or effort to try to get them to go out with you.  If they refuse to be open to new things, then you are better off trying to find someone who will be more open and receptive to the type of person you are and not look at what your cultural background is.|`|LykjWv6faa	I don't think it's discrimination. It's just a preference.|`|b91d5a63816ce3a9cce952ee2d7b3cf6aa	If you're an Asian man you have suffered more discrimination than anyone else on earth. Even women of your own race discriminate you. There are lots of discrimination toward Asian men thanks to Hollywood and MVT. My guess is that one of these days there will be a race war as the discrimination is getting worse and worse. We'll just have to wait to see what will happen.

But if it didn't kyle would just go to the other side of the cage and play guitar. Then Casey would flirt with girls outside the ring by insisting that they "need to be having some fun" Then Kyle's girlfriend would suck on Casey's dick for a couple minutes and Kyle would just play guitar a little bit faster and deny that it ever happened.
sLLgERQWaa	I would rather spend my entire budget on a modest, simple affair if it means the best I can afford for my guests, even if it's a cake & coffee reception...rather than go cheap and serve/offer inferior stuff in order to stretch the budget so I can have a sit down meal...I agree, it's a waste of money and I want my guests to enjoy what I do offer rather than make a statement or put on a show...good luck.    BTW.....I had 2,000.00 to work with for my second marriage...I had a total of 20 people and spent 100 a head....it was a simple home reception/buffet and the food was great....and all the people I needed to be there were.|`|a3422bad6666b60894e80bace0f14387aa	I think there are both extremes. We are going with what we can afford. Our guests definitely come first though! We had a great venue picked out and then we had a tasting there and it was horrible so we found a different venue with an amazing chef because we want people to enjoy our wedding. We are in this for the quality-quantity balance you speak of and would never go with any option just because it was the least expensive. I am sure there are people who are feeding 300 people pigs-in-blankets and punch just so they can have that many guest and I am sure there are people having 10 guests at $1000 a plate. My feeling is that these people are my guests, I am hosting and I want them to enjoy themselves and feel pampered. We are fortunate enough to be able to afford a grand celebration for all of the guests we want to invite but if we couldn't afford it, we would definitely cut the quantity before the quality.     Some people also talk about having a one-time celebration with their families. However, we have monthly birthday gatherings and holiday gatherings with our families so for us, weddings are always a more grand occasion. The family picnic in the summer is when we have hot dogs, hamburgers and less-expensive items and having a high quality event is what distinguishes a wedding from other celebrations in our family.     Good luck!|`|55zWUXcUaa	To be honest you say you aren't judging but your question did sound very judge mental, so I'd expect some angry posts if I were you.  When people are asking for the cheapest way to do something (May it be food, decorations, etc.) for the most part I don't think they mean "I want the cheapest food I don't care if it's terrible"  I think it's more like "What is the cheapest I can get food that will still be yummy".  The fact of the matter is we are in a recession right now.  Most people don't have much money and they want to have the cheapest party possible while still keeping the guests happy.  At least that's how I see it.|`|caa265fc73cd7f24fe83d9a186ac1af9aa	Do I care about quality and presentation?  Absolutely!  But at the same time I have a finite amount of money that I can spend so I have to decide where I will spend that money.    I did put my guests first - - food & entertainment are the two things I refused to skimp on.  But I'll be the first to admit I've been on the hunt for cheap centerpieces, bridesmaids dresses on sale, affordable photography, and discounted stationary.  Having expensive invites isn't going to ensure my guests have a good time - having good food, beverages & DJ are what they are going to remember and judge my wedding by.    Is anyone going to be inconvenienced that my wedding gown was a cheap $219?  No.  Would someone be inconvenienced if I had to have the best $5,000 wedding gown so I opt to have a room full of guests that get 1 hors d'ourve for the night because I skimped on that to buy an outrageous dress?  Yes.  And I would be embarrased to spend money on myself over my guests like that.|`|irLnPW4aaa	Most people are concerned about the costs more than giving the guests the 'best' of everything because the economic reality is that a wedding is a HUGE expense and we all need to try to stay within a budget.    I could have given my guests the BEST meal they ever had, but I would have had to have a guest list that included only our immediate families and I wanted to share the day with more friends and family members than that.  Really, I think people who are looking to economize and buy  less expensive things for their wedding are doing it so that they can save money in some parts of the day so that there is more money for other parts of the day.      For example.  I bought my dress on clearance at an outlet center for $99 (in 1990)...I could have gone to the bridal shop and bought a designer gown for $1000 or $1500, but that seemed silly to me to spend a ton of money on a gown that would never be worn again.  Instead I took that extra money (at least $900)  and spent it on inviting more of my friends to come and share the day.  They didn't care that they had a decent meal rather than a superbly fabulous meal.    Not everything has to be "THE BEST".  Cheaper works good too, and there are lots of ways to do it that most noone will notice where you went cheaper.|`|IUgkylWqaa	I think a laid back "least expensive" wedding is LOADS of fun and extremely enjoyable when all your friends are there. I would feel very uncomfortable at an uptight wedding with many slaves serving me fish on crackers.    Those brides looking to cut costs ARE staying within their means.|`|ECe1rgsdaa	It doesn't mean we don't want quality. Usually, when we ask about the most inexpensive thing, we check it out first. If it sucks, we move on. It isn't about a flashy party, it is about celebrating the marriage of two people who love one another. The comfort of the guests has not been forgotten. Please don't refer to it as "wasting your money," Not all of us can afford what you deem acceptable. Everyone has different tastes.|`|kUE3Ddktaa	Sometimes the cheapest option IS the best quality that the couple can afford. Most couples pay for their own weddings at a time when they are still beginning in their careers, still paying off student loan or other debt, and buying homes.    Anyone who has a budget has a bottom line. Unlike you, I guess, most people don't have unlimited financial resources to devote to a party.    I've been to budget weddings that were tasteful and beautiful, and I've been to expensive weddings that were tacky and awful.|`|AA11603468	I think younger brides who are paying for their weddings themselves have found out that hosting a party for hundreds of people is expensive-no matter how you slice it.      I think people come here looking for tips on saving money, which is commendable. There is a limit, however, to frugality. When it impinges on the comfort or enjoyment of the guests or makes your memories of your wedding day regretful ones, it's no good.     We did not have a budget for our wedding. We just bought the things we wanted to have the kind of day that would be great for us. We spent about $15-20,000, and felt every cent was worth it. I look back on my wedding (almost a year ago), and the only thoughts I have about that day are how great it all was-the money never crosses my mind. We are older, though, with professional jobs and could afford to spend like that.|`|HLBdtP1Uaa	No offence taken. But I have a question for you.... Are you married or engaged?    If so, could you describe what you are doing/did for your wedding?    Added:  Wow, sounds very traditional. What is the whole thing costing you?|`|AW1dCzH0aa	I think that perhaps you misread some peoples questions and responses on here.  Not everyone is looking to do EVERY ASPECT of their wedding in the cheapest way.  It's just that most people can't afford to have the very best of every vendor.  I'll use myself as an example.  :)  Photography is very important to me.  So, I found a great one and I bargained like hell to get her in my price range.  I have a wonderful venue and food is going to cost a pretty penny because it's good food.  So, that means I have to go with CHEAP flowers and only do beer and wine.  Wanting the best for your guests is definitely still a huge part of event planning and hosting.  BUT, not all of us can afford to go all out on every single thing.  Many of us must pick and choose!  But, I will say - the places where I have sacrificed have been on MY dress, MY hair/makeup, the invitations, OUR honeymoon... and all that is so I can spend more on the parts of my wedding that affect my guests.  I think many people on here are doing the same thing!|`|Dv7340P0aa	Looks like somebody isn't forced to pay for their own wedding.  Its not easy to have a nice wedding, go on a honeymood, and start a family at the same time.|`|T52u1DVXaa	I suppose right now the answer is the economy.  Of course not all families are priveledged either way.  But the cheapest when you can afford something better, it seems rather cheap.  No offense to anyone.|`|6755d6124814f8a889ed9508dc8b6638aa	The people paying for these events don;t have a lot of money......if you're someone who doesn't have to worry about costs, then count yourself as very fortunate.    Saving pennies - for some - can be the difference of being able to pay bills or not.    My husband and I had to decide what we wanted more - a wedding or a house. So we just went to the JP.

BOuPi3wDaa	Did he initiate the kiss or did you?  If he did and then he doesn't call you back, he's probably a player.  If you did I think you should wait and see if he eventually calls.  You probably know what it's like, saying you call someone and that stuff comes up.  But if he doesn't call within the next, say week at most, forget him.  It might be hard, but if he doesn't call he probably not into you. :(<br>  <br>  Hope he calls!|`|x1FzJLwZaa	he is a kiss and tell type of guy. move on don't waste your time with that guy. if he likes you, he could have done something now but he did not so don't wait.

You might get pressured later to do weed and once you do it once it can hook you to be addicted to the drug. Drugs affect a lot of things, it changes people and their attitudes toward others, they become aggressive and see things that aren't happening and are not normally this way when off the drug. Do you truly want to be with someone who does drugs, think, react and do the right thing and move on from this crush that will ruin your life later.|`|AA11162517	No it's not weird you're perfectly normal. Just because a guy smokes weed doesn't make him a bad person, and also doesn't mean that you have to do it too. It's also totally normal that he's always on your mind. I mean, you like him ALot from what it sounds. I say the next time you see him, get his number, be his friend for a while and see where things end up! you never know girl, he could be the best guy ever!|`|0HvA9ZEVaa	Just begin to do something, enjoy your hobbies and when you think about other thongs you will forget him, the time will make you forget him!|`|lJq4cbnBaa	It is good that you are not into smoking pot, to stop thinking about him will be hard you will have to put other things in your mind and take small steps.

Dating others my help and above all dear you think about him because you choose to, what did you think about before you meet him? And could the concern for his addiction have you wanting to help him stop ? It is okay to feel with your heart and sometimes it even hurts . choose to do the things that will and do make  you happy  get together with your girl Friends even talking to your mom and dad they were kids too and may relate to it and be a comfort good luck
dGyX3E8Faa	Well I'm glad you're not one of those retarded immature people that lets guys use them easily.    But yeah I think things may have rubbed the wrong way. Give the guy another chance. If he wants to date you, and you want to date him then go ahead. Just make sure he is not using you for action.|`|2VtkgzcIaa	He sounds like a kid that doesn't know how to flirt. I'd give him a chance because guys are kinda dumb with words sometimes. I would be careful and take it slow though... Kissing is great, but when it goes further, take it slow...

That's all they really think about. You're in high school (at least you should be), so don't worry about it so much. If you want to date him, date him. If not, don't. Very simple. He might think of you more than just some slut, but don't count on it.

EcCLlRtTaa	I always maintain seeing my girlfriend at least three times a week. I make it sure that i spend enough time in my 18-hour hectic schedule for her. The other four days I'm sure is satisfactory space of time between us so the flame of romance will remain.    In your case, you're the girl and you're the one bothered of finding a way to see your boyfriend more. It's a shame your boyfriend is not the one working for it. No matter how busy he is, he should make it sure that he can spend a little  part of his hectic day for you.    I suggest you see him at least half an hour  twice a week. In case he can't leave his work, your bring along his lunch with you in his office or wherever he's working at so you can talk with each other. Just do it at least not on a daily basis. Be creative.|`|SyHmExgtaa	Not that I'm clingy but I would definitely want to see him more than once a week...I guess I would want to see him almost everyday if we were really serious so at least 4 out of 7 days I would want to spend some kind of time with him.

Sb9Nvvu1aa	You need to talk to him about it and be completely honest with him.  Find out why he thinks that you guys should forget it.  If you are completely honest with him - then he has two choices - be completely honest with you - and then you'll know... or avoid the discussion - in which you'll know as well.    It doesn't seem like a kindergarten crush to me.    Good luck to you!
BeBEOFGxaa	oh wow, that must be so stressful on you as the in-between! it hurts when your parents dont approve of your choices!<br>  and im sure that you feel hurt because your parents are questioning your decision making! -- you should try telling them that, <br>  that you chose this man for better or for worse, and that it hurts when they are cruel to him like this. you need to get them to sit down with you and discuss this face to face. Explain that he is trying his best, and really doesn't need anymore in his life. Be mature about it, and think about arguments you can make in advance.<br>  <br>  - you love him no matter what<br>  - you feel torn between your husband and your parents<br>  -you are hurt because they don't approve of your choices<br>  - you are both trying your best, and the best thing they could do for you as of now is encourage your husband, and help him become successful<br>  - you are appriciative of their genorosity, but if this continues, it is actually more harmful than helpful (this is the last point, because your poor husband must feel worthless no doubt, men have that part of them that needs to be always being the provider, and the situation has robbed him of that)<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  good luck!!
AA10726533	Just ask him. I know that may be hard, especially if your shy or younger. Just tell him that you were wondering what type of relationship he is looking for. If he wants friends or if he is looking for something a little more serious. Usually I can tell when someone likes me by the amount of time that we spend together. It is very uncommon for guys to not be physically attracted to the opposite sex. Just ask him the best way you know how. We don't really know him so sometimes it's hard to give the best advice. I was in the same situation though and I felt like he liked me, I asked him and now were taking it slow and talking. We just hang out, slow is good though. Being friends at first is best, i haven't always done that and now that I am, It's working out a lot better|`|er13zfwAaa	As long as it's not near the altar, anywhere else should be just fine.|`|oGVRRx9Jaa	y don't u jus ask him wat u wan 2 kno
5IFKXi6zaa	It's very important that you understand men are different than women. <br>  After the third date or so he is going to pull back a bit to do some thinking, but will come back. He is probably in a bit of uncertainty, which is absolutely normal at this point, let him get through it, you are probably experiencing that a bit yourself especially since he hasn't called you yet. DO NOT CHASE HIM, men like to do the pursuing. Take my advice and do not get mad or irritated (if you do share it with your girlfriend) Casually call him, it's ok to call once but be VERY brief and friendly. Just Say (even if he doesn't answer leave a quick message) Hi it's me....just wanted to give you a call and let you know I had fun Saturday and I really appreciated what you did. LEAVE IT AT THAT, don't ask him any questions, don't even say call me, don't say you love being with him, nothing, just a friendly statement letting him know all is well, and that you are not angry he with him that he hasn't called you. Then you are leaving it open for him to continue his pursuit in you. Then give him a bit more time. Involve yourself with your friends and have the confidence that you are a cool girl and he will be calling you very soon. Maybe pick up a copy of Mars & Venus on a Date by John Gray, EXCELLENT dating book that will equip you with the right tools and spend some time reading that.|`|IdHS0P2vaa	If he really liked you i'm sure he would at least of sent a text by now.I wouldn't ring him just send a friendly text and if you get no reply at least you know where you stand.There's plenty more fish in the sea so don't ponder on what might have been.

Sure, he was a good person and you loved him immensely, but that doesn't mean you'd never fall out of love.  Yes, the depression & grieving was a part of it. Slowly, you became detached and you didn't even notice it. It *can* happen. Plus, there might have been some other thing happening in the background that you might not have been aware of.  It's not the end of the world. There are plenty of new things coming for you.
KsaaEZqHaa	The field thing sounds great! maybe use one of those outside leads and if it's nearby a house or hall you could rent, just rent it for the electricity! Or use a portable cd player - might not be very loud... Or a band!!!<br>  <br>  Cooool :)
B7kPUmUWaa	Because some men want women who have to rely on them for everything. That way they control every aspect of their lives. It's ridiculous, but it happens. I am proud to have my own job, my own car, and most of all, my own opinions about things. If that makes me a *****, then so be it. I can survive nicely without him. I don't need him, I want him.|`|a9btWYKRaa	Most Men can't handle intimidation by a woman as they feel we are the weaker sex and they feel the need to be the more dominant one so they don't feel like a 'woman'!<br>  <br>  I dunno, I guess they are still stuck in the old times when men WERE the more dominant ones in everything. These sort of men are the ones who think 'women belong at home looking after the kids and doing all the housework and cooking etc...... <br>  <br>  Come on guys we are in 2009!!!!!!! Things change!|`|EyaqiWPwaa	i think its becuz the independent women make there own sandwiches and never share with the men....if you shared once in a while then you wouldnt be refered to as such things|`|0fVtHNtmaa	Not all men are like that. Haven't you heard that new song?<br>  "She has her own thing, that's why I love her. Miss independent won't you come and spend a little time?"|`|G64z6K1naa	Because some men are vulger and think they own the world. Maybe because somewhere in history they did own the world, women had know views.<br>  But thats no excuse for how they behave now,, women can make their own money and be outspoken!<br>  Don't let a man rule your life, make your own decisions|`|qU2RbKWfaa	men should be options and trust me there are tons of them !!The jerk who was the insult was not a man just a _____ thats all|`|803c63e1bdfd226d14f4e5cafdc52f7eaa	I am 25, own a brand new home and convertible, make my own money, and don't need a guy to be happy or support me, and I have never had a guy think of me that way. In fact, many find it attractive. <br>  <br>  It's the attitude that sometimes comes along with that that can be a turn-off. No one wants to be an "option." I also think it's an ego thing; men want to be the one who make the most money and have the upper hand in the relationship, even financially.|`|eYuIsNk1aa	Well speaking honestly its because  many of the women who constantly refer to themselves as independent are the same ones who love to tell you how they don't need a man but complain that all men are dogs, and expect that  all men treat them like princess  but won't fix their man a sandwich " I'm not your slave you get up fix it". But expect that you take them anywhere they want & spend your last dime on them.... & expect to be treated like an equal but still want time off from work because of their cat is sick or they are having cramps from that time of the month so that everyone else has to do their work .<br>  They complain to HR. because a guy has cheer leader calendar but its okay for they to have the fireman  one.<br>  They want the jobs that like fire man , police officer, but want the standards lowered so they can get the job... they want to go out to eat but never offer to pay.... these are the way most so called independent women are.... there are few truly independent women in America this why I understand his feeling & why I follow Leykis 101
AA10706358	I was reading this and there like this romantic music in the background but when I got to the slapping part .. 'SCRATCH'<br>  <br>  Look, at first it was romantic and he had planned it or something, but it looks like after the kiss he started to think too much with his pants and couldn't fully control it..<br>  you can take this as a compliment, it's your call but what he did was normal to him..|`|WnbutJsuaa	it means he got horny|`|MQluC2Qnaa	so it sounds like as strange as u think he is, i think hes not that experienced and is trying to be like cute and romantic, haha but he doesnt get that its weird ahaa|`|Arw6OmVtaa	That's really really weird. Ask him why he does that lol I have no idea. So random.
7KkiBPDxaa	Depends on how long you've known her...    If it's been only a couple days then go ahead and keep talking to her, flirt a little more and show her a little bit more interest each time you talk to her.    If it's been over a week or two, tell her that your attracted to her and would like to go out with her! Or if your too nervous, the above information works too.    It sounds like she already thinks your funny, so keep up whatever your doing also!  Good luck, hope I helped!  :]|`|R3NbFHqkaa	ask her to hang out outside of school  :D|`|smyhq0Ggaa	Slap her face with your c*ck.    Girls just go crazy for that sh*t.

IxzJ6SN5aa	She was probably surprised and wants to think about it. Have you 2 dated before?<br>  <br>  I was rather surprised to be asked to the prom with a guy I hadn't dated. It was awkward.|`|CqdCQeOdaa	Maybe means yes but there is a 25 % of no, i wouldn't wait longer for two wekks but if she really wasnt interested she would have told you flat out no.
AA11097612	Develop a mind set of complete disrespect for women in general and yourself specifically.  You'll be well on your way.|`|7iRJQVm7aa	Just tell her shes sexy as hell and you wanna **** her brains out.

We just get so used to them we forget about them sometimes, and don;t realize how much in the way they can get. <br>  But next time, just ask the women to step back a little. That's a little less rude than "move your boobs."|`|MTPoGd1qaa	Haha, no but you were funny!!<br>  <br>  Ha I wouldn't have the nerve, gd for you!|`|rJ3eRddfaa	nope|`|JgEhGpydaa	lmao!!! na<br>  amswer my question!<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AsE1WpcTEgD4VI.isgtG3._sy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090225131321AAPdXTv">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|M5hzHHvtaa	that made me laugh<br>  i don't think that's rude...her fault she shouldn't have done that.
sIhPpdv3aa	the only way to prove to ANYONE in any situation that you have changed inside is to change your behavior. Truth has a way of getting out when it is lived. ;)    the more you live it, the more it becomes a part of you and the more obvious it becomes.     It's better if he hears from other people that you are acting differently, and it's better if he hears that it keeps happening over time. Then he may believe it.    Don't be impatient... that's a sign of hotheadedness. stay cool!|`|ixDTI97Aaa	Change is not something you decide on and then just doing it. (unless your are superwomen!)  You need to figure out why you have the need to control or to be right.  This usually happens when you feel insecure about something.  Try to figure out what is at the root of this problem.  Unless you get to the root of this problem, change will not be possible and you will keep on sabotaging your relationship.  Tell him that you care about him and your relationship and that you will ... (make a list of constructive actions you will take) and then ask for his support.  Ask him to give you a signal (maybe time-out) the moment things start to get out of hand.  Make him part of this changing process.  Be vulnerable.  I really hope that you will find solutions and save your relationship.
AA10065812	???<br>  Actually, as long as his ex-wife has not slept with someone, which is still adultery, than they are still married in a Biblical sense.  The same applies to you sleeping with him.  It makes you an adulteress.  If that's the case, you've already broken Bible teachings, so you can go ahead and turn your back on Christ, as you've already done, and marry him.|`|6wzQhsIkaa	I would hope that your church would want you happy...and if they are going to drive you out for being in love, then that is not the church for anyone. It is not their place to judge you, it is Gods.|`|lYjweuZmaa	For one, I believe in God... not religion. Any church who does not accept is a Human child of God is judging... and it is NOT  their place. Sometimes divorce IS NECESSARY.  Now idk if this was his case... they still dont need to judge him or you. This is about you and you bf. not the church. you deserve to be happy. And besides... why dont you take this into Gods hands.  Have a one-on-one conversation with him and ask God for his oppinion. Ask him what you should do. Ask him to put these answers in your best conciounce and knowledge. Tell him to lead your guidance. I am pretty sure he will say its ok. God wants you to be happy. And he gave you the freedom to love ... so why would God judge who you love ... think about it..<br>  <br>  good luck|`|YQ1Q7XeEaa	Just remember - your church is not "the Church".  In a perfect world there would be no divorce but this is no perfect world.<br>  <br>  If you church truly will not accept him or be really silly and refuse to allow you to marry him at the church because he is divorced then I think it's time for you to move on.<br>  <br>  God will find you wherever you are.|`|803c63e1bdfd226d14f4e5cafdc52f7eaa	My church does not encourage divorce (instead consider marriage a committment that should be honored) but at the same time understands there are extenuating circumstances and sometimes divorce is the only option (that or a life of misery). My church would never forbid me from getting divorced or seeing someone who was. I would probalby question my church if they did.|`|28qmqsySaa	change to Episcopalian<br>  <br>  <br>  good luck<br>  smile|`|vyNlyfczaa	don't worry about what church say!!! They are people like me or you and the church is here to SHOW, TEACH me the way but they can't tell you what to do! I am catholic.... when someone from the church (I mean priest) does something what is wrong the church says "this is not our place judge, God will judge him" but if I would do this same they would judge me right away!<br>  My ex-husband cheated on me, lied, beat up, abused and tried to kill me (he was in jail for that) so what I should stay married to him??!! Sometimes divorce is the only or the best option! <br>  Life is too short to be unhappy! and this what God wants for us - to be happy, right!<br>  Try to talk to the people in you church but for me this is wrong and ignorant from their side!<br>  If something you always can find new church with people who will support you instead judge you!<br>  Good luck and be happy!|`|579efbdfc8611a99d747d03112644e63aa	God does not want and or like divorce.  However, there are examples and times in the bible that it is allowed. Hebrews were allowed to divorce, but only for certain reasons.<br>  <br>  If you are saved and a child of God and Jesus Christ, you can ask for forgiveness in the past divorce and remarry.  This is what Christ is all about, forgiveness. He knows we will mess up, but only wants the best for you. If your church isn't allowing and or accepting of divorce then they clearly aren't a Christian church following the bible. <br>  <br>  Good Luck...I hope this helps.|`|cDRXtuJCaa	well there is some other grounds for divorce and it not been taught right,only from a religious ideal, seek a church who understand the bible fully but divorce is never a good thing but God can forgive it <br>  the new test, is a law of love so Jesus can forgive divorce, creflo dollar and matt  and lynnHammond have great teaching on this i got set free with it especially matt teaching,i not get into debates with closed minded ppl it just confuse and leave u depressed<br>   fele free to write if you need more help i do my best i studied  this a few yrs back <br>  god bless|`|i7b1WiLNaa	It doesn't make sense, even doctrinally.<br>  <br>  If he was a drug dealer in the past... that is the past.<br>  The church is there to help sinners reform.<br>  <br>  These people are just sticking to a stigma that is actually contrary to their teachings.<br>  <br>  In the end you need to decide what is more important to you.|`|qVL5R8nuaa	Simply marry outside the church. If its members are not supportive of your happiness you should find another church that would accept you and your beau as you are. There are lots of open minded people in this world. You do not need a bunch of judgemental fools.|`|09Y8F6hQaa	If you love him, then marry him.  If they don't accept him, then it may be time to search for a new church.  There are many good reasons to divorce, and he shouldn't be judged for his.|`|XlhBBZPxaa	there comes a time in everyones life when they need to seperate church from their VERY personal lives if the church doesn't agree with it then maybe find a different church to go to|`|HPqCRBq8aa	I say find another church. Love is blind and if the church doesn't understand that, then they don't understand love or God.|`|875b9562d8defd3804154e34c3bf5ea4aa	Your church shouldn't dictate to you who you should fall in love with.<br>  So here's what you do. If in your heart you know this man is worth it, is the person you want to be with forever, if he is a kind decent man. You marry him, and you hold your head up high at church whether they like it or not. This is YOUR life. You can have the man, and the church and forget everything they think or say about it. Only God has the right to judge you|`|JYgJD0Rwaa	The church should not rule your life, God should. You need to be more concerned about Gods laws and what he says about marrying and divorce instead of what the church says. Churches are not perfect, some go by their own beliefs and take it too far.<br>  If you are following Gods word in this relationship, and the church disagrees with your decision, then you need to find a bible based church who follows His word only, not one that goes by what they think is right and wrong.|`|FasxVeohaa	Many Churches are against divorce, but they are also think lust is a sin. So if he was to stay married and have a lustful eye for you that is a sin. Jesus is the one who judges on judgment day, not them. So if they interfere it is time that you go to another church. Just because there is a church doesn't mean everything in that church is by Jesus standards. They should not be trying to rule your life. Jesus will see that you are trying to do what is right. Go to another church and pray about it Jesus will let you know how he feels. I will also pray about it for you.|`|jDT8yH7Raa	Your church should not dictate your life, Christ should.  I see your one step away from cult.  People, especially Christan's are not suppose to judge.  If they are judging you and the like, they are not very Christian and you need to look into another church.  If you love the man why would you withhold yourself from him because of the opinions of others who don't count.  pray about it, God will give you the answer.|`|ENSGrZAqaa	They need to mind their own business. They have NO RIGHT to judge you or anyone else. I dont care if they are church goers, they can keep their opinions to themselves. Its one thing if you are asking for advise, and they state their position. But beyond that they need to keep their mouths shut. I would find a different church if they continue to judge. That's a lot easier to find than a good man. No contest.|`|O5KOwhovaa	Do you really want a group of elderly virgin men telling you what you can and can't do in your personal life?<br>  <br>  So what if "the church" aren't "OK" with it?<br>  <br>  Do they control your life, or do you control your own life?<br>  <br>  If you love him, marry him.|`|1IVEYMA9aa	STick it to the Man, No. Definitely think about how it is going to affect everyone around you and make sure that this is the best decision for you.

HEEXkiihaa	you are not very clear in your question. You never mention whether you have tried talking or approaching that girl.<br>  As for not able to get close is a little vague. Meaning you cant get close because she's attached? Cant get close because you think she's out of your league?<br>  Anyway i think you should just try being yourself and ask her to go for a drink ..eg a cup of coffee.<br>  Girls usually dont like a guy sounding too desperate. Just ask her for lunch or a drink and take it from there and see what happens. Good luck.
3ab0562924ae58daee1fe664ccc36a9daa	I guess when i hear that to me it means he wants to explore his options, but that may not be the reason your man wants a break? Some times couples make a decision to take a break from each other to see how badly they would miss each other being apart, some do it to explore their options, and some just do it to try to figure things out.<br>   I have been with my man for nearly four years now and we decided to take a break from each other and just be friends, well he still acted like we were a couple and he even treated me better then he did when we were actually dating, it drove me crazy! so i skipped town for a day and it made him realize he couldn't be just friends with me and we ended up getting back together when i returned home. So in my case it was a whole day..lol.<br>    It's different for every couple some guys take longer to realize they don't want to live with out you, some realize they want a relationship with someone else, some guys just decide to play the field for awhile, it really depends on the person and what they decide they want in life, could take weeks could take months possibly even years. The question for you is are you willing to wait and how long? What you need to do is keep yourself busy so your not constantly thinking about it, and do some thinking for yourself decide what you want. Maybe over a little time away from him you will find that you may be happier with out him and would like to date others? But you don't want to be that rebound girl so make sure you are healed from your last relationship before starting a new one, if that's what you decide to do.<br>    Your friends are right though harassing him won't make the away process shorter it may prolong it, so just give him time to work things out, and only you can make the choice how long to wait for him or to just let him go.<br>    Good luck to you on what ever you decide to do.|`|n8nhjmfraa	if you go on a break, then your relationship wont last much longer because with every argument, it will be followed by a "break" and that's just stupid<br>  but he's probably already breaking up with you, he just wants to be nice about it|`|Lb15XHvBaa	give it two weeks and then that way it seems like you kind of don't care but just long enough for him to wonder what happened to you.|`|EyaqiWPwaa	did you get tired of making him sandwiches...or did he just not appreciate the sandwiches you made him?|`|Zm3QIw4Taa	a break usually means he wants some space for a while. or for some guys its a nice way of breaking upp with you.|`|N4ZAzxdMaa	It may be tempting to take a break in your relationship if you have been seeing each other exclusively, and then begin arguing and quarreling frequently. However, before deciding that this is the best road to travel, you will need to take some things into consideration. The first area to consider is that once you and your partner take a break, either one of you may decide to end the relationship. This is a serious reality and one that you should really consider before agreeing to take a break. However, most people agree that when one party feels that it is time to take a break, they have already been contemplating ending the relationship. So, with that in mind, if you absolutely do not want to end your relationship, you may want to discuss other options with your partner.
B36hpSCsaa	once said, a secret is just gossip...there are no true secrets only families...|`|JwnHKTabaa	Can be, depends on what it is.|`|XlhBBZPxaa	they can be|`|djUMvICoaa	Some can be some aren't.  I found out that my grandfather made moonshine one time.  Some in the family say it's family business, I think, like others, that it's just interesting.  If someone was molested by another family member and it's being kept secret, that's damaging in two ways.  1; the child who was abused  2.  the other who became victims because it wasn't reported.  So if they are tied to criminal behavior more than likely.|`|cpxkROqMaa	Yes and no. Is the secret going to harm someone if they know or don't know about it. We kept the fact that our son was bipolar a secret for a long time. Once we told we found we had a good support with our family.|`|Dx0CAHeiaa	No, because when family secrets are revealed, it makes you understand more about the family you're in and the people you come from.|`|nGhqwEdpaa	Not really...they may be hurtful, but I think a strong family can deal with anything. I have LOTS of family secrets that are starting to pop out after 33 yrs!!!

m8QfHC7uaa	"love" in one person's mind, might be different in anothers. If you are truly feeling love for this person, then yes. <br>  But is the other person feeling the same kind of love.  Is he saying it to get something?  The two of you need to make sure your on the same page.  <br>  No one in any relationship is required to say I love you, it's just "felt" and "shared".|`|ae3ecab489f9cbbdd2b51fb0492f64d3aa	yes|`|iTf0l9Wlaa	i have been with my boyfriend for 5 years and you dont always need him to say it to know that he loves you but it all depends on the person and you shouldnt have to wait to tell someone you love them if you do then you should tell him but if you feel like you need more from him you should talk to him about it dont hold it in|`|hJX6Ur3taa	Absolutely not.  Always remember that words come easy.  Many guys will tell you anything to get what they want.  I think if a guy shows you respect, it is more important than hearing those 3 little words.  Actions speak much more louder than words.|`|CBzPSDKAaa	yes, but it maybe just word<br>  love is attention and affection|`|omBvkpUXaa	you think he loves u he loves you actions are stronger than words|`|40cef57d8cbeb3d292923003ab0fb8edaa	While actions do speak louder than words, any mentally healthy guy will eventually say it if he feels it. Let him say it first, though, so you know that he means it. If he doesn't say it often, but he says it on occasion, then he probably does in fact in love you, but he might not be very expressive that way. And watch his behavior. If he does romantic stuff for you like hold the door, give you little gifts on occasion, write you sweet notes and tell his friends about you, then you've got someone special.|`|Bkb7lJCFaa	i dont think someone has to say i love you in order to be loved as long as you feel the love we you around that person then that should only matter saying i love you is just the icing on the cake yeah it feels good to hear it but to feel the love is a whole lot better.|`|ANPv0ZcMaa	yes, and always let him say it first
uJ9waJDYaa	I couldn't do it. Id loose trust and respect for them.  I think that It depends who you love more, them or yourself and why you love them.  If you Love yourself you will make yourself be strong and walk away  but if you dont Love yourself you will just crash back to them because you will feel they are all you have, but that is a big mistake, once they have cheated on you that strongly and you have gone back to them, they will know they can get away with it, and they may very well take advantage of that, and of course they wont tell you openly they might still be sleeping with someone else, but if u do find out they will of course do what they prbly did first time when u came back  say sorry, beg for forgiveness, make excuses, perhaps even take you out.    Anyway, i dont think people should be forgiven for that, I think you can excuse them but not forgive them. i could forgive if it was a kiss, or a long make out. But sex, that's just a whole new thing and once that's been done, its a auto good  bye from me.|`|flqAr30laa	Sure, you can forgive them, but that doesnt mean you have to take them back.|`|dd0d57e5ff24820c6981c10f9097112faa	well, you have to put more value on other things in your life that are happening than on something that happened in the past.   My ex spouse cheated on me numerous times throughout our marriage, but I concentrated on raising the kids and realizing that I couldnt control him.    Yeah, it hurts real bad and because he didnt change his ways, I eventually left him.  And it wasnt so much the cheating but how badly he treated me though HE was the one cheating and lying and stealing love and time away from his family.  That's nearly unforgivable.      You move on.  You dont forget it, but you move on.  You have to.|`|scnW0Wzeaa	Not in my book. Once they cheat they will cheat again.|`|AA10774810	I don't think so.  I think even if you'd just be sweeping it under the rug, but the dirt's still there.  I can already foresee future arguments where the dirty deed would come up again.  I don't think it's something you ever trully forgive or forget, just repress.      Unless.... you weren't together.  That's a whole different story.|`|2esGKO2Caa	Yes forgive and move on if you don't it will eat you to little pieces. Not worth it or healthy|`|lGS1zOd6aa	it will always be in the back of your mind|`|ekRtrUnIaa	you really cant get over something like that!  i do believe in second chances but not for that!|`|qWlLjdJgaa	u dunt get ova it. i suggest getting ova da person|`|R0sfHEX4aa	No, I don't think so. You can get over it by moving on or try to ignore the person. They obviously liked someone better than you if they had sex with someone else other than you, which is really unfortunate indeed. Just try to move on, if anything.|`|tXFj8oSfaa	you can forgive or you can't forgive,  you know what I don't nkow.|`|1KzDOYNjaa	Well it's sure possible to forgive that person but it's gonna be VERY hard for you to forget. Forgetting that wicked act will have to be a personal decision you will have to make, despite the suggestions that others may give. Don't rush into trying to forgive & forget it, allow the 'wound to heal' over time, that's the best way to deal with it. Go out and get involved in activities that will help you to forget about it, but don't rush it ~ Cry if and when you want to as well that will help too...|`|AA10322137	if you get over it,he /she will do it again.if you were in serious relation and you were cheated on,you should walk away.don't be victim!

You guys are not dating anymore, he went out with a girl. If he has a problem he should have never broke up with you. Tell him to listen to beyonce "single ladies" LOL|`|G9iIrib6aa	Well he broke up with you so you dont have to tell him anything. Sounds like he is playing games.. Go on the date forget about the other guy.|`|xAoE9P5Maa	you should say: "Oh yea, and I heard you had a great time with that girl."  and he just seems jealous or possibly that he doesn't like it that you got a date so fast.|`|eU2k56zeaa	suck on his meat|`|7pprTsThaa	LOL Ricky is correct.|`|aD7PaNs5aa	okay, in my opinion, the whole "car thing" is crap. i get the feeling that he's not as into you as he says because he was with that other girl. so since he asked you about the date, tell him you think you're gonna go (even if you might not). this will really make him think about whether or not he really wants you and only you. good luck! :]
1pK1Sd0Gaa	If you have a girl friend she did same thing as you did with other guys, will you be ok with it? Just think about it.|`|AA11100500	If she likes you likes you then go for it...

eO4y3m1maa	Yes there may be a chance, but you wont know unless you just ask him out...you cant read into things..know for sure!
QtTvjLS4aa	Well honestly, i don't think its a problem if you talk to him, its not like your doing soemthing else with the guy. But i am not a girl so i wouldn't know exactly how she feels. But to my opinion i think she is kind of jealous, well because she's not with him anymore and the fact that he finds you attractive. I mean i would talk to her about you being friends with him, if you are really bothered what she thinks of you, but like i said i don't think its a problem. I also think that she still has a thing for this guy and thats the reason why she's acting this way. Well hope i helped a bit.
8vfCRg7Caa	its lame and its sounds kind of under 18ish to me. But it probably means that you have dated one of his friends or something. Other than that i wouldn't let it get in your way. Guy code. Its funny people have these codes but you can see all kind of people cheating on their significant others. So much for codes.<br>  <br>  If you think people dont care about what other people think you arent really thinking. People do care. Some people wear what in fashion and hate to take fashion risk. They dont like to live outside the norm. And having respect from his friends is something he cares about obviously. the whole reason you have to be carefull who you try to date. And pick them wisely. Even as a guy, if i date one girl, i cant date her friends. it is what it is. move on.|`|O6MNGGA4aa	The only thing I can think of is that maybe you dated that guys friend.? Guys aren't supposed to date each others ex girlfriends unless they have their permission.|`|eYuIsNk1aa	no  because if he is friends  still with him the its a very simple rule bro's before ho's(  girls come & go but buddies stay forever) just like you don't date your friends sisters unless  he sets you up with her.|`|06O8FaOjaa	WELL MAYBE THERE ARE MORE GUYS THAT LYK YU IN THAT GROUP OF FRIENDS AND THEY HAVE A GUY CODE BROS B4 H*ES|`|NS57cIo1aa	sorry... but thats just your school... some inside joke  <br>  :/|`|UGQ6HObRaa	Guy Code is this pact between all guys that are friends. You can't date another guy's ex unless you ask him and says it's okay (and even then your kinda a jerk if you do it). That's the only part of guy code you asked about, but it goes in depth.<br>  <br>  What you just said would seem true, but, a guy having rep, can make sure you are happy. If you break Guy Code, your rep is down the drain, and most guys rep is everything. Even if they like you, if they are not completely in love with you, they can't afford to lose that rep.|`|MUEsS8tYaa	I'm a girl, but my hubby has explained this to me before. If you date someone, you are usually considered "off limits" to his freinds. Even if you break up with the guy, his friends usually consider it against "man law" to date you. Or if one guy in the group has a crush on you, but you want to date someone else in the group. Same rules apply.|`|EyaqiWPwaa	well some guy obviously wants you to make him a sandwich and you prolly wanna make a sandwich for one of his friends ...and we all know that guys dont take sandwiches from girls when one of theyre dudes wanna eat that sandwich|`|ePFZ5tHqaa	Guy Code?! don't listen to there silly guy code and you should just tell the people who want to date you they shouldn't need to follow some silly made up code and its there life they can do what ever they want with it and not let some code control it|`|Tc1BO5kkaa	k i know that im a girl, BUT... it could be that one of thei friends of the guys in that class likes you, so you are off limits. or it could be you have dated one of them so the rest cant date you now.|`|x1FzJLwZaa	The guy code is a set of unwritten rules that are subject to change at any time.<br>  <br>  The golden rule among men. Do not mess with my property (my woman) and I will not mess with yours, but mistresses are up for grabs. May the best man win. That’s Guy Code.|`|INoFAZvAaa	if one of your friends dates a girl and she really hurts him, none of his friends can date her. or if one of his friends really likes her a lot, said guy can't date her. that's the gist of it|`|Or6RoRWDaa	Because you probably dated one of his friends.|`|NJrkgBaWaa	Guys code... There is no such thing... ATleast around here ..|`|oIPCanHWaa	ok my friend i am breaking it now... <br>  every man (guy) is born with the guy code in his head kicks in about puberty, and this guy code states.<br>  <br>  1. bro's before hoes.<br>  <br>  2. it ain't illegal if you don't get cought.<br>  <br>  3. if necessary sisters before misters<br>  <br>  4. best friends siblings are off limits<br>  <br>  5.don't tell a female about the male code<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  your welcome now i'm hated by males everywhere to answer your question.|`|dSAuUNBHaa	I'm a girl butttt most guys codes include if you've dated another guy in that friend groupp, therefore you are off limitss.

LGkb4xibaa	time is nothing. You can know someone 5yrs and not really know them. You can know someone 3 months and know them inside out. <br>  <br>  If you feel you know him well and trust him. Hes open and sincere and you know lots about him and feel comfortable with him, and hes the same with you, And you feel its right- Then i dont think its wrong. Maybe be a little cautious, but dont hold back if it feels right.<br>  <br>  Dont know about buying a place in this climate though. Renting may be preferable and less stress.|`|hHndD5SEaa	It certainly does seemed to have moved very fast - I was in your situation last year - met a guy- fell in love almost instantly - we both did - things were absolutely wonderful between us - we discussed marriage - how we would spend our lives and he asked me to move in with him - but now I thank god I didnt. Over the 4 months wer were together he literally changed overnight - we broke up just after Xmas - so whilst you could be after meeting mr right - I urge you to take care also - you dont know him very long..... a lot can change in the future - so maybe just think of what if things dont work out....<br>  xx|`|6febee8b4757d9cd4857176f7b29c818aa	In some cases, it would be wrong to move in with that person after only knowing them for less than a year. When couples start to live together, they tend to act differently towards each other because they always see each other almost 24/7 and sometimes gets on each other's nerves.<br>  <br>  If it were me, I would'nt rush in moving in with that person in that short amount of time.|`|UhnetgNkaa	why not move in and rent a place together but if you feel its moving too fast tell him and say lets take things a little slower.  Moving in together is a big step and you really have to know them very well before you live together.|`|NQFV2AdZaa	If it feels so right then why wait? Life's too short and some people get married quicker, so moving in doesn't have to be time based, just about how strongly you feel about him. I wish you good luck for the future.|`|WE91Bc8Aaa	If your both happy with the situation then i don't see their being a problem. Your right life is short so make the most of it - if it feels right go for it! You have nothing to lose. No-one can tell you whether its right or wrong - but you may want to rent somewhere before buying a house - then if anything does happen you dont have too many ties. Just make sure you still have nights apart (meet your friends/family) so you both get your own space. Good Luck n hope it works out! x

Having someone else ask him is kinda lame. You dont have to ask him in person. Talk to him online or text him about it and see what he says. Might turn out better then you thought
cWy17SRnaa	Start talking to her like a friend again.  Make her feel comfortable because she doesn't feel comfortable around you since you both have dated.  Make her laugh and smile.  Once you do this you will get your friendship back.
VpTUFKXiaa	Just act normal when you see her the next day like everythings cool ..still start some evryday conversations with her such as ak if she needs help with anything or if you two wanna go out with a few friends to see a movie or get dinner. trust me evrything will be as it was in a few days no matter if your in a relationship or not if you just break the ice and tell jokes, do what ever. In time you can always casually ask if she wants to get back together with you and if she doesnt or gets another guy or something..act like it doesnt bother you and continue being good friends! hope this helps!|`|yqy5xfSbaa	there's nothing you can do dude, wait for her if you want...you can't force her into being in a relationship.|`|N8J84PFDaa	A- your not going to die<br>  B- she is just another girl get over it<br>  C- hate to tell you this but your guys relationship probably wont get back to ho it used to be srry<br>  <br>  answer mine><br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090225135333AA8XGFx">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>

Also the ability to ignore convention and what other people think when it might interfere with doing the things they want to do or making the choices they want to make.<br>  <br>  3. I think of marriage as a good way to save money on certain taxes. The only romantic thing I see in it is that it is an opportunity to say officially, aloud, to many gathered friends and family, and to write down, what two people already know about their feelings toward each other.<br>  <br>  4. Not having the one to love or the love of one? (Speaking romantically and therefore excluding my dear mother.)<br>  Ah, but seriously I think it might be... make up. Not make up exactly, but the idea of it, the reasons behind it, etc. Wanting to look good and using clothes and colours and even make up to do so is alright as long as you're making YOURSELF look good. It's when it's taken too far that it bothers me and I start having a hard time seeing the girl and instead I only see a paste of make up or ridiculous clothes and so on. I think that I'm saying all this just to try and say that I hate the superficial.<br>  <br>  5.

eSI9c4Ncaa	I'm sorry to say that it sounds like he's moving on from the relationship, whether you're ready for it or not. It also seems that you are still interested in him to some degree, even though his actions of late make him more and more unappealing to you. Mabye it would be a good idea if you told him that you just wanted  to take "a break" or "some time" to think about "the direction that your relationship is going in". That'll give you time to see that he won't be calling because you're not on his mind, that he'll never see all the reasons why he should feel lucky to be with you and  after a good little bit you'll realize how unattractive he and his actions really are. Better do it soon though or he might beat you to it. And I promise the one thing that will help you the most through this break up, is if you take control and end it first.
77g1VEIjaa	wow that is ridiculous ! first of all you have an interview and a test that you need to pass ! there the selfish ones .. i would be so pissed ! and its not your fault you didnt get informed about the moving day.
UF8DSKZ7aa	Okay, this is going to be tough, but what you're going to have to do is make a thin slit in a fully cooked ham (a whole ham).  Write your letter to her, explaining why you don't want to be with her anymore (mention saturated fat and carbohydrates, she'll get the idea), and shove it in the ham, take the ham to her place, and let her eat it down, make sure you're gone before she starts to read the note, otherwise she'll try to eat you as well. this works, believe me.|`|l344RtC8aa	besides her being fat, which just makes you sound rude, she doesn't seem like someone that i'd want to be in a relationship with either. you need to be physically and mentally attracted to them which you seem neither. so just tell her you don't want to be with her as simple as that.  if she asks why just tell her you're not clicking.|`|aLgY4l3Naa	WOW, i cant even believe what im reading here!! You really need to feel ashamed of yourself, when you care for someone your not supposed to bail out on them when things are not right, you have no idea what it is to be a committed person, or to posses a little bit of respect!! I mean if your so concerned about her weight or disgusted by the way she looks then why have you not done something to help her in that area?? Why do you continue to go out to eat with her still, instead of suggesting other options like cooking a healthy meal at home?? Why have you not offered to start walking with her or going to the gym?? Why have you not talked to her about how you both need to take care of your health and as a team you both should do something about it?? I think because your a selfish person who only cares about himself and no one else and that's very sad!! I say just do her the favor and let her go, then maybe she will get it together with out the likes of you!!|`|pDpS2j6Xaa	thats really mean but i know how you must feel..tell her that you dont have the same feelings for her anymore and you think it would be better to just break it off for now...tell her its the best for both of you? how old are you anyway? email me if you have anymore questions !|`|xAoE9P5Maa	Just tell her that you would rather be friends because you don't have the exact same feelings you had for her when you two got together.  Don't tell her to go to a gym or you're too fat, just say, I just wanna be friends.|`|scnW0Wzeaa	Tell her she is an elephant. Then say I'm getting rid of you you greedy pig.|`|ASLbRwQ8aa	lmaoo|`|tzzYdnZKaa	Just tell her that you don't think it is working out.     If you are breaking up with her because she is fat then wow you are a jerk. Especially if you also care about what others think. If it is not because of those reasons then you guys are obviously not meant to be.|`|1sC6tgUbaa	tell her exactly why u want to break up ..every one says you should spare her feelings no ...she deserves the truth if you dont tell her she gonna find out from some where and its going to hurt her a hell of alot more|`|wKsALWsdaa	tell her you dont have the same feelings for her anymore and that you only see her as a friend it must be hard to be with someone obese for all the reasons you gave.
J97FMXdhaa	I guess it is age depending, if you are younger (in your 20's or less) I would say stay with him. I don't try to rush and find love, if you enjoy being with him, and he enjoys being with you why not keep that going. If you guys were to break up, it might become an awkward thing being with each other, specially if you guys are alone. Relationships are great because they don't need money to work, you can be doing nothing together and still just be fine being with each other or watching a movie. I just don't see a reason to call it off if both of you are enjoying the time spent together. Whether he's in it for the physical connection and your in it for the company either way you both are getting something from it. Although im like a monkey I never let go of on branch until I have a grip on another.|`|dPULl5hjaa	Let him go.  You will feel better about yourself when you gain employment.    I would express to him how you feel.|`|BopBYwSdaa	He sound like a great friend to keep but not a boyfriend you want to have. If you both have a job and different circumstances then you can ask yourself this question again.    You are unemployed now... so judgement cloud and you are vulnerable rightnow|`|Bc4udMhUaa	I would think that maybe you might try to proactively suggest something he likes to do. Darts, games, playing in the snow (if you get snow). Even without disposable income there is still stuff to do. Check you community section of your local newspaper...something. It might be things have just gotten dull. I would try something new first|`|JNqaeQKPaa	Talk to him, Tell him how you feel and why.  Then that way a huge weight will be lifted from your shoulders when he knows how you feel, and see how it goes from there.|`|zTCNnOqZaa	its really up to you. if your happy with him and you really love him then keep him. you should try talking to him about showing affection more. im kinda like your boyfriend and my boyfriend is like you. my boyfriend always kisses me soo much and sometimes i never kiss him really but he talked to me about it and i realized from his point of view that he just wants to be loved and wants me to show affection towards him and thats what im gonna try and do. so try talkin to your boyfriend and see what happens.   :)
9624d1b569ca710536d56a309ae51f7aaa	tie him to the bed and don't let him go until he has *** at least 10 times.|`|MHwn4Tlzaa	beg me to **** her in the ***     or beg me to *** in her *****    Hard to be more expressive here....email for more details.|`|91aDQQ66aa	dress up as a nurse a tell him you need to examine his dick temperature|`|jK2lvFWGaa	Wearing no panties bending over a table and telling me to F**k her hard!!|`|tXFj8oSfaa	i would want her my girl to slap me around and just totally control me.

I love to see a confident girl getting her thing on, on the dancefloor and teasing the guyz. Sometimes it's better to just stand and admire you batting all away all the second-rate guys after you danced with them for like 20 seconds, just long enough to let them believe they might have a chance, before breaking their heart.    Watching from afar as you perform, feeling you get off on the attention as every pair of eyez in the room burns into your skin.    Yup. You are the one mother warned us about, but daddy always wanted us to bring home. You are the best and the worst.    Go get em.    Ya Little Minx!|`|N8kxg8wgaa	ewww  your gonna be STI ridden soon|`|6zzte15caa	We enjoy it more when you let us **** you...on the dance floor...thats what you should do.    Just let me stick in the tip...Just the tip|`|PyAxwuqWaa	haha sure why not?!    Have fun!!|`|0fVtHNtmaa	Guys like women, especially slutty women. But that's all you'll be to them. Don't expect to be meeting mom anytime soon.|`|BE2vknbHaa	Yes they will enjoy for that moment but for the most part if your looking to date a guy your sending out all the wrong messages. Be a little discreet.|`|5OscbYafaa	Dancing like that is just dry humping to music in front of people.   We are men, of couse we do. Thats why we put up with the horrible music at these places, and spend all our money buying  you overprice drinks.|`|ASLbRwQ8aa	Go Have Fun Chikaa..      ;)|`|0496e87c1fc7124e21da310a296538f3aa	If you live in San Diego, I'll go get you on my NInja and will go from there.|`|PfaZSaN9aa	I sure as hell do lolz!  We should go sometime =]|`|e8b3731c3caa53583c8a9146800107b8aa	First of all you don't get a "STI" from dancing. DOH!    Secondly, hell yeah guys like that.|`|MOD9Poozaa	no we dont we just want you in bed then kike you out.|`|AA10275738	Hell yes they enjoy it. It's a big turn on, then you leave them high and dry so they have to take matters into there own hands and come up with a solution.
WpAsonqtaa	I think it is normal! U really like her and so u dream bout her, its actually kinda sweet :) just talk to ur ex an kinda hint to her that u like this other girl, if her reaction is bad maybe she still likes u??? But dont do anything that u feel will risk u not seeing ur baby, coz its not worth it!|`|ba3adde12f054008eb9115531e07a39eaa	they are just dreams, maybe you just want to talk to her that bad|`|wP1pgUKVaa	well, its normal for a guy ;)<br>  I would just say play it cool. Wait until high skool if ur not in it already|`|oTpkBS3Qaa	This sounds a big strange, sounds like your babys mother wants to be with you if you're still acting like you're together. You need to tell her you dont feel the same and because she probably thinks you still want her. If you aren't together, and this would piss her off then this isn't an ideal situation. If you're dreaming about this other girl, is means you're interested in her, like you said. This is normal, but if you do it often it shows you that you really hve to stop what ever is going on with the babys mother. She has no right to with hold access to the child, that would be selfish and imature. good luck.
AA12225497	It depends on him now.    You are doing everything in your power to make this friendship work, but hey, if he is not responding or reciprocating the gestures of wanting a friendship with you, then that is on his part.     If you want him to be good friends with you, then maybe you should express how you really feel about you guy's friendship. He may very well have a different view on what your friendship actually is.     What I guess I am saying is, just take the time to talk and get to know each other and wait and be patient. Really friendship just kind of takes place naturally.|`|4XlWLeSsaa	friends you say.......well you're a tramp makin a list and lickin twice  hope you get caught..P.H
eO4y3m1maa	Maybe you should talk to her about that? I know alot of people who only see their boyfriend/girlfriend on the weekends...because they are busy with work and school.     But they usually talk on the phone regularly...everyone is different. If its not working for you, talk to her about it...or just start calling her more...nothing wrong with being the one who does it. :)

ckjZnqHRaa	...surely he has a little crush on you too sister...just as you state that you have a little one on him as well.  This is dangerous territory hun......use your clear headed good mindedness obviously.  ......remember now darlin....he is still married after all.  20 year difference huh?.........lucky him huh?  Don't let his powerful position as your BOSS create fear within you anyways.  Work is work babe...play is play.  I try not to mix the two caustically.  Surely he's a friend and a boss hun.....that's usually a tough mix too.  surely he's having a fantasy mental visual about you possibly on his desk sister........but is that what you want considerably?  Keep it business babe...just my opinion....|`|2997dd7dff18e52ce16a266368a297beaa	it sounds like he likes the attention......please don't get involved!!! first, he's married, 2nd he's your boss, 3rd you will only get hurt!!!!  he is in a position of power over you and if you're not careful, he will take advantage of you....  Start maintaining some boundaries....don't talk to him about sex or anything personal.  Keep things professional.  What would happen if he decided to make advances at you physically and you decided you didn't want him to?  do you think he would let up?   maybe I'm over reacting, but please be careful!!|`|2o2jCzryaa	how old are you can he be like your dad age!! I mean he has a wife and yes he might have a crush on you but back off hes marry. do u want to ruin a marriage? Or if it does turn out tha her has a crush on you will you mess around with him! Well its pretty much on you Im nobody to judge
ADP9swbMaa	Sometimes sex on the first date ends up working out. As long as you love, or at least really like, and respect each other now, what happened three months ago doesn't matter anymore.|`|cn49BbRiaa	No its not right to have sex on the first date cause i believe you need to get to know someone completely before you can be intimate with them. Sometimes they dont take you seriously afterwords and all they want after that is just the sex and notting else. If a guy really cares about you he wait until the time is right for sex and he wont rush into it.|`|Bsf78pfsaa	depends on the age and if your ready|`|jDArp8H3aa	it depends on the ppl if like both of yu agreed on it then its okaay.

lISrOzyraa	I think both (he has feelings for you and he wants to have fun with you again) too bad it's his loss. Keep on moving with you life the man is married he made a commitment to another woman and had a kid. So there's you anwer, what's done is done. Dont give him the light of the day otherwise you will make your self vonorable, if you think he's stocking you and you're scared then a restraining order may do the trick.|`|CNgVwJgEaa	I think that you made the right decision to get rid of him and definately don't take him back!<br>  <br>  If he does it again report him to the police and get a restraining order on him so he can't get near you.<br>  <br>  Stay strong and don't go back out with the jerk!|`|0LEFco9xaa	Sounds like he does have feelings and sounds like he is obsessed with you. I don't know why there are some guys out there who don't know when to quit. But it sounds like you might have a stalker situation. You need to be very forceful in your leave me alone I want nothing to do with you statements. If he keeps brothering you like that write it down. If it doesn't stop see what you can do about getting a protection order against him. If you need to do that every time he does something major to violate it report it. You need to show him that your serious in the fact that you want no contact. I can't tell you why he thinks the way he does I'm still trying to figure that out with mine. Hope that helps. Good luck. Stay safe.
eO4y3m1maa	There aren't any teen dating sites, mainly because it could cause alot of legal issues and there really wouldn't be a good money maker because teens hardly have money.    Technically Myspace, Facebook, Friendster and all those sort of sites are dating sites...you can find people by joining groups and stuff from other schools.    Good luck! Until your 18 ..no dating sites!! Stay away from guys over 20...they usually are looking to take advantage of you :)|`|LykjWv6faa	Yeah, I would advise against it. Stop comparing real life to movies---because on real dating sites you never know who's on the other end.|`|dGyX3E8Faa	Oh yeah thats a bunch of BS. It's a freaking disney movie.    Teen dating sites are really unsafe. It's extremely easy for a 55 year old dude that lives in his mom's basement to go online and pretend to be a 15 year old dude named Max. It's not like the site checks out the people to make sure they are legit. The people on those sites only tell you what they want to tell you, true or not. There's no way of really knowing them because they will always portray themselves in a better light. I'd just stick with guys at the mall or school.|`|smyhq0Ggaa	Why not just meet people in every day life?    While you're young its much easier and safer that way.|`|9fAHd15Caa	Crystal's right, there dangerous plus there for despereate people who can't find people in real life, not teenagers who have a long time until they can be 'desperate'|`|mrF6N9fiaa	I would warn you to think carefully about that before you enter in your personal information online for people you don't know to read. I would highly recommend hanging out at new places to meet new people instead of doing it online.

AU4LAtqMaa	paintball,   laser tag,   staying at home and chilling,   play soccer/hockey together,   bowling,   roller blading,   ice skating  dance party  play in snow   sleeding  skiing  snowboarding  exercise together|`|owuF63XWaa	paintball, laser tag, staying at home making a pizza or an ice cream sundae and then eating it together.|`|0dEaFrFOaa	What you could do is take her down town, if you have one, and do lunch dates. It'd switch things up a little bit. Maybe take her to bumper cars or some little amusement park type of thing. I know a few girls who like going rock climbing, indoor that is, because it's a great way for their significant others and them to interact both physically and mentally.
7KkiBPDxaa	Talk to her just like you have been, and be a gentleman!    Pull out her chair, compliment her (but don't be creepy), hold the door for her... Make her feel special! And she'll definitely like you! It sounds like she already likes you so keep it up! Ask her questions and sound interested... Like what sports she does, or her favorite movies, then try to relate to her answer somehow.    Girls LOVE being asked questions, it makes us feel like the guy is genuinely interested!    Hope I helped, good luck!  :]
nqylxY7Gaa	She was probably smiling because there was only you two around. But then again if it was another girl that you did not find attractive at all, would you even notice her and smile? I think that she saw you and smiled because she wanted to notice you and you to notice her.|`|tU5NJVL3aa	"I would feel stupid to try to talk to her if it didnt mean anything."  Why?  Even if that smile didn't mean anything, if you are interested you should at least make the effort... maybe THAT might mean something.      Nothing ventured, nothing gained.

I don't think he would ruin your special day.  I think it is something that he would have brought up to  you by now.|`|afI03mJXaa	What you should do is stop worrying. That will make it an even more happier day in your life. Look you are a grown woman who is able to make her own decisions. We all know that family is not always supportive when they should be. You need to stop worrying about how your dad is going to feel because your on your own now. That's ok that your dad is a strict egyptian man, but he is no longer able to control you.

VSVQHKwKaa	Good Lord, you are one of the most selfish, self absorbed, destructive women I've ever heard about. <br>  <br>  You've taken a perfectly fine man and ruined him. <br>  <br>  You don't have sex with him. You are an adulturer. You are neglectful to your children (out 1 to 2 nights a week? 2 weeks abroad with the cheater?). <br>  <br>  Your husband loses his job, and his primary concern is being there for the children because he knows you won't be. <br>  <br>  You've been a junkie, you carry an STD, and have on-going health issues that your husband has to put up with. <br>  <br>  And yes, anything that hurts your relationship with your husband is going to harm your children. You majorly disrespect them.<br>  <br>  How can you labor under such delusions? How can you treat your husband with such contempt and infidelity? How can you be so cold to a man who goes to work everyday to help feed and shelter the family? And to a man who, in your own words, is a "wonderfully supportive man" who takes a sincere interest in your welfare (He always asks how i am)?<br>  <br>  You are a bane to all women who hope to find men even halfway as decent and enduring as your husband.<br>  <br>  You chief complaint is a) he's getting fired (who doesn't eventually get fired) and b) he hangs clothes wrong (huh?). <br>  <br>  I'd tell you to stay with your family, but I'm convinced you'd only hurt them worse and worse. <br>  <br>  I don't think your husband deserves to suffer a woman like you one more day. Frankly you deserve to live alone and without comfort, far from this man who you dump on and the children you neglect. <br>  <br>  You are the very definition of a terrible wife...as terrible as a man who drinks, cheats, neglects, and emotionally abuses his family. You are the female equivalent.<br>  <br>  Go walk out in front of a bus lady. <br>  <br>  I'm done now. You can go.|`|JkvlAVX2aa	I truly believe that you can have a harmonious marriage where husband, kids, affairs, boyfriends, and STD's all coexist peacefully to support all your wants and needs if you only work a bit harder on your selfishness.|`|KVIOPIX2aa	HE NEEDS TO KICK YOU TO THE CURB. DO HIM AND THE BOYS A FAVOR WHEN YOU GO ON YOUR LITTLE TRIP DON'T COME BACK (SKANK)|`|ATyHswTTaa	u have no respect for ur husband or ur kids.. what wife goes cheat for so long on their husband, why would u, he is great by the sounds of it and would be better off without u anyways.. u go out when ur kids are sick .. wow.. ur a terrible mother, who on earth goes off for 3ex with their bf while their kid at home sick, wantin to be protected and made better by their mum aswel as dad.. u should give full custody to ur husband and just move away with ur bf.. after all u keep shown u have no interest in any of them so why bother fighten for the boys when u dont want them when u had a chance.. u dont deserve to have ur kids!!!!  <br>  <br>  u should b ashamed of urself - terrible wife and def worse terrible mother, i wouldnt even call u a mother actually, ur just womb donor!!!|`|6PfJXI7iaa	OMG   How can you do that to your boys?   I hope their dad gets custody because you are not a good mother at all.|`|AdeD0xMuaa	I would let him have the kids. He seems more responsible and nurturing.|`|5hxWSezPaa	You are a first class s l u t.|`|aSSXt6tlaa	I wish I could think of something to say...well....alright.  One word:  Fail.|`|GsRpZJX5aa	omg if you were my mother i dont know what i would do to you. you deifnately show a lack of respect to ur husband and children. hello?? you are out and about yes working but going out with ur boyfriend too. when you should be fixing your relationship. i mean if you arent willing to work on it why did you get married. i feel bad for your husband knowing that he knows this. he prob isnt perfect but he is human and has feelings as well ur children. how do you think they feel. your mainly the problem. and sound really selfish. at least   50/50 for the sake of ur kids. ugggg i dnt wnt to be rude  but you sound so horrible i hated reading this|`|dcf4c1dec6ae1f9fba85b09be4c45028aa	Wow, are you sure that what you are doing is a good idea?  You have a husband who seems to be a caring but weak guy and you have this other guy who plays with you and makes you feel good.  Have you ever wondered how many other girls that your bf has on the side?  You are about ready to throw away the one guy you can depend on for a guy that could decide at any time that your just not good looking enough anymore and find some else.  If he is willing to have you cheat on your husband why would he have a problem cheating on you?<br>  <br>  You need to get you head screwed on straight and ask your husband to forgive you and start acting like a grownup instead of some kid.  You have a husband and children, and it is you job to be an excellent wife and mother to them.  <br>  <br>  Be careful, while your out screwing around with the wrong guy, there could be someone else interested in your husband.  You could get divorced and more likely than not your husband could be granted full custody of the kids.  He could then get married and you will be all alone.  You are playing with fire, and you could be burned badly.<br>  <br>  Last question, what did you like about your husband that made you want to marry him?  Make a list and start appreciating what you have.  <br>  <br>  Have a great life with your husband and kids.|`|uO0NW2nZaa	your husbane is a fine man. I really admire what he  is doing trying to make sure his kids dont go down the same path. <br>  I have been married for 10 years and in that 10 years my wife and have been through hell n back we both were gambling addicts, drug addicts, and alcoholics, and cheeters we also lost one of our daughters to cancer it was a hell experience. These days we have been clean for years and forgave each other for our mistakes it wasnt easy but we got through it we have 4 children who have been through alot and seen alot now they are well balaced and loving children because we are loving parents.<br>  If you take the path with this other man you are a fool too many people who get married want the perfect marriage but there is no such thing it's a fairy tale and as soon as there is a major problem either one party or both parties run from there problems and do not want to work on there marriage and then go on the re bound with someone else only to find a repeat of history down the track.<br>  I have learned that if you put the effort in even when you think all hope is lost your marriage will flourish<br>  Dont knock your husbane for wanting the best for his children you should be encouraging that as well . <br>  Do you know what marriage really is <br>  For Better or Worse through sickness and health<br>  if you cannot grasp that concept then you shouldnt have got married in the first place.<br>  your Husbane is trying to break a Cycle with the kids your kids know more than you think they just dont vocalise it<br>  let him have the kids, He doesnt want them to make the same mistake you and your husbane has made in the past. In my opinion thats the making of a good parent DONT KNOCK HIM FOR THAT <br>  you really need to ditch this other man and focus on making what your've got work. Yes it's hard so dont expect and overnight success but trust me it will be worth it. I'm sure your husbane is not perfect either and has a chequered past as well but from how you mention the children it sounds to me he really wants to make a difference and through all this taking the children even 50/50 can have a traumatic effect on them.<br>  You also mentioned  your husband is losing his job. Well my wife supported me during a time when i lost my job even when we were not getting along. I myself eventually got a job with better hours which gave me more time with my children and it made my wife love me even more. And i asked her why are you so nice and happy for what did i do<br>  she told me it was nice to see me spending heaps more time with the children and seeing the children happy even though i didnt have the time i would have liked to spend with my wife she understood and was greatfull i was focusing on the kids.<br>  Kids need that love and attension they do take alot of your time and as parents we must put our jelousy or pride down and make that time for them. childrens development is of the upmost importance.<br>  Forgive me if you think i'm being too hard or biased or nasty I'm just stating the facts. it would be nice to see you and your husband work this through and have a healthy marriage<br>  stop blaming each other work on forgiveness even if you forgive and he doesnt forgiveness will set you free hurt and blame will only intesify the situation<br>  I wish you all the best in the future and i am so glad you do not do drugs anymore i know how hard that can be if you got through that you ccan work your marriage out|`|vwOcFXgcaa	I hope your husband gets the kids. I hope he gets the house, the car, even the dog.<br>  <br>  I'm not going to say anything bad about you personally, because the only thing I really got out of you selfish post is that YOU haven't been a wife to your husband and now you are going to use your kids as a weapon. You want it 50-50? Why change? It isn't 50-50 now!<br>  <br>   Jesus. The only thing that would make this really messed up, is if you were a military family. Because this sounds SO Army.<br>  <br>   Thanks for the two points.|`|slDqC2J5aa	I agree with Sgt. Adams.  You defenitely do not deserve those boys or their father.  I wish my son's father was so involved and gave a da-n.  You are lucky and you're throwing it away by being selfish.  One day you're going to regret it but by then, your sons will have found out what you've done to them & their father and they'll be going on trips too - permanently, to get away from you!  Bye Bye Boys!|`|x32vIjXHaa	Sorry, but you are a piece of **** mother!!!! How dare you say you want those kids 50/50, when daddy is taking care of them while you are out cheating on not only your husband, but your family also. How can you go away from your kids for two weeks? That would kill the normal human being, but especially leaving them to go have sex with the boy toy? No wonder you have herpes, sounds to me like that hubby found himself a champ. This HAS to be a joke.|`|4HoVVCenaa	Sorry, but you are going to need a lawyer if you want to keep the kids.|`|bO2rzfISaa	It is not your husband's fault that you cheat. You are despicible. It would be right for your husband to get the children. You are a horrible example.

K1YHSR3oaa	Friendships should really be an equal give and take.  If you feel that you're not getting a good balance from this relationship, then maybe you should ask yourself if it's worth it.  My suggestion to you is to not entirely discontinue your friendship, but maybe give your friend a little bit of space to work on her own issues.  Maybe she needs to spend time with other, less thoughtful people who will flat out tell her about her toxicity, and maybe that will change her ways.  That way you don't have to be the "bad" guy.<br>  <br>  Sometimes there's also value in a good friend who will always be honest (if she can take the constructive criticism).  You could try talking to her and being honest with her in a way that offers advice rather than a complaint.  I recently had a friend tell me that I complain too much and even thought it really hurt my feelings, it saved me from losing our friendship as well as possibly saving my job.|`|16b306f00a8eed0cdd3e6f4dcef7e891aa	Toxic , means poison,,,meaning this relationship is not good for you, you have listed the bad and good in this relationship, she has become an intregal part of your life but the amount of energy you have to put out to maintain it is too much strain, she sounds controlling and maybe thats the toxic part,<br>  <br>  You need to research boundaries, and if this info does not help you make a decision, find some other friends to occupy yourself and see if having others tempers this affect on you....it is really hard to let go of someone you are very involved with knowing full well your life is better without them,,,maybe distancing slowly will help you gain some perspective, do it respectfully and discreetly, you deserve an equal footing on friendship ,,it should be a give and take, there will be ups and downs but never a domination.<br>  I wish you luck with your future friendships,,,join some groups, or maybe codependents anonymous they might help you,
DWLbXd79aa	you have got to be the DUMBEST person ever to think he wasnt porkin that girl and furthermore, to believe that he would ever be faithfull after that forever is a long time bit, then........ after all this u still want to be with him, i know this is  a perfect exapmle of how love is blind, but love yourself more and dont let him ruin you, WALK AWAY, RUN AWAY STAY AWAY|`|07cdc5710ed692974b09c64c65058e4aaa	It's fantastic how little *signs* will pop up to show you the direction you really should be going in....|`|wPzXqKQqaa	you  are just a booty call for him  ...

Good Luck|`|09Y8F6hQaa	You now know what kind of guy this is.  You overheard the truth, be lucky for that.  Its hard news, but it is the truth.  He has moved on.  You were dating a guy who was a liar and a cheat.  That says nothing bad about you, and everything bad about him.  I think as hurtful as it is, you can let him think until the cows come home, but don't date this man, don't see this man again.  He has moved on and didn't have the sense to break up first and still doesn't have the balls to do it decently.  What a jerk!|`|SCg3kDz2aa	This means that he is open for some fun, flirts or adventure with other girls, not necessarily for real cheating, maybe just a nice chatting, but he wants to stay with you. The first orientation point is that what he tells YOU when you are together. But he may lie to other girls that he is independent for getting some benefits from them. Very common behavior at his/your age. Now he needs time to cope that he was caught lying, nobody likes this. Maybe he is speculating of that how he can stay with you but go out with friends for some fun parallel. Some ppl likes to save some independence even in a real nice love relationship.|`|pOTigVYPaa	Actions speak louder than words.  His words say " I love you,"  but his actions say just the opposite.  Would you really want to marry a guy who is a liar?  You'd start off married life without trust and trust is so necessary for a successful  marriage.  The guy has already made up his mind regarding marrying you.  He wants out but doesn't want to hurt you.  I say he's already done that.  Move on and get your self esteem back.|`|AA11108897	You're waiting for him to decide?  Dump this guy right now for your own sanity!|`|3YzXWHwbaa	find someone else to be faithful to that will be faithful to you.|`|40WPuaMpaa	Don't make the mistake of getting married to this man. Clearly your relationship is not an honest one. Even if he was just with work friends, he still lied to you. If he didn't even feel he could be honest about that... he isn't worth it. Also the comment about the exgf... too many red flags, maybe he's not ready for a serious commitment, maybe he's just a dog. Better to have found this out now. Too many women forgive them for stuff like this and wonder why they cheat later on. Well it's because it was always there, the women just chose to ignore it.|`|NctuEmFKaa	I agree with andy.  He is just using you,  He has his cake and is eating every tasty little bite of it. <br>  <br>  Stop letting him run your life, get out there, hang out with your friends. Stop sitting by the phone waiting on him to call, and stop calling him!|`|b24df69d84b8825cbad6921ea5cc6874aa	What it means is he needs time to play around with other females because he knows you are to dumb to realize that you are being used over and over again & he will keep doing it cause you will let him.....<br>  <br>  Stand up for yourself girl & put him in his place you did not ask to be used like this.<br>  <br>  He is cheating on you & her he does not deserve your love & on top of that he don't know what love his.|`|xX0cNG2maa	Marriage is a huge commitment and you don't want to be in it with someone who is not 100%sure.  If he feels like he needs to lie to you about going out- if that really is the case, which it kind of sounds like it is not entirely what happened- then you need to really evaluate how stable your relationship is.. If you love him give him the time- but it sounds like you don't think that he is being faith-full to you and in that case.. It is not a good way to start a union for life.  I know it is a cliche statement but once a cheater always a cheater!  I know that this may not apply to everyone and every situation.. but be careful so you don't end up hurt in the long run.  Good luck chick
XnPnfFxPaa	hahaha girl!  i am in the EXACT same thing as you!  except i don't get my promise ring till me 18th ( is that weird? like, i know when i'm getting my "pre" engagement ring?) haha. we won't be married till about 21 or so tho.|`|ifgzHzA3aa	It's a promise ring.<br>  <br>  And sorry, but you're too young to be ready to be engaged or even pre-engaged.|`|76f80c73e4bfcb1026dd5ae2d1da3f18aa	listen, if you're ready to marry him then you will naturally already be acting in that mindset.  doesn't matter if you have a ring, how old you are, if you're in school, if you live together, etc.  basically he's given you a promise ring which means he's no good with money.  he should have saved that money to put toward a nice engagement ring when you're ready for that committment.|`|52e1044b00e7fe6ffc7e96609443787daa	It's called a promise ring - a promise to get engaged in the future. For high schoolers their fine, but no adult takes them seriously.|`|mx3gFmIKaa	It's referred to as a promise ring, like a pre-engagement|`|RKsn5dD4aa	Rock on!  It sounds like you guys have a reasonable plan for the marriage.  I once had a promise ring to.  GOOD LUCK!!!!!|`|87pV5lvZaa	A ring that engages you to be engaged (as odd as that sounds) is typically called a "promise ring."  It is often a less expensive version of an engagement ring, yet still maintains the same idea: that you want to marry the person to whom it was given.<br>  <br>  When I was 17, my boyfriend gave me a beautiful promise ring.  At that time, I intended to marry him after graduating college.  We attended separate colleges and actually broke up for approximately a year and a half; however, by the end of junior year of college, we had reconnected.  Two days before my graduation, he officially proposed--this time with an engagement ring!  That was four years ago, and we have been happily married ever since.<br>  <br>  That being said, I think a promise ring is a lovely idea.  It represents future intention, love, and respect without the immediate pressure of planning a wedding.  When you and your boyfriend have a few years of college behind you, you can reevaluate your relationship and consider trading in that promise ring for an engagement ring.  However, even if you break up, that does not change the fact that at the moment he gave you a promise ring, he was promising that he loved you and intended to be with you.|`|2kl0vQjVaa	It's called a promise ring and it is not the same as being engaged.  I know you don't want to hear this but you are too young.  You have so much living to do.  If it is meant to be, it will still be there down the road.|`|U8IcFRVlaa	What you're talking of is a promise ring.  Signifying that  one day you both plan to be engaged and eventually married.  This is something typical of older teens/ young adults who are serious about their relationships|`|BeBEOFGxaa	yeah, i've heard ppl call it a promise ring. its so sweet, hes making a point that he sees a future with you. hes just not ready to be fully committed to you yet, which is admirable, because he realizes the importance of time.<br>  im so happy for you ! good luck!|`|FkJobxmGaa	he gave you a promise ring then...its the promise to be with you and only you and when the time is right he will marry you so it's technially not an engagement ring but a promise ring.
e4gsxv0jaa	I think you should just sit down with him and ask him to listen to you, and tell him that you have something very important to say. Just tell him that you been going through some hard times and that you are sorry for making him feel upset... that you will try to become a better person and  with his presences would give you the Energy to over come this issue.
VSzhbzPWaa	She's definately into you|`|U06Y20Liaa	This girl is very much into you.  A girl would almost NEVER touch a guy unless she was interested, plus the fact that she put her number in your phone, and even laughs at your stupid jokes.  But in the end, the only way to know for sure is to ask her out.  So what are you waiting for?
2b0a3200c0db672cf39c688cc41d456caa	Religion is always a personal thing, and it sounds like he's very understanding of that fact.  You don't need to go to that church to support him - you can support him in other ways.  Don't go if it makes you uncomfortable - there's nothing wrong with that, especially since your husband is behind you on it.|`|de947568c9e8173e12d8a9930bab48abaa	A good compromise would be to attend a church of your own faith or one you feel comfortable in, a non denominational church, and also make a point to attend your husband's church at least once or twice a month to show support.|`|DlCcFu1eaa	It's hard to watch people you love behave irrationally isn't it? I don't know the answer for you except my wife and I have come to an unspoken understanding where I stay out of it but I don't get in her way when it comes to taking the kids there and teaching them that stuff. I do feel very uncomfortable though sometimes when I see them getting to into it. It's bizarre behavior that's only accepted because it's within the bounds of our cultural norm. Any objective person can see that these same people would be praying to Zeus or would make fine cannibals if they happened to be born into the cultures where that is considered "normal". <br>  <br>  Irrational religious behavior is also disturbing because we've all seen what happens to fanatics if they happen to get the wrong pastor. Jim Jones or the branch Davidians at Waco. It's scary because it's only a twist of fate away. I watch it closely. There have been a few times, like with the Y2k stuff where the pastor was preaching the end of the world that I've gotten nervous but so far she hasn't gone over the top too far. There will be no stopping her if she does but I'll try to protect the children. <br>  <br>  I don't know what to tell you except that the people who have this need to get wrapped up emotionally in religion seem to have that need built into them and if it's not religion it'll be something else. they tend to see everything as black and white, good and bad and they need that feeling that some grand power is looking out for them so they believe it despite the fact that church goers get in just as many accidents and such as atheists. It's that feeling they're after not any reality.<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck, I feel you're awkward discomfort at having to watch it all. I think just allowing him to do his thing is being supportive enough without forcing yourself to participate.|`|bO2rzfISaa	Yeah, I wouldn't aspire to this. I wouldn't be able to be married to someone who believed this, but that's just me. I couldn't go to a service like this to support my husband. There are limits to my ability to suspend disbelief.|`|803c63e1bdfd226d14f4e5cafdc52f7eaa	Eesh. Religious differences in marraige can be huge problems. My fiance and I are the same religion, but I am very devoted and he wants nothing to do with it anymore. <br>  <br>  I suggest you sit down with your husband and let him know that you don't feel very spiritual in his church. You support him and are proud of him, but the way he chooses to worship is not your way. He sounds ilke he is already supportive and you're the one that has a problem with it. Figure out what you can do to assuage that. Maybe it's going to special events he's in charge of, or getting the kids ready to go. <br>  <br>  Good luck. ,|`|f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	as this is going to begin occupying a great deal of your husband's life, I'd be concerned that you may be jeopardizing your marriage if you didn't at least make the effort to attend.<br>  <br>  I would recommend going occasionally to familiarize yourself with the church.  And maybe speaking to some of the members about their beliefs as a way of educating yourself and helping you feel more comfortable.<br>  <br>  The main problem is that he is a leader in the church and your absence could hurt his chances at promotion and greater responsibility.  Also, unfortunately, your absence will also be seen as your marriage not being sound and could place him in the uncomfortable position of fending off the "minister groupies".  (I have no idea why but there is a certain segment of church going woman who wants a minister for a husband.  and man are they ever barracudas.)|`|qpAYU8Knaa	If you love your husband then go with him to the church once a month or on any big days like Easter, Christmas etc. You are doing it 'for' your husband. You don't have to jump and scream or fall on the floor. You should not feel uncomfortable. Consider yourself to be like a wife going to a football game with her husband without having any interest in football or even understanding the game. She is there just to be with her husband whom she loves and wants to share the joys of his activities. She doesn't have to scream and curse or do the wave if she doesn't want to.|`|i7b1WiLNaa	Personally I would be uncomfortable too.<br>  I have seen it, and don't know why they go into these orgasmic fits.<br>  <br>  It diminishes the dignity, in my opinion.  (To say the least).<br>  <br>  If he wants you at his side he needs to know that you will have to find one where you are both comfortable.|`|fRIEHBJOaa	talk to your husband about it. i dont see why you have to attend a church that makes you uncomfortable. that would make uncomfortable too. just attend the church on holiday,so as to show your man some support. just because HE'S changed doesn't mean that you have to change your entire life.|`|5iOHJHUzaa	Getting in to Heaven is not a matter of how much you know about spirituality. You don't have to audition by speaking in tongues and falling to the floor dramatically. I am black and have been to black many churches and I must admit that blacks can be very dramatic in church. Just go with your hubby and don't worry about putting on a performance like the other members do. Good luck!|`|94gC814Eaa	I would never go to a church like that, however I would definitely make sure my husband knows how proud i am of him. I think i'm right when i say your uncomfortable with this,  I would be, but i was raised very religious and was told that churches like this have more of evil than god(because of the tongues thing) but your reservations should not get in the way of your husband feeling supported however you should listen to your gut and not have to do what you know you dont want to.|`|Ke4AQ6rPaa	This problem is not going to go away.  You two are unequally yoked in many ways, and this difference in spirituality levels (not to mention the culture clash) will continue to put a strain on your marriage, and will also likely hinder him in his ministry.  I am frankly surprised that the church would consider giving him a position of leadership if you are not right there with him in this calling.<br>  <br>  The Christian thing to do is to submit to your husband, and pray about it sincerely--that God would give you the grace and the shared commitment so that you can be who/what your husband needs in order to fulfill his calling and purpose.  If you love and respect your husband, and believe that he is within God's will with this call in his life, you need to be right there with him supporting him.<br>  <br>  That said, I wouldn't be comfortable with the pew jumping either.  It is not the style of worship with which I was raised, and I have my doubts about the doctrinal soundness of some of that.  It would be extremely hard for me to go along if I wasn't "feeling it" either.  But you put yourself in that position when you said "I do".  Either you have to somehow grow enough spiritually that you will come to the point of agreeing with him, OR that you will be able to show him from the Scripture why this church is not right and lovingly in submission help him seek another place of service that fits you both as a couple better.<br>  In other words, you need to accept that his way is right and get with the program, or somehow show him that he is wrong and pray as you seek another path together.<br>  <br>  To leave the marriage, or to not support his ministry are both wrong.  To usurp his authority in the marriage is wrong.  Study the Scriptures (especially Paul's letters to the Corinthians, Timothy, and Titus, where it talks about women's roles in marriage and the church) and pray about this, and speak as honestly as you can with this about your husband in love.<br>  <br>  It is not "fine" for you not to go to church with him, especially if he is the youth minister.  Not only will it put a strain on your marriage, and take away the opportunity for the two of you to build your relationship on shared faith at the foundation, it sets a horrible example for the youth and their parents to which he would be trying to minister.|`|aSoCKVJ3aa	Many couples have this problem. You said it, "put my "uncomfortableness" aside and go to church."  Look on it like a life experience. If nothing else try to find the humor in it. <br>  <br>  I've attended churches like this and was able to enjoy it..  But you will probably have a lifetime of this, if you choose to accept it now.  You say you've come a long way in your spiritually, maybe it will continue to grow.  You should not strive for your husband's level but your own level and that should give you some inner peace.|`|cDRXtuJCaa	speaking in tongues is just a form of prayer but it can be scary if you do not understand it <br>  I was like you when i got invited to a church like that i thought they were nutters or an occult but i decided to pray and i later got to speak in tongues and have found it so valuable <br>  talk to your husband and pastor ask them to help you to understand and tell your husband how you feel as he needs to be there for you to find your way but please do not think it to do with race it just maybe you have had a different mindset of what church should be|`|KR8OdLc4aa	If your husband loves you he will understand your desire not to attend. this may be a test of his devotion to you<br>  <br>  ****  MEET ME IN MILDREDS PLAYPEN****|`|AA11108897	That's a really hard one.  It's hard to make a marriage work unless you both share the really important things at the core of who you are.  I think you should continue trying to go to church with your husband.  You should do a lot of soul searching, too.  If this isn't the right church for you, is there one that is?  But if your husband can accept that you don't want to attend his church, and you can respect each others beliefs, it's possible to be happy together.<br>  <br>  The most important this is that you're true to who you are.  Try praying and asking God what you should do.|`|CF1R0TPvaa	How about going once in awhile, and just be yourself while you are there?  Maybe look for a way to participate in your comfort level, ie. on an operating committee, or coffee set-up, etc?  If you show up with a neutral position occasionally it would probably be nice for your husband and who knows you might run into something interesting.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't avoid it completely, nor should you "fake" getting into the whole thing.|`|RAatxTeSaa	I know what you mean... im not used to toungues and that kind of stuff... but my boyfriend is! But recently ive been going to his church and i love it! all u have to do is get out of that comfort zone and feel the holy spirit! Just pray to god where he wants you to go to church. It doesnt have to be there... but you should become a member of a church where god wants you! Never say that you wont be on a level your husband is! all you have to do is pray and read the bible and believe that you will get there!  Just keep on supporting your husband and it will be okay! Good luck!|`|kHLwlNA5aa	This is one of those very big questions that only you can answer. All members of my immediate family are of the same basic beliefs. If one of them were to choose to have a different belief, we would support them in whatever way we could. That's what families do. If I were your husband and you were honest with your feelings and told me what you wrote here,<br>  I would encourage you to seek out something else that you were more comfortable with. I would not see it as you deserting me. I would see it as you pursuing something that you need to do. I wish you luck whatever you choose to do. It's really sad that life doesn't come with an all-inclusive instruction book.|`|pDrkcc6taa	To have belief in God is a very private thing.  To worship with God there are a millions different ways.  Participate, you don't have to writhe on the ground, but be there.  Spend your time there worshiping the way YOU want to.  Everyone there believes, just not in the same way as you.  You don't have to be in a church every Sunday to beilieve in the Lord, but your belief in him should keep you going in support of your husband. Good Luck!|`|w9mrFRJ2aa	Yes, this is a very delicate situation.  I would have to say not going to church is not considered not being supportive.  As long as you don't stop him and you are happy for him in what he does, and encourage him to do what he does, that's being supportive.  Sure going to church adds to it, but it doesn't diminish from what his heart is set to do if you don't go.  Just keep talking to him.  Discuss it with him about how you don't feel comfortable and how you don't want that to stop him from doing what he is doing.  Tell him you support him 100% but that you cannot get into it like he is.  Just make sure that if you stop going to church, that you support and congratulate him on his achievements in his faith.  Beyond that there is nothing you can do.  This is something that is going to last for a long time(the spiritual thing) and possibly forever.  Just make sure that you stay happy.  Your support to your husband will be proved through love and encouragement.  Not whether you go to church or not.
bO2rzfISaa	If a parent abandons a child they don't have any right to make demands on them later. The state of his health is irrelevant. He had an obligation to be a good parent to you. When he chose otherwise, he broke the family bond. Anything you give him now is at your pleasure. If you choose to give him nothing, that's your prerogative. Your family is willing to yield to his demands, but it's up to you whether you do.<br>  <br>  I would also say that your mother still has the mindset of an abused woman. She is trying to make him happy instead of doing what's healthy for her.<br>  <br>  EDIT: You can forgive him for your own mental health and still have no contact with him.|`|SsfnitjXaa	You are not a psychologist and there are so many things wrong with this whole scenario it can't be covered here.  So I will tell you what to do.<br>  <br>  1. Stop "protecting" your mother and allow your bio dad to talk to her.<br>  2. Butt out of the relationship between your brothers and their bio dad.<br>  3. Stop supposing you know the complete history of your parents and don't suppose you know the reason for your bio father reappearing. <br>  4. Don't depend on your childhood memories.<br>  5. Meet with your father one time with an open mind and listen to what he says.<br>  <br>  If you do something wrong do you expect to be punished for the rest of your life.  Do you believe that YOU can change for the better?|`|NnN4drsbaa	Let go, and Let GOD!!!!! Don't keep beating yourself up. Just forgive the man, and move on. You don't have to have a relationship with him, you grown now. But if your are to be an example to your kids on forgiveness, let this be the first step
drXe7aDeaa	this is a bit of a situation people may say its easier but is actually harder because you risk losing your relationship and also your friendship with this boy. if your not in love with him anymore and you don't want to go out with him then maybe for his sake you should tell him that maybe you two should just stick to what you are good at and that is being friends and maybe he might just need some time to come to terms with it xxx be patient xxx|`|WDEWAR8Faa	just tell him i still see you as a mate and not as a boyfriend and i want you to still be my best friend, but we need to break up as we dont act like a couple no more hopefully he would understand|`|aGaYpgt8aa	if you guys are such good friends and not so good at being boyfriendand girlfriend then you were ment to just be friends.|`|AA10348091	think of it from your perspective what would you want him to tell you or just tell him exactly how you fell of course at first he will be mad but if hes a true best friend then it wont change|`|aNdXegnjaa	Hmm well I was in a relationship with my best boy mate, and now we've broken up & I've lost him as a friend aswel.    but I don't knowwww.. may just be my bad luck.    just talk to him and try seeing where your relationship stands.    Always say if you can't imagine being "ok" with seeing them in a relationship with someone else & not you, then don't let them go..    Maybe your just getting bored or something    don't break up with him yet, just think about it, talk 2 him and try having more fun together.   & if you do break up hopefully you will stand by him as his friend through the heartbreak, because surely you'd be broken too     hopefullyy my advice makes sense?  hope it works out anyway!|`|CTBq8VLAaa	right i was a girls best friend and she broke up with me but nows she making me jealous and wants to be friends an i no longer want to be best friends, so yea dump him you will lose your best friend and regret dumping him.|`|H6tfjz8Saa	ahha, this should be easier bcuz you are such good friends, as long as you dont jump into another relationship too fast, he should take it like a man and respect your decision|`|dXynvbJbaa	maybe you could explain to him that you don't see him that way anymore, but the two of you had become close friends and you don't want to lose that... I'm sure he'd understand=) good luck!|`|bebc550db6e492a92e2205e49d7b7eb0aa	if he's your best friend you won't lose him! just explain fully how you feel, and talk it through so he knows exactly what you feel and where you are as a couple. There will probably be some awkwardness at first but it will fade don't worry it better to be true to yourself than stay in a relationship because your scared of what may happen. It's better to just be open with him.  good luck just make sure your making the right choice.  xxx
HZ7Dlz3kaa	I have seen that too, but traditionally, you should not wear or use your fiance's monogram before you are married.  so if you get your shoes with them on it, when you walk down the aisle you'll be using his monogram too soon, and that is bad luck|`|ECe1rgsdaa	I've never heard of that either... Wouldn't they get rubbed off?|`|5270639c059ab08c1b3431555f150db7aa	I've never heard of it either... except in the Paul Simon song     http://www.playlist.com/searchbeta/track...    Interesting interpretations of having 'diamonds on the soles of your shoes' - scroll down after the lyrics - sure made me think!  http://www.songmeanings.net/songs/view/3...    ----  Some site on the net said women use blue letters for their 'something blue'...  http://www.graciousbridal.com/rhinestone...|`|RuKK1LYiaa	i've heard of it and think its the stupidest idea out there, no one will see the bottom of your shoes so why waste money to do that.|`|sLLgERQWaa	First time I've heard of it...seems rather peculiar if you ask me...reminds me of the I Love Lucy ep where she plays a dead show girl since she's under a body sheet the only way people know who she is , is she chalked her name on the botom of her shoes...lol  Guess that will cut down on the question 'Am I at the right wedding?" when the couple kneels at the altar....|`|HLBdtP1Uaa	I know what you're talking about, I've seen theat too:  http://inspiredgoodness.typepad.com/phot...    There is a tradition that my friends and family has done. All your bridesmaids sign the bottom of the brides's wedding shoes and at the end of the night the last name left, that hasn't been rubbed out, is the next to get married.    I don't believe it's true but its a cute little tradition to do with your girls.|`|8g51eBf1aa	You know I've never heard of that for wedding shoes. I've seen it for flip flops, for the honeymoon. It's a neat idea.|`|6755d6124814f8a889ed9508dc8b6638aa	I've seen flip-flops with stuff stamped into them....    But as for rhinestones on the bottom of the shoes....seems like someone's just asking to slip and fall.....dress shoes can be slippy enough as it is.|`|XVW4XN45aa	that is just plain silly, i have never heard of this but i would def never do it. sounds like a waste of time and money!|`|8G7Yx9MRaa	I've heard of putting blue rhinestones on the bottom of your shoes you and your fiance's initials and that can be your "something blue." I wanted to do it, but the idea got lost in all the details of my wedding.     I think it's a cute idea.|`|445676ee4ba9ef6e5bd44f0f3b9d7501aa	I have never heard of this...    What would be the point?  It is the bottom of the shoe for crying out loud!  Who is going to be looking there?
mTUQSlcpaa	He seems to be  slowing things down a bit ,pacing himself, he's not trying to test you. You may be putting to much pressure on him and he's feeling uncomfortable. Don't set a time frame on text messages. He does text , it's better than not getting them at all. Cut him some slack .Maybe he fell asleep , or forgot to call. Fall back and let him be the one to reach out to you from here on out. Be more passive.|`|bbbf3755af9f136a17c38ee61766a578aa	he is slowing it down. you gave him sex and hang out and now he wants time to himself or who ever else. it sounds like you gave him what he wanted and now is moving on to the next thing or just a break from you it sounds like he will come and go from you as he pleases. i had a previous boyfriend like this. we didnt have sex but we would get close to that. he would come over hang out then leave and wouldnt text me hours or days later. he will just keep doing this route that you have till you break it. i would suggest to talk to him so you 2 have more then just a sexual relationship and id he is only intrested in that more then you then i would move on. this cycle of him doing this over and over again can make you emotionally hurt in the long run.|`|Vhq3GURQaa	Why do you girls sell yourself so short. Because a guy hangs out and texts you, you have sex? You're going to learn the hard way, that is not what a man , guy respects. He wants a woman with some pride. I don't think he playing hard to get. You told him yeah  you'll have sex and hang out ,so no commitment. He has no reason to be obligated because you said there was none.|`|8HnLYjK4aa	why buy the cow when you can get the milk for free.

bqkfu6Diaa	Because that's how guys talk. You women talk about how that other woman's shoes don't go with that dress or something. Us guys don't understand the talk, nor do we care. It's just how women talk. That's about all there is to it.|`|AA11982228	They're probably covering for each other and he just slipped that time.|`|ghz5D5iLaa	He was either telling that because he got lucky there or thinks that your husband needs to. Has he complained to his friend that you are not giving him any?|`|afI03mJXaa	I wouldn't take this stuff to seriously unless your husband is looking forward to trying to get an easy women. I think that his friend could be telling him this because he still sees your husband as a friend to talk to about girls. Just because he says that doesn't mean that there are easy women for your husband. More likely its for the friend and whether your in a relationship or married your friends are still going to talk to you about other guys and stuff like that. So, I wouldn't take it too personal. Good Luck|`|cb5c699472c5114ed99da5404a38ca3faa	Sorry to say but.

Well, Now that I think about it fighting back is the worst case  so just ignore her and tell an adult it will solve that problem.<br>  <br>  <br>                             =]|`|MNa3e8Mdaa	you should talk to the other people that she was talking to and tell them if they were a good friend they would not turn their back on you for doing nothing to them . they have nothing to do with it. It is really between you and your " not any more friend".Then tell that bitchy girl that she needs to stop garaging other people into you guyss issues.And that is she was smart she would stop. and talk to her about things. maybe you guys can not be like best friends but also like not fight. Just so there is not tension around each other.

Honestly I think he's only feeling bad for himself because he got caught.    If you really care for someone you dont do things like this.    I feel sorry for you.    Good luck.|`|DIFDYxCWaa	you won't get over it! At least not yet. You may forgive him, but you will not trust him. He is leaving and you never know what other secrets he is hiding from you. Plus you will end up being home alone while he gets deployed, and he is just keeping you around so he can have something to come home to that he trust! I would get out of this untrustworthy relationship fast, especially if there are no children involved. I know it sounds bad but life is too short to settle. Be happy, and sprinkle your love somewhere else:)|`|7E2UO7CDaa	most importantly you have to accept that you won't be able to get over this in 4 days.  it is not possible for any married woman to get over thier husband's affair in 4 days.      You need to have one-one talk with your husband about why he did it and how long he's been doing it.  of course any man would feel "bad" for their women for cheating on them. however that is not good enough! after all we are talking about a man who said "I do" vow.    even if it was not physical, it still is just as bad.   it shows how much potential is out there for him to actually be sexually invovled with other women.   if he is not willing to be the real man and keep himself committed then he is not worth of your heart and commitment.

No one should get away with threatening another person.    She needs to protect herself.
zxq5QhNtaa	There is a good chance that if you still have feelings for him and he has them for you then you'll be back together. You guys dating other people is probably a good idea because you can see that the dating world is tough and that there are a lot of scumy men and caty women in the world. And once you two get a chance to see how other people are, you will both realize that you two might have had something real.
ELSKfMpxaa	There was a kid like that when I was in middle school, sort of, he used to walk around asking girls to give him a hand job. Most girls would get embarrassed and turn him down or be like "ewww no way". Well one day he walks up and asks me. In the middle of lunch, standing in line with over 100 people within earshot. I look at him, smile, and say "sure" Which of course got the attention of everyone around. Then I said "but you have to do something for me first" He of course gets excited and says "yea, what do you want" and my reply was to say "I'll give you a hand job, but you have to go down to the science lab first and get me a pair of tweezers and a microscope so I can find it" <br>  <br>  That kid never asked another girl for a hand job again (as far as I ever heard about of course)<br>  <br>  Don't pick on the deformed fingers, 1 its not right because he cant help it, 2 he's probably numb to it by now. <br>  <br>  An insult to the manhood typically hits the hardest, but you have to do it calmly and with a straight face or it'll be brushed off as anger|`|b99c02d2efcaf0924dc72f729d7ae118aa	What you wrote sounds good if you want to say that much. You should try to keep it simple, like "you effing freak, leave me alone". But in the end, how will it make you feel?

7gH7sgi6aa	There are such children, and trust me, they are tangling a web that they will sooner or later be caught up in.  They may think they are master manipulators...but remember, they are but children.

Good luck.<br>  Peace, Love & Happiness|`|jmq2i59Jaa	hidden video and send to shrink for evaluation|`|lGdzb8aqaa	get the video  camera out. I know what you are saying and what is she 10-11. good luck and pray.|`|NoFC9rtKaa	I know a child just like this.  They are so good at fooling everyone around them and if you say anything about their true nature, they are like "what, that kid?  She is so sweet!"  And you end up looking like a jerk.  I have decided to keep my mouth shut, and sure enough, the child's actions tell on them after a while.  And unfortunately at some point people learn to not believe anything they say and if they need help with something they can't get it.  It's a terrible situation they put their own selves in.|`|3RfHq80Naa	Of course it is.  Children are little people.  I don't know where this idea came from that they are innocent and God-like.  Children are mean and selfish because they don't understand that their behavior hurts others.  How old is this kid?  Is she yours?  The best thing to do is to remove yourself from the situation, but if she's yours, you have to wait until she's old enough for boarding school.  Then, pop the champagne.|`|HJrTuihcaa	My brother is like that, unfortunately, my mother does not know what to do with him until he's 18. <br>  <br>  sorry for not helping.
rfYXFV8Jaa	The first thing I notice is a woman's body language.... Smiling, not smiling, open or closed arms/shoulders..... Smiling and Open being the better of the two.....  Brains is more important than beauty for me, especially in serious relationships, but we all know that beauty is probably what attracted me to her in the first place......  Personality is a very vague word, but some of the qualities that I look for are the ability to relate to others, high energy, optimism, ability to let loose..... but the most important is how she reacts to other girls.... Girls who say they get a long better with guys than other girls are a turn off, not because they will most likely have other guys around all of the time, but because she probably does not get along with other woman because she is critical of them.... judging and comparing....  Hope this helps.....|`|X5fEQGgNaa	beauty, no brains.  having some respectable level of intelligence can only lead to things like her feeling independent or, god forbid, conversation.    as for personality, i generally look for a slew of submissive qualities so that i can make her bow to my will.    The Cheese has spoken.|`|aJp2TGy5aa	face ,,boobs and butt.... first and if thats looks good the brains part is a plus but it dont really matter..|`|GVlzdZKsaa	Boob size.|`|6bec1b1d615ba504dd8ddd905700f371aa	You say " what is the first thing that you notice about her" well, you cant' really notice brains at first glance.  It's obviously looks .... but I'll tell you this, a very attractive woman can become unattractive quickly if she's really stupid.  And you know what, the opposite is true too!|`|9220e99cf581203dda5db0c56616ac40aa	the first thing i notice is the vibe she gives me.  she HAS to be at least somewhat attractive all around, and has to have passionate eyes and an ability to show interest.  that's the best way i can explain the vibe.    "brains or beauty?"  a balance of both.  if i'm not sexually attracted to her at all, there is not a pinch of hope for her.  on the other hand, if she dropped out of high school, doesn't know what's good for her (i.e. does drugs and gets into foursomes), can't hold a fun conversation and makes you think you're the smartest guy in the world, then i don't think so.    okay, so if the vibe doesn't spark up, we two can probably only remain as friends.  if it does spark up, then i look for a sense of humor, a stroke of femininity without being fake, and an ability to hold a conversation.  eye contact is very, very important, and she can't speak like she's out of the ghetto or trailer park.|`|10knD5g0aa	I've known plenty of attractive girls that have no heart and i've met average looking girls who have hearts of gold so it's not always about how pretty you are.. obviously the first thing i'm going to notice is your face and body.. because it's right there in front of me.. but after to talking to you for a while i'd decided weather or not you're the type of person i want to get involved with. When it comes to personality I like a girl who can be herself|`|LLgLPEPUaa	Well when you first look at a girl you can't tell if she has brains - all you get to see is her beauty.    The first thing I notice is her face and hair....the second her body.|`|92n13q98aa	Brains.. Beauty goes away.. If I can't have an intelligent conversation with a chick, I'm immediately turned off, no matter how hot she is. Sure, I might still want to bang her, but not be in a relationship.|`|9KaPcyXqaa	The first thing i notice is the way she acts and if she looks good or not.  Looks don't really matter 100% as much as being yourself and to be willing to have fun.|`|9gvxaYyNaa	well when i look at a girl i usually look at her body first and then her face, in a girl i like brain and beauty, but if i had to pick 1 mostly i would say beauty cus who wants a fat ugly girl girl friend, may sound mean but its true.  in a personalty i like fun, interesting, able to take a joke, and a caring person|`|WQwCkbw8aa	I wana keep it simple: brain with fair looks.  I like them skiny looks with a litte inteligence.    First thing will be looks, coz I can't swim into thier brain so fast.|`|sXT86Swqaa	Initially we see the physical features first by default. With these I personally notice her face and then her figure. Upon talking to her the initial judgment made about the physical features can be overthrown by the way she handles herself. If she's cool to talk to or if shes engaging in conversation. A guy would rather be with someone who's less attractive but he can talk to then someone who's really attractive but cannot hold a good conversation.|`|be0YaDUPaa	Different guys like different things.  Preferences change with maturity.  Point being, there is not really any one thing men prefer over something else.  What is beautiful to one is plain to another.  To one, a "bubbly" and pleasant personality is "ditsy" to someone else.  The main thing is just to be secure in yourself.  Like what you like, be who YOU want to be and enough guys will like it.|`|8JiTyw2Paa	beauty of course, brains are all right if their hot.|`|QmdAZvGJaa	I look at there face. And I think Brain's because they can make a woman Beautiful but i guess its beauty that sometime attracts us to but if there fun and smart there perfect

otTMXJvRaa	Hi Xcarax,    Look you're only 13. There's no rush to get a BF.    You sound like a very nice young lady. It's good that you haven't started doing anything yet with boys. So what if all of your friends are hooking up? You've probably already saved yourself lots of tears and heartache.    Just be nice to people, and start talking a bit more to some boys. Focus on others instead of yourself. Smile, ask some questions (homework, music, hobbies, pets, etc), and make good eye contact. Have a sense of humor.    Now, suppose that some Romeo gets interested in you.  Have you considered what you would do next if that happens?  Getting a BF is only the beginning of the adventure, not the end...     Since you seem to be an innocent and sweet young lady, here's a general crash course all about guys, BF's, crushes, dating, love, etc. for you to think about.    Xcarax... crushes, dating, and love can be confusing... extremely confusing... for adults as well as young people. That's why it is a good idea not to start dating too early.    It would be advisable for you to not start seriously dating until you are about 16 or 17. Your parents should also say OK and meet the boy first. And stay a virgin (i.e., no premarital sex) until you get married.    In Junior High and High School, young guys and young girls can be pretty unpredictable, and change their minds very quickly... for no reason whatsoever. That can lead to hurt feelings and heartache. You and some guy might both agree that you like each other one day, and literally the next day either one of you could call it quits.    Xcarax, don't assume that you will marry your first crush or your first serious BF... it won't happen. The odds are literally 100-to-1 against it. Sorry!    Keep in mind that the purpose of dating is generally to determine if a person will make a potentially good future spouse. Therefore, don't ever date someone that you know would not be good for you in the long term.    As a decent and trusting young lady, you will need to be aware of a few of the potential hazards of dating. These hazards certainly apply to young people as well as adults. That's also why you need to not start kissing or making out too early with guys (even though you might want to).    Xcarax, here are two major dating hazards for you to consider:    1. There are some guys out there (the smooth players) who will tell a nice girl that he loves her, just to see how far she will let him go with her body. There are guys out there who are ready and willing to use you and your body for their own selfish pleasure... and then leave... breaking your heart in the process, and possibly leaving you pregnant... or with an STD (a nasty disease in your private parts). Hopefully, you are old enough and mature enough when dating to recognize these losers, and say "No".     2. You could meet a genuinely nice and decent guy, and you both really do think that you love each other. After a few weeks or months, you both might be tempted to take off your clothes together. That would be a good way to mess up both of your young lives. It's happened to a lot of nice girls and decent guys out there. Hopefully, you are old enough and mature enough when dating to resist this type of temptation... and the temptation can be very strong.    Xcarax, the best way to avoid getting into trouble from either hazard listed above is for you to never be alone with your guy... anywhere. Not his house, not your house, not a friend's house, not behind the school, or anywhere else. A responsible (and awake) adult should always be nearby.    You should also never attend a party where no adults are present... ever. Nor any parties with drugs or alcohol.    Ideally, before you start dating, you need to make a conscious decision to remain a virgin until you are happily married. Having sex too early will make you feel sad, cheap, and make it less special (same thing with kissing in case you do it too early with the wrong boy... but kissing is much less dangerous).    OK, why no premarital sex?     Because having sex without marriage is going outside of the laws of man and God that civilizations on this planet have lived by for thousands of years.    Because there's the unnecessary risk of excessive heartache (any break-up will cause heartache... virgin or not... but heartache will be less if you are still a virgin... that's just the way human brains are wired).    Because there's also the genuine danger of an unwanted Baby... or an STD.    Because your parents would very likely be extremely disappointed.    Because your "no sex" rule will pretty much eliminate the players, the losers, the creeps, the clods, and the selfish manipulators.     Just take a look at a random selection of the questions from girls in this category... a significant number of problems here directly involve premarital sex... coupled with immaturity, foolish expectations, and invalid assumptions.    Long term, you need to find a special guy who will be honorable and be very good to you as you grow into a decent young woman. He may not be the hottest-looking guy around, but you will love him just the way he is. He should be a guy who is proud to take you home to meet his parents and his family. A guy that you would be pleased to take home to be introduced to your parents and family. A guy who will ask for your hand in marriage. A guy who is willing to stand together with you in a wedding ceremony before both of your families in church.    You don't want a guy who is not honorable and just wants your body... for a while... and then he would be gone. A problem like that is much more likely to happen if you start dating too early, and have trouble recognizing good decent guys versus hot-and-attractive creeps with smooth lines.   |`|eSDNSq4zaa	well first improve your looks and the guys will wanna go out with you. and your too young to be in a serious relationship so dont worry about getting a boyfriend right now.|`|0fVtHNtmaa	All it takes to get a guy interested, is being female.

Rch68tXlaa	If its your friend you should feel comfortable enough to tell her she needs to clean up.But when telling her don't be mean and disrespectful about it.You shouldn't try to hurt her feelings.Don't do it in front of a lot of people, make sure its just you and her. If you embarrass her you may mess up your friendship so chose your words wisely.    Hope it goes well  Good Luck...|`|jj2tSASnaa	show her this screen. print it.give it to her.  or you might consider talking to her instead of all of us.|`|hAp8Orbvaa	suggest in a funny way she smells, or tell her kindly that maybe she should wash.|`|4XlWLeSsaa	squirt soap on er   then throw bucket of water on...hose and repeat..should be lots of time to talk by then..or..shut up jerk..P.H|`|MEr99qKraa	IM SURE THERES THINGS UR FREIND WUD LIKE U TO CHANGE ABOUT U ..BUT IT AIN'T GONNA HAPPEN ..I SUGGEST U EITHER ACCEPT IT OR DROP HER ..AS SHE SEEMS TO BE HAPPY WITH IT BUT UR NOT|`|bQ2RWRGNaa	yeah, this sounds like this girl i know, she always comes smelling especially of vaginal fluids. her breath is ever so horrible. i tried to offer her one piece of gum but i thought,breath like hers may actually need the whole packet. this was a new packet so i thought, id rather not.lol|`|ECv2QGYdaa	well other than the alternate root of just shoving her under a shower and throwing soap at her hoping the message will get across... id probably get a couple friends together and make sure their in on it and casually one day when you guys are all together one day with miss.dirtykins start talking about YOUR guyss showering habits and be all like"uggghhhhh i cant stand not taking a shower every day, i just need one or else i get really embarrassed that i look greasy or that i smell funny...." something along those lines.... just make sure everbody says that stuff about THEMSELVES and not directly to her and hopfully shell get the hint...

Well Elloit triest to make up the sexiest idea for jd and her that night and she is freaking out because she cant think of anything.     In the end the sexiest thing was elloit not doing anything special and just being in her "cookie pants"|`|r1D9P4Vyaa	This is a tough one to pull off but, A very nice formal dinner, late one, then to return home,You have to get many candles burning in the bedroom, rose pedals all over the bed and she is wearing something sexy, all with out him knowing,  then call him in. SURPRISE! I would never forget something like that one!  Just a thought. Good Luck!|`|bkN1bBTXaa	if he has some mail id's ...    then you create an id with new name and start to chat with hi m ... in chatting ask him aabout his like's make him to be frank with you .. know it all ... but he dont know that .. you are that X ..    so you can give him a gift .. which he told you in chat's..    surprise him....    hmm...happy ending :)|`|UldvbAIWaa	well guys dont really same aw this is so romantic... they are romantic so its kinda weird...? lol sorry|`|eZQ45iDzaa	Congradulations!

Assuming you aren't talking about clothing...in which case a nice dress with thigh highs or nylons (not pantyhose) would be the thing.  We like low light, candle light, a little fragrance (no flowery - reminds us of a funeral), a nice scent like vanilla or peach, cherry.  Soft music is good.  Lots of pillows on the couch....very light snacks...fruit, cheese, crackers...and some romantic touching....arms, neck etc.  A nice hug and some kisses.  I don't think it's all that much different.|`|koBg973yaa	Try to surprise him. get dressed up and have his favorite meal made for him when he comes home from work. Give him a nice shoulder rub of something like that. i'm sure most guys appreciate that stuff. i know i do. i dont usually think that the whole candle light thing is that great. its just dark so maybe stay away from that. i dunno how much that helps but its just what i think works.  :)
MQowfPbOaa	i don't mind sensitive guys, but that can't be too sensitive... they have to be tough with feelings|`|DH0CcjGiaa	well they are the ones who listen to you when you need it. they are also there when you need someone. i like guy who are sensitive.|`|eO4y3m1maa	Everyone has their own type, some girls like tough guys..some girls like sensitive guys....|`|kWAyxBFhaa	most sensitive guys are mad annoying!  they need to be tough and funny and kind of bad...ya know???  i mean i guess they need to be a little bit sensative i guess?|`|nX5whEkOaa	hot of course
421faa989173ca07ac313e375ee8cfc1aa	I would leave them a hint one at a time and let them figure it out after I've known them for a while.|`|n0ZYoi2Gaa	I'd try to be friends with him or something.  Get to know him.  Maybe he looks nice but turns out to be a jerk.  If you're already friends then try to drop hints for him.  Flirt a little bit every now and then.  Just try to be cool and act confident.  Most importantly, don't be shy.|`|RvddYKqjaa	Why not just talk to him? Say hi and start talking about something. The best time is when you are close enough to say hi to him. Why are these things so planned? Just be friendly and see if it goes anywhere. .|`|JwD8kxpaaa	Just be straight up and tell them your feelings. :]|`|G04Z75qPaa	tell him!  take a risk!  might turn out that he likes you too.  guys are often a bit shy.|`|aUDVBmZSaa	Well personal story here, I'm a guy and the girl I liked gave me the biggest hint and so I asked her out. What she did was he grabbed my hand and didn't really let go until a while and she gave me a really suggestive smile and I actually got that hint.|`|Z8Gzb331aa	Hints are always good, but make them subtle but not too much as the crush might not notice..  Best time to do it, somewhere quiet and private, so you wont get any interruptions from friends/family for example.  Don't do it right away, get to know them better, as you might not like their personality etc. Do it when you have a feeling that the crush feels the same about you, good luck!
u2rDNTPEaa	start with "hello" and "how are you". maybe see if she wants to hang out with you and a group of friends (girls and guys). if she plays sports, talk about that. talk movies, tv, science class. really anything. the world is your oyster. haha good luck and dont stress yourself out over this. if you relax, she'll enjoy talking to you.|`|AA12225497	Be confident and start by asking her how she is doing.  Then move on into another general conversation.  Ask her how her day went and what did she do?  If she gives detail, then good branch out from those details.    It's all stepping stones upon a mountain, you start at the bottom and then continue your way to the top.|`|GdV0q2J1aa	Well if you can text then text her because you can't mess up with texting! If she dosen't reply don't keep testing her because she will think your a stocker. If she dose reply with just hi or hey ask her if she has plans or if she wants to go to a party.always give her complaments, like you looked great today! But don't constsntly talk to her cuz that would be weird! Hope this helps!
590dd2748ce32b631e9dced7f91686e3aa	its pretty simple that he used you and now he is bored and wants someone else.since he was only attached to you and didnt loved you but only used you for sex as you said,then im sure he wont call you as he wants you out of his life.he did what he wanted to do with you and now you are of no use to him.please forget that jerk.|`|OBbuiqZ3aa	The sad thing about it is he will try to talk to you again..  when he wants to get in your pants again.     When he doesn't feel like "romancing" someone else he'll come back to you because it'll be easy. or at least it was in the past.    Just ignore him and move on.|`|TZCzjpGmaa	this is very general behaviour.....    he has got what he wanted........    he will comeback, if he needs sex again, and does not get it else where...    cheers :)

He may have lost interest because all of a sudden you were easy to get.    Flirt with some other guys, don't make a scene of it...but maybe he'll think you were leading HIM on. see how he likes it...    good luck :)|`|NUR1waitaa	he used you because you let him  so yes he will be back when he wants someone to boost his ego  and you will be there like a door mat  harsh answer but true|`|fvw5JWAsaa	Yep when he wants something.  But he seems like trouble to me leave him alone|`|HNPOO56Raa	he will talk to you again... give it time i am going though the same thing sex in all... he is just trying to see if you still like him and he is testing you to see if you get jealous... you are a girl so of course you are going to be... but don't let him know... he is just being a jerk and if he really likes you then he will get mad if you start talking to a new guy so do that and see what happens     but don't hurt the other girl in the process....

nMzzwrtUaa	I know its hard to deal with i have dealt with it my self and honestly i did things wrong when i tried coping with it. Now that i look back i would of done things allot better. What i suggest you take your wife and your kids to go see him and you all spend about 2weeks with him take tons of pictures and talk about every thing you can think of. At this point he is ok with passing and is not afraid. That should give you some comfort, Also take time for your self and think back on life and how you and your father where (forget all the bad things that's happened) Yes its possible for him to have a little more time left its all up to his body and his will.  You don't need to tell your children at this point if there still young under 5 years old then its best that don't fully know whats going on.  <br>  <br>  When i went threw this whole thing i got angry, then i got sad, while the whole time i was pushing my wife and child away to shell my self from the world i dealt with things like a child would throwing a fit. My father all he wanted was to see my family again and when i finally climbed out of that shell and took my last 3 days off to go see him with my family I wish i would of had more time to just talk to him and take pictures. I lost all that time and when we where driving home we got the news he had passed away. I suggest you allow your wife to help you and look towards your childern for strength and if your afraid look towards your father he does not seem to be afraid one bit. You have to accept the fact there is very little you can do. You can also see if you can be a donar (you can donate a part of your liver if you can be a donar). If you need some one to talk to thats been threw this as well please feel free to email me at irish_lad_921@yahoo.com (my father passed due to lung cancer)|`|j2yLjm6Naa	In the spring of last year my sister was diagnosed with Lukemis, I know that this is not fatal but I know how you feel about trying to cope. I'm not trying to say that it is gonna be easy, but one of the things that anoyed me the most was people that told me that they KNEW what I was going through, I hated this because they didn't one woman actuallt told me to stop crying that everything was gonna be ok, if this wouldn't anoy u I don't know what would. THEY DON'T KNOW HOW YOU FEEL UNLESS THEY HAVE GONE THROUGH IT...... 1 of the things that helped me to cope was leaning on Jesus for He is stronger than any human on earth that we could lean on, His arm are always open when we need a place to run. I actually on occasion could almost feel His arms around me telling me that He was therre. That is the biggest thing that I can tell you to do.|`|XlhBBZPxaa	I am so sorry for you having to go through this but just let your kids and you spend as much time with your father as possible until it is time|`|HK30PzNraa	I lost my dad to colon/liver cancer when I was 15.He too decided that after one round of chemo that didn't help that he wanted to die peacefully at home.The best way to deal with it is GOD.He is the only true comfort a person can have in times like these.I would spend as much time with your dad as possible,and include your kids.Explain to them that grandpa is not going to be living here anymore after a while and always be there to comfort them.Be honest if the kids are older.My MIL has cancer right now,my older kids know exactly what is going on(13 and 11)my youngest (8)just knows that granny is very sick.So sorry about this,GOD-bless|`|djUMvICoaa	You have alot on your plate right now. so let's go with the important one, your dad, right?  Parents are pretty forgiving aren't they?  Your dad might not have thought too much of what went on or the time that passed, but we on the other end, especially when it's hooked to news like that become acutely aware of time.  It's easy to beat ourselves up too, but don't.  But I think you need to take time and see him for a weekend by yourself,  You need time to talk with him, share with him and let him share with you.  It seems you are both in a better place now then you were before and these things can become easier because of that.  This time you spend with him should help put things a little more at ease for your wedding, you should be able to feel that your dad is happy with where you are in life.  Is that a big part of grief for us that we didn't disappoint our parents?  Sorry I never put it that way before. Wow.  Maybe if that makes sense then you can talk to him about where you are in life and where you are going.  Hearing we have our parents approval meant so much growing up, I'm sure it will have the same feeling now.  I guess that's the coping part the how long is to the guy upstairs, it don't hurt to talk to him a little either.  And don't the kids already know something is wrong with grandpa?  They should have been told when you knew it, just that grandpa has cancer.  Now you have to give them the whole story and there's some more guilt for you that you didn't tell them  sooner.  Just  go to them and tell them, that's all you can do.  "I didn't know how to tell you before but now I have to.....|`|ef900587f42a3006a5209f45881cb638aa	Wow reading your story I feel like I wrote it...I too have not talked to my dad for a few years over a big misunderstanding and now it has taken him being in the hospital with colon cancer to bring us together and I am not sure how to cope....well here is what I am doing...I am trying to be there for my dad and cherish the moments that I am with him.....I am not saying it is easy but I would not show your dad that you are sad.....show him a smile and be glad you still have time with him|`|AP2e90cCaa	Regardless of the history between you and your father, just be there for him, love him and validate him.<br>  <br>  Tell your kids the truth.
sr0vZPQqaa	Yea that's what friends do.|`|3yWAyps4aa	it depends on how he says it, as it could be playful, just go along with it if your interested
AA10529674	if you like him and he's been sending clues that he likes you, then go for it. I don't see why not.|`|MdSDlnfcaa	It depends on the dynamic between the two of you, but I would say go for it!  Flirting is fun and it doesn't always have to be serious.  Just respond to what your friend does.  If you think he's feeling awkward, be aware and maybe let him know you're not being that serious, just having fun.  Good luck!|`|BPqK0c5taa	Yea nothing wrong with flirting. Are you just messing around though or do you actually like him.|`|6Zr73g7zaa	Totally! Recent studies show that most best friends end up falling for eachother. Go for it :)|`|BL4PEjAWaa	flirting is part of being single.  Have fun and be safe.
tXs2meLPaa	You should see how the week goes first, get to know them better and then ask them. Think about their behavior towards you and then consider asking them or not.|`|sr0vZPQqaa	You'd better see if they offer it to you first. If so then yes ask,they can't expect you to travel back and forth.|`|aeptkU9Waa	I would instead of ask them, offer to them to house sit! While you are there for the week, tell them something like "I just wanted to make sure your house is covered for the week you are gone, i dont mind house sitting and getting acquainted with everything for you while youre out of town if you need someone to do that, it will save me money from getting back and forth" Do this when you feel comfortable with them enough to offer it! It will come across as more of you trying to look out for them and think ahead then asking them to save money! Good luck!

AiM31dMyaa	Join a group and meet someone<br>  with similar interests
0AShsMsoaa	200 people is a grand wonderful wedding.  i hope i can help you have a happy feeling about it. <br>  <br>  a wedding is a family affair.  in  many families especially if the parents are paying, it is a way to bring family and friends together for a once in a lifetime event.  in some families this is the only chance they have to thank people for inviting them to their events.  it is super important for parents to have their friends at these events, and, when you get older yourself, you will better understand how important it is for extended family to be brought together.  for your parents this is super important. <br>  <br>  i guarantee that if you embrace this, that you will enjoy yourself.  you are not not not expected to socialize with everyone.  at most weddings like this i have attended, the bride and groom go around to each and every table one time right after dinner and greet each person at the table in a general way, saying,thank you for coming.  your mother and dad will also do a lot of socializing, and it will all work out. i also guarantee you will have a lot of time to dance. <br>  <br>  i would like to put in a vote of support for your parents plans, and, in years to come you will be so happy you did include everyone, who will now include you and your husband.  really.  <br>  <br>  in  my experience, people who are slighted for no real good reason never ever forget and will happily spend the rest of their lives excluding you from family events like you excluded them.  as you get older, you will hear of anniversaries, weddings and birthdays  you are not invited to, but everyone else is, and that is why.|`|DCXss6Odaa	You will be spending all your time with these non important people.<br>  It's your day, if your willing to sacrifice some of your evening.<br>  Sounds like your not happy about it. Say something before you regret it...<br>  <br>  Good luck<br>  x|`|2kl0vQjVaa	Keep in mind that most of these people you haven't seen in forever or distant relatives won't show.  Since your parents are footing the bill they kind of do have a say so in who they invite.  Good luck.|`|6UmRmaeWaa	Yes ma'am I am experiencing this right now! I am near 250 when I was going to stop at 150. I keep running into people that are like oh yeah we will see you guys at the wedding...Im going great make sure i get them on the list!<br>  <br>  Tell the family you cut off! I am going to make a few invitations that I send out to invite guest who are not that close for cocktails and dancing at the reception. This way the older folks will leave and the more "partying" type will come for the drinks.<br>  <br>  I don't care if that is tacky either...my wedding and I gotta do what I gotta do!<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|R7b150Iyaa	You have to have an open and frank discussion with your parents.  I understand your dilemma, because technically they ARE being generous by footing the bill, so you can't really complain about that.  At the same time, it is YOUR wedding day and they are completely changing the kind of day you envisioned for yourself.<br>  <br>  Tell them that while you love them and truly appreciate their help and support, your wedding day is becoming something that you are not looking forward to because it is completely changing what you originally envisioned.  Ask them to please not invite any more people, and tell them what you told us: that if you haven't seen people in 5 years, you highly doubt they will be offended.  OR offer to have another, smaller reception after your honeymoon (just a dinner at a restaurant or something) for all the extra guests that weren't able to be invited to your wedding.<br>  <br>  Good luck and congratulations!|`|sGP6s7uraa	Your parents are paying so this could get tricky.  I would talk to them and tell them your exact feelings about this.  Tell them that this is your day, too, and you really, really want this to be intimate.  Tell them they shouldn't care about "hurting" people's feelings. I've had to tell my fiance this time and time again and he has finally got it.  Just talk to them.  I have been to weddings were the bride and groom did not make their "rounds" to me and have not been offended by it.  You could do the same.  Let people come to you.  So what if you're on the dance floor grindin' with your hubby.|`|TSmego9vaa	Girl I know how you feel, I went through the same thing I told my parents listen there is only so much room,and I dont talk to most of these people. I had the manager of the place defend me also. Hope this helps.|`|D9ufwiMXaa	This is what happened to me and my husband at each of our parents have 7+ siblings each! The list got longer and longer every time I turned around when it was all said and done we sent out 257 invites.<br>  First just talk to your parents and tell them how you are feeling, they can send out letters or e-mails to their estranged friends just announcing that you are getting married and not have to necessarily invite them.<br>  2nd: remember that not everyone you invite is going to come, and not everyone who RSVPs will show either<br>  of the 257 invites we sent we got back 180 RSVPs and only 140 came to the wedding. <br>  <br>  Good luck|`|k9uspUrTaa	Try talking to your parents about the issue and tell them in a nice way that it is your wedding..so you should be able to do what you want. And be able to invite and not invite who you want. Tell them your feelings about not wanting to be obligated to socialize with people that you just want to be able relax and have fun. <br>  Remember its YOUR DAY not your parents!
VFdC2wPlaa	Maybe your not making enough time for her anymore. It can be annoying when a sister gets a boyfriend.... and never has time to just chill with you anymore. That could really affect how she feels towards him.
YXVA3MpZaa	It is unlikely that super-sensitive and vulnerable Pisces will find the dreamy sort of love life they seek with the outgoing, roaming Sagittarius who is liable to loathe the commitment that Pisces needs. <br>  With luck and perseverance they may find happiness together, however, it will take a lot more than compromise to keep these signs joined for long.<br>  <br>  Good luck..|`|0fVtHNtmaa	You'd get better responses in the horoscopes section.|`|EyaqiWPwaa	depends on the sandwich she makes|`|Lb15XHvBaa	Go with chemistry not astronomy

Is to become a better parent, daughter, son, sibling, or friend? Each individual has their own specific purpose in this lifetime. Although we are all living for eternal happiness in God’s Kingdom, you need to find your inner purpose and allow it to shine. Whatever your purpose is, have faith and believe that God will allow you to utilize it to its full capacity. I was completely lost, and in darkness he ransomed me. We as individuals need to realize that we will never have complete happiness if we do not open our hearts to God and change. Like one of my closest friend say’s it best (“Change is good, it helps us Grow”)<br>  <br>  I used to believe that decisions had consequences, now I understand that God never allows us to go thru changes that we can’t overcome. I have been thru many unforeseen changes in my life, and yet I have managed to get thru each and everyone of them. Now, when I reflect back on my past experiences, I realize that it wasn’t nearly as bad as I had consumed it to be.<br>  <br>  You wonder what my purpose is… Well after some soul searching and much praying… I realized that my purpose is to have a closer relationship with God and to become the best role model I can be for my daughter Najalie. In order for me to continue to accomplish “My Purpose” I need to live my life in a way that obeys God’s Laws.<br>  <br>  So now I ask that if you took the time to read this post, please take the time to think about what your purpose for life is. Find your inner self and look at all the positive things in your life as oppose to all the things you want or wish you had. You can have all your desire fulfilled and still feel emptiness, that’s because you are still missing something.. Could it be God and Faith that you are missing? <br>  <br>  Remember Happiness is not having the things you want but rather wanting the things you have.. <br>  <br>  Arlene|`|wR3cwcXWaa	honey....start by praying to God.

djUMvICoaa	You don't like the job you now have.  The new one looks better.  The pay is less, can you live on that?  You have been in a relationship since you were 17, that's kind of young, but you are asking the right questions now.  I would suggest you live together in a rental first.  Sometimes things happen when you're under one roof you don't see when you have time apart.   It kind of plays into your question if you should take this step, if you have any reservations at all, I would figure out what they are and why they are there.  Is something telling you it's not what you want to do?   Also, at least if you have one job and there isn't much advance to look for you can always look for another job.  Just be careful in this economy, a job can be there today but gone tomorrow.  good luck

You are not going to be 16 forever.  You've got to be able to support yourself and I'm sure you have some type of dream in life.  You should look at getting your GED, then going into the military.  They will provide you with some training and help with your education.  Sometimes just getting away from our family and people we think are our friends at 16 can create a world of difference in our lives.  If you really want to change, make some calls to social services or talk to a recruiter.  It sounds like you need to feel some hope in your life and some feelings of self worth.  I don't know you, but everyone in life deserves happiness.

vwOcFXgcaa	Alright, I myself used to dislike babies (well, I still do. Although I would NEVER hurt them, just don't hand me one.) But then we had our kids, and ALL that changed.<br>  <br>   Some of what your BF does sounds like what I used to do. A lot of it, actually. Only I used to blame the military.<br>  <br>    My wife put up with it for 12 years and then we divorced. How much of YOUR life are you willing to waste before you get tired and walk?<br>  <br>    We did work it out and remarried, but we could have saved all that drama. <br>  <br>   As far as you wanting your kid to know the dad. . . very novel idea but maybe you should introduce them to someone who WANTS to be their dad?<br>  <br>    hey, that's just my opinion.|`|KRZ8JsbUaa	If your BF doesn't become a more active parent now, your child will want very little or nothing at all to do with him when he is older. (a toddler). Parent/child relationships and bonds start very early on and your BF should be informed of this. I think a parenting class that you both take together would be a good start. Your mother needs to butt out. She needs to be there for you if you need her, but this is the father of your son. Think of your son's feelings, then yours. Your mother is an adult and will get over it. The BF doesn't sound like he is very mature, however that doesn't make him a bad person. Have a talk with him about the newborn issue. They are more "tough" than what most people think.|`|ed9c52fcc32bc21499c8007eec999f5faa	There is no guarantee that boyfriend will become more active as the child gets older, *and* in my opinion, it seems to be much more than him being 'scared' of babies.  If it was mere fear (which, by the way, a mature person would be able to deal with) he wouldn't be making 'irritated comments' when you ask him to get you something for the child.  In my opinion, it's not just fear, it’s that he’s not ready to be a father (something you should have figured out before you had a child with him).  He’s good with nieces and nephews because they aren’t *his* children, and therefore his involvement is limited to occasional interaction and no responsibilities.  <br>  <br>  But even *if* he overcomes that, it still leaves the issues of financial immaturity (very, very hard to deal with) and a short temper, which many people never overcome, and in many cases it gets worse over time.<br>  <br>  But you're tempted to stay simply so the child will 'know his father'?  When he's ready to be a father, he can know the child rather they’re living in the same home or not, and until he’s ready to be a father, then merely 'being there' isn’t going to make a difference. <br>  <br>  You need to give this some serious thought.  And don’t base your decision on the wrong criteria.

eawDlYHnaa	I think sometimes that men are scared of relationships and what they could be getting them or their kids into again. He probably does have interest in you but is still scared to pursue it. If he wanted to take you out to lunch and saying that you two should go out again, it looks like their might be a real chance. just remember to hang in there because he might not yet be prepared to start another serious relationship again so you should take things slow.|`|34b40Vu3aa	He knows you really like him and so has no desire to put forth any effort.  Try not to be so obvious, don't be there when he calls, have other plans, etc.  You are so available that the same exact thing is going to happen again and 10 months from now you will be on here asking the same thing.

ELSKfMpxaa	Ignore the "get a fat chick" guy. You seem to have a nice personality. I've only ever dated 1 thin guy. Just like there are some guys that like fat chicks, there are girls that like big guys. I think bigger guys are more cuddle-able, their clothes are much more fun to wear :P and they're typically more fun to be around. If you're going to the gym that much I give you massive cudos for trying. Whatever you do though, if you get down to your ideal weight, don't use it as an excuse to become a jerk. that's always a sad thing to see. <br>  <br>  For any ladies that might be reading this and think I'm nuts.. you ever hear the saying "fat chicks try harder" ?? It's true for guys too :P<br>  <br>  Edit: Sorry - have a habit of dancing around the point without directly stating the answer. As sweet as you sound I know you'll get a girl, just continue to be sweet, be outgoing, and being funny never hurts either.|`|AcARmgG1aa	ya man, of coarse yo can|`|tqfkHiEQaa	big girls need lovin' too.|`|YG4VMafEaa	For a lot of girls, size would get in the way to be honest.

Are you going to be going out with the most popular chicks? No, once people get into the social elite, they become more and more shallow as time goes on.<br>  <br>  But can you get a date?  Sure, as long as you are confident and respectful.  When you are talking to a girl, just be yourself.  Stop thinking about trying to impress them, or worrying about getting rejected.  Just be who you are, this will help keep you comfortable. If you don't have any girls floating around your social circle, get a friend to introduce you to someone.<br>  <br>  You will find a date, it may take time, but it will happen.   Your biggest hindrance here is not your physical appearance but your self esteem, and likely lack of practice in social situations.  <br>  <br>  Keep working out, and work on expanding your social circle.  And don't be afraid to approach a girl you don't know well.  One advantage of being in high school is the wealth of common interests you will have with your classmates.  Use that to start conversations.  Talk about a class you share together, or a game or social event coming up.  Find a girl who likes the same music you do, or does some of the same afterschool activities you do.<br>  <br>  In the end though, just don't stress about it.  I'm a big guy myself.  I was a slow starter in highschool, untill my junior year.  And things only got better after I moved on to college and beyond.|`|3F5yBpRyaa	you sound really sweet! There is a girl for every guy out there, especially the sweet ones! Just be patient for the right girl to come your way. Keep it up on goin to the gym, you sound like your doing great!!|`|Arw6OmVtaa	Yes just because your fat doesnt mean you cant get a girl. Just be fun, nice, etc etc. Confidence is a big thing as well. gotta have that swag|`|BURVqkrNaa	If you feel great with your body and feel confident and you are NICE and GENTLEMAN (this always works), you'll be ok. Trust me.|`|dp0B5ixuaa	get a fat chick|`|2bC0dvPKaa	Don't focus solely on getting a girl right away. First of all start by just being friendly and outgoing to people, showing them what a nice guy you are. Work on building friendships, and having an overall good demeanor. That paired with self-confidence will make you stand out to people, and you'll have a good chance of meeting somebody special who you'll like and who will like you in return. <br>  <br>  Some girls won't be able to see beyond outward appearance, but others will care more about whether you're nice and fun to be around, and whether or not they feel that you genuinely like them. If you make a person feel liked and accepted, then it's likely they will like and accept you in return.|`|G1zxlAQEaa	Some girls are shallow and they only date guys who look a certain way or they're in a certain clique.  You just have to know where you stand and be comfortable within that zone.  If a girl does not like you for who you are then she's not worth the time trying to convince her otherwise.  She may come around someday, but don't waste your time waiting on her.   Also don't come across as if you're looking to find a girl just to have a girlfriend.   Unfortunately one of those cold, hard realities are there are some girls you really don't stand a chance with, but most of them wouldn't be a lot of fun anyway.   It's much better to be with someone who you're comfortable around and you can have fun with.|`|xzX3NSUjaa	You will be able to get a girl, as long as she isn't shallow. There are many women who don't care about looks. A great personality and sense of humor will always win over looks & body. There are actually women who prefer bigger guys. You just have to find the right girl. Just be yourself..girls like a guy who isn't phony or just trying to impress us.

6bdfee1eacbc3558c6496c4875ee0f69aa	No and that goes both ways. A successful adult is not only successful because of their parents.|`|AA12198711	No, they are adults and able to make decisions for them self.|`|lGdzb8aqaa	no but you would be surprised as to how many people still blame their parents for their own mistakes.|`|EQydFhzmaa	No, but my mother has done it. It really takes an emotional toll on their children; it can effect their physical (weight gain, cutting) and mental states as well. Parents had their children, if they didn't want them, they should have gotten an abortion, or given them up for adoption so another family could love and take care of them (although there are many children that don't get adopted).|`|SR1FN2nqaa	no way. i ve dont my job as a parent and still have my grown son living with me. i talk to him all the time and try to give him life advise, what he does with it is up to him.|`|XQj0L6zCaa	no|`|b23ac589c655b9f48a90e2fb2ffe9f58aa	yeah sure|`|vrFBkvKeaa	No, no matter what you went through as a child there comes a point when you must take responsibility for yourself and you actions.  You can only blame others for so long.|`|Vm2ywW5Caa	Absolutely not. After a certain age, a parent has to let go and hope that their child will take their advice and be responsible, and go on to live productive adult lives.|`|ccnH77SOaa	No, by a certain age children understand their actions and what they are doing.
CjFQJ0Xxaa	It seems like you don't know her well enough and if you don't have time to get to know her, you probably don't have time to go out with her either.  Also, she is a senior and it might seem like she likes you, but it could just be her personality, i don't think you know her well enough to tell. Sorry, if you really like her that much though, the only way to find out if she likes you would be to ask.|`|QCa4Pffqaa	just go up to her, start talking, bump in to her if you have to.<br>  then ask her what is she doing friday or the weekend.<br>  and tell her you tw should go out.|`|7PJbQSTEaa	you shouldn't do this because A. there's a big age difference and B. you said yourself you don't really know her.

ftOe1SBAaa	YES she is deffinately interested, if she wasnt she wouldnt have taken the time to ask. <br>  And maybe not ask her if she wants to "hangout" instead you could say, "would you like to go grab a bite to eat"? or "do you want to get a cup of coffee with me"? Something along those lines instead of asking "hey you wanna hangout"? <br>  Good luck! (:|`|NZg4hIrYaa	it depends on you fancy her or not, why not see her again if you like her, talk to her what you want and what you don't.  make it simple ok
izQn53q2aa	You can still do counseling, you don't need her for that.  It sounds like you have some issues that need worked out with a therapist.  Most likely the problem really isn't with the relationship, but perhaps with something that's happened in your life.  If you weren't this way before then something happened that caused the change.  Try to pin point exactly when you became controlling.  Then, look at the events in your life around that time.  See if anything jumps out at you.  Hopefully something will and perhaps you'll know where to start looking for the problem.  Seriously, some light counseling for you may be beneficial.

RDxwA15kaa	I got my first girlfriend at 21. Ironically, she appeared just when I stopped looking and caring, just like people say. The thing is, she wasnt the right one for me, and its harder to go back to being single after a failed relationship, believe me, im just like you, no real friends and not many prospects in the ladies department. Funnily enough, I dont care if im not in a relationship right now, im alot more concerned with getting over the pain and forgetting my ex. Its not easy. Dont write yourself off. Even if you are unconfident and everything else most women dont want, love is a funny thing, and sometimes people fall for you because they get a glimpse past all those things. I am shy, not very good looking and intoverted, my ex was the opposite of all those things. So, you never know, itll happen when it happens.|`|IVsUfHENaa	when the time is past you will find a Friend but it is good to do some thing for your self now.call some one You think she is good for you and want her for a death,jut try if it is not work ,not work ,do it again .don't worry and try with anther one .finally you will find some one be her for you .good luke|`|WN6tWLdYaa	I'm sure your not that bad looking. but maybe you should get involved in something. go places where you can meet people. when you see someone then go up to them and say hi.

As long as you get involved you'll be fine.|`|9FyxeA1Zaa	You need to pick a style and sort out your life for the better! (In a good way)     As in join some clubs, socialise with poeple!   I don't have many friends either. However i do have some very close friends that i couldnt live without!     As for girls the whole "wait and she will magicly appear" attitude never happens, if you like a girl youve gotta go for it just because if you don't your left standing there wondering!     You just need to build your personality, find a hobby/club (RUGBY?) meet new people, socialise, hang out.|`|pUUyYz4gaa	People like people who are nice, friendly, cordial, and are caring.  That's a start.  Women like men who are self confident (by that I mean men who understand their strengths and weaknesses and are always looking to improve themselves).      Communication and relationships are give and take.  The more you give the more you receive.      The first thing I would do if I were you would be to make a point to say "hi" to at least three women/day.  They don't have to be women you are attracted to, they could be the mail lady, a clerk behind a counter, etc.  You need to get used to talking to the opposite sex, and if a conversation occurs...go with it.  Women are not monsters, although sometimes they act like it, they are just as insecure as men...IMO even more so.     Pretty soon you will start a conversation with a woman, then you will feel comfortable enough to continue a conversation via over the phone on email, then you will be dating.    But it all starts with hello.|`|92n42vksaa	By focusing on all these things you're turning yourself into someone with a very negative outlook on life. Try focusing on something outside of yourself (like helping other people, a career, or an interest apart from analysing yourself all day and finding faults). Do things that make you feel good and happy. When you meet a girl you like (you cant have even seen anyone you want as a girlfriend yet if every person is 'a user or a liar'), then you can worry about if she likes you back. Noone is going to want to be with you as you are now, because you're too focused on yourself, your own needs and problems (that are probably just in your head) which is very draining in a relationship. I think the problem is just your attitude. Everything else you have probably got more of than you think. eg you say you cant do humour but your question made me laugh (sorry!)|`|9gvxaYyNaa	awww..... and your question is?|`|Rn7zkS52aa	You need to get yourself out there and get confidence! Join a gym and start working out and meeting other guys there. Gradually you will relax and you can talk to some of them! Do you have a job, are you in school? Join a club at your college that interests you and make a point to talk to people. It can be scary at first, but you HAVE to put yourself out there or you will be miserable forever. Usually people think people will react alot less nicely to them then people actually do.    Go get a haircut! Go to a nice place, it'll make you feel better about your looks. Go buy a new outfit to reinvent yourself. Express, Abercrombie, Urban Outfitters, and Guess are all places in a good price range for a guy your age. At your job, go out of your comfort zone and just talk to people.     The worst thing you can do is sit around. The best thing you can do is put yourself out there, get involved in things you like, and force yourself to talk to others. Give people a chance! The key to confidence is if you pretend and act like you have it, eventually it will come. Doing things you like and being around people with similiar interests and feeling better about your appearance will make you come off more confident.     You are stuck only if you continue to do what you are doing.|`|8EnlSE93aa	you dont have to be good looking to get a tidy girlfriend.  good looking boys get heartless shallow girlfriends.  you probably do have personality you just need to bring it out of you.  im much younger than you but i know how it feels. i never used to have any confidence and would get nervous over the slightest things. i realised that once i found a group of friends i liked and got along with, and ditched the ones who peed me off, that i had more confidence to stand up for what i believe in.  also, since im older and i go out drinker more, i have come out of my shell. go out drinking with a friend or relative and you will see that when you drink you are more talkative and meet more people. just make more of an effort instead of hiding away and shutting yourself off from everything.|`|jgxDtWawaa	You only live once, so make the most of it. Go out and get some hobbys. Once u start talking to people, conversation will come easily. The key to getting friends and or a girlfrend is socialsing. Girls dont like to much confidence, cus that makes a guy look cocky. So jus be urself and try to socialise as much as u can xx|`|B66Jeq6Baa	just from reading this i can tell you most definitely do NOT have the personality of a plank of wood.  the whole "she'll appear thing" well, i've never believed in there being ONE person for everyone..and usually, if you're looking to hard, you don't see anyone.  confidence is something that you give to your partner a lot of the time, so most girls will not be so unreasonable to expect you to be incredibly confident from the word go.  and have you ever considered that maybe you're quite fussy with women yourself? i wouldn't know, but if you haven't asked many, you wont really know if you can get them.  But seriously, everyone can find love, its out there, its not always perfect/convenient/when you're expecting/who you're expecting, but it'l happen when it happens.  until then, work on getting some self esteem up hun, whether you think so or not,you have good traits, and they'll be a lot more noticible to everyone else once you can see them.|`|jiXQ8eDFaa	Take baby steps. Strive, for a while, to just have pleasant interactions with people. No agenda. Just small talk. When you get better at that, strive to cultivate some friendships. Go to a bar, a coffee shop, a comic book convention, a bookstore, an online dating site, wherever you feel fairly comfortable. Chat with people. Suggest that you hang out sometime. Then follow up on it. Call, e-mail, and be specfic: not "We should get together sometime," but "I was thinking of seeing Seven Pounds tonight, would you like to come?" Movies are good, they give you something to discuss even if you're not good at small talk. LISTEN. Listen, be sincere, ask questions. People love to talk about themselves, and as you get them to open up, you can find common ground and inside jokes and let chemistry develop on its own. Sincerity and being a good listener are two things that you didn't include on your list, and those are two things that you can learn to cultivate if you don't already have - as well as two of the most valued qualities from a woman's perspective. Got a dog? Go to the dog park. They're chick magnets.|`|UUuJoHbjaa	For every bad person there is two nice people!!!!!! It's very rare for a person to have all these traits you speak of!!!!! This magical woman won't just come to your house in d words of my mother princesses don't make house calls lol get out their and meet ppl join a local football team ect.... You don't want to head straight into a relationship make friends first get to know women first,, she is out their it will just take some time to find her but u will have fun doing it:) best of luck tho xx|`|f951f9682544ed39d137484af7997a46aa	All the stuff you decided to include in your question are not important at all! Whoever wants to be with you would like you for who you are. Waiting does have some truth to it. I waited for what seemed like an eternity, but i finally met the one for me last year and we've been stuck on each other ever since! And I didnt have a bf since 11th grade and I was a junior in college when I met him. When you find or meet that person, all the time that you have been waiting will make sense...i'll be 23 in april if that makes you feel better! :) I was 21 when I met him.
o0mwF5kFaa	HE might if he realizes she's easy, and he wanted to know his self worth, or was insecure or something. Girls do it too, so don't get all high and toity, either. Though this is pretty rare for guys to do.  ==|`|ccb402364f76559985af31b2ece8e3ccaa	no...most guys won't waste their time on girls they don't like.|`|F9Wqp5YMaa	no, he wouldnt effort if he was not interested|`|aUDVBmZSaa	Cause he wanted to ask you something? This is a really broad question.|`|LLgLPEPUaa	He might be just interested in you.|`|WLWojBO4aa	yes we do. its mental thing guys have , that they need to prove to them selves that they can get any girl they want, so even if they dont like you they might still try hard to prove to them selves that they can get you if they want. but most the time its not like this , if hes trying relaly really hard then he probably likes you|`|9gvxaYyNaa	no|`|Z11jZXOmaa	to be annoying and to prove he can get girls.|`|O2d1XQPwaa	yeah some people are just attention hogs in genreal
467145608db35ec4ccc89f1b16418af6aa	uhm, he's nothing special... =/  and hasn't your friend seen the guy before...  o_0.|`|AbAHhcwiaa	if you are friends then she should belive you and not some guy shes "dating"|`|cYRZpGkqaa	can't get your link to work|`|alaUYtRcaa	well i cant help you because i dont see how he is fake.. you didnt give any information..|`|smyhq0Ggaa	That's a dodgy link.|`|Z2gHpT8paa	that does look pretty fake but u do need more evidence
AA11909552	I think you should try to make uP with the first guy. Especially because your parents like him. It would be too difficult to try and hide the second guy. Maybe you like the second guy better cos it was easier?
L0Hz227xaa	It sounds like he may miss you as well, but doesent want to discuss getting back together because if he did, he would have further discussed it, or not changed the subject. Because he has done this he probably just wants to continue being cool with you, and thats it. Dont take it personal. If a man wants you, he will put in the time and effort. If not he will show you just enough attention to keep you around. Be friends with him, but continue dating other people until u find someone you really like and likes you back.|`|XAw4cJmjaa	Sounds like he does miss you and enjoys talking with you, but might be a little afraid that you would take that the wrong way and think he wants to get back together. That may be the reason he changes the subject so quickly.|`|8d2dafa2e677fbcd1bf84bcf3389e331aa	i see it as him still having feelings for you but not having the guts to discuss what the next course of action should be. bring it up the next time you talk.|`|umGi6gTcaa	He didn't miss you but felt he had to say that b/c you did. What else could he have said? Ty? That's nice? He spared your feelings and reciprocated. I don't know if he wants to be your friend, you have to look at his overall behavior. Are you the one always calling him? Does he always sound disappointed or greet you with an "oh, hey." Does he make any real effort to be your friend?    It's like when someone tells you they love you, you have 3 choices. Say it and mean it, break their heart or say it but then take it back when you work up the nerve to break their heart.|`|wCqzSt34aa	means he just wants to be friends and has no intentions of pursuing a relationship with u again|`|EvEFW5aQaa	It depends on the situation or what he changed the subject to. You should ask him about it.|`|m7730ZPPaa	It means he doesn't want to be in a relationship with you...    "I miss you" has a slight romantic connotation especially since you were romantically involved. So he could have been just saying "me too" to :    1) Be kind, to spare you feelings  2) genuinely misses you but has no intention of getting back with you.      The fact that he changed the subjects obviously means he doesn't want to talk about it.    Friends and that it.|`|2VtkgzcIaa	He wouldn't talk to you in he didn't want to be friends, but you broke up with him... His ego and feelings are probably very hurt. Do what you need to do to stay close to him (as friends) and give it some time.
vIhA2TE1aa	you saw tha future|`|LLgLPEPUaa	Dreams are a random firing of your brain cells.  So literally when you're asleep your brain starts thinking random thoughts.......therefore it doesn't have any significance to real life.
MAfxZqgzaa	WOW....that's a lot to think about...this is what i would think about.  It's your day...you decide.  If the boyfriend is doing the trip for you he will understand and make it special where you are and when you want you celebration.  I know it is a lot of pressure to try to please a whole bunch of people at once but in reality it is your choice.  If you feel that spending time with him alone ... fine.. Florida is great but if you tell him that you want to spend time with family and friends along with him, he should go with that... if not you know he is planning the trip for himself.  Florida will always be there even if the free condo isn't.  I'm divorced with a teenage daughter.  I talk to her and give her options of what we do for her birthday...when she finally makes a decision I try my best to make it happen so both of us can have a good time.  Last year we went to Disney in Florida.  It cost $5000 for the week but it was well worth the money.  I spent a week with her enjoying the time together.  Doing stuff she wanted to do and stuff I wanted to do... the way it should be but with her choices first...since it was her birthday present from me.  Good luck|`|7VfWz7zyaa	Dont worry about taking a little time off of work.. be ''ill'' those days.   And you can always have your birthday party when you come back.   Have fun :)|`|dd1c8373d258bab9181f891f88ea8dafaa	Why cant you just have the party on the next convenient date with all your friends? Why does the party have to end all together? You dont need a special date to have a special party. If that were the case i'd  never have a happy birthday.     It is ONLY a birthday after all... in the big scheme of things you've have and will have many.    If you really dont like the florida idea, just dont go. Personally I would just die if my husband ever took the time to plan anything, whether it was secretly mostly for him and only just involved me or not. I think it was a wonderful gesture.|`|YgPYv4OPaa	just go . even if you dont want to ..  your friends are gonna be there when you get back , and im sure your boss will understand that your going away ?|`|XAw4cJmjaa	It's your birthday and the 25th birthday is a tough one! I understand both of yalls thoughts on this, but he should have talked to you before making big plans like that on your birthday. I say, do what you want to do. It's YOUR birthday!|`|NnFltKgsaa	you think too much, relax let your boyfriend spoil you, here's a bit of the inside   25th birthdays usually go on for at least a week. In your defence if he was planning a trip that would disrupt your work schedule, he is doing it for his ego and not for you, tell him to put it in an envelope and the two of you can enjoy it another time, when you are more secure in your job.|`|20759ce8e8f715cd4d43fc23bca9a608aa	I think you should have kept your party on Wednesday, despite what your boyfriend wanted. No, I don't think you're selfish.|`|LijKVPUYaa	You should be grateful, he has gone to a lot of bother for you.|`|BbziX8aZaa	No, that doesn't make you selfish. almost every person wants to be with friends and family on their birthday, but I can see him getting upset he might have wanted to do something special for you. If he sees you as ungrateful then in all honesty I would tell him that he's the the one being selfish by not understanding how you feel about this whole situation|`|dA0mJPryaa	i completely understand where you're coming from. that seriously sucks. yea Florida is great. but is you're life is truly surrounded by friends, i think it's not fair to you that you can't spend the day with them. so if you're gonna be in Florida on your birthday and your boyfriend already booked the flight and w/e else, you should probably go to Florida. Maybe there is a party waiting there for you....but if there isn't, then I'm sorry.    best of luck and i hope you're birthday works out better than it's sounding right now.hope you get to keep your job.|`|ff3Gcd5Oaa	You're ungrateful because you don't want to go on a trip you didn't want and didn't ask for?  I think you need a new boyfriend!  He is the one being selfish if he knew how you felt and did the opposite of what you would want.  Tell him you appreciate the thought but you can't get off work to go, and next time he wants a trip he should consult you first.  It's your birthday, don't go on a trip you don't want to, spend it how you please it's not selfish to ask that on your one day of the year, especially on milestone birthdays.  You wouldn't have a good time anyway since you don't want to go.
5AdVt7dEaa	If your name is David, the girls that said she loves you is correct!|`|whPNxAo4aa	well i see alot of people write on there hands 14-- it stands for i love whatever your name is.

When I as a kid in School we used to use 1-4-3 as  I LOVE YOU, "1=I,  4=LOVE,  3=YOU.    I'm not sure about the '5'...(Honey)..?  Maybe your First, 'name'.....|`|92n13q98aa	maybe it's the room number to the hotel room she rented for you two|`|ucZHzLg9aa	Isn't that when Columbus sailed the ocean blue.

We need more information than that.  Have you done anything which could relate to those numbers? What else was in the text message?  143 means I love you, but 5 I have no idea ...  Edit= Wait 1435 = I love you loads!|`|hNvILDqLaa	1=i 4=love 3=you 5=i  don't know what five means|`|AA12093419	I use 143 wen im tired. One letter in I. Four letters in Love. Three Letters in You. The five could maybe be sweet, hubby.|`|pP3131WYaa	mabye its her address or the time u  should meet her at or a code ask her friends!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|JII8tDbjaa	look it up on google|`|AA11288692	they are all wrong. It means:  1=one room  4=there will be four of us  3=Three of us will be girls  5=You better make us happy for five hours|`|alaUYtRcaa	she was probably just kidding.. i have no clue..|`|ZHMk78SWaa	It's military time... 2:35PM.... either call her then or meet her, depending on your instinct and what came before it in the message.|`|n0ZYoi2Gaa	it might be her phone number, her house number, something like that. it would help if you said what she said before those numbers.  there might be some sort of connection between something she said and the numbers. you could ask her.|`|iPxGgingaa	Maybe she was trying to spell "SEX" using the phone keys?    Like how kids will write "BOOBS" on their calculator by putting in 58008, then holding it upside down?    The 5 and 3 would form "SE" when you put them upside down, then the 41 might kinda look like letter X?     I don't know!
1O3RT3AWaa	Im 29 & my guy is 39....age is but a number.|`|aDLvzG2Saa	Legally you are fine together, but age, like they all say, is just a number. If you guys are vibin well, then stick with it. You're old enough to decide who you want to be with, no need to ask for someone else's oppinion.    Btw I have a female friend that's 17 when she got married to this 25+ guy and she's graduating from high school this year.|`|cYRZpGkqaa	no it's not. once you're over 18, i think it's ok just as long as he's not old enough to be your dad.|`|uUMDZdOIaa	you are over the legal age, and as long as you are happy that is what counts.  if he treats you good, and doesnt do drugs, who cares how old he is lol.  I dont think thats a big difference tho.  when i was 19, i started dating a 25 yr old, and now im 26, and we are still together!  Go for it!!|`|W618lfZ6aa	Age difference isn't a big deal, my gf is 19 as well, I'm 25.    Only problems with dating someone that much older then you is stages of life.  If you two plan on staying in the same region then it shouldn't cause issues.    You just came out of a bad relationship so take this one extremely slow.|`|N7kDc57Eaa	no age is just a number when you are dating depending on if you are in love or falling in love... when you fall in love nothing matters but what you and the other wants .. .|`|ekRtrUnIaa	no there are way bigger gaps then that with others and it worked. age doesnt really matter much

o0mwF5kFaa	No no no. There's nothing wrong. Unless he's a player, it's good thing you did that. You girls are so cryptic, and we can slmost never tell what you're thinking, so it's good to know when we're getting through. Seriously. It's real crap when you're trying and you see no definite reaction.  He was feeling trumphant, which is how any boy would feel if he got that reaction from a girl he liked. You probably also had a cute blush.  ==|`|eO4y3m1maa	It depends, is he the same age as you?     But yeah I think telling him a story about how he reminds you of an old crush would make it funny..    When you smile at him, just be like its funny everytime I see you it reminds me of this old crush I had.... and wink at him.|`|acdf2a2c14fccbe7a3badc5fa8d3abe1aa	don't tell him that he reminds you of someone else.  he probably likes the fact that you 'like' him enough to smile and blush.  I would either act like it's normal or make joke about it (if the joke could be used to your advantage).|`|cHM2US6xaa	I'm thinking he likes you or thought you were cute or what you did was cute :)  Talk to him, but DON'T tell him that he reminds you of an ex-crush.  Continue to act normal.|`|2VtkgzcIaa	def keep flirting and talk to him... Do NOT tell him about the ex... You want him to think you like him and not that you see an ex in him...|`|As7kOjUVaa	he likes you baby girl x x|`|dGyX3E8Faa	Awww haha that's really funny. Honestly I think he's attracted to you, and he probably feels good about himself when you blush in front of him. He most likely comes in regularly for you.
aLLavMeMaa	When you say you're wearing a padded bra, and showing cleavage, it sounds like you're selling yourself to him. If that's the only way to get his attention then forget about him. He's not good enough for you, obviously. Ask him about his day, or if you're ready to face the truth, you can ask him if he likes anyone. I'm working on this problem myself, and it's working. We're talking more, he's dating some chick, but it doesn't bother because she's a *****, and if I keep acting the way I am, maybe he'll see what he really wants. Sorry, this is all I got. Good luck! =]|`|gbBVscbJaa	OKay first of all dont make your self look any prettier than you are already because if he likes you then he should like you for you! And if that doesnt work than ask a friend to ask the guy who he likes that way if he gets curious than he wont know it was you.
Byz59nRGaa	You don't need to give him any of your private passwords to prove to him that he can trust you or that you love him.  A relationship is a shared thing, it's not giving yourself over to the other 100% mind, body and spirit!  If he does not trust you, it's his problem. If he can't be with you unless you give him your passwords then that's the end of the relationship and you're better off. Trust yourself! Give only in the relationship what you want to give and what you feel is right to give. You have to have the best relationship in your live with YOURSELF.  Take care and be Happy!|`|MQ2GL5jhaa	without trust there is no relationship.  Imo u should tell him that and if he keeps pressureing u, well then u know the status of ur relationship.      enjoy the rest of ur afternoon:)|`|W618lfZ6aa	Passwords are personal.  I wouldn't read my GF's email or text msgs even if I had access, he only wants them cause he feels insecure.  He shouldn't even ask for them.|`|Rn7zkS52aa	NO. do not give them to him. he is being crazy and possessive. he doesn't need them. and if he gets mad, you need to break up. because i promise it will only get worse if you continue to stick with him!|`|ckjZnqHRaa	..never...if he's that curious why doesn't he simply give you his first really?.....an eye for an eye babe........or not!  I advise NOT!!!|`|0xWtmrvbaa	he should be abke to luk through ur things especially if uve given him possibility to believe u might be up to something.. and also if u love him y shuldnt u its just to get him of ur bak u no but if u r doing something wether it is small or not then u r in wrong doin it and u shouldnt be scared to or even pensive about giving it to him jus give it to him..or cancel ur account n live happy with him..if u dont really love him well *** it do ur own thing u no.
Yjs2x29taa	He needs to get a job.|`|VMY7No0eaa	aren't you the guy who said you post things on here just to freak everyone out and get a laugh?|`|0uMLrKAbaa	itz okhay coz he is not that old i mean he is 26|`|DvSuHNV8aa	Well, he's a loser for other reasons... but he's making an effort to meet girls who more closely match his maturity level.|`|3xksQz9haa	What makes it gross is that it's never anyone his own age. I mean he's only 26? There are plenty of nice girls out there that are his age.|`|AA10214276	At least he's not hitting on girls in high school.|`|IxD8aNHTaa	he is a pervert.|`|mXtsmTdaaa	cant stand anyone his own aged because he has to be on a 18-21 year mental level|`|9759e8014743debd3d3fd1a7ad437c1faa	I'd say he's immature.  Guys who lack self-confidence tend to be scared of women their own age.|`|saRNROlmaa	It's disgusting.|`|kg6H6HDuaa	I think his mentality is stuck at that age and he prefers to have friends at that age of maturity cause that is where his level of maturity is.  If they are willing let's just be thankful they are not 13-16 years old.|`|toLCaFc9aa	Since he is immature, he can only look at a not so mature person. A woman his own age would never last a week with him.|`|V1i6c9qMaa	He is just immature and has never been on his own to feet so he doesn't know what maturity is. He hits on younger girls because thats where is mentality still sits. He needs to grow up a lot and when he does, if he ever does. He will be less attracted to younger women. Its not all bad though. I am 28 and i like to date women between 22-25, thats because I haven't met anyone women my own age I find attractive mentally. Age is nothing bad as long as there is something attractive there on both sides.|`|QXfEK4jcaa	he should find someone closer to his age!!!!|`|W2R8TRDmaa	I don't think its a big deal. He's 26 and they're all 18 and above.

If he's immature and she's mature, that could be fine. The 18 year olds are pushing it though.    As long as they're both adults, though, that's his business. Heck, there are couples seperated by 10-15 years that work. But if he's just hitting on college freshmen he doesn't know just because he likes their pictures, that's lame, but not because of his age.|`|RvddYKqjaa	You are talking a 5-8 year difference in age. The girls have a choice of saying no to him. I guess they don't. He sounds like he's pretty immature.  He's not bothering anyone, so I say he's hardly worth thinking about. If his parents ever just push him out the door, it will help him. I feel for them. They got rid of him for awhile anyway.   If he can make money as a telemarketer, he must be pretty personable.

I must wonder if he leaves messages on those myspace pages because you can't do a search for underage girls. He sounds like a pretty shady character. A DWI? So he attempts to murder people with his vehicle and he likes little girls? Yeah, he sounds like a real sweetie!|`|OGV5OBk5aa	Ok, so they guy is a bit of a loser to say the least.  As for the ages of the girls he hits on, they are the only ones he would have a chance with anyhow.  Any self respecting female would not go out with a dude living with his parents past the age of like 25 (max).  More power to him if he can get a younger girl to fall for him (assuming they are of "legal age").|`|FlSLNhsoaa	there is a golden rule that must be followed to  to see if the girl is too young for the guy...    take the guys age, in this case 26  divide it by two, 13  add 7 = the minimum age he can date, in this case its 20    so the 18, 19 year olds are no good but the 20,21 year old are fine.|`|4Dc44BC5aa	I think grown men who pray on young women are very insecure, that's obvious... Look at your friend 26 lives at home, can care for himself, would 26 year old women would want a man like that? But it could be enticing for a 18yr old, he can buy her drinks and they have more in common, both live at home etc... point is their lame and insecure.|`|cuvBHGyraa	He is very childish and doesn't know when and how to grow up. Unfortunately, there may be nothing you can no, seeing that growing up is something he has to do on his own. The fact that he hits on younger girls is because that's the age he wishes he still was, and that women his own age don't give him the time a day. This is very sad because he should have grown up a long time ago. Its not so much weird, but a travesty that he is this way. Hope this helps!|`|mJx42D2Iaa	Ew. Men like that are a woman's worst nightmare.   a) He still lives with his parents.   b) He's immature, at an age where there is no excuse for it.  c) He's not reliable (ex: mooching off roomates/parents)  d) He got a DWI.   e) He's shady.   Guys using Myspace to find young girls are the ultimate creeps.    I don't think he can GET women his own age because they're too smart (hopefully) to even consider him. He needs to get it together. Get a career, save up money, get your own place, and stop being a creep. He needs to get his life in order, soon.|`|TD5Wqe4maa	Why are you coming on yahoo answers trashing your friend? What he's doing isn't illegal and a matter of fact happens all the time in this world, especially on my space.     I know I'm not going to get best answer for this, but you shouldn't be worrying who your friend is hooking up with, nor trashing is misfortune of having to go live with his parents again.    In the end he is just a guy that's loves hooking up with girls and it isn't that unusual.|`|I4tulYTzaa	I would say women from 19 to 25 kinda look the same age. I wouldn't be able to distinguish between someone 19 or 25. So I do not think this is something weird. But of course if he is interested in under 18 year olds than he has a problem and the rest of society hopes not.  If he is immature and stays at home allot it is difficult to establish a relationship. So if he is trying give him a chance to find love.|`|LIrBePulaa	sounds just like a friend i have!  are you sure we aren't talking about the same person?  lol!  it's probably because most girls his own age have their act together and know what they want as far as their future.  Maybe, because of his situation, living w his parents and all, he is embarrassed and afraid that he can't get a girl his own age.|`|qzAlhXMWaa	well look at it this way as long as they are over 18 there really is no problem with what he is doing, see a lot of men mature at different stages your friend may just be at that particular stage where due to his maturity level (or lack there of) only girls who are younger e.g. closer to his maturity level find him attractive and vise versa.  ultimately you should not concern yourself with what a 26 year old man does or does not do with his life as it is his life to lead and as long as he does not break the law let him find happiness wherever he sees fit.|`|HR6KILFAaa	thats being a hore|`|1gf6cD6eaa	ahhhhhhhhhh i think he's a pervert and probably a child melester and stuff ahhhhhhhhh|`|79NcigQdaa	well if shes 18 shes legal  but if your 16 when you where 8 she was just being born|`|Rc00ne20aa	WEIRD AND EWWWW!!!!|`|AA11192442	Younger women aren't as well informed and easier to fool I guess. This isn't true about all younger women, but the more experienced the less likely they would hook up with this guy. He's just got problems and needs love, anywhere he can get it.|`|lB6xbOndaa	long as theyre legal age theyre aint much trouble. some girls like older men and some men like younger women|`|a9DMXMsjaa	From A Psychology point of view he has assimilation issues. This can stem from his mom most likely developed in the phallic stage of life (3-6yrs of age). another reason for this could quite possibly be he has confidence issues. He doesn't believe that he can speak to women his age because he is afraid of rejection and the risk of that happening with younger girls are slim to none (women like older men).
XAw4cJmjaa	Yes, she is playing mind games. To her, she gets thrills from the thought of another guy "wanting" her. And, she knows that you may not ever really push her into doing what yall talk about.  She is getting all she wants and leaving you out in the cold with nothing!  Doesn't sound like a friend that is worth keeping. If she can't be honest with you about her personal life when yall are just friends, then how do you expect her to honest/truthful if yall were to be more than that?|`|aZsyxJ5Gaa	i think shes just playing around,i dont think u should wait for her anymore...u know some gurls r like that,they like the fact that multiple guys have a crush on them so forget her n move on with ur life...trust me eventually u'll find out that she has nothin for u,but if u found out the opposite then lol,congrats ur in love with a total wack job....:)      good luck..
6bec1b1d615ba504dd8ddd905700f371aa	Time heals all, my friend.  It might help, in the meantime, to hate her guts (but don't do anything stupid) .... Once you're done with being angry, then you can let the healing begin.  Getting laid doesn't hurt either ;)|`|smyhq0Ggaa	Over a cliff.|`|RDxwA15kaa	Im in the exact same boat man. Let me know when you have the answer.
55NKPb82aa	Grow some bullocks and ask her.|`|YGZuAl2Caa	Think about it this way.   If you ask her out, and she says yes, you could have a future.  If you ask her out, and she says no, you will never find out.  Big deal, if she rejects you. In 20 years from now nobody will point at you and say "Oh, look, that's the boy Sally Salsa said no to".  Suck it up and ask her out.|`|aD7PaNs5aa	i would just take a chance. if it ends up that she's not into you, at least you tried. but if she tells everyone about the incident, obviously she wasn't as great as you thought she was and maybe you should tell her that. it could be a wake-up call for her if it works out that way. go luck! :]
W618lfZ6aa	If your legal you're good in that department.    You are a little young, but your parents approve so good deal!    Go slow, If hes really pressuring you then hes not worth it.  Any guy worth his snot will tell the girl whenever she is ready, guys are almost always ready anytime, its our nature.    Good luck.|`|acdf2a2c14fccbe7a3badc5fa8d3abe1aa	not sure what the question is.  The age difference wouldn't bother me.  If he is willing to allow you to choose when you go further in the relationship, then I don't see any problems. And if it doesn't work out, oh well, same would probably happen with a guy that is 17.|`|8JiTyw2Paa	so he was in 7th grade when you were in 1st.......................|`|a35c4a3ab714036bfd3c31e133920f9caa	just like you said, your not going to rush.  take it slow see where things go.  get to know him better before you jump into it.  good luck|`|ff3Gcd5Oaa	In situations like this, the guy is usually immature.  If not materially then emotionally or he would be able to relate to women his own age.  Not that you aren't mature, but you are 17...Continue to take this slowly and if he tries in any way to rush you, run for it!|`|0mHi3S2Raa	I dated a 24 year old when I was 17, It was never really anything serious tho. Just do what your gut tells you, take it slow and don't rush into doing anything you might regret. From what you say he sounds like a nice guy and has alot going for him. I don't see anything wrong with it, as long as both of you are mature about the decisions you make with each other.  Good luck, hope it works out for you.|`|Vhq3GURQaa	PLEASE do not sell yourself short and hop into bed with him. A man wants a woman he can respect. This guy is a bit more grown up and understands responsibility more than your past bf. Date, get to know him. Wait and see what it's really like to be around him.  I promise you will never regret not sleeping with someone. Just be patient and see.|`|4HoVVCenaa	At your age, it is a fairly big difference.. which doesn't mean that you shouldn't, but rather that you should be cautious.|`|V1i6c9qMaa	I would guess its ok, but a few things to think about on his end. He is 24 so I bet he goes out to bars and is talking to other women. If you ever want to be alone with him your only refuge is his place and that is below where your parents are, that could get weird. Just talk it slow like you said and gauge his actions toward you. Who knows I could be wrong, I hope I am!|`|fvyjQZ55aa	it's a fairly big age difference but it all depends on levels of maturity. I say go for it, the worst that could happen is that it wouldn't work out, but try it, see where it goes, if you like this guy it's definitely worth it whether he's 14 or 34.|`|2VtkgzcIaa	It seems ok... It's going to be hard because he's probably going to be going to bars and stuff like that and you wont be apart of that. But honestly, maturity-wise, an 18 year old and 24 year old guy are about the same. Another thing you have to think about is why he isn't already with someone his own age... Guys tend to go for younger girls if they are having a hard time getting someone their own age. It's cool to hang out, but take it slow.|`|9220e99cf581203dda5db0c56616ac40aa	if you're looking for a serious relationship, what's 6 years?  women age faster than men, and since sex is such a big thing with him, you don't want him your age because he'll stop wanting to have sex with you when you're old and he'll find other people.    o and just because he has a car and a job doesn't mean he will treat you nice.  you really have to get to know him.
HnTpvVEEaa	i know this is the worst feeling in the entire world. i have been there, and how i got over is i hung out with my friends and tried my best to stay busy and not think about it. your life hasnt ended you have begun a new chapter! believe me in the future you will find someone new and realize he wasnt worth all of the tears youve shed! life goes on girl!|`|RncUc0traa	neva give up on life u may tink that live sucks today but tomorrow u would wonder if it was that small problem give you stress... u may email if wan 2 talk no problem|`|6lFdYRH9aa	meh i feel the same at the moment.

The difference is when you are from lets say 4 to 45 then you always can look forward to a better time if you consentrate on lifes goals and get to work on a carreer. If you are about 45 or up you will feel all the things the younger ones feel and more because you become more aware of how fast your life is flying by. You see lifes circle from young, middle age, children and back to young again. Look forward to new tomorrows and know that it doesnt stay that way unless you are elderly and then you have to rely on faith. Grampa B

One dreaming to him in German for some reason, he's german but mine wasn't as good as what was happening in the dream.    Another time he was at the top of the main stairs at school and he had his shirt off but he looked like he had been famined or starved, it was really freaky.    Then ssometimeshe just pops up randomly or ssomethingfor aew short seconds.    Its been really really really strange, cause usually my dreams are really bizarre, but recently they just freak me out because I really like him but the dreams always make him really scary to look at.|`|AENucHDsaa	yeah i always have dreams about my crush's...    like if i really fancy someone i'll dream about them every night, but mine are less transparent then your mine are all complicated and stuff not simple like yours is romantic, mine was like i went to a cottage and he was there and we would talk and he would almost say he loves me then he'd turn into a dog, then there were 3 dogs and i didn't know which one was him cos it turns out they were all female!

uJ9waJDYaa	Well that's life for the most of us.  Things can always be good, but perfect moments aren't always.  That's why they are so cherished, unique and loved.  If everything was perfect all the time then it would not be called perfect anymore, it would be normal or average, it could even become 'okay'.  If things start our exciting because its different but then because it's always there then obviously 'good things never last', because "then you hate it" (just what you said) i don't know though, you seem to be saying a couple of different things that over write each other so its hard to answer smoothly, but that's what i think.  Things dont stay the same for ever because our world is dynamic and so are we. life changes and we change with it. You need to make the most of what you can, take a few risks, explore and remember you are what makes your life how it is.|`|ckjZnqHRaa	.......nothing good lasts forever...cliche!!!|`|hCsAHDjNaa	Oh my gosh, I know exactly how you feel.

Yes, he may disappointed and maybe even a little mad, but it's better to nip-it-in-the-butt now than to let things continue on and really feelings get in the way.|`|71JJ9GRVaa	I actually had a situation like that a couple of years ago. I started seeing this guy, wasn't totally into him, but it was summer, I decided I'll keep him for a bit, just to have someone to hang out with.  He would show up at my place unexpectedly, wanted to see me everyday. Since I'm too nice not to tell someone off, I decided to go along with it. We were seeing each other for a month or so, and my feelings actually slowly changed for him. Believe it or not, I actually fell in love with him.   For some reason when I'm not that into a guy first, turns out to be a great relationship. That's how I am with my boyfriend of 7 years right now. I didn't not care for him first, and them boom, the spark came.  If I were u, I would give it a chance, take it easy. Don't dump him just because he wants to be with you. You could always come up with an excuse why u can't see him. Think of how u would feel if u were in his shoes and he told u he doesn't want to hang out with you everyday.   Well, hope this helps to make the right decision. U also need to take it into consideration what u want out of this relationship. If you're only looking for a friend, u might want to act now. If he is a good guy though, don't let him go too far.|`|hPeXcYFVaa	Before breaking up, let him know that you need some space in a nice way. Don't upset him and be a ***** about it.

I would and its hard to get me|`|jj2tSASnaa	well to ask a question like that you seem crazy! so no way would i date you. how can we know if you are pretty or not?|`|W8R0FrROaa	no you are too Young, see you in 6 years|`|emHkDQmaaa	i wouldnt know unless i see a picture because you might be but ugly
U9vE47hdaa	yes he likes you. yes you should continue talking to him. ask him out. hope i helped. :-) you want to ask more questions, but don't want to be called an idiot by others, email me at akivasha_carlson@yahoo.com or golden_demon19@yahoo.com|`|s827R4ataa	ok well I've heard many guys say things like that. They probably really do want to get to know you better. You don't want to rush into a relationship when he might not even like you and end up hurt even more in the end. Try hanging out with him alone and with your friends. Tell him about what you like to do and other things about you. Show him who you really are and most importantly be yourself and never change for a guy. Don't ask him right away. Give him a month or so and then ask him how he feels. Good luck!!|`|jj2tSASnaa	words are cheap.  I can tell you that you are gonna take off flying like a bird, but you wont.  observe how he treats you if you want the truth,but if you want to hear a lie or just what you want to then go ahead and ask him.  that is too easy.  got any real problems?|`|y3F4dfEmaa	just keep talking to him.. and dont ask if he likes you cuz you just said he said he doesnt rlly no u and wants to get to know you better...|`|S5KNlUGHaa	it doesnt matter. guys hate girls that stress out about crap like this. just be yourself and if he likes you, he will tell you. give him space|`|86NkB2OCaa	never assume that he likes you or something, you'll only hurt yourself in the process. just go with the flow, enjoy his company. be casual, treat him as a friend.|`|owQXd4tIaa	if he says that he wants to get to know you better than that menas he alredy like that part of you that he knows. you deffinently should still talk to him but dont make it sound like you desprete. talk to him  about what you like and ask him questions and eventually start asking him if he wnts to go to places with you and your friends and his friends.do not ask him if he likes you then you sound despreate.hope i helped     peace out|`|fVomJGmKaa	haha, im in the same position.   And my problem is that im so scared i'm   going to get rejected. But I like this guy named ryan  and he flirts with me. But he's one of those guys   where he becomes really good friends with his future   girlfriend. And what sucks even more is that like 3 other  girls like him.    So if I were you I would keep talking to him, maybe flirt a little   bit more. Like if your walking with him in the hall, mabye brush   up against his arm or something flirty like that.    hoped this helped a little bit. :)
AA10823493	Once a cheater always a cheater . find a new feriend|`|FWsv3Schaa	look for another guy. chances are if he cheated on you twice it would happen again if you got back together. i know its hard but just move on. good luck girl!    answer mine on my page?|`|DULzJ4ruaa	EASY MOVE ON ONCE A CHEAT ALWAYS A CHEAT DONT WORRY SOON THE RIGHT GUY WILL COME TO YOU
eO4y3m1maa	Certain ages, boys only date girls with boobs...while a few boys will date girls they like...you never know depends on the boy. Maybe you are only paying attention to the boys who are loud and drool over girls...    Go talk to guys yourself..it will make a big difference..im sure you will meet someone by being the outgoing one.|`|pizsAvupaa	Not me. Am in2 the personality of a girl over looks...it would help if their cute though ^_^|`|fVomJGmKaa	thats cuz you need to go up to them.  I learned that the hard way.  You need to get to know them, talk to them,  and stuff. believe me, it works if you try.|`|scnW0Wzeaa	Yes, are you a wale?|`|Fma6huOvaa	It's kind of proggramed in our mind. Like, the first thing I notice about a girl is her hair. then her chest. then eyes. then butt. then tummy. I only go out with girls who are hot and I actually know.
F2LI7zjraa	tell me when you resolved it coz i hav the same problem  http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...|`|x88DfLokaa	1st.. low self esteem is a big turn off to anyone.. so even if you think it dont say it. like when he says your pretty and you dont agree, justs ay thank you and maybe smile or soemthing because if you say no.. im not dont lie.. there gonna stop complimenting you and probably not wanna talk to  you.. and as for your friends roomate.. just give it a try who knows what can come from it.. be opened minded and  gave the guy a chance.|`|N8kxg8wgaa	they will come up to you and say i like you|`|9WThresQaa	It's horses for courses. You must appeal to him.|`|mGdhN7PRaa	well meet him and see you can usually come to know if somebody likes you and dont worry if he likes you, you are definitely pretty|`|9s9Baglyaa	Honey, every girl thinks she's not pretty. Chances are that you are pretty and he does like you. If he doesn't , who cares? There will be another guy that likes you!|`|yWZtE7mkaa	First, it doesnt matter whether other people think you're pretty or not, everyone's beautiful.  Second, he probably does like you, you can normally judge it by the way he acts, e.g. he may act differently with you than when he's with other friends of his.  Third, don't get your hopes up, just incase.
7AHDvRQqaa	if u like someone and want her to be yours, then start respecting her and the ones around. not only this but stand on what is right. and neglect her don't simply be her flatterer.
7zGV7LmKaa	Like everyone here agrees on,  1 Be yourself. You want a girl to like you for the things that you are and nothing else.  2 Just ask :) Yep its that simple, yet most guys overlook it 99% of the time. We're right there, and you don't say ''hi!'', so try it!  3 Don't be afraid to ask us out, and don't assume we're busy ;)    good luck!|`|U9vE47hdaa	just be yourself. become friends with a few girls and see if one likes you the way you want one to.|`|scnW0Wzeaa	Ha! Ha! Hee!|`|xAoE9P5Maa	be yourself, and go out there and try and find someone, try malls and skate parks and places like that. And all my friends have a bf but i don't, but I keep my head up like my nose is bleeding. lol  =]]|`|Xxr5iKSnaa	Be yourself. You will find the girl that your meant to be with sooner or later.|`|97Hnt7Ywaa	make good friends with someone you like.  Play a game called 20 question, where you describe things that both of you like.  If that doesn't work, then talk to her everyday until the door of opportunity is available.  Being friends with a girl, that is the main goal here.    hope this helps and good luck|`|8Mqw8UyCaa	Make good friends with a girl that you really like, then ask her out. If she says yes, then you have a temporary girlfriend.  Hope I helped.|`|AxxJrOGbaa	blackplanet
AA11328507	Clearly your too young for a boyfriend or sex...DON'T do it|`|67ThRN4Taa	Carleen is correct:  you're too young.  You and your boyfriend are suppose to exchange marriage-vows before you do that stuff.
Rb087BsAaa	Well you are a liar.  He has every right to be suspicious.  You're not ready for a real relationship.|`|UgcPxd4maa	you need to come claen about everything, and you can never ever lie to him again. Trust is earned, you'll have to earn his trust. If he feels like giving you another chance that is...|`|dPULl5hjaa	The best was to come clean with your bf.    You have lied to him ONE TIME AND HE CAN'T ACCEPT IT.    I'm glad you said to him SORRY.    I would just wait and see - don't contact him - let him digest what you told him!|`|sK9kDAtLaa	talk in person not email|`|ZzEAc5ecaa	ask him over and just talk. good luck .. and have a drink with him ok|`|Rg2ERXAtaa	if your gonna lie about something so trivial,then you'll lie about anything  oh i thought this was a real relationship,not e-dating,never mind|`|jj2tSASnaa	its easy.  that is over. no trust no love.  stop lying unless you want the same thing to happen again.  oh stop drinking too, because it makes you lie.|`|VDlvSMP1aa	ditch him and go for someone with better grammer|`|5BBy6G36aa	Never betray a guy's trust. An ex girlfriend did this to me once, except I found out he was bi ^^...She left me for a girl lol.  But eh, give him time. The thing is, you deserve it, you shouldn't hav lied... Girls disgust me these days. I can't seem to find the right one.|`|90i8RqKoaa	Say your sorry again and tell him that you didn't want to get drunk around him.|`|M3CsxF2jaa	sounds like  he has something to hide himself why is he tripping so hard.|`|QGSaSo6Jaa	tell him that you had a reason for not telling him (i hope you do). also tell him that if you are serious about being together then he should be able to trust that you are telling the truth this time.    also, try and do something nice for him, take him out or something.|`|m93fvq1gaa	Okay tell him that thats in the past, you don't do it anymore because you met him and you didn't think you'd be good enough for him or (make up something like that), just say everything else was true and im going to keep apologizing until you forgive me and we can be friends again because ive been looking too hard and never finding a guy like you, and now that i have im not going to let go until you forgive me, im so sorry i dont know how many times im going to have to say that until you realize that i really am, people make mistakes and i made a bad one, im only human, and i apologize, so i did what i could to try and say im sorry so the rest is up to you, i don't think all this is worth throwing away a friendship and that one day could have been great, and i know i messed up but im sorry i hope you are kind and find it in your heart to forgive me, -because i did that in the past and i don't anymore- ( you can add that if you want maybe not yet)|`|5fdgfNCRaa	Admit you made a mistake by lying. You got carried away with wanting to make a good impression and in doing so, you told him something that wasn't true. You didn't want to lie, but you got wrapped up in wanting to make him happy. Tell him that you're truly sorry.   More importantly.... don't do this by email.   Face to face discussion is much much more effective. Emotions don't carry through over black and white text. You can't tell a person's tone. I'm a Communications major and if there's one thing that I've learned is that nonverbal communication (eye contact, body language, facial expression) can make or break your speech interview etc etc and can do the same for conversations. Talk to him in honestly and from your heart. If you want it to work out you need to be open with each other.   (I just noticed what you said about your distance)  I'm not a fan of long distance relationships, but I think that he should find a phone, somewhere, and talk to you. Over the computer really honestly can't cut it when it comes to expressing feelings.   I wish I could help you more.  The best of luck!|`|YEjhx5Mvaa	my best guess is to start telling the truth more|`|GSxUQbDMaa	he got mad because you drink? or lied about it?  tell him not be mad about such a small matter and that u only drink occasionally or something :P ughh why lie? he's gonna find out all the other things u lied about as well... this is why its so important to be honest -.- or else you'll just mess up the relationship|`|qYaINCrkaa	Just say it was a little white lie and you said it because you didnt want to hurt him. Say you have not told any more lies, and just apologize.    but really why is it that big of a deal?|`|9fAHd15Caa	ahhhh i lied to someone as well that i was sort of with except without the title, except a much different lie. All you can do is hope that he cares about you enough that he will be able to trust you again. The guy im talking about did and for that Im thankful because I cant get over the lie he told me :(|`|c392efbc3dbf009c97bde6dea618bd2caa	ive learned my lesson on lying to my boyfriend . its the the best idea be straight up with him tell him why you lied. just tell him you didn't want him to think you were a bad person or that you didn't know if he would still wanna be with you if you did. just tell him you care for him very much and don't want to loose him over this. just let him know that from now on you both will be up front and never lie with each other again. remember no relationship is perfect. no ones is. good luck =]|`|7KkiBPDxaa	Tell him that you were hoping for his approval, and you were too scared about him not liking you, ask him to give you another chance because you really care for him and you will promise to come clean and not keep secrets anymore.    If he takes you back; don't lie. It's simple, if you want to have a healthy relationship, then it means that you need to come clean about things that are important like that.    It obviously hurt him that you lied, which means that he cares about you. So you need to gain his trust back by being honest.    Hope this helped!  :]  Good luck winning him back!|`|PoGtfu03aa	just dont reply hes in florida.  focus on someone thats atleast in the same time zone as you.
sIhPpdv3aa	Wow. That really sucks.    At least you don't have to see her all the time. If I were you I wouldn't be looking for a message from her. I would IGNORE any calls from her, too. She did you wrong, buddy. You need to get away from that to heal. Don't talk to her for a few months at least. My rule is you can take half the time your were together to get over a person, so it's ok to still be hurt for a few months.    One of two things happened:   1) she was using your love to gratify her ego. She liked the attention and thought she might have feelings for you, but only because you made her feel better about herself. You don't need a selfish person leeching off your love. Let her go.  2) she did care about you, but there are other things going on with her that are stronger. Maybe she's called to be a nun. Maybe she is going through a big crisis in her life and since you aren't in the same country she knows you can't really be there for her, so she is pushing you away. If something big is happening in her life and she feels like you have no place in that, you can't convince her otherwise. Let her go.    Take the time you need to heal, don't communicate with her. In a few months go on some casual dates to rebound and get back out there! that really helps.|`|7Bb53RIDaa	Just talk to her maybe you need closure.|`|V1i6c9qMaa	This is classic dude!    I would say by the sound of it, you may have been a bit clingy calling or texting her constantly and she just got annoyed by it. In that case she felt like you lost some appeal as her man and she brushed you aside. My ex did the same thing to me and said almost the samethings you have been saying. What you need to do is compose yourself first and foremost. Stop worrying about her and worry about you! Hang out with your buds and go have a good time, think about you for a while and put her out of your mind the best you can. Trust me I know easier sad then done, but believe me its starts to feel better. I am 2 months out of my relationship of three years. And I can tell you stories of what has happened to me just this last month alone.     Cut off all contact with her unless she calls you! Search your feelings and think of what you could have done to end the relationship. Write them down and move on. Make you happy! Do better at work, work harder at school, pick up a new hobby, exercise more. Do things that are more positive for you. she will notice the difference in you and believe me she will be trying to contact you. If you need any more help just holler!|`|scnW0Wzeaa	Move on. Someone else is Shellacking her now.|`|ZCN5rGkWaa	if u really believe the problem has a solution then go for it , but if u know deep inside its really over then try to just forget , try doing stuff to get ur head thinking about other things , dont focus on that, try meeting new people , just friends ,|`|pgDQORHeaa	May be you did something bad and it hurted her feeling?|`|c392efbc3dbf009c97bde6dea618bd2caa	well you are defently emotionly attached..if you guys had sex then it makes the situation worse and it will be hard just give her time to think and give her space no girl wants to come back to a man who is gunna be needy and beggin her and telling her sorry . so good luck hoped this helped|`|EDYETUNCaa	It's perfectly normal to feel this way. You two were together for a really long time. You will go through many different kinds of emotions: Sadness, lonliness, guilt, anger but you will get over it in time.     It's probably best you realize now if won't work out. She won't be back. But that's a part of the healing process and something you'll go through for a bit. But eventually you'll realize she won't be back. I know it hurts. She probably loved you at one time, but now she doesn't. She changed her mind. It happens and I'm sorry.     Just leave her alone. Move on. Try to stay busy. Hang out. Have fun. In time you will be ok. Just remember one day you will find someone where it will all work out.|`|AA10726533	I'm not trying to be rude but punctuation helps when you write something long. It's hard to follow.  Mabye since both of you live in completely different countries, she misses you and it's too hard for her. I'm sure that is a big reason because it is very hard to be in a relationship with someone when you never see them. I myself have been in long distance relationships, and we didn't work. I wanted it to so bad but when I had problems sometimes I didn't want to talk, I wanted him there to give me a hug or lay down and just take a nap and not have any other worries.   Distance is a big factor.|`|tE4ZGVtPaa	your girlfreind is comlete bullshit. She dosent seem attracted to you at all and it sucks man i know. But you have to be a man and let it go.

zgqAHk66aa	I know the last thing you want to do is lose him as a friend, but you will never be able to get over him if you see all the time. You are going to have to completely cut him out of your life, at least for as long as it takes for you to get over him. I know that sucks, but the saying "out of sight, and out of mind" is true. The more time you spend away from him, the less you will think about him, and eventually, those feelings will fade. You can always resume the friendship later, because if he is really your friend, he will understand and let you go.|`|dd0d57e5ff24820c6981c10f9097112faa	jsut tell him yuo cnat see him for awihle|`|m93fvq1gaa	no, stay friends with him, either tell him which you should or focus on someone else, and while your doing it watch the music video by taylor swift called teardrops on my guitar. it basically is the same as yoru story. maybe once you tell him he'll realize he loves you, so just go for it, youll never know if you dont try.|`|scnW0Wzeaa	Make a clean break.

You musta dun sumit right lol. gud luck|`|scnW0Wzeaa	Move on he got what he wanted from you. He will have no respect for you. To him you were too easy to get. If you were that easy, In his mind you are a loose woman. Most men don't want to have a serious  relationship with a woman like that because of the fear in the back of there mind that you would be easy for someone else to bed.|`|f7f0fd5f021b5d1e4672cdbda2a11ffeaa	Call if you want to call him.

Some guys are just cowards they'd rather do anything but tell the truth.|`|x1Jh7sCoaa	i don't know how long it's been since you made up so it's hard to say. i had a fight with my bf last night, we made up and he wanted me to be all kissy and cuddly with him but i couldn't. i still love him the same but i'm not in that lovey-dovey place right now. i will get there again but not on his timeframe, on mine. just give him some time for the hurt to go away. the more you try to force it out of him, the longer it will take. be just as distant and he may come around. mind you, if it's been longer than a week or two, you should worry.
x1Jh7sCoaa	honestly, some guys are about monogamy and others (esp at 18) are about being players. you should be grateful that he is being honest with you and not cheating behind your back. go find a guy who wants monogamy instead of trying to "figure out" the players  you are only going to hurt yourself. he is telling you HIS TRUTH why are you doubting him. he's not scared of commitment or any other foolish reason women lie to themselves with. he likes p*ssy, and not just yours. he wants to try all sorts. let him. at least he's real about it.|`|TMi1GhSHaa	ya i know what you mean but some guys are just not ready to be in committed relationships, at least he is being honest with you.. but i gather if the guy really did like you he would at least try it out.. I think for your own sake its best to stay clear from this guy.. especially knowing that he fools around with other girls as well.. i mean who's to say he wont do that when your together? he might as well just be lying ot you that hes not.. so its better that hes honest.. in a non committed relationship with you just because of the kind of guy he already is.. and his not so interest in you.. Im guessing you had sex with him and it meant something to you right? well ya.. that's probably why your feeling the way you do, sex is very intimate and if you take it seriously and your the kind of person to fall easily.. having sex in a uncommitted relationship is NOT the best thing to do..     i hope it all works out to your advantage though... and that you get what you want.. but if it doesn't find a guy who wants to be committed to you... im sure there are lots out there, you are so much better then this, you just got to realize it.|`|tsdHndRhaa	you both are young, and he's obviously not ready to settle down and that does not mean he does not like or love you, it's just that he is at a wild and normal stage in his life and he wants  to sow his oates, if you love him then maybe you both need to talk about analyzing this relationship and where you  need to be in life, just move on if you have too and love yourself enough to know when to let go.|`|0fVtHNtmaa	Not all men are uncommitted.

QxA29Y2Naa	I know that you wanted a man's opinion, but I dated a man like that for 2 years, so I needed to post an answer.    You need to find someone else. 90 percent of a good boyfriend is not enough. It really messes with your head. And whether you know it now or not, you deserve better.    I eventually broke up with the guy. It was one of the most difficult things I did. Years later when I ran into that ex "90-percent" boyfriend at a bar, I asked him why he treated me that way.    His answer: He was didn't want to date me exclusively (he admitted to cheating on me even though he lied to me about it at the time), but he cared about me and didn't want anyone to date me either.     There you have it. Girl, you need to move on.    I promise it gets easier. And your next relationship will be better - because you will set your standards higher and hold your new man to them.|`|i4QYyUsRaa	He has another girlfriend.|`|x1Jh7sCoaa	i get the sense that he was trying out other females (or maybe just another female) then came back to you maybe she was on her period, away for the weekend or angry at him|`|7a17e9b78ca099269e53156e32fc977aaa	is a long term commitment missing, like a ring?    if a ring is missing, that insecurity better go before the ring is found.
eO4y3m1maa	If you hate it that much, I say quit....or start looking for someting else and then leave when you do find somethig! Start saving up money in case you just can't take it anymore and have to quit.    The economy is bad, but if you don't have alot of responsibilities except for you..then make your choices for you!     Just don't be irrational. Good luck!!|`|HNE7dJQiaa	If money is not that serious of an issue to you and your family, I say quit.  You only live once, dont spend it doing something you hate, you'll regret it.
2Cw0DfaSaa	he thinks your a hoe fo sho now...   DONT EVER GIVE IT UP ON THE FIRST DATE!!   then he'll think your an easy **** and only call you for booty calls!!|`|x88DfLokaa	well... i just think know hes gonna expect it .. like for me.. thats happened to me before.. ig ot out of a realtionship (2yrs) and then like a month later i went to a friends party and meet this guy we ended up drinkning and haveing a good time..  after having a little too much to drink we ended up  doing more then kissing.. no sex tho.. and he calls and stuff..  but only for one thing.. so yeah i think you shoulnt call him or anyting anf wait until he comes to you.|`|ZJdeXNiHaa	It would for me, some guys wouldn't care though.|`|GRcF7R15aa	it really doesn't. although i would have preferred it not to have happened like that for me and my current boyfriend it did. If someone likes you enough it really doesn't matter. If they don't, they don't but it doesn't mean you made a mistake, just that you filtered out someone who wasn't that serious but it sounds like he is so that doesn't actually apply at all!  so basically, its fine and do not worry.
3AD3mX8taa	just talk to her and be yourself|`|ja0qW30Maa	If shes new she prolly doesn't have many friends. If I were her I would want you to just go up to her and say "hey". Just try it once. It will work. Oh and tell her that you like her shoes or something. But not her shirt unless its classy. Hope this helps.

eO4y3m1maa	Just show her you love her, call her, text her...let her know all the time how much you care about her..    Hug her, run your hand thru her hair look in her eyes...love every bit of her!        I wish you luck|`|UP33GlBwaa	Ive had soo many guys put one over me that all I can tell you is that any decent girl would just want to know that there bf loves them.  Us good girls want our guys to be honest and show it.  And if she is upset over something she needs you to be understanding.  Even if she gets mad and doesnt want to talk, just say ok and let it go for the time being.  Dont swear at her and make her feel like a piece of trash.  I know that happened to me and I feel really crappy about that because I would always go the extra mile for this guy that I was seeing and he just took it all for granted.  He never kept his promises to me and I felt like it would never get any better so I just said I have to forget him even though I care for him.  You need to be real true to her and constantly show her, every day, that you care.  Dont be the bf that just disappears for days without a call to say hi or tell her you're going to call and you dont.  Be good to her.  It's really nice that you are thinking of her for Valentine's Day and you should go through with it to show her how much you do care for her.  Maybe that's the first step to showing her.
XI9e7OyEaa	well the question is how do you want him? he is not saying I want you as in I want you to do your homework. He wants you as in sex. tell him if your ready how you want him.|`|ALDXW0Jeaa	say i want you inside!|`|AB5erhhUaa	Say I want you physically.|`|8AOgHjH0aa	say what you want. i prefer hugs|`|zXzS8MFuaa	if you want him tell him.naked sweaty.be yourself.more important be honest!!!
E2bagWkpaa	I would try talking to her about it first.   Then, if you still feel like you two just aren't hitting it off, yeah, I would end it.     Do what makes you happy, and right now, she doesn't seem to be doing that.|`|dDDAbqqhaa	Maybe she doesn't like your bad grammar.|`|YsxBhoLbaa	break up and go for the other one|`|Wbt6QTpIaa	leave your gf|`|owuF63XWaa	i tihnk you should dump her because i dont think she likes you.  but maybe shes just mad because you dont invite her anywhere?  but if not  dump her and wait a few days the ask out the girl that likes you.|`|sZ1xbQXlaa	Go with the girl who wants to be with you. those are the ppl you should surround yourself with:)|`|8rt7OR35aa	She's a boob.    Dump her.    She doesnt care about you.  A relationship cant one sided.|`|jj2tSASnaa	cancel that one and buy another|`|PyAxwuqWaa	tell her u don't like it or just forget aobut it or maybe brake up with that *****|`|AhEZdxXtaa	I think u should break up with her  It sounds like she's just using u to make the other kid jealous!  sorry|`|QdXvBOL7aa	okay well you need to talk to her. Couples that lack communication wont last long.|`|GV8bhsEcaa	Break up with your so called girlfriend. She isn't into you any way. Move on! If you don't do it now she will break up with you and the next day she will be dating one of your friends.|`|aGno0HAwaa	Well forget about the girl who does not talk to you. I would do that if I was in your place. If you give her space and care and she does not bother then she is not the lucky one to get you neither you have to be sorry, it is her fault. That is sad, she talks to your friends more than she does to you.    If you want her back the only thing to do is jealous her with the girl who really talks to you, make sure the other girl knows how the bad girl treats you and how much you love her. So at last you don't end up losing the girl who even likes you. Good luck.|`|f7f0fd5f021b5d1e4672cdbda2a11ffeaa	This is simple. If you like the other girl, and she likes you then break up with your current girlfriend.   The rest of it is irrelevant. Your gf can talk to whomever she wishes and since when is two hours on the phone not a long time??? My phone conversations dont' last more than 10 minutes!! Anyways stop trying to blame your gf for the fact that you have your eye on someone else, just do what you have to do without the excuses.|`|8qVkSA4jaa	Ask your girl why she doesn't talk to you.|`|YQ4oLtl9aa	tell her what you want|`|GaouUtGTaa	Break up with you gf and go with the other girl..i think your current gf is using you|`|EjzQopb7aa	well i would break up with her if i were you  and date this other girl hope i helped|`|0dEaFrFOaa	There's always two sides to the story. If you're really interested in your current girlfriend, maybe you should try to include her in on things as well. She's probably asking about your friends, or talking to them, to get dirt on you. - hell, you don't really know what she's saying to them.|`|cIfle5ckaa	I think that you should let your girlfriend go and get to know the other girl... before you start dating her.  She might like you a lot!  I think you should go out with the other girl if you like her personality after you get to know her.|`|3j0reWJXaa	If your girlfriend is acting like that, dump her sorry ***.  Go for the other girl, you will have a great relationship with her.|`|uF3Q9Xzuaa	well it seems like she feels awkward around you, maybe it seems like you try to hard with her? Whenever I'm with this guy who likes me I tend to feel very awkward because he is always trying too hard and it gets annoying. I think you should talk with her, if it doesn't seem like she likes you then break up and go after the girl who DOES like you.|`|jGsA9p2Vaa	You should definately break up with her. She is a flirty girl who wants what she doesnt have. She doesnt deserve you and doesnt treat you right. You should definately talk to the other girl and find out if she wants to be with you and then if she does tell your girlfriend that you are moving on the better things. :) Hope this helps! good luck!|`|gch0VuDjaa	Well if i were you i would drop that chick in a flash. Sounds like she is more into your friends than you. Do you really want a girl who doesn't even acknowledged the fact that you are alive. Leave her and give the other girl a chance she seems more into you than your girlfriend does.|`|P38ULZbraa	You should talk to your girlfriend and explain how you feel, tell her that you don't appreciate her talking to other guys on the phone all night. If she doesn't change,  go for the other girl. Good luck.|`|40xAVBblaa	i'd break up with your girlfriend sounds like she's more interested in your friends than you an no one deserves that   I  would be friends with this other girl an give it a lil time before you ask her out   Good luck   hope it all works out for you|`|AxH9mWKkaa	Your best bet is asking her what is up. Tell her what you've noticed,she will value your observations. I am sure she has an explanation. If nothing else she may tell you that she isn't feeling you, and she prefers your friends, in which case there is still the other girl that you seem to feel a mutual attraction for. Asking her  is a win win situation, either you get a good answer and can move on with your relationship, or you will find out how she really feels and you can move on in general. Just don't make assumptions. I care about my boyfriend but often find myself joking around with his roomate more than him(my boyfriend is a couple years older than me and his roomate is my age, so sometimes we have more interesting things to talk about but I am not attracted to him). Just ask! What can it hurt?|`|0as3zz6yaa	Confront your girlfriend about her true feelings for you, if you still feel that she isn't that in to you then move on. Like you said this other girlk really likes you and i can tell you like her to. Maybe this other girl would be a better girl for you.|`|QSJDp6E2aa	i think u should dump ur gf   if she enjoys time with this jake then let her have all the time with him   the other girl likes u a lot aparently   dont waste ur time on a girl who isnt worth it     that is the only advise that i think would be fair     i know how it feels|`|0100846a42e702559413a87fbcc9a325aa	Well I believe that you should ask your girl about it and if she doesn't really have feelings for you then IF you HAVE FEELINGS for the other chick then go for it. But if you don't like her, don't go after her just for the attention. You don't want to decieve her. From a teenage girls perspective, trust me, it hurts.    Good luck|`|hldhKbTBaa	Ok break up with your girlfriend for the other girl!|`|61ac31c8cf1fe422123c2f2de8c1a709aa	Dump her!  Old lame girlfriend ftl.  New cool girl FTW.|`|bXDKvEMKaa	well if she is not speaking to you just have a little chat with for like 1 min saying stuff like do u still love me (fancie) and she will probabley say no butthat'ss according to what you have write and if she dumps you or you dump her wait 1 week then go out with the other girl :)|`|6dyF5XJ7aa	Follow your heart and instincts. It seems that this girl doesn't like you as much as you like her, or you are making her uncomfortable, possibly you are smothering her. You should ask HER directly though.   Most relationships die from lack of communication and assumptions.|`|MwynYtfBaa	Tell her what your thinking, tell her that you feel she doesnt show much respect towards you, and u feel that she doesnt want to spend time with you. Maybe this will make her realise and change, but if she carries on and your unhappy with it, its best to end it with her. Dont go stragth to the other girl because that would just be playing, get to know th eother girl first and see how it goes. Good luck. x
NREqhragaa	umm well its not as wild as freaking weird... but wen i was 6... i watched the titanic for the fist time... and i got relly scared about it... so i would have these "nightmares" and then i would like take off my clothes in my sleep and like dance... and sing "my heart will go on" ina british accent...  so i was at a sleep over... and bamm. i started doing it.. and yeah. her parents had to wake me up... :X it was relly embaressing...|`|RvFwmQOPaa	When my ex-boyfriend broke up with me, I had his car stolen and stripped because I was a cosigner on it and he wouldn't take my name off of the title.

SWUAs6dJaa	The smile and eye contact, how she walks around the room. When she is smart but makes a easy mistake and admits it. If she gets a perky when you ask her about her day.  Sometimes there are just little things like there is a waitress that I know that is too cute, it is adorable gets on her tip toes to look around and check her tables.|`|cG7z70Vgaa	The cutest thing a girl can ever do is smile and look at someone as if they are admiring them.|`|AA10960224	Buy some groceries for him and leave in his door. I thought that was cool of my gf.
XtLZXIEyaa	I liked my date and wanted to see him again but he said I had a nice personality and was personable but I was physically unattractive to him.  (I had makeup on and hair was nice.)  He said he was attracted to petite women and I was medium build.  I guess I wasn't skinny enough for him.  This guy was 40 years old.|`|eSI9c4Ncaa	Hmmm....there was this date I went on with my most recent ex. We were at the same restaraunt (which I can't even go to any more because he ruined it) on the same old unimaginative date, when he notices his ex wifes car outside. He disappears for awhile to "use the restroom" and comes back claiming to have the stomach flu or explosive diarreah or something. When driving me home he told me how much it bothered him that people stare at us, because we were an interracial couple in the South. A couple days later I dumped him. Loser    Anyway I'm looking forward to dates that are actually good in 2009.
fdd19f6be025884e97942d805edfbe1daa	Oh... once I got asked out via voicemail, and turned up... only to find out it wasn't the Emma I thought it was. I met one Emma's group of friends, then the other Emma... and then I was looking so blank that I just had to explain myself. Long story short, she went out with her ex shortly after. Poor thing... I'd have gladly gone out with her, I was just expecting the other one...    And my other one was a fantastic relaxed first date... only on my way home I collapsed and got a concussion (completely sober btw!), sent a few frantic text messages and then she didn't hear from me again for two days til I got out of accident & emergency. So yeah... that coulda gone better.|`|ZqHqKDqEaa	I went out with this guy that repeatedly kept asking me out. I finally agreed, we went to the movies, and when we got to the counter he turned his head, so I paid for the tickets. I thought he would spring for the refreshments and popcorn, but he claimed he didn't want anything. I ordered something, no sooner than I got it, he asked for some. During the movie, I kept thinking to myself this guy is a loser. After the movie I made up an excuse to leave.  Whenever he called I didn't pick up or return his call, eventually he got the message.     That's one date I wish I would never have gone on.|`|K1iUzewyaa	I was younger trying to be cool. Wanted to take a very pretty girl, "ami" to Bennihana's.. Anyway, they close at around 12 p.m. for clean up or something.. So they were not open. Ended up going to TGIF instead... or was it applebee's? not sure.. It was good conversation, but kind of cheesy atmosphere.. I ended up giving her a little birthday present, and a balloon that said "over the hill," needless to say,that was our first and last date. She was only turning 20 or something. What a moron... oh well.  This would have to be do-over... but went on a date one time with another girl.. she wanted to go to this restaurant and when we got there, i said this place looks ghetto.. She got all upset and started crying, because she thought I was degrading her taste... I said, let's go in, but she was pissed. We ended up going to Denny's or something like that, and a big fight. We were a couple. I actually went to that restaurant a little later, and the food was awesome...  Del Sol.. felt like a big asshole and well deserved...|`|pYVvI8Ogaa	I never had one.|`|4KMSKrxQaa	havent had 1 yet|`|QaVerTAfaa	ok, so me and my date were eating at a resturaunt. just hanging out and my mom and dad walked in and sat like five tables away. i jetted out of the resturaunt as FAST as i could ! so embarrasing. another was when he wore a bathing suit to a POOLSIDE party. i had a nice little sundress on and he wore a hawaiin print bathing suit|`|gcrkg04Xaa	i once went on what i thought was a 'date' with a guy, i got there n he was acting a little awkward throughout the whole thing (we went to the cinemas) and i told our mutual friend when i got home, turns out he'd told our other mutual friend that he thought it was a group thing. gutted LMAO!|`|JII8tDbjaa	the second date i went on with my boyfriend. we went to see a movie and it was terrible i mean it was the worst movie ever. it might not have been the worst date cuz after we saw it we made fun of it and it was funny. but it was a weird date.|`|AqXadhUzaa	Okay, Ill share one with you in script-form:    Me: Hi, sorry Im late, traffic. Your Liz?    Liz: It's Elizabeth, actually.    Me: Oh, well, your Elizabeth.    Elizabeth: Yeah, I guess your Dave.    Me: It's David actually.    Elizabeth: Oh, I see what you did there.    Me: Well, if were going to be formal.     Elizabeth: I find that offensive.    Me: Sorry? I wa--    Elizabeth: Just because I have big breasts and an *** that screams Kardashian, you think you can short-slang me, huh ***** !    { At this point, I realised Liz, rather Elizabeth, was a freak. So, I needed to ... leg it }    Me: Okay, are you kidding me?     Elizabeth: No Im not kidding you. Do these lips lie!    Me: Im leaving now!    Elizabeth: Why! Im still hungry !          True story. I swear.|`|LROAETQCaa	vv|`|8Yz1gFGVaa	Well, this one wasn't my date...but it was disaterous! I went with a girl friend and her sister as chaperone on their double date. I drove so they could get to know the guys. When we got to the guy's house...it was in the middle of the ghetto and we got lost. We finally make it to the house, and the guys who come out do not look anything like they said they did. They were almost deliverance quality.     I start to head to the concert, and they guys let us know about 15 mins later that they never got tickets and had no money. We drove to a local park, just so they could hang out. One of the girls got on the swing set ( we are all in our mid 20's) and one of the guys went to push her, but grabbed her butt and knocked her off the swing instead. The girls had had enough at this point, so I drove back to the guys' house. We got to the home and the larger of the guys starts to manhandle the older girl. I get out of the car and pull her away, at which point this creep slaps a hand-cuff on me and chains me to his chain link fence. He throws the key in his yard. He tells the girls to get in the car and leav and starts to walk towards them, herding them towards the car. Luckily for me, the guy's little sister came outside and I got her to hand me the key. We jumped in the car and hurried away. I dont know to this day if the girls ever talked to them again.|`|dLRquZ3Kaa	My first and last date =(...6th grade @ the movies with my boyfriend... we didnt say aword, we stared at eachother and blushed the whole time, 2 weekslater we broke up =(|`|HMhUKAgkaa	First date ever:    I was 15 and there was a guy at school (Jon) I really liked him. He was 17. He asked if I could come over to his house for dinner. His mom was cooking. So, I went to his house, we ate dinner, his family was really nice. Then, he asked me to go to his room (in the basement) with him and play video games or watch a movie. So I went downstairs with him and when we got down there, he locked his door. Then he dropped his pants and I started freaking out. He tried to get me to do stuff but I went upstairs and called my mom. That guy was a freak! I never talked to him again!|`|71ae4755ec6533f862aed7b1761c0dccaa	I met this really cute guy at my job and we talked on the phone a couple of times.  He asked me to go bowling with him, which I thought was so cute!  I'm really shy around new people, and when I met him at the bowling alley, he was there with about 10 of his friends!  I spent most of the night talking to a couple of girls, and he didn't even have me bowl with him.  It was the least amount of effort I've ever seen anyone put into a date!|`|dGL5xCrqaa	It was a first date, I was a sophomore in high school, he was a senior. He thought it would be a GREAT idea to took me to the place he was a bus boy at some crap fast food place. I'm a vegetarian, so I couldn't order anything but a salad and he even made the biggest deal when he didn't get a discount. A $1.50 date, thank you.   Then, it was freezing outside and he thought it would be cool to walk to the coffee place a few blocks down when his car was right there! No, he didn't offer me his jacket.  He finished off the date by bashing my brother and telling me I would be prettier if I wore make up. I was like 15 @ssh0le.
eQURLO8Eaa	you must be really strong to do something like that. you would have to put all of the negative things about the person behind you or forget about them completely. however, i think it's very easy for someone to grow on you, but not necessarily fall in love with.|`|IEfFafQsaa	ummmm not really. im pretty sure emotions are triggered by hormones which are pretty uncontrollable|`|D6PAncrxaa	Not really. You can't make yourself love someone.
tcUADMWFaa	Thats your decision. But you might wanna make sure your not the only dating guy cause you get a bad impression from others.  If its something a lot of people are doing go for it. If not wait. Your only 13 anyway, i wouldn't have been ready to date when i was that young.|`|qIaBOtltaa	IDK. depends on the kind of person you are.|`|uc0CYzpLaa	hmmmm have you hit puberty? that's a major dealy :D kidding.  i'm 17.  you should be uh.  i dunno?  there's an age where you date?  i was dating when i was in the womb dude.  ahahhaha  ehhhh   weird question..
zj4HeXEvaa	Sounds to me like he really likes you. He was probably hoping you would see him talking to another girl, get jealous and then maybe ask him out. Its not too late, get him alone and tell him how you feel. You've got nothing to lose.|`|hCJzZ5rnaa	I think he may really like you.    And a simple explanation for his actions would be that he is trying to make you jealous.    Tell me, you're not jealous, are you? Tell me his attempts are futile.|`|KI9wgRCcaa	its been five months. either yes you lost your chance, or hes sadly trying to make you jealous. and you areeeeeeee !!!!!!!!!!!!|`|3OT8Lmrgaa	He maybe trying to make you want him more, by talking to her.

It is a fact.

M7gf7Xoiaa	Girls really can.   Who knows, maybe she's like me and my mom. We used to have play slap fights all the time. We were good. I got really bitching at ***** slapping.
XI9e7OyEaa	There is no need to make fun of you. When they are talking about riding there boyfriends and such they are talking about being on top. I hope that makes sense to you.|`|5gKg5S0vaa	Having sex with girl on top
6EP71A7Baa	He's 14, of course he's immature.|`|EzmuhKRkaa	he sounds like a jerk.
YapMABSfaa	talk to him. if he just agrees to everything you say without thought then ask him if he's paying attention. You have to be firm with him.  For example:    You: Hey ___,  ___: Oh, hey. What's up?  You: How's everything with your new girlfriend?  ___: It's going good. Everything good with you?  You: Oh yea. I just wanted to ask you something... is that ok?  ___: Um yea sure.   You: (this is where you try and act all Puppy eyed and everything.) Remember when we broke up on New Years? (He'll probably have a "not this again look and if he does just say "here me out ok?") I just wanted to say that it was a mistake. I don't know what got over me. I have loved you since we met and every day with you was total happines... I'm really sorry that we had to end it that way and if i could go back and change it, i would. I know you are with your new girl and everything but if anything happens, you know i'm always here...   ___: Thanks. But what about you and your boyfriend?  You: Oh. I'm not too sure about him. I have a feeling that it wont work between me and him....   ____: (laughs) Alright. Thanks (you)! I'll keep all this in mind.        So if something goes wrong with his relationship you can confront him and try to soften things up... are you catching my drift here?    Well Im glad i could help anywayz. Good Luck!!!|`|AA11481308	I don't know what to tell you. When you broke up with him, you sent him the message that you were no longer interested. So he did what a lot of people do, and became interested in someone else.  If I were you, I would wait until his relationship with the new girlfriend is over, and then tell him how much you missed him, and that you want him back.  If he says no, you'll have to get over it too. If you're lucky, he will take you back and things should be okay.
0sPQnq7oaa	Hey now,  this happened to me a few times.  In fact, it happened to me twice in the same week by the same guy.  Wtf, mate?  He's just not into you.  I know its terrible, and theyre douches, but guys are big pu$$ies, and usually won't wanna tell you straight up he doesn't like you enough to be bothered to a)stick to his plan and hang out with you, and b) call you and let you know.  You deserve a date.  And you deserve a *****n phone call, and a reason as to why you are not out on that date.|`|gO9tl2uhaa	If he just cancelled and then asked you out again or you know, picked the phone up! well, it would be fine.    But he didn't. I guess he's not interested in you. Seriously, don't take this personally. if a guy isn't interested in you, just ditch him. It's not worth it to cry about it or to get mad.     He doesn't call? Screw him, you don't need that crap. You're worth better.
VnCVkHDhaa	i use those excuses all the time, i just say them, not when i don't like the person, just when i would prefer to stay in,|`|MSsLQuyCaa	He just wants a break. Don't talk to him for a while or ask him out. Wait till he asks you out.|`|rmC59Zv9aa	ok so i did this to a girl i was dating for like 2 years, i just told her i was busy since i didnt feel like talking to her right now... but didnt want to breakup with her either... just give him some space, let him talk to you, if he didnt contact you for a day, call him the next day and go out for coffee and let him know how you feel... thats what my girl did... it worked =)|`|MHwn4Tlzaa	he's making excuses to not talk to you or be around you.  i think the writing is on the wall.  it's about over.  sorry.|`|EsnFmcMFaa	tell him he should make time for you   and he cant keep saying hes busy    but maybe he is busy  does he go to college maybe he has a lot of work to do    why dont you ask him straight out if he is really busy or if he is cheating on you or if he has lost interest    just ask him it the best way to solve your problem    also being nice is a good thing  you just cant let people use you|`|69bp1IMfaa	You need to go to school and stop dating period. Too many grammar mistakes in your question, and stop interacting with him because he's not interested in you, go for the older guys.|`|9dc7211c44c17097c672d814b9900b0faa	no actually that means im busy.|`|Z7dnzyk7aa	You come off as desperate if you call him too often, that'll only push him away faster. make him be the next one to call. if he doesn't then forget about him.
tsdHndRhaa	some chicks just have a real low self worth about themselves and thats why they cling to guys who are not good for them and also the girl can be gorgeous and you still wonder why she keeps picking rotten apples, but it's always cause she does not think she deserves the best.|`|VrjF986Aaa	only trashy girls do, so no surprise that a girl on girls gone wild would like a douchey type guy|`|zdHsiepwaa	why do guys like the ho look?|`|AA10685337	Girls are impressionable, and you may find that what seems common sense to you as far as what girls like, IS NOT common sense to them.|`|B8Exjv8gaa	women are self haters and do anything to punish themselves even if its subconsciously|`|eNA4LIyFaa	define... "douchebag"    because everyone has a different opinion of what one is.    If you mean why are girls into that badboy look its because some girls look for adventure in a partner, and most badboys only look like that to the public but show the girl theyre with a completely different side... its just personal preference. Some girls like the romantic pretty boys, some like the rough, tough badboys that get into fights and ride bikes... you know the deal.

tsdHndRhaa	well iam a 33 year old afro- american woman and i don't think there should be a  big deal where you take her out because of her race and don't try to rule us eitheir cuz no woman likes that, just be mature and call her up and ask her what her interest are and what she likes to do? and then you will get ideas on where to go on your date.|`|Y0IlOTOqaa	Take her dancing.|`|Mqy4Iom6aa	the fact that shes african american doesnt help anything. plus since you did just meet her and you dont know what she likes, your probably better off asking her, or else you might end up doing something she REALLY doesnt like to do. Just ask her , but have a few ideas incase she says she doesnt care or doesnt know. That way you can suggest them to her.    Oh, and every one has a backbone, if they didnt they wouldnt be able to stand. So, no worries, she'll probably assume you have one.  =)   lmao. jk =P
GkO45d7uaa	I think you've got it pretty much covered. Foreign names work. My friend and I call these two girls Roberta and Juanita. Try names like Andreas, Pierre, Hans, Hansel, and so on. In general, you could call guys something like "the French."
sgyhGxLDaa	i think it'l be real nice and sweet if u were to make like a little scrap book and put pics and write something about all the good times you guys have had together and write how you feel about her and how ur never going to forget her and how shes always going to be there and in the end mention that its not good bye its laterz just an idea     when i was 18 and moved out of my moms house i was very homesick for the first couple of months specially because i was pregnant dont worry it will go away you'll get adjusted!! just think about how your going to have your BF there to support you and you guys are going to make a nice lil family together|`|eO4y3m1maa	I really liek the scrap book idea, and invite her to come see you!       Settling takes time, it will be awkward at first don't expect it to be like where you live now...you will make new and different friends...don't opennly trust everyone you meet cause you dont know them like your friend now..    good luck!! you will fine!!

AA10671142	yes I agree with you. I have seen the same questions about Jehovah Witnesses also. that we are a cult and brainwashed and why Kingdom Halls don't have windows. instead of learning about us, they rather listen to lies. also about the trinity. no place in the bible is the word trinity, but I have seen tons of questions about it.|`|dJkNofnoaa	haha yup|`|tsdHndRhaa	a stupid question is one that is unanswered.|`|alh9OsQXaa	Yes.

nxh8xxQvaa	Well, i understand where you're coming from, i'm homeschooled myself. There are rarely people on AIM or whatever instant messager is out there. I do know for a fact, however, that there are groups that you can join that have other homeschooled kids in them, so that you guys can meet up and have a social interaction. Hope that helps!|`|0Yqjaj15aa	go to the mall with a girlfriend and sit in the food court,join some clubs for your town or sport.go to ice skating rinks and places you know that willhave gusy your age.you wont get far if you dont go out.=/  but the best thing to do and what my friend did was she started going to highschool.  thats the best thing i can give you.=/  good luck|`|JRlMZeNhaa	"the internet" might not be the safiest way hun ,     What i suggest you do is ,    If you have friend(s) then ask them if they have any guy friends then ask if s(he) can introduce  you to them, then from there on you get there msn  // Fb , then make plans from there , edventually he'll fall in love avecc youu

One of the most confusing and puzzling question can be trying to figure out does he like me or not. Most guys tend to send out mixed signals which often makes it really confusing for most girls to figure out whether he likes them or not. You can never be hundred percent sure about whether he likes you or not yet there are certain ways to figure out what he is actually looking for. Read on to discover some of the proven ways to figure out whether he likes you or not.    He would smile at you a lot- When a guy likes you he would tend to smile more than usual when he is looking at you. You can always make out from a guys smile whether he likes you or not just based on the way he smiles. If he passes an invitational smile towards you as if he is willing to have a word than he definitely likes you.    Finds a reason to have a word with you- If a guy likes you than he would find all possible reasons to get in conversation with you and would be willing to get your attention as much as possible. The best way to guess whether he likes you or not is to simply read between his lines. When a guy normally tends to like a girl he would always give small hints within the conversation that he fancies you and would love to go out with you.    Catch his stare- This is probably one of the best ways to figure out whether a guy likes you or not. If he likes you than he would stare at you in a different manner different from how he looks at other people.    He keeps looking- If a guy likes you than he would keep looking towards you even after you have had a word with him. For example he would always keep looking at you even if you pass by him. The best way to find out whether he is looking or not is to simply turn your head around and catch his stare.    Constantly tries to impress you- When a guy tries to impress girl than he definitely likes her. If he is always dressed well around you and tries to present himself in the best of his behavior than he is definitely likes you and is waiting for an indication or signal from your side.
0mhcCyE5aa	If she giggles or laughs a lot.    If she is complimenting you.    If she looks at you and not the other person at the table.    If she touches you.    If she play with her hair or something else while talking to you.    Hope this helps!
BJQCt30Maa	if it wasn't you first off he would'nt have to told you and if he had, then he would have told you who it was. he's in to you. go for it.
aLwrpMPXaa	LOL ! They simply know all about your 'foot fetish' ! You must have told some girl and she made sure, the whole school knows about it !|`|eSDNSq4zaa	ew those girls are freaks.|`|GaouUtGTaa	I suppose they are flirting with you. the whole look at feet thing.. is like WHO wants to smell your feet lolz. its kinda funny for a guy to say " Look at my cute feet" Lmao|`|yMRY5cgxaa	Maybe they think you have a foot fetish and are just teasin you...
VB3ZK5f9aa	You're torn....limb from limb if any feminist ever found you in the real world.  Much laughter.    yumiyuka was good for much yukas.

Idiot.|`|Y4Ye3OLOaa	Is she an Oompa Loompa?|`|0as3zz6yaa	Wow.....um...?     Are you crazy?|`|nxh8xxQvaa	You're not torn, you're an idiot. If you don't like someone because of their height, i'm pretty sure you have issues. That, and the fact that you sounded a little *too* cocky there. You're probably about to break someone's heart.|`|R5eXmRo3aa	You obviously have the IQ of a rodent.    "Being that she is short, and I am actually smarter than her, I think it's time that I move on and find someone better to breed with."    You make it like she is some joke to you? She is a human being, not some lab mice you can reproduce to further upholster your worthless needs.    If you have been together for two years, then you obviously shouldn't have even been with her in the first. You stated positive things about her, and the only negative I read is that she is short. Stop being such a pretentious person, and learn to accept someone for who they really are.     And 5'1, is not short, unless she is like 4'6 or 4'5, then yes you can somewhat express some type of dislike. But that still does not give you a valid opinion to treat someone like that.    And btw, your not educated, your just stupid. (Note the fact I said your, and you're.)     I'm torn at the fact such morons live in USA.|`|tMURptI6aa	LOL, way to get ppl all worked up. I needed some entertainment.   Chuck E Cheese Rules!!!|`|oC8U5Bl5aa	if you think she is short then i must be a dwarf cause i'm 5 ft even.|`|8IHfytEvaa	When she reads this question she will be asking:    "What do you do when you realize your boyfriend is too dumb for breeding?"|`|oMmEEL8Jaa	just be gay then we wont worry about you spreading your pretentious genes anywhere|`|7nL1jY32aa	lol...that is horrible.|`|UL6FcEliaa	Maybe she needs some carefully placed blueberry gum to expand her hips?|`|WxEmrNAOaa	surely this question is a joke?!! what a male chauvinist pig you are!! goodluck because you are going to get dumped soon|`|3HhhHWd4aa	Dump her for a taller chick if you want to...|`|Uy8ntukjaa	I seriously hope this question is a joke because you sound vapid, shallow, and quite frankly like a pig. There are plenty of intelligent women in the U.S. who are educated and have morals. You won't find one however because they're far too intelligent to fall for a lout like you. I suggest you break up with your girlfriend immediately so she can gain back some self respect and find a real man to date.|`|OuOOy8v3aa	She isn't too short to have children.    Grow up, she should leave you if all you can do is slag her off online.

HOQp0gA7aa	This is easy.  She has a boyfriend at the moment, no matter how rocky their relationship is at the moment.  If you like her, just tell her in person that you like her, and want to stay friends after school is over.  Don't offer to date her, don't make a pass at her, and don't flirt with her.      If things are as rocky with her boyfriend as you believe, then when things are over between them she might be likely to come look you up.  However, you are an available 18 year old presumably heading to college soon.  If your college experience is anything like mine, then there will be scores of available women around looking for boyfriends in college.      Why would you want to lock out your future social life waiting for this one girl?      You would just be tied down and kicking yourself in the butt that you can't take advantage of all the other opportunities for casual dating in college.  You're very young yet (from my perspective), live your life a little before you get all serious about having a deep relationship with someone who has a boyfriend already.    I hope this helps.|`|x3LclBZ0aa	i think this is just a can of worm you should leave unopened. shes in a relationship and it doesnt matter if its going south or not. you dont have the right to interfere. dont be the proverbial snake in the garden.  find someone else to mess with. if one day, she becomes single again, then by all means chase her. but for now, stay away.|`|lj2tpz46aa	you need to tell her but tell her in a nice way because you dont need that bf started dram just choose your words wisely|`|xDoemlGYaa	Ya I got  ........|...  ........|..........2 Points..........|||"|""\__  ........|__________________|||_|___|)  ........!(@)'(@)""""**!(@)(@)****!(@)|`|srRZe8YAaa	idk!

AA12068160	The court judges are not idiots.  If the stable parent has reservations, unfortunately the troubled parent might have problems.

You shouldn't let rumors upset you so much.  If you know they are false, then who really cares what these other people, who mght just be jealous of you, say?  Just ignore them.
9YsSlje3aa	Give her some space you know. Try the friend thing, but at the same time show her that you still have feelings for her and that you would do anything that makes her happy since you love her. She might have other problems going on and just doesn't need the extra drama. Be you and just be there for her. Don't give up though. I would also say that you pray about it. Hopes this helps.    ~IM JUST ME~|`|pUcS1zS4aa	maybe you should just give it a break for awhile and realize that just because you say that sometimes it is your fault doesnt change the fact that u guys still fight. Give it a little break and u never know she might just need a friend right now at this point and thats what she needs you to be to her right now. Take some advice from a person that has been there.|`|gpNkuxNIaa	let her se you be happy with some one else then she will want u  or at least show her u can be happy with out her. either way she is not getting the attension from you or she has been cheatin oh ya drink  but dont let her know|`|OkbTzLScaa	i would say get over her you don't need her!!!!!! she does not run your life you do so if you  want to go out with do but i wouldn't because it would not be a very good idea for a good strong realtionship.|`|2HWefT0Gaa	Well write her a letter    Send her some flowers/chocolate    Make her see how bad you want her back    Try and take her out somewhere she likes and give her the time of her life!    Good luck and i hope you get ur girl back!|`|Q8L7NWjwaa	Give her some space~she may change her mind.  But as long as you continue to try when she may not be trying to hear any of it right now... she'll stand her ground!|`|onAEy5jTaa	Maybe she wants you to keep running behind her. Maybe she wants more attention from you before she finally takes you back! If she accepts you in a week's time, then attention was all she craved for. Or, she really is tired of you. She really wants to be left alone. I would suggest you let her be and get over her. Hope I helped.|`|4H4dUBkGaa	Sorry, but she left you and that is her right. Accusing her of being irrational is not going to help anything. Maybe she doesn't want to be in a relationship, or maybe she just doesn't want to be in a relationship...with you... life sucks, I know. My advice is to go for a new girl. Otherwise you won't get over this one.|`|IqoRBVUTaa	Leave the poor girl alone, or you'll push her even farther away! She doesn't want to be in a relationship, ok?!?!?! You guys can be so thick sometimes!!|`|MYbRICxqaa	Give her space and time to breathe. She only going to get angry and angry if you keep getting into her face. Maybe what she is feeling has nothing to do with you, but her own inner turmoil.|`|1k6UUC8qaa	im assuming you guys are young maybe she doesn't feel the way about you that she used to feel only time will tell i would stay away for a while see what happens.  in my experience this is usually the case but its ok she doesn't have to stay with you but don't let her shoot you down|`|DM3xodfqaa	than leave her alone|`|sYxZlwmjaa	it sounds like there might be something else behind her reasoning for leaving..just my opinion|`|0fVtHNtmaa	She's just tired of you.  Work on whatever issues caused you to fight with her and move on.|`|skWN7jWHaa	move on you cant force her into a relationship ,let her go|`|yDDeoJUPaa	"please see things my way instead of bein so irrational"!!!!????!!!!! wow man u blew it! she just wants to be alone for a while. dont push her|`|VANvNYEyaa	Give her some space for a little while. Let her cool off. If she's so insistant about leaving there may be an alternative motive besides the fighting. (maybe another guy she's into but doesnt wanna do anything while in a relationship with u. ITS A GUESS or assumption but dont quote me on it)   But after a week id call her. ask if u can have an adult conversation about what happend. what caused the "loss of interest" so to speak. talk it out. dont try to raise ur voice at all it just causes a fight. even if she raises her voice she realize ur being the better person by not turing it into a fight.|`|d5aa461bdb5fa1bfd8158df539805abeaa	Luis I think that she already has someone else.  It sounds like it is time to move on gracefully.|`|ifC1aFHxaa	Sorry, buddy, but the essence of a romantic relationship is the mutuality of it. If it is one-sided, it is either:  1. called "stalking"  2. bordering on pathetic,  3. just gettin' started.  This one could be in the number 2 position.  BTW - calling someone irrational is no way to win them back.  Take your lumps, move on and look for someone who wants to be with you.|`|xx4MSADIaa	great if she still wants to sleep with you though!|`|MHQVnqaXaa	back off and let her have time to cool down. dont keep hunting her and begging all the time. it gets really annoying after a while. give her SPACE means no phone calls, no hanging out, no nothing. at least for a while. then try to talk. TALK not beg. with no strings attached. you arent bout to hop right back into a relationship after this lil break.|`|QL6x5NrEaa	I would give here some space and see how that turns out. However, she could be just using that as an excuse for something else.|`|4cd6c2676e153ff5f86ecd5293cdd12caa	Sorry to hear that. Unfortunately she's testing the grass on the other side. Just my opinion, but leave her be, and if and when she's ready she'll come back, just be sure she comes back for the right reasons (ie. can't find another bf, needs something, sex, etc.) Be careful, listen to your heart, not your head!!! GOOD LUCK!!
DyPVKQg6aa	Im not sure you're going to find a guy who doesn't prefer a chest and booty; well at first anyways. Appearances are the first impression a guy has on a girl. The good guys will see you but also get to know you before passing full judgement, and who doesn't cheat.  That's how I operate with women anyways. That's how I got and am keeping my amazing girlfriend.  Truth be told there's not a lot of guys that have morals for the women they date. Us gentlemen are running short in the young ages. Sad but true. Just be patient and a gentleman will come along sooner or later. Hopefully sooner.    Good Luck.|`|wCqzSt34aa	yes there are a lot of us "good" guys out there but ubfortunately we r usually single cuz girls get to the guys that use them first and then we dont get a chance cuz they have trust issues, just have faith and im sure u will find a great guy
bQ2RWRGNaa	awwww, talk to your friend. be the friend she needs especially when she is depressed. you can pamper her and treat her by getting her hair done, new cloths and stuff to make her happy and feel better about herself. trust me it works. i had a friend like that once. she thought she was ugly and that noone like her.  i took her shopping and did all the above. at the end of the day, she was a new woman. she felt good and im proud of what i did for her :)|`|rO0LyKiUaa	I think you should ask her if there is anything you could do to help.    I think that even though you are leaving in a few months you should talk to her normally but be very nice to her at the  same time.  She may become a bit happier.    x|`|OvX1u8Suaa	you sound like a good friend she should have. ask her again,and let her know your there for her if she needs too talk.  its a shame theres not more ppl like you around instead of the vast amount of bullies these days .much respect too you.

ZWaRNMzVaa	Sorry, im in 7th grade but ill try the best i can!  Well, mayb she didnt call cuz she had something 2 do or since ur not bf/gf she didnt think bout calling......Well dont ask her 2 much questions, but if u arent doin anything, ask her on a date..........movies,restauraunt,ect.|`|CGcdZpztaa	10 points?okay. wateves. idk. icant tell u wat to say because i dont know her, ur her best friend. just tell her how you feel, and itll be okay. if she doesnt no wat to say, it means that she needs to think.    good luck :)|`|yuF2K1rLaa	Tell that ***** to slob on your knob  oh and check this out and send it to that girl to make her feel special.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHg5SJYRH...|`|rZuSN2kTaa	This is something that you could say  "So.......  who are all the guys that you think is cute?"|`|m1IQDoUAaa	All you have to do is ask her if she likes you or not! If she hesitates she is definitely not into you and move on! If she gets pissed at you talk to her and after you find out how she really feels ask your friends about what they think.   Hope that helps!|`|AdTnizwOaa	Okay so you're trying to figure out if this girl likes you? Well right now I think she's sort of freaked out (no offense) but your friend if he cussed her out like that, I would be defiantly. She seems careful not to hurt your feelings by playing the small talk and not making it awkward by saying    "Why did your friend call me today and start swearing at me?"     When she told your friend "i don't know if i like him or not" she might be meaning it, because maybe she hadn't even thought about it before and only thought of you as a friend. But now she may be leaning to the fact maybe she does like you that's why she's unsure now.    You can't make her like you and please don't force her, it'll make it awkward and uncomfortable instead of wanting a happy ending from her. You make the happy ending and you tell her that you like her, ask her out. Gain your confidence, you can do it. If she rejects, you may still remain friends, i think that's high chance you will. But i doubt she will reject. If she says maybe, she just needs time to think it over, so let her. =)|`|rfkVin6Iaa	It is just your wisdom teeth...why would she need to call you? It was stupid for your friend to do that. Just tell her that you do like her a lot and just to forget about this whole thing.|`|uA3yUdCzaa	you can't force her to do anything|`|PdIRHRZgaa	umm say im sorry 4 all that. and b nice & awesome.|`|RhXugkTtaa	talk bout ur relation ship.    fav quote  the key to a relationship is the key. if you dont have it, you cant get to the treasure|`|CRhS02q8aa	Dude......What??? Start over....you lost me.  Sounds like her mind is made up.|`|pF63IMyVaa	you have bad grammar and it was hard to understand what you were saying. next time use commas. anyways just be straight forward about your feelings. tell her exactly how you feel about her. quit playing around. no wonder she dunno how you feel. and its just wisdom teeth, its not like you were going for brain surgery.|`|GA5izZqGaa	That's a little confusing, but honestly just try to clear the air, if you like her, say so, and ask her the same. If she doesn't reciprocate, then just put the relationship on hold. Though I think it's so petty to start all of this drama over her not calling you to check up on your wisdom teeth, it's possible she might've forgotten (unless she promised you beforehand or something).     Anyway, good luck!|`|ct9GUupBaa	dont get your hopes up...if u do ull just get hurt even more...u need to find someone who likes u for u...u shouldnt have to try to make someone like u...my advice...STAY AWAY...she doesnt know what she wants but its obviously not u|`|x9VdD7GUaa	Praise GOd I am not in highschool anymore, cut your loses move on and find a girl that is not self involved and has enough care to be compasionate and check on you.|`|8nZtWHiBaa	be truthful and open. u might just not click. if u reli like her just tell her and gd luck.|`|PtqlQ5Anaa	honestly she sounds like a *****. Shes just not into you and a waste of your time. Just move on. You are the one who should reconsider your feelings and find a girl worth your time.     Also your best friend is an idiot for calling someone and cussing them out. It's not even a big enough deal to do that.|`|Llvro4h5aa	Can I have 10 points already!!|`|AlxN71yCaa	0_0 Yesss|`|Tc1BO5kkaa	tip: tell you friend to back off. its not his place to call her up and talk to her like that. when she calls i would apologize for how my friend acted to her. then its her choose from then on, because like you said you cant make her like you.|`|AA11600596	sounds like you are trying to hard.. make her chase you its what girls like to do...|`|cfJywdN2aa	Hmmm... Tell her your an easy goiing guy tell you would take her to the movies, for Valentines or somthing Its coming up *soon*.  Dont force her just ask her why do u not like me? And be honest. If she doesnt like you move on. There are other girls in the school. But you never know she may change her mind.|`|SJ5ipSvUaa	Tell her that you want to get to know her more because you think that you guys could like each other a lot if you both spent time together and talked on a regular basis. This will show her that you are actually into her and will erase the doubt that you like her from her mind.  Hope This Helped.  Good Luck :)|`|2k6lvvfJaa	tell u hav the balls of a rhinocerous,and the dick of sir kevin phillips of birmingham,    then go on 2 http://cbize.net/upload/document/pa%20Ch...  and sell her|`|Vsho9I4eaa	Just tell her how you feel. I know It may be to lovy dubby for most boys, but girls really dig that. I know. I am one. Tell her things about her, like her eyes or hair, that you like. hope this helps!|`|ramE4hiQaa	since you 2 arent technically* dating then technically* she doesnt have to check on you... Maybe she didnt call because she thought you wouldnt want to talk ...when you get them pulled you can barely speak ( a bunch of my friends have had them pulled) i say give her a break ...and tell your friend to back the hell off he had no right calling her... he was trying to have your back but failed miserably he just ****** up what you and that girl could have had... i'd move on ...and keep your friends out of your relationship...|`|o3pqrDAgaa	I would just straight up be like do you like me or not.No need to beat around the bush.Better asking her now and getting it over with now then later because then that can hurt worst.If she doesn't really like you then why waste your time with her.She wont really appreciate you for all you are worth if she isn't committed to the relationship in the first place.Good Luck!!!!!!!|`|sKw5GeeMaa	she's probably really confused right now. It feels kinda awkward calling someone asking, are you okay? What would you say? what if you picked the wrong words and made it sound like you couldnt care less if he was bawling his eyes out or not. She was probably nervous about calling you. She could have had other things on her mind, like a big project for school. My advice to you: dont get your friend to do everything for you.|`|IjSU81dvaa	Hey. I think that our girlfriend might be cheating on you. I am sorry to tell you that. But if she wont tell you why, maybe she is dating another guy or something. I got my tooth pulled! It hurt. But anyways. I think you should go to her house and ask her what is going on. Depending on our age. Tell her that you are sorry that she doesn't fee like yo love her anymore. Tell her that you will try harder. Tell her that you love her. Then hug her. Maybe take her a rose or something. I don't know. I am not n expert. But If I had a bf, that would be what I would want. Please vote me as best answer. Thanks.|`|gXAdOEmZaa	say 'I'm so sorry about my friend, he can be demanding a lot. I didn't mean to push u into an awkward situation. I feel so bad." she might just give you another chance|`|HvrgjsAjaa	just say your sorry|`|1yUrfAvgaa	just tell her how you really feel.   and stop getting your friend involved. I'm sure she doesn't like getting yelled at|`|9MO6Iu1laa	You sound like a very clingy person bob if you would've left her alone in the first place til you got back to school this never would've happened.But tell her your friend didn't mean you were just upset because she didn't call you. Tell her you really do like her but don't beg whatever you do!|`|WBpVZpb0aa	Sounds like she's unsure. Either of you or of relationships in general. Just give her time, talk to her, tell her your true feelings. You gotta poor your heart out like a beetch so she knows you're for real.|`|N0l2MFptaa	UHHH, what?|`|t58tRjwbaa	no. never make someone like you! and do not change yourself to please a dumb girl! if she doesnt like you for who you are then you dont need her. you should move on! and you have a good friend by the way!|`|hNvILDqLaa	be really sweet to her dont be a asshole like most guys   like how was your day and say sorry about your freind and stuff|`|5a7O9ErTaa	you seem like you really like her,   and in that case,   if she doesnt like you as much as you like her,  let her go.  be honest, and hope for the best.    hope it goes well :)|`|mUxeT7i6aa	you just need to play it cool she will call you when she wants to|`|ReGmJHbOaa	first ask what she was doing yesterday. if she comes up with a good explanaation, thats probably why she didnt call.  if she didnt, shes lieing. tell her yoU were hurt when she didnt call. if she ever comes around to saying she isnt sure if she likes ou, just say why? thatll make her feel bad about it and shell apologize. happily ever after? its best NOT to cry.|`|IoT9ZO7Haa	yes word it differently!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!... fast!!!!!!!|`|2S6iXcmCaa	shes just playing little games with u..if she didnt call u to see how ur dentist thing went then thats lame i dont think she has an excuse..she probably likes u but shes not ready to go out with u just give it sum time if its meant to be then it will happen..but just wait for her to call u tonight and just talk normal talk and if that subject comes up then it comes up|`|mewFgxtwaa	You just need to stop with all the bull with your best friend and deal with her yourself. Talk to her on the phone and just ask if she has feelings for you or not. If she doesn't then don't pressure her because that will not help AT ALL. You have to give a girl time to realize her feelings. And if those feeling are not there well then too bad be friends and find another girl.|`|NGT9HQmnaa	Okay please listen very closely! Stop going through your friends! If you like her then you talk to her! Don't go through other people. That is so immature. You need to apologize for talking about her with your friends because that irritates females, tell her your sorry for for what he said to her and then your best bet is to tell her you are developing feelings for her and you would like to start FRESH & NEW! Don't get mad if she does not call you all the time. Most guys get annoyed by that so she is probably keeping a distance if you want her to call more simply say " I don't mind if you call me more often, when ever you have time. I love chatting with you & getting to know you". Then if she does not call more she must be busy! Don't forget what you said though you can't make her like you so start by letting her get to know you and hope that she does. Don't be overbearing though. Hope this help.|`|mVInwaeAaa	okay, first things first.  Some people are meant to be nothing more than friends.  Someone of the opposite gender can be one of your best friends, but never actually go out with you, or you could go out and find out that you were happier as friends.  Okay, that being said... Sometimes girls don't call - they don't want to seem annoying.  If she is known to be a girl that likes to 'cling' then maybe she is trying to change that.  If she knew you were getting your teeth pulled, she may have thought it would be difficult for you to talk and didn't know your appointment was canceled.  There are many reason that she may not have called.  Don't jump to conclusions.    As for what you can try to do.  Girls (well at least the ones like me - obvously I cannot speak for everyone) like it when you are yourself.  Dont act like someone you are not.  Talk to her, do little things that may seem pointless to you - but girls - we noticie the little things.  Compliment her if she gets new shoes or does her hair different.  I know it seems mushy and kinda "childish" but you'd be amazed.  Hold the door for her and just ask her to hang out with you.    Ask her to go on a date, and if she says yes - great, and if she doesnt want to then just be friends.  If she doesnt want to hang out with you because you asked - then she wasnt a very good friend to begin with.    So I'm hoping I answered your question somehow.  Good Luck to you :)|`|TB5vvM3aaa	you dont need to try to make her reconsider, per say, as she said she didn't know if she liked you or not as opposed to 'i don't like him.' im a freshmen (girl) in high school and do have some advice. first off, tell her you'll call, not the other way around. second, don't tell your friend about your love life anymore because he might ruin something for you. apologize for your friend cussing her out and dont pressure her to like you. instead, say you understand she doesnt know her feelings towards you (and be forward with it) but you do like her and if she decides that she doesn't like you in that sence then say you're glad to have her as your friend and enjoy her company. so basically, say you like her but dont pressure her to like you back. she'll appreciate that and like you all the more for it. i wish you luck!|`|3CWaHiR1aa	If the girl likes jokes: "My love for you is like diaherra, I cannot hold it in!" lol thats what some guy said to me.    If she's more serious: "I love you." Keeping it simple.      P.S. Your best friend is a jerk. Tell him about Jesus.
fd800537157025b01ab2fd3e2bfd7b53aa	Yes, I have been through a divorce after being married for 14 years. It wasn't easy, but I've gone through it.     Stay in the present moment and do what needs to be done at the moment. Don't look back, don't think ahead. If you're doing the dishes now, concentrate on the dish you are holding.     We are all conditioned that having bad feelings is not OK. But harder you try to suppress them, stronger they come back. It is normal to feel sad. It is natural to think that things could have been better, different, or more. You will feel sad every now and then. Stop wishing you've done things differently. Remind yourself that you did the best you could at any given moment. Back then you didn't have the knowledge that you have now. Being hard on yourself will not fix anything. Become your own best friend. Try to treat yourself as you would treat your best friend in a similar situation.|`|af644b7256e7bf5a53974bb99a32d482aa	Yes, mine left me after 24 years for another woman.

Good luck, hun.|`|5NKa5Y8laa	Stay away from him, and only see him if you have to, for divorce proceedings, access visits with kids (if any).      Surround yourself with loving and supportive family and friends.  They really are invaluable at this time of your life, and will help you get through it.      Enjoy the freedom of being away from a controlling husband, do what you want, and have as much fun as possible.    Read self-help books and attend counselling to gain more self esteem, and work out what you want from this opportunity to start fresh again.    I wish you all the best.
UtrgRjTeaa	Tip 1: Confidence is attractive. Finding the courage to talk to him will make him like you more. You don't have to change who you are (I'm sure your shyness is part of why he likes you), but someone has to be the first one to step up and suggest that the two of you spend time together. If it's you, he'll feel less "on-the-spot" and he'll also feel attractive (and, as a guy, I know that one of the best things a woman can do is make her guy feel attractive. It's simple, but appealing to our egos really does work).    Tip 2: Slow relationships are usually stronger. If you're really interested in this guy, get to know him more first. If the two of you are right for each other, then the more you know about each other, the more you'll like each other. Don't risk too much of your heart too early.    Tip 3: Communication is everything. If you do wind up with this guy, learn to overcome your nervousness and tell him things that you're feeling. This isn't always verbal -- find the way that works for the two of you, but be sure to keep communicating, or the relationship won't work out.|`|f5AdfVuOaa	gee lots of info. ok get another friend that will talk talk to him & find out if he does like you more....i think that's best as your confidence is low (cuz ur shy) so they can find out & if he does like you tell your friend that you want to talk more with him & go from there.  Good luck & keep having fun...

47af2fda89839c0ec02e273cff59d82daa	while im not sure on how the custom or tradition or whatever you want to call it arose, i think the best way to decline would be to say  "i would absolutly love to be your bridesmaid, but im not sure i can afford to pay for my dress and shoes and everything else that is expected of me" that way they know you would love to if you could afford to and that it totally isnt their fault      for my upcoming wedding, i gave my brides very simple instructions. i said to them "any dress you want, as long as its black, and made of a similar material to my dress".  that way everyone gets a dress that they like and looks good on them, and they all can get something that fits into their price range.|`|OIJ3JBkSaa	Despite the statements of many folks on this site the tradition for many many years was the bride's family paid for the dresses.    its only been the past decade or so that things have been changed so much that now many brides feel the honor of being in their wedding party includes a hefty price tag.  Some brides, in fact, many brides are conscious of the cost and try to make sure the dresses are affordable and are dresses the girls will be able wear again for dinner dates, cocktail parties etc.  but we still have brides who have no concern whatsoever for anyone else's feelings or budgets. some brides ask why they should have to pay for the attendants meal at the reception. some brides demand their attendants purchase very expensive gowns that will never be worn again. we even recently had a bride try to force her attendants to pay for their bouquets.  they don't stop and think about the attendants having travel expenses, hotel accomodations, losing a day or two pay, etc.  and lets make it clear right now grooms are just as bad.  they expect their men to pay for their tuxes, etc. and the same travel expenses the girls will have if its an out of town wedding.  you also have to factor in the cost of shower gifts, bachelor parties, wedding gifts.   when asked to be a bridesmaid you have to ask is the wedding going to be held in the town you live in and if not that is a pretty easy out for you - you simply say the cost of travel is just too much right now and/or you do not have any holiday time coming to you.  you also have to ask what the bride expects from you both financially and time wise.  what kind of dress does she want you to wear and how expensive is it going to be? also if your friend is a high-maintenance girl she is going to be even worse as a bride to be.  you just have to be honest and ask her to be the same. in fact i always counsel brides to be to ask only their closest and dearest friends to be in their wedding party - not someone they went to college with ten years ago and haven't seen since, not someone they met last fall at work and have fun lunches with.  and i suggest that when you are asked you look at it the same way - is this someone you care about deeply and won't mind spending money and time on.    in short sweetie only do it for those you truly love!  with your attitude you are going to be a great bride and your friends will love to be with you on your wedding day!  take care!|`|2o3BHgCCaa	Because you pay for your own clothing. It is something they can keep or sell to get some money back.  If you don't want to pay for it then don't be in the wedding. Easy as that!|`|AA11138696	The custom arose from the fact that people pay for their own clothing.  IF you accepted the honor of being in the wedding party you accept the costs.  IF you cannot afford it you do not accept.  Why should the bride have to pay for your dress?  If you cannot  afford to participate you simply say so.|`|6fLxNyVpaa	it actually just depends my husband sister had me as a brides maid and they paid for the dress also when i got married we paid for the dresses i didn't make them pay for it at all.|`|445676ee4ba9ef6e5bd44f0f3b9d7501aa	I didn't expect anyone to pay to be part of my wedding.  My husband and I paid for all of the bridesmaids' and groomsmen's attire.    Money doesn't come easy to everyone, and I didn't want to make any assumptions as to whether someone can afford it or not...so we just worked it all into part of our wedding budget.    I don't know how the custom arose, but it is always acceptable to tell the bride that "Thank you, and I am honored that you selected me.  However, I simply cannot afford to be part of the bridal party (for XYZ reasons).  I wish you and your future spouse the very best nonetheless."|`|RqRQqQ86aa	It is not required that bridesmaids pay for their dresses.  Often, they are asked to buy their own dress when the bride/groom and their families cannot afford to pay for everything on their own.  If a bridesmaid cannot afford to pay, she should just be honest and tell the bride in ADVANCE that she cannot.  Don't wait until it is to pay for dresses to tell the bride.  Also, it is the bride's responsibility to ask her bridesmaids in enough time to allow them to save/make arrangements in order to purchase the dress.|`|0056ba0f2ca4852a4f7b389766f314d4aa	Traditionally, they're not supposed to pay to be in a wedding. Being in a wedding is an honor and there is not supposed to be a cost associated to be in one.     In the "old days", parents who had daughters began to start a wedding fund when the daughter was young and the parents paid for the entire wedding, the reception, and the cost of the bridal party including travel and lodging. They also used to pay for the travel and lodging of any out of town guests. This was when daughters were not self-sufficient and were married off to men to get them out of the house.     However, as times have progressed and more couples pay for their own wedding as opposed to the bride's parents paying for everything, bride's have put the financial burden of being in the wedding back on their bridal party as a way to cut costs. Some people don't particularly agree with this as you should not have to shell out a load of money for what is supposed to be an honorary position. But that's just the way times have changed. It is now, for the most part, customary for the bridal party to pay their own way. (My parents just gave my sister a large check for her wedding and told her to use it any way she wanted. She asked me and my other sister to be bridesmaids. Two months before the wedding, she called us and told her own sisters we needed to send her a check for the dresses and shoes!! She also didn't have a bar at the reception; she and her fiance just pocketed the money.)     So now, it's just a matter of finances for the couple and their parents. I've been in weddings where the brides parents paid for EVERYTHING (including my plane tickets, taxis, and hotel) and I've also traveled to destination weddings where I shelled out over $2000 just to be in the wedding.|`|AA10517735	many brides are now choosing fashionable bridesmaid dresses that can be reused and are very practical...    also im sure that if the economy stays like this brides will realize that people cannot spend a ton of money on THEIR wedding! so they will take that into consideration when choosing the dress.|`|aR8fwFW8aa	I always answer these questions the same way - bridesmaids shouldn't have to pay for their clothing, shoes or hair if the Bride wants something specific.  I have paid for all of these things for my daughter's weddings (3 daughters, 2 married) and will again.  I think it is wrong to expect people to pay for a dress that they will wear for a few hours and never again.    As a result, we had no "bridesmaidzilla" moments - all the girls helped out tremendously with whatever needed to be done.  None of this "she won't return my calls" and stuff like that.      I may be old fashioned, but I just do not think that they should pay for their dress.    Interestingly enough, I always get tons of thumbs down for this.  I just can't imagine spending 20k (or more) on a wedding and being too cheap to pay for the girl's dresses.|`|HiSVA9p8aa	People pay for their dress because it is THEIR dress.      Many brides are mindful of the costs and work with the woman to select a dress that is flattering to all and that fits within all budgets.    Some brides choose to pay a portion of the cost of the dress or even the full cost.  I would never expect a bride to pay for my dress, but I sure wouldn't turn it down.|`|ECe1rgsdaa	Well, I guess it is technically their dress... I still am not fond of it, but I get it. There is no way I could afford to pay for all my girls dresses (6 of them). My budget is about $6,000. So there isn't a lot of money (like the 20 grand suggested) to play around with. I am just telling them to get whatever dress they want, as long as it is the same red color. That way, I know they will like the style at least, so they will likely wear it again. I have been on both sides of the BM dress issue.     As it happens, I am in a wedding where I was told I could get any style I wanted. They picked a green color I don't really like, but I wouldn't dare tell her that! Now, I am being told I do have to get a certain dress that I know I will never wear again! It sucks. But  there is no way I wouldn't be there to support my friend. You do what you gotta do.     If someone couldn't afford to be my BM, I would want them to tell it to me straight. I would completely understand.|`|76nTvO4iaa	I don't know about the "custom" part of it.    I never bought a bridesmaid dress when I was in weddings after college - they were always paid for.    When my youngest daughter got married, I bought the dresses for her bridesmaids & MOH.    All the weddings my youngest & oldest daughter have been in - their dresses have been paid for.    I am a middle class person.  My friends are middle class people.  We consider the bridesmaids dresses & associated expenses part of the wedding and budget accordingly.  We feel that the bridesmaids (who are either broke students or young professionals just getting started)  shouldn't have to buy dresses they'll wear once or pay for their hotel rooms.     These young ladies spend  of their short in supply money throwing showers, bachelorettes and traveling to where they need to be.  They shouldn't be stuck paying for a dress, hair, makeup and hotel in order to prove to my daughter that they care about her.|`|GXM74MGPaa	because its a "honor" for them to be picked to be in the wedding party. haha. plus they get a gift.
QnY1yWBIaa	lol me and mt friends do the same thing. its so funny how they look at you like were crazy  pick me as best answer please[=|`|dE3Uozfwaa	It's really nothing that should make anyone uncomfortable.  It's just like a thing you stick up your vag. :p Haha.  But seriously, I love tampons. They're way better then pads! :D|`|ucQyVlZGaa	U can really watch them cringe when u ask them to go to the store to buy u some.|`|4UqL6SY0aa	guys need to get over it, i know a few that have|`|jC9J0Ctuaa	yes only immature gals bring up such topics its such uncouth guys just react because they think they should to be manly its all a show, we dont really care.|`|S0Ur5SGQaa	my friend does that at lunch i feel kinda bad for the whole two guys that sit at our table then if someone gets a cut she whips a out a bad they freak poor guys :\|`|HZtgNnfPaa	it's really kinda immature :]
aIEkNM0Paa	No normal|`|1uvrkDWNaa	Nothing wrong with that.  At least you're not settling for just anyone for the sake of having a boyfriend. Good for you.|`|L38M9lrLaa	Not at all it takes alot of drama out of your life. i went thru that phase for 2 years..i was the happiest i have ever been there was barely any stress and i was happy with myself..it was nice.|`|H9AlDTZOaa	its weird that you would even think thats weird:)|`|0qm2raXBaa	No, I think that's great!!! Good for you, you sound like a very mature 16 year old.  Keep doing what you're doing.  If the right guy comes, he will come.  Besides, you're really young.  Enjoy your youth and childhood.|`|BeTBLiCoaa	No It's not weird! Just wait for the one that makes you feel butterflies in you stomach|`|3dWxPIlQaa	nope, not weird at all|`|Talzm1x7aa	nopee|`|VZPtCkweaa	that's not weird at all! and i mean that sincerely. you don't need a guy to make you happy!|`|tegyqU6Raa	RIGHT ON. Don't be afraid to not want a boyfriend. PDA is so not cool. Maybe the right guy is not ready for you yet. He maybe still becoming a man. Don't worry. Enjoy being single.|`|SaTfE6TEaa	Nope, that's why i don't really care about having a girlfriend right now ,because i've got college and that might interfere with college plus the tons of work i have to concentrate on and finish.|`|5699ac9816ed1f9d3230e170b3ef4793aa	Nothing wrong with that. Millions of people go about thinking like that every day. For the first time in a long time, census polls show that single people outnumber married people. You aren't weird, you're actually in the majority.|`|ahXIBlstaa	I am the same way, its normal.|`|7aisLVeiaa	No, not at all. It just means you aren't ready yet, that's all. As a matter of fact, that shows a sign of maturity. You're still rather young, and you have plenty of time for that kind of stuff. No need to hurry. Enjoy yourself for now, and you'll be ready when you're ready.|`|SehwPt6faa	No its not weird. Its normal. You like to have fun being single and there is no law saying you have to be in a relationship.     All your doing is just waiting for the right guy to come around so you   can give him your heart. =D|`|KITQu2j7aa	its not weird stay single as long as you can. your to young to be in love|`|1VZy38vvaa	Absolutely not weird at all!  In fact, I wish that more people were like that, instead of being all "OMG I NEED A BF/GF DDDD: "|`|ygGr1nX7aa	That's not weird at all.  Especially at that age, it can seem like everyone's obsessed with getting with someone but the truth is, if you're happy to wait there's absolutely nothing wrong with that.  If anything, it's *more* healthy to be more focused on your own life.|`|ksEkWEd2aa	no I don't think that is weird. I think you are one of the smarter ones. You're only 16 you have a lot to look forward too. You should be studying on your school and whatever extra curricular activities you have. And it's so much easier to have friends that are both guys and girls at your age if you don't have boyfriend.|`|PjjEpWw4aa	NO......|`|gkeuj7JYaa	omg not at all ahah|`|9ph7o84Aaa	you will, give it 1 more year.|`|CcYpcSb1aa	its a societal thing.  if you are happy being single, youre strange. TV says so.    there is nothing wrong with looking for the right person. the only mistake is thinking you must have a partner to be a whole person.|`|VLgDxUJQaa	Hell no, thats how i feel to|`|21ZKRgsOaa	no it is ok but if your looking for a good time call me|`|Vr2wK7n4aa	Not weird at all, actually you are being pretty smart! Relationships are probably the most complicated challenge we can find in our lives because they take energy, time, smarts, dedication and the list goes on. They can also be pretty dangerous at your age since lack of maturity (I am not saying you are) can contribute to unwanted pregnancies, jealousy and even verbal abuse or violence.     If you think I am blowing things out of proportion, just read the news or hear stories from your friends.    You need to be friends first, get to know your potential partner VERY WELL (check out how they react under stressful situations, not just the easy or happy ones) and then, after you feel more secure or at home decide if you want things to get a bit more serious.|`|BjtqWNt8aa	Nope...you're not weird at all.     However, If you are a 16 year old guy that doesn't really know if he wants a boyfriend...then you have a different problem...cause guys are not supposed to want a boyfriend...you know?|`|TpDwPF9paa	NO PERFECTLY OK  IM 16 TO AND FELL THE SAME|`|WdrlFTmYaa	no it's not weird at all.sometimes you just need to be single for a little while.|`|8ee4GOb9aa	it just means you arent ready yet. you dont want a bf but would rather make more friends first
T6nmD3X9aa	whats akward? Sounds like you want a guy that is still hung up on his ex. Give him time, be his freind, that is what he needs til he figures out if they are really over or not.     Good luck to you|`|U5bFIEbWaa	you said everything just right. :] dont worry.|`|DHJkOpMgaa	Okayy...What about it??|`|7BRJhrABaa	no, he's just sad about the whole situation with his ex. cause you know when you talk about someone that you broke up with and still love them you get sad because you dont have her anymore.. so he's jsut sad .. so dont feel bad lol|`|cUyxNNDGaa	i think you answered just fine. You should say what ever you feel|`|A7ovwP94aa	Too much of a question. Why dont you summarise the salient points.|`|PtqlQ5Anaa	no you didnt say anything that shouldnt have been said.|`|Tc1BO5kkaa	is it possible that YOU like him??|`|Pe7pXCbwaa	How did this conversation start? that could be the start of a awkward conversatin.....well its only awkward if u liked him too. u dont right....doesnt look like it....well he loved her, and then it ended must be hard for him, just try to comfort him and make him feel like he has a life with good friends and everything! good luck!!|`|KpQBsXbRaa	its a pretty touchy subject, you might want to wait a while to talk more about it...|`|wBCvaounaa	well it's obvious he still likes the girl so if you are concered about being a good friend dont put the girl down like everyone else was. (if he was like yeah thats what everyone says then he probably dont want to hear it anymore cause he still liked her regardless) Know what I mean? Just be a good friend and tell him what he wants to hear. lol Hope it helps!|`|es9EgQIiaa	WELL I THINK YOU JUST SPOKE OPEN TO HIM AND MOST PROBABLE WITH HIM STILL HAVING FEELINGS STILL HE GOT EMOTIONAL AT THE END OF THE CONVERSATION AND STARTED TO THINK OF HER AGAIN AND GOT UPSET  DON'T THINK YOU DONE ANYTHING WRONG JUST BE THERE FOR HIM IF HE NEEDS YOU    GOOD LUCK I THINK YOU HAVE TAKEN A LIKEN TO HIM|`|0FUEBVtJaa	Hi ,  this may be good for your question:  http://tiny.cc/advice735   . they got a bunch of people answering  these types of questions there.
IooDY9Xnaa	I'm a 24 year old guy who completely gets where you're coming from. I was, and still am like you at times!    You need to discover your strengths and work on making them a more prominent part of your visible personality. Realise that people can only see what you want them to see, and that they do not have telepathic abilities.    People train their muscles to get good at a sport/look good/whatever. At first they may be shockingly bad but as time goes on they get better and better. You need to keep this in mind. The brain is just like any other part of the body. If you keep training your bicep with the same weight it will not grow; likewise if you keep "feeling inferior" you will appear inferior and people will think that you actually are inferior.    The average human has 12,000 thoughts per day (I have way more!!). Over 85% of them are exactly the same as the day before. If you want to change you need to think differently and behave differently even if you feel inferior. The more you get out there and act "superior", the more you will actually feel superior!     I hope you understand what I mean - good luck.|`|cbp7Gukbaa	Its more common than you think.I used to be like that but it was caused by depression i hated myself and didnt feel comfortable around people.I know plenty people like that no need to worry your not a freak.If people think your a freak because your shy,it takes a freak to call sombody a freak remember that|`|FZCKqZkpaa	Of course there are! I am a bit like you...I am shy in some ways and feel inferior in front of certain people. I am only 16, but not everyone can be really outgoing and loud. When you are talking to people, try to take your mind off your shyness and try and contribute to the conversation and before you know it...you wont feel shy anymore, you will really begin to come out your shell. Trust me...it does work! The more you talk confidently with people, the more you feel less conscious about it and then after a while, you simply will be a whole new person. Just don't feel silly or embarrassed as it will show. But just remember your not alone...and you are who you are :) x|`|IN1wPKwoaa	i do feel the same as you but i am 15 yrs.|`|eH2zEXVAaa	Don't take others opinions about you so seriously, and your no longer inferior. Everyone makes mistakes. Nobody is better than anybody else. I am like you ^_^ but that's how I think when I get those feelings.|`|pXYqAreqaa	it will come with age  don't  worry|`|7wixocuDaa	keep your head up.. always think that i am UNIQUE.. i am SPECIAL .. i have my own abilities... boost your confidence .. ;)|`|3L4fPlpmaa	i don't like talking in front of others much, either.  maybe you care what other ppl think too much and are afraid if you say something wrong, people will do something to you.|`|Zn8q98SBaa	its a self esteem/confidence issue, i personally google quotes, there very usefull when u feel down and they cheer me up :3|`|z02Tp44paa	ok whoa, don't overreact, of coarse you're "human". I'm shy too and i often feel the same way. almost anyone i meet for the first time seems intimidating to me, but you just have to suck it up and talk to them and stuff. But really, there's nothing wrong with being shy. Just make sure you make friends with people who are similar to you and with whom you can be yourself around. You just need some confidence and a few people in your life that you can trust. Btw i'm 17, so we're pretty close in age..sort of lol :) Just don't worry too much, but i completely get what you mean.
9580a1e44dd3d2bae7d2f867611ab353aa	? I would break it off, he would no longer be my fiance. He isn't ready for marriage if he is leaving over a disagreement and then sleeping with other women. He is to immature for marriage and has no respect.|`|53aUYsqtaa	dump him|`|jj2tSASnaa	are you really asking that?  curb city baby|`|UqWHXO16aa	OPEN SPELL CHECK.  then after you do that re-ask your question and then people can help you.|`|O3ArS1Poaa	Of course you would still love him... But I wouldn't get back with him.  Because when he told you he needed time to think, what he was really saying was he needed time to go F**K someone else.  Definitely a no-brainer!|`|5AUgjdtraa	of course i would still have feelings for him but i couldnt take him back cuz he cheated on you once with 2 women he might jus keep on doin it if you keep on takin him back and when they be like im sorry i wont do it again dont believe and dont except the apology if u do be like u have to earn mii trust by showing mii ur sory but other than that i wouldnt take him back

GdaQtybRaa	I am 14 and in 8th grade. I like girls with a good personality and are somewhat pretty, or at least nice looking. You could try changing your personality to something more suited to the guy you are trying to get (say if he is a nerd, be somewhat smart around him). Boys tend to stay away from girls who are afraid of having boyfriends. Just be cool and keep yourself pretty and you will see guys starting to notice you!|`|hIurSh3Daa	Their johnsons!!!!!    :o)|`|LViLdW6haa	do they spit or swallow!
4ebfc96012aef4fc15dc59c42ecac5a7aa	You can't help who you like!  That is a fact of nature.  However, as long as you don't act on your desires for this guy, then there is not a problem.  We all like people at some stage in our lives that are already spoken for, it is just the way life is.  You are all still young, perhaps this guy will become single again some day?  Until then, keep him as a friend, that is fine.    :)|`|jOkX0gqOaa	Oh u gta mve on..der r other fine lovely guys out der so y nt strt lookin 4 dem? i kno its gna b difficult getin ova da guy but do u rlly wana risk loosing such a gd friend? i rlly hope u find sum1 gr8 cz u diserv sum1 good that will tke gr8 cre of u n love u alwz :) so strt lookin 4 da guy!! x  n imagine hw da girl wud feel if u kpt flirtin n playin round wiv her bf spexially if she finds out u fncy him! she wud h8 u plus u wud jus cause trouble lol.. so rlly the best fing u can do! is find sum1 else x    Good luck huni..hpe everyfin wrks out fine :) mwuah * * *|`|TMi1GhSHaa	wouldnt you be 17 and 18 in year 12.. anyways.. so you like a guy whos taken.. soo he isnt married to the girl.. BUT you do need to respect that he has a girl and to keep your distance and not come on to him in that way.. cause he has a girl and no one likes to be the girl whos boyfriend cheated on her.. or to be the other girl.. so just leave it alone and find another guy.. who you can actually be with. Its more better that way and everyone will end up happy in the end.|`|LykjWv6faa	Yes, it's bad to like a guy who already has a girlfriend. I mean, how would you feel if another girl had her eyes set on your guy? I certainly wouldn't be happy. Leave him alone and find someone that's single.|`|rbcb5S1Kaa	its normal|`|3y0w1qIBaa	I have been in the same situation.  What I did, I respect the girl's relationship for now on and just keep hanging around with her (without sexual contact of course).  Then, I would try and get to know the boyfriend a little bit better.  Once that is all resolved, then I need to move on and find another girl who can make me happy.  After all, letting go of someone that you truly love is one of the hardest phase in our lives.|`|ZzEAc5ecaa	yes .. and it hurts .. so find a guy you can have . good luck ,|`|n8nGuu70aa	its fine if u like him its just a crush, just dont do anything that will cause drama. wait until they break up and then go for it, keep being friends with him until then.|`|7U9UAtTSaa	There isnt a lot you can do|`|Bu2asnXFaa	It's normal.  You can't control who you like.  But you can contol whether or not you act on it.  Just remember he's taken and try not to think of him in anything other than friendly way.|`|60b0d42c3c92dec6d976704c90ee8eb5aa	Don`t pine after someone who is taken.  He wants her, not you.  Don`t be a sad hanger-oner.  Move on and find someone for yourself. Where`s your pride?|`|aNdXegnjaa	Yes it is bad & its people like that that ruin other peoples relationships!    just step away from him for a while.    still be friends but leave him alone.    either your gonna get heartbroken or his girlfriend will.    so just leave it before it gets into deeper feelings.|`|5fdgfNCRaa	Don't feel bad about it. I'm sure he's a nice guy and something attracted his girlfriend and it could attract you too.   I've been in this situation and it's better to let it go... but I've also been on the other side (being the girlfriend whose man is liked by another girl) and the situation was much more complicated because of other incidents etc. but to hear that you wouldn't do anythng about it makes me personally happy. I'm glad that there are people that still respect relationships.   Just don't feel bad about liking him. That's completely natural.|`|vkI84yPCaa	well, it happened to me, so i just let her go...|`|LUC2GDxTaa	This is typical - the nice guys are always taken. Just stick it out, the relationship will probably end eventually: teenage relationships tend not to last long. As I say to others, stay friends and be patient.|`|wQeCtj0uaa	it happens alot|`|9ZkzBiHxaa	if your friends have noticed, chances are that he has noticed as well. you might has well tell him, you never know if he may have the same feelings!|`|B3VYy8sFaa	You can't help who you like. As long as you don't act on your feelings, then you're not wrong.    However, you just need to make sure you're ok with hanging out with him knowing he's with someone else. If you are, then don't worry... you will eventually find someone new!|`|mR0gkR5caa	it's not bad, everyone has done it at some point. Just have fun being his friend, and if word gets to him tell him the truth and tell him you dont want to act on it since he has a girlfriend, and make sure his girlfriend knows that too.|`|oOfD9HFBaa	i was in the same situation.    i couldnt stand it, so now i just try to stay away from him and not talk to him and not think about him as much as possible. it sucks, but its the only thing that seems to work for the situation|`|Ovgp8QxJaa	It's not your fault that you like him. I know that I would be jealous if some girl liked my boyfriend though...Best thing too do is to just wait it out. Sometimes these things just wont work out, and as soon as she's out of the picture, make your move. Untill then, move on. Find another guy.|`|9580a1e44dd3d2bae7d2f867611ab353aa	? Just remain friends, don't pursue anything further as long as he has a girlfriend.|`|skiPYyGDaa	it happens and its happend to me the best thing you can do is wait or show the person you like that you like him flirt but not when the girlfriend is around good luck|`|LWPV1OYAaa	been there done that|`|fe8aa5495caab3873690c07d37e65268aa	You should do nothing.  It is tough when you like someone who doesn't like you in the same way.  You have to turn your way of thinking around.  It is okay to like certain characteristics about him.  It shows you more of what you want in a guy.  He is a good friend and don't think of him in any other way.  Get out and volunteer.  Meet other people.      If you are hanging out with him hoping one day he will like you in the same way, then you need to stop hanging out with him.  If you hang out with him because he is a nice guy, then it is okay as long as you keep your word that you would never do anything.  Always think about yourself being in a different situation, like his girlfriend.  What would you do if you were her and she found out?    It is normal to like someone, even when they are attached, but it is not healthy to act on it.|`|VhwI7d6uaa	tuff brake.|`|At8D5Xu2aa	You can't help how you feel.  You're not acting on it and you're trying to be as normal as possible.  Two things I would suggest to you:    1.  Is he deliberately, or inadvertently, doing anything that would keep your torch alive?  If so, you might want to avoid that kind of thing.    2.  Are you doing anything that keeps your feelings alive?  No need to put yourself through needless suffering.  My guess is that you're not seeing anyone right now, because that's the way you nourish romantic fantasies (whether you want to or not).  My real suggestion is to get yourself a boyfriend--your feelings for the other guy will soon leave you as you are more drawn in to actualities rather than fantasies.|`|m8C8MU2Maa	No it's not bad to like someone who has a wife, girlfriend, or whatever.  I'm guessing you respect the person for who he is not just like the way his pants hang down over his butt.  It's alright to like him but would be wrong to flirt with him.  I admire and respect lots of women but I don't communicate with them in a way that would embarrass or show disrespect for my wife.  Good friends are very important.|`|sIhPpdv3aa	it's not bad that you like him, it's only wrong if you do something about it when he is in a relationship with someone else.     Depending on how much you like him, you may want to back off from hanging out with him if you feel like you are going to be obvious! Try to think about other guys who are not taken. Try to find another crush to distract you from the forbidden fruit!    think about this: if you accidentally flirt with him and he leaves his girlfriend for you, what kind of person does that make him? A guy who isn't committed and who is dating but still looking around? You'd lose respect for him if it went down that way. Be patient. If he and his girlfriend are not meant to be, they will break up without help from anyone else. Just steer clear.|`|74008e5e3a8a4192f40444bc93d2b1c2aa	You can't help who you like but you can control what you do about it. This guy is taken so that means he is off limits. Stay friends with him but you may want to start distancing yourself from him, as much as you don't want to. If and when they break up then you can swoop in and make your move. But not until then. Good Luck.|`|DTh1rgoqaa	It's not bad, happens a lot. Just be his friend and try to become his girlfriends friend too, so that she doesn't get jelous if it's a tad obvious that you like him.|`|tyRxu67daa	I was in the same situation, but eventually my friend and her boyfriend broke up.  Now she and I are dating|`|GwA7m9Fdaa	I might be in this situation  maybe...idk  The guy I like is one grade higher than me and I'm not sure if he has a girlfriend.But for you,I'd say just be his friend and if he really likes you he will dump his girlfriend|`|pzdd90VZaa	Many times, yes.    It's a really horrible feeling to see some one you like so much holding hands and kissing with another..But, it doesn't mean you should advance him. Just imagine how you would feel if another girl was hitting on your boyfriend and tried to get him to break up with you.    Stay low and keep hanging out with him as FRIENDS.  You really don't want to ruin his relationship to get him to be with you..it never works unless he ends it on his OWN account    (: Goodluck Love|`|T4zxS0hIaa	find someone else!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|OBVtGhVSaa	No, it's not bad. You can't help it! The best thing to do is exactly what you're doing now, stay good friends with him, but don't ruin that friendship by telling him how you feel while he has a girlfriend. If he does break up with him, give it some time before saying anything :)  Hope that helps  Could you perhaps help me with my question? thanks soooo much:  http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...|`|5uicne7Laa	well dnt worry about it ive been it so many times its sad at times but when you get over it you and him are great freinds and i tink it should stay dat way for a while until he asks you himself|`|AA11611493	It's not a bad thing that you like him...just keep it that way...Look but dont touch or provoke or say inappropriate things to get him to look at you....like that....     Be yourself---you're both young so you never know what could happen. But for the meantime, I would try to look for someone else|`|rkV9q3juaa	That's horrible. Shame on you, how could you like that person. Your hearth is bad. How can you. You should start loving your mom and dad again like you used too. Before you do that you should feel bad for a month and apologize to them personally or with a note !!|`|dJuhUAF5aa	Of course I've been in situations like that. Sometimes the guy fooled me though and I didn't know he had a girlfriend till afterward. But when I was like 14, I liked this guy but he had a girlfriend. They broke up, thats when I told him I liked him. But I never really acted upon my feelings with a guy that had a girlfriend, I always waited. My junior year I started to like a guy who would flirt with me, but he kinda still liked another girl, we eventually started dating after he stopped having those feelings and we're still together two years later. Anyway, its really not a bad thing that you like him. And since your not gonna do anything about it, which is good then you can stay friends. Eventually you'll stop liking him or they will break up and you will have your chance, you never know what could happen. Just please don't make him cheat on his girlfriend lol.|`|twortDpyaa	it's not your fault you have feelings for a guy who has a girlfriend.  i mean odds are their not gonna gat married, dating's just for fun and practice. so yeah, you could still have a chance with him. but make sure you dont get to friendly with his girlfriend, if they ever break up you'll have to break the "never date your freinds ex" rule. so just stay freinds with him. be there for him. make him happy. but don't make any moves on him. . .|`|fIeLH6HPaa	We don't have control over who we like, only what we do about it. I suggest that you tell him how you feel. Let him know that you don't want to cause him and his girlfriend any trouble,but you needed to tell him how you feel. It could help you to ge it out in the open, if he doesn't feel the same way he will at least be more careful as to how he acts around yous as not to lead you on in any way.|`|8e4LyCguaa	that happen to me to but the difference that he tell me that he love me than he told me that the only person he love is his first lover and then he send to me her picture i hurt so much and discover that the best thing is to forget him
TMi1GhSHaa	ya they say everyone has a twin in this world, so its pretty possible that someone you know may resemble someone else.. it happens.. a few days ago i saw someone that looked EXACALLY like my ex boyfriend.. but it wasnt him.. it was soo wierd lol.. he looked at me like i was crazy cause i was staring at him so hard haha lol.. but ya at first i was wondering why he was dressing the way he was.. but then i realised it wasnt him lmao.. but ya it was still wierd lol.. couldnt help but look lol. I saw another person who looked exacally like my friend.. it was too wierd.. i was staring at her and was going to say hi but i realised it wasnt her.. i saw the tinge difference in features but for the most part they could pass as twins!! its crazy!|`|HH56ptnNaa	yeah there are people who have twins out there. I saw one today that looked exactly like someone I went to college with but it wasnt the same person.

AW1dCzH0aa	I live in Arkansas, so I bet prices are probably similar to Alabama.  Our wedding cake for 85 people is included in our wedding package, so I don't know how much that runs.  Our groom's cake is pretty complicated and it's $135 for 65 people.  Our fruit platter is $115, our veggie platter is $115, and the cheese platter is $150.  (These are all LARGE platters for about 65 folks each).  Then our food is $22-$26 per person for different food options (chicken dish, pot roast dish and salmon dish).  Those prices don't include taxes or the nearly 20% gratuity.|`|26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	It depends on where you are located since prices vary so much. Someone in a large city will obviously be paying more than someone in a small town in the Midwest.    To get a ballpark of what is considered reasonable in your area, your best bet is to check out the local boards at http://talk.theknot.com since the ladies there are very helpful.|`|agTCqkLDaa	It depends on the time of day.  Let's say it's ten dollars per plate per table-that's $3750 tax excluded.  Cakes can be anywhere from 50 to several thousand dollars.  So, let's say you have a brain and refuse to spend any more than 150 on a cake.  So 300 total.      Now on the cheaper spectrum, you're look at: $4,050 tax excluded.    Let's say the plates are $20 per person per table; that's $7500 and let's say you don't have a brain and decide to spend $400 dollars on both cakes-that's $8,300.    So, no alcohol, you're looking at anywhere from about $4,000 to $8,500.    This is assuming you are fairly reasonable and live in a place that is NOT New York, Boston, Atlanta, or San Francisco.    Just triple the price if you are in one of the above locations.|`|MkErhX7Haa	It really depends on where you live.  I ditto theknot.com.  They have local boards where you can get specific info on local vendors in your area.
MoULSx9Waa	Hey girl... Yeah, if you want a classic look... defently have table clothes that go with the Brides colors... and the center pieces can be anything you want...     From bowls of candy as the centerpieces... Candles... or even fish bowls with real fish swimming around... ( which is really cool )     If your wedding is going to go into the night... Try buying some of those old fashioned lanterns that hold wax candles in them... and hang'em from surrounding trees...    You could get christmas lights and hang them around each picnic table...  And if you choose to use white table clothes... you could have the lights behind the table clothes... so all you see is a glowing tables clothes...     Have balloons staked in the ground... all around the perimeter of the area...    I hope that gave you a few ideas to run with...     God Bless... and have fun! :D|`|A7miTF4taa	i had an outdoor wedding with picnic tables. we had table cloths on them with center pieces made of a simple arrangement of flowers. also, we had a drink table with a huge punch bowl with decorative ice. the decorative ice to put in the punch is easy. fill bunt pan with water and put any kind of fake flowers or decoration through it. pop it in the freezer and there ya go.    congrats on your big day!|`|47af2fda89839c0ec02e273cff59d82daa	you can do whatever you want.  just because it is outdoors, doesnt mean it isnt still a wedding.      so if you find some cute centerpieces that would look good on your picnic tables, then rock the hell out of it! its your day.  maybe you could do something like arrange flowers in picnic  baskets or do something with old mason jars and rocks and candles?  (sorry if that wasnt very descriptive, all this stuff looks awsome in my head)       but yeah, the jist of this is, its your wedding, and regardless of where it is, its your day so you can decorate how ever you want, so have fun with it!!|`|6fLxNyVpaa	i had table clothes and just flowers i actually only did table decorations, but i did have a bridge and put tool on it and bows. but other then the flowers and candles in jars to match the table clothes i did nothing esle.
NUWdgQuraa	There's a school of thought that people who have their act together subscribe to.  That is, "Chaos attracts chaos."  Guys getting fatally shot and drug use is chaotic behavior, and you're in the middle of it.    You need to remove yourself from the negative influences.  It's a lonely road, but you're lonely already.  Perhaps a support group like Al-Anon would help.    At least it's a productive road.  If you surround yourself with good, law-abiding, sober people, you'll feel better as time goes on.  Life will be better, and simpler too.
WixVIsFtaa	he seems selfish..and like a player...dont go for him....find yourself someone who will truly love you.|`|3y0w1qIBaa	Don't go out with him because it seems that he is a player.
ySnDQpXJaa	love is when you don't care if your kissing the person or just sitting close by your just happy to know that they're always there for you. the difference between love and a crush is that love is more profound, you know more about the person and you love them more for their personality than their looks. you found someone special when you feel that your life is just going through the motions when your not with the other person, but when you get together everything clicks and you would never trade that time for anything. your feelings are different when you can't get that person out of your head, every little thing reminds you of them, and you constantly find yourself not being able to be productive in anything you do because your waiting to talk to or be with that person that you love. how's that?|`|vUypopU8aa	love is the feeling you get when you want to be around someone constantly and never let them go, and want to know everything about them. thats how you know your not in love^  oh you will just know, without thinking.   the feelings of the other person?   well they avoid you more  that ones hard to answer
XI9e7OyEaa	Just calm down and let yourself relax. Its the answer your scared of not the asking. Just relax ands think rejection isn't the end of the world. Just do it!! Good Luck!|`|klSBvPRRaa	go for it, it the only way to find out if they like you or not;);)  good luck x|`|nQuhBChNaa	Be smooth. Just ask if  she wants to go out sometime in a caual convosation! Good luck|`|06f1b8496562ceae60b7c13272bc0615aa	You can decide if you want to live your life scared or go after what you want. If a girl says no to you it doesnt mean anything is wrong with you, it just means she prefers someone different than you. It is not a personal rejection. Some girls are mean about it but that just shows they arent worth being with anyway.  You have to change how you see things to gain courage to ask a girl out. A girl will respond better to a guy who shows confidence. If you can set aside your personal feelings for that moment and realize everyone has their own preferences in what they want in a mate then when she does say no, just think ok she likes taller guys, or guys with different hair color or whatever and thats cool. You can walk away then with dignity. The good part about having confidence is that she might actually say yes.|`|a6138e092d07f6d19d5c478c75935469aa	Take a big deep breath and go talk to who ever you want to ask out. Engage in conversation about anything then move the conversation around to a movie thats on at the movies at the moment and casually ask if they have seen it most likely they have not ( good tip pick a good movie but not the biggest box office smash of the moment as they are more likely to not of seen it) then casual as you like say something like "hey we should go see it then" make it sound half jokey judge their response if it looks promising ask what they doing on a certain night. Believe me if they say no then hey you was only asking them to a movie no biggy. If they say yes then you are home and dry lol. this has worked for me .   Good luck|`|QdXvBOL7aa	i wouldn't worry. i was making out with the guy when he asked me out. perfect timing because i couldn't reject him.|`|dfMDTTUAaa	never let being scared get in the way of telling them you like them.   it's like the best compliment you can get. Just keep it casual if your nervous and try something like hey do you wanna see a movie at the weekend/ grab a coffee with me later? good luck!|`|qwVruoJ8aa	grow up there is nothing to be scared he or she don't bite worst thing is they can say no|`|qy0j3b3haa	msn  letter  ask some one  talk to her  call her
ab11c77db248f05b2e7090761918cc61aa	I think you should reach out on a friend level to her.  My guess is you miss her in more ways than one...Certainly as a lover, but my guess would be you miss her friendship even more.  Sometimes it really helps to just put it out there...to tell her that you know things have been weird since you fooled around or whatever but that you truly miss her friendship and that you hope to become close again.  I think once you mention the fooling around thing to her, the elephant in the room, so to speak, will be named.  You're not bad...it's okay...things happen...IDK if she did something to push you away or not, but I think you should try to reach out to her, mention you know it's weird or whatever, and tell her how much you miss her friendship.  I would NOT get into why you think she married that guy...don't mention that stuff...just try to be her friend if she will let you in.  Good luck!  Good friends are really hard to find and even harder to keep...once you find someone you click with, it's my opinion that you should do everything you can to maintain that relationship...      ps...How did it go giving notice???|`|qoh1iNi9aa	Honey,this girl was a big part of your life at the time.You are not suddenly going to be able to cut her out of your thoughts. You say you don't speak and yet you are worried about her. Could you not make contact again, to find out if she is OK and possibly set your mind at rest? I don't know about your sexuality, and I don't need to, but I hope this helps a bit.|`|rZhUcLFmaa	Well, there's no way you'll be able to have her.    You have to move on. Maybe find a rebound person.    Try not to think about her.
sbCvAy11aa	confident but no a show off. not hot but not ugly. sincere but not weird.  play with my hand when you hold it. hug me like it will be the last time everytime. tell me im beautiful and make me beleive it. make me go in the rain just so you could kiss me. every girl wants to be kissed in the pouring rain   that guy would be perfect|`|Ibj8FjfRaa	His eyes and his body.|`|aa2192e380dd80fb8bd56e7c9de2e77eaa	A sense of humor...& is willing to listen to some advice/instructions in the bedroom without taking offence|`|yOWhoQBMaa	He can make me laugh.   That is the star thing for me.
TMi1GhSHaa	she definitly is intrested in you.. and im guessing it worked cause your questioning her now lol .. "shes on your mind"..|`|AA11441704	probably|`|F9Wqp5YMaa	i think it is friendly and nothing more. she probably needs male advice about her problems and she needed to talk to someone whom she can trust. i am like that too. it is not flirting.|`|hhduYRfdaa	If she was interested in you, she wouldn't have brought up the ex-bf.
4agFELNzaa	She's got to be a little interested to open up to a person she barely knows. You should talk to her, but move at her pace, after all she just went through a break up.|`|H0HPx0kwaa	She might be interested. Sounds like she's waiting for you to make the move though|`|LykjWv6faa	Either she's interested or just looking for a person to vent to.|`|9Ni21lHpaa	I think she was going through a rough time,and that she just wanted someone to talk to,to vent her feelings.Not necessary that she's interested in having you as a boyfriend,maybe just a friend.
0fhCbS7Daa	she probably just takes you as a friend and just wanted to talk to some one about her break up.
T0i2iB22aa	I think it's very weird that you spent the day with your girlfriends little sister.  It is also weird that you are saying shes cute. With her asking you about guys she is probably looking to you for advice.|`|GfvxVeZMaa	No that's really cute. It means she likes you, be happy, some siblings can hate their sisters/brothers bf/gf.|`|AA10348091	no you probably were just missing your girlfriend and talking about relationships made you think more plus little girls always ask their sisters boyfriends that kinds of things because they think that your there for them since your with their sister now|`|wUbvU3aiaa	Well your girlfriend is not going to be so happy.
cP9MoCc6aa	my thoughts, you might be overreacting just a bit.  from what you said it just seems like he really means that you may be good friends. Nothing really big. And if he doesn't speak much english, then thats good, then you can help him while getting to know him.    but if it's what you are thinking, then nevermind, and you probably should stay away. but from what i know from what you said, it seems he didn't mean anything but what he said. he may seriously think you might make good friends from personality or something. nothing big.     dont worry ^-^|`|GfCRiueRaa	Why would you think that? He probably means exactly what he said. If the two of you are good friends and he's also good friends with "Patrick", then wouldn't it make sense for him to think that you two would also get along?
qAd0QmZEaa	yeah all the time|`|65DCQ4bNaa	Yes :D    my own|`|P3GgROxtaa	yeah lol|`|AA11048739	Yes its par for the course
RthQ3whkaa	Maybe he's trying to come up with his own little word/slang. Obviously he's horny and is begging for something sexual.|`|TMi1GhSHaa	probablly means he wants you to kiss him.. or air kiss him.. or lick your mouth lol.. in a sexy way or something.. who knows.. but any guy that says that to me would be a complete turn off.. thats not even proper english lol...|`|LykjWv6faa	He's having dirty thoughts about you.|`|jj2tSASnaa	that he is a moron.|`|W618lfZ6aa	Makes you look sexy I suppose|`|lIpjuMTHaa	That he wants you to use your tongue to mve slowly and sensualy around your mouth, girls do it in porn and some guys think its sexy.|`|zRtOplYtaa	u turn him on!|`|rUsK9Egcaa	He's Horny that time|`|c3QxWOUVaa	It probably turns him on. He likes it. But I'm not quite sure what it means?|`|ekRtrUnIaa	dirty thoughts!|`|XJW7Yx8faa	Lol he is a weirdo|`|sIhPpdv3aa	Yeah, that's him being a perv.    He means "lick your lips"
wJ1v0cX0aa	she is just catching up the years she has lost with her looser husband. Let her live her life and learn her lessons. The best you can do is be there to help her if it doesn't work out for her, but, pray that it does cause she seems happy, and sometimes, it's better to be happy than sad.|`|3NoQuoWuaa	Your friend is lucky to have someone like you to be concerned about her. Unfortunately, there isn't anything you can do except to be there for her when she needs shoulder to cry on. She will have to work through her own problems and right wrong or otherwise, come up with her own solutions. She is "growing up" again or if you prefer, trying to relive her teen age years.r|`|5xwPRvVOaa	No, you have reason to worry, but keep in mind you are a friend, not a keeper. Its her choice, and all you can do is give her advise. She's on the re bound from more than her ex, shes trying to live again. Whats her age, and yours, re post and I'll post more, if I can.|`|UYfsZAfraa	give her the choise but if i were u i would keep a close eye on her|`|AA11595860	The woman wasted most of her life living a lie. She's a grown woman now, and hopefully she'll find true love this time.  Sounds like she's been through a lot.     If you want to be a good friend, talk with her, make her feel good and be there to pick her up if she falls. Let her know your always there for her.    However, It's her life. As much as friends sometimes want to help, sometimes you need to stay out of it.  You may end up in the middle and lose your friend. Good luck!
L38M9lrLaa	I recently had the same problem i told her i think she could understand why i cant talk to her and if she cant then i dont need friends that play stupid.your judged by the company you keep and i didnt want to be viewed as a **** like she is|`|7ko9czaaaa	you said xx boyfriends right, tell her she can have all your left overs and maybe you should say xx best friend,,|`|Y4Ye3OLOaa	For someone who you consider a best friend she sure causes you a lot of agony, I'd end the friendship
IiDIzQuQaa	do you think she lied about quitting or that she tried to quit and then had a relapse but didn't tell you? it really depends on the situation. i'd say if she straight up lied than you should be careful, but if she just didn't tell you about a weak moment then she was probably just ashamed, and you shouldn't necessarily stop trusting her completely because of it. quitting smoking is really hard!|`|0HYG8PlNaa	It is better than chewing tobacco! It is very hard to quit smoking give her some time. She will soon
jr5EgB2Taa	I would like to give you a two part answer.  First, you did the right thing.  He needs to get his life together before he can make a life for the two of you.  You will never shake the "first love" aspect.  You cannot change that you were once very in love with this person.  You can, however, move on.  Consider writing a letter to him explaining how you felt, how you feel now, and then flush it down the toilet.  Any contact with this individual can make him think you still want to be with him, and I would hope this is not the case.    Second, you need to get a new start if you simply cannot just let him go.  It sucks to move to a new place and meet new people, but obliviously he is still very much a big part of your life.  I would highly recommend if moving is not an option to consider a restraining order.  It sounds very mean, but if he is threatening other people and not allowing you to date other people, this guy is BAD news...but you already know that.    About your dad... Counseling can help, but so will a realization that he is human, made bad decisions, and you are not defined by those decisions.  You may not be able to "help" who you are attracted to, but believe me when I say that along the road, you will find a really nice guy that can take care of you, wants to take care of you, and is tat free.  Also it will not hurt to attend church.  There is a lot of hope in those walls, and freedom you will not find on Yahoo answers.  Good luck, I will be praying for you.|`|0fQYHgr0aa	Bay--he is in a dangerous gang. do you want to be with someone years down the road and always have to worry if he is going to get shot/killed/end up in jail? You will live a lifetime of fear.   Would you really want to have kids with someone like this? Raise your kids in a situation like this?  Let him go. You really need to try and stay away from the places he hangs out at. He is trying to control you and that is not something you need.   I wish you the best of luck.|`|BBol9etoaa	I think you should stop going to the bars that you know he will be at.     He probably needs time to get over you and meet a new girl, but it's harder when you two keep bumping into each other.     Find a new place to party and you won't have to keep looking over your shoulder.  But, if your drawn towards guys like him anyway then maybe your feelings for him are still valid.
DcVoq5Tuaa	your life your choice. You should be happy with whatever decision you chose and if other's don't like it, that's just tough. It's not their life, it's yours.|`|qmXFCVMIaa	i have a illness too and it has kept me single b/c i don't want anyone getting it from me...but by doing so i have become putoffish and keep to myself, my Dr keeps asking me if i want to join a group of people like me close to my house but i am weirded out by this and decline the offers...
lc2WYfeTaa	I want his arms to be caressing me and showing me his affection holding me around the waist then coming up and holding my neck and touching my face, etc..I don't want just one thing I want it all to me that is a romantic kiss|`|dJkNofnoaa	i love when my guy wraps his arms around my lower back and pulls me in for a long romantic kiss |`|mE1HSVTsaa	I like a nice tender kiss with him having one hand on my face or head and the other around my back!!|`|GGfLLgkXaa	On my face, like cupping my cheeks.|`|kLslWQR8aa	If its that type of relationship then all over the place like my waist, face, shoulders etc.|`|0fVtHNtmaa	on my face and the back of my neck|`|hFgAr7vNaa	around my lower back or holds my waist|`|TstiC2Ilaa	I love when a guy wraps his arms around me tightly, and pulls me in to kiss me.|`|5cd52d24c5f7667ec458aba89c056f19aa	i like his hands along the sides of my face...it's sort of a way of telling me "i don't ever want to stop kissing you"|`|fMxVDps3aa	One hand wrapped in my hair holding my head close. The other wherever he wants it.|`|2c88J3M7aa	One hand in my hair, the other on my back =P    orrr maybe both on my back moving up and down ?   i like the first one better though =)  I dont like it when the guy touches my face cause it makes my skin feel oily ! :(|`|rPT4J5YLaa	I want his arms to be totally wrapped around me holding me close as possible so I feel enveloped by him.|`|C44Ux50paa	i like one hand on my hipbone and the other on my ***|`|H0HPx0kwaa	Around your waist or on your butt.|`|YfJHliLWaa	I would like his arms to be either on my waist or on the side of my face.|`|K1XM6rpwaa	around the waist, definitely    it hopes the girl feel supported, safe, and loved and let's her know that you want to protect her, always.  plus, if you had your arms around her it would be somewhat restricting her from being passionate in HER side of the kiss|`|SWekdgrhaa	I love it when my guy wraps his arms around my lower back/waist pulling me close to him and reaches one hand up towards my head to run his fingers through my hair.|`|Ngc0teBqaa	All girls are different, but here are some of the most common places that girls like guys' hands while they kiss:    - on the back of her head.  - on her cheeks. (The cheeks on her FACE, that is.)  - in her hands.    If you've been together a long time, and you both believe you're meant to be together, then I'm sure she won't mind WHERE you put your hands - as long as you kiss her.|`|YQnvJYR8aa	a tight passionate loving hug,where she feels warm and you guys are so close you dont wanna let go.thats the best,hold on as long as youwant and put your hands anywhere.|`|AA11298074	doesn't really matter, as long as his arms are around me somewhere lolz|`|838VJJGvaa	Around my waist.
AU4LAtqMaa	depending on the person!  i dont care where they live or how much money they have.  i only cccare about the person!|`|1wQgeBwSaa	Where a man lived wouldn't matter to me, what is important is respect and feelings.  Anyone who evaluates someone for living in a trailer is not worth the time of day.  A person certainly doesn't not have to live in a trailer to be trash.  Shame on people who think like that.|`|pUoAqU3Vaa	well, idk cuz I live in a large city and we really don't have lots of people who live in mobile homes and I've never met one so I really just don't know the type|`|ALDXW0Jeaa	i live in a mobile home and i am far from trash. so yes!|`|Bu2asnXFaa	If I click with someone I don't care where they live...that's what moving companies are for.|`|dlmVTt18aa	When you really love someone you look past all the material things.|`|ebac2c8416ceff0f61cd9f8cf423826faa	yea, it's what's on the inside that counts.     but that seems a little fishy to me...a stable job and a mobile home?     is it purely by choice or is it for a different reason|`|Tcm3MCM3aa	Its fine. I think girls that think guys who live in a trailer/mobile home are white trash are way to picky. If you have a clean house, nice job, and you are stable it shouldnt matter. Especially if you have an awsome personality and you are kind
8iXM26HTaa	pretty much anything at the teen years turning a guy on can be easier than turning on a light, you touching them especially down there is great whispering in his ear nudity is always good and letting him touch you is probably the best thing|`|EDXh0tk9aa	Almost everything
xtieIDTyaa	Be yourself, Never try to act like someone you aren't because if you put on a false personality to attract guys are they really attracted to the real you?|`|WAEDIWz8aa	i think a cute nice smile :) and a bit of blushing goin on as well. lol|`|sRKO8s6jaa	A nice personality. Like be funny, smile and always say hi to him when you see him.|`|Y8UICH0Daa	ah the age old question, when you find the answer, sell it you will make a million.    its different for every guy, just like different things in different guys attract you to them.|`|b0c58cc0b655a543b52a5ab7c8f62835aa	Well to get someone descent it takes more of just a smile to get them, although sometimes to attract a guy you don't have to do anything to attract them as all you would have to do is walk by them and the next thing you know they would be checking out your figure and might be asking for you email address and number already.

How old are you? If you are under age twenty and havent been dating a year yet the chances are slim.|`|qBvHdZf2aa	well any1 can make themselves sound like theyre inlove with u....u have to b smart enough to b able to kno the real signs of love...love is something that u feel ...u jus kno when its real, intuition i guess...if u kno he'd do anything for u n he shows it (also cares for u, shows u love by expressing it, doing right by u by giving u respect n helping u with w/e)..then he may love u..if u dont think ud do the same for him then ur not inlove..u cant force urself to love sum1 either|`|UnuRaYbjaa	It could be true love! Congratulations! A normal teen boyfriend might love you, then break it off. It depends how long you have been dating or how long you have liked each other. One night on a date, if you have been going out for 3 months, tell him you love him. If he loves you back, he will say " I love you too". This could be a sign of true love. But true love may or may not last forever. True love in teens come and go, same with adults. But if he does everything to make you happy, he probably loves you. Hope this helps a little!
tLr2mADkaa	Every time you start doing something it tends to hurt, it's like going to the gym. Your mistake was not using any lubrication, a water base lubricant is normally recommended. Reason why it hurt until you used the bathroom, I wouldn't know cause I don't know what pain you had. What I will recommend is that you clean the area well since you didn't use lubricant to avoid any infections.    Pro's:  He probably liked it.  If done properly to a women to multi-pleasure you from different areas at once it can be a major orgasmic rollercoaster ride for you.    Con's:  No lubricant it probably hurt as hell  You can hurt yourself if you are not careful    Gas comes from what you eat, I think everyone has gas. but if you mean that you passed gas while doing it or afterwards it is because the anal region was relaxed and the muscles didn't hold you back.  Avoid Gassy foods and you might want to make hit the bathroom and evacuate first before doing it anally as some people can't hold in their bowels afterwards.|`|COmp4sIuaa	Are you a guy? Haha, this is hilarious. Idk, I've never had anal sex. Ask a chick.|`|PzAyT7Vwaa	Save the prison sex for prison. Thanks for the 2 points.|`|ZGidIKBcaa	If it was ur first time of course it's going to hurt|`|scnW0Wzeaa	???|`|Rn9N7E0uaa	You should definitely use lube next time, and maybe try an enema before your next session.|`|XAw4cJmjaa	Of course anal-sex is gonna hurt! You are stretching a muscle that is not intended to be stretched!  Your body always has gas, but when you have stretched your anal muscle, it can not contract enough to keep the gas from coming out.. So, that's why gas is more likely to come out instead of staying in your body.|`|B8Exjv8gaa	yo dawg, no one cares if yo butthole hurt.|`|pzdd90VZaa	You should always use a lubricant to ease the pain and discomfort..and go slow as hell first. If you're getting too much of intense pain from it, and your USING lubricant, I would advise to stop for awhile and check yourself out. It could be an underlying problem. : )    The gas might be from air that's forced inside you as he penetrates it, I wouldn't worry about it too much. It's completely normal!    Goodluck Love :)|`|S9p8E8hBaa	Okay, seriously. You need mental help. You need to work on your grammar and your speech before worrying about having sex. Keep letting him put it in you butt, that way it will lessen your chances of making a stupid baby. Stupid people should not reproduce.
VcIg1R1zaa	yeah but after 9 months he fell in love with me.so i supposed i wait but i was lucky.don't wait.it hurts soo much!move on.try to forget her
YWdNTZU3aa	you seem interesting to say the least  i'm sure i would give you a try  you seem a tad bit negative but a day with wes would change that  but i'm sure they have guys where you are at that want to get with you|`|zOIgzIy4aa	if i were 16 i would date you but you would have to work on that personality. it looks like your mad about something. so your not romantic, i would teach you how to be. and that ring in your lip would have to go.|`|JiUwpYSXaa	u look all right, but i don't like girl's with lips pierced|`|KrMPaCNGaa	of course :D  but I think you need to use less eyeliner. The cat eyes cute but make it less "winged"  but anyways... yes everyone finds somebody at some point|`|upazUCA6aa	Sure they would Sweetheart :)  you have a  pretty Face  and a very Beautiful Personality|`|KHic5rAaaa	Of course!  Looks only get you so far, trust me.  You always need the brains and personality to back it up!      For example, my boyfriend thinks Kendra Wilkinson from the Girl's Next Door is hot, yet he would NEVER want to be with her.  He thinks she's an easy, bimbo blond, who, in his words, is not "wife material."  I'm never jealous if he thinks a different girl is attractive because I'm confident in myself and I know I'm the whole package.      He even tells me yes, I'm physically attractive but why he loves me is because I'm smart, ambitious, and confident.  All the girls he's ever dated were pretty, yet they were more into partying and didn't have the greatest self-respect.  My boyfriend had his wild ways in the past too.  However, a guy always wants a girl who is hard to get, has confidence, and high self-esteem.  They won't respect a girl who is ditzy or easy.  Yeah, they may be attracted to her and perhaps date her for awhile, but that's it!  No love there!    Looks are fleeting and will only keep a guy for a little while.  My looks definitely helped me snag a few dates and possibly even initially drew the attention of my boyfriend.  I'm thin, not too short but not too tall and I'm a blond.  But the reason why my boyfriend loves me is because I worked hard at school (graduated a semester early from college with a BA in English) and I'm currently working on getting my Master's.  He loves me because I'm smart and I have a backbone.      Bottom line:  A guy wants a girl who he can respect!    P.S:  You're pretty!!  And who cares if you're currently not dating now.  I never really dated in high school.  Yeah, I would hang out with guys and sometimes we would kiss but it would never progress any further.  However, once I got to college, I met my current boyfriend and that's when things started to get serious.  Oh and by the way, stay a virgin as long as possible!  Don't give it up easily... be the unattainable girl!
bQ2RWRGNaa	be yourself and be strong i suppose. tell yourself you can, and just do it. as for life, live each moment as you go.!!|`|4f004cd7d53b313f28d767537dc82bf2aa	If you're really finding it difficult it might be worth considering hypnotherapy/emotional freedom therapy..both very effective and, you should come away with some additional skills under your belt|`|IiLCTmQdaa	just be yourself|`|AA12285253	imagine you were to die tomorrow ( aka its a wonder full life )  would you be happy with what you've achieved in life ? after all you only regret the chances you didn't take in life not the ones you did take ,
77a2f6fcf0f3ecdeff8a610bde50ab9daa	Tell her to tell the girl in question to come & tell you herself. Then do whatever you feel is right.|`|gijsRMOsaa	if u think she is pretty and u want 2 hang out wit her more jus tell her dat u want 2 start talkin 2 her as well.|`|S3xXaBbfaa	Most of the time, you should just shrug it off as a blatant lie because 90% of the time girls do this, they are doing it for a laugh, but you can see the girl who they are saying likes you, and she is all fidgety, blushing, and trying not to look in your direction, it could be that she actually likes you.    Judge it on how serious the girls look and sound.|`|O441z71Yaa	well if you like her say "really? shes a cutie. we'll have to hang out sometime"   if you dont like her "say hah yeah? thats funny"
hhLnhOmgaa	hmmm....    well it sounds like she is having some problems...    i think she shouldn't forgive him right away but talk to him...    she has the right to be mad at him but don't make it too bad that he will want to do more!      :)|`|LViLdW6haa	She should go buy some good hardcore drugs and have some bonding time with him.|`|VxHvIVWoaa	Your friend needs more time to plan and decide what to do because it is not easy to have that kind of problem especially the one she love has the problem over drugs. Tell her that she make a move by telling him in an honest manner that she doesn't like a person who use drugs. Its a good thing to manifest her feelings to the boy at the beginning for him to understand that her girlfriend really dislikes being in prohibited drugs. Help also the boy by suggesting to send him self in a rehab center to recover. : )
yktlEbZeaa	im having the same problem with my boyfriend so people told me to talk to him about movies or music and whatever u do dont be shy or else he will try to end the conversation
oJREkyDDaa	Of course he likes you, he's calling you those names because he thinks that's what you are. Yes I would invite him to the movies if you want to. Why not try going with just you and him?  Hope this helped and good luck.
AaZCmTGUaa	That depends on how you and your spouse feel about this subject. If both agree then there is certainly nothing wrong with it.     I am against pornography as a means of arousal and gratification. I find it disloyal and dishonest. I respect and honor my husband that much that I am committed not to look at other men with sexual desire. I can acknowledge beauty but I do not intentionally consume pictures or movies with naked men in it (I am not talking about Hollywood motion pictures and the occasional bare butt of some actor). I actually don't even feel like I want to do it; I am certainly not feeling I am depriving myself of something. I am just naturally not attracted to any other men.     I expect the same from my significant other.|`|AVePRVWKaa	I personally feel that it is, unless you are looking at it with your significant other. It just seems kind of deceitful to me if you do it behind their back|`|98181102c394b59c9cbd53b723ee58dfaa	i think so, if you have to do it behind thier back than its bad!|`|RqRQqQ86aa	I don't believe that it is bad because it can give the couples ideas on how to keep their sex life interesting.|`|AA12070828	I consider it about on the same level as reading romance novels. I have read parts of some and they can get very descriptive.|`|jmtbtVYsaa	Not bad.  Every guy I know got one or looked at one.  Just how much are we talking about here.  If you spend too much on watching porn and getting off on it rather than to your wife or spouse, there might be a problem there.|`|O2xwMwHYaa	if it is obsessive yes. but because anything obsessive is bad. i think its fine if its in moderation and especially if you watch together ;)|`|SHjn55oAaa	Why would it be?  Would you rather have your spouse out at a strip club looking at naked people?  Looking at porn is a natural thing, and as long as its not getting in the way of your sex life then all is good!|`|7VxNpWepaa	I think it is considered bad. You are probably looking at it because your wife does not satisfy you. To me all porn is ...just a fantasy...You are getting off at someone you wish you had.  Good luck|`|3gXQPso5aa	my husband does not but i would not be mad if he does!|`|ZmdIlkpQaa	Not in my opinion.  My wife and our SO enjoy looking at pron with me, in fact.  Being male and more visual, I tend to look more often, but if I find something especially good, I'll save it or bookmark it and then have them come in when they can.  It's a fun way to talk about fantasies, and to get ideas for spice in our sex life.|`|45HpcZlGaa	Anything you hide from your spouse isn't good.  You should be in a position where you can openly discuss.  Porn can be shared as a couple, and it can be enjoyed individually.|`|k4mGOlwsaa	yes i feel you shouldn't when your married i feel its disrespect-full to your significant other and i feel its also a form of cheating because you are putting aside your spouse to full-fill your own selfish needs my husband has looked at it and i was very hurt by it and not to mention it desensitizes mens brains of thinking that woman should look and act like theses unrealistic porn stars|`|AA11969451	I don't think it is bad to look at if you are married. My hubby and I both watch it and enjoy watching together.
y2X1j7cAaa	i think he like syou but start flirting litlle by little and wait for him to ask you out|`|0fVtHNtmaa	If given the opportunity, he would be in your pants.|`|zLZHvaDraa	I think he is interested. :)|`|W8RqiKbVaa	I think he likes you,  Get his phone   and text him!  Just ask him casually and then see what he says.... but do this on a subject related.|`|GwA7m9Fdaa	He might like you  If he starts talking to you then start talking to him.  I wish thee guy I like would do the same thing|`|3y0w1qIBaa	I think he may likes you.  You should keep a close eye on him.  Try flirting with him and see how he responds.
bpm7OcbTaa	If your boyfriend constantly makes it about sex, pressures you to give in, or talks to others about you in that way, then it is very likely that he is only interested in sex from you.  For the next couple of days, pay attention to what he does, how he touches you, what he says to you.  If you do these things you don't have to "test" to see if he wants you for sex, you will plainly see it by his actions and how much of a big deal he makes about it.  Another way to observe is if you are having sex, cut it off altogether and see how he reacts.  His true colors will show eventually.|`|58624ad5fd2dd57e6a4e665efe1fee92aa	Keep your legs closed! If he doesn't dump you, then he loves you! :)|`|EDXh0tk9aa	Does he take you out in public? Do others know about your 'relationship'?  Does he spend quaility time that doesn't include sex or making out?  Does he share what's going on in his life with you?.  .  Could be he only wants one thing.|`|A6RHLEmraa	Listen to your friends.  Yes, he is.  No test needed.|`|G0pDFMSPaa	Use him back sex is a wonderful thing to share between two people.  If all he wants is sex he may move on one day, but you guys are young and that should be expected.  Just enjoy your youthful sex lives and enjoy each other.    Stop pretending this will lead to marriage, it is just kid stuff so have fun with it!
G0pDFMSPaa	Stay with him, especially if he knocked her up before dating you.  If she's your bast friend and if you all can handle it, it could be good for the kid to know his dad.|`|d5928aef823e729cbef56cb2408fdda4aa	You're kidding.......right? I've heard of a "no-brainer" but if you can't figure this one out then you should be attending a special school.|`|2216244481d213debef4605befb5d3a2aa	HELLO!!!  Why are you even asking this question, dump the bum.  He will have a child to take care of now, which means you will have to put up with the baby mama drama.....  Besides, he's a cheater, you're better than that and deserve better...|`|tSqrlHcsaa	THEY BOTH CHEATED ON YOU! DUMP THEM BOTH!!!!!!!|`|diAqosiIaa	break up with him......but if you feel that you want to stay with someone who slept with someone who was suppose to be your bestfriend and is no about to have a baby then do what you feel is right|`|afkygHMgaa	Are you serious? Your boyfriend disrespected you by cheating. He not only cheated but carelessly did it with your best friend. You should not only dump him but get rid of that so called friend of yours. Neither one of them cared enough about you or your feelings.|`|qjg0g5WMaa	he is a snake your friend is a bad as he is dump them both|`|WFRooU7Maa	Stay with him  Maybe you'll get pregnant too  And you and your best freind can  have kids at the same time    YAHHH|`|YIvIVvWFaa	Make very sure that this is true, and if it is, you should absolutely break up with him and be finished with her as well. A real friend is loyal and doesn't sleep with your bf behind your back, no matter how bad the temptation. They are both disgusting.|`|HYnBeyJsaa	Normally in situations like this I would say talk with your boyfriend, however there is nothing to talk about...at least not with him anyway.    First, ask your best friend why she even decided to have sex with your boyfriend knowing good and well that you was his girlfriend ( because when you really think about it your BOYFRIEND and your BEST FRIEND betrayed you ). After that simply just call your boyfriend and break up with him, unless you want him to go and have sex with somebody else and risk the possibility of them getting pregnant as well.|`|Q8CS0x0Kaa	Brake up with him. I don't know if you just now got with him, or if he cheated on you but, your friend is going to need him to be there for her throughout the pregnancy and after the baby is born. Either way, it will not work out with you and him.|`|1rHgZ0Y8aa	I would contact Jerry Springer on that one...duh!!|`|B0ypUuHXaa	Break up with him! Soon he'll have a baby and you might not be on top list of priorities. And what about your best friend? He might go back to her.|`|bP5zyipXaa	dump him why,  would you ever consider staying in a situation that you would be reminded evey day that he cheated and you would be reminded every time they had to do something concerning the kid and if their late getting back you would think he was cheating|`|H0HPx0kwaa	Brake up with him. He cheated on you and got someone else prego.|`|YFMaRxaWaa	BREAK UP WITH BOTH OF THEM.SHE'S NOT YOUR BEST FRIEND.|`|9TWdWoTwaa	Yes be an idiot and stay with him. Use your common sense you retarded sod.|`|Xf3ixVWTaa	Ima gonna fix dat rat|`|qWL2aUxGaa	Break up. That's just wrong and messed up.

Sorry...|`|ZOcoyJD3aa	if he got her pregnant what makes you think he won't get u pregnant  so yea break up with him|`|ifC1aFHxaa	By all means you need to break up with this guy. He is about to become a father and needs to sort through all of that. Plus, you need some extra free time to help your friend deal.  Whatever you three decide, please keep the interests of this new child in mind. He (or she) didn't choose to come into this drama.  Help your friends make good decisions, but definitely stop the romance.|`|JXpU6ro4aa	break up, not only cause he cheated on you but you also don't want any baby daddy drama.|`|6TVl5nTBaa	you need to break up with him, if he is not a 100% faithful to you, you dont need him. I maybe hard, but it will be harder to be in a relationship with a guy, who cant keep it in his pants and has a kid. How weird would that be to explain to the little guy or girl.|`|qAWxOyWdaa	well First talk to him about it to see if it was actually him or not. If he did do that then you need to break up with him. How could you go out with a guy that you can't trust? there is no use on carring on a situation like this, i wouldnt be to happy with your bestfriend too if she went behind your back and had sex with him. I would say just talk to neither of them|`|6edczUEBaa	Are you serious about this question? Why would you even have to ask? BREAK UP WITH HIM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!11|`|3L4fPlpmaa	BREAK UP WITH HIM!  i'm sorry but if he DID get ur friend pregnant then you should leave him alone. if u like him a lot then talk to him about it. See what he has to say and if its not good enough for you then dump him.|`|da330e0e035c143b531f239aba874120aa	i think that ur friend jus could be lieing to u so ask about what exactually went on between them if anything an then u'd kno for sure and if he did cheat dump him|`|1jn3W4wMaa	First find out if it is really true, if it is break up with him.|`|AA10566319	LMAO r u serious he cheated on u and got her pregnant and ud stay!?!?!?! r u crazy or whayt stop being friends with her and break up never talk again|`|YeWl5L0saa	why on earth would you stay with someone who cheated on you??? with your best friend none the less! how could you even call her your best friend? get rid of both of them and move on with your life. plus he broke the news to you over the phone, thats so tacky and disrespectful. plus your best friend should have been the one to tell you also. where is she? wow. this is a sticky situation and im sure you feel hurt and betrayed but pick yourself up and move on to bigger and better before you fall even deeper into this black hole.|`|ssV78RU9aa	Break up with him. Not only did he disrespect you by cheating on you but he had sex with your "best friend" and now they're having a baby.That's just wrong.|`|GbF7pqQDaa	Do what you feel in your heart. If you think staying with him is the right thing then you should.    But personally I would beak up with him. Especially since she is my bf. If they dated then idk........... But if he was cheating on you then I probably would break up with him.|`|bjMFMtQKaa	i think that u should leave him now... he wasnt faithful he cheated on u and he could do it again...   forget him hes a cheater just like she is. u dont belong there.|`|53U4ce9caa	Totally break up with him. The guys a jerk, he went behind your back had sex, with your best friend and now he has a babby to worry about as the consiquence. What an a** hole, also an idea to help you break up with him is to be like, you went behind my back, and you have a kit if things to sort out now, and you need to realize you are going to be a dad. Plus if you stay with him u might be a home wrecker. And skrew up the babys life, dont do it thie kid will be skrewed up enough.|`|7nGwou8uaa	he cheated on you. YES|`|4cQSsDaZaa	BREAK UP RIGHT AWAY!!!!!!|`|oBk1bD1yaa	break up wit him. he shouldnt have cheated on you like that. he sounds like a pig|`|i7rYRvlTaa	break up!!!  run away fast!|`|wSq80V1xaa	Why do you even have to ask that question?|`|ovDqPtg8aa	uh. obviously break up with him. duh. he cheated on you, majorly.  you shouldn't even have to ask! lol  it's your BEST FRIEND....|`|aClEgPgMaa	Break up. He cheated on you!|`|4d3Md9pnaa	Ohyes.  You really want the guy who impregnated your best friend while he was dating you. ** rolls eyes **  BREAK UP WITH HIM.|`|THuplVHpaa	I would break up with him.. That's low!|`|5IIEknR7aa	Break up with both of them!! He cheated on you and what kind of friend is she? Double betrayal - The worse kind.. Good Luck|`|lFqm9XlUaa	Definitely break up with him. I do not even know if I would want to stay friends with ur supposedly best friend. Good Luck though.|`|TTfkI4Zqaa	is that really a question?!!!! dump him!!! he cheated on you, he is not worth it at all. he is the father of your best friends baby! why would you want to stay with him?!  that makes no sense that you are even asking that question. let me ask you something.. do you want to watch your best friend walk around with your boyfriends baby in her?  do you want to stay with him, knowing that he has cheated on you, and not only that, but did it with your best friend, and knowing that it is a possibility that he will do it again with anyone?|`|01pY6dW9aa	WTF.  BREAK UP WITH HIM!  No boyfriend should even do that in the first place!|`|OuQJYm4zaa	Is he denying it??  uhm you should definitely get to the bottom  of the entire situation first.  and if it turns out to be true,  then yes you shouldn't even question whether or not  to stay with him.  he had sex with her, cheated on you  with not just anyone but with your best friend.  that shows that he doesn't care for you or your feelings  and it's also disrespectful.  He would never be worth your time.  and also I'd lose the friend,  she was in it as well and no best friend  under any circumstances should sleep with your boyfriend.|`|keEfXfg8aa	that is f**ked up. i would leave him. then never talk to the buddy.|`|YqoxcTN9aa	i dont know you could stay with him or be her best friend, they both betrayed you
MYbRICxqaa	You ex-boyfriend still cares for you, but I don't think he wants you back. The true and deep feelings you have for a person is not here in this situation.|`|qSgdlWWNaa	Maybe he just wanted to clear the air between you two. Maybe what you had two years ago, apart from a relationship was a really good friendship and he wants that friendship back. Maybe you should ask him...
KNhiLxkEaa	wow hailey everytime i see a piccy of you ,, you always look SO different your still gorgyfied and he was NOT any guy wud be lucky 2 have ya. u dont deserve no less than jonny depp not that fat ugly bAsTaRdoo. LOL!!|`|b4utBwY9aa	The best way to find a guy is to wait and let him find you.  Whenever you're searching for something, you never find it :)    Relax, he'll come :)|`|zOIgzIy4aa	my goodness no your not ugly dear. maybe your trying too hard to find someone. just be nice and dress nice and sooner or later you will find someone but don,t just take anyone. you have to be careful because some guys all they want is get into your pants.

TMi1GhSHaa	the picture doesnt work but i msure they like you.
e058c73752697cb2225cc562af0316b3aa	If he won't listen and understand you, then you have 2 options    ]either do it his way.  or leave the relationship foreve and do it your way.    either way is hard, but in the long run leaving, If his heart is in the right place he will understand.|`|5MxKdoixaa	I've been done this road... very much in love, but a waste of a year. Taught me how to spot the losers ahead of time. I put a lot more effort into trying to keep it going than you have so far, though. Visited him at his barracks a 5 hour flight away several times.   Pretty much, keep him happy, but stay a bit distant. He's just scared about going abroad.
imXPYucSaa	the smell of a womans hair  when a girl nibbles on my ear.  those are just two of many.|`|ry6vQwwSaa	haha i get turned on really easily thesedays...but i'd go for a seductive pose, some kinky lingerie, being teased, teasing pics...lol the list is endless..|`|6TA3iPvqaa	Pregnant chicks.  ;)|`|oGWQil5daa	A woman who dresses well and takes care of herself.    A woman who is the girl next door.     A woman who is girly.    Blondes in general.
mfFh1OAgaa	ok. i had the exact same problem. like i was crazy with this girl.    never plan and remember something to say to her. just go up and say something, the first thing that comes into your head. if you revise something to say it will sounds fake, and she will always say the exact opposite to what you want her to say. i have tried it.    its VERY VERY difficult to just go up to a girl you dont know and try and get her to like you. maybe get her number somehow or send a message via IM. but dont go talking to her about like how you love her, save that to tell her in person.    so yeah, get her number i suggest at first.  then say like "hey im that kid who texted you"    it would also be easier if your friends new her somehow, and you could be introduced that way, or at like a party.         you cannot be deeply in love with this girl. you dont know her enough. well you have the same feeling as love, you just fancy her or have a crush on her real bad.     so i would suggest getting her eye contact, trying her to look back at you, and try and hold it. then just go up and say hey, i have seen you around but i dont know your name?. and try and hit off a convo. but dont try and seem too desperate.
fnhpfvARaa	i agree with you. that was an opinion question, and that was your opinion. the asker was probably overweight, so dont stress it.|`|emLigoQQaa	nope! different people find different things attractive. and yeah, you can love a person's personality, but you can't date them if you aren't attracted to them, that's the difference between friendship and infatuation.|`|P3GgROxtaa	yeah i agree with you. not many people like fattys anyways.  unless their a fatty themself, not to be mean........cause some  of them are really nice and stuff. but yeah...their not my type|`|FYdKoA4Paa	well, it's not deep. that's for sure.    some fat people are nice. i'm over weight and i'm a better man then most. but that is my opinion. i forgive you. so still too shallow for dinner tonight? jk...|`|AA11795191	Well, I think it makes you shallow. Attraction is important. So what if you get the rockstar football player in high school? And if you guys start dating for a long time. Suddenly, middle age spread sets in and he's traded in his six pack for a keg. Does that mean you stop loving the person? Or that you arent attracted to them anymore?    Listen, kiddo, attraction and good looks are fleeting. Personality and loving someone for who they are is forever.|`|USmde2Zcaa	You ARE basing a relationship on someones looks,which was your definition of shallow.    What if they were barely overweight,and the weight suited them or something?|`|tzzYdnZKaa	You don't sound shallow. If you wouldn't be friends with them because they are overweight then that is being shallow but appearance is also important. I agree with you
ZJdeXNiHaa	Looks matter, it's a fact of life.  I personally try to eat healthy, play sports, lift weights and live an active lifestyle.  I'd prefer to date someone who likes to be active like me, I know genetics can play a factor so if someone was a little thick but worked hard to stay in shape I'd have no problems dating them.  People that get upset when others aren't physically attracted to them are probably hypocrites, why did he want you to get with his friend in the first place?  I'm guessing because your at least somewhat attractive, so if he's attracted to you and complains that your not attracted to him he's a hypocrite.
2c88J3M7aa	Maybe..  He might be confused becuase he thought that you liked him, but then you talk to other guys so he's probably wondering about that. Or he could be confused because he deosn't know how he feels about you yet ;)
W0qobYuyaa	try to message a myspace admin (probably Tom) or look in the help section.|`|3Rr5SAhhaa	just delete her from your friends and delete anything that she sends you and set your page to private so she cant see anything.|`|B8Exjv8gaa	heres some advice.. lose the myspace unless you want to get raped.. that solves both your problems the girl you hate and the not getting raped part
tG1vTi0Daa	First of all stop apologizing. It was just a kiss. If he broke up with u after 4 years because of that, he was jus lookin for a good excuse to break up with u. He may have thought u special with u were with him, but this other girl must have ment something more in the back of his mind.   Im almost twenty, and one lesson ive learned is to never believe sweet tallking. Thats why its called "sugar-coated" is because underneath its actually bitter, its not true or real. Guys lie and mostly cant be trusted.  Let him go, if he comes back, make sure u arent doin it because u miss him. In my eyes, he did u wrong.|`|Mu6E3SF2aa	it wasnt ur fault  and if he doesnt take relationships seriously then why is this so important to him??  it makes no sense  i wud try to get over him  u dont hav a future w/ him if he hates commitment|`|ErNNjUdjaa	You poor dear, I say that he probably did just lie about everything.  Usually guys are like that especially when he went out with another girl after such a short period of time.    I say that you should just take time to heal because that is all that you can do, just pick up the pieces and move on with your life.    And even though it might take months to years, eventually the pain will become less and less and soon it will be gone. Just take this as a life lesson and wait for that good guy to come along and love you.    I hope that I helped you and I'm sorry for your loss, I was once in your shoes too...|`|wnME0d4uaa	I am sorry for one to hear he broke your heart. :/ it is really hard!!     i get where your coming from and where he is coming from but he should  be happy that you told him what you did. Cause you could have just hid it and never told him about it then he would have found out and it would be alot worse, and him not talking to you is very common because you really hurt him and sorry just wont cut it for him.. i think what would be best is call him once. ONLY once and TELL him (dont ask because then youd be giving him a choice) to meet you somewhere so you can talk and if he sayd yes make him promise he will be there. and then tell him how you feel and how sorry you are maybe shead a few tears.. hopefully he will forgive you.    of course the things he said ment something just because he is puting those type of things on facebook doesnt mean he never cared about you. He just wants you to get jealous and im sure he misses you too thats why hes getting around like he is because he does miss you and its hard for him to get over you so hes having all these rebound girls there so hes not alone through the process.. do you get what im saying?    i hope it helps somewhat with him. and i hope he does talk to you again good luck sweetie|`|UbXp2K26aa	You say you love him yet you get drunk and kiss someone else? Let me tell ya something, one time I got really really drunk at a pool party. Some guy had been eyeing me down all night.. at one point he had me in his arms in the pool, but after not even a second I thought of my boyfriend and pushed the guy away before he could kiss me and got out of the pool. I sat in the corner for the rest of the night talking to my friend about how terrible I felt. I drank a LOT. I've been faithful to my bf from the very beginning 2 years ago. It's not hard to just not do it! So in many ways I don't blame him for doing what he did to you. I think he did mean those things, but how can you look at someone the same when they kiss someone else? it's like a mental block, I've been cheated on and I could never again trust the other person, no matter how much they apologized. Would you have gotten over it if it was him doing the cheating? Honestly. You can deny it on here, but not to yourself. Also, maybe he saw something in the other girl he didn't see in you? Get over it, you messed up girl.|`|TRvAhhNKaa	Ignore him. He's not worth it. Cheaters only deserve each other. Move on.|`|h0oceAwAaa	MOVE ON. HES not worth itt.
QzyUTwq8aa	well, if you guys are just friends, then the tea thing is sweet :)  not too much like flowers, but i dont know her.  if you think it will push her away then dont do it.  afterall, im sure you dont want to totally loose her!|`|3L4fPlpmaa	your head maybe she'll like you more for it  or if you get the idea that shes playing hard to get then follow your heart!|`|waxfwGqaaa	Hey, if you like the girl go for it.    But if she constantly refuses after this to be something. You need to move on. For your heart's sake.|`|cUyxNNDGaa	definitely go with your heart, send the subtle gift. But dont be too flashy about it. Just something simple. :) you sound really sweet|`|3a14e81c67aea9721d43997a7afd76a7aa	do what you heart says , but also you dint want to push the issue...good luck|`|y9wE6Qm5aa	Awww. I think you should listen to you'r heart.  Thats the cutiest thing I've eva heard.  THE HEART IS ALWAYS RIGHT U KNOW!
cb10953b2f0dad5e0861aa07228435e5aa	Well, if she said to keep it just as friends, then you definitely don't want it to be.... too.... relationshipish. I think it's a good idea that you aren't going to send flowers or whatever. And a good idea that you send the tea. Especially if she talked about it last time yall hung out. Make sure the card isn't like really boyfriend girlfriendish either. You probably should try to move on. It will be hard but hopefully, in time, you will be able to overcome all that and make it through.
b2f05254ed10a5821d8b08c2f268ba89aa	i think if she really doesnt want to date u then u should respect her and walk away. she will miss wat she cant have TRUST ME. she wants u 2 run after her and chase her. let her b and dont get her anything and she will wonder why  BEST OF LUCk|`|CaMOjt5kaa	Dude... TEA?!? wtf. get something nice or something that she'll really like. Unless she drinks tea every day, get her something she'd really love. Chocolate and flowers don't suck either.
UgcPxd4maa	compliment - sounds like you had an effect on him in that 2 months you dated, he obviously thinks you're cute...|`|yyDvNEJ8aa	Its a compliment.  He says to STAY that way, which mean you already are.  If you like him, have dinner with him.|`|517360c1a1db979fb2f19bbb959f22eaaa	Do you really hear a diss in this?|`|o2Iez6n0aa	How exactly can that be anything but a compliment?  Are you somewhere where beautiful has a different meaning :S?  Hes saying, I hope you STAY (MEANING YOU ARE ALREADY ) BEAUTIFUL ( A GOOD THING) ,FOREVER.    It means he thinks your beautfifukl.  Prob wants to get back together|`|tOoJL7sYaa	sex, definably...it was also a diss...|`|NJT54RZIaa	I would take it as a compliment and if he wants to have dinner maybe its to catch up on things.|`|2ebd8c899f6ffcd59a224386f106fbcaaa	Sounds like you are obsessing.  Go out, have dinner with him.  He probably meant it as a compliment.|`|7l3YdrNvaa	he still has feelings for you.....  what made you think that was a diss?|`|FyyJ6lpbaa	of course its a compliment..it means ur beautiful and he hopes u stay that way foever..duh  u shouldnt have to ask|`|GkqTIGVqaa	Compliment cuz he doesn't want you to get ugly|`|GfCRiueRaa	It was a complement. Not the best phrased complement, but still one nonetheless. hahaha. He probably misses you.|`|4YqL4iCcaa	Hmmm, I don' t think he was trying to diss you, but it is an odd comment to make. I think he was probably trying to flirt with you (he's just not that good at it). I think if he is a sweet guy and you have any feelings for him you should go out to dinner..what's the worst that could happen right?     Good Luck and kudos for saving yourself!|`|16dZsUD8aa	compliment|`|dthpLcVbaa	Didnt you ask this already?  I am going to say diss this time.|`|77c5a91bceea9e50b5752fb640874a54aa	He wants to have sex with you! 100%|`|MHQVnqaXaa	its a compliment, just badly worded and rrreally cheesey.  he still likes you, fyi.|`|xkgcYeXPaa	it was a diss in chinese culture staying stay beautiful forever means to never grow old and find happiness but instead to suffer as you stay young and watch every one you love die.|`|0HGOznoaaa	Sounds like a compliment to me.  Go out to dinner and find out.  What have you got to lose?  If you like him and he likes you it is a beginning.|`|26cZBMwVaa	i think this is stupid a very stupid question since hes flirting nd obviously wants to date u|`|029d970e89f49628d1a27a4f7084f48faa	How could that NOT be a compliment?
iZrMceyxaa	It is hard when the feeling is not reciprocated and sometimes you can never rid yourself of the crush you have for him ever in life. However, you simply must move on and live your own life.|`|EE7sAaMlaa	OMG - same situation!..kind of apart from my guy is no longer interested lol and i cant get ova him. Yeh please message me wen u work this one out, i cant get ova him. i tried writing all my feelings down and tht helps - i guess i jst wnted to warn u rather than answer u here - i found myself in love with this guy and couldnt get ova what we no longer had, i took all my anger out on myself and now im a mess. jst stay away from anything potentially self destructive for reasons ova him like drugs and drink and sex.   good luck x|`|d49ZA5xYaa	You're best bet is to honestly just assassinate him by using a long range sniper rifle strategy. Drive up to his residence, but stop about a kilometre away from his house. You're going to have to know exactly where his bedroom is. At exactly 10:13pm on a Sunday night, preferably this weekend cause the Super Bowl is on, and that's when most men are at their weakest. Take out your M16 rifle, and zoom in on his head. Fire three times.   If you kill his dog, give yourself 3 points. And relax, if you get one more family kill, you can call in an AirStrike on his house, thus exploding everything around. Pack up the gun and dispose of all evidence, than drive home and pour yourself some scotch.    Just kidding :) get over him, its as easy as 1, 2, Pie.
Lsa2LPrMaa	never change yourself so someone can like you better  there is a guy out there who will love you just the way you are.  im married and my husband doesnt like when i wear my hair a certain way or dress a certain way but i tell him tough luck if i like than thats all that matters.  and then he really likes that i stand up for myself and i do what i like to do even if he doesnt like it all the time.  seriously lose this guy. dye your hair the color you want. not all guys like brunettes like the one your dating.  just be yourself. and if he cant handle it or doesnt like the REAL you.. than he doesnt deserve you|`|t0uIgY08aa	be yourself if he does't love you for you then move on|`|AA10471659	That's where you have to decide, it sounds like He took away the things that made other guys look at you all the time. It is not that he hates the way you were before, he wants you to be less attractive to other guys. that is what happened here. You got toned down to please his fear of you attracting other guy's. You have to decide if you want a plain brown wrapper or a wilder look.  like you were before.|`|KaAXJJo8aa	If he made you change, it is soooooooooo not worth it. be who you are :)|`|b7gUW0CRaa	OK! thats toooooo much!oh...and i like ur style.it would be fun to date someone like u.lol...be who u are.if it hurts pretending to be someone u arent then change back.hes not worth it|`|0qm2raXBaa	I think you should change only when you want to change.  It's okay to change for someone else, but do it when you're ready...and if he or she is really worth it.  It sounds like you're not ready to give up what you gave up so my best advice is to do what you like, wear what you like, be the old you that was really happy.  Don't live your life for someone else, they have their own chance.  If he wants to wear "calmer, classier clothes" then let him wear them.  And if he likes brunette, then maybe he need to dye his own hair or go find a brunette because honey, if you wanna be a blond, you go be one!  Life is too short to be a people pleaser all the time especially when it makes you unhappy or not as happy as you would be if you were doing you.  Good luck.|`|65653c6c063e99db1f7f272c5c93e006aa	I feel your delemia.  I was constantly remaking myself to suit what I thought he wanted and niether of us were happy.  (I am back to being me, dressing the way I choose and we are getting a divorce).    Maybe he is just a malcontent because I'll bet you were dressing  for yourself when you got involved with him...why did he give you the time of day then if he hates it so much...?|`|e7f7b9508f28f00c8e34cd692587ca8caa	If U have to change for him , he's not worth it|`|h3LXI1Wvaa	if he loves you, he'll love you for the way you are;  i say stick to yourself and don't change just for him (:|`|rfkVin6Iaa	e should have liked you the way you were before, and maybe he did. Ask him if he likes you better now that you changed yourself.|`|tDeYQV6raa	it sounds like he's been a positive influence on you.  i see nothing wrong.      i'm a black and white kind of guy.    but to me it seems like you might as well be saying      "i used to do e and cocaine on a regular basis, and loved going to parties, my boyfriend has convinced me not to do this, and i have been sober since dating him, did i change to much?  NO      there is no such thing as too much positive change.|`|l3eT6IZzaa	he should love you for who you are... stop changing yourself... if you don't attract him then he wouldn't even care for you in the first place...|`|U1e7wJgYaa	obviously he doesn't like U for you hesbuilding his dream girl out of u dump him|`|SyUeecsBaa	he should like you as is . you shouldn't have to chanqe for him . you should only chanqe because ( you ) want to .|`|VYJp1Tifaa	i used to change for guys but its not worth it. if he really loves u then he would love u for who you r. if ur not happy then breakup with him. but first change back to ur clothes and ur hair and personality then c what he says. if he is outraged with u then breakup with him because obviously he isnt loving you for who you are|`|Ggv3evcqaa	be yourself. wouldn't it be a waste of life if you were pretending to be someone else?|`|KDyG2vCoaa	gurl kick his **** to the curb|`|Nig6z3Cnaa	well i think you changed your clothes for the better.|`|0rpS2b97aa	Be who you want to be and how you are comfortable.

I would talk to him if i were you.....he may be completley unaware of how you feel about these changes.....if he really loves you he will love any way you look......your looks should not be the reason the relationship works or not.....talk to him|`|ENCktJmtaa	i'm all for changing to better yourself, but if you're unhappy then i think you went overboard. i got my boyfriend to change how he dresses, because he used to wear only plain tshirts (from walmart) and i found it really boring/unflattering on him. you should dress how you want to, and if he doesn't like that then that's too bad. i'm sure there are some things you would change about him if you could, but he wouldn't be happy about. maybe you can compromise somehow. like, dye your hair back to blonde with colours, but keep your clothing more conservative. you guys should talk about this with each other.|`|JvY5KL22aa	i used to date someone like ur bf... it really sucks! i think that the person you choose to date should be someone who's interested in the way you are already. why should you change yourself just to make someone else happy! if you're not happy with yourself you cannot expect to make others happy. you should go back to the way you were before. i used to do the things you're doing. it messed me up all around. i was so depressed, i would cry in school (when i was in HS) and i just wasn't happy. i wasn't myself. don't ever change for ANYONE BUT YOURSELF!! take care girl!! good luck!|`|p8lNnrzqaa	yeah  i think you changed too much for your bf i mean if the guy really likes you than he should like you for who you are and not want to change anything about you, believe me it would hurt at first hearing all this but as time goes by i think you will realize that you deserve a better guy than that. you should never have to change everything you are just bcuz of a guy.   hope this helps :]|`|ToYmTw8gaa	i think changeing for him is only okay if ur happy with the change...if ur not happy about it..talk to him about it!|`|oWtDt5WNaa	in my opinion you changed alot for him. Maybe not too much because your with him for a reason. If you think he wouldnt be with you unless you changed then he is shallow, go back to who you used to be. Wear what you want and change your hair to what you like. If he left you because you changed back to "you" then he isnt for "you".|`|AA11532563	You really shouldnt change ur self because he isnt really falling for the person you are hes falling for the person hes creating .|`|MYnH6UKQaa	make yourself happy before you do anything, if that means changing back, do it! he should be able to accept that and if he cant thats real shitty.|`|NGT9HQmnaa	Don't ever change who you are for anyone. You know who you are & who you want to be. Don't let anyone stop you from being you. If he changes you and your less happy it was not meant to be!|`|2S6iXcmCaa	well just do what u feel like doing no guy is worth changing all of that cuz thats what u like thats what makes you, you. he got u the way that u use to be so why change it obviously he liked it before he cant change his mind like that|`|YqiSa3nSaa	I think you should ask him since he is the one you want to please. You have to be yourself though and find that someone that makes YOU feel good. Mention it to him and you will feel much better about the situation.|`|1kZ5q0Juaa	I think...that you need to be you. If he likes you for the things you're changing, he's liking an illusion. Wear the clothes that YOU like, and wear your hair the way you want it. If he doesn't like you for who you are then...he's not worth it. You, and everyone needs someone who likes them for themselves. I know you feel for him, but make sure you stay true to yourself too..|`|EL3MYjJGaa	YES you are changing yourself for him. If he didn't like your style before then why is he even dating you? the fact that he is making these hinting comments is disrespectful. he knows what he's doing. sometimes guys try to test girls to see how much influence they have over them. if you feel like you can't be yourself around him then MOVE ON. let him find a conservative brunette while you live your own life.|`|NkTC4eGcaa	Sweetie, if your bf doesn't like you for who you are, and you have to change for him, he isn't even worth your time. Trust me, I've been there. Be yourself, be what makes you happy. Otherwise you're just going to miserable. And he isn't worth your happiness. If you go back to the way you were before and he has a problem with it, leave him. He isn't worth it.|`|AGheglgxaa	Its Time For Role Call!    Sometimes guys play the pessimistic, uncontrollable, egotistical, sexist, and sometimes undeserving role in the relationship     And women play the moody, argumentative, spiteful, jealous and sometimes desperate role in the relationship    So call him on the things he does that don't necessarily go rite with you and im sure you'll both find some common grounds.  So if you change your hair color so what say the color was peeling..**** does he look that close!? Say it was giving you split ends so your mom died it back..Dont let him Run you.. F*** dat if he doesn't like da color den say "ok then go find urself a brunette then"..    I kinda feel the same way about clothes tho but i think he means around him don't wear provocative outfits..lol ;)
Xrf0tK5baa	First dates can be so bad but so good. Its your only chance at a first (in person) impression. I met my bf online and met him for the first time a year and a half later...I first saw him walking toward me and thought he was so perfect...talking was awkward but it came natural. he asked questions..and I did too. We kind of avoided eye contact at first and eventually got home and well..it was never about the physical..but the chemistry was right.    I am just going to tell you..don't be nervous you have been talking to her on the phone and online..so you already know her...convos came natural then...so dont treat this any different. Now you have the pleasure of seeing each others eyes and facial expression. Think of it as the same as before with benefits. You will be fine, you know her, she knows you, its not that big of a deal.    I assume you know what she looks like and she knows what you look like..now this can be a little nervewracking if you have never met before because online pics arent always the same as the person you thought it was...but wait..you arent there for the looks, are you? You should be there for the person you clicked with on the phone...regardless of how hott she may b. Just think about all the positive things you are attracted to about her and focus on that no ones perfect, its all in the eyes of the beholder.    i have personal experience on this..my bf was overweight when i met him and any other guy would have grossed me out..but i loved him..and it didnt matter...the nervousness from meeting him for the first time went away in a matter of a couple hours. Just think positive and keep up your confidence. You have nothing to be nervous about.|`|tsdHndRhaa	well iam about your age too, and first dates i learned are suppose to be a bit awkward as you both are getting to know each other, so just keep the conversation light and don't try so hard, and pay her compliments and just be yourself and don't put on airs cause people can sense this. and i think you'll be ok.
VyJl1bZ4aa	just out of nowhere, look up at him and just be like "i love you" if it shocks him then well, i dunno haha but it'll make up for when u dont say it. but yeah maybe u should say it more. dont let him be the only one to say it.|`|fnhpfvARaa	learn when to use commas.|`|jep9LpUpaa	just say I love you too!    :)
uNplLsZqaa	I dont think my answer will help but I have the same problem... lol  Someone said that I need to go ask him why he looks at me. Im not going to do that because im a scaredy-cat lol
4HoVVCenaa	Why are you wasting your time with this guy?|`|DXjCEXAkaa	No you are not wrong in any of this. First of all, why would you want to hang out or allow anyone of the cheating and lying sort into your life? You shouldn't waste your time on this guy, and he obviously has his own hidden agenda. If you don't want drama or anyone to get hurt, stop talking to the man all together. Whoops, did I just call him a man? Strike that, drain the piece of crap down the toilet.
LVlS4y7Caa	Well honey, you are living what we call LIFE...and though you're having some catastrophes hit in your youth, be assured it will "build" you stronger in many ways.  I too, have gone through two years of hell, to state the least...am a lot older, but "get" that this is a journey with all kinds of jogs along the way that deter our "path" and derail us - until we get back on...I so understand.  I can you tell you as a mother of a son, how hard it is to hear your story, but it is all too familiar.      Each of us in life, has our turn, as I always say, "at the bottom of the barrel" for awhile, until we regain perspective, understanding, and connect with the realization not only are we all in this together?  -but there is, unquestionably, a higher power at work in our lives as humans.  Understanding this helps...remember, there can't be flowers without rain, there can't be rain without clouds...    I applaud your effort to stay the "course" in spite of all...Having twins will be an awesome responsibility for both you and your wife to be (and I'm glad you're marrying!!!!  Kids need two parents honey...)    -And so sorry about your mother...I know my adult son would flip out if I were not here right now with what we've been through, so I know how you must feel with this enormous loss.  May your epilepsy stay in check with the wonderful drugs they now have and may you find the silver lining of life you need to get you through it - I think its called faith...    Most Sincerely,    Grace|`|IqoRBVUTaa	Your not cursed, your just living. Life throes things at you, you would never have imagined to be thrown your way. I should know. I'm only holding on by only a thread anymore. But I know someones always look'n out for me. You'll make it threw, just as I do every day. Look at the bright side of life. You are about to be married! You are going to have two children that look up to you! You have a sister! And your here in this world.|`|nMWcBYiVaa	no and im sorry but im sure it will get better|`|AA10115609	No you are not cursed. Just bad karma maybe.|`|d7OswsvMaa	awwww..dats soo sad..im practically crying for u..sowwy.. anyway.. just be very Prayerful..dats if ur a religious psn..& if ur not then u need Jesus in ur life. Youll be amazed at the wonderful things he can do for u.|`|2esGKO2Caa	Yep your possessed by a demon!|`|dFE54Nzraa	There is no such thing as being 'cursed.'     I would suggest you start focusing on yourself and let everything else drop in place.     I know my answer is vague but I hope you get the idea.|`|PvblSV0Naa	no your not cursed maybe it's time to step up to plat and start making some decision cause it seems like your families taking you for granted and for a fool.|`|tsdHndRhaa	i just prayed for you before i even started typing this, you have went through a devastating time and iam sorry about your losses but god is in the restoration business and he is gonna restore your family and it's unit, the devil can't get into messing with your head anymore, you are a strong young man and your strength has carried you through and although these horrible events happened to you as in life to others as well, how you handle it is what counts the most and i just wanna say you are a good man and i hope you keep praying and pray for those unborn kids as well as your health and for distant family. you will be in my prayers as well and god bless you for your strength. amen.|`|eAyC1mRZaa	that just means that this year will end really well|`|0dbDQh8Haa	you're not cursed. i'm sorry about your loss, and i'm sorry about the family problems but in times like these it helps to look at the positives: you're getting married and you're having TWINS! that's sounds pretty great to me! congratulations!|`|scnW0Wzeaa	You are not cursed. It's called life. Not all things in life can be happy and good. There are bumps along the way..|`|sNSnXzqfaa	Sometimes you have to go through hell to get to heaven.|`|QdIwuRRVaa	your not cursed  everyone goes through hard times even if some people seem to have it better thats not true and there will be something good for you in the future and what happens in your life is for a reason. and also dont ever forget those who love you and care about you. i wish you the best of luck.|`|xwsS0ITJaa	Don't feel alone.
v66QtbtSaa	we met in school. i was a sophmore he was junior and we constantly saw each other but never said anything to each other. my male best friend was telling him not to talk to me because i had a boyfriend but in reality i didnt my "best friend" of 9 yrz liked me ALOT. but my junior we had cooking class together and on the forst day of school he pulled hair and i went off on him and since then  we would always bring each other little breakfast sandwhichs play around just acting goofy. then one day he came to me crying because his grandfather passed. i wuz shocked he asked me to come to the funeral. ever since then we became real close. i finally told him i had a crush on him since my sophmore yr. he confessed he had a crush on me too and wuz kind of scared to approach me about it. but in the end we finally got together && all around school people was placing bets about us..lol.. that we would get together. im happy he pulled my hair that day beacause since then my life has been great! we have been together for a yr. and 3 months now|`|x88DfLokaa	aww both storys are pretty cute i will admit haha but yeah.  well i dont have a boyfriend right now.. but i meet this guy i datec for almost 3 yrs in hisghschool.. in gym class playing battmitten haha.. random right.. totaly clicthe things happened since then.. 1st kiss dancing on home coming.. movies.. blah blha haha.. but the guy im kinda dtaing know i mett him a loonng time ago and we  just happen to be vactioniog at the same place and same hotel.. weridf right.|`|bcab7e2824c9dc2b7643bdff851f90baaa	Well you will think this is pretty bad, which it was at the time, but it is completely okay now. I met my boyfriend because he was my twin sister's exboyfriend. the moment they broke up after a month of going out, he kept calling me and asking me why she did it . (she really was not clear, she was a very passive kind of person). I tried to get them back together, but it was IMPOSSIBLE- he was such a great guy and i thought that they would be great together, but he was into the lovey dovey stuff, and she wasn't. He kept on calling me for about 5 months, and we were just talking and he started liking me and i started to like him. We ended up going out about 6 months after he had broke up with my sister, and he was my first boyfriend. Of course, everyone in the high school thought this was totally ridiculous and couldn't believe why i had done that to my sister, and my sister was upset with me too. I really liked him and he really liked me so we thought if we just waited it out, everything would be okay. And it has been perfect. I have been with him for over a year now, my sister is PERFECTLY okay and they are close friends, and everyone accepts us. I have tons of people coming up to me constantly, saying how cute we are together. My parents and my friends both believe we could be highschool sweethearts, which i have no doubt about. I have never had a fight with him, ever,(which is shocking to some people) and i love him so much!|`|8AOgHjH0aa	i met my girlfriend on a plane, freaky i know. She was scared of flying so i comforted her and it seemed to be love at first sight ever since. My job pays quite well so i have decided to take her on another plane journey on our 1 year anniversary. I was going to propose then but i thought it may seem a bit lame. What do you think?|`|oCJrWMqTaa	I MET MY BF THROGUGH MY CUZ HE IS ONE OF HIS GOOD FRIENDS AND WHEN I MET HIM HE HAD A GF BUT THEY WERE GOING THROUGH HARD TIMES SO WE STARTED TALKING ABOUT BOTH OF OUR RELATIONSHIP PROBLEMS AND BECAME REALLY CLOSE AND AFTER THEY HAD BEEN SEPERATED FOR 6 MO AND I HAD BROKEN UP WITH MY BF WE HOOKED UP. IT WAS AND HAS BEEN AMAZING FOR GOING ON 4 YEARS WE HAVE A BEAUTIFUL BABY GIRL TOGETHER.
sJTPzFdlaa	Yes, this is obsession. You need to move on from her if you dont want her back. If you do, tell her. She doesnt get to judge who you spend time with or treat them badly.
SLeX0gGaaa	Your not over her. And she may not be over you yet too.
edde127b1150f72ea601ce2bc4a9a90baa	You get out of the"friend" zone when you decide what zone you really want. Always remember that you, and you alone must decide what it is that you want out of a relationship, what works for you, what no longer works for you, where do you see yourself in a year or longer down the road. What is the trade off for you? What are  your strengths and how willing are you to take a good look at yourself   and decide that your heart cannot always rule your head. When something no longer works, it's time to move on, and let go of the past.|`|e37b1e55a5a94cf30d038c8a0dd1c521aa	i agree with both your answers you have.  i am also in that situation , waiting for him ....  if you think that person is worth the wait then maybe  in the end it will be worth it, but if you can't take it anylonger  then you shouldn't or let that person know how you feel babe. Only   worst thing can happen is you find out something you didn't want to know ~    Best of luck to you Babe|`|T8u2IM51aa	you declare that you can no longer be satisfied with "just being friends"  and threaten them that now it's officially all or nothing    sometimes, you just have to be abrupt girl :)
71VRvldJaa	why do you young girls always feel the need to be asking guys how they feel about them!  For goodness sake girl!....give it a rest!  You already asked him once and he denied it......what are you going to do?.,....keep asking until he gives you the answer you're looking for.    You said he's your best mate.....he wouldn't be your best mate if he didn't like you!  He probably just doesn't like you in a romantic way and you need to accept that and quit hounding the poor guy!    You need to learn while you're young that every guy you like isn't going to like you back and you're not going to like every guy who likes you!    He's your friend!  Enjoy your friendship with him and leave it at that!|`|HRJkHuw4aa	he is shy, tell him that you like him too, then he will own up to liking you as well. just say " its a shame that your not in like with me, because I am really in like with you"|`|rbcb5S1Kaa	i wouldnt lol|`|n86J8erpaa	just ask him not a big deal|`|uqTKkKVraa	well do you like him? if you do then tell and maybe then he will admit but if he doesnt then ask him. and if you dont like him just ask him straight up, be serious|`|mpvjUx45aa	you can always tell if someone is lieing but maybe he just doesnt want to tell you yet,|`|OvX1u8Suaa	you e already asked him and he denied it,so why bother asking him again? move on.if he does like you he'll approach you,if he dusn't then it's his loss
TQniQ3tHaa	if u love him, then carry on the dating online
2BatkpPtaa	do what your heart tells u to do! wait a little while and see if it is worth liking him.|`|yex8n8U8aa	Maybe one of your friends could ask if he likes you or something.|`|XzXqsU86aa	he likes you probably|`|7wixocuDaa	a real big factor that he likes you is when he teases you.. is when he always wants to be with you.. um..he wants to see you always.. he's looking for you.. he makes you laugh and then embarasses you because your laughing.. but in that way.. he makes you fell that you're special.. another factor is that he always texts you.. calls you or comments you.. another sign.. is when he stares at you and if you caught his eye.. he would deny the fact that he was staring at you instead.. he would say that he is looking at you because you have something in your face.. i hope this could help..|`|MOD9Poozaa	well i DUNNO too, OK i DUNNO understand i DUNNO|`|da330e0e035c143b531f239aba874120aa	well im not sure what exactually to say the signs are but i would say that if u really like him one day while ur together alone i think u should tell him how u feel and ask him if he feels the same way but just saty calm and dont really think about it to much an u'll b fine.|`|uff3kOoFaa	if he smiles when he sees you in the hallways.   if he stares at you.  if he trys to talk to you any time he possibly can.    that type of stuff :)|`|9CUaikUEaa	if he treats you different than he treats the other girls, and stares at you and show an interest in you then i think he likes you. hang out with him a bit more, be more flirtatious but be yourself aswell.  then when youre more confident around him tell him you like him.
3zGxlguhaa	You just asked this question a few minutes ago.  A life. Get one.|`|TMi1GhSHaa	lol what?? well she probably wants to get to know you.. so maybe she sees you as potential boyfriend.. if you two do eventually see eachother maybe things will work out.. who knows..|`|COmp4sIuaa	She wants you in and around her mouth.|`|9580a1e44dd3d2bae7d2f867611ab353aa	?

A girl you think it hot is giving to a chance to ask her out and your on YA!|`|sNSnXzqfaa	Well it looks like someone has got a crush on you. You should meet her and see what happens next.

But at the same time, something good might happen..so I'd call and give it a shot.   Life's to short, have fun..take risks.  You never know you might end up liking her alot :)|`|twortDpyaa	she's a freak.  don't call her dude.  that's not how things work.  i mean sure it's typical to say a girl looks good, but if she's desperatly wanting you to call her, then its creepy.  plus she doesn't even know you. she might look good, but her personality might be something totally different. maybe you should try meeting her in person first.
0mhcCyE5aa	There is no other logical reason why should would give you her number.|`|tOoJL7sYaa	call her, of course. if you have things in common, then maybe it'll work out. it's plain enough that she likes you...|`|HS44HUrgaa	call her. maybe youll have a connection.|`|bsO0nzVraa	No, she just wants to use you until someone better comes along.|`|koA4n8Tzaa	uhh yeah she probably likes you or she is a crazy stalker        answer my youtube one please someone|`|fdd19f6be025884e97942d805edfbe1daa	Duh.

It doesn't matter how you look, so even though she hasn't seen you, she just knows that your sweet because of what you said. Also, if you think you should call her, then go ahead, she's not going to care if your ugly, she gave you the number because your nice.    So yes! She likes you, or maybe she's pranking you..|`|bxJcxxMeaa	obviously ur friend must of said u were a great person! she probably likes u if she really wants u 2 call her. so, i say call her. maybe u'll like her as much as she likes u. although maybe u should meet her soon!|`|JZ3X3MPUaa	Sounds like she is looking for a boyfriend.

Sometimes we take chances and go with our gut feelings and sometimes we are just very careful with the choices that we make.  If you really feel in your heart that you should call this girl and see what's up.. then do so.. If you think that it's not a cool thing to do.. because of how you met or saw one another.. then don't call her.   Go with your gut feeling and trust , that will be your decision.  But just be careful.. Sometimes things that come that easy made not be that healthy.......... Waiting can be much more of an ideal thing to do. good luck to you|`|AA11298074	maybe she's seen a picture?  lol call her|`|O13GNzuZaa	what, do you still need your mam to wipe your **** haha tool|`|3iIuTmXQaa	yup,(shes interested in you atleast)|`|6487bd61ef059cac042d49119a814a4aaa	duh....yes !|`|3J3IH2maaa	she has a crush on you and likes u|`|9580a1e44dd3d2bae7d2f867611ab353aa	?

feedTbEvaa	I think you should pay your parents something, but $400 a month when you're only receiving $1000 does sound like a bit too much to ask (especially when you consider you just had a child a few months ago).    I believe your parents do not favor you as much as your siblings, or they would like for you to move back out quickly....otherwise I can not see how they could charge their own daughter (who just had a newborn...their own grandson) nearly half of the relatively low amount she's getting once a month.I can't imagine someone living off $600 a month,let alone with a baby.    I would ask them if they would let you pay them half of that ($200) a month, considering that it's only temporary, until you get a job or move back out.If they don't accept that from you....they obviously do not want you living there with them.|`|aMtfWfrHaa	I think that you should pay them some money because you do use their electricity, water, etc...just be thankful that you do have a place to go.|`|vqUVWPBAaa	Yes, you should pay your parents something for living with them. They understand that you are struggling. Your siblings are minors and they are still responsible for them legally. With an infant and you back in the house they have had to pay for the basics. What money your parents earn is theirs. You cannot go anywhere and expect to live for free. Your parents do not owe you anymore.   I suggest you create a budget and try negotiating with your parents on how much you can pay them, maybe $300 a month instead of $400. Generally, you would be expected to pay about a third of your income for housing alone.|`|wd0NmW0saa	It would be nice if they would allow you to live there rent free, but you should never expect it. Maybe they are trying to teach you responsibility and they are helping you in a different way! : )|`|wscyjkPAaa	I think it would be the mature thing to do, you have to pay your parents, it's the least you can do to help around the house.  You get 1000 bucks a month and your parents charge you 400.  Where does the 600 go,  cell phone bills don't cost that much per month, if it does, you need to get a new service.  I'm assuming they provide you with food, and if you're spending that much of personal stuff like super nice clothes or whatever..thats just irresponsible.   Also, it doesn't cost that much to raise a baby in this stage.  I think its fair especially since you have someone to help you with free food, free tv, free running water, and the fact the you are living comfortably.  The least you can do is help the household.  You already have a baby from wedlock, I think its time to start showing a little more responsibility and own up.  I don't think its fair that you have a child and expect to live for free.|`|mim3C59Yaa	if the place ur parents are living in is their own house then i don't think they should be charging u for living there! THEY ARE YOUR PARENTS!! If they are in a apartment, then they have a right to charge u like 1/3 of the rent, even if it might not seem fair to u.|`|97874bdadccb15d84a1874b3af93e4efaa	It seems hard i know. But, yes, 400 a month is reasonable.That's $100 a week, for food, heat, use of house and kitchen,you use hot water, use the garbage, and am sure you also use things like shampoo, toilet paper , typical food stuffs,and so forth. For everything that is "furnished" for you for that amount, it is reasonable. What makes it hard i think for you, is that it is your "parents"..How long do young people think there parents are sup post to sacrifice for them?  You are getting a break by the arrangement you have. You shold still be able to save money. Move when it is best for you AND that new baby, things will be okay. good luck
O3ArS1Poaa	You should leave him alone.... unless you talk to your cousin and she is ok with it.  But it's probably still not a good idea to get involved with ex's of family or friends.|`|8vZ9v9Pqaa	just go for it   these questions are pointless|`|50245e5074843d3b781e05bd05ac05baaa	steer clear that is way too much potential for disaster|`|jj2tSASnaa	nothing|`|koA4n8Tzaa	check with your cousin first or wait a while      answer my youtube one please someone|`|7U9UAtTSaa	Go for it, if shes not with him any more i dont see a problem|`|Kh9Wzrhyaa	You could ask your cousin how she would feel if you wanted to date her ex. If she's cool with it, proceed. If not, well you have to decide what's more important to you: your cousin's feelings or the feelings you have for her ex. Either way, your feelings are not going to disappear anytime soon. Good luck.|`|nLFr9csfaa	If you have a brain in that head of yours you won't do this.|`|Ta34lZQmaa	forget it|`|qwVruoJ8aa	stay away|`|UoEX4mHRaa	Depends how strong your feelings are, if they are pretty strong then talk to your cousin, however if you acting on your feelings cause hurt to your cousin then do nothing, blood is thicker than water after all|`|7ldEn0fJaa	um sit in front of the tv and watch jerry springer..........    ARE U STUPID WHO CARES ABOUT UR STUPID COUZIN|`|pSNex1a1aa	talk to your cousin about it, best thing to do. you really dont want to be torn by a family crisis and by someone you like. Talk to her about how she would feel if you two went out.|`|VADaU7AJaa	talk to your cousin, and if she's okay with it, then go for it. but make sure you don't just jump to anything, and just do it without her. even if she has a new boyfriend, some people aren't okay with their friends dating their ex's. so, when you talk to her, just explain what happened, and tell her how much you like him. explain to her that you understand that it's her ex, and that it wasn't planned really..      hope everything works out well!    try this website, it has a few good ideas:    http://dating.about.com/od/trickydatingq...|`|dLRquZ3Kaa	Make the 1 u like jealous.. dont be afraid, it works! lol|`|f5BWVpHNaa	wow ummm...r ua nd ur couso close...even so you need to chill wid that its not good|`|A6DihblGaa	nothing|`|e48c7a5d6f76e09c4d224cd3b2b5cc29aa	If you have feelings for your cousins ex, and she is now in a new relationship, not to mention that the ex has feelings for you too, then I don't understand the dilemma.   Let her know of your intentions and see him. Take it slowly. Maybe it will be the greatest romance of your life maybe it won't.   But it shouldn't be about your cousin; at least not if you really like this guy.   Good luck
TWH68Dnqaa	No, I wouldn't be angry....I think most guys would be concerned and want to try and fix it. When you tell him you may want to have some suggestions as to ways he may be able to help you get better , assuming you want help.|`|S0f1au1kaa	i'm not a guy but i'd think that he'd be glad you told him. after all a relationship is all about trust!    hope this helps!|`|EvvWL0PSaa	i would be grossed out but idk u should go out and tell him it is the only good way of him finding out|`|Rn9N7E0uaa	I'd be happy that you told me, and I do as much as I could to help.  If he's worth anything, he'd understand that you're going througha  rough patch and he'll help you through it.|`|SFeNqLbNaa	if he loves you enough then he will stand by you and help you get cured. if he leaves you then youll know that he isnt worth it!|`|dlmVTt18aa	Just tell him you need help he could support you. Hope you get help and healthy.|`|tJel8yiFaa	Well, I guess you sit down and tell him.    I would recommend that you do it BEFORE he takes you out for an expensive dinner. But tell him.
SpcYCBndaa	Most importantly, looking confident is all about feeling confident. If you don't believe in yourself, how can you expect someone else to believe in you? Before your big day comes, you must know that you can do it and make it be clear to the other parties involved that you are confident.       Step2Looking confident starts with your posture. If you are sitting, sit up straight and if you are standing stand up straight and keep your shoulders up. Slouching and leaning to the side give a negative feeling to other parties and send a signal that you aren't interested.       Step3 Smile! A smile is a very powerful thing when it comes to confidence. A person who is able to keep a smile on their face no matter how tough the questions get or how difficult the situation gets is certainly a person who portrays confidence.       Step4Don't be afraid to step up and be a leader. Simply following the crowd is not a way to show confidence, but rather stepping up and leading others to a solution shows confidence and true ability.       Step5 Prepare in every way possible Be prepared for every situation that may arise. Preparation is the key to so many things and without preparation it is impossible to look confident. Take the time to be ready!       Step6Be determined to succeed no matter how difficult things get. Determination comes from deep down and if you don't have that determination to succeed others will see that as a lack of confidence in yourself. Put your mind to it and you can do it!|`|GTeGDGzKaa	Never look at the ground  Look people in the eye when you talk to them    SteveC  ........|...  ........|..........2 Points..........|||"|""\__  ........|__________________|||_|___|)  ........!(@)'(@)""""**!(@)(@)****!(@)|`|n2vDq8rzaa	well, felling confident helps.    but if you, don't definately do the following:    Stand with your shoulders back, chin up adn look the world in the eyes.  smile a bit, enough to just seem friendly, nto crazy. don't mumble your words together too much, and dress nicely. don't wear smelly and sweaty things all the time.
Bk1t83pFaa	Because she likes your Mr. Fantastic-ness.      Lol...she's only doing it out of playfulness and affection I'm sure.  I do it to my guy all the time...and he does it right back to me.  And then we end up having butt-grabbing wars.  It's wonderful.  Haha.  ;)
aLwrpMPXaa	When some immature men don't have their "mommy" around, they always need a "comfort zone" or a "comfort girl" for that matter. Setting the record straight when a relationship starts, would be either "scaring them off" or "keep them in the game". It's ultimately up to the woman.|`|dYyiG90caa	Cuz they are BREEDERS and They will take any opportunity they can get -- To Roam the Herd and Take Whomever is Available lol :))    Sorry about that --    SINCERELY -- For Both Men & Women -- You will never Find One that "Makes Sense" -- Until they Mature & GROW-UP.    In the Interim -- You just have to be careful, that you are not with someone who will "Hurt" your feelings.    Yeah -- I know -- Easier Said than Done.    Good Luck, Hon -- We've ALL been thru the Madness of Figuring-Out Men :)  .|`|I3CNklLKaa	Because if you can't be with the one you love then love the one you're with.|`|abc74a7841250ed8830346d501f162a7aa	some men are straight dogs .But hey it can go both ways WOMEN CAN PLAYS THE FIELD TOO ,,,EVEN BETTER|`|eSI9c4Ncaa	You won't really know until it's over.|`|3da28f1bbe5dc0fba1bd4efce35cfe4daa	You don't just start a relationship totally 100% ready to accept the other person. You see a few things you like about the person so you ask them out, then as you go out more and more you find more things that you like about the person but you might also find things you don't like. If you find things you don't like about them then you might not want to continue the relationship.     Don't get me wrong 'm sure some people do indeed date one person while waiting for another but more then likely the relationship started because two people were genuinely attracted to each other but as they learned more about each other, they realized that it was not what they wanted.    I don't think there is any sure fire way to know if someone really likes you or not. You just have to go out meet people and see how it goes. Sometimes you will get hurt but once you do find the person who you are meant for and who is meant for you, then you will remember what it was like to be hurt and be able to appreciate how good this new person treats you.|`|J00cntVtaa	It mostly depends. You never really know or not if their interest is genuine. Sorry, that probably didn't help.
LcOwwxSXaa	i thikn you look good just as you are, what about them designs you can get in your hair rather than braids? x
2QiLmXfhaa	no, cos I feel that people are pressurized, and are all dirty minded to be honest.   I mean if you've read Twilight, how many guys you no would be as sweet and polite as edward cullen today?    i feel like a grump saying this but its what i think. :D|`|45f0c56f7feb9ae97c2bd6ec5b691f76aa	Never, you can't find love in UK at all.     You can find most like, cheat, affair, divorce. Still love doesn't exist in UK and it never existed!|`|lIRCcWpSaa	Take off the last 3 words of your question and we have the question you are trying to ask.    I am from the Uk and had a few relationships and they have not worked out in the long term, so now I have a girlfriend from Mexico who makes me very happy and has seen a much better life living there than I have living in the UK, and she already wants to drag me there, so here's to the future ;-p....good luck!    From somone who is alot happier than was in the past.|`|5F224cRzaa	Well iv always been the one feeling true love and being broken up with soo if thats just the Uk im so moving...|`|su9CEx0eaa	I did|`|5c2tW6d4aa	I'd love to say yes but no|`|AA11346465	I have found my true love. When you find the person you're supposed to be with then nothing will make you look for a different relationship.|`|m5uzV6uqaa	It depends really..    I think it is possible though.|`|hSOfnvuaaa	i have:-) x|`|fy8YNH7jaa	yes i believe true love can be found|`|9TWdWoTwaa	LOLOLOLOLOL No!|`|bf3c4fe8c55434d5a5b7239682a2952caa	i believe that it is always possible to find true love.  but i also believe that the trick is keeping it...|`|l01yTPHWaa	There is always someone for anybody. Just need to find the right person, but don't worry that person will one day be found by you.|`|gjlO9LoGaa	i wish|`|eipiCSQ7aa	Maybe for some people it's not but for me it defiantely is !
3dpIt3PIaa	I'm not a guy, but I wouldn't think that it should bother him. You were drunk! You have an excuse!|`|0W6lIfYVaa	wouldn't bother me at all. he could definatly tell how drunk you were before he started  fooling around with you if you were as bad as it sounds and thats to be expected when you go after drunk girls|`|19c8NIGHaa	if he was blind drunk he may not remember... if not he might still want to get with you|`|b79g8mg4aa	If your relationship is still strong I would not worry. We all get drunk sometimes and hopefully he will understand. For me being a guy an apology and a good night (if you are at that level) would make up for one night of being drunk. If he does something similar forgive him and remind about the night when you were drunk and how it made him feel.|`|029d970e89f49628d1a27a4f7084f48faa	No. If he really likes you, he'll be glad he had the opportunity to take care of you in a time of need. Do yourself a favor and don't drink next time so you can show him how you really are when you're with him like that.|`|lgXSmCQRaa	No. He obviously isnt a guy with morals otherwise he wouldnt have done stuff to you while you were drunk (im not implying that you were molested in any way). Anyway guys love to see girls in their night clothes. Just be normal around him.|`|8A6A7UjLaa	if i was the a guy i wouldn't care, i would only care about the sexual things i done
Tledw3eAaa	It's different for every girl, so while some might like it long, others will prefer it short. Personally, I like a little length. My brothers was nearly to his shoulders, and I wanted to cry when he got it cut a few weeks ago, lol.     Same thing with a beard, it depends on the girl.    Grow your hair the way you like it. Hair can be cut at anytime, and if there are girls that wouldn't give you a chance just based on your hair alone, they probably aren't worth your time to begin with. The more important thing is that you are happy with it.|`|gXBPLitzaa	I like short.  But medium length looks good on some guys.  Depends on your face shape.|`|rfOFuGNNaa	Short|`|JbZInGg7aa	no facial hair!!!!! short hair is good.....maybe long,,,,i'd try short hair first!|`|0100846a42e702559413a87fbcc9a325aa	YES long hair is forever the most amazing thing ever. especially long black hair. rawr. haha. but that's just a 16 year old chicks opinion (my friends agree too)|`|s7OFsGeYaa	My boyfriend has short hair, and I love the way it feels, but I also have a weakness for guys with shoulder length hair. As long as it is well kept that is!     I think that it is a personal choice though. Have it however you feel comfortable with.|`|YRJEC46laa	Well personally i prefer long curyish hair i suppose it makes you look more manly idk i like it! :)
VbAfL0VUaa	Ice skating would be nice, you could talk which you couldnt in the movies and you can make each other laugh and relax by being silly on the ice. have fun and remember no matter what u do just enjoy each others company|`|B3VYy8sFaa	movies aren' always great because then you can't talk.    Ice skating, bowling, pool, all of those are fun and interactive.|`|YzqAPy59aa	I think ice skating and hot chocolate.  you'd get to know each other more|`|wcberxyfaa	take her to dinner and give her flower, that's my bf do
3y0w1qIBaa	Try flirting with her and see how she responds.  If she respond well, then ask her out.  Go along the lines of, "Would you like to go to the movies with me"?  If she said no due to the thinking that you are asking her out, then just reply "you know, just friends".  This is a perfect comeback to show that the girl may not like you that way.  I really wish you all well, man.|`|65653c6c063e99db1f7f272c5c93e006aa	Have you ever read "The Courtship of Miles Standish"?  His friend asked a girl out for him and the friend and his would be girl wound up getting married.    Are they going on the date with you?  Seriously, If you want to go out with her you need to ask her yourself.    I appreciate it when a guy asks me what my interests are and what I enjoy doing, like going to concerts, movies or where do you like to eat?  That lets me know he really wants me to have a good time.  It's hard to say no to that!|`|AA11298074	just ask her lol|`|9580a1e44dd3d2bae7d2f867611ab353aa	? Just flat out ask her if she would like to go out sometime.|`|Jpgz4mSVaa	just walk up and ask her...be a man dude.|`|qVRmpGlEaa	Don't get a friend to ask for you, man up.|`|e9sbXvCvaa	No don't get your friend to do it. You do it yourself. This is where your confidence is key! She may not take you seriosuly if you had to get your friend to do it.|`|dc5bTUtmaa	I really think you should ask her yourself|`|UEA4Uli9aa	Write her a poem!   Aha   Girls love confidence, so ask her yourself :)|`|50xeC77aaa	Definitley do NOT ask her over text or even the phone.  and do NOT ask one of your friends to ask her.  Girls (and i) hate when boys dont ask them out in person.  If you can't even ask her out yourself, what makes you think that you can talk on a date?|`|iKK89z2Eaa	buy her a flower and put a note on it asking, girls love stuff like that! good luck|`|EJxDQoNHaa	when you ask a girl out you absolutely have to do it in person.    confront her after school or at lunch and just spit it out.|`|G9iIrib6aa	I would ask her yourself, Girls like a guy who has confidence.|`|VLQXcPKfaa	Have you got a dog?  Well according to another guy, he prefers cuddling up to his dog, more than his child.  So I wouldn't bother, go hug a Labrador!|`|EOFQtzGGaa	Earmt say on him island Fudnad 4 you bring pretty girl baked trob and then say "let's for to build us a snow castle!"  I go to sleep now.|`|K3ovnoGDaa	to be more special do it urself. and im a girl so ill tell you the way i would like to be asked and how my bf now asked me and made me melt and fall head ova heels for him. so the way he asked me was cool, i was chillin wit a group of friends and i knew who he was and all so he walked up to me and was like so cutie u wanna go out and gave me a kiss. this was after we were talkin for a while tho. idk ur situation. if i was in this girls place tho i would deff appreciate it more if u did it urself and kinda of in a cute way ya kno =]. hopee dis helps and good luck!!|`|POHWTDPRaa	Never, never get a friend to ask someone out for you. If you can't do it yourself you obviously are not ready to date.     Just ask her like you are asking any other question. 'Would you like to see a movie on Friday?' for example. You're building it up to be bigger than it is. Just ask and get it over with.|`|ZzEAc5ecaa	do it your self that way you get the info from her not a friend .. good luck ..get her by her self . and then ask her ok mate|`|WcuYfsWbaa	tell her yourself its hard but the best|`|b2f05254ed10a5821d8b08c2f268ba89aa	you should definetly do it this time. having ur friends ask for u doesnt show confidence. but it doesnt have to be a huge show. ask her to hang out after school maybe get some food or go ice skating.
fVomJGmKaa	I think thats great.  I think you may want to observe how she acts  around you. If she does any physical contact  like maybe poke you or brush up against your   arm than she may like you. But I think she would  be lucky to be going out with you.|`|w6A7GSFAaa	Are you saying guys as in men or just slang?  I'll answer anyway, think  - does she giggle and look down a lot when she's near you?  - does she smile to you in the corridor or lessons?  - and does she get he friends to ask you about her?  If she does all that, yes, she likes you, a lot! She's probably just nervous and as a girl I'd know. Just find out from a friend maybe -- but i'll warn you! DON'T ASK HER BEST FRIEND UNLESS YOU WANT HER TO KNOW! BEST FRIENDS TELL EACH OTHER EEVERYTHING Ask the quiet one in the group, she'll probably have listen to conversations and know if she likes you. And she probably won't tell her if you ask her if she likes you.  x|`|AA11441704	Mr. 15...........she would say yes.|`|CnM2U1bXaa	If she didnt like you she probably wouldnt laugh at all of your jokes. I think that she probably does, just go for it.|`|Q328Ayxpaa	well sounds like you really like her.. you just got to ask her. by what you said(she laughs at your jokes, she listens to you) I say you have a good chance at it.|`|Ba4dBwWnaa	YOu sound like agreat person. She should be lucky to have someone as respectful and kind as you to like her. I think you should just tell her.|`|b79g8mg4aa	The only way to know is to ask her. I am 32 years old and if I knew then what I know now things would have been different. If she is laughing at your jokes and you really like her just ask her, man. If she says no then at least you will know where you stand.You are still young so do not get stuck on one girl. You will probably date many girls while in high school. Ask her in private so you do not embarrass her or yourself. One thing I have learned through the years is that the most beautiful girls are always single because guys are afraid to ask them out. So just do it. You have nothing to lose only gain. Hope this helps let me know!|`|51HWpN5Gaa	Well Guys should always make the first move, you seem real into her and you should not waste time hanging around great girls like her may get taken soon! Grab ur chance while you could x
IJJW2zPzaa	Hey buddy, fret not, woman are a difficult subject. I was never a big dater myself. I am 26 and have been happily married for a year. Before my wife, I went through a few long single stints, they're tough. Today, I have the woman of my dreams and couldn't be happier. Just give it some time and patience; being that you are young, time is on your side. An assertive attitude certainly helps. However, when rejected, you must have the intestinal fortitude to get right up and move on to the next. Keep taking good care of yourself, and good things will come.|`|HH56ptnNaa	its not bad but you could try asking more people out. you might be missing out on some experiences but if it doesnt bother you that much then who cares|`|bszyOuIqaa	You should be interested in yourself first. Just because you have everything together on the outside doesn't mean that someone should want to be with you. I look for guys with confidence, goals, drive, maturity, family oriented, etc. It's a bonus if he looks good and dresses well but it's not the only thing I look for.|`|aT9HYagEaa	You need to get out and meet people...stop talking about it and do something about it...take actions...go out and talk to girls...go out on more dates...ask friends to set you up with people...it cant hurt...hopefully you'll click with someone...and dont be hard on yourself in the process if it doesnt work out...its not going to work out with every girl...you will find some who are fun but there is no chemistry and you will find some where there will be chemistry but maybe something else wont work...you just have to wait for the right person...in the mean time just have fun! good luck!|`|wEEniEcFaa	Don't worry about what you're missing out on.  Just make a life you enjoy and you like, and you'll find you've created opportunities for yourself to meet the kind of people that like you.    Join a gym  Go to church and participate with their singles group (churches are the BEST place to meet NICE, SWEET girls)  Audition for a community theatre (you'll have your pick of women there! There are never lot's of guys in the community theatre.)  Throw parties at your house and invite your friends. (I don't encourage drinking when you're trying to meet good people...drunk girls = trouble)    After you've put yourself out there long enough, you'll find a girl that will want to be with you - I promise.  20 is so young, don't panic yet! :)|`|xDlBM6N6aa	Talk to me and I'll help you out if you need it...seems like you do.    Email or IM me sometime, I'm 19 btw.|`|DiQ0fIdlaa	It's ok that you have only dated once. I'm a girl( i just don't have a screen pic)...and i wouldn't want my boyfriend to have a bunch of girlfriends before me. I wouldn't really care though.   Not having a girlfriend or boyfriend yet don't mean your not boyfriend material. Just means the right one hasn't come along yet. And sometimes girls like it when there guy isn't to outgoing. when their more laid back and not pushy. Just keep searching for the right girl. You'll  meet her.|`|QA3uQciHaa	Just keep trying, someones bound to come along that you like, keep being a nice guy and taking care ofyourselff ;)|`|SobKdxTaaa	well it is not your fault you are shy but if you go on a dating website  and find some one that is like you!!|`|sq6nIm70aa	it's 'cause you're shy.    i recommend goign out and doing things you wouln't usually do.    play a game with yourself, where you try to be the least shy person. it doesn't matter, because you don't know any of these people.    i recommend being more confident.
eO4y3m1maa	That sucks, but revenge is silly...just let it go.|`|LykjWv6faa	Revenge will come back to bite you in the *** later. Be the better person and let  him go.|`|bAmpR3Exaa	flirt with his best friend ...|`|VJZ8KXSjaa	The best revenge is to live well and strive without him. Believe me, He did you a favor by dumping you, you don't need that type of person in your life giving you this BS. Move on, that'll get to him. Good luck|`|b2f05254ed10a5821d8b08c2f268ba89aa	act like u dont care. success is the BEST revenge|`|VbAfL0VUaa	By taking revenge you are wasting time, effort and energy on someone who doesn't even respect you enough to tell you to your face. Take this as a lesson learnt, don't let him do this to you again. Take the high road! When he can't down hold a relationship due to his own immaturity he will have served his own revenge.

If it just started then you don't want to overdo it by saying it every time you leave eachother or hang up the phone or every ten mins when your together. When he/she does something cute that you like you should say something like aw I love you or see this is why I love you. Try to slip it in to meaningful things that they do, then eventually after a while it will be said everytime you part or get off the phone and it won't mean as much then unfortunatly lol|`|Yl0ehKj1aa	If i dont tell my man everyday its every other day...me and him been together for almost 9 yrs n we still tell each other. I try to show him everyday tho...even if its somethin little that i do for him|`|eQPy6KP2aa	When he leaves, when he comes home, when we go to bed, I guess all the time :D|`|rCNRcF5waa	I tell my husband everyday.

You can never say 'I love you' too much. Showing your love is easy- just be there for them and help in whatever way you can if the need arises.|`|72MZ0EG7aa	I tell my boyfriend more than once a day that i love him  and he tells me sometimes more than I do in one day.  I show him I love him everyday.I do all kinds of stuff that he appreciates such as cooking supper for him,  watching hockey with him,making his lunch for work,  running him a bath,giving him a massage,writing him poetry,going fo rwalks and dinner and movies.we do alot of stuff together that includes on making eachother happy.We make love when the moment is set and feel the intimacy happening.Sometimes we role play and yeah that enough for you to know why u ask lol?! need help?|`|6edczUEBaa	My husband and I have been together for 6 years and married for almost 5 and we tell each other several times a day I love you. There has not been a day that has gone by in our relationship that we have not told each other I love you at least 4 times a day. We don't have to show each other we love each other because we already know. If you have to show or prove to someone you love them then I don't think it's really love. I mean we do nice things for each other every day but not to prove we love each other we do it because we want to|`|MuzqSYjwaa	My wife is always wanting to hear that I love her.  You should write little notes, and give her things you may think are lame or cheep.  I know this is something you wouldn't really care about, but she will.  Write I love you on some stickys and put them in places she will find.  After you'll get kisses (and more) without even knowing why.|`|0kQZKbCWaa	evry now and then we been together for 4 years ... but we still say it maybe evry other day lol not on purpose|`|eQURLO8Eaa	everyday! :)|`|dkVAH0OKaa	ok... you could tell them that you love them every time you feel the need to... and show? if your a guy, buy REALLY expensive gifts, and if your a girl, just accept the gifts and be happy.... guys shouldent care that much......|`|gpNkuxNIaa	give them a orgasm then say u love them & love making luv to them|`|dJAVfLHraa	I tell my boyfriend all the time. Like we ALWAYS like every nite we say goodnite & I love you to eachother.     Ummm I usually show him by hugging him, kissing him, sitting on his lap haha, giving him a back massage hahaha he loves them. We usually just sit together and hold hands and stuff otherwise.    Isn't that the same question twice?? Haha
6Mm3KV6iaa	if they really want you to fail then dont keep going at your own pace show them that they cant slow you down and that you can do better then what they think if you make a bad mark think of it as a step up for your pride and not an F or a D|`|a86TSv5Caa	it sounds like u only have about a half a year left of there crap. get out of the house as much as possible. and don't let them ruin your dreams.

0qm2raXBaa	Just let time pass.  Do not pick up any more of his phone calls or answers his text.  Just leave him be and most likely he will give up.
yktlEbZeaa	well that is still happening to me so i told the boy i thought h wasn't cute but that still didnt work so i went out with one of the boys that liked me to that i thought was cute. but sadly now i cant stand my current boyfriend|`|mCZZN9XEaa	Just say you dont like him like that.... if he doesnt back off, lie that you already have a boyfriend or like someone else!

If it bothers you or hurts you, I would advise speaking with a doctor.|`|scnW0Wzeaa	Yes you can lactate without being pregnant.|`|zRtOplYtaa	go 2 the doc|`|f5BWVpHNaa	Lol wow and your just maturing hun..its normal|`|kAwDxFeMaa	I have no idea, honestly, I can't find anything about that anywhwere online. Very strange. What kind of bodywash or soap do you use? It might be that....???|`|tLr2mADkaa	Jen like someone said it is best if you consult your doctor.    But from what I've found, it seems that it could possibly be a yeast or fungi infection, specially if you shower with anti-bacterial soap. Not all bacteria is bad and some do consume or keep fungi at bay from what I've read. Now the fact that you say it smells good, some fungi do, some even smell fruity. Also like someone pointed out, women don't necessarily need to be pregnant to lactate, a chemical imbalance can produce that, same as the one that scared you into thinking you where pregnant.    Also even though we don't see we all never stop sweating, normally it's microscopical sweat, yes even in the coldest of temperatures in the Antartic. So that can keep a good moisture supply for yeast. As I said consult your physician.    On the other hand some people recommend grapefruit seed extract or lemon normally diluted in water under the breast area. Some women have had good results with Vagisil, or Gold Bond Medicated Powder. If you can find a fungicide cream that doesn't need prescription it might also work. But as a recommendation before experimenting with medicines on your body, I would always recommend visiting a physician first, as to avoid any allergic reactions from the medicines, and remember that if a medicine ever gives you any allergic reactions or produces any undesirable symptoms to stop and talk to your physician. Best of luck :)
0mhcCyE5aa	A lot of parents do ; (    I am not one of them.  I only care that when my daughter is old enough to date, that she dates people who treat her right!!!    You should ask your boyfriend what he thinks his parents will think!|`|838VJJGvaa	Ask your parents to date.  As long as your are like 13 or older they really shouldn't care unless they have certain values.  Be yourself and be safe.|`|aXYiOskmaa	as a parent, it wouldn't bother me at all. i don't think my own folks would care either as long as he were a good man.|`|nDQOwAA3aa	mine wouldn't care but everybody is different|`|vgpuTBmSaa	you have the same nervousness any person of any race/sex/age/shape  has when 'meeting the parents' and if i am wrong and they are biased against you for such a ridiculous reason, tell them maybe their son will end up with a sniveler or a spoiled brat or a crackhead-as long as she is the proper tint and texture? cuz if they are like that, it's your job to TEACH THEM A LESSON!|`|QGsYPJoKaa	Well i'm multi-racial and so far i haven't had any racism, but as long as your polite, and kind, and a good person then they shouldn't, hopefully, find fault.|`|XzCDLKOdaa	Be yourself.|`|7ldEn0fJaa	if they are racist they will, but my parents would not care|`|BaMTO9PCaa	Well, look at it as a win-win situations. If they don't care you'll get in good with his parents. If they do care, you always have the satisfaction of calling them racist :P|`|M3CVx4N7aa	They shouldn't care. If they do, they're huge meanie-butts!  Can SOMEONE PLEASE answer my question?|`|dzbblpjgaa	If you are a decent person they will see that hopefully over your skin colour or background. Just be yourself, it is easy to try hard to impress but this just looks phoney and will show up if you behave differently later on. Go thinking you will enjoy yourself. I do not think your boyfriend would take you there if he thought they may not accept you. Good luck and big smile!|`|niSRQw53aa	I would not care if either of my daughters dated someone of a different race.  It's not the color of your skin that matters... it's the color of your HEART.  However, although their dad is half Asian, he doesn't like anyone who isn't white.  Which baffles me since he's only 1/2 white.  I have dated different races and luckily my daughters are color blind.  They see good in all people of all different races.  Also remember that most Caucasians are mixed as well.  I am very white skinned, but I am 1/4 Magyar, 1/4 German, 1/4 English, 1/4 Canadian.  So maybe your new friend is also mixed.      I am always afraid to meet families, because I usually date other races, so sometimes they are prejudiced against MY skin color.  We all  have different customs as well.  That is usually where the issues come into play.     My family was NOT okay with my now ex-hubby being part Asian.  Now my family realizes that I will be with who I want no matter what their skin color or religion.      Good luck and just show your true personality when you meet them and they should like you for YOU, not for having darker skin.  As a side note, my youngest daughter looks Mexican.  Neither her dad or myself have any Hispanic lineage.  Looks can be very deceiving.  There are whites from South Africa, blacks from England, etc.
demWmz6jaa	honestly my boyfriend did the same thing. it made me so mad. its just because he just overreacts.. he needs time to calm down cause he just talks out of anger. at the moment he doesnt want to be with you but then when he calms down he realizes he was overreacting. i dealt with it for 2 years and finally got out of it. you will stress out so much and honestly you deserve better but good luck =)|`|2NtogPH6aa	IF YOU REALLY ARE NOT HAPPY WITH HIM DUMP HIM!|`|8bba9018463ff663ab0b40d6fa68e081aa	This definetely is not a healthy relationship. In my opinion, you should leave him! Just remember: the only boy worth your tears will never make you cry!!!|`|AA10496780	He's not mature enough to be in a relationship. You deserve better.  Leave him alone, ignore him and move on. There are better people to be involved with. Life is too short. My grandma always said "don't let you feet get stuck to the kitchen floor".|`|scnW0Wzeaa	Dump him for good. move on he is retarded. If you stay with him you are retarded too.|`|a8DeELCKaa	I think you should dump him.  It's not fair that he does this to you and he isn't worth it.  Find someone who cared enough about you to not dump you on a whim just because he feels like it.|`|ckjZnqHRaa	...I went out with a gal like this once....later I found out she was OC and ADD and bi-polar and manic...all in one package really.............YIKES!!!  She was fabulous in the sack though...it was like being with a new woman evry week!........
jbTNER3caa	I completely understand.  My last boyfriend seemed really sweet, nice, and innocent when we met.  But he was literally lying to me from day one that we started dating.  As you said, he would lie about everything.  Even lying about where he ate lunch: saying he ate at McDonald's when he really ate at Burger King.  Like, really stupid things, but also really important things too, like who he was talking to/seeing and stuff.  I, again like you, gave him way more chances than I should have.  Stayed with him for 2 years...  And the conclusion I've come to as to the reason he kept doing it, cheating and lying and treating me like crap, was because I let him.  I would say "This is the last time.  Next time I'm gone!"  But next time would come and go and I would just say the same things over and over.  He did the whole he'd lie, so I would get mad/we'd fight, then he would blame the fight on me because I 'started it' even though he was the one that caused the problem.      I broke up with him after 2 years of lies and being cheated on by him with over 15 different girls (he'll only admit to the 15, but I know of more).  That was almost three months ago, and I have found a new guy who is amazing.  He treats me so differently than my ex.  And I actually trust him, which is something I thought would never happen with another guy!    Cut your losses and move on... It's really hard, believe me I know.  But I also can promise you that it will eventually get better.  Do not sell yourself short by being with someone who isn't worth your time and makes your life crappy.  Sorry my answer was long.  Hope I helped.  : )|`|wEEniEcFaa	It's funny, you keep saying that you are sweet and honest and an all around nice guy...but you sound manipulative to me...    I mean - I'm sure you are nice, but geez - let this girl go if you don't like her or respect her.  It seems like you are keeping her around to have someone to preach to instead of love.    I would say cut your losses.
aczYezdDaa	communication and privacy are a must, remember that. Do not be RUDE!If you don't feel any sorrow that's fine but remember to at least be polite, girls can have their dignity hurt as well.Then you break up with her.Say the truth, explain the real reason why you want to break up.And if she asks if "she did anything wrong" after the fact that you just explained to her why then you're allowed to get up and say good-bye, because that either means that she has low self-esteem or that she's stalling to keep you there.Staying longer than you should is a NO!NO! It can cause problems that you both don't need.So do what you have to do and give me an update.                                   Sincerely,                                       Lamestown7028  p.s.-Avoid all gossip or questions from your friends or others,the less you say the less interesting it will seem. Hence forth causing the "OMG' period to end faster.And if she starts talking smack about you that's fine because you know that you let her down easy and nicely..And don't give her the "lets be friends" line(trust me) instead go for I'll see you later.At least you can promise that,let her cope then see if you guys are compatible as friends.  p.p.s-About your ex...if she  is showing signs of interest then go for it.If not...Too bad.;)|`|0XvImpdFaa	say ur pretty but i think dat im not for you!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|A7ovwP94aa	Tell her you both need to talk and explain that you think you may have rushed into having a relationship with her.    Just explain to her although she is great, you just want to be single for the moment to sort your head out.|`|oU7W59mYaa	just tell her that you dont think your ready for another girlfriend right now cause you still have feelings for your ex. but whatever you do do NOT break up with her over msn or email!

I knew it when we were past the "honeymoon phase" and he made me mad or upset. The fact that i still loved him and cared for him and that we could communicate through the ups and downs is how i knew.|`|2jp6Lyr3aa	Still don't...|`|c469ba36a3fa17c5d47c039c3340dcb4aa	We dated for about 6 mo. I had to know he liked kids, shared my values, and was headed down the same life path I was.  I came out of a BAD marriage and wanted nothing to do with any man that was the same as I had married previously. It helped that he and I had several things in common past and present, that he was understanding and he liked home cooking-can't date me w/o liking that. We liked fishing, camping, outdoors, no football or other sports, are about the same age, and had similar values, but very different up-bringings.  We meshed.  By the way, when I said dated, I didn't mean sleeping together early on either.  That waited and believe me it was very worth the wait.   He is a thinker, me a talker on some things it helps to have different likes and dislikes, but most of all we both are homebodies. If you don't want to rush to find the right one, don't.  I also had a list of extremely important traits and actions he could possess which would fit with me.  Sometimes that makes it seem like shopping, rather than getting to know someone, but after being beaten and abused, I had to raise my standards.  If he didn't have some that weren't as important as the top 2-no hitting and running around-I felt I could drop a few, because no one is perfect.  Good luck|`|O2xwMwHYaa	i knew when a few things happened: when every time i was doing something without him (fun or not), i knew his presence would always make it more awesome. and every time we get in an argument, i NEVER wish he would leave. maybe we go to separate corners and cool down, but i never want him to leave. and lastly, when we can spend time together as best friends and not always lovers. that flame will dim sometimes but you gotta have that friendship base.   good luck!|`|UIwlfUKCaa	After years of living together as a married couple person gets use to each other, and start depending on each other for small things, and this becomes our habit and when one is away for work they miss each other and this is called love. In all marriage SEX plays a very important role, sex is a prerequisite. And after all of this years living and doing things together married people gets divorce.
WBanIZmpaa	your in love and you should just accept the feeling and go with it.|`|NWssZ2qGaa	It's called love.
y46ZQItQaa	Of course it will bother people .    If you liked him when you went out with him , and you see pictures of him making out with other girls , your mind just registers now that " wow , hes not mine anymore "  If you didnt like him when you went ut with him , sounds like an obssession to not let hi have anyone else .|`|oadV46kYaa	yes it is. i still get bothered when i see pics of him with other girls and even hanging out with other girls. you may be over him, but there is still that connection. especially if you fell in love with that guy, it's kinda hard to picture him with other ppl.
T0i2iB22aa	You can either let her know you only want to be her friend or have you two hang out in a group setting.  That would make things seem less that you want her as your girlfriend.  Just start talking and hanging out will come.
6VCdRmp1aa	myself personally not looks, but personality chemistry, for me i like someone after i get to know her a bit if i feel like i really click with a particular girl and she does with me chemistry wise thats what i look for|`|eaFjiX6Daa	...but you have a boyfriend already! LoL  Sorry I know I'm not a boy.....|`|53aUYsqtaa	her smile! her cutness! her love caring. her smile. her nose. her eyes!
9580a1e44dd3d2bae7d2f867611ab353aa	? I think saying "lets hang out sometime" was perfectly fine. Give him a few days, maybe he has a lot on his mind right now.|`|ZRRvnYMsaa	yeah it prob was a good move butg you might still have chances with him think about what might be wrong someone might have died (gone to a funeral) ect just ask him again if he wants to hang with you somethime|`|f5BWVpHNaa	k...well its a possibility you do have a chance and then again you don't want to get hurt guys are a mystery...and he like another girl so you need to also watch that sweetie...and asking him to the movies...theres nothing wrong with that...hopefully you guys might have a connection...    tell me how it went  dont be afraid to contact me @  collegegirlnc91@hotmail.com|`|fGVNH64uaa	just chill. u did fine and if he wants you he'll make sure he calls u or will mention hanging out again. dont over analyze boys are simple and they just do as they please, so you should too. there's nothing more u can do.|`|TMi1GhSHaa	wow.. well you just said that he is in love with another girl who also likes him back.. and then there is you who hes just friends with.. he may just see you as friends I mean if he didnt im sure there would be ALOT more flirting and calling or texting then there is going on.. he would of been the one to suggest you should hang out sometime with him.. instead of the other way around.. ya... definitly dont put your all into this guy.. hes likes another girl.. i know its hard but i mean seriously.. I guess you still have a chance seeing as hes not dating the girl or married to her lol.. his feelings CAN change but that would take alot of waiting around and broken hearts on your part.. if you think you can handle that then keep doing what your doing.. if not then move on.|`|tOoJL7sYaa	he's in love with someone.  he seemed kinda hesitant, i dont know.....i wouldn't, even though i know it's hard....|`|koA4n8Tzaa	try to bring up a topic that will get him saying more than hi        answer my youtube one please someone|`|pgfgzz5Jaa	well he might have a lil crush on you but if it came down to it he would choose the other girl so dont bother with him
xDlBM6N6aa	I have brown hair and blue eyes too! I'm 5'8 and any guy taller than me is good in my book.  You sound really attractive and like someone I'd go for, but I dont like tattoo's.  Um, a few is ok, but not everywhere.  Just depends on where they are...
BHivSc0Baa	Nothing wrong with it. Thats not too much of an age diffrence. My moms friend is 50 year old woman and shes married to a 22 year old man. Now thats just wrong. But your age diffrence isnt too great. So I would advice you to go for it. See what he thinks. Right now im trying to date a gal thats 2 years younger than me. Dont worry. Go for it!!|`|420b488758fd919f03fd6da33dbabf9baa	yea hes legal lol|`|HYnBeyJsaa	Of course it's not wrong to have a guy friend that you can have fun with at the age of 19. Infact before i met my girlfriend, I used to hang out with her sister and we used to hang out and have fun all the time ( coincidentally it just so happens that she's 24 and I'm 19 )|`|QzyUTwq8aa	nah it happens all the time.|`|YiGSPWHRaa	I say hell ya, go for it.....if you arent having sex, what can it hurt?  If I was that young again, I'd go for it!|`|rgX3fhjlaa	He will be fiery on you and sex is fun anyway|`|JuXb4u4gaa	i dont see anything wrong with it. everyone has needs|`|NK9EA2QKaa	i would say no because you know you dont like the guy but he might think you do and when you tell him he could get hurt and not talk to you.
816a529472c281fde7589965fb89d094aa	i make triple what my husband makes but i love what he contributes to our relationship (FOOD). he's a chef/cook and we both contribute in whatever way we can in the relationship.     It depends on how you see yourself and the role money, status, etc has in your life and future|`|AA11100500	You seem shallow... Atleast he was tryng to work! Just because you make triple what he makes doesn't mean he's under your standards...
jbTNER3caa	It sounds like he either really does like both of you.  So he doesn't want to chose between you, because then he'd hurt his girlfriend.  Or that he really isn't that into you.  He might like you, but he probably likes his girlfriend more.  Besides, you don't want to be with a guy that would break up with his girlfriend to be with you, because who's to say he wouldn't do the exact same thing to you when you're his girlfriend.  I would leave it alone and try to find someone else for now.  Maybe later on down the road when both of you are single, it'll work out...
b538976641cc2a50041772f307796f66aa	The best way is to listen. And even sometimes repeat back what she has said. Tell you you think she is really special and prove it by listening.
hwIMJBVpaa	that actually did happen to me! i just said hey thanks for that, i feel special and all but im not a lesbian.|`|YmLezz03aa	i would have fog on my goggles and fog in my pants|`|0gdBjXb1aa	i kissed a girl and i liked it?

I don't bat for that team.|`|f5oZRD6faa	vvvvvv ENDLOVE??????    sorry haha yeah id just stand there until they stopped then probably go bright red=)|`|gBnOqY5Yaa	describe the girl. that would greatly influence my answer.  is she a grandma with flabby arms, or a young asian girl or what?|`|6TVl5nTBaa	i have no idea. I think I would be so freaked out that it happened because I did not see it coming.|`|2wabQow8aa	I would be shocked but if I thought she was good looking then I would just go with it.|`|y9wE6Qm5aa	"I KISSED A GIRL AND LIKED IT , THE TASTE OF HER CHERRY CHAPSTIK, I KISSED A GIRL JUST TO TRY IT HOPE MY BOYFRIEND DONT MINDIN, IT FELT TO WRONG, IT FELT SO RIGHT, DONT MEAN A ENDLOVE 2NIGHT, I KISSED A GIRL AND I LIKED IT" lol HAD TO DAY IT|`|s5Tg2M4paa	im not gay so.....i did push her off
J30kfJpQaa	Having sex on your mind 24/7 doesn't mean you're mature. He will know you like him if you tell him. Do it or don't. It's your life.|`|gWleYSuIaa	I think it is your friend's boy friend that likes you.  Sounds like the immature behavior of a guy that age.|`|qeVfPBGOaa	hes told him already|`|36PrVK7Oaa	The sign will be that he avoids you.|`|UeCgFgucaa	let him to know you like another one|`|d08rkYlpaa	talk to the guy you like first. Even if it turns out he doesn't like you so much, it's better than having this dilemma hanging over your head, making you crazy.|`|eAyC1mRZaa	just tell him urself
cp2182xNaa	Sorry to say it...but yeah he might be. A woman's intuition is pretty good generally. Follow your gut.
SaTfE6TEaa	*Looks around Puzzled*|`|oBk1bD1yaa	what?|`|gCiJpRfwaa	Email her...she probably won't see this question
yS5f1XLFaa	does it have 2 b an aim..... cuz i dont have 1. i have a yim and its on my profile if u wanna chat. or u could email me, watever i dont really care which 1.
jXPQcrn3aa	People overuse that phrase....it could mean several different things....or it could just possibly mean....that she doesn't want a relationship now....for whatever reason....if you like her....hang out as friends and see what happens.....good luck!!!|`|H0HPx0kwaa	If she says she likes you but isn't ready for a relationship maybe she's not sure you like her. If not, she's just has a lot going on and truly isn't ready.
utQC6dhjaa	it depends.   smile and say hi    or if shes browsing around the store   make a comment like that would look nice on you    just be cool not creepy|`|Kp6JYaMAaa	"hi, my name is ____"|`|oBk1bD1yaa	go say hi.. or hey, and introduce yourself. they'll listen if there interested|`|eSDNSq4zaa	say hey i think ur really pretty can i get ur number?|`|TTfkI4Zqaa	it starts with a smile, then you say........................hi..=)|`|sKmpVHZZaa	just say hiya...fancy bumping in to u..or buying something nice...wana get lunch :p|`|H0HPx0kwaa	Hi usually works to start.|`|fe2879005f528660584d6c591d71e1e9aa	jus say hi and be friendly...make some topic datz interesting|`|B66Jeq6Baa	open with a compliment..  but not something creepy/cheesy/untrue.  be genuine, polite, and smile!  good luck :)
8vfCRg7Caa	trust me, "im interested in you", says "im easy, and this is going to be easier than you thought it would be". DO NOT DO THAT. that will totally blow your cover. Dont even do it. Please.     If they are texting you back n forth. Its pretty easy. Just be yourself and funny. Women think guys are dumb, and sometimes we can be, but if hes texting you, you are obviously are in the picture. The most important thing is listen. Alot of people just sit there and ramble off about this and that. And then when you ask them their opinion on something, they cant even recall accurately what you said. Also, show you have a brain of your own and an opinion of your own. Agreeing with everything somebody says is old. Nobody likes an *** kisser. Don't play to hard to get or in this day in age in dating, you wont be got.    Say what you mean and mean what you say, and dont ask questions you dont need to know the answer too. ie "what was your last girlfriend like". Who gives a rats *** about that? The reason why alot of women think guys are dumb is cause we are simple. Keep it simple. Dont go overboard.|`|6TVl5nTBaa	tell him he looks a lot like your one of your friends.|`|UgcPxd4maa	why would you want to flirt with someoe you've never met and only text? he could be some weirdo old guy thats a perv!|`|TMi1GhSHaa	ugh.. dont waste your time.. i was doing that a few days ago lol dont ask why but its wierd not seeing them face to face and you dont know if what there saying is true... ya.. dont waste your time.. meet him in person or find another guy.|`|fnhpfvARaa	maybe try meeting him, if possible.|`|0b3add3c992d7c8a05765bad789f6f6eaa	ask him his sign|`|MfUMaKcDaa	don't try to be flirty, let it come naturally. if you work on it too much and rehearse it allot, he will be able to tell, and you'll look cheap.
e28P8gWraa	Dude sorry to say this, But shes just not all that into you. You did the right thing, but sounds like you shoulda done it a long time before. Remember, the girl should be asking when you two are gonna hang out, not the other way around.|`|YfwTblzKaa	It might not have been the best text to send but at least she knows how your feeling and hopefully she can figure out what she wants. Just wait for her to reply before talking to her again. Hope it all works out|`|19TIPpaBaa	Just keep talking to her and act as if nothing happen and wait for her response
i6WVPncnaa	Those are clear signs that she likes you.  If you want to ask her out, you should take her to a quiet place and tell her if you can have her number and if she wants to go out with you.  Good luck.
RfElwieYaa	Carry out a reconnaissance mission to find out occasions on which he is alone (I think he would be alone while entering & leaving school). When you see that coast is clear, approach from behind as if you are entering/leaving school just like him. If he is right-handed, approach from right & brush your left hand with his right & vice-versa. Say Hi & start talking on normal topics. After both of you have started talking fluently ask him if he has gf. If he says no then say things like: 1. "Amazing! Someone as handsome (DON'T say hot) as you are single"  2. "All girls around you must be lesbians, otherwise they would flock around you" blah blah.  If he says he has gf then bug out normally without showing much disgust. We will develop a new strategy if he has gf. Good luck.|`|smyhq0Ggaa	Erm... yeah ask him :)|`|UfWYWoOkaa	just talk to eachother like friends and dnt worry about da love part you will just realize it one day|`|DaPRYi99aa	Ok I Don't have an answer but I love your name! Its the same as mine! :)
cb10953b2f0dad5e0861aa07228435e5aa	haha well, you should make up a nickname for her. something that only you call her and that has something to do with either your relationship or her personality. a friend of mine, his girlfriend called him lucky. It was cute, and he liked it. That's my advice. sorry if you don't like it.|`|lc2WYfeTaa	Um..you could try hunnie,sweetie,beautiful,Princess,pumpki... For example I call my husband muffin and he calls me baby-girl it's always been that way but it's not an everyday a billion times a day kind of thing because that gets old really quick!!|`|kLslWQR8aa	What about sweet things like honey or cupcake.|`|nayy4x3Xaa	.:buttmunch:.|`|42IzT0Viaa	Honey, sweetheart, darling, something that correspond to the way that she acts that is slightly negative but mostly just teasing.    ex.  Girl tends to be snotty.  call her Princess.    Girl is excessively silly and or airheaded.  Go with "Ditz" or "goof"
KFjEkOlPaa	give him a BJ. It's what I would want at 17.     Let the flames begin!     No, but seriously. Make something. it will make his life. A scrapbook or something.     OR. buy a snare drum like a Pulse Pro. A wood one with a wrap. Disassemble the drum completely. Take the lugs off. Carefully peel off the colored wrap, it should be attached in one place with a strip of double sided tape. Now you have a bare wood shell with some holes in it for the hardware. Prime, paint, glitter, draw, decorate, glue stuff on, whatever to the shell. Re-assemble the snare drum.     Custom snare drum! He'll explode with delight.     I made one for my girlfriend with pictures of us all over it. Then I clear coated over the pictures with polyurethane. Looks like a professionally made drum.|`|6EP71A7Baa	Write him a song. It doesn't have to be about love, you can make it about how fun he is to be around or whatever.|`|sbCvAy11aa	your connection to eachother is way too freakishly the same as mine haha.   take a road trip to somewhere kinda close but cool that has fun stuff to do that wont be so couple like like an amusment park.
NOWPlaUXaa	There's probably nothing wrong with it, depending on the type of porn I suppose.... as long as it's LEGAL, then there's really no harm.  You probably just have a high sex drive and it's exciting to see that stuff, so I can understand.  Don't feel dirty for it.. LOTS of people do look at porn, even if they don't admit it...    OMG UR A NORMAL HUMAN BEING! :)  Don't stress about it sweetie.|`|X40Ww89qaa	no|`|nDQOwAA3aa	yeah just about everybody watches porn no big deal|`|hgyiS7Glaa	i did when i was 16|`|5fdgfNCRaa	Depends who you ask. I'm a 20 year old girl and I don't, but some people do. Don't worry about what is normal or not - there are people like you and people unlike you. If looking at porn - or doing anything else for that matter - isn't an obsession and isn't causing problems, then go ahead. No harm done.|`|yzOtKTJIaa	yup, guys do it so why not girls|`|W0XoDxJraa	You're curious is all. It's better you do this rather than satisfy this curiosity with a man (which you may not be ready for)... and also prevents pregnancy and std's.  It;s good to educate yourself.|`|sNSnXzqfaa	nope. Not at all. A person looking at porn under that age is not normal.|`|YZez6mheaa	NO! Porn is for sleazy grows sex addicted people!|`|Q8CS0x0Kaa	Yes, I think it's perfectly normal.|`|Kj02Sqseaa	Of course, while it may not be a "good thing to do", no one here can deny that they haven't looked at porn whether it be once, twice or still look at it.    Just be careful to not become "addicted with it" and finally to give you a straightforward answer:  Yes it is normal and not uncommon for 16 year olds to do such things.|`|P38ULZbraa	Yeah, why not? I used to. The human body is art work and should be displayed... haha.|`|UEA4Uli9aa	Damn strait it's normal.   I'm almost 18. I've been watching since I was like 14-15   But I've moved on to like bondage and hxc stuff.     It's completly normal, and sometimes guys like to watch stuff with girls. ;)|`|uNplLsZqaa	I would say yes and no, the reason is because SO much teens -18 watch porn and a lot that don't. I guess when you need to masturbate to something it is easier to get an orgasm while watching something that will ''Turn you on''. And also I guess it can be educational too. But some porn videos display Bondage play and other let say, playful games.|`|E6N7r7Z7aa	its normal and its okay as long as it doesn't become a daily thing  and its satisfying ur hoariness, instead of getting knocked up and re grating it|`|yOWhoQBMaa	Personally, I don't think so.....  The question is why do you do it...?|`|M7gf7Xoiaa	Yep, completely normal. girls are just afraid to admit it.|`|2rq2v8weaa	Totally!|`|sq6nIm70aa	it totally is.    all these people saying no are idiots.    srsly don't worry.|`|hXYbBZ4Taa	lol, in fact, you're at a suitable age to watch porn.  Plus you're a girl, so as far as i know and i've heard girls matture much quicklier than boys..And I watch porn and i'm 15:)|`|t5bF9MFEaa	perfectly normal|`|B8Exjv8gaa	yes|`|InlzyWkZaa	It's normal.
iT0Z2icCaa	honesty first kindness then everything positive that comes with those two would be considered bonuses without the first two any relationship / friendship , are very likely to flounder in the sea of life .|`|GaouUtGTaa	? honesty and kindness ?
TTfkI4Zqaa	o of course, my boyfriend and i do it all the time. it is really fun. especially since he is the first boyfriend i have ever had that could overpower me. it gets attractive sometimes. but it is really fun.
bf3c4fe8c55434d5a5b7239682a2952caa	try getting your friends to invite him along to a day out or something along those lines.  try a group thing first to see if you still think he's perfect.|`|wpqJr2FMaa	Socialize!  If he's as you say, just say   "Hey, what's up!"  And he will respond in a friendly manner, and maybe even start up a conversation.

0SEYMBKDaa	If you're dating someone it's no big deal to ask them to an event. Just ask if he's busy then. If not, ask if he'd like to go.|`|0fVtHNtmaa	Why do you need a cute way? Just ask him.|`|3enJVNDdaa	don't ask...tell
QAGaQUDRaa	Kissypoo?? Yuck.    Sorry.    I don't know, I like baby and sweetie. Tell him he always knows how to make you smile. That will make feel good.|`|96jsEQ3Zaa	honey butter, Poochy Bear, Fuzzy Wuzzy,|`|tsdHndRhaa	pooper scooper, einy weiny man, short knub or small wonder.|`|keEfXfg8aa	aha my name is Coressa......lol similar.|`|6febee8b4757d9cd4857176f7b29c818aa	I don't like the word "kissypoo". I like these cute names: "Sweetheart", "Baby", "BUU".|`|99bd966c7128c1d9a029f3a0e433e089aa	Well let me start off by saying that I think "kissypoo" is a terrible pet name. I'm not trying to talk down to you, but it would seriously embarass MOST guys to be called that but then again there are some guys who would probably put up with it.    But yeah I'm going to keep it real with you, I'm a guy so I can personally say that petnames at times can be embarassing & annoying, but then there are some that are better than others. For example, my ex used to call me "Bello" & I liked it a lot. It means gorgeous in Spanish. I always think that the petnames that are more unique but also sound kinda regular are the best ones. I was just using mine as an example, I'm sure you can think something up if you don't like it.    -Peace
xAD64BkAaa	write it on his car... if he has one.   like that spray pait stuff, with balloons and what not. thats always cute.
W2pU2g9Eaa	She probably us just stopping herself from making a wrong decision. She likes you but she is in a commited relationship and itsoubds like she respects her bf. You should respect the fact that she does not want to put herself in that situation. Wait until she is single!|`|scnW0Wzeaa	If she leaves her bf because of you . She will leave you or cheat on you. Move on|`|f4c627930425c195d32f7d5a1017131aaa	Let her be. She told you she has a boyfriend and feels guilty hanging out with you. Back off, and when she dumps her boyfriend - be there for her.|`|soKNqDd3aa	Put a baked potato in your pants,  the FRONT of your pants that is, not the back.
TTfkI4Zqaa	that was all his fault, he should not have done that to you. and if he is willing to treat you like this then he is not worth it. you were right to call him that, what were you supposed to do? say "thanks for that, i completely knew that it was a joke". NO. he put you through nearly 2 hours of pain, and he got mad at you for that?!  what an *** hole. sorry.   but he is. that is way out of line of him. and he should know that.|`|1C0Tm9ipaa	Ok I'm confused, is Lewis your boyfriend?
8V1loJ6daa	It isn't your fault, you were mad and thats okay. People say things when they are mad and it's not like he wouldn't do the same thing. You don't need to worry about it no matter what anyone says it is HIS fault.|`|3HhhHWd4aa	You are at fault here.
7LjzmNzRaa	DUMP HIS AS* you dont deserve that sh*t why the hel* didnt you kick the bitc*es as*? you need to end it with him if he is gonna treat you like that just forget him hes prob cheating anyway im sry but good luck (:|`|5vT3UDYaaa	Are you serious? Why would you even have to ask what to do. YES BREAK UP WITH HIM. He's obviously playing games and shouldn't be your boyfriend. Get him back by kickin it with some other really hot guy at school and totally blow him off, dont even look at him in the halls. Keep your head high and put a little smart *** smile on your face, even stuck up like, cuz' that will show he didnt in fact hurt you and your way better then his grimy ***. :) Hes not worth your tears, find a better guy.|`|hR7fJ9y4aa	Dude, you should break up with the idiot. He's really stupid, and you don't deserve that. Him reacting like that shows that he was guilty of doing something. He doesn't deserve you. You need get out of this relationship as soon as possible. :)|`|2aUmGOSsaa	Kick him to the curb girl....|`|VDXu7Xedaa	u did nothing wrong so you should brake up with him|`|AA11852242	you are either smart or dumb. a smart person would hold their head up high dont cry and leave him alone for good. hes no good for you. when you see him just smile and keep going. hes just another peice of meat...............DOG. if youre dumb then youll run behind him begging for his attention and fake love and make a complete fool of yourself... think|`|0XvImpdFaa	BREAK UP WIT DAT *****!!|`|AA10531094	Maybe you're the only one who thinks you're in a relationship because that's not the way a boyfriend should act.  Cut your losses and move on. From what you say they're wasn't anything to lose.  You can't lose what you never had.  Good Luck!|`|JZUn4y6Gaa	Wow! He sounds like a jerk. Do you really have to ask what to do?|`|rev4lrn0aa	It's simple - break up with him. It doesn't sound like he really cares about you.     Sorry =(
AA10034000	eventually it will depleat. I know the feeling. I HATE my x with a passion and not a good passion either. He has made my life He*L*L for to many years now...sucks.! just put urself in a happy place and think of something else.........you can do it.   :)|`|zQheOHReaa	yeah, you will. maybe right now it seems like you'll never stop hating him, but once you occupy your time with something more interesting, you will move on.|`|6CEDkaQvaa	It helped me to realize that by hating him I was not doing any harm to him but to myself as I was becoming bitter about everything else.|`|yMRY5cgxaa	It should dimminish over time but! if you have a lot of contact with him then it could go on and on for a long time. I know one woman who has made it her mission to make her ex's life miserable for 12 years. She is catholic and won't devorce him even though she is with another guy.|`|21cf999bfe54057972e1de48b7cd2cf3aa	Yes, eventually you will hate the person you are dating now.
Yjs2x29taa	He must! He seems to be interested!    Why don't you flirt a bit and see what happens?    :]|`|AB3D5gIJaa	ask one of your best friends to ask him and then if he does then ask him out if you think it's the right thing to do.|`|3y0w1qIBaa	Yes, he likes you, but you seem to be a little bit young to date.|`|ZzEAc5ecaa	yes he likes you .|`|9580a1e44dd3d2bae7d2f867611ab353aa	? Yes I think he does..|`|OFPaqKDvaa	Yes it looks like he really likes you, buy in my opnion you are too young to date, but you can if you want to! :D|`|cWfTvJTcaa	Could be. Either way, you've got yourself a friend.|`|5bqw2APsaa	I love these questions. The way you guys say these kind of questions is so biased.|`|S0f1au1kaa	yes this guy is so into you. but if your still not sure just ask him.good luck.    hope this helps!|`|oqjsN2pPaa	well,  maybe. but i think you should kind of show that your interested.  then he might make it clearer that he likes you. (:|`|UThG15FLaa	In my own opinion -  I would definitely say, he has some attraction towards you ;].  You seem to describe him as a gentlemen towards you ..    Maybe you 2 should hangout together, sometime soon. (Lunch, etc). Also maybe talk to him, tell him your feelings when you feel it's right.    Gd luck.  ? dee|`|6zzte15caa	Sweetie of course he likes you, seems like a sweet guy.  Hopefully he'll treat you right.  Your lucky.  Start talking to him more, make sure you make time for him, start flirting with him... Smiling and giggling and ****.      HE LIKES YOU!|`|HOfvrus1aa	well at your age and his you guys dont really know how to properly show aor tell someone you like them i think you should just see what happens and live your life like normal you have alot of time to see what happens|`|0kbA9SIraa	well i guess he does  to gain loads of points try complimenting him  saying u have cute eyes. he might deny it then just say to him u do  and stuff lyk dat  soz if it dont help  loads of gurls do that to me and i like them they think the same    good luck!!
lsFcvd32aa	By looking at her from across the room, smiling, poking fun (in a funny/cute way), complimenting her, spending time alone with her, impressing her, etc...|`|sV2GO85Xaa	ok, look up "awkward" in the dictionary|`|9dc7211c44c17097c672d814b9900b0faa	are you kidding? girls are way harder to read|`|tAmFjEflaa	well... i flirt by occasionally mocking my gf, or teasing her a bit, but sometimes the casual arm around the waist/shoulder thing can count too.|`|XzXqsU86aa	generally us guys flirt in the following ways:    -talk to u alot  -compliment you  -sit at your table during lunch  -ask if you have a boyfriend  -touch you when we talk to you  -try to hold your hand  -try to be your partner on projects  -pretend to NOT like you  -if you ask to borrow something we'll tease you for it  -try to showoff in front of you  -say hi introduce ourselves the walk away  -help you up pick up your books if you drop them in the hallway  -have a friend ask if you like them  the list goes on and on    also just because a boy DOESNT flirt with you doesnt mean he doesnt like you. some of us guys are just really shy
6TVl5nTBaa	ya you are a cutie|`|GyFwkIbEaa	ya!!!!!!!!!!!! your so pretty! i would never even go close to saying your ugly! your georous! ya i think alot of guys would go out with you! just dont be a player lol! jk! well no acctually ya dont be a player! ik the guyys at my school would be all over you! how old are you?|`|gCiJpRfwaa	You're attractive, be more confident.  You look a year or two younger than me, so I wouldn't go out with you, but I'm sure plenty of guys would want to.|`|YWdNTZU3aa	yes  your really cute  but you seem young|`|ERHmYR88aa	i would...but i'd want to know u beter....|`|73aedf6956177f6e8f227d44da611c98aa	Ok, What are you covering up with the cat? LOL Yes they would.
UzGu9BD6aa	well yea if u really like her and she does 2 u know what they say u dont know what u have until u loose it give it a shot =]|`|3y0w1qIBaa	It may not seem to be a good idea.  If you get back together with her, one of you guys will break each other's heart.  If you truly love her, and if she likes you as well, then go for it.  After all, life is all about taking risks.|`|gijsRMOsaa	it seems dat she wants 2 get bak wit u and is sorry dat she broke up wit u. yea ask her out on V-day. i got bak wit a gurl who broke up wit me. all we did is work things out dats all|`|Tcm3MCM3aa	well if she still thinks you are and you have grown up. no offence to you. then yes ask her out on V-Day but make it really cute
nDQOwAA3aa	tell him hes "bigger" than all his friends lol
hd7J2aoNaa	haha  yeah, sometimes...  [Pro-Sarcasm?]|`|LDLTjNCraa	Yeah, that's normal and probably quite common|`|6wR9QkAlaa	Yes :) It's very normal for a woman to feel really horny just before or during her period. It's good old body saying "Oh no! It's the last chance to fertilise the egg! Get pregnant quick!" so of course you desire sex.  Hilarious jokes nature likes to play on us ^_^|`|6I1nxRAAaa	lmao that is perfectly normal >=P|`|7U9UAtTSaa	Im horny all the time|`|5fdgfNCRaa	lmao yes its normal|`|bZzGMCemaa	yess!|`|zKjgWdqAaa	Sure, it happens a lot.  The hormones that bring your period also make you horny.  Enjoy.|`|DTh1rgoqaa	I think everybody gets it differently. I get pains a few days before it starts.|`|OBVtGhVSaa	No that doesn't happen to me, but there is nothing wrong with you because of it  Answer my question please?: http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...    Thankyou!|`|PXTKHcx3aa	Yes =) happens all the time|`|vHDiHL43aa	Yeah, it's actually pretty common|`|v6V4A4MCaa	As weird as it may seem, that is pretty normal. Because of our (females) hormonal changes, it is probable there will be some kind of imbalance that will make a woman hornier around her ovulation. For some, it is three days before their period. For others, it is during the week of their period.    I've also heard it's psychological such as: "We want what we can't have" concept.
28WJwHf4aa	Why do you care if your b/f's best friend is jealous??     In all honesty, if you are with D, yet you say you like his best friend and flirt with him, I think you need to break up with D. Your behavior is disrespectful to not only your relationship with him, but also the friendship those two have.|`|CGxQ9vSuaa	Sounds like it.  Guys mask their jealousy or hurt feelings with demeaning comments.  He probably likes you, but my suggestion would be to tread very lightly in this situation.  Guys have a different 'code' than girls when it comes to dating.|`|PA7kYyAxaa	Yes|`|e3AnmkfUaa	I think you're a tramp and you know exactly what you're doing.|`|skiPYyGDaa	if he is jelious he will start to stop talking to you and maybe ignor you im a guy and thats what i do i hope it helped|`|UDX3qgy5aa	possibly  he sounds like he really likes you    but if he really really really liked you then he would be more discreet and nicer about it|`|4bc242fdbf11544b9518132d8c6a95c4aa	yeaa i think he likes u and his best friend is jealous of D he just said that so he doesnt feel too forward..|`|mpvjUx45aa	ya i think he wants you and he knows he cant have you so he'll act like that|`|cvoQ2ZJNaa	Yes, but he wants you to make up your mind before anything "happens".|`|B3VYy8sFaa	It sounds like he could be... but it might not neccesarily be jealous that he's with you.. he could be jealous that you're taking his friend away from him, or that his boy has a gf and he doesn't.    But he might like you also, I wouldn't look too much into it unless it keeps happening, or get more signals than just that and a little flirting.    Good luck!|`|fJPW0NTiaa	Definitely jealous! He wants some from you, I say keep your options open. Make them fight for you!|`|mAE5sI1paa	yerh i think he is jealious, to fix it?  well which one do u liek the most if u r dateing a guy u dont like or dont have a strong connection with, why bother? anyway if u like someone else be with them...lol...anyway if D is getting mad at you for that without letting you explain...maybe you should consider sorting it out with him, or dumping him, which eva one is best FOR YOU!|`|dJuhUAF5aa	He sounds jealous to me. Don't ever get in between best friends. For instance, when I was 16, a guy I liked and his best friend would flirt with me. And since the guy I liked, liked me back he got jealous about it. So its kinda like the same situation, except your actually seeing one of the guys. And don't keep flirting with that other guy, your gonna lead him on.|`|eNA4LIyFaa	Why did you start talking **** to him when he never even did anything wrong? I don't get it.... it sounds to me like your trying to make him jealous... if your a good-looking girl, he MIGHT be jealous... but if hes a good-looking guy and can get any girl he wants, hes probably not jealous and doesnt care about wasting his time with you and your drama... if your not a good-looking girl, then he's probably just really annoyed and cant wait for D to break up with you so that he and D can have fun again being best friends again. ... my advice: don't try to break up best friends, its not cool and hardly ever works.
lsFcvd32aa	"I like your hair"  "You have a nice smile"  "You have a nice/hot body"  "your so funny"    p.s. Make sure you smile.|`|51a318b835befd29d22ff2a38e8b5353aa	"cool shirt"  "you have a great smile"  "youre so funny!"    just normal stuff that youre thinking but that he can respond to
gCiJpRfwaa	Back then, probably if she had an attractive face. Actually, that's still probably the answer. I think most guys look at whether or not the girl's pretty before they decide if she has a nice body.|`|UYIanZIpaa	Face. Of course.|`|e28P8gWraa	Girls if they arent making eye contact with you while you walk by, they arent gonna be looking at your face.|`|I0g24Jmkaa	I agree with Jimmy.|`|c0XomxxEaa	Guys always look at my face|`|Q5KFND17aa	im a girl but I assume it depends what she's wearing.  If her cleavage is hanging out, they're gonna look at her boobs. If her thong is hanging out, her @ss. Otherwise, her face.|`|Ky99KA8Raa	boobies!!!!!!|`|BOHi9zfcaa	Face obviously.|`|Jo8HXGu1aa	FACE...duh!|`|ERHmYR88aa	i dont think it matters all that much what the girl looks like...uit's all about what her persnality is like..but if u want someone to talk to email me...musiklover4312@yahoo.com|`|qAWxOyWdaa	ALL guys are going to say boobs.      pathetic.|`|f2XdVMD1aa	I'm not a guy, but when i walk down the hall I see guys staring at my face or chest.|`|VDKVy4A3aa	Her face, hair, body, and clothes ;)  also her smile.|`|HvrgjsAjaa	if you ask this ? some people will say boobs, a**, stuff like that but what i like is mostly the face, and if she is funny|`|9FW0XcCuaa	im 15 and I totally judge girls on their hair and skin. Hopefully the skin wont be orange and the hair bleached white. gross!|`|6Wit7P2daa	hair, face, bum, boobs, tummy, legs. in that order.|`|fOPgMmnTaa	her face and smile|`|AA11635314	Breast bulges and camel toes. Tittie crack--beaver shots.|`|TMi1GhSHaa	They probably look at the girls face.. but you can tell if a guy is looking at you if he looks at you.. its not that hard.. but if he doesnt then he probably just look ahead and walk right on by.. if not he will look at your face, your body.. blah..|`|q2AsDnjpaa	bum|`|0lQtTE9Daa	to be honest her boobs|`|wSq80V1xaa	Face.|`|4a58c4fd512ff15ec1c473e939bdf1d1aa	well, What do you look at when you go past boys?  same!|`|fxxLgQrdaa	her face and her boobs|`|7ziKvIIpaa	look at boobs and butt
bSUipR3uaa	How do you bring it up. If a girl told me that she was christian. I would be like what ever. But if you were preaching it to me. I would leave you too.|`|tG1vTi0Daa	a christain gurl needs a christain guy. u might be looking in the wrong places. most guys just wana sexual relationship right now, but there are christain guys out there who kno better. good luck.|`|yktlEbZeaa	im a christian to and boys are still over me so maybe ur not talking to the right boys.|`|YQJk06kvaa	i dont think people would care what religion you are. i mean im a buddhist and no one seems to care that im different. also doesnt mean im gonna be all sexual with a guy either.
eO4y3m1maa	Yes don't waste time...go for it!
jzE6FMawaa	People have no legal right to privacy when they're out in public unless it is in an area where a reasonable expectation of privacy is assumed, such as a restroom or changing room.  So in a setting such as a department store checkout line, she's all talk.  She cannot have you arrested.  If she tried to make good on her threat, I think the cops might arrest *her* for a nuisance call.|`|838VJJGvaa	LOL  Sorry but this is kinda funny.  That was nice that you were honest, but I wouldn't have snapped back like that.  Just forget about it.|`|TMi1GhSHaa	wow you seem like  a pig.. you were staring at her curve lmao.. thats a turn off.. stare at the girls face.. not her a!zz[etts].. no you cant get arrested.. but she can slap you in the face for doing that.. i would =)|`|KHsWu1zbaa	Um, no.    Not unless you're staring at her through her bedroom window.    "Wilted Cornflake" --- LMFAO|`|AA11627920	LOL. no you cant.    look all you want.    queef sounds like a virgin.|`|AA12094990	Um, I don't think you can get arrested? She's crazy!! Stay away!! lol|`|BxCerdxlaa	ha no she's freakin retarded! don't listen to her you can look at what ever you want it's not a crime|`|S5QsLZwwaa	No you can't get arrested but you seem really creepy and you really shouldn't say what you're looking at. her question was rhetorical (look it up bc you probably don't know what that means). she has the right to say that bc you're invading her bubble and you probably shouldn't leave your house anymore bc you seem socially awkward and sexually inept (again look it up)
cGbTJobeaa	Your house; your rules.  It doesn't matter what rules others have in their own homes.      Get this...one of my friends has a rule that unmarried people cannot sleep in the same bed at her home.  Well, the grandfather has a live in girlfriend.  So, when the grandpa and his gf come to visit, they stay in separate bedrooms.  It's pretty comical that she's enforcing this rule for a couple of 70+ year olds, but they comply.  And they even come up to visit a couple times a year. LOL.    You're fine in not having a front row seat in your own home to your dad's drinking.|`|Tpa7wcQXaa	No. No alcohol.  I say this because, why would you weant to put him in a situation where he needs to fight his demons and his obviously strong temptations?  To make it a relaxed evening, just do not offer it.|`|UU0KkXhEaa	I say no booze.  Even if he isn't drinking, seeing others drink might make him want to, you know?  How about intead you make a nice fruity drink? You could put fruit in it and everything! Even serving it in martini glasses could be neat,! It's not real alcohol, but it feels like it :P|`|vqUVWPBAaa	No, you should not allow alcohol in your home. It is your home and your rules should prevail. Your friends and family are saying that he can get alcohol if he really wants it, I am sure. You don't want to make it easy for him to drink while he is in your home. I suggest you stick to your guns.|`|DcVoq5Tuaa	your house your rules. Even if you didn't provide the alcohol, he may still find a way to get it. If he want's a drink bad enough, he will go out and get it. If you have any in the house now, I would just put it somewhere where he can't get to it. This way you are not the enabler. If he does come over with some or is drunk, kindly tell him that you do not want it in your house and ask him to leave. Let him know that you will take him wherever he wants to go. Don't let him drink and drive.
TGfwEtUPaa	You could be scared of him  OR might Hate that you like him... Probably hate that you have a fatal attraction for a bad boy =)|`|UgcPxd4maa	idk - do you like him?|`|wuyjidC0aa	im just wondering but how old are you? And that is up to you if you hate him then maybe he just intimidates you.
eO4y3m1maa	Be patient. Talk to her about it.....hopefully she isn't leading you on...|`|1wi3e9qeaa	She may just need more time to recover from her last relationship.  Be a good friend, and give it time. Just keep the option open and let her come to you. If things are meant to be, she will come around.  If not you still have a good friend.
MFzG3eRdaa	I was thinking oh boy, here we go, but when I read your poem, I thought, wow, true poet right here. You should write that poem on a real nice sheet of paper and put your name on it and give it to this guy. This poem was one of the best poems i have ever read in my life.|`|6J8sHGRIaa	Beautiful. I'm pretty sure if you give this to him, he will be moved. But I understand you want to keep your relationship the same until you both are much older, wise. Save this for him until you're ready to give it to him. :)|`|dwok9z8faa	thats really good, maybe u should give it to him ;)|`|MYbRICxqaa	I really like your poem. It was sweet and endearing.|`|SFeNqLbNaa	its simply beautiful! i think that you should enter a contest with it! honestly it was really pretty and the best way is to tell him how you feel and the rest will fall in place|`|7ldEn0fJaa	this is pretty good but i think you would be good at writing a book|`|UEA4Uli9aa	Drop hints that you like him then maybe eventually give him the poem or write him one cause your really good :)|`|28WJwHf4aa	Nice poem.    I think that you should tell him how you feel though. I was really good friends with this guy in highschool, and had a huge crush on him, but I never said anything. I assumed we were friends, and that was it. About 5 years after we graduated, he found me on MySpace, and told me how he kicks himself all the time for letting me get away. While that's flattering to hear (I am married now, completely happy), I wish he had said something in HS! I ended up dating a complete loser in HS instead.     Best of luck!|`|YsYq7BJzaa	just tell him how u feel|`|JVCZOL8yaa	its not exactly a great form of poetry but still its great because it shows alot of emotion and feeling through your words.. beautiful.. good job|`|AA12036331	OMG! one of the best love poems ever! i love the poem because i'm in the same situation. sadly :(
yMRY5cgxaa	Probably takes it as a compliment from his mates now if they called you ugly and not worth shaggin then what would you and he think...|`|NSTjLXXpaa	he prob means u easy or something and your bf prob aint say anything because hes trying to look like a playa in front of his friends or he prob think thats true|`|TMi1GhSHaa	its not a good thing..and your boyfriend should of stood up and said something back.. like look shes my girls so stfu .. or something like that.. i cant believe he just sat there.. ugh.. you should leave him that just shows hes weak.. do you want to know what a shag means?!?!    well it means a girl who doesnt put that much into her physical appearance its basically another way of calling someone dusty, busted, sloppy, or ugly.       THere are MANY other definitions but in the way your boyfriends friends used the word which was directed to you.. it definitly means that definition.. the other meanings were, a bird, a term for volleyball..to have intercourse.. but they were used differently in the sentences..     http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.ph...
QNSmbmJvaa	Ew why would you want a girly man?|`|w5D1WCm7aa	those are guys?  you must be smokin some purple.

You will never be allowed to hold me fat again haha. Ok, not really. Bodies change with time but personality stays the same :)|`|smyhq0Ggaa	Funny...    EDIT: There are so many stupid people who think this is a literal question!|`|ecNeN0staa	::kicks him:: NOT FUNNY!|`|lb7exqUgaa	yea probably. i would always remember you as "the creepy guy"|`|W2pU2g9Eaa	Absolutely not! As long as u were respectful in saying it.|`|mE1HSVTsaa	I would say damn right i have!!! :) But thanks for the compliment|`|Nqda6ulSaa	i would think you are just trying to get with me than leave me..|`|oJ0p2Ietaa	who likes dr hook then|`|44eKDvkhaa	Only to find out if that's a roll of quarters in your pocket, or if you're really happy to see me.|`|OF1FZLw0aa	Haha...I LOVE this pick up line.

Jtd7kXQSaa	The next time you have a bad day at work. Go to your local drug store and buy a Johnson and Johnson brand rectal thermometer. Take it home and unwrap it. Now read the small print on the insert. It says every Johnson and Johnson rectal thermometer was tested and sanitized personally.  Now how much do you like your job ?|`|YlLdIPRvaa	I enjoy my job.  I used to work for a nation wide retailor and did not like the feeling of being a cog.  I made decent money but the hours were bad.  Now I work a 9 to 5 in an office and am able to take a day off if I have a sick family member or a doctor's appointment.  It's nice to have a job where you're cared about and feel like you make a difference in others' lives.|`|fb2d92b771dcd4d8b2d1dc3da6af3e05aa	its something that paid the bills, I quit because i have plenty of  money to pay the bills and I was tired of living to work.|`|pV8oOns7aa	Trade|`|JZMfUDylaa	im one out of many that don't have a job cause of this sucky economy the jobs i had before i hated and the managers sucked and were mean and it was only to get money but i would rather become a translator hopefully ill be going to school soon|`|rab3ZD5Yaa	I dont LOVE my job...but i have no choice...my sister is still in school and my mom doesn't have a job.. i gotta keep my job..thou..
LykjWv6faa	No, not at all. They're human, just like me. They're not gods.|`|IfwpibHqaa	NO NOT REALLY BECAUSE IM HOT MY SELF ITS THE OTHER WAY ROUND HEEEEE HEEEEEEEEE|`|0RaRa9DXaa	yes cuz we dont want to say the wrong things or do the wrong things around a hot guy that we like|`|m3Y3KkRmaa	lol i would be really shy tbh. especially if i liked him!|`|2QiLmXfhaa	sometimes, cos its like we feel you might not think we're pretty enough ...or get nervous, s'pecially if we like him. lol.  most hot guys i no though go out with the girl who slaps on tons of make up and has big t*ts! Lol|`|F6jUJUoOaa	definitely not, they are the ones who are two timing suckers, im more interested in a guys personality than "hot guys"..get my drift hun x|`|F2LI7zjraa	sometimes becuz i get scared of rejection but when i get 2 know them im really comftorble|`|sHzP9u5Taa	i'm not, im a hot girl so i see it as a challenge :p    i suppose they make girls nervous because they think 'i'll never get him' or 'he'll think its a joke if i flirt with him'    also he'll probobly be the one that ALL the girls want so they start comparing themselves to other girls, or if your the gils that goes out with the hot guy, other girls tend to hate you!    ALSO, the hot guys are 99% of the time MAJOR players so what girl who wants a loving relationship would want to bother??    xxx        oh...and hot guys have a MAJOR penchant for being pig headed, a-holes which really gets my goat! :p|`|RCGh7GTQaa	Hot guys/girls, ugly guys/girls, we're all the same.  I don't know why girls get so excited when they see an  "attractive" guy. He could be the biggest asshole, and girls would still be kissing his ***.   tbh, it's really pathetic that we're like that.|`|VFzrbbBMaa	well im not really intimidated...just kinda shy in the first place.  i just dont expect any hot guys to like me i guess, so i really dont have a problem with this.  it can be hard to talk to them though
dJkNofnoaa	Wow hmm if he's a nice guy butif hes known to cheat i wouldnt wana be the girl who got cheated on  the othergirl anything|`|uBX2TeXtaa	I think you are correct. Those girls are satisfied that they got a hot guy as a boyfriend. They probably "didn't think" he was their type from his personality and what not. Those girls are insecure and probably go insane because they think he's looking at other girls because he can do better.     It might be both scenarios. And once they dump him, they feel good that they just left an attractive person like they could do better than him.|`|H0HPx0kwaa	Obviously he doesn't know how to pick girls if that always happens to him. Not all girls are like that.|`|sW9AhB5Gaa	then he doesnt deserve them. he deserves better ...|`|yktlEbZeaa	hmm maybe some of the girls are going out with him so they can say they had a hot boyfriend and they dumped him so they will be popular so tell him to only go with girls that like him for him and not just because hes popular.|`|XP04VmIJaa	It always happens to me, i always get used as a trophy by girls and dumped.    I don't understand why and noone else does either.    I think that the insecurity theory mentioned is possible.    The girls assume that i'm a player because of how i look but i'm not, i'm just a loving honest guy.     I'm so sick of getting hurt i'm staying single and concentrating on gym and modelling.|`|b2awI3BJaa	either these are some messed up girls whom your friend shouldn't be dating, or your friend isn't a very nice guy.
wCqzSt34aa	yes i would definately date her, it says that she respects herself and isnt a whore|`|dac26bdff4c1ae6e6c1c4dbb89df4ac1aa	yes|`|e5f4c192231c92a0d059825b151f7553aa	It is the PERSON that you love.  And, knowing that she would be saving herself for you is actually rather endearing.|`|I7eOQ1cpaa	of course unless she is not a virgin in other places.|`|SaTfE6TEaa	Yes.|`|Gx14PIvxaa	Most young men will not! Virginity is a wonderful thing. Most people I've ever met will tell you that they lost theirs to someone who didn't even mean that much to them, OR looking back, they don't now.    Save it until YOU are ready. Boys will try anything to get you to give it up. The young man that respects you and REALLY cares about you - he will wait until YOU are ready, be in after marriage or what.
MtqEHBz1aa	she might but then again she might just want to be friends it depends on if she was flirting or not. don't worry so much about the text message but if it truly is bothering you then ask her about it or something. also if she didn't care that ur elbow was on her breast it could be because she feels comfortable around you and doesn't really care because she trusts you so yeah...well that is my opinion and if it helped so be it.
1vCoaf08aa	No, and I probably won't come time either.    :-(|`|LykjWv6faa	Yes, my boyfriend. (:|`|owuF63XWaa	no :(|`|Y4Ye3OLOaa	Hopefully.

bf3bc2c3811507a54ef69dd9118ca5a3aa	I'm sorry to say... the better a person looks the more superficial they are.    The uglier a person is the more jaded and cynical they become. (mostly by the effects of superficial people)  ___  Money... make lots of money, it's the only equalizer you need to get a superficial woman. (Be careful what you wish for because you just might get it.)|`|onAEy5jTaa	How do you know you're ugly? Maybe she thinks you're cute. You never know!

Hope I helped!|`|upazUCA6aa	crooked teeth ??  wtf?|`|7uB42JzJaa	If you honestly think she is deserving of someone better looking than you then I believe you she most likely does.  Find someone your own caliber.|`|0Yqjaj15aa	aww you poor thing!dont think of yourself that way!one of the most attractive things a girl can see in a guy is confidence(not cocky).It doesnt matter that you may not be good in sports or musically inclined the only thing you need is your personality and that should shine through.if shes a kind ,sweet person that you say she is she should like you no matter if your super hot or average.Everyone has there flaws and thats  what makes everyone great (i bet she does too=]).Just be yourself around her and she should see what great person you are.  best of luck hun!|`|fBbrDGA7aa	Looks don't matter as much as people think. I have seen a lot of pretty girls with guys that were not so pretty. Rejection is part of life, you have to be willing to take chances. Eventually you will get to the point where you dont care what other people think of you. Then there will be less pressure, and if you get rejected who cares. There are Billions of grils on this planet, and its all about the numbers game.|`|cUx9S1d1aa	so go out with a ugly girl then|`|AA12226240	trust me.  a lot of girls like guys for their personality  your probably not ugly  dont lower your self esteem like that  thats horrible!  you need to have a high self esteem. if you talk to her then youll totally have a chance. trust mee|`|MHQVnqaXaa	just be confident. whats the worst that could happen if you ask her out? she says no and you guys just be friends. you cant go through life happy unless you accept who you are, and your face is a part of that. i'm sure you aren't as bad looking as you say.  you should post a picture on here and ask people what they think. then you get true opinions and you can just take off the question later.|`|DJyrX41eaa	its true physical aperence is important, but if u can stop being shy and talk to her  be really sweet she will mostly likly like u for ur personality which is wut u want|`|lSfZT10oaa	Don't put yourself down like that.  I thought that my husband was "unattractive" when we first met.  He was funny and held doors open for me but he was sincere and that is what attracted me to him.  I think he is the most attractive man I have ever seen and I thank my lucky stars that I put the whole look thing aside to know who he really was.  Give it time.  If your not happy with yourself, how can someone else be happy with you?  Chew on that.  Roll it over and over and think to yourself that everyone has someone that is right for them.  You will find her.  I promise.|`|pc1EKWSuaa	sry i didn't read all the story...but all i got 2 say is not all cute , hot , pretty girls fall for cute , hot , handsome boys....i got a Friend that fell in love with an ****** ugly guy (will first i didn't like him coz hes ugly)...but when i met him i was like girl i want him...my Friend is(pretty by the way).....put that in ue mind         if she didn't like u...someone else will....dont worry|`|YnzwG6fuaa	maybe you think that you are unattractive, but you don't know about the girl. I think that she is the one how's better place to tell you what she thinks of you.  So maybe you should try telling her what you feel, and she'll tell you wat's in her mind|`|BkrBNTPPaa	Its not bad as u think.  my bf doesnt really think that he is attractive but everyday he is more attractive to me because he has such a wonderful personality and he is honestly attractive.

Be sure that you ask her about her opinion. Don't just choke the things. ASK HER.|`|eua5YYYcaa	I hate to say this to you , but your problem sounds more like you lack confidence than anything.  If you heard your question from my perspective you wouldn't believe how self depricating you are.      I am not saying that this girl will like you , but with out any confidence what do you have to offer her?  Think of all the great aspects of you and your life and let them shine.  You need to come out of your shell.
uzVMSVJpaa	i seriosuly dont think it matters, even though im a girl..lol  i think it would make you unique & all around even MORE intresting[:  im sure you would be my friend, lol|`|9580a1e44dd3d2bae7d2f867611ab353aa	?

Look at your voice as unique. You heard of kat von d? Her voice is kinda deep and its really sexy. Pink has a raspy voice.Ur voice shouldn't have anything to do with ur lack of friends. Thats more of a personality thing. Stop worrying about how ur voice sounds. You're voice prolly doesn't even sound no where near as bad as you think:)
karyV7TJaa	yeah talk to him their nothing wrong with being friends
pCZM6cnjaa	play it cool and DONT flirt. that way he might get the message. also stop talking to him for a little while but dont be bitchy and ignore him.  things could be awkward for a little while but then he will get over it soon enough.      If you have the guts to just tell him that you think dating him would be weird and you see him more as a brother.  and that you just dont like him.    Good luck!
VbFEvDL7aa	She wants to be close friends.
T0i2iB22aa	number one is they still talk to the person they loved the most occasionally and number two she is still wasting her time with a certain boy.|`|cb10953b2f0dad5e0861aa07228435e5aa	Why should you care what a stupid myspace survey says?|`|pAi3C3W6aa	1...she means she talks to the person she fell hardest for now and again and for  2...she means she feels she is wasting time on a certain someone..like not paying attention to her signs that she likes them? idk : )
83r5cMh4aa	I just read that on someones question that was an answer... I couldn't even believe what has this world come to. When did watching porn so your man don't cheat become right??? This is ridiculous... in some cases where men are addicted that is cheating when it is him and the computer and that's all he needs and doesn't need you sexually mum I am sorry that is a form of cheating|`|XTBlOf9baa	Errr... what's "spousening"?    Anyway, as an infidelity couples counselor, the percentage of those who cheat is higher in those who watch porn than in those who don't watch porn. So that definitely contradicts the "porn or cheating theory."|`|2vaGZ4eDaa	It's all about freedom of expression.  Porn isn't real, but it does offer us a chance to fantasize or experiment in a different way.  All people are curious by nature, and this curiosity can not be stamped out by a control freak who trumpets rules.  The reality is, for your man to be himself in your relationship isn't possible, so he has two options - he can lie to you and pretend to be something he is not, or he can abandon ship.  He deserves credit for battling for his right to think freely.|`|JI7NQ9TNaa	Let me get this straight.  You're saying even the thought of him thinking about another woman is cheating with you?    Hon...my husband never wandered from my bed...because I understand that what happens in Men's heads is very different from what happened in their heart.    Good luck to you!|`|7d535ccd0098dd19bfe900035ca87c98aa	I really dont see what the big deal is with porn. People seem to get so upset about it...?       So what if couples watch it to give their bedroom a bit of spice. Its all fake and fantasy anyway. Its a movie, Its edited etc....    In my opinion its no different to watching a 'happily ever after movie"..............everyone knows thats not what REALLY happens in real life.|`|AaZCmTGUaa	I have asked myself the same question many times. It's like having to choose between bad and worse. I also find it amazing what women will do to draw the attention of their (oftentimes) loser husband onto themselves. Or any man for that matter. This signals husbands, or boyfriends, that they can be very sure their significant other is not going anywhere. They don't have to fight and as a consequence they are pushing the limits. Let's see what else is acceptable. Men make mistakes and their wives desperately try to make up for it.     Screw that.    ADDENDUM  I can only speak for myself but I am pretty sure other women are the same. My aversion towards pornography, if used to intentionally seek arousal and satisfaction, has nothing to with being prude. I find porn boring because I have done the same things that are performed many times since I was 16. Actually, I have had only man in my life who would agree to do a snowball. And that is really harmless and not even creative. I am wondering who are the real prudes here.     This has to do with loyalty, nothing more.|`|iD4ejChZaa	porn is cheating of the mind, then leads to cheating. these people don't know it yet, or somebody's just too damn ugly to pick up a lover, so they stick with porn.|`|cEaODF8Raa	most men love porn, it doesnt have much to do with cheating though. guys that cheat are going to cheat or wish they could regardless of watching porn. I watch porn because some of the things i get off on my wife is not into so i am able to sort of live out the fantasy alone. I would never cheat on her.|`|OT3eczxaaa	I have zero problem with my fiance viewing porn that involves consenting adults. I watch it myself. I am neither insecure nor 'settling'. I also do not define looking at another woman as cheating, nor is watching porn 'keeping' either of us from cheating.    If you don't like porn, that's your prerogative.|`|NbU9Nk43aa	YES YES & YES!!!MOST females are insecure!!!and they look at porn to.if they stood up to their man.alot of **** would stop.|`|6k2lmVChaa	I'm just putting this out there but some women are to much of a prude and so tightly wound they will not even try to please there mate. And they figure if he's watching porn at least he's home. Its sad but thats how it feels in my house.|`|qjcTW2vJaa	Jeez, there's nothing wrong with watching porn we watch it together too, and when he is out of town I watch it by myself sometimes.|`|faT4MyVkaa	A bunch of women are prudes, cold, and/or take their mate for granted. Then wonder why their husbands turn to porn or affairs. If you take care of business, instead deluding yourself, this would not be a problem.
7Jm2ZZGzaa	it sounds like shes afraid of the 1st kiss or getting 2 close...alot of girls have that issue...give her a lil longer than a month n a half n she might come around...dont push it or it'll never happen :)
u7YIC77Xaa	Baby Daddy is best. There's a bond there.
thmlwAZDaa	you should get another boyfriend and rub it in his face ...[ no dont stoop to his level ] just ignore and forget about him and move on|`|LUC2GDxTaa	Tell him he's being immature and tell yourself you're better than him - he's obviously quite shallow 'cause he teases his ex about his new gf... I'd say he's desperate for attention. Just don't give it to him.
nceIGfCBaa	Yep.  Wake up, eat cereal during cartoons, play video games, watch a movie, take a nap, eat some more, play another video game...that is pretty much it.    DRAGON 2012  "Great fortune for U.S."|`|K2umerZ0aa	yeah... probably cuz me and my bf broke up, so quite likely... :-(  lol im bored 2! :-)  ...!|`|eSI9c4Ncaa	Lol, for once I'm not. Also for once I'm not going to be alone on my B-day, which is Feb. 28!!!!!    Also also for once I finally found somebody my own age, but how I don't know.|`|vci1Mjkhaa	Me because i am single because i can't find a girlfriend :(|`|QSJDp6E2aa	hahaha   i am gonna be very very much alone     im gonna go out with some friends   watch them give each other presents and then go home cry for my bad luk wake up the next morning like it never happened     my best friend cory is gonna be my pretend valentine we feel bad for each other soo
tAmFjEflaa	you defriend people from facebook!? why would you do that? i wouldn't say its gurlie but it is a bit harsh.
ySnDQpXJaa	wow thats really cool. im actually from costa rica. so speaking from personal experience i would go ( im a guy ). there is a lot of fun things to do and its not like you can't go to college there. they have a lot of colleges over there. the only question i would ask is are you sure that you love this guy with everything you have? would you do anything for him? and do you think he is the kind of guy that you can picture yourself waking up to every morning? just some questions to think about... but if i were you, this is a once in a lifetime chance to move with the guy you love and experience something that most people never get to experience. I SAY GO FOR IT! lol|`|Jzzl2QAmaa	DUU u should go and not even have asked this QUESTION!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|eSDNSq4zaa	sounds stupid, dont go.|`|FlSLNhsoaa	YES you absolutely should go!!!
qSyYrx2raa	maybe she had a yeast infection. that's very common in females.  yeast infections come from wearing tight pants, and from stress. never assume anything like that if you have any evidence. If you trust her you wouldn't think that way, and what is a relationship without  trust???  good luck!! i wish you the best!!|`|rfOFuGNNaa	Different times of the month make chicks wetter and looser. She could have been doing stuff to herself...  Plus chicks can get wet without even doing anything to them|`|LPEWAoWCaa	Sounds like a yeast infection...|`|ZOcoyJD3aa	tell her the truth   maybe she might give you an explanation or get a slap on the face|`|wUbvU3aiaa	Stay away from her.   Star far away from her.|`|S8ieKnDIaa	You think she cheated, so that was enough grounds for dismissal?  Did you even ask her about 'downstairs'?  If you don't have the nuts to talk about stuff like that, you're not mature enough for a relationship with her
YzqAPy59aa	Talk to him more and give him your  .  That way he'll come to you
4NZtFNC1aa	Because [most] of them are idiots ;)  && they don't care, they just want what they can't have..  but they think that if they want it bad enough they will get it, but trust me it doesn't work like that ;)
IcKi8yQ2aa	I changed it up a bit, and since I don't know the girl, I don't know if this is what you're looking for, but here it is.     You have:   Say you want yours, but you can't start over...    I edited and added:  Say you want yours, but you can't start over  so everybody hands in their four-leaf clovers  I'll never be one to be superstitous but  this is getting a little out of hand,  when everyone gives up their happy, but she  keeps going, she keeps wishing, she'll never stop dreaming    Baby there's never been a day like today, how she looks,   the things I want to say...      And that's where I stopped, because, like I said before, I don't know her. But, she's very lucky to have a musician fall for her. I've always dreamed of somebody writing a song (or something) about me, but so far, nilch.       Best of luck!    Rose
9CUaikUEaa	just think that it doesnt involve moving around a lot so it can relax you. and before you do it, maybe watch tv for half an hour just so you arent stressed, then go for it. also you could go to bed earlier and do it in bed?

At least do it properly and get into the clash and sex pistols.|`|s2RsL0eVaa	depends......on looks|`|CryNyW0Faa	its all different people preference. Personally i'm not to keen on tom boys, im friends with a couple but i'd never date them. and playing bass and punk music isn't tomboyish, thats cool|`|VR2HGqTbaa	hek no im in a band and all my frends say girls need to be more open to rock and punk music.|`|daba7a94185ef9c3faf4a2bcad0f1695aa	aw wa i wanna play bass guitar i luv the sound...................|`|b0c58cc0b655a543b52a5ab7c8f62835aa	Not really, although there are guys with their own ways of being attracted (there are weird ones like this guy who gets turn on by looking at fat people who has just asked the question about weird hard-ons). They are guys attractive to that type, if you are indeed that type you will find many guy on here offering you their phone numbers of email addresses so here's mine xinqe@ymail.com

aLwrpMPXaa	She is in her 40's and you in your early 20's. What can she possibly want from you or learn from you? The fact that she brought you "cookies" doesn't say "she wants you."  She felt just "flattered" by your first attempt but she knew what to do. From what you've explained here, she is not the slightest interested in you on a physical or emotional level. Treat the "work ethics and etiquette" respectfully clean.|`|cZzl472Faa	She turned you down. Respect her and the work environment.
LVlS4y7Caa	Lonely, perhaps, insecure in moments, no more so then men are on both stances.    That's a pretty generalized question...See if you can't work it into something more thought provoking.    Sincerely,    Grace|`|3iNobwVraa	Nope.|`|yIGVOqXdaa	No!!! i was never insecure without a man. Infact it was the exact opposite. I enjoyed being single|`|ENSGrZAqaa	Insecurity doesn't come from being single or not.|`|weckW02caa	hell no! some women have self esteem issues that would make you feel that way.If thatperson is'nt secure with themselves how can they expect a man to secure them.|`|VSVQHKwKaa	Yep...as several of the posters have already demonstrated.    However, take all the women out of the eviroment, and men go a little crazy in the head...so it works both ways.    Mind the feminists. They bite.|`|an1EMiFkaa	Ummm NO!!! Where did you get that load of crap from?...must have been another man.|`|c52cbd262f9bbe8b25813042e1adaf6caa	I think society makes women feel they are incomplete without a man, but I don't know how many of them feel they are insecure without one.  Maybe there are some women who feel they need a man in their life for security, while others are strong enough to know that a man does not define who they are.  I think it's all up to the woman.|`|mbIbtkUEaa	u wish dude   i am single and i am loving every moment of it =p
B3VYy8sFaa	If what's going around school is specific to what you did, and you didn't tell anybody.. then it's pretty obvious he did.    And it depends on if you trust the ppl telling you he's saying stuff, and if it's from multiple people.    Follow your gut, not what you WANT to believe.
51a318b835befd29d22ff2a38e8b5353aa	nothing wrong with you, for the future i would recommend he pleases you orally more and you use a lotta lube! its helps a LOT  i would stick to missionary, cuz you can widen your legs to loosen up more than other position. and try putting a pillow under your butt, it will make the angle better    hope this helps! =]|`|eiJOdPgxaa	There IS a condition where women suffer pain during sex - best go discuss this with your doctor.|`|f5u9sxbTaa	It will hurt the first couple of times.|`|3e7a875d4a87c6e3456cadcbb0d8c262aa	jesus christ, read what you have just written I only hope i instill self respect in my daughter, so she will not allow any dissfunctional sex in her life  good god, you allowed yourself to be abused for pleasure, did u get paid, such a sad muppet ffs|`|4eWxjj5Uaa	This is completely normal. I had the same problem the first time i had sex but the thing is, you really need to use lube. After i used lube the pain was very minimal and tbh it felt soo much better. so my advice is to use lube the next time, and shouldn't hurt half as bad.  Hope this helps. x|`|d49ZA5xYaa	Depends, are you a boy or a girl?  Go to answer a) if you are a boy  Go to answer b) if you are a girl    a) Are you gay?  b) Are you gay?    Both these questions answer the same. Unless you are in prison with a 6"8 Black man as your cellmate, named Bubba, sex probably shouldn't be so painful. However, if you are in prison, why are you there?  what did you do?  is Bubba nice?    Call me, im lookin forward to this conversation :)

p6IGALzbaa	Let's see... (yes i am a chick) but i do know what i like from girls.  And i know what guys like from girls as well.  Straight forward [:  But anyways, bite his neck. Not too hard, just in a frisky way. When you kiss him, bite his bottom lip (not too hard and so on).  Think seduction.  Most people are sensitive on their neck.  So biting it, sucking on it, etc. He would like it.  Also, when you kiss him hold onto the back of his head and run your fingers through his hair.  Rub his ears too.    This might sound crazy, but trust me, they like it.  And I apologize if you are under the age of 13.  (:

514fe92d3b5ee587bad2e6c4029a3b3baa	You have to tell him and be clear with him. Your loyalties are with ur best friend and your dude, not him!

When he is  have to step on his " friend" toes to even be with u,and u have to do the same with ur bestie? If he will do the exact same to u in some months if not weeks!

Um you do know that someone can't stop being attracted to someone just because a girl tells them to stop right? telling someone to stop only makes them wont to do it anymore *everyone wants what they cant have*. Just tell him to stop because it's disrespectul to your boyfriend and his girlfriend/ YOUR best friend. Him liking you alone can ruin your friendship with your best friend (girls get jealous) so if you want to keep your boyfriend and friend and want your bf & him to stay friends than maybe you shouldn't worry about whether he's attracted to you or not.|`|FvVqFFrNaa	tell him you are into girls|`|exHroh8Maa	if he's dating your best friend, you should definitely not get your hopes up on dating him if/when they break up. that will most likely cause major problems with your friendship. tell him you just can't have anything to do with him like that because he's dating your friend. not to mention you're dating his best friend. good luck :)|`|3rBYqlCJaa	tell him "i dnt wanna ruin our friendship and i dnt wanna break up with my bf and i think you should maybe stop im really sorry but this is for the best" and telll him "we can still be friends"(:    Best of Luckk!((:

vAR22hz4aa	"im manically depressed" she probably already has a clue...
7eM0VeX8aa	No not at all. Its natural to want to see a person more than one time. it does not mean that you are desperate at all. to me it means that you are very into him and you want to get to know him better on the personal level. Seeing each other face to face is so much better than just emailing each other back and forth. so you are okay with wanting to see him again.
FgT4CDpBaa	Okay, well when I was thirteen, my boyfriend and I were just like what you describe yourself as.  We were at a movie, and we were cuddling. I was leaning in towards him and when something funny happened, I looked up at him, and stayed there for a while. I kept looking at his lips, and he eventually kissed me. and that was our first kiss. so try that, and if that doesn't work you could try this: when you hug him, sort of put your cheeks together and inch your way to kiss him.     don't be nervous, and good luck!    ps once you've had your first kiss, you will kiss all the time. and of course, you will get better and better.
smyhq0Ggaa	Right now you think you are in love, I know you do.    But just believe me here, even though you think you know better. When you get to say, 17 or 18, you are going to look back and realise you weren't really in love at all.    Now I know you probably disagree with me now, and probably won't remember this past a day or two, but just in case you do, you'll see I'm right :)|`|HSrBpGqkaa	take a chance you only get one life!
jaHkY4Rbaa	This is a common and a serious problem.    Your mom is suffering from anxiety, depression and anger.  It is sad that she has decided to hide in bed to  deal with her discovery and her loss.    For you and your sister, it is difficult not knowing what will happen next.  Losing your friends, your town and your family is awful, and losing your mom and dad is even worse.    Can you talk to an adult who has some influence in your family ?  Maybe you will have to go talk to your mom and tell her what you know.  You do not have to explain how your found out, but you can just say you heard them arguing.    Maybe telling your mom about your fears will spur her to do something to protect and comfort you.    However, do not fear changes, as it might be an opportunity to explore new things.    When I left my kids mom, they too were devastated, but I left them in their home, with their mom, and did not even take one piece of furniture.    Within six months, two of my kids came to live with me, and six months later, so did my third child.    They all adapted to change and I supported them the best that I could.  I am proud to say all three of them are wonderful young adults now, who love both their mom and their dad. (and are still upset we don't live together ! )|`|986af596c09da513b6587d9c648fde74aa	dont go borrowing trouble!I hate to say this, but this is between your parents. I bet you wish you hadn't been snooping now dont ya? These are the kinds of things parents try to protect their kids from. They dont even know if they are heading for divorce yet, and your already thinking the worst. Sometimes parents forgive and move on. Sometimes they dont. Its not your decision to make though, and no, you  dont get a vote. Let your parents handle it. They will make it as painless for you as they can. Talk to your mom and dad, let them  know you know.  There have been to many secrets already. Tell them you get you dont get a vote, but that you are really hurt by this and you hope they will think of you and your sister while they are deciding what to do. See if there is something you can do to help them get through this.   I'm really sorry you have to deal with this|`|6Mm3KV6iaa	well talk to your sister one night tell her whats going on she has the right to knowbut only if you trust her not to tell any one cause one person tell her mom and her mom tells more ppl it could get to your mom or dad your sister could get in big trouble so ya your parents should never be apart and to make them happy cook dinner one night do you laundry with out them telling you do what ever it takes to make them know that the had a perfect girl that they should never break up and let that fall into peaces of wrong and not right it will work they will soon see what they are doing then your dad will feel selfish of him self and and to stay with his family that he loved first and not what he loved second those emails where non of your biss and way you had no right to look though them|`|AA12046874	I went through something similar, my whole childhood actually, but it was my mom who did the cheating. I snooped (and still do, I'm 21 now) through her stuff. I read her text messages. Nothing wrong with snooping, so whoever tells you that doesn't know what they're talking about (if it's close family. You learn interesting things). Anyway. All you can do is concentrate on school, friends...maybe even write in a journal. You could also talk to your school counselor about how you feel, maybe they can help you through this. Don't confront your parents about what either of them are doing; they will only get angry. Especially if they found out you snooped. There's not a lot you can do. You can, however, talk to them about how you feel about things (in general). Talk to them about how important they are to you and having them together is important. Sometimes these things are inevitable and your parents may not be able to work things out. So you just have to be ready for that. I'm sorry you're going through this...I know exactly what it's like and it's painful. But you'll be okay.|`|kHx1upOpaa	focus on improving yourself, love yourself more than anyone, focus on school and doing whatever it takes to improve in every way you can mentally physically and so on. You can't control what your parents do you can only control your own life. Find positive people who will help teach you things and get rid of negative people. My parents go divorced when i was younger.
5MxKdoixaa	Hahaha, I joined theatre crew to spend time around him, even though I was used to being on stage. I joined school groups to be around him. I dated another guy to make him jealous. When in dance class with him, we were paired up and all I could do was talk to him and toootally screw up every dance step (I'm not talented on the dance floor), to the point where he told me to focus and be quiet, haha.   We're still friends now, even though we're both aware of the sexual tension. Been friends for 8 years now.     My most recent crush I had just started dating. I was trying to be suave at the end of our date, I exited his car, paused, and leaned back in to give him a kiss. It went smoothly, I smiled, then backed out of his car again and bonked my head on the door frame. Though he tripped over two separate small steps that night, so we were even, hahaha|`|zdHsiepwaa	once i was around my crush and i frated then he was like you smell so good   my nickname is candy farts|`|dwok9z8faa	i was walking my dog and was like "yeah his name is lucky and hes really stupid", the guy was just kinda like ok freak. haha
AsFiWxhUaa	you do have a right to feel that way it is natural. the reality of this is you are with someone else and you are happy. i know it is hard to let it go but you have to. wish them the best of luck. worrying about it my put a strain on your current relationship and that is not fair to the girl you are with making her feel like she is not as good because you are upset about the past. move on and just focus on what you have now. best of luck!|`|Rch68tXlaa	I think your right in feeling that way.Friends ex's are off limits.It does not matter how long ago you guys broke up its still your ex and as a good friend he should understand why your bothered by him talking to your ex.    A good friend would know that the ex's are off limits...Its an un-written rule.|`|WNHjbpHEaa	wow i think it WOULD NOT be okay with that...and him being your friend and your roommate on top of that...maybe you should just let him know u dont appreciate that...who would? hes obviously not a good friend if he doin that..but then again guys are like that..good luck tho|`|i01egybJaa	No! It is not okay! Haven't you ever heard of the girl code? Or... guy code... in this case.|`|FyyJ6lpbaa	if hes really ur frend andd carea abouut u then he wouldnt do something like that to you..  i would never go and date someone my bff likes unless shes completely over him or something cus it would totally break her heart|`|C2olZsNiaa	Your lucky he even asked you first.  It's a hard 1 because he technically dated her first.    The right thing to do would be to go ahead and tell him it's cool.    The real thing to do is just what you did.  Tell him that him dating your ex would make it a vry uncomfortable situation for you.  There are way too many girls out there for a good friend to be bothered with messing around with a friends ex.|`|Gx14PIvxaa	Of course it bothers you, that is human nature. I don't know if it is "wrong", but it goes along with my whole theme here lately of it just being "insensitive", and there is no black and white board where you can line out what is "insensitive" or not. You know what will hurt your friends' feelings and what won't - and there are even different lines you don't cross with different friends.    I always thought that, with guys, an ex-girlfriend was always out of the question! Am I wrong on that?    I just feel like, out of the billions of people on earth, why do you have to go after my ex?
J1OC83Paaa	i think ur girlfriends are the best people to talk about this too  i mean they are around ur age so yea lol =]  now if u and ur bf are close on an intimate level  then u should feel more comfortable talking to him about it    but dont feel awkward talking to ur close friends about it  if they understand u then they will listen =]|`|fsiXYWEvaa	It's not that bad.  I talked bout it all the time and half of my friends know bout it and stuff.  I mean i never told random ppl. just close ppl.      It isnt that bad
eO4y3m1maa	They will notice you for being you, just talk to them....
dGyX3E8Faa	Its very well written but its one of those things at the end that pisses me off haha.|`|AA11441704	very beautiful.
xwsS0ITJaa	Car sex, lift sex, park sex but oh my gosh just get it.|`|haWw3B8aaa	Same problem, stay strong.|`|zKjgWdqAaa	I usually think back on favorite sexual experiences, which are mostly about exes, naturally.  I don't know where you live, but most places have secluded private places you can go.  Why not take a long walk with a blanket?  Might add just the excitement you need.|`|lR7vv1K3aa	If you have to have sex all the time then there's something wrong with you... what if your boyfriend had to have his thing removed.|`|ZGZn4f8Paa	Make him take you to a hotel every once in a while or ask to use a best friends bed(tell them you will brings your own sheets lol).|`|joCeoCNeaa	me also waiting 4 tat experience.but mw=y boy frnd cheat me.he gives lots of kisses 2 me.but now he married another girl&finish all vid her.but me finished all vid him only dream.im bad luck.so i cant ansewr u|`|pKzH1cFHaa	Get out of their house now. Live only for your needs and sell anything you can if it means getting out of there. Until you move out though, get a toy and do it in front of him, showing him what he is missing.|`|tsdHndRhaa	hey, put some adventure into it as the thought of getting caught can be a turn on, if you got a basement go down there and have a dirty quicky or get into the shower together and do your thing. also oral sex can help remedy the situation so just be adventurous and do things that are quick to turn each other on until you get to where you wanna go.|`|6487bd61ef059cac042d49119a814a4aaa	Forget about fantasy.  Sneak off and see if you can have "silent" sex.  If you're afraid of getting caught....just rub each other through your clothes.|`|VDlvSMP1aa	car sex|`|fc964df50bc3ae84b97937ecb982821baa	You fantasize about your ex's? What about your current man? It takes a while to get over the whole stigma of living at the parents...give it time...until then take some time to enjoy yourself in the shower or something!
w4jUFbTYaa	Try planning a gathering in a town that is in between both of yours.
WFRooU7Maa	Give him some time  If he likes you he may be waiting to respond so he doesn't seem too desperate or that he likes you too much    Give it 2 more days, then send another one  Make the second one require a response|`|bT4JqAwYaa	find someone else completely different. I just ended a 2 1/2 year relationship with a girl that i had been with since 11th grade an now im in college and you just move on. Especially being this young there is so many more fish in the sea|`|8UiV3vDsaa	he is hidding some thing with the jerk !|`|8HnLYjK4aa	so,     you didn't talk to him for a couple years...no problem.    he doesn't talk to you for a couple days...big problem.    maybe he isn't ready to change his life overnight just because you graced him with your presence.
01pY6dW9aa	take it some time..|`|EE7sAaMlaa	doesnt sound like theres much of a spark..it should be exciting at first - ask urself y ur rely going out.
77ZVd5hyaa	You're a funny guy. Most people will cheat given the chance.  I always keep it real.|`|Ev1FgxDgaa	Because they are a bunch of ignorant whiny winches.  Face it, men will cheat, it's our nature.|`|NsFaPI9waa	Ha! Pathetic man syndrome    I know for sure I would never go out with any cheater; never have never will. My father cheated on my mother and although it gave her years of heartbreak it taught me a valuable life lesson and I know an honest man apart from a cheater.    It disgusts me you are saying 'No wonder men think women are so dumb.' WTF is that about? Just because a woman is honest and loyal to her guy dosen't make her dumb... who are you to judge? It's unfortunate I don't know you in real life or else I would call your 'two women' straight away and inform of the situation you have tricked them into with your selfish male needs and wants.   I bet STRAIGHT  away both of them would get rid of you leaving you with no one except your best friend inside your boxes and your hand.    And if I was one of the 'two women' don't even think you would have any balls right now because I would've chopped them off and put them inside my sandwich for breakfast CH'YEAH!|`|LykjWv6faa	Wow. Aren't we the generalizing person?|`|NOWPlaUXaa	Don't waste our time if you're not going to ask a legit question.. nobody cares about your snyde, pessemistic outlook on things.|`|ikacAw7Naa	This doesn't deserve to be commented on.  What a waste of time.  But at least I got my two points.|`|W0XoDxJraa	Because of individuals such as yourself.  I have never been cheated on, but it is individuals such as yourself that causes women to get worried and insecure, and thus defensive when men ask about cheating.   You are foolish and incredibly generalistic if you think that all men let testosterone ruin what may well be the best thing in their lives. I think it is immaturity to use such a phrase of "face it". I am not going to "face" such ridiculous nonsense. I am happily married and this has never been an issue. Stop fishing for a reaction from women. (which you are obviously looking for hence the title of your question).    Now, a question for you. Are you asking this because you have cheated in the past, ruining your relationship and are hereby trying to justify your actions?
0lQtTE9Daa	100% gay|`|52092e43afb48f25c3b2832d7f29ae10aa	I was not aware that the two were related...    Interesting|`|yv3unx5Eaa	100% gay.

How does that correlate to being gay?   My ex-boyfriend had a tongue ring and he is totally not gay. I'd go with just "ghey" and leave it at that.|`|Midbg5BJaa	Ummm... body jewellry has nothing to do with expression of sexual tendancies...|`|29ddeea7f871392bf7b17a12fc77a694aa	hes not gay because of that|`|DLWmtpvSaa	99% to 1% (1% being straight)|`|eua5YYYcaa	I always thought that guys had them to please girls orally, but what do I know I think they are foul!|`|f2XdVMD1aa	The chances are high but it doesn't prove he's gay. My neighbor has a tongue ring and he's strictly hetero.|`|ZE6XtxgZaa	yea straight guys get  tongue rings too, but if you're curious about whether he's gay or not then spend some time with him and be open about your sexuality that way it'll make him feel more comfortable|`|hhCyCo1iaa	in  my opinion hes seriously homo bt then again it could mean he loves giving oral sex|`|sciO32Bsaa	Gay just because he has his tongue pierced??  WTF???  I think you need to open your mind a bit!!!!!!!!!|`|AaWSU711aa	I used to date a guy, for awhile, that had his tongue pierced.

Goxe3kheaa	When you are on your period, the blood is a different consistency then other fluids down there. It can cause tension that could be uncomfortable or just plain weird for your guy. Not to mention it is VERY messy and its very hard to clean off blood and what not off the penis.     As far if most guys are like that, I had an ex that refused to go near me that time of the month and another that didn't really care.     To each their own.|`|AA11788664	Me and most of my friends don't like to have sex with girls while their on their period, however I do know a few guys who will, I guess its just personal preference|`|71ae4755ec6533f862aed7b1761c0dccaa	Completely depends on the guy.  Some guys find it unappealing, while other guys don't care, as long as they're getting some.|`|tsdHndRhaa	some guys think outside the box and like to do wild things like period sex or anal, so it's just a to each their own way kinda thing.|`|mbv2jLqDaa	Well, it doesn't sound like the most pleasant thing, so I would venture to say that most guys wouldn't.  However if your flow is very light near the end, you can't really notice anything and clean up is simple.  If your guy doesn't want to do anything, try pleasing him for a week with oral or try some new things like anal sex.

I'd be flattered by any guy telling me he has feelings for me, but if I didn't like the guy back it'd just be awkward. It's nice :)|`|5zdmwHIhaa	It is nice and cute to hear it from you, just take it slow, do not tell her over and over, then it gets old and doesn't seem important anymore.|`|1VZy38vvaa	It aaaaaalllllll depends on if I like him or not!|`|AA12359831	depends on if i like him or not.  if hes a total stalker and wont leave me alone. im super annoyed and basically want him to leave me alone.  if i like him. then i wouldnt beable to stop thinking about it.  and if its a guy friend in my circle. id think its cute. and might start liking him back.  but it all depends on your relationship with the girl.  if she sees you like a brother. sorry...  good luck!|`|lKRHvwgJaa	well if you know this girl and have been talking to her for awhile then no not at all, its a way of finding out if she likes you back, and if she does; great and if she doesnt then your still friends, but if you dont know her that well, dont tell her you like her just yet, wait and see how it goes. basically, it will all work out in the end.|`|YfwTblzKaa	I guess it all depends on how he tells me if its in a stalker kinda way then it will end up being weird but 99% of the time its cute, what girl doesn't like to know that someone likes her. Would I reject him...thats much harder to answer. I may it really all depends on my feelings for him. If I liked him I wouldn't reject him. Hope this helped.|`|YyMFDs6Eaa	well..i have the most up to date answer...this guy texted my best friend and asked her for my number and then he texted me and said that he liked me and now we've been talking and stuff    i think it's really sweet and no i will NOT reject him    btw--he texted me last night :)
c9Zohfw2aa	Well if you want to go out with her or at least have her as a good friend then you'll have to tell her the truth. Tell her that you were scared she wouldn't like you. In order to find the right person later in life you are going to have to get use to a little rejection if that is the case. She might really like you but since it was you who told no she, probably thinks don't like her. Your going to  have to explain it TRUTHFULLY to her. Good Luck|`|InCpu9Vfaa	you shoulda said yea    girls like to think that somebody likes them    it makes them feel all special|`|IN1wPKwoaa	you blew it.|`|hRXGHnnNaa	Idiot... who cares if you get rejected? Do you have less of a girlfriend if you do? No, you have less of a girlfriend only if you p*ssy out.|`|exHroh8Maa	just tell her! the worst that will happen is she doesn't like you. & there are plenty of other girls. if you don't tell her, you may never know how she feels about you. & she may be just as scared of rejection as you. go for it :)|`|VcIg1R1zaa	oh,man.you screwed up.well,firstly,you own an apology to your friend.  then find the guts nad tell her.sorry i lied to you the other day.i really like you but i was shy to tell you.don't hesitate!you already blew it!try to make things better!|`|3L4fPlpmaa	you should have said yes then she would of probably asked you out.  girls mainly expect guys to ask them out so don't expect her to do that|`|t58tRjwbaa	that was dumb. confidence is hott in a guy, and u have none. you should have told her, but not thrown yourself at her! i would call her, and tell her that you do like her, but be confident!|`|NK9EA2QKaa	ouch sorry man. if you want another shot at it then get her a cute necklace, go up to her like between classes, and then just say " yesterday i said i didn't like you. that was a lie and i really hope we can be more than friends." see how it works out|`|xGCXCNbRaa	don't let her go! you'll regret it!
0utZQuyeaa	Never, ever fear rejection. To me personally, that's one of the worst things you can fear. If you're always afraid of being rejected, your inner spirit & bubbliness & wonderful personality will never shine thru & you'll be living like you're in a shell, afraid to come out. Don't fear it; the worst thing anyone can say is no. And you'll eventually come to realize that "no" isn't the end of the world, & time will ALWAYS make things better.    Soon you'll be living in peace & not fear!    Sorry for the rant.    Anyway, do not worry about this incident with the girl. If you're feeling brave enough, maybe you should explain to her exactly why you said no, & what you actually meant [[yes]]. She was expecting you to say yes--she probably feels weirded out & confused by the fact that you said no. Just tell her the truth so her mind isn't constantly running in circles over why you said the opposite of what your friend (or ex-friend) told her.     We all have crappy days. Yours happened to be pretty horrible too, but look on the bright side, you still have tomorrow, or however long you want, to make things right. The sun'll come out tomorrow. :] I've no doubt about it.    Cheer up and dry your damp eyes!    xo|`|zowIvMToaa	just tell her you like her  even if you just said you didnt|`|0W9KRv1taa	just build up the courage to tell her. maybe she likes you back you know? why would she ask you if she doesnt like u back. just tell her that you do liek her and when u said no it was just cuz u were afraid that she would rejct you. and if she does reject you tell her that its all good and that hopefully u giys are still friends|`|Vzwo52doaa	well that really sucks. try pulling her aside and just telling her that you do like her but you got nervous when she asked then just say its fine if you don't have the same feelings. Just play it cool, don't be embarrassed. Girls are sensitive and she may be hurt that you said no. When she asked if you liked her she may have been hopping that you would say yes, she may like you to. Don't worry about what she MIGHT think because she probably won't think it. Good luck!!!! xoxo- Zoey|`|6WOTC3eDaa	please tell her the truth i liked this guy in fouth grade and i did not want to tell him but know i finily told him and he liked me back and we  became really good friends

I wouldn't worry about it right now. The girl wants what you have that is all. You have him not her.|`|AA11852242	you know silence is the best answer. eventually shell fade away as long as hes not talking or responding to her. shes harmless and mad. but we all get over things. he sounds like a good guy most men wouldnt have called the other woman on 3 way so let her play herself out.|`|uuMCGT9taa	grow up and realize you have him so don't worry about TALK ! just enjoy ur bf and ur time     dont worry about this girl she is just wasted time !
S5QsLZwwaa	nope|`|zilDPnu8aa	Sorry I don't think he likes you
9Sy4Fefdaa	Then get over him.|`|FWsv3Schaa	just look for someone else. if its meant to be, its meant to be. if this other guy is really the one for you then things WILL work out. give it time and move on      answer mine on my page?|`|60b0d42c3c92dec6d976704c90ee8eb5aa	You`d get over him almost overnight if you met someone else who equally excited you.   There are millions of people in the world - the sooner you forget him and move on, the more likely you are to meet someone else.  It is a bit pathetic to pine over someone who is in love  with someone else and who you know you can never have.    Have you no pride? Even he will  begin to pity you if you go on like this.|`|zRtOplYtaa	good luck hun  im in the same position  but im with some1  the feelings dont go away  but u just got 2 live with it  even though it drives me mad!!  in time ur gona heal  u wont even know he exsisted  good luck :)  x|`|Gc4mSSNOaa	first, before you tell a guy you like him try do find out if they are single or not. I know it's not easy but the more effort saves you. Try to just relax with  your friends and try not to worry about a guy right now. Don't worry, one day if he is  meant for you, you will know, The right guy will come!|`|X1d5mCtUaa	I'm sorry, that must be really hard. Its so difficult to get over someone you really like, I completely understand. But being friends with him might not be such a great idea because just being around someone you like will make you like them more. If possible, try to cut off all contact with him so you don't think about him all the time (thats what I'm trying to do, but I have to work with him...so its not going too well). But try to put more focus on your relationships with friends and maybe some other guys to distract you. I'm not saying you should date someone else as your "rebound," but just to distract yourself from him. Eventually your love will fade for him, even though it may not feel like that. But maybe they will break up at some point. But that doesn't mean you should wait around for that to happen. Go live your life and maybe some day you will see each other again and be together. But don't wait around for that to happen. Best Wishes : )|`|BxANXLK9aa	Just move on! Apparently he isn't your perfect guy, or he would be with YOU and not with his girlfriend!|`|3F99VN4Zaa	I have been the guy in the scenario that your speaking of. the girl in your shoes is still one of my best friends. just hating me would do nothing more than burn the bridge on our friendship. She started dating one of my friends (who is like me...sorta) they have been together for 2 years now. Im not saying go bang this guys buddy. but dont ditch your friend, just let him know that you dont want things to be weird, and just have fun. it will work itself out.  mitch!|`|YsYq7BJzaa	just tell him how u feel and that ur srry u ever bothered him and try 2 forget him|`|lnTwJiN0aa	I know the feeling, believe me! The way I got over it is just tell yourself constantly that I won't happen, and if it does, all the better. When you start thinking about him, just distract yourself with anything. Tell yourself you are better than that and you don't need a guy to make you happy. This is coming from a girl who once upon a time couldn't survive without male attention for more than an hour. It will take a long time and it will be hard, but you cannot give up! Trust me, I am so much happier now that I am independent and I don't need to rely on others for my own happiness!    Hope I helped!
n7hezV5aaa	Ok, first of all the fact that you were so confused over whether you wanted to be with him or not means that you were not ready to get into a relationship with him in the first place. Once you did, though, I really don't think you should have listened to what other people told you. I mean, sometimes other people can't tell how you feel about somebody and it seems as if your friend and her boyfriend might have influenced your decision on whether you liked him or not.     Anyway, what's done is done and I think it's really responsible of you to not want to hurt him again and trying to keep him away from you since it's obvious that he has feelings for you and he wants to keep you in his life no matter what.     There's no right or wrong here. As long as you make your feelings clear to yourself first and then to him then you can both decide on whether or not you'd like to stay friends. I'm afraid that if he has feelings for you he'll always hope that you might give him a third chance though. Just talk to him if this is really bothering you and make the decision together.
laXJxrZOaa	i think you really like him.  i'm not sure if it's love tho.  I think you should talk to him more and then you two might get together , but  i'm sure he feels the same way about you from what your friends say.  Thanks for answering my question :D  how hard do you mean tho?|`|Ssn0ojAGaa	Hi most people feel this way about a person. I saw it is a crush. Like one of my friends said she loved this guy from work. But it was infacturation, not love. She said this after. If ye are good friends then it could be love. But I think most people know when they are in love. They seem so happy.    If you never felt this way about a person before then I think you should take a chance. It depends, what age you are if your friends are O.K with it. If you are like 15 it could be just emotions starting up. If you are in your 20s, well you are more sure of your emotions.    None the less friends come first and you should make sure she is O.K with it.    Take it slow, true love is patient. And if you are young, take into account that ye have more hormones than adults and be careful.    Good Luck    Edit: That is an O.K age. If your friends are O.K with it then go on a few dates with the guy. No harm in that. Sometimes people think somebody is perfect for them. But after a few dates you might realise he is not for you. Just take it slow. The fact that he is your friends brother means he would be careful not to upset you or jerk you around.|`|1keH3R6paa	Hmm, maybe.
AA12255473	reminds me of a fat hairy guy that wears sweats and his belly sticks out.|`|IQfaj1BGaa	i think of it as a funny but good name  something that'll make me laugh and smile    haha larry :]
tCiVuFK9aa	There is nothing to feel guilty about.  You are enjoying yourself sexually and know your turn ons.  Don't mention this to your husband though.  We all know how sensitive they can be when it comes to their sexual prowess. Think how you would feel if he told you that he got turned on by someone with the opposite body shape as yours.  Wouldn't it make you jealous and or wonder if that's what he is really looking for? Somethings really are better left unsaid.  Red|`|AXbdNdPzaa	I think you are quite normal.  I have no idea how your hubby would react to that disclosure.  I have never said anything to my hubby (ex) about that.  I just know I don't want to hear if he likes someone that looks a lot different than me.  It might make me feel like I am not pleasing him.|`|5jMNBO2naa	by the fact that both of you are watching  means he enjoys seeing well endowed guy plowing some chick  and that's part of the porn fantasy  he would like the be the big guy ( name the porn stud )  and that means all that it encompasses  he knows where he ranks among them, he know he as not as big, cannot last as long and so on  so if you get aroused by it, it's not big deal  as he does the same|`|uvWuVWb1aa	How would you feel if you were a B cup and he said "Babe, I love seeing women with D cups. I just love it.. it turns me on. Wanna watch it online with me?!" It would hurt you. Even though you're not small.. it would still sting to hear that. It's a secret turn on, and there's nothing wrong with keeping it that way. Plus, most men don't have any interest at watching other men or looking at them.|`|VHA9qrVSaa	Very normal here.  I don't see anything wrong in what you are desiring.  Men like seeing big boobs on other women.  Same with women admiring a large dick.  I don't see that there is a problem with it.  Enjoy|`|05NIkjy6aa	My wife is the same way, and she told me.  It doesn't bother me at all.     I like to look at nude female internet sites such as Playboy.    Unrealistically large breasted women versus unrealistically large man.  Of course the large ones of either sex look better.  That's why they were put there, because they do look better.      I think its cool for her to have turn-ons like that.  After she has been looking at these men, especially if I encouraged her--"Wow, look at that monster!"--she can't get me undressed fast enough.    I'm sure not complaining.|`|1epjqrflaa	UMMMMM NOOOO... This is not ok to tell your husband, and I guarantee if you do , your sex life will never be the same. Keep this to yourself, some things are better off  kept a secret. Watch your BIG members when your alone.|`|AA10377289	not unless if your husband is gay then he'll love looking at big genitals.never tell a guy that you like other guys genitals. its like saying that your fat or it gives guys the image of you wanting a larger one.. then you dont want him to stop and get stuck with the image of you having sex with someone else. also it give guys the image that he will never ever satify you, or live up to the hype. its like that. guys are build that way. its pride and ego.|`|NbEqE9xJaa	i dont know of any "normal" guy who would want to hear this from their wife.   and as a woman i have no interest in looking at huge guys. never did and most likely wont happen anytime either.|`|OuU9Emkxaa	Yes This is perfectly normal! Dont let anyone tell you otherwise! I think sharing your secrets is great and if u tell him, he might see what he can do for you. Unlike some men Im very lucky, with a girlfriend and a 14 inch member.:)
TShsb3EXaa	If he likes you he won't care.
WBanIZmpaa	just because your autistic thats not the reason youve never had a girlfriend its your shyness. just be yourself and try and have fun with girls you know meet there friends and you'll find someone you like and ask her out. i know plenty of people that are autistic, it doesn't affect their dating life, its just the shyness in you|`|QvSwo3X9aa	Depends on how well you control your symptoms. If you are shy you could try first dating girls with similar disabilities who understands what you are going through. Sites like http://www.disaboom.com/ could help you network.|`|tsdHndRhaa	yeah there are some open minded women out there and as long as your not a severe case you have a a chance, or maybe you can find a girl  similar to you and that way you have an understanding.
180db111cb7c264e5bd192d677bd9c1faa	Hi Meg.  Sorry to hear that you are having a conflict with your parents.  Unfortunately, we parents don't get instruction manuals when we begin having babies, so most of us don't realize that each of our children are different, separate little human beings that possess their own individual personalities.  I only had one son, because of that, but my mother had three of us and was so confused when the second child didn't adhere to the same sleep schedule as I did, nor was he a particularly happy baby.      Most parents think one child will be pretty much like the other and therefore what worked with one should work for the next.  They also think that what one is adept at, the next one should be also.      In your question you note that you are more popular and more athletic than your brother.  Those traits are just as admirable as your brother's intelligence and maturity.  You're different people and it only makes sense that you have different skills.      The only thing I can suggest is to have a talk with your parents.  (I know, probably not a fun or easy thing to do.)  This time though I would suggest that you write down what you want to say to them, about you being a separate individual with your own set of admirable traits.  You know your folks best so try and imagine the kinds of comments that they may give you and then write out possible responses to those as well.  Don't forget to tell them how being compared to your brother makes you feel.  And if they have a problem with how you feel, let them know that you are allowed to have feelings.      Practice what you write a little and then select a good time to call a meeting with just them.  Remember to be firm, but polite and respectful during your talk with them.  Nothing ticks a parent off and closes up their ears faster than hurling blame and curses at them.      I wish you good luck.|`|q0A4enABaa	I am a dad of my only child, my son. It sounds like your parents are trying to motivate you in some strange way. While you are aggravated at their constant comparisons it is probably that they don't have anything coming from you to help them compare your skills. Be more open with your folks. Let them know how you are doing and any special accomplishments you have made. I think your parent are starved for your attention. So they have to get it anyway they can. Lighten up and let your parents know what is going on in your life so they can start in on the next sibling comparing them to you!

YWdNTZU3aa	not enough info|`|ZlgRne3caa	You should say hi to her.     I'm a firm believer that you can't like or love somebody until you know them. She could think you're interesting and that's why she pays attention (or she's being nice). Otherwise she could think that you're cute but doesn't know how to come up and talk to you.  Either way start something casual as you're leaving class like, "Wow that lecture was boring" or just something like that.|`|ucQyVlZGaa	It sounds like she is flirting. Make a move anad see what happens. It doesn't hurt to try.
XiiJQkLQaa	Let me tell you first you are a total FOOL if you think making him 'miss you' will get his loser cheating *** back. Why in the hell would you want to make a fool of yourself AGAIN!? You must be very young and gullible because real women wont put up with that $hit. Hope you grow up soon before these type of relationships become a habit for you....|`|VAI6MtPIaa	How do you know he didn't cheat on you with her before breaking up with you? Also, being he cheated on her with you... there's always a chance he'll cheat on you.     I think you need someone else! You deserve someone better and someone who doesn't want to play games. You can always leave him.. just have courage =)|`|ldIoOkYbaa	dude, this guy sounds like a prick, why would you want him back?!    anyway, if you want him to miss you (don't bother) then just text him saying "obviously you're not too fussed about "us" anymore so i'm not going to bother with you anymore"    this will make him think "**** man, she doesn't give a **** anymore" and then he'll work extra hard to get your attention again, because guys are dumb like that :p  xoxo|`|6AboqlTOaa	i am going through exactly that at the moment but you deserve better than him thats what im learning to deal with and i no you may feel like you want him back but let him see you can be happy with or without him  if he wants you he will come and get you you just gotta ask yourselff if you gunna let him treat you that way!!!!!   good luck and remember to stay strong x x x|`|ETTEaxVeaa	Well, apart from the fact that this bloke seems like a right user (plus once a cheater, always a cheater-if he cheated on her what makes you think he'll be loyal to you?) if you really MUST try to be with him the best way to get his attention is to play hard to get. Men don't want desperate women that jump at their every call. If he wants to meet up, be busy with your wonderful exciting life-even if you re sitting at home watching paint dry!!!!  I was seeing my now husband from the age of 18 and for several years he messed me around something chronic. I was absolutely smitten over him and would answer his every call and text and was desperate to be with him. During this time he dumped me, made me second best and basically made me feel crap. Then I realized I didn't need him-got on with my life for a couple of years during which time he decided that actually he totally loved me and wanted to marry me. All in all we were on again off again for 10 years! But now we are happily married totally together and totally trusting of each other. It takes time for people to grow up, and part of that is showing the bloke you like that you don't NEED him, you WANT him! But as you don't NEED him you'll be getting on with having fun, while he learns that he WANTS you!!!

eO4y3m1maa	I think its worth a risk if you like him, and if he is rude....just say something smart back to him.....about him being pathetic and defensive.
dGL5xCrqaa	I agree with you, bjs are disgusting and he definitely shouldn't be pressuring you, that is not okay. It's a sign that he doesn't respect you. If he's doing something that like within the first month of a relationship it says a lot about his personality, you are so much better than that and you deserve a guy who will appreciate you for everything you belief and hold true to yourself.|`|7ee11f32ce402e558134b3f3e6323823aa	Not a guy, I am a fan of bjs..but this isn't really about bjs.    He should respect you and your wishes and NOT pressure you. I think you should reconsider your relationship with such a man. Sex is supposed to be fun , not like that. And you should wait until you are ready (and with a good man).|`|lHzBJA4eaa	You'll grow out of that.In the mean time enjoy your childhood.|`|yxoXTmlqaa	I don't mind.

It's a big deal to guys because they like watching a girl down there and it also feels good.  It also helps with lubrication prior to sex.  It's all a part of foreplay.  If the guy is stimulating the girl, orally or manually, then the girl should want to return the favor.      Since you and your boyfriend haven't been together all that long though and you are a virgin, i can understand why you are a little against it.  Let him know that you aren't ready to do that and don't know if you ever will be.  If he wants a bj, break up with him.  Find a guy who doesnt care just about that, they are out there|`|gr8Oc9c9aa	If I were you, I would break up, he may force it upon you, you don't need to if you don't want to, he's just a kind of person who is consumed by sex and misses the true point of love.     It is not a big deal, I would never tell my girlfriend to do that, it's pretty messed up. And if he can't accept that you don't want to, he can go hit the road.|`|SyHmExgtaa	I agree with you...I'm disgusted by it as well and I will not do it and if your boyfriend really loves you he will understand (mine did).|`|71VRvldJaa	If oral sex isn't your thing, don't do it!......end of story!  Besides the fact you don't want to do it, you've only been with him less than a month and you shouldn't be involved in ANY sexual activities at this stage.  It's a big deal for guys, especially young guys because they are hormonal and are functioning on brain stem and hormones!  Many think that if the girl won't have intercourse that oral sex is a good substitute or compromise.  Don't do it!|`|5613b2f0e3965fc16a2ce3623c6c5a78aa	for most guys and girls oral sex is about the greatest thing and in time i think as you get older you will think differently but time for you and his respect for your feelings now is important. i suggest maybe at this point of time  what is called a handj$$ or you using your hands to get him off may be ok. also i strongly suggest if and when you do decide to try it make sure he and you both recently showered as this may help your thoughts about it.xxxx|`|mvAgLB9laa	You don't know what you're missing in both giving and recieving oral. it's another form of affection and both people should enjoy it.   Don't go through life with a closed mind.  No risk - No reward  and it feels just amazing|`|89650e173bc5a587806fdebc36366a40aa	1. It feels good.  2. It makes us feel closing to the woman....|`|0VSYYddPaa	do it or he will beat you|`|8KMdXKTLaa	A BJ is another sign of affection, if you're not giving sex...you're going to need to compromise. When you actually start doing it, it's not as disgusting as it seems.|`|smyhq0Ggaa	Do you ever expect him to perform oral on you? Cause its got to go both ways.    And we like it because it feels amazing.|`|b2lDXdL5aa	feels good man|`|rbloxE6paa	I love giving them because my boy loves it, and tells me I'm great at it ; )|`|Kvw5YFqMaa	Yes there are guys out there that don't like them.  But in my opinion if you are not ready to have sex then you are not ready for oral sex.  Oral sex is still a form of sex and if you are not ready then he should be supportive.  If he is not supportive then leave him you can do better.|`|Q8tf4B5taa	yes there are some guys that are more into making you happy rather than them and thats what makes them happy if you know what i mean :)|`|HjgeyVpiaa	uh....you have to give bjs its in the girl code..you cant have a boyfriend without blowing him....|`|ckjZnqHRaa	..probably somewheres there's a guy who doesn't care about getting a BJ darlin....but you'd be hard pressed to find him really!  It's a guy thing Daisy...so don't worry about it if you don't wanna do this kind of thing for him seemingly.....it's your mouth and body to preserve hun...not somebody elses!|`|jIpzOQGTaa	The BJ is wonderful in that is a completely unique experience, one that can never be duplicated. It is also a selfless act on the woman's part, making it that much more meaningful for him. And yes, it feels that good. If really don't wan't to, you don't have to and he should respect that. But, as I say about most things in life, try it once and if you hate it you never have to do it again. Or maybe just give him a handy.|`|1tmNzoGvaa	No matter what, a guy will always feels somewhat bummed out knowing his gf won't give him BJs....but then it depends on the guy if such a thing will cause him to lose interest in you. Personally, I dont care about the limits my gf has with those things....sure I might feel bummed out knowing I might not get a BJ for a while until she feels comfortable (or she might never be)...but it wont cause me to throw a tantrum or complain about it.     But yeah..to sum everything up...all guys feel bummed when they know they will miss out on something like this but whether or not it will actually affect the relationship differs.|`|moywPwODaa	i thought it was nasty too for the longest time and told myself i would never do ittt..then last month i did it for the first time and its really not gross at all. you dont even think about it when your doing ittt..its funn now. ahah|`|bszyOuIqaa	Good luck finding a guy who doesn't want a bj! I could see why you wouldn't want to do it with some random dude but in a loving trusting relationship you probably won't find it that disgusting.|`|eYuIsNk1aa	well the its because it feels good just like when a women get oral from a guy  bottom line if you don't want to then don't but don't be on here a month from now asking why he left you & is with some slut ... but really don't do anything your not comfortable with & if you do make him wear a condom because you can still get STD's
vOTcVMsdaa	She may have a crush on you and is trying to get you to notice her.    I remember when I would try to get a guys attention in school I would always say hi to him (especially if this was out of the ordinary), I remember when he would walk in front of me I would lightly kick his backpack to get his attention. Girls do little things just to get the guys reaction.    I would say, give it some time. I know you don't want to make a fool of yourself especially since you'll see her practically every day. Keep an eye on her.  Find out if she has a boyfriend.     Later on you can invite her to go to a movie, go out for pizza, go to the mall, etc. If you want, you can get a small group to go so you're not totally alone and put on the spot.    Yeah, if she just started to talk to you out of no where, there must be a reason behind it.    Girls are weird lol. Everyone fears rejection so they skirt around the issue.    Good luck!!!|`|0WfsZ7lCaa	not enough info|`|jlZZbdIjaa	I think its just a friendly thing maybe she wants to go out maybe not|`|RBGc1Hytaa	It sounds like she's interested in you, which is why she randomly is talking to you out of no where. I'd say ask her out- she'll most likely say yes.|`|3ZhwIAn1aa	ask her out and find out|`|AsFiWxhUaa	a girl likes a guy that has confidence so if you like her ask her out. besides you will never know what she is going to say if you do not ask! best of luck!|`|JKegoMVPaa	Maybe, maybe not. I need more to go on.|`|EqQJqYAWaa	Try talking to her more and hanging around her to pick up some hints. Then make your move.|`|Q8CS0x0Kaa	She might does. I would give it a shot.|`|H7BHurpiaa	maybe.. try talking to her more online, texting then once you have talked a little more ask her out. If she says no oh well its not worth getting upset about  =]|`|XdqvvLaiaa	Get to know her more, you sure dont want to scare her by asking her out just because she's being nice. Get to her heart boyy :)|`|f7l9byFGaa	sounds to me that she has some interest in you.  But whether it's a friendship or boyfriend she is looking for, I am not sure.  It all depends on how she said hi to you, did she say it with a smile or just a casual hi.  Start talking to her one day and maybe flirt a little to show her you have some interest in her.  If she flirts back then just go for it and ask her out.|`|bTz6v43Kaa	you cant ask her out just going by that.see if she tries to talk to you more|`|Isgw44BMaa	She's either being really friendly, or she wants to get to know you more. I would say get to know her better first, keep the conversations going with her and see where it goes from there.|`|EIP0Fuylaa	She might like you.  You can either ask her out now, but I would suggest flirting some more and see what she does.  If she seems more and more interested Suggest hanging out or something small.|`|FigWzRMdaa	If I were you I would go for it. Sounds to me like she'd into you. We really aren't as hard to read as guys like we are. GO FOR IT!!  GOOD LUCK and hope everything works out for you!!|`|YI7xsvGYaa	maybe ask her to hang out with you in a group first.|`|bQ2p0aa5aa	well take it by steps n c how she reacts to things....like tell her she smells good...she has nice eye or smile...ummm does she laugh wen u say sumtin corney?? does she ever blush around u??? can she keep eye contact??? if not does she turn around n blush or turn n roll her eyes or jus turn??? i need more info that is not enough also age matters to how old is she??? email me at nyni18@yahoo.com il help but need more info sorry
s0ZgpQDcaa	You are not paranoid (well maybe a bit, but your feelings are grounded). She needs to tell him to stop all dirty contact with her. When she allows him to do this, she is still having a feelings for him, or she is afraid he will get angry. Assure her that in the latter case you will back her up, in the first case there is no other alternative but to force her into a decision. you should not allow her to mess around.    You need to have a serious talk with her about what she wants, if she thinks this is a problem, how you feel, how she feels, and how to continue. Make sure this stays a conversation, not an argument! You are not angry with her, but you want to solve a problem!
AA10033367	There is a book called "How to Win Friends and Influence People".  It's worth reading.     One of the things the book teaches is that if you want people to like you, you have to show you like them.  Take an interest in them.  Ask them questions about themselves.  Most people love to talk about themselves.  Listen to them.|`|7KDL9Wo3aa	Be kind, and don't act like your better than anyone because people don't like that. Also, be yourself. Good luck!|`|xZSRDNVOaa	if they dont like you for who they are then you shouldnt want to gain their liking anymore- but if you made them not like you then tell them you were wrong
PmZIiP8jaa	Talk to your friends and tell them whats been going on and that your not comfortable with her. Don't expect them to dump her as a friend though because people will choose their friends. Just because there is someone new doesn't mean you should feel left out. Just tell them hwo you feel and make sure they know that they shouldn't believe anything she says to them about you unless you say it is true. If your friends actually replace you with her then they weren't that great of friends and you should move on and find better ones!|`|S9s5zX1naa	you should talk to your closest friend about this and how you feel.   try talking to her, and tell her she may not be trying to, but is hurting your feelings. she might just be big on grudges. if your other friends are true, they'll always understand how you feel. it works with my friends!|`|RWgjnwl9aa	Honestly this is where you have to rely on your best friends who really know you best to  come to your defense  if they're really good friends to you  this is what true friendship is all about I havr a best friend & I will always stick by her|`|3y0w1qIBaa	You need to talk to your friends about this.  I think she is the cause and that's why she is stealing all of your friends.|`|7KDL9Wo3aa	Talk to your friend. Tell her your sorry about what's been going on, and you really miss the friendship between you two. Since she talks about you behind your back, calmly ask her why. Say, "I'm not mad, but why would you talk about me behind my back?" Be nice to her, and be calm. Maybe you have been doing something to annoy her or hurt her in the past months. If she still is being rude about this and your other friends aren't doing anything about it either, maybe you should make new friends who respect you.
m3RGMBcTaa	That sucks. I kind of have the reverse. Wicked step-monster (stepmom). I have two half sisters (6 and 2) and they're pretty wicked too (not really the 2 year old). Me and my dad are pretty close and my mom lives nearby so i get to see both my parents; i can escape to my moms house when dad's gets too crazy, but I digress. I was always really nice to my stepmom and tried to help her out with chores and everything but she was always just so nasty! I was finally so fed up that i gave her hell. I screamed I HATE YOU like everyday, stopped doing all my chores and interacting with the family, kind of went on a hunger-strike and would glare at her every time she even looked at me. This was all okay because my dad was usually on my side and understood where i was coming from. If you don't have a parent on your side then i wouldn't suggest this but it kind of worked for me. Hope your family situation gets better. Sometimes you have to act irrationally to get yourself herd. By the way, does your mom know how you feel? If you first try to suggest to her in a mature way, the way you are feeling than she might respect your opinion more.|`|Y5nrrPO8aa	just tell your mom, im sure she's not going to like her kids complaining and im also sure she's going to want the best for her kids, so just talk to her and tell he she could find someone better.|`|IlndnVyBaa	your mom is very weird. Why doesn't she stay with your real dad????|`|nltFZcuGaa	hook him up with a different girl.|`|CKHzrI7Waa	Sorry but I think your Mom has to do this.|`|6Mm3KV6iaa	when your mom is out of the room tell him the bad things your mother and you do gross him out if that doesn't wrok or when they are in the middel of -sex- then come into the room don't look suprised and say damm lock the door next time
inDtog6Maa	Go shopping with him and asks if he likes the outfits you choose for him.. I think as a boyfriend he will accept the outfit that you chose.. but soon he will still have to realize that his dress codee isn't that great|`|IjpJanM0aa	Hes your bf?  Should it matter how he dresses?  You should love him no matter what =/  Shouldnt worry about is freaking close so much|`|tzzYdnZKaa	I have that exact same problem but I just ignore it!
9fAHd15Caa	i get the feeling your too young to have a boyfriend, I'd say be honest with him...
W0XoDxJraa	women. Women are more beautiful than men, they face harsher "competition" and pressure to look good. They also have to deal with testosterone and things like porn. Men are also more picky on how their woman acts or looks. Women like a man as long as he is presentable or cleanly shaved or whatever.... men want the whole make up, hairless, beautician lark or whatever.  That aside, I'm not too sure from a man's perspective. Men have to take on the role of the provider, protector and if they're not too well endowed they may have anxiety or something.|`|GTeGDGzKaa	The woman    ........|...  ........|..........SteveC ..........|||"|""\__  ........|__________________|||_|___|)  ........!(@)'(@)""""**!(@)(@)****!(@)|`|0mhcCyE5aa	Men have it tough because normally they have to make the first move.    Women have it tough because, at least for me, I never know if the guy wants a relationship with me or just wants sex!!!!!|`|TMAq2m7Gaa	Below age 30 the man, above age 30 the woman.|`|5fdgfNCRaa	Sorry guys, the woman does.  I suppose it differs for some, but I honestly believe women have it much harder than men.|`|pPhy6JVDaa	Gregory took the words out of my mouth..by the time you're 30, you don't give a shiitt and tell the woman what you want..if they don't like it then they can BEAT IT!!  You're old enough to know they are LOTS of fish in sea and in your 30's, you can bang 20 year olds or 40 year olds...and of course, that comes out as being confident and that's when the women start opening up their legs for you    So to ans. your question, below 30 Men have it worse and girls  have it good...above 30 the MAN has the advantage|`|SLeX0gGaaa	I think the women. Men are so confusing.|`|fFcgBUjyaa	The woman!  cuz we worry what the lad thinksz and want to look great and that  where the guy doesnt really seem to care much!|`|PgQ3Lr9Yaa	the woman cuz she gets all worried if the guy will call her and when they will hang out and she feels ignored by the guy if he doesn't talk to her and its pretty difficult to deal with all that crap...|`|0fhCbS7Daa	i believe both.
e5f4c192231c92a0d059825b151f7553aa	If she`s otherwise totally sweet - not at all.    If she is a nasty piece of work, then it just adds to the total.|`|ffPla5WDaa	not at all.|`|BxCerdxlaa	my boyfriend hates it . it makes ur finger nails like sink into ur skin and it looks gross|`|tWoMhPq8aa	honestly to alot of guys yes. if you didnt notice guys including me for some reason like hands and toes alot. its a guy thing i guess.
J30kfJpQaa	wow, he is dumb. avoid him since he is lying to you.|`|SehQJ3Kjaa	That isn't considered tickled! Talk to him a little more about it!
kqa9VFrfaa	Abuse is ANYTHING that the woman does NOT want to do. Period. If a woman says she enjoys getting beat up, she is deceiving herself, or covering up for an abusive relationship. I used to do domestic counseling.|`|LykjWv6faa	It's only abuse if the girl says 'no' and doesn't want sex with a man. Rough sex is consensual, but, due to it's nature, there may be bruising.|`|nDQOwAA3aa	the same difference as rape and sex you want one you don't want the other|`|f4c627930425c195d32f7d5a1017131aaa	Rough sex is consensual. Some women like the pain & bruising. Abuse is abuse - she didn't ask for it.|`|Bu2asnXFaa	Consent.|`|4HoVVCenaa	Consent is the difference.
sipXnwifaa	Listen to music, it always helps me, if you need any suggestions just add details saying you do and ill give you some good choices based on what music you like, so just tell me what music you like.  Mmk, got your email, well, as far as music goes here are my choices:  I have different mood settings so hope you like them:    For a "im tough as nails" and you shouldnt have stopped loving me look on it:  Gives You Hell-AAR    I want you back look on it:  I wont go home without you-Maroon 5    Country music, which i know you dont like, but i dont like much country either and this still catches my ear:  Trying to stop your leaving-Dierks Bentley    Confused feelings, but ill still be here waiting for you in the end:  You and I both-Jason Mraz    Classic 90s music:  When its over-Sugar Ray    Really deep and slightly dark look on the situation:  I miss you-Blink 182    I really want you and i'll do anything for you!:  Echo-Trapt  Madi Don't Leave-PlayRadioPlay!
Kp6JYaMAaa	aww....you have to find the right girl that understands you and isnt so superficial.... good luck :)|`|9CUaikUEaa	instead of meeting girls in bars and clubs, make friends with them first and then once you start flirting a bit more, and are taking it slow then they might have real feelings for you and want to date you.
qWc7gsR8aa	just be open and honest and tell him exactly how you feel, if he really likes you he'll listen and (i wanna say "understand" but it sounds like i'm saying there's something wrong with that but there isn't). hope that helped!|`|htaxf1jJaa	a freshman and junior isn't bad at all. i think you should give him a try...do you really know what he wants? but if he wants something that isn't what you want then don't make yourself in an unhappy position because you really like the guy.|`|b538976641cc2a50041772f307796f66aa	Start with boundaries. Tell him your boundaries on the first date. Be honest. Say you want to take it slow.|`|ZOcoyJD3aa	yea i am not going to do what she doesn't want to do|`|DjMTnSxmaa	hey!    if you dont want to do the same thing as him he should respect it! if not he is not worth it ;-)  but i think u should go out with him...see how it goes u know!|`|reQPwY6Saa	I had to deal with this when I was a freshman too. Go out with him, but your definitely not ready for sex or anything close for a while. If he tries to make you do ANYTHING you feel uncomfortable with, it is clear that he doesn't truly care about you and he just wants you for his own reasons. If he really likes you, he will respect you!! Simple as that.|`|EvQT1RF1aa	Well I'm a guy, but I'm gonna answer this the best I can, when he asks you out, say yes, and if he tries to go too far, just say you're not ready. And if he tries to do it again, and again, break up with him...  and for me, yes I would understand if my girl didn't want to do anything with me, I would actually respect her much, much more for telling me!|`|WxU5HXTiaa	what kind of stuff does he want if he wants your body then you need to decide if your gonna stay a virgin or not. i say there are better guys out there so go 4 1 of them. happy 2 help
etrLu8Xnaa	u might not wanna rush into it. wait maybe a few days. when u wanna ask him out just start a casual convo and be like so i heard that u liked me is it true? or u could ask a few more ppl what they think of the situation. boys r usually transparent and u could tell that they like u most of the time but anyways go for the guy!!!!!
CX0GNveYaa	R u seriously asking this question.  He pretty much treats you like s***.  So you break him and make him feel like s***.  Sorry but your bf need to grow some balls and learn how to treat a girl right.
q3rDROxgaa	well when some one likes u u can feel it if u feel he likes you then he probly does|`|J3fFR3Wuaa	sounds like he likes you|`|yj3GT7jOaa	Check your toes.  If they stink, then he still likes you and just got used to smell from hanging around so much.  If your toes don't stink and he is still there, then you need to start checking for other clues as to why he may like you.|`|htMOl3c4aa	how the hell are we supposed to know? why don't you ask him?|`|pbMpMRmLaa	i think he  absolutely likes you as a friend now. probably more because why would he smile at you all the time, borrow your calculator and talk about nothing all the time. and without more information i cant really say more. i would flirt and see what happens.    hope it helps :]|`|czHD5tPwaa	I'd need more information... If he borrows your calculator it could be because it's a 10 digit, Talking is just socializing, And I smile a lot... Doesn't mean I like someone.And the 'cuteness' of an individual doesn't mean you like him, it means you think he's cute. Evidence would be lovely.|`|QJu73ISQaa	Yes,he likes you!|`|kERP7zAhaa	do you guys ever talk outside of math?|`|GrtqaUInaa	i think he's interested  keep talking  within time he'll probably reallllly like you  good luck! =]]|`|xFOx8Wa2aa	It sure sounds like it!|`|Tf0WM1WMaa	It could be thats hes interested in you, but doenst like you quite yet. Get is AIM or number and start texting him, and talking to him out of math class. eventually he will get comfortable, and if he likes you he'll ask to go out with you somewhere.    goodluck girl|`|Ohlnx99Caa	I'm really not sure. You should try to eek it out of him or just straight out ask him. You don't say explicitly whether you like him or not. Do you? Because you can think someone is attractive without actually having a crush on them.|`|xZTioRSpaa	no just because he talks to u in one class dosent mean he likes u. if he always talks to u even outside of calss then yes but judging from ur info here im gonna say yall r just friends. but wat do i kno. i dont kno wat yall talk bout|`|8lDmtlOcaa	ohhhhhhhhhhhh that kid!! you like him!?     lol j/k. um. sure. he likes you.|`|GAHanGd7aa	he likes u|`|uVH046Fjaa	Oh yeah Cody I remember him, good times.|`|9580a1e44dd3d2bae7d2f867611ab353aa	? sounds like he does|`|LAcH71Ooaa	awww sounds like sumone likes u...|`|CtDBQwzaaa	maybe he could just be a friend... just wait and see  ?Jess|`|C45FOXZJaa	Sounds like he does.

GXEEvyflaa	Tell your parents about the rumor first before they hear it from some other source and just tell them it is completely false and that you know theyre still mad but this rumor is not true.   As for everyone else, just ignore it and let them forget about it. If you make a bid deal about it then theyll think something did actually happen.     good luck|`|t94CZkY2aa	As crazy as this may sound, Try talking to your parents about this whole situation, just like you are doing here. Even though they want to forget about it as you say, I believe they would appreciate open and honest communication regardless of the topic, besides it is a good way to show them that you have matured enough to be courageous and speak to them about something that is causing you concern, after all it is a reality.
0jzPpMZtaa	If your bff was asking I'd tell her no.      You should both agree to give him up.  Your friendship is more important than a crush.|`|RVzwViRyaa	i have the same problem. could you answer my question too?
cWy17SRnaa	Don't put together forever.  Everytime someone engraves that, its like a curse and they end up breaking up with them.  You should put his name and your name.  Buy something else that he likes.

Just tell her how you feel!|`|7BRJhrABaa	she's missing that from you so she does it with other guys. do your thing. take that thrown and make it all yours. and no she wouldnt do that.|`|q1pwHXrMaa	"Plays" is the only word that concerns me.    Other then that its no big deal. Do you ever find yourself flirting with other girls? Its just having fun, nothing to worry about.|`|GXEEvyflaa	All girls flirt when they're with their friends. It's just something we do. If we see an attractive guy we might smile or something but anything more than a dance would be taking it too far. It's just fun to talk about guys with your friends, and when you are out having a good time you may flirt a little with the cute guy standing over there, it's a bonding kind of thing.  But it's deffidently not anything more than lighthearted fun. If she starts acting different like being distant or picking fights then you can get worried. But im sure she is perfectly happy with you trust me.  When we goes out at night we flirts with some guys but were happiest when were alone at home with our boyfriends.   Just trust her. :)|`|zon13nY2aa	Has she always been a naturally flirtatious person? If it is a recent change of character then there may be reason for concern.    I love my bf and I would never flirt with anyone else bcoz I'm happy with my relationship and I wouldn't want him to flirt with anyone else behind my back.    You need to talk to her to find out if there's a problem. Only she can tell you what's up! x|`|AWoH1oN0aa	girls are just really flirtatious try not to let it get to ya...its normal|`|Qbc5rm1jaa	this could mean many things but i would just say that maybe she doesnt realize she is flirting|`|29ddeea7f871392bf7b17a12fc77a694aa	seriously that is the first step to her cheating, get away from her before she takes your heart apart|`|t58tRjwbaa	I'm happy with my bf, and I would never do that!|`|1R9rD6otaa	Let her know how you feel and if she acts like she doesn't care, then you should know what to do.  My boyfriend is actually almost the same, he would rather go out and have fun with his friends than to try to have fun with me.  So I know what you are feeling.|`|a193b0793e7a03094639e76b99ad9e23aa	depends what you mean by plays, but when you have a group of guys they always flirt and play up to women.  and believe it or not its same other way round too.  but as long as thats all it is then there is no harm unless its hurting someone and it obv is you.  or are you reading too much into it.|`|3ktg7iUyaa	Don't worrie about it unless if she starts to cheat on you with them. Girls are VERY flirty, trust me 3/4 of the girls in my grade are very flirty.|`|C0GsdFHraa	Maybe she doesnt realise she is doing it, it can be instinctive to some girls to do that. You have two options - you can ask her to stop it because its making you feel uncomfortable and insecure... OR you can trust her not to take this for anything more than fun and games... i dont think she thinks anything is missing otherwise she would tell you or break up with you  i think if your asking yourself that question you need to ask yourself if she has changed, you could have a long discussion about your relationship (thats what i do) i love it... it re-enforces my love for my partner- it reassures him... you might find that reassurance in this =)      good luck xxx
a9xITT0Aaa	If She Truly Liked You It Wouldn't Matter  She Would Probably Be To Happy To Think   About What Your Voice Sounds Like.. If She   Asks You Just Tell Her And If She Don't Like   You After That She Ain't Even Worth It|`|S6bsdP1Vaa	Well from my point of view I dont really care about how a guy sounds.  I would just love it he asked me out (cuz i have never personally been asked out yet) but even if i had been asked out millions of times i still would not care|`|a7b81aec51d8df49e523d067b9b07ea9aa	well i dont think it should matter what the guy sounds like. if you like him you like him and i dont think something that stupid should change the way she feels unless she is a shallow person.|`|AsFiWxhUaa	you should like someone or what do be liked for who you are as a person if they are worried about a problem like that that they are to shallow and i would not waste my time|`|diAqosiIaa	simply tell her what is wrong with you and if she really likes you she should not have a problem with it|`|zTeW6BIIaa	no, it wouldn't be a turn off. i would ask y he was talking weird and if he said that i'd be like "oh, ok".     as long as he's pretty good looking and has a good personality i would still like him. don't freak out. :)|`|8ofq9w5Oaa	Just tell her about it..Any girl who really liked you or cared about you would understand. Good Luck!|`|Tkt840aRaa	No. Not a turn off. If it's your voice its your voice man. My husband has a high squeaky laugh and I love it.|`|B0ypUuHXaa	If she really likes you, then she shouldn't be turned off by your voice. If she is, then maybe you shouldn't be dating someone that judges people by their voice.|`|tG1vTi0Daa	I dont think ur voice will stand in the way, but its a good test to see if she really likes u for u. If ur voice turns her off then she obviously doesnt like u for u. If she does really like u, she will get used to the sound of ur voice, and she wont even realize u sound different after a while.|`|IqoRBVUTaa	If she likes you, she wont care what you sound like.  Good luck!  P.s. I never approach guys, I find it easier to have them come to me. :)|`|q8vILEpfaa	WOW!!!!     Good thing this is just pretend!|`|AA11955868	I don't know really. Are you going to get better? If it's temporary you could let her know you're sick (which may be a turn off in itself).    But if the girl has liked you for a while, I imagine she knows what you sound like. Give people a little credit and don't be a big chicken.|`|hBGZYDKAaa	It's not a turn off. At least I don't think it would be. As far as the talking low thing my boyfriend talks really low alot of the time too. I got used to it. I just pay more attention when he is talking to me. Don't worry about it anyone that wouldn't date you because you have a problem with like mucus and other things you can't help isn't worth it. Just be your self!|`|xWdBGitfaa	if it was me and i knew you had something wrong then i wouldnt think anything of it. Its not really that big of a deal.|`|M9LB94FHaa	hmm well she should understand if she really likes you. maybe the doctor can prescribe something?    but i dont see whats wrong with a deep voice in a guy!|`|VygBNA0Waa	it would turn me off i would think oh wow he must be really sick|`|31a19ac8b142f41b4a9321181463876daa	i don't think it would matter...|`|EZLuUCLjaa	Okay, if I was the girl, I would not care. But that's just the way I am. I don't really care about appearances, or what's on the outside. I don't care what your voice sounds like. It's about you and your personality. I know this is majorly cliched, but that's just the way I am. Hope this helps.|`|OJJWNuDdaa	do not worry about that. find the girl who will not be "turned off" by the way you sound. dude that should have nothing to do with you and the girl you are liking or whatever.  and i know this sounds hard but if she does not want to be with you then forget about her. she probably would not be worth is anyway.!!  -good luck xoxo-|`|MMFd68ojaa	Why don't you get her e-mail first talk to her over that until your post nasal drip goes away (i've had that before not fun) and then when you can talk again, talk to her?|`|55pSqrDcaa	ummmmmm..can you get treated for that?|`|cUyxNNDGaa	Just go up and talk to her. If she doesn't like you because of that, then she isn't worth it. Trust me. But who knows, she could like you a lot. Good Luck!|`|H0HPx0kwaa	No, if I really liked the guy it wouldn't bother me.|`|ZE6XtxgZaa	If its your first time approaching the girl its not a big deal, don't go into much detail about it just let her know that you're catching a cold... and if the problem bothers you that much then i suggest you go to a physician|`|8ZcnTShVaa	it wouldn't put me off, but i would like to say you should let her know there's something wrong that way im sure she will be fine.    if she isn't then she's obviously seriously superficial so you should steer clear anyway     tj|`|FCEWa7zraa	dont even worry about your voice! i like guys for what they say, not how they sound when they say it:) and if someone is stupid enough to judge you by the way you sound, they're not even worth it lol|`|Q88a9Zpaaa	I gave this site a try ( http://tiny.cc/advice735 ) and got some good feedback on my questions there. So that's my lazy suggestion to you my friend. ;-) enjoy.|`|2HWefT0Gaa	First of all i am a girl and my voice is like low then high and people are always saying are you sick and i am like no when i was 12 and starting to go through puberty that is when it had started changing. ( now i am 22) So for me if a guy came to me that i really liked and thought was cute and his voice sounded a little wired it wouldn't bother me because my voice changes to and every one is made differently in there own way and that is what makes every one who they are. Good luck and don't worry if you were to approach this girl just go up to her with confidence and i think you will be alright. good luck to you!|`|twRGS4y6aa	i think you should tell her that you have post nasal drip in your throat and if she doesnt accept you for having that then dont waste your time, it wouldnt put me off.    Its worth a shot ay    lol  Good Luck|`|ZIZb8p48aa	Use your Mouth|`|OB45hwD8aa	ask her if she has noticed! maybe she likes it! u could tell her and she would understand, girls arent really rude unlike some boys! i ( i said 'some' )|`|UXJDU2neaa	I hope you appreciate my honesty but yes when i was younger on the dating scene it may have put me off. However let her know that you know you have a problem with your speech, then make lite of it. It is only weird if the person doesn't realise or mention the problem themselves. Say out right what you have said in your question and kind of make a light hearted comment about it and let her know you are getting it sorted. Anyway the best thing is to enjoy dating don't take it too serious if it is meant to be it is meant to be. Good Luck!
aIkwIyYqaa	Just be wearing a smile.|`|jGAFk11Jaa	Its all in the eyes.  The way a girl can look at you when she really wants something, is extremely sexy.|`|Qha8g6aoaa	I am not a guy but I know what my fiance would say. Just go up to your man and start kissing him. Kinda throw yourself on him. Even get a little aggressive if ya want. Guys love it! I think a lot of guys wish women wouldn't be so reserved sometimes!|`|GTeGDGzKaa	Seductive dancing and teasing    SteveC  ........|...  ........|..........2 Points..........|||"|""\__  ........|__________________|||_|___|)  ........!(@)'(@)""""**!(@)(@)****!(@)|`|qpAYU8Knaa	Blush, when my eyes meet her eyes and catch her looking at me..|`|z2OfsA0Jaa	just strip|`|eG7pYnGxaa	Just walk in the room, make up and hair all nice, wearing nothing but stillettos and a g-string.  My Fiance did that for me the other day and it drove me wild|`|nxh8xxQvaa	Run their hands up their legs... most likely while licking their lips. But it's always a preference. xD|`|WseLyvSpaa	"What's the sexiest thing a girl can do...without saying a word to you?"     Anything BUT "saying a word to me" is just fine. How about gently breathing in close to my ear?|`|el9wtu9Uaa	Pretty easily, If they just got on top and started going to town without saying anything that would turn me on alot.|`|cWnEia5haa	kissing me? lol i dont know. i think the thing that turns me on the most is them having an awesome personality.|`|gijsRMOsaa	i think wen she starts 2 move up on me. like wen she goin 2 my p**is wit her hand|`|X25iYK97aa	im guessing yu mean without kissing or touchin since yu dont know him or something. lol. drop something bend over n pick it up =P|`|74008e5e3a8a4192f40444bc93d2b1c2aa	Lock eyes, subtle sexy smile, and slowy start to strip....|`|AA11600805	Each guy has different things that turn them on and turn them off.To one guy seeing a girl walk around the kitchen in thong cooking may turn them on and to another guy that could be just not a turn on.To another guy a girl with hairy legs could be a complete turn on and to another that would be just plain wrong.The point I am trying to make here is some guys are turned on by the most craziest things and some are not.Each guy is different is what i am trying to say here!!|`|BbgfGk5saa	think my personal favorite is when i leave the room and come back and they're naked. Cant lose with that.
NUWdgQuraa	It's not about you.  He's acting weird around you probably because you're sending weird vibes his way.  Just move on.  Life is long.  You'll find another love of your life down the road, seriously.    Quite frankly, I think until you're the old people in "The Notebook,"  you aren't qualified to bestow that title on anyone.
yDjyqa4Daa	I believe you should have left the house. Usually women are the one who keeps the kids, so you definitely can't kick her out, cause that means leaving your baby without a home. Maybe by her seeing herself alone with a mortgage or rent. and doing things on her own she would try to be a better woman.. sometimes giving us too much just lays us back and makes us think we deserve everything.. not sayings she did something wrong cause you don't say why she was kicking you out.. something must have happened.. and if you did do something wrong.. which usually as men its the famous CHEATING.. then for respect of your kid def.. you should have left.. but  since its done already and she left... well you have legal rights to be in contact with your baby, of course that means child support etc.. but she can not deny your rights... unless she can proof you are not safe to be around .. like aggressive, drugs, alcohol etc.. but if you don't do any of those then you are good.. you just need to get info with a lawyer on which steps you need to take and your rights..     Good Luck.. Blessings for you baby..|`|KbZIsj7Caa	if you want your kids half the time, you can go to court and file for joint custody of the kids, in order to get them full time, you'll have to prove she's unfit or child endangerment.Good luck|`|X2z7mbfaaa	Relationships don't always work out we all know that. However when a child is part of the relationship things become a lot more complicated. My kid is not only my heart but my pride and joy. Do everything in your power to get your kid back. The best course of action is to call your local division of child protection services (you can find their number online or in the phone book). If all the red tape takes too long to cut through go to the source and call the police. You have just as much right as your ex does to be with your child. Good luck bro and you'll get through this. What ever you do don't give up.
QAGaQUDRaa	Sounds like he likes you...    So talk to him! :)|`|16dZsUD8aa	yes!!! but that was a total ego breaker for him|`|BJQCt30Maa	the blog was probably about you, but you just don't know it.  you should ask him to go shopping with you sometime and see what he says
YATv97Paaa	Dont ever talk to that AS*HOLE again ever! Please dont diminish yourself! Dont go even near him, that guy doesnt deserve anything from you and he probably never loved you (Sorry!)     PLZ! be a brave girl and dont DONT look for him anymore. Forget him and try to focus on other stuff. Plz (We girls dont need a relationship or guys to feel fine about us) Avoid him! Hes a total IDIOT!...and hes not even worth as a friend!|`|uVH046Fjaa	Go lesbo. 10 pts?|`|AsFiWxhUaa	FORGET about him! why would you even wanna be friends with someone who talked to you like that!|`|AA12164862	Now you know why you don't JUST have sex..|`|2216244481d213debef4605befb5d3a2aa	He's using you, dump him and find someone who doesn't care who knows you are in love with them.  And you don't want him for a friend either, he's a jerk.  The girl of his dreams, what about your dreams don't they mean anything.  Have some self respect and find someone worthy of you....|`|R0U4qy6haa	sounds like he only wanted you around when he thought he could get a piece of a-- from you; that was all he cared about|`|GbF7pqQDaa	I think you should let him go b/c he probably isn'y worth ur time. I personally woldn't have told him that I like him. Usually when ppl do that then the otha person hides their true feelings. If he REALLY REALLY liked u they ya'll would still be friends.  -good luck-    10 pts?  This is waht I would do it....|`|IqsY1UBIaa	Kate,   This guy is a dick  You deserve alot better, let him and his new 'toy' go do whatever they want, but you should just try your best to get over him, which i know is hard but seriously, you so not need that type of a guy in your life. You should go and find a guy that really cares for you, and not someone who just wants to get in your pants.  I hope you find the right guy, and one last bit of advice, go to your ex boyfriends house, and kick him in the balls, really hard.|`|CqBGPm5saa	just leave him alone, the guy sounds like a ****.|`|3dehZfMwaa	Come on Kate, You dont love him, He DOES NOT love you.  There are 3 kinds of love. Pure love(Godly love)(Agape), Brotherly love,(Philos) and SEXUAL love,(Aros). Yall dont love each other in a nice way, yall just want to have sex. He WILL  burn you! He WILL hurt you, Its not worth it, you will be emotialy scard. His "girl" of his dreams is not you. ITS NOT WORTH IT. And its wrong hes your second cusin.
QdXvBOL7aa	I made the same solid promise i would never do it until i'm married. i met my bf, it was through 4 months, when he wanted to do it but i said no. he completely understood and didn't threaten me. so we lasted. but then on my birthday, i wanted to. and we did it for both our first time. it was awesome. i never regretted it because i didnt do it under pressure. so honey, you should break up with him. he sounds like a scumbag.|`|PCb44JoWaa	Tell that its just cliche to do it the first time on Valentines Day. Tell him it will happen when its right. Which might me when you are married...I told my boyfriend that I didnt want to until I was married but the time was just right. Good luck...if he breaks up with you...you deserve better.|`|M0X33Q5caa	if the guy really likes/loves you he wouldn't dump you for that.....all you should say is"i really like you and i would be heartbroken if we broke up just because am not ready.....if you really liked me you would never hurt me" if he dumps you then he is not worth ur love girl........that means he's using you if he only wants sex....don be afraid to let him go....there are many fish in the sea lol :)|`|aFgn03JUaa	Literally tell him that. Next time it comes up in conversation about Valentines Day or sex just tell him that you do really like him but you want to wait until the time is right.     If he doesn't have the decency to respect your wishes you're better off without him. Someone who truly cares about you would not threaten to break up with you just because you did not put out.    I actually have a lot of respect for you for thinking this way about sex.|`|toLCaFc9aa	If that is your choice then fight for it. Don't let anyone take that idea away from you if that is what you really want to do. Of course it is always your choice anyway. Just tell him that you don't want to have sex, not until you get married. If he wants to break up with you just because of that then he is not worth it. Good luck and keep up that idea :)|`|K8OjmMUAaa	Your body belongs to YOU. He has no rights whatsoever to it!    And I'm sorry to have to tell you this, but if he's threatening to break up with you, then he's not worth losing your virginity to. Why would you want to give that up to a guy who's going to break up with you regardless? He's basically telling you that you aren't worth being with if you don't have sex with him. Don't make excuses for him, either. If you have sex with him, you will regret it later, believe me!|`|Y4Ye3OLOaa	If he likes you he'll respect your decision.|`|4drQ38qZaa	Listen your boyfriend should respect your choices and if he is threatening a break up just because you don't want to sex with him then I would break up with him because he isn;t respecting you.|`|aNfGqkrpaa	Stick with your thoughts.  I'm not waiting till I'm mairred, but I DO want to find the right guy first.  But its your body, not his..yet.lol.    good luck.you probablly deserve better, anyways.|`|t2LOcPkLaa	he sounds like a jerk. any guy that will break up with you for not having sex with them isn't worth it. don't give in to something that you don't want to do because you'll regret it later.  xx
2tCbCvzXaa	we cant figure them out and they cant figure us out, its the cycle of life|`|01pY6dW9aa	men think we're difficult too.|`|sV2GO85Xaa	i am?    define "difficult". i think your definition is different from mine.
bnCiNAQdaa	since you only go there 1-2 times a week, what about the other 5-6 days when you dont see him? do you still have the same sex cravings?   if not, then the problem isnt the "wanting to have sex" part, but the fact that the only way you seem to be able to be with your BF at all is if there is sex involved.    doesnt sound like much of a BF/GF thing. more like bed buddies.    and if you are sex hungry 24x7, then either a) your BF isnt doing enough to satisfy you  or b) you are a borderline nympho/sex addict.|`|LykjWv6faa	Sounds like your relationship is built on sex.|`|3y0w1qIBaa	Yes, you may want want to control your hormones.|`|imKCvvFKaa	no.. you sound like you're addicted to sex and it's your comfort and makes you feel good|`|DJd0DruQaa	youre used to it and horney, be careful and be monogomous : )    its a natural thing but if you could put it off do that|`|tsdHndRhaa	hey ain't nothing wrong with being a freak for your man cause sex is a powerful thing but do not abuse this power or it gets old and lame real quick.|`|Goxe3kheaa	That you like sex. Maybe he just makes you feel really good.     Just be sure to use any kind of protection. You don't want your fun to turn into an unexpected baby.|`|UZQilsJcaa	Well it could be that you are just in the prime of your sex life! All men and women go thru it where all they want to do is have sex....allot!!!! Its normal and will pass but have fun with it while you can but always be sure to use protection!|`|mWWQR2lIaa	your probably just a horny girl?|`|K90GNrcKaa	It's called Nymphomania. It's an addiction to sex. MANY women and men alike are classified as "nymphos". Just make sure you're being monogamous, and you should be okay. Enjoy yourself.|`|0AaiHizlaa	You obviously find him sexually attractive and that's why you want to Jump each others bones as soon as you are in the same room! ;)    You're a horny little devil ;)    There's nothing wrong with that,..just make sure you are using Condoms or you are on the pill.    You may be having fun now,..but you don't want to get any STD or even Pregnant(unless you want to).|`|MC28SriZaa	Well first of all, you must be good in bed, if u were not, your BF would have left u all ready. Second, you should be carefully, u could become sexholic. third but it can be as well that ur having a new experience with the sex with your BF, and you like it. Fourth, if u want to do something with ur BF that doesn't have to do with sex, just go and have a date in a public place, and if u still want to have sex there, then u are nasty sink, sex addict...    Well lost my virginity about 3 months ago, and as it is new for me, i like experiencing and i have pretty often sex too... XD...    Chirio, hoped i helped...

But, hot really comes down to looks. I would take a hot girl who slept around a little over an ugly virgin.|`|bogfZ6Xsaa	No, but if they do it's because they realize how fragile in that situation you could be. Most like it though because it's like untouched snow. Pure and uncharted. Hope this helps!|`|jlXPsVfdaa	No.  I like women who are not sleeping with everyone.|`|z7ZjhN00aa	good girls are ok if they're hot and kinky.|`|xgJbxZgfaa	no most guys love something that's never been touched|`|3JfADTIDaa	Some guys do.

For me, I think it's a positive aspect. I don't know why other guys would consider it a turn off. And it's definitely not cool if they get turned off by that.|`|Z4eWbhZqaa	i certainly hope not|`|bSN0v4cEaa	no it makes them turned on more to know that they r the first one.|`|vCbOzvGVaa	No, cause then the guy can show her the ropes :D  *ropes meaning his dink*|`|r1MImdh3aa	No. Anyone who is should be proud.|`|OYGPK59laa	it depends on how old you are|`|bj9pc6qyaa	i wouldnt think so|`|86UVdNqaaa	no way..|`|3OT8Lmrgaa	Most are disapointed by that, because she may not want it unless she get's married.|`|G5umwRBkaa	No. They get turned ON. But once you give it up if you didn't really get to know them first there is a really good chance they'll leave you without waiting to get to know you because they get to where they are sort of on missions, and if there mission is to make you not a virgin anymore, then once accomplished they dont try anymore - even if they might like you, just because they dont even think about it.    silly boys.|`|PJOLplymaa	Depends on the expectation of the Guy.|`|FzrH4I8naa	no|`|cRjWAZTzaa	no not at all.. i find it as more of a turn on|`|a8ONCCowaa	Noo, it actually turns them on. At least that was the case for my boyfriend!|`|6tIoJzMQaa	noe     gd luck ;)|`|2bfdxef1aa	NOOOO way !!!!!!!!! Guys like that so they could possibly be special in a girls life !!!!!|`|Jnvz0iUGaa	nope|`|m88ELjmPaa	Yes/No    All guys like to have a virgin, they feel special to be their first one.    But talking about a one night stand, i prefer a woman that is no virgin.|`|Ka3pGkw0aa	No because that means that the girl hasnt been banged by anyone else so its like putting on a pair of fresh socks but if they're not a virgin its like putting on the socks from two days ago|`|PimNZANIaa	no at all it means we can trust you more|`|KyKGQJiPaa	Depends on the guy. Either way, it really shouldn't have an affect on whether it turns the guy on or off|`|O5G83gcQaa	most guys love that.  never been touched, they see that as more as a challenged|`|VzMRqyHCaa	nahh brooskii !|`|qc9B2rMGaa	if it does theres something wrong there,  little things like that shouldn't make a difference,|`|A8lwcL8Aaa	I honestly dont think so and if they do then  your defo with the wrong guy! I'm sorry if i sound like a tard but with all the guys i've been with [dont take that the wrong way] most of them LIKE the fact that i am a virgin and that i am awaiting for marriage or awaiting for the 'right one'. Plus i think they find it HOT sense your tighter then you would be if you wasnt and they would be the first to 'have' you. I think guys like the thought of being the first one sense you remember it more. IF YOU HAVE A GUY TELLING YOU ITS A TURN OFF   JUST MAYBE u should get rid of him sense that isnt really right [Well atleast in my thoughts]  But thats up to you!     But in my thoughts i doubt its a turn off and if it is then that guy probly just wants to get in ur pants and telling you it is to you'll be more willing to change that and make him happy or whatever. Get what im saying?      So no! Not a turn off!|`|PVVsK9pWaa	Well,  The sweetest girl I've ever known was a virgin, and I'll always pride our relationship on that.  Its been 40 years.  You have to ask yourself what the term "Turned-Off" means to you.  Does it mean occurs to someone with Low Standards, sleezy lifestyle, and who only uses people?  I think turning off a person of that charactor is okay, don't you think?  Look, you'll probably not going to be a virgin all of your life, why waste it prematurely/  There's not enough said about virture.  I'm no crazy, religeous fanatic, but I am a Dad.  I'm still crazy about the 19 year old I married, more than 36 years ago too.  I think you can be cool, and a virgin.  Just be a selective one, because there's still a lot of fun out there to be had.  Be kind to yourself,  Will In IL|`|LpbDMyZkaa	No. Specially if I'm going to marry her. I don't do. I would only date virgin girls. I'm a guy and I'm virgin.

a6j0cwgqaa	Alright Becky! Confidence is what you need! try to think of yourself as being older. You're 13 and that is awfully young to be thinking you need a mate or whatever, But if you really think that no one likes you think again! I bet there are tons of guys that would love you to notice them! Believe in yourself!    If you really are feeling down about the whole thing then experiment with some different makeup looks and hairstyles! It always made me feel better about myself...|`|pD4fbUzpaa	if your not ugly, then dont worry about it.  that means no guy is mature enough to like someone like you. and if you have to be nicer to get a guys attention, he is not worth it.  and you are 13 years old!  you do not need a boyfriend to make you happy. i would know i am fifteen years old and have never had a boyfriend.  i mean it hurts obviously, but you gotta suck it up and move on, you know.  so just keep being yourself and get out there(: youll find somebody that likes u for you.|`|t8gWcBaeaa	aww poor thing u :(  NOT.   b patient ur only 13 =\|`|AA10214276	Grow up and then you'll look older and hotter. And you'll learn how to spell, and then boys will like you.|`|XzXqsU86aa	instead of trying to get a boy, first you should work on your vocabulary|`|N9dbMxESaa	do something different it with your hair curl it or straighten it  or  put sum suttle make up on mascara and eyeliner|`|L2pkns9maa	Make up. A bit of eye liner and lip gloss should do the trick
dGL5xCrqaa	My family uses a fake Christmas tree, but it's about the same size as every other tree in our neighborhood. I never busted inside their houses for accurate measurements though, so I could be wrong. I'm going off of rough estimates.    I see the dilemma you have in your relationship. You're an avoider, just kidding. Funny question.|`|a6QK1oQFaa	looooooooooooooooool  i thought u were going to say EYES :)|`|DOoHDBTiaa	LMAO! it depends on the family and the size of the house lol.|`|EJxDQoNHaa	this is mainly because we all use fake ones and i'm sorry, but man, they're just shorter than the ones you buy.|`|hZlwaaP2aa	hahahahah I love you ;)  and it's because asians are poor! DUH ;D|`|OC8YCBzSaa	so they can reach the top to put a star on it, duh!|`|RCGh7GTQaa	LOL.. i thought you were referring to something else.  but back to the question. why would you buy a real christmas tree, when you can buy a fake one for less?  Us Asians are like that; We need to be cheap in order to function.
eO4y3m1maa	Try online or thru friends....thats your best bet!|`|4HoVVCenaa	Church|`|jlZZbdIjaa	A coffeeshop or somewhere that you like to go a lot you might find someone there that likes the same stuff as you|`|9fAHd15Caa	bookstore! haha i dont know although if you still call women 'girls' then your school?|`|VDlvSMP1aa	Places or doing things you enjoy often, then you will find someone with similar intrests as you.     If you like to roller skate, then rink.  If you like to read, the bookstore etc..    good luck|`|tsdHndRhaa	church, walking down the street, library, volunteering some where, grocery store or maybe even going on a vacation.|`|pYVvI8Ogaa	the mall or a park.|`|0tpbeXqIaa	bookstore concert or grocery store are always good i am a big fan of the grocery store.
AA12164862	Oh, please stop it! I am sure you are a great guy!  And as far as being short...I'm only 5 ft.!  Being over weight isn't an issue, that can be taken care of very easily.  Don't get down on yourself..everyone is beautiful in his own way.|`|hVlh6XQeaa	i was about to feel sorry for you, but then i realized thats not neccesary because you feel unbelievely sorry for yourself already, so you dont need any help doing that. i hate to sound harsh but listen to yourself! if you call yourself a failure people are just going to treat you like one! Gain some confidence in yourself. No matter what you have to do. If you have to work out, work out. Only you can change your dating life. So get to it.|`|AA11100500	Dude just go for it... You can't live in a hole forever... Make new friends, hang out with all kinds of different people.|`|xgJbxZgfaa	dude, get in shape, lose weight, and gain some confidence. keep your hygiene up too!!!!! join a club or take on a sport!!!! once u have that down, you can have any girl you want, and when the time is right, when you're ready to settle, the girl of your dreams will walk right in when you least expect it! most importantly, don't forget who u are. good luck kiddo!|`|KGA2OdPraa	just wait.  when u see that perfect girl for u, u will know.  and then it will all come together.  just.....wait.|`|XdqvvLaiaa	Honestly, Just be your self.

What idiot writes down the names of girls he slept with? That's a waste of time...|`|RoFfCYGxaa	I think it's definitely bull that they were his friends & I think you know he more than likely did cheat on you with those girls & you know it couldn't have been a long time ago because you two have only been together for 8 months.  I don't know him or you personally, but I seriously doubt that he is changed, if he cheated on you a few months ago why would he stop now.  If you decide to stay with him he might end up hurting you in the end, I'd find someone who definitely was going to treat you with respect.|`|Ngc0teBqaa	Your instincts sound TOTALLY right - he's playing you, and you already have all the evidence you need.  Break it off with him right this instant!   Not only is he dishonest, he's also dangerous - if he's cheating on you and not wearing protection, there's no telling what he might pass along to you.  Dump him and head straight to the free clinic!
1bubNOQmaa	By choosing to have a child with him, you've already chosen your new family.  However, he has to understand that by choosing you, he has by extension accepted your family.  If he seriously wants you to give up all communications with your family, he should first examine the long term consequences of that, as you will eventually (if not already) resent him.|`|OuOOy8v3aa	I would say don't be so self centered.  I would take my baby and choose my old family because they are not asking me to choose.|`|QGsYPJoKaa	If he makes you chose then he clearly isn't a good influence to be around. You need to decide what is best for you and your baby. Singular. Put the arguments to a side and focus on the best thing for you two.  If he is asking you to chose between blood relatives and him, then he isn't putting your best interests at heart, and you wouldn't want to be in a toxic relationship like that.  Your family should always be there for you and your baby, but will your friend stay around ?  You should try to avoid having to chose and try and maintain a strong relationship between both sides of the family.  Try and avoid him having anything to do with your family and explain calmly to both parties that what their doing is putting more stress on you and that you can't deal with both of them, and that they should just be focusing on yourself and your baby. Try and see it from both their point of view and get them to see it from yours.  Communication is the key, trying talking, but if it boils down to it and you are MADE [though avoid the situation at all costs] to chose between the families then i would stick to yours, because this gentlemen clearly doesn't care about you enough if he is making you chose, but remember he is still the father of your baby.  Goodluck :]|`|XAw4cJmjaa	Blood family should always come first!|`|E2bagWkpaa	O gosh, that's hard. I'm not in your position, so I can't say for sure, but your family is your family. I would tell him to suck it up and deal with it. If he didn't, I think I would chose my mom and sisters.     But it's a personal thing. If it were someone else, I would say follow your heart. I don't know what would happen if you chose your old family, if you wouldn't get to see your baby.|`|yMRY5cgxaa	If you want him tell your family to change if not you got a decision to make...|`|mpvjUx45aa	i would tell him that i need my family as much as he needs his and if he doesnt like it then he needs to get over it because you want both families and your not goin to choose because thats not fair.|`|ekRtrUnIaa	well thats kinda messed up of him to ask you that! i wouldnt choose if i were you and tell him that you dont think its right because you love them all and you cant stop seeing your mom and sisters cuz your mom gave brth to you and theyre you blood and you cannot stop seeing your baby but idk why he would make you choose between that that really f***ed|`|CD9ZMxBTaa	if you love him you will just have to keep those lives seperate for now. and eventually he will turn around. dont invite him to family gatherings. i think they will both understand. but you cant ignore your family just because he wants you to.|`|8Yz1gFGVaa	That is a loaded question. Why don't they get along? If you can try to look at it from both their sides and find a compromise that would work. You say you and your man are trying to work things out...was the only problem your family or were other factors involved?    My hubby dislikes some of my family, so I limit their time together. Major Holidays and sometimes birthdays. Other than that, I visit those he doesn't get along with alone.|`|3Phz1nHeaa	I would choose him and the baby.  That's just me I have been married for 5 years and have a 6month old.  If things got that bad I would stick with my hubby.  However I could never imagine him doing that since a marriage is all about sacrafices.  Why not say you go and visit them and he stays home or he just comes once a year or so.

C7THL8hlaa	Honestly its like 50-50 it depends on how you broke up, I cant be friends with a girl i was in love with because those feelings always seem to creep up, and if i was hurt by someone cant be friends with them either! if it was a mutual break up its easy to be friends other than that its tough being friends with your ex!|`|4bWUiIVdaa	I tried but it's hard. Especially when he's going on about how he hooked up with this guy at the club...|`|yxoXTmlqaa	I depends on what kind of person you are, and its not bad if you aren't friends.

I don't know about getting back together because that depends completely on what your situation was, who broke up with whom, why, how long you'd been together etc. etc...   I tried to be just friends with an ex once and I felt like crying every time I saw him. I just wanted to be back with him. That was years ago. I've found someone new and we've been together for almost 4 years now. I could never be just friends with him. As for my ex? He can see whoever he likes. I couldn't care less.|`|fFcgBUjyaa	It dependsz how you break up. Like if your both ok with it you tend to stop talking then youll just start talking again. But if the one really hurtsz the other your likely to stop talking.|`|96wixYvMaa	It really depends how strong of a relationship you had before and during your dating.|`|m2NUw8mpaa	no. its like impossible. my teacher also said it was a fact that ex's cant stay friends. i dont remember her reason tho.|`|cf84769c39c0ba4a53a95535563ec1e3aa	Tried and regressed back into the sack than dated for 4-6 more mos than broke up again...better to just move along with out them as friends.

It would just be too hard. Sitting beside each other without holding hands, or cuddling would be awkward if I dated them a long time. And seeing them with other people would kill me. If I dated someone for like a week, or a month though, yes, I would still stay friends with them.|`|IPXHFP9Paa	I know exactly what you mean.    YES.    being friends with them after a long term serious relationship will end up in you 2 dating again.    it always works like that.    becuase trying to be friends after a failed relationship is just a way to get back into eachothers lifes without having to admit that youre still in love.    plus itll give you time to think and rly enjoy eachothers company.    :D    im ALWAYS friends with my X's.    just in case I change my mind one day :D|`|9XjtEdEqaa	i cant ever be friends with guys after i break up with them unless i secretly still like them then i make an effort to always be around him|`|Q8tf4B5taa	it works for some but not for others. yes if its only a couple of weeks or months it is easy to stay friends but longer term things are much harder. I have had two previous serious relationships the first one 3 years long he went away for 4 years but when he came back we became good mates as there was nothing like that between us anymore. My last relationship 5 years i cant be friends with my ex as he is very bitter. yes you may end up back together if you stay friends and there are still feelings there but in my experience you can only Truly be friends with an ex once the feelings have disappeared otherwise it can confuse either one of you and give you hope to get back together.|`|H4kFPtNbaa	Being friends with your ex is very hard if thats all you can feel when ever your around them. If its a recent break up its usually best to take some time off from seeing each other. If you both really want to be friends then you can make it work if one or both of you is not wanting to do it then thats a big sign that friendship should not happen. The main point is that its all up to how YOU feel about it. Trust your heart, its not always smart but it never lies to you. You just have to pay attention.
9CUaikUEaa	i think hes attracted to you but just wishes you werent so shy, so maybe when you met him he was like, i wish she was more my type.  you should go to the party and with a lot of people there you'll be more loud and he'l probably start liking you again.
1H56FPt8aa	Well she was drinking. Sometimes that influence us to do things we normally wouldn't.    I would give it a little time, since she just got out of a relationship, and then talk to her about it....sober though|`|Rch68tXlaa	I wouldn't because that's just going to make things get complicated.Just keep it as Friends trust me when i say that.Both parties should have mutual interest and if not then leave it alone.|`|oadV46kYaa	nope i wouldnt. love should be a two way thing.  and you guys weren't sober, so you guys mught not know what you guys have said to each other. so talk to her when you BOTH are sober.
sjMs7hN9aa	I'm just confused about the whole situation.  I thought the state took your kids.  When was the last time you saw your husband?  Why do you type in ALL CAPS?  srry. Anyways, what is being done is wrong in so many aspects and in the end the people that suffer most are the children when saddens me deeply.  I don't know the whole story, obviously, but no matter what the story is it is never good to cheat on anyone, especially if you are married and have children!  Do you not feel love for your husband anymore?  If your husband is still in prison then I know it can be tough to get through the days alone.  I can't tell you what I would do if I was in your situation but I do know that if you love your kids the way you say you do, then be sure to put them first.  You need to be their parent before anything else.|`|VZPtCkweaa	well that's a tough situation. . .    you should talk to your husband about this,|`|MHwn4Tlzaa	You cheated on your husband and you want us to tell you it's ok?    I don't think so.|`|5331fbe56b0c879203709218ff2d48d4aa	Stay with your husband and work things out with him. You should watch the movie match point.
nuef3YTFaa	He probably loves you so much that he doesn't want to risk upsetting you by taking it too fast. He is probably ready, but doesn't realise that you are too! Nothing says that you can't make the first move though!|`|bcab7e2824c9dc2b7643bdff851f90baaa	I was really laughing for like about 15 minutes at the top question. i mean you were kidding right- when you asked that?    anyways, he is probably waiting for you.  Its a good thing, if he wants to respect you and not pressure you. You should ask him about it or make the move yourself.
KcloaW4vaa	Tell him what u told us...  If u didnt mean to go off on him, it wasnt so much of wrong thing as it was bad. Just be kind to im and tell him u were wrong.    BTW, ur the first girl that actually admit they were wrong for doin something, nice job.|`|COmp4sIuaa	What did he do?|`|W8Y3FPOPaa	just apoligize and say that you really mean it coz when i got into a argument wiv my m8 (girl) i felt really sad and i kept apoligizin 2 her and in the end she 4gave me... and if he really dus like u i rekon he shud 4give you|`|8AOgHjH0aa	Well you said your boyfriend messed up today so maybe he deserved it? You just need to talk to him and let him know how you feel but if he has done something really bad, don't apologise, hold your ground
0M5XYROfaa	Hi sweetie, id say tell her.  Explain to her what was going on in your life, and also tell her the reason for not telling her in the first place. opefully she will understand, but if not at least u have given her the chance to know what was going on.    Good luck :)
vZhVSYDMaa	Alright, I'm pretty sure you can get just about a billion different answers, but I'll share with you my personal preferences.    1. This is easy. Just be there. What grabs our attention is the same as what grabs yours. Think... all those guys who just walk by you at the mall, do you remember any of them the next day? Probably not. But if one of them walked up to you and started talking, then he'll probably bounce around in your head for a while. It's the same way for us. Just talk to us and if you want something, don't wait for it to come to you first.    2. You cannot have a single answer to this question that's applicable to all types of guys. The most I can tell you here is stay classy, be caring, and don't have any ulterior motives. This means it's a turn off for most guys to smoke, do drugs, act like a prostitute, etc. Keep your mouth clean and keep everything else clean as well. Be caring just means be a good friend, and be there when they need you. Don't interact with a guy with any ulterior motives like trying to get their number or whining about how he doesn't want to hang out with you. That'll make you seem desperate and a guy's respect for you will drop like a hot potato.    3. This is also easy. Just take care of yourself. Wear relatively nice clothing, don't smell bad (not loaded with perfume either... a small amount might favor you), groom yourself, and just be a normal person. You don't have to be some crazy celebrity look-alike or anything in order to be attractive.    4. This is like question 2. Basically, if you be a good person towards them, you'll find somebody amazing, and if the boy you want doesn't see you and your greatness, then its his loss. You can flirt a little, but not with everybody. Try to keep the extra hinting stuff towards only the ones you fancy in order to keep yourself away from the shallow whore category. Oh, and it's also important to treat guys equally, no matter if you want to date them or not. Don't be mean and ignore the guys that you don't find attractive. Be friends with everybody and people will respect you.    I think I just wrote a book, but thats okay. Just consider what I said and also remember that the more you attempt to make yourself stand out, and more risky of a path you're taking. Although you can gain the attention of some guys, you might turn others off as well. Just don't be egotistical about it and you'll be fine.|`|qmXFCVMIaa	i don't know you tell me what can i do to get girls to like me??? i'm the guy in the heavy jackets and walking through the mall by myself i should be attracting the girls who like the quiet guys who act tuff but really are nice when u know them ...but i'm drawing a blank....oh rule 1 dont be slutty...sure they like u at first ...then they drop u and move on|`|AZTNUH08aa	For me, what makes a girl attractive is her personality and the way she talks to you.  Looks are good but the personality is the thing that lasts.  You want someone to fall in love with you for that and not what is on the outside|`|lsFcvd32aa	1. flirt  2. be friendly.  3. each guy is different  4.all of the above.|`|pZevjTXGaa	1. they gotta talk to them to where he's interested.  2. try to make plans with them.  3. wear nice clothes, smell good.  4. show your romantic side.
JbKerMCkaa	Hi,    I am 30-- I am married but I can understand what is happening.    You start realizing you are getting older and you are changing.  You still feel like a 23 year old good lookn' guy, but girls that age see you as "older" or "old".  That feels very odd because it happens so fast.  I think its kinda like women in their mid-30s being called a "cougar" by guys just a few years younger.    You also start thinking about family.  Though you feel young to have kids, if you have a child at 30, then you'll be about 52 or so when they graduate college...WOW.  That may cause us to want to start think about finding a woman that would make a good mom and that's why they usually date more realistic women.  Guys are maturing like women seem to in their mid-20s.  I think that maturity causes them to look at women differently too and that's what you see.  Some guys are just jerks no matter what, so age doesn't solve all problems ha ha|`|m4uJoEtGaa	i never was like this at 29 but what the hell as it got to do with you anyway. who wants to settle down with a women all the nagging dipping ya pocket n many other things that go with it...... lol other than that darling you must just be unlucky in love x
dGL5xCrqaa	She sounds like a total wench. She doesn't want to get married until she's thirty? So she's planning on dying when her kid is just going into elementary school! She'll be too old to have kids. Also, separate rooms? Even the Amish share a bedroom.   Find yourself a job that makes enough money to buy your own apartment and then find a woman who has the same life goals as you.    As unfortunate as it is, there is no future with someone who doesn't want to take the same path as you, you'll just end up growing apart anyway if you haven't already.    Best of luck.|`|hdYgdu0oaa	well, when you are in love with someone, you love them for who they are...and want to support them through the difficult times.    She is in school, she is busy and stressed.  Sex is no fun when you are tired all the time.    Seems to me, that you are not "in-love" with her.  Otherwise you would be there to support her and not be worrying about "your-needs".    Sex, is part of a relationship...    I think she was just trying to test you, to see if you actually love her or are just hanging around for the sex.    I think she found her answer!|`|kqa9VFrfaa	Time to move on. Just be cheerful and helpful around the house. That will keep her guessing. She knows what she wants now, and that's a good thing. U do not have to mention sex. She seems to have laid down some clear ground rules. Get a job and move out. Time for you to have a different life. As soon as U find a job and a place, fix it up nice, and invite her over for dinner. Find a new girl. U R young, and the world is waiting.|`|CnM2U1bXaa	Maybe you should tell her how you feel, she might understand, but if not just tell her that you need out and that your not ready for that (its better to blame everything on u and not her).|`|10QSTGWAaa	Make sure you can arrange living situations first, because she'll most likely want to make your life hell.     Be easy and relaxed about it, if possible. Don't be harsh or draw it out, because that's what she's been doing to you. What you need to do is say, "look, this isn't looking like it's going to work, and if you can't make any time for me, then I'm leaving."    Either she'll reconsider her decisions (though not likely) or she'll agree. Make sure it's really what you want.|`|aXqi9lYJaa	Aww, you seem like a nice guy!    I think that you just need to either talk it out with her, or straight up and say "Alot has changed, and I don't think that we are meant for eachother"|`|5Bn1QsWmaa	first u need to accept the fact that if u are going to end it with her, u will have to find another place to stay, and if u think for one min that u should  still be allowed to stay there, then that's just tacky.Secondly, u should just tell her how u feel, let her know that all her rules, and bylaws just ain't cutting it w/u anymore!|`|jj2tSASnaa	well i take it back. I thought this other loser i read about earlier was thew most pathetic, but NO!!!!  IT IS YOU. GROW UP GET A JOB, USER.  LOSER|`|qVRmpGlEaa	Tell her she's not the same person you met such and such years ago. She's changed and so have you. You don't think this is gonna work out anymore. Trust me you want to drop her. Her demands are unhealthy for a relationship and will haunt you for the rest of your days if you decide to abide by them.|`|VADaU7AJaa	you obviously want completely different things, and spending the rest of your life with her wouldn't be a good idea.    just tell her how you're feeling, and how you don't think you can comply with the things she wants/needs. explain to her everything you're thinking, and it will be easier then making something up. find somewhere else to live too!    hope everything works out.|`|21cf999bfe54057972e1de48b7cd2cf3aa	Before you do anything, start working on finding a place to live. You are going to need to pay your own rent from now on and you need to be ready to move a few days after you break up. You don't need to come up with a lot of details, just tell her it isn't working out anymore and you are not happy with her. Don't count on being friends with her now or ever. Right now you need to break up and distance yourself for a long time. If you are meant to be friends, that may happen a year or two from now.|`|CvREWSV1aa	Wow, i feel bad for you.  Well what i would do is just tell her the truth. Say, (her name) i think maybe we should go our seperate ways and see other people. You are going in a different direction then i am going in. I have different plans and i dont see you in them. So Maybe it would be best if we just go our seperate ways.  thats what i would say.  good luck hun!|`|pgfgzz5Jaa	well girl acts the same way bout the sex thing, but if you actuly love her then none of that stuff should matter you think you guys wont be fighting alot when you get married or something..but if you love then just deal with it.. my g/f just join the airforce and imma join the marines but we still plan on being together we just know that we both got things we want to do or be and we respect that so if you girl wants to go to college and become something with her self then support her and don't be selfish|`|KHtf2pDKaa	if she wont put effort into the relationship break up with her.she seems too bossy.i wouldnt want a girl like that.get rid of her.start showing her no attention and she probably eventually get sick of you then the relationship can end|`|bqNI8ZUIaa	ur in a very tough situation|`|MbvW9v6Iaa	idk|`|vu8AbC4Maa	my ex just told me he didn't feel the way he used to. Its all good, use that line.|`|iKK89z2Eaa	just talk to her, if you guys really love each other youll work the problems out, when you tell her what bothers you she will tell you what bothers her.  but dont use her for your house ifr you dont really love her ! good luck|`|xZJZNpIlaa	wait a while save up your money buy an apartment in another city and then one day when she is at work take your shiiit and leave. change all your info and shell never know|`|skiPYyGDaa	let her own easy write a letter or something if you dont want to do it in person write your feelings down it helps|`|e9sbXvCvaa	Your in a tough situation but like you have to be honest with her. Be upfront and tell her the reasons.|`|ZGidIKBcaa	Best thing to do is talk to her about it  If you still love her then talk to and ask if some things can be changed a bit|`|YsYq7BJzaa	u need 2 tell her it isn't working out and u need some time off and find anouther guy that would be perfect for her and get them to meet ok then she will forget all about u|`|FuPY6Dr0aa	cheat ya gotta ******* cheat go out there and find a girl who wants you nuts and **** the **** outta her then get really drunk and tell her what you did =]|`|2BAO5fExaa	Suck it up and get out. You'd better get a pair of balls and lay your cards on the table. Screw being friends. It aint gonna happen. As soon as you show some gumption, she will have no use for you.     My philosophy about goofy women has always been.....Next.|`|Q8tf4B5taa	just sit her down and be honest say you both want different things in the relationship. I would suggest you find somewhere else to live though because it is going to be very awkward after wards.|`|Wuxx02czaa	You need to end it right now. This is no way to live your life and she is treating you horribly and expecting you to adhere to demands no one should have to live with. My guess is she doesn't want this relationship anymore and is trying to push you away. Tell her how you feel, end it and stick to it. This is ridiculous. Just get a job like a normal guy would, is this really how you want to live your life just so you don't have to do as much, come on. Get yourself into a position to were you can get your own place and then just say, I'm leaving.|`|nBNULijtaa	You should honestly tell her why you want out of the relationship. Then she might be willing to change things or maybe not. But she has the right to know why. Just sit her down and talk to her calmly about it, don't attack her but give her closure if things do fall through. If you plan on moving out (which you should) I'm sure you can find a place to stay until you make other arrangements. You're in a tough situation, but I wish you the best.|`|S7VJ1GDdaa	OK, First of all, if her dad is paying the rent, you need to find a place to live so that when the **** hits the fan ( and it will), you will be able to leave. Secondly, you are both obviously young and are not ready for a grown up relationship. I guess that you are , but she is not. The good thing is that kids and marriage are not going to hold you into this relationship. As far as being friends after wards, it sounds like you guys are only friends with some benefits already. I would not ***** foot around, and come right out and say that our plans for the future are not the same any more, and I need to be with someone that also wants to be with me. If she cannot understand, then that is her problem. You cannot go on in a relationship with someone who for some reason or other has changed her mind. At least it was before anything else came of it. You need to cut your loses, and get out. You do not want to raise kids in an environment that is like that, and it wouldn't be good for you because you would feel deprived and end up cheating. Get out while you still can. Good Luck|`|yYCPLCyyaa	"Hey_______  can I talk to you? (smiling) You know I love you, and I'll always love you... but more as a friend rather than a girlfriend...."  if she says something like "*sniffle* but why...???"  then suck it up and give her a flaw, probably the flipping out at the littlest things one  i think in this situation you'll have the best luck with securing a place b/c she might still want you around cause she has feelings for u still  or she could just be pissed and dump your sorry *** on the street  if she says something like "i was kinda starting to think the same way"  then it will be a good break up but again you'll have to ask if u can stay and she most likely will say no cause there is no need for u around  i think you should get a fricken place of ur own and not  use some other chick  plus ur not gonna have sex in your ex's house  nothing is always completely easy, so deal with the outcome|`|VfXjBTARaa	WORK IT OUT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...|`|TE5l8FwEaa	just tell her u wanna break up with her cause ur not ready|`|JyFOtRDeaa	tbh there is no good way to break up with her.  but just prepare her for it like be weird round her then the way i found best was texting because then she has something to gloat about like 'OMG HE DUMPED YOU BY TEXT! THAT ***-WHOLE!'  okay???|`|Lxrunkxwaa	Talk to her, tell her how you feel. Do not under any circumstance mention that you want to leave her because of her. Even if you have to lie. It will only break her heart and make her angry. Make sure you make time to tell her all of this. Do not rush it or squeeze it in some timeframe. Do not text it or email it, you have to say this in person. Mention that you still care a great deal for her and want to be friends. One day she will be able to do that, but she'll need time and space most likely.    Good luck.
r7eJhJvVaa	Take a bunch of flowers  in and tell her an admirer sent them and does she have a message.    You should get a clue as to what she thinks and if shes single.    If no luck quickly put card with your number in the flowers telling her the admirer was you and leave your number.    At least you ll know if she likes ya.
7qCUk8hfaa	her bedroom is for sleeping in not having friends in there. They should be in the family room or den. the bedroom is for sleeping it not a Living room  that's why i would be mad to do you have friends in your bedroom?|`|tCiVuFK9aa	Does he have children?  If not then I would assume it is because he is bothered by having her in the house period.  You need to discuss this with him.  I think I would rather have my daughter have her friends come to my home. That way I know where my child is and what they are up to.  Your daughter should feel free to have friends in her home.  This could become a major problem.  I think you guys need to get this problem handled now.  Red|`|AA10912960	Well I am a 15 year old boy."WE" teenagers act a way with parents but with other people we can be a whole different person.I think your husband is right by getting mad.Dont let them close the door.You never know what their doing!|`|b165361aa3bdfd3dd4401459ad6b7836aa	If the girls aren't do anything wrong and your daughter's behavior does not change after her friends visit then I am just as lost as you are.  Have you tried asking him what about her having friends over makes him so angry?|`|tZ4Kyc0Waa	Privacy thing, generally you don't want people seeing personal things and by your daughter taking her friends up there she is promoting privacy invasion. He wants to keep his privacy.|`|3e657243a606e14632ec806cc8f3adf1aa	He sounds like a jerk, he must have never been around teenagers.  Tell him that's how girls are and get use to it!|`|z36j8rmRaa	Hey Twiggy,    Firstly, no one can really answer that question but your husband.  Secondly, is your daughter having male friends up in her room as well or just female friends?  If male, your husband may be concerned for her welfare, as you should as well.  The last thing I can answer is this:  When a man comes home from work, he needs to unwind for at the very least 30 minutes.  He also thinks of his home as his sanctuary from the world.  Men do not tend to like anyone in their "cave" except those that belong.  So perhaps you could try to have your daughter have only 1-2 friends over before your husband comes home from work.  Cheerfully sending them on their way just before he gets home or soon after.  Give your husband some time after he comes home to just decompress for about an hour before you approach him with anything.  If you show your husband some preferential treatment, then when you approach him, at the right time, about allowing your daughter to bring over some friends, you may find he is willing to come to a suitable compromise.|`|4805686fe56c40b3d116e63ef0f5fd16aa	Well, he doesn't like it and that is something you and him may need to discuss and get to the bottom of it.|`|JXGnwBFEaa	Are the friends boys?|`|ycNxVrUfaa	Sounds like he has anger issues. Remind him that at least he KNOWS where his daughter is and that she is safe at home. Your husband has to get past this. Most kids do this and it's normal. Your husband's anger is not.|`|STHD0k83aa	he gets mad because he is concerned about your daughter. the closed door signifies her shutting him out of her life.|`|l9pserEfaa	If it's a boy...he is just being protective over his daughter. If it is just girls...he is probably just worried what could be going on. Girls can be devious. He just wants to protect his little girl. That's what dads do!|`|1qTNn8qnaa	Ask him wats rong...and explain...that theres nothing wrong with it...tell him he's being unreasonable...>.
LhEoVly0aa	ask him if he would prefer she was at someone elses house or at home where he knows where she is and that shes safe! how old is she?? remind him that she was having friends over long before he was on the scene!!
af644b7256e7bf5a53974bb99a32d482aa	Tell him to deal with it, he's being less mature than the teenager is!  At least she's not running all over town doing God knows what with God knows who.|`|1epjqrflaa	Sounds like a real jerk off, tel him if he doesnt like it he can hit the road. Kids first|`|jaHkY4Rbaa	Only he knows for sure.      Seems to me, that he has a lot more anger issues than this !      I am assuming also, that her friends are MALE ?    Perhaps he figures she is doing things that his teenage girlfriends and he did.   Maybe he liked to get them naked ?        If they are female friends, that is perplexing.|`|ff3Gcd5Oaa	She's a teenager, this is normal!  There is something else going on here...sounds like he has underlying issues/anger/resentment.  Have you flat-out asked him why this upsets him?  Does he get along with her otherwise?  Is he possessive about her? He is being immature and unreasonable.  Maybe family therapy would be in order.  You need to just sit down together and be completely honest about this, cos it's weird and troublesome, and will get worse if not addressed.
5IIEknR7aa	Hi there!   In my opinion I think he likes you but is too nervous to do anything about it..Why don't you ask him to go out for a coffee or something? Then you will have the chance to talk to him face to face and clear the air.  There is a possibility that he thinks that you blew him off since after the dance you had no communication. You could never know until you do something about it. Good Luck|`|FUQ0sJNaaa	yea why not yo|`|ATpVoEwJaa	CALL HIM and if he says he doesnt like to talk, then say f**k u f*g and let him play with himself!|`|AA11852242	read between the lines he left you hanging. after a week and nothings change then he didnt like you........................................|`|a9qrXBBsaa	he just doesnt like to text. maybe call him, or talk to him at school. just talk to him more. if he doesnt show interest he doesnt like you. he might just be trying to be nice. sorry|`|t58tRjwbaa	hmm.. it sounds like he was ready to give it a chance on friday, but then he wasn't going for it. if he was interested, then he would be talking to you! move on.

Um, but yeah, i like a guy who does guitar, who is funny (most definately), who just wants to be my friend. you know? like not trying to get my attention because they like me but when they find out i don't like them, then they just move on to another girl, so its just like what the heck?     what catches my attention about a guy, is their eyes, their smile, humor, and personality. oh and how they dress, like do they take care of themselves, or do they wear the same shirt like everyday...haha :D     but of course, this is only my opinion. this is a good question since you get to see the other girls' opinions on this.|`|pdvTnv8naa	adam's apples make me melt (:|`|UfWYWoOkaa	sumthin|`|K1XM6rpwaa	make me laugh, give me hugs, and have sweet, sensitive eyes....  unless you're talking sexually and then I can't answer  lol|`|OV8ZkRNFaa	Chewtoys......|`|S5QsLZwwaa	potato pie and sprite|`|3jEakZxCaa	I'm not going there with the turn ons ;) but a guy who comes up to me and talks to me about hanging out together.  Not some friend of a friend of his.|`|qAd0QmZEaa	it catches my attention wen guys are really nice and will do anything to get my attention and will NOT flirt with my best friends....... kinda like a guy i know.....hmmmmmm lol :P|`|yOWhoQBMaa	Funny and has great eyes.|`|MHQVnqaXaa	be manly. aloof. smart. good jaw line. assertive.  i absolutely love when a guy takes charge. and is confident. thats such a turn on.  what catches my attention...hmm..same sorta thing: confidence, a certain swagger. :D|`|NR0Qib9Raa	sometimes. their eyes.|`|xDlBM6N6aa	What turns me on is a guy that touches my boobs (my ex did that, not a random guy), idk what it is about it, but I like it!    Body Massages are always nice, in general a guy with the right touch, is a turn on for me.    Something that catches my attention is when a guy says something about sex, no matter what it is...it always does.  I'm a virgin but still.  idk what else catches my attention, saying my name mabye??
aT9HYagEaa	ok first of all..it was a smile...dont look so deep into it silly =) im sure it was you she was smiling at...thats a good thing. it means shes friendly. it was almost her way of saying dont be intimidated by me...just say hey next time you see her...try to start a conversation...and if shes not interested then oh well but if she is then great! you have nothing to lose! good luck! =)|`|zyhbCGwpaa	I'm female, and I can tell you that her smiling was an opening.  Since you don't know each other, the smile was telling you that she might be interested.  Without question, if she didn't have at least some measure of interest, you wouldn't have gotten a smile!|`|1AFDw5KDaa	She was probably just smiling to be nice.  I walk past guys all the time and smile.  It's just normal, if you are a happy person.   I wouldn't get to worked up or excited over it.. just chill.  If you want, try talking to her. It wouldn't hurt.. even if she isn't interested in you.    xoxo :D|`|M3CVx4N7aa	I smile at random people I've seen around in the hallways at school. It's my way of saying "hi." Maybe you should TALK to her lol    Can someone PLEASE answer my question?! The most recent on my profile?!?|`|jdVxsK4yaa	ther could be alot of reasons y she smild. prob cause she thought u wer cute or somthn. thats the only reason i would smile 2 a guy dat i neva met b4. i thnk dat u shuld try 2 talk 2 her, who knos wat could happn? give it a shot|`|AA11984147	Matt, baby, you sound like a guy who has not made the rounds yet. (smile)  A girl who smiles at you, just smiles.  When you smile back, it's a smile that just made contact with another smile.  NOW - thoughts afterwards - you said you have seen her before - in what capacity? Do you think you like her?  Would you like to get to know her? Then Matt, step up to the plate and start talking.  You gotta get those digits!  Find out where she hangs out.  Show up to have coffee there, or study.  If you see her sitting - go over and introduce yourself.  I am sure- things will go flying after that.     Don't ever feel stupid talking to someone.  That's how we communicate and learn about each other. Nobody says this has to be something....you are just a man meeting a woman.
rmC59Zv9aa	dont talk to her on facebook... she will think stalker lol... just wait to see if you see her again.. if she smiles again when she sees you move in...|`|QBV4cFbqaa	YEAH DON'T ADD HER ON FACE BOOK IT WILL SEEM LIKE YOU ARE STALKING HER. WAIT TO SEE HER AGAIN AND JUST SAY "HEY"  THEN START TALKING TO HER. SHE WILL TALK TO YOU. I THINK YOU ARE OVER ANALYZING THE WHOLE COFFEE SITUATION. SHE WAS DEFINETLY SMILING AT YOU.|`|MYnH6UKQaa	ya talk to her on facebook :D! thats sweet :]]] goodluck!
EdidZdtlaa	no offense i dont think its love though. i just think you really really really like her. you should get to know her better and then ask her out.|`|sKw5GeeMaa	Maybe one day, leave an anonymous note in her locker/on her car/notebook etc. Typed so she wont notice your handwriting.   As for the other guys, look at her past relationships. A lot of guys with smooth sailing? That might mean trouble. Not a lot of trouble, just a few bumps. Or no guys at all? Not to be stereotypical, but shy girls dont get all the guys attention. A lot of girls in my school who are pretty but dont talk or flirt all that much dont have much a relationship world. Besides, i think you'll be fine. If you think you have a spark, she might too. Start with a " what do you think we'd look like as a couple?" That might seem a little straightforward or too obvious, so i guess you could get some other "wanna go out?" starters.
yxceyjBJaa	The man should always pay with heterosexual couples.  With fags, whichever one is a bigger fag should not pay.|`|a8ONCCowaa	YES!  Who ever is treating or asks out on the date.|`|3OT8Lmrgaa	Who ever asked for the date, should always pay, unless you have talked about going dutch prior.|`|x24ERLPSaa	it should be 50/50|`|PosThPHUaa	well, it has always been a custom for the man to pay when going out, but now it's more common for the one who asked out the other to pay, in most cases it happens to be the man and that's why we still feel the man always pays. when it comes to gay couples, like i said before, the one who asked the other one out should pay|`|6PbkXD7laa	if the woman is nice she should offer to pay her half. if the man asked her out he should pay on the first date then split 50/50 on the second. if the women asked the man out split 50/50 on first date then the man pays on the second date unless she insists you don't. if she makes you pay all the time shes not worth dating.|`|3d5b2006369d379cd04e938a9cd52652aa	Yes on the first date.   If you asked her then you should pay, but if she asks then she should pay. Or make it a Dutch date where each pays for their own food.|`|utGddhnVaa	who asked who out? the one who asks out pays. That or the one with the biggest salary.|`|4cQSsDaZaa	the first question yes the second question whoever invited or brought it up first|`|8YDQnUZPaa	DAAAm homie if your going on a date a TRUE MAN PAYS FOR BOTH DINNERS!!|`|aIEkNM0Paa	A GENLTEman will always pay for dinner and i would never go out with a man that will let me pay for dinner he would be CHEAP!! and gay couples everytime one of them pays..|`|WgIZUcYfaa	Yes. At least the first two times. After that you can bring up splitting it, or if you don't mind, you can just pay. I'm not gay, so I am unable to answer the second question. Sorry!|`|224cm8qtaa	YES THE MAN SHOULD ALWAYS PAY WHEN GOING OUT WITH A WOMAN. I'm not gay so I don't know how that would be handled.|`|QMTHlJNtaa	you either pay for dinner or take anal after|`|W0jhffBfaa	when going out with a woman, yes.  But i have no idea about gay couples!|`|AsFiWxhUaa	who ever asked who ever out or just take turns|`|TTfkI4Zqaa	yes. until they have been together for a long while and dont mind doing it every once in a while.|`|QCdpBqhHaa	When I went out on a date w/ another woman, I was prepared to pay the bill or at least half then she insisted in paying, so she did. I guess we have to be prepared in every date.|`|RvFwmQOPaa	I feel that whoever initiates the date should be the one to pay. If a guy asks me out then he should pay. The same goes for a gay couple.|`|CPxLHfKoaa	The Man deffinatly should because it shows that you are willing to take your time and money for the woman.|`|hNvILDqLaa	who ever asked the other one on a date|`|uXeGsxSVaa	I think they should at least a couple of first ones to make a good impression. With gay couples? The more masculine pays I suppose|`|xFk5DVUEaa	well if u r going out with a woman the man has to pay........As for gay couples I have no clue.........|`|PzXq7YKsaa	Yess. Yess. Yess. you dont wanna look liike a jerk offer too pay.|`|KDyG2vCoaa	lmao, the gayer guy who is more feminent should pay|`|CqBGPm5saa	whoever asked who out. if you are the one who asked, you should pay|`|Uv7tkyBPaa	I would expect the man to pay when he takes a woman on a date.     If its more like friends going out for dinner,Split the bill, simple.
Lo53SNJOaa	just go with the flow and you will be fine... send me an email if you need any help|`|ffPla5WDaa	just move your tongue in a diagonal motion, and dont stop moving your tongue, EVER!!!! it's also good to not go to fast, but if he takes controll, just go the speed he goes. there you go thats basically it|`|rPT4J5YLaa	Your worrying too much stop over thinking things. I know easier said that done but when the time comes and you have your first kiss just follow the guys lead, I have always done that and I have always been told I am a great kisser. Just relax and go with the flow. Just only kiss your way to young for anything else and if your not ready to kiss just tell him that if he cares he will understand.|`|1UKe9K6Zaa	naw, he wont dump u. dont freak out.   my first kiss he lead me through it...im sure your boyfriend will to. and just close your eyes, and let it flow. after your first kiss you wont be nervous anymore. good luck hun:)|`|XcVh84qvaa	read this artciel and u will have the perfect kiss honey    http://www.ehow.com/how_4715961_kiss-sen...
JGOOoiI5aa	my guy is the same way he has bad/mean friends you can just go up to them and tell them simply , it doesn't matter what you say hes still gonna date me and that's that so deal with it.i did it and now the guys don't say anything and all you have to do is have your dude there to back you up and they'll leave you alone|`|bmSqEnVgaa	If that guy really liked you he would go with you rather then his friends,  You can also just ignore his friends, they are real jerks, cause they should be nice to the girl there best friend is going out with.    (:|`|uff3kOoFaa	why dont you try to tell them to stop in the first place! its not necessarily your boyfriends job to tell them to. stick up for yourself. tell them to grow up already. tell your boyfriend that your getting really sick of it and you could even say u dont want to hang when his friends are around. sorry bout ur troubles! good luck!
3L4fPlpmaa	ask (Jessica) to ask her about you  i think the reason you guys can only talk on 3 way is because its awkward talking alone. u guys need to hang out more|`|0XvImpdFaa	go with gina k|`|sKmpVHZZaa	just say ...fancy coming to see____(film)____with me ..it looks good...if she says yer ..hu els is going...u say just me an u but u can invite some1 if you like....  if she likes u she wont invite any one  =D hope i helped
Z57WjGlEaa	It depends. Sometimes wite guys don't like black girls because she may not look like a barbie. Blonde hair big boobs and small butt. And wite girls won't like a black guy because she think he will rape her and he won't fit in wit her family. I know that sounds dum but it is true.|`|5r48jn7iaa	well it really shouldn't because looks and stuff shouldn't have anything to do with it but yeah some guys prefer a certain race.|`|BeXHzsSwaa	well it shouldnt if he really likes you!|`|eAyC1mRZaa	guys just want a hott girl|`|ymFZCQnTaa	if your good looking I don't care.|`|aT9HYagEaa	It depends on the guy silly...You will find a guy who likes you for you...just have to wait for the right one! =)|`|MIhYfBf5aa	no it shouldnt matter, im native and i been with white women black women and i just need an asian to complete my circle  if race is a problem then hes an idiot expecially if shes really hot|`|nMWcBYiVaa	naw it shouldnt if u both really like eachother!|`|M7gf7Xoiaa	Sometimes yes sometimes no. everyone has preferences. Don't you?|`|6A8Pr3dNaa	not really i dont think>
WAEDIWz8aa	lisa....    if he really wants to be with you... tell him to choose.    stay strong, u have to do it.    u cant be a door mat anymore. its either you or her. he has to decide. its not fair on both of you. (you and his partner)    good luck xxx
ikacAw7Naa	I wouldn't tell a guy about his performance.  Men like to think they are the best in bed and if you tell him straight out he is liable to leave you.  Instead, the next time you have sex, tell him what you want and don't want him to do and make sure to give him an "ooh" or an "aah" when you like it.  If you don't like something just tell him to do something else.  You are the one who knows your body and what feels good to you.  Everyone can learn a thing or two if we learn to speak up during sex.|`|2esGKO2Caa	Bye Bye|`|0SEYMBKDaa	Don't tell him he sucks, tell him how you want him to do it. Say "not so fast" or "there" He'll learn.|`|GfvxVeZMaa	Lol. I wouldn't tell him he sucks straight to his face... I kindly teach him things =D|`|HNE7dJQiaa	It would destroy him|`|W2pU2g9Eaa	Haha no I wouldn't say hey babe you suck in bed I can't get an orgasm with you. I think the best thing to say is like let's try something new. And you be in control showing him how you like it, he should catch on!|`|AA12016333	it is a feedback; to be taken constructively. so should alert to improve. reacting negatively would be suicidal.|`|smyhq0Ggaa	That's a HUGE blow to a guy's confidence, it could actually end up making him worse in bed.|`|1JU8gJ7jaa	yes i would beacuse.. i would tell him how to do it correctly so its better|`|2AAhiwgnaa	I have never heard this, but most times there are several reasons.    Does he climax too early?---then the guy has to maybe wear a condom or go slowly.    Maybe he is too small where it counts-then he needs to try other positions that help!    Does he not get an erection? Maybe try Viagra or masturbate less.    However, if it is just up to his technique, then he should watch some xxx videos and get some good tips|`|scnW0Wzeaa	Get him The book Sex For Dummy's. Tell him to read it then takes what he learns use it on you.|`|6febee8b4757d9cd4857176f7b29c818aa	Heck no!|`|CEqYjcBeaa	Definitely dont tell him that. It will crush his spirit and will make him feel worthless. Instead you should introduce new things into the mix. Try getting a book or movie and doing something you see. Try getting some toys from the adult store and bringing those in with you guys. Try and find a way to bring out what you desire from him without making him feel like he is doing something wrong.|`|kDZZuxYaaa	i would have to punch her in the mouth if she said that.|`|eAyC1mRZaa	dont tell him it will get his spirits down|`|HjgeyVpiaa	well...i tell my gf she sucks in bed all the time....so sounds good to me....but then again if a chick told me that id beat her down....so be careful|`|S9p8E8hBaa	I dated someone who sucked in bed and I didn't say anything but I was younger. Now I would have said something to him. Not like "you suck".. but maybe "hey why don't you try this, i like that".. Hope that helps.|`|OYQarCjmaa	Oo harsh, he wouldn't like it, well when i say he wouldn't like it, i mean it would hurt just joke about it. If i had to tell my bf that i would probably say somat like " i know this sounds really bad, but you're not that great in bed, but i still love you, and i know we can work past it, but we also can improve it" then give him some tips or something :]|`|h5BkKUIeaa	It would definitely destroy him.  I just teach my boyfriend what I like in steps.  If he doesn't wanna listen, thennnn Id tell him how it is.  or you could just be on top and do the work for yourself.|`|E6N7r7Z7aa	depends on how strong ur relationship is.   if ur afraid to tell him that he isn't good in bed u can give him random tips of what satisfies u|`|e1d342dd8f77492f81cb52e5dd8a32c1aa	don't tell his straight out . just gave him some tips when you guys are in bed. like move his hands with your the way you like it . Or you should ask him something like  ummmm baby what is something you like me doing to you ? or what do  i need to improve on ? what do i need to try ?  then reverse the question i have great sex but it because i can tell my man anything n that's the way it should be  but i know it can by hard cuz Ive being in that situation b4|`|382295137c6bfff032ec42ccdccfd97eaa	First ask yourself that same question and see how you would feel if he told you that. How you ever considered that maybe he feels the same way about ur performance. Now it all depends how you feel about this person is it someone you really care for and is he worth you sticking around due to his lack in sex. Maybe he isnt bad at all its just that the sexual chemistry isnt there.|`|6120b4c0e14e03017c40ad3ceaa54fe7aa	Is it possible he could be truly head over heels for you and simply finds you that attractive?  When I first slept with my wife before we got married I felt like I was 16 again and it was my first rodeo. I found her so attractive that I simply could not maintain for a long periods unlike past relationships. LOL  After the first couple times of embarrasment I was able to maintain once again. It scarred me for a sec, I never had the problem in the past and looking back at it now I believe it was all in my head.
PixwhRR1aa	do what u feel is right, if he was really interested in/ loved you he would want to open his heart to u and not be afraid of attachment (btw i feel like he is using u)|`|EDXh0tk9aa	Date him, don't have sex with him. Hang out, be friends and have fun, that's what High School should be about. Not about getting serious before you even know who or what you like or want or need in a relationship.|`|1H56FPt8aa	Go with your gut. If you think he is using you then your probably right.      But if he isn't. Who cares, you are young, have some fun & enjoy life.|`|FJpshSA4aa	Just have fun. At your age, that's all I would worry about. Chances are any relationships you have won't last until marriage, and they shouldn't. People change a lot over those years. If being with him is fun for the time being, then do it, if it isn't fun, or if you meet someone who you could have more fun with, then don't.|`|S9aY6xLKaa	Sounds like a lame excuse to me, if he really liked you he would date you and not just be hooking up with you.  You should keep your options open because it doesn't sound like he's worth your time.|`|b1e5309d722e5d134ec59e473b707f10aa	Being scared of getting attatched is just a lame, sorry excuse of an answer.  That boy is using you.  Have more self respect than that. To him, you are just a piece of *** honey.  Open your beautiful eyes and realize what is really going on.  You need to drop him.|`|Fc4WF8Pqaa	what's his name going to be after 5mins|`|Ka3pGkw0aa	Move along get someone else.|`|PimNZANIaa	i think that you should use the time you have left and do it or you can still hang out together but nnot hook up|`|nJWnvpx1aa	well there are one of 2 ways you could go with this...    he is like 16 years old, so expecting him to be making adult decisions and "committing" is far fetched.    the other way is, he's a guy... if he wanted to be with you, he wouldn't tell you he doesn't want to get to attached, he would forget about college all together and hell probably forget his future completely for a girl he really wants, so to be honest, he's making excuses... just let him be.|`|ZH6w4KEhaa	Hi Rachel, The first thing I want to ask Do you like him and/or does he like you? Well for one thing I would not go that route, the reason being is that when he goes away he will forget you and find someone new, but if you and him hook up you will get the wrong impression that he likes you and he will mess with you in that matter. I been in this position before and I got hurt in the long run so, if I were you just be friends and if you both agree to go further than do so.. Hope this helps.. Good luck.:)
RtAML1fJaa	i would say yes|`|W0JEvD1laa	Sounds like a good situation. you get laid and you dont have to talk to her.LOL|`|aLwrpMPXaa	Well, you are her little "sex object". If you don't like that, I would suggest you talk to her !|`|XmxN58XCaa	So?  Why Complain?|`|EDYETUNCaa	Yes, you're being used big time.|`|hhduYRfdaa	Yes bro, if your looking for an "emotional connection", you should probably look elsewhere.    Best of luck|`|GaouUtGTaa	Yesh, u are being used for "it"|`|MQowfPbOaa	sorry to say it, but you are just being used. if you don't want to be used, then the next time she calls be like "look. i'm sorry, but i am done being used. please forgive me, but it isn't right at all to do this."
3HhhHWd4aa	Yes, it has happened to me twice.    I went on a date with a couple girls, they asked me to their room, and I didn't understand that she wanted to have sex with me.  So they didn't call back or anything.    It pissed me off cuz I didn't even know what they wanted...|`|eO4y3m1maa	If a guy dumps you because of that...thats all he saw you for. He didnt like you, he just wanted to screw you...don't worry about it...guys like that know they can get away with it if the girls keep crawling back....|`|Qha8g6aoaa	Well obviously there was not going to be anything in those relationships more than just sex if you got dumped for not having sex on the first date! My fiance has always said that sex should be on at least the second date but no later than the third. I believe you should know the person before you have sex if they mean anything to you.|`|abc74a7841250ed8830346d501f162a7aa	JUST goes to show you WOMEN need to BE TAKEN CARE OF ,if you cant do it SOMEBODY ELSE WILL OK !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
8LXzXewdaa	http://www.wikihow.com/Get-Over-a-Break-...    this website helped me. not immediately but it helped me figures out how to not think about it.     As much as you think you need to be friends right away, you shouldn't because that's going to make you feel like you want to get together and stuff, it won't help. Also, it helps if you don't talk for a while.. It'll hurt but after a while you'll realize why you aren't talking. It'll get better after a while and you can be friends again just not right away.|`|FgT4CDpBaa	Honestly, If I were in your position I would try my best to act "happy" or not bothered by what had happened. It might be a little hard at first, but once you start to act like things are the way they used to be, you will notice that it will start to actually feel that way again.  You might not like it or want to do this, but it really does help. Trust me, haha. I've been in this position before.    and if you're the type who wants to make him jealous, hook up with another guy or one of his friends. Only if that's something you'd do though.. of course.     xoxo,  hope things work out!|`|oadV46kYaa	ive been in your situation, im still dealing with it myself.  the feelings never really go away, but in time it will ease and you will move on. you're scared to lose a really good friendship, but for now it's weird so you might want to cut off communication with him to let everything cool down and when you think you can speak to him without your feelings taking over, only then you should start talking to him. (saying hi is still okay, but conversation wise might not be a good idea)  and go out with friends a lot, occupy yourself and not think about it so much or else it will eat you and you can never fully move on.  i was really good friends with my ex, i went out with him and now we're just friends. in the beginning it was rough, but since i did the advice im giving to you..we're friends, maybe not as close as before, but still having him as a friend is better than nothing at all. hope that helped|`|jv6X26IAaa	I'm sorry, but I won't even try to give you a definitive answer. Instead I'll share my own story, for what it's worth.    I live in Madrid and have been going out with Jorge (I am gay, btw) for 18 months. I can frankly say that those were very good times of my life and I will never regret them - there was a lot of laughter and happiness. He adored my company and tried to love me as I loved him, but there was no "spark" for him. Nevertheless, in December we decided to live together, and have really made a lovely house.    At Xmas I went up to Scotland to see my family and we would have gone together except that the plane tickets were exorbitant, so he stayed here with his family. When I returned on the 5th I began to get suspicious and rightly so. He was spending evenings out, and had found ANother. Now it looks likely that the other will come to live here (there are 2 bedrooms). The weeks have been a living hell, with ANother staying over 3 times now. Jorge desperately doesn't want to lose me - he got me good, steady work in his company - and has begged me to remain in the flat.    That is the story so far. Hope it has helped.
uff3kOoFaa	ask her if she has a boyfriend. if she says no, then say 'anyone close?' and she'll maybe tell u. if ur good enough friends she may just tell u she likes you.    you could also get another friend that's a girl to ask who she likes. idk pay her or something lol. there are plenty of options!     good luck!  ~Lex|`|KXYqCgWxaa	write her a note|`|AA11058500	I have bad news for you. from much personal experience and stories from friends (who denied my advice), telling a girl you like her RARELY works out in your favor. I'm pretty much sure that if you've been flirting with her, talking to her a lot, trying to hang out with her...she prob knows you like her. if you feel confident enough, ask her out. but if you dont feel confident enough, build up more of a relationship.|`|Kp6JYaMAaa	you say "will you go out with me?"
Me3Tsul0aa	I think both of you are having trouble cope around each other. Someone always ends up starting a fight, right?  So, maybe you should try this. Get him to sit down and have a chat to him. Tell him that maybe you two should spend some time apart, a couple of months when you both realise if you two want to get into further relationship.  Get him to read this, because I can tell you surely are concerned about your relationship.  Some time apart might make things better.    Takecare and All the Best    XOXO
wJ1v0cX0aa	you will know when you will go to him and start talking to him. If he shows interest you'll see it.

Or eventually you will explode one day and have one big melt down.|`|GfvxVeZMaa	I'm really sorry to hear that! All I can really say is time heals all. It may take awhile but you'll love again.   Take your time hun, don't be worried about not moving on fast enough. It'll happen when the time is right.|`|SFeNqLbNaa	girl! its not your fault he died!!! dont blame yourself and think that it will happen to u again, because your old bf died becuase of an entirely different reason and not everyone you love will leave you like that! keep dating and find the one for you. its better to have loved and lost to have never loved at all.|`|GCrh3INjaa	omgg. im so sorry about the loss. You have every right to still be upset about that. But you shouldn't be afraid to get back out there just cause you might think that will happen again. Because that's not something that happens alot. So chances are it wont happen again. You shouldn't be scared to say yes to people if they like you, because then it wont help you get out of your shell.|`|ZzRO7Dyaaa	give urself time. u need to get over him first only then u can think abt sumone else. so just take it easy...and think that ur bfs past and u have ur life ahead to live. once u overcome this feeling... only then u can ever think of any other guy otherwise every time u will c any guy or get a proposal frm a guy the first thing that will come in ur head is ur bf. so just give it a little time and time heals it... have a nice life. tc|`|iZrMceyxaa	keep yourself busy... time will heal... time will help you to get over it. Don't be so hard on yourself, try to do every day something nice for yourself... and know: It does take time to get over somebody who was this important to you.|`|M3CVx4N7aa	You have to get back out there, girl!  Every love is different.|`|W2h5gxccaa	Well he wouldn't want you to miss out on opportunities because of what happened. He would want you to move on and live a happy life. You don't necessarily have get over him, but if you cant, then do it FOR him. I'm sorry....I hope it helps|`|qSgdlWWNaa	Hey, first of all I just wanted to say that Im sorry that he passed away. Now, on to the advice. The only thing to do is wait until the time is right. The hurt will never truly go away, and you'll probably always wonder what could have happened if he was still here. Once you're ready to date again, you'll know, and you wont feel guilty about it. If you were in love with him, it will be even harder, but just so you know, eventually you'll get past this and you will feel fine about other guys. Don't worry about betraying him because you're not, and in time you'll love him as a friend. Another thing you shouldn't worry about is forgetting him. You wont. Anyway, good look and I hope you get some good answers here.|`|07e43dE9aa	People fall in love and breakup very often, but when you find that special someone and you break up, or they pass away it might be a little harder to deal with, especially if they had died.     However, I am sure your ex-boyfriend would want you to be happy and live your life, even if he isint near. Some people go in denial, like I did, but its a phase and it will soon pass. Right now, I would suggest you to watch a few love tragedy movies, such as P.S I love you. I think this is a GREAT movie to watch, at your state of mind and i am sure it will help you feel much, much better. Even if you've watched it again, watch it once more on the internet, or you can even buy it so you can watch it more often.    After the phase of crying, you get into depression. Where your body is often slouched over, and you drag your feet, and life itself seems like a drag. The best thing to do in this situation is to make it the complete opposite. Life is as complicated as how you make it. I belive in this statement truly, and I feel that if you want to get over you ex, two things come in consideration. First, is time. We all need time to recover ourselves, nature and even our bodies need time to heal effectively. I advice you to keep yourself busy so that time passes more quickly. When I had a breakup, I found life very boring and felt lonely. I quickly tried out for two dance teams and made both of them, and now I've found a passion I'd like to persue. Thats what I can advice or you. Pursue some of your interests, Join a club, get with a few friends and do something fun. Soon, time will pass and you'll notice that your heart has automatically immuned itself towards the loss of your boyfriend.    The second thing you need is the motive for getting over him. You cant just sit there and cry, and expect to get over him. You can do it the first couple of times but after that you need to have the motive to get over him. A little bit of self control can go a long way. Do your best to avoid thoughts of him, pictures, memories anything ! Just block everything you have, and put it in your basement or your closet or somewhere but do NOT throw it away.    After a few months, when you feel ready and you feel that youve gotten over him, then take out all those memories or pictures. Take a long at them, cherish the memories,but keep them locked up in your heart. At this time, cry your heart out, cuz you certainly deserve it. Then go another few months without looking at his stuff, and after another few months look at all those pictures. You'll find that slowly you'll be getting over him. You probably will smile at all those memories, than crying and laugh at all the GOOD times youve had. You wont even think of him as an ex, but more as a good friend who had given you some of the best times in your life.    I assure you, this technique would work, However it is gradual and would take time. Just learn to chill, maybe be interested in other guy, go to clubs with your friends, look for guy friends to boost your confidence. Do usual things that would raise your confidence so that you can go hook up with other guys. Dont be scared that the same thing will happen, cuz if it does you just need time to get over it and do it again. Think of it as a win-win solution. If you fall in love with some other guy, then you get to cherish all those memories, and if by some chance you guys break-up, then its natures way of saying that he wasnt the one for you and that you should keep looking for your soul make.    Good luck,   I am sure you'll get over him, hun. :)
9Sy4Fefdaa	No, he died.    Sorry..|`|AB3D5gIJaa	what you can do is try to forget about him and see if you can find someone that treats you the same way he did.|`|dGyX3E8Faa	I'm sorry.     But yeah it is him.|`|jj2tSASnaa	ask god|`|vHCRW6IAaa	yes he is there spiritually.|`|VDlvSMP1aa	YES! I am a firm believer and a friend of a few physchic. And if you feel his presence, he is definitley there.    I wish you the best, losing loved ones is hard.|`|cf84769c39c0ba4a53a95535563ec1e3aa	I hope you're taking your meds, lol!  Okay, I don't mean to be mean...but you need to get a life beyond the beyond.  In other words regardless of your "passed" bf still "being by you" you still have a life to live and enjoy.  Don't let the perception that he's still with you stop you from living.  Find a new love and life will proceed as normal regardless of a "presence".  PEACE & BEST OF LUCK!|`|GIqkuzWSaa	if u believe that hes there then it is him know that he loves u and will be there for u     all the best xx|`|nLFr9csfaa	Of course he is. And I've heard they will send us little presents. You just have to be open to it.|`|FuPY6Dr0aa	look i just lost my girl not from death but from me hurting her =[ ha, her name is kayla too what do ya know. any ways i always feel like she will love me but this time i think i lost her for good and look if your boy loved you then he will always be by your side dead or not beause i know if i died i would always be with the girl i lost =[|`|Lxrunkxwaa	He will always be with you because he will have a special place in your heart. Spiritual presence however, I'm not sure if he is there. It all depends on what you believe. I believe that he may be watching out for you, but from the better place to where his spirit has passed on. What you may be feeling is the comforting and reassuring presence of God, watching out for you and protecting you.     I'm sorry for your loss, sweetie, but just remember that your boyfriend is in a better place now and you will see him again one day.
vExQCsNYaa	Buy a heart shaped box of chocolates and just write her the cheesiest poem ever with her name in it.     or    If you know where she lives, go to her house at night (not too late), play some cheezy love song really loud on a radio, and lip sing it. This one might tick off her parents or neighbors.|`|eO4y3m1maa	Just go up and ask her!|`|DaFIrZVxaa	Ask her flat out! notes make you look unconfident. its okay to feel embarrassed.|`|DXjCEXAkaa	There's several ways! Does your school send out Valentines grams? You might want to get her one of those so that during class she gets a balloon or a card or something. That might be last minute though. If she has a locker you can slip a cute little card. My best friend asked a girl to prom by having him and his friends hold up poster boards asking her to go with him while she did a routine on the football field.
HaLJADjiaa	your going to have to tell the diffrence between fun flirting and real flirting. Im a guy and i flirt with my friends that are girls all the time, and i don't like them that way. You have to figure out which he type of flirting he's actualy doing, then act on it. if its just for fun flirting, its OK, it its real flirting, its only OK if his girlfriend knows about it. Also think, do you like him or is he a good friend? bcus once you start dating and then breakup, the friendship you had will, in most probability, never be the same. i hope i helped.|`|aWvuZJjRaa	he has a girlfriend. dont be a boystealer. and when your this young, you dont really know what a relationship is. so dont kid yourself.|`|vQmO3N6Raa	Stay away from him.... he probably does this with every girl, and seriously, would you want to be with him if and he's doing the stuff he's doing to to you to another girl while you guys were dating?     I wouldn't trust him, and it'd cause too much conflict with other people.  Be with someone who just like YOU and ONLY you.    And i know being with this guy sounds like the most awesome thing, And very tempting, BUT don't make him cheat, don't stoop that low.  Your probably better than that. =]|`|pgfgzz5Jaa	well its wrong on his part mostly to flirt when he has a girl but you are wrong for going along with it|`|7l3YdrNvaa	no........... your 13. hes just pimp as|`|Aod9Hhauaa	oh kids these days you guys gotta stop watching those one tree hill and oc shows so young. drama.|`|zNLSWBmVaa	I know right same situation keeps eying me lol your time will come im sure! but 4 now plz anwser my question ( my friends just ditched me) 1st click my avatar its the 1st question thnx!|`|oE6xHrZ8aa	No not wrong, but sounds like this guy hangs out with a lot of girl. And I am guessing you are not the only one he says these kind of things to..Just beware b/c he seems like a player and might only being playing games with you..|`|wUbvU3aiaa	He has a girlfriend and calls you his future wife?|`|qAd0QmZEaa	no.|`|3mnYzbPVaa	Imagine being his girlfriend. You find out that he's flirting with another girl behind your back and calling her his future wife.    Do you really want this guy? You can presumably do better.|`|BO4ND6x5aa	well... seeing that hes got a girlfriend it is wrong and seems to me hes just a flirt.. in other words his words might just be words n nothing more at your age a hug can mean almost anything so try to relax a bit and just wait.. last thing you would want to do is get between his girlfriend n him...    so good luck n hope I've helped|`|f5AdfVuOaa	at 13 things are not seriuos love even though you might think so.  He obviously doesn't care about flirting with you while he's got GF, but my concern would be if you did get with him how the ex would feel & maybe your other 3 friends might try & move in too as they like him too.    Just have fun & do what's right at that moment.|`|1O000fTJaa	I'd say get over him...  He obviously doesn't treat his current girlfriend well if he calls you his future wife.  If you ever got together with him he'd treat you just as bad no doubt.   If you really want to be treated badly though....go for it.  That's a choice you'll have to make.  Good-luck!|`|4apGEMGzaa	your 13.. thats like harmless middle school flirting. dont get so serious about relationships yet.. you have plenty of time for that.|`|ZIZb8p48aa	He is just passing his time. I know him, Don't believe him and stop him from calling you his future wife. He has no interest in you. Just be like good friends.|`|9Q4xRCDBaa	Well be honest and tell him you wanna **** his brains out and probably experiment with your finger!

Skinny thick meaning they are skinny but thick in the right areas.|`|o2QHQMCEaa	I think you will get a much more honest answer by asking what turns guys on. Turn offs can change so frequently and easily.     Being fat can be so subjective... Some guys love big girls with big breasts and some guys prefer thin girls but ALL of us have a different definition of what a big or thin girl is.     The last date I went on was with a woman who is 170 lbs but 5'10". To many guys thats too big but for me, MM MM MM, its just right. Curves in the right places and long legs...     Now what you could get in turn offs would be things like bad hygene, poor manners, inability to hold a conversation.... etc.

Kids are wonderful and can be a good thing and a strain both...on a marriage. Marriage is about compromise sometimes..and not with one person doing all the compromising. There will be rough times but this is where the "for better or worse comes" in...now I don't mean stick with him or her if they are abusive physically or mentally or if he or she is unfaithful. I am talking about little things that will make you nuts eventually. The thing is you married the person "as is" and problems occur when one or both parties try to change the other or think that they will eventually change their spouse into the perfect partner...IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN LOL anyway, the first year can be tough because you are with that person all the time, really getting to know them. I say it is good to have outside interests and or hobbies this way your partner can do his or her own thing and you can do yours. This gives you time away to be you and not just an extension of some other person.  Anyway, if you go into your marriage with realistic views your marriage can be rewarding and last...Good luck to you if you are contemplating marriage......|`|WcIeLbQ1aa	I'd love to be married.

You only live once and who cares what anyone thinks.  You should always do what you want to do in your life, because it is your life and you have to live it.  The End!  Good Luck!|`|TRvAhhNKaa	Start with "Hi, I'm _____." I've seen you around and I think you're cute. Want to hang out sometime?    Or you could just stalk the heck out of him and see him in court when he files that restraining order with the judge. ;-)|`|rsyRfdPXaa	in school their is always a girl looking at me what should i tell her? when i walk down the halls she's looking at me|`|OJJWNuDdaa	this happend to mee this year. and now we are dating.. just talk to him. seriously, you dont have to have a permission slip to talk to him. i just kinda came up to him and started talking about random stuff.|`|cUyxNNDGaa	go up to him and say something that only you two would get. Like a funny inside joke in your class or something. But definatly go talk to him! GO GET HIM!!! good luck|`|FSKiPO1Laa	say i love u|`|4dOUhlTtaa	just start to ask him about the homework or just look at her eyes and smile and tel him"what was science homework?"|`|SDdSY7J3aa	start smiling at him when you see him, but not obvious. like very subtle. if hes in any of your classes casually say hi or compliment him. if he has  myspace or facebook add him it really is a great way to get to know people without the awkwardness of confrontation|`|MtqEHBz1aa	oh- em- gee i was just in this problem a few months ago...and kinda still am.well i can really help u on this one, if you see this guy around school like in the hallways or something then you should just like start saying hi to him and stuff. then you should like build up the courage to formally introduce yourself to him and stuff you know the whole "hi my name is blah blah" then just say straight up i like you (guys like it when your straight forward) and if you don't want to do that then keep it short and sweet and leave that part out. maybe you could like ask him to meet u after school or something so u guys can talk more and stuff and flirt a little when you ask him to give him a heads up that u like him and pray that he flirts back. hope i helped buh-bye
AA11764855	talk about something funny that happened to you or in one of your classes and youre positively going to get into a convo. just make sure  you get rid of that because i didnt and i lost the best thing that ever happened to me|`|QtJ0cKjGaa	Nothing can be done when you are in love but to cherish the wonderful feeling.|`|175ydQo5aa	your his GF, your allowed to be goofy and stuff. just go say Hi, and that will normally work out pretty good|`|ZZCTwXa4aa	nahh just be like hey wasup and try to sound reeeeeeeaaaaal cute|`|MHwn4Tlzaa	this too will pass.  it's just a phase.|`|fegUIil3aa	be yourself.   the sooner you are, the sooner you'll feel comfortable around him.     and he'll see who you are, and if he really likes you for you then he's a keeper!     [:    and when you have no idea what to say,   that'll pass in time.. but complimenting how he looks or smells can always be a good conversation starter.   [plus you'll most likely get a compliment in return!]    short and sweet,    love.|`|1AFDw5KDaa	Hey hunny.  I know exactly what your talking about.  When you see him, walk up to him and say hi in a cute little voice and give him a hug. Ask him how he is and usually your conversation will start from there. It may seem silly or embarrasing, but once you just start doing it, you'll realize that it's not that hard. Plus, you guys will get more comfortable with each other. After all, he is just a boy. Try to tell yourself that boys are just like girls except they have different physical features. :)    Good luck.|`|29ddeea7f871392bf7b17a12fc77a694aa	just go up to him grab him by the stuff and say lets go now !!!!!!!!!!!|`|Tc1BO5kkaa	youll get over it soon. just try to act normal like you were before you went out.|`|Pe7pXCbwaa	be urself, and if urself is not what he lyks, then hes not the right one :D|`|SJ5ipSvUaa	hmmmm idk. maybe you should spend more time with him and it will probably get rid of your nerves after a while|`|IN1wPKwoaa	just do what i do in an awkward situation: keep smiling works all the time for me|`|AWoH1oN0aa	you'll be just fine ...just be yourself|`|A6ej3lQWaa	just be urself|`|5zdmwHIhaa	Stop being embarrassed and enjoy!|`|1qXLDOiPaa	definitly be yourself... and if your still not comphortable then ... time to get a new bf!!|`|Flf0IjPcaa	ok walk up to him and smile and say hay how was ur night and then be all like mine was fine and then sa well i will c u after then next call and give him a hug and tell him be and then walk away!!!|`|b25a74469233f38d4ab50bb09a3c6f0caa	LOL OMG i had the same feeling with my new bf, like omg anything that embarrassed me infront of him and i just wanted TO DIE!, but u know wat, after a while he seemed more than human to me, instead of this great being, now i feel more comfortable with him, altough every now and then still get blushed, just act normal. even if inside u are super nervous.|`|Ej5ykFwYaa	keep in mind he more than likely feels the same way. Take a deep breath . know how awsome you are and relax.A nice smile lets him know how you feel about him you don't have to say alot.|`|ZqkEFdd7aa	If you dont know what to say, ask him something....then just listen to what he is saying, follow along with what he's telling you.    That way, you wont be focused on your fear of being embarassed...you will be listening to him. If you do that enough times you will lose that fear of being embarrassed.    The idea here is to force yourself to stop worrying about yourself so much|`|ObN1KHb5aa	Well, I'm not gonna tell you to "just be yourself" because everyone knows that's so lame.  I'm 15 and my best advice to you is to always think everyone likes you, including your boyfriend.  If everyone already likes you, then you don't have to worry about impressing anyone, right?  Confidence is sexy. :]
JCFLE9mGaa	Then pin him down and scream AM I SEXYYYYYYY?!?>~!?!|`|abc74a7841250ed8830346d501f162a7aa	Well for one thing focus on yourself 4 YOURSELF .I am sure you are SEXY TO other GUYS if you just leave his BORING ___-AT HOME a weekend ,then you will see the PROBLEM is YOUR BOYFRIEND NOT YOU ...GOOD LUCK|`|Lxrunkxwaa	Dump him because no boy is ever worth changing yourself for. Losing that extra dead weight, a.k.a. the boyfriend, will make you feel great and earn yourself some self-respect and confidence. And what's sexier than confidence and self-respect?
j2yhjBDiaa	Sounds like an evil stepmother to me!|`|FIALhwlKaa	Looks like she doesnt like you. Try to talk to your father or any other family member. If she doesnt change her behavior, you need to look for another place to stay - its to unhealthy for you.|`|2AAhiwgnaa	because she is trying to kill you?
TCqrS8Vqaa	HIYA KEELY, he was testing you.you don't tell any boy you like them.wait till you are dating them first.|`|jbTNER3caa	A lot of people like multiple people at the same time.  But that doesn't mean they're going to go out with all of them.  Plus I'm sure they have history and stuff.  Probably they're going to try to make it work.  Sorry sweetie, but I would move on.  I'm sure that, like him, you have a crush on at least one other person.|`|1keH3R6paa	He's a player. Don't even go there.
HOQp0gA7aa	You have to live life a bit more before you understand that many women just don't think in the same way that men do.  Men frequently make the mistake of thinking that women are just like us with different genitalia.  This is wrong.      Women work on their own system of rationality which presumes everyone understands their reasoning.   Thus they make intuitive leaps in conversations that men find irrational and confusing.  Smart men eventually learn to just accept these leaps and stop worrying about filling in the gaps.  Semi smart men convince themselves that it is possible to put together a cypher to decrypt intuitive female logic.      Just mark it down as something that made sense to her to talk about at the time, and stop trying to figure out her master motivation or plan behind the discussion.  You will save yourself a ton of aggravation later if you do so.    Edit:  Who gave several users here so many negative thumbs?  There were not that many nonresponsive or bad answers to deserve this action.  Giving plus thumbs for those who certainly didn't deserve it.    I hope this helps.|`|AA11441704	mistake|`|LykjWv6faa	Perhaps she wants to see your reaction?|`|9580a1e44dd3d2bae7d2f867611ab353aa	? Probably trying to make you a little jealous, wanting you to step up and ask her out.|`|2esGKO2Caa	She's playing you. She wants you to know that she's a catch and if you screw up she can move on easily. She is insecure.|`|m5uzV6uqaa	she probs does like you.    :)|`|el9wtu9Uaa	Chicks are weird dude. Never be able to explain them.|`|e3AnmkfUaa	Duh, cause she wants you to know you are the only clueless hick for her?|`|AA11298074	she may be trying to make you jealous yet let you know she's still available....just a thought|`|oAWwJ0Evaa	>to show you someone else wanted her but she rejected him  >making you feel jelous  >and hinting that maybe she rejected him becuase she likes you  >making you realise that other guys want her as well   >that your not the only guy in her life and that she could have anyone easily   some of them mistakes some of them a clever way of hinting things to you  etc|`|1keH3R6paa	Hmm, if she talked to you about a guy to you, she obviously isn't into. Sorry, but that's the facts. If you talked to her and she starts off with the guy, then she is looking for a shoulder to cry on. Move on. And if she rejected a guy that she talked to you about, she's a rude and conceited person. Hope I helped.|`|LUC2GDxTaa	She obviously trusts you, as this is a kinda big secret... She probably thinks of you as a friend she can confide in. She probably rejected him because she didn't like him... There's nothing unusual about this situation.|`|thmlwAZDaa	probally to tell you that she is interested in you and not some other guys and she wants you to ask her out  or  she just sees you as a friend and just told you to get it off her chest|`|At8D5Xu2aa	Women think you'll like them better if you know that they've had other offers, especially if they've rejected the other offers for you.  It's a crass attempt at emotional manipulation--in my opinion, very bad form.  But you shouldn't just drop her because she has no social grace.  After all, she may be really good in bed.|`|kqylekVBaa	that chicks crazy!   RANDOMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM|`|GwA7m9Fdaa	Maybe she saw he wasn't what she liked in a guy...Didn't like his personality...idk|`|YDYsjSdZaa	she wants to show u she likes you|`|0swcJtkqaa	She might be giving you the hint that since she rejected the other guy it may be becuase she is waiting for you to ask her out. Shes just trying to bring that up on purpose becuase she probaly likes you to|`|DkzErJrGaa	she's trying to get a reaction out of you to see what you'd respond with.... your response will let her know if you're interested in her or not, maybe shes trying to figure you out with little games. If it's already known that you 2 like each other, she could just be trying to make you jealous as well, again to get another reaction.|`|THVIIcuTaa	She might've just talked about him to make you jealous. Us girls are SO confusing..haha|`|AA11611493	Girls are weird- and I'll be the first to say it as a woman.     Does she know you like her? Maybe thats her way of rejecting you OR  showing off in a way  or maybe she wants you to make a move.    Some girls have insecurity issues and do weird things--- Im not sure what else I can say without more info.  sorry!|`|98bdfc1a990db965d44afece3a62a73faa	Well I hate to say this but you might want to consider that she is just trying make him jealous and playing hard to get.Not saying this really is how she feels or she might have had something telling her not to go out with him and he just misses him so she looks up to you to vent her feelings.Just listen to her and do not do that back to her.Girls like a guy who listens to their problems.Maybe you could even talk to her about the situation.Try to make her forget even.|`|VueO3Njuaa	typical girl stuff.  yes, i think she likes you.  she was just trying to make you jealous   i say that if you like her, you should be a man and ask her out|`|T0IX5F6jaa	I THINK THAT SHE THINKS THIS GUY IS CUTE BUT, SHE REJECTED HIM CUZ SHE DOESNT REALLLY LIKE HIM. I THINK THST SHE KNOWS YOU BEST AND SHE ONLY WANTS YOU AND SHE WONT CHANGE HER MIND....BUT MAYBE SHE IS AFRAID THAT YOU DONT FEEL THE SAME WAY. MAYBE YOU SHOULD TELL HER HOW YOU FEEL THEN IF SHE FEELS THE SAME WAY THINGS WILL WORK OUT BETWEEN YOU AND IF SHE DOESNT...TALK TO HER ABOUT HOW COMFORTABLE SHE FEELS AROUND YOU. IT REALLY HELPS FOR GIRLS TO TALK TO A GUY ABOUT RATHER SHE IS COMFORTABLE OR NOT.|`|twortDpyaa	girls are weird.  but basically she's bringing up that she's single and that maybe you should make a move :O|`|tv7a1ixiaa	I think maybe she does like you, maybe hinting in a weird way that she likes you.
v5ZDIfLPaa	Ok you have known her for 2years, so she wont laugh at you and just relax andi herd that size doesn't matter its how you use it lol but just relax and keep cool and things will be ok|`|lruNgvFyaa	1st if  your not married don't do it.  2st if your scared don't do it.|`|TTQrcJ77aa	Head-on. Apply directly to the forehead. Head-on|`|JuXb4u4gaa	most penis' are not that big the size is like 4 to 6 inches thats it. so dont be scared its normal for a guy to be scared of his size when he first has sex|`|4SVZ84LNaa	Hun she will not laugh if anything she's probably just as nervous as you. She's been with you for two years and sleeping together is a big deal so she's doing it because she loves you.  Size isn't important anyway. You will discover how to make each other feel good and before you know it you'll wonder what you were worrying about. Just relaxe and enjoy it xx|`|sXhVy22baa	my explanation would be to not have sex yet.  if you guys dont see each other that often then sex would most likely complicate things more.  if you have sex dont plan it. just hang out when you see each other and see where it leads you|`|lIncjtIwaa	Honestly 15 is way too youung to have sex. But hey just be open with her let her know how you feel.|`|feX4x9vCaa	lolololol i dont tink she care u gettin laid bro lolollolololollololololol|`|XT148Jl1aa	do not stress|`|ZA11WBR2aa	You guys are just kids and you should not be having sex at this age.|`|zxQT3Uo5aa	This should be your decision too and at this point it does not sound like it is.  You don't sound stupid at all but your concern makes me wonder if you are ready for this.  If your girlfriend cares for you at all, there will be no laughing.  Regardless of its size your penis will work well.|`|gvsN4nHcaa	if youre scared then that means youre not ready for sex. just tell her youre not ready. if shes a good girlfriend then shell respect that.|`|FrPVteUIaa	Why are you asking this question on yahoo, do you think we want to know?? Ask your  mom!!!|`|d7OswsvMaa	Well she should have known what she was getting into!..lol.. anyway its been 2yers..& she hasnt dumpd u..soo.. itll be fine.. just be proud of what u got!.. "got it!..flaunt it!".& btw ur 15!!!..ur stil growing!.|`|sfJp4QNJaa	If she loves you she will not laugh. I would suggest that you use lots of foreplay. ;)  Though I must stress that having sex before 16 in the UK is very much a criminal offence and there are risks especially for the female, the data from studies suggest that sexual intercourse at a young age can contribute to the 'bringing  on' of cervical cancer|`|a7iuLw4Kaa	OKAY FIRST OFF, LMAO.  SECOND OF ALL, GET A PENIS PUMPER!(:|`|6I1nxRAAaa	Girls do not care what size you are.... they make judgement based on love.|`|mF0L5jMNaa	If , at age 15, she has another penis to compare to yours, you are with the wrong gal.  I'd wait another two years when yours is at its adult size.|`|3IXj7jQNaa	how do you know you are small?  has she ever seen one? she may not have a clue.  but.... you  should wait until you are in love and married with a good job'you never know what could happen.|`|7U9UAtTSaa	At 15 you are a bit young and it is illegal|`|Ekra9yrhaa	Hi Rob, obvioulsy i don't advice you having sex until your old enough. 18 if usa or 16 uk. but ok here goes. you need to ask your self this. if u feel that u love her and she loves you. then size would not  matter. but if she does laugh then she clearly is immature to have sex. also, if she hasn't had sex before she won't notice size.    hope this has helped. and just have fun, cause if you worry about it. you won't be able to perform.|`|a094e88abfa530c89b6055e83ffcca55aa	its not the size of the ship its the motion of the ocean. Penis size has NOTHING to do with good sex. If you are uncomfortable with sex and she loves you don't be afraid to tell her.it is very responsible of you to be concerned but again men make a way bigger deal about size then women do.Women want to snuggle and kiss and before you know it you are done having sex don't be so concerned about it
eYuIsNk1aa	okay this were women need to grow up the truth is for men  the whole point for dating for men is sex. we don't really want to get to know you till we have seen you naked till then all we hear is blah blah blah till that happens its us just trying to figure out how to get in your pants after that then we start thinking about hey she is really cool I want to get to know you better or good God she is annoying time to move on.  Sorry I know this not what you want hear & most people will want to tell what they think you want to hear.|`|gWFkERouaa	yes.    everyone does.|`|hLUxMcKqaa	Hold out for the gold.  No ring - no nookie.  Go for "deep thoughts" immediately.  It scares off the creeps.  Pray.|`|9qdeLOYqaa	Well, i know allot of men are like that  And i know allot of people say that all men are like this  But i know not all of them are..  I know because i CAN fall in love with someone for themselves  And not their looks, Guys like that do walk around  You just need to find one, I think you can recognize someone like that.  They look really sincere.   They dont look at your boobs.  They listen to you.  They will ask you things to get to know you better.    Well good luck finding them    Your friend|`|VfCwhcC6aa	yeah i think will find a guy that likes you for you becuz i kno this boi named ryan and he likes for my personality i think it is plenty more out there jus look hard|`|YRJEC46laa	Of course!! theres always someone for everyone!!!! trust me! It might take awhile but YES YOU WILL FIND THAT SPECIAL MAN Who will like you for they way you are!!!!! :) No matter if you are in sweats and no make up or in the most beautiful dress in the world he will just see past all that and will love you for who you are. Good luck! (Oh and Ps he could just be right around the corner!)|`|HOfvrus1aa	look for the good guy and he will like u for u|`|029d970e89f49628d1a27a4f7084f48faa	That's why you need to really get to know these guys before you date any of them. If they stick around to find out who you are inside, they're keepers. If they act disinterested in your conversation, forget them. And don't stop looking til you find the right guy - I can promise that as you get older, the guys get more mature and stop dating for looks.|`|AA11984147	Sounds like you are having a personal moment of not trusting yourself and your self esteem is getting a beatdown.  First, re-evaluate why you think guys go out with you.  Are you pushing the female thing heavily? (makeup, hair, sexiness). Sometimes, guys only see that and are only interested in 'that thing'.      Perhaps you should move your appeal to another direction.  What do you like to do? Are you into sports? Any clubs or other organizations?  Get involved with groups of people who are really doing things. (this includes hiking and other sports that might not be so 'cute'.) Make sure you are comfortable with you and then you won't have to question why someone else is dating you.  Stop dating for a while and get in touch with yourself.     When you do go out - in your own way, let them know you are a friendly girl, but you won't be used.  Stand firm and select friends who you have observed to be genuine.     I had a friend who dressed down (glasses, wore her skirts long, boots, tied her hair back in a ponytail) - anything not to attract the attention seekers in a way that overrated her looks.  She eventually found a nice guy who accepted her for who she was inside - not how she looked outside.|`|X40Ww89qaa	no|`|dd6rgtL7aa	Of COURSE you will. There's someone amazing for everyone. Don't settle.    As for guys who are just using you? You'll just have to learn to weed out the bad ones quick.|`|PvblSV0Naa	next time you agree to go out with a guy make sure you get to know him first. and yes you will find a person that likes you for who you really are.|`|kLslWQR8aa	Trust me you will I went through the same thing and know its different guys are actually dating me cause they like me for who i am not how i look so just hold on and you will find someone|`|mxD3vkUQaa	I think there's always someone for someone else.  Try getting to know them closely first.  And if they ask you out say you want to get to know them first.  Then you can make the decision :)    XXX|`|ssXPqdOraa	What you do is when your talking to a guy bring out your true personality, 1 a guys likes that, and 2 you can tell if they are being true or not.|`|6I1nxRAAaa	Lotta guys like my sis becuz she's gunna be 18 soon.....  You can't get away from that. Just keep your chin up and don't let yourself go. You'll get a decent dude|`|XHBjoWtyaa	Absolutely. Personally I am the kind of guy who gets with girls not just because of their looks but personality. I love the way my current girl friend looks but I love her because of who she is. I am sure I am not the only guy like this. The only problem is sometimes these guys aren't the guys who approach the most attractive women because they always appear to be with lots of guys who are all actually just trying to do like you said. But just give it time|`|LVlS4y7Caa	Relationships grow slowly...and believe me, it's not about "looks" - it is, about an everlasting commitment of love, mutual respect and both having common ground.  To be a woman of substance takes doing, giving to others, educating yourself and getting educated, exploring YOUR interests, whatever they may be - and when a bad date happens?  Don't let it happen TWICE.  Be selective, don't go for the handsome stud anymore than a guy should go for the beautiful blonde and only that...like I said, its about developing self-worth and substance and giving someone SOMETHING MORE, than something to look at...you'll figure that out with time and life experience, I hope!    Sincerely,    Grace|`|EAYv4SCXaa	Of course you will find that guy that likes you for being you. You have to take things slowly. If they don't listen and try not to know about you , then they are not the guy you want. Just know there are guys out there looking for what you want as well. Good Luck!|`|OdovbvSYaa	i know what you mean, i had this exact conversation years ago with a girl at college. we were both popular but fed up cos nobody took us seriously. its ok if you like the attention but if you dont its really annoying how shallow people are. the best thing you can do imo is find someone who doesnt show much interest in you, theres usually someone like that who likes you but doesnt say anything cos they think (wrongly) youre an attention seeker so they stay away from you. then spend time getting to know them casually as friends.
AA11096620	I've said this before, and I'll keep preaching it...for me it's all about the personality, being real, down to earth, just be yourself.  I know there has to be physical attraction as well, but if a girl is really beautiful but has a tude or personality issues then it makes her less attractive in my book....just be who you are and respect us for who we are and things will click for you.|`|OdovbvSYaa	guys arent looking for anything in a girl, theres no such thing as "guys"   everybody is different and wants different things.     personally i wouldnt want someone who had loads of friends, i think friends can get in the way of things. theres not alot of point having a girlfriend if shes never there cos shes always talking to other people.
uNplLsZqaa	I like cute and nice guys :) Im a pretty big suck up to smart and funny guys too. Believe it or not, I dont like guys with alot of muscle.|`|2esGKO2Caa	M & M|`|bcab7e2824c9dc2b7643bdff851f90baaa	Kind, caring, loving, sexy, attractive, sensitive, not overly aggressive, smart, and humorous.|`|lruNgvFyaa	Kind, Loving, caring, likes them for there personality, not for there body,..   Friendly, nice,....|`|aT9HYagEaa	We like sweet guys who really care and listen to us...and if your funny your in...make us smile...thats the key!
W2pU2g9Eaa	Okay a lot of guys ask this. For each girl it is different, for me no the size is not AS important as the way you use it. Think about it if you had a big d*** but didn't know what to do with it, or sucked using it, how would that help me. Don't get me wrong size is important to, as long as I can feel it you are good. Which means above 5 inches!!|`|kLslWQR8aa	For me it is the way you wiggle it lol|`|HSYGbCGNaa	B I G|`|6febee8b4757d9cd4857176f7b29c818aa	Usually BIG.

Keep your head up.|`|bcab7e2824c9dc2b7643bdff851f90baaa	i hate when people do this.    shouldnt you want a boyfriend because you want to find someone you enjoy being with and have feelings for?  you shouldnt want a boyfriend because other girls have them and you feel left out.

Your probably just shy and less confident.. judging by your question your probably insecure too. don't worry we all go through that stage.      Edit: AWW that sucks that someone here goes to the same school as you!! lol.. that's why i never post questions like this and everything you never know who's going to be looking at it lol! how embarrassing!|`|OHqRZ9Tzaa	i agree with the person that said the first two pics are ugly the third one you look cute.|`|eSDNSq4zaa	ohhhhhh s'hit. she goes to ur school!|`|NREqhragaa	i know im going against the "guys only" rule...  but average...|`|DK7kY36Zaa	work on your smile...it's kinda cheesy (ima girl)  But other then that, your okay...  6/10 but on the confidence scale your a big fat 0
AA10025847	There's nothing wrong with that.     I mean, I have a feeling that what's doubting you is that you'll be graduating high school in a couple of months and that she has a couple more years to enjoy her high school career.    As long as you're happy, and you're not hurting anyone, it's okay. :]    There'll be a ton of times when you might like someone much younger or older.    But if you have strong feelings for her, it wouldn't hurt to try. You know?    Goodluck, hunn.|`|dJkNofnoaa	nope not at all  my brothers the same with his girlfriend|`|evMd2CuIaa	No...
hxG4zLX5aa	he's just not that into you.  don't fall prey to him.|`|onAEy5jTaa	Older guys tend to manipulate younger girls' hearts! I think you really like him, but he wants to get in your pants (if he already hasn't). I think you should let him be and find yourself another guy. Don't waste your days waiting on a guy that couldn't care less about you. Move on! He doesn't care. Hope I helped!|`|MHwn4Tlzaa	you said it - he's a player.  run away from him as fast as you can and find a nice guy.  they are worth it.|`|KukyXRjpaa	hang out with me, ill make you feel all better.|`|yMyJ9Y6Aaa	If you are going to date a player, don't be surprised if he is playing you.  I suggest finding someone who is really into you and want to be with you.  But that is jus my opinion.
BO4ND6x5aa	ok I'm 16 and I hang out with guys that are 18+ year old and I know how they act with younger girls(bad thing) and no your not stupid or anything you just have an illusion of what you think is love but trust me it's not and seeing that he wont answer your texts back hes probably over you.. hope im not being to harsh but its the truth... if hes found someone else hes hell probably try to go back or act to go back with you or wanting to go back with you but at the end he only wants 1 thing and I'm prety sure u know what that is...     Best of luck to u and hope everything ends up for the better take care|`|MrSQC5Kxaa	Don't text him anymore until he texts you back. The reason he is not texting back may be that he wants to see how much you want his attention.
EDXh0tk9aa	Just follow his lead.|`|NREqhragaa	umm well it just happens... u dont have to think about.. if u do then you'll get nervous.. and its relly easy to tell if ur nervous... so dont worry about it (:|`|WNRcUHjfaa	Just do what ever makes you comfortable.

Just ask your friends about it. Tell them you don't know what to do. It might seem a little weird but they'll give you great advice.

It sounds like you are living in the past and with a memory.  Yes it does sound hopeless.|`|ObfEroZMaa	Move on.    You guys split once. Chances are it will happen again.|`|lhtzKleUaa	Move on... bigger and better fish in da world. life is short so enjoy it.
fZjBVUE2aa	no you're not in love..  you're just jealous.    being in love is something way different.    When you know you love someone more then life it self it hits you like a speeding car with no brakes, all you want is to make them happy spend every minute with them and to show them how much you care.|`|7Mzopie7aa	if you have to ask if your in love then your not.

Just get a job as a pool boy for some rich house wife and you are set my friend.
eO4y3m1maa	They are the adults you have to respect that, but how are they going wild? If they are drinking or doing things like that in front of you. You should tell them not to do that in front of you unless you can join in because it is confusing you and sending mixed signals.
uOVepBl8aa	Hey :(    I'm so sorry to hear that this is happening to you and that it bothers you so much hon *hug*    I dont think you should break up with him. I think you just need to talk to him about it, not confronting him or anything because he'll lie to you then.    Instead, ask him if he's really confortable staying with you, and if he really like asian women. Let him know that you wont be upset at him, but you just want him to tell you the truth, because you want him to be happy and if you aren't what he wants then he should go and find someone he truly wants.     This may hurt you sooo much, and you may constantly compare yourself to asian women from now on, but sometimes when guys like other girls, over time the desire gets stronger and they end up cheating or not loving you as much, or comparing you two. I'm so sorry but i'm just speaking from experience.    BUT HEY! Maybe he actually does feel completely comfortable with you and doesnt want anyone else but you! Maybe he was just shy to say that he loves you so thats why he looked away.    But, whatever it is, I still think you shoudl talk to him about it before you do anything rash, like breaking up with him. Ask him to try to be completely honest and that you wont get mad at him for telling you the truth, even if it hurts alot, let him know that if he lies just to try avoid hurting your feelings it'll only hurt more.    Good luck though! I feel for you. No matter what happens just keep in mind that it may just be his personal taste and it doesnt make you any less beautiful! (I think Hispanics are some of the most beautiful people, wish I could look like one! haha) :)|`|3927497f0169ee5dd95646d151f98f7eaa	no one is gonna love u if u dont love urself. i also have learned that a womans intuition is something to trust...|`|UtrgRjTeaa	Well, there are a couple of reasons that this could happen. The worst-case scenario is that he's cheating on you or flirting with these women online or whatever. But a more likely scenario, in my opinion, is that he's worried about offending you -- so when you question whether he's attracted to asian women, he panicks and thinks "oh god she's going to be mad if I say yes" -- so he says he only loves you instead of answering the question. Just because he likes asian women doesn't mean he DOESN'T like you! So the only issue, I think, is the women on his friend list. If they're just flirting with him and he's not responding, then, well, good for him -- he's being loyal to you. If he's flirting back, well, you might want to talk to him about the fact that that bothers you.    Either way, please TALK TO HIM before you decide to break up or something. Communication is important and you'd hate to end the relationship because of a simple mistake, right?|`|YWdNTZU3aa	your going to dump him because of some ching chong girls   stop being insecure and if your boyfriend dumps you later on down the road  forget him get a new man who doesn't have a fried rice fetish|`|LYpVRoEfaa	i say stop being paranoid    take ur mind off it    and guys are guys    even if they are in a perfect relationship    they still do stupid fings    not dat am one of em >.|`|m8A8rj2Qaa	ask him straight out..if he doesn't give you a straight answer than you have yours. you need someone who knows what they want and someone you can be confident loves you. you should definately find out before you waste too much time with this guy if he's not completely into it.|`|8ae38a2ac6a77dd4a25ba0e15d91e256aa	that is indeed a common fetish among men. if he is giving women (of any ethnicity) personal contact information (phone number, address, ETC) over the internet, you should be concerned. (or if he is sending frequent, interpersonal responses, or spends endless amounts of time on the computer). aside from those cases, he is probably just enjoying some meaningless attention from other women that he has no intentions of meeting or being with. i think that being overly sensitive and reactive to this could push him away from you.
VmKzEwceaa	i think he likes you! because it sounds like from what you said that he wanted to make a move but you shot him down when you didn't hang in the summer!!|`|VcIg1R1zaa	OMG he likes your appearance if he only says you're hot!but it's not unlikely to like you.he is maybe shy|`|VVJyaQdCaa	he deff. likes you if he told you all of these things as well as his friends. its a big deal for a guy to tell his friends something like that ! =)
eO4y3m1maa	Who cares about race! Screw what your parents think.....if hes welcome in the house he should be welcome for you to date....
YATv97Paaa	Nope! ...not at all. Im 19 and my BF is 22 (hell be 23 in February) At first I didnt want to be with him cause I was 16 and he was 19 (And like you I thought it would be weird and he was already in college and I was in high school) but things really worked out for the best in our case    But that really depends on your age...because if youre 13 or 14 the guy is 16 or 17 (maybe you dont have many things in common) But if youre older I think its fine besides it all depends on maturity not age|`|8bq6S19Oaa	I think it depends on how old you are... Like if your 15 and he's 18 then that probably wouldn't be such a good idea. Whereas, if you guys were both adults then I wouldn't have a problem with it. I think the main thing though is maturity level... If you both feel that you are mature enough to handle the relationship then I'd say go for it (within reason though!) ... It would've helped if you'd mentioned your age.|`|unlQZyfNaa	it depends..   how old are you? how old is he? if your like a freshman and he's a junior i think that's alright|`|KpaX2jzlaa	I don't think it is. I guess it just depends on how old you are. If you are 15 or older it wouldn't really matter. Hope it all works out!|`|gfYVdDkOaa	As long as you are comfortable with it, then I think it is fine. It all depends on your and his ages and maturity levels. I don't think 3 years is too big of a difference, unless your in like 7th grade and hes in like 10th, that would be kinda weird. If you can maintain a safe relationship and stick to your morals(like sex wise and other influences) than it should be okay. If you do end up dating him, don't EVER let him pressure you into doing anything you don't want to.  Good luck. :)
utQC6dhjaa	most of the time the hottest guys are the biggest jerks.|`|soUND2xEaa	1 word for you "shallow"|`|YWdNTZU3aa	you want a Super HOT nice Funny guy that is model hot  wow  that doesn't exist  not counting me of course :)|`|0Nfr3leOaa	Hun it not all about looks ya need a nice lad that will treat you good and respect you   and wont to be with you for you not your looks|`|keEfXfg8aa	your really full of yourself and a supper hot nice funny guy doesn't really go for your shallow kind.|`|VDKVy4A3aa	Just wait till u get to your next school ;)|`|eydwwJjDaa	I hope you're not serious.

Your obviously not that pretty if you can't find a hot guy! and normally guys not go out with someone because they think the girl is hot...although it's a big part of it. I think you should see a therapist or something because ur like really shallow, no one i know would just come right out and say your very pretty..god do i HATE girls like you! let me guess your one of those ditsy blonde's who wear WAY to much make-up....!|`|mvAgLB9laa	Get off your ego trip and don't reach for the sky. There are a lot of average/decent looking guys that would make a great boyfriend. Looks are NOT everything.
AA11510511	Don't be so rediculous. If this guy wanted to break up with his girlfriend, then he would have done it of his own accord.|`|eiJOdPgxaa	No you don't! Stop being a selfish *****.|`|73cdc2be7e02ca85fab096386ef11657aa	The answer depends entireley on whether YOU want to be with him or not....|`|I4uIOp1maa	i know were ur comin from cos i like a guy whos with a girl and i want them to break up..  but its not fair on them.   if i were u i would leave them alone  sorry|`|rpJu5XfUaa	I think you need to tell us what your reasons are first.|`|RA7WIdNIaa	You do not need to know that, you need to grow up.|`|Rch68tXlaa	That's not cool don't break them up...
rpJu5XfUaa	You could say, depends what you would do to me or i would do whatever i wanted. Just say whatever you would actually do, then if he wanted you to do something then you would know you could actually do it. Good luck x|`|AA10997370	id try 'wot wud u like me 2do 2u?'|`|6OxnhIwJaa	Say "lots of things, what would you do to me?"|`|2tCbCvzXaa	if you dont know what to say then you dont need to be having that conversation.|`|uXeGsxSVaa	It's a secret, but you would be very happy when  I am done with you|`|9ncFHzftaa	How about, "I'll give you a BJ."
bUig1Fmlaa	Suck it up and go.  The only reason not to go is because you feel uncomfortable.  Just go.  You will alienate everyone and make a big statement about how you feel about your mother-in-law if you don't go.  Not going is setting a bad example for your children and could cause a lot of hurt feelings.    I think you can handle having one boring day.    Good luck.
qSyYrx2raa	absolutely it matters. i prefer to date a guy that's religious and who knows god for himself. i think it's better. im a religious person, i date a guy who believes in god, but he doesn't understand the bible. i always tell him to come 2 church with me and he never wants to go. that's a turn off to me because when we get married the bishop, pastor or priest is reading words from the bible, and we agree to it.  good luck!!|`|FROfw46Yaa	Absolutely not. In fact, I consider that a flaw in guys. Then again, that's because I don't believe in God. My best friend is a conservative Christian, so she would only date a guy who was very religious.    I think it's mostly about finding someone whose beliefs you at least respect, even if you don't agree with them.|`|QNSmbmJvaa	ughh i don't like religious people because they talk about god and like no one ******* caresss lol. no offense but it's the truth.|`|ZOcoyJD3aa	nah|`|smyhq0Ggaa	No, it would put me off that someone is so deluded that they don't accept facts.|`|CEqYjcBeaa	I stay away from those that are strongly religious. I dont care if someone I'm seeing is religious, but the minute you start preaching to me or trying to drag me along to your church I will be out that door. Everyone is entitled to there own beliefs, just dont try and push them upon others.|`|flnYvE4vaa	Most people;these days who are christian are wonderful people. I would date one in a heart beat(: cause we would get along well.

Wf5ZUD3Uaa	Ok this is how it is girl some guys are really shy the trick to make him make the first move is to flirt. Give him compliments on how strong he looks that will make him feel like a stud. Show him you are ready to kiss by giving him hugs and keep touching his hand. Now the hanging out the week end is the best time you gotta ask if he wants to come over and watch a movie and make it something he likes. after that he will start asking you if he had a good time. now don't call to often that will drive him away call once a night if he wants to talk he has your number girl. you just gotta make him want you. i hope this help. :)|`|AA11523246	don't spend 2 much time together because then he is going to feel like he doesn't have a life of his own...make sure you dont make him the center of your life either. keep your friends and make sure he keeps his.|`|FFugH6qraa	its noot hard it wiill come to you!|`|5FVyVS9vaa	The only way he is going to know how you feel is for you to tell him. Try going to the movies and then go for a walk with him. Hang out with him at least 3 days and then do something together on the week-ends. Get to know him and he will get to know you. Go bowling. Ask him what he would like to do. If one of you don't make the first move, then nothing is ever going to happen.|`|utQC6dhjaa	try making the first move yourself. its fun.|`|cxVmq2kraa	If YOU can't decide this yourself, its not working.|`|7ko9czaaaa	give it time, it will mean more to you.|`|y9wE6Qm5aa	First, you should be friends with this guy so if you want to talk it will be more easier. So after just go easy then when the right time comes get close and kiss him make sure he wants to ;)|`|7wixocuDaa	make him feel that you love him but not in an obsessive way.. tell him how much you love him .. you don't need to make pies for him.. just make him feel by telling him you love him once in a while.. when you're not busy.. or if he crossed your mind.. just play safe.. if you don't want to be a bf-centered gal.. just respect your limits... just don't look like you are the one who is so desperate to be with him.. just live life with normally.. with him loving you and you loving him..|`|Gx14PIvxaa	Do simple things like hold his hand or brush against him. If you're standing somewhere, stand close to him sometimes. Make a lot of eye contact.|`|zeFhn56Zaa	you need to make the first move with him let him no your comfortable with it|`|ZE6XtxgZaa	don't be clingy... spend time with him doing things that he likes and become his best friend pretty much. plus whats the rush, once he feels right about it he'll make the moves|`|IPW2of1waa	jeez..same problem happens to me sometime.    just make the first move i am always honest so just be honest.    be the first one to kiss him....later he will do all the moves...    good luck1|`|hjDB62VGaa	Hmmm...Strange!    You are willing to express your desperation and needs to "millions of real people".  but not to someone you care about.    Don't be coy. You will never get what you want with that attitude.    Be assertive. Go after what you want. That is the way the world works, away from Mom and Dad.|`|NUR1waitaa	just go with the flow  don't think relationships are like romantic movies .there not real.  so just be your self  remember he likes you for been you so don't change  if you feel to phone /text him do it don't play games like his got to to text me first  basically be your self coz that's what caught his eye
UtrgRjTeaa	Go up to her: YES.  Introduce yourself: YES.  Kiss her hand: NO!  Ask her out: NO!    But... ask to hang out: YES!  Get to know her better: YES!    Don't be a creep, just be confident.|`|A7ovwP94aa	I would not go and kiss her hand but you could introduce yourself and go to lunch with her.|`|SSq8VfF8aa	Ask her out, but don't kiss her hand quite yet.|`|6o0oq2D9aa	whoa bud,i no ur shy, but i dont think that doing that will make it ok, because she might freak out or somthing, so get to know her see if you really do like her. and if ur charming, she'll like u back!|`|KXYqCgWxaa	yeah y not just don't kiss her hand that's kind of weird   leave that till later if she likes you and if she does it ca  be more then the hand (know wat i mean)
Gx14PIvxaa	GIRLFRIEND! That is one hell of a predicament. Actually it's not. lol    If you don't want to have the baby, don't.    I would just have it, especially if you know damn well that he is financially able to take care of it. Maybe that is shallow, but it's the honest truth. So many men nowadays are deadbeats ( and women too, I know ). If you want the baby and think that you are prepared to be a mother, go for it.    Whether or not to be with him - I'd say no. Internet sex is so yucky and is really the bottom of the barrel. If he's doing that in just two years, imagine when you're busy with the kids and he isn't getting as much attention as he'd like... he'll look elsewhere again.|`|BSKJdZK3aa	if he really loved you he would have not done that    when i feel in love i feel disgusted when thinking about other girls|`|AA11635143	In another question you said that yours is a "long distance" relationship?  I think you're having an affair with a married man whether you know it or not.    He has shown that he is willing to cheat; once a cheater, always a cheater.  Do you want to waste your time on a man you can't trust?  Only you can decide.  After you've made your decision, go back online just as you did in the sting, make plans to meet him and then ask if he is interested in really getting to know you. If he says that he is, go and meet him and tell him that you are the date he set up online.  For your safety, DON'T go into the motel room but walk away without another word and go home.    A few words to ponder:  Are you sure you know how much money he has or how much money he makes?  Playboys are big liars.  If he has as much money as you think he has, be very careful, because bad things have happened to pregnant women.  Some men won't hand over a fistful of dollars just because someone demands it.  In this case, he may be willing to support the child but you need to let an attorney handle the details just to make sure.  Good luck.|`|4cd6c2676e153ff5f86ecd5293cdd12caa	Well, he has the right to know about the baby. See what his reaction to the news is. If it's positive, great. If you want to be sure he won't cheat... apparently he has the potential, maybe you have a friend he hasn't met... hopefully she'll do you a favor and trap him...if that's what you want. $10,000 a month may sound like a lot but babies are expensive, and you'll have to go through custody battles, visitation... decide if finding out is worth it... GOOD LUCK!!|`|bmoCpcdraa	well play your card right he could prove you unfit take the baby and sue you for childsupport yes men with money can do that he can aford to keep this child and live with someone elese to raise it do you think your the only fish in the sea like you said hes got lots of money|`|qpAYU8Knaa	Stay with him. Your baby needs a father.|`|d9K5Utgdaa	u need to leave him and get with somebody who will love u and ur baby|`|i01egybJaa	Um... what have you gotten yourself into? You should've just trusted him in the first place!!|`|o6xLWwZvaa	You sound like you are using him.     You start off saying you been dating this extremely wealthy man. To me, that only means you are with him for his money. Especially when you put...should I just collect the 10k/month child support.     Why did you even do the "cheating sting" to begin with? Do you not trust him at all? If that is the case why did you stay with him...oh wait...his money.     Have you ever thought, that maybe this guy knew it was you on the other end..pretending to be someone else. He just let you play the game. Yet, maybe he has been seeing other people without you knowing it. Tells you let not see other people, is a way saying..I want you all to myself, but I can still play on the side.     From the sound of it, you don't love him. You are using him for the money and he is probably using you for the sex. Call it even.     Lack of communication between you and him. You don't want him to know until you decide what you want to do. If you been in a relationship with this guy for 2yrs. Don't you think he deserves to know that you are preg...even if he is or isn't cheating on you.|`|AdTnizwOaa	Wow, I think your man wants a break from you and maybe you should talk to him. I wouldn't know but that's what my sister and her husband did once by accident but they made up. I mean you are pregnant, if he starts lying to you and saying that he never did anything like that then just tell him it was you, and leave him, and take the baby with you.|`|xfk2xMWEaa	kill him and take all the money. BAM! your baby is happy, and your not with a cheating %%%%%% all your life, so your baby isnt like him|`|d42c34ff42d7b1a4c999f30da1751f64aa	Look at it this way - Not everyone who solicits him online for sex, is going to be you. He accepted your invitation, he'll accept others, but they wont all cancel at the last minute. You can stay with him if you want, if you know that the chances of him cheating on you are about 100%, since he's already attempted to.       How do you know he hasn't already? If he accepted a hook up invitation that quickly, he's probably done it before. First time cheaters dont usually just jump into it like that.    Another thing, I wouldnt confront him about it until you've got more evidence. Obviously he was going to cheat but there's one thing I've learned. Cheaters are also liars. It comes with the territory. If you confront him now, of course he's going to lie. He'll either say that he knew it was you the whole time, or that he was just messing around and had no real intentions on ever meeting that person. And  chances are, he'll get mad at you for 'accusing him' of trying to cheat.|`|2c3rcQRbaa	Since you already calculated the child support you would be getting I say you have your mind made up.   And that from the beginning you were in it for the money.|`|G0pDFMSPaa	Well, let's see you pulled him along to see if he would stray and he did, now you want to get rid of him.  If I was him, I'd be pretty upset with you as well.  If you love him, drop it.  Marry him and be a good wife.    PS - Just because you got him all hooked up doesn't mean he'll do it every chance he gets.  Maybe you can help spice things up a bit!|`|2216244481d213debef4605befb5d3a2aa	The most important thing to say to you right now is, if you didn't trust this guy enough to not pose as a stranger and test him then you need to get out now.  Pregnant or not you can't trust him and what kind of environment is that to raise a child??  $10,000 a month??? Good luck with that.|`|l8ql67Itaa	well this is really hard but if you really love him just give him another chance... i think everyone deserves a second chance....u guys should talk about this......he should have a reason why he did that.|`|P3GgROxtaa	man ur brave. i was thinking about makeing up a fake person and messaging my boyfriend too and see what he says. but i was too scared to see what he would say so i didnt do that haha. but if i was u, i would tell him that it was one of ur friends who was talkin to him for u to find out what he would say about u. and tell him that she told u what he said. then he wont know what to say i bet|`|AA11171465	WoW....  I don't know.  Tell him you are PG first of all.  Can't really say you busted him cheating.  He will say you are trying to trap him, and for what.  Money and child support.   Remember he has A LOT of money (as you say he does) and can probably afford a vary good lawyer.  You on the other hand, probably don't have that much money.  Can you afford a good lawyer.  The court will rule in favor of the one who has the most money.  If they don't he will just keep appalling it over and over until you just can't take it anymore.|`|FFrUZAoraa	hahahahahahahahahahahaha|`|ZIZb8p48aa	Use your Mouth|`|ZOcoyJD3aa	if he cheated on you once what makes you think he won't again so    get the 10,000 a month|`|H0HPx0kwaa	Confront him about the possible cheating. Admit that trying to bait him was wrong but you want to work it out. If he is sorry and doesn't attempt to cheat again, then maybe he's worth keeping around and having kids with. But if he turns out to be scum, don't have the baby.  It's not just about child support, it's about a baby having two loving happy parents.|`|M5tXXJR9aa	Ohh, that sucks. I am sorry. You should talk to him about it and don't tell him you are pregnant until you are done talking to him. Then decide. I think you shouldn't stay with him if he was going to go have sex with "someone else". He might actually do it some day if you both do have a family together.|`|ZdeJCdCbaa	I would leave him. Alot of moms are single and do just fine. There are alot of support groups for single moms too. You dont want your baby having a father like that. hell grow up not knowing the right way to treat a woman.|`|5tGGFy3Taa	If i was you i would keep the baby its not the baby's falt that he has done this so keep the baby get the money     And he should give you money for food for the baby    I hope you ahve a happy life with the baby     Hope everything goes ok xx    Love   Beth  xx|`|f2XdVMD1aa	If you set up the sting that means you suspected he was cheating and you were right. Break it off, tell him your pregnant, and enjoy the money.|`|sQRq44IPaa	Well first question is do you love him enough to make it work? Because if you do love him I'd say work it out and see what happens. Because a baby can change things, some for the worst and some for the best. But if you don't love him then just focus on yourself and the baby. The main thing here is don't let the baby suffer from this. He/She needs loving parents/parent no matter what. And just don't use the baby to get money cause that would be very disturbing. Just go with what you feel is right for you and the baby's happiness. Good Luck and I wish you the best.
whHCYOthaa	The best way to get over someone is to get "under" someone ;)    Time heals!|`|VVJyaQdCaa	burn all of ur pics of you and him together!|`|XJqFqAnsaa	get a new boyfriend|`|BYdXXt4Oaa	Maybe you cant let go...I know the feeling...when i broke up with my ex (i met another guy) 6 months ago...i still feel some remorse and i dont want to let go of my past yet. maybe you just need more time to get over him.
J30kfJpQaa	If a guy is married he should stay. If he isn't, he shouldn't prolong it unless he feels it's something temporary.|`|c5UAa65qaa	Depends.  Does he know what's making him unhappy?  Does it seem like something that could be fixed if he talked to her about it?  Or is it something they've already tried that hasn't worked, or a general dissatisfaction?|`|1uvrkDWNaa	No one should remain in a relationship if they are unhappy.  It only gets worse.|`|M7gf7Xoiaa	I'd say try to make it work for a bit because everyone has moods but if it's ongoing.... break it off. don't string her along. And NEVER EVER EVER cheat! Break up before you cheat!|`|3RDOPzGeaa	guys usually just break up with the girl when the feelings are done with. They don't believe in "making things work"|`|ccVRsWyraa	if a guys feelings have changed he should definitely he should break up with the girl. its not fair to him to be in a relationship that hes not happy in and its unfair to  the girl since she probably thinks everything is going good. she let her down easy.
ikacAw7Naa	It wasn't you or the question you asked.  Your relationship was just not meant to be.  Stop blaming yourself and move on.  There are other fish in the sea.
3KDj8v6Paa	So... Your boyfriend wants you to eat ****?  No, seriously, have you seen this movie?  Two girls..**** in a cup...and eat it...  Then puke in it...and eat some more...  Seriously, in ****, there is a bacteria called e-coli.  E-coli infection can cause food poisoning, meningitis, urinary tract infections, and even pneumonia.  Do not do this for him.  IT IS NOT SAFE.|`|RmZZ1MKraa	yaaa thats realllly gross.|`|0M5XYROfaa	That is extremely disturbing.    Id say break up with your boyfriend and tell him to find some girls who are as disgusting as the ones on the movie.  Your boyfriend must have some serious problems hun...  EWWWWW|`|LViLdW6haa	HAVE YOU SEEN 2 GIRLS 1 CUP?!!!!!    You would be insane to try that, your boyfriend is a sick ******* freak and needs mental help. That is nasty not only mentally but its not healthy!     You could get all kinds of sick from eating ****! wow thats just nasty.    You need to tell him to eat **** instead and see how he likes it.    Crap come out of your body and isnt supposed to go back in that could cause serious health problems.    wow i dont even know what to say, this is a truly ammazing question|`|8utYdcmOaa	It depends on why you are offended... is it because you would never think of trying something like that or is it because he asked you to try it...    If it is the second one then try it there is nothing wrong with trying something especially if it is to please the one that you love. You will never really know if you're really offended or turned on unless you put your self into that situation.    I can say that because i have never seen the movie so you might want to check the movie out first and see if you can see your self even doing whatever he is suggesting that you do.|`|Rch68tXlaa	I'm going to start by say 2 girls one cup is very disturbing.It was gross.If your uneasy about it then tell him no.Don't do something you don't want to just to make someone else happy.    I can't take seeing another version of that nasty video on the net.
pW9KhTFvaa	Maybe he is chronically depressed.  It's a sad life that you seem to live.  It does seem that you two at least have some type of sex life which is good.  The TV and Internet are both addictive.  You should have a talk and get him to admit that there is a problem.  Agree to a certain number of hours per day for the computer and TV and the rest of the time has to be spent in some other manner (you and/or he will find a way to spend it).  If this does not work, then tell him that he has to get a job and get the **** out of the house and be an asset to the family instead of being just an ***.|`|JyvG8dFcaa	sounds like you married a lazy man...|`|ycNxVrUfaa	Your husband has shown you what type of daddy he is. If he's willing to let his child sit in wet/dirty diapers so his game doesn't get interrupted he's not stay-at-home material. Don't trust him. You're right, he sounds like an addict. Your babies deserve better and you know it or you wouldn't have asked this question.  Good luck.|`|iZbgUtxcaa	Honey you know the guy is a LOSER.    How about not getting pregnant all the time?  You are just as irresponsible as him to bring children into the home of a lazy man such as your husband.    Just write "WELCOME" on your forehead.|`|d940608abceb30d461a4c37f72c312e4aa	I wouldn't believe him either.  I think maybe counseling is in order.  The military probably offers it.  Actually I'm sure it does.  He really doesn't understand what it takes to raise a child.  I don't want to bash on him too bad....it would be easy, but you two definatly need to talk this out.  He needs to become more active in the children's lives.  And he needs to get off his ***.|`|5NKa5Y8laa	Fast forward a year or 2.  You coming home tired from a long day's work, to find your husband in front of the computer and your hungry and dirty kids running rampant through the house, and you having to clean up and cook dinner and take care of the kids.  If this is what you think will happen, then dont agree to it.    Tell him to be a man, get off his butt and participate in his family's life.  Dont agree to him being the stay-at-home parent until he can prove he has got what it takes to make it work.|`|xXhkRq0Caa	You can only go by his history and the history is telling you that he is not going to change diapers or interact with the children. While he is in the service you should seek out other stay at home moms and start communicating with them. You all can meet with children and have adult conversations. As far as your husband working, I think you two need to talk and air what is bothering you. Don't blame or accuse him of anything, just say what you want to happen. He should work full time and maybe you can work part time. Who knows you might can trade babysitting with one of the mothers. Have an agenda in place before you seriously start talking with your husband. Just remember you both need to compromise, but make sure you are comfortable with the compromises you make. Good luck|`|IxzJ6SN5aa	Tell him playing computer games is fine if he pulls his weight. Set a time limit though. And only after the kdis are in bed and he's worked and done his chores. Tell him you are cocnerned he may be forming a bad habit.    In general, 6 hours is too much gaming for a man with other responsibilites.     By no means leave your kids with a person who will not care for them.    Games should be the reward he gets for doing everything else, not for just sitting around.    The other thing you can do is give him a list of chores. Perhaps he needs more direction. Once he done the list, he can reward himself.    What I do with myself to be more disciplined is set aside time limits for things and rules for myself.    1 hr exercise a day  10 minutes cleaning my quarters   Clean dishes after oneself.  Fold all laundry even if it isn't yours.  IF the dog makes an accident clean it up immeadiatly.  Person who cooks does not do dishes.    These are sort of no-brainer things, but work fro me.  etc.|`|NrwJyffxaa	Your getting some really stupid answers from other people.  This question his home with me because I am addicted to computer games.  I will play 40+ hours on most weeks if I'm not careful.  It isn't something that most gamers what to admit.  I have been known to play a game (Counter strike or COD4) until my eyes dry out because I get into them so much and forget to blink.  YA it hurts like hell in the morning and they are blood shot and sore.      Anyway I'm a father of 3 and have a full time job that I work from 8-5.  It is a struggle for me every day when I get home not to go sit in front of the CPU.   I have set rules for myself that I can't play until all my kids are asleep and that when ever my wife asks for a movie night I have to take it (I haven't told her or I'd watch movies every night). I guess my point in telling you this is that it can be controlled.     To confirm your fears if you go to work and let him stay at home your kids will be neglected. Same if you left them at home with a drunk and his beer.  At least mine would be.  I know that makes me look weak but that is why I don't stay home.  Unless something really happens in his life he will stay addicted.    Most men at best are only half as good as women in the home. An addicted one would be much worse.    If you wish to e-mail me I will talk more.|`|G024yAU3aa	Trust your instincts and put your children first.  He will nto take initiative if he is alone and I beleive that your thoughts on this issue are right on the money.|`|rcut6bhoaa	Seek come counseling together.  If that doesn't work,  move on.|`|FBhjhjR0aa	I don't think you are wrong at all. It sounds like your husband is so lazy, that he wants to stay at home with the kids, so he can do as little as possible. In all honesty, since he is so lazy I think it's safe to say that you could tell him sure! be a stay at home dad and raise the kids, I will go to work. I promise you after one full week of him having to take care of the kids and the house, he will be ready to go back to work. I don't think he realizes how much time goes into taking care of kids, and what all the responsibilities are. Once he gets a good taste of it, he won't want it any more.|`|bUig1Fmlaa	Tell him if he wants to be a stay-at-home Dad, he has to prove to you that he can do it.  Meanwhile, get your kids on waiting lists for proper daycares.  You can always cancel their spot, but you should cover all your bases in case he turns out to be just lying.  Honestly, it doesn't sound good.  You may have to leave and work and pay for daycare and hope that he will give you some child support.  He sounds like a terrible husband and father.    Good luck.|`|SiniSj1eaa	why not just divorce him and take the child support? how much different would that be from what you have now...???|`|aS8TjALBaa	You don't believe him because he does not share in these responsibilities now so you have no reason to think that he would start.  Raising a family and keeping your home maintained is a joint obligation for both spouses no matter who is working outside the home.  I would try talking to him again - a serious heart to heart is needed and he hopefully he will show you by his actions that he is sincere in his goal to take care of the children and the home and for you to go to work.  Hope you can work this out.
ryjnt3dhaa	I think he is moving way too fast talking about love on the third date.  That is just silly.|`|jj2tSASnaa	sounds like he thinks he is clever.  I think he is full of crap and playing you.  good luck from a real player|`|50xeC77aaa	It means that he loves you and wants you to love him so you can make sweet sweet love.  duh|`|wEEniEcFaa	Hmmmm...it sounds half way romantic, half way cocky.    Do you like this guy?  Stick with dating him - but DON'T give him any thing more than you are prepared to give.  I mean - don't sleep with him (he controls you then), don't tell him you love him first, don't do anything first.    If he said it because he is falling for you - then he'll do everything he can to keep you with him - then you can follow his lead and let the relationship grow.  If he was just being a cocky piece of crap - then you will be moving slow enough that you can discern between his loving advances and his lustful ones.  (BUt geez, I hope it's true that he's falling for you...cause that's so romantic!)|`|sNSnXzqfaa	My advice to you is to not fall in love any time soon. This guy is definatly a creeper|`|ymFZCQnTaa	What a tool dump him into the tool shed. Horoscopes are bullshet it doesn't even matter.|`|NNcdVfoiaa	Sounds like he's a douche bag.
53aUYsqtaa	the ohter plenty of fishes in the sea. you cant force her to love you. get over her. When a guy sees a woman then thats usually the point of his attraction. So before the woman has even had chance of anything happening she already has someone who has fallen for her. For women its different, and this is usually where a lot of men go wrong.    Women are different to men in the way they become attracted to them. Once a guy is attracted he will usually go over the her and try his hardest to make them like him. When they have a approached their prospective date this is the point where they will turn the woman off. A woman doesnt want to be approached by someone whos trying their hardest to impress her. Women are far more attracted to someone when they dont know if they fancy them. They get turned on by the does he? or doesnt he? factor.    Then the single guy will start buying her drinks. Hes buying her drinks while shes waiting for someone to come along who shes attracted too. Buying a woman drinks will not win her affection. This will have the opposite effect. Now she will just take it as buying her affection, and the guys other qualities will look weaker.    After some conversation, and a few drinks she may give away her phone number. Shes given it out of either politeness or because shes had too much to drink. Now the guy will think hes going to start dating her, or knows hes not but is going to try his hardest to make her like him.    After a couple of phone calls, and not getting anywhere because shes always too busy the guy will probably buy her a gift. This is how he thinks he will win her affection. All the challenge and attraction is completely gone from this friendship. If she does eventually go out with the guy whos showering her with phone calls and gifts it will just be as friends.    As much as a guy can try he will never win the affection of a woman who isnt attracted to him. Attraction is instant, and if it wasnt there at the first meeting it wont suddenly appear.    Women like the kind of guy who doesnt try too hard. This arouses their interest, and creates a challenge that gets them thinking. This is when they want to find out if the guy is attracted to them. They dont want someone who looks desperate to approach them, and start kissing their butt at every opportunity. Women are attracted to the not-knowing, and the way a guy will act cool as if he doesnt really care.|`|Elc1bFWyaa	First, you need an education. Your spelling and writing skills are horrible. I think she does not want to be with you because she thinks you are too dumb. Maybe if you learned how to put a coherent sentence together she would reconsider. Nobody likes a dumb guy or girl.|`|B3VYy8sFaa	She said "no"... what else do you need?!     It doesn't matter how smart, great, awesome, funny, hot etc.. you are, if she's not interested, she's not interested.    Find someone new|`|mF0L5jMNaa	In a few years you will have a new "past".  Make it a good one. Do your best to impress and not be annoying to her.   Women/girls want a guy that has much to offer.  Educated, easy to talk to, a good job, clean, and polite.|`|ZzEAc5ecaa	as you wont take no .. then send her some flowers and see .good luck ..
3d6bc93187edd6634c43ac022cad74b1aa	No way. That just show how mature she is to have ACTUALLY stayed in those relationships, especially since a young age of 15. It's better to have her than someone who has NEVER been in a long term, because you know that she's not just with you to fool around. Unless you are only looking for a fling, don't lose this girl, you don't find girls like that these days.|`|pKzH1cFHaa	She is just not one who wants to be alone. It's not bad.|`|AA10214276	No, it's much better than being in a bunch of super-short relationships since she was 15.|`|fxxLgQrdaa	might be|`|e28P8gWraa	No its not bad, she just has issues with being alone. She probably has low self esteem, but so do most girls. Its not a big deal.|`|kpW7Jyb2aa	Could mean that she doesn't get attached in these relationships and so doesn't need down time to get over someone.    Or it could mean that she has a problem with being single.|`|2tCbCvzXaa	Its eh, most girls are like this. They jump from one relationship to another. I was with my husband for all of highschool when we broke up for two years during my senior yr. I was with another guy right after we broke up, like two weeks later im not even kidding and we were together for about a yr and a half. I think i have been single for a good 6 mths of my life and that was right before i got married.|`|qWL2aUxGaa	I think it is, not to be mean or anything she could just be one of those types who plays around.|`|da330e0e035c143b531f239aba874120aa	no its not|`|eydwwJjDaa	She doesn't like to be alone.   Could or could not be bad.   You'll just have to find out.
8bq6S19Oaa	Maybe he was just teasing? Maybe he likes you and was testing to see your reaction when he "rejected" you... i.e. If you were annoyed that he didn't want your number that means that you wanted him to have it right...? He must have noticed this, and then smiled because he was flattered that you didn't want to be rejected by him. This sounds really confusing but I hope you understand what I mean lol... Basically, I think he likes you and was just playing with you... Don't take it personally, next time you see him just do something cheeky to get him back.|`|f2XdVMD1aa	maybe he likes you and was being silly. Maybe he doesn't want your number and smiled so you wouldn't be offended.|`|2BatkpPtaa	he prob likes you! and he didnt want u to know it
AEZ75dJ7aa	I think as an adult you should really think about why your family gave you this ultimatum.  Are you willing to lose your family over a man?  especially one in prison who will tell anyone anything to get what he wants?  Did you know this man before he did whatever he did to get put behind bars?  Or has he "found Jesus" and is "looking to change his life"  While a lot of men do get the wake up call from prison is he really one of them?  Why can't you just be friends and you continue to date other men and see what happens over the few years after he gets out.  If this is the man God created for you, he will still be in the years to come!!!!|`|0JgenGPtaa	that's hard to choose!     your family should give the guy a chance first to see whether they like him or not. i would understand why they don't like him since he has a record of bad history    it's up to you. family is forever and giving them up is like giving away a part of you. but a love of your Life is a one time thing, it would be hard for me to choose too. but so you know, boyfriend comes and go.    u need to be sure that he really loves you, you dont want to get hurt.    it would totally sucks if you chose Him over your family and then it turn out that he's not the one for you, you would have lost both important things in your life!    my advice is Listen to your heart, what does your heart tell you, just be yourself. things should turn out fine. Good luck:)|`|6rl0tQnBaa	family gos first....!!!!!!!! and u cold faind some one batter......
W2pU2g9Eaa	Well for me I have a very open personality I guess. It is really hard to irritate me. The only things that can ruin my feelings for someone is a liar, theif, or cheater. Oh and just users for sex. I hate that!|`|01pY6dW9aa	I personally go for a guy of what he really wants in the future.. like whats his goals, and doesnt think about just the ideal of dating.  someone who thinks more than that.. like a potential mate.  i wouldnt like it if a guy just goes for my superficial traits.. it has to be more than that too. Same with if im likin a guy, it has to be more than that.

Dont be a normal gal and talk about your feelings, we dont want to know. Just continue doing what your doing and dont kill it by saying "what are we" the guy might just understand the situation unless he brings it up. Good luck. I am free this weekend ; )|`|52092e43afb48f25c3b2832d7f29ae10aa	Yeah.. just don't get one of those wimpy "but I LOVE you" guys....    They piss me right off....lol|`|eQURLO8Eaa	i think it always helps to tell him how you're feeling. because then he'll know where you're coming from. just make sure that you nor him get feelings for each other if you become friends with benefits. but, most guys i know are into that sort of thing.  hope i helped!|`|Bof6bKYvaa	Well it may be ok but i hope that you dont get too attached to this guy because him knowing that you are only 'friends with benefits', may be akward if you change your mind in the future. In other words, make sure that you are both clear on what you want....
29ddeea7f871392bf7b17a12fc77a694aa	lean over and kiss him|`|utQC6dhjaa	just be hey your one of my good guy friends do you think i pretty?  this way your not really asking if how he feels but you can find out if he's attracted and he ask whats with the question just say i figured you would be honest.|`|BzyIf78Kaa	ask him.
5jMNBO2naa	how does one take one for granted?  answer that first and you got your question answered..    why?    because to be taken for granted is to say you do things in expectation of something back... and that's selfish... you got to want to do things, not because you expect something in return    the thing is many women figure if they go all out on a guy he return the favor  he won't  it's not that guys are selfish  it's that they think and operate in a different way  men do things for someone when they feel like it, not when nudged or prompted to do so..    women who go all out on a guy tend to over compensate for the fact that they have insecurities, and thus the treatment is mask to hide them and make them seem better in a false light    at first a guy thinks, dam i got a good women, but then he realize there other shoe will drop and then waits to see what he really got to deal with    women unlike men, are not born with honest and open and frank communication, so they cannot simple go out and say i have the following issues and am working on them.. so they compensate..    later it comes back in a fight and the guy figures where did this comes from    keep in mind guys never ask for special treatment, women just assume that it's necessary, its' not, though  nice, guys prefer good communication, which lead to good action, rather than slight of hand actions|`|IocgFjr2aa	Someone's naive.|`|WOHUFkJEaa	People take others for granted if they are not in an equal give and take relationship.  Make sure it's equal and give as much as you get.|`|KROEJQhuaa	Yes. I always do it. If you give them everything then they think they can walk all over you (unless you find a good one) so step up and take your ground. You can spoil them but if they get mouthy with you or take you for granted tell them where you stand. Like you would a child.|`|HWnhBCXiaa	There's nothing wrong with sacrificing things for your partner. So long as its an equal relationship and your partner does the same for you. There's nothing nicer than seeing two people who relish making the other happy and content.     But it's important to be in an equal relationship - and some people need to be reminded that they could be doing more.|`|vqdNEtYPaa	Why do you treat him good?  Is it to show him that you care, that you love him?  If it is, then it doesn't matter how he views what you do for him.  It isn't about him as much as it is about how it makes you feel having done nice things.      Just because you treat someone well, and do things for them, or to them does not mean that you can or even should expect them to reciprocate.  Each of us is different and each of us thinks things through differently and each of us feels differently about things done for us.  You can not successfully relate your feelings to someone else.  That is projecting.|`|AA10197672	I ask the same question from myself. and i think yes they will get very spoiled and will take you for granted. So sometimes you have to pull back and let him treat you good. 2 way street, it cant be ther other way around. Some guys dont have a clue as to how to treat a woman right, so sometimes you will have to talk to him and let him know the things you like, or would like him to do. As they say, 'we are not mind readers, so just say whatever you want us to do". Yeah, they think differently...|`|f6YsGOynaa	Anyone will take you for granted if you let them.  It's important to establish boundaries and stick with them.  Do not let him violate those boundaries, and treat him like a king in his castle.|`|qsLhVZd8aa	A real man will never take you for granted, no matter how well you treat him.  A boy, on the other hand, will definitely take you for granted.|`|mzYsk112aa	A person will do what he can get away with.  You need to have self respect and boundaries.  Don't just let him do what he wants to the point of ruining your happiness.  If you're okay with what he takes from you, then no problem.  If you were, though, you wouldn't be asking strangers about it.|`|cGGvZqJNaa	Hey, I like this chat thing...

6IZ30X8iaa	You're a victim of the sexist Old South "half + 7" rule.  You know, according to this if the guy is 30, the girl should be half his age (15) plus 7 more years, or 22.  And if he's 40, she should be 27.  And if he's 50, she should be 32.    But it's 2009 and that's a load of crap!  Three years' difference in age is nothing!  Make your own decisions.  You two love each other, so go for it.    Your family will come around - especially if you two eventually marry and have kids.|`|P3GgROxtaa	ummm who cares what they like?  all that matters is what YOU like.  just do what you want to make ureself happy.  you can date whoever you want, ure 21 (so am i)  and my boyfriend is also 18. i have never dated  older guys though. i just always seem to fall for  the younger ones. but theres nothing wrong with  that if its only a few years. and ure both legal so  go for it
RQD7Z0eXaa	Stay the way you are.  If a girl doesn't like your style, there are probably a million other girls who will.  Make the girls come to you, don't change yourself for them.|`|UgcPxd4maa	idk - but you're hot|`|BZeTJHXhaa	well, i'm a more simple-laid-back kind of girl, so i usually don't feel comfortable around guys with really high-priced clothes, because i feel SOOO out of place, like a poor person around a rich person or something. However, if their personality is good and everything, i'm okay with it.    and as for your look-- i can't really tell what you're wearing but you seem *ahem* approachable and everything, so I guess just do whatever you do.|`|fBXRNKyuaa	No way guys who dress up look like they are gay|`|m7putYGmaa	it depends on the girl, i personally love my boyfriend when he's in regular old ratty jeans and a t-shirt    some materialistic girls want they're guys to look all polished and fancy...    your pic doesn't make you look intimidating, but then again, i cant see your clothes    maybe smile more, you look kind of serious =D|`|hCJzZ5rnaa	It depends on the girl I suppose, more sophisticated girls will prefer someone who makes an effort. The cheap girls will be intimidated and feel lower (which they probably are).    Don't worry about it.  Sometimes I go casual, sometimes I wear all the brands, but I always have a Ralph Lauren scarf on haha.    I like to look sophisticated, I'm in a relationship with a sophisticated girl, and I like to appeal to sophisticated girls.    I am quite sure you want to as well.|`|H0HPx0kwaa	If a guy walks around with all those designer labels, I'd bet he is gay.

Just be yourself and be patient, sooner or later the right person will come along.|`|Lj751YtAaa	I think when guys where designer clothing a lot of people think they might be gay. Its good to be different and unique though and I am sure there is somebody out there who loves you for who you are. I like short hair so I'm not the one to ask about your hair, but be who you want to be don't let others dictate what you should do.|`|asZTDIkIaa	I think you look good! I like guys who know how to dress and looks good, but I think you should have a more relaxed and casual hairstyle. Also i think alot of it is an open attitude. If you act friendly, then people will approach you!|`|55pSqrDcaa	wear stuff like converses and shirts that have bands and stuff on them...just wear stuff that would look good with converses...it makes it seem like you have a good taste in music|`|OJJWNuDdaa	dont dress up!! just look normal. average close.  I'm a girl and i peronally would go for the average clothed guy WAY before a guy who tries to dress up just to impress mee. you may not think so but its way obvious.  i alwawys looks for a guy who can be himself and still impress mee. thats just my advise though!  -good luck!
an1EMiFkaa	Yep for sure|`|YuVSDBkzaa	This is something I've actually thought about. My father was unfaithful but I would have NEVER thought my mother would cheat. As it turned out, my mother did have an affair and it nearly killed my dad (despite what he had done).|`|Dx6dsQx1aa	No, in my experience there are fewer than I think.  You come across these guys that are kind of cocky and full of themselves, or women that seem to like to play chase, and they seem like the type that would cheat.  But they just have low self-esteem and they don't.  That's not to say they're totally happy in their marriages, they probably aren't, but it's up to them to get some help to figure it out.  Thankfully most people know well enough to not go down the infidelity road.  The destruction that comes from it, whether your spouse finds out or not, is usually beyond repair.|`|498JdszFaa	No I'm not shocked at all. And yes I think there are.|`|2vaGZ4eDaa	When they collect data on unfaithful spouses, sometimes they don't realize that a lot of people will lie out of fear of having the information passed along or of being judged by the researcher.  Good statistics are hard to come by.  I think it's been quoted that half of all marriages have infedility in them, but the statistic is probably quite a bit higher than that.|`|ooT1Gj2Xaa	I suspect that infidelity happens at one point or another is most marriages.|`|4805686fe56c40b3d116e63ef0f5fd16aa	No|`|AVePRVWKaa	after finding out about my husband sneaking around behind my back, yes I think it is true that married people are unfaithful to their spouses...more than once in my case|`|dcb024b5e2b5c65f694bdddd3199db68aa	That would be all the women and most of the men.  Out of experience they is always a few men with a strong set of morals.|`|bnFcjEptaa	You can go on line to find out the stats.  Think it is higher than most people think.|`|Zg8aORFYaa	No. I think cheating is the norm.|`|3iNobwVraa	I'd be shocked--and not--at the same time.
TpG33NoWaa	Laying down hard and fast rules about the severity of extra-marital romance or flirting is, quite simply, silly.   You ask people who don't know you if kissing was 'that bad'!  How on earth are we to answer?    It depends completely on what was in your mind when you did it.  Surely that is quite obvious.     I believe that many married women supplement the family income by acting as prostitutes.  In general, these women, in an effort to make this activity seem to be 'quite apart' from what happens within their marriage, refuse to kiss their clients.  To these women, then, it appears that 'kissing' is the ultimate intimacy!     Does this make kissing 'more serious' than what your wife did?   Of course not!  (Unless your wife is one of these women)    Your lips touching someone else's lips is not what you are really asking about, surely?|`|tCiVuFK9aa	I think it is more about what was in your mind and heart at the time.  If your intention was to get intimate with this woman even if it didn't include the actual act of sex then yes it was cheating.  If it was a friendly kiss then no.  And if it was a kiss to get back at your wife then yes that was even wrong.  Maybe it would do you and your wife some good to go to counseling so that you both can learn what the boundaries are in a good marriage.  Red|`|CuGAYMlbaa	first nancy if your wife is a pig why are you with her or should we call you snowball be a MAN and leave her find a good woman and keep her in line this time|`|7w9AM9Tnaa	kissing isn't as bad as having sex, but still it's cheating.  if you don't want your wife cheating on you, than why would you go back and do the same to her, even though kissing isn't as bad as sex, it's still cheating.|`|m93CHWaCaa	Oh stop! There's no excuse for either one of you!|`|beiztH7iaa	It wasn't ideal, but it is certainly not in the same league as what your wife did.  While I agree that there is intimacy in kissing (to varying degrees, depending, of course, on the nature of the kiss), it is something that can happen spontaneously.  Having sex, however, required some degree of planning to enable that  to happen. I think your wife's infidelity was far worse, not just because of the enhanced intimacy of the physical act, but because of the forethought that must have gone into orchestrating an opportunity for it to happen.  Don't allow your wife to try and compare the two and call them equivalent acts of infidelity. She'd so love to believe that because it absolves her of some measure of her own guilt.|`|d1cpADBZaa	kissing is cheating, but two wrongs doesnt make it right...|`|AVePRVWKaa	Kissing is just as bad. No you didnt go as far as she did, but there is no reason why you should try to "get back" at her because it is only going to hurt you BOTH in the end.
bU4sCl0Baa	Well, it appears that you have ripped your ex's heart out of his beating chest, and now your asking if it's ok to drive your heal through it. Being your cold and heartless enough not to have an answer for this already I'll try to help...  If you truly want your ex out of your life, then get out of his.|`|llgBLR6daa	take a break-especially if your ex is still into you. take it slow and at least give it a month before you go out with his best friend|`|emLigoQQaa	yeah go ahead.... but it makes me think badly of the new guy- he would date his best friend's ex, who he is obviously not over! imagine if that happened to you! they're gonna end up losing their frienship cuz of this I bet. If he were over you then it would be perfectly fine.|`|4UqL6SY0aa	if your in high school its fine bc theres honestly not that many guys to choose from and so you cant help it. he cant blame you    please answer my questions, thanks|`|1tmNzoGvaa	Go for it if you want to....you really should not consider your ex's feelings unless you still plan on being close friends with him...but if you dont care then go for it...I am dating my ex's roommate/friend so we see her a lot when we are together and it creates awkward moments...mostly for my ex lol...but yeah just go for it if that's what you want|`|b9LclO15aa	No no no no no. When i was 17 i pretty much did the same thing, however i was the best friend. My former best friend still holds it against me and i'm now 21! I don't know if are serious about this guy but consider holding off doing anything until you know your ex has moved on or until he has a new girlfriend. Its not worth it and you don't want to mess up their friendship!

P3GgROxtaa	ew|`|AA12383369	I think you should tell him, but only if you're willing to deal with the potential consequences. Remember: it's pretty hard for people to come to terms with losing a boyfriend or girlfriend because they're gay/lesbian.    Still, if you think you can handle it, I would suggest that you take care of this issue as soon as possible.|`|zF1jfT3Kaa	OK like you really need to tell him cause if the shoe was on the other foot than you wouldn't like it like trust me im gay and i waited so long to tell my boyfriend and not only did i loose him but i also lost his friendship like idk just be up front about ya **** don't hold nothing back cause it will hurt you in the end

I would probably laugh and think you were trying to make a joke.     But it's sweet in it's own way. She may be the type of girl who would think it's sweet and disregard the fact it's corny. Evidently, every girl is different.    Anyway, I think the best thing you can do is do simple, thoughtful gestures instead of lines.

I am the same way.    Nothing wrong with it.|`|KukyXRjpaa	dont worry dude, i am very picky. im not like most other guys who just sit,stare, and druel all over every girl they see. I only like certain girls. and particularly good,smart,clean ones. not those fake barbie, superficial girls.    you are  normal, that is a quality many ppl would wish they could have. use it to your advantage  by scoping out only a select few types of girls you like. itll be better in the end!|`|fsHgUrcAaa	You're a little young to feel this way already but it's normal.  As a woman, I'm only attracted to about 95% of the men I see...but that could be because I'm 30 and I've experienced a lot.    I do suggest you being more open-minded.  The real attraction you should feel towards a potential girlfriend should happen AFTER you get to know her.|`|lKRHvwgJaa	im not COMPLETELY sure but you might already know someone that you really like, but you just dont know it yet, just wait and the girl that makes you say "ooooh" you'll know shes the right one. just because your not attracted to all girls doesnt make it weird, it just means your not a pig. haha, im sure some girl will make you very happy some day..good luck
OBVtGhVSaa	Well, it really depends on what the 2 guys views on the matter are....|`|FD8I4zthaa	Why not. Dating isn't about marriage. It's having fun. So long as your datees know that, it's OK.|`|4HoVVCenaa	Yes, that is why it is called dating.|`|LykjWv6faa	No. You either choose one or the other. You can't have both and it's not fair.|`|Mfy5gd77aa	i say if you have commitments to neither then hell yea.|`|kJ4g1vujaa	As long as either they know about it, or they don't.|`|Ibj8FjfRaa	No it's not okay.|`|Hzzdalavaa	If it makes you happy.|`|W7qmkVFxaa	yeh- why not?|`|5c2tW6d4aa	Ah come on now, no one likes a two-timer|`|2QiLmXfhaa	no.|`|1f5996779efb6a4589f7767428fbc708aa	Bit greedy.|`|GJksrOfzaa	No it is not. It is a cruel thing to do because they trust you, and they respect you and they believe they are important to you, when they are obviously not. Now, if you only date one guy, that is fine, but dating more than one can result in arguments and many hurt feelings as well as distaste and distrust. if i were you, I'd provide compassion to only one person. Hope i helped!|`|dc5bTUtmaa	I don't see why not, you are dating not married|`|claUGpVRaa	Definitely not! That's dreadful|`|wMyKPOw8aa	obviously not...|`|dlmVTt18aa	If it's just casual dating then yea but it it's like boyfriend and girlfriend then it's not ok.|`|2HcRc4zkaa	Nah!

oKoABzNtaa	If you think all guys are messed up, just remember that you're the only constant in your dating history.

Good luck girlie!!!!!|`|thmlwAZDaa	not all guys are messed up, just some boys like your boyfriend, you really should get out of that relationship  gud luck:]|`|1keH3R6paa	Cause they're douche bags that look for a good time, not a good person.|`|yQJhZTDPaa	all teenage guys r like that hun|`|tDSS7ygfaa	not all guys are like that. also the male brain only focuses on one thing at a time, while females usually have a million thoughts running through their mind. so when guys are playing games they are completely focued on that. i would talk to him, or make sure you only hang out with him when you know you will have his full attention|`|SFVewDuiaa	What games...Like x-box n stuff like that? or sports on tv?.....Thats something you need to bring up with him...If he don't listen leave em alone and let him and his games have fun 2gether lol...he'll b bac...|`|S0f1au1kaa	not all guys are addicted to video games(i'm just assuming you meant video games). try talking t him or play the game with him. you two could like make a deal that every time you win you do something you want to do and every time he wins he does something he wants to do. who knows maybe it could be fun.     hope this helps!
jep9LpUpaa	Does he act rather shy around you? If he does, than he might actually like you. I suggest to be cute around him, but try not to be too flirty. But, I think it's best to flirt once to see what happens.     good luck!|`|WI1JEQh4aa	then forget about him move on bc its not going to happen  so ur just wasting ur time

3zGxlguhaa	Be frank with your parents. Tell them that you love them alot, and you wouldn't do anything to hurt them. If for some reason, they still don't believe you and look at you funny, screw them. Hey, you tried.|`|60b0d42c3c92dec6d976704c90ee8eb5aa	Just tell them clearly you did not do it, and if they cannot trust you you will also lose your faith in them as loving trusting  parents.|`|Rj3epU5yaa	if they don't trust your word on the matter there is no way to convince them, what you could ask them is what things in the past that you have done would convince them that you're lieing now.  just because you're alone with your boyfriend to make out or whatever doesn't mean you're boneing.|`|qesIBFcHaa	i think you just say straight out. "My boyfriend and I never had sex damn it! and i am still a virgin."     i have the opposite haha, my parents think i still am. haha - dont give up on your relationship unless you dont like the guy.    your young and its not the end of the world, dont beat yourself up over it. if your parents dont believe you, then they are just being dumb. let  it go then.|`|AA10858784	Your parents sound very unreasonable.  I would ask you to ask them to bring you to a doctor to check it out or something, but then again I don't even know anything about that so moving on...    You really gotto set a serious tone to it. Get them to listen by the hall and look at them in the eye and tell them honestly that you didn't have sex, and that all this false accusation is deeply hurting you.  If that doesn't work, then you just gotto continue living your life.    It's okay as long as you fought for the truth. As long as you're honest with yourself it'll be okay.   In life you cannot please everyone, but its always painful if those whom you cannot please are your parents.    I wish you all the best, and hope that they will believe you.|`|WLRun4SWaa	ofcause do your best to convince them, tell it all exactly as it went down, and tell them that you wouldnt plan on having sex just yet, and if any boy would try anything you would defend yourself.  i dont know if there is any way to prove it... well exept a doctors examination, but id be dammed if your parrents wouldnt believe u after they ahev calmed down a bit.  as to your boyfriends parrents, talk to them but mainly let your boyfriend do the talking... seems like u have enough to deal with with your parrents...  if they are rly rly strickt try taking it step by stem... getting phone back, and so on 1 thing at a time, so they dont think you are packing up and leaving home just yet...|`|SdQIQGcAaa	Gestapo parents|`|aavNyOeyaa	Instead of them putting you in a noose, think of yourself in their shoes. Your daughter has just spend an amount of time alone with her boyfriend, you don't know exactly what they did but suspect that they have had sex. Just try and set up a meeting with your parents as well as his parents, get them talking and explain how much your virginity means too you and that you'd never had sex, and if that doesn't work. blackmail.|`|T4zxS0hIaa	wait till your married... and don't worry about what they think... just wait !!!!   don't break up with him just cause your parents think you had sex... if you didn't have sex, then don't worry about it just take all there punishment with a grain of salt... just never forget how they treated you because they were assuming!!!!!! parents can be so untrustful. you only have 4 more years!!!|`|ESWeS3Qkaa	uh you could striaghten them out or tell your boyfriend to wait for you when your like 18 or 20 so that you could have freedom|`|xmYYC1hqaa	you're sixteen, ofcourse your parents don't trust you. in all likely hood your parents don't trust you because they're afraid you'll do something that they regret doing themselves at your age. obviously your parents have some unresolved issues. so in order to get them to trust i'd point out that you ARE NOT THEM and that they themselves taught you to know better. or that by not trusting you is making you not trust them. i'm not guaranteeing this will work but it will probably help make them listen to you.
eO4y3m1maa	stop being silly!!! He likes you!    Go out with him!|`|jbTNER3caa	From what you've said, it seems like it.  I mean don't like jump in head first, take it slow.  But yeah, it sounds like he might have a thing for you.  Congrats!
8ef9b9edc05bf967345c8da354892000aa	Normal people don't talk to members of the opposite sex who are "just friends" that late at night.  Before flying off the handle, make sure it isn't a family member or something like that.  Another thing to do is get the phone and call the number (from his phone).  If somebody answers "hey baby!" you know what's going on.|`|UgcPxd4maa	he could be - but you'll never know unless you actually catch him in the act. But your pregnant and hormonal, so its natural to think things like that.|`|07YBD5mJaa	i wouldn't worry so much, specially if your pregnant. maybe he was planning something for you, a birthday party, a baby shower? or maybe it was just a friend...just because your dating him doesn't mean he cant have other friends...although it's hard at times to accept. i would talked to him more about it, see how he reacts to the situation...but don't stress out too much about it. if you really feel something is wrong, maybe write the girls number down and call it when he isn't home, see who she is. best wishes!|`|tcPaHzkUaa	Omg you freaking moron.  Just like you have boys numbers in your phone.Jesus Christ.  No he isn't.|`|7Q7dFghmaa	You obviously dont trust him anyway if you are going through his phone in the first place...|`|0HYG8PlNaa	How long have you two been together? It doesn't sound to incriminating. Most of the time we think they are when they aren't. But trust your gut instinct if you think he is just wait around and gather clues don't bust him with every little thing, Just yet. Play private investigator. Good Luck|`|M11nx95paa	u shouldn't be snoopin into his phone it aint ryt...now u got urself worried and it could be for no reason...it may just actulley just be a friend of his...i get and make 1hr calls to guys i aint datin, there are plenty of reason for it...so dont blow this out of proportion...trust is the basis of any relationship, u bein all suscious n snoopy aint gonna help ur relationship its gonna drive him away...no reason to be so insecure...|`|bnm9BfxDaa	sorry dun't know|`|7vLCsfovaa	No.  It looks like your guy just has a girl that likes him, but it's too bad that he's taken.  Good luck with the baby :]|`|uLkRYj4saa	Alright well obviously if u give him the benefit of doubt by thinking hes cheatin on u then u aint in love u ****** selfish ***** its probably a friend from school if u really loved him u would believe him so and you probably aint really pregnant its just all them little betty things you been eatin|`|e5f4c192231c92a0d059825b151f7553aa	He might be telling the truth.    Do you have reason to believe he is cheating ? Or just worried?    Some men do actually talk to females on a friendly basis, without wanting to get in their pants all the time. Incredible, i know - but yes, it does happen.    If she calls more often - then you might need to worry.   But just a one time call - for now, no big deal.|`|tIldpr7vaa	still in school, tattooed name of GF on his arm, and got a girl pregnant, this guy sounds like he really  has his life together|`|fE3EDHa4aa	1 - checking his phone is a violation of privacy...he will think you have no trust in him..HUGE turn off   2 - Guys have friends of the opposite sex, i'm sure you do too.  there's a great chance shes just a friend have a little faith in him, if he's had a past of cheaing THEN something might be up, but if he's remained innocent i'm sure its just a friend.|`|UEA4Uli9aa	Keep checking his phone and if he's still talking to her, talk to him and tell him your not comfortable with it.   I he doesn't respect that then make a lovely windchime out of his balls :)|`|Q8CS0x0Kaa	My boyfriend of 20 months is constantly is texting and calling girls at 12 at night and will talk to them for hours. And it honestly pisses me off because he tells me their "just friends" and I don't know what to do about that either. My advice would be, to just keep checking his phone to see if they talk anymore, and how much more their talking.|`|NArS7hYEaa	I have no clue WTF? HAAAA|`|fe5a4af928ae62bdbc687f2290889024aa	hmmmm, why not ask him|`|Qgauqwa5aa	he could be cheating but it could be a friend from school the tat dont really mean anything it can easily be covered or took off just get more details and look more into it|`|wUdisPJZaa	You are so trusting, snooping through his phone with no reason other than you feel like it. and, paranoid much? LMFAO|`|eQPy6KP2aa	It could be nothing but I would not be okay with my guy giving his number out to girls.|`|ZlgRne3caa	I talk to my guy friends for extended periods of time.  I'm sure that he's not cheating on you if he loved you enough to put you onto his arm forever. You're also having his baby.     Unless he's given a reason for you to not trust him, you're going to just have to take his word for it. However- be careful and watch for other for sure signs of a cheater.    Best of luck with this and with being a mom!|`|dBensSCmaa	its very possible. but u never know, so if u really love someone you will trust them|`|KSo2RjK9aa	thats what always messes up a relationship, DOUBT.  if you are doubtful, you will mess up ur relationship...just go with the flow unless you ACTUALLY see him do something.|`|RwRCwJXMaa	If I were you I would have taken the number down and called her woman to woman to find out what is really going on...butttttt some girls are really sneaky and could lie about the whole thing. My best answer is.. go with your gut, that is usually on point.  Make an ultimatum with him tell him that you and your baby will leave him if you even have any doubts that he is cheating, you gotta scare these guys sometimes, and believe me they DO get scared of losing the girl they love.|`|4UqL6SY0aa	its possible, but then its possible that hes telling the truth.  check his phone more and see if they talk again.    please answer my questions, thanks|`|IqoRBVUTaa	He sounds like a player. No offense or anything! I'm just warning you. You should check it out.|`|Wg4oXaICaa	First things first, don't jump to conclusions. Second, if he's staying with you to support a baby, then I don't think that he'd be the type of person to cheat.|`|X2z7mbfaaa	It is possible that he's cheating. Don't close your eyes to the situation recognize the possibility that he is being unfaithful. But I know that I have female friends that I would never cheat on my girlfriend with. But don't be too aggressive. Do you have any reason to distrust your boyfriend? Give him the benefit of the doubt but don't be stupid either. Talk about it and let him know that this situation is bothering you and go from there. Good luck and just remember there are good guys out there, hopefully your boyfriend is one of them.|`|UeFiMMFWaa	Before you make your own assumptions and get these weird ideas in your head, be honest to him. Tell him how you feel. I think think he will understand. I hope he is not cheating on you. Keep in mind, it is not enough evidence he is cheating on you. Come on, just because he was talking to a girl at night!!???? Don't be a jealous person!|`|RFK9sG6zaa	Find some guy who will act like he's 'your' close friend 'you' can call 11:22 each night for at least 30 minutes.  (Make sure this guy understands this is kind of a game to stop your boyfriend).|`|200afe35d45dea8a4192b6e0e30ed767aa	I called my friend Josh past midnight last night. We talked for an hour. Nothing sexual at all.  As you can see, it is possible to talk on the phone with a friend from school with no underlying meaning. However, I do not know your boyfriend and do not know what their conversation was about.    Whether he is or is not cheating is something you should talk with him about. Just explain to him that you feel uncomfortable with him talking to other females at such a late time, he should understand.    Try to keep from sounding accusing, it will naturally put him on defense and an argument will likely take place. Remember to keep a open mind, and to not jump to conclusions.    Good luck!|`|zHtV6UO4aa	Hhmmm..  Hard, I'd get to know the girl... Is she his type?|`|4LcvSHDVaa	I would probably confront him about it.  That's the only way you will find out...|`|JLOgHmCnaa	Don't get worked up babes, I'm pretty sure he's not.|`|xx4MSADIaa	no you are in love - he's just agreeing with you.  Oh and he will dump you for being jelous and interferring with his privacy.

Maybe he needed help with schoolwork or something.|`|KukyXRjpaa	CHEATING, TRUST ME    ANY GUYS WHO TALKS TO GIRLS AT 11 AT NIGHT AND SAY ITS JUST A FRIEND. I MEAN COME ON! DONT BE NAIVE! HE IS CHEATING.    YOU, YOUR RELATIONSHIP, AND YOUR BABY ARE DOOOOMED!|`|dkVAH0OKaa	your pregnant?  hate to say this... but your probably screwed (no pun intended)|`|OKrjKF5Yaa	just beacause he talks to another girl doesnt mean he is cheating you should trust him unless you have like eveidence|`|kfyxmtHoaa	Your just paranoid. Dont worry about it. I have friends that are girls aswell that I talk to. He may be calling to ask for a girls opinion on a gift he may be getting you etc. If he has a tattoe of you on his arm that show real commitment, plus a baby with you. No worries.|`|b4utBwY9aa	Have you ever thought that she really is just a friend? Do you have guy friends?     Maybe she's a friend that he can vent all his frustrations to, or maybe she's a friend who gives him advice on how to be better to you and your child.    You never know.|`|3D4WiM4naa	It is probably a friend. People in a relationship always seem to over react  when there Girl/Boy friend talks to the opposite sex.    Dont worry. He isn't cheating. I have a lot of friends that are girls, and i talk to them a lot, and i also have a girlfriend who talk to alot of friends who are boys. But i know there just friends.|`|XVfpMFsSaa	u should play sims 2 .. its all about cheating and getting pregnant...or is that fable 2?.. eh my suggestion is to phone the girl and tell her what  a complete  *!&^$%%& she is in  a calm way|`|pjBt8tFLaa	relaxed don't choke him with questions but just watch out for hickeys and late night going out and stuff like that don't say anything to him if he is cheating you'll know and don't stress and if he is you'll know when you have sex with him that's how everybody knows|`|d8pCt4V1aa	hell yeah he could still be cheating, now that your preggs he could feel more strapped in and want a release|`|OBdbHMDqaa	ur in school and ur pregnant. sounds like u are only 16. i wouldnt get all hyped up about it yet. maybe if you find some more evidence. but dont go snooping thru his stuff to do that.
1273526522e7c1b16fde04aeedec32ecaa	lol love the name by the way, but you can try closing ur eyes and thinking of ur special person. look at the type of porn u like...or find a friend that u jus wanna use for sex. thats wat works for me lol|`|i7rYRvlTaa	look at some porno|`|175ydQo5aa	Maybe you should spend your time out in the world looking for a lady, maybe goto the gym, and that would solve your problem.     Think of the time you wasting jacking around when you can get yourself a lady and be productive...|`|UbXp2K26aa	Well first, stop going as the name "Queef master" then that might solve your problem. Second, maybe you're gay?|`|UYIanZIpaa	I recommend the use of Evangeline Lily. You can try printing it out onto a sheet of paper and then you're all set.|`|8vfCRg7Caa	quit jacking off and get a woman. Jesus man, in this day and age you can almost find anybody. And theres somebody out there for everybody. And damn quit touching yourself so much. its nice to do that once in a while but maybe you need to see a doctor, or two. One should be a therapist. Get up, change your clothes, change your pick up lines, become a comedian (women like comedians) and be a good dancer if you go out. Have some confidence in yourself, no matter if you work at mcdonalds or you work at a law firm.|`|rnZoebKQaa	sniff your dad's panties|`|1C0Tm9ipaa	Porn|`|ASLbRwQ8aa	wtfs up w/ yur name.

85c7b5c821a7ba39949a3307cf876e59aa	it might be to some emo women. she might be referring to the "manliness" of the self harm.. you know being tough. it also might be that she cuts/has cut herself and can relate to you.    hope that helped =]|`|ZpltzTIfaa	That's insane!  That wouldn't turn me on at all...it would freak me out.|`|MXGFGBtZaa	only one answer...  STOP CUTTING YOURSELF!  IT IS NEVER A TURN ON! NEVER EVER EVER EVER EVER EVER  She is obviously an idiot :)  It's not attractive in the slighest.  Stop doing it.|`|0yuuXDeLaa	I wouldn't say it was a turn on, but it's nice to know I'm not the only one with problems- unless your doing it because your a masochist.|`|tcUADMWFaa	People that do that make me sick.

wscyjkPAaa	No way around it, you just have to buck up and do it.  Imagine if wait longer and they find out from someone else.  How much bigger would the issue be.  If you tell them now, they will only be mad at you for the academic suspension.  If you tell them later, they will be mad at you for the suspension AND for trying to hide it AND for spending all that book money on you while you're suspended.  I say tell them as early as possible because it will only get harder the longer you wait.  On either case they'll be mad at you but I think they will also be proud of you for being responsible enough to admit your mistake.  Your parents love you and they're there to help when things get "sticky".|`|cGbTJobeaa	If it is too hard to tell your parents on the phone, then write them an e-mail and pour your heart about everything and how you are feeling.    It will be a great emotional release for you to tell them.  Once they have the information, they will be in the best position to help you. They'll be less angry at you now than if you deceived them for the entire semester...and next.    Just bite the bullet and get over it. Write that e-mail to your parents now.|`|ToYmTw8gaa	well why r u on suspension?? thats an important part of it..|`|AA11098866	JUST DO IT!  They are your parents and love you!  You will work it out :-)|`|RQeNqORpaa	Write them a letter explaining everything.  It's a lot easier to be brutally honest when you don't have to look directly into disappointed eyes....  That's a tough situation.  Good Luck!
42IzT0Viaa	Just take him aside into a semi-private area and say that you aren't as comfortable being affectionate in public as he is.|`|XRD7qfg7aa	tell him you don't like looking and feeling like a prostitute. lol.|`|0M5XYROfaa	Tell him in private that you arent comfortable with it.  If hes worth it and cares about your feelings then he will understand:)|`|Rch68tXlaa	just tell him you don't feel comfortable when he goes over board in public kissing and feeling you up.Tell him he can tone it down because ur feeling disrespected.And see what he say
RehsHaTBaa	well, if she's really hot, then do this:  hug her from the back and massage her boobs, then turn so that ur hands r on her shoulders and ur facing her. crawl your hands down to the end of her shirt and kiss her neck. then crawl your hands back up under her shirt and give her boobs a tickle near the top where her bra isn't covering. slide ur hands to the back and unbckle her bra. remove her bra and her shirt, slide yourself to the back of her, and squeeze her boobs with delight!|`|29ddeea7f871392bf7b17a12fc77a694aa	during a make out session... then its golden....|`|3OT8Lmrgaa	Only do it in private, unless she says it's cool in public.|`|5VYovF57aa	like the first person said, when your making out. just place your hands on her while you're in the moment, like on her shoulders, then casually slide them down.|`|eydwwJjDaa	Wow, really? You're 19 and you don't know how to touch a girl?|`|AuCpRJajaa	start making out get really into it then slowly slide ur hand down from her cheek to her neck to her chest. while making out. it will make it natural.....but j/w if u have jiggled them how have u not grabbed them? but anyways thats my advice|`|K32Kpbjeaa	well first of all youre 19 and you should be able to spell. just grab them theyre right there just reach out and grab em. ;)  wait till you're alone and take her up to your room and rip her shirt off, lay her down on your bed and bite 'em. ;) kinky....girls like that...  hope i helped. =]|`|LNSiLxlBaa	Are you a virgin? You HAVE to be! If she was ok with you jiggling them then I can't see why she'd freak about you grabbing it. Just grab the damn things already! WTF?|`|rgX3fhjlaa	Start making out grab them and then go for more than boobs|`|qAWxOyWdaa	Lol when your making out with her just grab them|`|6TVl5nTBaa	rub them or craddle them like two big water balloons.|`|HjgeyVpiaa	|---  |-----------2 Points--------|||"|""\__  |__________________|||_|___|)  !(@)'(@)""""**!(@)(@)****!(@)    the hell is with this....this is the stupidest thing ive ever seen!!!|`|5FVyVS9vaa	Don't just grab them, that will make her feel cheap. Just kind of slide your hand up her back and then down her chest. She will either let you continue or remove your hand, but don't just grab them.|`|TMi1GhSHaa	yes during a makeout session.|`|G0pDFMSPaa	How did you get to 19 with out learning this basic manuver?  Just start unbuttoning her shirt while you are making out, if she doesn't stop you, undo the bra, and suck on those big fat puppies.|`|7BRJhrABaa	yea bro, while u make out with her grab her boob slowly|`|51a318b835befd29d22ff2a38e8b5353aa	when youre making out, start like moving your hands a lot, like up and down her back, and then subtly, not rushed, moved to the front and then go up her shirt    hope this helps ;]
HYnBeyJsaa	I'm not 20 years old yet but seeing as how I am a frequent myspace user I can honestly say yes guys do tend to flirt with girls a lot online. However, it's nothing to worry about because most of the time it's usually not that serious...they just want to comment on the pic and that's it.|`|8YDQnUZPaa	YES  the tend to do that alot online girls they do that cause they have nothing else to do|`|FUQ0sJNaaa	hey bro hows it goin?|`|cxVmq2kraa	Of Course they do.    The girls are hot in their opinion and they can say sh*t without getting in trouble.    Don't stress about it.|`|rgX3fhjlaa	Most guys will do this because they like what they see
qx0zxmGHaa	Aww thats sweet :)    Okay If you really like this guy, dont let anything hold you back. I know how you feel, I am very shy as well. =]  Is he the kind of guy that goes for the looks or the kind of guy that goes for the girls inside and her personality? You have to find that out first. Then you have to do things that gets his attention. He may be shy as well, like yourself. Guys tend to hide their emotions and anything that gives them off. Crack a joke when he's around, get a answer right in class, or anything that might get his attention. But make sure you dont over due it, if you do then he might think you are full of yourself.  Dress up, look cute, do your hair, put makeup on anything to get his attention. Or just find the confidence in yourself and talk to him. It wount be that hard. I mean you do want to know if he likes you or not right? so if you do this then you wount have to keep on thinking about it.  What the worst that can happen? him saying no???? if he does then he is an A$$H0L3. There are other guys out there for you, not just him. But dont give up, keep on trying =] And if even after that he shows no interest, then you know you are better off without him.    Good Luck  Wish you the best!!   =D  Luv Lucy :)|`|JGOOoiI5aa	its really counts you could ask him and just get it out there especially if you're not that close cuz then nothing will happen unless he's a bad person..or you can ask a friend to talk to him and just ask if he likes any girls int he class make sure your friend isn't obvious but if he says  he wont date you cuz of something you don't change yourself for a guy
kdCqEgpUaa	That was a nice poem! =D

g1CsXtupaa	Most guys/boys are looking for looks/appearance/attractiveness; something that stands out to them.    What guys prefer in general is to have a nice figure/body (that is for MOST teenage guys), and also guys tend to like it better when a girl has her hair down and not tied back, but of course, there are some who dislike it that way, too.    So a lot of guys are different, but a lot care about a nice body, a "cute" face, long or short hair (depending on the person), hair down, looks like she takes care of her self and cares about her appearance, has a nice taste of clothing, and also acts more like a girly girl than a tomboy.    That's all I can say, I believe. Hope this helps.|`|P9oduCUgaa	We like them to be 18 and up...|`|AA10214276	I don't like em that young.|`|byWl2fw0aa	We like them to be 18 and up...

I am sorry but its true.. he used you and took advantage of your nice nature.. forget this as*hole and move on.. you deserve waaaaay better..  Time will heal you and you will find your love who will love you and treat you like a princess.. trust me..    Good luck.. :)|`|MDqbzGfkaa	all boys are immature assholes, you should move on|`|XI9e7OyEaa	Hun I am sorry but he used you. I am sorry to be a downer but he used you.

ra9FbUKmaa	Roll along your tongue gently and slowly, don't be too speedy and fast. Try lightly pressing your teeth against the head, but if he shows some sort of discomfort, that wouldn't be that great of an idea.  Try and get it as deep as you can take it too...    We're talking about dancing, right? Ha jk.|`|KukyXRjpaa	well i like it when my gf, deepthroats me and puts my balls in her mouth at the same time.    basically swallow his weener and his entire ball sack, he will pass out from pleasure lol!|`|hR7fJ9y4aa	Well.. suck really well, and practice on a banana if you have to.

Cv2h6n1Raa	Her new boyfriend is obviously a rebound. Honestly, she sounds a little crazy saying she likes you one minute and being a total ***** the next. She obviously just wants your attention, so ignore her completely. She will be so pissed! You might wanna look for a different girlfriend cause she will be very jealous and you can see how a nice girlfriend is supposed to act. If you don't wanna go that route enjoy being single, you can enjoy life and be care free. If your ex is telling the truth about not liking this other guy then it will make her mad to see you happy and not care, and shes stuck with this other guy for no reason. I know getting over a break up is hard but honestly, time heals all wounds, give it another 2 weeks and you'll feel better. Just whatever you do, no matter how you really feel, do NOT give her the time of day!|`|7VSGyWCPaa	Sorry man but either let her go or give her time. my ex did the same thing, and is going to move in with her new dude. Sucks, i still love her and she still loves me but thats life.
pUoAqU3Vaa	deffinatly. she wants you to make the first move though.|`|7H4fhrEOaa	no, i think she is just sympathizing for you because of your terrible english.
apzX48W4aa	Okay.I was in 3rd grade and I REALLY had to pee!! So I ran to the bathroom and rushed to pull down my pants and do it. So I sat down and started to pee...only a few seconds later did I realize...I didn't pull my underwear down. I had peed straight threw my panties! So I went back to class crying my eyes out and told the teacher...and my mom brought me some dry pants. : ) lol|`|ACA8i43Gaa	This winter at a ski resort I felt a slight urge to pee but decided to go down the hill for a last time before heading for the toilet. Unfortunately it proved to be a very bad decision since the lift got stuck for like 30 minutes and the cold weather made me soon having to pee really really bad. I made it to the top of the hill and successfully down the slope but by this time I had to pee so badly that I didnt make it to the bathroom and totally peed myself. It was pretty embarrassing but my cousin who was with me couldnt stop laughing. Needless to say that ended skiing for the day and I had to go back to the cabin soaked with pee which wasnt very comfortable when its freezing cold outside. I am 20 years old BTW|`|jj2tSASnaa	you really need to find a hobby.|`|Y4Ye3OLOaa	I had really bad you know what and was about ready to explode. The first bathroom was a "pay bathroom" and I had no change, had to run all the way down the street to find one in a fast food place that luckily was free, ran in real fast almost knocking a couple of people over|`|XJW7Yx8faa	Army guy in the field forgot toilet paper, he walked in the middle of the woods to find a good place to relief him self, well he used one of his socks to clean him self up.|`|AU4LAtqMaa	when i was little, i was at my crush's house and i really had 2 pee... the only problem was, i didnt want to ask where the bathroom was and i thought i could hold it.  but i couldnt.  i was outside, and i peed myself.  it was go embarrassing.  i even had to borrow clothes from him and give them back to him at school. we were young so he didnt make a big deal of it but i almost died.|`|5TXZpMtHaa	OMGG!! lmao i done that toooo ^ peed right through them lol.   mine was when i was in my friends house and all her brothers hot friends were in too , i went to the bathroom but since her lock was broke i made her stand outside the door.. as i sat down i let out the huuuuugest fart EVER!!! and it echoed in the toilet.. all her brothers friends heard in the next room! it was mortifying :(|`|wHdxiYgXaa	i was on my way home with my family after eating out one night. and not even 5minutes after leaving the place i got the nasty like cramps, so needless to say, i had to poop. like pronto.  but we werent even close to being home, so i panic and whisper to my sister about it. but she giggles at it. so after like 5 mins or so i spoke up. and we had to stop at the nearby gas station just so i could go.     to this day i cant live it down.|`|3cQJhSqXaa	I was in 5th grade; went into the bathroom, and one of the kids with down syndrome was in the stalls. He started singing to himself, screaming when he let something out, then he sat on the floor outside the stalls and started taking a ****.    /scarred
7Q1dJoFzaa	At my daughter's achievement award ceremony, i should have known i couldn't trust that fart.  She was mad that I missed her getting the award and her speech, but I had to leave the premises immediately!|`|LDLTjNCraa	I was younger, and it was the middle of the night.. and I was half asleep, so I didn't lift the toilet seat lid before i sat down.. and peed as usual. =|  What a mess.  It won't be the best story on here, but I just remembered it x)|`|DOoHDBTiaa	Well i really didn't pee my pants but once i did fall in a public toilet. I know ewwwwwwwwwwwwwww|`|ab2ced77773506517263df45c8304b30aa	when I was in the 4th grade, peed myself I waited too long, but thankfully school was over but i rode the bus but i couldn't get on like that! so i walked home, but when I got there 1 of  my boy cousins was visiting from out of town and I tried to go to my room to change but my dad got mad and said aren't you going to give your cousin a hug! awwwwww I'll never forget that! funny now though haha|`|kQA7SbY9aa	I was at a bus stop waiting to transfer to another bus on my way home from work and i just had to go. To avoid 'springing a leak' on the street, I rushed to a McDonalds about a block away. Every stall had 'something' in and/or on it. It was so nasty. In the end, I just went into one of them and fought back nausea...Used paper towels to hold the door knobs...Hate to admit it, but I left without washing my hands  because I wanted to avoid touching anything in that restroom at all costs. I can laugh about it today, but still makes me cringe.|`|pJ3TNB6uaa	haha, this question made me laugh...    One time I was driving on the highway and had to pee so bad, it hurt to move my foot from gas to brake, luckily I finally found a rest stop about 12 miles away...    As for "bathroom" accidents, I blacked out one time and slipped and cracked my head open, and didn't realize it until someone told me in the morning.|`|fe2879005f528660584d6c591d71e1e9aa	lol i never had dat kind of accident|`|bxJcxxMeaa	i was at a restaurant with my mom and I had to go 2 the bathroom. so i went into the bathroom and went,but when i pulled my pants up they were wet i was like ewwwwwwwww. it was so grossssssss. i totally lost my appetite so i actally smelled it. it was only toilet water but still ewwwwwwwwwwww!!!!!!!!!!!|`|wHdxiYgXaa	i was like 8, and had to do a make up dance class but i was with like 17year olds. so i was more then just intimidated. i was terrfied but i had to pee really badly, and thought that the teacher acting so professional wouldnt allow me to go.    so i tried to hold it, but within seconds it went trickling down my leg and through my tights and into my ballet slippers.   i then asked if i could go.. and i sprinted to the bathroom, where my mom stood outside, and when i came out she laughed and took me home.     :/|`|LROAETQCaa	vv|`|jmmWwOeyaa	This was just a few weeks ago, actually . I was playing hide & go seek with some friends, and when I was counting in the laundry room, I had to pee really bad! But I couldn't go to the bathroom, because I new they'd yell at me, considering the bathroom is upstairs! :o   So, I ended up putting a few Kleenex's in my underwear and letting a few drops out, hoping that would put my peeing desperation off until we were done playing hide & go seek.   Well, that only worked for about 5 minutes! It was now my turn to hide, and I was squatting down in a very uncomfortable position. Well...of COURSE the seeker took FoReVeR to find me! I just kept waiting and waiting and waiting, and  it was taking him forever! I was so uncomfortable, it was 6 at night and I hadn't gone since 10 that morning. And I drank 2 bottles of water and a can of pop. So I tried letting a few drops out to seize the pain but it started gushing out and I just could NOT stop! I was in my short, loose shorts so you could hear me peeing, it was hissing. It was SO loud and coming out SO hard, I couldn't stop! I was SO embarrassed! ):  And of course, once I was gushing fluids out of me, he found me!   D:
3zGxlguhaa	A few months ago my girlfriend and I were driving upstate to Buffalo. She was asleep in the passenger seat and I really had to go, so I picked up an empty water bottle and went. She woke up mid stream and yelled "What the f*ck are you doing to the bottle?" See.. she thought I was pleasuring myself. With the bottle. Bleh.|`|0mhcCyE5aa	I do not have any really bad ones!    But one Halloween I was going through a haunted house with a guy I just met and I was laughing so hard I peed myself a little.    I told him I did and we both laughed!!!!    We stayed around, so I guess the pee did not scare him away!|`|LUC2GDxTaa	I got locked in a toilet at my own birthday party... I was stuck in there for 10ish minutes while they were all eating without me... Was embarrassing when I came out... they all asked me where i'd been!|`|bR5zsODlaa	Hey, yeah, this isn't story time so you can satiate you sick scat fetish. Go to writing.com, it's filled with crap like that.|`|VLQXcPKfaa	I was driving up to manchester with my friends.   And i really needed the toilet.  But they wouldnt pull over because they were teasing me.  So i had to pee in a bottle in front of 2 guys and a girl.    but thats not the funniest part.    I didnt no what to do with the bottle, and if i chucked the whole bottle out, it might hit someone in the head and hurt them    So casually i emptied the bottle out the window, not thinking about when we are moving this is going to be dragged backwards.    Yes you've guessed it, straight into a cyclists face.  Must o thought it was rain or something. But still.    Mwahahaha. Me and my urea:D

0pXlz2rDaa	You should Prob. just tell her the truth, I mean if a girl told me that she couldn't be with me because she was worried that I would get hurt in the end I would respect it.  Also her being a girl, makes you look good if you dont sleep with her, it shows that you are a good guy, just not her type.  Make it Sound like you would like for it to be, but you cant.  It is all up to you, but girls are always going to be attracted to mysterious guys|`|3HhhHWd4aa	Be really mean to her.|`|e98RKB35aa	You can't make her hate you but just have a talk with her. A very sweet talk and explain things in a nice way how things will be. This will spare her feelings being hurt though if you put it nicely.|`|8AOgHjH0aa	ask her if she wants a penny chew, then eat it in front of her. Hmm maybe thats a bit harsh actually.|`|LNx2Xwy9aa	I think if you honestly told her what you just said then she should understand. Keep your distance if she continues persisting. The reason why the sweet girl does that is because she is blind to see the truth.    Best wishes!|`|gch0VuDjaa	Man up and let her know your not into her and you want nothing to with her.|`|Q8wjv9L2aa	ok im a girl i may not have any expirence with daiting and blowdy blaw but i say you talk to her about it 1st and if you cant do that you could ignore her srry this isnt much hope it helps|`|dd0d57e5ff24820c6981c10f9097112faa	doubtful that she thinks youre perfect.  sheesh!

0be09f180860e5920e1b8c5c6e2e7aebaa	love is a complex emotion and is felt differently for every peron. for me, i feel like im floating, and that nothing else matters. its the best feeling in the world to know that someone loves you as much as you love them.|`|qmXFCVMIaa	like to help but i've never felt love beyond my family ...but i think it is that feeling where you would do anything for that person, you would maybe not kill...but defiantly maim anyone who hurts them...  that feeling that no matter what they do, say, or feel you would allways come back and stand by their side...no matter what
pzdd90VZaa	I can see where-as your still feeling things for him..But you need to move on.    You have a new boyfriend and it's time to focus on that. I really don't think that you want to ruin another seemingly fine relationship because of an ex. It hurts to see them move on and date others, but you will learn to cope.    Goodluck love :)|`|naequcqlaa	I just feel it's bringing back a lot of old memories you had w/him in the past.  You haven't gone w/him for two yrs., so I don't feel it's a love feeling you have twds. him, plus you've moved on & are now going w/someone else.  Maybe you could even call it a kind of mild jealously in a way. Maybe a things that you once had, she now has type thing.  If they get along well, seem to really like one another, why don't you just try to accept he was part of your past.  We all have pasts, some were good, some not so good.  But truly do your best to accept this whole thing & be happy for her that she's happy & content w/who she has.  I honestly can appreciate how you must feel, & I'm sure it feels weird & unexplainable to you.  But again, put him in your past, completely let go of him & you'll feel so much better for it.  Things do happen for a reason, I'm a firm believer of that, we don't always know why but they do.  Seriously put him in your past, accept things as they are, & also that you have no control over the whole situation.  Be thankful you at least have someone & have a relationship of your own.  Lots of girls can't say that, but at least you can.  Be thankful for what you have.  I wish you all the best...:)
iPNOVR6Gaa	Do "things" change?  Lol - could you be any more vague and general?|`|368008361e77a77ceeb8c70a92a3c2b8aa	yes....but for the better....you have your friend, lover & life long companion for the rest of your life....it's wonderful!!|`|ZzEAc5ecaa	yes thay do and its for the better ..|`|gfHutvEFaa	Marriage doesn't fix things that are wrong in a relationship. If you have misgivings, do not walk down that aisle.|`|fHfVRcqbaa	Yes they do.|`|8txWayVnaa	Absolutely.  But not all change is "bad".    Admittedly, some things change when they really shouldn't.  You begin to take each other for granted, which is never good.      I find that when this question is asked, the focus is almost ALWAYS on how things negatively change.|`|6KpZ2fIRaa	most definitely|`|AA10034000	For some reason they do....reality sets in and then it is no longer fun it games, it is commitment time and the whole lusty lusty thing is out the door.....don't get married.|`|hhL1G3Ofaa	Eventually most things do, so marriage is no exception to the rules.  Changes will either be for the good or for the bad of the marriage.|`|MU8Z9pIPaa	yes your routine all changes!!|`|AA10392041	Of course it changes when you get married.  When you are alone, you have nobody to think about but yourself.  You have to consider your spouse when you marry.  Of course, if she/he did not consider you, I wouldn't consider them either.  Some spouses are easy going and some spouses are control freaks.  I have been with the easy going, the control freak, and the abuser.  I don't want that kind of toxic waste existing in my life.  Just make sure you know the significant other very well before marrying anyone.|`|Bc4udMhUaa	Yes, things do change with marriage. I guess it depends on whether you view those changes as a good thing (comfortable, stable, etc..) or a bad thing (mundane, boring, etc..).|`|zTQVC7GBaa	may be|`|vLgbjmI2aa	Yes things defenitely change but for the better.The love,passion,and friendship and all of the other wonderful things just get better as time goes by.|`|zKjgWdqAaa	Sure.  Things change whether you get married or not.  The challenge is to develop a relationship that will allow you to go through all the changes together.|`|UtCMCgDnaa	yes dear many things for that matter|`|bHfuVh6kaa	always - marriage makes a bad relationship worse and a good relationship  even better . but even the best marriages take a ot of work to keep them good :0)|`|1tdOW2Pfaa	My last name did.|`|bnFcjEptaa	Not if you work at it.  All good things take work and be sure that there's plenty of fun time.|`|r0D3eNPmaa	yes they do, sometimes for the better or sometimes for the worse. it all depends on how good you know your partner|`|671725ed075d3915b872f5076fee3788aa	yeah it is natural and must|`|MP4aWYIGaa	Yes a bit.......no more ME,MYSELF AND MINE...it will be all ours.....you have to start taking responsibility of well being of partner too.....got to control  temper.....develop patience...have to put more efforts than now to get things organised........lot more...but all for good............

At first I couldn't bring myself to tell her but then I did and it was really cool because now we double date a lot and i think my situation is a lot weirder but I think you should just go for who you like and your friend should be happy for you if you are happy!|`|dlmVTt18aa	I've dated friends brothers it never seemed to be a problem. Just make sure your friend knows first so that if you pursue it things won't be awkward.

I don't see whats so appealing about an athletic girl, a lot of times they just look manly. I would take a girl with some fat on her over a rock-hard girl anyday, regardless if they had the exact same face. Plus I love the big boobs and big butt. Kim Kardashian is the "ideal" chick in my opinion. And yeah im 16
tyRxu67daa	126 pounds isn't fat at all.  It is much better than being a twig like a lot of people your age are.|`|iVnQ4aCiaa	You are not fat, but you do need to work on your self esteem.|`|LrGZcI6yaa	That's not fat. You are the right size, actually your normal. Take a look at this site: http://www.halls.md/chart/women-weight-w...    Your perfectly normal, don't worry about it. P.s, your X is right, your not fat.|`|6487bd61ef059cac042d49119a814a4aaa	First thing it quit obsessing about your weight...you'll get annoying and apparently already have with your X.  Second, just eat healthy foods and lots of exercise...you'll lose some weight, tone up but not lose either of your "assetts".|`|9fAHd15Caa	well first of all, your ex was a d*ck head, guys should tell you that your beautiful without you having to ask for it! you're normal but just pointing out, a lot of that weight is probably from yor butt and boobs so if you want to lose weight your going to have to lose them a LITTLE.|`|KCKq9duJaa	No your fine your a very healthy weight for your hight.   Those skinny girls are to skinny.  All the guys would agree with me.  your perfect dont change at all.|`|2TZOekoRaa	well idk im 12 5'0-5'1 and way 85 pounds so idk in my opinion u are not fat just regular|`|jqFS16Rjaa	thats no where near fat|`|VJZ8KXSjaa	Get over yourself hun, you need a hobby or something.|`|M7gf7Xoiaa	You're not fat whatsoever. but if you want to feel good about yourself no matter what, EXERCISE but don't forget to eat as much as your body tells you to. I used to feel fat but then I became a swimmer and weight is not even an issue anymore because I always feel healthy. Plus I get to eat like a pig and still maintain/lose weight.|`|EJxDQoNHaa	you are not fat, you are healthy.
RCGh7GTQaa	If this guy won't accept you for who you are, ditch him immediately.   You deserve so much better than him. If you have so many physical flaws that bother him then leave him and find someone that will accept you. If he says your boobs aren't the right size, you're not tanned enough, or thin enough, this guy seriously needs a reality check. Not everyone can look like a barbie, so he can kiss your *** goodbye.|`|4HoVVCenaa	Dump him... breaking promises is unacceptable.|`|53aUYsqtaa	your friend is an jerk not all guys watch porn|`|B3VYy8sFaa	ok.. yes, 99.999% of guys look at porn. I really don't recommend trying to get him to stop. It won't work, he's going to continue doing it, porn is normal and healthy- as long as it's not anything illegal.    However, my issue with this is him telling you that you're not good enough. You shouldn't be with anyone who makes you feel that way... porn is supposed to be a fantasy, something (most) guys can't get- so it's a way for them to have healthy fantasies.    I would seriously consider this relationship and the mental abuse.. but not just because he watches porn|`|fc964df50bc3ae84b97937ecb982821baa	No, not every guy looks at it...and you shouldn't let yourself be convinced that its okay or normal!|`|8p31dENPaa	Get rid of him. Period.

6wR9QkAlaa	Well no one maybe answering because you're not making much sense! He couldn't stop looking at her, but she got on the metro and he walked away?  What? How did he have time to be staring at her as the metro pulled up. I don't get what you're saying! Word it better, ask again!  But sounds like he's being a typical boy who fancies people for about five seconds and then loses interest. You guys are young, move on.|`|9FyxeA1Zaa	lol wut?     speak english dear for one cannot understand that jibba jabba you've written!|`|1YT1tYyUaa	im confused your question makes no sense!|`|daoORTdVaa	if your online lets talk on im
x0KszFPMaa	do they really only look at your body? what hope does that give girls who aren't well endowed?|`|bGTWhNGzaa	They mostly like their boobs
wHdxiYgXaa	ik how that feels.   my ex dumped me for one of my friends that he got close with through drama class.  just tell him that.   but dont cause a scene.  you'll regret it in the end    no worries  goodluck
dlmVTt18aa	Maybe she's over her past relationships and is focused on her current one. There may not be any reason for her to look back into the past.|`|z7JsVzcnaa	Talking about past relationships is generally a relationship no no.|`|eO4y3m1maa	Some people don't  like talking about their past...except it.
fMDS4vTGaa	You are in the process of grieving the loss of the relationship you once had. Regardless of the problems in the past or future, your emotional side is still yearning for the comfort of the attachment.     That is normal and you will get over it in time and each day that passes will ease the process.  I would imagine that in a few months you'll be over him.      Also, try to keep your contact with him to a minimum and casual, try to suppress your emotional side wanting to talk about the old times or if you can get him back.  Work through that and soon it will be easier to the point where before you know it, you'll be wondering what you were so upset about anyway!    Good luck|`|FWsv3Schaa	just be friends FOR NOW. it didnt work out in your relationship, so dont try to make anything work out. if he only broke up with you cause he was leaving, then theres a chance he will try to get back with you when he gets back. good luck!    answer mine on my page?|`|xri2lFpKaa	if he really loves u he will get back together with u|`|LUC2GDxTaa	Everyone says long-distance relationships don't work but he's coming back. It would help to know how long he's gone for, but if I was in your situation there would be no hesitation - if you really loved him then there should be no question about it and you should stay in contact.|`|AA11298074	start dating...do your own thing....he's obviously doing what he wants to do, so should you....don't wait around on him, but if you're still single when he gets back then be open to the possibility.....stay friends but don't wait around|`|60a3bbdca78e74fb19db426e27b9a087aa	I think you should try to move on. If you are meant to be together then time will show that to be true, but holding on and waiting around (even if it's just in your heart) is only going to hold you back.    If he had felt the same way he would not have wanted to end it. It sounds like you guys had a fun time and a nice connection but I would suggest trying to busy yourself with other interests. Right now it feels overwhelming because he just left, but in time you will feel better.    You never know, by the time he comes back you could be in a completely different place about it.    Do what he is doing, move on and live your life.|`|DaFIrZVxaa	I would stay good friends, but if it doesn't work out, oh well.  Stay in touch and if it's to mutch for you, moving on helped me in similer situations.|`|bIn9jxtRaa	Stay his friend. Did you ever think that maybe he isnt happy about having to go overseas and study? Just be polite but dont put your whole self into it. When your ready go out on dates and have a good time. When he comes home for good maybe you can try things again. Good luck|`|vIiUsSIDaa	This is a dude speaking i think you should move on and talk because if he's going to be gone for more than 2 months he sink to temptation and get laid with another girl and he might feel bad but he'll get over you so don't get yourself hurt by holding on to the pieces of the broken relationship|`|vL3MR3DWaa	you should still keep in contacts with him. don't get your hopes up to high when he gets back tho. don't give up on something you cant go a day without thinking about
qwVruoJ8aa	sorry but i can't read this broke english or hieroglyphics
vHDiHL43aa	Haha, that's exactly how I am... Maybe there's just no hope for us pretty, clumsy girls! I'm only kidding... That would be a really silly reason for a guy to not like a girl. People keep me around for my clumsiness.. I've been told it's entertaining... I've embraced it! hahaha. I'm sure that if you are very outgoing and pretty and a good person... a great guy will come along soon enough!|`|3y0w1qIBaa	I don't mind if the girl is clumsy.  My arms will be open to catch her when she falls.|`|qwVruoJ8aa	no one is perfect as long as you are pretty that's what counts don't worry about tripping i can catch you|`|haWw3B8aaa	Not for most guys.|`|aUDVBmZSaa	You can't even walk without tripping? That is kind of weird. Maybe those people are just being nice cause I'm pretty sure I wouldn't care if a girl was clumsy since she was pretty.|`|thmlwAZDaa	gosh  i wanna know because i am the same way|`|MyjJaoHyaa	Haha!  im so very clumsy too!  tho ive been with my boyfriend for 19months,  at 1st he used to laugh at everything i did   but now he mostly ignores it, picks me up of the floor or out of someones prize flower bed, with stopping walking or missing a beat  its kinda tuned into his head now he can predict when things are gonna happen!|`|acOsNWjWaa	Sum guys thay dont mind if a girl is very clumsy i love a clumsy girl  ;-)
jbTNER3caa	Sweetie, do you mean you had sex during the time you were together or that you had break up sex?  Why don't you text him and ask?  Or since he's your best friend's brother, why don't you ask your friend?  I'm guessing he's not going to tell complete strangers anything.  Sorry...  Try talking to him.
0mhcCyE5aa	You did not give any details here.    If you like her, I hope she likes you!|`|COmp4sIuaa	Yessss, a lesbian question.    Yes, you both like each other and you wrestle each other in mud.|`|cO6BD3hVaa	wut?  Please use English on Yahoo!

As of now, i have no clue what you are talking about.

Is this a *** kind of question kind somthin|`|AV9h7Dikaa	If you talk like that, she probably wants to beat the crap out of you.|`|FVRVjYTqaa	Is this a rhetorical question?
YCICrIKyaa	Well, I haven't been in your shoes before.. I don't ever say that unless I mean it.    My partner said it to me first and it was a little too fast for me at the time.. I went out and got a card and it said that I liked her a lot.     If she was to say that to me again afterwards, I usually brush it off and hug her or something along those lines. Give her a little kiss.    Later on I did end up saying it and it has been several years since we had just started dating so it is very much the truth when it comes out of my mouth now!      I suggest just not saying it anymore.
MYbRICxqaa	Well, I will space myself from my boyfriend until the situation is taking care of. If you don't wanna do that then get a restraining order on her or depending on her age then go to her parents. Also, you didn't mention your boyfriend what is he doing about it? Actually, this isn't your place to be in this. What kind of boyfriend does this to his girlfriend?|`|7rb2F3TJaa	LOL!|`|10QSTGWAaa	I, personally, would be the $H!+ out of her to teach her a lesson. If that doesn't work, or isn't your style, try talking with your bf about it. If he doesn't care, then that's a clue that something's wrong right there. If he can't do anything about it, it's time to go to the police.    But seriously, if she's attacking you, fight back, or she'll think she can get away with it.|`|zFpHpqiLaa	haha ur being attacked by a ****** retard get a shotgun and blow her brains out|`|3ZhwIAn1aa	well sweetheart if that is the case you should let him know about if he doesn't do anything about it then get a new boyfriend i mean don't you people check the backgrounds before dating someone|`|onSmS1Uraa	Call the cops and get a restraining order if you really like the guy, and even if you don't. If you ditch the guy and she still comes after you, that's gonna be crazy. Get the restraining order and tell them everything she has done to you and get the restraining order so she can't come near you, and if she ever comes near you then she could probably go to jail.|`|XAw4cJmjaa	You could always get a restraining order!!  Crazy chicks like that won;t get the picture to stay away unless you do something drastic!|`|pIkPHuWyaa	Contact the police and get a restraining order.  Once she is served by the police, she will realize how much trouble she can get herself in.  When someone still loves another person and sees them with someone else, it is heartbreaking and can cause them to do stupid things until they realize the ramifications of their actions.|`|W1acmSMFaa	lol      I feel bad for you.     I dont know.    I'm really sorry|`|M3CVx4N7aa	If she is following you and harming you that's assault and you need to call the police about that. Does your bf know what's going on?|`|bn4aVQjyaa	You can either beat the **** out of her..Or call the police and file a restraining order on her
6487bd61ef059cac042d49119a814a4aaa	First, put the condom back on.  You don't need an unwanted pregnancy.  It could be that he's masturbated for so long that he is having trouble having the real thing.  Let him hold it while it's going in and out..that should do it for now and eventually he won't have to do that.|`|zKjgWdqAaa	Keep the condom on.      This is a common problem, especially for young guys.  He's probably masturbated thousands of times and is used to coming that way, so this is something new that takes getting used to.  Try different positions.  Some guys have more success if the girl is on top, and many do better taking the girl from behind.  You'll like these too.  Good luck.|`|qRIMM2ycaa	Every guy is different. Talk to him during sex, and get him to comment on your performance. Does he like what you're doing or not? Does he want more of a specific action?    Only he can really tell you.|`|m8C8MU2Maa	He's probably on anti-depressants or anxiety pills and he should ask his doctor.  Otherwise just ask him what he wants you to do.|`|hZlwaaP2aa	Really? That's strange...  A friend of mine has told me that after a while it was harder to get her man to ejaculate or do it as much as he used to, but I never heard of him just not being able to do it.  Talk to him and ask him what's up. Tell him that you want to have him c** too and you want to know what to do to make it happen for him. I'm sure he'll be more than happy to give you some pointers ;)|`|4bWUiIVdaa	First of all, USE CONDOMS. Actually something you could do is put on the condom for him only veeeery slowly. That tends to help!|`|TMi1GhSHaa	you better be on the birth control pill or your next question might be "am i pregnant im only 15 years old!!" lol.|`|fk8wXA3Saa	Lend him a hand ?|`|VDlvSMP1aa	some guys just cant unless they are controlling everything.. If I were you I wouldnt be opposed to some online research.    good luck|`|fk3TFlTlaa	I think he watches too much porn, and has learned to become immune to ejaculating inside the vagina. Instead, he wants to blow it on your face.|`|kqa9VFrfaa	U R not doing anything wrong. It seems U R quite right for him so far. He is either not confident in himself, or he just knows what he wants. It is far easier for some men to take care of themselves, especially if they are used to it. They do not have to exert as much energy, as they would in the traditional way. U might have your work cut out for U if U want this guy to change his routine.|`|8s9q4V03aa	wait, you wana get pregnant?wow|`|T1j73RZpaa	Hmmm...google it?|`|B8Exjv8gaa	as long as the condom is off your in the clear.. prob the smartest thing youve said.|`|Fc4WF8Pqaa	your not doing anything wrong. google it. some guys have this problem where they can't ejaculate while having sex. it's the opposite of P.E.
Yjs2x29taa	I wouldn't do that; she may go to the police.|`|POHWTDPRaa	Write her a note. After she sees the way you spell she will cry. Trust me.    If you want to do this how are you not a jerk? If you deliberately do something mean to someone, you are a jerk regardless of whether they did something mean to you first. Someone doing something bad doesn't get you a free pass to do something bad yourself.|`|517360c1a1db979fb2f19bbb959f22eaaa	Huh?|`|DOoHDBTiaa	could u write better.|`|sCr2iTczaa	i have no idea what you just said this question makes no sense what so ever i understand you want to make a girl cry, which makes you a little twat jerk. And you are gonna do it by a prank call. Ok children i think it is time to grow up. I mean seriously prank calling is the most stupidest thing ever. I think you need to grow up you are childish why would you want to make someone cry any ways.|`|o4QRCMueaa	that's really mean wow, maybe u should just step up your game a little, but if u really want an answer find out something embarrassing about her (everyone has monsters in there closet) and then pranking her and say if u don't back off I'll tell someone who matters. But learn how too type first off and if u do go through with it your concouios is gonna kill in the end|`|VHzFxMiqaa	first learn how to type|`|AA10685337	Learn to write, that's just unintelligible!|`|9580a1e44dd3d2bae7d2f867611ab353aa	? umm not a good idea.|`|5Ks1bEVXaa	so people DO come on this site drunk....|`|fe8aa5495caab3873690c07d37e65268aa	You are not nice.  You say you like him.  She likes him.  It is up to him to decide if he wants more than friendship from either of you.      If you are mean as you are suggesting, then it will backfire and the consequences of your actions will catch up to you.    Be yourself.  So what if you feel you have competition, it is healthy.  Relationships are not a game.  If things are meant to be, they will be.  Don't act out on someone because you think the guy might like her more because she likes him.    That is the wrong way to think.|`|qRIMM2ycaa	I don't understand most of what you wrote.    A prank call that will make her cry in this day and age is a very dumb thing to do. Consider that most people have call display, and there are numbers she could call to get your phone number.  Worse off if she knows you and recognizes your voice.  You could end up with a criminal record if she decides to press charges over harassment or threats.    Try being an adult and just talking to her in person.  Your question also makes it seem like you're not even dating the guy yet, so I'd caution you to be even more careful. Guy's don't like horrible catty women.|`|QGsYPJoKaa	1. learn to type properly.  2. learn how to be a nice person.  3. get a consciouns.  4. Don't be so full of yourself.|`|97Hnt7Ywaa	I don't understand you..0_0...  well, um if you prank call her and she cried, call her back and apologize to her.|`|GSEBCYeUaa	ur a ***|`|mZWpe3r2aa	why would you want to make her cryy???? =( thats so mean, come on.|`|Ir4754CNaa	you are a f*cking idiot.  +2|`|T0dPL9wBaa	That's horrible.

zzaScg0haa	It depends on the guy, he might also think your not interested
MYbRICxqaa	Why would I forgive him? He did you wrong. He should be the one asking for forgiveness. I wouldn't even put up with a person like that. Didn't you see the signs before you got with him. There had to be some around you and him. Think about it.|`|838VJJGvaa	Forgive him but also forget him.

qSgdlWWNaa	Hey, im sort of in the same situation. This guy I like, best friend, has a girlfriend... Anyway, one day we were talking and the topic came up ad he asked me who I liked. I told him it was this guy he didn't know and he kept asking me about him saying stuff like if the guy didn't like me, he wasn't good enough for me... We kept having this conversation and he kept telling me to tell the guy and if he was really my friend, nothing would change. In the end i gave in and i told him.     To tell you the truth, nothing has really changed and hes still just as nice to me as before. It has sort of cleared the air between us too and were kind of closer to each other than we where before.    Anyway, I just wanted to give you the same advice he gave me... tell him because you have nothing to lose. If he doesn't like you back, hes not good enough for you, and if you lose your friendship, it wasn't a proper friendship in the first place. If you are as close as you are to each other as you say you are, nothing should change. Whats the worst that can happen?
naequcqlaa	In all honesty you can't blame him for his feelings.  He was hurt badly once & just doesn't want to take that chance again.  He has no guarantee you have changed, only you know that.  I would say you have no alternative but to accept the way he feels.  You can't make him do something he doesn't want to do.  Maybe if he sees you around & you look & seem like a different person, he might think about it & might change his mind.  I'm sorry, I know it hurts, but I'm sure of one thing, there WILL be another person in your life at some time even if it's not him.  You're young, have your whole life ahead of you, so I'm sure there w/be a few someone elses yet to come.  Take care...:)
7Jm2ZZGzaa	i have a friend that has used em b4 n said the 1s she used tasted like whatev it said it was supposed 2...ive never made a guy wear a condom 4 oral so i wouldnt know...that doesnt make sense 2 me|`|NREqhragaa	.. idk ive never used it... but sum of my friends chew on them in school...and they say it tastes good...

Funny story: my friend's younger brother found some of there condoms in her room a while ago when he was about 6 or so years old and thought they were chewing gum (chewed on them of course), so next time they went to the store, he brought a pack of condoms to the register to his mum and told her that she forgot the gum LOL

mCUNl9Wgaa	Sex and love are completely separate. Sex augments a relationship when two people are in love. You can be in love and have sex. But just because you have sex does not necessarily mean you have love (i.e. a hookup, not your monogamous long term partner). Sex is a physical act.|`|LykjWv6faa	Sex is just the act with no real feelings for them. Love is when you care about the person and have strong feelings for them.|`|bf3bc2c3811507a54ef69dd9118ca5a3aa	You can love lots of things, you can love your parents, love a pet, love your siblings... sex is the act of procreation.

A coupon book with things he can redeem at anytime (ie back rub, hair cut on you, dinner prepared by you).      A mix cd of songs that make you think of him or your relationship.|`|VO1zmW4daa	dunno man|`|sq6nIm70aa	anal|`|fFcgBUjyaa	Just spend the whole day together :)|`|dLRquZ3Kaa	It depends on how much you are willing to spend...  if ur willing to go BIG get him an Acer laptop, they are small and cost around $400... but if you are not willing to go big, it depends on his interest... if hes into sports, get him a jersey of his favorite team... or a reasonably priced watch? Have a guy that has everything? MAke your own coupons like"Good 4 one kiss" stuff like that... He might appreaciate it
Yloq3yLHaa	True Sikhs believe in the equality of all people and are strongly opposed to racism. Nevertheless many Sikhs prefer that their children marry a Sikh regardless of that persons race. Some things have nothing to do with Sikhism and are just a part of Punjabi culture. Arranged marriage is a part of Punjabi culture and since most Sikhs are Punjabi it is common, but not required for Sikhs to have an arranged marriage. Even when Sikhs choose to have an arranged marriage the bride and groom are still given plenty of opportunity to get to know one another and decide not to get married.|`|yQRVxC61aa	well its not jst the case of being a sikh.. in most asian specificaly-indian,pakistani and bangladeshi community.. having bf is not acceptable to parents. parents as per old traditions look fwd to picking their galz groom.. and second. not being racist or anythng. but asian communities realy dont prefer guyz from other backgrounds and sometimes nationality.. its jst whacko job with their brainz.. m realy sry if it offended u.. the gal u mentioned jst seems to be taking precaution.. jst w8 to and if it boders u so much.. jst talk to her.. i believe when ur in love/relationship u shldnt let nethng bother u..or come b/w the relationship ...good luck..|`|WCA1DOcWaa	her parents might not want her to date a guy from a different race. talk to her about it.

Doing any drugs, especially something as strong as oxycontin, runs the risk of overdosing and killing oneself or seriously damaging the body or the brain. You should ask him to find an addicts support group that he could go to.   If he has had a problem in the past, then the chances of him going back to those bad habits are very high!

If you're too shy then just say hi.|`|FAMRtYn9aa	I understand that you've been talking to him a lot? If so, do something that will make him want you. Don't be too clingy and don't show that you're already whipped (if you are). Play hard to get a bit. Instead become friends with his friends and start flirting with them, but don't make it too obvious.     However, if you're not that kind of person I suggest that you first become FRIENDS with him. Talk about anything and everything. The key to a good relationship is for friendship to be there. Show him you're not one of those typical girls ya know? And always be yourself! ALWAYS.

Yes, you are!|`|tsdHndRhaa	yep!|`|ML1zkPibaa	The crucial mistake you made was telling him you wanted to take it slow and then sleeping with him after a week.    If you were/are looking for a relationship with this guy (read: not a one night stand), you should not have jumped into bed with him so soon.  Of course, he's mostly interested in having sex with you because you gave it up too soon.    Sit him down and talk to him.  Ask him if he's interested in a relationship or just having fun.  If it's the latter, chalk this up to experience and move on...unless you're not looking for a relationship either.  If he's interested in more than just fun, tell him you feel pressure from him to have sex all the time when you really would like to spend more time getting to know him.    Lessons learned:   1 - Dating someone you work with rarely (if ever) ends happily   2 - If you want a relationship with a guy, don't sleep with him after a week.   3 - If you say you want to take it slow, STICK TO IT!  A guy will respect you more for sticking to your convictions.  If he doesn't, toss him to the curb.|`|HDanuTC0aa	sorry honeybunch, ur a booty call. he may have acted like he wanted a relationship, but we all know what guys want, no matter how sweet they are. i thought u said u wanted to take it slow. when u want to take it slow, u don't sleep with the dude. honestly if u didn't sleep with him, he would've moved on to another girl. sorry this had to happen to you. just move on, and find someone who will actually love you, and not just the sex.

He`ll probably go something like " you are not " or " why do you think that " - then you can say - because you think i`ll cheat with (names of friends) because some other silly girl did that as well.    Explain to him that these people were friends of yours before you and him became an item, and that you are your own person, and you will not be manipulated or controlled.  He should learn to trust you - end of story.     (of course, if you were cheating, then this is all academic)    Any man who wants to determine who a woman can and cannot see, is a control freak, and should either find a good therapist, or go into a monastery to become a monk.|`|jC9J0Ctuaa	first mistake was to go with it at the beginning.

She despised all of my chick friends. What your boyfriend is doing is controlling you. I understand the cheating aspect, but my god, get over it! (Not you, your boyfriend). If you promised to be faithful, that ought to be good enough for him. Always bear in mind, your friends were there before your boyfriend. They always will be.     But, here's a suggestion, have your boyfriend tag along with you when you're hanging out with your friends. That alleviated some of the resentment with my ex.|`|1C0Tm9ipaa	Why don't you take him along when you go with your friends? show him that you do want to be with him.|`|B8IPtjEVaa	well tell him that there your friends. that whatever is worring him about them isn't going to happen.|`|0b69f105ff4b59337ac981d520e9f6f4aa	That's cause he's a guy & Knows how guys can be. Lots of us are total opportunists.|`|0qm2raXBaa	I would suggest trying to be more sensitive about the subject.  Maybe he doesn't have a lot of girlfriends and/or you're not the jealous type but this is a serious issue.  He may be insecure because of past relationships but he is just cautious.  If you want to see you guy friends, maybe you could ask your boyfriend to come along...This way, he will see that they're not trying to get with you, if that is true.  If you don't want him to hang out with you and your guy friend, then maybe subconsciously you have something to hide..maybe you really wanna get with them.  I don't know.  I would suggest trying first to get your boyfriend more involved.  Good luck.
oJREkyDDaa	You could just put "Be mine." I think he'll get the message then.  Hope this helped.

(air force)..=)|`|IcUsSPeUaa	Here's my advice.     1.) Talk to girls more often. e.i. "Hi, how are you?" "Hey, what's up?" and move on from there. Get to know each other     2.) Be completely honest    3.) Be yourself, hypocrites are unattractive (duh)    4.) Be open-minded, respectful and don't act like a pervert. I promise you, if sex is your goal you'll get nowhere.    5.) Only complement if you mean it. For example, if a girl asks you "Am I pretty?" don't say yes if you don't think so. Some people say that you should always say yes to a question like that but it can bring up future problems.    Good luck.|`|1C0Tm9ipaa	You have to try talking to them.|`|IEfFafQsaa	well u need to have a personality, show them that u are worthy of their attention. i mean dont be obnoxious trying to impress people but u can try to stand out a little more maybe|`|3enJVNDdaa	Some people are just born unlucky.

It's just my opinion!!|`|96zZlJVYaa	that depend on what plus size she is...some plus size women carry their weight well enough to hot. for example: Kirstie Alley from Cheers, when she went to plus size she still look hot. its all depend on the guy as well the women look in her clothes feel about herself.|`|BOHi9zfcaa	Every guy is different...but I think what every guy can agree on is the face/personality. Body can matter but if you've got a killer personality/face then you'll be beautiful :)  Think of it like this...what do women consider as "hot" when looking at guys? Style, personality, overall looks, right? Same goes with guys. Overall I think "hot" is overrated - it tends to have a sexual vibe to it, dont you think? Why not go for beautiful, pretty, cute?     If you really wanna know, plus-size can be fine - more so if the woman has a larger chest too.|`|pZevjTXGaa	it all depends|`|RXSu3VNdaa	I am proportionate and I hear about my weight too much.

I think you could help !! TY
R3dk8fC1aa	i am 19 as well, turning 20 very soon. i think our relationships are different in the simple fact that SHE broke up with ME, but still similar.    firstly, the friends do NOT have nearly as much power as you would believe, unless she is rediculously insecure. but if she were rediculously insecure, she would have taken you back the moment you started showing interest again.    its been a long time since july, and a year isnt THAT long of a relationship. its easily possible that she has goten over you by now, which would make it a real shame that it took you so long to want her back. but, especialy if this is the first guy she has dated since you broke up, its OK. your 19, and i presume she is roughly the same age, and a year is still enough time to develop a bond which cant be forgoten. she will be comparing every guy she dates even encounters, in the back of her mind, to you, even if its subconsiously.    ask yourself "how could any other guy honestly measure up to you?"  let her date other guys. you should only talk to her seldomly, and only if she calls, and when she does, dont even mention other guys, simply have a conversation. if she can have fun talking or hanging out with you for a short time, she will want you around a little more.     its not really about "what to do to get her back" its more like, "what you need to NOT do to ruin your chances that it will happen by itself"    its a little tricky, based on your story she hasnt permanantly labled you as a "good friend", but dont let that happen. dont let her confide in you when shes feeling down, dont be an ***, but skillfully avoid the situation.    the hurtful things when you split up might warrant an appology, but dont bring up any relationship issues, its in the past, let it go. dont try to justify behavior, assign blame, none of it.     back to the dating thing. think of it this way. you said you ended things with other girls you were seeing, so you were back in the dating pool, and it helped you to realize the girl you truly wanted. shes just starting to get back in the dating pool, and you need to just let the exact same thing happen to her. let her realize that she wants you back. women are not logical creatures, you cant convince them to do anything, it has to be their idea.    like i said, its all about "not doing the wrong stuff" rather than "doing all the right stuff"
b4utBwY9aa	She's not really giving you a choice.     She's with this other guy, but still telling you that she loves you so that when the other relationship is over, she still has someone to fall back on.    I'll bet that if you began seeing someone else, she'd be pissed.    I think that as long as you hold on and wait for her, the more miserable you'll be.    Find another, you'll be ok :)
ZlgRne3caa	Sounds like she has a crush!|`|Qe9EULsdaa	I think you babies need to get off yahoo answers|`|tzzYdnZKaa	It sounds like she likes you.
vjxroyxjaa	Well, u should try and talk to him. I mean it takes a lot to tell someone ur true feelings and all and he should really respect that. He needs to show it b talking to u. Some times guys dont talk to girls when they get "scared". Maybe something u said was a little too deep or serious for him. I mean if u really lik him and think that somethn could happen, keep at it. Try and talk to him and all but try doin in a fun upbeat way. Dont come across as needy or clingy. If u realize u dont lik him, hopefully u two can stay friends and move on.   Best of Luck!  -Phillypride2012mtu@yahoo.com
0qm2raXBaa	Start up a conversation with him and see if he can follow.  If so, continue the conversation about anything and everything and then kind of hint that you want to go out.  And hopefully he'll ask. then maybe you two can live happily ever after.|`|Lj751YtAaa	Go up to him and talk to him. Find out how he feels and then ask if he wants to go out. Or maybe he will ask you out. Good luck!|`|4NZtFNC1aa	Get up, and go talk to him..  Talk to him about class to start of with, you need to get to know each other before you officially "go out", well thats my opinion..but just go and talk to him, it will [hopefully] work out.      Good luck.  ;)|`|7BkbvD7Zaa	Try talking to him.    And than take things from there.    Good Luck.|`|pc1EKWSuaa	first just go and talk 2 him.....second if u still thinks that u like him then go confess 2 him....|`|TMi1GhSHaa	talk to him its the ONLY way to find out.. seriously or else in 2 years you will be asking "did i miss my chance".. or "how do i get over him i liked him for 2 years" seriously.. just ask him, get it over with.. you could be missing the best thing that could ever happen to you ;p
oJREkyDDaa	Yes it sounds like she does like you, so just ask her.  Hope this helped and good luck.

ifC1aFHxaa	Probably.  His reaction would be a lot more neutral if he didn't feel anything, and if he didn't like you he'd have said so.  Why do you care? Are you still interested in him now? If you are, then you have to let him know. Be bold and invite him to something at school.|`|RpfOKba8aa	Yes, sounds like he did, and possibly does now.  (:

i7rYRvlTaa	i think she likes you or she wouldn't be inviting you on all of these dates.  if she were just a friend she would maybe write or something and she seems to be giving way more effort than that.|`|owuF63XWaa	she likes you.|`|B0ypUuHXaa	I hate to tell you this, but she may be upset after her divorce, and just needs a male to talk to. At the same time, she could like you more than a friends, because she seems to be getting close. You wouldn't ask your pupil round for dinner unless you wanted more of a relationship. You said that she was hot, so maybe keep a low key relationship until you leave school. After that, there's nothing wrong with marriage and babies.     Good luck with your hot teacher!|`|4dOUhlTtaa	yep she totaly loves you   GO 4 IT!!!!!!!!|`|E9F6qjRWaa	i am gonna go with she likes you but by "hanging" with her is dating her and its not right to date married ppl. and just bc she is divorcing her husband doesnt mean she is divorced!!|`|6TVl5nTBaa	It sounds like she kind of likes you, everything you guys do are things that couples do. It is a little weird that she was your teacher, but then again you are out of school and a grown man. I say go for it, but move slowly. Next time you go out tell her how you feel and see if the feeling is mutual. Or ask her first how she feels.|`|dZ1efw1Paa	yah it sounds like it.  or shes extremely friendly....    hey, if you wanna, go for it.  if not, back away.|`|SOxdyWQOaa	yeah sounds like it been there myself and started dating my ex teacher it worked out.|`|5FVyVS9vaa	Good Grief, do you want her to put it in writing? But watch out or you could get blamed for her divorce if there is one. You could become the other guy.|`|2216244481d213debef4605befb5d3a2aa	RUN, RUN LIKE THE WIND!!!  Sounds to me like she is trying to prove something to herself or her soon to be ex-husband that she is still attractive enough to get a MUCH younger man.  My feeling is she will just use you and no one wants to be used for ANY reason.
T0i2iB22aa	YOUR BOTH 12.  Please you are both too young to be worrying over relationship trouble.  My best friend is a guy and we are inseparable but we have talked us as a relationship out before, we both know we do not like each other.    And copying is never a good thing.
5nlqFbmtaa	does he look at you a lot if so he might i have the same problem right know and im to shy to ask him if he likes me|`|164570442fdcbed0f40e403fe75de089aa	go up to him and kiss him... youll knoe then
NUWdgQuraa	Well, you need to realize that you're young, and that your boyfriend isn't the love of your life.  That's okay.  He's moved onto another chapter of his life, and you're not really a part of it anymore.  You like someone else, so that's life telling you it's time to end the long-distance relationship.    Do that first, and then your options will be open to pursue whomever you want.
EDXh0tk9aa	Stop calling him, texting him, emailing and talking to him and see what happens.
Z11jZXOmaa	huh?!........|`|6ZmiuwWDaa	Massage the earlobes, it is a sensitive part of the body that will get the stimulation going, particularly when ones stressed I learned that in Meet the Fockers lol|`|buJCtC54aa	finger their arms
odQewFgvaa	You don't love him enough to get married. That is ok, best you figured it out before you get married.|`|TTfkI4Zqaa	you need to stop texting this guy, you are just getting cold feet. you need to spend more time with your finance. do more things together, go on a vacation. just try and get your mind back on him. you obviously loved him enough to say yes when he asked you to marry him.|`|AA11100500	If you loved him you wouldn't texting and likeing another bloke... Just move on so your man doesn't get hurt anymore.|`|XdqvvLaiaa	Sit and think about what you really want for yourself.  Talk to your fiiancee.  if your not sure about marriage, tell him your having second thoughts.  That you feel to young and want to explore the world a lil more.  if he loves you enough, he'll understand.|`|AsFiWxhUaa	20 in my opinion is way too young to get married! you need to take a break and figure things out before you say "i do". If you don't it will more than likely end in divorce and that is not anything fun to go through. best of luck!
XRD7qfg7aa	you look like an alien...  or she just wants you to come talk to her.  lol.   good luck.
OeDysQSmaa	Well maybe you could just drop it into conversation, you could say you were thinking of going to the cinema at the weekend and if she wasn't busy then you thought you could go together.     If you really are shy you could tell her over an email but face to face is usually better becuase then she knows your not joking or only asking her for a laugh.     Good luck :)|`|yr1685V1aa	just say it !!:).x|`|jXAJZ23Saa	you sound lovely by the way :) and if it was me i would just ask her! shes not going to say no unless shes been SERIOUSLY leading you on, which im sure she hasnt. when your about to ask her next week, if your scared just think about how good it will be when she says yes, then youll never have to ask her out again - its over and done with.    gooood luck :)|`|53U4ce9caa	First off that is so adorable that you are nervous to ask her out, whatever you do dont text her out or e-mail her out cause thats really weird. The time will come where you will get enoguh confidence to ask her out. Maybe say to her we should go hang out sometime, and then after a few "hang out" times ask her to be your girlfriend. Hope it works out best of luck!|`|Q0DfC12xaa	dude just grab her and kiss her if not then ask her out on aim or something
erwQsFyHaa	She may have found someone else that she is into. This may be her way of trying to get you to end the relationship. You know make you mad enough to dump her. But one can never know what is going on inside a woman's mind. Just letting you look at it from every angle.|`|51a318b835befd29d22ff2a38e8b5353aa	you clearly pushed her to have it, and while shes still attracted to you, shes realised sex is something that she isnt comfortable doing yet. if you really care about her, you can stop having sex until shes ready, and shell love you so much more if she has it when shes ready and tells you "i want to have sex with you" before you ask her or anything|`|Rxj2HNZCaa	I would just give her some time.  4 Months is a relatively short time, so she may of just started second guessing her self.
oJREkyDDaa	Yes I think you do still have a chance. If you both want it to work, then i'm sure it will. Just take each day as it comes for now and you both have to work at it.  Hope this helped and good luck with that.
Run7dyraaa	Bad news girl. I've been there, and done that. And had my insides tore out. Handsome, married, sexy. Painfully handsome. Go too close to the fire and you WILL get burnt. Stay away.

He WON'T leave his wife.|`|q2AsDnjpaa	Nothing  anything above nothing would be stalking|`|6wNbnZNKaa	he's married. dont ruin his relationship with his wife. stay friends. or i'll see you all on the next episode of cheaters|`|gOtoO3vUaa	Hes married, forget about him, things will just get complicated if you get involved with him, and you will feel guilty!!!

Godbless|`|lFqm9XlUaa	If you want him so bad, go tell his wife, I am sure she will give him to u after the divorce.|`|5IIEknR7aa	Hi there!! Sorry to say.. this thing you experienced with this married guy just got as good as it could get and it is over.. because he is married!!  He probably wanted some kind of an approval, which for sure you gave him!! Just see it as a steamy memory and let go..if he wasn't a professional friend I would have suggested to be mad at him bcs he toyed with you!! But now I suggest you forget about the whole thing and ignore the fact that anything happened, when he is around and be how you used to be for professional reasons and nothing more.  Good Luck|`|EXisORX2aa	he's married. maybe he's debating about what to do.|`|Q5KFND17aa	Um...he is MARRIED.  He shouldn't have led you on like that and I feel sorry for his wife, but you seriously should respect his relationship with her and possibly even tell the wife what happened if you want to be a good person here. Nobody likes girls who hit on other girl's guys|`|l344RtC8aa	He's married.. there's nothing you can do|`|Kl9zdMfpaa	What do you mean professional? What does he do?|`|VygBNA0Waa	leave him alone  he wont return your emails because he was in the heat of the night and went with it   now he realized he shouldn't have done that   he doesn't want to be tempted so that's why he is not emailing|`|IN1wPKwoaa	he is married leave him alone. do you want to be known as a family breaker or as "that **** that slept with my husband"|`|XRD7qfg7aa	he is trash for doing that. and he aint gonna return your emails until he wants some more.  and you do NOT want be the "other" woaman. thats lowwww.|`|AA11922229	Take the hint. He wants a boom bam thank you Mame, because you were there. Email is a  threat to his marriage and now he's thinking about the risk.    Women are always playing the relationship game which includes imaginary commitment , etc.  and men are hunters of trophy thrills, a notch on his weapon, no future.    Why would this guy settle with one when he has droves of women throwing themselves at him?    Good news: There are decent and honorable men who have a conscience.|`|AA11298074	HE'S MARRIED......WTF do you think you do?  honestly|`|GwA7m9Fdaa	Sounds like someones in trouble with the wife (Him)...maybe she found out...|`|StX8xylaaa	end your relationship if hes married. it may hurt but it will hurt worse other wise|`|29ddeea7f871392bf7b17a12fc77a694aa	leave it be or your going to be killed by his wife. seriously i got myself into something like this but didnt know she was married until i got shot by the husband.....|`|kI36WRdoaa	he is married? wow. i despise woman and men like you and him. how would you feel if you were married and your husband cheated on you. and then you dont even say you feel sorry you say that you dont want that to be the end of your relationship. you are disgusting!|`|hNvILDqLaa	if i was you i would leave him alone  there might be a reason he is not calling you back and its not a relationship its cheating|`|7LjzmNzRaa	what the f*ck wrong with you how can you do stuff with a married man, you have no idea how his wife would feel if she found out,,,, he probally doesnt want to talk to you cuz the guilt is kicking in i think you should move on before more stuff happens|`|AuCpRJajaa	Jesus is watching. if its meant ot be then wait for his marriage to fail but dont' make it because of you. so 4 nwo stay away. he had a weak moment he probably would have kissed anything. thats mean but dang hes married!|`|AA12240972	You hung out once, you know he's married and you sound like an immature homewrecker.|`|JGxemN3waa	How would you feel if you found out that your husband was seeing another woman?    How would you feel if your father was seeing making out with someone who wasn't your mother?    How would you feel if his wife found out and came and keyed your car or even worse tried to hurt you physically?    You shouldn't **** where you eat, meaning you shouldn't ever date someone from where you work ... it might end up costing one or both of you your jobs.    Relationships are all about Karma ... if you know he's married (Hot or not) you should leave that alone.|`|VnEdwLNvaa	i don't think moving out with a married man is the best thing you can do to yourself this time, i think that at this stage you should be running away from temptation instead of falling into it no matter how bad you want this man. pretend it never happened. and as you make futher decisions put yourself in  the wifes shoes and know how you will feel if you were to be in her shoes and the wrekage this will bring to her family.|`|qh1NHD4Oaa	It was probably just sex nothing else.I once was with a married man for a while until i realized it wasn't going anywhere it was just good sex.Forget about a relationship with him.If you want more of where that came from dragt him into somewhere private at work and get it on there!
xBRt1Wvuaa	Arguing should make your relationship stronger.  I guess it's because you two have been together for a long time.  Try talking to him if you don't feel comfortable, I'm the exact same way!  Like you said; you miss him and you can't live without him. That's love!  Your gonna get in arguments because you guys love each other im guessing...but just take the time to talk to him and let him know how you feel(:|`|gsds3lmraa	Sort out the arguments ASAP. My boyfriend/ex have been together for over 3 years and we're still fighting.   You don't want to be in a position where you can't even pin point your problems and why you're arguing because everything has just escalated.     Hit the nail on the head now and talk about why he has upset you and vice versa|`|bSUipR3uaa	cause you two are not compatible. You two have bad communication.|`|tG1vTi0Daa	It sounds like a trust issue. You didnt say what u guys fight about, but if hes throwing accusations out at u, hes guilty of something, or is talking to another gurl. Or it could be the other way around.|`|AA12226240	this is an unhealthy relationship....|`|g1CsXtupaa	Some relationships say intact by fighting, even though it is mostly friendships that are that way, because in the case that one or more persons likes the other person romantically, he/she will be wanting to get to know more about that person, and fighting usually gets them to reveal information.    But that's just one possibility, and not a likely one, seeing how long you two have been going out. So maybe you two should accept that you fight because you are different, but that you do have things in common, too, of course, and telling him that might help. Also, try to avoid arguments by not defending yourself or whatever the matter is, unless it REALLY bothers you, and if it does, I think he needs to know that.    People fight because they think something is not right (in general) or that something is not the way they want it. So maybe you two should have a talk about your constant fighting and reach a compromise that involves you two trying to avoid fighting each other and/or saying mean things to each other.    Good luck, and I hope this helps.
mRQ6D0Ipaa	it does count|`|0XvImpdFaa	it counts|`|0WfsZ7lCaa	idk good question. i think so wen u get the answer pease tel me|`|XdqvvLaiaa	Yes it does count as your first real kiss :)|`|f2XdVMD1aa	I guess so. Unless it was in elementary school or something like that.|`|29ddeea7f871392bf7b17a12fc77a694aa	yes that does, that is almost everyones first kiss|`|Gx14PIvxaa	I say any lip contact counts! (but not like with your mom or a relative of course. =))|`|3L4fPlpmaa	yeah, i think so. my friend was talking about her first kiss the other day...|`|sHL72T1jaa	i don't know depends how you think i mean my frist kiss was a peck so i guess it counts hope this helps.|`|6TVl5nTBaa	it counts as your first kiss, but not your first REAL kiss. A real kiss is when there is passion between the two and its enjoyable. Usually a first kiss is weird and wet. LOL!
6pUzzsuhaa	there's no facts to back up that comment.   people can still get fat from eating just veggies, and vegans/vegetarians are on average not as healthy as people who eat meat too. meat provides many nutrients that plants (like beans) can't provide.     PETA doesn't do their research before saying stuff like that. People who eat meat are healthier than people who eat all veggies because meat provides protein that you can't get just from eating veggies. and actually there are more aphrodisiacs that are from animals (like oysters are said to be one).     This may get off the subject, but just a little.. it shows you how wrong PETA is- I'm taking ag classes and I've been involved with ag. for a good while (my boyfriend is a farmer and he's taught me a lot in the past 2+ years). But, they say that milking cows is inhumane because the cow has to get pregnant as soon as she has weened her calf. That's wrong because dairy cows don't need to get pregnant every time she's in season, and when the dairy cow is pregnant, she's given a 'vacation' to raise the calf. And also they say clipping the 'needle' part off of a baby pig's teeth is inhumane, its not because their teeth are like needles and they can puncture the sow's teets when they are nursing. (sorry if that did get off topic, just telling you what is actually true when they say its "awful")|`|pKzH1cFHaa	P.E.T.A says a lot of things that just don't make sense. If they would look closely at their teeth, they could see that we are meant to eat meat. Lean meat is healthy for you and even the occasional fatty meats are okay. Tell P.E.T.A that veggies scream, though we may not hear it. I remember a couple of years ago, my sister tried to get animal rights on me and until she stopped, everytime she ate greens, I yelled "OW! OW! Veggies have feelings too! OW!" She eventually stopped and accepted that myself, nor our family was going to change. Also, ask P.E.T.A about lions, and tigers, and other meat eating animals. They have never given me a good answer to them. If meat is there, I am going to eat it. It's food, it is good for you, and it is on the food pyramid.|`|6846a3395d16d18b95b001a1bda626a1aa	Peta is fat, sick and boring in bed and it is not from eating meat.
eDwj6ASGaa	In my experience, wanting to stay friends with an x is more of a desire to hang on to what you had rather than a desire for a friendship. I feel like a friendship after a serious relationship is just a way to keep it a possibility.    I also think that this could really hurt your future girlfriend. No matter what , she will see you two together, not you two as friends, which will be very damaging to your relationship.    Is it possible? Probably. But I don't think it's productive. I think it will do more damage than it will good.|`|0F8hauikaa	It is possible. It just depends on the people and circumstances involved, but consider that even if the two of you can handle it, new love interests may not approve.|`|8vfCRg7Caa	lol, this is funny because its not up to you, its up the woman. Most of my exs still talk to me but once i move on i cant be with them or be friends. its nice they call but still you have to just move on. Warning! being friends leads to sex. So when im another relationship with somebody i dont spend much time trying to be friends with my ex. you move on you move on. And be confident about it. If you want friends, go meet some. And if shes got somebody else. good luck with that.  Men are selfish, and her boyfriend wont like you being around. i could see if this is your ex wife, and you have kids but not your ex girlfriend.|`|bTz6v43Kaa	NO
brzaR6f9aa	maybe you dont want one because you are scared to get hurt or hurt someone else. your in the 8th grade, a boy does not matter. your friends probally just like to gossip. stop caring that they bring up the subject and ignore when they do. they will get the hint and back off, soon or later. if you dont want a guy around, then you dont have to have one. turn the tables on them...|`|Za7RV4Kqaa	u have 2 be confident in yourself. it took me a long to be confident. if i wasn't confident, i wouldn't be where i am today. please follow my advice. peace out.|`|s4psKJrPaa	its okay, dont be. just ignore them if you have already explained how u feell, if u havent you should. if yur not ready, yu shudnt b forced :)    mine? http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...|`|xgJbxZgfaa	nahh don't have any boyfriends 'til high school, it's way more fun! don't listen to your friends on this one... just be friends with him, and there's no hard feelings. =)    p.s. - never do anything you don't want to.|`|KDyG2vCoaa	why would you like someone and not want them as a bf....|`|uA3yUdCzaa	just tell them that eighth grade dating isn't really even dating... its not the same if your parents or older sibling has to drive you places... and make sure they know how you feel about the whole situation... if you don't tell them in a firm way they won't take you seriously... good luck|`|rev4lrn0aa	You're young, if you don't want a boyfriend that's your busines. Maybe take up a sport or club and just tell them you are too busy for a boyfriend. Trust me, you should enjoy your freedom while your young. Don't let your friends pressure you into doing something you don't want to do. Good luck, sweetie!|`|1xHbgqB5aa	Well now you really should let the people have such an effect on you. I can perfectly understand that you simply don't want a boyfriend. I think that now you should try and explain that to them. If you think you'd have a hard time doing that, you can always say that you just don't like him anymore and that would be the end of it. But I really think that you should try to make them realize just how you feel. They are your friends after all and you should really be able to have such a conversation with them.   And as a final possibility, why don't you just ask the guy out. What bad could possibly happen? If you just start to hang out, nothing bad could come out of that. If he doesn't want a relationship, it will be the beginning of a new friendship. If he does want a relationship and cares for you, I'm sure he'll understand your wishes. Also when you're with him, you just might that you actually want a relationship with him because he's nice or something.  Whatever you decide, just know that there really isn't a wrong way, and that you can't make a mistake. Make full use of this fact when considering your actions. And I would also advise that you do no think too much, it's just not a thing you should worry a lot about. Be light-hearted and keep being positive :D  Good luck.. ;)|`|9uI3hvGdaa	tell your friends to mind their own business.|`|hNvILDqLaa	tell them to shut the ***** up|`|3L4fPlpmaa	tell your friends to back off because you don't really want a bf right now.|`|66vTDmLvaa	do whatever makes you feel good  dont get pressured into doing something that you dont want to do. Maybe tell the guy that you like him and if he likes you you can tell him that you dont want a relationship|`|o5v3N5FXaa	dude i in 8 grade 2 and i dont want a bf either just say im an independant women and why stick to one fish when u can have the whole pond??! or it may be that ur not ready for a bf. when u want one you'll be ready
cP9MoCc6aa	sweetie, really, you will never forget your first love.  it will hurt a while, yes, but you will get over it in a way it wont hurt anymore.  but you will never forget your first love.  But to not think about it, just lay off dating for a while. If you go out with another guy to make the feelings of the other guy go away (which won't work) then things might end badly and your heart might be broken even more.   Don't try to hard to get it out of your head like dating another guy for that reason.   You will eventually crush on another guy, then you wont forget, but you will get over your first in a way you will look back at the happy memories you had together. :D|`|29ddeea7f871392bf7b17a12fc77a694aa	find someone else, seriously thats the only way.... i still hurt cause of my first love|`|cHdTW6oeaa	It just takes time. How much time? I can't tell you that because it is different for everyone.|`|4bfab3b7044f46fe59c4e4deaffa3724aa	its really hard. my first love broke my heart too and it was hard. but he made me something a heart he welded it and i never could get the strengh to get ride of it. i will keep it forever. you will always remeber your first love. he will always be in your heart.|`|XdqvvLaiaa	You cant :(    Just meet new guys! You'll feel good again!|`|3OT8Lmrgaa	Go date all of his friends and you will eventually smile again, in the meantime....Just go have some fun, it will take your mind off of him.|`|eb215043bc75160cbf1c1380fe74d936aa	You will find another one.  Just remember that this is a learning experience and that everything you get from that person is to benefit yourself.|`|AA12164378	You should try talking to your friends or take up a hobby that will take your mind off of things (I suggest running). Do NOT keep calling/texting and asking why it didn't work. If you really need to you can ask once but no more and then maybe you should distance yourself a bit and just try to move on. Get rid of all the things he gave, eat ice cream etc. Whatever works for you. I sincerely hope you feel better soon|`|QY4r7ScNaa	wow..  well its going to be hard.   i would say give yourself a week to mope..   but you have to get back up and get out there again.  maybe try a new hobby to help forget.   i dont mean forget everything and "him" but just the pain.   hang out with your friends. get your mind off of things.  just keep in mind that one day your going to find a guy that wont break your heart. and if that guy does he'll surely fix it and be with you forever.|`|HjgeyVpiaa	the answer is you dont......youll always love them|`|ZXu2AqBnaa	i wish i knew. im still holding on to him even though i know hes not good for me.    i keep praying he'll want me.    let me know when you find out|`|woGVUT1maa	Simple, find someone new. Explore new options. Life goes on I'm afriad.|`|wMunBQ9Oaa	You get over your first love by getting under your second love.  Can I be your second love?|`|D6nu55wlaa	15 years later i still think about mine... so i guess in a way you don't.|`|RBGc1Hytaa	Time heals all wounds so they say...but not always. Give it time, you might always think about him/her but over time it will start to hurt less.|`|8P6MmLv0aa	The fist time I got my heart broken was when I was 16 and I was really bad for weeks but you do get over it but you will never forget it I have fallen twice since then. Its not something I do often but when I do its wow!. any way mate take care.|`|fZjBVUE2aa	you never do.  you will always remember them.    but you will fall in love again.  & im not going to say you wont get your heart broken again.  cause you probably will.    but just go out with other guys.  have fun.  keep your ex off your mind.  & after a while you wont even think about him.
hatccbJ1aa	You should not stop if this is true love. But you should talk to her parents or run away with her like Romeo and Juliet.|`|KEWbsDTIaa	The right thing to do is stop trying because she obviously can't leave him and if its arranged than she can't go marry anyone else without going against her family. It's also very disrespectful to her husband and would hurt him if he knew about you. But on the other side if you both love each other than it's going to be a little hard to just drop each other like that. It's not really seflish on her part to want to be with you though. I mean with a fixed marriage the woman didn't exactly get to pick her partner therefor she can't help that she doesn't return the love for him but at the same time that's her culture or part of her religion so it's wrong. You two really need to discuss it. If there's a way for her to get out of the marriage than maybe pursue it but if she can't than you need to drop it because you would be causing stress and hurt for all 3 of you for no reason.|`|bvwYVGJOaa	This is such a difficult position this girl is in but there are laws in these things so if its up to the girl she would call up the commisions of her country for example Pakistan High Commision and they usually have helplines (dont quote me on it) i Think they do but im not really sure.I know they are helplines number around the corner and and they can bring her out of the country and return where she came from and live in a shelter to be safe from family.     I'd saying do something like Google forced marriages or find some helpines numbers and speak to them or somethng and take actions. Personally i dont know if the girl will do it or not because its all about the honour and tradition, so its a risky business for her, if she's in love with you she will be ready to do something.     Right now, i dont think shes in a postion to do anything or planned anything as of yet but thinking of it. I'm a libreal-muslim and i totally believe in arrange marriage and if the person doesnt like him/her then you can say No.   and love marriages as well..|`|29ddeea7f871392bf7b17a12fc77a694aa	there are laws against that, dont stop trying just talk to her about it and maybe she will marry you and still be able to stay|`|WztCveoqaa	deff keep trying! if you really love her then leave with her!!!!|`|AGheglgxaa	Well if she's really down for you then she'll tell her cousin that they could never be...It was a huge favor but her heart is elsewhere..I mean it does jeporadize him sayin ok divorce den go back where you came from..Butttt if you love her dat much den mayb you should marry her?? Idk what you think about marriage but just think of your life like a movie make a move thats gonna please you in the end.
5M3UHOQSaa	oh, well...you could join his list I guess. Say hi, don't just smile.|`|BILIAKSOaa	Since you guys hang out in the summer and smile in the halls it shouldn't be that weird to talk to him. Text him and invite him over with a couple other friends to hang in the snow (if it snows where you live) or go see a movie. If your kinda nervous invite friends. First, start to text him. Then after a couple of days invite him. (:|`|FUQ0sJNaaa	He's too old for you! What would you even talk to the guy about, cartoons?|`|BzyIf78Kaa	kso,  i'm pretty much in the same position as you.  what i do is i go up and start conversation,  orrrrr get his cell number or msn and talk to him .    :)|`|3rBYqlCJaa	say "heyyy cutie wat r u up 2" but only say that if u really know him cuz if u say it out of random he's gnna think ur weird okayy! lol    Best of Luckk!|`|Bl9u2e73aa	just go up to him and say hey.    or if like you're afraid to do that...    maybe have someone push you into him in the hall and you can say hey sorry about thatt.  or like something like thatt      and what ill do, its kindaa corny but it works..if you text himm or IIM him or w.e. say like so. why dont you talk to me in schoool ? =P haha  idk|`|8vfCRg7Caa	ask what time he has lunch, save him a spot at your table, introduce him to your friends. That's easy, its high school. Pretend like you are interested in swimming and do some research. Any guys dream is to find somebody interested in what hes interested in. So go on youtube, wikipedia, or google and look up some stuff. If you dont want to try that hard, then dont. But if hes a senior, swimmer and hes any good at swimming, hes probably a flock of ladies on him. But its high school, not hard to attract guys in high school. We get way more complicated later in life.|`|m88ELjmPaa	How he is doing?|`|cZX0dkkaaa	get him alone and pounce on him.    ..just kidding.    start slow with "hey" and keep smiling.   then transition to "what's up" or "how are you?"    after you've done this for a couple weeks, see if you really can get him alone in the hallway    ask him for his number and hint that you want to give him yours.|`|FzrH4I8naa	well if you know him just talk to him. Chances are he doesn't have many friends if he is from another school and is a senior unless he's good looking, then your screwed.|`|UfAozjgjaa	lol welocome to my life haha i think it wouldn't hurt to at least say hey or ask him what his favorite "stroak is" haha wait thats kinda lame lol just say hey and if he starts talking back then great! haha|`|kt7wxU37aa	I would start out by asking him how his day is going and small stuff like that, then I would find out if he liked anyone at your school and go from there.|`|AA10397687	flirt. that's what I do with the guys I like at school.

Is he hot?|`|tjsepr0daa	http://www.wikihow.com/Flirt-with-a-Guy|`|QuEU8Mh2aa	hey :)  ask him about his class or something general like that OR you could ask him about swim team or something there are alot of small talk question that you can easily slide in
AA10027242	Yes, you're being overly insecure.  He's not gonna cheat on you with somebody he already knows you're suspicious about.|`|VZPtCkweaa	i didn't read ANY of that but the title. and based on the title only, yes, i think it's ok for your boyfriend to hang out with a different girl|`|pW9KhTFvaa	relax. Even if he does like the other girl, you are off to college soon and there will be many other choices for you as far as guys go.  Your b/f will get jealous of the guys that you talk to in college as well.  Deal with the jealousy bug and see where this relationship takes you.  You don't want a little jealousy to ruin an otherwise good thing would you?|`|PdIRHRZgaa	sure y not.|`|Q5KFND17aa	jealousy is a B*TCH. it sometimes can even ruin relationships, it almost did that to a few of mine. dont let it! clearly he at least finds this girl attractive, and you have to accept that as a fact. And apparently it doesnt matter if you want him to see her or not, because it appears he's been ignoring your wishes and doing it anyway. I'd be really mad personally because he's putting another girl's and his own temptations above your feelings and that's just flat out rude. You could always give him a taste of his own medicine and start doing the same thing to a really hot guy. If this bothers him, you can either both stop or you're just going to have to deal with a relationship where you can both flirt with other people. If you dont want a relationship like that, get a new one.|`|ENCktJmtaa	your story makes a lot of sense. if i was in that position, i think i would be upset, and more offended that he continues to go behind my back. i'm not one to get too hurt by things, because i don't think it's worth it. i'd give him permission to hang out with her and make the movie ONLY if others were around (that you trust). it seems like he has a thing for her, or he's just looking to talk to someone about his problems (like you said). it's really hard for me to say since my boyfriend and i trust each other completely and have no issues if i hang out with guys or if he hangs out with girls. we just don't have that jealousy going on.|`|U1e7wJgYaa	damn girl this is not a history class don't publish your book but anyway i wouldn't allow my boyfriend to get so close to another girl and obviously he really likes this girl because he doesn't care about your feelings so if u let im go he will be gone Forever|`|XdqvvLaiaa	Nope, i wouldnt let my boyfriend hang out with another girl but than agen, the guy can lie and still hang out with her. :(    Not to make you feel confused, but if he keeps asking, maybe he likes her?

If he really does like you he would tell you when you ask.|`|srlXw2NZaa	Ask him.|`|j05XnPoYaa	ask him and tell him what your feeling ?|`|lKRHvwgJaa	depending on the guy, asking him might make him mad, since its only been like 4 months, just give it time and im sure he will say how he feels about you eventually, dont do anything embarassing or go out of your way to make him like you, just be yourself and see what happens|`|5N8ZFQdnaa	just be up front about it & ask him  cuzz some guys dont like to show that they like you  just ask him if he likes you and if its ever going to be anymore than friends
sKw5GeeMaa	yes this is a very bad situation. First of all, niether girls nor guys should ever talk about their ex's in front of their current bf/gf. And especially not compare them to you. And if she is hanging out with her hot guy friends more than she does with you, thats a bad sign. Since theyre hot, that just worsens your relationship. Comparing anyone to you means she doesnt like you for who you are. If she's saying things like "You should be more like him.", "Why dont you do that?", "I dont see you doing stuff like he does everyday." she doesnt care about what you already do do for her. My opinion: it isnt going to work.|`|L38M9lrLaa	yes its a horrible situation you can get better everyone is different and if you focus on all the similarities then theres nothing special about them..and if shes comparing you to them then shes thinking of them while shes with you..so bad situation..get out
cHdTW6oeaa	I say to throw this overzealous religious freak to the curb. Anyone that tells you how you should think is not boyfriend or spouse material. He sounds to me like he is very overbearing and I don't think by your words that you could ever be happy with this guy.    Dump him and go enjoy life.|`|69bp1IMfaa	You should GROW UP! He's obviously out of your league, probably even 32 or 33 years old. You'll never get a men like him.|`|38fe66cc26fd24d41aff94bf6ba97574aa	run run run
PtqlQ5Anaa	I date so see if it will go anywhere. Luckily in the beginning its all about the fun. And for me to break up with them... they would have to cheat, be abusive, or if we just don't click. I'm not going to stay in a relationship with someone if I'm not really that into them.
QuEU8Mh2aa	i was in this situation too :) try saying that you regret your decision and your life wasnt the way you wanted it to be. say you stillhave feelings for her and they are stronger than ever and see if she wants to give it another shot|`|Q0DfC12xaa	say i know I broke up with you but do u want to try again cuz i really like you now.that's all u gotta say it ain't hard|`|VhqxivU5aa	Just go up 2 her and tell her how you feel. Say to her that you regret making that decision and that you want to get back together again. And see if she feels the same way about you init. And if she doesnt then atleast you tried and told her how you felt. but if she feels the same way then ur srted. So just go for it mate. Find out what she thinks. Hope everything works out yeh.|`|7b1f8172d4a9ac10c23b5f3870728bb8aa	your really pretty and i love being around you, i was wondering if you wanted to go out?    your not a looser cuz you ended it. usually when you break up and still remeain excellant friends, if you go out again, you guys are that much closer|`|MSsLQuyCaa	Just tell her you like her tell her you made a mistake and you want to get back together with her.|`|OQ5ch42Aaa	Hey I like you is all you gotta tell her.|`|Xprsabo9aa	ask her out|`|CIKr28xoaa	ASK HER OUT  she liked you before, she'll like you again|`|5vbdbG9Raa	say "Hey baby, I got a surprise for you."   Drop your pants and wave your penis around for a bit.|`|4CM2lylMaa	flirt with her and try to talk to her moree. i am in the same exact situation, and my ex and i always flirt. ASK HER OUTT
iXSoX6Rnaa	Give him time. He might not be able to take all this in at once. Don't wait for him forever either. Have the baby. That alone might change what he wants. No body wants to start a family and have it fall apart before it starts. Seeing you grow with his child in you might make him realize his feelings for you and hopefully things get better. Just let them fall into place and don't force it on him. Hope I could help.|`|A7ovwP94aa	It is not worth even trying to win some one back if they do not want to come back.    What you need to do id plan your future as wil be having a baby who will be dependent on you. If you find it too hard to see him ask him to stay away until you have had the baby as it will only stress you out and won't be good for the baby.    You wil get over him but it will take time. In the meantime surround yourself with friends and family to distract you..|`|SJ5ipSvUaa	Well maybe all this talk about wedding dtuff just kind of freaked him out and hes scared of such a serious commitment so soon.  You cant really tell him he cant come around if you do keep the baby because it is his baby and he has all the right to see him/her.  Maybe once you let him go he'll realize how much he misses you and will want you back.  You don't realize what you have until it's gone, right?  Good Luck|`|VO1zmW4daa	dunno its srange
fwX34fFtaa	yeah it's called statutory rape.   even if it's consented it's still considered rape because you're underage, and legally you aren't considered mature enough to make that decision or whatever.|`|AA11433436	well, it's statutory rape just because you're underage.  you don't have the right as a minor to consent to it, so he could still be charged with it.|`|AA12359831	if your agreed to it. then you cant charge him with rape.  but he can still get in trouble. for underage. it's illegal. so just tell the school. or anyone and get help. and brake up with him. if he pushes your further. dont get pressured. just say no. who cares what he thinks.|`|XQRwQkQoaa	Yes it's rape....He's and adult and you're a child, it doesn't matter whether or not it was consented. You need to tell your parents or teacher about this and they'll know what to do.|`|LViLdW6haa	If you agreed to have sex with him then NO its not rape,. unfortunatly the judge would prolly still charge him with rape. You are responsible too and this is a very serious accusation that if you follow threw with will follow him for life and could possibly ruin his life.    My question is why would your parent allow you to see him and date him, your parents should be held responsable for not being good parents, shame on them!    You need to grow up and take responsability for your own actions. sounds to me like you wanted to but now your feeling guilty and you need to take blame for your own guild instead of tryin to blame somone else.|`|Xmdw9Ji4aa	YES! u r under 16 so in any state u are under the age of consent, hed get charged with atleast statitory rape. if u dont want 2 do it now thats ok cuz uv got 10 years to file charges. if u deccide on waiting then make sure u keep evidence or a dairy or w/e cuz it might be hard 2 prove but go talk 2 ur school couselor and theyl deal with it  ur parents wont get charged with anything
hlq3Eo0haa	sorry bout this but with most men sex will win anytime|`|69bp1IMfaa	Your just too young.|`|b7gUW0CRaa	LOL! shes the biggest whore...thats funny...XD...ok so to get him to lik u,find out wat he likes and hang out with him a lot|`|AnVcsLfSaa	flirt majorly, not obviously or embaressingly for a week or 2 maybe longer.. then play hard to get, that way he will think you like him when youre flirting then you playing hard to get will make him want you ;)|`|N2KNgB93aa	You can't force a guy to like you, but just try to let him see how much of a whore the cheerleader is. If he still likes her anyway, then this guy is NOT for you. I hope I helped.|`|LqZK6Nlfaa	ey im a freshmen boy and to tell u the truth forget about him jrs through srs all they want is sex okay get with some1 in ur  grade or atleast sophmore becuz like the guy says some but not all just want sex.....not me but my point is be your self if u want to guy to like u but if u really like him then go 4 it but be your self guys like me just once gurls to be them self
6fLxNyVpaa	yes i believe it is a form of cheating as does my husband.|`|ZpltzTIfaa	ummm no, not at all.|`|AA10377289	asa long as your doing it together and having fun at the same time its not cheating.|`|I71ePk4Haa	I don't consider it cheating...I'm rather my husband did that, then the obvious alternative. I think the whole key is moderation. As long as it actually doesn't have a negative affect on your sex lives.|`|O2xwMwHYaa	we watch it together and really enjoy it. i know my husband looks at some when he needs to help himself but i dont consider it cheating. i would rather he use it to enjoy than drive him into the arms of another woman. if a man was lusting after a specific porn star then maybe there is an issue, but still not cheating...|`|5NKa5Y8laa	I believe its ok for singles to watch, they can do what they like.    But in a marriage, if one partner does not like it, the porn addict partner needs to decide whats more important. Some random porn sl*t.. or their spouse.  If they continue to do it regardless of their partners feelings (or if they dont even admit it, and lie about it), then yes, I believe its a form of cheating.|`|dcb024b5e2b5c65f694bdddd3199db68aa	According to your rational you should not watch TV or go to the movies either.  Wouldn't they also give off wrong perception of life is really like.|`|kaq32uJ2aa	That's an "iffy" situation- You watched porn once before- you know what it is- It is just a tool to "get off"- it doesn't mean that you wish to live with that person.  You should watch some porn by yourself one time and let him walk in on you- He might think the same way you did when you walked in on him. He will know how you really felt.   I'm telling you right now- If there is not 100% honesty then it will not work. You have to be 100% honest with yourself before you can be honest with your partner.  Do not get married until you get this worked out!|`|aOinzEvYaa	I think you two made a good decision|`|3m8JgWj1aa	as long as it isn't an everyday thing then in my opinion it is not cheating. sometimes people just need the extra umph to reach that point and if you are watching it together then it is just a stimulus, just as long as it doesnt become an addiction then it is fine|`|e7f7b9508f28f00c8e34cd692587ca8caa	It is a form of cheating I believe.|`|AA11969451	My husband and I both enjoy it and watch it together . I do not consider it a form of cheating.|`|gjaPNWbTaa	My husband and I like porn, but it's fine if you don't.    Out of curiosity... does "we" decided really mean "you" decided, and he just stopped arguing with you?    EDIT, ok....    I predict great trouble down the road for you on this topic.  Mark my words.
X6HUimEFaa	Go to a quiet place and just read or go on the internet...something peaceful to get your mine off them  hope I helped =)
jlZZbdIjaa	Maybe there's something going on with him and he doesn't feel like talking.|`|F3VPADcRaa	well if he really wanted to date you than he would not stop talking to you and start talking again. he would of asked you out by now. it sounds to me like he isn't really into you, either that or he just wanted to get into your pants.|`|0sPQnq7oaa	Sorry.  He's not into you enough to date you.  Don't wait around for him.   If a girl came along that he was really into, I'm betting he'd ask her out without even thinking of you.   Guys are really big pu$$ies.  They cant be straight up, and theyre scared.|`|f2711d8349aeed648c50f146c4496e35aa	Maybe he's not sure if he should ask you out yet... Just let it see where all this goes....
y9CgveCGaa	Changes in habits.  More sex or less sex.  Changes in her attitude toward you.  She could seem colder or friendlier.|`|IbJ2O0vpaa	DNA testing of the semen stain on the blue dress doesn't match.|`|af644b7256e7bf5a53974bb99a32d482aa	Loses weight or starts working out, buys new clothes (especially lingerie), is often late or "missing", hides her phone and e-mails, comes home freshly showered, wants more OR less sex, has new sex tricks, ignores you.    These are the signs I have read about, I am NOT the cheating type.|`|52092e43afb48f25c3b2832d7f29ae10aa	She's happier.....|`|3gXQPso5aa	if she no longer want to have sex, is always gone, does not talk to you much, locks her phone, hangs up when you come in, if she does not care when you do or say things to piss her off, if she say's if you don't treat me right someone else can do better|`|EENUWAP7aa	Probably the best way to answer this question is when you notice a change in the sexual relation you have with her.    In other words if your at work and she's off and has had an affair while you were working and then you get home and want to have sex with your wife you should be able to tell the difference.|`|an1EMiFkaa	When she smells good all the time  When she is smiling all the time  When she has a far off look on her face all the time  When she is happy  When she gives alot of one word answers  When she is exercising and keeping fit|`|yIGVOqXdaa	I am not the cheating type but follow your gut. Noticed anything different lately about her actions? most times the answer is right infront of your face but we often tend to ignore the flags. All the best!|`|MHwn4Tlzaa	when you go down on her and their is someone else's spunk in there.|`|AA10876923	Keep your eyes open.  It should be evident by her actions, and how she generally treats you.  If you're having problems within your marriage, and she appears to be not interested in you, or is often out and about, prefers NOT being home.......One usually knows when their mate loses interest.  Since you're asking, you may be seeing the signs of something is wrong.  Usually good communication may also tell you something.  Perhaps she's NOT cheating.  Do you have any reason to disbelieve her?|`|qUbv1ln4aa	Cell Phone: She always deletes everything from the memory wont let you see it or walks away from you when it rings or a text comes through.    Computer: its harder to track but the best way is to down load a program called I Am Big Brother it tracks and captures Everything Keystrokes and all Passwords plus does screen Captures.    Excuses for everything and try to go do things with her and she doesn't want you to go with her she claims to need some alone time which is la git most of the time but if it is all the time than something is up.    Search her dresser drawers or other possible hiding places for notes or other items.    Hope this helps catch her cheating butt|`|iD4ejChZaa	when you enter the room, she walks out,|`|dTaGzh6Haa	She won't care if you're there or not...preferably not. Won't argue or care if you want to go out with the boys. She will have a glow about her.   Has she ever told you her needs weren't being met? Are you taking her for granted? Let's get real honest now. Are you showing more interest in work, sports, etc. than you are in her? Do you take time in bed to please her or just get your job done and go to sleep? Do you blow her off when she wants to talk? How often do you tell her and show her how much you care for her? If any one of these things are going on, you may have a huge problem on your hands. And the longer you leave your treasure unattended the more danger there is in its' disappearing.|`|0d0W0nbVaa	has it ever occurred to you that when she's with you, she's cheating on the other guy?|`|AA12127714	if you feel she is she probably is...time will tell|`|V9FcPtM1aa	Same as it would be for a man. Change in behavior, change of routines, unaccounted for money, mysterious phone calls, working"extra hours", more nights out with friends, etc|`|jmtbtVYsaa	I've been in this situation.  Small signs such as where is her cell phone?  Does she tend to go to places on her own that rather than have you around?  Does she speak to you where sex is not important anymore and would rather be friends?  How does she feel about you?  Have you confronted to her about her own feelings about your relationship.  You both need to sit down and discuss.|`|z5k0ZTt6aa	When she comes home, she goes straight for the shower... just from what I've heard.
q0A4enABaa	WHOA!!!! You need to sit your MOTHER down and let her know that you are NOT comfortable calling her "new" husband "Dad". He is NOT your real father. Next if you have another way to get home from school take it as long as it is a trusted ride or walk. Taking you out? Where to? Is it for dinner, ice cream, movies, where? If you are not comfortable then say hey man I have to much to do this evening and I MUST get my homework done. Asking about your period is WAY OFF BASE for any respectable father. That is VERY personal and you should let your mother know. If she won't believe you arm yourself with a hidden micro tape recorder and be prepared to play it for mommy dearest. Where is your real father? If he is involved in your life let your REAL dad know whats going on with this guy.. This is creepy and borders the acts of a pedophile.|`|lKVQ6OXYaa	its a bit strange for him to ask about your periods...even a real dad would not ask such questions...and then the arm around u part....its a bit strange too...doesnt seem appropriate...pls tell your mom about this...if your mom doesnt listen or believe u...then tell your guidance councelor or someone grownup and trustworthy...if you are getting a sexual or weired vibe from him..then hurry up...dont wait too long...and dont put up with any nonsense...too many times this sort of thing has happened and turned out to be a horror....so be smart...and brave...but also think clearly and sont be motivated by emotion alone....make sure u are not imagining this or that u are not reacting out of anger for him....anyway...u know best...trust your instinct...    but if he is only trying to be friendly and know u a little better...then tell him that u are not ready and to allow it to take its natural course and to give it some time...  good luck|`|OjXvYEZDaa	talk to your mum and tell her about him asking you sort of personally questions.

Make it about your feelings so she won't feel she has to take sides, but can help him change his behavior. His behavior really isn't appropriate.|`|zFb022Iiaa	Tell him you need personal space and you don't like to be touched, even if it's just him, he'll never know.  Also if you have to just tell mom you are not used that and you don't like it.  Tell her your sure he means well (so she won't get defensive) but that he needs to back off because he makes you uncomfortable.|`|aXqi9lYJaa	Honestly, I would be blunt.     And say "Ok, I understand that you're trying to be a 'dad' to me, but you aren't. You can't replace my real dad, so stop trying to. I like how you love my mom and all and make her happy, but just...let's be friends, not father and daughter, and refuse to call him dad, and just don't answer his weird questions.|`|wd0NmW0saa	You need to talk to your mom and tell her what's going on...|`|T2isnQNKaa	run away|`|afkygHMgaa	Privacy? This is sexual misconduct and an attempt on his part to sexually abuse. Tell your mother or guidance counselor immediately!|`|AbCeEZIhaa	Just be honest with him or your mom so she can talk to him. I do not think he is being pervy or anything, he is just trying too hard.|`|AA12081834	That's really unfair for both of them to sit down and tell you to call him "dad", and the other things are a little too personal I think to be discussing with him...that is a little creepy. I don't know maybe you should try discussing your comfort or lack of with your mother.|`|TJiGs8S4aa	Tell him to back off and give you a lot more privacy.  Ick.  Tell him you don't feel comfortable telling him the things he's asking, and it is none of his business.  Don't call him by his first name if they object- call him Mr. ___.  But don't call him dad if you don't want to.|`|AA10148924	What you are going through is so normal. Tell him in a nice way. If you are close enough to your mother, talk to her about it.|`|AA11348136	This is definitely a sign of sexual misconduct. He has no freakin business asking you about your time of the month and he doesn't need to be asking you about  your personal life. I would suggest that you talk to your mom about it and make sure that you tell her this is how you feel. Another thing, how long has she dated this guy before they got married, you don't just start calling some man daddy just because your mom married him, that is something that he has to earn and he has already started on the wrong foot. I would even go as far as to say after you talk to your mom and it doesn't change, involve your real father if he is around or a male figure that you can trust because there is no telling what this creep is up to.|`|W7dO6uoJaa	hes just trying to get u to no him better and to form a relationship try to play it nice and if it doesnt work then talk to your mom about him|`|xZSRDNVOaa	dont answer him, dont smile at him and tell your mom|`|g5KaAFIQaa	Just tell him you know he is just trying to be a dad and probably doesn't know what to do but you just kinda need a little bit of space and some topics you just don't feel comfortable talking about with him, and have your mom there too|`|QFa7dbHSaa	Straight up tell tht creepy mother ******...tell him hey i appreciate u being nice but im not comfortable spending all thistime with u|`|2k6lvvfJaa	tell him to check out this site...all fathers shud,    http://cbize.net/upload/document/pa%20Ch...    put urself in his shoes for a minute,feels different dont it?he is bigger|`|JxTpCkizaa	be like u dont need 2 know bout my period. and just tell tell him to back off. like those real words.|`|b1b6e3d33b1a99da35a245dd5c6cae76aa	Okay just tell him or you mom.    It's allways easier to tell you mom things...Especially in your situation. Uhmm i would tell you mom that your stepdad is giving you the creeps.     Just tell them and hopefully he will kinda back off,    Good luck|`|hFqFlguhaa	DON'T TRUST HIM.  Stay away from him as much as possible. Sounds like he's on the make. Then please tell your mother, what you're telling us. She should be able to set him straight!  Good luck you poor girl.|`|cb5cb44a2fed0fb2497e1f4a938b8bffaa	That's a  tough one. It seems that he wants to be a part of your life since he is a part of your mothers.   I would say the best way to do it is to either tell him that you aren't ready to open up completely and that you would like to ask him to give you a little more privacy until you are more comfortable with the new situation.   If you can't get up the courage to do it yourself then your mom to talk to him about it. She should understand. This is a new situation for you and they have to understand that and respect that. Oh and please tell your mom about the period thing unless you were being bitchy and he said it as a joke then that's a little creepy.|`|0sPQnq7oaa	Uh I think you should tell your mother that your 40 something STEP FATHER Is asking you SEXUAL QUESTIONS about when you are bleeding out of your vagina. And tell her that it is NOT normal. What the ****?|`|KImie8Pnaa	The previous poster is right, just tell him to back off. Do you have a father you can go stay with? Tell your mother what is going on too. Don't let anyone make you feel bad about this. This is your mothers fault for exposing you to this. There is no excuse for him asking you when your periods are. That whole thing scares the tar out of me and if she does not throw him out, I would go to your school social worker. This guy is a creep. lock your bedroom door and stay away from him. I hope you go to your fathers.|`|pc1EKWSuaa	- tell ur mom   - just hit him when he does that  - don't show ur face 2 him  - don't live with them go 2 a cozin house or a Friend or whatever              if i were u i will tell my MOM.....|`|z08jBhoqaa	ummm... You need to say " Hey, you just married my mom and I really don't think that my life right now is any of your business. I think its been kinda weird so far." And continue like that giving more detail abou the situation.     And talk to your mom about the problem. She can help|`|92e818bcae7097900ffbbb79e6f1f1b3aa	Yeah, the period thing is way too personal.  Most girls won't discuss that with their real fathers, much less a new step-father.  He is being weird.  Next time he gets too close tell him he's making you uncomfortable and that it's unnatural and awkward for you.      And if he ever, EVER tries anything sexual with you, don't listen to anything he says and call the police immediately!|`|hFNpkFyUaa	TELL YOUR MOM that is serious and o so creepy he could be dangerous did anyone think to check the system b4 i do was said?|`|kxfcrdRFaa	Just be honest about how you feel and state your feelings respectfully but truthfully.|`|56d05b1317a6841b60c715f8bcf5ac8caa	Well you should TELL YOUR MOM if you are uncomfortable that is for sure!!! statistically speaking it is those that are closest to us that usually molest, however you need to be sure that you are not being overly critical cause you dislike him and wish your mom had not married him.   I think if you were being attitudy and he said are you on your period then that is one thing but if he said hey so and so are you on your period just out of the blue then that is entirely different.  Good luck to you and be careful :)
zvW5rBIZaa	look at the mirror  You have some bird poop on your hair|`|AXoEgmnSaa	Talk to her about the class, and ask her if she would like to study with you some time. This would be a great excuse to ask her for her phone number incase you need help or to ask her what the homework was, and after a while ask her out.

I don't know what else to tell you.    Don't talk to him anymore, be the girl with her dignity and self-respect in tact.    Move on.    Good Luck|`|ycNxVrUfaa	What you did was human. The sign of real intelligence is when you learn from your mistakes. None of us have lived without making them. Cut yourself some slack and consider if you really want a guy who treated you as though you were disposable.|`|a6u962bpaa	It sounds like you made a mistake. You took back a douchebag who sheated on you. But it also sounds like you know you made a mistake and you're regretting it.    It's alright. Really. Lots of girls do the same as you in that kind of situation. I wouldn't say it makes you a slag or a ****. I'd think a slag or a **** sleeps with anyone who makes a move. That doesn't sound like you.    Get over him. He was an asshole anyway.|`|BjtqWNt8aa	He wants you for sex only. Move on. Stay away from him. Be  careful who you date that may know him because the rumors about sex with you or anyone he has been with, will be rampant.|`|mewFgxtwaa	You're human, what you did was normal. He sounds like a jerk that's using you still, I would def stop talking to him totally.
xZSRDNVOaa	wow. tell him that he can get and deserves someone much better than her|`|OyjRhwPXaa	tell him to man up and kick the **** out of the benefits boy and be a total asshole to the charity whore that he was with. and i mean make her feel like ****|`|t9rTToWYaa	Tell your friend that he deserves much better than her.  :)
B3napPyKaa	Thats cute but i would definitely talk to your friend about it before hand. I mean he is your best friend and would you want to lose him over some girl? I mean dont get me wrong, that could be the case, but is she worth it? If you are friends with her then it should be relatively easy to ask her out, but if you are not, then i would not rush things. Who knows, she might say no to your friend? Or even if they do go out, love does not last forever in the case of 8th grade.    best of luck.
u5yzxdPWaa	Are boys genuine when drunk - Not often, and even if they are being genuine, they should have the guts to say what they did when sober as well as drunk. But it's not always that black and white either, particularly as his behaviour suggests he may really like you. The fact is you don't know this guy, so you can't tell for sure if he's one of those shy people who might be too embarrassed to talk to you when sober. And it may be he can't ask his sis for your number anymore than you can ask her. It's a very hard situation, especially as your friend is probably feeling really off about it. If you feel she wouldn't like you asking for his number, I'd probably let it go and try to stop thinking about it. If he finds a way to contact you, then all the better, as you'll know he does really like you.|`|nO2vflnPaa	No idea. But does anyone know if eating a boiled egg would make a fart stink worse than not eating one? And why do farts smell worse when exspelled in the bath tub?|`|eTxk4lSxaa	Wow this is my 20's all over again. From what I've read, yes he likes you but he's just not that into you. The evening was sweet and physically affectionate but that's as far as he's taking it for a number of reasons including the fact that you are his sister's friend and may not want to risk harming you. As for the memories of the night, remember your judgment was impaired also (the drink) and the loss of inhibitions combined with the powerful aphrodisiac of open affection (which all women crave) can create a feeling of more intimacy than was actually there.  As much as it hurts, play it smart and wait for him to make a move - it's not like you disappeared never to be seen again.|`|8vfCRg7Caa	lol now you know how guys feel.|`|jpAzVmG0aa	That stuff is VERY adorable, I liked reading it. Anyway, I think he does really like you. If he didn't, why would he stay with you the whole time? He kissed and cuddled with you and he seemed like he really cared for you too.    I think you should just try to visit your friend and see him again that way, then hopefully get his number. Maybe he didn't call you because he was nervous about it too? You never know, don't give up and just give it a shot.|`|VMAhim63aa	if he does like you then don't expect him to ask his sister for your number THAT WOULD BE WEIRD, especially if hes older than you it would be really awqwerd for him. try to talk to him about it.|`|3JfADTIDaa	i'M SORRY ABOUT THE LENGTH AS WELL|`|lV4pHs1saa	i think that it could have been the beer so u might want to ask him when he  not drunk|`|Tc1BO5kkaa	aww that sound like edward from twilight!! but idk if what people say when they are drunk can be trusted, because im not 21 yet :)|`|CcYpcSb1aa	people are more honest and straight forward when drunk. when youre sober is when youre wearing a mask.    talk to him about it.    if he honestly like you, you will know.  if hes just after sex, he will push for physical contact.  if he is just an amorous drunk, he will make that known as well    girls need to stop over complicating things.|`|mewFgxtwaa	It really could go either way. There are a lot of guys that will do anything for some action and then there are the sincere ones...there's really no way to tell unless you guys get together and talk it out when you are both sober.|`|zKEVdGv2aa	A lot of people act like this when they need some attention or might be stressed and/or drunk. This is especially true when the acts are towards a former acquaintance or friend, because they feel more comfortable that way. I doubt he was interested in anything serious, and if he really likes you he will come back. I wouldn't worry too much over him and just be glad he didn't make you have drunken sex with him.|`|3qN2LC3Jaa	When I'm drunk I mostly say stupid things that I don't mean.|`|CIKr28xoaa	awwwwwwww thats so sweet...  it really depends on how drunk you are..  LOL|`|5XyBw0Vwaa	Woah...em yeah they can be genuine but mostly they just talk a load of ********=)|`|2DAA4qXXaa	sorry but he was just being a guy. thats how they are.  just enjoy the fact that you had a fun night. looking at it that way usually helps.      btw, i'm sorry about the length as well.
445676ee4ba9ef6e5bd44f0f3b9d7501aa	If you have never done something like this before, I would not recommend doing this.    Even the best of friends can become bridezillas or groomzillas when planning a wedding.  There are lots of decisions to make, and often times, the FINANCES/BUDGET is going to get in the way of what the bridal couple WANTS.  There are huge amount of details to remember and stay on top of, including working with the various vendors, bookings and paying for items, fittings and more......Unless you are very detail oriented and is going to have plenty of time to do it, I wouldn't recommend it.    It is of course an honor to be asked, because your friend thinks a lot of you.  But since you are inexperienced, why don't you suggest to your friend that you are more than happy to ASSIST someone else with the wedding planning, but you don't feel confident enough to coordinate such an important event yourself.|`|47af2fda89839c0ec02e273cff59d82daa	then consider telling them you do not feel up to the job?      cause if you dont have a clue, why would they ask you....    im totally not trying to be rude here, i am genuinly not, i just am not quite understanding why they would ask you if you dont know what to do.    if you want to try, there is LOTS to be done.  you can check out www.theknot.com.  they have kind of a timeline of what has to be or should be planned by when.  it also has a list of resources for pretty much any city you can think of so you can look at reception halls, bakerys, caterers, florists, djs, and all the other stuff....|`|eUUcriANaa	Wow that is alot of pressure. You will have alot to do. The bride picks everything you make sure it goes smoothly. Good luck|`|3ye0Pureaa	Go to http://www.brides.com/?nav=rm_googppc_na... and download the planner worksheet. It will help you with most of what you need to know. Your going to have to work with what the bride and groom want. Never think it's just up to you. Ask them if they want a theme. A theme could include just a group of colors or be based on a culture. Bigger things to look at would be a budget, locations and attire and don't for get the date and season.|`|6bec1b1d615ba504dd8ddd905700f371aa	That's a huge responsibility for someone with no experience.  Maybe tell them that you're apprehensive about taking on the task.  Are you married yourself? Have you ever taken on Project Managing an event of this size? I have and know there is a lot to consider.  Definitely not for a novice.   I'm surprised they'd even ask you to do this.  Perhaps there is a more suitable way for you to contribute to their wedding, other having a pivotal role.
7w9AM9Tnaa	omg, that's so sad. she is definitely abusing you both mentallly and physically. and yes i think you should talk to a counselor or talk to your dad, but if that doesn't work than you should probably live with your real mom; if she isn't like your step mom.|`|3e657243a606e14632ec806cc8f3adf1aa	You need to move in with your mom, this woman is evil!|`|G024yAU3aa	I came from an abusive childhood (my mother) and there is absolutely no excuse for this type of behavior from an adult to a child.  I would talk to someone at school like a guidance counselor.  You do not deserve to be treated that way and nothing that you could do is an excuse for her to treat you like that.  Your father needs to talk to her about how she treats you and be more observant, but you may need to take a step and talk to someone outside of your family.  Does your mother understand what is going on?  Why don't you live with your mother if you do not mind my asking?|`|d165180f21ae4eacacbc12db1876c2d2aa	If this is all true, then you should talk to someone at school and they will help intervene. You can start with that, a guidance councelor that you trust.    I would also film these activities so you can show them to your dad. There has to be some proof so people will believe you.    Sometimes families of divorce go through these types of challenges. You have to be smart, calm and deal with them intelligently.    Talk to people. Tell the whole truth and do not imbellish. If you imbellish, no-one will believe you ever again.|`|CKHzrI7Waa	Call the police.|`|YaB5bpv7aa	It sounds like your step mom is verbally and mentally abusing you, if your real  mom is a good parent and she will have you live with her ,go for it, your dad is too involved with his new wife to even beleive what you say to him about her. i feel sorry for you dear . talk to a school counselor alos, it may help with the probs.|`|wx4pjT1Oaa	Try to stay away from your stepmother. If she does somthing to you, call your real mom and get her to talk to your Dad. If it gets really bad, call your mom and tell her to come get you, or send a nearby relative.
ofzJMw5waa	Forget all the bad things, look at it this way,       YOUR MOTHER MADE THAT DRESS FOR YOU.      Not your ex-husband, not for your wedding, just for you. No matter the reason.      In which case, its YOUR dress, to do with as you please. Imagine the painstaking effort your mother put into that dress to make it what you dreamed of.      There's no reason not to wear it.|`|577ba10a2319b430720b5a913b74b862aa	do it!!|`|47af2fda89839c0ec02e273cff59d82daa	if your comfortable with it, then why not?    seriously, if it is an amazing dress to begin with, and you can alter it into something even MORE amazing, save yourself the money and just alter what youve got.      i mean, there are women who go out and buy dresses from goodwill to get married in.  if a woman can do that, i do not see why you cant alter one you already have|`|AA10975867	Bad karma and I seriously wonder why you would want anything to do with it! Is fashion more  important to you than the marriage? Why would you want to look at photos and see bits and pieces of your wedding dress from Man 1 ?! Yukk.... I've always believed that a "borrowed gown" also leads to a temporary marriage. Haven't been proved wrong yet.|`|OIJ3JBkSaa	if you truly love your dress and are going to make alterations to it then why not?  i know several brides who have worn their gown twice and they all have very successful second marriages!  good luck to you!|`|HiSVA9p8aa	The whole point of a wedding dress is for the bride to feel pretty and special.  If this dress does that for you, it shouldn't matter what it was last used for.    Change it or not, whatever feels OK for you.      There is no such thing as bad luck.|`|5270639c059ab08c1b3431555f150db7aa	I just wouldn't want to. Simply because you're starting anew, so new clothes are symbolic. And it would 'feel' better.|`|iD4ejChZaa	bad everything|`|0056ba0f2ca4852a4f7b389766f314d4aa	If you want to wear it, more power to you. Alter it, do whatever you want to it and good luck. Good for you for not spending more money on a new dress when you have something perfectly good to use. Way to recycle. And now you can take the money you would have used on the dress and use it for a bar at the reception, take a longer honeymoon, whatever you want.     Your first marriage failed because of the circumstances, not because of the dress. Best wishes!!|`|55zWUXcUaa	I think it would be in bad taste only because you used it for your previous marriage.  The dress doesn't have to be new just not the dress you married your ex husband in.|`|AA10351134	People are funny about these things. If it doesn't bother you and you love the dress, I'd say go for it. It's only bad karma if you think it is. Obviously a lot of love and work went into that dress, and I think you are actually showing very good taste to appreciate that.|`|caa265fc73cd7f24fe83d9a186ac1af9aa	My family is superstitious so they would tell you that it is bad luck because the marriage the dress was first used for failed.

So focus on your school work, your other interests like music, movies, other friends, and your future goals.

3YfYWpAsaa	damn that sux.... what you should do is this:    1) wait 3 days, without messaging him at all.  make it look like ur having fun in life.  what you DONT DO is put up pics of u with other guys on facebook, or make him think ur with other guys.  just act like ur fine and hangin with ur friends.     2) TELL YOUR FRIEND on the 3rd day to either message him or find him and say something like "shes been ok w/o u and shes been doin stuff, but she still really loves you and she doesnt wanna fight anymore".      3) the next day after ur friend said that, call him! and make sure that you are nice to him, but dont sound sad sound excited to talk to him, as that will make him excited too. ask him if he wants to hang out; have some ideas of "where" in mind, and ur house to watch movies and do whatever is always a good option too    4) if he says OK, which I think he will (cuz i broke up with my girl a lil bit ago and i regretted it almost the very next day! we got back together tho), then when ur at ur house, talk to him about everything. dont JUST talk about the serious stuff, talk about anything and everything.    5) guys are emotional, but we're also more physical than girls, and we get emotional bonding THROUGH physical contact and love and all that; so I would STRONGLY SUGGEST (u dont even know how strongly) that u do everything u can to touch him. DONT ACT NEEDY! BUT u should snuggle with him, hold his hand, sit close... and when the moments rite (OR just pick any damn moment he wont care), lean over and kiss him. THAT will ignite the flame RIGHT back up! start makin out, and from there you can go to 2nd, 3rd, or even home... depending on what he and you are willing to do, and depending on how far you went BEFORE.  Honestly... he's gonna like to go as far as you do, so dont worry about coming on too strong- he'll like that, and he'll want to get back with you.    6) if you haven't ever had sex with him yet... that's the problem! 17 months is an awful long time, and relationships need physical as well as emotional bonding and talking, to survive and flourish.  IF you havent... go as far as youve ever gone with him, that night wen he meets you.... and if he DOES get back with you, "bring it to the next level" ASAP.  like in a couple weeks.    7) He came by and told you about shopping because he's ALREADY regretting breaking up with you! Duh!  When you're talking to him in your house, be like "it doesnt have to be over!".  and kiss him. Alot of guys think that their girl wont wanna get back with em when the guy breaks up... often this is true, but in ur case its not obviously.  So make that point clear!    8) if he doesnt wanna hang out before you go shopping... do the steps i said (minus the taking it past the makeout part) when u go shopping with him. make it clear that youd want to go back out with him, and u dont wanna fight.    9) if you DO go back out with him, vary up when and where u hang out with him.  spend less time on the fone/chat and more in person, bcuz that is what really defines a relationship, and the time is better spent that way (we only live on earth once).... go bowling, laser tagging, ice skating, roller skating, snowboard/ski trip, day at the rec center, hiking, movies, canoeing on a lake, kayaking later wen it gets warmer if u guys are up to it, skydiving (its fun trust me but u gotta have balls), hang with friends, hang without friends, go to clubs, go drive on a road trip and stop and make out....    THE POINT is that you should always be trying to do different stuff with him, and experience different fun times with him.. dont let things get boring or repetitive, that is where fights start, out of boredom! and always find something to talk about. if ur on the fone with him and u dont have anything to talk about, just think of something. ask about the superbowl, what hes doin that weekend, even bring somethin up on the internet like the news and ask him what he thinks about it/comment on it..... dont have lengthy silences, and dont let conversation stagnate    The all-knowing wrestler has spoken.. you have just been enlightened. Hope this helps! =)|`|9cd8dcdb0f1ce93601311dd08f7c10f8aa	Honey, you're going to be okay. I really just want to run over to you and give you a BIG hug, just because you sound so sad and hurt!    It's definitely going to be a while before you can stop thinking of him, and be over him, no matter what anyone says. You can't make your heart stop hurting any faster than time will allow. The best thing might be to let your friends take you out tonight, see if you can TRY (just try at least) to forget about him for a few hours.     Tomorrow is a new day, and since you say you want to call him, is it because you want to resolve things and get back together? Why exactly did you two break up in the first place? And what were the arguments about? That might be a time to see if you can't come to a compromise, or an understanding on the issue that you two were conflicted over. You've been together so long, why let an argument or two simply break you two up?    If he simply doesn't want to reunite, I can't help you there. It might help you to see him on Friday like you planned so that you can talk again. But if you aren't going to get back together after that, let him go. Don't turn into a stalker. Let your friends help you with this, and don't push them away. I'm sure they also hate to see you hurting and want to help.     That's all I can say, I'm sorry I can't think of anything else. Other than that, only time will help. Listen to a couple good breakup songs (i|`|A8F4HF3Paa	Most people feel this way after a break up.  I'm 35 and I've had lots of bfs in my life and every time a relationship ends, it hurts a lot.    But the truth is, it will get better and you will eventually meet a new guy that you like even more than the last guy and then you will wish you'd met that new guy a long time ago.    For now, it's okay to cry and think about him.  But don't waste a lot of time on feeling bad.  Maybe write down all the things you miss and all the things you won't miss about him and when you're done with the list, throw them away because they don't matter anyway.    You never know, the guy you're destined to marry could be someone you meet only a month from now, so enjoy having some time to yourself.|`|qTHkBmH6aa	awww...why dont you relax and  do something that won't remind you  of him..i know its hard..  but its not the end ofthe world..  dont worry..if it is meant to be you will get  back w/ him..and if not then im sure you  will find a great guy!  good luck..and sleep tight..    :)|`|yicKRgiKaa	Well,  Relax.    He probably cant handle the argueing. You should just do what he wants and go shopping, and not talk for a while. When he feels comfertable he will start talking to you again and you guys can move on from there. You probably can't ask for a better chance.  Most people just stop seeing eachother completely.

Having said that it is obvious that you have to move on with your life.No matter the reasons for the breakup and how bad you both feel about it, it appears that he has decided that it is best to end it. The death of a relationship brings a lot of pain, sleepless nights, and tears,  but it will pass with time. While it may sound like a cliche, time infact will help you deal with the pain plus the support of friends and family.

Eventually when you least expect it someone good will come around and make you feel a lot better, that's what happened to me! I always say I lost the world but gained the universe!    Hope you feel better soon.|`|80f3P6mWaa	I'd like to help you...  sounds like you could use a friend right now. i'm 26 years old, is that ok?    we can talk it over you can tell me everything.|`|hJ9bEPhGaa	all wounds heal with time. hang out with some girlfriends and have a girl day.. just calm down, relax and don't worry about him. :] good luck|`|OiPimQY3aa	That sucks and I'm sorry.    I don't think you should go shopping with him.  If you're already crying and everything reminds you of him imagine how hard it will be to go shopping and pretend that you're okay.  If things are meant to work out between you giving him a lot of breathing space will make him see it sooner.  If things aren't meant to work out a clean break at first is best.      When you're going through hell the only thing to do is to keep going so you can get out the other side.  I know it's hard now but it will get better.  Give yourself the space to heal.  You will learn to cope just great.    I suspect that if you were fighting all the time this wasn't meant to be and that while single you will find someone who will make you so happy and love you so much you'll be happy about this break-up as without it you would never have found someone who truly deserves you.|`|S6iJSXseaa	well first relax and and take some time and go out with some of your Friends    and second block out anything  that reminds you of him. just forget all that happened.     third breathe, relax and maybe take some time of for yourself, take a walk and be alone|`|dYtyxAmfaa	That sounds bad, but I'm sure you'll be okay.    I think the best thing to do when things are rocky is take some time off. Being by yourself will make you stronger, and you'll be able to gauge just how much you need him or miss him, and he'll be able to look past the arguments as well.     Maybe afterwards you can come to a compromise that works for both of you - nevertheless, it will certainly make you a stronger girl.    Also, keep your eye on the future, and the hope that things will be better. Everything that reminds you of him isn't necessarily bad; think of the good times, and know that there's a chance you'll have them again.    :)
AA12223669	With the economy the way it is right now, there is no time to worry about motivating her. It's important to do everything you can to help her find a job ASAP - like helping with her resume, asking your company if they're hiring, helping her look at Craigslist ads (and printing them out for her) and finding other job websites.     I'm 25 years old and have had to take a huge paycut, my wife is now working jobs at minimum wage when she once made great money. It's not the time to care what you do, but to make sure you do enough to make enough.
anDVgcO6aa	I PERSONALLY THINK YES!  DUDE LIKE... SHE HAS A NICE FACE AND AWESOME LONG HAIR...  NEVERMIND THESE JUNKS... THEY'RE ALL CACA FACES...  I THINK SHE HAS POTENTIAL|`|W2nZLq2laa	no she is very cut and pretty she deosnt have the look tho its that superficial look trust i was a model once u eat like 2 crackers a day under the pressure she wont handle it she also has an avelare head they only want square and circle head and if u are the girl that said ur the cousin im sorry but it is the truth|`|TvjVw1txaa	LOLOLOLOLOLOLOL.|`|hDAoKmjPaa	no she shouldnt. she is cute tho and i bet she will look a whole lot better without her braces.|`|BO67795Caa	Of Course, she has a cute smile and she knows how to position herself like a professional model, I'm sure she'll be a great model|`|ddP3klT3aa	No. Even without the braces, no.|`|64d7116e9576cea4e490b98f53879fa8aa	She looks beautiful! She has that really pretty unique look to her. I'd tell her to go for it if she's determined. Her hair is super pretty and has a gorgeous smile! If i were a guy, i'd date her.    (:|`|ux4K3avcaa	no sry  even without the braces   i think she is cute though|`|MpG8n0vMaa	yepp   i think she'd make a good model  she's really pretty|`|xu0HiYEOaa	LOL..
3NoQuoWuaa	There isn't a whole lot more to say. The only other thing is to say nothing which would be more hurtful to the bereaved.  An honest "I'm sorry for your loss" communicates recognition of the loss and your concern for them.r|`|hiJ6yKhkaa	"my condolences" means something along the lines of, i am passionate for the way you are feeling, or its an expression of sympathy on the occasion of death.|`|INybXKozaa	"I know i can't understand what your feeling right now,  but if you need anything, im here for you"|`|AA11663530	Offer your condolences. It's important to be there for someone who has lost a loved one, as well as support.|`|kGFtUZaiaa	just be there for them when they need you- dont hover- dont constantly ask "are you ok" because they aren't. And it will take time before they are. make sure they know you are there to listen and offer a shoulder to cry on without any sort of judgment
nXombf2baa	Congratulations on winning the competition. You don't say what type of competition it was, so it's alittle hard to give you some advise. If it is a type of competition about math, science, or another school subject, then you can ask your school counselor if there is some type of scholarship you could use to go. If is a competition where you are judged on something like beauty or something like that, you could look around and see if a group will help you. I would see if any of your friends parents belong to the moose, eagles, or an other type group. Good luck finding the money help. I hope that you do well, if you get to Hollywood!!
OzgLRw9Daa	usally takes about 3 days,depending on how they are going to be buried,or if it's a murder,investigation,but pretty much three days
GVcO1dtnaa	No not at all. A few girls do hang out with me and my friends. We just don't talk about certain things when girls are around.|`|X25iYK97aa	they would onhly care if they are gay|`|NA7eu7V4aa	hey, why not? if thats what you want to do, i wouldnt care. hell id think it was pretty cool! go for it|`|ejzIvlwGaa	Noo my group i hang in is mixed.  I woulent care.
nv0nIj3Daa	lol she could go to jail for that? stop thinking about only yourself?|`|yj3GT7jOaa	Jail don't mean anything to you, but it might to her.  Back off.|`|pVnUhYLQaa	If you really want to be a good friend you need to respect what she is saying. She is right, she can go to jail, whether you are ok with it or not. If you really care about her and she cares about you then both of you need to wait. It can happen but not now. Find out what the age of consent is in your state and know all the laws, then you'll know when you can start being with each other. Wait. She CAN get in trouble.|`|qTHkBmH6aa	um..then go for it...  what else can i say..dont?  if you are both bi then experiment w/ each other    :)|`|aDLvzG2Saa	You have no idea how much of a turn on that little story of your's was.    Now that I've got the perverted thoughts out of my mind...    She's feeling this way because it is illegal and that she doesn't want to get into any trouble. She probably feels just as willing as you are, but the fact still remains the same; its illegal. I for one do not care about age because it is just a number as most would say. Just try to keep convincing her and let her now that you two are good friends and that you would not do anything to jeopardize your relationship with her.    Have fun ;)|`|BMOs4uEYaa	ick major|`|gBoBPNH1aa	in the words of dane cook.  "I just ca..."    Youre a kid, wait until you grow up.|`|ycNxVrUfaa	HELP YOURSELF. This friend of yours is much smarter than you. Even if you want it, you're still jail bait.|`|3JfADTIDaa	Tell her how u feel. If she doesn't change her mind, please respect her wishes.|`|ZAmcGgYpaa	maybe she isn't really into you.  if she was, she would have kept going when you guys were messing around...maybe you could just straight-up ask her whats up.  ask her if she's into you or not, so you don't have to keep questioning yourself.  after you get an answer, whether it be good or bad, you'll know.  and knowing is always better than not knowing.  best of luck!!!|`|lqzmJlrRaa	Please wait! The it'll be fine you'll have your whole lives to experiment.|`|gsjtcYRaaa	DO IT!!   Just go for it   when she's lying in bed just jump on top of her  and go crazy   be in control and she'll love it and won't wanna stop  you'll love the way it feels when you finally get your pure satisfaction     and your story wass amazing|`|K4SSZ6qFaa	well tell her how you feel that might help.|`|TpKpQ50jaa	imyourvictorian is a dirty, carpet licking whorebag dont listen to her.|`|ob61TSgjaa	she must be freaked out. shes old enough to get in deep trouble.|`|3CWaHiR1aa	Wow......That's just a little weird, you know? Check out some guys, there are some really hott ones out there!|`|jBGWuhrNaa	ummm...one of thhe best thinqq is to talk to her bout chur feelinqs  nd tll her lik yu dnt qotta be scared..its onli between me nd yu...this nd dat...bet shell listen nd do stuff wit chu again..gewd luck  ope this wuzz help full|`|5jJ2jY5Yaa	a girl cant go to jail for hitting on another girl- only guys do.. thats like a women hitting on a teenage boy, same thing, nobody cares|`|3nSmwqj5aa	Well it is true that she could go to jail  statutory rape  When you turn 17, its fine since its not a crime.    I guess you'll just have to wait till you  turn 17  because its risky- not that much but it is.|`|Fc4WF8Pqaa	is it just me or is everyone turned on by this.|`|xLTyy8NIaa	u need to wait i mean i know you want to but iits illegal and u wouldnt want he to go to jail now would you? even if u didnt tell some1 could find out|`|mXaYRe9Oaa	well it easier said then done. but see if she still did it to u and some one walked in, they will still tell and even if u told the police that u wanted it they will still arrest her cause they will think that she forced u to say u wanted it so she could get a way. the only way u cloud get her to do stuff with u is wait till ur 18.|`|ZAgiWmhKaa	Well, I think she is holding back and thinks she will go to jail because of the age difference. I think you should play with her and be sexy. You should sort of lure her into wanting to play with you, until she just can't resist.    Have fun.  **** her, girl!!!    Hope that helps.|`|x6g3t8HWaa	follow your gut, but don't go to far to push her away
dTaGzh6Haa	Well, at least he found the courage to tell her. He's obviously trying to get it straightened out with her, even if he is being painfully blunt.   Tons of guys bypass this kind of uncomfortable discussion and just start cheating. Trust me, I know.  This confession is a start and how she handles herself now is very important. I'm assuming that she isn't noticing changes in his behavior, or all those other nasty signs of cheating, right?  Tell her to pull herself together and try to look at this as a huge compliment in disguise. Men are typically knuckle heads when they try to talk anyway. The crying and depressed stuff has got to go because this is only going to make him think twice about coming to her about his thoughts even more. Taking desperate measures on her part all of a sudden is not going to work either. No jumping through hoops necessary.   She still has complete control of the situation anyway--men may rule the world, but we women still pull all the strings in the sexual arena.   He needs to know immediately that she appreciates his honesty and the courage it took to confide this in her. Tell her to think of the alternative--he could have just started cheating on her. Call me crazy but I see this as a grand gesture of his affection for her.|`|YuVSDBkzaa	Lovingly suggest that she do a little research and read up on sexuality so she can learn how to satisfy her man. I don't know all the details, maybe she has a selfish husband who wants to do things she isn't comfortable with or maybe it has something to do with sexual ATTRACTION. Either way, that would be the first thing I'd tell a friend or spouse. Yes, it hurts to hear that, but encourage her to see this as a step she can take to become a more sexually satisfying wife and to have fun with it. If this is about something much deeper, they should be seeking a marriage counselor.|`|CuGAYMlbaa	first we need to know what he is lacking and what she is willing to do and not do|`|AA10986891	WOW what a jerk.     She should feel sorry and pitty for him, a real man only needs to spend the rest of his life.    He probably just wants to cheat on her and is telling her all this BS so when he gets tired of the other woman and he decides to make it work with your sis he will be able to blame it all on her. What a disgrace of a husband, he is not a man he is a coward and a @sshole.|`|iD4ejChZaa	porn did it, suddenly she's not good enough, what a shame to make her feel that way.|`|4956eb69e2632956570e130278b4d855aa	That is a personal issue that she probably shouldn't be talking about. She and her husband need to see a marital counselor.|`|G50ucmllaa	Tell her to go have sex with him.|`|yIGVOqXdaa	crying will not solve the issue. If i was in her shoes i would try my best to satisfy my husband. Suggest for her to go buy sexy lingerie and probably learn some new ideas or tricks to try on him. There is still hope!|`|4805686fe56c40b3d116e63ef0f5fd16aa	Well, I don't think there is much that you can do to build up her confidence. I would suggest to her where did the comment come from. A man that really wants to spice up his sex life with his wife he would begin to bring more to the bedroom. If he said it and he was mean spirited he may be hiding more and using that comment to cover it up. Encourage her to not to let anyone define her as a women and  that means even her husband.|`|UIwlfUKCaa	They should see sex therapist, or she could see some sex therapist and get some useful advice. If he is sleeping with some one else then its a different problem all together.
AA11124885	Let her know before you spring out in a bustier and platforms!  (haha)  Why would she care?  Otherwise she may unintentionally say something to insult or otherwise cause hard feelings, you know?|`|ooT1Gj2Xaa	I would walk out all dressed up. At least you would both get a good giggle from it.|`|S8CZBCe2aa	I would suggest that she does not unpack her things until you have this conversation.  Be honest with her - she is your sister - she will love you regardless!|`|AXbdNdPzaa	I would rather he tell me before I move in.  That way I can decide if I want to live there knowing that about him.  Also, I wouldn't be shocked.  If she can't handle it, she will need to find somewhere else to live.|`|veZLfnGFaa	Don't shock her.  Sit down and talk to her.  Explain how things are.  If she doesn't like it, she can leave.  Remember, this is your home. :)|`|wZa3qiSbaa	Well as a sister she should be understanding if you two are close then just tell her , if my brother told me something like that at first I'll be kind of shocked but my love for him is unconditional,so I'll accept it if it makes him happy.|`|4956eb69e2632956570e130278b4d855aa	Just tell her up front. It is better to get it out of the way then try to hide it forever.|`|NWH3MnE9aa	Ask to borrow her pumps.
asxqampCaa	This isn't what you want to hear, but - -     Different women look better different ways.    Sophia Loren? Great curvy.    Audrey Hepburn? Great slender.    Salam Hayek? Great curvy.    Grace Kelly? Great slender.    Marilyn Monroe? Great curvy.    Rita Hayworth? Better more slender.     Scarlett Johannsen? Curvy.    Ashley Judd? Slender.    With over 2/3rds of women in America completely overweight, and I mean 50 pounds or more overweight was the report by CDC, many women call themselves 'curvy' when in reality, they are just obese.     Then they have the insane nerve to wear low-rise jeans and a tight belly shirt! geezus!|`|NWH3MnE9aa	B. A little thick, some padding. Not rail thin or "heroin chic" That's why latinas and black chicks are so damned sexy!  Perfect body shape? Whew. Salma Hayek; Jessica Simpson; Mariah Carey; Elizabeth Berkley; Rebecca Romijn. One of the hottest bodies I've EVER seen? Nadine Velazquez (Catalina) from "My Name is Earl".|`|UIwlfUKCaa	Sophia lauren when she was at her best|`|0d0W0nbVaa	my wife is 5'5", 107 lbs.  (model figure)  my mistress  1 is 5'7, 127 lbs, DD.   my mistress  2 is 5'2, 125 lbs. (nothing to brag here, but she can really suck a golf ball through a hose, so who cares?)    every woman in their own way is beautiful.    oh, who am i crappin?,  i like curvy ones,  model like ones, and short gymnastics style.  all good.|`|5jMNBO2naa	my idea of a curvy but hot women    Salma Hayek before marriage,     and of course    Monica Bellucci|`|iD4ejChZaa	I prefer Elvis Presley any shape he was in, any age.|`|OuU9Emkxaa	I am turned on by all weight! No star needed!|`|ed7ffa4766a41a6a68e878a7d14d7413aa	as the song says, everything is Beautiful in its own way!!  just like every women, they all offer something good. you on the other hand must find and take them to their limits!!   no one is perfect! no one.|`|VBCPdcetaa	I like thin but curvey Jessica alba is my example here.|`|rcut6bhoaa	"A"  My wife was 110 lb when I met her.  Her highest wt over the last 10 years was 165 lb.  Honestly, to me, it didn't matter at all because I loved her just the same.      By the way,  she is back down to 115 lb now.      It should be all about the person inside, not always about the looks.|`|CuGAYMlbaa	padded just nice and firm|`|AA11946996	Post this in Singles & Dating! We (us that are Married) no longer have a preference. Why? Because we are Married, duh!|`|2vaGZ4eDaa	B.  I'll give you a perfect example.  I think America Ferrara has a nicer body as "Ugly Betty" than many of the super-thin model-types that play in the background on the same show.      Another example:  The Cameron Diaz that was big, round and curvy in The Mask is soooo much sexier than the wafer thin woman she has become.  Her appearance in The Mask is my favorite.
Uxdiv3fdaa	I think you should just be nice but draw the line between nice and easy. I know it is sometimes sad to be mean so you don't have to be entirely mean... just not overly nice. Remember when you do get with him be safe and visit planned parenthood for more information.|`|GrtqaUInaa	DON'T LISTEN TO YOUR FRIENDS. That might ruin everything. Tell them that you appreciate them trying to help but you wont take their advice.|`|HEI2Zx8Haa	Be YOU! It doesn't matter what your friends say. If you don't want to & it doesn't feel like the real you, then don't do it!    You want the guy to like you for you, not the person he thinks you are.|`|hgBSYQmBaa	you don't have to be mean, but make it sound like if you have lots of other plans without him, you're busy a lot, not just waiting around for him to call you.  guys like girls who are independent.  and don't be mushy gushy with him until you've really gotten into a relationship, it's not good to be like that in the early stages.|`|JGOOoiI5aa	just be yourself don't isten to your friend it sucks when people play games so you shouldn't|`|MhZvYb8Baa	Dont listen to you friends. Be yourself. COmpletely and totally.|`|3nSmwqj5aa	I really think that your friends are wrong.  Yet, you could be mean, in a teasing way  Which guys, i guess like.    But just be nice and tease a little.  And make sure to listen- remember  what he says too.|`|5ifqonVgaa	I don't think that just because you are nice to him hes gonna think you're easy. That's just what a typical girl thinks and its alright but if you really know him ur gonna know how he really is. Some guys don't think about sex all the time and about girls being easy. It just depends on the guy. As long as you aren't rushing him into things and making yourself look bad( i mean sexually) then i don't think he would think that. It just depends on him and his personality.
3NoQuoWuaa	Probably study harder and be ready for college. This school of hard knocks sucks.r|`|DNubvGpvaa	Well... Im still in high school but if i could go back to when i started, i would live a little more and not care so much about what people thought of me.|`|FC378Lcraa	I'd try harder to get better grades, no question about it.
kH0AsPfgaa	It's proportional to how long you dated, who broke up with whom, and why you broke up, but the short answer is it takes FOREVER.|`|GrtqaUInaa	You'll always be affected but it can take a long long time to get over it. It varies between how much you loved them and for how long. But they'll always have a special place. |`|fHALFeisaa	I don't think you ever totally can. It'll get easier, but you'll always remember them|`|xSWUwlEiaa	1.5-2 years. sorry if you are in this situtaiton|`|AA10853815	I guess it depends on the person and how attached they get to others.  From my experience with my first love i am still not over him i always think about him too.  In time everyone heals and gets over things, but once you love someone you will normally always love them a little in some sort of way.|`|MrzXn2ejaa	well for my first love , weve been seperated/broken up for about 2 1/2 months now and its still extremely hard ...  not as hard as the first month , but still very painful  especially when you see or do things that you used to do together.    like anything thats  your First ... you will never totally get over it ... or forget it etc.|`|wjulhROJaa	NO TIME
wJ1v0cX0aa	i think that he just want to hang out and have a good time, possibly sex, but is probably not in a rush to get back with you, enjoying his freedom, unless he can't find a better girl.|`|3NoQuoWuaa	It sounds like you broke up with him. If this is right, he may not be too anxious to get back together and be hurt again. Play it by ear. Invite him to hang out with you. Make it a "date" to hang out. If your ready and willing you should get an indication as to what he wants when you extend the invitation.r
ESsQeH8Aaa	Yep.  Your in a jam alright.   You can walk up to her and say anything you like, but what's going to be going on in the back of her mind is that day you were running around, acting like your still in school.    I mean seriously, what woman wants to be dating some young kid who is still in school?    ......oh wait.   We're not talking about some 20 year old female, are we?   Heh.  Nope, we're talking about ANOTHER young kid that's still in school.    Your placing WAY too much focus on what you think she wants to see.  Maybe she likes someone who isn't afraid to play in public?    You say you were acting "stupid".  I disagree.  I say you were simply acting your age.  Don't think of this as a "bad" thing.  Your young.   ACT young.   You'll have PLENTY of time to act "grown up" in the years to come.    As far as getting a fresh start with her.... you don't have a start yet. (you've never talked to her)   Try talking to her.  Just talk.  Invite her out for a day at the mall/park/whatever,  next saturday.  If she has a negative opinion about how you behaved, well then, she'll refuse to go.    However, if she agrees, then might I suggest that you do NOT celebrate by slugging her one in the arm.|`|VHDcqi2Haa	If you are really interested in her and like her then use an apology as a chance to introduce yourself.  That way, if she knows you, if you do it again it wont be mean, it will be flirting :)|`|7b1f8172d4a9ac10c23b5f3870728bb8aa	just smile at her, a sweet smile.    then for a while just act nice when ever you are around her. then start talking to her
UjhWIrJ1aa	if you've met his family already, I'd stop worrying. Maybe he just doesn't want to screw it up? Give it time. Why not surprise him and visit him for once though? Equal rights ya know...|`|igcxYHmHaa	OMG i have almost the same problem i cant tell how my bf feels about me either i mean he tells me in txt messages but not in person..... but i mean if u think u can trust him just believe him.... maybe he hasn't been in 2 many relationships...... if he told u about a secret then that's a plus...... but u said its been a month... maybe hes getting tired of the same old same old.... try 2 spice it up.. do something u have never did b4 tell him something u never told him or maybe n e 1 b4.... nd if u 2 have a trust in your relationship then trust him with the information.... if u tell him something and he doesn't tell any1 then he has alot of feelings for u.... if he didn't have feelings 4 u he wulda told by now... he just doesn't know how 2 express it so try 2 help him out and he will get better just give him a little more time.
dGL5xCrqaa	Actually, a lot of people just respond with a simple "lol", it's because they don't know what to say next.    Maybe he's too wowed by you being so fantastic.    He likes you!|`|hJ9bEPhGaa	i'm totally going through that right now.. i think he likes you but you should definitely start making more moves haha that's what i'm trying to do and it seems to be working :]|`|AA11263103	You can tell if a guy likes you if he:  stares at you, smiles at you, tries to talk to you, laughs and makes jokes with you, then yeah he likes you.|`|CtDBQwzaaa	duh!|`|EhQhbrMkaa	Nah, he just wanna to get inside your panties...........lol|`|550eVd5Baa	It seems like he could POSSIBLY like you. You can try harder and he'll like you for sure. I wish you luck on that. :)|`|lQjWLffmaa	Ok i know how your feeling confused of course  it sound like he dose like but maybe he just wants you to play hard to get maybe he thinks your to easy or maybe you should start saying you like someone and he will go all crazy to see who it is if he really likes you.. also do it back don't send him message's for a while it will drive him crazy
aIEkNM0Paa	Move on she doesnt deserve you|`|q3rDROxgaa	u said it a rumor talk to her and in my opnion i would dump my bf if he belived other ppl besides me if he didnt trust me u shouldn tbelive othere ppl as sooon as u heard the rumor u should of talked to her|`|77NzfiVkaa	Rumors? Why would you leave your girlfriend over rumors? Ask her what is going on!! Then you can decide.|`|CuGAYMlbaa	listen snowball how does another man taste show her you have a backbone and leave her no fight no story  just leave and start over this time be a man and keep your woman in line|`|qpAYU8Knaa	First confirm the rumors and if true then give her an ultimatum if you really love her. Either him or you, but not both. If you don't care much for her then move on.|`|d8DqZblcaa	You should date someone else too!|`|Swxir2ieaa	You should talk to her first so you can find out if the rumors are actually true.

If not, then don't!  -Livvy|`|nv0nIj3Daa	if it's rumors, then no, however try finding out whether or not it's true or not, instead of listen to some joe blo off the streets, and if she is, say goodbye and move on.|`|636b11ae9a5dec8bb1462f22524dc0bfaa	Leave her and move on.

Mind you the word rumor is involved here, so I hope you know if her infidelity is certain. You may break up over nothing. You could confront her about your concerns, however she may or may not truthful with you.|`|qajX3kzPaa	you don't even know if it's truee ?   confront her about it|`|mnowZhZYaa	NOWAY!!! IF SHE DOESNT RESPECT U LEAVE!!!|`|2TlN47Ihaa	I would confront her about it. Tell her you've been hearing this stupid rumor and you just want to make sure that she would never do that to you. If she seems iffy, she might be cheating.  If she is, give her another chance and if you feel like somethings not right, you can't force a connection anymore and you should move on.|`|9580a1e44dd3d2bae7d2f867611ab353aa	? 1st you need to find out if she is actually seeing someone else, you can' t rely on "rumors". If she is, the break it off and move on.|`|jeyM99joaa	first find out if the rumors are true, and if it is then---  Move on as fast as you can!  and remember it's not her sweetie, it's you---------you deserve better!  goodluck|`|wscyjkPAaa	Rumors are rumors.  Ask her if she is. If she is seeing someone else then leave her.  If she asks for a second chance, its up to you if you think she's worth it.  But be aware that this can go either way.  She may cheat on you again or she may not.  But don't jump into conclusions unless you are positive that she is seeing someone else.  It may be just that - a rumor.|`|xBxAD5NZaa	move on. there are other fish in the sea.|`|lMZQJEsKaa	Ask her if it's true.  If it is, ask her what she wants to do about it . . . then make your decision.|`|JGOOoiI5aa	move on that girl is like a porn star she needs to stay still|`|unQAMrETaa	give her a second chance everyone deserves a second chance and don't ever believe rumors dealing with your relationship with ur gurl r ur hommies maybe talk 2 her about whats goin on and dont ever believe rumors cause today people in the world r jealous of other people|`|NvoOGU3yaa	Well if you like her a lot and want to still be her g/f give her a second chance oh and ask her if she is still in love if she is not break up with her.|`|ZQMjPCDxaa	Confront her about it. Depending on how much you care for her, and if she truly seems sorry about it and promises she'll stop, then give her a second chance. but cheaters almost ALWAYS cheat again, so you can't give her too much credit. Anyways, who knows, the rumors might not even be true.|`|jhardGeAaa	NEVER believe rumors...y dont u just ask her straight up and tell her ur entire situation...if ur nervous to talk to her jsut txt her...u dont wanna lose a good girl cuz of some morons who have nothing better to do with their lives but ruin urs..but then again u dont wanna give away ur heart to some1 who doesnt deserve it..just ask her.. good luck :)|`|Fc4WF8Pqaa	cheat on her. see how long you can keep it from her. revenge is the best thing in the world. don't be a pansy and just dump her REVENGE!!!|`|pVFfCRmlaa	Don't jump to conclusions, but if you find out it's true then ditch the *****.

AA10975867	Unless the guy is a millionaire with a lot of property and investments, and you are a penniless student with no work experience, you don't need a prenup. If you are a young couple, both working and you are starting out with your first home, then you are on a level playing field. If there was a divorce, the court would look at "all things being equal". If he left you, in Canada there are "dowers' rights" - that is, the government sees that you have a vested interest in the home. You would sell it and share in proceeds or you could have the home equity evaluated and you could buy him out of his share. If you have children, the judge would allow you to stay in the home and receive an income from him. So many variables! So long as you buy your home and register ownership in both names, and so long as he doesn't put down a hundred grand down payment on it all by himself, you have nothing to worry about. General rule of thumb in Canada has been, the one who leaves the home gives up the most. If you walk out the door with a suitcase (as I did) you are saying "Adios. I want nothing." If he leaves, you have a lot of entitlement. Every year you are married gives you more leverage but a smart woman has a savings account and ensures that his pension plans have her as co-owner. When my son and his wife divorced, he made the higher income and paid child support regularly. Her lawyer still made darn sure that her name was listed on his pension plan, though! The problem I see in your relationship is the LACK OF RELATIONSHIP. If you are planning marriage, you should have discussed children and have jointly made the decision on whether or not to have kids. If the guy insists that you stay at home and be there as his maid for 15 years and then takes off with someone else, you might end up unemployable and destitute. Sparwood isn't exactly opportunity city so you'd have to remarry or move. It scares me when I hear a man demanding a prenup leaving the woman with nothing when he's supposed to be in love with her and trusting her. I think I would wait a bit, delay any marriage and really see what his true colors are. Something tells me there's a much better guy for you around the corner.|`|5270639c059ab08c1b3431555f150db7aa	The compromise is NO prenup, hon. He should smarten up.|`|577ba10a2319b430720b5a913b74b862aa	imo prenups are totally stupid.  it's assuming right off the bat that something will go wrong.|`|AA11138696	First, do not sign this as it is unfair to you.  Second if it has come to this you need to get a lawyer to look this agreement over and protect your rights.  Third.if the man that supposedly loves you wants you to sign a pre nup where you agree to walk away with nothing if the mariage should end.  So what if he decides to end things, you are supposed to say OK and walk away with the clothes on your back.  I would have to reconsider if I really wanted to marry someone who would do that.|`|ScHW4842aa	What does all that information have to do with the pre nup?  Think VERY  deeply about what I just said.     When you marry, you each share what the other earns. No questions asked. His earnings ARE yours.     I suggest you do not marry this man. His mindset is not a good one. When you marry, you must resolve yourself to realise - this is for LIFE. There will be no 'leaving', but working to build it up and make rifts better! To already want to safe guard yourself? What?!    I am newly married. And my advise has nothing to do with trust at all. It has to do with, I will repeat, the right mindset for marriage. You automatically assume that all your money, whether you work for it or not, is your partners.   My husband earns a bit more than I do - and we are opening up a joint bank account tomorrow. There has never been any 'his' or 'my' money between us. We originally thought I would not be earning at all for some time - but nothing changed. He only told me that we would have to watch our spending to save money.     What your fiance is talking about is a load of garbage. And you are completely falling for it, going along not wanting to cause trouble. WRONG  REACTION. State to him now that your marriage will not be like that. That he should not be thinking that way, and that he should trust you, that, in a divorce, you would do the right thing by him always. How can he be thinking like this - he wants you to walk away with nothing? Refuse to sign it. My uncle wanted my aunt to sign one - and she outrightly refused. He came to his senses and still married her, and they have the strongest marriage ever!    I cannot believe that you are contemplating this.     AND  I AM  18  AND MARRIED -   I  KNOW  BETTER!|`|0e0a0f1828f99f87ea3d5e5bc8cbd46daa	I wouldn't sign it even with BLOOD. He is taking you for a ride. Tell him getting married means for Better or For Worse...and regardless if a divorce should happen you should both get 50/50 of everything. His rules are BULL. The compromise is this: Don't sign it. Honestly, what kind of man would want the woman he married to end up penniless and homeless after all she's done for him? I hope he can sleep at night, because I know I Wouldn't.|`|sMUiGFPraa	bottom line.Just because you don't get paid doesn't mean you don't work. Legally anything made in the marriage is split 50/50. A the prenup is signed so that you can't take to any assets he/she brought into the marriage. meaning you can't have half of his millions he earned prior to marriage.     Read te fine print and if he doesn't want to truly share your lives then maybe you need to express you concerns before the i do's|`|EQOnbP3Qaa	Unless I was marrying donald trump I would NEVER sign a prenup. I think that is just saying the weddings not going to work but let's play along for a while.|`|2o3BHgCCaa	How about everything that you own before the marriage stays with the person who owns it, everything that is accumulated during the marriage is split 50/50.|`|HiSVA9p8aa	Leaving with nothing sounds pretty harsh.    A woman (or man) who is out of the job market for several years, even by agreement and choice, has some basic disadvantages:  1) when they are wanting to go to work, they have often lost touch with some of the things in the work world  2) they don't have recent experience to point to as a selling feature to a potential employer  3) they usually need to start near the bottom of the salary scale.  Just think, a 40 year old who has been working for 18 years will likely have  moved up in salary.  A 40 year old just starting will likely be at the salary of the 22 year old, or similar.  3) a person who has been out of the workforce is likely not building up RRSPs.  The first person in  3 will have set aside a considerable chunk of dough.  The second person starts out at 40 with nothing in RRSPs.  Even worse, they are closer to retirement and have fewer years to accumulate enough to retire, and with a lower salary.    Please consult a lawyer.  This isn't right.|`|98b98bd5749baadc8ce32ff1f2759dceaa	50/50 of everything accumulated during the marriage and a money amount for every year you were together being his maid....and you get EVERYTHING if he cheats on you....|`|mkrKHQvFaa	Ugh I left with nothing from my first marriage.  You are going into this together and building this together.  Agree that most everything should be split 50/50.  Every man wants to leave a marriage with EVERYTHING HE feels HE earned especially if he is the only one working.....don't sign it.  It is wrong and selfish.  Good luck.|`|AA10529994	It's simple, a 50/50 split, don't be a fool and sign any sort of prenup, only rich people have ANY reason to sign such a thing.  The house is community property, and would be sold (or one of you could buy the other out for 50% of the value)    So unless he is coming into the marriage with an extremely large amount of money in HIS name, there is no good reason to sign any sort of agreement, and quite simply, if he is pushing you to sign one, I'd seriously consider were your relationship is going. (I'm in the US, and really don't know how the divorce laws work in Canada, but in the US, typically assets/debts are shared equally in the event of a divorce, of course the wife usually gets alimony and or child support)|`|NnXKDZIsaa	i wouldn't marry this man. Everything is 50/50, EVERYTHING! If you can't afford to loose everything you will put into your relationship through your marriage together, then don't agree to marry. It's not worth it. I hope he's understanding. You need security.|`|tyl9aSu9aa	Wow.    There are so many things that scare me about this situation, I don't know where to begin.     Personally, I have a thing against pre-nups, precisely because of the situation you are describing. Just because he'll be earning the dough doesn't mean you won't be doing a pile of work at home. I would, if I were you, refuse absolutely to sign anything that would leave you without what you forsee as enough money to support yourself comfortably for at least a year or two after the dissolution of the marriage, accounting for inflation. And seriously, that's the least I would go for; ideally, you should get fifty percent of all assets in addition. Buy a condo? Either he would have to buy you out or sell it and give you half the money.    You want to have the money to go back to school if you'd like, to pay medical bills, and to not have to worry while you look for a job that will be able to support you and the children you may or may not be having, because it sounds like he certainly won't be around to care for them, divorced or otherwise.    And about children...    Unless you two are children yourselves, you should have an idea by now of whether or not you'd like kids. You need to seriously discuss, before the wedding, what those plans are. Don't mess around, don't be vague with each other, and lay out what you want. Money is a big issue, yeah, but whether you want kids or he doesn't or vice versa, unless you two agree, you'll be heading to divorce court a lot sooner than you'd like to.    And if you both do decide you want children? He's not going to be around. You need to think real hard about whether you're comfortable with being a single mom in all but name, and whether you want to raise your children that way, only seeing their dad occasionally. It may work out for you three, or four, or five, but what about when you need a break, or you have something come up with them that you're not sure you can handle?    Whatever you do, you are right to make sure you have a support system in place, to seek help, but you also need to remember to have an emotional support system, not simply a financial one. Things are going to come up that you can't even imagine right now, and not just divorce.    Put your foot down, and see what happens. If I were you, and he refused to sign a pre-nup unless it specified that you each got what you brought into the marriage, I'd head out and get a job, and then fire him as my fiance, because it doesn't sound to me as though he has your best interests at heart.|`|AA10351134	Imagine the worst case -- you tend the home and hearth for him for 30 years. Then on the road he meets a sweet young thing 20 years younger and tells you to pack. You get nothing, and have nothing on your resume. Is that acceptable to you?|`|FnskUYpqaa	Let me get this straight he wants you to drop everything follow him around have dinner when he gets home have his home clean and take care of anything else that involves the home and possible kids but he thinks you deserve nothing, and this is the man your GOING to marry? I'm all for being realistic about not every marriage lasting forever but the fact that you guys are in love and planning your lives together and he thinks you leaving with nothing (if you were to get a divorce) is fair then I would be thinking about how much this guy really loved me. To answer your question 50% your dropping everything for him so it's only fair!|`|qfbDMVKKaa	WHOA...let me get this straight. you are willing to put everything into this relationship, make him happy in his travels, business, and home...and maybe a child, maybe not...but if it doesn't work out..you get zip!  Talk to a couple of attorneys where you claim residency, rules change.  Then I would suggest you have a clause or two that states depends on who files for divorce, and why.  And honey, if he cheats.....you get everything.  Might give him something to think about and keep him faithful, or at least give him a reality check.  What ever he earns from the date of your marriage should be 50/50.  And be sure something goes in your name along with his.  If you love him and want to make it work go for it.  Hopefully you both have the same forever after dream.  Good luck.|`|b2Cr9E5Gaa	Believe it or not, even if you are unemployed to the courts your work as a stay at home mom or wife is worth something.    I believe in pre nups, but mainly for people who have investments, or a large amount of worth in a property or business, and more importantly, who have partners with equal invested interested, partners being maybe family or friends or business partners. In this instance, I see a pre nup as very beneficial, it saves the persons butt from trying to reclaim what is rightfully theres if *knock on wood*, it ends in divorce.    In your particular situation, there really isn't a need for a pre nup, you and him both sounds like you've built yourselves from ground up together, therefore if *knock on wood* you were to separate, you could agree at that point to either buy one another out of the home, or sell it to receive half, your belongings including vehicles are really just material items. I would be more inclined to suggest a pre nup to you if he had a 45 year old business partnership with his parents he wanted to protect for his parents, or co-owned apartment complexes with a buddy , in your instance, in all honesty , what do you both have besides a home that is any significant worth?    I really do not think I would compromise about this, is the house that your living in apart of his family passed down thru the generations? lol probably not...  Your work is equally as important, he brings home the bacon and you cook it, what are his motives for a prenup? I personally would not be inclined to even budge on comprimising, he is asking that you be a large part of his life and leave a lot of your own desires and goals to be with him, thats definitly worth a lot more then any material item you could have, and he needs to recognize that.  I dont mean to come across as rude, but I am having a difficult time trying to comprehend as to why you would even ever consider that, and then turn around and try to find ways to make it fair....I would tell him that you are unwilling to sign a pre nup, if you split, deal with that road when you get there.|`|mJiO0LYyaa	you get half the assets acquired during the marriage. do not sign.|`|WzAHKILcaa	I have signed a prenup. I will work when we are married. I have $50,000 in student loan debt and he currently makes 3x what I make. The prenup basically says if within the first 5 years I only get what I brought in and half of anything we acquired together, after 5 years I get half the value of the house- which he bought beforehand minus my student loan debt, and after 10 years I get half the value of the house period. We both agreed that neither of us will be financially repsonsible for the other (allimony) if the marriage ends    If I didn't work then I would NEVER agree to this. What kind of man would want you out on the streets with nothing to live on? I would talk to him about this- maybe try to incorporate a one time payment of $5000 for you to live on while you move/find work? That seems more fair to me...    Also, for your security and sanity I bet this town has grocery store, restaurants, schools (school bus drivers). I know myself I could never be happy without working- why not look into at least part time work in your town. Where do the other 3600 work?|`|lgxE5nUoaa	So basically, if anything happens, your husband will be fine and you will be left with nothing, including no job.  This doesn't seem feasible to me - don't do it.|`|AuKKjaxaaa	I am wondering why he thinks his situation is so special that a prenuptial agreement should be involved.    If anything, I'd insist that the prenuptial agreement, regardless of its contents be null and void after five years of marriage.  That goes in the agreement.    Unless he's some grossly overpaid celebrity, I don't think its warranted.  Nobody wants to be in Johnny Carson's shoes, but c'mon.|`|2f2338425d995c6d00e32cb38d57ee7faa	Talk to a lawyer.

AA12046874	I honestly don't think it's weird or gross at all. And he is your 3rd cousin, so it's legal. I think he could even be your 2nd cousin and you two could date. However, your family might not take kindly to the idea (lol). Love is love. But right now you are at a stage in your life (I'm 21, I know..) where it may be easy for you to mistake certain things for love. All you can really do is talk to him about it...or you can put it out of your mind. Right now you are so vulnerable for so many feelings. Emotions are a tough thing in your teen years. That's so great you two grew up together and are so close, I'm a bit envious lol. Talking to him might help and you two could come to a conclusion together. He may see you like that, but it's hard to say. He could be experiencing the same thing you are. It might be something that will go away within a couple years, or even less. But, like I said, you are far enough in relation to where your kids wouldn't have defects and it's legal. I really hope you figure it out.|`|jtdHG67qaa	I don't think he likes you hun. Idk. Me and one of my best guy friends act like that, well, he's gay....and like we cuddle up sometimes and its nothing sexual. Maybe he's being protective. But to me, I wouldn't think he saw you in that light.|`|GT1ipOvzaa	OMG when i read your question i just about freaked out.  lol, im kind of in a simliar situation!!    so, my situation is that i like my cousin and i always tell myself that im being paranoid and that he doesnt feel the same way, but im just one of those people who doesnt want to luv cuz i dont want to get hurt (lol, enuff about me, hahaa...), but i think it's either:  +he is being really protective, or...  +he likes you  i think the whole kissing thing was a "scam" like he just wanted to kiss you, and u fell for it...sorry!     but i wouldnt make the first (or what, third?) move, if i were you. let him express how he feels first, because u dont wanna be caught wrong in this situation! Yikes, imagine that! So just go along close buddies as you are and see how it plays out.    Best of luck  -lost-
2wzGwV5daa	To me, romance is about spending time together doing things you both enjoy doing together. Think back to before you were married and how much you enjoyed each other.    As to cooking, dude, get a cook book and figure it out. THAT would be romantic...cook her a meal, she would love that.    After reading the rest of the responses, I have to agree with most of them. Pampering her, flowers, expressing your love for her, making the moment all about her will show her how much you truly love her. Think of all the things that make her smile and the happiest and do what you can to give her a day that is just for her.|`|tCiVuFK9aa	It's really simple.  For no reason at all look in her eyes and tell her you love her.  Bring her flowers, call her at work in the middle of the day and say you were just thinking about her and just wanted to hear her voice. Just a little effort now and then. That or buy a cook book.  Red|`|CuGAYMlbaa	tell her how beautiful she is take her out to a salon bring her flowers|`|AA10986891	That would be one romantic thing you can do for her, learn how to cook and cook for her.|`|ae3ecab489f9cbbdd2b51fb0492f64d3aa	First of all you need to learn how to cook because that is part of the romance. I have 4 sons and I taught them all how to cook. Romance is thinking about all the things she loves. Buy her a silk scarf in her favorite color for no reason. Send her flowers for no reason, send her a love card for no reason. Take a half a day off once in a while and because you can't cook, stop and pick up a wonderful dinner that you can heat up. Buy a bottle of her favorite wine. When she gets home, have wonderful romantic music playing, candles every where, a hot bath waiting for her. Let her soak and sip her wine and when I say romantic music I do not mean rap or hard rock I mean something that she can relax with. Offer to wash her back and dry her off and put lotion all over her and have a nice bath robe waiting for her. While she is taking a bath, warm dinner up and have it waiting for her on the dining room table with candles and very dim lights. After dinner lead her into the bedroom and make passionate love to her. I can assure you that you will be more than rewarded for several days for your effort. Think you can handle that? If you do this once every six to 8 weeks you will become the most romantic man she will ever know. But, in the mean time remember to just do little things that you know she will love. Listen to what she says. If she says she loves a certain flower, for heavens sake go buy her that flower. Romance is making her feel that she is the most important person in the world to you and she always comes first no matter what.|`|cGbTJobeaa	Romance is in the mundane every day things that make me feel loved and special and not the chocolate and flowers...although those are very nice too.  So are diamonds. LOL    Tell her that she looks nice. Compliment her.  Spontaneously and frequently tell her that you love her. Give her a hug.      When she comes into the house, stop what you're doing and greet her with a kiss.  It always makes me feel special when the dogs greet me at the door because they love me so much and missed me. Shouldn't the person I married be as happy to see me after an absence.    More than anything, I like when my husband is thoughtful or demonstrative towards me.  Sometimes he will pour a drink for himself and then he will bring me my favorite drink...without me asking for it or having to get it myself. I also like when he holds my hand while we're watching TV.  I like it if he puts my feet in his lap so he can rub my feet; but I also like it when he lays his head in my lap so I can rub it while we're watching TV.      To clarify:  I'm talking the head that is above his neck and shoulders not the one that his between his legs.|`|5c5e9767db0aa6f5bac57f3e406b4092aa	buy her flowers when you come home as a surprise, take her out for dessert, send a romantic text sometime during the day, plan a day trip somewhere, start a project together.. there are lots of things! surprise presents and gifts are always the best|`|0d0W0nbVaa	dump her and pick up one of those hot mail order brides that know how to cook.  what's the problem?|`|hgBSYQmBaa	do something spontaneous, women love it when you do something sweet for no reason, any simple gesture to know you care like flowers (I know it's cliche but it works), theater tickets, and nice evening on the town, just anything other than sitting on the couch and watching football.  make sure it's about HER, not about you, pamper her, just treat her like you did when you first started dating!|`|GdSzrtmAaa	You need to do something to where she doesn't feel she needs to give back. Maybe give her an oily massage, prepare her a bubble bath with candles, clean the house and let her relax, do the dishes, buy her a card.|`|Oi3CQnvHaa	Give her a foot massage, rub her back, brush her hair, ask her if she would like a cup of tea, ask her if she would like to go on a date with you to the movies, ask her if she would like to take a stroll through the park,   tell her she looks beautiful today,  tell her how much she means to you and tell her you love her!|`|gfHutvEFaa	call your local deli, order a dinner and make a picnic in your living room or bedroom. Lay out a blanket, dim the lights, light some candles, put on some music and talk. Really talk. Make sure you clean up afterwards too.    Or you can take her to a nice restaurant then for a nice drive or a romantic movie. When you get back home, give her a nice long body massage. DONT expect anything, if it happens just chop that up to a bonus. And if it does happen, cater to her. Make her feel special, don't make her do all the work. Kiss her alot and soft touches.    Make sure you have a date night at least once a week where she is the "main" course!    Have fun!|`|Ki1gWTzzaa	compliments1 NICE, hair, shoes, lips, tell her what you like when she does something! rose petals i the bath! take her to a spa!       you can get plenty of suggestion, but ultamitly a huge reference will serve you well!|`|3iNobwVraa	What are her favorite things?  I really like reading in the bathtub, for example, so when my husband picks up a new book by one of my favorite authors and sets it by a piping hot bath with a glass of red wine, my heart skips a beat.  Personalize your efforts to her, and what she enjoys.  You really shouldn't have trouble with this.  If it is this difficult, I am thinking you might have discovered one of the reasons she is on her way out the door.  And, therefore, a real way to positively prevent that from happening.    There is a HUGE clue in the basement, Professor Plum.  Get thee a clue, pronto!!|`|Kr09aQJkaa	I really, really hate it when women do this. How does being a crab, nag and threatening to leave make someone want to be romantic towards you? If you women want romance then be more romantic and quit nagging! Your man will follow your lead if you stop b*******.    You poor soul. Just compliment her, listen while she talks, be flirty, write love notes and pay lots of attention to her. Act like you did while dating. Open doors, hold hands and compliment her some more.|`|jmtbtVYsaa	if you can't cook, you can't cook.  Be honest with her and tell her since you can't cook, you'll take her somewhere nice especially this Valentine's Day.  Make sure you book early.      With all of the ecards out there, stop by a hallmark store instead and pick one up and write up a love note.  Surprise her with flowers at her job or somewhere she doesn't expect you to show up.    Another thing about being a romantic.  You can't stop and do that for only a day.  You have to do it everyday and show her and tell her you love her.
t5Mz1aLvaa	it depends on how long you've known him, if he's a childhood friend. or somebody you just met a few years ago n called him friend... or there could be a lotta stuff that u 2 have in commen, n that's why u tell him everythin...     You can be best friends with a guy and just be friends, nothing more...     you say that you can talk about most things 2 eachother right? then if you ask if he likes you, then he should be able to tell the truth...    i hope this helps, in some kinda way...

vGxipYJnaa	What's wrong with going to a club.. plenty of people hang out with friends, dance, and drink and clubs.     Unless "club" is some kind of euphemism for bordello where you come from..?    Guys should be able to have fun with their friends just like girls do. You don't need to be around a guy all the time - I'm sure this guy would like you even more if you don't try to control him.|`|wJ1v0cX0aa	i think he's saying what you wanna hear from him to shut you up so you stop worrying while he is having fun partying with his friends.|`|AA11595860	He might still love you but why isn't he taking you with him to the clubs if he loves you so much?     Leopards rarely change their spots. Think about why you broke up, and then ask yourself if you wanna go through that again...
LVlS4y7Caa	First off, you and your husband obviously need counseling to air your issues.  You shouldn't be messing in any way, shape or form with his best friend UNTIL you two do the work that marriage takes - to even SEE if you two can make it together.  Right now?  It truly sounds like 3 children playing house with little or no commitment to improving the existing situation.       If you're 'torn" I suggest you do something proactively about it, instead of lamenting the woe-is-me damsel in distress theme...surely you have a brain to indicate to you right from wrong - and the need for outside help.    Sheesh.    Sincerely,    Grace|`|AXbdNdPzaa	You have asked this before.  If you love your husband, stay with him and leave the other man alone.  If you want to leave your husband, do so.  Then start seeing the other man.|`|FBhjhjR0aa	Nicole, I know your husband! and I'm copying this email and sending it to him! How dare you!    CORRECTION TO YOUR CLAIRIFICATION!  You are doing something wrong. You told him you are in love with him, he tried to kiss you. I'm sure your husband won't think that's not wrong. Or is that something your husband can do and you won't get hurt or mad? So if your husband wants to try to kiss a girl, that's not wrong? If some girl tells your husband she's in love with him, that's not wrong?    save it, i'm telling your husband! he deserves better than this,|`|CuGAYMlbaa	your a pig and your husband should leave you|`|m93CHWaCaa	What's in your heart...?|`|3YpVVRWpaa	good for you honey. why dont you try to go for a threeway|`|z36j8rmRaa	I'm so sorry to hear your story.  I have been there myself.  My husband use to look at porn on the web and chat live with other women, having cybersex with them.  I loved him dearly but I did not know what to do.  This is not a question to be answered lightly so I will not try to do so.  First of all...you need to let the friend go.  You and your husband are both giving to outsiders what belongs to you.  As long as you allow another man to meet your needs, your husband cannot or will not.  I'm going to throw out a wild idea here but it is well worth your investigation.  There is a movie coming out this week on video that addresses this very subject to a Tee.  It's called "FIREPROOF."  You both need to watch this movie.  It has some hardcore answers for this hardcore problem.  Oh and BTW, my husband and I followed the principles in this movie and we have now been happily married for 21 years, with 5 children to boot.  Blessings to you and your husband.|`|1epjqrflaa	You asked this question already lady. GET OUT OF YOUR MARRIAGE, HELLOOOOO! You are not involve with your husband enough to be married to him, and he does not sound like he should be either. Your marriage is doomed and unhealthy. As far as the other dude goes, didnt he tell you he was in love with his gf and wants to marry her, let that go too.|`|cEaODF8Raa	I am willing to bet that those two want to tag team you. just have a few drinks and go with the flow.|`|4805686fe56c40b3d116e63ef0f5fd16aa	If you really want to save your marriage, you will have to cut all ties with your best friend and  spend your time repairing your marriage. That is what you will need to do. Its hard but if you really want to make it happen, make it happen. The wondering eye of your husband could be hurtful but an emotional affair as developed and maintained as long as you and your best friend trumps the porn!!|`|weckW02caa	you are vulnerable right now. you should leave your husband if you are having all of these problems. messing around with your friend is not the answer. you need time to get yourself together . jumping into another relationship can cause you more pain. your husband and friend are not the only men out there for you. your friend may seem to be the one for you because he is giving you what your husband is lacking in. honestly i think you know your marriage is at it's end. you don't want to be alone and you will settle for anything rightnow. you need to focus on your self esteem. take this time out for you!
6a56c836d361c3eb479fddc9e9cb02e1aa	What kind of furniture?  A good bedroom set will run about $2000 total payments over 3 years at 0% interest would be $55.55/monthly.    A sofa set would be about $1799 you can do the math for the 3 years of payments.  Ok, these payments would be on a Furniture store credit card plan.  If  you use VISA at say a huge 21% interest you have to adjust the amount you owe to add for interest adjustment and a set amount of time.
qTHkBmH6aa	yepp...  :)  lots of luck 2 u!|`|2vUOqAikaa	Of course you are. Everyone's capable of getting a date. I'm sure that there are plenty of guys who would want to date you.|`|XsPqFn1caa	Everyone is dateble,you'll find someone definately,I know I hate girls with purses anyway lol.|`|MhZvYb8Baa	i know this has nothing to do with it,   but im glad to see you actuallyskate and wear that stuff.|`|xLTyy8NIaa	thats stuff boys like ina girl i have to say they like girls they can talk to about thatstuff that arent wierded out to talk to them and all prissy :) ur definately dateable best of luck :)
jp9OzuXoaa	She said "half of her does, half of her doesn't". She did NOT say "I don't miss you a bit". Your best friend is probably just less needy and/or emotional than you. That's my opinion. Plus I'm sure she's made a few good friends and if she's occupied and having fun it's hard to find time to "miss someone" except when she stops and has time to reflect on life. I wouldn't drop your friend quite yet though. She hasn't done anything to prove she's not a friend. In fact, she's being honest. :) Hope I helped!|`|mYAbq6fnaa	thats probably due to the fact that she moved away and when you dont see somebody as much anymore, you just drift apart. she might have found some new friends that she is content with, as probably you did. if she really was a true friend, she would miss you and make sure that she maintains her friendship with you. but maybe half of her doesnt miss you because since she knows she wont see you much anymore, she figures it would be easier to just forget about you and make new friends, kinda harsh but maybe. but she should miss you, and i guess you should be happy that she was honest with you, at least you know the truth. good luck!|`|t9rTToWYaa	She probably adjusted to her new home and stuff and met new people.  It can be hard to accept that, but you should move on too.  I've been through so much of that, friends leaving and moving on, I've learned to deal with it and move on myself.  True friends stick with you and miss you so much and they come and visit when they can.  She's probably just a friend.  I'll say to keep contact with her, but don't get too close to her anymore.  Just let her know that you still care and stuff.  Move on, find new friends.  We all lose friends that we thought we were gonna be BFFs, but that's life.  You should be happy about the times you had together.  Some people don't even find one good friend in their lifetime.  That's why I'm so happy to have three extremely good friends.    Good luck sweetie and move on.|`|6a56c836d361c3eb479fddc9e9cb02e1aa	She will always be your friend as long as you accept that she is creating a new life for herself.  Grow with her and not apart from her.  Create your new memories and share them with her.  You can still be close, but things have and will continue to change.|`|JERUmEFzaa	Well maybe you should let go. I know how that feels when someone hurts you like that. Stop talking to her and she will really miss you if you want to do that. Try to be strong sweetie. If you can call her and you start to ask what you guys want to do with your friendship try your best not to cry because phone is more tough than MSN. Goodluck sweetie. She is more fake than she is real.|`|NEAdKB6haa	This is happening to me too.    Since you're friend was the one who moved, she experienced alot of changes.  Most likely, she changed.  She's still the same person, but her town, friends, house, school, hangouts, etc. changed.  Even though these changes are scary, they're exciting.  She had the chance to reinvent herself.     Also, you changed.  You're partner in crime isn't right next to you.  Most likely, you're better friends with someone else now.      All this doesn't need that she isn't your friend.  Long Distance Friendships are hard.  You both really need to work on it.  :)  texting and calling are good.      In the end, if you drift away from this friend, remember that lessons about friendship she taught you and the memories you shared.    I hope it works out :)|`|pZxeStPpaa	sweety, there are alot of things in life that we realize one by one. As far as i know, people that i consider my so called best friend, weren't really my best friends. I mean they were never there for me when i needed them. One of my close friends moved to canada, and we would talk on msn the first 4 months and now i do not even if she is alive. things change and people change with time. You should be happy that you two are still in touch. what matters the most is the impact you made in her life.

Start off slowely kissing, start stripping and work your way through it :]|`|m3RGMBcTaa	Don't know if this helps but cosmopolitan.com (like the magazine) has wicked good "make him see stars" advice and kind of how to gauge exactly what he wants. Good luck, I think it's awesome that you waited till marriage!

GsrLh50laa	Your fiance can get the legal forms and instructions he needs to prepare the revocation power of attorney forms he needs to file to revoke his mother's standing as his power of attorney at - http://www.legalformsbank.biz/powerofatt...|`|5jMNBO2naa	1. sign a pre nup, this should get the mother somewhat at ease    2. have him go for a competency trial, where he can determine his compensating and petition for release of power of attorney from the mother    3. no matter what, the mother will always guard him, and very well may cut him out of the will, inheritance is not a birthright    4 .are you prepared to fully support him if he is cut off?|`|ddP3klT3aa	I think you should leave him. You sound too young for marriage any ways. You don't need to be his power of attorney until you have been married at least 10 years any ways. He knows how to change it, he just probably doesn't want you to be it. Is he under 18? If so, there is nothing he can do.|`|LVlS4y7Caa	Not sure how stable your guy is at this juncture, but if he marries you, the power of attorney can change once you're his wife.  Get some legal advice on this but remember, your boyfriend is fragile and it made sense to put her in charge at the time - and may just still make sense, dunno.  Do know you need some legal input here on what happens if you marry and if your marriage status supercedes this power of attorney in any regard...    Sincerely,    Grace|`|SovaFpN8aa	Ask yourself, if he was cut off from his money, and just the two of you were living on your own, would the two of you be able to make it, financially and emotionally? If you two can't make it without the family's money, then you need to look a little deeper into why you want to be with him so bad. The money is not his, it's his family's. By your description he maybe too emotionally fragile to live on his own, away from his family and their money. Would you be able to financially support both of you, and take care of him emotionally? The only way to live without interference from his family might be to move out on your own, and leave the money behind.
ZEqimGrHaa	seriously u got DDR on your Ipod touch? I tried that on my cuzins and it didnt work either...ur not alone :S
domEftoIaa	the best thing for you to do is either tell him that you don't want to talk to him anymore or you could just ignore him. maybe he will realize that maybe he does love you. good luck!!!
q1pwHXrMaa	Give her time....you cant rush something like this. She knows how you feel. Best thing you can do is cont. to be her friend. I understand that you want more but pressuring her can only make go in a bad direction.|`|3IRnGPAcaa	Action, action, action!!!! show her.|`|zhrakR9Aaa	No this is a timely process, you just need to show her and resure her that if you guys were to break up you guys would still be friends. Because for her its that she doesnt want to ruin the friendship she has with you now that how it is for most girls. I 've even had to go through it its a difficult choice|`|a6027bf9d22f998982bf0cd0321588fbaa	dont listen to the girls, forget all the romantic stuff u have to open up to her tell her everything, let her tell u everything, make more physical contact, when something is funny lie ur head on her shoulders and etc. its all good there|`|cdXMQai8aa	Well for me. I would know if a guy was truly in love with me when they walk all the way to my house in the rain and by the time they get to my door step they are soaking wet and they say "I love you" =]]      THAT'S    LOVE.    HUN.    =]  ?|`|sZePlWTQaa	Actions speak louder than words.|`|ycNxVrUfaa	Respect her. Actions speak louder than words.|`|6ucVuo10aa	do something really romantic for her......:)|`|9580a1e44dd3d2bae7d2f867611ab353aa	? Just give her some time, remain best friends, and hopefully she will see you the same way you see her and realize that you'd be a great couple. She just may not be where your at yet (emotionally and all). If its meant to be, it will be, just give it some time.
uvWuVWb1aa	I would rather do something fun than overly romantic. Flowers and candy are sweet, but after a few years it gets old because you already expect to get them. Last year, we went and ate at The Melting Pot, a fondue restaurant. It was really fun! Then we went and rode go karts on an inside track. It was a blast!|`|rcut6bhoaa	Try this: Send her out for a small errand, put a bunch of Hershey Kisses from the entry door, through the house (make a trail with notes along the way) with the first one saying " I KISS THE GROUND YOU WALK ON" Other notes along the way, maybe to the bedroom. Flowers too.     Be creative for your own likings (and hers). Maybe even cook a nice candlelight dinner for her too.    Sometimes it not what you buy her, but the effort and your own creativity that makes things worth there while.|`|6ucVuo10aa	candy,poem,flowers......and i love you would be just fine|`|rrc0ZUeXaa	if you known her long enough send panties that arrive every month from http://herpantyclub.com|`|QkYRnTPIaa	Draw a great big heart in lipstick on the rear window of your wife's car saying "Big Bill loves Mrs. Bill" It would really be a surprise to her if you could draw the heart while she's at work so everyone will see it before she does.  I guarantee you it will melt HER heart!
