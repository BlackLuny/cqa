20090308030253AAlPZUB	Society & Culture;Etiquette	I need your opinion here. I was embarrassed this morning by one of the managers at work. and it is bugging me?	Please advise? I am questioning myself      This morning there were a lot of email messages (more than five) between me and a manager from another dept      it was back and forth... more like conversations than email messages (hence the back and forth all morning)      One of my replies was:      “Hello there…   No I am not working on that brief :-)       Then my name and contact details"      One of the managers (not my direct manager) was CCed on the email. She came to my desk and said out loud.. .why did you write "Hello there..." this is not professional its wrong, you should not talk to a manager like that its really wrong and shows you're losing your temper, you are not professional and you are offensive and rude yada yada yada....      I got lost, I told her I added a smile face at the end which totally states otherwise, that I did not lose my temper and I was not angry at all. It was more of a conversational email messages since it was going back and forth and there was no need to address the person every single time!      but she just kept going at it in front of everyone in our dept + the other dept near by! Everyone was looking at me!      Now thats unprofessional if she really wanna talk professionalism! Right?      1. Shes NOT my manager   2. She should have taken this in private and not in front of everyone (keep in mind it was NOT her call)   3. The recipient of the email did not complain, as a matter of fact me and her are on very good terms and I like her a lot   4. It was not a "starter" email... it was more of a conversational email messages all morning between me and her, so there was no need for me to be addressing her in every single message specially when she is FINE with it      Now tell me honestly if I was wrong in any way... If I emailed one of you as my manager with "Hello there" would you take it the wrong and offensive way? Specially if there were like 5 or 6 emails going on before that?      I am willing to take the bullets! Shoot?

20090308031616AAAsGHv	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Does Islam *literally* mean peace?	I have seen many Muslims make this claim on this site. Arabic is my third language, but I know that Islam mean *submission* while *Salam* means peace.      I have seen others claim that Islam is means peace because it is derived from the same root word, however, "loving" and "loveless" derived from the same root word (love) but they mean entirely different things.      So, my question is, is there any linguistic source to the claim that Islam *literally* means peace?

Not sure how to phrase this... basically I have been living in a shared house since November, with my housemate and the landlady, who is lovely. Around a month ago my housemate and I started seeing each other, and I don't know whether to tell my landlady as it is her home and she has the right to know what's been going on, in case she is not OK with it. We are spending every night together but then he has to sneak downstairs the next day, She might already have figured it out, as we are not exactly 'quiet' (aherm) sometimes. How should I broach the subject, or is it none of her business anyway as long as we are paying the rent etc? What should we do if she is uncomfortable with the situation? We both love the house and don't want to move out but we don't want to make her uncomfortable as she is really nice but might not like the situation.

20090308032056AArI3x9	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	How weird do you think I am?	I'm random.   Anyway, I'm a thirteen year old girl, and I love my scars that I have. I like to remember how I got them. I feel they are like stories written on my body that will be with me for a while. Most of the scars remind me of some of the best times in my life.   I also think about death a lot, but not in the suicidal way, of course. I think about what actually happens when you die. I have theory that heaven and god are actually large sources of energy that our souls go to when we "die" and that our souls eventually go to a new host.   I also think too much. I feel as if I'm an adult trapped in a kids body.    I also think that I might have two personalities. I'll say one thing, then say another, and not be sure which one I meant. I'll also fight with myself, but I think it's just decision making.   That's just a little but about me.   Every one I know thinks that I am the weirdest person in the world, and I also agree that I am weird, but surely there are weirder people out there.   So what do you think?

How many years did the Prophet, peace be upon him, call the people to Islam?      13) What does the last sentence of the ebook say?      Let's see how well we do!

20090308034812AADvbIg	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Why do so many people think that the dead are already in heaven/hell?	I'm going to suspend my disbelief for a moment. Ordinarily I'd not worry about this as I'm sure enough to bet anything you like that there is no afterlife. But I feel like playing religion's advocate today, so let's just suppose, hypothetically that there is a heaven and there is a hell.       According to the nicene creed, everyone ultimately gets judged on how they lived their life and based on that judgement allocated a place in either heaven or hell for all eternity. But that judgement hasn't happened yet. On domesday when it's time to do the judging, all the dead will be raised and everyone, living or dead at that time will be judged. So at the moment, no-one's been judged. And the dead are just in the ground.      Basically, according to the bible, there's no-one watching over anyone from heaven, or burning in hell for that matter. All that's still to come.      Of course from the point of view of someone who has died, time would pass unnoticed for them, so it would seem to them like they were going straight to heaven or straight to hell, as if they were in stasis, or time-travelling into the future when judgement happens. But for those of us still alive we know that heaven and hell are just sitting and patiently waiting for them for the moment         And yet so many people talk about their lost loved ones looking down on them from heaven (or Jerry Falwell burning in hell for that matter) when it's not actually happening yet.      So, what I'm asking is a) (if you're not one of these people yourself) why do you think so many people believe this in contradiction with what's written in their holy book?      or if a) doesn't apply to you, b) if you believed this up 'til now - has this question changed your mind or do you have a reason to believe it still, and if so, what is it?

20090308043752AAzx78p	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Help please from Scientific and Religious people?	I was christened at birth but Religion has not played a big part in my life. Upon recent interest I've discovered that I am certainly not of Christian faith.    Over a short period of time I've been Theist, Atheist and now I'm teetering on Deism as its the closest to what I would say are my beliefs.    As an Atheist I was happy with the scientific evidences as to the creation of the universe and still am as far back as the evidence goes. As there are still too many unanswered questions and incomprehensible reasons as to how, when and why it all began I am happy in the thought that there is some form of Deity present, one that resembles that of the Deism faith but to a lesser extent. As in I still favour the majority of scientific reasons as to the creation of the universe rather than that of a Deity. But i can't believe in the 'Big bang' (something from nothing) theory anymore than I can a Deity creating the universe.    What I do believe in is some kind of postulated preternatural being that has infinite understanding of us and the universe but has no intervention whatsoever.    My main question being..........Is this belief closet to Deism as it is to any other Religion?   And, as an afterthought, what are your views on my beliefs?

According to Gulf Arabs, Asians are poor, tacky people who wear gaudy clothes, dance around and sing frequently, have smelly bodies and smelly food, are liars and cheaters in business, and are basically less valuable as human beings. It is common in conversation, and also commonly seen in Gulf television serials (hmmm, and there are racist jokes and racial stereotypes replete in Indian entertainment as well, just think about how any minority group, say Sikhs, are treated in Hindi movies, balle balle)---there is no sense of political correctness whatsoever. It is definitely part of the culture. In addition, there are strictly compartmentalized groups to which locals and expats belong to, and people don’t mix socially very often

20090308045315AAQP4lg	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	Why don't you have a good day for once?	Ok, so most of the time, we hear from people who need their problems sorted out on here. Well, I'm here to add something a bit different - I want to tell people about how my life is going.      My name is Renae and I live in Australia. I'm sixteen in April and so far this year, almost everything has been great.      I just started year eleven, meaning a heck of a lot of homework. In some of my subjects (especially Literature) I think I'm failing, but the others (English 2A, Photography, Media, Drama and Info Tech Multimedia) I'm passing.      On my first day of school, I met Brandon. He was cute (ok, more than cute - he's gorgeous!) and really nice, and I pretty much turned to goo every time he looked at me. The second week into school, he asked me out, and I said yes. We have been dating ever since, I love him with all my heart, and he is honestly the sweetest boy I have ever dated (he's the opening doors for you, carrying your bag for you, always able to tell when you're upset kind of guy, just to make the girls reading this drool XD).      At the end of last year, I had depression and I cut myself. I'm now past this, and I don't want to die. I want to live, I look forward to the day, and I love my friends and family. I'm also a lot more confident than I was this time last year, and I don't care what people say about me, because I know who I am and what's true or not.      Since I moved schools for this year (the last one I was at only went to year 10), I've been a lot happier. I met Brandon, made a bunch of new friends, and the best part is, most of the old gang I was with last year is at my new school, and it's so good. I'm so happy here.      Also, on Wednesday I won an Apple Macbook Pro! I'm so excited about it! The only sad bit is that I have to wait for it to come, and that will take two months maximum. =[      I'm also involved in a film and television group. I'm going to be involved in a television show!      So, yes. Life is very good.         People, you should always look at the good things in your life before you broadcast it to the world on Yahoo! Answers.      Have a good day! =] xxx      Renae

Hi, I'm a native Filipino, I can speak English and Filipino, even Ilocano (a dialect here in Philippines) Currently, I'm having my college degree here in Manila---B.S. Information Technology.       I'm 18 now, and I'll be 19 on the 24th, exactly 1 year since i start studying french.. I immerse my self the best i can. during the vacation, i'm in front of my laptop playing audio cds,i spend 10 hours a day while reading the contents on the book, i memorize the French National Anthem and Canadian National Anthem (french and english version), i learn disney songs which are french translated and some songs played in radio stations in France. I changed my laptop and mobile phone language to French. I browse so many many websites for podcast, and streaming lessons, like BBC-MA FRANCE, youtube, etc.But when our classes begin, i minimize my study habits in french to an hour a day for 3 hours a week. I'm working on the French grammar for now, but my problem is i want to be a perfect accented french speaker... i don't want to be noticed like a trying hard speaker, whenever i speak now, it sounds correct but noticeably not a native one... help me!!!!          p.s. i really want this, though it's far away from my course Information Technology.. i want to work in France or Canada as i graduate next year!!! does it matter???

20090308052327AAnUM8F	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Christains why is Christianity dead now? I went to church tonight and this pastor?	never mentioned sin or hell once. he was saying giving into temptation and not repenting will not make you prosper, something like that. He never mentioned about hell for those who continue to live in sin and when I mentioned this to one lady in church she said nothing and walked away. do they not like the truth? also there is not many pastors who preach what God wants them to preach why is this? this is sad. and most churches are dead to the core. yes the music is god sometimes but the sermons I could just walk out and not go back. The pastor was also talking about oh the next generation and the next etc and I was saying to myself out loud Jesus would have returned by then. and in this generation too. but these Christians are blind. I do not like going to church now because most of them do not preach the truth. so christians I need to know if this is happening in your church too? Most churches are making God angry.

20090308002938AA8oGCt	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Creationists: Why do you accept the atheist scientist lie of gravity theory?	Didn't "goddidit"?      Gravity theory is a prideful, arrogant assumption that scientists have been forcing onto us and brainwashing us to believe.      We can't see it, taste it, touch it, smell it.  Not even ONCE has someone seen gravity.  It is a RELIGION.  That's what it is.      The gravitinism religion contradicts the earth being made before the sun, as the Bible so clearly says:   Psalm 104: 5: "...who laid the foundations of the Earth, that it should not be removed for ever."   1 Chronicles 16:30:  "Fear before him, all the earth: the world also shall be stable, that it be not moved."   Ecclesiastes 1:5:  "The sun also ariseth, and the sun goeth down, and hasteth to his place where he arose."      How ridiculous is it that scientists would assume planets, stars, and moons, orbit larger bodies because of the gravitinism and "physics" and those other anti-God lies.     The earth doesn't orbit the sun because of gravitinism... that's too naturalistic.      Plus, I heard that Einstein recanted on his deathbed, which automatically makes the general theory of relativity false.      goddidit.  Why do you buy the scientists' lie of gravity theory? it's just a THEORY.

Brits - Imagine an employment culture where employment is entirely 'at will'. That is, you can be sacked for 'good cause, bad cause or no cause' immediately without notice or severance pay. You have no protection, employment rights or form or redress. You're fired, there's the door, no arguments, no debate, no nothing.      US - Imagine that to sack anyone you have to wade through employment protection legislation a mile high, follow an exhausting process and still risk getting sued blind at an Employment Tribunal if you have acted in any way unfair - and where the burden of proof is reversed so the employee doesn't have to prove you were unfair, you have to prove you weren't.

He hears something that is somehow sounds like my name, so he repeats it and bolds the sound of my name and looks at me.   ANYWAY, it's already confusing, I think that I'm over him but I don't understand what the hell he wants from me?   He didn't tell anyone about what I told him.   But, in my acting classes (he is also there), he was behind me with his friend, so he called me by name, I turned around and I see him changing tshirt, so then I turn around to do my own stuff cuz I'm not interested, so he screams to me "Heyy.. Sam, don't faint...".   Other day, he said "Sam..," I turned to him, and asked him "what" then he asked me what's up.. I said fine.. and he just kept staring at me, so I said "what??" he said "nothing".

I believe that we are born with evil within us and humans naturally want control and things their own way.  All wars are over humans because they all believe their religion is the right one.  God says dont murder but they all go to war against each other and kill.  I have been reading up on prophecies in the bible and although we are seeing the world go madder by the day this isnt because the bible tells us so.  The bible is a fable.  yes we see more wars more earthquakes and possibly a world war 3 not because the bible says but because we have more people in the world and knowledge has increased.  One prophecy that gets me is babylon will fall.  So man puts this to mean america britain and all the west.

In some of my classes I have heard about trans people wanting to not be reduced to their gender and complaining about the lack of acceptance in the queer and hetero community. So I guess I'm wondering if that applies to themselves as well? If trans people are fighting for all this acceptance- are they practicing what they preach? I've looked around and asked around and found NO trans who date other trans. I'm just wondering what other people think of this- though I am mostly looking for a trans persons perspective.

20090308065207AAXR8K5	Society & Culture;Languages	How to improve my english pronunciation?	First of all, I am Hard of Hearing and I use American Sign Language to communicate in school. I have an interpreter and I rarely talk to anyone at school. Not because I don't want to but because  they  don't understand me. I don't have a deaf voice at all, I just want to speak english well. I speak french at home. Well, some of my french pronunciations aren't that good. I never had a formal oral pronunciation. If I wasn't sent to a deaf school or didn't learn sign language, I would speak it well. The more I sign, the less I talk. And when I talk, I can't remember how to pronounce english words and people always said "what?". after graduation, I don't want an interpreter anymore. My counselor forced me to have one but I said no. I want a speech therapist, CART and a tutor. Watching movies or listening to songs doesn't help because I can hear but I don't understand. I really didn't want to be in a deaf community, there's nothing wrong with deaf people but I live in hearing world and not everyone knows sign language so I need to speak clearly so people can understand me. I feel like being in a deaf world ruins my life.

I just got back from holiday and for the first week back she was being very flirty and affectionate toward me like usual and all seemed fine.      We're not in a relationship but we sorta go on dates and both like each other.      However last time we hung out for lunch she was very flirty but then since that day she has been weird to me. So im thinking i did something that day?      She is now inviting friends to our dates and referring to me as "friend" or "buddy" so its a very obvious change in attitude from 1 week ago where it seemed like things were progressing quite romantically.      Was it because im being too slow? Or do u think the fact that she asked about me hooking up in the holidays with people and i said yes? She does as well though, we both do... Was it because she invited me out and i couldnt because i had other plans?      What would have caused this change in attitude?

20090308033939AAzzgO4	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	To those who think an afterlife gives life a True Meaning:How much do you think you'll remember from your life?	I'm an atheist. When I die, it ends for me. I hope to be so lucky to some day have the chance to look back on my life from my deathbed. I'll remember most details: the good and the bad. Lots of amazing memories, some sad. But all extremely meaningful, to me.      Yet, as an atheist I always have to read in this section how "God" gives life meaning. True meaning to life comes from God, who gives you an infinite afterlife.      So, serious question: after 17,000,000,000,000 years in Heaven, when you'd look back on things, how much do you honestly think you'll remember from these measly 80 years that you said had so much True Meaning?

That is my reason for being a life long bible student.      It seems to me we need more that 1000 years, but I am sure Jesus   knows how to get it all done in that time, Rev.20:1-6,12,13.

20090308053201AAHcN0D	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	I'm an idiot, aren't I? why didn't i see it before?	Well, it's pretty long, but i have so much going on in my mind. From coursework, to preparing my portfolio for university interviews, my grandfather passed away last year, things have been hard for me recently.   Three nights ago however, i had a dream i was walking down the stairs at home and when i opened the bathroom door, i saw myself crying in the toilet and i screamed before my alarm went off. I knew from this, something bad was going to happen.   Then, two days later, I went to a museum with my friend and I was carrying an extra bag for my coat (it was chilly). After the museum trip, she had to go home and for some reason, i wanted her to go, and it was almost like i was protecting her from something because normally, i would have wanted her to stay longer.    Anyway, so i walked around a bit more and went to a shop, looked around and walked out. Strangely though, at the back of my mind, i was thinking to myself (wouldn't it be scary if the alarms went off) that would be my worst nightmare. The idea of theft frightens me.   Going into the next store made all the sense, and made sense of what my dream really meant. I bought a pair of trousers from there but somehow a pair of tights got stuck on my bag (no idea how!!!) and when I walked out of the shop, the alarms went off. I was in complete shock!. They opened the bag and it was right on the top of the bag. Then, i thought my life was over.   They called security, while i was practically s*****ing myself in shock how it magically appeared there and security took me to the back of the store. They then forced me to pay for it and I said that I had no idea how it got on the top of my bag and if i did want to steal it, i would have taken off the tag, hidden it deep inside my bag and stolen it properly, so hey! how could they believe that, even though it was true.   So i kept telling them 'i had no idea it was on the bag' which of course sounds ridiculous, but it was 100% true. The security guy said ' I'm just trying to do my job' in a rather sympathetic manner. They then threatened me and said 'pay for it, or we'll call the police'. That's when i was really 's****ing myself. So I tried to find anything to pay with (change) because i had no money. I spent my last ￡20 on the trousers. Luckily, i had enough coins to make ￡9 whatever it was and paid shaking like a chicken.   If i didn't have that money, i would have been ruined forever. Anyway, then they made me sign some form and banned me from all of that branches stores in the whole country, which when i heard, i couldn't believe. The woman said to me 'Even if you try to come in once, you will be arrested, not even 10 times, or 5 times, Do you understand me?' I wanted to slap her round the face. She was practically laughing at me. A pair of tights that magically appeared there- a complete accident caused all of this. My face is now recognized according to the staff, and i will be arrested if i enter another one of those stores again.   I was so upset and in such shock that walking out of the store with one bought item and one item that i must have accidentally took (i don't even remember it though) made me feel like an idiot. I cried all the way home, which again sounds stupid and when I got home, my parents believed me and were relieved i didn't get arrested.   Was it one of those 'wrong place at the wrong time things' or was it just supposed to happen?    i feel like such a loser, i don't think i can bear going anywhere anymore, except college.

Some web sites say one timing and the other web givs me a timing of 30mins difference so can you tell me any web sites which are known to be correct for prayer timings

"BUT", there is something like 1/500- 1/1000 people born with XYY syndromes each day.      So if people with XYY syndromes in prison are equal to those with normal male chromosomes, then it would mean that that majority of XYY male are in prison....      I mean look, lets say this as an example:- "The number XYY men on earth is 20,000 and the number of XY men are 80,000, so if 10,000 men from both parties end up in jail, it would mean that *HALF* (1/2) the amount of men with XYY sydromes ends up in jail and only 1/8 men from the XY population ends up in jail....      Am I rite?      Pls take it easy and correct me if I'm wrong man, lol, note that I'm just 14...

Occasionally at bedtime, when it is very quiet in the house, I will notice an annoying "ringing" in my ears.  I seem to recall hearing somewhere that this is a bad symptom, and plan to visit the doctor for it.  Has anyone experienced this?  Is it as severe of a symptom as to be permanently damaging to the ear?  Or is it sometimes a treatable condition?

20090227140152AAEzNsX	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	I'm creating a new religion and want some feedback?	Okay now I'm still working on it. So far I have some Guidelines (not complete) so please rate them and help me vote for a name. I have a few and also need to know if other religions have these names. so here are the guidelines so far.       1. If there is/are higher being(s)/gods, then let us hope that they/it understand(s) our logic over blind obedience.   2. Violence is never the answer but is a final solution.   3. Worries over unrecorded pasts and unpredictable futures are useless as they will lead to selfharm and pain.   4. Use of drugs(both legal and illegal) is not strictly forbidden but generaly frowned upon due to the destruction of body and mind; unless for greater health benifits in which natural cures should be sought first.   5. Your body is important such that unhealthy substances consumed such as processed, sugary, fatty, alcoholic, or parasitic should be in moderation or complete absence all together.   6. Personal sexuality i.e. gender prefrences, philias, and such are perfectly acceptable unless it causes harm to oneself, others, or is illegal.   7. Free thinking, as well as questioning why's and how's, should occur at least once a day to ensure the protection of ones individuality and intelect is secured.   8. Worldy possesions lead to greed, envy, jealousy, and exesive pride and should be kept minimal and to one's self to prevent such feelings.   9. One's personal beliefs should never be forced upon another but rather to such others the possibilities.   10. Self needs and others needs should balance out to ensure one's personals are met as well as others, but limit in the form of charity and more as helping create a path for others to help themselves.   11.Men and Women have and never will be truly equal either physically or mentally as will children, elderly and other species. For each person has unique and different qualities that make each individual perfect in their own way.   12. In accordance to 11. although none are equal all individuals should be treated equally despite age, race, religion, gender, intellect, physicallity, or political choses.      That's all I have so far.as for names.         Extrico Sententias.

20090308053449AAKzPfn	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Did the pre-islamic muslims worship Allah?  And if so was Mohammed a reformist rather than a revolutionary?	The pilgrimage to the Kaaba in Mecca was a major thing for the pre-Islamic arabs.  It was one of the main obstacles to the people of Mecca accepting Islam, because it brought so much trade and wealth to the town.      Mohammed said that the Kaaba (the big square thing they all walk around) was founded by Abraham, and when the muslims first went inside it, they found pictures of Mary and Jesus (or something like that).      So my question is, if the pre-Islamic arabs were worshipping in a way Abraham started and Allah wanted them to by doing the pilgrimage and walking round the Kaaba, what was wrong about their religion?  Was it just the fact that they were worshipping idols?  Had they merely strayed from the message given to them by Abraham, in the same way the Jews did when Moses caught them worshipping a golden calf?  And was Mohammed just setting them back on the right path again?      Also can anyone recommend any good books on the pre-Islamic arab religion?

20090308041326AAve5bC	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Is society the way it is because of greed?	think about it if we didn't want more we would never work, we would be content with whatever we had and essentially dislodge ourselves from the broader system of trade (which is exactly what happens in an economic recession). if this happened too often trade would slow to an irreparable halt, industry would collapse and governments/power groups lose their ability to influence through tax, interest rate cuts or anything to do with the financial system. if people didn't work and the government couldn't tax the only other option to get what you wanted would be through conquest, and that would mean war. but if people at the top were not greedy either there would be no war, and with nothing to gain by banding together we would separate out and become as our ancestors had been for millenia before us, small, like-minded groups taking what we needed from the land for our own personal use and nothing more. there would be no incentive to work more or for anyone else or to spend money to buy new things because we'd be content with whatever we had. our progress as a society would decline sharply, and we'd return to antiquated beliefs about life and the world we lived in. I really believe a large part of how we live is because we're not satisfied (or have been indoctrinated not to be satisfied) with what we already have, and so always want more. but of course more does not necessarily equal better, and I think most religions have an implicit understanding of this and that's why they advocate simple living.
20090308054050AAc5ZTv	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Other - Cultures & Groups	Would you call this racist, inappropriate or perfectly acceptable?	At work we have an annual winter carnival.  Every year there are themes and each department picks something from the theme.  This years theme was around the world in 90 minutes.  Everyone had to pick a country to represent.  Well one section picked China.  During the entire event they kept talking in a fake Chinese accents and made reference to many of the standard stereotypes.  They brought a dog on the opening parade with them and claimed they were taking it to the kitchen.  What really got me was during the skit segment they went over the top with the comments.  IE Chicken Fried Lice (among other "funnies"  based on some difficulties with the English language)  at that point I left the room.  I was dismayed at how many people were laughing and thought this was the funniest thing they ever saw.  All that kept running through my head was the movie Dragon the Bruce Lee Story.  When Bruce and the girl he was courting (his future wife) were in a movie theatre and the stereotyped Asian came on the screen, the whole theatre started to laugh, everyone but Bruce, when his lady friend saw this she took him out of the theatre and learned a valuable lesson.      What do you think?  Was this behaviour acceptable?  Racist?

20090308014421AA0u7I3	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	T or F? As long as someone can profit from religion, it will always exist in a capitalistic economy.?	Profit includes, economic, political, social, psychological, etc. Ancient history shows that the religious leaders profitted via prestige. Their prestige garnered them stability when they were sorely ignorant of science, etc. Religion provided them with easy answers to unanswerable questions in their era... unanswerable questions that ordinarily would have left them looking impotent as a powerful leader/ruler. The followers gained a feeling of security and structure to some degree, some would suggest that it was a blind security, supported by the blind faith of their religious leader.      The same game is played today, except that some nations have chosen to reward religious leaders by labeling them as non-profit business owners, so they can receive tax exemptions, etc. The followers are able to tithe, which is tax free money that goes directly back to the people of the church in which they invest.      In short, if one were looking for a tax shelter, they'd become religious, and place all of their tithe into a church fund, that is willing to give them material benefits in return, i.e., the use of a church car, buildings to host parties, etc., for special occassions, socials where refreshments are served and the members who attend are hand-picked/selected.      I know this sounds anti-intuitive, but... if someone really wanted to derail religion, they'd push every tom, dick, and harry to throw a shingle out of their door, and claim church status, and increase the tax burden of the nation. If everyone is getting away with stuffing money into tax shelters, etc., then the country would no longer be capable of offering such a benefit.      As long as there are Atheists, etc., who aren't profiting from such economic tactics, there will always be a pool of citizens that a nation can count on to make up the tax losses - the Atheists etc.

I totally agree with the message below.   Let's stand for what we believe in and stop the mockery of Jesus Christ our Savior. Where do we stand as Christians? At the risk of a bit of inconvenience, I'm forwarding this to all I think would appreciate it too. Please help us prevent such offenses against our Lord. It will take you less than 2 minutes! If you are not interested, and do not have the 2 Minutes it will take to do this, please don't complain when God does not have time for you, because He is far busier than we are.   A disgusting film set to appear in America later this year depicts Jesus and his disciples as homosexuals! As a play, this has already been in theatres for a while. It's called Corpus Christi ' which means 'The Christ Body.'  It's revolting mockery of our Lord. But we can make a difference. That's why I am sending this e-mail to you. If you do send this around, we will be able to prevent this film from showing in America and South Africa.   Hey, it's worth a shot! Apparently, some regions in Europe have already banned the film. All we need is a lot of prayer and a lot of e-mails. Remember, Jesus said 'Deny Me on earth and I'll deny you before my Father' "

20090227134630AAOXWDd	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	Has religion closed the door which was open sometime, and which we try to open for  years  now?	We all know that the highest and most  important  goal of all minority's is  to be  accepted equally without being discriminated or something else that is most likely  to be  negative. So, I was sitting in a philosophy class, and while  listening  it  turned out  that at the  time of  the big era of Greek philosophy it was  completely normal to be gay, to have a  boyfriend.   A big Greek warrior said " why shouldn't I like  something  that is  beautiful".   But it all ended in when the church appeared, and everything that has to  do with homosexuality was forbidden and to be punished. I do believe  in God, and I am a  Muslim, but at  some  point I really  begin to think, can it  really be. Something that proposes tolerance has crushed  it  from it's first appearance. I hope nobody feels in some way offended, It  wasn't my  intention to cause that, but we are here to exchange opinions.      So what do you think?

I've been reading up on the Jewish faith lately because I've never felt comfortable being a Catholic and Judaism seems very open and nice for me. There are only two issues with me:      1.) I'm a confirmed Catholic. I feel I made the choice too early and it was chosen for me (we had to do it in school when we were 13.)   2.) I have tattoos, none are religious, and I plan on getting more.   (Ami James from Miami Ink is Jewish and he is COVERED in them so I'm extremely confused.)

20090308013655AAzkctG	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	What to do if sexually harassed at school? What should Christian girls do?	I am a new asian student at my current high school. I just turned 18 a couple weeks ago, and I am a high school senior.       I know that I should be aware of the various ways of what to do when I am sexually harassed- but, I grew up in a very small town and being a minority group, and a young Christian member of my church- most of the students at my high school often-and always- have never harassed me in anyway.      But, moving to another state and moving into a big city- a lot of the male students here make disgusting remarks about me, and sexually harass me. I feel very uncomfortable, and I have no friends who can accompany me to classes- so I feel very scared sometimes. Friday was the first time I had been very scared to walk home.      I don't have anyone close to talk about this with, and I don't know any administrators or counselors at my school that I would be comfortable to share this with. I have recently just joined a new church- and I haven't yet felt comfortable enough to confide in my youth president (whom is also a girl) or any other of my sisters-in-Christ of how to deal with sexual harassment as the Lord sees is right.       Should I just forgive them and move on?      I know I'm acting like a coward- but, what should I do? I haven't ever been sexually harassed before, and I honestly don't know what to do about it. It scares me.       I know that I am not leading them on because:   1- I don't wear skimpy clothes, nor acts like one.   2- I don't respond to their comments; I put my mp3 on LOUD when I'm walking to class just so I have a way of not listening to what they say, and I have an excuse of why I didn't respond.   3- I'm naturally shy, and so I usually bite my tongue before saying something rude- which is a bad quality I must admit..      I know- yes, yes- if I am so naturally shy, etc. then WHY am I going online and asking a whole bunch of people I don't know about a topic I should be asking someone else I know. But please, either way- how should I deal with this? How should a Christian girl/woman deal with sexual harassment as God sees fit? How do I deal with feeling scared at school?       Please, be serious if you're going to respond to my question.      Thank you.

20090308041708AArHDwL	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Magick. Do you know what your asking?	I've seen post after post here concerning people asking,   "What's a good spell?" "Give me something magick".      I don't think y'all know that it doesn't work like that.      Before you even get to the point of manifestation, you need to 'put in your dues'. That means:      Introspection   Being aware of your weaknesses and faults.   Getting a grip on your elementals.    Building your willpower.   Focus.      and Lots and Lots and even a LOT more reading, and understanding the maco and microcosms.      I'm concerned that some of you are on the way to injuring yourself, someone else, or garnering consequences that you have no possible clue how to get out of, and no idea where to go for help.      So, before asking for someone to give you magick, (which they cannot). Would you read further and deeper? Would you please go through the dark night so that no body gets hurt?

With science, at least there's predictability.  A doctor gives you meds that have a track record.      With "belief", there's praying and not necessarily getting what you ask for (the whole "God might not give you the answer you expected" deal).  There's "I wonder if this was a sign".      With all it's unpredictability, I don't understand this "peace" that believers claim to possess.      Thoughts?

20090227143537AASxM23	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	Martin Luther King ..tell me if you like it?	Do you know the name of man that would change American history forever?  He was born in the deep south in Atlanta Georgia, during a time where his color would determine who he was as an American. This extraordinary man was Michael Luther King Jr. later renamed Martin Luther King. Martin lived in a world where being a non-white person was very difficult. Segregation between blacks and whites was intense. Being a Black person in this part of the U.S.A. was especially difficult due to Jim Crow laws, laws that made it impossible for Black people to advance in American society. Though many Blacks at this time period didn’t attend a college due to discrimination Martin later would.   Martin King attended Morehouse College and he graduated in 1948 with a B.A degree. Later on he attended Boston University, completing his residence for the doctorate in 1953 and then receiving the degree in 1955. While Martin King was residing in Boston he met a very intelligent individual by the name of Coretta Scott. They fell in love with one another and they got married. Martin followed his fathers and grandfathers footsteps he became A Baptist minister in 1954. Being a Baptist minister helped him to become more involved with anti-segregation groups. He went and traveled to cities that had segregation and would speak in churches to help fight segregation with non-violence.   By doing this he put his life in danger, but this would not stop him from speaking out.         Though Martin Luther King was targeted for speaking out against injustice he didn’t back down. Racist men who believed non-white people deserved to be treated worse then animals bombed King’s house. Even when the bombing on his house occurred this wouldn’t stop a man who held strongly to the belief that all men are created equal in the eyes of God. Being a strong supporter of peace helped King win the Noble Prize.    He later won the Noble Peace prize for his non-violent approach to stop racism.     Martin Luther King got what he so rightfully deserved in 1964. He won the Noble Peace Prize for trying to end segregation using non-violence. He would use the prize money that he received to further help the civil rights movement. This would also lead him to being picked as TIME’s man of the year in 1964. Though this led him to become one of the world’s most famous men. Martin would not live long enough to see his dream become a reality.    Martin Luther King was killed by an assassin’s bullet in Memphis, Tennessee on the evening of April 4, 1968. This extraordinary man did what most men would not do. He fought the good fight he stood up for those who where oppressed, beaten down and abused by laws that where created by evil men. Martin Luther King would later on become one of Americas most famous Americans. He became so famous that we Americans even now have a holiday on his birthday in remembrance of a man that changed not only American history but also the worlds.

The regional archbishop, Jose Cardoso Sobrinho, pronounced excommunication for the mother for authorising the operation and doctors who carried it out for fear that the slim girl would not survive carrying the foetuses to term.      "God's law is above any human law. So when a human law ... is contrary to God's law, this human law has no value," Cardoso had said.      He also said the accused stepfather would not be expelled from the church. Although the man allegedly committed "a heinous crime ... the abortion - the elimination of an innocent life - was more serious".

Alright, I do believe in Jesus Christ except I'm the type that isn't a huge church goer and not a Catholic that follows the Pope, Lent or anything like that.

Anyway, I always seem to feel like I have a significant purpose and like I'm being guided in the decisions I make.      I know it may sound strange and may just be one of my weirdnesses, but like when I make people laugh, I feel great and like I accomplished something.      Even when I watch Red Skelton, I feel like I know him and like we are brothers or something.      I don't know if it's just fantasizing about being famous or what, but it's like something is telling me, go out and entertain because it is your purpose.      Like I said, is this type of thing common or is it just a weirdness that I have?

20090308010415AABZaTf	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Evidence and the New Testament.?	Evidence of the Reliability of the New Testament:      1. There are 25,000 copies of ancient manuscripts that contain either portion or all of the New Testament. None of them contradict each other. These are also written in different languages, cultures, and times. So that's a lot of room for mistakes when none were found.       Homer's Iliad only has 643 copies. Yet no one seems to doubt what was written by him.       2. Archeology is reliable in the New Testament:      Interesting archaeological finds include:       Pontius Pilate Inscription – oldest appearance of Pilate’s name to be found.   Caiaphas’s Family Tomb – The name of the priest who brought Jesus to trial before the crucifixion was Caiaphas.   Politarch Inscriptions – once though by critics to be a mistake in the Bible, the technical term “politarch” has now been found in several places throughout the Roman empire.   Erastus Inscription – In 1929 archaeologists found a five-foot-long carving of the name Erastus who was the city treasurer in the city of Corinth and mentioned in Romans 16:23       One of the most important Romans historians is Tacitus. In 115 A.D. he recorded Nero's persecution of the Christians, in the process of which he wrote the following:      Christus, from whom the name had its origin, suffered the extreme penalty during the reign of Tiberius at the hands of one of our procurators, Pontius Pilatus, and a most mischievous superstition, thus checked for the moment, again broke out not only in Judea, . . . but even in Rome.{3}      There are over 39 extra-biblical sources that attest to over one hundred facts regarding the life and teachings of Jesus      Some sources:      See "Authority of the Bible" at www.probe.docs/auth-bib.html.    Josephus, Book 18, Chapter 3:3    Tacitus, Annals, 15.44    Julius Africanus, Chronography, 18:1.    Ibid.    William Ramsay, St. Paul the Traveler and the Roman Citizen (Grand Rapids, MI: Baker Books, 1982), 8.    John McRay, Archaeology and the New Testament (Grand Rapids, MI.: Baker Books, 1991), 227.    Norman Geisler, Baker Encyclopedia of Apologetics (Grand Rapids, MI.: Baker Books, 1999), 47.    A. N. Sherwing-White, Roman Society and Roman Law in the New Testament (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1963), 189      I mean the list goes on and on. You can take a look into the Culture side and see the things that Jesus said matched up with the times and the places of the times. His stories told ( ex. City on a Hill cannot be hidden.) Are found to be correct because of the cities that surrouned the Sea of Galilee.      The New Testament in itself and the Gospel's seem to be accurate and have stood the test in History. You can believe what you want about Jesus but it is clear that the authors of the NT knew what they were talking about.       What are some of your thoughts? You can email me for more thought out and organized answers if you wish my friends.

I have also noticed that atheists really make an effort to disprove god. They rant on about Muslims and Christians forcing their beliefs upon them, yet they are doing the exact same thing they complain about. Now belief and one's connection with God, or whatever they want to worship should be personal. If they don't want to believe in anything, I'm sure people would accept it, but why do they make such an effort to bash everyone's beliefs?

After I had shared the above facts with this student, I offered him the following challenge: I said to him, “If you do not believe that the Bible is the inspired word of God, if you do not believe that the Bible is of a supernatural origin, than I challenge you to a test.”  I said to the student, “I challenge you to go to any library in the world, you can choose any library you like, and find 66 books which match the characteristics of the 66 books in the Bible.  You must choose 66 books, written by 40 different authors, over 1500 years, in 3 different languages, written on 3 different continents.  However, they must share a common storyline, a common theme, and a common message, with no historical errors or contradictions.”  I went on to say, “If you can produce such a collection of books, I will admit that the Bible is not the inspired word of God.”  The student’s reply was almost instantaneous, he emphatically stated, “But that’s impossible

So yeah, I've always worried about this problem coming up, and I never want it to, but it's happened two times now already. Two girls have confessed to me that they have crushes on me, but of course, being gay, I can't date them or be in relationships with them. It wouldn't be fair for either of them to be in a relationship where I wasn't really attracted to them. So twice, I've had to just let them know that I was gay and it wouldn't work out, it seems to have let them down gently enough (they were traumatized hearing that but ultimately understood; oh, the poor girls who fall for gay men XD). But I need to know, if I'm ever worried about having to come out to a girl for whatever reason, how else can I let them down gently without hurting them?  Is this the best way to let them down, or is there an even gentler way to do that?

Mine is Blue;   If your first choice is blue: You have a basic need for a calm, harmonious, tension-free existence. You are inclined to be somewhat cautious in the way you dress, act, and speak. You are generally a conscientious worker in whatever it is you do. While you make a loyal and trustworthy friend, you may sometimes tend to be impatient with the ideas of others, especially if they differ from your own. You are skeptical of strangers and prefer people with backgrounds similar to yours.

20090308065031AALaLhf	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	Am I gay or aren't I?	So I have been really disturbed recently. For the longest time I accepted myself as being gay, but now I'm not so sure. Actually, I'm not sure at all.  As a child I was molested twice by women. Years later, I started to develop a sort of interest in guys that progressed to the point of me being sure that I was gay. But here is whats weird. I have NEVER been able to develop a romantic attraction to a guy, just a sexual attraction. But as soon as that sexual fantasy starts coming true, I realize as soon as I'm into it that I don't really like it at, and I just want it to be over. On the other hand I have always been romantically attracted to woman, but the sexual attraction has always been lacking. Is it possible there is some really weird way that the sexual events of my past could confuse me into thinking I am gay when I am not? I made a female friend who I plan on moving in with, and our relationship has grown to where I feel extremely EXTREMELY romantically attracted to her, but there is still no sexual attraction. For the record, I have never explored being sexual with a female since hitting puberty. What could the deal be?

20090308083251AAIWvgc	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Why am I having these demonic dreams?	A few times in the past I have had extremely scary dreams. In one, a demon asked me "you know the way you are wondering about eternal condemnation?" I said yes, the boat capsized and as I began to drown it said "IT EXISTS!". In another, it was the apocalypse. I was in a plane and crashed onto a hill near my house. I went to see if my christian friend was alright but I looked into his living room window and there were just solid nails edging from the back of the room to the window. I looked across the road and identified the muscular entity to be satan himself. He shot me in the dream and I recoiled in real life, as if the physics from the gunshot actually took place.      So last night I was dreaming about an attractive girl (I'm a typical guy) then she suddenly turned demonic. I felt the atmosphere change around me and was scared shitless that it wanted to devour my soul. I tried and tried to wake up but it took so long. When I did eventually wake up I prayed.      Thank you to the previous answerers.      Do not delete my question, I don't see why it should be reported.

20090308073040AAt3wsO	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	What do you think about this?	A scheme in which new hospital patients have their "religious and spiritual care needs" assessed has been condemned by the National Secular Society.      Southampton University Hospitals NHS Trust said people would be asked whether they had "any faith needs that can be supported during their stay".      But the National Secular Society, which defends the rights of non-believers, said the move "misused NHS resources".      It said it sound as though hospital chaplains "were touting for business".      The trust said emotional and psychological care would also be provided and that patients did not have to be religious to receive help.       s part of the new policy, which was launched on Monday, staff will also undergo "appropriate spiritual training" from chaplains.      Earlier, Rev Karen MacKinnon, deputy spiritual care manager, said an internal audit conducted in 2008 showed a large proportion of the trust's nurses "were in favour of more training in this area".      Terry Sanderson, president of the National Secular Society, said: "This sounds like the chaplains in the hospitals touting for business.      "It is a gross misuse of scarce National Health Service resources and an intrusion into the privacy of individuals who are coming to hospital for medical treatment.      "Nursing and medical staff are employed by the hospital to look after people's health, they shouldn't have to take on this burden, too.      "How on earth have we reached the stage that you can't even go to hospital for treatment without having religion foisted on you like this?"      The trust manages four hospitals in the city - Southampton General Hospital, the Royal South Hants Hospital, Princess Anne Hospital and Countess Mountbatten Hospital.

I know this question is a bit crazy, but theres certain parts in the bible which seem impossible to follow, and some contradict the others, i admit that i don't read it much at all, nor do i go to church. But theres stuff like if you call someone a fool, you well be condemned to the fire of hell, if you even think about a girl you like, you've commited lust, turn the other cheek when you are struck (but if i got hit i'd hit back). I'm not an atheist,  i'm a lapsed christian but all of this is really impossible for a human to follow, it is in our nature to think of girls we like, and it is in our nature to defend ourselves while we are attacked. So I ask if anyone has at least some of an idea, about that question, Are we condemned to hell? for being human, and have i stuffed my chances my merely asking this question?

20090308082503AAMJ1Ac	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Why are Christians saying girl who had Abortion is a murderer?	The news story reads as follows   "Girl, 9, aborts twins after rape   March 5, 2009 - 6:15AM   A nine-year-old girl who was carrying twins, allegedly after being raped by her stepfather, has undergone an abortion despite complaints from Brazil's Roman Catholic church.      Police said the stepfather has been jailed since last week.      Abortion is illegal in Brazil, but judges can make exceptions if the mother's life is in danger or the fetus has no chance of survival.      Fatima Maia, director of the public university hospital where the abortion was performed, said the 15-week-old pregnancy posed a serious risk to the 36-kilogram girl.      "She is very small. Her uterus doesn't have the ability to hold one, let alone two children," Maia told the Jornal do Brasil newspaper.      But Marcio Miranda, a lawyer for the Archdiocese of Olinda and Recife in northeastern Brazil, said the girl should have carried the twins to term and had a cesarean section.      "It's the law of God: Do not kill. We consider this murder," Miranda said in comments reported by O Globo.      Calls to Miranda were not immediately returned.      Brazil is home to more Catholics than any other nation.      AP"    Link to story here  http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/news/wor...       So like why is the church up and arms about this? don't they know she might have died if they didn't take the twins? Does the church place a higher value on the unborn child? I don't get it

I remember when I was in primary school I had this friend who really treat me like his best buddy. We are so close that people really thought we are real brothers, is sort of the bromance kind of thing      Every Sunday whenever his father bring him out for entertainment he will never fail to ask me along. Later on he moved house and once in awhile he will contact me and still hang out. However I did not treasure this friendship and thus lost contact.      I wish I had such friend again, a straight guy not gay and always want to hang out together. I'm a gay so will a straight guy want to be so close friend to a gay guy?      Do you have such friend?      How did you guys end up so close?

20090308064725AAitcFl	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Should my family go to church on St Patricks day?	St Patrick was a saint and that makes St Patricks day a church holiday if you ask me. My parents don't think so though. Last year I was like mom we should go to church . She was all Who is filling your head with this church BS!Cant you go out and get f@#$ed up like a normal kid! I was all like mom I am not normal I am more spiritual and have become one with Jesus because I am a surfer! She goes how on earth did I raise such a doosh bag. Then she said something about me eating water and vinigar while her and my Dad had corn beef and cabbage. I said I was going to have fish instead because that is what Jesus would eat and this is a religeous holiday. She just looked disgusted and called for my dad. Now you have to understand my dad. He is 6'6 and drinks beer all day. He has a monkey and works Venice beach as an organ grinder. He smokes cigars, sings songs about getting drunk and having sex, and eats like no one else on the planet. His monkey is a dick too. So my mom tells him I want fish instead of corn beef. He was like no problem. He was cool which is bad because my dad is never cool. He left then and came back with a huge frozen mackerel that was like 4' long. He strapped it between his legs like it was his johnson and started chasing me saying he was going to put it in my butt but not in those words. He was laughing and so was my mom. Then he got tired and threw it at me. Then he goes to the pot where the corn beef was pulls it out and takes a bite, chugs a huge mug of beer and makes out with my mom with beer and corn beef juice running down there faces. So my question is shoud I ask my parents to go to church with me this year?

20090308080711AALonPa	Society & Culture;Languages	Does high vocabulary equate to a good essay?	I've seen people who punctuate every sentence of their essays with sophisticated (often irrelevant...?!) words but with rather average sentence structures. Does that equate to a good essay? It sounds really a bit ridiculous to me... but then...      For instance: (please excuse the weirdness o.o)         " I was beginning to worry for this belligerent bosom of mine who might be turning into an assassin expeditiously. I had plans to massacre all the nettlesome classmates, uncompromising and extremely intransigent teachers as well as the preposterous principal in the past. Now I can comprehend you."       Ohkay... this is just an exaggerated version of a short paragraph wrote to me from someone i know, and i know some parts of it totally don't make sense... but i was just trying to get the point across.       So what is a good essay to you? How to write a good essay?   Why does this problem occur? Overflooding vocabulary?
20090308080858AAakQe1	Society & Culture;Mythology & Folklore	If some wiggles are waggles, and some waggles are ziggles, then some wiggles must be ziggles  - True or False?	Hey Everybody.      I've just come across a question which I thought was simple but am now having second thoughts.   I'm probably making a silly mistake here but this is how i see it.      Question:   "If some wiggles are waggles, and some waggles are ziggles, then some wiggles must be ziggles"   True   False         Option 1      If the Waggles are only found as wiggles too... then some wiggles are also ziggles       TRUE      Option 2      If there are other waggles that are not wiggles aswell then....      it could be the ones which are wiggles aswell which are ziggles   OR   the ziggles could be some waggles which are not wiggles   which would make it false.      But option 2 means we dont know whether the wiggles are ziggles   so the answer is FALSE (because "must" is used)         You could Say false overall because you can come up with a way of wiggles not being ziggles.         but I found the answer to be true later on.   Should I of assumed that the only waggles are wiggles too?. Surely they should of said ... there are    no other waggles, only the ones that are wiggles too.      A response on this silly question would be appreciated.      James B

Well, think about the following article before you answer      IF I WERE THE DEVIL........by Paul Harvey      If I were the devil, I would gain control of the most powerful nation in the world; I would delude their minds into thinking that they had come from man's effort, instead of God's blessings; I would promote an attitude of loving things and using people, instead of the other way around; I would dupe entire states into relying on gambling for their state revenue; I would convince people that character is not an issue when it comes to leadership; I would make it legal to kill unborn babies; I would make it socially acceptable to take one's own life, and invent machines to make it convenient; I would cheapen human life as much as possible so that the life of animals is valued more than human beings; I would take God out of the schools, where even the mention of His name was grounds for a lawsuit; I would come up with drugs that sedate the mind and target the young, and I would get sports heroes to advertise them; I would get control of the media, so that every night I could pollute the mind of every family member with my agenda; I would attack the family, the backbone of any nation. I would make divorce acceptable and easy, even fashionable. If the family crumbles, so does the nation; I would compel people to express their most depraved fantasies on canvas and movie screens, and call it art; I would convince the world that people are born homosexuals, and that their lifestyles should be accepted; I would convince the people that right and wrong are determined by a few who call themselves authorities and refer to their agenda as politically correct; I would persuade people that the church is irrelevant and out of date, and the Bible is for the naive; I would dull the minds of Christians, and make them believe that prayer is not important, and that faithfulness and obedience are optional; Hmmm... I guess if I were the devil, I'd leave things pretty much the way they are. Good day.

20090308085050AAWwtKU	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	Is he bi, and/or attracted to me?	First, we met at a barber shop, the first time i saw him, i really like him, and i noticed he was staring at me a lot. The next day, i had my scooter when i returned to dat shop, then by afternoon at 6 we officially met, hes name is Jay, that very day, we talked for almost 3 hours and we seemed that we know each other well.   He is so sweet to me, and one day i had my camera, dat time he was spontaneous and took a pic of his penis, whoe i was shocked.   after a month we went to a house of one of our friend.   only the two of us drink, almost 14 bottles of beer, i was so drunk, but he was not. when i sleep, he was still awake, guarding me all night, and then in i hugged him, in the morning, he was sitting beside me and staring at me..   We see each other almost everyday, and i always accompany him when he goes home, we both we home at 8.   One day, he said to me, "can u massage me?" i said, i dont like, but he insisted. so i did it, LOL it was fun, he always makes everything funny, and also, he's so narcissistic, and even flirts and clean his face using a spray in front of me, he also wet me using the spray, and we trade many things, like the left of his slipper (which are mine) and my right slipper (which is he's) .      By the way, im 18 and he is 20, LoL, is it Okay?   hmm, i also told him once that, attend my graduation, he just smiled and said "wat am i going to do there?" i simply said, i want you to be there.."   Everytime when we are walking home, im always putting my arms on his shoulder, and he always said "only drunk people do dat.."   and i said, "well, wat do u expect from me? be drunk? and then i play DRUNK, he smiled and said "stop it, ur so stupid.." we laughed and continued walking...   Also, everytime i bring my guitar to dat barber shop, he always borrow it and he want me to teach him how to play..( very romantic moments for me..LOL)   One time, i went there soo drunk, i immediately play with him and tickled him, he was playing with me also, and he lied on the floor, probably bec im tickling him, after a moment, he said, stop it, ur tickling me too much, i stopped...      LoL..
20090308090751AAVnxvr	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Other - Cultures & Groups	Do any Americans feel any remorse for the way they're treated Middle-Easterners, or are they mostly oblivious?	or think they're in the right?         eg., Iraq   The US put Saddam in power, spent billions on shipping him free weapons to fund the Iran Iraq war (until they had the 4rth largest army) so the US could test thier weapons against Russian weapons in live fire conditions. The US treats mid-east people like they are lower than dogs, pushes them into to constant war, assasinates and manipulates thier leaders and then when someone finally fights back against the US they label him crazy and make up more lies to justify themselves.       Afghanistan   Same story for years. The US has been funding civil wars in Afghanistan since it's inception and put it's children through hell.  They loose thier limbs to toy bombs that were put there for a war that was not thiers. Then the US acts like they're crazy.  Hell yes they're crazy. How would you like to be rasied in a society thatt is in a constant state of war for 50 years fighting a war that has been pushed on you by foriegn powers manipulating your government?      Do no Americans feel regret for this? If there are any, don't you think you should appologize? Try to make reparations?
20090308083933AAHleMn	Society & Culture;Languages	Can anyone check my English essay?	English is not my first language. Any suggestions would be appreciated.      "The downside is for example poor infrastructure. Other than that, public transportation isn't good enough from our viewpoint as students; when we go out, our destinations do not go beyond the areas covered by the monorail and bus lines. Outside of the areas, we need to ask our parents to drive us back and forth. Being unable to go anywhere we like without parents' help is a real inconvenience for us students. If there's one thing I want to change about Okinawa, it would be to expand the areas covered by the monorail. Then we would be able to go to many places without the need to own or drive cars, and this would even result in an increased number of tourists coming to Okinawa. Moreover, it would promote construction of new buildings where there's the monorail, and thus boost Okinawa's economy.

20090308090210AADvR2V	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Am I misinterpreting this?	It seems as though Christians believe that God is prior to, and wholly other than creation; and it also seems like Christian Church leaders want to be sure that all Christians believe that.      And so, I’m thinking- perhaps that is because if one ‘confuses’ God with creation itself, then one could be happy here- in creation- with God, and therefore, not a good workhorse waiting to be saved- and then, be with God- in Heaven.      Do you think that I’m misinterpreting this?

For about a year now, the status of my hometown's youth programs have concerned me very seriously. I feel that the lack of activities and programs are a direct link to the rise in crime rates. Drugs, murders, vandalism, etc have sky-rocketed in the past 5 years. Coincidentally enough, 5 years ago, our town Recreation Director retired, leaving the programs to the discretion of the County Rec. Dept. and the local YMCA. This town has almost grown accustomed to the fact that if you are not involved in Dixie Youth baseball, you are not involved at all.       I've been brainstorming the past few weeks to see what programs would benefit the community and it is nearly 100 so far. I've just had one problem, though, I'm not exactly sure how to go about bringing this to reality.      Any ideas would be greatly appreciated.

Do you think all the prisoners are watching the news each day with their mouths open and drooling and banging the tables and fighting each other and saying he's mine "he's mine" hey warden bring him to me!!      Do you think on the first night Jack boy will know the joy of what a tight virgin feels for the first time?      Or do you think they might "initiate" him by breaking his teeth and making him perform hmm you know what on the prisoners?      Do you think eventually after he's been bought a sold and passed around some black guy will make him wear makeup and a dress and call him "Jackline" Hey Jackline Iron ma shirt! or Jackline come make Big daddy happy"      lol!
