20090305075551AA08YD9	Consumer Electronics;Cell Phones & Plans	Instant Messaging charge with AT&T?	Has anyone else had this problem, and how have you resolved it?  Me and my sisters have family messaging unlimited, which we understood to include text, multimedia, AND instant messages with no extra charge for internet.  We've been using it for almost a year and had no problems until suddenly, out of the blue, in November we were charged for internet (only on one phone).  Then in December we were charged for internet on all three phones.      I have been fighting with AT&T for months.  Originally they insisted, quite rudely, that we HAD to be getting on the internet and browsing - which we weren't and never had.  Finally they told us we were being charged for data when we did multimedia and instant messaging.      Where it stands now is that we are able to do multimedia messaging wtihout being charged, but instant messaging we are charged for.  I figured out why my phone (Samsun Propel) was doing it and fixed the problem myself since AT&T didn't know what they were talking about.  My sisters both have RAZRs, though, and I don't know how to fix it on their phones.       I'm very irritated with AT&T, mostly because no one can give me an answer that matches what anyone else is saying.  I just want to be able to use instant messaging like we did before, without being charged, because everyone except customer care, says that's what I'm supposed to be able to do.      Sorry for the long question.  I'm just so frustrated and I'm so ready to switch from AT&T even though we never had a problem with them before November.      Any suggestions?  Advice?

20090305081547AA4V8aE	Consumer Electronics;Cell Phones & Plans	Should I buy Nokia N96 or New Samsung Memoir T929 with 8 mpx Camera?	I personaly like Nokias becuase of its easy operating systems, security, new looks and some other cool stuffs that you have in them. Plus you can install some softwaers that you wish to have as i used to have in N79. But I cant do in Nokia 5300 Express Music anymore. I am trying to buy a new I phone having good Camera and Flash light plus touch screen. The reason I like The new T929 Memoir because it doesnt have keys, no sliding, but i dont know if it either has the capability of downloading and installing softwares or not.   Now i dont know much about these both products. I shall be glad to be guided by people who used it or have been using it.   After reviewing your ideas i will buy one.   Thanks

20090305082944AARALFC	Consumer Electronics;Cell Phones & Plans	HELP! My 18 y/o Son Unknowingly Bought And Sold Stolen Goods on Craigslist?	My 18 y/o high school son was recently arrested on a felony charge for unknowingly buying an outboard motor from a Craigslist post and then refurbished, cleaned it up and posted it for sale. The owner of the stolen property shows up, looks at the motor and returns 2 hours later with the County Sheriff. He was arrested for a felony. He did not get a bill of sale nor does he have the sellers name. I know my son is telling the truth and it frustrates me that I do not know how to help him. He is young and had no idea what was happening, an innocent young man may be ruined for life. I have retained an Attorney but I am searching for any other advice I can get.
