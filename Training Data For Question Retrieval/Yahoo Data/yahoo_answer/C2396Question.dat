20090131082152AAwArGv	Education & Reference;Teaching	Is there a conscious effort by conservatives to make children in public schools memorize rather than think? ?	All of the rhetoric about standardized testing and core subjects seems to be a way getting students to memorize a set of facts and basic skills to make them effective non-questioning workers.        Non-standard answers and efforts at creative thought by students are generally discouraged and sometimes punished.  Whereas verbatim regurgitation is encouraged and rewarded.  This teaching method is prevalent even in most undergraduate colleges and professional schools.      Looking at these educational policies as an objective observer, it seems to be an intentional means by which the wealthy elite maintain control over the masses, since students grow up with the belief that they should unquestionably accept whatever an authority figures tell them to accept?

I have always had trouble getting homework done completely because I am in a special ed class (its only one, its where i get a lot of work done...it gets a very bad rap) and I always assume that I can get it done in that class.

I also should note that I'm a diehard Yankees, Rangers, Jets, and Knicks fan and around this time Yankees season starts, the Rangers  are going to be in the playoffs, and the Jets will be drafting. So that gives me another distraction because lets be honest, I care about that more than school.      So what should I do?

I left three toothbrushes on the toilet, three where i normally put my toothbrush, and three outiside of the bathroom. Daily, I took all the toothbrushes and ran them under distilled water. I prepared the agar, let it set for an hour then rubbed the contaminated toothbrushes on three different petri dishes. But it has been about four days, and no sign of bacteria has come up. How do I scientifically say that it didn't grow. Maybe something like, " No visible bacteria grew in the process. ", or something like that. I need to put it in my conclusion, which has to be a paragraph. And also, what do i say in my observations since nothing grew? Please help <3 lexi

Ok now that you have the background. I have to write an essay to get accepted.

The college academy will allow me to combine the years of my high school and college together to shortening the years I will spend in college, which will allow me to start my career sooner.      do you think that is ok?

20090131114248AAx5ml8	Education & Reference;Higher Education (University +)	What are my chances of getting into Oxford to read maths?	I'm in lower 6th at the moment, and am hoping to apply to Oxford, LSE, UCL, Warwick and Imperial College to do maths/stats. My goal is Oxford, evidently.    At GCSE I got 9 A*s, 2 As and an A in 'additional maths' (freestanding maths qualification). At the moment I'm doing maths, further maths, physics, french and economics (will probably drop economics next year) and i also did russian (but i'm not sure that really counts, since i come from Moscow >_<)    anyway, i was just wondering what the entry process is like... i know that i have to have extra-curricular activities (i play the flute grade 7, orchestra, windband lol, erm i'm part of the school magazine team representing the maths department lolll ermmm what else.... i've volunteered for the chernobyl childrens project for the past 2-3 years during the summer hols to help with translating...)   i'm not the sporty type, but i'll probably commit to some sort of physical activity in the summer....      i'm not sure really... what would they be looking for on UCAS and interviews?   i read somewhere that Oxford students have to be very disciplined... i mean, i'm the only person doing physics and further maths in my year... is that in any way relevant??         thank you :)

20090131123702AAkYrdZ	Education & Reference;Higher Education (University +)	Is ivy league this stuff true? racially?	i found this, please read, is this true reguarding minorities?            Getting into an Ivy League school can be likened to winning the lottery: Pencil in a bunch of scantron bubbles, cross your fingers, pray to be struck by lightning. But instead of winning millions, you're rolling the dice for the opportunity to impoverish your parents. (Or ruin your credit rating, or both!) Nevertheless, aspiring Ivy is a time-honored American pursuit, and no matter how improbable, impractical, and ultimately unpleasant the prize may be, thousands attempt it every year. Mostly, we do it for the free t-shirts.      What follows is IvyGate's foolproof, guaranteed, 100%-success-or-your-money-back step-by-step guide to swindling your way into the school of your dreams.* Be warned: It isn't always pretty, and a few of these steps (#3, section ii, second option) might make you go to hell.      1. Have perfect SAT scores, an off-the-chart GPA, amazing extracurriculars, leadership positions in everything, and the ability to leap tall buildings in a single bound. Duh. This one is a given, a prereq, if you will. Even the richest kid in the world won't get in if he's apt to flunk (or, more likely, drop) out.      2. Be from an insanely wealthy and/or well-connected family, preferably one with an Ivy League legacy. Apply early. While legacy admission standards aren't as hilariously low as they used to be, a study by Princeton SOC professors Espenshade and Chung equates legacy status with a 160-point SAT boost (on a 1600-point scale) to the privileged few who definitely need it least. But that's not what we're talking about here. To guarantee admission, you need to be the child of a major donor, the kind who write seven-digit checks to their alma mater and have buildings named after them. One such Ivy Leaguer, the grandson of a prominent university trustee, told us about his admissions process, starting with an unconventional and star-studded campus tour:          my grandad flew to meet my dad & i [at the university], and i just figured that it was going to be a regular day of tours & walking around. however, when we got there we were met by a super friendly admissions guy. he took us on the regular tour, but then we ditched it because he said "it's completely useless" (ironic, considering how much energy & money the university pumps into those tours) he took me around campus, and then brought me to meet a representative from the most popular department at the school, which i claimed to be interested in it. (later, i realized that he was one of the senior professors and chair of the undergraduate program) then they shuttled me over to the president's office. i didn't really GET that it was the president until they told me after we met. the meeting was brief, but looking back, it was quite an unbelievable opportunity. after lunch, we wandered around campus with another admissions rep, who told me all about undergraduate life.      After the jump: Anonymous Silver-Spooner (***) (Don't be mad, ***! We tease because we love/hate) continues his story and we offer five more tips for getting in.      As for his literal, ink-on-paper application, it was the same as anyone else's:          [my grandfather] was definitely noted as an alumnus on my application – but not in any special way, just in that box where they ask you to denote any alumni relations. i submitted my application via Registered Mail (like everyone else...to make sure it got there), so there were no special addresses or markings on it.      This fits accounts from the Daily Beast's admissions-side account. The admissions officer received ***'s application was probably already familiar with his name, and knew to flag his app for whatever special treatment the Dean of Admissions prescribed. Would *** have gotten in without his trustee grandpop?          i mean duh... there is no question that my connection helped me out. (i remember being worried at the time, but but looking back it was like "why was i ever for a SECOND concerned about not getting that 'YES!' letter?") at the same time, i don't think my grades & sat scores could've prevented me from getting in.      *** reports little special treatment post-admissions:          i don't think i really had any special treatment once i got in (living in [shitty dorm] freshman year really drives home that point) i think the only 'special' thing was that my adviser was eventually switched to the guy who chaired the department that i was, at the time, interested in. however, he was so useless that i would say that he made me a lot less interested in pursuing that path – i ended up choosing a totally opposite major.         3. Exploit your minority status, hide your white background, avoid being Asian. Espenshade and Chung estimate a 230-point boost for African-Americans, 185 points for Hispanics, a 50-point deducation for Asian-Americans, and nothing for Whitey. Currently, the Common App allows students to self-identify multiple races or none at all; thus, th

I would love to put a video on youtube and I need to know if my description is grammatically correct (as I'm not a native speaker). So please read it carefully and if you find any mistakes, let me know.      This is my very first video based on New Moon (Twilight Saga). I have already made videos like this, but this one was a special challenge for me because I have never used this program before.      The video is about the story of Jacob and Bella. I wanted to represent how much pain Bella felt when her reason for being, Edward left her. Many of you don't like New Moon, because the main character is Jacob in it but he is the reason Bella survived that period without Edward.   That's why I think Jacob deserves a little more credit and fans.   I know that the amazing Taylor Lautner plays Jake's rule but I didn't have enough video about him that's the reason he isn't "playing" Jacob in my video. You have to be satisfied with the great Steven Strait.   Anyway, I hope you'll like my video and thanks for watching it!

20090131124621AAbFlPL	Education & Reference;Homework Help	Anybody feel like looking at an essay?	Here is the essay, I will add the prompt afterwards:    My mother has encouraged me throughout my whole entire life, though sometimes unwillingly on my part, to try new things. One such occasion was when she first signed me up for Tang Soo Do, a type of martial arts. I was a bit skeptical. I mean, how would I, one of the most timid people on Earth, be able to go in there and scream at the top of my lungs while flying through the air?  I would not be able to, I concluded, I am no ninja.    For three days every week my mom dragged me into that tormenting cage they called a dojo. I was especially enthusiastic about Saturdays  Ah yes, Saturdays Where the entire class is devoted to sparring, or as I call it, torture. One Saturday though, something was a bit different than the usual insanity of punching and kicking. The whole entire week beforehand had been stressful and exhaustive, due to school, so when I came in, my mindset was slightly off. Throughout the class I had felt an eccentric feeling; one I had never imagined would have been present in this situation. Was it relief; was I actually venting here? Apparently so, I ventured. Thereafter, every time I came into class I strived to keep that quizzical way of thinking in mind. Oddly enough, I started seeing things, from the looks of it, for the first time. Instead of the usual martyrdom, I realized how useful this teaching could be one day, how interesting the many different forms are, and how awesome it feels to successfully break a board with your fist, foot, and so on. As weeks turned into months, and then years, I gradually rose up in belt ranks.     As it stands, I now have my eleventh belt; I am a Cho Dan Bo, and in one more promotion I will be a certified Black Belt. Though it has been difficult, I cannot say that it hasnt been rewarding, in fact, it has been one of the greatest experiences of my life. I owe it all to my mother for prodding me in the right direction, and influencing me to try something I never would have dared to even look at before.

We would go to town, go to the near by field and play murder games or even just sit in a car park, well basically anything that we could laugh about.       Every weekend away windsurfing was amazing! It wasn't just a laugh; it was a very serious hobby! You would have to spend thousands of pounds on the windsurfing kits. The team we were all in (UKWA) select people to go into the Olympics for England! My trainer Nick Dempsey has actully been in the Olympics a few times and done amazing!       You would be mixing with people that actully have the same interests as you, which you would never find in your home town. You would be having fun racing against friends and family.          thank you ever so much       it must also sound clever

My 13 year old was diagnosed with ADHD when he was 5 and has had a 504 plan ever since kindergarten.   I never agreed with the diagnosis, and recently took him to a therapist who was not part of the school system, so she could have an unbiased opinion.   He has Asperger's Syndrome, and I must admit.....that explains SO much of his difficulties.   I plan on meeting with his teachers and school counselor, and am wandering what the difference is 504 plan and IEP are.   My sons grades are good, but he has extreme difficulty relating to peers and would rather sit off in a corner, going un-noticed that to ever participate in class. I'm not expecting him to become a social butterfly, but he needs help.

20081024022203AAzBd4n	Education & Reference;Special Education	Question about  education for Autistic children?	Wanted to ask about Standards of education for Autistic children in Britain. Here in France parents often  have a real battle in there hands in order to get any minimum education and fight discrimination in the education system ( for instance, There is a big petition going on at the moment because of some new laws governing the tuition of school aides for autistic children in normal school classes as the employees are not qualified enough to look after the needs of these children). It has been on the news here  that in fact a lot of the more severely affected autistic children don't receive any education/day care what so ever and things are really difficult for the parents.   What is the education system like in Britain? Are Autistic children's educational needs met? Or are parents facing  much the same battle as here?      (BTW, I don't have an autistic child I'm only asking as I'm interested in this subject and more particularly in disabled people's rights.

This is the "big first meeting" that starts off this relationship, and it's just not interesting. What can I add? Thanks for any help!      “You’re new, aint cha?” I shut my locker without taking anything out, and turn to look at the guy leaning on the locker next to me. He was a light chocolate color, and his eyes were storm blue, almost gray. He wore a gray beanie with a black hoodie over it. He stood about an inch shorter, but an inch wider at the shoulders. His hoodie fit tight enough to see his muscular torso, and toned forearms.   “Uh, yeah, I’m…Grayson Edwards.”    “I’m Hector Marino. You have your schedule yet?”    I swing my bag off one shoulder and to my side, unzip the side to pull out a folded piece of white paper. Hector unfolded it, and I watched his eyes scan it once, and then again. His eyes focused on one area, and one end of his lips lifted slightly.    “Good, you’re in my 3rd period. You’ll hate it in there, Mrs. Davis is a real stickler.” He folded the paper again, flashing another quick smile. Not knowing how to reply, I stuff the paper back in my bag with a small smile, nodding a bit. Hector said nothing, but remained at my side until I had my bag on my back again.    “We still have about twenty minutes until class starts.” He held his watch up as proof, tapping in with his index finger. “Have you been shown around yet?” I pause, suddenly self-conscious. Why was he interested in talking to me? Or helping me? Someone like him—he must be so popular. And me? The “quiet new kid”. The “nerd”. The “Anti-social weirdo”. The “Stuck-up snob, too good to talk to anyone else”. The “kid in the back of the room”. So why would he want to talk to me?    “Uh… thanks, but I’m fine.” I take a few steps past him, heading in the direction I believed to be my 1st period, when I was stopped by his hand on my upper arm.    “Hey, wait a sec.” He moves in front of me, and I stare into his confused eyes. “Something wrong? Cuz, man, I’m an AWESOME tour guide. Not to mention totally sexy.” He flashed another smile. I couldn’t help but chuckle a bit, shaking my head. His smiled widened, and his hand caught my elbow. He pulled a bit towards a different direction then I was heading. “C’mon, I’ll show you lunchroom first. There’s these awesome coffee machines with like six different flavors.” He tugged again, and I bit my bottom lip, unsure. He paused again, smiling, and let go of me to cross his arm. “If you don’t come, whose gonna show you the good flavors from the crappy ones? Admit it, man, you need me.” I return his smile, raising my eyebrows. He raises his as well, challenging me.    “Fine.” I roll my eyes, and he claps once with a large grin across his face before resting his hand on my back pack to push me along.

Also, can you please give me another example of how to write, "He stood and inch shorter, but was an inch wider at the shoulders"? I just don't like the sentence much at all. Thanks!         FIRST:   “You’re new, aint cha?” I shut my locker without taking anything out, and turn to look at the guy leaning on the locker next to me. He was a light chocolate color, and his eyes were storm blue, almost gray. He wore a gray beanie with a black hoodie over it.      He stood about an inch shorter, but an inch wider at the shoulders. His hoodie fit tight enough to see his muscular torso, and toned forearms.   ______________      SECOND:   “You’re new, ain’t cha?” Surprised by the unfamiliar voice, I shyly close my locker and turn to find myself staring into a pair of icy blue, almost gray eyes, barely visible beneath a black beanie. His lips were pulled up in a slight smile, and his light chocolate colored skin was completely unmarked and smooth.      He stood no more than an inch shorter, but was an inch wider at the shoulders. His dark hoodie fit tight enough to see his muscular torso, and toned forearms.

20081105175741AAxBX0G	Education & Reference;Primary & Secondary Education	Where could a good teacher with a Master's degree in ESL and in Elementary Educaton find a good Job?	I have over 12 years experience but the politics here is getting overwhelming and I suck at politics.  I say what I think and may very likely find myself in hot water over this NCLB and ESL laws that are being mandated by idiots with no experience.  These laws are trying to be inforced by people in our school district with no experience but they are somebody's best friend and are wrecking havoc on these kids.      In my opinion, we don't't teach STANDARDS...we teach CHILDREN!  Children have been taught how to speak English for hundreds of years before NCLB and mandatory ESL classes were "trickled down".  It is as stupid to say you  can't be a good teacher without twenty five curriculum maps, just as you can be a good cook without 25 cook books.  This paper work, new "improved" buzz words and criticisms of the best and praise for the worst is getting to me.  I need to move on but I love teaching.

20090131095123AAZICiq	Education & Reference;Teaching	Can you get a teaching credential online?	I already obtained my BA in Liberal Studies at a Cal State and am working full time at a local private Christian Preschool. I would like to start working towards a credential so that I can move up to elementary grades. I know that for a private school you don't need a credential in CA but it would definitely help if I ever want to branch out to public schools. Does any body know if there is an online program to obtain your teaching credentials? I would like to be able to work full time and obtain my credentials online.
