20090220134057AAz5WH7	Science & Mathematics;Physics	Black holes, gravity and density?	When we have a star that undergoes gravitational collapse (becomes a black hole) there is no loss or gain of mass (Conservation). But when it does collapse, its escape velocity (and thus gravity) goes through the roof, beyond c (speed of light).      So, if the mass stays the same and the size decreases, then the star's density is what increases. And this is followed by an increase in gravity.       So, What is the relationship between gravity and density?
20090220133941AAa3T8c	Science & Mathematics;Astronomy & Space	UFO sighting (red ball) in the late 70's over Cleveland, Ohio?	It was between 1978-1980 in Parma, Ohio. I was looking out the window at the sky. It was maybe early spring or late fall at about 6 or 7 pm.  I saw this big red ball go straight up from nowhere as if it came up from the ground.  I yelled for my mom. She saw it through a different window and then came to the patio door with me to watch it. Looking at it, it almost seemed like looking at a red sun at night. It was probably a few miles away from us and maybe only a mile or so up in the air.  All together it probably sat in the air for maybe 2 minutes, and than it came straight down and it was gone.      RECAP:  It went straight up into the sky, sat there for a couple of minutes, and than went straight down and was gone.       My Mother knew the mayor of the city at the time and asked him if he had heard of anything about this big red ball.  He did not hear of any callers regarding this, nor could he explain what it could have been.        If anyone saw this same thing in Ohio at the same time please explain your version. If anyone knows what it could have been please share your knowledge.  Thanks :o]

Hello, I have been trying to get a basic understanding the mathematics that go into quantum mechanics. However since the only person who would possibly know the math involved would be my math teacher and he doesn't have the time to explain it to me i have been trying to get a general understanding through the internet and self teaching guides (things like calc. for dummies). I was wondering if anyone could give me a suggestion for a good, clear guide to linear algebra that a beginner would find helpful/ understandable. I looked at linear algebra demystified but many of the reviews claimed that it had a large number of errors in it so I'm not sure i would like to purchase this. I also looked at linear Alg for dummies but this appeared not to be out yet (i looked at both of these on Amazon). So any suggestions of websites and or books would be greatly appreciated. Thank you   Also if anyone could tell me any sort of perquisite mathematics that i should have before begining linear alg. + where i should go after I'm done with it, would also be very helpful.

20090220145402AA7GPrI	Science & Mathematics;Astronomy & Space	Community College to Ivy League?	OK here we go... I'm 23 years old and have wasted a good part of my life being reckless and irresponsible. I did very well in high school with a GPA above 3.5 and an ACT score of 27. I was also extremely involved in a wide range of extracurricular activities. I had one semester at the University of Kansas but withdrew. I then went to community college and withdrew from most of my classes. The classes I didn't withdraw from in time left me with two F's. The withdrawals were a result of frequent and crippling panic attacks. I have since been diagnosed with severe adult ADD, depression and anxiety disorder. I am receiving treatment and have become very ambitious and organized.  I am finally in control of my life once more. I have returned to community college and am receiving very high A's in all of my classes, including a 98% in astronomy. I have never been this serious about school. I am very upset that I have wasted the last five years of my life because I know that if I had worked hard right after high school that I would not have to ask this question. I want nothing more than to become an astrophysicist or a cosmologist. I know that I will be flawless in semesters to come, with perfect attendance and a 4.0. I plan on transferring back to the University of Kansas as soon as possible. I know that I am smart enough, but are my dreams of getting into a prestigious graduate school rendered impossible by my past?

What i am dealing with is an above ground water well pump that has been drained & turned off at the breaker. It is in a well-house without heat & mice for company. Also, the nights are below freezing however the days are above. The tank looks like a big bullet, about 3 ft. high x 3 ft. wide aprox.  It has a PSI meter attached that reads up to at least 100.  After 15 min. the PSI only reached to 40 with no water flowing through the faucets in the house.       Question, do i need to wait for the pressure to raise all the way up to 100 before water will flow into the house? if so, how long should it take for pressure to build? the well is aprox. 60 feet from house. thanks for the help!

The crate slides the full 7 m.  How much work was done by gravity on the crate as it slid from top to bottom of the incline?  Express your answer in J, but do not write J in your answer.      For this I got W = mgh = 392 J      In the previous problem, how much work was done by the normal force between the incline and the crate?  Give your answer in Joules, but as always do not write the unit in your answer.      I got 0 for this.      In the previous problem(s), how much work is done by friction?  If you think there IS NO friction, you should answer 0.      ^ This final one I have no idea how to approach..

20090220161012AAxO45T	Science & Mathematics;Physics	How do electrons and protons work together in the structure of the nucleus and electron configurations..quarks?	I know that electrons equal protons in the nucleus, but I find that the Hydrogen 1 atom is just a proton, with an electron orbiting in a probability field. If a proton can make an electron orbital, without a neutron, then how does it make the electron configurations in higher elements and Hydrogen 1? What is it about the proton that allows it to make an electron orbital, and how does this differ from a free proton and electron attracting each other? In more than 1 proton and electron, how are the protons arranged in the nucleus in regard to electron configurations? In light of the fact that protons and neutrons are made up of quarks, uud, and ddu, and quarks change when you look at them and change back when you look away, how would consciousness affect the whole structure of the atom? Are electrons made up of quarks too, and how are electrons and light affected by consciousness on their own and in an atom?

The temperature of the water is 23.4oC. The owner of the swimming pool would like the temperature of the water to be 31.8oC. How many grams of propane would have to be burned if all the heat from the combustion was used to heat the water to 31.8oC? The specific heat of water is 4.184 JK-1g-1.         i know you multiply l x w x h to get volume, but after that I have no idea. then i think i have to convert to grams after multiplying mass, specific heat, and temperature change... but i'm not getting the right answers ever!!

20090220161739AAFjeY2	Science & Mathematics;Mathematics	Math question. Very important.?	Alright. I need to know what is the probability of something turning out successful if there are 5 chances a certain event that has 20% success rate will occur.      If you don't understand what I am saying, I will try to reword it below.      If an event has a 20% chance of happening, and I only get 5 tries, what is the success rate for the event to happen overall?      My class is counting on me for getting this question right, but I am not good with story questions or probability.       Please explain how you came up with the solution. I will understand complicated work, so need to baby feed the walk though. Thank you very much.
20090220161817AA7Zi9f	Science & Mathematics;Mathematics	Help with finding perimeter and area?	 http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3620/3295...       The formulas that you will need are perimeter equals the sum of twice the length and twice the width (P=2L+2W), and area equals the product of the length and the width (A=LW).      Procedure:      Part 1: Using your knowledge of polynomial addition and subtraction (combining like terms), answer the following questions. Write your work and answers in the Assignment Area labeled Part 1.         1.            Find entire length of this two bedroom apartment in terms of x.      2.            Find the entire width of this two-bedroom apartment a (not counting the patio) in terms of x. (Be careful, the width of bath 1 is not given, but the width of the entry is the same as the width of the pantry. With that information, you can find the width of the left hand side of the house.)      Part 2: Using your knowledge of the distributive property and polynomial addition and subtraction, answer the following questions. (Remember, P=2L+2W.) Write your answers in the same assignment labeled Part 2.         3.            Find the perimeter of the entire 2-bedroom apartment (excluding the patio) in terms of x.      4.            Find the perimeter of the living room and dining room in terms of x.      5.            Find the perimeter of the master bedroom, excluding the sitting area and the closets.      Part 3: Using your knowledge of solving linear equations, answer the following questions. Write your work and answers in the same assignment labeled Part 3.         6.            If the perimeter of the living room and dining room is 60 feet, what is the value of x?      7.            If the perimeter of the master bedroom excluding the sitting area and the closets is 42 feet, what is the value of x?      8.            If the length of the entire apartment is 57 feet, what is the value of x?      Part 4: You have reviewed polynomial multiplication and division in this module, practice now. (Remember, A=LW.)         9.            Find the area of the entire living room/dining room.     10.            Find the area of the patio.     11.            Find the area of the entire apartment (excluding the patio). Note: don't forget to subtract for the cutout area in the upper left corner.     12.            If the area of the kitchen was 2x-4, what would be the width? Write the expression or number for the width.     13.            If the area of the dining room and living room is 300 sq. ft., what is the equation that would be used to solve for x? Write the equation with zero on the right, ready to solve.     14.            If the area of the entire apartment is 800 sq. ft., what is the equation that would be used to solve for x? Use the length and width from questions 1 and 2. Do not worry about the area of the patio or the corner that is cut out of the living room/dining room. Write the equation with zero on the right, ready to solve.      Part 5:        15. Find the area of your bedroom, Label it A. Using the dimensions of the Master Bedroom in Figure 1, Write an equation using (x + 8) as length- L and (2x – 3) as the width-W and the actual area you found for your room-A. Manipulate the equation so that it is set equal to zero, in the form: ax2+ bx + c = 0... DO NOT SOLVE!!!

A parallel-plate air capacitor of area A= 20.0 cm2 and plate separation d= 3.40 mm is charged by a battery to a voltage 64.0 V. If a dielectric material with κ = 4.20 is inserted so that it fills the volume between the plates (with the capacitor still connected to the battery), how much additional charge will flow from the battery onto the positive plate?      Ok, so I found the capacitance without the dielectric, and then the charge:      C = (epsilon zero)*(.2) / (3.4/1000)   C = 5.206E-10 F   q=CV=(5.206E-10 F)(64V) = 3.33E-8 C      Then I found the capacitance with the dielectric   C = (k)(epsilon zero)(A)/d = (0.2)(4.2)(epsilon zero)/(3.4/1000)   C = 2.186E-9 F   q=CV=(2.186E-9 F)(64) = 1.399E-7 C      I then subtracted 1.399E-7 - 3.33E-8 C = 1.066E-7 C, but that is wrong. Any idea what I did wrong?

Any suggestions of alternate designs would be highly appreciated.      *Please do not suggest tape.  I have packaging tape, tried it, and it didn't work well for too long.  Also, I do not have duct tape and that has already been suggested to me.      *My current design*:   The design I have includes a string (using nylon), a weight (small bag of marbles), 1-2 eyelets,  and a hook/eyelet. Everything goes on the same side, the opening side.      The first hook/eyelet goes into the wall above the door frame.  Then, an eyelet goes toward the top of the door.  Another eyelet to position lower is optional for holding the string.  The string is tied/attached to the weigh.  Then, you pull the string through the eyelets and tie the end to the hook.  When the door opens, the string should push on the top edge of the door.  Thus, the door closes when you let go.
