20090222144440AAFUwdO	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	What do you think of my poem?	The Attack At Sea   Maureen B.   2/22/09         My years have grown old   My days have grown short   The nights have become cold   I now hide here in my fort   The flaps of the tent flutter   I sit at the table   My mind is cluttered   With thoughts of my able troops   We are at war    And they are beating us at sea   But we are strong at the core   My people will soon be free   I will seize the day   That day in May.         This poem was written from the perspective of Queen Elizabeth 1 when England and the Spanish Armada were fighting at sea.

20090222144454AAiSqX0	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	I need some opinions of this story.  all you gotta to do is read it.?	tell me what you think of it.  critism, any ideas, and what level you think this was written at.  thanks so much.      There was no doubt about it she looked perfect from the designer jeans that fitted a double zero, Louis Vuitton hand bag that was pried between two polished fingers, and Calvin Klein flip-flops that hung from her dainty feet.  Usually all the time she stood in the most expensive boutique in the mall she lived for the up-to-down envious stares from other girls who she could practically taste the envy oozing from their gaping mouths, but today it just seemed insignificant.     She was even ignoring the aching of her delicate feet from standing too long, and the urge to shake her hand to banish the stagnant feeling.  Her hazel glassy eyes, fringed with long eye lashes, hidden behind bulky Chanel sun glasses, were one place and one place only; out the store window.  Maybe she wasn’t leaning past the clothes racks or stepping out the door, but yet she was just as interested, her gaze unable to tear from the scene.    They comically skipped hand and hand doubled over laughing.  The man and the woman’s outfit were worn and obviously no designer, but they seemed too oblivious, as they mocked smacked each other with the few shopping bags they carried.  This made them grin more.  He leaned into her ear and whispered something that made his blue eyes twinkle with happiness.  Extending an arm like a butler, she burst into a fit of giggles, as he slowly leaned into kiss her.  Then playfully he pushed her and then they began walking out of the view of the window.     Tearing her eyes away from couple she focused on a clearance rack, calming down from the sudden verge of anger, wishing to run out there find them and slap them.   They couldn’t have love if she couldn’t.  Quickly her anger flooded into disappointment in herself, because it was obvious, where she came from love….. Just didn’t work, but that didn’t stop for longing for the feeling of being head over heels for someone.   She felt the heat accumulating behind her eyes building up for the tears, but of course, like always, they never came to ease the pain.  Relief suddenly pulsed through her, as her friends jogged towards her, carrying a new pair of clothes for her to change into, when they went to another boutique, but this distraction couldn’t keep her mind from reminding her that her heart was an icy black hole that would never be able to love.   She always felt men’s eyes on her, but they held nothing she was looking for, or did they even speak.  It wasn’t that she wasn’t beautiful enough to have a boyfriend.  She had the straightest posture, most expensive wardrobe, silky hair, and perfect make-up job, but even the fullness of her lips, flawless skin, and ideal figure couldn’t hide the fact that she was plastic molded into another pretty face.  Nothing could change the fact that she was just a mannequin.

I play piano, cello, guitar, drums, violin, already, but am dying for something like a brass or woodwind.  By real, I mean not a kazoo/ocarina type thing.   So I would prefer brass but I think it might be cheaper if a stick with woodwind.  But I don't want a flute.  Any suggestions?  What would the starting price be for this instrument on ebay?  (a good quality one, but I don't care if it's not perfect) .  I'm willing to save up some money to buy it, but I dont really want anything more than 200 dollars.. I can get more, but I would prefer spend as little money as I can.

20090222145357AAOanBR	Arts & Humanities;History	Questions on the 1920's?	1)As a presidential candidate in 1920, Warren G. Harding’s popularity hinged on his appeal for a return to “normalcy,” by which he meant    a. “a regular steady order of things…with out excess”    b. “Returning to an America of high foreign domination, when life was simpler.”    c. “The need to return to rugged individualism and self-help without the government interference prevalent during the Progressive Era and WWI.”    d. “Repealing the constitutional amendment allowing women to vote, certainly an unnatural state of affairs for the fairer sex.”      2)The most prevalent employment opportunities for American women in the 1920s were as    a. Factory laborers I America’s burgeoning industrial economy.    b. Secretaries, file clerks, typists, and salesclerks.    c. Teachers and nurses    d. Doctors, lawyers, and financial advisers.       3)The following excerpt from President Herbert Hoover’s 1929 inauguration speech turned out to be ironic in light of events during his presidency    a. “We in America today are nearer to the final triumph over poverty than ever before in the history of any land. The poorhouse is vanishing from among us.”    b. “A vote for me is a vote for a chicken in every pot and a radio tuned to prosperity”    c. “Christianity may be out religion, but capitalism is our salvation”    d. “We in America today are nearer to a truly equitable distribution of income than ever before in the history of any land. Having to borrow money will soon be a thing of the past.”

And I think it's no disgrace   To occupy my place.   If I'm not so large as you,   You are not so small as I,   And not half so spry."      it's from this poem:    The mountain and the squirrel   Had a quarrel;   And the former called the latter "Little Prig."   Bun replied,   "You are doubtless very big;   But all sorts of things and weather   Must be taken in together   To make up a year   And a sphere.   And I think it's no disgrace   To occupy my place.   If I'm not so large as you,   You are not so small as I,   And not half so spry.   I'll not deny you make   A very pretty squirrel track;   Talents differ: all is well and wisely put;   If I cannot carry forests on my back,   Neither can you crack a nut."

And within your impassive room,   Your favorite jewelry hangs;   Your favorite picture;   Your favorite pain;   Your favorite slave...      Here I am living on your breath,   Hanging on your words,   Feeling with your skin,   Seeing through your eyes...   I am always here.

Also I'd like any suggestions on how to fix it... (Adam is Ana's twin brother)        A transport truck is coming to the side.  Too fast.  It doesn't see us.     The car goes flying as we collide.  It rolls over again and again.  The glass shatters and cuts my face.  My leg is crushed as the transport truck tips over half the car.  I scream.  I feel my bone shatter.  The car stops on its side.       I hang in the car, pain engulfing me.  I can't move.  There is more blood.        "Adam?"  I call out.     No answer.      "Adam!"  I call out, more urgently.     I turn my neck painfully.     He isn't in his seat.     I panick, grab a piece of glass and start to saw off the seat belt holding me captive in my seat.      I finally cut through and fall on my back.      Sharp pains sting me.  I ignore them and push myself through the broken window with my good leg and my good arm.  My other arm won't move.  I jostle my shattered leg, and suppress a scream.     I slid on sharp glass that cuts through my shirt and back.  I scream,  pushing with all my might, making the glass dig deeper into my skin.      I Turn over and drag myself further away from the metal mess.     I can't breath.  It hurts too much.     I try to stand, but my leg wont cooperate.  Pain makes me blind and I wait breathing shallowly.     I drag myself, despite the pain to the other side of the car.      "Adam!"  Still no answer     I realize Theres a a big sharp piece of glass that has cut through my cheek.  I can feel it with my tongue.  I count to three and pull it out.  It is slippery with blood and I can't help but scream.     I see a lump of a body.  Mangled and broken on the street.     I gasp and drag myself over as fast and painful as possible.     He is breathing.  I hear with each breath a painful wheez escape from his throat.      "No," I whisper.  "Adam.  Stop joking, this isn't funny."     He doesn't answer.      "Adam.  Open your eyes."  I demand.  Tears slid down my face silently.     He opens his eyes.     I sigh in Relief.      "Okay, tell me were it hurts."  I can tell his leg is in a freaky angle.  His bone is jutting out of his arm and his face is covered in blood. His other arm is pined under his back also in an unnatural position.  I try to fix it.  He doesn't scream.  He yelps "Stop! Stop! No don't!"     I cry.  What do I do?  I check my pocket.  My phone in still there.       "I'm getting help Adam.  It'll be fine!  Someone will come and help us."  I remember our car has all star.      "Someone will be here soon."  I pull his head into my lap.  He groans.  "We'll be okay.  We'll go to the hospital and we'll get better and we'll go home and you'll talk to dad like you promised and everything will be fine."     I hear sirens.  "See,"  I say.  "Do you hear!  They'll be here any second.  I'll stay with you no matter what.  I'll stay until you're good."     He wheezes and cogh.  I can hear the pain.  I can hear how it hurts.  I know how he hurts.      "Andre,"  He sais pain distorting his voice.      "Yea! Yea what is it Adam?"  I say panicking.  My tears trickle onto his face.  I wipe his face with my shirt.  I wanted to take it off and mop off the blood so he could open his eyes all the way, so I could see his face.  But my arm is in such pain I can't move anymore.      "I'm sorry."      "No Adam."  I cry.  "No you are the best and I love you so I'm not mad.  No just wait and we'll be fine."      "I love you too."  He grunts and has a small spasm.     He stops moving.  I can hear how hard it is for him to breath but it's comforting to hear him breathe.      "The sirens are louder Adam!"  I hug his head.  "You'll be fine soon."      "Ana, in my room, there is a tin under my matress.  Keep it.  Don't show anyone."      "You can show me when you get home okay?"     He doesn't answer.      "Okay!"      "Yea."  He huffs softly.     His breathing spikes and I can't bear to hear.  "I love you."  He sais.     The ambulances are here.  I hear people rush to the car.      "Adam, there here."     Nothing.     I shake him.      "Adam!"  There is no movement in my arm.  No sound of labored breathing coming from my brother.      "Adam!"  I  cry.  "AADDDAMMMM!!!!"  I yell.      Nothing.     I cradle his head in my arm and cry.     People try to pick me up.  I fight their arms off and hold onto him.     They stop touching me.     A man with dark hair bends down in front of me.      "He's gone honey.  Let him go."      I cry hysterical.      "No!  He needs me!"     He puts a hand on my shoulder.  "Okay."  He turn es to all the paramedics and police.  "Get a stretcher."  He sais.      Adam lay limp in my arms.  I can't accept it.  It is impossible.  I feel a sharp pain in arm . . .

20090222154211AAl3uQn	Arts & Humanities;Theater & Acting	Acting problems ?!!!?	hey guys.    okay so i like to act. its fun and its my passion. but i have a few problems.    1. I am shy around an audience. Whenever I am around an audience I get nervous and my face turns really red. I guess I am afraid of embarassent. I don't want to make a fool of myself. Is there anything I can do to help this? I mean I hate doing presentations in school too because I am afraid that people won't like it and I am going to embarrass myself. I just don't know what I can do to make myself more comfortable being infront of an audience.       2. When I tell my parents that I want to act and take acting classes they don't take me seriously. That makes my self-confidence/ self-esteem lack even more. Any tips on how to go about telling my parents that I want to act with out having them laugh in my face. I hate it. I just want to do something I love.       I want to be on tv, but I know that you have to start small. So that is why I want to do acting classes.          P.S. I have been in many, many plays. And some I was the lead role, but over the years my self confidence has gone down. I just, as I said before, want to be able to take my acting seriously. But I still want to have fun doing it and I can't enjoy acting if I get embararessed easily.                Thanks sooo much in advance.

20090222160401AAAvbVC	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	Thesis for a paper on Walden or On Civil Disobedience?	I have an analysis paper coming up, and while I've been reading Thoreau, it's just not sinking in. For one brief shining moment I'll think I've connected with something he says, only to see him contradict himself two pages later (that, or I've completely misunderstood what he was saying LOL)      I was wondering if anyone would mind providing a few prompts/thesis topics for me to think on? For Walden, I can use a single chapter, rather than the whole book. On Civil Disobedience made more sense to me, and I found it easier to annotate it in my book, but some of what he said in that piece sort of irked me so I'm afraid any thesis I come up with for it will be seen as misinterpreting him. My professor is the type who's going to expect some good rationalization from me, whatever my topic is.      I can also write it on Margaret Fuller's "The Great Lawsuit," but since we don't start reading it until a few days before the due date, I think I'd be cutting it fine there.      I posted this twice in Books and Authors, but of course, since it wasn't about Twilight, it got bumped and ignored, so I'd appreciate any help/tips you can provide!

20090222111619AAHDfb2	Arts & Humanities;Other - Arts & Humanities	Is love necessary in life?	I'm 21 and never been in a relationship, nor desire to be in one. I'm probably asexual. I think society puts way too much emphasis on relationships and finding that special someone. Why can't people just be happy with themselves? People think that being in a relationship will automatically make them happy and solve all their problems. Why is there obsessive interest over relationships?   I'm not really that close to anyone. I only have one or two friends. It's hard for me to get close to people in general...kind of because I don't see why people would want to hang out with me. So I guess in some ways, I have low-self esteem. I don't think I've ever emotionally opened up to another human being..   My question is, am I missing out on what life is all about?      Part of be doesn't believe in love and thinks it's just a silly human emotion. However, that means, every other human emotion is silly as well. So I do realize my thinking is slightly skewed. I also realize that just because I don't believe in love, doesn't mean it's not valid.      I also realize that part of my inability to love probably comes from the inability to love myself. However, it's not like I hate myself either. I do think I have some good qualities, but overall, I'm just don't really care.   I realize that when I get out of college, I'm just going to have a career and ultimately die. Yeah there will be fun times in between..but in the end..we're going to die.
20090222160025AANkc4n	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	How can I love myself if I don't know who I am?	I've come to the conclusion that the reason I don't have many close friends nor ever been in a relationship at 21, is because of my inability to love myself.  Part of the reason I can't love myself is because I haven't figured out who I am yet.  For instance, I'm studying economics and business in college, but I know deep down, that these aren't my true passions.  Basically I haven't found what I want out of life.  I then tell myself that life has no meaning anyway, so nothing really matters.   Anyway, I realize that I do have some good traits...like I can be extremely funny at times and I'm easy to talk to.  I then start thinking that maybe a decent person, just trying to find my way in life like everyone else.  But when it comes down to it, I don't know who I am or what I would like to be...so how can I truly love myself?  Maybe I should just love that I'm trying to find myself..??

20090222154616AAHsKGh	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Twilight article; what do you think? [haters and fans, please answer] :)?	[brief summary of the books goes here]      First off, Stephenie Meyer’s idea of "true love" is twisted. After a couple weeks of barely any real conversation, the hero and heroine of this cliché ridden novel declare undying and “irrevocable” love. If you strip the relationship between Edward and Bella down, you’ll see it centers around Edward’s model looks and Bella’s delicious-smelling blood, and these do not make a soul-mate.       Furthermore, Edward Cullen is manipulative and just downright annoying with his greeting-card dialogue. He climbs through Bella’s window at night and watches her sleep, although she isn’t aware of it. Even though he’s 108-years old and acts incredibly stalker-like, Bella thinks he’s romantic. Later in the series, Edward disables Bella’s car and holds her hostage so she can’t see Jacob Black, her best friend. It seems that Ms. Meyer is telling young readers that girls can’t make their own decisions, and that just adds to the sexism in the books. Whether the sexism was intended or not, it’s still there. It’s even more prominent when Bella immediately fell into the stereotypical female roles [eg. cooking and cleaning] upon arriving at her father’s house.      [Breaking Dawn spoiler] After Meyer constantly reminds readers throughout the books that vampires cannot reproduce, she goes against her own rules. After marriage, Bella and Edward have a mutant child together. A dead body creating babies... whatever happened to logical fiction?      So basically, Stephenie Meyer can string two words together and suddenly everyone thinks she’s the best thing ever since sliced bread. A bunch of overused adjectives slapped onto a couple hundred pages is, needless to say, not a great demonstration of talented writing. If anyone was right on the ball, it was Stephen King when he said, "The real difference is that Jo Rowling is a terrific writer, and Meyer can't write worth a darn."       --This is for the newspaper at my school [grade 6-8] so I couldn't go into much detail about why Bella getting pregnant was impossible, or anything else about the pregnancy, for that matter .      Also, I couldn't write more than four paragraphs, so the sexism part is very brief. If there's any other sexism in the books that I might have missed, feel free to type it in your answer.      Thank you! <3

20090222155654AAljOPm	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Is this a good start to a story?	PROLOGUE          We were six kids all from different universes. Nothing in common except despair, emptiness and somehow even though our personalities clashed and many times our arguments ended with a new cut or bruise and sometimes even the a trip to the hospital  we loved one another and in each other we found  someone that actually  understood us, someone that made us belong. But that was when we were kids. Now, we were complete strangers.  And no longer did we belong, not even to our families.  Outcasts again.      CHAPTER ONE   ~DIANA~       I sighed miserably, smiling sadly at the Barrett family, neighbors we had when I was a teenager, Mom would have liked to seen them.        My father’s withered hand slid into mine and I turned to see his eyes blossoming with moisture and salty silver streaks of tears staining his sunken cheeks. His white hair, slickly brushed back with dark shadows beneath his eyes, aging his appearance greatly.       “Your mother would be so proud of you right now, Di,” he murmured, his voice thick with tears. I shrugged my shoulders and patted his hand soothingly, quickly raising to my feet as a new wave of mourners came to seek condolences, which I did not need.       I ignored the pitying looks my relations and neighbors gave me and smoothly side stepped Aunt Marley who had broken down on the floor, sobbing uncontrollably crying out my mother’s name hoarsely. I scowled internally, knowing there was no blood lost between my mother and her sister, a vile bitter woman who thrived on attention and of course others knew this also that was why no one helped her up only the revenant Charmers.       The kitchen was crowded with weepers and condolers who sipped tea and reminisced with each other about olden times and some shore news about their lives now, each with a drawn expression on their faces, sadness creeping in their tone of voice.       Slipping up the stairs I was glad to find a eerie silence mostly just with the hum of chatter below me and the howling of the wind battering against the double glazed windows. I wrapped my arms around diminutive shoulders and walked into Mom’s and Dad’s room now just Dad’s. I let out an exasperated sigh out when I noticed the bed had yet to be made, never used since Mom had last been in it. The night she had suffered from the stroke.       Slowly -almost cautiously- I glided over to her side of the bed and let myself fall onto it, hearing the old springs moan faintly in protest. My knees instantly came up and I cradled them to my chest, making myself into a protective ball, like I did when I was younger.       I smiled at the strong  scent of my mother lingering on the pillows and bed sheets.  A unique fragrance; expensive scotch and old gin with her cheap perfume that she loved more so than the countless bottles of upmarket  ones I had sent back from my travels in Europe.       I pursed my lips and remembered vividly my mother’s stubbornness and inflexibility that had caused many fights and arguments between both of us. It was the reason I had moved out when I was eighteen and rarely visited incapable of fighting anymore with her.        Perhaps that was the reason I was incapable of showing emotion or even grieving for her like my father did so strongly. Or maybe it was the company that swarmed me, strangers and my father also belonged to that category.       Even those that I had once gone to school with were alien to me, those who had regarded me an outcast when I was younger and now I knew they were correct in their assumptions.  The only people that I regarded as family weren’t here and I hadn’t heard from them in a near decade.       I heard my Uncle Ben call my name clearly, obviously upstairs and with a parting groan I got to my feet fluidly and walked over to the door meeting my Uncle as he appeared in the doorway, looking tired and miserable and who could blame him when you have to attend your younger sister’s wake it’s bound to upset you.       “Yes?” I asked in a gentle tone, smiling at my shell of an Uncle. He gave me a brief smile and wrapped his arm around my shoulder as he never did and began to steer us to the stairs, to my utter dismay but I kept my distaste for any human contact concealed with a smile.       “You’ve grown up so much Diana since you moved away,” He began, and I nodded weakly remembering  lucidly the scrawny eighteen year old I was when I had seen him last, my  blonde hair frizzy and untamed, chapped lips and thick eyebrows, my glasses larger than my face and my acne plagued skin, my clothes much too baggy for me and my scrunched posture.       But now I was grown, a twenty five year old woman, with my blonde hair usual cascading down my back in loose curls, my lips full and tainted a rose, my eyebrows perfect, my contacts and smooth alabaster skin, my tight fitting clothes that showed my curves and complimented my shape and my small physique somehow larger as I walked straight and with my chin up.       “I know you and your mother didn’t alway
20090222155905AAIGye3	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Do you like the book i wrote so far?	I stared out the window as the rain poured down the thin glass panes of the cheap school windows. That was about the most entertaining thing that was available for me to do right now. Listening to Mr. Dally drone on and on about some war in history class was the last thing I wanted to do. History was so boring this year. Last year it wasn’t that bad, we were learning about the fur trade then. This year all we learned about in history were pointless wars between Canadian settlers fighting over taxes. Don’t get me wrong, history is a fascinating thing. World history, I mean. Oh well, it was already period 6, and soon enough the end-of-day announcements would be coming on.   “By the way, you have a test on the Confederation of Canada tomorrow”, I caught Mr. Dally say.    Great, if there was one thing to love about Mr. Dally, it was his constant ‘forgetting’ to let us know when we had a test coming up. My best friend Jacquie turned around to give me one of her eye rolls. I gave her one back. This was Jacquie’s and my way of expressing our frustration of Mr. Dally to each other. At that moment, the intercom buzzed, and end-of-day announcements finally came on. I listened to Mrs. Hill’s perfect principal voice remind us of upcoming soccer practices, choir meetings, and volleyball tryouts. I have never been good at sports, and so in all of my 13 years, I have never tried out for one sports team. Student Counsel was more my kind of thing, and I enjoyed planning school events. Suddenly I heard Mrs. Coffer’s voice come on.   “This year, 10 lucky grade 8 students will get the amazing opportunity to go on a forty day Canadian expedition.” I listened as Mrs. Coffer went on. “10 grade 8 students, along with me; will go on a Canadian expedition by foot this summer. We will travel east through the provinces of Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta, and British Columbia. We will then travel north through the cold arctic territories. Finally, we will come back down south, until we end off back here in Thunder Bay. This will all be done by foot, we will camp out in the forest, and during the whole expedition, we will never once be close to any towns or cities. If you are interested in joining the expedition club, please come to the library tomorrow at lunch.”   Wow, that sure sounded cool. And by the way my class sounded, I wasn’t the only one who was planning to go to the library tomorrow at lunch. As soon as announcements ended, I put my chair up and went over to talk to Jacquie.   “Oh my gosh!” she exclaimed. “Can you believe that? I am definitely going to join the expedition club. You are too, right Valerie? I’ll ask Marla and Marissa if they want to come too!”   “Good idea Jacquie! But do you really think Mrs. Coffer will let girly-girls like us join?”   “Well, we’ll never know until we go there, right?”    Good old Jacquie, always trying to be optimistic. The moment the bell rang, everybody was pushing their way through the halls in an attempt to get to their locker. The reason everybody was always in a rush to get going at the end of the day was so that they would have a better chance of getting the back seat of the bus. It was really quite annoying, actually. I mean, the bus was going to take you home, no matter where you sat on the bus, right?    When I finally got to my locker, I put all my stuff in my bag, listening as everyone was chatting about the whole expedition thing. As I made my way out of the school, Jacquie approached me once again.   “Hey! Guess what I just heard? Mrs. Coffer wants people who are less-experienced in camping on the expedition club! That increases our chances of getting on! Call me tonight,” she said as she boarded her bus.   I stopped in front of my bus to shake the half-frozen slush off my shoes. My bus driver Wayne was probably one of the weirdest bus drivers I have ever had. Besides forcing us to shake our shoes off before we got onto the bus, he seemed to really like speeding down the quiet residential streets that were on my route.    I headed toward the back of the bus, trying to find a seat where I could sit by myself. It’s not that I’m anti-social or anything, it’s just that none of my friends are on my bus, and I really hate when random guys sit beside me just so that they can stare at me the whole bus ride home. I know I’m pretty, maybe too pretty for my own good. I can be popular if I want to be, but that would mean hanging around people who are just pretending to be my friends. They like me for my looks, not for who I really am. I actually wish I wasn’t so beautiful. I get attention I don’t really want. My friends, Jacquie, Marla, Marissa, and Shannon are probably the friends that are truly my friends.            well that is all i got soo far stay tuned for the rest
20090222155855AA4jPnY	Arts & Humanities;Dancing	Beginner Pointe Shoes?	I'm 15, and I think I'm going to re-begin pointe next year, as in I took pointe when I was around 11 and 12 but I had to stop because my feet weren't strong enough to cope with it.      But, after wearing my orthotics and gaining strength, I think I'm ready to start again. I kind of want to just purchase some pointe shoes now and practice on my own(I have a room with hardwood floors, mirrors, and a barre) to prepare myself to start in the fall.      Do you think that will be alright?   And what brand of shoes would you suggest? I'll probably get gel toe pads since that is what I wore before.      Any other advice is appreciated!
20090222155454AAaRB7Z	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	I need some criticism on the Beginning of my story?	The tang of salt overwhelmed the air while an indolent breeze whistled over the ship’s deck. Zoe watched the ocean tide rock the one hundred and fifty thousand ton ship as if it were a baby’s cradle. The Scenery was beyond beautiful, nevertheless she could not find it within herself to enjoy this so-called vacation.   Zoe tried to block out all of her painful thoughts and memories as she Leaned cross-armed against the ship’s railing, the only thing keeping her from falling into the ocean. But no matter how hard she tried, those thoughts began to seep into her mind like smoke making its way through the crevices of a door. Zoe began thinking of her hometown and how, although she despised it, she’d rather be there than on this cruise with her mother and Trevor, her mother’s nauseating boyfriend. Her life had actually been fairly good before he crawled out of the depths of hell and into her mothers heart.   Zoe had always been the type of person who could withstand a lot and even if she were breaking apart on inside she wouldn’t let anyone witness it. But, as she looked around at the surrounding beauty of the world, she couldn’t help but realize that the shimmering oceans and the beautiful mountains were all just a masquerade covering up the pain and wretchedness the world was actually capable of. At the thought of how hopeless life was and how there was no way of escaping it without seeming cowardly, her eyes began too fill with tears.   Zoe looked around in embarrassment as she brushed away the tears. It was the first time she noticed the sky was growing dark. Zoe began to run back to room 220 were her mom and Trevor would be waiting impatiently for her so they could eat dinner. Running through the halls of the hotel portion of the ship Zoe disregarded the curses and warnings being thrown at her. She was Twenty minutes late and Trevor would have her head for it.   190...200...210...SMACK! Zoe’s head hit the ground with a heavy thud, and for a second everything went black. She opened her eyes to an outraged face staring dawn at her and an unfriendly hand offering to help her up. Trevor yanked Zoe to her feet and began to rub the spot where she’d ran into him with exaggeration. Zoes eyes began to fill up with tears again, not because of the blow to her head, but because his face was the last she wanted to see right now.   Any Stranger would probably think Trevor looked as if he‘d just came from a Hollywood fashion shoot. He wore a tight button-down shirt with rolled sleeves, to show off his lean muscles. Along with that, his square jaw, high cheek bones and ruffled hair all made him look much younger than he really was. She remembered the drooling mouths of her friends when she’d introduced them to Trevor and how they’d constantly talk about him. But to Zoe, Trevor was just a sleaze wrapped in a pretty package.   “What the hell is wrong with you, Zoe?” Trevor yelled, his voice filled with disgust. Zoe dropped her head, staring at the ground. No one, except Trevor, could ever make Zoe feel so incompetent, so unsure of herself.   “I’m sorry.” She whispered.   “Damn right you are. You’re such an inconsiderate-”   “Trevor!” Zoe’s mom cried cutting him off, “It was an accident, calm down.” She put a hand on his shoulder then looked at Zoe, “Oh my god, are you alright?” Her mom’s voice was drenched with sympathy. Zoe reached up and felt the tears that were streaming from her own eyes. No, I’m not all right, and I’ll never be alright she considered saying. But, instead, she just nodded.   “Now Trevor, if you don’t mind, I’d appreciate it if you’d apologize to my daughter for being a jerk,” Her mom continued. Trevor sighed and in a fake voice said, “Zoe, I‘m truly sorry for being an ***.” He then pulled her into him for a hug. A kind gesture, any bystander would think; but it wasn’t a kind gesture at all. He hugged her a little too tight for a little to long. She felt his breath on her skin, sending shivers down her spine. She wanted to stab him.      any advice/criticism?   please and thanks.   --Kara

SundayMorninThoughts      We struggle but try to make sense of it all,      Troubled times and smoke dense walls,      The need to define to understand,      leads us away from the promise land,      It is this moment only that counts,      With that acknowledgement to hand the sole amounts,      To more than time itself,      As we start to ponder our inner wealth,      Try to experience beyond what we know,      The coherence of the unforeseen low,      Detach yourself from treacherous time,      Than latch and delve into the lecturers mind,      For what you can learn may be greater than you,      Patience is knowledge which you later salute,      Its enough to just be aware,      Your love is beauty when only striped bare,      Into the world we constantly stumble,      upon a path of design so humble,      Life like design of words i write,      Slip to easily from dark to light,      Never finished the divine infinity,      signs that point to an empty city,      I ask only for peace of mind, some sacred time,      a possibility of living free, escape the life of symmetry,      Which is hard to bear,       unless we share?      a parallel dignity.

Sadness   Maureen Benoit   2/22/09         Gray hair softly falls around her face   She quietly pulls a brush through her hair   She pulls on her white blouse,the one with lace   She walks outside her home,the land is bare.            The fire that happened   Has destroyed her soul   All her family died   And now she must go,            She tries to leave the memories behind   But she knows that she must go on alone   The wind gently flows around her and her   Gray hair softly falls around her face.

20090222120302AAAXmte	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	How did you find meaning in life?	I'm 21 and never been in a relationship, nor desire to be in one. I'm probably asexual. I think society puts way too much emphasis on relationships and finding that special someone. Why can't people just be happy with themselves? People think that being in a relationship will automatically make them happy and solve all their problems. Why is there obsessive interest over relationships?   I'm not really that close to anyone. I only have one or two friends. It's hard for me to get close to people in general...kind of because I don't see why people would want to hang out with me. So I guess in some ways, I have low-self esteem. I don't think I've ever emotionally opened up to another human being..   My question is, am I missing out on what life is all about?      Part of be doesn't believe in love and thinks it's just a silly human emotion. However, that means, every other human emotion is silly as well. So I do realize my thinking is slightly skewed. I also realize that just because I don't believe in love, doesn't mean it's not valid.      I also realize that part of my inability to love probably comes from the inability to love myself. However, it's not like I hate myself either. I do think I have some good qualities, but overall, I'm just don't really care.   I realize that when I get out of college, I'm just going to have a career and ultimately die. Yeah there will be fun times in between..but in the end..we're going to die.

20090222115959AA9tSye	Arts & Humanities;Dancing	Please help?!?! Ideas and songs for dance routine?!?	Ok, well, my friends and I are dancers, and we were asked to do an opening dance for a huge dance studio performance... like, this place is HUGE in the dance world... We're SO excited, because we like, all LIVE for dance. We're planning on doing a latin/contemporary routine... It sounds weird, I know... but one of our dance instructors taught us about blending different dance genres into one dance... But we're not sure of what song... We were thinking about maybe doing "Every Little Thing She Does Is Magic" by The Police, because the verses are good for contemporary and the chorus is good for latin, but no matter how much we choreograph it, there's not enough content in it... Anybody have any good ideas for our dance or a good song along the same lines of the one we picked?! Please?!      Thanks!

20090222114929AACOpGQ	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	What is a persons weakest link?	Suppose you sent a letter or email to someone and nothing negative was directed towards them personally in that letter. Lets say it was about a third party or object.       Now, suppose that person took offense at one particular statement or comment in that email or letter but nothing else in the letter bothered that person.   I would personally consider that particular statement or comment to be the persons weakest link as they say since they feel strongly about that single statement or comment.       What do you think? Is it the weakest link or do you have any input.       For example :If I wrote about the economy and how I thought that this bailout was unfair towards homeowners who have paid their mtgs and is giving a handout to others...and then said in the same email that I hated it that cats were running wild all over my neighborhood and nothing was being done....   And then I wrote about how I hated to men in toupee's because I thought they looked fake...   which statement would evoke the strongest response in you and why?

20090222125449AAmQwcF	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Is This Story Good So Far?	I sat, slumped down inside her seat, dreamily. She was in a daze, not listening to a word Miss Hamilton said.         “Did everybody get that?” Her voice echoed. Everyone nodded, as if they were bowing down to her. She was a new teacher, after the former teacher, Mr. Rogerson, retired. He was the clown of the school – Un-like Miss Hamilton. Suddenly, she turned to me sharply.        “Kayleigh, did you hear what I said!?” She shouted, clearly looking angry. I stutter a bit, before I say…        “Yes Miss, we have more homework than last week”, I say. She shakes her head. It looks like it is about to fall off! She then asks the class to tell me the news.         “We’re having a school trip”, Nathan says. That’s just like him, always being the teachers pet. I shrug slightly. For some reason, Miss Hamilton sends me out. Apparently, “I’d been very rude”. But it doesn’t bother me about that, oh no. The worse thing is standing in front of the Head Mistress’s door. I knock then I hear a squeaky-as-a-mouse voice saying come in. I walk in calmly, breathing in and out.      Opinions Please!!! Thankyou :)

The problem is that I don't know how to word it. How can I make it make more sense. Here is just one example of what I'm talking about. Saying my sister is a leaves doesn't make sense. Saying my sister are leaves doesn't work either. Here is my poem. Thanks!      “My Family is a Tree”   My mother is the root system.    She anchors us securely in the ground.   But doesn’t hold any of us “down”.      My father is the trunk.   His outer bark protects us and his inside carries the nutrients to us all.   All of his layers work together to keep us tall and strong.      My brother is a branch on our tree.   He reaches towards the sky.   He also is sturdy enough to deal with the unexpected like the tree house.      My sister is a leaf on our tree.   I think it’s amazing that she can take light and turn it into energy and hope.   Then each year in the fall when school starts our tree loses its leaves.      I am the helicopter seed.   I fly thought the air full of potential.   Will I land in barren clay or fertile soil.

I'm currently doing a project at college all to do with texture (for textiles.) I've tried looking on the internet but i can't seem to find any artists which i particularly like. My whole idea is based on circles and layers and as the project is based on texture we are not allowed to use colour in our designs, so the artist needs to really only use white/cream/grey/black in their work.       Also does anyone have any advice on how to make sure my work is of a high standard? What should i include? Any ideas would be much appreciated :) x

20090222122123AAfKHAQ	Arts & Humanities;Visual Arts;Photography	Price on a pentax k1000 and lens  help please?	A friend of my grandpas is offering to sell me a pentax k1000 as long as I give him a reasonable offer for it.        He says he has only taken 2 rolls of film with it and couldn't get them to expose properly so he put it away. (He isn't a camera type of guy, I think he just didn't understand the camera).  I believe he bought it new and it seems to be in good condition.      It would come with 1 lens  a kalimar 28-200mm lens.  (I don't really like it.)  and a sunpak external flash.     The camera has a haze filter on the front but doesn't appear to have a lens cap.        I have looked on ebay and from what I am seeing you can buy one for 30-60 dollars with a nice lens, sometimes even up to three.  Is 40-50 dollars a fair price to offer him?

I'm writing this story and I'm thinking about a suicide ending but I'm not sure if it's a good ending or just the easy way out         I know it's hard to answer this question judging on the fact that i haven't told the story, the plots complicated...to make it short and simple the main charcter is this young women that is a sadistic, hopeless romantic, with an eye for losers and older men...she is a self loathing bisexual lush with a seesaw drug addiction and she ends up in a twisted love affair with an older man, his daughter, and her boyfriend who is in jail for raping this mans daughter (but that completely twists around at the end of the story)...the situation she's in isn't leading to any happy ending, so I'm just thinking about suicide      so my question is...what do you think about stories that end in suicide, are they compelling or do you throw the story down and say "wow what a crappy ending"

The characters were Jewish and in hiding.  They were in a country setting, and at one point hid in haystacks.  They also hid behind a false wall in a basement.  The family had a mother, father and two or three children.  The girl's boyfriend was hiding with them.        That is really all I remember.  I'm hoping for a miracle...    Thank you.

20090222115545AADMjUO	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	A Separate Peace, help !?	I apologize for writing so much !         I want to draw my visual, and I have a few things in mind.   There are a few topics to pick from, but I'm either choosing co-dependency, identity or creation of inner enemies.       I am not allowed to just draw a scene, and it has to have a deep thematic approach.      The main topic, that I can actually think of something for, is Identity.       Gene wants to blur his own identity, to lose himself in another (when he puts on Finny's clothes which symbolizes his desire to leave behind his own self and become Finny)      I could draw Gene really small looking into a mirror, seeing a bigger "better" version of himself. (This will have the visual elements of balance and perspective).       Or just have Gene looking into the mirror, seeing Finny, but with a blurred face. I would do this to show that he's not sure who he sees.      I also wanted to draw Finny with a broken leg, looking into a mirror seeing Gene. I would do this because Finny now feels the need to live through Gene (I don't know if this idea is very good).      Finally, I wanted to draw a peace sign around the whole drawing, using the sign to separate the two "scenes".  This would mean that being the other person would make them both peaceful /happy.      What are your thoughts of how I could improve the drawing, or what do you think I should include ? I feel like I could make it so much better, but I have no idea what to do.

If God just wants us to be with Him for eternity, then why would He have created Earth/Hell/Limbo?      If you think God wants to test us first, why wouldn't He know already? He created us and is omniscient; wouldn't He have premeditated all of our actions?      Once we're all with Him, what would He then do? If God would send billions of people to Hell in an invalid test, what makes you think He wouldn't cease your existence so He could go on to another celestial experiment?      Are our finite minds/spirits truly capable of comprehending any eternity?

20090222131116AAiebFg	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Help finding a good book at my reading level?	I'm in seventh grade, but I have about an 11/12 grade-college reading level (I'm not sure exactly what my level is, I'm just recalling what my mom told me a couple years ago).      So my problem is, I've searched for books at my level, but most of them are boring 1,000 page classic novels like War and Peace or Jane Eyre. I like sci fi/fantasy and adventure novels, so it's really hard to find a good balance, since most higher-level novels are historical fiction.      Does anyone know any good books? I recently read Lord of the Flies and thought it was good, though kind of slow I admit.      Thanks in advance!

20090222141138AA0QNzy	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	What book do you think is a must-have for every bookshelf?	I read The Other Hand last year when it first came out, and it's one of my most favorite books ever.       It was so easy to read, yet the target audience was the adult market. There was no sex, so I think even children could read it. It was powerful and moving, but not in a cheesy way. There was no traditional happy ending, yet it was satisfying.       One of the things that make the book special is that the story isn't summarised, so I'm not going to go into it, but it's definitely something everyone should read :)
20090222135420AA8wu2U	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	What would you do to improve this hasty sonnet? (suggestions)?	“Black”      If every color’s absent in what’s black   Why is this absent hue found everywhere?   It is the world of the insomniac   Who ruminates all night in dire despair.   It is the essence of the raven’s cloak   Who comes to mark the stealthy step of Death,   The moonless night before the morning broke,   The final curtain that all severeth.   Black is the color of a world of blight   Where all that’s wrapped in brighter raiment dies;   Black is the color not one will invite,   Yet in the end not one lone soul denies.   Black is the bound and border of our lives —   It feeds the very heart that it deprives

20090222131404AAFiN6j	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	What ya think of this part of my story?	Jordan turned around and saw Elizabeth playing with her finger nails and Gregory watching her. Elizabeth picked up a magazine and layed down. Her long, curley brown hair fell over the side of the couch. Gregory looked away and started druming his fingers on his lap.         Jordan went onto iTunes and played a beatles song. Elizabeth started humming to the song. Gregory assumed she liked the song so he quietly started singing along.                "When I say that something                  I wanna hold your hand                  I wanna hold your hand                  I wanna hold your hand...."        Jordan was able to hold back his laugh. Elizabeth smiled. When Gregory saw her smile his face brightend - I make her smile- he thought.        Jordan stopped the song but Elizabeth kept on humming. Gregory continued singing. He then drifted in to a hum and then stopped, so did Elizabeth. They sat in scilence.        Footsteps were heard from upstairs. Then Megan came running down the stairs" Well I'm in the living room and I hear music and singing so I figure hey, someones gonna bring me to join the party. Well now it's 6:15" she looked at her brother who was completly ignoring her then at Elizabeth reading Seventeen. She turned to look at Gregory, he was watching Elizabeth "No one has come to get me. Is there a secret club?"         Elizabeth didn't look up from the page"Yep."         "Well can I join?"         "Sure."         Megan sat on the floor by the wall next to the couch "So what were you listening to?"        "Beatles." Gregory answered.        "And who was singing?"        "Me."        "Sure it wan't Jordan?"        " I think i know when I'm singing."        "Mmhmm." Megan nodded.        Gregory mummbled "*****." but no one heard.

20090222135339AAOLlQM	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	Is MATRIX based on SCHOPENHAUER philosophy?	Since i saw the first time Matrix movie somehow reminds me of Schopenhauer's philosophy.      "..he believed that it is possible to pass beyond experience and to know the thing in itself. According to him, if we were merely rational beings, endowed with sense and intellect but devoid of volition, we would never be able to answer the question: "What is the external cause of our representations?" The world would be for us a dream, a mere representation, a mysterious signal devoid of meaning. But each one of us is also a body, and the corporeal life reveals itself as tendency, effort, activity, or in a word, as will. Will, therefore, is our reality.      Now, because of the monistic concept of Schopenhauer, the reality which we are (will) must be extended to all things in nature. Thus the entire reality is will. The primordial will is a blind unreasoning impulse to self-preservation. In other words, primordial reality is the will to live. The blind impulse to life is the cause impelling the will to display itself in a multiplicity of natural beings, with the purpose of becoming conscious. Hence this impulse makes its appearance in natural bodies in the form of mechanical forces -- in plants as vegetative life, in animals as instinct. Finally, by constructing the brain, the will attains consciousness in man. Once consciousness is attained, knowledge appears as the representation of the world.      Schopenhauer reduces all Kantian cognitive forms to time, space and mechanical causality. The will, in so far as it is universal, is beyond all these determinations of time and space and is lacking in any other determination. When it objectivates itself, it determines itself in a series of phenomena which exist in space and time and are connected with one another by mechanical causality."      What do you think of this?

I have to write a narrative fictional essay of The Great Depression, however, I don't want to write about the Stock Market Crash, or the presidential election, I want to write about a teenagers experience of the time. I have chosen my main character to be a young teen, named Kate. I have done some research, but have not gotten a lot of results. I want to story to center around the hardships that she experiences.    This is what I learned from my research:       -Black tuesday      -Roaring twenties      -"flappers"      -apple stands on the street corners      -men leaving home in search of jobs      -hobos/Hoovervilles      -bread lines/soup kitchens      I want part of it to be her comparing her present life to her former priveleged life, but I still need some research, and I am completely clueless as to what the events throughout the story will be, because it can't just be her sulking about being poor. So if you have any ideas as to what the events throughout this story should be, please answer! Also, if you happen to have lived through that time, please share your experience as a child or teen!    Thank you for your time!

20090222131256AAvd10u	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Is this good(a segment of a book im writing?)?	Raven,Robin, and Rachel stood before me. They hissed.   "It will all be over soon.."Robin hissed. I felt the urge to run, but their gaze held me in place. I finally withstood their gaze and ran. I ran as fast as my legs could take me. They tranformed into bats and flew after me. Tears and rain streamed down my cheeks. I wanted to scream, to run away from them. I couldn't find my voice. Their agile beauty suited their true evil. I turned my head to look back, and pondered the question,How can a bat be so pretty? I wasn't going to answer that. I just continued running. Why didn't they run after me?They could have killed me in a fifth of a second. So why not if they wanted me dead? I tripped on a rock that sent me flying, and crashing face down into the dirt. There was gravel and dirt in my hair and on my face. My clothes were soaked. The three sisters then transformed in front of me. Rachel leaned in, and picked up my chin, whispering,"Death is easy, don't you agree?"Raven squatted next to me, and grabbed my nech.   I felt a slight pressure on my neck, and went limp. I've only thought about death once before. I felt a burning flowing through my veins. I felt the icy rain tap me with every drop. They wanted my life to end. They had told me that they wished death more than being a vampire. I wanted the opposite, but now I regret my choices I made. They got their revenge. They damned me for eternity. I grasped a rock near me, and through my blurry eyes and pain, caught a glimpse of the tree sisters and threw the rock at them which with the strength I had, traveled two inches from me.   "Hard isnt it?"whispered one of them.   "To be so weak, and yet weaker this moment,"said another.   "We won't spare you, we won't kill you. You shall be like us,"whispered Raven.   "I'm sorry,"I choked out.   "Too late,"they replied in chorus,"If only you kept your mouth shut..."

Now as many of you may or may not know, the government recently ordered all children's books published before 1985 to be disposed of, because they could contain lead.       I was at my local thrift store and saw a dumpster full of old classic books being disposed of because of this mandate.       I wanted to know, what do you think of this monstrosity? Disposing of books...it breaks my heart.      If there books are so "dangerous" then why are we not all brain dead.       Not to mention the fact that to reach a toxic amount of lead from these books, you'd have to be EATING them.      Libraries are supposed to either dispose of the books, or move them to room where children will not be allowed. Does that make any sense?       I feel more and more like we're living in world that echoes The Lottery, Nineteen Eighty Four, and Fahrenheit 451.      Opinions?

20090222134232AA2cNok	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	What is your judgment on this?	Let x = #A#B# and y = #B#A# .   Let x is changed to y, i.e., #A#B# is changed to #B#A#.      In the change from x to y, the order in which A and B exists in x changes, A remains as A only, and B remains as B only.      Is it appropriate to say that A is changed if A remains as A?   One would say that A is changed only if A does not remain the same.   No one would say that A is changed if A remains as A.      Is it appropriate to say that B is changed if B remains as B?   One would say that B is changed only if B does not remain the same.   No one would say that B is changed if B remains as B.      Is it inappropriate to state that EVERYTHING EXCEPT THE ORDER REMAINS THE SAME in the change from x to y?

20090222130105AABNO3k	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	How is the best way to add a character?	I am in the process of writing a book in the Romance genre and would like some advice.      I have completed my first draft, and think it would be better if I added another character.  Currently, in the plot, a man is madly in love with a woman: all of the emotions in the book are about her, so reading it back it looks like the man is obsessed, which I would like to avoid.      My plan to solve this trivial matter is to add another character - a long-term female best friend (with whom he is not sexually attracted to), so I can show that he doesn't have a one-track mind.      My question is this:  How would be the best way to integrate this new character?      My immediate thought is to print my first draft and rewrite it all, adding the new character in as I go.  This would make it seem like this new character has been around all along, with no sign of her being an obvious addition.      A second thought of mine is to simply add bits about the new character into the storyline by editing my first draft.  This would be no-doubt the most practical option, but I'm concerned that it will be obvious that she is an afterthought.      What do you think?      Would you do it differently?      Oh, by the way, we're looking at around 50,000 words (approx. 92 A4 pages) so option 1 will take a while.

I am writing a book, but I need a few interesting ideas to move the story along. Any ideas?        A woman who is really smart in science discovers a way to create an animal/human hybrid. She decides to use horse genes and mixes up the different reproductive genes of both human and horses to create the hybrid. After everything is set, she combines the male and female genes inside a horses womb (too afraid to try in her own) which successfully gives birth too two horse/man hybrids (male and female). She also does this with other mammals like cows, sheep, ect.. The story is mostly based on how she raised them after birth and the decisions they take on afterward.      Any ideas would be appreciated.

Is it unhealthy to have violent rape fantasies if there is no chance of actually doing it?      Since I was about 12, I've had violent rape fantasies about women, including girls I know. Theres no chance I would actually do it. But rape is the ONLY thing that arouses me. I take great pleasure in women in pain and humiliation, and I just love seeing them abused. I'm even turned on by real life stories. I read underground comics, erotic stories and movies on the topic. I've ven written out some fantasies. And even just seeing women beat up arouses me. As do rape stories in news.      Again, I wouldn't really do anything. But I was just wondering if these were healthy thoughts. And if they're not what can I do to get rid of them?

Where I come from, we have cool, wet summers, and mild winters. Moving? America? New Hampshire? This all happened so fast. It seems like just yesterday, I was on my grandfathers golf course, on hole 7, in Scotland. Now where am I? In some small town, in New Hampshire. I have absolutely no idea what I’m in for.      Chapter One      “You’re names?” she asked. It was the school receptionist. She was short, with grey hair which had an obvious perm, square red glasses with a chain so they wouldn’t fall off. Her makeup was a nightmare, bright red lipstick, with blue eye shadow. Where the hell am I?  I thought to myself. The lady cleared her throat.   “You’re names?” I could tell she was irritated.   “Oh, Annabelle McGregor”    “And yours?” The receptionist asked my brother. Ian (my brother) was busy checking out a group of girls passing by in the hallway. I elbowed him.   “What the hell Annabelle?” Ian yelled.   “Ian!” I yelled. The receptionist was shocked at his behavior.   “You’re name?” She asked again. I looked at Ian and he was checking out more girls.   “His name is Ian McGregor.” I said embarrassed.    “Thank you. Here are you’re schedules.”    “Thank you.” I dragged Ian into the hall.   “What is your problem?!” I yelled.   “Hey, calm down I was just looking at the schools interior.”   “You mean looking at girls.”   “Well, yeah, but hey American girls are cute.” I rolled my eyes at him.   “Do you have any idea how embarrassed I was in there?”   “Sorry Annabelle, just let me have some fun.”   “You better not mean what I think you mean.” Ian raised his eyebrows at me and smiled.   “Pervert.”   “Have fun with your first day.”   “You too.” I watched Ian stroll down the hallway looking for his class, I looked at my schedule and map and started looking for room 12-B – American History. It took me twenty minutes to discover 12-B was on the second floor. Another ten minutes and I reached my destination. I stood in front of the wooden door, and braced myself for any possible thing that could happen. I opened the door and walked in. The teacher, a tall man, who in my opinion looks in his early thirty’s, with brown hair, and glasses, was in the middle of a lecture. As I walked in everything went silent. I froze, swallowed my nerves, and walked towards the teacher.   “Uhhm, hello... I’m Annabelle McGregor. I’m new here”   “Well hello Annabelle. I’m Mr. Poole, glad to have you in my class.” He smiled at me.   “Thank you, glad to be here.” That was definitely a lie.   “Well would you like to introduce yourself to the class?”   “Uhhm…” No I would not like to at all. I want to go home, where I have friends and I know my teachers, and I’m good at school.   “Go on, tell them you’re name and some things about yourself.   “Okay…” I walked to the front of the classroom and cleared my throat.   “Uh hello. My name is Annabelle McGregor. I just moved here from Stirling, Scotland. I have a twin brother named Ian. I play cricket and golf…I’m sixteen and this is my first time in a public school.” Nothing happened. Silence. A boy coughed. That was it. I wanted to run out of that room as quickly as possible.   “Thank you Annabelle. Welcome to America and welcome to Alton Bay High.” Mr. Poole said clapping. I smiled at him.   “Now, here’s your textbook, and you can have a seat next to Jon.” Mr. Poole pointed to a tall boy with curly dark brown hair, and deep brown eyes. Jon lifted his hand up and opened his palm. I’m assuming his gesture was an attempted wave. I take my textbook from Mr. Poole, thank him and head towards my seat. I sit down and get organized.   “Hi, I’m Jon Henderson.” He said holding his hand out. I stared at his hand, then him.   “You’re supposed to shake it.”   “I know, Scotland is civilized for your information. I was just taking this all in.” I said, shaking his hand.   “I’m Annabelle McGregor.” I smiled at him.   “Yes, I know. You’re speech was very intriguing. Pleased to meet you Annabelle McGregor.”   “Pleased to meet you, Jon Henderson.”   “Talented.” I gave him a funny look.   “What?”   “You can be lost in thought, and still listen.” I laughed.   “It’s called multitasking, it’s not that hard.” He just smiled at me.   “Jon, stop distracting Ms. McGregor.”   “Sorry Mr. Poole.” An hour passed and finally the bell rang. I gathered my things and took out my schedule and map.   “What class do you have next?” Jon asked. I looked at my schedule.   “Oh, um…Biology.”   “Well as your luck turns out that’s my next class. So you can put away that map and walk with me to class.”   “Thank you.” I put away my map and walked with Jon to biology.   “So. Scotland.” He attempted to say ‘Scotland’ with a Scottish accent but it sounded more like a mix between, English and German. I laughed.   “Yes, Scotland, are you from here?”   “No actually, I moved here two years ago from Michigan.”   “Cool, although I have no idea where Michigan is.”   “It’s by Canada. Do you know where that is?”   “Yeah, it’s up there r

But shall those words be revealed and brought in to the light.   Their world will change or end it might.   What a plight, which choice is right?      Shall I speak the words I know?   Or forever away I stow?    Lives will be ruined they’ll have a row.   Or lives at risk who don’t even know.      Shall I betray one friend, one mate?   To save another from a dreaded fate?   Or shall I keep it till the gate?   And wait to see if God’s irate.      The choice is mine, my burden to hold.   I never asked to be told.   I wonder how it will unfold.      What a decision I have to make.   But with all that is at stake,    How do I know which path to take?

I usually read complicated stuff like Stephen King but lately I'm in a light reading mood (hence the YA books) and a romance typish is what I want to read. Just not the boy meets girl, they fall in love, something horrid happens to separate them, they come back together anyway. Does anybody have any suggestions?

I write alot of fanfictions as I've posted some of my chapters on this site already to see if they sound Ok. But I'm now having some problems.      I've been asked by a few people on one of the sites I write to write another fanfiction, I was going to call it 'Unwanted' 'Another Day' OR 'Keep Holding On'.      The problem is I don't know which title to use, and I've sat for hours now trying to think of an amazing story plot but it just isn't happening for me with these titles. So I was going to ask would anybody be able to give me a slight plot (a sad one) and it's about the band Tokio Hotel. I'm not asking for you to completly write the story for me, just help me out, and I would give you credit for it on my fanfictions sites. I would give you the website link.      Please don't leave comments like 'find out yourself' and stuff I know that, and I'm not trying to ask people to write it for me I just need a slight starting plot and I would give you 10 points for the best answer and I would give you credit for it on my site.      Thankies x

20090222151810AAQKVwc	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Anyone else irritated with James Patterson's writing?	Okay, no offense to those who like/love him, but some of his stories make me have a "feeling" inside which makes me want to tear his throat out.      Example:      Maximum Ride 1-3: He acts like a FOURTEEN YEAR OLD GIRL.      He assumes he talks like one too.       I've been fourteen--I sure as hell didn't talk like that.      His other stories.      They are confusing and he uses curse words as fillers or something. They're not really necessary.      His books involve sluts and preppy women, and he probably just loves being women for his book.      Not that I have any problem, but it's like he's lusting over a character in his books.      ...Comment onwhat you think?
