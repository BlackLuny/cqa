20070219134209AA7uetj	Home & Garden;Garden & Landscape	Banana Tree question?	I've had a banana tree for about a year that is about 3-4 feet high. It was attacked by knats- so I put it outside. The nursery I purchased it from said it could surivive outdoors with temperatures going as low as -20 degrees. It was outside for one day covered (at about 40 degrees) and the whole thing wilted. If I just leave it, can it revive in the spring? or have I murdered the poor thing?

I have 2 units - upstairs unit is Carrier 58EFB075 and the green wire is disconnected (I noticed) at the control board.  The a/c compressor is not working - and it doesn't seem we are getting as much air flow as we used to (though we are getting some).   On my downstairs unit 58EFB125, the green wire is connected at the control board and all seems to be working fine.  I'm finding online that the "G" terminal and green wire from thermostat usually control the FAN operation - while yellow is the compressor-on switch...  but I'm wondering if these work in conjunction with each other and that the green wire disconnection is what is causing the compressor to not kick on.   Our unit was working  fine and then suddenly quit.   I had been in the attic working on other stuff and may have bumped the wiring.    more questions may direct to timdaus@mac.com also  or timdaus2001@yahoo.com      Thanks for any insight and assistance!!!

Hi, some stupid bloody kids keep chucking vodka bottles over my backyard wall, and i believe they are aiming for my kitchen window. They have smashed it before, and i really don't want it to happen again, especially as i have two small children and a new puppy. I can't think of why they are doing it, as i've never offended anyone, and i can't think of any occasions where i might have even slightly upset any of the kids in my road. But i have found three quart bottles of cheap vodka smashed against my kitchen wall, and i think it's only a matter of time before they shatter the window, or seriously hurt me, my kids, or my puppy. Thank you for any suggestions x

Had Super Bowl Party, and apparently, a child dropped a crayon in the furnace yesterday and I didn't know it. When I cut the furnace on, it started smoking and so I cut it off. Once it cooled completely, I took the crayon out, and scrapped the crayon off the floor furnace and wipe the area where it melted. But there is still residue left (you can still see the red crayon) and it is still smoking and setting off the alarm. Please help, its cold in my house without my furnace and the smoke is overwhelming if I cut the furnace on. How can I get all the crayon out of the furnace? Or should I just let it burn off?

Horses (out of glue..lol), jellyfish, flowers, monsters, if you need a vase I can make you one that won't break, but will look like stained glass. They are, for the most part, tranparent and hollow. I made an Ostrich who (Louis), is 3/1/2 feet tall. He lives in my garden after retiring from the library circuit, touring.. The is a terrific artistic medium for so many reasons, including a glue stick cost 5 cents. Louis is made out of 676 sticks,about $40.00 and he has been sold for $200.00. Then the Patron gave him back to me! I sell alot but would like to make a book and then just make the Sculptures when I feel the muse. But at the same time I am aching to share this idea with others for sharing ideas and such. How do I go about making my artistic dreams come true. PS They like indoors/outdoors/no car dashboards! Yikes!

20061218080133AA7bZwY	Home & Garden;Maintenance & Repairs	How to resolve root problem in pipes?	I have a question about a plumbing situation I am having at home. Because you've been in the business for a long time, I wanted to get an opinion on products or solutions that would resolve the issue.      Last Friday, a plumber installed a new toilet in to my Father's guest bathroom. The plumber said, upon removing the old toilet, that we had roots growing into the pipes. He said fixing the problem would cost thousands of dollars (to pin point the problem, remove the roots, and fix pipes that may be brokken beneath or outside of the house). The alternative, he said, was snaking either the main line or the line directly beneath the toliet to remove the roots. Is this the only viable solution or is their a product we can flush down the only functioning toliet located in the master bedroom to clear out the roots?        What other solutions are available?
