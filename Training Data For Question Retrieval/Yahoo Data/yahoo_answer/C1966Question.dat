20090223135026AAwucz1	Consumer Electronics;Camcorders	IHave Video shooting issues! My problems will be hard to fix though.?	My friend and I have thought of ideas to make youtube videos that we probably won't put on youtube but we might. They might just be for fun. But anyways, some of them involve me dressing up. The problem is I don't have any dress clothes. I won't be able to get some for a video because my mom might not let me do what I want to with them in the video. And I don't really want her to know about the video. So I need to know how we could get the dress clothes I need. We don't want anyone to know about the videos thought. And expecially not about the dress clothes since I don't like to dress up. Well I do but I act like I don't because I don't like to dress up in public. And one of the videos include getting messy like pies and water, and possibly slime if we could get it. But I don't know how we could get the dress clothes that we need and how we could get down and dirty without anyone knowing. We've had video plans for about a year but we can't every do videos without my friend's sister there or without their parents or my parents around. Could anyone help please? Probably not. But if so thanks!

I had some REALLY important pictures on there. I was wondering if there is any way to get the pictures back... if not all then atleast the protected ones.    Answers ASAP please!!!   Thanks!!

20090223150420AAoBhKx	Consumer Electronics;Games & Gear;PlayStation	Will Best Buy give in?	I recently purchased the game Fallout 3 for PS3 about 2 weeks ago and I'm already on my 2nd copy because the game is just full of bugs and problems. I contacted the game maker but they gave no reply. It is a known issue on google and Best Buys tech support number agrees that they have gotten many other reports as well of issues with the game. All I want to do is trade the game out for something else cause Fallout 3 is unplayable for me. Do you think if I said,"Well if I can only get the same game again, then ill just come get a new copy everday." that they would give in to letting me exchange it for something else cause thats a waste of money to their business.

Should i try to purchase insurance on this new phone and wait a little while and then show them the problem, or do you think this issue could be solved simply by purchasing a new Q battery?   thanks alot

20090223154145AAGEQpH	Consumer Electronics;Camcorders	HV30 White Speckles! Are they normal?	Hey guys, I've just started editing the first stuff I filmed with my HV30 and am quite disappointed with what I've seen so far. Up until not too long ago I would edit everything with the video playback in Premiere being set to "fit" which meant it was usually in the 20-30% area. Everything looked fine when the preview was this size, but when I bumped it up to 100%, it just looked god-awful. Like really, just awful.      Now I'm not trying to be a complainer here, but I'm pretty fed up with this. Granted, the the footage was all shot indoors and therefore did not have the best of lighting, but the settings were by no means dark (every overhead light in the room was on and should have been more than capable of producing only a slightly grainy image). I also shot in cinemode, which is supposed to help with low light.      Okay, so anyways, on to the actual problems.      1. There are little sparkling white dots that appear on the footage at certain random times. These dots reside predominantly in very dark areas (such as shadows, dark shirts etc), but also appear on lighter, colored areas as well.      2.The footage plays like sandpaper. It is not smooth at all. The outline of any moving object is covered in jaggy things (artifacts?) For the record, I'm shooting in 60i mode.      3. Everything looks blotchy and is riddled with grain, even in areas where lighting was more than ample. Seriously, the footage is anything but sharp. It looks like a crappy consumer SD camera. Honestly, the best way I can describe it is that it looks like a video off youtube played on fullscreen. That should paint a picture.      So I'm irritated because I've seen my friend's SD 3CCD cameras film in conditions just like this and produce far superior images than my HD camera. Now I know that 3ccd cams will do better in low light, but my HV30 just looks like a joke. So I don't even really know what I'm asking here, but I'm hoping to get at least some answers. I guess my primary questions are:      1. Is there any way this is some sort of defect with the camera? Do any of the symptoms I described point towards that? I have to say I'm horribly disappointed with this camera if this is how it's supposed to be. But judging by videos I've seen on Vimeo, this camera looks amazing. Even in lower light situations nothing I've seen has looked as crappy as what I'm getting.      2. Am I somehow doing something horribly wrong during the editing process? I capture with HDV split and import the m2t files into a 60i time line in Premiere CS4.         Thank you guys in advance for any and all help with this. This whole ordeal is just really getting on my last nerve, mostly because I paid a small fortune for all this stuff (camera, editing software, etc) and have yet to see any reason for me to label it as money well spent. Thanks again.   Skelefun is online now Report Post

I've got a second generation Silver iPod Mini 4GB, the battery and iPod work fine, but sometimes when I try to play a song, it starts playing it as if I had a CD player and started moving it. Songs are played with glitches and blank spaces. Any ideas on how to solve the problem?   Also, I've restored it, and now it skips songs...I don't know what to do and please don't suggest to take it to an Apple store because I'm not in the US and it's hard to find one here.

20070723124811AAQtw4W	Consumer Electronics;Cell Phones & Plans	?Compartís la idea de que las compa?ías telefónicas son "área liberada" para la estafa?	Todas intentan cobrar deudas inexistentes especialmente MOVISTAR. Son literalmente estafadores con un staff de telefonistas ignorantes, soberbios y groseros (que cuando se quedan sin argumentos te cortan la comunicación). No hago responsables a los telefonistas sino a la empresa que los explota a ellos ya por su intermedio maltrata con total impunidad a los clientes.   Lo que más me llama la atención es que cada vez que comento estos intentos de estafa por parte de MOVISTAR, todo el mundo tiene algo similar para contar.   Venden los equipos con enga?ifas y capacitan a sus empleados para que lo hagan así. Cuando reclaman por cuentas delirantes termina uno como candidato al premio Nobel de la PAZ , sólo por el hecho de no haber estrangulado a los 21 telefonistas ineptos e incapaces de procesar dos ideas juntas y finalmente, SIEMPRE terminan dándote la razón, porque la tenés. Pero y ?el propio tiempo? ?y el desgaste digno de mejores causas?

20070715200145AAHHYqp	Consumer Electronics;Music & Music Players	?Por qué cuando escucho los temas mp3 que cargo en mi V3i en algunos tira "formato de archivo no soportado"?	El teléfono es sin iTunes, aclaro. ésto ocurre con la menoría de los temas, no todos. Sucede por ejemplo que yendo por ahí escuchando música, y plop!, de golpe se corta y tira una irritante "X" roja con el mensaje "formato de archivo no soportado"; lo raro de esto es lo siguiente: Hay "combinaciones", como por ejemplo uno es que la música se escuche hasta tantos segundos de haberse iniciado y luego salta el odioso mensaje mencionado, también ocurre que la música, cuando uno le da play, antes de siquiera escucharse tira ese error... y francamente ignor cuál podrá ser la causa :S   Si alguien tiene este teléfono con semejanta o igual problema y lo ha solucionado por favor le agradeceré enormemente su ayuda.   Una de las teorías que tengo es que podría bajarsele los Kb/seg hasta 128 para los que tengan más que ésta cifra, pero no quiero meter la pata sin estar guiado un poco antes.   Un saludo y espero sus respuestas! ;)

20070717184947AALn5zJ	Consumer Electronics;Cell Phones & Plans	Conoces este codigo de celular?????	?Porque los comerciantes de celulares no nos dan este dato?      Es una especie de venganza para el caso de que nos roben el celular:       Para obtener el numero de serie de su celular, marque *#06# sin marcar send, aparece en el visor un código.    Este código es único.    Tomen nota del mismo y consérvenlo en un lugar seguro. Si robaran su celular, avisen al operador y denle este código. Su celular podrá entonces ser bloqueado completamente, aunque el ladrón cambie la tarjeta SIM.    Probablemente no recupere su celular, pero por lo menos tendrá la seguridad de que quien lo haya robado no podrá utilizarlo nunca.    Si toda la gente tomase esta precaución, el robo de celulares seria inútil.       Interesante dato, no?
