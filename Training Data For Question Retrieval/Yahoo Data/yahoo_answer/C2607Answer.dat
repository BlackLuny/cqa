B6I3Ezaqaa	Your fine, just check the speed ratings on the tires and so forth....
82wXvW3baa	An airfoil, or aircraft wing, is curved on top but flat on the bottom. When this shape moves through the air at a high speed, the air moves faster over the top of the wing than the bottom. This causes the pressure on top of the wing to be lower than the pressure on the bottom of the wing. Due to this pressure difference, the wing is "sucked" into the air. If the wing is strong enough to not break, and is attached tightly to the airplane, it brings the airplane along into the air.|`|AOPuoo16aa	Because of a differential of pressure. Low pressure on top and higher pressure on the bottom.|`|32dffe7e0eba9eb2c4e6c9418ec99ba5aa	Any reasonably flat object can create aerodynamic lift if it moves through the air (or if air flows around it) in a straight line with a positive angle of attack; that is, with the leading edge higher than the trailing edge. Such an object acts as an airfoil.<br>  <br>  In such a situation, the airfoil will twist the air mass above it downwards as it passes, creating a persistent downwash behind the airfoil. The force exerted by the airfoil to accelerate this downwash towards the ground engenders an equal and opposite force that attempts to push the airfoil upwardsâ€”this latter force is lift.<br>  <br>  I'm not aware of any "true facts recently discovered." The mechanism of lift has been understood for many decades.  There are many popular explanations of lift that are incorrect in one or more details (including most of the other explanations you see here), thanks to some early misunderstandings that somehow found their way into the popular literature without being clarified or corrected, but the principles of lift theory have not changed.<br>  <br>  There are a number of different ways to visualize and describe lift, which tends to add to the confusion.  The one common thread of all correct explanations is that they result in acceleration of a large mass of air downwards, which in turn produces an opposing lift that raises the airfoil and whatever it is attached to.|`|aAhhVTnUaa	Currently there are 5 leading theories on aerodynamics which describe the mechanism by which an airfoil produces lift.  The leading and most widely supported theory is that of conservation of circulation of a vector field.<br>  <br>  For an airfoil travelling left to right (for visualisation purposes) a clockwise trailing vortex is induced by interaction of the lamina flow field beneath the airfoil and the downwash.  This introduces vector circulation in the flow field.  Because the flow field is a conservative vector field, a counteracting vortext is generated.  This counter-vortext rotates anti-clockwise about the entire airfoil.  The instantaneous velocities of the vortex sum to the instantaneous velocites of the global field resulting in an increase in field velocity above the wing and a decrease in flow velocity below the wing.<br>  <br>  Bernoulli's principle then describes the generation of the pressure gradient which, as is commonly disccussed and described elsewhere, produces a net aerodynamic action on the airfoil.<br>  <br>  I must close by stating that the difference in upper and lower surface velocity is NOT the result of the upper and lower flow streams having a requirement for their separation point and recombination point to be coincident in both space or time.  This is incontradiction to point (2) made by drwer2.    <br>  <br>  Kind regards.|`|5U9wKtgqaa	Because of the shape of the wing. Air molecules striking the leading edge of the wing take a path either over or under the wing. Being the top of the wing is curved it is longer than the bottom,the air passing over the top must accelerate to catch up and meet with their lazier buddies who went under. Bernoulli's principal says that as a fluids speed increases,it's pressure drops.So,the pressure on top of the wing is lower than on the bottom. So, the wing is pushed upwards towards the lower pressure zone. To better understand, remember, that two air molecules side by side when they hit the leading edge of the wing,will end up side by side at the trailing edge. Thats why the molecule that went over the top accelerates. It's "PFM", pure f..kin magic!|`|EsufC1qhaa	the wing is shaped such a way that the top is more curved than the bottom:  check this out <a href="http://www.laesieworks.com/ifo/how/pict/GN-Wing-Airfoil.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.laesieworks.com/ifo/how/pict/...</a><br>  <br>  as the aircraft moves fast, the air over the top of the wing takes longer to reach the other end. the air which is down arrives there quicker. this difference in speeds results in a pressure difference. the result is a net upward force called lift. so ur aircraft gracefully takes off .......  there u go <br>  <br>  obviously, my answer is very very simplified. there is technically a lot more to it (interms of aeronautics or mathematics) but don't worry. that's the basic idea anyway.. cheers|`|AA10023726	Okay. Here's one.<br>  <br>  The pressure differential is an artifact of the wing shape.  The pressure difference does not cause lift, it is the result of lift.<br>  <br>  1.  the curved upper portion is longer than the straight lower portion.<br>  2.  in order to meet at the same point at the trailing edge, air above the wing must travel further, and faster than below the wing.<br>  3.  air below the  wing strikes the wing at the "angle of incidence"  as air Piles up, its density increases.  <br>  4. the mass flow of air on the bottom of the wing presses upwards (pounds per second per square foot of wing area)<br>  5.  The difference of force between the bottom and top of the wing causes lift.<br>  <br>  The best way to measure these changes in density and force is to use (as bernoulli did) a manometer.  a glass tube filled with liquid.  the difference in Pressure was the only way to measure the force imparted by the impinging air's velocity. (V^2/2g) = rho-g-h<br>  <br>  wer|`|o8TK7d4vaa	all the above are true until the wings Angle of attack, so how many degrees the wing is towards the vertical component, reaches approx 14 degrees to 16 degrees, above this the pressure difference starts to create to much drag rather than lift which is how a stall happens.

It will certainly draw unwanted attention.<br>  <br>  2.  Will it make everyone within earshot hate motorcycles, and motorcyclists?  Yes.  Noise is a huge reason that many roads and areas are being closed to motorcyclists.<br>  <br>  3.  Is it bad for the engine?  Yes.  As stated in other answers, it could very easily lead to excessively lean carburetion, and result in possible engine damage.<br>  <br>  4.  Will it make everyone around you think you're an idiot?  Yes.|`|6f89b5d16dbdb895634e3f8c49efb428aa	You will probably lose torque due to low back pressure. Also, when you de-restrict the exhaust you allow the engine to breath better. This will cause a lean condition and your fuel mixture will burn hotter. This can lead to things like burned valves.|`|1TXUJPmLaa	Its just loud.<br>  You could get a noise ordinance ticket or in some states that regulate motorcycle emissions it might not pass.|`|f16135be2aee5d27de11802f8dd54704aa	Depends where you are.<br>  <br>  In the UK road bikes are required to have approved exhaust systems, marked as such. Not having one could result in a stop and inspect, or fix and test ticket plus a fine. Vosa have the power to declare the vehicle unfit to drive/ride and you could be looking at a walk home.<br>  <br>  Also, modern engines need some back pressure from the exhaust system and you risk some damage to the exhaust valves.<br>  <br>  Loud pipes are antisocial and lead to unnecessary restrictions being placed on the rest of us law abiding motorcyclists.<br>  <br>  So in short, yes it is bad.|`|850Tn0nGaa	it does need some sort of a end can to keep back pressure i would get a sports end can increaces performance and still sounds awesome hope this helps m8|`|qT3bi1Ynaa	It is illegal in all cases and annoying in some cases!|`|jFwuiRKxaa	Yes it is

That's it.<br>  "Hard Deck" is primarily for safety of flight purposes during training or to prevent violation of special-use airspace.  Has essentially nothing to do with surface threats.  Deconfliction for threats is handled via Air Tasking Order and Intel briefings for mission planning.<br>  Typically range time is valuable, so other ops are going on.  Putting in the framework of "Top Gun", while those guys were going air/air at FL300 there may well have been other training going on at lower Flight levels.<br>  FWIW, we'd never say "went below the Hard Deck" what really would happen is, "You've busted altitude/altitude restrictions" That sh(&( gets crews violated and sent home.

r1D9P4Vyaa	Your cars engine requires 9.5 volts to fire the coil pack. If the alternator and battery do not have at least that the engine will stop running. It will not cause one or two of the cylinders to stop and run with a misfire. Charge the battery, start the car and remove the negative battery cable. If the car dies that means your alternator has less then that out put. Then your alternator should be load tested. If it stays running then it is putting out at least 10-volts. (It should be at 13.5 to 14.5 volts) As far as the miss fire, do all the cylinders have the same compression? (about 120 psi) If you have replaced all that is listed then that would be something to do or have done to see what the compression is and go from there with a older car like that.

AA11580836	Well they stopped making the 626 and 323 by those years, while they were replaced with the Mazda 6 and Mazda 3 respectively. For me I've owned an older model 626 from 1998, Mazda 626 LX and I must say I love those cars and having seen the new versions I wouldn't mind having those either. I have never owned the old 323 so I am going with the 626.|`|RQzsmvfiaa	From my experience with the old 323 and 626s, the 323s were more reliable. However with the Mazda 3 and Mazda 6, the 4 cylinder 6 uses the same engine as the 3. The V6 option is quick but has some problems that were actually inherent on older 626s. Don't ask me why that is but it is. Still a 4 cylinder 6 will give you more room than a 3 because it is one step up over the 3. Still the 3 is a better buy IMHO. Mopst people I know that bought a 6 bought one because they really wanted a 3 but the 3s were costing almost as much as the 6. Food for thought....|`|bd2887f2ddb4e37e81ea083f8d7a28e8aa	I like the 626 because it just looks more appealing to me....But i have a  04 v6 Mazda6 and i love it|`|cDAkwCanaa	do you mean the 6 and the 3? Either car is great. I personally have the 04 6 and love it. Each car has their ups and downs. the 6 can come in a V6 option which is fast and the 3 only has a 4 cylinder but the 6 is heavier and the 3 is lighter. Either way, they are nice reliable cars.
HDBDl37Zaa	Okay $4000 is good amount of money. <br>  <br>  Option 1: <br>  If you want a year 2000 and above car, you should go to a dealer and use that as down payment.<br>  Option 2:<br>  Buy a 99 and below car and use the extra cash to fix/upgrade it if needed.<br>  <br>  If you do get an eclipse that is a 95-99 make sure it is a gts or gsx. These are turbo charged engines producing 210 hp stock. An eclipse gs 95-99 is non turbo and puts out only 140hp. <br>  <br>  And yes I do own an eclipse gsx which I bought for $2300. Spent under $500 to buy new parts such as a battery, new fenders, yada yada.|`|qySwoCUgaa	$4000 won't buy much of a car ,It is a good down payment though and with luck you will do all right.

It happened to my little brother last year.|`|23xC6I2Gaa	Since your license in "valid" that means you are able to go to the license office and get it reinstated... some states charge a fee, others actually take a new picture and do the whole ordeal - so its up to your state.<br>  <br>  You can take that new license to your county District Attorney's office as proof that you have a valid license and they can drop any charges against you.<br>  <br>  My license was suspended by mistake... I drove around for 2 years before I found out it was suspended. I never recieved any letter either. I still had to pay $100 to get my license reinstated, but all other charges and fees were dropped by the county DA.|`|a1ddcae78f9848320ad0b8246c9c1087aa	You license is either "Valid" or "Invalid."  If it is suspended, it is by definition "INVALID"
61d8dc7369c22a739f10dc4936702ea5aa	The Lexus LS 460 would be an exellent choice in it's class. Probably the best. The quality put in to a Lexus is untouched when compared to Mercedes, and BMW. This is the type of car that will lower your blood pressure the longer you drive it. But it depends on what your after in a car. Mercedes is going to beat Lexus every time driving at high speeds, maneuverability, and handling. Take the Mercedes  cls63 AMG for example, The MSRP is somthing like $96,300. 507 horses at 6,800 rpm, 465 Ib-ft. at 5,200 rpm. Not a chance in hell Lexus wins in that department. But the Mercedes is more than likely going to be in the shop 5 times as much as the Lexus. Yes they are beautiful cars but not worth it. Lexus LS 460 has somthing like a 360 horses at 6,400 rpm.  I mean, 0-60 in under 6 seconds isn't all that bad. The smart buy = Lexus hands down.|`|AA10643879	Excellent choice,sound system is phenomenal,navigation screen is the best to look at,and the power for a car that size will surprise you.If have money to spend,go for it.Only spend time in shop for oil change,not like the Benzs or BMWs break down so often and overpriced.|`|a0565811de871e19a5c2a7b27aeadf50aa	If you desire total isolation from the road, don't care about driving excitement, this car is for you.

d1ee48df00eb4b8567acf7a43aeb1c1aaa	Be paranoid (I'm sure you'll have that covered).  Especially when waiting for the bus.  Don't take along belongings you don't really need, travel light.  <br>  <br>  Know where the official bus stop is.  When you see the bus coming, be very visible.  You want the bus driver to see you standing up, looking his way etc. so he knows you want the bus.  Buses will not stop "anywhere".  They are only allowed to stop at official stops. (though sometimes the driver will let doors open anyway, if it's safe.) <br>  <br>  Whenever I ride a bus line for the first time, I sit/stand right up front near the driver.  This is for three reasons.  #1 I can see where I am, #2 I can ask the driver something if I need to, and #3 you're less likely to be hassled.  Remember, Rosa Parks stood up, um, I mean sat down, for everyone's right to sit anywhere on the bus you please!  However if you are in front, you must yield your seat to elderly and handicapped. <br>  <br>  Have exact change.  The bus driver cannot make change.  However you are allowed to overpay, so if it's $1.75 and all you have is $2, oh well :) <br>  <br>  When you get on board, find the cord or button to call a stop.  A bus won't stop unless a passenger calls for a stop by signaling (pull the cord, push the button etc.)  and  you need to do this about 1 block before the stop.  Ding it too late, and he'll stop at the next stop.  You can also tell the driver "please stop at so-and-so" and he's supposed to call it out "Next stop so-and-so" and stop there.  But realistically, bus drivers forget sometimes.  Watch for yourself.  <br>  <br>  When you are coming up on your stop, be totally ready and move fast. The bus will NOT wait for you to gather your things and head for the door.  You need to be already at the door and ready to go.  <br>  <br>  If it's your first time, exit through the front door, and dash out first, before people start boarding.  Normally you should try to exit through the back door, but this can be tricky, sometimes you have to step down to get the door to open, other times you have to push a button.  Also the bus driver has to unlock the back door, often the driver will forget and passengers will call "Back door!"  It's just too complicated for your first time, so use the front door :)|`|FFrXGuxMaa	Make sure you know what route to take, have enough money for it, and tell your parents what time to expect you home and where you are going. Keep an eye on your belongings also.|`|jyWKZaGJaa	I agree with everything logical1 says. Also you should add 15 minutes  to the time you think it will take for you to get back home even if its a 5 minute bus ride because the bus could be late and the bus also has other stops. BE AWARE OF YOU SURROUNDINGS. Use a bag with a zipper because pickpockets usually hit during a rush hour and whenever the bus is crowded.
ZORwInp4aa	It is a game for those that only want to move around the space without actually learning ANYTHING about it. IF you take it seriously it is not a game but a learning tool, you learn about aerodynamics, aviation, the instruments, how to control it. <br>  <br>  If you take it into another dimension by flying online in organizations such as IVAO (ivao.aero) or VATSIM (vatsim.net) then you are EXPECTED to know how to control your aircraft as well as have at least basic knowledge of aviation, maneuvers and radio communication (you communicate with human virtual air traffic controllers). You are also expected to be able to read/interpret aviation charts. Those are the things that make a difference between the average joe amateur who wants a game and those that use it as a cheap learning tool.<br>  <br>  Each a/c has its own dynamics. You can use the default a/c which are just too easy or download better ones, or buy those that simulate most systems and then you really learn even much more. It takes time and effort (and money).<br>  <br>  Default planes are a joke mostly. However in real life if I remember correctly there is at least one trainer aircraft that has the capability of restoring itself from stalls (for obvious reasons) but that is a special case.<br>  <br>  Then again, in flight simulator you can set your realism settings to maximum if you really want to learn. Or leave it as default or minimum if you just want a game. It is all up to you.<br>  <br>  Then again, it is a SIMULATOR not real life. Likewise, it is designed to run on everybody's limited computer resources and not on a supercomputer and because of that a lot of tradeoffs have to be made, especially for the price you pay.|`|P1Sl55Coaa	That's what simulators are for.  You can crash and then talk about it afterward.  It's a learning experience.  You can also do things in a real airplane that will kill you, and that's why they came up with simulators.|`|AOPuoo16aa	Because it is a game and should be treated as a game not a way to learn to fly.|`|AA10721549	because it's a game, that means a toy. toys are not supposed to supplement the proper training and education, when teaching you how to deal with real world phenomena.|`|b75427b8123ccfcf5f8c87fc21a99672aa	Haven't we all played cops and robbers? You are a cop now and a robber in the next...<br>  <br>  BTW, what in the simulator that you do will kill in a real airplane? That is other than crashing, in a crash you are dead and the game reloads. A game's reality depends on its physics programming, to bring every entity in the game completely governed by natural laws is beyond the scope of a game. So there might be some discrepancies. MS FS does come a lot close to reality.|`|32dffe7e0eba9eb2c4e6c9418ec99ba5aa	Because it's a simulator.  One of the advantages of simulation is that you don't die if you crash or do other potentially lethal things.  That's why simulators are used to train pilots to handle situations that would be far too dangerous to practice in the real aircraft.|`|R1vZHRIDaa	Because it is a game. Once your dead you can just start again.<br>  There is an unlimited amount of 'lives' and situations on FS so it will let you do what you want.

iQZcCqwfaa	My major qualm about this car is that it has front wheel drive. I cannot drift with this car nor do a wheelie even with major engine, transmission, and traction tuning. Front wheel drive cars may be slower than RWD becasue weight is sent to the rear wheels while accelerating. I cannot buy this car with this drivetrain even though it has a powerful V6 engine.|`|A0GEPCT3aa	Not enough horsepower.

2HKSwHkSaa	The VW Bus has quite a following.  Thankfully, they were around for quite a number of years, so you shouldn't have too much difficulty finding one that may suit your needs.  One thing that you must be certain to look carefully for is rust.  These vehicles tend to have a fair amount of rust (or rot) on them.  Then again, some of these have been on the road for 50 years, that is to be expected.   The biggest downside alot of people have the with VW Bus is they are woefully underpowered.  They have a tough time getting out of their own way.  Merging on the highway is quite an adventure in one of them.  You may want to check out the wikipedia page for additional info.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkswagen_Type_2" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkswagen_...</a><br>  <br>  Good luck with your search for your bus!|`|SOfbIOzUaa	What year.

jnes0R6Baa	Yes, they will fit.  The bolt pattern is correct, 5-114.  I don't think they will be lighter than your stock steelies, but they will be very similar in weight.

AR8kgyTIaa	KBB is not always the best guide for sales. Try getting a hold of the little NADA black book that all local dealers have.  As far as the price it really depends on the options the vehicle has and the area of the country you live in.  For instance the g35X=awd and awd= better than average resale in areas where the weather is foul. Also, if the G35X has the premium pkg-which you can tell by home-link buttons in the rear view mirror and the BOSE sound system with built in subs in the rear deck that also contributes to a little more than average cost. Basically if you live up north and you have a G35x with NAV and the premium pkg with a sunroof then 19k is not a bad price but I still would offer $17.5.|`|pFw7tJcNaa	Heya,<br>  <br>  Couple of things you should consider before your purchase.<br>  First off, the annual registered maximum alotted driving milage per year on a car is roughly 12k. Mouthfull I know. Basically, Calculate 12k per year from the month/year the car first began being driven, and anything 'too-much' above can be signs of excessive driving and abuse to the engine. Things like that don't come up on vehicle reports, it is just common knowledge. Based on this cars mileage, this car was treated decently. Also, are there any defects on the exterior and interior? Anything missing? If everything is in "perfect condition" then yes, between 17-20k would be a reasonable pricing range for the '05 infiniti G35x series.|`|Gt8o7ICLaa	Problem is that you're buying from a dealer. It seems to be a fair price, and the mileage seems right, but the dealer wants to make money too. Because it seems like a fair price, he's not going to sweat it if you bounce. So be courteous, and try and swindle the black hearted bas***d.

119ca40f98202d58cfc2090a452b22ceaa	I'm guessing you have the part time 4WD system.<br>  <br>  You can shift into and out of 4x4 high range at any speed up to 55mph, however I suggest you do not do that as it puts a sudden large amount of torque on the drive train components and will lead to an expensive failure of components.  I always tell people to slow down to 30mph or slower when shifting into or out of 4x4 High range.  <br>  <br>  To shift into 4WD Low Range slow down to 2-3mph shift transmission to neutral, shift transfer case to 4Lo, and then return transmission to desired gear.  To return to 2WD or 4Hi mode slow down to 2-3mph and put the transmission in neutral and shift the transfer case back to either 2WD or 4WD high range.  <br>  <br>  In 4WD high range mode you can go as fast as you want once the system is engaged, however you should never drive faster than the road conditions allow.<br>  <br>  In 4WD Lo Range mode you should not exceed 35mph as your pretty much redlined at that point anyways, you will damage the engine, transmission and transfer case by going faster than that.|`|bW931jBaaa	I dont recomend shifting into 4 wheel drive without coming to a complete stop first<br>  You can go as fast as you want in 4 high and 4 low will let you do about 35 or 40 mph|`|KPFQBQa1aa	According to the manual you can shift form 2hi to 4hi at any legal speed.

I would still try to snag it for less, only a fool would not, lol.  You'll have a much longer lasting engine that has a lot more potential with the 12v over the 7.3.<br>  <br>  Also, to whoever said that the Cummins is the noisiest, you're wrong.

As long as it's in mint condition it would be worth 7,000 dollars, but if not, you for sure can find cheaper generation 2 dodge diesels.
AA11652224	none really, it only enhances the sound. For there to be gains you'd need to open up the entire exhaust (eg: high flow cat or no cat in downpipe).

If you mean that the "bum engine" has internal damage, then you should be able to mix and match to make it work. That is just me talking from my long ago ownership of one. The best thing to do is to get out there with a tape measure and check the mounting points, then check the details to see if they are at least visually similar. My best advice would be to head over to the local dealer and see if they will run a bunch of parts through the computer to see if they interchange year to year. <br>  <br>  Good luck! With 7 years between the two years, I would carefully check before committing any money to the project.

VEGJlMrsaa	no no no no no!<br>  <br>  Stick with your mechanical engineering at the school your at now.  My best suggestion would be to ride that train as far as it will take you. Get yourself a good engineering job with a great income and then get your pilots license and fly for the fun of it.<br>  <br>  Knowing that many people (myself included) won't listen to advice like that because they want the immediate gratification of flying now, not in 15 years, I suggest you do a lot of research.  <br>  <br>  You do not need an aviation degree to fly, in fact some places won't accept an aviation degree (Nasa being one of those places).  You also don't want to put all your eggs in one basket. Get your degree and go to a local airport and find a flight school, don't pay extra for some degree program, you have that covered already. Just learn to fly.<br>  <br>  Loans may be difficult to come by, I had a hard time getting some a few years ago and I'm sure they are harder to come by now. <br>  <br>  Aviation is a great hobby, awesome actually. But it is not the great career choice it once was. Hopefully that will change sometime soon, but a non aviation degree is always a good thing.

dQrBlk4qaa	There's no real need for a twin-turbo - you want a well-matched setup that will give you excellent manners AND power. <br>  <br>  My personal choice for the LT1 turbo kit is the Squires setup. Its a rear-mount turbo that replaces the muffler. It runs cool so you don't need to "after-idle" the turbo to cool it down. Its total stealth - from under the hood it looks like just another cold air kit. The turbo gate sound from the rear is flat out cool. And, it runs like a scalded cat.<br>  <br>  This is my targeted set-up for my '95 Z28, when I'm done with some of the other modifications. Take the money you save by running just one turbo, and get the LT4 conversion for your engine - that flow improvement alone is great, but with the single fat turbo - it'll really shine.|`|43DHFQnKaa	<a href="http://www.turbochargedpower.com/Turbo%20Kits.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.turbochargedpower.com/Turbo%2...</a><br>  <br>  this company is 1 of the best around for muscle car turbo kits,  & will have 1 available soon for your car.... you might want to talk to them and understand what preparations they recommend to your engine pre - installation of a forced induction system.<br>  <br>  of course as you are on stock internals you will be limited to mild boost (stock engine will fail under high heat-stress from power increase) so whether you do twin turbo or low boost supercharger - makes little difference (they all add about same increase in HP)...so you should select most economic build.<br>  <br>  normally twin turbo's are installed in high boost - very powerful installations & quite frankly your engine cannot handle that stress.<br>  <br>  cheers 04 cobra|`|UvIuhFBXaa	go with a supercharger. Less maintenance, less care and a superchrged lt1 will catch you right off the launch with your twin turbo. Turbo lag is annoying as SH*T especially as it gets older. Go with an intercooled supercharger from Vortech, trust me you will be happy.

d1ee48df00eb4b8567acf7a43aeb1c1aaa	In the old days, there were interurban railways.  These were electric high-speed railways, lightly constructed, and ran between 70 and 100 mph. No kidding. They were intended for 1-2 hour journeys between cities (say, Detroit to Pontiac or Flint).  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interurban" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interurban</a><br>  <br>  The largest and most dense network of interurbans, was in Michigan, Ohio, Indiana and Illinois  <a href="http://www.uwgb.edu/dutchs/westtech/XMODERN2.HTM" rel="nofollow">http://www.uwgb.edu/dutchs/westtech/XMOD...</a><br>  <br>  30 years ago, 11 cities in US/Canada had rail transit systems.  Today, that number is 37.  All of these new transit cities are conspicuously NOT located in Michigan, Ohio, Indiana or Illinois. <br>  <br>  Oh well, wait. I'm not counting the Detroit People Mover or the historic streetcar that ran downtown for awhile. <br>  <br>  Anyway, aside from Chicago and Cleveland system extensions (and incursions of the St. Louis system), I doubt any light rail systems will go into those four states anytime soon.   They just don't want them, proven over the last 30 years of proposed and planned projects that never went anywhere. <br>  <br>  It's a pity, the city of Detroit is absoutely ripe for a comeback as a New Urbanism town.  There are vast areas of totally undeveloped land (literally "un-developed", dismantled house by house) just waiting for a developer to roll in and do again what was done once.  I think if, as I expect, peak oil drives fuel prices up up up up, you'll see a re-shrinking of metro Detroit.  Sprawl suburbs like Chesterfield and Milford will shrivel up, while Detroit proper will be repopulated and gentrified.  And transit could drive that kind of transformation. <br>  <br>  There was once Amtrak service from Detroit to Toledo. The train from Chicago pulled into MC Depot, did its station stop, then backed out of the station and went down to Toledo. It was awkward and slow, but it worked.   However, then they moved the Detroit stop to the New Center area, and ran the Amtrak up the old commuter line to Pontiac.  That just made it totally unworkable.    The only reason the train ever went to Toledo was to meet the Lake Shore Limited from Chicago, it was usually pretty empty.  There's just no reason to run that train now.|`|6Gfz125Paa	The entire US as a whole needs to make a huge investment in rail systems right about... now.

It can blow ur oil seals for starters. Get excess oil out if its a lot.|`|ysclTmCoaa	Yes it can. Too much oil in the sump can cause the crankshaft to churn it up into a foam, which obviously contains air.

q4nrL1C6aa	A "free flow" exhaust system is one that has little or no back pressure, which should theoretically provide higher horsepower numbers at high rpm's.  The problem is that you lose the back pressure needed to produce torque at lower and mid range rpm's.

uLEpOpSMaa	I'd go with a cold air intake and lower rear end gears for better acceleration, such as 3.73s.  The lower gears will make the car quicker without modifying the engine.  You might also be able to get a larger throttle body.  I wouldn't spend a lot of money on it unless you go with a supercharger though.|`|dDPFWyPjaa	Intake and headers are good places to start, You can chip it if you want, nice tires will give you good grip for gettin off the line and through the corners.
82wXvW3baa	How does this relate to Aircraft?|`|hZHj0i52aa	I remember seeing that too. I think that is in the preview for a new movie thats coming out soon. I dont remember what its called. The storyline is about a guy that was about to lose his virginity but gets knocked unconsious is in a coma for a few years. When he wakes up he tries to find the girl who he was with and finds out she lives in the playboy mansion. So he travels there to meet up with her.

8ifKojOXaa	It sure sounds like a bad belt but it could be even water getting into a pulley's seal and that's why it squeals so much and that could be a sign of a bad pulley shaft seal. <br>   What you could do is call the big auto wreckers and ask them what previous Dodge Caravan models or year use the same belt system.Then you could simply go to a do it yourself auto wreckers and look under the hood of a vehicles and select , remove the best belts you can find, plus they'd be quite cheap like 5 bucks a piece and that save you quite a bit in cash too.<br>   I'd also try to have a reliable mechanic check the belts on that van and check the pulleys too., then if you need a certain pump or pulley etc you could pick them up at the same time you go to the wreckers.<br>  <br>  <br>   Hope that helps and best of luck.By the way it's not too hard to change the belts , plus you could always keep the old belts or pumps etc as back-up parts in case of a emergency too.It might be a good idea to get a friend that is handy with vehicles to help you and to purchase a service manual for that vehicle.|`|AA12261615	its just the belt getting wet on it ,all of them will do this if they get wet,there's really no way to avoid this if your going through a drive through car wash like that,you might try checking the tension on the main drive belt,if its high mileage it may need replacing,but anytime one of those gets wet it will do that,until it dries back out,good luck.|`|ly3cE5T3aa	I never meet the thing like you.

3iZaJF9Saa	You also need to know the axle ratio,the axle ratio makes a big difference.Anything higher(lower number)then a 3.92 would not be good for towing,but since you have a 2500 I would believe you have at least a 3.92 axle.I would believe you towing capacity would be around 8500-10000 lbs.Also most people don't know that anything put into the vehicle such as cargo and people will lower your towing capacity.|`|AA12261615	gas or diesel ,because there's a big difference in the towing on those trucks,if its a diesel it will tow 15 thousand easy,good luck.|`|a93cc8d415c0fc45f404e2f1b774dd45aa	Probably around 13-14k i think the 1500's are up around 10k.

Have you been checking the oil as you know there's a leak?
Vp2qiF3daa	I assume that you already have a car in mind or know of good websites to look for one. If not there are free used car ad magazines in front of most grocery stores. You find a vehicle you think might work make sure to take it for a test derive preferably with a good friend who knows something about cars.  Most mechanics will do a general inspection for free or very cheap as well if you just explain the situation. When you do find one that is right for you get and do the following:<br>  1. Get a receipt. handwritten is fine but make sure it has at least the vehicles vin number, both party's information, the date and signatures. I once helped a friend buy a car only to have someone wreck into him six hours later and his receipt was his only saving grace. (no insurance, registration, or even title in that case.) <br>  <br>  2. Title. The owner should have this for you at the time of purchase and you both will need to fill out the appropriate areas. later you will take this to the DMV to officially transfer ownership.<br>  <br>  3. Insurance. If at all possible buy insurance for the vehicle before taking it home. You do not want all the hassle of dealing with a no insurance ticket or worse the financial responsibility of not having it.<br>  <br>  4. inspection. after you have purchased it it will probably be necessary to have a safety inspection as well as an emissions inspection depending on where you live. these are done by most local mechanics. make sure that they verify the vin number on your title while you're there. you will receive a completion of inspection form after doing so which will allow you to get your plates and tags from the dmv.<br>   <br>  5. The fees you will be charged will vary from state to state and even from county to county. the DMV will be able to tell you the exact charges you should expect.|`|TmPtVIiyaa	first thing to do is have a mechanic u trust check out the car or do a carfax report.|`|HAYlmwdtaa	1. find the car you like<br>  2. if you are leasing or financing you'll want to get a copy of your paystubs from the last 30 days<br>  3. you'll need a driver's license, proof of income, and you might need a copy of a mortgage or lease agreement as to where you live.<br>  4. you can pay cash, credit, or cashiers check<br>  5. you'll need to secure a downpayment-  the more you're downpayment is the lower you're monthly payments for the vehicle will be.<br>  6.  you'll need to get insurance before you can drive off the lot.  if you have an insurance company in mind tell the person selling you the car or else they will lock you into an insurance company that may have a high monthly rate (also depending on your age).  also insure your insurance will be either limited liability or full liability<br>  <br>  7.drive safely<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  -you can do a car fax, however not everything about the car is included in carfax.  also note that you are not covered by lemon laws, as the car is used not brand-new

5FghvtyLaa	Okay, I looked for a cheap CB also and heres what you need.<br>  <br>  You need to find a CB shop who will peak and tweak. You need a cobra 19 ($34 at walmart) a little Wil antenna ($40). <br>  <br>  Get the CB shop to peak a tweak and check SWR. Takes about 30 min. and $40ish. <br>  <br>  Without the peak and tweak you get 2 miles. With the tweak you get 12 miles on a average day. This is the cheapest way for the best results!!|`|oGPlraH4aa	Cobra 29ltd / radio shack  outdoor loud speaker  you know that the pa section is in mono
fQBfjdz1aa	no.  A hit and run is normally considered you hitting another vehicle or a building or other structure.  Guardrails and embankments I would  not necessarily describe that as a hit and run.|`|f038db3294ca7b44e88aa5770e91bbdbaa	Yes it is a hit and run. Guardrails are owned by someone, whether it be a municipality or a state or a private company. Running into it is damaging someone else's property, therefore you are usually required to contact the police in this situation since the police need to contact the proper authority to come out and repair it (BIG safety issue). You are also liable for the repairs.
9SgD78JIaa	Sounds like you might have an electrical drain. I'd go over to somewhere like Sears to get a drain test.|`|6e043c568931ce877b352cc49d6bc5f0aa	battery...|`|AA10725097	First you need to state if it cranks but no start or it has no crank. If it just cranks and no start, I would have a fuel pressure leak down test performed. You may have a bad fuel pump.|`|AA11862004	If it ran OK for 2 days then won't start again, it's not charging the battery. This could be the alternator or just a bad connection. Try cleaning the battery terminals & alternater connections.
uu6JYenAaa	If it has warning fins that "Chirp" when the brakes are worn down to a certain thickness, it could be that.<br>  <br>  Or it could be you have road dust in them.  Expose them and wipe them down with a clean cloth, if that's the case.<br>  <br>  It could be rust, but you would have seen that when you checked the pads.<br>  <br>  They could have overheated and developed "hard spots," which will require new pads if that's the case.
07ce5572ef0018214bb8690cf3d54796aa	it really depends on how much body work needs to be done and they will find something that needs to be sanded or repaired guaranteed. so that basic price they offer is never what you end up paying. they have to charge you for taping it off and other such nonsense. i had them paint a car the exact same color (white) and it came to about 1800.00 that included just a little sanding of surface rust around the windshield etc.  a side note: i have a friend who is a mechanic/body work guy (this was after i paid maaco) and he does his own painting professionally but also when he just wants to put a good paint job on a car that doesn't need to be professional just look good he uses spray paint. he has done several vw bugs and used the flat black, flat red and gray and also one with a semi-gloss tan, they all look great and you cannot tell they were done with spray paint. he also did a car with flames, taped it off and did them too with spray paint. it was incredible and looked better than most flames i have seen that ppl paid thousands for. if you aren't wanting an expensive professional job, why not get a couple of cans of walmart brand semi or gloss bright white and try it on a spot where you can't readily see it and do a trial spraying. the trick is to not hold it too close and to spray evenly back and forth, the natural tendancy is to move the arm back and forth like a swing action but you really have to make sure you keep it all even. try it you may find it will save you several thousand and you like the look.|`|AA11692179	I honestly wouldnt get one of there cheaper jobs. A friend took his Camaro to one and they didnt cover the windows or remove trim or anything. He had paint all over the glass and the  trim was the same color as the car. If you read all the fine print it will probably tell you that they have no obligation to cover anything on the car. Of course they might let you cover your glass and wheels and everything before they spray the car if you ask. It really sucked that his trim and glass was sprayed but it really was a excellent finish on the car and the paint looked good but then again for that couple hundred dollar paint job he was out of about $1000 worth of parts.
AsU2A4fTaa	You need to go to a dealer, there is no way around it aside from breaking the window and I doubt that you want to do that.
AA10788612	Well, your dad has his reason even if they are misguided. He's not afraid of your ability to drive. I think he fears several other things that do not involve driving. He watches TV & sees an article about another person dies from a DUI accident. I think he fears loosing you. He doesn't want you to grow up & move on. But we all do. He did & you need to bring that to his attention. If you are a good person & do well in school, etc... You need to earn his trust & prove your capable of acting like a young adult. That means being responsible & accountable for your actions. Let him know you are aware that other folks are bad drivers. It's not your intention to be one of them. You don't do drugs, drink, & party at all hours of the day. You need to be your own man & move on.|`|wpgRMjgraa	No reasons and you should respect what you dad is saying see below and then you will see why he is concerned, cars are safer but younger drivers are not.<br>  <br>  NOVEMBER 2008<br>  <br>  Motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of death among 15- to 20-year olds. <br>  <br>  According to the U.S. Department of Transportation, 3,490 drivers in this age group died in motor vehicle crashes in 2006 and an additional 272,000 were injured. <br>  <br>  Drivers age 15- to 20-years old accounted for 12.9 percent of all the drivers involved in fatal crashes and 16 percent of all the drivers involved in police-reported crashes. <br>  <br>  Twenty-five percent of teen drivers killed were intoxicated. In 2006 (latest data available) crashes involving 15 to 17 year olds cost more than $34 billion nationwide, in medical costs, property damage and other costs, according to an AAA analysis.<br>  <br>  Among licensed drivers, young people between the ages of 15 and 20 have the highest rate of fatal crashes relative to other age groups, including the elderly. <br>  <br>  In fact, the risk of being involved in a fatal crash for teens is three times greater than for drivers age 65 to 69. <br>  <br>  Immaturity and lack of driving experience are the two main factors leading to the high crash rate among teens. |`|jFwuiRKxaa	 There are none. |`|lrMCiDnraa	Tell him you have to start sometime and one year is not going to make much difference. |`|DRnMOsKCaa	It depends.  Do you actually have any reason to drive?  Do you have to go to work or something? <br>  There are too many cars on the road.  Learning how to drive is something you'll have to do, though.  True, people in your age group have much higher rates of accidents, but that's just because you're still new at it and trying to learn.  Someone who is thirty who has never driven most likely has a higher chance of having an accident, too.  Not because of their age at all, but because they are new at driving.  <br>  <br>  Would he rather be the one to teach you and help you learn how to drive?  I live in a college town, and all the time I see foreigners who are quite a bit older than you are who have never learned to drive until now.  Those are the scariest driver's ed cars I've seen!  It has nothing to do with their age, just that they're new drivers (plus the language barriers).  I feel like it would be better to learn in a town you're comfortable with with a person you're comfortable with before you leave home (although oftentimes parents aren't the best teachers--mine weren't).  <br>  <br>  The roads aren't necessarily any safer today than they ever were.  True, modern cars are equipped with safety features that older cars weren't.  There are also a lot more cars on the road today.  I'm not sure how much that matters--the goal isn't to have a less severe accident, but rather to avoid one altogether.<br>  <br>  Ultimately, you know your dad the best.  Does he usually budge on big things like this?  Anyway, if you're seventeen now, that means you'll be eighteen soon.  When you're eighteen, there's not much he can do about it.  At that point, if you aren't enough of an adult to take it into your own hands, then maybe you shouldn't be behind the wheel anyway.  You WILL have to learn at some point.  Being safe and making good decisions is one thing, but it doesn't make sense to put something off like this.  I'm not sure what your dad's real reasons are, maybe he's just too lazy and doesn't want to worry about it.  <br>  <br>  Many people your age don't have much of a real reason to drive.  I drove to work, but most of my driving was just wasting time and gas.  I drove just to do it.  I got to get away from my parents and cause trouble.  I loved it.  I'm glad I didn't get myself killed, because there were a lot of times that I came pretty close.  <br>  <br>  Good luck, but you may be screwed on this one.
