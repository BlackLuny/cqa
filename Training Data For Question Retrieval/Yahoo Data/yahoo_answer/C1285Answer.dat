Presumably, the light was knocking electrons out of the metal, causing current to flow. However, it was also observed that while a dim blue light was enough to cause a current, even the strongest, brightest red light caused no current at all. According to wave theory, the strength or amplitude of a light wave was in proportion to its brightness: a bright light should have been easily strong enough to create a large current. Yet, oddly, this was not so.<br>  <br>  Einstein explained this conundrum by postulating that the electrons can receive energy from electromagnetic field only in discrete portions (quanta that were called photons): an amount of energy E that was related to the frequency, f of the light by<br>       E = h*f<br>  where h is Planck's constant (6.626 × 10-34 J seconds). Only photons of a high-enough frequency, (above a certain threshold value) could knock an electron free. For example, photons of blue light had sufficient energy to free an electron from the metal, but photons of red light did not. More intense light above the threshold frequency could release more electrons, but no amount of light below the threshold frequency could release an electron.<br>  <br>  Einstein was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921 for his theory of the photoelectric effect."<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave–particle_duality" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave–partic...</a><br>  <br>  cheers

uJpmd7G5aa	the big bang isn't real<br>  <br>  god.. baby...|`|rWB5rlXdaa	It is unknown where matter originated, and even if matter "originated". As the term "originated" refers to a period of time, and time is of course simply a human theory.<br>  <br>  Also, keep in mind that the Big Bang is just a model based on current evidence.<br>  <br>  Anyway, we're humans. We're not "meant" to think of the universe and the Big Bang. Our ability to do so is a "side-effect" of our social and cognitive evolution. Our ability to comprehend such things as the Big Bang is quite limited, and often seems to be of a paradoxical nature.<br>  <br>  Of course, now we have quantum mechanics which seems to be colliding with relativity and most of our findings about the universe. However, I know very very little of quantum mechanics, and I doubt that Yahoo Answers will do you much help. Get a basic background in physics, then pick up a book on it if you're really that dedicated/interested.|`|t8BGljYWaa	I mean, I kind of agree with the idea that a "Prime Observer" had to exist to set initial conditions for the wave function of the universe. <br>  <br>  But this conflicts with my understanding of psi, the wave function, itself.. the wave function doesn't express any profound or fundamental truth about reality, it's just a method we invented to keep track of probability amplitudes so we could guess the likelihood of various things happening. <br>  <br>  Furthermore, quantum theory (including the more modern QED and QCD) and general relativity are theories that attempt to explain the universe, and so far all of these theories have failed to paraphrase -- watch my weird metaphor -- the exact word and letter of the "real" laws of this universe.<br>  <br>  Basically, I don't think taking random insights from incomplete theories, thrusting them into a domain so extreme and crazy like the very early universe, and then pretending to make rational conclusions is valuable.<br>  <br>  I'd like to give my own answer now.<br>  <br>  We need to deal with what the concept of universe really means. There is no space outside the universe, so in thought experiments, you all need to stop standing outside and looking at the tennis-ball-sized universe. What space are you occupying?<br>  <br>  Furthermore, our concept of causality -- i.e. that all events must have a cause, and that each cause must have a cause -- is also very much bound to our notion of the linear progression of time. <br>  <br>  I would argue that we have no right to think of ourselves outside of the universe spatially, and no right to think of ourselves outside the universe temporally either. And if our notion of the linear progression of time doesn't hold at the Big Bang --quite simply, if the time of the big Bang is equal to 0 -- then there just ISN'T ANY TIME before the big bang.<br>  <br>  Causality comes from the way we think time works, but suddenly time doesn't work the way we think it works. And in this moment, before which there is no time, I think it's unfair to think about a cause.<br>  <br>  Nothing we can understand or think about made the big bang. The universe began in an instant, and had all these initial properties at its birth, but past that we are quite literally blinded by the nature of time itself.|`|TmlGhYL5aa	Law of Hubble, establishes the relation enters the distance the star and its speed of distance. It would seem that the distant celestial objects, move away of us and, to each other proportional to the distance. In agreement with the Dopper effect. <br>  It seems a little confused. <br>  Fact, is what happens.<br>   Law, is the relations of the facts, is not the explanations. <br>  Theory, is the explanation of the facts.<br>  <br>  Ex. When it leaves the Sun, the fact is that the Sun begins to raise in the horizon. The geocentric theory described the FACT saying that the Sun turned around the Earth. Theory explains the heliocentric it saying that it is an illusion, that what we see seems to us thus, but the reality is not it, but, which tour is the Earth. <br>  Thus the distant celestial bodies, move away apparently of us, but in opposition to which all think, it is not more than an illusion. <br>  In a black hole you reach the conclusion that the tridimension curved 90°, where nor the light can leave, because what was perpendicular (space time), now he is parallel (if a sense curved 90° is parallel to which he was perpendicular), if tenés as much geometric imagination as I, will understand because the time pauses. (To travel in parallel form, at speed “c”, time pauses, Theory of relativity) <br>  The light that comes from the black hole, comes to 300 000 km/s, that means that the tridimension travels at that speed, in the space time, that is the cause of which the time pauses. The speed of the light in the tridimension is slower than in the fourth dimension (space time), not because she is slower but it must cross more distance, curving itself by the gravity. If you are able to follow to me you will see that the tridimension is curved, giving that sensation of distance, the more far this the information the more was curved, until it is arrived at " similar black universe” to a black hole, but in all directions. The time pauses, speeds next to the one of the light, the light that leave loses its energy (microwaves), etc.|`|E1DOJj67aa	Q1: Nobody knows.<br>  <br>  There are some hypotheses, but of course no theories.<br>  <br>  (a theory is a hypothesis with a testable experiment - I doubt that one can test the origin of a Universe - certainly not on my budget)|`|1SB67BXyaa	It was when Chuck Norris and Mr. T first clashed.

They haven't really begun to explore what came before the Big Bang; there could have been an infinite number of Universes before this one and there will continue to be an infinite number of them.  Also, there may not have been a Big Bang in the sense that this Universe has always been and always will be and it has just changed form constantly by "renewing" it self or resetting it self or just changing in general (Plasma Cosmology).<br>  <br>  If you find it so difficult to find some logic in the Big Bang theory then you should find problems in the logic of God.  It makes more sense to me that everything always has been here and always will be here, just changing form.  30 Billion years from now, there may be a whole new group of planets and a star here born out of another Universe-wide event.  Or maybe black holes and and supernova/gamma-ray bursts are the key to the secret.  The garbage collectors and the recyclers of the Universe.<br>  <br>  The secret is getting over time.

SvmZlLdaaa	A liger is the offspring of a male lion and female tiger, whilst a tigon is the offspring of a male tiger and female lion. Ligers tend towards gigantism and are generally larger than either of their parents, whilst tigons are generally smaller or at least no larger than their parents. Ligers are usually lighter in colour - they are of similar colour to a lion, but have faint stripes. Tigons are usually darker in colour, more closely resembling the orangey colour of a tiger. Male ligers often have a small mane, rather like that of an adolescent male lion, whilst male tigons usually lack this. The faces of both are often a rather odd shape, like a combination of lion and tiger, but in general the liger's resembles a lion's more closely and a tigon's a tiger's.<br>  <br>  Like most hybrids, both ligers and tigons are usually sterile, but occasionally a female will be fertile and can be bred back to a male lion or tiger, producing:<br>  <br>  Lion + liger = li-liger<br>  Lion + tigon = li-tigon<br>  Tiger + liger = ti-liger<br>  Tiger + tigon = ti-tigon<br>  <br>  Since these crosses will be three-quarters lion or tiger, they tend to resemble either a lion or a tiger to a greater degree than a 50/50 cross does.<br>  <br>  Respectable zoos frown on the breeding of hybrids such as ligers and tigons, as they have no value from a conservation point of view and are taking up space and resources that could be used to breed endangered species. They are basically freaks bred by unscrupulous zoos in order to make money out of people willing to pay to see them. Today, there is very little chance of them occurring in the wild - tigers are found only in Asia, lions in Africa and the Gir Forest of India, where there are no tigers. Historically, the Asiatic subspecies of lion had a much greater range which overlapped with that of the tiger, so it is possible, though unlikely, that they may once have sometimes occurred in the wild.<br>  <br>  Liger:<br>  <a href="http://www.liger.org/images/liger-pic.jp..." rel="nofollow">http://www.liger.org/images/liger-pic.jp...</a><br>  <br>  Tigon:<br>  <a href="http://www.tiger-online.org/tigbib/bigca..." rel="nofollow">http://www.tiger-online.org/tigbib/bigca...</a>|`|u93oneUXaa	Appearance wise - i just typed in liger and looked at the images online  then tigon...they don't look that much different.

However, this must be done when the meteor is several hundreds (if not thousands) of miles away from the earth.
5H7Wgaknaa	I suppose the fact that the relative humidity is mentioned is supposed to make you think about water evaporating from your body, thus taking away your heat and making you feel cool.

Evaporation is a change of state from liquid to vapor at a constant temperature, or the latent heat of vaporization.

Recently we have discovered that something is making the Universe expanding at an accelerated rate - we call it "dark energie" <br>  That will most likely lead us to the Big Rip - which says that in the last minutes, stars and planets will be torn apart, and an instant before the end, atoms will be destroyed. <br>  You can imagine that.

Wn3LGHTvaa	Good question. It's a combination of heat and the rotation of the Earth. Hot air rises. (That may be one reason for lecture halls having the professor at the lowest point in the room.) As it rises, it cools and spreads out. By the time it has traveled 30° in latitude it has cooled enough to be heavier than the surrounding air and sinks. At that point, it spreads out over the surface  and travels another 30°. Then it rises again from the pressure. This gives you a torus (doughnut)-shaped pattern between the equator and 30°, 30° and 60°, and 60° and the pole. The easterly or westerly slant to the surface winds comes from the rotation of the Earth and the resulting Coriolis force.<br>  <br>  The old sailing ship captains knew all this and took advantage of the wind and water currents (both driven by heat) to make their trips as short (in time) as possible, even though the distance traveled might be greater.|`|AA11157530	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevailing_winds" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevailing_...</a><br>  <br>  Look at your map.

axKQq9nXaa	If you take the largest species/sub-species of tiger they are larger than lions.  The difference is more that lions are used to being in prides with other animals their size and they fight often to gain control.

Do not get me wrong, tigers do fight other tigers when their paths cross... it just does not happen too often.<br>  <br>  Overall I would say they are rather closely matched.  If you had two of similar size fight 100 times it would probably be a win either way 50% of the time.<br>  <br>  Not to mention that the "animal face off" is a rendition of a fight between the two based off of data entered into computer.  Not something you can really trust.<br>  <br>  As far as a tiger not living in the jungle... um, yes they do... unless that part was a joke.<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT for JASON: a single lion cannot take down a full grown elephant.  But there are prides of lions who have learned to hunt them as a full pride.  And yes, they do bring the elephant down.  The trick is that they hunt at night because elephants have poor night vision.|`|iDaTagHyaa	That question is almost too easy. Tigers are the biggest and most dangerous of the big cats. If you look on this website, you will find that a tiger could probably take down almost anything.|`|HEDSOHq1aa	yes, on average, tigers are bigger than lions<br>  these fights can go both way, like a street fight between 2 people.<br>  <br>  Animal face off is a crappy series that contains no science|`|RgbARcJTaa	That Clip Was So Fake <br>  And Why Do You Think The Lion Is Called The "king Of The Jungle"???|`|lTplgUGnaa	the Lion has a harder life than the tiger. How exactly do you expect a Lion to take down a full grown elephant? The Tiger is not that much bigger than the Lion. its like dogs you see some smaller dogs beat up slightly bigger dogs just because of one being more aggressive.<br>  <br>  King Of Beasts = Lion|`|plpIe32Aaa	The lion is the king of the jungle and is also bigger so i would believe a lion could beat a tiger|`|SvmZlLdaaa	A fight between a tiger and a lion could go either way. There are numerous records of fights between these species, since many people in the past have wanted the answer to this question and tried to settle it by cruelly pitting tigers and lions against each other. In some cases the tiger wins, in some cases the lion. The outcome of such a fight depends on the individuals involved - their age, size, sex, health, experience, temperament, etc. Tigers are generally larger and stronger, but size and strength are not the only determining factors - a large but timid tiger would be likely to lose to a small but aggressive lion, even though it was stronger. Lions usually have more fighting experience - they often clash with other prides, whereas tigers tend to avoid conflict whenever possible. Also, the lion's mane (provided it is a male, of course) would offer some degree of protection against a fatal throat-bite. It wouldn't make the killing bite impossible by any means, but it would certainly make it more difficult to achieve and hold.<br>  <br>  I would not take anything you saw on 'Animal Face-Off' as fact. That series was often biased and ill-informed, sometimes ignoring known facts in its supposedly 'scientific' analysis of the animals involved. It was a piece of sensationalism rather than a documentary, made to satisfy the desires of some people to pit large, ferocious animals against each other in a bloodless manner.<br>  <br>  I don't know why you say 'the tiger does not even live in the jungle'. Tigers certainly DO live in jungles. 'King of the jungle' is a bit of a misnomer for lions, though - most lions live on the open plains of Africa, though there is a small population in the Gir Forest of India. As for 'the lion is not a real king', no animal is a real king except for humans. No other species has a monarchy, and if you are using aggression and destructive ability as a measure of how deserving an animal is of the title of 'king', there is no question that humans are top of the list. We are capable of acts of cruelty and brutality seen nowhere else in nature, and can wipe out entire species, however large or strong or intelligent. We even have the ability to destroy the very planet that supports us.|`|sy3XG2ZNaa	Obviously the two answerers above know nothing about the jungle or zoology! The tiger is bigger than the lion and even though these two animals fought in ancient Rome They both live in different places! Lions actually live in the Savanna!

WzmwVlLnaa	I'm both a musician and an engineer so I'll take a crack at this. Basically the larger the resistance, the smaller the output current it will create. So if you create a sin wave with an amplitude of 1 by plucking on the string of  your bass then the 7 ohm pickup will create an input with a magnitude current of 1/7, whereas the 6.55 ohm pickup will create a input current with a magnitude of 1/6.55. I don't really know how that would change the sound of the bass except that the 6.55 ohm pickup might be more sensitive. As for the placement, I think that just depends more on your personal taste. I don't see any reason why your configuration wouldn't work. But that is a lot of pickups for a Bass.

Another (perhaps simpler) way to write this formula is: (n^2 - n)/2<br>  <br>  For example, if n = 5, then the number of handshakes is (5^2 - 5)/2 = (25 - 5)/2 = 20/2 = 10|`|Qjnex7wqaa	There is.  In this case, the order of the combinations is not important (that is person A shaking hands with person B is the same as person B shaking hands with person A), so you would use the number of Combinations nCr = n!/[(r!(n-r!)], where n is the total number of options (5 people) and r is the number being selected (2).<br>  <br>  So for this<br>  nCr = 5*4*3*2*1/[(2*1)(3*2*1) = 120/12 = 10<br>  <br>  If the ORDER is important, for example if for the same 5 people we want to know how many possible options there are of who comes first and second in a range, we use number of Permutations: nPr = n!/(n-r)!<br>  <br>  = (5*4*3*2*1)/(3*2*1)= 120/6 = 20|`|pOmjcVjZaa	I don't thinks there's a different equation for that.|`|timWxW8paa	its called 4 factorial, its represented as <br>  <br>  4!

Basically buoyancy is the ability of an object to displace enough water that the displaced water has a mass  equal to the object it is displacing.  As an example when you put a boat in the water it will “sink” into the water until the mass of the entire boat displaces an equal mass of water.<br>  <br>  In this case if you submerge the sphere in a known volume of water and measure how much water the sphere displaces you can calculate the mass of the water based upon the volume displaced.

Credit goes to MathMan for suggesting an interesting problem and making the conjecture that is now a theorem. Kindly notify me if any errors are found in the proof.)<br>  <br>  Theorem: Let a and b be coprime positive integers. The maximum integer n for which the linear diophantine equation ai + bj = n has no non-negative solutions is ab - a - b.<br>  <br>  Proof: We will first show that ai + bj = ab - a - b has no non-negative solutions. Then we will show that ai + bj = n has non-negative solutions for n > ab - a - b. We will also assume without loss of generality that a < b.<br>  <br>  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<br>  ai + bj = ab - a - b has no non-negative solutions:<br>  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<br>  <br>  Suppose to the contrary that solutions exist.<br>  <br>  Reduce the equation mod a to obtain:<br>  bj ≡ -b mod a<br>  => j ≡ -1 mod a (because (a,b) = 1)<br>  => j = sa - 1 for some integer s<br>  But j ≥ 0, so s ≥ 1/a > 0 i.e. s ≥ 1.<br>  <br>  Reduce the equation mod b to obtain:<br>  ai ≡ -a mod b<br>  => i ≡ -1 mod b (because (a,b) = 1)<br>  => i = tb - 1 for some integer t<br>  But i ≥ 0, so t ≥ 1/b > 0 i.e. t ≥ 1.<br>  <br>  Now substitute i and j back into the equation:<br>  <br>  a(tb-1) + b(sa-1) = ab - a - b<br>  => (s+t)ab - a - b = ab - a - b<br>  => s+t = 1<br>  But s, t ≥ 1 => s+t ≥ 2. (Contradiction)<br>  <br>  This contradiction proves that solutions do not exist for ai + bj = ab - a - b.<br>  <br>  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<br>  ai + bj = n has non-negative solutions for n > ab - a - b:<br>  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<br>  <br>  We will do this in two parts. First we will demonstrate this for n ≥ ab - a. Then we will demonstrate this for ab - a - b < n < ab - a.<br>  <br>  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<br>  ai + bj = n has non-negative solutions for n ≥ ab - a:<br>  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<br>  <br>  Firstly, since a and b are coprime, there exist integers x and y such that ax + by = 1. Taking mod b we have the congruence<br>  <br>  ax ≡ 1 mod b ----- (1)<br>  <br>  Similarly take mod b of the diophantine equation to obtain the congruence<br>  <br>  ai ≡ n mod b ----- (2)<br>  <br>  (1) implies that x is the multiplicative inverse mod b of a, so multiply (2) on both sides by x<br>  <br>  (ai)x ≡ nx mod b<br>  => (ax)i ≡ nx mod b<br>  => (1)i ≡ nx mod b<br>  => i ≡ nx mod b<br>  <br>  Now we can take nx and reduce it using the division algorithm to a principal residue mod b i.e. a remainder r that is between 0 and b-1 inclusive.<br>  <br>  Since the diophantine equation is to be solved in non-negative integers, this places restrictions on what values i can take. Clearly i is at least 0. The greatest value it can take is when j = 0 i.e. ai = n. So i is at most Floor[n/a]. Thus i must lie in the range [0, Floor[n/a]].<br>  <br>  But r can take on any value in [0,b-1], so how do we guarantee that making i = r will be ok i.e. r lies in range of i [0, Floor[n/a]]? We just have to make sure that n is sufficiently large so that b-1 ≤ Floor[n/a]. But since b-1 is an integer, this is the same as requiring that<br>  <br>  b-1 ≤ n/a<br>  => n ≥ ab - b<br>  <br>  So we have shown that ai + bj = n has non-negative solutions for n ≥ ab - a.<br>  <br>  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<br>  ai + bj = n has non-negative solutions for ab - a - b < n < ab - a:<br>  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<br>  <br>  It suffices to show that there are non-negative solutions to<br>  <br>  ai + bj = ab - a - b + (k+1)<br>  <br>  where k ranges from 0 to a-2<br>  <br>  But we can move the -a and -b over to the left-hand-side and rewrite this equation as<br>  <br>  a(i+1) + b(j+1) = ab + (k+1)<br>  <br>  So this is equivalent to asking whether there are positive integral solutions for the equation<br>  <br>  ai + bj = ab + (k+1)<br>  <br>  But ab + (k+1) ≥ ab - a so this equation has non-negative integral solutions by the previous part of this proof. If we can establish that there are no solutions involving i = 0 or j = 0 then we are done.<br>  <br>  If we set i = 0 in the equation and reduce it mod b, we get<br>  <br>  k+1 ≡ 0 mod b<br>  <br>  Since 0 ≤ k ≤ a-2, so 1 ≤ k+1 ≤ a-1 < b i.e. k+1 cannot be a multiple of b. So i cannot be 0.<br>  <br>  If we set j = 0 in the equation and reduce it mod a, we get<br>  <br>  k+1 ≡ 0 mod a<br>  <br>  But again 1 ≤ k+1 ≤ a-1 < b so k+1 cannot be a multiple of a. So j cannot be 0.<br>  <br>  So we have shown that ai + bj = n has non-negative solutions for ab - a - b < n < ab - a.<br>  <br>  So in summary we have shown that ai + bj = n cannot be solved in non-negative integers for n = ab - a - b. We have also shown that it can be solved in non-negative integers for n > ab - a. Therefore ab - a - b is the maximum integer for which ai + bj = n cannot be solved in non-negative integers.<br>  <br>  QED

5VKBBsA0aa	Well, it basically depends on the college. Almost all colleges have entering students take a math placement test. Depending on how well you do on this test, you may or may not start in a Calculus or Precalc class. <br>  <br>  At my school, the most common maths people first take are Math 090, Math 095, Math 102, Math 115, and Math 240. 090 and 095 are for people that just don't get math. It is really easy and basically identical to HS math. 102 isn't really hard either and is for the "average" people. 115 is precalc and is tougher than algebra and people that test into that are likely pretty good in math, but not necessarily brilliant. Finally, 240 is Calc which a very small amount of people test into.<br>  <br>  If you are curious, I tested into Math 102 and found it quite easy. I am actually going for a math minor now and have taken many math classes and have yet to really have trouble.|`|T4Eu6zL1aa	in college you will learn in a week what most high school classes learn in a month.

If you choose one particle and imagine the force vectors from the other two particles, you can see that they form 30 degree angles.<br>  <br>  This means that the component of the forces exerted by q2 and q3 will be cos(30) each, where 30 is in degrees. Remember that there are two charges, so multiply it by 2.<br>  <br>  2*cos(150) = 2*sqrt(2)/2 = sqrt(2)<br>  <br>  If we pull back Coulomb's law from above, we see that we can multiply it by sqrt(2) in order to find the total force exerted on one of the charges.<br>  <br>  F = sqrt(2)*k*q^2/r^2<br>  <br>  (If you didn't multiply by sqrt(2), you would get the total force acting on the particle. Because the forces aren't in exactly the same direction, however, part of each force cancels out.)<br>  <br>  Plugging in numbers, we get 68.35 N. The direction of the force will be (180-30) = 150 degrees away from the other two charges, which is directly away from them.<br>  <br>  The same math applies to the other charges. Since they're all symmetric, you'll get the same magnitude, just different directions.

X0e6p9Ilaa	As I have said many times on this forum there are no completely ionic bonds. All bonds are covalent. It's just that some are very, very polar. It's not an "either-or" situation. All bonds lie along a continuum, with characteristics of both kinds of bonds.<br>  <br>  * You can compute the percent ionic character from the following expression.<br>  percent ionic character = 100(1 - e^(-DEN^2/4))<br>  ... where DEN is the electronegativity difference and e is the base of the natural logarithms.<br>  <br>  Some additional comments from past questions:<br>  <br>  All elements except a few of the inert gases (He, Ne, Ar) form bonds depending on what the other element is. All bonding is the same thing: the electrons interact so that the resulting compound will be at a lower energy than were the original atoms. Ionic and covalent are simply words that describe parts of a continuum. When electrons are equally shared between to atoms, the bond is 100% covalent. With increasing difference in electronegativity the covalent bond becomes increasingly polar. There is an arbitrary point on the continuum where we say that the polar covalent bond is "ionic". But even the most "ionic" bonds have some covalent character. Therefore, the electrons are not really "transferred" from one atom to another, they simply are closer to one atom than the other. The "transfer", which forms ions, only occurs when the bond is "broken" and the electrons in the bond go with the more electronegative element. Nonmetals when bonded to other nonmetals tend to form bond which are more covalent, with lower electronegativity differences, and some metal-nonmetal componds tend to be more polar, with greater electronegativity differences. The bonds between the alkali metals and halogens are so polar that they are sometimes referred to as "ionic", as are the bonds between the metals in groups IA and IIA and oxygen.<br>  ======================================...<br>  <br>  All bonds are covalent. Let that sink in. All bonds are covalent. It's just that some bonds are really polar. So polar, in fact, that they behave as if they were 100 percent ionic. But there are no 100 percent ionic bonds. Even the most "ionic" of bonds (Cs-F) is 8 percent covalent. A Na-Cl bond is about 29 percent covalent.<br>  <br>  All bonds lie along a continuum, from 100 percent covalent to about 92 percent ionic. The vast majority of bonds like closer to the middle of the range and have both ionic and covalent character.<br>  <br>  The amount of ionic character to the covalent bonds is determined from the electronegativity difference and this equation which was introduced by Linus Pauling, the originator of the concept of electronegativity.<br>  <br>  Percent ionic char. = 100(1 - e^-(DEN^2/4))<br>  <br>  The electronegativity difference for NaCl is 2.23, or 71 percent ionic<br>  The electronegativity difference for KI is 1.84, or 57 percent ionic|`|Mb0pFBwMaa	polar substance - a substance where the negatively charged part of the molecule has a higher electronegativity than any other atoms in the substance, resulting in an imbalance of electrons.<br>  <br>  ionic substance - a substance that has atoms that have either more or less electrons than protons, resulting in an electric charge.

This is an equation of 2 variables, but not linear since its not "some constant times some variables".<br>  <br>  So to answer your question:<br>  No. A linear equation may have n unkowns.<br>  And not all equations in 2 variables are linear.

The base is very large and broad while the top is smaller but pointed. My analogy is simply that in the beginning you have to learn a lot of stuff to build a strong base. Although what you learn may not seem all that worthwhile, that base is what supports the rest of the pyramid. So, later on when you are learning those more interesting and specific things at the top of the pyramid you'll need all those basic skills.<br>  <br>  The line of symmetry is pretty important. It is certainly used a lot when it pertains to graphs such as parabolas. It is somewhat a very cool shortcut that if you know what one side looks like you automatically know what the other side looks like!

O85rdzNvaa	Resonance is generally noticeable when you have a region of high electron density - it is the movement of these electrons around the molecule that essentially is "resonance."<br>  <br>  You can see that ethane has no regions of high e- density; it's a uniform molecule.<br>  <br>  Ethanol has a partial negative charge on the oxygen, but nothing to speak of for resonance. Oxygen is important for resonance when you have carbonyl groups (an oxygen double-bonded to carbon). The high electron density of the double-bond can be moved onto the oxygen, creating a resonance form. The alcohol would be more useful re. resonance as an enol - when you have the alcohol bonded to a double-bonded carbon. You can then lose the hydrogen and have electrons shifting from the double bond to the oxygen, allowing for tautomerism.<br>  <br>  You can see that I'm building up to ethene here. The alkene has a double-bond - a region of high electron density. Now, granted, if your professor has you drawing resonance for ethene, he's something of a moron. You *can* shift the double-bond electrons to one of the carbons, creating a resonance form, but a negatively charged carbon bonded to a positively charged carbon... well, to call it a "low ranking" resonance form is putting it mildly. It's just flat-out negligible. Of your three choices, however, "negligible" is better than "zero."

Calculate the equilibrium constant Kc for the reaction.<br>  <br>  ***Kc = [Br]^2/[Br2]<br>  Because 1.20 percent dissociates, we are left with 98.80 percent of the original, or 1.05 moles * 0.988 = 1.0374 moles.  In 0.980 liters, that makes [Br2] = 1.06 M<br>  Since one mole of Br2 dissociates to 2 moles of Br, moles Br = 2*(1.05 – 1.0374) = 0.0252 moles.  In 0.98 liters, that makes [Br] = 0.0257 M<br>  <br>  Thus Kc = [Br]^2/[Br2] = (0.0257^2)/(1.06) = 6.23 x 10^-4<br>  <br>  Hope that helped!

ihYPLJByaa	Finding the antiderivative of a function ?(x) means finding another function F(x) (more exactly a set of functions differing from one another by an arbitrary constant) such that its derivative is the same as the given function ?(x), that is, in symbols:<br>  <br>  F'(x) = ?(x)<br>  <br>  in your case. being f(t) = 6sec2t - 4t2, you have:<br>  <br>  F(t) = ∫ (6sec2t - 4t2) dt = <br>  <br>  break it into separate integrals and pull constants out:<br>  <br>  6 ∫ sec2t dt - 4 ∫ t2 dt = <br>  <br>  6 tan t - 4 [1/(2+1)] t^(2+1) + C =<br>  <br>  6 tan t - (4/3) t3 + C that is the general antiderivative <br>  <br>  as you can see, the antiderivatives differ from one another by C, this means that, depending on C value, they are countless;<br>  among them, the problem requires you to find the one (here improperly called F(t), but better denoted as F(τ)) whose value is 0 for x = 0 (that is passing through the origin); thus:<br>  <br>  F(0) = 6 tan (0) - (4/3) (0)3 + C = 0 → C = 0<br>  <br>  thus, plugging C = 0 in the above expression, you get:<br>  <br>  F(τ) = 6tan t - (4/3) t3 + 0 = 6 tan t - (4/3) t3 <br>  <br>  (note that F(τ) is no longer a set of functions, it's A function)<br>  <br>  finally, you have to find the value of F(τ) at t = 3, so plug in 3, yielding:<br>  <br>  F(3) = 6tan (3) - (4/3) (3)3 = 6 tan(3) - 4(32) = 6 tan(3) - 36 ≈ - 36.85527<br>  <br>  <br>  I hope this helps..

As you probably know, amino acids are coded for by codons, or sets of three nucleotides. Synonymous mutations can occur in which one of the nucleotides in a codon changes, but it codes for the same amino acid. This would not result in a change in the sequence of amino acids.<br>  <br>  If you look at a codon table (you can find one on wikipedia), you will see that there are multiple codons that point to a single amino acid. <br>  <br>  Hope that helps!

zFsTSrOcaa	Strictly speaking, the Kepler instrument isn't a telescope at all; it's a photometer.  It doesn't take images in the usual sense, and we will never see a "Kepler showcase" of spectacular extrasolar planets.  Kepler's function is to monitor the brightness of selected stars for any changes.  A planet transiting the star will block some of the star's light, and Kepler is sensitive enough to detect the transit of an Earth-sized planet.  To further increase sensitivity, the star is deliberately blurred to spread its light over a larger number of pixels, allowing more photons to be sampled before the pixels become saturated.  Magnification is not a factor, since light-gathering ability is solely a function of the aperture (0.95 meters/37.4 inches for Kepler, 2.4 meters/94.5 inches for Hubble).|`|2181567251632c4e5445096bb9761f26aa	Lots of data here to help:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://hubble.nasa.gov/" rel="nofollow">http://hubble.nasa.gov/</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.kepler.arc.nasa.gov/" rel="nofollow">http://www.kepler.arc.nasa.gov/</a>

Earthquakes in extensional environments tend to be smaller than magnitude 8.<br>  <br>  Transform Boundaries - earthquakes are shallow, running as deep as 25 km; mechanisms indicate strike-slip motion.  Transforms tend to have earthquakes smaller than magnitude 8.5.<br>  The San Andreas fault in California is a notable example of a transform, separating the Pacific from the North American plate. At transforms the plates mostly slide past each other laterally, producing less sinking or lifing of the ground than extensional or compressional environments. <br>  <br>  Convergent Boundaries - at compressional (convergent) boundaries, earthquakes are found in several settings ranging from the very near surface to several hundred kilometers depth, since the coldness of the subducting plate permits brittle failure down to as much as 700 km. Compressional boundaries host Earth's largest quakes, with some events on subduction zones in Alaska and Chile having exceeded magnitude 9.|`|AA12139405	The next bigger one is expected at California & near Himachal in India.

QCTdN4HBaa	The basic idea is this:<br>  f is already defined on the rationals.  So, let x be a point in R, not rational.  Let's come up with a value for f(x).  There exists a sequence (q_n) of rational numbers which converge to x.  Furthermore, the sequence (q_n) is a Cauchy sequence, since any convergent sequence in R is Cauchy.  <br>  <br>  We know f is uniformly continuous on Q.  Hence, (f(q_n)) is a Cauchy sequence too.  Why?  Because uniform continuity tells us that given an e > 0, there exists a d > 0 such that whenever |x-y| < d,  |f(x) - f(y)| < e.  Since (q_n) is a Cauchy sequence, there exists an N for which |q_n - q_m| < d whenever n and m are bigger than N.  That means that |f(q_n) - f(q_n)| < e, proving that (f(q_n)) is a Cauchy sequence.<br>  <br>  Hence (f(q_n)) converges in R to a limit.  Call this limit y.  Define f(x) to be y.<br>  <br>  All we need to do now is to prove that f is continuous at x.  Let (x_n) be any sequence of rational approaching x.  (f(x_n)) must approach y.  That proves continuity at x.<br>  <br>   [In the 3rd paragraph, I forgot to mention that you need to check that f is well-defined.  So, if we used a different sequence of rationals (p_n) to approach x, would f((p_n)) converge to the same thing is (f(q_n))?  Check that the answer is yes.]

The Trapezium Cluster is about a million years. There is only one O-star - Theta Orionis C. While the rest of the cluster members are B-stars. However, if you count all the stars 50 light-years of the cluster, there would still be more less massive stars. For argument's sake since it is limited to those choices, I am choosing letter A.

Out of every 1000 stars, we find 1 B, 7 A, 27 F, 65 G, 125 K, 775 red dwarfs. However, that distribution is for stars of random age, which greatly increases the proportion of red dwarfs because of their very long lives.<br>  <br>  Most stars form in stellar associations, of which there are three recognized kinds: OB, R, and T. OB stellar associations produce mostly hot, bright stars with masses greater than 10 suns. R stellar associations produce a lot of intermediate sized stars, between 3 and 10 solar masses. And T stellar associations produce mostly stars having mass less than 3 suns, which when young are called "T Tauri" stars.<br>  <br>  What determines which kind of stellar association will form from an interstellar molecular cloud is probably the density of the cloud and the abruptness with which is begins to collapse into protostars.<br>  <br>  Some stars of atypical mass will form in each kind of association, of course.|`|QBrAyl79aa	The answer is A.

Since 1 atm is the pressure at sea level here on Earth, the pressure in the core of Jupiter is about ten million times the pressure here on Earth. So 'D' is the correct answer.

ffJcrsmLaa	Notice that e^0 - 1 = 0, and sin(5*0) = 0. When the numerator and denominator are both 0, you have to use l'Hopital's Rule. Take the derivative of the numerator and the derivative of the denominator, then find the limit as x approaches 0. Derivative of e^x - 1 is e^x, and derivative of sin(5x) = 5cos(5x). So we have:<br>  lim x--->0 (e^x)/(5cos(5x))<br>  Plugging in 0 for x, we have:<br>  (e^0)/(5cos5*0)<br>  1/(5cos(0))<br>  1/(5*1)<br>  So the final answer is 1/5.

All of the fantastic space telescope and spy telescopes on satellites are within about 50 miles of the surface of the Earth. <br>  <br>  Home telescopes might be okay to look at the surface of the Moon from Earth, but you will not be able to see anything smaller than enormous mountains and great valleys with one. Objects become apparently smaller the farther you get away from them. This is easy to demonstrate and comprehend over flat land such as a sandy beach, or a dry lake bed. At some point, normal objects just dissappear into tiny dots, then you even loose sight of their mounts and holding apparatus. This will occur for normal size objects carried by a human being at easily measured distances of 1/4, 1/2, and 1 mile. <br>  <br>  To place your idea into perspective...The circumference of the Earth is about 25,000 Miles. Ten times that distance is 250,000 Miles...roughly equivalent to the distance to the surface of the Moon.

Small things really. Odd, but still easy to doubt though.<br>  <br>  Only things I know for sure were things that were experienced by multiple family members individually.<br>  <br>  A well beloved former-stray cat we'd had to have put down young because of cancer. Within the first number of months of the loss of him, there was more than one occasion that I swore I heard his meow at the food cupboard/closet/pantry, after I'd opened the door to it. It happened two, maybe three times.<br>  <br>  For a while I never mentioned it. A while later when I did, at the dinner table...oddly enough I found my mother and sister looking at me astonished, agreeing that they'd heard the same. Same location. Later found that my father, who'd left the table already, also had heard it.<br>  <br>  And for quite a while my mother kept hearing what she thought sounded like a spring bumper on the inside a bedroom door the cat used to stick his foot under and mess with, bending it and letting go, making it make that weird spring noise. Nearly every time it was only her that heard it, until I did just the one single time. Didn't see it, but was close enough to that door to know it did come from there. And I was the only one home, having just gotten home from (college) classes that day. It was my younger sister's room and she was still as school, and no other pets at the time.<br>  <br>  That was years ago though, in the later half of 1997, early 1998. However our dog just died, likewise too young, less than a week ago. So we'll see what happens...|`|EQvwEwTNaa	I woke up once seeing this pattern.

My hair would never have been combed to look like his though.  There was a tramindous amount of detail in this figure I just don't remember most of it.  It lasted about 10 seconds, he faded into nothing.<br>  <br>  That is all I can remember right now.  I did use a quija board when I was all alone in my house once.  I heard a crash in my basement afterwords.  That didn't scare me so much since I was already scared in even having the idea in the first place.|`|XzYUeXhWaa	Yes I have had several in my lifetime, or should I say that I think I have had several?<br>  <br>  My mother has had some and other friends and family.<br>  <br>  One that comes to mind is we used to live in a place in CA, of course I was about 7 or 8 at the time so I can't pin point exactly where we were, but we lived behind a furniture store.<br>  <br>  We lived in the middle house down the driveway, our front yard neighbor was Wilma, very nice older lady.

5gG42iOpaa	No, most pictures used as the milky way are actually just pictures of other galaxies (such as Andromeda) that we just figure are similar enough to ours.<br>  <br>  We can take a side ways photo of our own galaxy, but not a front view.<br>  -------------<br>  The furthest we have been able to send "telescopes" is to the edge of our Solar System.  We couldn't ever send one completely outside of the galaxy.  And even if we did, that would be so far away that we would not receive the pictures for a millennium or two.|`|KHSOVxViaa	I'm not sure what pictures you mean, but if they're from a viewpoint outside the Milky Way, then they're not real photos.  Maybe an artist's impression, or the CGI equivalent.<br>  <br>  The Milky Way is a large spiral disc, containing millions of stars and nebulae.  However, it's mostly fairly empty space as the gaps between the stars is huge.  From our viewpoint inside the galaxy, we can easily look outside it, and also along the disc.<br>  <br>  The part of the night sky where the stars are thicker is the Milky Way - that's just the direction of the disc from our inside viewpoint.  We can certainly see a lot more stars and nebulae there compared to looking up or down from the disc.  Very many of the impressive photographs of nebulae are taken looking along this disc.<br>  <br>  It's whatever is in this disc that we can photograph, from the inside.  If you're looking at a photo of a spiral galaxy, then it's not ours.|`|17d2136cb28b3dcd96bfa98507022f5eaa	What pictures of the Milky Way are you referring to? There are pictures of the Milky Way from the vantage point of Earth taken with regular cameras, and there are artist's concepts of the Milky Way seen from outside. There are no photographic images of the Milky Way seen from outside.<br>  <br>  First of all, we can see quite a bit of the Milky Way from our location inside it. We can also tell a lot about the structure of the spiral arms from radio astronomy studies of neutral hydrogen. Thirdly, we know what many other galaxies look like from the outside. These three sources of information are combined to produce an artist's rendering of what the Milky Way looks like. Some details are real, some are inferred.<br>  <br>  [Edit] I'm surprised that no other answer has mentioned the radio astronomy data, as that is the single most important source of information about the spiral arms of the Milky Way. This was acquired back in the late 1950s with the very first radio telescopes; in fact the very first talk I ever gave on astronomy, 50 years ago, was on this research!|`|H8aN0SIwaa	We do indeed have pictures of our own Milky Way galaxy. I have one of them. They were shot by photographing the universe from opposing angles as the earth rotates on it's axis, and also from space cameras like the Hubble telescope which rotates around the earth, and is able to view our galaxy from its rotating proximity to earth. When the earth, or Hubble, is facing the outer rim of the galaxy(looking outward from our galaxy toward deep space)-- our infra red cameras can detect exactly how far out the arms go...and when the earth, or Hubble, is rotated toward the center of the galaxy, more infra red photos are taken which can detect the spans of distance in the opposing direction........these two photos are then superimposed upon one another, and put together to form the full spans of our galaxy from the SIDE VIEW, and I will say that it is a very magnificent image. We can all picture a galaxy from above as we can see the outer galaxies such as Andromeda, our nearest galactic neighbor. The view we have of our own Milky Way is a "full side image." From this picture, scientists have clearly ascertained that our galaxy has spiral arms like Andromeda...and that our earth is located in one of those arms about 3/4 of the way out from the center of the Milky Way. I suggest you google "Milky Way" and click for an image search, and you will find it. Great question by the way!|`|RCdyywTJaa	It's more like trying to take a picture of the inside of your house while you are inside it, and while your house is cluttered with a bunch of junk to boot! <br>  <br>  Because we are inside the Milky Way, we don't get to take any pictures of it from an angle "above" the galaxy - for example, like this beautiful picture of M31, the Andromeda Galaxy. (However, we can make an educated guess as to what the Milky Way might look like from such an angle - for example, see this artist's illustration.) <br>  <br>  Instead, we only get pictures in which we see the structure of the Milky Way edge-on, from inside of it. Examples of these pictures in many different wavelengths of light can be found here. Each picture is a panoramic photo - if you want an idea of what we really see, imagine taking each picture and wrapping it in a big circle around you. The photographer has simply chosen to "cut" and "unfold" this circle such that the Galactic Center (the brightest part of the Milky Way) is in the picture's center. This might give the illusion that we are looking at an edge-on picture of the Milky Way from the outside, but in reality we are not - the left and right edges of this picture simply represent material in the Milky Way that is located in the opposite direction of the Galactic Center from our point of view, and since we ourselves are pretty close to the edge of the Milky Way, there isn't much to see in this direction. <br>  <br>  no the dont have it...!!!!!!|`|H9OFtkeoaa	The milky way is the area of highest star concentration as you look up. It appears as a bright band across the sky.  Our galaxy is basically a flat disk and it doesn't matter if you are looking towards the center of the disk or away from the center there will always be a bright band along the plane of the disk.|`|QPPcUyyyaa	Um, no.<br>  <br>  We don't have any pictures of the milky way for the exact reason you just described.  We've never even sent a satellite outside of our own solar system.  The distances to the next star, much less to make it outside the galaxy, are astronomical.<br>  <br>  We have a lot of photos of OTHER galaxies.  But none of our own.<br>  <br>  However, we have charted where most of the stars in our galaxy are, and we now know that we live in what's called a bar-spiral galaxy.  It's not a perfect spiral; it has two main arms.|`|AA10576963	nope... i didnt think we had pics of the milky way.. just ones that looked like it... although.. i suppose it is feesable that they bounced an image of some distant object... our farthest telescope is HUbble, in orbit around the earth, and the farthest man made probe is Galileo... which is like.. just past pluto or something|`|3TwhCBQwaa	It is the view of what we can see from Earth. You can see some of it and a night with a new moon.  In the country with no light pollution.|`|Nf60Q6UFaa	Our pictures of the Milky Way are from inside it.  We have no actual images of this galaxy from outside it.  Some progress has been made in mapping it out lately, so we have an idea of what it would look like from outside it.  Which by the way is a barred spiral with two major arms and two minor arms.  See links, notice the terms used to describe the images as "a drawing of" or "artist's conception", not actual photos.  There are of course galaxies which we have photos of which are similar in structure, as in the bottom of the page in the second link.|`|PwHQSAxvaa	The name "Milky Way" refers to a band of light the Galaxy emits, visible from the earth at night.<br>  <br>  A picture of the whole Galaxy is possible by observing the relative paths of near stars, and the earth's position relative to them.|`|DRVSCxKpaa	Those neat, spiral pictures of the milky way are obviously artists' impressions; because they show the milky way from a perspective well outside the galaxy.  But by carefully plotting the positions of the stars; gas clouds, nebulae etc we CAN see, a picture of the milky way was gradually built up, on which the artists' impressions were based.<br>  <br>  As another answerer said, its a bit like trying to figure out your house from inside it:  But if yo carefully plotted the rooms, and the positions of everything in the house; you could eventually draw up a plan of the house; without ever having gone outside.|`|VPhYOWxwaa	The only pictures of our galaxy we have are from the Earth's perspective or at least our solar system's perspective if you want to get technical because Hubble and other satellites aren't actually ON Earth. These photos just look like a strip of stars if we look towards the galactic center. One a clear night, without any lights around you can see it with the naked eye as a "cloudy" band of stars going across the sky which is just because in the direction of the center of the galaxy, the stars are closer together so they are denser and that's why you can see it.<br>  <br>  The pictures I assume you are referring to are actually artist's illustrations of what the Milky Way looks like or pictures of similar galaxies elsewhere in the universe.<br>  <br>  I'm actually surprised that this is not obvious to so many people.|`|c8b96c428b5adcbe941b94e428a6e7afaa	One night when you are traveling - in the middle of nowhere<br>  and there is a New Moon or moonset has occurred<br>  <br>  look to Orion in the Northern Hemisphere<br>  imagine parallel lines from the sides that run further north<br>  <br>  as you go northward to the horizon - - -that is the Milky Way<br>  in between those lines<br>  <br>  ( the Almond Joy is still at the store) LOL<br>  <br>  all the best|`|77cb033374598e8c10938763c9fe03f7aa	It's like taking a picture of yourself with a cell phone you don't see the hand holding the phone.
AA10734281	boy what a though question ! <br>  <br>  let me explain. when you rapidly cool a steel from high temperatures(depending on steel type) with water or oil or other means , it is called quenching. <br>  <br>  it depends on the steel type to say if it is better to quench it with oil or water but basically in water you will have a harder steel rather than oil. <br>  for some steels if you do this you will ruin it's properties ! <br>  <br>  you can't totally tell what kind of steel do you have until you get it analyzed with Quantometer analyzer with a pocket knife it is more like an estimation and it can't be trust able generally if you can scratch the steel with your knife it means it is not a hard steel and it might not be expensive. <br>  <br>  I hope that helps but for more information i need to know more !

ZDiPfkEfaa	Meiosis I<br>  <br>  In meiosis I, the homologous pairs in a diploid cell separate, producing two haploid cells (23 chromosomes, N in humans), so meiosis I is referred to as a reductional division. A regular diploid human cell contains 46 chromosomes and is considered 2N because it contains 23 pairs of homologous chromosomes. However, after meiosis I, although the cell contains 46 chromosomes it is only considered N because later in anaphase I the sister chromatids will remain together as the spindle pulls the pair toward the pole of the new cell. In meiosis II, an equational division similar to mitosis will occur whereby the sister chromatids are finally split, creating a total of 4 haploid cells (23 chromosomes, N) per daughter cell from the first division.<br>  <br>  Prophase I<br>  <br>  Homologous chromosomes pair (or synapse) and crossing over (or recombination) occurs - a step unique to meiosis. The paired and replicated chromosomes are called bivalents or tetrads, which have two chromosomes and four chromatids, with one chromosome coming from each parent. At this stage, non-sister chromatids may cross-over at points called chiasmata. Two centrosomes, containing a pair of centrioles in animal cells, migrate to the two poles of the cell. These centrosomes, which were duplicated during S-phase, function as microtubule organizing centers nucleating microtubules, which are essentially cellular ropes and poles. The microtubules invade the nuclear region after the nuclear envelope disintegrates, attaching to the chromosomes at the kinetochore. The kinetochore functions as a motor, pulling the chromosome along the attached microtubule toward the originating centriole, like a train on a track. There are four kinetochores on each tetrad, but the pair of kinetochores on each sister chromatid fuses and functions as a unit during meiosis I. Microtubules that attach to the kinetochores are known as kinetochore microtubules. Other microtubules will interact with microtubules from the opposite centriole: these are called nonkinetochore microtubules or polar microtubules. A third type of microtubules, the aster microtubules, radiates from the centrosome into the cytoplasm or contacts components of the membrane skeleton.<br>  <br>  Metaphase I<br>  <br>  Homologous pairs move together along the metaphase plate: As kinetochore microtubules from both centrioles attach to their respective kinetochores, the homologous chromosomes align along an equatorial plane that bisects the spindle, due to continuous counterbalancing forces exerted on the bivalents by the microtubules emanating from the two kinetochores of homologous chromosomes. The physical basis of the independent assortment of chromosomes is the random orientation of each bivalent along the metaphase plate, with respect to the orientation of the other bivalents along the same equatorial line.<br>  <br>  Anaphase I<br>  <br>  Kinetochore microtubules shorten, severing the recombination nodules and pulling homologous chromosomes apart. Since each chromosome has only one functional unit of a pair of kinetochores, whole chromosomes are pulled toward opposing poles, forming two haploid sets. Each chromosome still contains a pair of sister chromatids. Nonkinetochore microtubules lengthen, pushing the centrioles farther apart. The cell elongates in preparation for division down the center.<br>  <br>  Telophase I<br>  <br>  The last meiotic division effectively ends when the chromosomes arrive at the poles. Each daughter cell now has half the number of chromosomes but each chromosome consists of a pair of chromatids. The microtubules that make up the spindle network disappear, and a new nuclear membrane surrounds each haploid set. The chromosomes uncoil back into chromatin. Cytokinesis, the pinching of the cell membrane in animal cells or the formation of the cell wall in plant cells, occurs, completing the creation of two daughter cells. Sister chromatids remain attached during telophase I.<br>  <br>  Cells may enter a period of rest known as interkinesis or interphase II. No DNA replication occurs during this stage.<br>  <br>  Meiosis II<br>  <br>  Meiosis II is the second part of the meiotic process. Much of the process is similar to mitosis. The end result is production of four haploid cells (23 chromosomes, 1N in humans) from the two haploid cells (23 chromosomes, 1N * each of the chromosomes consisting of two sister chromatids) produced in meiosis I. The four main steps of Meiosis II are: Prophase II, Metaphase II, Anaphase II, and Telophase II.<br>  <br>  Prophase II takes an inversely proportional time compared to telophase I. In this prophase we see the disappearance of the nucleoli and the nuclear envelope again as well as the shortening and thickening of the chromatids. Centrioles move to the polar regions and arrange spindle fibers for the second meiotic division.<br>  <br>  In metaphase II, the centromeres contain two kinetochores that attach to spindle fibers from the centrosomes (centrioles) at each pole. The new equatorial metaphase plate is rotated by 90 degrees w

The same for P(Sun).<br>  <br>  Then what you are interested in is called: P(Sat or Sun).<br>  <br>  There are two other quantities that are helpful:<br>  <br>  P(Sat and Sun)<br>  <br>  That is the probability it rains both days. We know:<br>  <br>  P(Sat and Sun) ≥ P(Sat)P(Sun)<br>  <br>  If the event that it rains Sat. is unrelated to the Sun even, then we can replace the ≥ sign with an = sign. But it is MOST SURELY not. Rain from day-to-day is correlated. However, this does tell us:<br>  <br>  P(Sat and Sun) ≥ P(Sat)P(Sun) = (50%)(50%) = (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4<br>  <br>  So there is at least at 25% chance of rain on BOTH days.<br>  <br>  But you can do better:<br>  <br>  P(Sat or Sun) ≥ P(Sat)<br>  P(Sat or Sun) ≥ P(Sun)<br>  <br>  Why is that true? Because if it rains Sat then it definitely rained on the weekend (Sat or Sun). Same for the second equation. Based on this, we can say:<br>  <br>  P(Sat or Sun) ≥ 50%<br>  <br>  However, that's all we can compute. Why? Because we don't know the relationship between rain on each day. For all we know, there is a perfect correlation (it rains Saturday if it rains Sunday, and only if it rains Sunday). In that case, you would have:<br>  <br>  P(Sat or Sun) = P(Sun) = 50%<br>  <br>  On the other hand, let's say we lived on some crazy Planet X in another galaxy. There, it rains on every other day. Then if it doesn't rain on Sat, it will on Sun. In that case:<br>  <br>  P(Sat or Sun) = 100%<br>  <br>  In that crazy case, it IS true that it is 100%. However, that's not a very believable situation is it? We probably don't have a weather system that follows such silly rules.<br>  <br>  If you said "yes it must be 100%" and are concerned that you can't tell when your logic is incorrect. Try thinking of it for a three-day weekend! Let's see... 50% chance of rain Friday, 50% Saturday, 50% Sunday. If that logic works, then there is a 150% chance of rain on my three-day weekend. Oh wait, how can that be?? 150% cannot be a valid probability. So that logic must be flawed.<br>  <br>  So what can we say, after all? We've talked alot about why P(Sat or Sun)≥50%. We've already seen a case where P(Sat or Sun)=50% or where it is 100%. But perhaps we can make a different assumption about rain and get a different answer?<br>  <br>  Here's how to do it:<br>  <br>  P(Sat or Sun) = 1 - P(not Sat and not Sun)<br>  <br>  In other words, the "opposite" event is that it rains neither day. Now if we assume (and this would be an assumption not accurate to real life) that Saturday's rain and Sunday's rain are unrelated to each other, we can say:<br>  <br>  P(not Sat and not Sun) = P(not Sat)P(not Sun) = (100%-50%)(100%-50%)<br>  <br>  Converting that to fractions gives:<br>  <br>  P(not Sat and not Sun) = (1 - 1/2)(1 - 1/2) = (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4<br>  <br>  However, this tells us:<br>  <br>  P(Sat or Sun) = 1 - P(not Sat and not Sun) = 1 - 1/4 = 3/4 = 75%<br>  <br>  But that is only true if the rain is independent. In the end, it all comes down to the unknown factor: how does the rain on Saturday influence the rain on Sunday? Depending on whether that's true, you could have:<br>  <br>  100% positive correlation → P(Sat or Sun) = 50%<br>  no correlation whatsoever → P(Sat or Sun) = 75%<br>  100% negative correlation → P(Sat or Sun) = 100%<br>  <br>  Based on what we know from real life experience, the correlation is somewhere between "no correlation" and "100% positive" correlation. Real life evidence should lead us to believe that the probability is actually between 50% and 75% (I would guess something like 60%).<br>  <br>  I hope this actually helps!<br>  <br>  Note: Most of the other answers are partially or entirely nonsense. They attempt to make crazy assumptions. The point is that NOTHING can tell us what the actual answer is, without knowing the relationship of the rain on Sat with the rain on Sun. We cannot simply add, multiply, subtract, or do anything with 50% and 50% to get the value you want. It is more complicated than that.

s9M1bJjsaa	Evolution assumes that all life forms on the planet Earth come from one original thing (we don't know what it was... probably some single celled organism). The idea is that everything evolved up different branches like a a tree growing from one tiny seedling into a huge woody tree with tons of branches and leaves... like a tree of life. so all life forms are somewhere on this tree and are therefore all related to each other to some degree. this means that all life on earth is a giant "family." if someone asked you what your relationship was to an old lady in your life you might say "grandmother" because that tells the person to what degree you are related to the old lady. they would know its the mother of one of your parents. <br>  <br>  an evolutionary relationship is the same thing, but is asking way more broadly. if i said humans had a "close" evolutionary relationship to dogs that would mean that humans and dogs branched off from each other and evolved differently in the more recent past.

If a climate is very dry, there's never a drought, because it doesn't rain there anyway. There is no drought on the Moon. What would be a drought to Austin right now could be completely normal to some places in Austrailia. In other words, drought is a short-term weather pattern, not a climate condition.

cAMdBtFQaa	For full self sufficiency, in Colorado, you will need about 10 acres.  The problem is the fruit trees and animals.   Also, you will need a source of water.  A cow will require between 3 to 5 acres per animal, you will need 2, one for milk and one for meat.  Rabbits don't take that much room and grow pretty fast and they are fairly tolerant on their food.  The use of regular gardening processes should be sufficient to produce enough vegetables.<br>  <br>  With, Permaculture as I understand it, I am not sure a person could feed themselves in Colorado with that process since it requires the use of natural settings and naturally sustainable relationships for what you want to grow.  Colorado's natural processes would leave you with some severe dietary problems to over come.<br>  <br>  If you are just looking to supplement your diet with your own products, you could cover a good deal with about 2 acres.  It would give you enough production to put up a good amount in canning and still allow for chickens and rabbits for meat and eggs.<br>  <br>  If you throw in a greenhouse, you could do better by extending your growing season a good deal.  The hard part of this is getting through the winter months, but you could get along fairly well with a greenhouse I think.  It would give you fresh greens.  Also, I would try hot frames, used by the Brits for winter gardening, and cold frames if a greenhouse isn't a consideration.
eb4c35dafb35b0cdb90317b7fc657b3faa	I am a permaculture farmer, in the U.S.A. (I assume you are in the U.K. since you used the word "smallholder") Have been for over 20 years.<br>  <br>  My answer may surprise you.  No, I do not believe permaculture farmers in the U.S.A. should receive Government subsidies.  Of course I FIRMLY do not believe that ANY farmer should receive Government subsidies.  <br>  <br>  Grants....yes, the small farmer, or permaculture farmer should be able to receive grants.<br>  <br>  In 20 years time, there has not been a single grant (or agriculture loan!!) that I've qualified for.<br>  <br>  I'm a very good writer, and know how to put together a simply outstanding grant.  I have impeccable records on my farm over the years (which show how it's grown ever single year).  <br>  <br>  I'm able to show how I've made goals, and plans and met them or exceeded them over the years.<br>  <br>  However as a small farmer, the only grants I could qualify for are if I was willing to become certified (by the Government) as an organic farm.  However being completely unwilling to fork over yet more of my money to line the Government's pockets there are zero grants that I can qualify for.  <br>  <br>  Frankly, I'm tired as he!! about beating my head against the brick wall everyone throws up if you want to do something "weird" or "off beat."<br>  <br>  Half of them think your a weirdo "hippie" (even if you show up in a business suit) because you want to do things in clean, natural ways, or they think you are an idiot "wannabe" farmer, because you want to do something crazy like raise meat goats.  Since goats are not one of the big three (beef, pork, chicken) you are doomed to fail....of course my business grows every single year!<br>  <br>  Yes, it's TERRIBLY frustrating to try to get an agricultural loan, and be turned down....when you can show your business growing by 50% (!!!!!) for six year, and making a profit.  Then to find out the dairy farm down the road which only makes it because of Government subsidies, pollutes horendously gets a loan no problem.  ~Grrrrr~<br>  <br>  As a permaculture farmer I've decided I no longer care about the subsidies, grants, or loans.  I'm making it without them.  What I want to STOP, and STOP NOW, are the serriously unfair laws, like the NAIS.<br>  <br>  Don't give the big boys an advantage over the small farmers...don't allow laws in favor of agra business over small farmers.<br>  <br>  ~Garnet<br>  Permaculture homesteading/farming over 20 years|`|cAMdBtFQaa	Short answer, you do, so yes.<br>  <br>  The subsidies you refer to are not the way you are implying.  We have to pay for it.  Also, in the matter of food production, it is crop insurance where the subsidy is applied, and we pay for that.<br>  As for the trees and hedges, we pay for those, granted it is at a lower cost than the general public, that is the subsidy, but it cannot be used for landscaping.<br>  <br>  If you were given subsidies and grants at the same value the farmer and rancher are, you would probably think about it the same way many of us do.  Not interested, thanks.  Once you accept a lot of these subsidies, you can't use your ground any more, you can't graze your animals or for anyone else.  You have to guarantee the survival of what is planted.  Drought knocked out one field for a neighbor, the extension office came by and made him replant at his expense or they would have billed him for the first planting that they gave him the seed for.<br>  <br>  I think you have listened to the news to much, they always seem to only get half the story on this stuff.  <br>  Go to your state ag office and learn about these programs.  You might change you mind like many of us have.<br>  <br>  I think your problem in getting in on the gravy train as you see it, is lack of land.  Go and buy 4 or 500 acres and see how the government hand out looks when you are trying to make the payments for it.<br>  Do you really want the government coming into your yard to decide if they like what you have done with the $5 they gave you.  If you have over 2 acres, you do qualify for the trees and shrubs part.|`|921fd3e5c127d3dd26ff9bd25b494b9aaa	Yes, I agree with you, they should be given the same considerations, or even more, as any other type of farmer. Were I am afraid that you would be disappointed is, these subsidies are given out as so much per acre, or so much per bushel produced, so permaculture and small land holders will still feel like they are receiving a pittance compared with larger 2000 acre farms.|`|AA10352420	They should get the same grants like any other farmers Why not??

Or it could be a speed limiter for a motor, an electric brake of sorts acting like a governor. Some motors use an induction brake instead of a speed control electronic circuit. The advantage being the induction brake has NO moving parts and no electronics to fail and requires no power supply.

xmvPyLYUaa	Use a proportion to find arc mAB:<br>  34.6/113.1 = x/360<br>  Solve the proportion and you get 110 degrees (rounded).  <br>  <br>  To find the radius, start with the formula for area of a circle:<br>  A = pi*r^2.  Usually, we're given the radius and have to find the area.  This time it's the other way around.  Substitute the area of circle D for A:<br>  113.1 = pi*r^2.  Divide both sides by pi, then take the square root of both sides.  Then you will get r = 6.0 m (rounded).<br>  If the radius is 6, then the diameter is 12 m.<br>  To find the circumference, multiply the diameter * pi.  In this case, it's 12*pi = 37.7 m (rounded)<br>  To find the arc length, take the measure of the arc (110 degrees), divide by 360, and muliply by the circumference:<br>  (110/360)*37.7 = 11.5 m (rounded).

hlTK7dTPaa	First off, dinosaurs are cold blooded reptiles which does not adjust their own body temperature. And thus, they can only live in a certain  range of temperature. But when the atmosphere was heated, the change in temperature was probably great enough to kill them. Photosynthesis requires light, and the dust reduced the amount of light received by plants. This will not  only reduce the amount of carbon dioxide absorbed by plants, but will also reduce their numbers. Plants are at the bottom of the trophic level, and when they die off, heterotrophs on the higher trophic levels won't get enough food to survive.
o1PesRLXaa	Producers are Autotrophic Organisms. "Autotrophic" means self-nourishing. The most conspicuous group of autotrophs are the photolithoautotrophs, organisms such as algae and flowering plants that have cells containing chlorophyll and are thus capable of fixing light energy ("photo-") to build complex organic substances from simple inorganic substances ("litho-"). The organic compounds that are created may be used structurally within the organism or may be latter broken down into inorganic matter and energy extracted by the process. Consumers are Heterotrophic Organisms, which are also termed macro consumers. A simple definition of a heterotrophic organism is a species that is dependent on organic matter for food. Decomposers are heterotrophic organisms. These are also termed micro consumers, saprobes, or saprophytes. Decomposers are scavengers that break down dead plants and animals.<br>  Decomposers are vital to the food web because they break down and recycle nutrients back into the soil. These nutrients are then used by producers to sustain life. Without the enzymes that decomposers provide to breakdown organic material into inorganic material, phosporous(P) and nitrogen(N), Producers would eventually die out and the main part of food webs would cease to exist and therefore life would cease to exist. Decomposers recycle material but they do not recycle energy. Solar irradiation still provides the energy that drives the life cycle.|`|P2IWRGHbaa	Basically it's saying something along the lines of if there were now plants(autotrophs) then there could not be animals and humans and such(heterotrophss) because heterotrophs rely on and need the nutrients of the autotrophs(plants). <br>  <br>  If you still need help let me know but I think that covered it!

Let's try starting with saying all we can about 2A. Tangent is opposite over adjacent(y/x).   |y|=4 |x|=3   Since we can't know which one is negative, 2A is either in the second(-x) or fourth(-y) quadrant.    r=sqrt(4^2+3^2)=5     sin 2A=+/-4/5   cos 2A=+/-3/5   Plugging 2A for theta and the value for cos 2A into the half angle formulas from wikipedia gives +/-sqrt((1+/-3/5)/2) for sine and cosine. If x was negative for 2A(second quadrant), cos 2A= -3/5, sin A= sqrt(4/5) and cos A= sqrt(1/5). We know the signs of the answers based on the fact that half of a second quadrant angle must be a first quadrant angle. If y was negative for 2A(fourth quadrant), cos 2A= 3/5, sin A= sqrt(1/5) and cos A= -sqrt(4/5). Here the cosine is negative because half of a fourth quadrant angle must be in the second quadrant. I would just divide sine by cosine to get tangent in both cases.

3lt167Ucaa	This is an "ICE" box question, and it's dealing with buffer solutions.<br>  <br>  First, set up a table with your variables. <br>  Ex: HC3H5O2 ---> C3H5O2- + H+<br>  List underneath the molecules the:<br>  1) Initial moles you start with<br>  2) Change in moles (requires a term for unknown variable, i.e. 'x')<br>  3) the number of moles at Equilibrium<br>  <br>  So for the first part of the problem, you are given 1.00 L of .1 M HC3H5O2. You can convert this into moles by cancelling out the volumetric units.<br>  1) So you initially have .1 moles of HC3H5O2, 0 moles of C3H5O2, and .022 moles of H+ from the HCl.<br>  2) The moles changing for HC3H5O2 would be a .1-x because you are losing x amount of your initial moles, whereas H+ and C3H5O2 are gaining x amount of moles; C3H5O2 should be x and H+ should be .022+x.<br>  3) Set your "change" values equal to your equilibrium constant, Ka. It should look something like this:<br>  Ka = [H+]*[C3H5O2-]/[HC3H5O2] = [x+.022]*[x]/[.1-x]<br>  Solve for x.<br>  <br>  The two following questions are similar I believe, only instead of being given an initial amount for HC3H5O2, you are also given [C3H5O2-]. Just input that into initial moles.<br>  <br>  [Hopefully this will help, I'm not sure if this is right because it has been a while since I've brushed up on this, but try it out and see if it's the right answer.]

Let me explain something to you. The reason why so many people fear calculus, organic chemistry, and many other subjects is because the material is presented as if you are already a genius who can interpret difficult concepts within seconds. <br>  <br>  First of all, if you do a little background research, you will discover that the most difficult subjects are hard for 1 main reason. That is because the authors INTENTIONALLY make the material extremely difficult to understand. <br>  <br>  They purposely make it difficult to understand because they trying to WEED OUT students. At the professional level, such as Ph.D, or M.D, or many other professional ranks, intelligent minds are sought after. <br>  <br>  Therefore, it would be HARMFUL for society if we were to make certain courses too easy. For instance, if we provide all the steps to answering a difficult math problem, then students ARE NOT learning the critical thinking skills that are necessary for difficult math problems. Therefore, authors intentially give hard problems, and only give you a few examples on how to solve the problems. Then, with limited information, you are required to answer a variety of questions that are much harder than the examples. <br>  <br>  As you see, only the brightest, or highly motivated students are going to excel in these subjects. The average student will FAIL, or barely pass. This is important because for the HIGH EXPERTISE FIELDS that require an extremely sophisticated level of expertise, YOU DO NOT WAN"T AN AVERAGE STUDENT working in these fields. <br>  <br>  Lastly, being able to solve problems in Calculus by only using your brain means that you can CRITICALLY THINK. Anybody can solve a calculus problem if they have the answer to a similar problem in front of them. Most students in math ONLY MEMORIZE the EXAMPLES, as well as FORMULAS. The math GENIOUSES understand the theory! Understanding theory is more important than memorizing formulas! Therefore, these subjects are hard because they were intentionally made that way for the sole purpose of FINDING THE GENIOUSES!<br>  <br>  This is why so many students fear calculus, as well as many other difficult subjects. These subjects basically tell them "YOU"RE NOT SMART!"  Although I think everyone can learn calculus if they tried hard, some people are not willing to put in the extreme amount of effort required to successfully do well in calculus! Also, if you get a C or less on the first calculus exam, statistically, your chances of passing with an A would only be a miracle!|`|o5Tb8ZQ0aa	I don' so much fear it, I have no idea how to do it. lol it boggles my mind. my intelligences lie elsewhere apparently. but, I was punished for 8 hours with math, my father screaming at me, calling me stupid in 6th grade cuz I couldn't understand algebra and calculus that was from college. How is a beginning 6th grader supposed to even try to learn that when they are only in long division at the time? Also how are they supposed to learn without support of the teacher, instead being ridiculed and abused with mathematics. He actually used it as a punishment for me.

PpfLgjINaa	People, including engineers and scientists, utilize theories in the context that they are best applied.  An example of this in geometry relates to the idea of parallel lines.  In local or Euclidian geometry, where all objects exist on a flat plane, parallel lines never cross, but Einstein describes a world where space was curved and parallel lines would eventually cross.  In Einstein's world, parallel lines don't exist, and yet, the use of parallel lines is very common in building bridges, skyscrapers, or even simple toys.  Does this mean that one of the theories is wrong and the other is correct?  No, this means that each theory is useful from a certain perspective.  So, how does this relate to quantum mechanics and relativity?<br>  <br>  Quantum mechanics is useful for local calculations just as Euclidian geometry is useful locally, but when taking a more global perspective, it is necessary to consider characteristics on a larger scale.  A great deal of evidence has been provided for relativity, and so it is considered to be very useful in the sciences.  The same is true of quantum mechanics.  Either can be considered to be valid within their respected domains.<br>  <br>  The fact is that the discovery of entangled particles has brought into question Einstein's theory that nothing can travel more quickly than the speed of light.  Entangled particles, irregardless of how far apart they are, react to each other simultaneously.  How could this happen if it is a requirement that the information that travels from one particle to another travel slower than the speed of light?  The answer is, it couldn't happen, and so, Einstein was likely wrong when he stated that nothing can travel more quickly than the speed of light.  This does not invalidate relativity as a whole, and it does not make relativity any less useful to physicists.  It does provide an example of a place where more scientific exploration is necessary to explain and "unexplainable" phenomenon.  How is the state of one particle transfered to the other over long distances?  What physical mechanism is used to accomplish this transfer of information?  Are there other similar phenomenon that might use this same mechanism?<br>  <br>  In his book "Entangled Minds", Dean Radin explores the connection between entangled particles, clairvoyance, and telepathy.  He presents a theory that these phenomenon could use the same mechanisms for communication, but it has yet to be discovered by physicists.  In my opinion, just as some physcial laws only apply when considered on a larger scale, so might some psychological mechanisms only become apparent when they are considered as part of a larger scale theory.  In other words, the mechanisms of logic, communcation, and reason hold true locally, but when looking at a larger scale which includes the spiritual realm, other mechanisms of communication may become apparent.  Of course, this is all theory, but your question illustrates that there are questions in our understanding of science which must be explained.  To answer these questions, we must consider all of the unexplained phenomenon, including the evidence of telepathy and clairvoyance, if we are to acheive a better scientific understanding of how the world around us is working.<br>  <br>  Thanks for the great question!|`|duVTqRM4aa	Amazing isn't it.  INSTANTANEOUS COMMUNICATION between 2 particles who are a long distance apart.   And the skeptics can't even pretend it's not real.  Yet they can't wrap their heads around the fact that this is exactly what we're talking about when it comes to remote viewing.  They will catch up eventually because the rest of the world isn't going to stay in the dark ages.|`|4zspYrGXaa	First, a fact is just a well accepted theory that most utilize and feel is true. But, facts can change. Einstein's theories go along way as "fact" however, a few areas have been disproved. Theories are put "out there" so other scientists can test and try to prove or disprove them.<br>  Currently I teach 8th grade Physics. There are so very many errors in my textbook that I struggle each year to keep my students up to the cutting edge on theories that are changing and opening up new avenues of ideas and change for our community.<br>  For example: Austin, Texas Dr. H. Puthoff and his remarkable team have been working on zero point energy. Better known as ZPE. a unique way to gather energy from our negative energy space out in the universe and use it for electricity and what ever.<br>  The phasing in and out of the electrons within an atom is Absolutely amazing to me. It is one of the many areas of quantum physics.<br>  <br>  Basically, all things are inter-related. What each object does influences others in unfathomable ways. When an electron phases out into the universe or another dimension, we don't know where it goes... but we do know it comes back to its original nucleus.|`|mjrLWAbXaa	Tunsa as usual gave an excellent explanation. <br>  However, the idea that two particles can communicate or influence one another without any known mechanism has several problems.<br>  <br>  1. It violates the laws of physics taught to 3rd graders<br>  2. It is an extraordinary claim and requires extraordinary evidence<br>  3. The numerous experiments and replications are unconvincing to everyone except those that already believe<br>  4. It must not be true because if it was they would have won the <br>      one million dollar prize from Randi Challenge<br>  5. All the statistics are bad and the methods are flawed<br>      (no I can't provide any specific flaw but its up to you to   prove my<br>       claims against the experiments are false not up to me to back up<br>       my claims).<br>  <br>  Psiexploration|`|1505a95e660275609c4bb43c388cdf1aaa	General relativity and quantum mechanics both work very well on their respective scales (if they didn't, we wouldn't have GPS or MRI machines) - they are both accurate - they just don't mesh when you try to scale them to each other.  And that's a no-no in physics - they need to agree.  They do agree if you take into account another 9 dimensions, but we don't know for sure those exist, so that might not be the solution.  We'll have to wait and see the outcomes of some experiments coming up in the next few years to see if the extra dimensions can work as a real solution (LISA and the LHC).<br>  <br>  The subatomic particle experiment you're talking about took place in the Canary Islands last year, and yes, it worked.  What we have are 'entangled' particles - the state of one particle depends on the state of the other, so if you measure one of them the other is automatically changed as a result - no matter the distance between them, it happens instantaneously.  While it's been called 'quantum teleportation' there's actually no exchange of particles, and nothing is moving.  Only the state of the particle has changed.  But we can imagine this may someday be used for communicating across great distances.|`|t5Nrj6Txaa	Woah, this is a huge issue.  First, " . . . can you tell me what is theory and what is fact?" is a huge issue alone.  For the most part, people take our best theories as fact.  For instance, if you start to study physics, you'll likely start with Newton's laws.  Are Newton's laws true?  Well, no--they have certain limits of validity.  That doesn't make them less useful.  All of our notions of reality are ideas, they are not to be confused with a reality "out there".  As Korzybski said, "The map is not the territory."<br>  <br>  As for non-locality, Bell showed that:<br>  <br>  "No physical theory of local hidden variables can ever reproduce all of the predictions of quantum mechanics."<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell's_Theorem" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell's_Theo...</a><br>  <br>  This means that a better theory will have to be non-local, or we will have to suffice with quantum theory as it is.<br>  <br>  Einstein postulated that no information travels faster than c, but in quantum systems, when you make a measurement on one particle, it then can tell you the state of a particle an arbitrary distance away.  Einstein did not like quantum mechanics, and referred to this as "spooky action at a distance."<br>  <br>  In short, relativity and quantum mechanics are both hugely successful frameworks, although they are at times incompatible.  People are still trying to unite these theories in various exotic ways.  Ultimately, the goal is to create a mathematical model of all realistic systems, but we don't control what surprises nature has in store for us.<br>  <br>  You might also be interested in the EPR paradox:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPR_paradox" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPR_paradox</a>

zFsTSrOcaa	Nibiru is a fictitious member of the solar system, supposedly five times the size of earth and due to pass close enough to cause catastrophic damage on 12/21/2012. We know it's fictitious for several reasons:<br>  <br>  1. An object five times the size of earth would be visible in backyard telescopes decades before it could approach the earth. No such object has been seen despite decades of observation by millions of professional and amateur astronomers.<br>  <br>  2. Such an object would also have a large gravitational effect on nearby objects, including the rest of the outer planets, and they would not follow their predicted orbits. In fact, the planet Neptune was discovered based on errors in the predicted orbits of known planets. Since the planets are where we calculate they're supposed to be, there is no large unseen object pulling them off course.<br>  <br>  3. Believers in Nibiru change their prediction every time an old prediction proves false. Nibiru was originally predicted to appear in 2003; now it's supposed to be in 2012, so who knows what they'll be predicting in 2013?<br>  <br>  Why do they continue to insist that Nibiru is real?

In fact, REAL scientists now accept that the texts referred to Saturn.<br>  <br>  The planet found in 1999 was in a different solar system.  It was NOT wandering around the galaxy.

They are named after their star, and given a Greek letter. So for example the star may be 51 Pegasi Alpha, its first planet would be 51 Pegasi Bravo.<br>  <br>  The first extrasolar planet was discovered in 1989 (and confirmed in 1996).<br>  <br>  Pluto is no longer considered a planet. The IAU recently defined "planet" for the first time, mainly because of the discovery of planets orbiting other stars. Pluto is not deemed to be a planet mainly because its orbital path is not cleared of other objects, its orbital path is not its own (it often passes inside Neptune's orbit) and its orbit is extremely eccentric, with a massive inclination compared to the others. It is instead classified as a "Kuiper Belt Object", and there are several objects in the Belt of greater size than Pluto.

6R1tSwRzaa	So I guess you want us to prove the phrase "If you add an edge to a tree, you are creating a cycle."?<br>  <br>  The proof would go like this:<br>  Say we add an edge between vertex u and vertex v.  Since the graph is a tree, and is connected, we know that there is a unique path between u and v (before we add the new edge).  Call this path P1.  Now add edge uv.  There is now a new path between u and v (consisting of only the edge uv).  Call this path P2.  By using P1 and P2, we are showing that there is a path from u to v, and another (non-intersecting) path from u to v, and thus there must be a cycle.<br>  <br>  Hooray for Combinatorics.  I'm Euler.

Let's let X denote one cay and Y denote the other.<br>  <br>  You know that X + Y = 60. You also know that 20X + 40Y = 2,000.<br>  <br>  Solving the first equation for X, we obtain X = 60 - Y. We can now substitute this into the second equation to try and solve for Y. <br>  <br>  Doing so we get:<br>  <br>  20(60-Y) + 40Y = 2,000<br>  1200 - 20Y + 40Y = 2,000<br>  1200 + 20Y = 2,000<br>  20Y = 800<br>  Y=40.<br>  <br>  To solve for X, we can simply substitute the Y=40 into the original equation to obtain that X=20.<br>  <br>  Thus, our two answers are 40 and 20!

As a fluid is heated, the molecules increase in motion and the fluid begins to expand - molecules move further apart.  This gives a decrease in density which causes the hotter fluid to rise and the cool fluid to fall, setting up a circulation within the fluid.  The heat energy is gradually increased throughout the fluid.<br>  Therefore, 'Convection' is the transfer of heat throughout a Fluid (Gas or Liquid) by circulatory currents set up by the difference in density between hot and cold fluid.<br>  <br>  2..'Conduction' is the transfer of heat in a Solid by the 'Collision of Molecules' within the solid by increased Kinetic Energy thereby increasing molecular motion and the number of collisions taking place.<br>  This kind of heat transfer can only take place in solids and is considered as the slowest form of heat transfer.   Solids which allow the flow of  heat are referred to as ' Conductors '  and, those which do not conduct heat are called ' Insulators ' <br>  <br>  3..'Kinetic Enegy' is Energy a body has by virtue of the motion of its molecules.<br>  <br>  4..'Radiation' is the transfer of heat by exposure to Direct heat ...<br>  Radiated heat is illustrated by the heat of the sun which reaches earth as  ' Rays '  of heat energy which are invisible but similar to rays of light.   A further example is, heat from an open fire - when you are standing in front of the fire, the side facing the fire becomes warm (by the radiated heat) while the other side remains cool (due to the convection currents set up ).<br>  Radiated heat needs no material for its transfer and can travel through vacuum (as from the sun ).  Substances in the path of radiated heat will increase in temperature.<br>  <br>  5..Energy is the ‘Ability’ or ‘Capacity‘ to do work.<br>  Potential Energy’ is the energy of a body by virtue of its position.<br>  P.E. is Stored Energy (waiting to be used) and, when in use it converts to K.E.<br>  <br>  6..Force is the product of the Mass of a body in kilograms, being acted upon by Gravity.<br>  i.e. Force = Mass(kg) x Acceleration due to Gravity (9.81m/s2) on Earth.<br>  F = mg. The product of this gives ‘Newtons’ (N) of Force.<br>  e.g. a man has a mass of 80kg.

ACToJVljaa	Oh boy.<br>  <br>  Well, this is a philisophical issue at its core. Everything we know (except for the abstract) is built upon models. Everything.

The models you have subconsciously developed over the course of your life say that there should be a computer there. But do you actually have the right to say that you KNOW there is a computer... no, you do not.<br>  <br>  The same type of thing applies to atomic theory.

ajzq5nKIaa	We call curves which minimise arc length 'geodesics'. The easiest way to find them is using calculus of variations. <br>  <br>  There are kind of two ways of doing this; we can either parameterise the surface with t; or we can consider the functionals being of two parts, one part of which is the arc length which is to be minimised, and other other part is the 'surface constraint'. I will demonstrate both method with an example, with the second one first as it seems your problem is more in that form.<br>  <br>  <br>  'Lagrange multiplier' method:<br>  <br>  In this method we consider the functional being minimised, and the 'extra condition' given by the surface, and then we compile them into a single functional and write the Euler-Lagrange equations.

Since<br>  <br>  ?r/?θ = (-a*sinθ, a*cosθ, 0)<br>  ?r/?z = (0, 0, 1);<br>  <br>  we can calculate the first fundamental forms as:<br>  <br>  E = a^2, F = 0, G = 1, and so the geodesics of the cylinder have the equations<br>  <br>  d/dt[(a^2*θ')/sqrt(a^2*(θ')^2 + (z')^2)] = 0 (1)<br>  d/dt[(z')/sqrt(a^2*(θ')^2 + (z')^2)] = 0 (2).<br>  <br>  Integrating, we get<br>  <br>  (a^2*θ')/sqrt(a^2*(θ')^2 + (z')^2) = C1 (3)<br>  (z')/sqrt(a^2*(θ')^2 + (z')^2) = C2 (4).<br>  <br>  and dividing (4) by (3), we get<br>  <br>  dz/dθ = B (where B = C2*a^2/C1), which has the solution<br>  <br>  z = Bθ + C,<br>  <br>  easily recognisable as a helix.

So if you multiply Todd's age by 2 which would give you 28 and then add 10 you get Tom's age. <br>  <br>  For the second problem the answer is B. <br>  <br>  Ed is 1/5 as old as Laura. So Laura would be 20 and if you divide that by 5 you get 4 which is how old Ed is. So Ed is 4, Laura is 20. <br>  <br>  Now in 12 years Ed would be 16 and Laura old be 32. If you take Laura's age and divide it by 4 you get 32/4 which is 8. THen you add 8 so you get 16 which is how old Ed would be in 12 years.

But since I also live less than 100m from open (sea) water, the climate here is pretty mild: The fjord below me never freezes, there's a constant 3 kt current which breaks up any ice before it has time to form. Since water has an immense heat capacity, all this water flowing past stabilises winter temperatures so that it never gets really cold here - it's a lot warmer here in winter than just 3 km inland!<br>  <br>  As a "retribution", it doesn't get quite as hot here in the summer as it dies just a little bit inland. My neighbor sometimes complains about this, but then I invite him into my garden for a beer and je just shuts up: I live in a "notch" in a mountainside with rock on three sides. By 10 AM on a sunny day the temperature in my garden climbs above 40C, and the lawn won't get cut today.

X0e6p9Ilaa	Melting point is a function of the INTERMOLECULAR bonds, not the internal bonding in a compound.  What makes NaCl have the higher melting point is that it is a network solid.  In this case, NaCl is a network of Na and Cl atoms which are joined by highly polar bonds. <br>  <br>  It is the network that makes for the high melting point.  Sugar forms individual molecules which are attracted to each other by weaker London dispersion forces.  Therefore, sugar has the lower melting point.<br>  <br>  Repeat.  Despite what your book says about "ionic" compounds having high MP's and covalent compounds having low MP's, the deciding factor in melting point is the INTERMOLECLAR bonding, not the internal bonding.  The highest melting point known exists in diamond, which is a network of COVALENTLY bonded carbon atoms.  It's the network that makes for the high melting point!!!!

TRCuikgfaa	Yes, the relationship is linear. The initial reaction rate increases as the substrate concentration increases. With more substrates, there will be a more of the reaction ocuring, as there is more to be used up. The importance of temperature regulating mechanisms in orgnaisms prevents enzymes from denaturing. Enzymes are proteins, and an increase in temperature is a way to proteins to get denatured, which changes their shape, which then loses its function. For example, if an enzyme is denatured, it's active site changes, thus no substrates can bind to it, thus losing its function to aide a reaction.|`|GgClh7dbaa	The initial reaction rate (Vi) and substrate concentration [S] are linearly related until substrate enzyme saturation occurs, then the rate remains constant for all additional increases in the concentration of the substrate. The change is not abrupt, but gradual over a short range of substrate concentrations just below saturation, so the linear portion of the graph curves softly to the horizontal (see top graph at  <a href="http://users.rcn.com/jkimball.ma.ultranet/BiologyPages/E/EnzymeKinetics.html" rel="nofollow">http://users.rcn.com/jkimball.ma.ultrane...</a> )<br>  <br>  Warm-bloodedness, or the ability of an organism to maintain a constant internal temperature through a range of environmental (or ambient) temperatures, is an important evolutionary adaptation to keep metabolism functioning optimally.
pSOQTumdaa	transposition - The ability of genes to change position on chromosomes, a process in which a transposable element is removed from one site and inserted into a second site in the DNA. Genetic transposition was the first type of genetic instability to be discovered.<br>  <br>  Today, some transposons—the pieces of DNA that change position within genomes, of which McClintock's Dissociator is an example—are used to produce mutations. By inserting into a piece of DNA and mutating a neighboring gene, these transposons can enable adjacent cells to have different genotypes.<br>  <br>  In humans, only a miniscule amount of transposons remain active. It is estimated that 50 LINE transposons and few, if any, DNA transposons remain functional within the human genome.
OtHhCy3Waa	Or, you could try this:<br>  <br>  First, buy a cheap houseplant (If you live in a warm climate then just pick something interesting from outside).<br>  <br>  Then cut off 4 or 5 branches of similar size and stick them in separate contaners with eaqual amounts of water.<br>  <br>  then trim the leaves so that one branch has no leaves, one has all it's leaves, and the other three have 25, 50 and 75% of their leaves respectively.<br>  <br>  Now all you have to do is wait a day and see how much water is left in each container.<br>  <br>  Yes, some water loss will be due to evaporation, but this loss will be normalized as each sample will evaporate at an identical rate.<br>  <br>  Therefore, the difference in water loss between the samples will reflect the transpirational flow of water up through the cut stem and out of the stomatal pores.|`|M6AySVxOaa	Make a container that seals off the roots from the leaves yet still allows sunlight to hit the leaves. If you have a large bell jar that will work. You will have to construct a petition out of wood, styrofoam, or something you can fashion into a circle that will fill the bottom of the bell jar. In the middle you will have to make a hole big enough so that the roots of your plant will fit through. Then once the plant is through the hole in the middle you will have to fill in the space between the stem and opening in the middle hole. You could use something like putty or clay to fill this in. Once you have potted the roots of your plant you will then place the plant and its petition in place making sure that there are no holes between the glass of the jar and your circular petition. If there are any holes fill them in with putty or clay. <br>  Now you have the plant's leaves separated from the moisture in the ground. This means that if any moisture is produce in the air of the jar it comes from the leaves and not from the soil. In the top of the bell jar you will insert a rubber stopper with one hole in it. Through this hole you will place a small piece of glass tubing. You will then connect an appropriate piece of rubber tubing about a foot and a half long. Since the moisture coming out of the leaves is in the form of gas (water vapor)  it will have to be condensed. You can condense the water vapor in the rubber tubing by filling two plastic bags with ice cubes and tying the bags of ice cubes around the rubber tubing, one on one side the other on the other side. The condensed water can be collected in a glass.  This is not a perfect system since the air already present in the jar has humidity from before you started the experiment some of the moisture will come from the humidity.
YIimBqZPaa	omg your teacher must be truly sadistic! <br>  <br>  The answer is A , because from the first mating we can deduce that the striped gene is dominant (S) while the the solid tan is recessive (s), because only Ss X ss will give you 50% striped and 50% solid.<br>  <br>  Now, all the striped offspring from the first mating carries the Ss gene, right? Therefore the second mating will consist of Ss X Ss, which gives you 25% SS, 50% Ss, and 25% ss. However, the question tells you that 2/3 of the offsprings were striped, while 1/3 were tan, meaning that some of the striped hamsters died off, thus raising the percentage of tan hamsters.<br>  <br>  We could deduce that it's the SS striped hamster that died, because if you take out the 25% of SS hamsters, 50% Ss striped divided by 75% total equals 2/3, and 25% ss tan divided by 75% total equals 1/3. Therefore the answer is A, individuals homozygous for the striped allele (SS) die before birth.

XrGwWhEAaa	It is too small|`|HleW2hzraa	the scientists discovered that pluto is just a large orbiting meteor.|`|QPWjtDzcaa	In August of 2006, the International Astronomical Union (the only organization responsible for the classification and naming of celestial bodies) developed a definition for the term planet.<br>  <br>  1.  It must orbit the sun<br>  2.  It must be roughly spherical in shape due to it's own gravity (hydrostatic equilibrium)<br>  3.  It must have "cleared its orbit"  via its gravitational influence.<br>  <br>  While I agree the second and third criteria are not clear cut definitions (roughly spherical...  how close to "round" actually qualifies,  and there are orbit-crossing objects pretty much near every planet's orbit, just google some images of NEO's, and one *could* argue that Earth, Venus and Mars don't appear to have "celared their neighborhoods") Pluto does indeed fail miserably in meeting the third criteria.<br>  <br>  So, a new classification of solar system bodies was created, called "Dwarf Planets."  A Dwarf Planet meets the first two, is not a satellite of another body, and does not meet the third criteria for the definition of planet.<br>  <br>  Objects such as Pluto, Humea, Makemake, Eris, and Ceres fit the definition of Dwarf Planet.  <br>  <br>  I would also like to add, that, Pluto does have some comet-like attributes.  It did display some outgassing during its perihelion.  I would not be surprised if the classification of Pluto comes up again following and during the primary mission of the New Horizons Mission.|`|4RJKl1aKaa	It never was a planet according to present definitions.  Nor is it that the definition of planet has changed.  When it was discovered a planet was not really defined and as such describing anything as a planet was imprecise.  Now "planet" has been defined and Pluto does not fit the bill.  The change has nothing to do with Pluto per se.<br>  <br>  Pluto does not qualify as a planet because it has not cleared its orbit.  That is to say there are many other bodies in the same region of space.  Pluto is only one of them.|`|LEixu90naa	Pluto has been own graded to a dwarf planet. It maintains some of the planet status due to a few facts, primarily it has three moons. Another reason is that it is larger than most other rocks out there in space.  And, finally, it does orbit the Sun, whereas asteroids and other matter do not always orbit the Sun.  One of these  three moons is so close to Pluto and  1/2 Pluto's mass, that Pluto and it's moon actually orbit each other!!! A celestial body with an orbiting moon that itself orbits the sun can be classified as a planet. However, due to the small nature of Pluto, it has receive it's reclassification and stands with several other dwarf planets in our solar system.|`|H6MT8Z8caa	It is considered to be a small type of sum sort like there are different categories planets, stars, asteroids, moons etc etc i forgot what its called but pluto is in a differnt type of category kinda like a very very large asteroid that is no longer consisdered a planet because of its size.<br>  <br>  hope i helped [:|`|yZUQToOdaa	Because astronomers think that Pluto is too small to be a planet.

Obviously the contraction date will depend on how much dark matter there really is. The jury is still out as to whether to how much dark matter there is, and the estimates vary enough to put both scenarios, an ever expanding universe, and an eventually contracting universe, within reach.<br>  <br>  Since we don't know how much dark matter there is, and hence what the density of the universe is, we also don't know when (that's if) the expansion will come to an end. At present the rate of expansion is (still) accelerating.<br>  <br>  But then, our view of how the universe really looks like seems to change every few decades or so. Theoretical physics is an extremely complex field of science. The conclusions drawn by the top minds in the field still differ wildly. The likes of Einstein and Stephen Hawkins have all changed their minds at some stage in their life, so in a sense they don't even agree with themselves. Because of all this I, personally, am not holding my breath thinking that we currently know what's going on...

03237277bf4a625644fe422b9d489a7aaa	2Fe+3/2O2=Fe2O3 can be written as Fe2O3 = 2Fe+3/2O2.  So, switch the signs: -823.41KJ becomes 823.41KJ.  We are switching this because we are trying to get the top two equations to look like the bottom one.  See how the Fe2O3 is on the left side of the equation for the botttom one?  That's why we wrote the equation as "Fe2O3 = 2Fe+3/2O2" so the Fe2O3 is on the same side.<br>  <br>  There are 3Fe2O3 so multiply the "Fe2O3 = 2Fe+3/2O2" by 3.<br>  3Fe2O3 = 6Fe+9/2O2.  We multiply the 823.41KJ by 3 also (whatever we do to the formula, we do to the H also). H = 2470.23.<br>  <br>  Looking at the right side of the very last reaction, we see that the Fe3O4 is on the right side and that there are 2 moles of them. So, the Fe3O4 is on the correct side for the second equation.  It only needs to be multiplied by 2.  So, let's multiply the second equation by 2:<br>  6Fe+4O2=2Fe3O4 Delta H= -2240.96KJ<br>  <br>  Let's put the equations together and add them:<br>  3Fe2O3 = 6Fe+9/2O2 Delta H=2470.23<br>  6Fe+4O2=2Fe3O4 Delta H= -2240.96KJ<br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  3Fe2O3 + 6Fe + 4O2 = 6Fe + 9/2O2 + 2Fe3O4<br>  The 6Fe from each side cancel out.  There are 4 O2 on each side so cancel those out leaving a 1/2O2 on the right side.<br>  <br>  3Fe2O3=2Fe3O4 +1/2O2 is what we get.  The delta H = 2470.23+-2240.96 = 229.27kJ.  I'm not sure why your final reaction is different, but that's the answer!

The comparison to methanol is inappropriate because methanol is much heavier (32 AMU) compared to 17 for NH3.|`|ACToJVljaa	Good question!<br>  <br>  It has to do with the fact that nitrogen has only one lone pair, while having three hydrogens to hydrogen bond. This means it can only form one hydrogen bond per molecule.

The oxygen in water has two lone pairs, as well as two hydrogens per oxygen. This means that water has the potential to form a hydrogen bond with every single hydrogen, making the intermolecular forces stronger.

ygDC4JFYaa	In a gravitational two-body problem with the eccentricity in this range both bodies follow similar elliptic orbits with the same orbital period around their common barycenter. Also the relative position of one body with respect to the other follows an elliptic orbit.<br>  <br>  Any classical system of two particles is, by definition, a two-body problem. In many cases, however, one particle is significantly heavier than the other, e.g., the Earth and the Sun. In such cases, the heavier particle is approximately the center of mass, and the reduced mass is approximately the lighter mass. Hence, the heavier mass may be treated roughly as a fixed center of force, and the motion of the lighter mass may be solved for directly by one-body methods.|`|VS0PuI5paa	You could start by saying that all planets follow curved paths because they just follow the space-time curvature created by the sun's gravity.  A perfect orbit will be a circular one, because a circle is just an ellipse with no eccentricity.  A perfect orbit would exactly match angular velocity with gravity, producing a circle.  Consider something with a highly eccentric orbit, however: a comet.  A comet falls almost directly towards the sun, but still has enough angular velocity to miss it.  As it falls towards the sun it uses its gravitational potential to gain further speed until it swings around and begins falling away this time, losing its momentum again but gaining back its gravitation potential.  So the speed of the comet varies depending on its distance from the sun in an endless cycle.  A planet, therefore, would be somewhere between a perfectly circular orbit and a highly eccentric or elliptical one.|`|8Ckm84UXaa	The elliptical orbits of planets would be formed by the Resultant force of  two unequal attractive forces exerted by two bodies in space.|`|xRWmM39waa	okay all about inertia... in a sence. the planets are "falling"<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  the gravity of hte sun pulls<br>  <br>  the inertia of hte planet pulls in the opposite way.<br>  <br>  in a way all the planets are falling tword the sun. but the inertia keeps them going..<br>  <br>  <br>  if you had a metal ball on a rope, and spun around. the rope woudl reprosent hte gravity, you woudl represtent the sun, and the ball woudl represent the planet.<br>  <br>  as you spin., the planet goes further out intill the maximum length of the rope has been met.<br>  <br>  when you let go (the equivelent of the sun loosing gravity like immediatly) then the ball woudl keep going.
AA12026167	There are so many receivers and transmitters which are highly efficient..For Example, TSOP receiver will detect only one frequency that is used to transmit. Also we can sense the distance even if it is kept 10-100m apart.

t5Nrj6Txaa	False.  Drag and gravity are in the same direction going up, but in different directions going down.  This means the ball is more quickly slowed on the way up, than accelerated on the way down.<br>  <br>  Another way to look at it, is since energy is dissipated during the trajectory, the greatest speed the ball has is when it is initially released, when you catch it again, it's speed will be less than the speed you released it at.  Given it travelled the same distance, which time would be greater?|`|5wAAnZPYaa	False! Because the time and distance of upward journey depends upon the power given to it to go up whereas the time taken for downward journey depends upon only the distance and gravity force.|`|0b749584c35f2d85b042fb4c77b72f79aa	True.<br>  The moment it's thrown in the air, its speed is the max. Then the speed goes on decreasing till it becomes 0, and then the ball starts descending, and the speed starts increasing... just before hitting the ground, it's speed is the max again.<br>  It takes the same time to go up and come down because it stops midway in the air (with its speed = 0) only when all of its kinetic energy(K.E) is converted to potential energy(P.E). So now, for the PE to convert itself back to KE takes the same amt of time as it did for the KE to convert to PE.|`|2moeJKdhaa	Think about gravity and how it is acting on the ball in both directions.  Is the ball decelerating at the same rate as it accelerates?  Use a plug number with the acceleration of gravity and see what you get.  Without actually telling you the answer, that should be plenty to help you figure it out.<br>  <br>  Use 9.8 meters, then 19.6, then 29.4 and write down the time for the speed to reach 0.

HyUE9ON0aa	Andrew is correct, the answer is Guano.<br>  <br>  A substance composed chiefly of the dung of sea birds or bats, accumulated along certain coastal areas or in caves and used as fertilizer.<br>  <br>  @@@@@@<br>  <br>  Here are a few more answers:<br>  <br>  Accumulated excrement and remains of birds, bats, and seals, valued as fertilizer. Bird guano comes mainly from islands off the coasts of Peru, Baja California, and Africa that are heavily populated by cormorants, pelicans, and gannets. Bat guano is found in caves throughout the world, and seal guano has accumulated to great depths on islands off northwestern Peru; both are lower in fertilizer value than bird guano.<br>  <br>  @@@@<br>  <br>  Guano, nitrate-rich bat dung that is an excellent fertilizer, was first imported into the United States in 1824 by John S. Skinner, a proponent of progressive agriculture and the editor of the first U.S. farm journal, American Farmer. The agricultural press, picking up on progressive farming techniques that made use of various fertilizers (composed of bones, seaweed, rock phosphate, night soil, or various manures) to boost production, began to focus attention on the value of guano as an almost magical fertilizer. Its advocates urged farmers to try it, regaling them with fabulous stories of its productive power, but its use was insignificant until the 1840s and never spread far beyond the relatively small, if influential, group of progressive farmers. Its high price, owing in part to a Peruvian monopoly of the principal source, led to declining use after 1854.<br>  <br>  <br>  @@@@<br>  <br>  guano (gw?'nō) , dried excrement of sea birds and bats found principally on the coastal islands of Peru, Africa, Chile, and the West Indies. It contains about 6% phosphorus, 9% nitrogen, 2% potassium, and moisture.

No one would be able to convince me that the experiences I had during life weren't real, whether I had an afterlife or not. During this life, what I have experienced says that yes there is something, so whether I am chosen to experience it from the other side or not, wouldn't change the fact that the other side exists. <br>  <br>  I will get a lot of thumb downs for my answer but I don't care. I know that the other side exists without a doubt.|`|Q7ALl9zeaa	I am not really afraid to die, what i am afraid of is dying too young and leaving my children, or as any parent would, lose a child. I believe there is an afterlife and perhaps who we are in real life determines where we go or what happens to our soul after our bodies are left. When I do die, I wouldn't mind so much if i was allowed to keep a loving watchful eye on family, friends or even a stranger that is alone. I have seen things that prove to me that the soul lives on, and still i am looking for ways to explain it. There is more to the equation of life and death than we give credit for.

This is because we are looking for the lowest value that is common to each denominator.  Obviously a-b and a+b don't have something in common.  But the last part, a^2 - b^2 is a multiplication of the first two.  We want to use the denominator that has something in common with the other denominators so that we can reduce the fraction down to a single expression.  This makes things much easier to work with.  <br>  <br>  It might be easier to think of it in terms of pure integers instead of variables.  For example if you have a 7 on the bottom of one part, a 6 on the bottom of the second part, and a 42 on the bottom of the third part your common denominator will be 42.  A lot of times you have to pick the most complicated part, and it just works out that it is a multiplication of the other two.<br>  <br>  Now that you have your common denominator you can put that part down and draw a line over it.  But in order to put the top part in, we have to make sure each part of this expression is accounted for.  So, go through the first part of it first.  You see a-b is accounted for in the bottom, but since our denominator is (a-b)(a+b) we want to put the leftover value up top.  So:<br>  <br>  3a(a+b).....<br>  ------------------------------------<br>            (a^2 - b^2)<br>  <br>  Next, we add to this by looking at the second term.  We do the same thing here.  Just multiply the top by whatever is missing from the bottom to complete the a^2 - b^2 term<br>  <br>  3a(a+b) - 5b(a-b) ......<br>  ------------------------------------<br>           (a^2 - b^2)<br>  <br>  Then do the same for the last part.  You'll notice since it is already over our common denominator we don't need to multiply the top term by anything else.  So we now have:<br>  <br>  3a(a+b) - 5b(a-b) - 6ab<br>  -----------------------------------<br>           (a^2 - b^2)<br>  <br>  Ok so now we distribute the top part and reduce it completely to give us:<br>  <br>  3a^2 -8ab + 5b^2 <br>  ---------------------------<br>         (a^2-b^2)|`|EGNX4tuxaa	Multiply the first term by (a+b)/(a+b)<br>  Multiply the second term by (a-b)/(a-b)<br>  <br>  Then they will have a common denominator of [a^(2)-b^(2)]|`|AA11526642	hint: (a-b)*(a+b) = a2 - b2<br>  make every denomenator a2 - b2 by multiplying first 2 terms by something over something :)<br>  <br>  expand back if necessary at the end.|`|gV1hnvEKaa	{3a/(a-b)}-{5b/(a+b)}-{6ab/(a^2-b^2)}<br>  <br>  {square is shown by "^"}<br>  <br>  Now solve the first two fractions:<br>  <br>  Take lcm:<br>  <br>  {{3a(a+b)-5b(a-b)}/(a^2-b^2)} - {6ab/(a^2-b^2)}<br>  <br>  {{3a^2+3ab-5ba+5b^2}/(a^2-b^2)} - {6ab/(a^2-b^2)} <br>  <br>  {{3a^2-2ab+5b^2}/(a^2-b^2)} - {6ab/(a^2-b^2)}<br>  <br>  Taking common:<br>  <br>  {3a^2-2ab+5b^2-6ab}/(a^2-b^2)<br>  <br>  {3a^2-8ab+5b^2}/(a^2-b^2)<br>  <br>  {3a^2-3ab-5ab+5b^2}/(a^2-b^2)<br>  <br>  {3a(a-b)-5b(a-b)}/(a^2-b^2)<br>  <br>  {(a^2-b^2) can be expressed as (a-b)(a+b)}<br>  <br>  {(3a-5b)(a-b)} / {(a-b)(a+b)}<br>  <br>  (a-b) gets cancelled:<br>  <br>  Therefore<br>  <br>  (3a-5b)/(a+b)<br>  <br>  This is a single fraction.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!!!!!
zYQFpJWNaa	You've asked an interesting question, but it is based on some common but fundamental misunderstandings of Special Relativity.<br>  <br>  First, relativistic time dilation would always result in time slowing, not speeding up. But that does not really undermine your question because then you could ask if the planet was spinning fast enough to throw things off of its surface, would it then NOT throw things off, since it was spinning more slowly,<br>  <br>  One of the really astonishing aspects of SR was that it proposed that there is no one special frame of reference in the universe. Every inertial frame of reference is equally valid.<br>  <br>  And so, if you are seeing a planet that is moving away from you at near-to-light-speed, well! you are also moving away from it at the very same speed. And so which planet is affected by these relativistic effects? <br>  <br>  You see? It is much more complex than is normally assumed. But what Einstein said - and what we have now experimentally established - is that in each inertial frame of reference, the laws of physics, as we know them, appear to be the same. Whether you are traveling at near to light speed relative to another planet or not.
nTKuRFlKaa	*Cavitation occurs in liquid when bubbles form and implode in pump systems or around propellers. Pumps put liquid under pressure, but if the pressure of the substance drops or its temperature increases, it begins to vaporize, just like boiling water. Yet in such a small, sensitive system, the bubbles can't escape so they implode, causing physical damage to parts of the pump or propeller.<br>  <br>  A combination of temperature and pressure constraints will result in cavitation in any system. No manufacturer or industrial technician wants to run pumps that keep getting affected by cavitation, as it will permanently damage the chambers of the device. The vaporization actually causes a loud, rocky noise because the bubbles are imploding and making the liquid move faster than the speed of sound!<br>  <br>  Inside every pump, there is a propeller that draws liquid from one side of the chamber to the other. The liquid normally continues out through a valve so it can do another job in a different part of the machine. Sometimes this device is called an impeller. Even though the total chamber stays under the same pressure, and the materials are temperature regulated, cavitation manages to occur right next to the surface of the propeller.<br>  <br>  A propeller rotates through a liquid and actually creates localized differences in pressure along the propeller blades. This can even occur underwater on a submarine or ship's propeller. The bubbles of cavitation appear in low-pressure areas but then immediately want to implode with such force that they make dings and pits in metal. A propeller exposed to cavitation resembles the surface of the moon, with tiny, scattered craters.<br>  <br>  There are two types of cavitation that can occur in the different stages of pumping, but both are results of the same phenomenon. Suction or classical cavitation occurs around the impeller as it is drawing liquid through the chamber. The propeller's motion creates the changes in pressure necessary for vaporization.<br>  <br>  Discharge or recirculation cavitation is the result of changing pressure at the point of exit, the discharge valve. The valve is not able to let all the liquid through as fast as it should, so the currents' different velocities create miniature changes in the uniform pressure. Even such small variations are enough to create the ideal circumstances for cavitation.<br>  <br>  -Suction Cavitation occurs when the Net Positive Suction Head Available to the pump is less than what is Required ------------ NPSHA < NPSHR.<br>  <br>  -Suction cavitation is often identified by a sound like gravel or marbles in the pump casing.<br>  <br>  -Discharge Cavitation occurs when the pump discharge head is too high where the pump runs at or near shutoff.<br>  <br>  Discharge cavitation in joint fluid is thought to cause the popping sound produced by bone joint cracking, for example by deliberately cracking one's knuckles.<br>  <br>  Damages:<br>      *  The cavities or bubbles will collapse when they pass into the higher regions of pressure, causing noise, vibration, and damage to many of the components.<br>      * We experience a loss in capacity.<br>      * The pump can no longer build the same head (pressure)<br>      * The pump's efficiency drops.<br>  <br>  -For powerful swimming animals like dolphins and tuna, cavitation may be detrimental, because it limits their maximum swimming speed.<br>  Even if they have the power to swim faster, dolphins may have to restrict their speed because collapsing cavitation bubbles on their tail are too painful. Cavitation also slows tuna, but for a different reason. Unlike dolphins, these fish do not feel the painful bubbles, because they have bony fins without nerve endings. Nevertheless, they cannot swim faster because the cavitation bubbles create an air film around their fins that limits their speed. Lesions have been found on tuna that are consistent with cavitation damage.<br>  <br>  Cavitation is not always a limitation for sea life; some animals have found ways to use it to their advantage when hunting prey. The pistol shrimp snaps a specialized claw to create cavitation, which can kill small fish. The mantis shrimp (type smasher) uses cavitation as well in order to stun, smash open, or kill the shellfish that it feasts upon.<br>  <br>  -It is used as a cavitation tunnel to study effects of cavitation on the propeller.<br>  -The CAV-OX process uses hydrodynamic cavitation.<br>  <br>  -Chemical engineering applications:<br>  <br>  In industry, cavitation is often used to homogenize, or mix and break down suspended particles in a colloidal liquid compound, such as paint mixtures or milk. Many industrial mixing machines are based upon this design principle. It is usually achieved through impeller design, or by forcing the mixture through an annular opening that has a narrow entrance orifice with a much larger exit orifice. In the latter case, the drastic decrease in pressure as the liquid accelerates into a larger volume induces cavitation. This method can be controlled with hydraulic devices that control inlet orifice size, allow|`|e59397a77e16f705abb35b86dee2e44eaa	For more detailed accounts of cavitation considerations in centrifugal pumping applications see Net Positive Suction Head (NPSH).

Type "NPSH" into your browsed.|`|JwPu0XbIaa	When the static pressure of a liquid drops below the vapor pressure of that liquid, some of the liquid will turn into gas and a bubble will appear.  This can happen in two different ways - static and dynamic.<br>  <br>  Static cavitation is where you have liquid inside a container (say, an airtight piston), and then you expand the volume of the container.  The liquid will cavitate to fill the container (it can't just be a vacuum) and the bubble will remain until you again shrink the volume of the container.<br>  <br>  Dynamic cavitation occurs when an object moves at high speed through a liquid.  The object could be anything from a propeller to a dolphin.  As the object travels through the water, the static pressure of the water drops on the 'retreating' side.  If the object moves fast enough, the pressure in certain regions will drop low enough to cause a cavitation bubble to appear.  The difference with dynamic cavitation is that the bubble rapidly moves into a higher-pressure area, and collapses very rapidly, producing a shock wave.  The shock wave can caused damage to to the trailing edge of the object.<br>  <br>  Dolphins, tuna, and other fast ocean creatures are limited in their top speed because cavitation will damage their skin.  Propellers can actually have metal chipped off by the collapsing cavitation bubbles.  The problem is even worse for propellers, because if it rotates fast enough, one blade can enter the cavitation bubble of the previous blade, and the propeller will then spin even faster due to to the low drag of the gas.|`|T8DThYKHaa	It is the formation of bubbles in low pressure areas of fluid, usually in pumps and impellers.<br>  <br>  Cavitation is used in ultrasonic cleaning<br>  <br>  It is also used in an over-unity heat producing device which is already on the market.

In an exothermic chemical reaction (for instance), mass is also converted to energy in the form of heat. There is no *measurable* mass loss in chemical reactions. The key is that the amount of mass that is lost in a typical chemical reaction is so incredibly, incredibly small that it can be assumed not to exist for all practical purposes.  But it is there nevertheless.<br>  <br>  Yep, I'm sure I'll get a number of thumbs down votes for this answer, but the fact remains that even if it can't be measured, mass and energy are indeed converted in chemical reactions. Even some highly educated people will tell you there is no mass to energy conversion in chemical reactions, particularly chemists. This is because they, or any other chemist for that matter, have never been able to measure it because it is vanishingly tiny. That is to say, there is no direct empirical evidence to support the notion that mass and energy are converted in chemical reactions.<br>  <br>  Put another way: ask chemists; they'll say no. Ask theoretical physicists; they'll say yes. Chemists say no because the mass difference to too small to matter. Theoretical physicists say yes because to them there is no such thing as "too small to matter".|`|c44c906eedc08fd0460017d3d9f6d98baa	Actually mass is not conserved in chemical reactions.<br>  Like nuclear reactions, in chemical reactions there is a mass defect between the products and the reactants when the is energy released or absorbed. This mass defect can be calculated using E=mc^2 just like the mass defect in nuclear reactions. In general chemical reactions deal with energies 1 million times smaller than nuclear reactions. Thus the mass defect is 1 million times smaller for chemical reactions.

I'd feel wrong in giving you the answer (though I'll gladly verify it if I think you've found it), but I can point out the more important clinical features and I'll give you a hint: there's a vaccine for it.<br>  <br>  Malaria is a very good guess as the symptoms are similar, but one of the symptoms doesn't line up: the low heart rate (bradycardia).  This is a KEY factor in the diagnosis of the disease you seek.  Also, note the time in developing symptoms, around one to two weeks.  The very high fever is the other major key.<br>  <br>  Report back!<br>  <br>  EDIT:  Even closer, coder, but I'm still thinking of something else.  There was no mention of the severe headache and body pain commonly associated with Dengue (trust me; I've had it!), so I don't know that that's it.  The potentially rapid fluctuation in body temperature worth noting as well.   Remember, the one I'm thinking of HAS a vaccine (both oral and injectable options) and has approximately four stages of disease.  I'd say the person mentioned in this question would be at the end of the second stage.  Good investigating!<br>  <br>  Second edit:  Yes!  Typhoid is what I had in mind.  Bradycardia and a plateauing high fever are very common symptoms in the second week of infection.  Beyond that is when you begin the real GI trouble.  And yes, temperature fluctuation can be associated with either malaria or typhoid (try a search on "temperature fluctuation and typhoid" and see what comes up); it's really the bradycardia that would seal the deal for me.

sNnWreZbaa	A virologist<br>  <br>  What is a Virologist and what do they do?<br>  A virologist is a specialist in the field of Microbiology. Microbiology includes the study of all microorganisms. Virology focuses on viruses. Some virologists study the composition and function of newly discovered antiviral compounds. Much of the virologist’s work done is in the laboratory. Accuracy and attention to detail is essential. Excellent record-keeping is critical.<br>  What qualifications do Virologists generally need?<br>  A solid background in life science or biochemistry is very important. Masters level programs include coursework, lab study and research. This may be a 12 month program or longer. Research specialists are likely to have completed a Ph.D. level of education. There are many places to study virology at major universities in the United States, Australia, or Great Britain.<br>  What does a Virologist cover in coursework?<br>  Most virology programs are a part of the molecular biology or medical graduate programs. Some specialize in a particular virus, or plant viruses or veterinary viruses or human viruses. A few select interdisciplinary programs include many types of viruses in their course and laboratory work, to better prepare the graduate student or physician with a broader diversity of real life situations.<br>  What type of tasks do Virologists do in their job?<br>  The Virologist performs laboratory work, tissue study, vector analysis, perhaps genome study and electron microscope work. Primary duties of a virologist are<br>  <br>  # to study growth, structure, development, and general characteristics of viruses<br>  # to isolate and make cultures of significant viruses<br>  # to identify viruses by microscopic or electron microscopic exam<br>  # to observe and monitor action of viruses on living or non-living organic materials<br>  # to perform chemical analyses of substances produced by viruses and study their effects on organic matter.<br>  What areas of specialization may Virologists choose?<br>  Viruses replicate and viruses adapt to changing environments. This characteristic is part of what makes their analysis and study so important to maintaining good public health, to improving health and to eradicating diseases such as malaria, polio, and others. This is a growing and complex field of study.<br>  <br>  A virologist may specialize in the pubic health area, or in newly emerging and rapidly adapting viruses like Ebola, or in developing viral therapies for specific diseases. Other areas of specialization include, but are not limited to: Infectious Disease, Biological Warfare, HIV, Viral Vectors & Gene Therapy, Viral Oncology and Immunology, Molecular Biology And Pathology, Veterinary Viruses, Plant Viruses, Retroviruses, Tumor Suppressing Viruses, Prion Diseases,<br>  What types of companies employ Virologists?<br>  Virologists are employed by hospitals, medical schools, medical research companies, pharmaceutical companies, governmental agencies, laboratory testing companies, or cancer treatment or research companies depending upon the specialization. <br>  <br>  salary:  There's a wide range of salary based on the type of work you do.  .  A virologist can make anywhere from 30,000 to 100,000+ dollars a year.

QPWjtDzcaa	Yes.  I won't get into the semantics of planetary system vs. solar system, as it is essentially irrelevant in your question.<br>  <br>  You want to know if there are planets orbiting other stars, right?<br>  <br>  Indeed there are:<br>  <a href="http://planetquest.jpl.nasa.gov/" rel="nofollow">http://planetquest.jpl.nasa.gov/</a><br>  We have discovered 342 planets in orbit around other stars (289 different stars, as of the last update on that NASA link I posted above, meaning some of these stars have more than one detected planet in orbit around them).  <br>  <br>  We are just in our "infancy"  ...or maybe our "toddler years" of exoplanet detection, and we just launched the Kepler mission*, which is designed to try to detect "earth-like" planets around stars.  <br>  <br>  No doubt, the number of planets orbiting stars outside of our solar system will increse steadily (perhaps even rapidly) over the years to come.  I remember when I first started answering A&S questions back in August, the count was at 318.  So we've discovered 24 more in under a year.<br>  <br>  *Kepler Mission <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler_Mission" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler_Miss...</a>|`|b1294888a8e10ac6a8ff0614d97982ccaa	Yes the majority of stars have planets revolving around them so that's an astronomical amount, pardon the pun.|`|PwHQSAxvaa	Yes!

That is a solar system.<br>  <br>  It is believed the previous estimate that 10% of stars have planets was a little conservative, the real number being much higher. With billions, or even trillions of stars in one galaxy, and billions of galaxies in the universe, there will be billions of planets. Maybe one or two somewhere support life, or could do so.

QPWjtDzcaa	With our current technology, this is not likely.<br>  <br>  Voyager I was launched in September of 1977, and is only on the "outskirts" of our solar system.  After 22 years of travel, it hasn't even it is only 109.247 AU* from the sun.  This converts into 0.0017 light years.  Not even two thousandths of a light year...  and the closets star is 4.2 light years away.<br>  <br>  At such a rate, it seems we will need a new physics or an ability to approach light speeds to be able to traverse such astronomical distances.<br>  <br>  As far as arming such a mission.  It either may or may not be a good idea.  The likelihood of running into anything that you need to attack seems very low to me, but as we are not sure how probable it actually is for life to occur somewhere, even if the conditions are perfect (the only model for this we have is earth, and possibly a very young Mars), let alone the probabilites of such life developing space travel AND visiting the same protion of our own galaxy at the same time we are (perhaps they went extinct a few centuries, or millenai ago...  perhaps they have not yet invented the wheel) I'm not sure what else it would be useful for.  Avoiding impacts in space would be easier by just by changing your momentum, rather than blowing up something in the way.|`|I8b66BvSaa	I guess so just incase there were any hostile lifeforms. Because even if there was life on the planet, this doesn't necessarily mean it would be intelligent life as we know it. <br>  <br>  For example, the planet could just be inhabited by creatures like the animals we have on our planet, dangerous ones similar to tigers and crocodiles etc. and so it would be useful and provide security to have the option of self defence should anything happen.<br>  <br>  If there were more intelligent lifeforms such as aliens which are like us or with greater intelligence, the manned flight may also need arms in case it were attacked and followed by the inhabitants, as it could be a threat to Earth if the flight caused conflict on the other planet, and that conflict was brought to Earth.<br>  <br>  Just as a security measure I think the vessel would be armed, or there would at least be some form of self defence technology available.

wJTsifugaa	This is very broad question.  Most of the pumps are probably centrifugal pumps because they can be used in a large variety of flow and pressure situations.  There are so many varieties because they are selected based on the operational demands of the application.  They take into account pressure, flow, type and temperature of the fluid being pumped, how much flow control is needed, the efficiency of the pump and what the pump operating conditions are most of the time.<br>  <br>  You also may see two other kinds of pumps.  One is called an axial or mixed flow pump, water is pumped in parallel to the pump shaft.  It is normally used in cooling water applications, where large amounts of relatively low pressure water is needed.  The other type is a positive displacement pump, or piston pump, used when a precise amount of flow is needed, normally used to feed chemicals and chemical solutions.

OfPQVR1Naa	A repeater panel is a remotely located panel which gives access to main panel controls.  It normally has only a communication cable connecting it to the main panel (RS-485 or IEEE) but allows you to see all the same information as the main panel and perform all the same functions from a remote location.<br>  <br>  It would be common to find a repeater panel placed near a reception or security area for easy access.  While the actual fire panel would be out of sight in a utility room due to the large number of wires that must be run to the actual main panel.<br>  <br>  A mimic panel means there is a graphic representation of the building and zones on the face of the main panel and indicator lights showing the status of the sensors within the graphic representation.<br>  <br>  This link is a good example:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.program.com.my/product1.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.program.com.my/product1.html</a><br>  <br>  The upper panel of the fire system on the above link is a Mimic panel while the lower panel is the actual fire panel control.  If you look closely, you can see the diagram is divided into different zones by color and there are small LED's within the zones to represent sensor status.  <br>  <br>  Mimic panels are useful for quick response to a fire since a quick glance at the panel informs the user the location of the fire.  Without a mimic panel, an user would have to either memorize the location of each sensor by slot number or read a cross-reference chart to locate the actual  fire in the event an alarm came in.<br>  <br>  For industry, many systems have digital interfaces these days which can communicate with a wide variety of HMIs.  Integrating the fire system with plant controls affords the opportunity to include fire alarm data into the pre-existing DCS system screens but reset and acknowledge controls are normally left at the main panels as a safety precaution (operators have a tendacy of acknowledging alarms without looking too closely sometimes).

This is like dropping a ball from the roof. It will continue to accelerate until it hits the ground. A projectile on the other hand (like throwing a tennis ball across the park) is only under the influence of gravity in the vertical direction. So as the tennis ball is flying across the park, it will accelerate downwards because of gravity like in free fall. But it's horizontal motion is not affected. It's horizontal speed will be the same as the speed with which you threw it(no acceleration in horizontal direction).|`|E2Wqqz0Aaa	free-falling-vertically falling eg. a ball thrown vertically down from a roof<br>  projectile- curved/ parabolic path a ball thrown horizontallyaway from a roof  which falls under gravity
Gmvldblraa	1.  I feel like saying "See number 2" which uses just the same argument.....<br>  <br>  Dropping an object, you already know that its acceleration is not affected by its mass. A great mass has a large force of gravity acting on it but at the same time that force has a great mass to accelerate and so it works out that all masses fall at the same rate.<br>  <br>  The slope of an incline is no different. The component of the  gravity force along the slope is  ( m . g . sin ? ) . This force acts on the mass and accelerates it.<br>  <br>  m . g . sin?  = m . a<br>  <br>  The m's cancel and a = g . sin ?  <br>  so we can talk about the acceleration of a sliding object on a frictionless slope without  having to know anything about the mass. But if there is any friction we will have to know the mass ( usually)<br>  <br>  2. Downward component of the gravity force must equal the engine force so that constant velocity is maintained.<br>  <br>  Downward component  = m . g . sin ?<br>  <br>  Engine force = m .a  = m . 7.36<br>  <br>  When these two are equal, the m's cancel and <br>  <br>  g . sin ? = 7.36<br>  <br>  sin ? = 7.36 / 9.81 = 0.75<br>  <br>  ? = 48.6?<br>  <br>  Thats a steep slope but its also a huge acceleration for a car.

Think of the universe in reverse until it's small enough to be completely described by quantum mechanics alone. In order for the universe to start unfolding into what we see now, our universe's specific wave function had to be brought into existence as a certain possibility out of an infinite number of other possible wave functions that had to collapse or at least decohere. At this fuzzy nanoscopic beginning, this required a 'Prime Observer' to enable this and set the expansion of the universe into motion and those initial conditions became the very facets of physical law. What we refer to as this finely tuned 'reality'. This need for an 'observer' comes from the basic quantum mechanical concept known as Shrodinger's Cat. Also, we must remember that the universe is being said to have come from nowhere which implies an act of 'creation'.<br>  This ever increasing expansion of our universe is alluded to 11 times in the Bible:<br>  Job 9:8 ; Psalm 104:2 ; Isaiah 40:22 ; Isaiah 42:5 ; Isaiah 44:24 ; Isaiah 45:12 ; Isaiah 48:13 ; Isaiah 51:13 ; Jeremiah 10:12 ; Jeremiah 51:15 ; Zechariah 12:1 <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_bang" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_bang</a><br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schrodingers_cat" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schrodinger...</a><br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_function_collapse" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_functi...</a><br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decoherence" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decoherence</a> <br>   <br>  The Bible also alludes to the ‘Big Rip’: <br>  Revelation 6:14 ; Isaiah 34:4 ; 2 Peter 3:10 <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_rip" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_rip</a>

zFsTSrOcaa	Nibiru is a fictitious member of the solar system, supposedly five times the size of earth and due to pass close enough to cause catastrophic damage on 12/21/2012. We know it's fictitious for several reasons:<br>  <br>  1. An object five times the size of earth would be visible in backyard telescopes decades before it could approach the earth. No such object has been seen despite decades of observation by millions of professional and amateur astronomers.<br>  <br>  2. Such an object would also have a large gravitational effect on nearby objects, including the rest of the outer planets, and they would not follow their predicted orbits. In fact, the planet Neptune was discovered based on errors in the predicted orbits of known planets. Since the planets are where we calculate they're supposed to be, there is no large unseen object pulling them off course.<br>  <br>  3. Believers in Nibiru change their prediction every time an old prediction proves false. Nibiru was originally predicted to appear in 2003; now it's supposed to be in 2012, so who knows what they'll be predicting in 2013?<br>  <br>  Why do they continue to insist that Nibiru is real?

I5B7lQNvaa	fossil fuels are of great importance. they provide us many forms of energy.the three main types of fossil fuels are natural gas,coal and petroleum.with the growing industrialization and urbanization the demand for these has increased and they have been put under great pressure.if we are not concious in using these fuels then they may come to an end.they are really valuable because they take millions of years to form.to conserve these we must use renewable sources of energy like solar energy,wind energy etc.|`|wBhIMxkoaa	we're gonna damage the thin mechanism on this planet and we're going to eventually die, by killing our vegetables and all living green stuff (excess CO2 kills them)<br>  so i've heard on National Geographic Channel

1f694e05c2f10550fb753aff698f0e26aa	It does appear to be a marketing name for a granitic from the Penlee Quarry in Cornwall, Probably radioactive as a school construction was delayed because it was found underneath.|`|l5O6CTzJaa	I think that "Blue Elvin" is probably a local marketing name used for a specific type of stone.  It may refer to a blue iridescence seen in some of the mineral grains in the rock.  The mineral is Labradorite - a calcium rich feldspar which is usually found in gabbro or anorthoiste.|`|lMH2cA1kaa	"Blue Elvin" certainly is not a granite name used internationally. It could be just a name given by a local supplier. If you have an image of the granite, you may try to compare it to the granite colors that have more recognized names in the industry. Website <a href="http://www.amlinkmarble.com/materials-building-granite-1.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.amlinkmarble.com/materials-bu...</a> has comprehensive list of popular granite colors.
jbNYyB3Jaa	Indeed, many salts are poisonous. One example of one that's not (I am not a doctor) is Calcium Chloride (CaCl2). You'll see that Calcium has an extra valence electron and thus ties up two chloride ions instead of one.<br>  <br>  Calcium Chloride is like a stronger, tastier, more powerful (in many ways) version of regular salt, and is what professional snow-removing-dudes (we don't have them here) use to "salt" your stuff in the snow. It's hygroscopic, its temperature increases as it melts the ice, it lowers the freezing point of water, and is all-round good for sucking up water and melting ice.<br>  <br>  You can usually find it in damp-rid-esque products.<br>  <br>  Now, Mine is a very poor answer to your question. I know that, I was just trying to give you some interesting trivia about a salt that you didn't care about. I'm nasty like that.<br>  <br>  Anyway, if you use Calcium Chloride in food, you can't just call it "salt". You have to call it by name or by E number.<br>  I am _guessing_, without having read any regulations, that you have to specifically name any salts that you put in food - except common/table salt.<br>  <br>  I think it's a pretty safe assumption to make that if a food label just says "salt" that it's sodium chloride and not some weird E-number or science experiment salt. Otherwise it'd be kind of misleading wouldn't it?<br>  <br>  <br>  (I'm guessing that you know much of this stuff already or you wouldn't be asking, but I thought I'd include all that counterexample for the benefit of searchers who come by in future wondering about salts and foods...)|`|USFXA2juaa	Many salts are poisenous, so in foods they use NaCl (sodium chloride) for flavouring, so if its for a hot source it will be NaCl, as hot sauce is a flavour full dip.
