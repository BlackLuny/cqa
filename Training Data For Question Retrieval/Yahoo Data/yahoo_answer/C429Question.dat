20090306110258AAO7NIB	Home & Garden;Decorating & Remodeling	What should I do about a rotten beam under the bathroom floor?	We are planning a project to retile the bathroom floor and walls. There is a small spot next to the bathtub where the floor has rotted through, and the beam underneath the spot has water damage on the top of the beam. The beam is not rotten all the way thru. There is plenty of access in the basement to the problem. What should I do to solve the problem before we complete the retiling project?     Add a sister beam, remove the rotten one and replace entirely? Cut out the rotten spot and sister beam?    we suspect that the leak is from behind the cover on the temperature control valve. When the water runs down the wall, it goes behind the cover and leaks through the wall onto the beam. Shouldn't the plumber who put in the temperature control have put some silicone caulk between the cover and the tile wall to prevent this?

I got it home and thought to myself "I wonder if this stuff works for Spiders as well." I can't find it on the back of the list but it says it kills up to 60 different kinds of bugs.. I don't know if they are just not listed or what.. But do you know if it generally takes care of spiders as well or will that have to be solved seperately?

For the past 3 days I have noticed (and killed) 4 big flies, almost half an inch in length with a wide wing span.  My housemate told me he also found one in his bedroom yesterday.      This evening I have just killed yet another one!! They are quite slow in flight, but are obviously adult flies, they are not fast like bluebottles, nor do their wings buzz when they fly about.  I have kept my bedroom door shut, I have kept the window shut - so just where are they coming from? I thought that flies don't nest (as such), I thought they came from larve, yet my housemate's partner says that they can take refuge in an attic or loft space (the hatch is slightly open) - is this true?????      What do I do about it???

It looks like this: ((  ))      It almost seems like it's a lens in the window.  Is there a term for it? Does it serve any purpose or is it just some kind of historical window decoration?

Project 2 opened at the same location in 1956 providing an additional thirty-two cottages.      The entire project 1 & 2 property - 2 large city blocks in length - was redeveloped in 1994-96.

20090307123309AAJlPf2	Home & Garden;Garden & Landscape	Ooohhh, I have a good one.  Recently it was reported that two men in Georgia had found a dead "Big Foot"?	while they were out hunting and had brought it back and froze it in a deep freezer.  Watch the video tape.  Then it was reported that it was a hoax and a video showing some investigators unthawing the "Yetti" and showing the public that it was a pigs mid body with some plastic feet, hands, and head.  Now, pull this up, if you watch the first video compared the debunking video, look closely because it is really easy to tell the contents of the two videos apart.  The debunking video was the "fraud", Check it out and let me know your opinion?

20090307144621AAhMpGx	Home & Garden;Decorating & Remodeling	Colors for a small, darker bedroom?	Right now my room is a light-ish blue on all the walls, the trimming and ceiling are white, and I find the room cold, boring and sort of childish ( Since a lot of kids rooms are blue)       My room is sort of small, and has a lot of smaller walls. the ceiling is normal height, it slants over a third or so of the room which is actually really cool.       I wanted to paint the room redish, then have the trimming white and have black sheets and furniture. My parents told m not to do this because they said dark colors would make my room feel really, really tiny.       I want my room to not fel childish or crazy. I want colors to give me more energy, and more motivated to study etc. That's why I picked red.       Any tips or anything on what I should paint the room would be really helpful. Thanks :D
