I have a gas combination boiler and normally I have hot water from my shower and taps straight away.       However recently, if I use the shower (or taps) the water will run hot for a few minutes, then run with cold water for around 5 minutes before it returns to hot water for another 5 minutes. Does anyone have any idea was is wrong? Would it have any thing to do with the water pressure?    And most importantly will it cost a lot of money to call a plumber in to fix it?

I don't know much about growing beans, but I'm supposed to design a method of farming to favour the production of larger kidney bean seeds (over a period of time, rather than one particular crop).  I don't know how farmers "replant" their bean crops (ie. do they replant half the bean seeds, or just let some plants drop their seeds without picking them?).  I thought they would just plant the larger seeds from the previous crop, but also thought farmers might want to sell the larger beans?  Any help is appreciated!
