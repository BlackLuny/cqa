The following is an excerpt from Lucent  Technologies Managements Discussion and  Analysis of Financial Condition and Results  of Operations:  Executive Summary  We design and deliver the systems, software  and services that drive next-generation communications  networks. Backed by Bell Labs  research and development, we use our  strengths in mobility, optical, access, data and  voice networking technologies, as well as  services, to create new revenue-generating  opportunities for our customers, while  enabling them to quickly deploy and better  manage their networks. Our customer base  includes communications service providers,  governments and enterprises worldwide.  We have three segments organized  around the products and services we sell.  The reportable segments are Integrated Network  Solutions (INS), Mobility Solutions  (Mobility) and Lucent Worldwide Services  (Services). INS provides a broad range  of software and wireline equipment related  to voice networking (primarily consisting  of switching products, which we sometimes  refer to as convergence solutions, and voice  messaging products), data and network  management (primarily consisting of access  and related data networking equipment  and operating support software) and optical  networking. Mobility provides software and  wireless equipment to support radio access  and core networks. Services provides deployment,  maintenance, professional and managed  services in support of both our product  offerings as well as multi-vendor networks.  Beginning in fiscal 2001, the global  telecommunications market deteriorated,  resulting from a decrease in the competitive  local exchange carrier market and a significant  reduction in capital spending by established  service providers.This trend intensified  during fiscal 2002 and continued into fiscal  2003. Reasons for the market deterioration  included general economic slowdown, network  overcapacity, customer bankruptcies,  network build-out delays and limited availability  of capital.  We believe that the market for telecommunications  equipment has stabilized  and is starting to grow in certain areas. The  growing demands of enterprises and consumers  for additional services tailored to  their needs is creating the need for a new  convergence of networks, technologies and  applications.  Required  1. Using the Consolidated Balance  Sheets for Lucent Technologies for  September 30, 2004 and 2003, prepare  a common-size balance sheet.  2. Evaluate the asset, debt, and equity  structure of Lucent Technologies, as  well as trends and changes found on  the common-size balance sheet.  3. What concerns would investors and  creditors have based on only this  information?  4. What additional financial and nonfinancial  information would investors  and creditors need to make investing  and lending decisions for Lucent  Technologies?

I shipped it out Jan 20th, it is now the 31th and the item still hasn't been delivered. Every time I track it, it shows the same message:      "Processed      Your item was processed and left our NORTH HOUSTON, TX 77315 facility on January 22, 2009. Information, if available, is updated every evening. Please check again later."      It's been like this for the past week. Today the buyer contacted me to make sure I had shipped it to the correct address. I verified it, and everything was correct. What can be taking so long and what actions should I and the buyer take? I have never had any problems with shipping so I really don't know how to handle this. Please, any help will be appreciated.

First of all, I'm the copywriter, but don't let that hold you back on the criticism.      Anyway, to the problem. A new range of shampoos. Lots of natural ingredients. Lots of different products. Lots of different benefits. And we need a slogan to cover the range before going into the specifics.      That's the brief.       I'd considered a few options, and each has a problem.      1) "10 natural ingredients to enhance the beauty of your hair"   (I think "enhance" is too clinical and business-like. Opinions?)      2) "10 natural ingredients to increase the beauty of your hair"   (Same problem as “enhance”)      3) "10 natural ingredients to add to the beauty of your hair"   (Slightly better, if only because if “add” isn’t very exciting, at least it isn’t clinical)      4) "10 natural ingredients to make your hair more beautiful"   (Too simple?)      5) “10 natural ingredients to bring out all the beauty in your hair”   (I like this one, but is it too much?)      Voilà. There is my problem.   Feel free to say they’re all bad. But you have to propose a better one instead.   Thanks, best wishes and two points to all happy helpers.

I am in a very bad situation. I just finished the pharmacy tech program at PIMA medical institue in Dec. 08. When I did my externship at Walgreens, they hired someone who did not even have any pharmacy experience at all, while I was in awe thinking, Hello Hire me, the aspiring pharmacy technician!!!! It can't be that they don't want to train new people, because the guy was brand new and had to be trained on everything just like I did. It is so unfair. I am now in debt to PIMA for $7500. I just took the PTCB exam and passed, thinking it would be easier to find a job. I have put in resumes online to bartell's and a few other places but I never get called back. I even try to look online but in the Seattle area, there doesn't appear to be any retail pharmacy tech openings, the only jobs I ever see advertised are Hospital. It's like there are no jobs in retail. I want to start off in retail pharmacy and move up to hospital. I have to get experience first but I can't even find a job with certification and having completed formal training. Now I feel like I wasted my time going to school and my money and I blame myself, not the school. I feel like I made a bad career decision. Any tips out there to get a retail pharmacy tech job?

I filed for the 8 to 15 day rapid refund through HR Block...so they sent it in E-File.       What are the exact steps that will take place for this error to be corrected? I know the IRS will likely review it and compare it to my stimulus check amount of $600, and see something wrong. They'll probably pull it aside for review. Will they call my tax preparer at HR Block and have her re-submit everything via E-File again, with a corrected version that states $600? Or will the IRS themselves just change the $300 to say the appropriate $600?      How long could this delay my refund?

I got IRS notice CP21B notice in 1/09, stating although they were unable to issue my rebate by 12/08, I could possible file for it on my 2008 taxes. OK, I did. The notice also states my 2007 refund will be sent to me soon.  It is Feb and I have not received it. My question is for anyone who got a similar notice - did you ever receive the refund?? My refund is $4k.      Side note: Ex claimed kids and me without my W2's on his 2007 taxes fraudulently and got huge refund and the rebate. I had to send leases, kids report cards, neighbor stmts about my residence and that kids were with me 100% of the time to the IRS. I assumed because the IRS is now showing my 2007 refund amount as a positive in my "account" that they had found me the one eligible for the EIC, CTC, etc and were finally sending me the refund I am entitled to.       IRS gurus - any input? Tks!

20090226063651AAnlQ95	Business & Finance;Taxes;United States	What Has The IRS Said About Delay Code 1201?	Since becoming self-employed four years ago, our refund is always delayed a number of weeks with the 1201 code as a reason. The first year it happened, we called and were told that the delay was because we filed a joint return, but I'd paid the estimated tax payments using just my social security number. So I switched to both SS numbers for the next year and again a delay. This time the agent said it was because we'd paid the estimated taxes under both SS instead of just mine.      So last year, I paid the estimated taxes under my SS again and again was delayed. I called and they said the delay was still about our filing a joint return but my paying estimated taxes and that I should be paying them using my husband's SS. I wasn't about to do that because they the income goes to him and my income would show up as a bit fat zero. I called back and got a different answer about paying them using both SS numbers.      We did that again and sure enough this year our refund is delayed again. This time, I've been told it is a problem between the efile software we used and the IRS system.      I'd love to see a flat rate charged for taxes and the elimination of filing taxes every year!      How about you?

Last Friday night ,Homeland (The grocery store) called me and asked me if i can come for the interview on Monday 2/2/09, so i was very excited since nobody was calling me for a job.   The next day I get a phone call from Target , and they also ask me to come for an interview on Wednesday 2/4/09, so I was sooooo excited.   The homeland job is from 5:00 pm to 11:00 pm ( 3 days a week)   The Target job is from 3:30 am to 11:00 am (4 days a week)   Do you think i can handle 2 jobs at the same time?

20090131195241AA5Du7U	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	Do we have to use 1003 Loan Application when we purchase residential house?	Hi    Year 2006 I purchased house ($625K). I hired mortgage broker and he applied loan for me. BB&T was my lender and loan was approved in 20 days. I put $125K for deposit and got $500K loan. Last year one of my friend told me that BB&T is not a wholesale lender. There must be a loan officer. I was wondering because from the begging to the end I was contacted by my mortgage broker. He was acting like BB&T was a wholesale lender.    I requested full documents from the lender and I reviewed it. When I saw Loan Application I was confused because it was not 1003 Loan Application. It was Bank’s Retail Loan application. I am not sure but I think that retail loan application is for personnel loan, student loan, or home equity loan etc NOT FOR RESIDENTIAL PURCHASE LOAN… * I said I am not sure.   And my loan is-5 years Installment loan- That means I pay $3400 for 59 months and 60th I have to pay about $400K. On settlement day I was out of town and mortgage broker told me that my father could sign the settlement documents if I give him on authorization (Power of attorney). So we did. I believe my father didn’t know what he was signing.   Q.1 They (Lender) don’t have to use 1003 when we apply for residential home loan?   2. Is there any violation that I was not contacted by Bank’s Loan Officer or others from Bank?   3. What do you think about my loan program?   4. Refinancing is my best solution?      P.S. When I applied loan, mortgage broker got all my information on blank paper. He said “I will fill loan application out for you”.   I called mortgage broker….NO ANSWER   Heard rumor that he went to jail.      Thanks.

20090131200021AAzdeJz	Business & Finance;Taxes;United States	Can I un-file and re-do my state taxes?	I made a HUGE mistake. I used Turbo Tax Freedom recommended by the IRS website to file my taxes a few weeks ago. I didn't think anything of it and I got back alot of Federal and barely any State. I've already received my money via direct deposit, but haven't spent any of it yet.       Well fast forward to tonight when my fiance asked me to do his taxes. I got a coupon in the mail for H&R Block Tax Cut so I did his with that. He makes alot less than me in a year and he got around the same amount back in Federal but a WHOLE LOT more in State. Like 707.00 more. I couldn't believe it.       I went to the H&R block site just to see what I would have gotten had I used them instead of Turbo Tax. Well...the different in State is almost 800.00. I only received 16.00 through TT but I would get 780.00 through H&R Block. I can't call the IRS until tomorrow and Google is giving me nothing.       Is there anything I can do? I want to forfeit the money I received already and just redo my STATES taxes all together. Is that possible?

20090131201509AAicqDg	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	Is a co-borrower responsible for half of the mortgage of a home if they were not living there?	My ex and I bought a house together. 2 years ago he broke it off and moved out. I am still living in the home and have made all the mortgage payments. Today I recieved a letter in the mail from an Attorney at Law stating that he wants me to refinance the home ( or sell) to get his name off of the title and mortgage. If I dont he will initiate a Partition action and force me to sell the home or refinance and that if I sell (we) will share the proceeds or shortfall. My question is he responsible for the 2 years of payments he did not pay on the mortgage? Just because we broke up does not mean that he can just leave and leave the responsiblilty of the loan behind. Also if I do refinance does he have to pay the closing costs and lawyer fees for the refinance because he is the one who wants it done?

He has no dependents & the only ?	financial obligation he has are student loans.  Does buying a house with all it entails (maintenance, insurance, possibly renting out part of it, taxes, tax-breaks) make sense for him?  Or is he better off just taking the single deduction & not entangling with all these things plus the itemization (where the total has to be more than the standard deduction to make this effort worthwhile)?  thank you

I want to be as honest as I can with any potential employer. What I write on the application is what they will get if they employ me. I am 16, and at the moment is difficult to say that I could work week nights because I am still at school and you know homework can be piled on unexpectedly therefore I couldn't guarantee what nights I could work and which ones I couldn't. Either school work or the job would have to be neglected.      Should I be honest and say I am pretty much restricted to Friday nights, Saturday and Sunday, or not say a thing and see if they are willing to employ me? In my opinion it is pointless even going as far as getting an interview if I cannot work the hours they want.      Btw, I do not know what hours they are looking for. I only asked if they are recruiting and was told I'd have to fill out an application.

A friend (I know, yeah "A friend" riiight....) asked me this and I thought I'd see if the Yahoo community agrees with me or not.  It might make interesting discussion.      He is  finally at the point where he has have an extra $1000 a month.  Should he now tackle his $12,000 in credit card debt OR buy precious metal?      I told him that I used to think "GET OUT OF DEBT, PAY OFF THOSE CARDS NOW!!!"  However, I now think inflation is going to go crazy, making those balances seem trivial.  And hell, we may even see a bailout on credit card debt before this is all over.  I think he should make the minimums on the credit cards and stock up on gold.  I didn't mention it to him, because I am just now thinking about it, but he may even want to just stash some cash too in case he is one of the coming layoffs.  But would stashing cash be wise, or are we back to stashing precious metal since cash may become of less value.      Thoughts? Disagree with me or agree?  Let's hear it!!!

I am EXCELLENT at everything I do.  I will do anything asked, have no problems understanding, reasoning, enforcing, training, researching, inventing, and most importantly getting my work completed.  I am loyal and discreet and very personable to the rest of the team or office, and especially to the customers or clients.  I dress professionally and have a pretty face.  I feel like the problem is that even though I excel in the most desired capacities, I do not have a college diploma.  Its very unfair to have my resume tossed for this reason.  My grades in elementary school stayed on a college level...I do not understand this new trend, though.  I just want to advise employers, as an ex-manager myself...maybe there is hidden potential where you least expect.  Judging from the customer service and information I recieve from companies nowadays, I would suggest going back to the old school way of meeting in person and "gut instinct"; not paper and a clever resume.  Anyone agree or disagree?
