Xm5ab6F6aa	I looked at the pictures and the doll is from the late 40's and she is called a mama doll because of the crier. The head is not celluloid but hard plastic. Hard plastic was first made for dolls starting in 1947 on, before that they were made out of composition.    I find sometimes people do not remember the exact year they recieved the toys, you have to deal with the type of materails used.    Lift up the hair on the back of the neck and see if there are any marks, hopefully for you it will say Alexander because then she could be baby genius . The hat is a very typical 40's hat worn by children. THe shoes look original and the dress is a good copy if its not tagged. The way you tell if the dress is what we call factory, look at the way the snaps are sewn on, if they are neatly sewn top to side and bottom to side. It has a very neat look. Some dresses have the machine button holes also used in the 40's. Look for a factory tag on the inside of the dress as well and or at the back.    Several factories did make these dolls, Ideal, Horseman, American Character, Effanbee too. If I Can be of more help let me know, thanks    I went and looked in my American Character book and look to see if shes marked American Character if so she will be Baby Sue

p7w5p7pVaa	Poker is played with a standard deck of 52 playing cards (except for Ross Perot Poker, which is played with less than a full deck). The cards are ranked from high to low in the following order: Ace, King, Queen, Jack, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2. Aces are ALWAYS high. Aces are worth more than Kings which are worth more than Queens which are worth more than Jack, and so on. The cards are also separated into four suits. The suits are:        * Clubs:      * Spades:      * Hearts:      * Diamonds:    But you already knew that from playing Go Fish, right? The suits are all of equal value, meaning that no suit is more valuable than another. It's a very democratic game.    Each player is dealt five cards. The object of the game is to end up with the highest-valued hand. From best to worst, hands are ranked in the following order:    Royal Flush  Straight Flush  Four of a Kind  Full House  Flush  Straight  Three of a Kind  Two Pair  One Pair  High Card    Royal Flush    This is the most valuable hand in all of poker. A Royal Flush is composed of 10, Jack, Queen, King and Ace, all of the same suit. It's the toughest hand to get.|`|LItIiiHKaa	There are hundreds of books on this so there's no way anyone will teach you much on a forum like this.  Do a search for basic poker lessons which will get you started.    Free Online Poker Tips and Strategy  http://kingcobrapoker.com|`|ub2KwjcQaa	First you need to know that there is no game called 'poker'.    Just like there is no sport called 'the olympics'.    You don't win the olympics, you win for the specific event that falls under that umbrella term.    'Poker' is an umbrella term. There are various games played that fall under that term: texas hold 'em, 5-card draw, 7-card stud...    The constant is that the hands all follow the same rankings.    So for starters, you need to familiarize yourself with the rankings of poker hands. (click the wiki link below)    Then you need to learn the specific rules of which game you would like to learn (how many cards are dealt, betting...)    I'm assuming that you are referring to texas hold 'em, because that seems to be all that is played these days, thanks to televised events.    So learn: betting strategies, pot odds, position plays... the best place place to learn these is on some free online site (you will also learn the hands and the rankings the more you play). However there is still the big variable of the psychology involved in playing poker (body language of your opponents, your own body language, facial/eye expressions...) and to learn that, you need to participate in live games. (in my experience, I've found that people who wear sunglasses at games are just morons, they are nowhere as good at reading body language as they believe that they are, but it makes them feel important, however, they could also be donning glasses as a type of intimidation effect or defensive strategy, "I might not be able to read your eye expressions, but I'm sure as hell not going to let you attempt to read mine", hence the psychology of that lame tactic)      Find some friends who are at a beginning level like you are, and take your time and play.    When I was in high-school, I had a job as a busboy at a local restaurant. I would bust my butt and get home to find that my older brother would have some friends over, and they would be playing cards. For almost my entire sophomore year, I pretty much donated all of my tips to my brother and his friends. I know that they were happy to see me come home from work with cash on hand. by the end of my senior year, I had become one of the best card players in our little group.    We rarely played texas hold 'em because we preferred cash games (not tournament style, where everybody puts in the same amount of money and payouts go to 1st place, 2nd place...). We played a lot of 5 card stud, 7 card stud, 5- card draw, all of the various other games that go by different names.    I saw my time playing with them sophomore year as my schooling, and for that I paid.    I more than enough received all of that money back by the time we all graduated.|`|t6CKMIznaa	I'm not sure what style you are talking bout it, but mysite covers the most common ones  http://how2poker.info/|`|oK2sp9W7aa	That is a pretty open question I am afraid.  Thee are many forms of poker:    Texas Holdem  Omaha  Omaha Hi/Lo  7 Card Stud  Razz  H.O.R.S.E.  and many more.      I would start with a basic understanding of which ever game you choose then learn the poker hand rankings so you will know what hand beats what.    Then practice!

u6JODBodaa	yes you can get rid of your memory stick, just back up your files and format it, then you can put all your games in it.|`|AQ9JxT5xaa	So, you have an 8gb magic memory stick, and want to transfer everything to a regular memory stick?  Then the answer is no, you still need the magic memory stick to hold your downloaded ISO/CSO games and apps since there is no file to hold that content on a regular memory stick.  And also, a regular memory stick isn't able to hold any hacked games or programs.  It can only hold movies, pics, music, and game save data.  If you wanted to buy a 16 gb memory stick to transfer everything to that, you could always just make the 16gb a magic memory stick also.

Ask them about it)  Metal Gear Solid 1,2,and 3 (Also in a bundle at Gamestop)    regular xbox:  Fable (a really good rpg where you can do anything you want.  Kind of like a gta in medieval times)  Halo 1 and 2 (really the only reason why you own an original xbox)    psp: God of War:Chains of Olympus (Very good hack-and-slash action game.  Probably the best for the psp)  Final Fantasy 7:Crisis Core (Has a nice mix of rpg and action in it.  Second best for psp)    These games are purely my opinion for what is best for those best "action" systems.  The reason why nintendo ds, nintendo 64, and wii aren't up there is because:    Nintendo DS kinda sucks when it comes to action games.  I know because I own one.  Wii:  I dunno.  I own one, but now that I have an xbox 360, I play that way more often.  The Wii just lost it's luster, literally, cuz the graphics suck.

mvHixMyaaa	Well it depends.    For example I feel training woodcutting is useless if I dont train fletching as well so I fancy woodcutting maples and cutting them into maple longbows, for exp. If fletching just isn't your thing then I would recommend cutting willows near the Barbarian Assault minigame. To get there use a Games Necklace and click Barbarian Assault. Also there is an actual deposit box in the Barbarian Assault building that you can deposit your willows.|`|XJlD2kPsaa	K, i suggest going to maples to cut unless your going to burn your logs cause like willows will almost never sell unless you sell them for less than theyre worth. So unless your burning or fletching your logs go to maples. But yes willows are definetly faster experience and if your free go to maybe draynor unless your burning the willows, if your burning them in free then go to lummy to cut and if your cutting willows in member cut in catherby and for maples cut them in seers :D good luck with your lvl 70 wc|`|pKlKJR4qaa	Willows in draynor village, you can bank at draynor bank.|`|VkvJJUtxaa	cut willow but if u wanna make money at the same time i say maples cus people buy that more then willow|`|pLMrvOOMaa	There is a fact which is that with each level you cut faster and that from lvl 44 to 45 the willow wc speed increases, but from 51 to 52 the willow wc speed is the same while the maple wc speed increase. In certain point the maple point speed will surpass the willow's but i assure you that at maple's peak speed XP is faster than willow's. I didn't mark maple's peak speed but at 66 ( 72 with rune axe) it was already peaked. so at 66(maybe lower) maples are faster  I got this results from my experience notes, every level i took the random timeouts (which are always the same) and in 52 they were the same as 51s.  so at lvl 66 jump to maple's,  PS:I took that notes to abolish people hypothesis that there is no need to wait to advance from xp source.  PSS: there is no such thing as XP/Speed n=lvl logarithm|`|yVAzOBARaa	i would advise cutting maples using the reward from the seers village acheivment diary, which gives a huge EXP bonus over time.|`|3f573edfebb558b3d5840168b36252edaa	Wrong, wrong, wrong. Countless times I've seen players in the Tip It Forums or RSOF recommending the terrible for cash and terrible for XP willows to train on. Countless times I've told them not to listen and they instead insulted my knowledge of the game and deliberately ignored my recommendation. Now, I don't blame you if you choose not to, but keep that to yourself and realize that you're the one with the loss. Why? Because teaks - not willows, not maples, not yews - are the best XP in the game. Why?     The XP rates for teaks are simply faster than willows. You say, of course they are but you can't bank! Right? Wrong. You can. However, you don't need to. There is a lag built into Woodcutting (I know this sounds like a hack, but proof is found later) that you can use to drop a log. This way, you can woodcut forever without banking. The max XP with this method is over 70k an hour. This is a whopping 20k XP more than willows give.     Now you will argue, still, what if I don't want to do that? Well, here's the answer: parcel service. The parcel service, for the cost of some trading sticks, will bank your logs. And guess what, they're right next to the teak trees. Too good to be true? No, only too good to be believed.     If you need proof, look at my friends guide to woodcutting. We've both tried these methods and know they work:  http://forum.tip.it/viewtopic.php?f=103&...|`|Ou48c0I1aa	Willows, definatley faster XP|`|SzSYk1fSaa	Willow Trees are best because it sells more get more xp from it and it's easy to find ( Near Water)|`|d9dYCU1oaa	yea i agree... either willow or maple!|`|mRAOhAwcaa	I recommend that you stick with willow trees. As you have said that you are a member I also recommend buying a dragon axe, however if you don't have the money for it, don't worry, rune will work fine. I myself have 72 woodcutting and found that willows gave me much better xp than maples when I was a member, especially since I had a dragon axe.|`|KQ9Uua09aa	Willows are definitely the best experience until 90, then yews are better. Cut willows at draynor village bank if you wanna bank them, or lumbridge if you don't care about money and just wanna sell to the general store. they are horrible money though.    if you want good money and moderate exp then cut yews west of catherby, there's like 8 yews there and they never run out.|`|e5981a592b6fe7cbc15da7f992be57ebaa	I would say willows, because you can cut them faster. Even though 1 maple is better experience than 1 willow, using a ratio will show you cutting willows are better if you want to level up faster.

PS3 is a better made system.  No paying $50 for online use which you'd have to pay for use of online on the Xbox 360 but the PS3 is free!

But for the price that the PS3 costs,it's well worth the money and less of a headache wondering why your Xbox 360 games don't work or you get the rrod.

l6lh6fT8aa	For $20, you can build a decent deck on a budget. I've built many decks on a tight budget, and as of right now, the most effective (Standard) budget decks I have are a blue/white control deck...and, surprisingly, Goblins.     Goblins doesn't need many rares to work - Shared Animosity and Mad Auntie will do the trick, along with other cheap (manawise and moneywise) Goblins can often take out a person before they can mount a reasonable defense.    The blue/white control deck is focused mostly on drawing cards and gaining a little life while defending itself with small creatures, and then overpowering the opponent with tokens from Hoofprints of the Stag. The key cards in the deck are Mulldrifter, Deft Duelist, Hoofprints of the Stag, Kiss of the Amesha, and Ponder.|`|8M7b1PAHaa	It's going to be hard to get some rares for a tourney to build a deck that can win. I think your best bet is to do a $10-$15 booster draft or sealed deck tournament, where each player starts with a few randoms packs and builds a deck right there. Frankly, for $20 you probably won't even be able to get the commons/uncommons you need to fill your Standard legal deck, much less the rares.    I pay $35 to get every common/uncommon from a base set (Alara) on ebay, then buy the rares I need individually. It's not $20, but it's still cheaper.

I'm not sure on the newer ones, but I don't believe you can skip anything.     If you wanna get a friend a game with little to no cutscenes, try Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles. It's more the Zelda type, but it holds some form of RPG strategy in it.|`|zvCEoByNaa	I think you press the button A a lot or start.|`|NJ25E4AZaa	why would you not like the cutscenes? the story to final fantasy is absolutly amazing, and you really are clueless as to what to do in much of the game if you do skip them|`|L5WnbqvVaa	You definitely use the start button, but I agree with the post above me.

AA12339451	Materials Needed:      Crayons   Candle Wicks   2 Pint Milk Carton   Ice     Instructions:  Candlemaking can be both fun and dangerous. You should never try any projects that use heat and fire without an adults help, and always follow candle safety rules.    Cut off the top of the milk carton so that you have a "box" with one end open. Next, Melt crayons over medium heat (there are plastic bags available that you can place the wax or crayons in so that you then just place that bag into boiling water to melt). The crayons can be broken and different colors, but the washable type do NOT work well. You can use the wax for candle crafts found at the discount stores and add just a few crayons of the desired color to tint it. Place wick into the milk carton and fill carton will ice. Be sure that the wick is fairly centered and running the entire length of the carton. Now, pour melted wax/crayon mixture into the carton filling to the top. Let sit until hardened and ice has melted, then carefully cut and peel away the carton from the candle.    You will now have a beautiful candle. The ice in the carton caused the wax to quickly harden around the cubes. The result is a "swiss cheese" looking candle. Each one looks a little different! These must be handled carefully after finished as the swiss cheese nature of the candle make it fragile.    Helpful Hints from Diane in Arizona: I have done this candle project. It is fun. I have two hints: One, make sure the ice is crushed well - too large and your candle will not stay together; and two, use a taper candle in place of the candle wick. Taper candles are far easier to acquire than the wicks if you don't have a good craft shop nearby.

QFsiVQz6aa	I'm not certain but I believe those are the Postman's hat, Bomb mask, and the All-Night Mask. It's been a looooooooooooooooong time since I've played that game so I'll do my best to answer these for you.    Bomb mask is the easiest. At 1am on your first night in clock town go to North Clock Town and wait for the little old lady from the bomb shop to stroll through (get there a little early so you don't miss it). The thief from Ikana comes in and steals her bag so chase after him and then slash him with your sword. He'll drop the bag and your reward is the bomb mask.    The All-Night mask is pretty simple too. Go to the store in West Clock Town that sells weird stuff and is run by the fisherman in OoT (I can't remember what the shop is called but I'm sure you know which one I'm talking about...Kafei is hiding there and it's only open at night). You can buy the mask for 500 rupees but I think it's a conditional event depending on if you've gotten the bomb mask or not. I know it can only be purchased on the 3rd night but if it's during a cycle that you stop the thief from robbing the old lady it might not be offered or vice versa. I don't remember...sorry.    The Postman's hat was pretty tricky if I recall. I think you have to go through all that stuff with Kafei and Anju and then on the 3rd night go into the Post Office to find the postman freaking out and he'll give you his hat. I could be wrong, and maybe all you have to do is just go in there after midnight on the third night and he'll give it to you. I know this wasn't very helpful but it was something like that...sorry, I'm just rusty.|`|lN26Bk7Eaa	nerrrd!

To clarify some of the other posts here, when you get a pawn to the end of the board you can PROMOTE it to another piece.  It doesn't matter if you lost any pieces yet or not, you can promote it to anything other than another king.
3J5Oyu52aa	Every amusement park runs their own promotions that's why.  I think this is very clever of Disney. Most people traveling to  Disney are from out of state. These people buy the multi-day  park tickets. The longer you stay at Disney the cheaper it  gets. (Park tickets longer than 5 days is only a few extra  dollars per day). If you live near Disney and only go for the  day...your birthday; you will not go by yourself! You will bring  a friend or two.

AA10153982	Swaps are a great way to get people talking. Have a fabric exchange, where everyone brings a pre-determined amount of fabric (fat quarters, for example) and puts them on a display table. Make sure it's accessible to everyone for viewing. If you have a very large group where it would be too crowded for everyone to stand around, you could draw numbers to determine the order. They can always bring more than one fat quarter - they just get to take as many as they bring.     You could have a "getting to know you" reception at the beginning of the meeting. Have everyone bring a dessert or appetizer to pass and give them the task of introducing themselves to at least three people they don't know.     You could play icebreaker games. For example, everyone who comes in gets a quilt square pinned to her back (paper or fabric) and they have to ask yes/no questions of the people around them to figure out what it looks like. Or put them together in teams of six or eight (assigning them so they aren't with people they already know) and give them some sort of team task. Maybe give them pre-cut pieces of colored paper in square, rectangle and triangle shapes, and give them five minutes to design a block (maybe on a wall, using blue painter's tape). You could assign them to their teams and before giving them the task, have a few minutes for "getting to know you" conversation - everyone introduce themselves and say one thing that is surprising about themselves.|`|7u8QpwEFaa	well our guild always has a show and tell at the end, and also we have a meet and greet an hour before the meeting so people can get to know each other. we also have a fat quarter box that people can win fat quarters from .we have a block of the month. the people with a birthday that month bring some kind of food to snack on.sometimes its food like meatballs other times its cookies and cake you never know whats going to be there.im 30 and the youngest one in my guild, i've been in a little over a year.and know a good portion of the people.sometimes you got to be the one to speak out .a lot of people are shy.i hope this helps you    j from sc|`|Ft0XWwXvaa	I find that Show and Tell is a great way to give and receive comments.  Have each member bring something in that they made and show it to all and talk about it.|`|6N3yjlXhaa	What are you getting out of this?    Although it should be the guild officer's responsibility to get the clique out of the membership, you sometimes have to meet people half-way.    Ask them to help you with a certain block, whether you already know how, or not.    If your efforts do not work out - tell the president of the guild that you are quitting and why.    You will probably feel better when you are on your own.

riAQWO2caa	I would probably go for the Seasons pack first because you have to install the packs in order for them to work...unless you only want the one pack.You get many more options and objects in Seasons than in Bon Voyage. In Seasons, you can go fishing, choose more clothes for different seasons, meet weird penguins, enjoy watching your pets eat the snow, try to dodge burning trees and much more!   In Bon Voyage, you have the option of making your Sims have holidays in three different destinations and have a magority of new piercings and clothes.  All in all, it's your choice but I do strongly recommend Seasons because of all the new things that you can experiment with, though Bon Voyage is fun too.|`|sWKGUPziaa	I would get Season before Bon Voyage. It adds weather and alot more to your game than Bon Voyage does. Bon Voyage is really only seen when you go on vacation.  With Seasons it snows, rains; etc. You can have a garden and harvest vegetables. You can join the Garden Club and even get more clothing for the changing Seasons! Seasons is my favorite expansion pack and is probably the best thing they could've added to the Sims series! Awesome! :)|`|M8lpNKcFaa	bon voyage|`|236ec04bbd4131ca8c28403df2b8717caa	Can't say anything about Seasons sincen I don't have it yet, but I love Bon Voyage.

(i havnt been attacked a 2nd time)  but there is a regulator HQ that you can go to (and cause mass death)  the thing is u might now be able to get inside if you dont have the regulator perk (only to good karma). but the HQ is in the middle of the east side (right hand side) of the map.  hope this furthers your quest off killing all in your path
AA11084698	To downgrade your PSP to custom firmware you must    1) First format your memory stick (Whether your PSP is a slim or a fat).  [Warning: Formatting your Memory stick will delete EVERYTHING on the Memory stick. I recommend that you backup all of your files by copying them to your computer. You can put everything back later]        a. To format your memory stick, just plug your PSP into the computer using the USB cable.      b. Click My Computer      c. Right-click your PSP. (On the computer, you will see it as a removable disk. On my computer, its called Removable Disk (H:) However, yours may be different)      d. Scroll down and click format      e. Make sure you select : File system: FAT32      f. Click Format.  2) Now your memory stick should be cleared of all its files.      a. Keeping your PSP plugged into the computer, Click my Computer.      b. Open to your PSP. (Now you should see nothing, since you formatted it.)      c. Now, create a new folder and name it PSP. [Without the quotes and all capital letters]      d. Now double click PSP and create a new folder inside of PSP. Name it GAME [Without the quote and all capital letters. It is GAME. Do not name it GAMES. There is no S.]      e. Now download this file:    http://rapidshare.com/files/96630083/pan...    To extract this file, you will need a program like WinRAR. If you dont already have it, download it from     http://www.rarlab.com/download.htm        f. Now once you downloaded it, Extract the folder onto the desktop. The folder is called PAN3XX_R3.      g. Once you have the folder, move this folder into the GAME Folder you created a few minutes ago.      h. Now download this file:    http://rapidshare.com/files/96635073/150...  http://rapidshare.com/files/96632174/340...  http://rapidshare.com/files/96636306/371...  http://rapidshare.com/files/96638006/380...  http://rapidshare.com/files/195156516/UP...           i. Now place all of these files into the root of your PSP. That just means to place all the files into your PSP. Do not put them into the PSP file. Do not put them into the GAME folder. Just put them into the PSP.      j. Now, disconnect your PSP from the computer.      k.  Go into the GAMES underneath the PSP menu and click memory stick. You should see a program called PANDORA INSTALLER      l. Launch the program      m. Ignore all the weird messages and just find your way to the main menu.      n. Go down to Install a DDCv7 MagicStick (For Fat + Slim) and click it      o. After it finishes installing, go back to the main menu and go down to battery options.      p. Click it and chose to make battery Pandora      q. After that is complete you can quit.      r. VOW-LAH! You have a magic memory stick and a Pandora battery.      s. Now, take out the battery from the back of your PSP.       t. While holding down the Down-arrow button, carefully put the Battery back into the PSP.      u. Once the PSP turns on, you should be on a screen where you can downgrade your PSP.      v. Install 4.01 M33 Firmware.      w. Now you have custom firmware. Congrats.        x. Wanna download games and applications? I suggest     www.PSPISO.com

r7Vhc9zNaa	Why doesn't she want you playing when your brothers are trying to get to sleep? Do they sleep in the room the Xbox is in? How old are you and your brothers? If they're over 5, they should probably be able to get to sleep while you're playing. Maybe you could move the Xbox into your room, since they only play for about an hour or two a night.      EDIT:    Here's what I'd do:  Ask your parents or brothers to go in your brothers' rooms and see if they can hear you talking on Xbox Live.

UtBb83Aeaa	Even O gauge trains run on relatively low voltages, so there should not be a major concern about serious injury. Even if they connected the banana plugs together, the transformer is very likely protected against overload. However, if you want to make things more kid-proof, wrap the track connector and banana plugs with duct tape to prevent anyone from accidentally messing with them. Also, never let the trains run without close supervision, to prevent things like one of them putting their tongue on the track. Unplug the set when it's not in use. Nothing is perfectly safe, but a little common sense goes a long way to prevent accidents.|`|zTj6bnIlaa	Its probably been made not to give a shock ,but just test it yourself with either an electrical screwdriver or give it a lick.|`|kIqq7yIAaa	I'm assuming you purchased an HO train set    the track side power is only 12 volts so serious injury is unlikely  but it is still electricity so use with care    as for the connection getting wet keep all beverages off the train table  and monitor the kids while they are using it  unplug and take the controller away when they are done this will keep them from turning it on while you are away  of far greater concern is the number of small parts and sharp corners on a model train  these can be very easily broken off and swallowed or stepped on  monitor them closely while playing and remove any piece that breaks loose then file down the burr    never let them run the train on any sort of rug as the fibers can clog the geartrain and cause a fire

z6RmVT5xaa	In either knitting or purling, consistency is important.  Usually you knit into the front of the stitch - if you knit into the back, then you wind up with a twisted stitch.  But sometimes you will choose to do it that way in order to achieve something that looks different from the usual knitted stitch.  The important thing is to do it the same way in your given project.    (As an aside, you can achieve an interesting effect by knitting through the front of the stitch for several rows and then knitting through the back for several rows.   Or you can create stripes by knitting through the front for several stitches and then changing to knitting through the back for several stitches. )  Enjoy your new hobby.  It is so much fun to experiment and get different effects.|`|154dzJ1Faa	Yes, you don't have the terminology right, and I'll try not to point it out any more than I have to.    Yes, of course, there is a difference in how you make your stitches.  Knit stitches are ALWAYS done from the front of the stitch.  By inserting the needle into the back you are making a twisted stitch, and of course that won't look even.  You must always wrap the yarn around the needle the same way to get even stitches.    There is a reason why knitting is done in a certain way.  And every time you do it in your way, you are not going to get consistent results, and they won't look like the pattern is supposed to be.    Without watching what you are doing, I can't tell you how to change.  However, for one thing, I already know that you need to do it always the same way.  While there are some that do knit in the back of the stitch, they need to for a special reason.  But that is not the normal way.  I would suggest that you watch the videos here: http://www.knittinghelp.com/videos/learn...  and do them this way.  Then you will find your work much more even.    Yes, the purl stitch has the horizontal bumps.  That is correct.  The knit stitch produces a V when viewed from the front.  The back of the work will have the purl bumps.  If you have mostly purl in the front, with a few knit, the knit will stand out.|`|y02PZj22aa	Learning to knit can be almost overwhelming, particularly if you don't have someone on hand to help you.  You might enjoy the web site, KnittingHelp.com (http://www.knittinghelp.com/ ), which has videos showing nearly everything that can be done with knitting needles and yarn.  Seeing other people's hands make the stitches might help a lot.    Beyond that, the most important thing to remember is to put the working needle through the next loop to be worked *consistently*.  Loop the working yarn in the same direction *consistently*.  Then your work may be created differently from mine or the next person's, but it will be uniform and it will be beautiful.    Front-to-back produces knit (v-shaped) stitches; back-to-front produces purl (n-shaped) stitches.  You can work through the front loop or the back loop; it does not matter as long as you work every row through the front if you start with the front and every row through the back if you start with the back.  If you knit one row through the back loop and the next row through the front loop, the stitches will twist.  You can put the yarn over the working needle from left to right or right to left, clockwise or counterclockwise--it does not matter, as long as you do it consistently the same way.  There are many different combinations of ways to hold the needles, tension the yarn, and make the loops, and the "right" way for you is the way that's fastest and most comfortable and that you can do consistently.    If you k2 p2 (knit two then purl two), the knit stitches will move forward and stand out.  When you turn the knitting to go back the other way, the stitches you knit on the first side will look like purl stitches and should be purled going in this direction.  The stitches you purled on the first side will look like knit stitches and should be purled going in this direction.  After several rows, the knit columns (the v-shaped stitches) will "pop" forward.  The purl columns (the n-shaped stitches) will recess between the knit columns.|`|KHT6ysWUaa	Yes, the knits in a k2p2 should always stand out as the (vertical)ribbing. You know you must be doing something wrong if ever it is your purls that stand out as ribbing; they should lay flat (purling is often used as the background for stitchings such as cabling for that reason). I've only read just a very little about your knitting style (combination?), where you knit through a different part of the loop than I do, but I think it has its pluses-for instance your knitting should be tighter and therefore your garments more uniform and compact in appearance. You should be fine doing as you are but I suggest sticking to one or the other-the front or the back of the loop-for uniformity's sake. Hope that helps.

5ec6e061a24d9c036d2640ab0485b48baa	Bread clay can create somewhat finer details than the other clay mentioned below, but it's harder to make a large batch of it.  These sites will give you instructions and more about bread clay:  http://www.google.com/search?q=bread+cla...    Salt dough or salt dough clay is the most common home-made clay because it's easier and cheaper to mix a big batch:  http://www.google.com/search?q=salt+doug...    Those are both "air-dry" clays though so they'll need to be sealed after drying to keep humidity/moisture and bugs out over time, avoid crumbling, etc.   They can be colored with various things when the doughs are raw, or can be painted (usually with acrylics) after they dry.    The other main homemade mixtures are paper mash and papier mache.    Paper mash is just paper which has been pulverized then soaked in water, which can be shaped by hand or in molds then dried.   Papier mache has an adhesive of some kind used with paper (white glue, the natural starch from flours, wallpaper paste, etc.) and often the paper is strips of newspaper or small sections of tissue paper, etc...those aren't usually sculpted but are usually layered on top of shaped bases of other paper or cardboard/wire/etc.      HTH,    Diane B.|`|e63450517215908d3a9a820dd7193140aa	http://www.ehow.com/how_2320990_make-sal... - just one recipe of many. I personally prefer to add a teaspoon of honey after the dough is kneaded and then I knead it again. Not only does that give the dough a smoother consistency, but it also adds a nice brown color when baked in the oven.

NWYdIIMHaa	You could learn to knit or crochet. With either you can make hats, scarves, afghans, and more.    You could get into paper crafting. This includes rubber stamping and/or scrapbooking.     For more information you can click on the web site below.    At the top right of the page click on Resources. Then click on projects. There you will see a variety of projects that can be made with card stock, decorative paper, rubber stamps, and ink. Quite often other supplies are used as well.    Many of these items are things you can make and give as gifts for birthdays, anniversaries, Christmas, for new moms, house warming gifts, etc. Some items you can make as party favors.    As for cards the ideas are endless. To see those you can click on Most Recent Additions on the home page. There are a variety of styles represented.    Scrapbooking is a lot of fun and again you can see samples on the Gallery. Scroll down until you see Scrapbook. Click and there you are a whole gallery of finished pages.    It is a lot of fun!    If you have a digital camera you can take photos of whatever strikes your fancy. Yesterday evening I got some beautiful photos of the sunset from standing in my door way. Photos of historical places in your area, architecture, people doing their every day jobs, plants, animals, cars. Whatever you find interesting. I keep my digital camera in my purse so I always have it with me.    Once you've taken the photos you can use them as gifts, you can sell them (if they include people you must get their signed consent first), you can use them in crafts.    This one isn't exactly a craft but it could come in handy. If you own bicycles and ride them during the spring & summer then you could learn how to do your own maintenance. Then if you know others who also have bikes you can teach them how to do their own maintenance too.    There are all kinds of things....sewing, wood working, drawing, painting.     Whatever you enjoy and think would be fun to try go for it!|`|XNxihzf0aa	You may want to try projects using plastic canvas and yarn. You can make relatively easy tissue box covers.

70HEToFAaa	You can use any kind of paint even house paint. You will probably get better results by using paint intended for miniatures because the pigment (the part that gives paint it's color) is ground finer and won't cover detail as much as thicker paint  would.    Solvent based paints (they have a distinct odor and take special thinners & brush cleaners) will dry quickly, but you need to use them in a well ventilated place. The fumes can be harmful.    Acrylic paints use water as a thinner. They take longer to dry than the solvent based paints, but are much safer.  Craft paints (like the Apple Barrel brand) are of this type. They are a much cheaper alternative to the miniature paint -- Michael's and AC Moore often will have them on sale for less than 50 cents each.    Artist's oils will work just fine. Some of the military modelers use them to produce figures that look absolutely real. Oil, however takes a long time to dry.    You can probably use your mother's paints just fine.    There are a lot of sites on the web to give you ideas on how to paint figures. The link is to one of my favorites. The ideas will work fine for Warhammer figures, even though the site is talking about model railroad figures.|`|a7a7a0bfe671ddedd1999ac93097444caa	NO, you don't have to us Games-Work paints.

You need to go to an arts and crafts store and go to where they have styrofoam discs, rectangles, balls, etc.  Styrofoam is a crisp product infused with air bubbles; it's rigid but lightweight.

It is lightweight, and they throw it away.  It is not good for the environment.    They make it into all sort of things. Sometimes you can get those packing peanuts.  And sometimes there are huge slabs of it when you buy any electronic equipment.  You can cut it with a very sharp knife into many shapes.  But balls are found in craft stores everywhere.  You will find many of them usually at Christmas.

Then Freddie says to Sam, "At least my underwear doesn't have 'I heart Las Vegas' written across the butt."    I noticed you said "a las vegas" so I'm not sure if you know this. Just in case you don't, Las Vegas is a city in Nevada that is known for gambling and nightlife. It is also sometimes known for immoral or illegal behavior.    Good luck with your translating!|`|SI8MYdzpaa	it's better for us to actually want to tell you what they say if you upload that scene for us to watch.

cXvZr3Xmaa	I remember and totally miss VMK too!    I'm old, 26, lol and liked it.  It was a lot of fun..a nice way to relax after being at work all day!  I really enjoyed the quests, great people and that I didn't have to hear cuss words everywhere like on a lot of sites!  I may be old enough to use them, but I choose not to and don't like to hear them.    I actually didn't have access to a computer for a few months and when I finally did again, I got onto vmk.com and it was GONE!  I was so upset.  I've yet to find anything as fun as it was!  *sigh*    My username was Allibelle :)|`|r7Vhc9zNaa	I hated it.
mhXLO97Zaa	Look at my avatar. Fernando Verdasco is demonstrating the correct technique.
EUaIGX0Gaa	I t most likely would work to change it's stats|`|xxoaRXiMaa	It depends on the type of modification.  Lvl 100 pokemon no longer take in EVs. If the code sets its EVs to 0 so you can train, then no.  If it sets the EVs to 252 in each stat or whatever you want, then yeah, you'll be fine.|`|gMjrfPJmaa	yes becouse that code mostly justs lets you max all stats exept just one like normal.|`|53BOvmbiaa	yes it would work because the ev modifier sets it to whatever ev you want regardless of how many ev's it already has. so yes it will work good luck with your floatzel.
VT6yclsmaa	well sell them from ebay $300-400 :D hope this helps well you don't sell to ebay you can sell normal to Eb games $200-250|`|UtwJVPn5aa	that **** dont matter. ebay is number 1. i sold my ps3 and 2 controllers and 4 games for 600 bucks. do the same. never sell at gamestop. i offered all that **** i sold on ebay to them and they offered 50 bucks. biggest rip off ever. seriously spare ytourself|`|CiFR2xuBaa	300 bucks because it's used, and you wouldn't get what you want for your games at Game Stop, they give about 10 bucks per game for store credit use, that should be a fair price.|`|PkTab7Sraa	Yo dawg, I heard the economy sucks right now, so the best you could probably get would be $250-$300, especially since all those games are old and no one plays them, and there mature so parents won't buy it for their children.
3xXIKcMOaa	Why don't you go to bulbapedia.com? They have EV status of ever pokemon, as well as if you don't EV train.  ORR Cerebii.net. They are also really helpful thinking of movesets.    and technically there is no 'best' pokemon. There will always be that one or two players who will beat you. That's how you play.    I just don't want to give mine away.  -secret secret-      Edit:   That's kinda ironic.  Your asking people for a team no one has ever thought of?  So then someone has to think of it.  and Once it's on the internet, you aren't going to be the only player with the same team.  If you want a team no one has thought of, think of it yourself, that way it's your own secret.|`|mOTCr8Pxaa	"The best pokemon team ever" is a fantasy and does not exist. There are way too many variables.|`|15IVA2gaaa	you my friend, need a life|`|yslVRFdiaa	well personally I like arcinine. but for dark/psy/ghost my pick would be gengar or weavile|`|Dy5MEIybaa	The most powerful and unusual pokemon is Mew.(or Mewtwo)

Oh, and you get notes by doing what the note requires, like the sun note you have to stay outside for straight  ten hours on  a sunny day. for the really poor note, do not ship things, and spend all your money, not completely, but under 50 G  i think. and you should get it in the morning, for the rich note, get   over 100,000 G. go to gamespot.com, and they should have a guide about notes.|`|AA11809166	chop down trees with your axe to get lumber.

297Rkuinaa	no. you can't change your name but you can change your pokemon's name. but there a a few problems    1. if you got it from a trade it won't let you change the name  2. and same with transferring from gba    go to eterna i think. then go to one of the houses at the bottom of the place. i think the one behind the gym. then you will see a guy he will say do you wanna change your pokemons nickname and say yes.    and nooooooo.. i'm sorry to say but you can't change what you look like and i totally agree with ya it would make it better
AA12074500	LOL, poor mr video game man, did u break his heart?|`|AA11809136	did u use cheat codes?  that screwes up the game and it does stupid stuff like that|`|AA11564271	Try saving your game, then going back to the gym.

(this may be annoying but it might help). so that might increase you chance of keeping a saved game file.|`|AA11328093	Eat loads of food till you puke.  dats 11 times and ur (cj's)fat will increase and then work out|`|e119041c313370f65d6f89f04edc5b53aa	You can only work out a certain amount everytime you go in there. When it says you need to come back tomorow, go back to your safe house and save it twice (each time you save your game, 6 hours elapses) you need to wait twelve hours before you can work out again....or you could do it the dishonest way and cheat to get your muscle.

r6agj1A1aa	Not trying to evade your question but ... why would you want to?  WoW isn't demanding on video performance at all ... even at full settings, with no crossfire, it shouldn't even be slowing down a computer with the specs you listed.    My advice is to go after a crossfire setup that would be best for whatever other games you like, and WoW will work fine.  Hell, WoW runs at 1024x768 at 60FPS on my 5 year old laptop.  And I use a TON of addons.
WpUGDL6eaa	It really all depends on the game. You should check reviews and such before buying any game. Especially if it's a multi-platform game. For instance, Fallout 3 is best on PC. And Call of Duty 4 and Bioshock are best on PS3. It really depends on the game, but usually games are best on the PC. Games on PS3 and 360 are usually so close in comparism you really can't tell the difference in them. Maybe some different color hues, but they're pretty much identical and no matter what system you buy the game on, it'll still be fun... Which is the important part.|`|rIFqv8nvaa	Well if your pc is good, the hell with the 360 and ps3|`|bSNm7VWVaa	well the pc is good for online shooters games like css|`|QcqpzFNUaa	id always buy it if it was on pc first.... it will look a lot better (because of AA and texture quality, etc) if you have the hardware for it ....|`|9a4b7e3b6ab422a4cb02fdef406926faaa	well its easy dont use your pc its for porn and homework dont use your ps3 because in the first place you should have never bout it so i guess you use the xbox|`|AH4TVEBIaa	xbox360 but pc games can do more i guess.

UIT1khqtaa	The story to the whole trilogy:    The story arc of the game trilogy begins with the game Halo: Combat Evolved, set in 2552. The Covenant arrive at Reach, which is the UNSC's last colonial stronghold; they vitrify the planet, leaving very few survivors. Master Chief, the last SPARTAN thought alive, escapes on the ship Pillar of Autumn. The Pillar of Autumn, in order to avoid leading the Covenant to Earth, proceeds to coordinates selected by the female A.I. Cortana; dropping out of slipspace, the Autumn discovers the titular Halo, and is attacked by the Covenant. Battle damage forces the Autumn to the surface of the ring, where the Flood, a parasitic alien species, are accidentally released by the Covenant. The release of the Flood prompts the ring's caretaker, 343 Guilty Spark, to convince the Master Chief to activate Halo's defenses, so that the Flood can be destroyed. The Forerunners created Halo to starve the Flood of their foodsentient lifeby exterminating all possible vectors for thousands of light-years in every direction. Upon discovering Halo's purpose, the Master Chief detonates the fusion reactors in the crashed Pillar of Autumn, destroying the ring; he and Cortana then escape in a fighter spacecraft.    In Halo: First Strike, the Master Chief returns to Reach, located in the Epsilon Eridani system, and rejoins the survivors of the vitrification. He and other SPARTAN-II's attack a Covenant space station, where a fleet is massing to attack Earth. The space station is destroyed, giving the humans time to prepare for the invasion. Soon after in Halo 2 a small Covenant fleet arrives at Earth. Badly beaten by the humans, the Covenant commander, the High Prophet of Regret, flees to another Halo, Installation 05, unwittingly taking the human ship In Amber Clad with him. At Installation 05, the Master Chief kills the High Prophet, leading to the replacement of the Covenant Elites with the Brutes as the preferred soldiers of the Covenant. This changing of the guard causes a schism within the Covenant. The Elites, realizing they have been betrayed, ally with the humans. The Elite warrior known as the Arbiter joins the humans Miranda Keyes and Sergeant Johnson in stopping the activation of Halo. This act inadvertently puts all the Halo installations on standby: the remaining rings can be activated remotely from a location known as "The Ark".    The Master Chief stows away on a Forerunner vessel headed to Earth, in the midst of a full-scale invasion by the Covenant. In Halo 3, the Covenant excavate a Forerunner artifact in the African desert; despite the efforts of the Elites and humans, the High Prophet of Truth activates the artifact, which opens a slipspace portal to the Ark. The Master Chief and the Arbiter travel through the portal and kill Truth; They then activate a new Halo ring under construction in an effort to destroy the local Flood, led by the intelligence known as the Gravemind, while sparing the rest of the galaxy. Because the ring's construction is incomplete, the resulting pulse destroys the ring and damages the Ark. The Arbiter escapes the explosion, but the Master Chief and Cortana are left drifting in space, trapped in the severed rear half of their ship. The Master Chief cryonically freezes himself as he and Cortana wait for rescue. In a bonus ending, the ship is seen drifting towards a mysterious planet.|`|2soyTz7eaa	There are books? They are really good i have read them all. Actually I think I am going to read them all again.     So basically you got the first part. The Gov wanted to make this super weapon to fight the covenant. They had this really smart chick who wanted to try and make super humans. No one really thought it would work but they were desprite so they let her try.   They went and got like 150 children based on their abilitys. John the spartin you play as was just really lucky mean as hell and tough as balls. The lab lady liked him the best so she gave him cortana. So there was tons of missions they went on. They began fighting the covent. They never lost any batttles. NEVER. The covenant could only win against them in space but on the ground the spartins kicked some ***. They would always be winning but the covenant bastards would always shoot this huge as plasma shot at a planet and "glass" the planet. Basically it would turn the planet to molten lava. Thats the only way they could win.    The planet reach is Humanitys last stronghold before the covenant could find earth. So they invade and all the spartins are sent they to hold them off. They do really good. Their was like 23 spartins left by this invasion. Some died in there training to become what they were some could not take the genetic transformation some died in space battles and so forth. So the last 23 or so are kicking like 4000 covenant *** all at once. The covenant give up glass reach and only John is able to survive. That were the first game picks up. He was on a ship out in space cause i think they wanted at least one to survive? The ship he is on jumps through space and the covenant like always are better in space were able to follow them and out of crazyness the humans found the ring and it all starts.     There is was more i could tell you but you got to read. I left out so much that you could still read the books and love them.     You should really go buy them and read them you will love thim!!!!!|`|ww4Byajcaa	well there a guy with a green helmet and he goes round shooting ****    the end|`|8UcMR12haa	theres one answer to all of this........ aliens    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo:_Comba...    you can read up alot of stuff on it through that link :) enjoy|`|RXkeocfzaa	There's a pretty good feature on 1up.com about this.|`|7LQKYwcHaa	mmmmmkay, i play the games but have not read any books so this may not even help but what the heck,    okay, so u start out(halo 1) in this giant ship where they train master chief, (i dont know of any other master chiefs) then the cov totally attack and is all killin everybody and so you have to get to the little life pod thingies to escape the ship, cuz  its gonna blow, and when you get in there you and all the other little life pods land on a strange planet, ring thinie-HALO and everybody crash lands and every one in your pod is dead, except for you-pretty ironic isnt it?- even though you were standing, and didnt have a seat belt, it was because you are the uber master chief----anywho you land on halo and you go to search for survivers from the other pods but MOSTLY everybodys dead. so cov drop ships are all landing everywhere and so you blow em all away and eventually you jump in your hog and ride like there aint no california. then yada yada this happens then that happens and eventually halo 2 happens and you fight ur way through the stanky little cov and then the covenant while trying to access the rings let out a virus, the flood and yada yada and whatevs but yea they probably obducted little children from there homes or something and turned them into like ninja uber fighters that never die or something...       THE PEOPLE are fighting the cov because the rings are supposed to be used as some weapon of mass destruction and what not so they are trying to accesss it and in the proccess they let out the flood virus which turns them into zombie things and master chief is tryin to stop them so they dont like blow up the universe or earth or somethin.    :D|`|FjoH5USsaa	He's a government assasin.|`|ACgDmANEaa	well its starts like this there were these aincent creatures  thousands of years who were the race of spartans and the spartans were in a war againt the cov and all got extinced after the war thousands of years later int he future humans have space ships and lasers and stuff and discover a  guy coin down like a comet  they find hes in a green suit then he wakes upp and they were all amazed by his abilitys so then master chief the last of all spartans joined humanty meanwhile the reason master chief was well sent down was because of cortana shes like this holagram girl im pretty sure theres no story for cortana will then  it then master chief remembers somthing about the halo rings and it was like hismission to shut it down and theres the covement there goal is to take control of the power of the halo rings and rule the univierse so till now in each  game of halo somhow in every sequel at the end somthing goes wrong when they shut down the ring and they have to deafeat some boss or somthiing to restore but always somthing has to go wrong and they have to reapeat the proccess again also at the beggining of each game theres always somthing that happens and its always is master chiefs entrance into the game first he goes down a ship in the first game in the second game he sorta just wakes up and in the third game they find him lying down so honestly theres no secific halo story.
KAuPPyxDaa	I suggest taking out the Sakuretsu armours. They're not going to save you when Judgment Dragon, Dark Armed Dragon, and Stardust Dragon are on the field. Add more waboku's and soul release

jqn4Uubnaa	Oh my gosh I loveeee Sudoku!! It's soo much fun! Do you not know how to play? What you do is, there are 9 big boxes, and each one contains 9 smaller ones. Each big box contains the numbers 1-9 in it, and there are no repeats. So there can't be two 1's in the same big box. And if the number 1 is in, lets say the middle row, The middle row down or up can't have it, and the middle rows across from it can't have it. So it has to be in a different row on the other boxes. No 2 numbers can be in the same row across or up or down. It's a lot of fun once you get the hang of it.|`|9LYQ34Bvaa	I like sudoku. It can be difficult, but there are puzzles that are also very easy.

As you are talking about 'crack' file, it is sure tha the game is a pirated one. Pirated games have such problems, file missing, can't load, error page etc. Anyway, you can download a crack for the game from internet & try again. If it says that file missing, let's say, dll file, then download the file from internet & put it in the proper place. It should work.|`|AA11328093	Try downloading a new crack.  Itz illegal though|`|e41cba86e5892a365dc24550402998f8aa	ur crack is all messed up...and also since ive played it and i have a 128mb Graphicas card and 512 Mb ram and 2.8Ghz HT....it still run slow...256 is gonna cause problems....
AA12160260	there is actually nothing new exept the character and the city, it's basicly a remake of the PSP game on PS2 if you have San Andreas you don't really need to buy it (some people actually say it's WORSE than San Andreas).|`|AA11328093	There are no new things in particular xept u count the story line.

Ummm...I'd chose either Sims2 or Prince of Persia 3    In the sims 2 there isn't really a "Main Goal" in the game, so you can't ever really finish the game, on the other hand with prince of persia, once you finished the game there isn't much more to see.

92972eba17a74f99a50ad86f36c0ec2daa	877-386-9283    I had to wait forever for an appointment.  They ran my credit before the appointment.  Their customer service department was very good.  I had a bad experience with the sales person not showing for my appointment and decided not to go with them any longer.  I confirmed my appointment with their office a week before and the day before but because the sales rep could not get a hold of me at 9 pm the night before my 9am appointment he did not show up.  He never tried calling the morning of my appointment and since I did not call them until 9:15am - because I thought he might be running late.....he couldn't make it to my house and I would need to re-schedule.  I thought it was very unprofessional for them not to have at least attempt to call me on the morning of my appointment before deciding not to show up for the appointment.  I was not home the night before but I was home the morning of the appointment - had he called at 7 or 8 he would have known that and would have had plenty of time to still make it on time.  I had just confirmed at 3pm the day before the appointment.  I did not think that I was going to have to confirm again.  I decided not to reschedule and am now looking for a local pool company instead.  Good Luck....hopefully this was just an unfortunate incident and you will have a good experience.

And I am sure. if it was a privately made game like runescape it would possibly be free but this one that you are talking about is an official game right? It will need monthly fees to pay workers, patches, and server maintenance. I wanted the star wars MMORPG long ago until I found out it had a fee. 2 years later I was old enough for a job... and then the patches, upgrades... and finally they increased the monthly fee on top of that. I have a sad story about that but maybe another time. go to swgalaxies vault or the forums and you'll see what I mean. Hope this game isn't made by the same people.
