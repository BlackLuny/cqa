And although I want the big one am happy to pick up lesser prizes most times I play.  Here are my tips for a winning lottery system:  1. don't choose sequence numbers eg 1,2,3 as this are least likely to be drawn or other unlikely number combinations. There is a lot of online info about number combinations.  2. choose your core 3-4 numbers and repeat numbers in each line so if those numbers come up you recive multiple prizes.  3. aviod lucky dips or ones generated by the machine operator it is completly random and take control away from you to choose the most likely winning combination.  4. better to rather than play each week to save up your planned spend to one monthly play eg if you are happy to spend $5 per week save it up and spend $20 in one game using the rules above.    good luck.

Killzone 2 if you like multiplayer but love the dingy look. Just know this, the teammates for the Killzone 2 campaign are meant to be retarded compared to the enemy ai.

jUOby60paa	I can either say anywhere from 3-10 Hours depending on if you are Achievement Hunting or just playing through and depending on your skill and Difficulty level, etc. If you have this weekend to play it, I would recommend drop everything for a day and play from breakfast to lunch, lunch to dinner, and all night until you beat it. That is, if you are a hard-core gamer.<br>  <br>  Otherwise, 8 levels, I believe. All around 20-30 Minutes each if you run through them slaughtering everyone. The Ark is the longest at near an hour to beat the whole level.|`|lOuz0nU2aa	It's around 5 to 9 hours long to complete.<br>  This depends on what difficulty you are doing it on and how good you are at the game also.|`|uEE1lHvqaa	It's a good campaign, although slightly small.

But once you get in, the waiting time for any type of match is not long. This game still rocks, and is packed, even after the new one came out.

MuKiALlwaa	The next morning, when you speak to your child, he/she will tell you of a dream of a 'lady with wings' who begged for help. Your child will want to help her.<br>  <br>  At that time, go to the Harvest Goddess Spring. As soon as you enter, you experience an event with the Harvest Goddess. She stands at the foot of the Mother Tree, and all five of the Harvest Sprites stand in front of her.<br>  <br>  She tells you now that another island needs help. The soil is poor and the island cannot thrive without aid. Again and again, the Harvest Goddess will cry:<br>  <br>  "I'm begging you!"<br>  <br>  You now have the option to tell her that you will help, but when you do, she will tell you it is not your help that is needed, but that of your child.<br>  <br>  She then tells you that when you feel your child is ready to become independent, she makes a 'Journey Rucksack' for him/her. She adds that all you have to do is ask her for a list of the ingredients when you feel the time has come.<br>  <br>  If you wish to go home now and return another day, you may. Otherwise, you can ask her immediately for the list of ingredients.<br>  <br>  She will give you the following list:<br>  -Shining Wool Yarn<br>  -Shining Flax Yarn<br>  -Black Pearl<br>  -Rare Metal<br>  <br>  Shining Wool Yarn: Any sheep when sheared will produce wool and a sheep with high heart level will produce Shining Wool on a random basis. Place Shining Wool in the Yarn Maker to create Shining Wool Yarn.<br>  <br>  Shining Flax Yarn: Flax is a Spring Crop and if the soil is fertilized, Shining Flax will be produced randomly at the time of harvest. Place Shining Flax in the Yarn Maker to create Shining Flax Yarn. There is one other means by which you can obtain this item. It is one of the items found in a 'Hidden Gift Box' in the course of the Treasure Hunt.<br>  <br>  Black Pearl: This can be found on the beaches of both Toucan Island and East Gull Island.<br>  <br>  Rare Metal: This is refined from Rare Ore that displays sparkles. Mira must refine all Ores, but there is another method by which you can obtain this item. One of the items found in a 'Hidden Gift Box' in the course of the Treasure Hunt is Rare Metal.<br>  <br>  You need to return to the Harvest Goddess Spring with all ingredients for the Journey Rucksack in your own Rucksack. The Harvest Goddess then creates the Journey Rucksack for you.<br>  <br>  I hope I helped.<br>  Good luck and have fun!
VmGrypxVaa	It's on Route 215|`|RLHy0fW9aa	In Fire Red and Leaf Green you get it after you defeat L.T Surge. In Ruby and Sapphire you get it after you defeat the Mauville Town gym. In Diamond and pearl it is in Route 215.
VmGrypxVaa	Yes you need a thunder stone and use it on eevee.<br>  <br>  <br>  Those stones can only be obtained from Bill's grandfather, who stays in Bill's cottage north of Cerulean City.<br>  <br>  Bill's grandfather will ask you to show him certain Pokémon he describes. This is the order he will ask you and what you'll get as a reward to be so kind towards him :<br>  <br>  * Lickitung - Everstone<br>  * Oddish - Leaf Stone<br>  * Staryu - Water Stone<br>  * Vulpix - Fire Stone<br>  * Pichu - Thunderstone<br>  <br>  You see you only got one of each kind. So let clone the stone you have!<br>  <br>  Start with giving a Pokémon the stone. Go to a PokéCenter, stand in front of the computer and save. Make sure you put the Pokémon into an empty box (I always take Box 6) and save to a box which is empty (I always take Box 2). While tht text " SAVING... DON'T TURN OFF THE POWER! " appears, turn your Game Boy off. Now turn it back on, enter your saved game and you'll see that you have two Pokémon : one in your party and one in your box. Repeat those steps and get as many stones as you want.<br>  <br>  I hope I solved your problem, good luck with your evolved Pokémon and have fun! :D|`|kDrjtu0Saa	um only at special shops or get it as a prize at the battle place...|`|40lcQxnDaa	buy a thunderstone<br>  the big department store in Goldenrod is the place to go to get one.
78QTdcBlaa	on the booklet it says take a 15 min break between each hour of play.<br>  4 a eye excercise, stare at ure finger(without contacta or glasses on) for 2 sec then stare at a target 10 ft away. repeat this for 10-20 times|`|5yBAMbIZaa	its probably because you where playing with ur lights off(at dark) or without blinking too much, the light form the tv hurts your eyes|`|3dfM9f57aa	If you read the instruction booklet it tells you that if you play for to long you could possibly get certain symptoms or seizures. But nobody reads those things anymore. lol.<br>  <br>  although i don't think 10-20 minutes is very long. So I'm not exactly sure why thats happening|`|0jkuZYkkaa	Sounds like your doing good in your video game habits. Such short sessions shouldn't hurt your eyes at all. Like the answerer above said, maybe try blinking more often? <br>  It could be the fact that you are playing Gears of War. Its a pretty intense game. My eyes hurt sometimes when I'm really engrossed in a game or trying really hard to win. A game like that could stress you out. When you do stressful things in real life, you become tired. When your watching a violent or stressful video game your eyes become fatigued.<br>  <br>  Also, it could be your screen. Are you sitting really close or really far away? Or is your screen small or fuzzy? <br>  Try looking away from the screen every so often.<br>  <br>  The human eye works by focusing on something. When your staring at a screen your eye is essentially working out.  When you look all around your eye constantly re-adjusts, which is like a rest for it. When you are staring at a t.v. screen, even though the pictures are moving, your eyes are focused at the same distance; where the t.v. screen is. <br>  To give your eyes a rest you should look away from the screen whenever you can, i.e., load times, when you die or are spawning, whenever. Just look around the room and stare at something far away, then close up, etc.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|zw3rrCoYaa	Its because you have to blink while your playing. Try a little harder, its not the video games fault.

0jkuZYkkaa	Yes you can. After putting in the Action Replay and then removing it you place your game in the DS. At that point the screen will show a check mark on the bottom right or left of the screen, can't remember which. From there you can choose which cheats to apply or turn off. <br>  No, the Action Replay won't read the R4 as a game, so it won't work. Though depending on the R4 and where you donwload your games from on it, it might come with cheats programmed into it. Just press the y button when the game is highlighted to choose which ones. <br>  But again, only some R4's have this.|`|fawhiGtsaa	Yes.|`|lOuz0nU2aa	Yeah, you can turn the action replay cheats on and off whenever you want.

She suggests you go to The Flowing Bowl just outside Anvil but you should still talk to Gogan to learn exactly what they did to him and then leave for The Flowing Bowl along The Gold Coast.<br>  <br>  Once you enter shortly after you will be approached by two women that enter behind you. Don't draw your weapons unless you want them to take out theres and attack you with them.<br>  <br>  If you are a male character, Signy sees that you're alone and offers you to head out to there farm at 11 PM to have a night of fun. If you have a female character Faustina offers you an invite in to there gang. They will add the mark on your map, leave The Flowing Bowl and head east to Gweden Farm.<br>  <br>  Roughly around 11 PM you can enter the farmhouse with Faustina already inside. You will be waiting on Signy to come in shortly. You will have different variations depending on your gender but it will all end up the same in the end. She will yell for Signy and a Kajiit to come in and help her take care of you. Kill the three of them off and then Maelona and Gogan will come in dressed as Anvil Guards. You will get a reward of leveled Gold from them.<br>  <br>  Take the Gweden Basement Key off of Tsarrina or Faustina and use it to go in to the basement of the house. Loot the place and then leave the farm house.<br>  <br>  Note: Taken from a Walkthrough Brokaliv and Tatoto over at GameFaqs; thank them not me. But, there was PS3 version, so I got the X360 one. =]

They are based in Nevada State so it is very safe and reliable, unlike all the other unsafe websites that are from foreign countries.  My friend got them to level his death knight to level 80 and was one of the first 80s on his server.  I am planning to get the new PvP arena gear and have them run Naxx for my Tier 8 gear.

It's not any harder than learning how to crochet.<br>  Good luck to you!<br>  <br>  Edit: I was curious about these mittens and so i looked them up...It's a cable pattern.

YOU NOW HAVE CRESSELIA/MESPRIT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|Kh0s5O2Caa	Use a pokemon with the ability to trap foes. For example, Wobbuffet has Shadow Tag, which prevents escape. Or you can use Block or Mean Look. Have someone use Hypnosis or freeze it. It's the best method. Try with Ultra Balls, and if it doesn't work, get to Timer Balls. Deeper into the battle will they be effective. And if it is night time, use Dusk Balls.<br>  <br>  If you have trouble finding them, use your Poketch. If you go to the Poketch  Company in Jubilife, they will upgrade your Poketch.<br>  Also, if you run between two routes, they will eventually come to you. xD|`|5yBAMbIZaa	you just have to keep chasing them and once you find them have a wobbufet with its special ability that i forgot what its called which prevents ur opponent's poke from leaving the battle.

mOAY4FbJaa	Without knowing more about your computer, the suggestions I can offer are limited, but one of the first things you might want to check is whether or not there are any upgrade patches for the games that are not working.  It usually doesn't take too long after a game is released for bug fixes and enhancements to become available, and it often takes awhile before these bug fixes are incorporated into commercially-available downloads or retail boxes.  Also make sure that the drivers for all your hardware, particularly the motherboard chipset and video card, are updated through either your computer manufacturer's Web site (if the parts came on a pre-built system) or from the chipset/video chipset vendor's Web site.  A BIOS update for your motherboard may also be in order.<br>  <br>  The biggest issue, however, may be compatibility with your operating system.  If your computer has Windows Vista, you may experience more in the way of compatibility issues.  Windows Vista is poor at supporting older games, programs, and even hardware, and many such pieces of software will need to be updated to run properly on Vista.  Unfortunately, in beta-testing Windows 7, it doesn't look like this issue is going to get any better.  For maximum compatibility--and the best experience overall--you need to be running Windows XP.  Good luck.
UbDn94q9aa	used to play now suckes no wilderness! only PvP<br>  <br>  RuneScape is a Java-based MMORPG (Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game) operated by Jagex Ltd. Recognised by Guiness World Records as the world's most popular free MMORPG,[1] RuneScape has approximately fifteen million active free accounts and is a graphical browser-based game with a large degree of 3D rendering.<br>  <br>  RuneScape was created by Andrew Gower, the creator of DeviousMUD, the forerunner to RuneScape, in 1998. Rewritten and renamed, the first version of RuneScape was released to the public on 4 January 2001 in beta form. It has a free-to-play option, and a simple interface that is accessible on most web browsers.<br>  <br>  RuneScape takes place in the fantasy-themed realm of Gielinor, which is divided into several different kingdoms, regions, and cities.[2][3] Players can travel throughout Gielinor on foot, by using magical teleportation spells and devices, or mechanical means of transportation.[4] Each region offers different types of monsters, materials, and quests to challenge players. Unlike many other MMORPGs, there is no linear path that must be followed. Players appear on the screen as customisable avatars, setting their own goals and objectives. Players can combat both monsters and other players, complete quests, or increase their experience in any of the available skills.[5] Players interact with each other through trading, chatting, or playing combative or cooperative mini-games.|`|EsyU6nrJaa	Gosh, it'd be nice if you asked something<br>  <br>  but ANYTHING you need to know about ANYTHING in all of runescape is located in the website below|`|K60l9Rlnaa	The best info i can give you is, don't play it, trust me.|`|7RziqsDcaa	Dude don't play it.

AA11850311	looking at Dell's website, the Inspiron 1525's seems to have Intel Graphics Media Accelerator X3100, instead of dedicated graphics cards.  That chipset just does not run any Sims2 games well consistently.  Some of those laptops also seem to only have 1GB of memory, which will also cause problems, especially if you are trying to run any of the newer expansions.<br>  Here is a chart showing system recommendations from actual players (not the estimates that EA gives out)<br>  <a href="http://www.sims2wiki.info/wiki.php?title=Game_Help:System_Requirements/MTS2_Recommendations" rel="nofollow">http://www.sims2wiki.info/wiki.php?title...</a><br>  Now if you can manage to get to a neighborhood, in the lower left corner, look for the options or settings button.  Go to graphics, and turn all the settings down as far as you can.  Shadows off, object detail low, etc.  That may help you out.  And whatever you do, do not get any new custom content, especially clothes, hair or make-up.  If you are already having problems playing sims, adding more content will only make the problem worse.<br>  If the game still doesn't play with all the graphics settings turned down, the only other suggestion I have, is to get one of the Sims Stories games instead.  They have lower requirements, and are supposed to run fine on most laptops<br>  <a href="http://thesims2.ea.com/about/sims_stories/index.php" rel="nofollow">http://thesims2.ea.com/about/sims_storie...</a>|`|mT5srUKHaa	it may be the game, are there scratches on the disk?

I did that and I have a Crobat on level 48!

O5Wyf5gOaa	depends.if you know how to evolve it into crobat,you should know that it depends on its happiness level.<br>  give it some vitamins(carbos and stuff like that)and do not allow it to faint,and also do not store it in your pc.the happiness level will be lowered as time goes by.<br>  i've never evolved a golbat before(i find it weak and pathetic,no offense and say sorry to your golbat for me),but it should evolve at around level 50.most pokemon evolve by then.|`|620ba5456e018e8f7a22ce50ce9fbe0faa	In order to evolve Golbat, you have to have its friendship at a very high level.<br>  <br>  ARCANINE RULES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...|`|LzQ2Fnrpaa	there is no average lvl but mine evolved at lvl 32 just feed it protiens ect and lvl it up it will evolve

14zPKh5aaa	Either the person writing it deleted them all, or the Sims2.com deleted them. Sometimes that happens. The person writing it might have stopped playing and deleted everything so that they wouldn't start playing again. If the site deleted it, then maybe the last one will come out later, and the writer has just been busy.

MDihde89aa	I dont know about 6star... <br>  If stars are about the difficulty and not the shape or something (since there are 3x3, 4x4 and other with other rules and shapes) please add that info too.<br>  <br>  There isnt missing logic. Just need to review the rules...<br>  There is always a strategy or trick to find an answer as long as its logical.<br>  And in logic there is a difference in "trial and error" and just put a number and if it works for you ok.<br>  <br>  If you use trial and error and put a number and find that it is not ok, you can say for sure that this number shouldnt be here and remove the possibility<br>  <br>  (Some times you have to write down every possibility and use logic that applies to the rules and order to narrow them and find the correct one)<br>  Since you can say you can do 5stars you propably havent tried the real hard ones (If 5star and 6star rates the difficulty and not the shape, ignore this)<br>  <br>  But certainly not if putting a number to test the waters, is a solution and the puzzle shouldnt continue... you have to find the error ;)<br>  like chess, you dont move until you "see" it<br>  <br>  This method is useful for situations that numbers are chained in pairs...<br>  check color method in the tutorial link<br>  <br>  But of course you need the possibilities ;)<br>  And as long the puzzle has only one solution it trial and error isn't needed that much<br>  BTW any program can use that kind of cheat to solve any sudoku with only this method by brute forcing all the numbers like that and since it can return back if it isnt its called trial and error (since you cannot its not trial and error and its not a logical acceptable solution)|`|el8yX5q3aa	anything works it is fair game.

There are a lot of tricks to solving the most insane of Sudoku puzzles; most of which can be solved in 10 minutes or less using these tricks. The techniques are difficult to explain, but I'll try to explain one of the most valuable techniques I use:<br>  <br>  Find any 3x3 area that has two numbers in the same row or colum. Then look at the numbers on the same row or column that intersect between the squares that have known numbers. Say the intersetion is at the middle column of the upper-left 3x3 square, for example. Any numbers that appear all the way down that middle column can't go in that row, because the other two squares in the row are already used, so they must go in that row of another 3x3; either the top-middle or top-right 3x3 square. So look across and see if those numbers appear in either of those 3x3 squares already. If it appears in the middle 3x3, then check top-right 3x3. You then know that the number must go in one of the three squares of the same row in the top-right 3x3. Then you check for that number in columns that intersect with those three squares and narrow down the possibilities that way. You may be able to fill in a number, or you may not, but you've at least narrowed it down to three possibilities. Apply this method to any other 3x3 squares with two numbers filling one of it's rows or columns.|`|UEevDQG7aa	There's Excel spreadsheets on the web that take the brain damage out of Soduko and solve it for you.

LItIiiHKaa	Well a lot of the stuff out there including the stuff on my site presumes at least a basic understanding of the game and if you don't have that you will find it difficult to get through more advanced stuff.  The first thing you need to do is make sure you know the rules and then get into some introductory lessons about the concepts of the game.  Then you can get into some of the strategy stuff and work your way up to the advanced lessons.  You can do a web search on "poker rules" and "beginners poker lessons" to get you started.<br>  <br>  Momo that's a pretty nice site you have for someone who just learned the game.  You're too modest :)  By the way I had a look at her intro poker page that her link takes it to and if you're a beginner it's worth checking out.<br>  <br>  King Cobra Poker<br>  <a href="http://kingcobrapoker.com" rel="nofollow">http://kingcobrapoker.com</a>|`|J8F5hraQaa	i have learned texas hold em poker few months ago, first it was hard then once i know how it works its very easy and very exciting game.<br>  <br>  i learned from here: <a href="http://www.pokerdeal.org/how-to-play-poker.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.pokerdeal.org/how-to-play-pok...</a><br>  They have explained step by step with images how it works. very easy to understand, hope it helps you.
URogWxhQaa	one thing i sudjeest is eather clean your system ill tell you how to do that, or clean the disk. better yet my email is kennymccormic10@yahoo.com so email me if you need any help. i have so much to tell you about this question because im a huge gamer. here are some things you might want to try.PS: sorry for my spelling!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  STEPS:<br>  1) CLEAN YOUR DISK BY REMOVING ALL SCRATCHES. USE A CLEANER LIQUID, OR BUY SOME PLAIN WHITE TOOTHPASTE(THE TOOTHPASTE HAS TO BE PLAIN WHITE NOT THE STUFF WITH THE CRYSTALS) AND SMEAR IT ALL OVER THE BACK OF THE DISK IN CYRCLES. LET IT SIT FOR ABOUT 5-10 MIN. NOW WIPE ALL THE TOOTHPASTE OFF WITH WATER AND DRY THE DISK OFF COMPLEATLY BEFOR SICKING IT IN THE CONSULE.<br>  <br>  2) HOPEFULLY YOUR GAME SYSTEM IS A PS2 BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT I HAVE AND I KNOW HOW TO CLEAN IT. IF YOU LIIK IN THE BACK OF YOUR PS2 YOULL SEE A BUNCH OF SQUARES AND INSIDE IS A FAN. EATHER TAKE THE BACK OF THE PS2 OUT AND GIVE IT A THOROW CLEAN OR YOUR SECOND OPTION IS TO POP ALL THE LINT AND CRAP OUT OF THOSE LITTLE SQUARES THEN TRY TO RUN IT AGEAN. <br>  <br>  IF NONE OF THAT WORKS FEEL FREE TO EMAIL ME AT (kennymccormic10@yahoo.com) for more answers about your question!

xGkJGvSiaa	best way is grand exchange now since you can barely get much money off selling more since there is a price range you can have. But forumns under crafting is the 2nd best way otherwise just stand at ge and say selling green bodies for this price and so on but many people might not wanna buy since its only 25 try forumns under crafting|`|MgFtq0oFaa	there really isnt a better place at general stores it is cheaper sold than people buy it so u should really go with the grand exchange|`|uPQW3BSdaa	well, to tell you the truth, the Grand Exchange is really the best place for them.

I will vaguely touch on some of the different money making methods I have used if you would like more details on any one please feel free to contact me either in game or via yahoo.<br>   …1)Non combat skills<br>  ~Fishing~ Sharks, and monk fish, Fishing trawler <br>  ~Hunting~ polar kebbits, carnivorous chinchompas (stackable)<br>  ~Farming~ Grow Marigolds, ranarr, snapdragon, spirit weed & toadflax.<br>  ~rune crafting~ is almost always profitable<br>  ~Cooking~ Tuna Potatoes, curry stew, and pizza’s<br>  ~Thieving~ cave goblin wires from Dorgesh-kaan.<br>  ~construction~ Make Teletabs via Lectern in player owned house.<br>  ~Mining~ coal is slow but pays very well. If you are high enough Adamintite and Runite.<br>  <br>   …2) Using Combat<br>  ~Dragons using Melee or Range.<br>  ~Chaos druids, Unicorns, Moss giants, Vampires, White wolves, Cockroaches,  Jungle spiders, Iban Disciples and Avanasis are all good monsters to fight for profitable drops.<br>  *If you’re not interested in the prayer experience you can always kill and sell the bones<br>  ** A fast way to big money is PKing but this is a risky endeavor. <br>  <br>   …3) Slayer~ In general Slayer monsters pay well. Consider the food you use an investment. Most assignments drops more than pay for the food needed to fight them. The possibility of receiving a rare drop makes them even more enticing.<br>  <br>   …4) Merchanting...<br>  <br>  … 5) There are several quests that are well worth the effort.<br>  <br>   Throne of Miscellania (and Royal trouble) quests,andthe Hand in sand quest <br>   …6) You can collect Snape grass, Mort myre fungus, Planks, White berries, Potato cacti, Flax (Spin the flax into bowstrings for even more profit),Red spider eggs, Blue dragon scales, and Swamp tar. All these sell well.<br>   …7)Clue scrolls are a roll of the dice but they have the possibility of large large payoffs! <br>   … 8) You can hang out at the Falador drop room... I find wearing a ring of wealth helps (this is controversial)... it’s just up to luck what you can get and how fast you can get it.<br>   …9) One of the newest ways of making money is the recent Diversions and distractions addition... Penguin hunting can make as much as 97.5k a week and Shooting stars can give you 106 k a day in runes coins and ore.<br>   These are all good solid ways to try out and figure which one YOU like the best to make money. (my personal favorite is chaos druids)... remember the point of the game is to have fun. So find the one you like, sit back relax and enjoy! You can add me if you like (popslantern) I can clarify anything you have questions about (but because I do answer so many questions for others please be polite and patient, as I will be).I also have a quest cape so I can help with questions in regards to those, although I will not do your quests for you. Hope to see you in game!<br>  |`|EFMpo1kIaa	I buy 2000 coal for 320k and 1000 iron for 85k (on Grand Exchange). This costs about 405k.

MtikeJtRaa	It's possible it was used for Tunisian crochet.  That type of crochet is done on a long hook, about 10 inches long, and does not have a hook at both ends.  The Tunisian hooks today have a stopper on the end, like what knitting needles have, to prevent the stitches from coming off the non-working end.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunisian_crochet" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunisian_cr...</a><br>  |`|AA12177717	There are a couple of possibilities here.  <br>  <br>  It may be a *jumper* crochet hook, which is a form of afghan or Tunisian crochet hook that has/had a flexible cable on the far end to accommodate more stitches than a 14" hook could for a larger item.  These have been popular off and on for about 40 years or so.<br>  <br>  The other possibility is that it may be an old knitting needle of Eastern European or, possibly, Portugese use.  Knitters in Portugal, Greece, Turkey and other northernly Middle Eastern countries are known to have worked with hooked knitting needles, and for looping their yarns around their around their neck (often knitting with two colors, one going in either direction around their neck) to tension them.  They keep the balls of yarn in pockets in their aprons, or dangling from yarn hooks they attach to their blouses (Vivian Hoxboro uses one pinned to her dress when she knits), enabling them to walk around and knit at the same time, since in earlier times these women multi-tasked by knitting and working their market stalls, herding their animals on foot, or simply walking to the local village at the same time.|`|IbgKtQMkaa	I'd say it's just a wooden crochet hook.  They had to do something with the other end so it was probably rounded so it didn't poke into your hand.  I have a few handmade hooks that range from just cut off square to having a fancy turned end on them.<br>  <br>  **

The 4th one being that I had to return to the security room by a certain hour. Well after the hour had passed,I tried to return to the security room,and I watched the film of Brad talking with ?Joanne? and after it finished,the 4th step filled  in,but then all the other cases went red and it told me that "the truth had fallen into darkness" This means that you essentially lost and have to restart or start from your last save point.<br>  But I just started from my last save point,I'll do that and try to finish the first case on time then.<br>  Oh and looking for the shirts and cool stuff,just go into a store that you like.

If it was larger than that, I would give some of it my church, or programs that assist the homeless.

There *were* combos in it, but they were all timed juggles.

And hard.<br>  <br>  Personally I didn't like the Run-up-and-Dial-A-Combo system myself.  If Midway had something to do with the arcade *release* of Killer Instinct, then why, for the love of what's holy, did they *not* include a more special-move based system, versus button mashes?  Oh yeah, because the rest of the game was simple too...<br>  <br>  Eh, it wasn't bad for mindless entertainment and two-player play...but I did outgrow most of it in time, for things like Virtua Fighter.  Pity the better game ended up on *chiclet-ware* like the Playstations 2 and 3.... >_<<br>  <br>  Oh well....it isn't like arcades are into *real video games* anymore, are they?

rqLMadTUaa	The statement that mages do more damage than warlocks is highly inaccurate.  Your damage depends mostly on your spec but also on your gear.  I have seen a warlock geared in blues out-DPS a mage in full epics.<br>  <br>  That being said, both classes have their benefits.  Warlocks generally are better for survivability while soloing.  Both mages and warlocks are in demand for end game raids and instances, since crowd control is must for most of them and both classes are good at it.<br>  <br>  If it were my choice, I'd go with a warlock.  In my opinion it's easier to level them on your own and after the next patch they will be able to do the quest to get their mount at level 30, as opposed to level 40.  Also, if you're into PvP, or plan on doing battlegrounds, warlocks (if played well) are the wiser choice.|`|FVRDpmCXaa	Go mage! They are the best :( <br>  My first was a druid but mages are what everyone wants... So I rolled one!<br>  They are what every goup wants in a raid or anything else! And they can EASILY farm gold or anythin else in solong! So once again-go mage!|`|pGYe6o1zaa	Mages do more damage, but their spells are very heavy in mana and will pretty much require a mana drink after every fight (you get spells that make drinks, but it's still irritating). I prefer warlocks, but only because I've never really stuck with a mage for very long.

DfPyyDssaa	To jump into a multiplayer match, you need to have the cellphone. (The cell, however, is given to you very early in the storyline, so this shouldn't be a problem.)

8HTmRDTzaa	Have you asked your mom or friend? Usually they can help with the problem. <br>  <br>  Researchers at the University of Rochester and Immersyve Inc. investigated what motivates gamers to continue playing video games. According to lead investigator Richard Ryan, they believe that players play for more reasons than just mere fun. Ryan, a motivational psychologist at Rochester, says that many video games can satisfy some basic psychological needs and often players continue to play because of rewards, freedom, and often a connection with other players.<br>  <br>  Dr. Brody, head of the media committee at the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, puts forth that the addiction to computer games can be caused by psychological problems such as antisocial personality disorder, depression, and phobias such as social phobia. He believes that many addicts want a way to escape reality and then find that they can create a whole new persona on an online game and live their life through their new online personality. Through this they can start to like fantasy life more than reality due to newfound friends and power, and thus, refuse to be drawn away from it.

Tell him to minimize the time he plays, and gradully decrease from 8, to 7, 6, 5, 3, 1, none,etc. Or eventually, he may get bored. Here, some news. <br>  <br>  Researchers at the University of Rochester and Immersyve Inc. investigated what motivates gamers to continue playing video games. According to lead investigator Richard Ryan, they believe that players play for more reasons than just mere fun. Ryan, a motivational psychologist at Rochester, says that many video games can satisfy some basic psychological needs and often players continue to play because of rewards, freedom, and often a connection with other players.<br>  <br>  Dr. Brody, head of the media committee at the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, puts forth that the addiction to computer games can be caused by psychological problems such as antisocial personality disorder, depression, and phobias such as social phobia. He believes that many addicts want a way to escape reality and then find that they can create a whole new persona on an online game and live their life through their new online personality. Through this they can start to like fantasy life more than reality due to newfound friends and power, and thus, refuse to be drawn away from it.

In one period of time in my life, all I did was play WoW. It was getting out of hand, I would play about 12 hours a day sometimes, so bad to where sometimes I wouldn't be able to get up and fix my self something to eat or drink, because I was too busy playing WoW. This caused my family to become very upset, I wasn't close to anyone anymore, all I did was sit on that computer and play hours on end. I did no school work but play WoW, it was horrible, I would stay up until 5:00 or 6:00 AM in the morning, then fall asleep till about 2:00 or 3:00 PM. WoW was taking over my life, I started to become anti-social, never wanting to go anywhere, just sit in my house and play WoW. The only reason I am not on WoW today is, well I am ashamed to admit it, but it is because all my accounts that I have ever owned, were either stolen by somebody, or permanently banned by blizzard. It has been about seven or eight months since I last played the game. I used to play private servers, but now my mom has taken my internet away, I am no longer allowed to have wow installed, my mom even got me a computer that wouldn't be able to hold the game WoW on it so I wouldn't get any ideas, and try and play a private server. Yes, if you are not mature enough to handle the game WoW, it can easily take over a certain individuals life. Some people just don't have the maturity to handle the game WoW, and know when enough is enough, time to take a break, and set down the keyboard and mouse. I myself do not have the maturity to handle the game still at age 16. I really do think WoW should put on their game rating 18+. It is too addicting for some people, no matter what age you are, it can still be addicting. So as for your father he is certainly addicted to the game. It seems as if he does not have enough will power to stop playing so much. I suggest you calmly ask him to quit for the sake of the family. And if he still doesn't. Do what my parents did, even though he is a grown man, this is the best for him, either block his account that he plays on (when i say block i mean cancel the subscription on the account so he cannot play on it anymore) and delete the game WoW on his computer. If it gets bad enough, put a password on his computer, and only let him use it for a little bit, i suggest you have your mom do this, not you since you are only a child, and do not have that much power in the family.|`|yXlnG4Skaa	id take a bat to his computer. and when he gets in your face all angry, bust him out with all these questions:<br>  <br>  - is warcraft more important to you than i am?<br>  - are you getting mad at me because i ruined your game?<br>  - when was the last time we had a father daughter moment?<br>  - do you love me or warcraft more?<br>  - what can i do for you to love me as much as you love warcraft?<br>  <br>  then slowly tear up  and look into his face. he should be quiet for a quick minute thinking about what you said. and it should hit him rock bottem. if all you do is ask him, hes just going to say yeah, uh huh, sure honey. you need to get his attention first, by whooping the SHiSH out of that computer.

6jAJ9ncMaa	The media server would be either your desktop or laptop computer.  If your computer has the capability of media sharing, then you would be able to listen to music stored on your computer and view photos stored on your computer through your PS3.  Your computer does have to be on to use this capability.<br>  <br>  I have Windows Vista and when I 1st hooked up my PS3 and 360, my computer noticed them and asked me if I wanted to authorize these to share my media.<br>  <br>  You do have to make sure that you are connected to the internet and if you have a router, it makes it easier for your computer to recognize your PS3.<br>  <br>  I believe the media sharing works with both Windows XP and Vista.  Good luck.

The PS3 has some good exclusive games, but it's not worth it. A good feature of the ps3 is that it all playstation products have free internet.

Then he speeds up.<br>  <br>  Extra help, on the start, watch the flag holders eyes, when he blinks, Go.  Don't wait for the flag to come down.<br>  When you come up to a hurdle with water after it, do a double jump, Just over the hurdle, and then jump again to speed over the water.  (Don't do this if there's a hurdle right after the water)<br>  When jumping over a hurdle, look to the bottom of the hurdle, you'll see the feet of the hurdle, jump before you come to the feet.

And since wotlk is out burning crusade dungeons are becoming obsolete also.|`|nmcf5bSHaa	i think it works out cheaper to go for the battle chest assuming you'll want to one day own all the expansion packs i cant remember though look on websites such as the game one i cant quote the prices as i cant remember ha 2 weeks of work does that too you|`|d2FJBJ8baa	the latest expansion is wrath of the lich king<br>  <br>  if you already know you will like the game then go all out and get the latest expansion if you just want to try it then get the trial for free|`|DvXVLNLAaa	Battle chest.

(You could use Google to look it up if you wanted to.) It isn't in your gaming console, you can buy some of the games from it using the Wii-channel option or by going to a store and buying the games for it. It just means that Gamecube games and controllers are compatible with your Wii console.<br>  I hope that helps you some.

54sh4vr1aa	THIS IS INFINITY WARDS GAME!!!! Last Time it came out on Ps3 Xbox 360 and Pc...also a lesser version on ds. It will be interesting to see if it is out for the wii. cod 5 has sold very well for wii and online is good, but it was made by treyarch not infinity ward. I own a Wii and would like to see it be made and there is a 50-50 chance. Hopefully IW is paying atention to the people and will make this game!!!|`|ENu9pYZmaa	well mi gess iz<br>  for the ps3 and 360<br>  maybi the wii...<br>  im knot sure <br>  it depends on the developers|`|E2FALlxraa	More than likely PC, XBOX 360, and PS3. And I'm pretty sure its Call of Duty: 5 not Modern Warfare 2. Call of Duty: WAW is NOT Call of Duty: 5 this has been stated by the creators.

BpXbNjEpaa	Fishing!  Fishing may seem slower then picking fruit, but it makes so much more profit, the time is a non-issue.  A full pocket of fish is easily 5000 bells, whereas fruit is only 1500.  If you have foreign fruit, though, the profits are about equal.  Fishing can fill in while you wait for fruit to grow back, though.|`|tnQGOsaeaa	COLLECT SHELLS THEY ARE ALL ALONG THE COAST! EASY MONEY!|`|w94WNRcdaa	SELL TURNIPS- On sundays at 6:00 to 12:00 find a lady with a big sack on her back. Ask her about red turnips. Then buy one. They usually cost 1000 bells. Then plant and water EVERY DAY. Then sell to Tom Nook for 16,000 bells!<br>  <br>  FESTIVAL DAY- On 11/26/09 starting at 3:00 go to the mayor at the town hall. He will give you utensils. Go find the turkey guy and give him utensils in exchange for gifts. Go back to town hall and he will ask you to deliver more utensils. Don't deliver them give them to turkey guy for more stuff. He is in different places each time you get utensils. <br>  <br>  SPECIAL ROCK-Every day there is one rock with money in it. Hit it with your shovel as fast as you can for money.<br>  <br>  PLAT COCONUTS- Find a coconut on the beach and plant them on the beach. They sell for about 500 bells each.<br>  <br>  CHRISTMAS- After 8pm find the reindeer in a santa suit. He gives you stuff.<br>  <br>  Hope this helped!|`|134qODTGaa	If you are will to time travel you can change ur time to May/June or July...alot of big money fish are there, and also if you have alot of coconut trees there are also all the beetles that are worth 5000 on up.  Thats how I made alot of money.  Also you can sell turnips, I have also made a good fortune in them.  If you are will to time travel, you can always go to Sunday and get turnips on a day that I have good prices and them you can come over and sell them.  If you are intrested you can email me ur infor...kafars2003@yahoo.com|`|ZfXEi14Caa	Go to a friends town and get a different fruit than what you have, plant them as trees,wait or change the time for three days,empty your pockets,then put all of the fruit in your pocket and sell it too Nook.<br>  other fruits are 500bells each and a pocket full of them are 7,500.<br>  <br>  hope this helps ^__^|`|IH9t8ZDAaa	keep picking fruit of trees and sell it to the shop keeper. you could fish as well... but thats slower. Just pick fruit off the trees and sell them to the shop keeper until you have a FORTUNE! hope this helps!
XrGFZ2LJaa	Hi.<br>  <br>  Currently, no details have been released about the "Native Americans" being an unlockable/starting faction.<br>  <br>  ---------------------------Playable country's from the start----------------------------<br>  <br>  There are 12 playable nations in the BEGINNING, and at the moment 11 have been confirmed. This means that the "Native Americans" could be eligible to take the last remaining place, although this is very unlikely.<br>  <br>  * Great Britain<br>  * France<br>  * Spain<br>  * Prussia<br>  * Poland - Lithuanian Commonwealth<br>  * Ottoman Empire<br>  * Austria<br>  * United Provinces (Dutch)<br>  * Russia<br>  * Sweden<br>  * Marathas<br>  * Unknown?<br>  <br>  ---------------------------Unlockable Empires-----------------------------<br>  <br>  If the "Native Amercans" aren't chosen as a starting faction, they may be unlockable. For instance, if you were playing as the British and you defeated the "Native Americans", they will be unlocked. When this happens, you can go back to the 'Grand Campaign Menu' and the "Native Americans" will be available to play as. <br>  <br>  It's worth noting that most tribes probably won't be playable at all. It depends on Creative Assembly and Sega's decision on who to implement as influential and interesting factions.

RZBYJHtyaa	For some reason shooting up strip clubs never gets old......one might venture to check out the tall pointe building in San Fierro for basejumping......Body bags in the desert......I never pass up a chance to break into the Air base......The big hanger housing the AT-400 aircraft in Las Venturas promises good times......An other gangs turf while wearing green never gets old......The police headquarters in Las Ventura is HUGE and is a JOY to shoot up.|`|4LtszRxEaa	Love that game Las ventturas to hit the casinos. Los Santos to cruise around and shoot ballas and Vagos ridas. Uh I personally hated Whetstone. Uh hit the airport in San Fierro and grab a plane or heli. See how long you can survve while trying to get the highest wanted level. Hit the Santa Maria Beach and grab a boat or bike and driveby the beach or just grab a motorcycle and hit the highway. Piss off the cops with a rocket launchers. Tear up The casinos with any gun in your arsenal. Do robberys that game is great.
AA10595247	Since Vista is such a memory hog, you need at least 2.4 ghz to run Apartment Life, especially if you have other expansions. Of course that's just the minimum. A faster processor is always better.
L2QAdBUXaa	I play a lot on Nazi Zombies on my Ps3 and from past experience i had the same problem as you, i got to level 29 and it said i only got to level 17, anyway it could down to a number of reasons, however the main is if you glitch, as far as i know if you glitch (because of the new patch it says u got 0 as a score and reached lvl 1) or another reason is that at the level you glitched it says you got that far. However it could just be random as well or as previous people have said u may have been signed out of the PSN staright after for maybe you quit before it finished. Unfortunately this is the only info i can supply as this one is a mystery. This is the first time i have heard of it but i will try and find anymore info which might help and if i do i will post it here.<br>  <br>  Anyway hope it gets fixed soon ^_^ ^_^ ^_^ Hope this helps|`|dqeOMqyPaa	PS3's have slow live and it has to be updated. then it will have ur current record.|`|H15jc7YBaa	It's quite possible it hasn't been updated yet.

PTovC2Dqaa	I would probably think Xion is Aqua's Nobody, just like Sora's Nobody is Roxas and Kairi's Nobody is Namine. Aqua is a character that will be seen a lot in Kingdom Hearts Birth By Sleep.<br>  <br>  To be honest, I have no idea why Venn looks exactly like Roxas. I'm 100% sure it will be explained in Kingdom Hearts Birth By sleep when it is released in the United States.|`|vtJDHJDYaa	No one knows it yet, only the creators knows it. I think Xion is the half Nobody of Kairi. We all know that Kairi has already have Namine as her Nobody. But what if Kairi's Nobody split into two by accident? That means Xion is the dark part of Kairi's Nobody while Namine is the light part of Kairi's Nobody. At the Square-Enix press conference DK∑3713, she was revealed in a trailer to wield the Kingdom Key and to have connections to both Naminé and Kairi.<br>  <br>  Little is known about her role in the game. She has now shown up twice: once in Twilight Town, where she aided Roxas and Axel, and again in Beast's Castle, where she and Riku had a verbal showdown. A recent Famitsu article has stated that she has a "tragic but brave fate." Axel was quoted saying that Xion often tries to escape, and he always brings her back. This suggests that Xion is not in the Organization on her own will, but is forcibly kept a member. There is still no confirmation on her powers, though she's revealed to look and sound like Kairi and have black hair, dark skin, and blue eyes.<br>  <br>  Xion (シオン, Shion?) is a new member that will be introduced in the upcoming game Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days. She has dark hair and wields a Keyblade. Xion was first shown in trailers for the new game and has also made brief appearances in demos. She was first believed to have been Naminé, but Nomura later informed the press it was a different character. The character's name was not revealed until summer 2008.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://kingdomhearts.wikia.com/wiki/Xion" rel="nofollow">http://kingdomhearts.wikia.com/wiki/Xion</a><br>  <br>  2. Because Sora's Nobody, Roxas, bears an uncanny resemblance with Ven, it appears that he has some kind of connection with Sora. However, it is currently still unconfirmed what that connection might be. His resemblance to Roxas could also be connected to Xion, the 14th Organization member, as it has been speculated that she may have a connection to Kairi, Naminé and Aqua. His full name 'Ventus' in Latin means 'wind'. and 'Sora' in Japanese means 'sky'. His wristband and shirt (under his armor) are very similar to the ones that Roxas wears during his stay at Twilight Town. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://kingdomhearts.wikia.com/wiki/Ven" rel="nofollow">http://kingdomhearts.wikia.com/wiki/Ven</a>|`|2CVc3y7aaa	1.I don't know who Xion's second half is. <br>  2.And i don't know why Ven looks like Roxas hehe<br>  but I'm waiting to find out for myself when KH:BBS comes out with anticipation.  It will just make the game so much more meaningful to find out for myself on the actual game. <br>  <br>  Rock on and help make more Kingdom Hearts fans!! woot woot!|`|ZpB1Ik8Faa	The only people who know the answer to those questions are the game makers, so you'll just have to wait for the games...why would you want the surprise ruined anyways?|`|MYEoC9Ryaa	some pepole say kairi has 2 nobodys do to being a heartless twice<br>  <br>  1.in the first story she was controlling the shadows<br>  <br>  2. when kairi helped sora as a heartless(kh1)|`|dF2IWZpgaa	You dont find out about Xion if i remember right sorry to spoil it but he dies later<br>  <br>  Dunno about the second one to be honest but Roxas and Sora are connected youll find out why nearer the end

ArKT9O7Maa	I have one recommendation.<br>  The Legend of Zelda: The Phantom Hourglass.<br>  It's fun, makes you think, and combines puzzles, action, adventure, and good ole' hack-n'-slash, except instead of button mashing, you are stylus-slashing.<br>  It helps if you have played The Legend of Zelda: The Windwaker for the Nintendo GAMECUBE before, but at the start of the game there is a general synopses of the game.<br>  It even includes an online Battle mode.  Great buy.|`|eeGjzAAcaa	Final Fantasy 3 that is an amazing game.

SSbeC1Xxaa	Legend of Heroes is meets most of those except for the god/goddess thing. Most of anything by Square Enix is good. Dynasty Warriors 2 (NOT the first one because it sucks really badly) however it is a real time fighting RPG rather than turn based.<br>  <br>  Pretty much there go all hopes of any good PSP RPG games (actually PSP games in general). If you have a hacked (custom firmware) PSP then you could put on an emulator and play games for GBA/PSX/GBC and other outdated systems but it takes a little computer knowledge to get going, but past that it's pretty easy.<br>  <br>  The PSP is really meant for older people (like the XBOX 360) and lots of the games that come out for it are rated T or M. There are very few good games that have come out for the PSP that are rated E (I can't think of any besides N+).<br>  <br>  Seriously...no final fantasy games.....geez. See if they'll let you get FF Tactics: War of the Lions, because that one is not very violent and FF Tactics Advance is even less violent (FFTWotL is T and FFTA is E). My parents didn't let me play any FF games until I was 13 or so, bugged the heck out of me (same with Silent Hill).

1vFjmnCHaa	The 2600 is an 8-bit console, not 4-bit.  Not sure where you got that idea.  The 2600 uses the 8-bit 6507 cpu.  People often confuse the graphics capabilities of a system's graphics chips with the "bitness" of the system.  Hence the Atari 2600, Atari 5200, Atari 7800, Colecovision, NES, etc. are all 8-bit systems, but with different graphics capabilities.|`|u0ydx14Yaa	hell yeah.its just a good way to get away from everything else..|`|E8gMdvoaaa	old games suck. like the gameboys and the little cheap old games. this is 2009 they need to make touch screen systems or something amazing! they should make a system that has a remote the size of a button and you put it on your finger  ( with strap ) and it will be kind of like a wii. except you dont have to hold nothing, you just move your finger around.

1z85pCUpaa	Yes. Each Webkinz has a code that will expire a year after their log in. However, if you adopt a second, third, fourth (etc.) pet, then the expiration date will extend to the expiration date of your most recent pet. All your Webkinz will be put on the most recent's pet expiration date. This is kind of confusing, so here's an example.<br>  I adopt a frog on April 13 2006. The frog's expiration date is April 13 2007.<br>  Then I adopt a penguin on June 6 2006. Both the frog's and the penguin's dates extend to June 6 2007.

It will not be able to, and may lock up your computer.<br>  OTHERWISE<br>  1b) If it's a PC disk, it will try and probably will autoload.<br>  <br>  2) If you can even access your console disk, which you most likely cannot, hitting delete on files will bring up a copyguard error.<br>  OTHERWISE<br>  2b) Hitting delete will bring up a copyguard error.<br>  <br>  On game disks (CDs and DVDs), the data is burned permanently.

hplJxGa2aa	Well if you want more of a GAME, you could get The Sims 2. It is pretty much a game, but it has a built in video recorder tool that lets you record video of your sims, then you can edit the video and make it into a movie. Here is an AMAZING example of a movie made with The Sims 2.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.sims99.com/movie_details.php?dir=Jpro07&id=12054" rel="nofollow">http://www.sims99.com/movie_details.php?...</a><br>  <br>  But if you want something a little more dedicated to making movies, you could try out the game, The Movies. You basically start a movie making business, hire actors, make sets, and a bunch of other stuff. Plus, you can edit the clips that you recorded either in the game, or with something like Windows Movie Maker or Sony Vegas. Here is a link to The Movies.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.gamespot.com/pc/strategy/movies/index.html?tag=result;title;4" rel="nofollow">http://www.gamespot.com/pc/strategy/movi...</a>

xvr5nK9aaa	I hate that place, it pretty long and a bit spooky, there's zombies, ghosts, you need to use your wolf form a lot...  I'm not sure exactly how you get through it, I mean I did it like 5 months ago, but there's a lot of guides that can help you.  The worst things are the beetle that hang onto you (there's spirit ones and small ones -.-) and the quick sand.<br>  <br>  The boss is annoying, you have to use the spinner (your new item that lets you go on sand for a little while and lets you cling onto tracks on the side of structures) to hit it in it's spin, but he sends indestructible zombie minions that block your path.  Once you hit him 3 times he'll become a flying head (lol!!!) that will shoot fire balls at you, but you will have tracks to cling on to (with your spinner) to allow you to hit him, once you catch up with him (and you have to jump to the other side if he attacks you).  <br>  <br>  And try gamespot, I used their guides for all my games.
lqQbVk2Daa	Nope there is now way. The only way is to buy a game called clubpenguin elite force ds but it doesnt get you to the web. It just gets you to a dc gamer thing website.

rEZ2oO5Daa	It sound like you are describing Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic.<br>  <br>  You become a Jedi after you get off the first planet, Taris, and during the game you look for Star Maps leading you to the main bad guy, Darth Malak. It features the characters Carth, Mission, Zalbaar, Bastila, Juhani, Canderous, Jolee, HK-47, and T3-M4.<br>  <br>  Although, you may be thinking of Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic 2: The Sith Lords. <br>  <br>  In this game,you wake up on Peragus, and slowly get your Jedi Powers back and your lightsaber over the course of the game. You look for the last of the Jedi on different worlds. It features the characters Kreia, Atton, Handmaiden, Disciple, Mira, Hanhaar, Mandalore, Bao-Dur, Visas Marr, G0-T0, T3-M4 and an option to get the same character from the original KOTOR, HK-47. The main bad guys this time are Darth Sion and Darth Nihilus.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps, Leigh.|`|gAjtiPXHaa	ikm not sure if it was on the PS2 but you might be thinking of Star Wars: knights of the old republic its based some time ago before episode 1. you start of as a soldier on a republic ship that is under attack by the sith forces and as you move along you make great discovories and friends and will even become a jedi. you can have 2 other members in your party that you can switch back and forth that way you can focus all of the characters attacks on a really hard monster or have 1 character fight one thing the other fighting another and your main fighting the boss

UoxracOPaa	All you need is the original game to play, If you want to lvl past 60 then your going to The Burning Crusade to get to 70, and Wrath of the Lich King to get to 80. You don't need to waste your money and buy them all at once. I recommend just getting the original and BC so you can be all the races.|`|QYbMxFE0aa	read this question and its answers.. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AlKxGkZHEK.taitcQTRq72rsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090220141901AAhK1vb">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  <br>  Dont play it unless you want to be one of those pathetic guys that pretty much eat drink and sleep W.O.W. seriously. my EXboyfriend got addicted to that game when we were together.. (hints the EX part) this game will consume your life and you will become nothing. its sad. go outside and play catch instead. or go read a book. why get addicted to something that you know ahead of time is going to pull you in.. Even that guy up there said "IF" you can manage your time.. haha <br>  <br>  good luck!|`|3AaFXTbTaa	Wolfex hit the nail on the head. Give him best answer|`|zFZ2EAsmaa	haha I have no idea! (:|`|P6q0RUVDaa	Dont listen to all this no life crap if you can play and manage your time you will be just fine :). And yes all you need is the original copy, but once you start to understand the game and get to level 60, you will need BC (first expansion), which gives much more new content and you can get to level 70. I would suggest getting the first copy, then play it for a while. If you really like it and decide it is going to be a game you will play, buy all three. Maybe you can download, the 10 day free trial off of worldofwarcraft.com, to see if you like it. Hope this helps|`|kthrNyAdaa	well the first thing i would do if i were you is download the trial version.<br>  <br>  this way you can at least try out the game. if you dont want to do that.<br>  <br>  all you really need to do is for about 40 bucks go and get the battle chest that comes with original, and burning crusade.  if you dont want to do that you can get just regular WoW.  how ever as mentioned you level cap will only be 60 with original.  70 with burning crusade (and you get blood elves and draenei), then 80 with Lich King.<br>  <br>  also with burning crusade you are able to raise your profession cap to 375, with lich king it goes to 450.<br>  <br>  also with burning crusdae you get the entire continent of Outlands, with Lich king you get Northrend. (Azuremyst and Bloodmyst Isle - Draenei starting areas: Eversong woods and Ghostlands Blood Elf Starting Areas)<br>  <br>  with Lich King you get Death Knights (hero class which can only be made after you get a level 55 character on at least 1 realm, they start off in the plaguelands.<br>  <br>  with the original you just get Eastern Kingdoms and Kalimdor|`|crZg76Hpaa	You're going to have to quit your life

Green=good site, Yellow= okay site, Red= a ripoff site that will most likely give you a Trojan. good luck!
sYiW1oi0aa	I'm going to let you know up front that I don't work for Game Stop.. I just do a lot of business with them.. So this is purely a semi-well educated guesstimate.. <br>  <br>  Altogether, you're probably looking at $285 to $300.. Here's a short explanation:<br>  <br>  You have roughly $140 in games (estimating roughly $20 per game).. <br>  <br>  We'll say $10 for the wireless controller. (They'll mostly likely refurb it and bag it up separately, as most of their 360s are resold with wired controllers but the price difference between the consoles with wired/wireless controllers is about $10 so they'll probably give you at least that..)<br>  <br>  You'll probably get about $100 to $135 for the console with hard-drive.. (Again, they'll most likely refurb it and sell the hard drive separately so that's about $100 for the console and $20-$35 for the hard-drive.)<br>  <br>  You probably already know you'll get more if you trade for store credit instead of cash, even more if you're an Edge member and you can take advantage of GameStop's trade-in offers.. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.gamestop.com/gs/specialty/tradeins/offers.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.gamestop.com/gs/specialty/tra...</a><br>  <br>  I could be off by a few bucks but, again, I don't work for 'em so all of the above is just a pretty-well-educated guess.. You'd probably do better by making a list of what you've got and stopping by or calling your local GameStop.. <br>  <br>  Have a good weekend..|`|qD66OFglaa	I dont know why your selling that but anyway call gamestop or funcoland they will tell you.|`|R5jASl9Yaa	cex.co.uk is a pawn shop for games you can get a good price there|`|JRYyFQd2aa	I would say somewhere in the $400-$600+ Price Range. Thats the TRUE Value, however a gamestore/pawnshop will only give you roughly half of that. It depends though on where you take it in for trade, and what they are willing to offer you. However, if you interested in getting Money and/or in-store credit i would recommend going to gamestop.|`|lOuz0nU2aa	They'll give you around a hundred American dollars.|`|e308c155c93252697134bf8ee94d03e7aa	call your local gamestop!!<br>  <br>  i traded in a ps2 and like 20 games and got about $175|`|47ddda29b6896ce72acab50c6bef43fdaa	Heres what I would do:<br>  <br>  Go to www.ign.com, sign up for an account, then go into your account, then to My Collection, and add everything you have to the list. It should give you a good figure. My guess is that your net worth is around $275.

lOuz0nU2aa	Yeah, the full version should work if the trial version of CoD4. Because that would mean that your laptop is compatible with CoD4.|`|EOzxtPrSaa	if the trial works then the full game should work to because your laptop is compatible  with call of duty 4|`|gAjtiPXHaa	idk but you can go to Isohunt.com and try and find it cause it is free and yes it is pirating|`|rEZ2oO5Daa	If the trial worked then that means you have at least the minimum specs for CoD4 to work.<br>  <br>  If you buy the full version of CoD4 it will work just as well as the trial version.

My other tops are like level 50 and such.|`|qoUsPrY2aa	Depnds were you are in the game cuz b4 i got all the legendrys i had like lvl 60s at like the 5th badge cuz i just trained them but its a good team befcause you kept them the same.

3JwFqiWsaa	I think you should uninstall the demo from control panel remove programs then install it the actual game.. i think but i know you need the game to play not the demo.|`|Ukw1JUNcaa	I think what you need to do is just upgrade your account with the CD key you got when you bought the actual game. Logging on to worldofwarcraft.com and looking under the "manage account" options should give you a choice to upgrade your account to the full WotLK version.<br>  <br>  If that doesn't work or if you're unsure just reinstall the entire game... but it's a long, arduous process that I don't recommend if you can avoid it. Good luck.|`|B1gSrhCnaa	i think u installed it w/ the demo<br>  u should need WoW itself, BC, and WOTLK all to play it. was the demo for an account trial?--u should need all 3 but mybe they doing something new now (?)

I'm just wondering because I did that one time with Lost Odyssey, I wasn't paying attention and signed in as a different person and then thought all my stuff was gone. Maybe just double-check to be safe.|`|tlEMsiHwaa	i dont know whay your complainig about finding skulls and beating it on legendary because thats super easy.<br>  <br>  You cant burn a game into the xbox360 only install in the nxe (new xbox experience)<br>  <br>  What happened is what bungie warns you about, a message pops up saying DONT INSTALL THIS GAME INTO HARDRIVE VIA NXE, this is because the games was purley coded (made) to run of the dvd drive in the xbox.<br>  <br>  But if you do it it wont delete your halo3 online acc this can only happen if you get banned by the banhammer,<br>  <br>  another reason nothing comes up on the game is because the xbox thinks youve taken your gamer tag on a removable device to another xbox to be uploaded to it, or it thinks youve taken you gamer tag to a freinds place to play against him/her so unless the freind or you has completed halo 3 on the hardrive will it come up on the game. <br>  <br>  Also are you trying this online with a gold membership or ofline.

The First part of the mythic maps look really good though you can go on bungie.net or ign or any game site really and look into information i know that 1up.com has gameplay videos and sandbox is HUGE! and sorry i couldnt provide links but im unable to do that right now so sadly your on your own with that well have fun with the maps when they come out<br>  <br>  AX|`|tlEMsiHwaa	this is the first pack of the mythic series that comes out via xbl or the special edition halo wars, the last pack is to be released with the special edition halo3- odst or xbl. not to sure when the second will be released. and there are three map packs in the mythic series or maybe more depending on what bungie decides on halo3-odst.
GLrE1VWQaa	It depends on how often you use your DS lite and how often you think you would use the DSi. I have a DS lite but am definitely looking forward to upgrading mine in April. The DSi looks brilliant and has some great new features that some will enjoy and others won't. I certainly hope I will, but perhaps if you already own a good camera and an mp3 then you might not use these features on the DSi so much and would then benefit more from saving your money for something more useful to you. Hope this helps x|`|i6uzNQcJaa	stick with real consoles, like xbox 360's or ps3's.  graphics and gameplay are horrible on handhelds.  ive owned a ds lite for a bit over a year, and i havent touched it in almost 3 months b/c the games are so crappy!|`|HLbWpsjuaa	it seems slightly pointless dont you think??<br>  the games are the same,the price will cost more, its a tiny bit smaller and it has a shitty 0.3 megapixel camera...its very pointless, i dont know who will buy it especially since its pretty much exactly the same as the ds lite|`|4FvK8XaJaa	Yes, it's worth upgrading.

I had characters on both sides and I found the Horde folks to be a lot more mature, which especially comes in handy when you're actually playing instances with them.<br>  I played a lot of different races, and there really isn't a "best" race. They all have different pros and cons; for example some races don't let you be certain classes. They all have a unique ability; for example, night elves have an ability where they can be invisible even if they aren't a rogue. I would suggest looking up all the abilities for the races and picking which you like the best.<br>  In terms of servers, it doesn't really matter. There are 4 types: PVP, RPG, PVP RPG, and then normal ones. RPG servers have everyone talking like their character so it's more immersive. PVP means that someone from the opposite faction can kill you at any moment, where in a normal server they can only kill you at certain times.|`|MsqINb58aa	If you want a faster and easier way to get level 80 or need better PvP gear, I recommend getting in touch with the U.S. company Yeh! for Games, Inc., you can give them a call at 702-425-8654 or just google yeh for games to get their website.  They are based in Nevada State so it is very safe and reliable, unlike all the other unsafe websites that are from foreign countries.  My friend got them to level his death knight to level 80 and was one of the first 80s on his server.  I am planning to get the new PvP arena gear and have them run Naxx for my Tier 8 gear.

You can also buy packs of webkinz cards for around 2.50 that comes with a code for extra free stuff for your online pet.  We have even won a free pet in a pack of cards.

L6v7jDV8aa	Runescape:<br>  Hi I would not suggest it sir. Java is awfully slow for any 3D purposes you want done since its crappy and easy. (beginners language) though there is better programs you can get free. I'll show you how to make a game like runescape in a computer EXE format instead of a website since its easier but what I show you should explain how you might do it in any programming language. First of all, get yourself DEV c++ which is at:<br>  <a href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/dev-cpp/devcpp-4.9.9.2_setup.exe" rel="nofollow">http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/dev-c...</a><br>  ______________________________________...<br>  <br>  After that get yourself the DirectX SDK which is for exporting 3D models in the X format to work with C++ (very basic function) It is at:<br>  <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/Downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=fd044a42-9912-42a3-9a9e-d857199f888e&displaylang=en&Hash=MYIMxyBuNCy4aPj1viJ3QODj3rawBZechpIQZCRcPCV2J2obGcWjt0T40DSzwwmCe8f3153vlUuypTNbQ2jaYA%3d%3d" rel="nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/Downloads/detai...</a><br>  ______________________________________...<br>  <br>  After that get yourself a 3D modeling program that exports in the X format. (sorry you'll have to get that one yourself buddy but a free one you can get off of lime wire illegally and I won't say the link for legal purposes)<br>  ______________________________________...<br>  <br>  Now you got 95% of what you need! What are you missing. A E-BOOK. Don't worry, a 10 year old kid can start from this book. It teaches you how to make a C++ game and it starts slowly from text programs and less then 1000 pages. *NOTE* (Don't use the c++ compiler it tells you in the book, just use DEV C++'s it comes with the DEV c++ program. Ok here is the link to the E-book which you need adobe reader for:<br>  <a href="http://reporttime.zoomshare.com/files/C_Programming_for_the_Absolute_Beginner.rar" rel="nofollow">http://reporttime.zoomshare.com/files/C_...</a>|`|bfsym1dsaa	Lol. People that made RuneScape took about a decade to make the game until how it is today. You'll need to learn transaction, website programming, hosting, game programming (Java or Flash at best for Online), then manage it all, plus come up with ideas... If you're planning on doing that all yourself, you'll die first...<br>  <br>  Hiring people and create a company like Jagex requires knowledge. I'm sure the people from Jagex went to college.<br>  <br>  If you're not planning on going to college, I doubt this is really achievable, unless you have a miraculous god-given ability...|`|FClS1j7Yaa	go to college learn how to manage a business. get a large staff of hundreds of people, including programmers, artists, musicians, managers, finance people, advertising, etc etc.  and you'll need some starting cash. a couple million should be enough to get a facility, some servers, and hire all those people. after that its smooth sailing.|`|l6HbPCHGaa	not possible. Runescape was created and is still maintained by a TEAM of people, all of whom most likely went to college.

I can just start from the last checkpoint.  No problems. It doesn't have an option to save anywhere in the game on the 360. Same for PS3 right?  Should save automatically. Maybe you didn't get far enough for that to happen.

ysiE6IDjaa	Okay, I'm sorry about your neighbourhoods and families, but this will often happen after a bad shutdown.There are things you can try to fix it but the first thing you have to address is the reason your laptop is shutting down. The number one cause is usually that it is overheating. It is basically shutting down to prevent damage to the motherboard.<br>  Your game could be contributing to this. Apartment Life has very high graphics requirements and if you do not have a high-end graphics card your laptop's graphics processor unit (gpu) may be overworked. This could well be the major cause of the problems you are experiencing. The consequences of overheating laptops can be quite serious. Your computer can be damaged, and may end up requiring expensive replacement of major system components, such as motherboards or graphic cards. So follow this guide first to try and resolve the reason your laptop is overheating:<a href="http://www.laptop-overheating.com/cures-laptop-overheating" rel="nofollow">http://www.laptop-overheating.com/cures-...</a><br>  <br>  You should also determine whether your laptop actually meets the requirements to play Apartment Life. You will find them here: <a href="http://www.sims2wiki.info/wiki.php?" rel="nofollow">http://www.sims2wiki.info/wiki.php?</a><br>  title=Game_Help:System_Requirements/MT...<br>  <br>  If it doesn't, there is no way you should be playing that game on that laptop. You risk damaging your machine forever if you haven't already done so.

8vyCtRuQaa	I wish it was as easy as you just said. Unfortunately you can only watch file share videos on the xbox itself.  Those videos that you make are just long lines of code that tell the halo 3 engine to recreate what happened. It is not actually a video.  If you want to put your videos on youtube, you need something called a capture card.  Google that and you will find plenty of options.  A capture card connects to your computer and has the red yellow and white inputs that your xbox has.  You'll have to start recording on your computer and then using the xbox, play the video. <br>  <br>  Long story short... you need a capture card to get the video from your file share.

6GIrW5eWaa	Downloadable content<br>  On February 10, 2009, Activision and Treyarch announced that downloadable content (DLC) was under development for World at War. The first installment of DLC will include four new multiplayer maps. Nightfire takes place in the ravaged streets of Berlin, Knee Deep involves several destructible Japanese fortifications, and Station consists of the damaged remnants of a U-Bahn (underground rapid transit system). The fourth map, titled Verrückt (German for crazy), is an addition to the Nacht der Untoten map on Nazi Zombies mode, and includes new weapons and power-ups intended to expand the experience. The DLC pack will be released in March 2009 for the Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360 versions of the game.[|`|Fgl1SbjTaa	yep

q0EwnYroaa	There are a couple of methods (double point needles, magic loop, circular needle)    The default recipe for knitting a flat circle from the center outwards is: Increase at 8 points, evenly spaced, every other row. This makes an octagon rather than a true circle, but in most knitting, this is close enough.    here's a link to making flat circle   http://knit-amigurumi.blogspot.com/2008/...    or    start by casting on 8 stitches (and divide over dpns or circs as you like)  row 1: * k1, m1 * rep to end  row 2 and all even rows: knit all stitches  row 3: * k2, m1 * rep to end  row 5: * k3, m1 * rep to end  row 7: * k4, m1 * rep to end    and so on, increasing by one knit stitch each odd round. What youll wind up with is eight sections, spiraling out into a circle (somewhat like nautilus hat )- make it however large you like.   To keep the stockinette edges from curling under, Id finish off with 3-4 ish rows of garter or moss stitch.|`|22oMednCaa	There are three common methods:  1) Using four or five double-pointed needles.  2) Using two circular needles.  3) Using one circular needle (the "Magic Loop" method).    See here for video tutorials of all three moethods:  http://www.knittinghelp.com/videos/advan...    The Magic Loop method ( 3) seems to be most popular.  Method  2 is good for large circles.|`|154dzJ1Faa	There is only two ways to knit a circle: start from the centre and work out, or start from the outside edge, and work in to the middle.    I don't really understand how you are doing this.  But it appears you have the blanket finished, and you are going to applique a circle to the fabric?  You can start with 4 stitches on 4 needles (I usually start with 8) and then increase 4 stitches every round until it is the size you need, and bind off. That is the general principle that works.    You can also cast-on a circle of stitches all around the outside in the size you need.  Then you would decrease 4 times every round, until you are down to 8.  Pull the tail through all stitches and tie off.    You can make several sizes of circles and sew one inside the other for a 3D flower. Put a button in the middle.|`|WbJPQM1naa	I made a Pi shawl, from Elizabeth Zimmerman's pattern.  You start with three stitches on three DP needles, k1, make one the next round, then knit those six stitches for three rounds, the k1, make one around until the stitches are doubled.  Then knit for six rounds.  K1, Make 1 and double your circumference again.  Knit around 12 rounds.      If you follow this circular pattern around and around, increasing to double the stitches around and then doubling the rows from the previous increase, you can, in theory,knit a circle big enough to cover a football field!  But, who would want to do that!  LOL    Anyway, this is based upon the mathematical function of Pi and is a very easy way to make a circle as well as makes a LOVELY shawl for you in lace or jumper weight wool.  I get SO many compliments on mine!    Here is EZ's book where you can find the Pi shawl pattern.  It's really very easy once you start!    http://www.amazon.com/Elizabeth-Zimmerma...    Here's some other's knitter's finished shawls to inspire you!  http://www.madisonknittersguild.org/pish...    This blog has step by step instructions for another type of circular beginning.    http://fleeglesblog.blogspot.com/2007/08...    Good luck with your project and I'd love to pics when you finish!  OH, and EZ's "surprise" jacket is a great, easy and intriguing knit project.  When you finish, the only seams are under the arms!  It's great fun!    Knit on with confidence!  R
LRmMk9Cyaa	all games give Zchivements, but none really give more or less, they all usually give the same, but its way more than one per game b/c i went from 800 to 1920 zchivements while playing vector mazer a few times|`|LBp9TZm4aa	There are no games you can play that can earn you zchievements. Sorry! Well, you'll like, earn one of those when you play 1 game. You can also earn zchievements by traveling all around zwinktopia.

In low grade the sell for .50 and as the grade gets higher the value goes up. In circulated grades .50 to $10 .|`|5QQbJ9Cdaa	Maybe you can check the Canadian Mint website.

(that's what I do anyway lol"|`|LVIwicSlaa	It really depends on what level your Pokemon are. You wil need some strong fire and flying moves for the first battle. For the second, water and grass moves are the best. The third battle is best if you use water as well as fighting and for the fourth battle, you will need mostly dark and ghost moves, and a fire move. You should use ice, fire, grass and electric for the Champion's battle.     Your team should be ok as long as they are between Lv 50 - 60|`|zzSPobgyaa	well tht seems like a gd team 8/10  but no sort of pokemon tht will save u from trouble or major defence so torterra for a sceptile will provide more speed along with sp.att thn crobat for skarmory|`|i5gyPSCSaa	Well overall it's 7/10.
