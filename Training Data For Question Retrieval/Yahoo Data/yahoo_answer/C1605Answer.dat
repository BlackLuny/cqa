h4bg0uHZaa	In high school I had to pay my own way to go with the French club to Paris.  Back then (9 years or so ago) it was a little less than 2000 for the trip.  Now I expect it is much more.  However I did a couple things to raise money.  First I asked for both my birthday and Christmas not to receive any gifts except cash towards my trip.  I set up candy display at my parents work (easy to do and cheap investment).  I also did 2 car washes with friends looking to go as well.  The biggest thing that helped pay for it was I got an after school job and really worked as much as I possibly could.  Overtime eats into your social life but sometimes you need to remind yourself why you are doing this.  It ended up being totally worth it.  Enjoy Paris and the French language.

wqP8ACpBaa	I know for a non-Filipino it is kind of confusing, in fact it is also confusing for Filipinos. And I still do not understand why all these numbers plus one more which the Philippine government  have always pushed for, called the National ID number.<br>  <br>  But I will try to explain as far as I understand it, the SSS number & the TIN number are just a bunch of numbers assigned to Filipinos & being out of the country so long I do not even know how many numbers are there although I think the TIN number has fewer digits than the SSS number. The SSS number, any adult Filipino can apply for it & obtain one. The TIN I remember, your first employer applies for you, unless they changed the procedures since I was in the Philippines.<br>  <br>  The SSS number you use much like the Social Security number in the US. Although if you work for the Philippine government sector you use another kind of Social Security which is called GSIS, thus you use a GSIS number instead of a SSS number. Yes, that is a third number. And we are not even going to touch on another number, called the Pag-ibig Number.<br>  <br>  Anyway, the TIN number is a more encompassing number because all Filipino taxpayers have one of this (regardless if the work in the private or the public sector). This number they use to file their income tax returns each year. Of course there is one for corporate entities & they use that for their tax purposes as well. Yes much like the SS number in the USA.<br>  <br>  I hope that is confusing enough for you.|`|kChkYYaRaa	TIN - taxpayers identification number - for tax purposes when you pay the BIR<br>  <br>  SSS # - if you're working in the private sector, you're assigned a number. if you're in govt service you get GSIS #.<br>   this number is impt so you can get benefits or apply for loans.|`|dNmf3klraa	SSS (Social Security System) number- insurance from private employees <br>  TIN (Taxpayer's Identification Number)- before you start working, you are required to get a TIN number from the BIR (Bureau of Internal Revenue) for tax purposes<br>  <br>  Both of these numbers are found in your Personal Data sheets or Bio-data.
xIHgTqVhaa	I've been living in France almost 13 years. <br>  <br>  It's too general a question to answer sufficiently. <br>  <br>  I miss the friendliness and the customer service aspects of the U.S. <br>  <br>  In France, you have to learn a lot of their superficial rituals like saying "Bonjour" before speaking to someone. I'm kind of used to the cheek-pecking routine. I don't like changing between the "vous" (formal you) and "tu" (familar you). I forget that we changed and keep calling them "vous"! <br>  <br>  The language is key. There is no way around it. They're also fussy about their language and wont understand a slightest error (and may not be very polite about it). <br>  <br>  It's actually fun to speak French but you can't play around with it too much. Clichéd phrases are used over and over, and they speak in the passive a lot. Generalities which would be considered politically incorrect are used liberally.<br>  <br>  The most important thing about living in France is that the French are not taught as children to be nice to people they don't know. You need to let them warm up to you slowly. Don't push it and don't take any coldness personally. You'll find eventually that this works in your favor. You can really tell who you can trust and you can keep more private. It's a trade-off. <br>  <br>  In fact, be wary of "too-friendly" French people. I've known Americans who have ended up dealing with French people who are not too balanced, with religious cults, etc. because they were nice to them from the get-go. <br>  <br>  The French are not efficient or practical. They take their time and don't rush. Instructions have to be given over and over (especially important to remember when working with the French). Again, it's a trade-off. The French take time with how things look, feel, taste, etc. Being quick and getting things done falls down on their list of priorities. <br>  <br>  There are other advantages to living here. You wont see as much poverty. There is less crime and your personal safety is more assured. You can usually get what you need close to home (no need to drag out the car for everything). The train and public transport is wonderful. There is less variety of food but what they have is very good (especially compared to California where I'm from).<br>  <br>  Just be prepared to turn down the volume and speed of your life a few notches!|`|WrUTuQdlaa	If you speak French and respect their culture you'll be appreciated.|`|p8OZxERyaa	Hello,<br>  <br>  Hi !<br>  <br>  I can't tell you, cause I'm French ... but if you need some information about the french way of life, we will try to give you our best replies.<br>  <br>  But, you will be the welcome in France, we don't say enough, but we love the Americans and their so sweety accent when they speak French. If you don't speak French, it will be a little bit difficult, it depends of your job.<br>  <br>  Salut ! (Bye bye !)
CvGEdIUiaa	Religion is part of the German school curriculum on reasons having to do with totalitary regimes. The very young BRD wanted to give no chance to totalitary ways of thinking, and thus wanted to guarantee that every child heard a "normal" version of their katechism in school, so that at least they heard a different version, if the provider of the rest of their religious education provided totalitaristic or crazy views only (see Exorcisms and the like).<br>  <br>  The problem now is that there are many religions in Germany, but not often enough children to make it worthwile to hire a specific teacher for each religion. "Ethics" as a subject seemed to be the perfect solution, but many kids having a religion that there was a teacher for rather want to take Ethics, and many parents of kids needing to take Ethics are strictly against the kids "indoctrination" with information on philosophy and other religions.<br>  <br>  In my opinion, it would be great for everyone to have both. Lessons in their religion and lessons in Ethics. I had both. I loved it. It made us all think and ask questions.|`|vPV6d44Qaa	Religion has no place in the classroom, in my opinion.

L9XS5Gqgaa	Lords Knows.  There are no tourist shops or hotels.  They probably  amuse the scientists at McMurdo when the mostly rich cruise passengers waddle off the boat, walk around looking for penguins and then all climb back aboard. The Antarctic Treaty and other groups limit the amount of tourists that can actually set foot on Antarctica because they disturb penguins, leave waste, get themselves stranded and are generally not equipped to be there. The cruise ships leave oil,waste and bring in foreign organisms further upsetting the ecosystem.  But you have to say something so let me think quick!<br>  <br>  OK, they bring an interest in Antarctica and global warming  and through their enthusiasm disperse this important knowledge throughout the world. <br>  Yeah.  That sounds good.  If I were a teacher I would go for that one.And then elaborate about global warming and all<br>  <br>  <br>  I you can't think of anything else, just say that personally you feel the cons outweigh the benefits and go on a rant.

I've heard Luang Prabang is very nice too - World heritage sight. Very Cheap and people are very friendly.<br>  <br>  Cambodia - Siem Reap is great. Angkor Wat Temples are so beautiful.

HvyE4qpYaa	Marc, good job on your clarification.  Many border cities (including my hometown of Juarez) are falling into lawlessness and absolute anarchy.  In Juarez there were 1800 murders, 1600 car jackings and 17,000 (not a typo) car thefts.  The strain that the drug war has put on law enforcement has let criminals act with total impunity. <br>  <br>  It's said within Mexico that 1810 was the war of independence, 1910 revolution, and 2010 civil war.  All the signs are there... the currency has devalued by 50%, crime has skyrocketed in certain cities, mafias and cartels control large tracts of land inaccesible by the legitimate law officials.  All of this in time for a world wide recession.  <br>  <br>  What surprises me is how little media attention this is getting in the United States.  Who gives a f*k about the abduction of Caylee what's her name, when such an important even could happen at the doorsteps of millions of Americans?<br>  <br>  My only fighting hope is that Mexicans are a resilient people.  They have struggled and survived through a lot, and these next couple yrs will be tough... but just like in Colombia, we will come out stronger.|`|SIUKasInaa	no and yes,<br>  at times its hyped up by the media, but its very much so a real thing going on in our southern neighbor,<br>  <br>  the corrupt governments of the past and the trade of drugs and arms have escalated but have always been present, <br>  <br>  media has a huge step in the fright of now,.<br>  keep in mind that drug wars go on in all nation, even the us.<br>  <br>  and if it weren't for the US being the worlds number one consumer of drugs, and most anything else, then the problem in countries like mexico and other drug routes would be a lot less.<br>  <br>  so at times its sort of a 50 50 when it comes to why is there so much war with the cartels, but half the issue is within our own borders and our consumption of drugs from the souther nations...|`|HBx6q05Oaa	Yes, in fact the state department is looking into what can be done to avoid the drug wars from getting further into Texas and Arizona. The Mexican government is spending way to much money and losing the war. If I lived on the border, I would be armed and have a plan for bugging out!

uKjV9fADaa	I'm not on the east coast and generally I backpack - not much of a hotel/dining traveller - but I can tell you some basic Australian tourism stuff.<br>  When I want to drive when I'm outside Australia I need an international drivers license, which I obtain from our local roadside assistance club. You will almost certainly need one to drive here but I do not know the regulations for American travellers. I believe I read something specific regarding restrictions on US drivers but you will need to check it out. Bear in mind also that we drive on the left hand side like the UK. <br>  July and August are actually winter in Sydney, but I suspect is perfect weather for Queensland because I think that's the dry season?<br>  Also remember that Australia is as big as the States - it's a long way from Sydney to the barrier reef.<br>  Most tourists like Cannes where there are incredible rain forests and a more established tourist structure but mind it's not a very genuine Australian experience.<br>  Don't forget Melbourne - it's the cultural capital, it has things that are more interestingto me as a world traveller but if you're coming for nature you want to go north. If you want real Australia though you have to go to the Outback and that's a very dedicated trip.<br>  Also you're picking the best time - the USD to the AUD is perfect for you.
s2IOyj8iaa	That depends how long you can stay with the amount of money you have . You can travel around Australia for 6 months and not see everything . so really more details from you would help. 1 month in New Zealand and you can see most of it.|`|QMt4ofMxaa	Traveling to any place like Australia would mostly depend on your interest as well as your budget for your travel.

1Mc6BOvKaa	I don't think there's any prohibition in the UK, but you may like to check Austria Post's regulations. I worked in a Royal Mail International Sorting Office where we handled incoming mail from all over the world. We screened it for anything that was illegal or owing for import tax (which we handed to Customs) or on the Royal Mail prohibited items list (which we returned to the country of origin). The Austrians will have a similar set up, so be sure not to get caught out.<br>  <br>  The only problem you may have is if the sachets burst when the parcel goes through the sorting machines. It will damage the CD and the parcel, possibly causing it to break or make the address unreadable.

I'm not from New York City - the last thing I want people to think when I'm overseas or on the West Coast is that I'm from Manhattan, which is what is mostly associated with "New York City."  I have some college friends from Buffalo who also state that they are from "Buffalo, New York" not just "Buffalo" or just "New York."  Be more specific and you might not experience the miscommunication.|`|f6f40965eb7d5df6aa94440ec71e32dcaa	I'm with Eura; I always say Brooklyn, mainly because people always associate New York with Manhattan.

The record for the greatest snowfall in one month is held by Haines Apps, BC, where 535.9 cm fell in December 1959.

bc8c015b33127f191c20bfa4329d27e0aa	Well, let's agree first about the difference between being innocent and being naive. No one wants to be or to be referred to as a naive person as this means he can be fooled easily, which is not good anyway. Yet being innocent, well there is a big similarity, but one can be innocent and, in the same time, be aware and not easy-to-deceive and that’s what I like and really miss a lot these days.<br>  Being innocent is about feeling pity for others who are suffering,<br>  it’s about have good intentions in all deeds,<br>  it’s about dealing with others with love,<br>  it's about forgiving others whatever they do for you, yet not be easy-to-deceive-again :) "Almo'men la yoldagh men gohr marratayen"<br>  it’s about always expecting goodness from others,…..<br>  <br>  And you know what ya Noha, your question has a strong relationship with my name here in Y!

mY19PPlIaa	Yes, It was nothing great. I did not care for the beach the city is fairly americanized. You dont get that true mexican feel.<br>  These are the others places I have traveled.<br>  <br>  Mexico-<br>  <br>  Colima- True mexican beauty smallest and safest state in mexico on the pacific with nice uncrowded beaches. Nice city in Colima, Colima.<br>  <br>  Manzanillo, Colima- Very similar to puerto vallarta but less resorts and tourist more authentic feel and in my opinion better beaches no litter and soft sand.<br>  <br>  Tenacatita, Jalisco- About 50 mintues away from manzanillo and 1:30 from puerto vallarta. This place is not touristy at all, maybe 3 resorts at the most and the beach is fabulous. This beach is the best on the pacific side of mexico. True mexican beach town.<br>  <br>  Gudalajara, Jalisco- City , City , City life. Anything you want in a city you will find here. Amazing archetiture old cathedrals beautiful squares and history. And all the amenties you would find in a city, water parks, restaurants, zoo and so much more ..<br>  <br>  Tequilla, Jalisco- This is where tequilla comes from they have all the tequilla factories there. I went to the Jose Cuervo hacienda and took a tour of how they make tequilla. This town is very small and beautiful , A must see if your staying in guadalajara about an hour away. You could also take a train from guadalajara and during the ride your served all types of tequilla , have mariachi playing and take tours and have a nice dinner all for like 70 dollars per person you could buy tickets thru ticketmaster , its called tequilla train ride.<br>  <br>  *and have driven from the states to mexico and have gone thru so many states.<br>  <br>  Caribbean<br>  <br>  I have been to:<br>  <br>  Jamaica- Did not care for this island it was so touristy and cartoony. True waste of money not the authentic caribbean getaway. The beaches were full of seaweed and with only a few patches of clear water.<br>  <br>  St. Maarteen/ St. Martin- Same as jamaica over crowded and very touristy. Nothing special.<br>  <br>  Anguilla B.W.I- AWESOME BEACHES THE BEST IN THE WORLD. This island is tiny and too many unheard of . This is the true caribbean.  The beaches are unbelievable to color and the clarity just takes your breath away its very romantic.<br>  <br>  Summary: Well I have been to many places and I hope the info I gave you could help. I personally think you could never go wrong with mexico, it offers something different to everyone. Im going to playa del carmen this summer its about an hour away from the craziness of cancun . The resort Im staying at is the Sangri-la Caribe. I would also you recommend looking at tripadvisor.com for any hotel your planning on staying at.

It is primarily a resort town, and the main drag along the beach has pretty typical resort town restaurants, clubs, etc.  It is nothing at all like Cancun or Ixtapa, though, in terms of development and Americanization.  There are actually a lot of Mexican tourists there -- my girlfriend is from Guadalajara, and it is a favorite weekend destination for GDL residents.<br>  <br>  If you are looking for some nightlife, but not an overblown American resort town, it's a good choice.  But I really, really like Sayulita, a little surf town about 35 mins north of PV.  The beach is great, the town is small but bustling, and the people are really friendly.  Lots of european and south american expats living there, as well as locals and some north american transplants.  But if you're looking for clubs, it's not the place to go.

Even go get microsoft's flight simulator and learn to fly a Cessna yourself. Weather is a key factor in ALL flying which you will see. You can go up in a check ride for about $30 or $40.00 sometimes. Learn about airspeed which is all important, and stall speed, etc. Also, as my brother always said, "altitude is your friend." Find out how the engine's intake is de-iced while in flight. Sometimes when you don't know about something you have a fear of it. Probably the hardest thing for me about flying is navigation and the preponderance of FAA regulations more than anything else. Don't  forget that sometimes a little nervous feeling is good too because it keeps you on your toes. Perhaps you feel isolated because it seems like the pilots have some secret trick to make the plane fly. They don't. Perhaps check out some info on the internet as well.

We are working in 2 small community schools in Livingstone, Zambia where they do really need help. Yes, we do charge for the placements, but we have kept the price at a minimum whilst including all of the necessary things (flights, food, water, accommodation and transport).<br>  <br>  When I had my first volunteering experience in Zambia, I went through an organisation, but found the prices to be expensive (and they didn't include flights), the previous two times that I went to Zambia (by myself), I did have a little bit of trouble with the visa, as corruption is common there (even though there was no problem with my visa!).<br>  <br>  If you do go through a volunteer organisation, shop around to compare the prices and what they offer etc. as you will find that the majority do not offer the cost of the flights, and some don't even offer food! but if you decide to go out independently, research all about the visa process and whereabouts you could volunteer in the place that you wish to go to.<br>  <br>  good luck, I am sure that you will have a very good time!!

Generally, you need to be 18 to check in, but in Chicago some hotels are 21.  Call to see before booking.  <br>  <br>  2. No, her age is not an issue.  You should check in, come back to the car to get her and your bags, and then go to the room together.  <br>  <br>  3. Are you talking about downtown, or on the outskirts?  Use Expedia to research hotel rooms.  Don't stay somewhere so cheap that it is in a bad area of town.  You can get some great deals online if you pay in advance- last year I got a room at the Drake hotel in Chicago for $140 a night (usually $300 and up).<br>  <br>  4.

Be safe.<br>  <br>  I was a senior in high school when my boyfriend (now husband) was a junior- he never had any qualms about lying to his overprotective mother to spend a little time with me.  Now, years later, my mother in law laugh at all the stupid excuses and lies he came up with regarding his time spend with me.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|iS5EbUAjaa	Why would you want to do that. Wait until you are married.|`|SAgkmyqYaa	Someone may say something on here about her being too young for you, ignore that, 17 is legal in Illinois plus 2 years isn't a big deal, you could easily be a sophmore and her a freshmen.<br>  <br>  As for the hotel issue, you have to be 21 to check into hotels. If you find a motel and not a hotel they probably won't care but any chain will probably say you have to be 21 so you'll probably have to go to a dumpier no name hotel. You could always try booking on Orbitz, they say something about you having to be 21 but usually when I book on Orbitz they take my Orbitz papers, a credit card and that's it, no id. <br>  <br>  As for a good idea, totally up to you, there's nothing illegal your doing, obviously not something you should be doing as you have to hide it from your gf's mother but every kid does that stuff so no big deal.

At the next roundabout, take the southbound A77. The second roundabout you will encounter is Whitletts (now with traffic light control). Continue on the A77, but about a mile on (before you cross the river) you need to turn left into a lane marked for "Mainholm Holdings". The Centre is on the right hand side.

Sj9Z8jJKaa	Well first of all, coming from out of Austin like you, I would say definitely  visit Austin/UT to see for yourself! Anyone can describe it as best they could, but there's no substitute for the real thing :) <br>  <br>  Anyhoo, I'm sure you'd love it! The weather well, I came from South Texas which is definitely hotter than Austin, so personally I love the weather lol.. not sure where you're from, but for the most part winter is like part Nov/December/January/part of Feb.. the few years I've been here it's snowed less than a handful of times.. usually is 30s/40s/50s sometimes freezing at night.. some sleet.. nothing too terible.. then after winter it's spring/summer together lol it starts off mildly warm with beautiful warm and windy weather, sometimes rainy in spring time, my first year here it rained a lot and since then it hasn't.. summer gets pretty hot come on its Texas! So upper 90s, some low 100s, be prepared for the SUN, nothing unbearable though not like you'll be out in the sun 24/7.. then Fall is beautiful, see the leaves change colors, windy cool weather.. it's nice.. i love the weather here..<br>  <br>  People, yeah pretty much nice attitude people, intelligent, open-minded, lot of hipsters, hippies, laid back.. the school is majority white but theres a lot of minorities too that make up UT, lotsa asian, theres hispanic, black, etc.. you'll see for yourself the diversity here :) it's awesome!<br>  <br>  Uhm yeah Austin/UTs greaat I love it theres so much to do it's a visually beautiful city, UT the school is a great school, lotsa resources.. oh you'll love it!<br>  <br>  feel free to contact me if you have any questions :)|`|O71xlcG3aa	Well you should expect it to be hot.  Very very hot with lots of humidity.  Except for two months in the winter when it gets very very cold.  I love it here.  The people are awesome, so friendly.

Since then the banknotes have been changed twice and today there are no banks left exchanging them, the zeros have been thrown off and it translates to 50 kurus, soit 20 pennies. So either you should start a banknote collection, donate them to a thrift store or paste them on your wall (I actually did, pasted a couple I found under my bed on my wall, it looks quite nice :) ).<br>  <br>  The answerer above me got it wrong, he's talking about the New liras the banknote you showed us is an old lira.|`|czdCtTvWaa	Edit: my bad I used the new lira this one is the right one,<br>  <br>  500,000 Turkish Lira = 0.22886 Euro <br>  <br>  500,000 Euro (EUR) = 1092386501500 Turkish Lira<br>  <br>  don't get too happy i used the new lira, lol.....

The local government decided to use this festival as a tool to promote Dubai as a holiday destination.|`|OfpUf6Dcaa	dubai's tourist investment started off coz of their concern running out of oil..<br>  they had the sun, a lot of land to develop and had to distinguish themselves from the other places which had just the same things as they had....<br>  <br>  the boom started with developing a shopping destination (tax free) but also, they chose and developed projects which were original, unique and knew would attract media attention.  coupled with the luxury lifestyle and offering top services, especially holiday-wise they managed to put dubai on the map<br>  <br>  burj al arab, the palm islands, the world, burj dubai<br>  and also the uniqueness of being such a cosmopolitan city which however is  safe, luxurious, beautiful, with the choas of a city..  <br>  businesswise, it is well connected, and has an ideal position where east meets west and you get a taste of both and a taste of it s own..|`|es6Xw606aa	Your question is not clear - do you mean to ask whose brain child it was to promote Dubai as a toruist spot or which grooup of tourists started making dubai popular with everyone else?<br>  I personally think the answer to the first is Sheikh Rashid al Makhtoum, the present sheikh of Dubai who is a man of grea vision and inteligence.

bce39401306bcfca633509290725fd6eaa	well,  if you are in the proper mindframe I guess its worth considering but beware taking care of a few bratty kids all summer long especially in the boonies, like a job job, can be pretty tiresome.  It doesnt pay much and your opportunities to really see and experience your travel is limited by a: your job requirements and b; money and isloation.<br>  BUT If you luck in with a good family who doesnt view as temp. hired help and actually eager to do it on an exchange basis knowing you are coming here to experience some of the country and not just as a babysitter.   If you are willing to take experiences were you find them;  the travel there, the opportunity to live outside your own fishbowl for a few months and prepared to do some "alone" time it would probably be good.  <br>  Also, Canada is a big country... maybe Post another question on the town/city your opportunity lies and yahoo can give you better idea of local conditions.

Make sure that you have your Drivers License and your birth certificate with the seal (copies will not work).  I would go to get it as soon as possible.  Last year was the first year I got my passport and it took about a month and a half, but I've heard of people who don't get them for maybe 2 or 3 months.  Call up to the Post Office to ask how much and what exactly that you need (the regulations might have changed since I've gotten mine), it takes about 10 minutes for them to get all the information and take the picture.  <br>  I hope you have a great time on your cruise!  I know that we had a blast on ours. We took a Carnival Cruise to Mexico.|`|ZVx3BWEdaa	You need your birth certificate and a valid I.D. It is easier to go and get your passport done in person rather than the mail.If you do it in person it takes a day or so.If you do it through the mail it can take weeks and the book is the better way to go in my opinion. I know that Walgreen's photo department makes passports for a good price but check around to see where else does passports. You never know when you may find a good deal. I hope this helps you.

FFqWeIX7aa	I think it we were fallen into a deep and hot conversation here.<br>  <br>  I don’t know what the meaning of Racist is. But I’ll answer them…<br>  <br>  Frankly speaking, <br>  I’m Malay, I love human equally regardless their race and religion. <br>  I feel I’m closer to my Chinese friend rather than some of my Malay friends.<br>  <br>  May be the the “non-malaysian” people here is correct when talking about how Singapore, Phillipines, Indonesia view of Malaysia. <br>  <br>  I live in Indonesia, and I read some newspaper talk badly about Malaysia – calling our practicing racial discrimination, in whatever field. <br>  <br>  Frankly speaking, I hate to read that. <br>  For me, Indonesia is worse than Malaysia in these kinds of “racial” problems. <br>  In Indonesia prior to 1999, all Indonesian people should used Indonesian name. (Where even the Chinese can’t longer preserved their Chinese and surname anymore, how sad!)<br>  <br>  Indonesian has 90% Malay (in Race), Philippines 94%, Singapore have 85% Chinese, and Thailand has 80% Thais.   <br>  <br>  But Malaysia is different. Only 54% in Malaysia are Malays; they just make up a slight majority. <br>  <br>  These make them to allow the other races to stand in racial identity too, rather than make a “Malaysian Malaysia” identity, which need to mixed 4 different culture.<br>  <br>  These freedom, to stand in own identity, culture and language, with addition a large population of one race makes outsider see that Malaysian is racist, Chinese, Indian or Malay. <br>  <br>  May be, we are too diverse in culture, to large in number and we can’t force the other race to follow the other race (like what happen in Indonesia and Thailand, where Malay was been forced to named as Muslim Thai, even though they are not Thai) or all people become apostate of their own race (like what happens in Singapore, where they all use English rather than their mother tongue)<br>  <br>  Yes, government implement several kind of “discrimination” but that is been proposed by the Judges of Australia, Pakistan, India and UK, based on their survey. They are professional and fully aware of their proposal.<br>  <br>  “Malay privilege” is not discrimination, but is an exchange for Malay willingness to give MALAYsia citizenship for the outsiders. If Malay Privilege is a discrimination, then Citizenship of Chinese and Indian ALSO a DISCRIMINATION.<br>  <br>  Those who didn’t understand should shut their mouth. Because, if Malay Privilege has been taken from Malay, then the Social Contract will be end in that way, and Chinese and Indians should give up the exchange - their citizenship. Did those in Indonesia, Singapore, Thailand and Phillipines will to accept them? <br>  <br>  Government implements several kinds of things which benefits Malay, because for them, when the majority is rich, then the minority is also rich. In Indonesia, the majority lives in poverty. Some people say the Chinese come to steal their economic richness. And they even more extreme than Malay in confronting the other races.<br>  <br>  Malaysian that practices the “discrimination” seems better than Thailand whom faces many racial problems at the south part, while Indonesian sometimes does the reformation because of that. Racism exist everywhere, Malaysian solve it by making it official. <br>  <br>  For Malaysian, diverse and perseverance of one identity (racism) is a freedom, while for the outsider, it is bad. <br>  <br>  That’s why I think it is better to only MALAYSIAN people judge it, rather than the outsiders. They know their position and country better. We don’t have to judge using data or whatever kind.<br>  <br>  If this is “racist” and it seems it is a good for Malaysian, then, why care to bother?<br>  Racist are not always bad, because racist is wide ideology, not filthy things like feces.<br>  <br>  =)|`|dfl1A8ABaa	What is the problem to be racist?I urge all races in Malaysia to be racist so that they know how to protect their race prestige.But Malaysians should know how to differentiate the term 'racism' and 'discrimination'.<br>  Racism means loving his own race but never deny other race's right to have something.<br>  e.g: A Malay teacher teaches extremely good in school,same quality as the tuition teacher,and he doesn't care what race of his students. Meanwhile, he engage some time to advice only the discipline-problematic Malay students, because he feels he shouldn't see the Malay students to become immoral individuals. <br>  Discrimination means denying the eligible right of the other people either based on the latter's ethnicity, genders, ages or social status. <br>  e.g. UMNO government set rules that favor Malay students in the enrollment of certain popular university courses, and government servant posts.|`|etV271ARaa	We've gone from racial polarisation to unity and back to polarisation during Mahathir's 22 year tenure. The vechicle used to create racial division was the NEP, created by Razak to eradicate poverty, and embraced by the Hussein Onn administration, it was used during the Mahathir era to enrich cronies by claiming enrichment of a certain community as a right. <br>  <br>  Deep racism was instilled when the Malay community began demanding for more and more priviledges, giving more purpose to the other racial component parties in the BN in effect strengthening the BN. And thanks to this racism is rife in Malaysia.<br>  <br>  But there's hope. Deep down, we Malaysians accept that we live in a multi racial nation. We can walk deep into a Chinese village, Indian area or Malay Kampung and sit down and have a cup of tea or ask for directions and are treated properly. We can continue to guide this move to racial harmony by voting in multi racial parties into power. Racism exists.

cyA9j9Dpaa	You have to drive up Tantalus. It is a gorgeous view of the city & you can see the island in all directions (not all at on time though). Skip Peal Harbor unless you are a major history buff. And try to find local places to eat at. There is a noodle house in China Town that is to die for! Amazing! And China Town itself is worth a visit. Just be sure if you go to not leave anything (and I mean anything!) in your car. The beaches in Waikiki are very rocky, try the ones on the east side of the island at Kailua and Lanikai. <br>  <br>  Go to the North Shore to Turtle Beach. Plus it's a really nice place. There is also a delicious Thai restaurant in Haleiwa (spelling???) that is a must. It is a little tiny, tiny place right on the road. The food is killer, but be prepared for some serious stink eye from the locals. It is a definite locals spot. Also on the North Shore, try snorkeling at Sharks Cove. Don't be intimidated by the name. It's gorgeous. We saw the state fish, eels, a sea turtle and much, much more.<br>  <br>  You will also be there durring Big Wave Season so expect some traffic up north. However, check and see if there are any Pro Surfing competitions while you are there. Even people who do not surf, or have never seen surfing, enjoy watching the Pros like, Slater, Burgois & Curren take on the giant epic waves that appear each winter on the North Shore of Oahu.<br>  <br>  If you want to see a waterfall & go swimming try Maunawili Falls. The hike is about 1 1/2 miles and worth it. This is also the place where they filmed part of the Jason Mraz video for "I'm Yours". Cool right?<br>  <br>  Try to avoid the western side of the island. Like, really don't go unless there is something you absolutely must do. And if you are just passing through, keep driving. It is a definite native/local area & we tourists/halies are just not welcome. Trust me on this one.<br>  <br>  As for an inexpensive & half-decent luau, try the one at the Hilton Garden Inn. It's right on the property by the water, with good food. The show is alright, but for the money it's good. <br>  <br>  If you want to make the most of your trip though invest in a few books. There is one that is a must have called "Oahu Revealed" by Andrew Doughty & Harriett Friedman. These books have been passed around so much between my family & friends. My family from Hawai'i even asked to keep it! Also go for the Fodor's Guide to Hawai'i or the Fodoe's Guide to Oahu. If you can only get 1 book though, get Oahu Revealed. And just be sure, wherever you go, don't leave the book on the seat in your car!<br>  <br>  Have a great trip, and don't forget the sunscreen!|`|LQbsyojIaa	If you like shopping, go to the Ala Moana Shopping center|`|AA11327039	The Polynesian center for the Arts or some community center type of place is not only the cheapest place for a Luau but it's likely the best.|`|e6deba47bc9cb7fb188c260b4681f676aa	Ala Moana shopping center is great - lots to see.  Great eats.  Across from the beach.  At the other end of Waikiki is Rainbow Drive-In, real local food, stand in line and find a picnic table.<br>  At the North Shore in Haleiwa, check out the Dole pineapple plantation.  It has a good gift shop.  If you go to Waimea Falls botanical park, take mosquito repellant.  Find Punchbowl Cemetary, at the top of Tantulus Dr.  7 Medal of Honor winners are buried there, and you have the most scenic view from Diamond Head to Pearl Harbor.  If you have access to a car, the best beach is Kailua Beach Park. (just think it sounds like Kahlua).  dont pack alot.  Buy your towel and beach supplies at the ABC stores in Waikiki.  Definately go to The Swap Meet to buy souveniers.  the cheapest place at Aloha Stadium for new stuff.  luggage, jewelry, clothing... have fun!
fd2CVqwkaa	Here's a cost of living calculator showing the cost of living in Dallas, Texas: <a href="http://www.payscale.com/cost-of-living-calculator/Texas-Dallas" rel="nofollow">http://www.payscale.com/cost-of-living-c...</a> It shows that the overall cost of living is 9 percent lower than the national average. It also breaks down expenses such as food, housing, and transportation and compares those costs to the national average.<br>  <br>  Also, you can use this calculator to get a cost of living comparison between two cities.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps

In the main part of town are the best hotels and restaurants. <br>  <br>  When I was there,  my son and I took side boat trips to other little islands.  We kayaked, snorkeled and drank lots of cheap beer.<br>  I found the kayaking soooo nice.  What a stress free way to go.  Miles and miles of islands,  beaches etc.  Warm and clear water.  Oh Yah!  I'm heading back. lol<br>  <br>  Seriously though.  Check that part out.  Other than that you will meet a lot of people from many different countries.<br>  <br>  It's a good choice for a 3 day trip.<br>  <br>  Have fun and don't drink the water.
5fXNW1y4aa	Well, we can say that the comandante ideas have been a disaster, as usual. He wanted to grow rice in the Zapata swamp, grow coffee around Habana, obtain 10 million tons of sugar in 1970<br>  <br>  Since then, things have stayed the same ( bad ) or very slowly they are getting worse<br>  <br>  When the soviet union fell, fidel had no funds. He managed to stay in power with tourism and the money that we sent to our families.<br>  <br>  Of course, our families were starving. He didn't care<br>  <br>  Now, the little bruder said that we will give lands to the peasant to cultivate and make them produce<br>  <br>  Our country is a ruin. We were among the more advanced in 1959, and we were so idiots to let fidel seize power with many promises that he never made reality<br>  <br>  To Stephen:<br>  Excuse me, but here we are not talking about any of those countries that you mention. We ( or at least I ) are talking about Cuba.<br>  Who cares about the embargo ? You forgot to mention the leadership of the evil brothers. Forget the frikking embargo<br>  <br>  WE ARE DOING OK ? Says who ? Are you serious ?<br>  <br>  You are right. We SEEM happy. And your point is ?<br>  Would you prefer that we die of sadness ?<br>  <br>  Cuba has one of the highest suicide rates in the world. I suppose it is due to our happiness<br>  <br>  You were saying ?|`|nqvYvDu7aa	Well, I don't want to repeat what other people have already said here, but allow me two words<br>  <br>  1 - Fall of the soviet union. Loss of funds<br>  2 - Great crisis as a consequence. fidel survived based on the money that we send to our families, tourism, and maybe something else<br>  3 - Oil from Chavez<br>  4 - About china, they are concerned today with profit. I am not very sure they have a very important role in all this<br>  5 - Possible increase in field production, but that is still to be seen<br>  <br>  Oh, dear casey, I am so sorry that our country has been ruled by a comunist dictatorship for the past 50 years and that we are not happy about it. Sorry<br>  <br>  The problem is that we have not been able to remove fidel, among other reasons, because out of Cuba nobody cares, as your own answer shows very clearly<br>  <br>  By the way, the answers we have posted seem to coincide with what you posted. Why do you say that rather to answer the question we have, etc, etc, ?<br>  We answered the question indeed<br>  <br>  Besides, regarding Cuba it is not possible to explain something with mentioning politics|`|N2MWHI4Oaa	In Cuba things kind of stay the same. Not many modifications. <br>  <br>  Recently Raul said that he would give the peasants lands to use, but the lands would still be owned by the government. We are waiting to see that.  <br>  <br>  In the 1990s, the soviet union crashed and fidel lost its funding. We thought it would finally be its end, but with its typical evil cunning it created ways to stay in power. With a terrible sorrow for the population, but it doesn't care about that<br>  <br>  Now, the little brother is ( supposedly ) in charge, but no great differences have been seen. Perhaps Big Brother is watching Raul and does not allow him to do greater openings, or who knows<br>  <br>  You know, Stephen, the leadership of our country is not stupid. If they were, they would not have stayed there for 50 years<br>  fidel has many bad qualities, but stupid is not one of them|`|BDSC8R3Aaa	As other members have said, the fall of the soviet union, the extreme scarcity of everything, and recently the idea of Raul to have people work the field<br>  <br>  Oh, yes, chavez delivering oil by pipeful and exploration of oil posibilities <br>  <br>  I am not sure whether that has transformed the economy|`|c5ec3f17461cb30d3d9d0c83ea690fb5aa	I think th eissue of teh Soviet Union collapsing has led to Cuba looking to tourism for its financial salvation. I've been to Cuba 3 times now and I feel its one of teh safest places ive been to in the world. sure there is povety just like all the Carribbean Countries but there is a high level of social care and education. generally the Cuban people are very friendly . th eeconomic policy of Castro is a disaster but the embago is not helping the situation at all. if anything the helms newton act has strengthened the resolve of teh cuban government. but hopefully now the US has a sane moral man as a president the embago will lift soon.<br>  Incidently Ive been to miami and in a week i saw 2 muggings hear a shoot out, lost count of teh drug deals I saw. Even as an ex british Soldier who'd been on tour in Northern Ireland, I cant remeber feeling that scared in a foriegn country as i did in Miami.

If there is more than one person on the visa, the main applicant must arrive earlier than or at the same time as the others. All visa holders must validate; the visa of anyone who doesn't will lapse. <br>  <br>  After validation, you may leave the country if you wish. Your visa is then valid for 5 years from the date of grant if you are out of Australia and forever if you stay in the country. If you will be travelling extensively or staying overseas for long periods, you must get a 5 year Resident Return visa:<br>  <a href="http://www.immi.gov.au/migrants/residents/155/" rel="nofollow">http://www.immi.gov.au/migrants/resident...</a>|`|OYYYNCyCaa	This is a permanent residence visa. As a permanent resident you are permitted to remain in Australia indefinitely. This visa also allows you to travel to and enter Australia for five (5) years from the date the visa is granted. The expiry of this visa does not affect your permanent resident status if you are in Australia. However, if you wish to continue to travel to and from Australia as a permanent resident after the initial visa has expired, you must obtain a Resident Return Visa (RRV). Your eligibility for an RRV will depend on the period that you have resided in Australia.

(Employers, especially small employers, hate using agencies too!)<br>  <br>  If you're not interested in tech or manufacturing companies as listed on Applegate, find a similar website that specialises in the sort of industry you want to work in.

There are other people you can tell; your doctor, the police, a social worker.<br>  <br>  However, you sound very confused. Running away in this instance looks as if it may cause more problems than it solves.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, you are a minor, and cannot just leave home as you wish. Your mother is presumably your legal guardian, and you can only get a passport through her, unless this changes. The government isn't going to pay your fare without the whole thing going through a court. If you left the country without your guardian's consent, your auntie and cousin could be guilty of abduction.<br>  <br>  You need help and advice, This does mean talking to an adult you can trust, not necessarily a teacher. I'm sure you want to run away, but what are you running away to? If there is really no one you can talk to, ring Childline or the NSPCC - they will advise you without telling your family. So will your doctor. If you would like to discuss this with me again, do get in touch with me via email.<br>  <br>  Good luck and don't despair.|`|iIUMpwghaa	STOP ... i am 15 and have many times thought about running away before and once even got as far away as the field  - with my sleeping bag ... wen you think about running away just keep thinking to yourself ... life WILL get better thats what i thought and it worked just keep thinkin that and you will get through life life was never meant to be a breeze.<br>  <br>  becoming a christian helps a lot,<br>  Psalm 23:4<br>  Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I fear no evil, for You are with me; Your rod and Your staff, they comfort me.

I shopped at a few of the stores right in downtown Tombstone, such as Trails End Unique Gifts and The Red Buffalo Trading Co.  Tombstone is plenty of fun!|`|dFBccLExaa	I've been to Tombstone once.

It is interesting, though, if you hang around at night, because there's this really odd group of people that live in the area who dress up like extras from those ridiculous movies and just sort of walk around.

You feel sad for them.<br>  If you do go, check out the Schefflin Monument just outside of town. Hollywood missed him, but Ed Schefflin was an integral part of Tombstone's true history. The monument is interesting and you won't find any tourists there because no one seems to know about or wants to drive the 1/4 mile down a dirt road to reach it.|`|djJNNgboaa	Tombstone is a pretty cool place to visit.

UIJorsD7aa	There is no such thing as being part-Jewish.<br>  A person is Jewish if:<br>  1)  She/he was born to a Jewish mother, or:<br>  2)  She/he converted to Judaism according to Jewish law (which nowadays means an Orthodox conversion).|`|i7oHTo9haa	Hi.  I think it's really cool that you're discovering your ancestry and it's cool no matter where your ancestors are from.  Alot of people either don't know or don't care where they come from, where their ancestors were from and what they did, but I think we have alot to learn from the history of our ancestors.. Where would we all be if we discounted lessons from previous generations and just went by current generation?  Still back in stone age I think! :)<br>  <br>  So anyways, just like the Jewish respondents before me I'll reiterate that there is no such thing as being part Jewish.  One is either Jewish or they're not.  In your case, don't let it confuse you, there is a history of Jewish people in your ancestry but that doesn't make you Jewish at all.   We go by strictly maternal "unbroken" lines.  To be Jewish one has to be born to a Jewish mother or convert via Orthodox methods to be accepted into the whole Jewish community.<br>  <br>  But don't let it disappoint you either! Judaism is a very respectful and loving religion to other peoples and we consider one doesn't have to be Jewish. You seem to have an interest in spiritual aspects so what I recommend is that you can do at this point is to explore the spirituality aspect through an approved Jewish site for gentiles, I'll provide one for you.  I want to warn you though to beware of non-Jewish sites that if you don't know what's what when you're exploring then feel free to come back and ask questions from actual Jewish people themselves  Some (many) of your respondents aren't actually Jewish here and didn't make it clear that they weren't, it's the same all over the internet.  So be cautious on what information you take in while you're exploring spirituality.  <br>  <br>  Here is a site thru the Gentile aspect of Judaism, it is not a branch of Judaism, or a religion in itself, it is what G-d expects from Gentiles in easy to understand terms.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://noahide.org/" rel="nofollow">http://noahide.org/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.noahide.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.noahide.com/</a><br>  <br>  Besides studying the spirituality aspect then you can get to know your ancestry further.  I am Sephardic ancestry and some of us did make it to England, not majority, but enough to see there was a presence in England. The Inquisition did take its toll on Sephardim and just didn't stop at 1492 as a one time event. It continued on for some time even when we went to other countries.  There were willful conversions out to Christianity and that's what it sounds like happened in your line, and those of us that didn't willfully convert still found a way to stay alive and still be Jewish.  It's no shame, people do what they have to do to live and nobody knows what your particular line went through unless you study the horrors of it.  Life was really brutal back then for us. <br>  <br>  Here are some Jewish sites with names where you can study your particular ancestry from.  You can also join an ancestry site and search old databases for both your grandmother and  grandfather's family.  I think if you start a project like that it would be a nice gift to pass onto your children  Good luck on your continued research and interest in your ancestry and spirituality.<br>  <br>  Jewish Surnames<br>  <a href="http://www.bh.org.il/Links/surnames.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.bh.org.il/Links/surnames.asp</a><br>  <a href="http://www.orthohelp.com/geneal/yohasin.HTM" rel="nofollow">http://www.orthohelp.com/geneal/yohasin....</a><br>  <br>  Ancestry sites:<br>  <a href="http://www.familysearch.org/eng/default.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.familysearch.org/eng/default....</a><br>  <a href="http://www.ancestry.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.ancestry.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://jewishgen.org/" rel="nofollow">http://jewishgen.org/</a><br>  <br>  Spanish Inquisition:<br>  The accused, sometimes for trivial reasons such as wearing clean clothes on Fridays, were taken during the night without warning and not seen again until their auto-da-fe. Under torture confessions came readily. Their property was confiscated, part going to support the Inquisition, part to the Queen and part to build churches and monasteries. Punishment could consist in being burned alive (to avoid the shedding of blood). Others had hands cut off before being burned or quartered. Mercy was shown to some by strangling them before being burnt. The lucky ones were deprived of all property, prohibited from government and other offices and ordered to wear the san benito for the rest of their lives. At their death their san benito was prominently displayed in the local church as perpetual reminders. Some can still be found in Spanish churches today..... The edict of expulsion was not repealed until Dec 1968.<br>  <a href="http://www.orthohelp.com/geneal/seph_wh2.htm#inquisition" rel="nofollow">http://www.orthohelp.com/geneal/seph_wh2...</a>|`|9se7DTyDaa	it means being treated like shi*t by your jewish fathers family because you are not pure jewish,it means having to ask what "mamzer" means when you are six years old after hearing yourself called it by an aunt,it means my father being ostricized by his family for marrying a catholic,that is what it means to me!|`|1a12b70a1ae2e90d55e3b1643b48f58baa	You are not Jewish,  A Jew is any person whose mother was a Jew or any person who has gone through the formal process of conversion to Judaism.<br>  <br>  It is important to note that being a Jew has nothing to do with what you believe or what you do. A person born to non-Jewish parents who has not undergone the formal process of conversion but who believes everything that Orthodox Jews believe and observes every law and custom of Judaism is still a non-Jew, even in the eyes of the most liberal movements of Judaism, and a person born to a Jewish mother who is an atheist and never practices the Jewish religion is still a Jew, even in the eyes of the ultra-Orthodox. In this sense, Judaism is more like a nationality than like other religions, and being Jewish is like a citizenship. See What Is Judaism?<br>  <br>  This has been established since the earliest days of Judaism. In the Torah, you will see many references to "the strangers who dwell among you" or "righteous proselytes" or "righteous strangers." These are various classifications of non-Jews who lived among Jews, adopting some or all of the beliefs and practices of Judaism without going through the formal process of conversion and becoming Jews. Once a person has converted to Judaism, he is not referred to by any special term; he is as much a Jew as anyone born Jewish.<br>  <br>  Although all Jewish movements agree on these general principles, there are occasional disputes as to whether a particular individual is a Jew. Most of these disputes fall into one of two categories.<br>  <br>  First, traditional Judaism maintains that a person is a Jew if his mother is a Jew, regardless of who his father is. The liberal movements, on the other hand, consider a person to be Jewish if either of his parents was Jewish and the child was raised Jewish. Thus, if the child of a Jewish father and a Christian mother is raised Jewish, the child is a Jew according to the Reform movement, but not according to the Orthodox movement. On the other hand, if the child of a Christian father and a Jewish mother is not raised Jewish, the child is a Jew according to the Orthodox movement, but not according to the Reform movement! The matter becomes even more complicated, because the status of that children's children also comes into question.|`|8I9uduIiaa	No, you're not Jewish - but you have a Jewish heritage.<br>  <br>  Judaism is a matrilinear faith. A person is Jewish if their mother is Jewish OR they convert.<br>  <br>  These two ways aside, nobody can be Jewish. Even if a person's father is Jewish, if the mother is not, the child is not. Now, this can of course prove really tough for people who have Jewish fathers. But Judaism has always defined Jewish identity in this manner.<br>  <br>  If you are interested in exploring your Jewish heritage, by all means do so, I recommend these sites in terms of getting info on Jewish history etc:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.whatjewsbelieve.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.whatjewsbelieve.org/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.askmoses.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.askmoses.com</a><br>  <a href="http://www.messiahtruth.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.messiahtruth.com</a><br>  <a href="http://www.ajewwithaview.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.ajewwithaview.com</a><br>  <br>  <br>  Hope you find out more information - Sephardic traditions are very interesting.

Judaism is a religion, period, which happens to contain some large ethnocentric groupings as well (Sephardic, Ashkenazic, etc.).  One is either Jewish or one is not.  In your case, since your father's father was Jewish, and since you have not been raised Jewish, you would not be considered Jewish by any of the movements within Judaism.  If your mother were Jewish, then you would be considered Jewish by all; if at least one parent were Jewish, *and* you had been *raised* Jewish, then Reform Judaism would consider you Jewish.<br>  <br>  In your case, you have Jewish ancestry as you said--which simply means that one of your ancestors was Jewish.|`|YSXDTs3Eaa	Forget "Jewish"...it really depends on your mentality and how you relate to Jews, bearing in mind that that not all Jews think alike!

9NSfJChaaa	I don't think that you can ever be "too old" for Disney.  You might grow out of it and not find it fun anymore, but I doubt that you will be "too old."  I am 28 and taking my 17th trip there in May.<br>  <br>  Make sure you brings lots of film and batteries.  Also, take advantage of the cast members that wander around the parks taking pictures.  They will put you in different poses and will superimpose characters into the picture so it might look like you are fholding Tinkerbell in your hand.  You can then buy those pictures.  Make a photo album of all of the pictures so when you get an urge for Disney you can pull out the album and relive the memories.  Just take pictures of everything!  Even if you aren't in it... take a picture of it so you can remember how you felt when you took the picture of the Wishes fireworks.<br>  <br>  Also, buy the pictures they take on Splash Mountain, Tower of Terror, etc.  They'll last a lot longer than a T-shirt that will fade and get ratty over time.  You can frame those pictures and look at them every day or put them with your Disney album and pull them out when you need a dose of Disney.<br>  <br>  I can't really help you with the souvenier money because I don't spend a lot there.  I prefer to take pictures which are free than spend my money on a t-shirt and sucker or something.  Disney isn't going anywhere... even if this is the last time your parents take you, in a few years you'll be an adult and you can go with friends, or your own family in the future.<br>  <br>  Have fun!!|`|tnznR01paa	:O.<br>  You're never too old to go to Disney, aha.<br>  <br>  I'm the same as you, I don't go on really fast rides or roller coaster, but if you think this is going to be your last time, maybe you should try out some rides you haven't. You never know, maybe you'll end up liking them:).<br>  Take a lot of pictures! <br>  Just do as many things you can! Use your time wisely!<br>  <br>  Wow.<br>  $200 for one day?<br>  That's a lot, aha<br>  I don't think you need to buy a whole bunch of stuff stuff. I think $200 if enough, but if you are determined to then I'd bring a lot more money then $200.<br>  <br>  Hope you have a great time:).|`|OugNf0x6aa	Hey, the people who design everything at the parks designed it to keep people, even adults, coming back. Just show them how some older kids are there (Point them out), and maybe they'll reconsider. I'm also 15 but I go to Disney annually just since the parks are fun! ?|`|73ac745efcfce839836e14b0f116395baa	Awh, you should never decide when your last Disney trip is going to be! haha, my grandparents still go!<br>  <br>  Anyways, you should really make it memorable. Bring a digital camera, or film camera, and take ALOT of pictures. Also, buy or use a digital camcorder! My brothers and I record EVERY ride we go on, even if they say not to! It's always fun to look back at. Just yesterday, my mother and I were watching videos from 2003! Thats always a plus.<br>  <br>  Also, take pictures with the characters, your never too old for that! You should make this trip longer than a week, but no longer than 2 weeks. <br>  If it's your last one, you should make the most of it. Go to Universal Studios, Busch Gardens, Sea World, Wet N Wild, different parks. <br>  <br>  As for money, if it's your last trip you should bring at LEAST $500. You want to make it memorable and bring alot of things. If you ever have kids, you want to show them things you did when you went to Disney! You can buy shirts, souveniers, different fun stuff. Whenever i go to Disney, my parents always buy my brothers and I one thing, like a shirt, mug, something along those lines. Better be safe than sorry and bring more money, but be conservative with the money. Don't spend it all in one place. Make the most of it. Have your parents or someone hold onto it, just incase :)<br>  <br>  Have a safe and MAGICAL trip(;

SeJ1Hnfraa	Hello Dear!<br>  My friend who is a scuba diver explains it as the pressure on our ear drums changes with depth (in his case) or with changes in altitude while on an airplane. Kids get bothered by this it seems more than adults. Babies especially are unhappy with the pressure changes and, being babies, cannot easily be told what to do to make it better.<br>  Work on a lollipop, or a pacifier, or a bottle of milk.<br>  Yawn. Laugh. It really does help.<br>  For smaller kids, I’d highly recommend a pacifier. Stick it in just before take-off and again as soon as the pilot says you’re about to start your descent. The constant sucking helps balance out the pressure. Bottles or even breast feeding work well too.<br>  If your child has an ear infection, or just a cold, you will do best see a doctor pre-flight because ears already stuffed up and hurting are going to get way more uncomfortable as the plane climbs and descends. Consult a physician about decongestant nose drops.<br>  Sad to say, crying also helps equalize the pressure and for really small kids may be the only route away from the discomfort (that also is meant to be a morale builder for you, in that you should remember that as your child is crying most of the way from Honolulu to San Francisco at least part of the time he is equalizing the pressure in his ears).<br>  Lots of hugs and the occasional tickle can calm a child facing an unfamiliar pain, and help stop the crying that can continue long after the pressure problem has gone away.<br>  best of luck!|`|AA10433969	Give hime chewy snacks, such as gummie candies. Has he ever tried gum? I know gum and 2 year olds arn't the best combo but if he has tried it and is okay with it that is the best option, cause lots of gummie worms isnt all that healthy. Kids are very tough tho, and he probobly wont notice all that much. Good luck and have fun!|`|NARiXGNDaa	for me many airlines dont have this problem, if it does happen give him gum or maybe a hard boiled sweet<br>  <br>  have fun<br>  xx|`|fWi18dyoaa	Many years ago the airlines used to hand out hard candies/sweets to suck on before take off.  This generally relieved the pressure in the ears.|`|1bTYCUDkaa	Give him hard candy to suck on, but that may be hazardous to young children.  You could give him gummy snacks.  Gum can also be an option if you feel it is safe.
CvGEdIUiaa	You won't be able to cancel it. Once you started the trip you bought, the airline doesn't allow this. I would contact your travel agent, though, and see if he can't "rescedule". I did that a number of times with my return ticket when I moved back to Germany from the states, as things just kept on coming up. On the other hand, that was a trip where the return ticket was already baught and paid for, but as an "open ticket", with no date set (costs a bit more at booking, compared to a normal long time return ticket, but only about 20 to 20 €, normally).<br>  <br>  It will always be possible to book a one-way ticket, but you will not get any money back from your return ticket. The person who would have sat next to you will just have more space (if he's lucky).|`|claUGpVRaa	You can do that as long as you check the small print on the ticket - some are non refundable. Some are, so check first to be sure.<br>  If you hold passports for both countries, you may not even need to show return tickets at either end???
iaLVRwBnaa	i just graduated from WSU, so let me try to tell you a little about the school... what exactly are you studying? that might help a little as far as trying to tell you how academics and professors and stuff are. i guess it all depends on the way you look at things, but as far as my experience and my likings - these were my pros and cons...<br>  <br>  cons: <br>  - if you're from the west side of the state, the drive is long. long and boring. after ellensburg on interstate 90, you pretty much have nothing for 3 hours on a one lane road.<br>  - the weather sucks. when you first get there in august it is HOT. but it only stays that way for about a month then the weather generally gets really cold and really snowy. if you're into winter, that's great. but i found it to be pretty annoying last year when we got snow straight into the month of june. feet and feet of it. <br>  - in the middle of nowhere. as far as internship opportunities, it's really hard to find them here while in school, which i think would've been nice. if you go to a school in a city there are a lot more job and internship opportunities to start while you're still in school so by the time you graduate you have some good experience. there's nothing in pullman, and even as far as minimum wage jobs go just to make some money while you're in college - there aren't many places to look.<br>  - big on partying. because there's nothing else to do.<br>  - big on greek life. even though greek life is only a small percentage on campus - it feels HUGE. they had some trouble in the years i were there with greek life and the "rest" of the student population... meaning they tried to integrate greeks to hang out and be involved with the "regular" student body... the school got sororities to do joint events with african american student groups to try and prove that greeks were so stereotypical. it was all very fake and to put on a show. <br>  <br>  pros:<br>  - you get the whole small college town feel. it's not like in seattle when UW is just a small part of a huge city. all that is in pullman is the school... so everything else in the town revolves around the school. all the stores in town have specials for students and everything - even the safeway and chain stores have emblems of the school mascot and stuff in the stores. during game days everyone in town is listening to the game on the radio. it's kind of a neat feeling to know that everywhere you go, you're around people who are in the same boat as you...<br>  <br>  i didn't like it out there too much and wish i would've gone to school in a bigger city. i just think there's more opportunity in a big city as far as getting a jump start on a career goes and i also am the type of person that likes the diversity of the city. really - most people either LOVE wsu when they go there, or they hate it and transfer out pretty quick.  good luck!|`|WXCa8zQoaa	the con's are you are separated by the mountains .i also heard that you can get pretty horrible roommates if you like to study i knew some one who went their and they moved a couple times and the roommates were mean disrupting their studies|`|uKWcgLLoaa	PRO: Located in a small college town in agricultural area<br>  CON; Located in a small college town in agricultural area<br>  PRO: Campus life is somewhat "party" style<br>  CON: Campus life is somewhat "party" style<br>  PRO: Campus is nice, but not as nice as UW<br>  CON: Campus is nice, but not as nice as UW<br>  PRO: Professors are excellent, but not as excellent as UW<br>  CON: Professors are excellent, but not as excellent as UW<br>  PRO: Students are quite relaxed, perhaps not as "seriously studious"<br>  CON: Students are quite relaxed, perhaps not as "seriously studious"

dR0WKc8Saa	1. You would be able to fly for free, on a stand by basis, anywhere the airline you work for flies in the domestic us.  International flights you will have to pay a fee.<br>  2.  Not much, you probably will start around $10/hr.<br>  3.  The non-us airlines are better than airlines from the us. Better pay and benefits<br>  4.Be prepared to be disrespected like you've never been before by irrate passengers, and you do more than just collect tickets. There is a lot of responcibility working for an airline, having to make sure you follow faa regulations, time restraints, etc.|`|bvzJ9hAbaa	I don't know the answer to the first three questions, they vary by airline.  But the fourth one, the answer is YES, it's a hard job -- especially when the weather turns bad.  As soon as a flight is delayed by 10 minutes, some of your clients will begin swearing at you and accusing you of doing it deliberately to foul up their day.  The longer the delay, the worse their behaviour will become.  Others will demand special treatment, because they are more important than anyone else waiting.  It's not inconceivable that you could be physically attacked.  I've seen that happen twice in my travel experiences.  Then the irate passenger gets charged, and you have to take time off to go to their trial and testify.  I love to travel, but they would have to offer me a salary of at least $200 thousand, and/or unlimited free first class travel for life before I would even consider the job.  And I'm only speaking as a passenger who is affected by the negative behaviour of all the obnoxious boors out there!|`|NARiXGNDaa	yh you would get free tickets once a year <varys on airline, and specific job> normally you would get paid ￡15000 ish not very sure tho, and i think gulf air is the BEST!love it loads, they have quality if not emirates...<br>  <br>  xx|`|1bTYCUDkaa	1. No, your tickets will be discounted, to a nominal price.  Not free.<br>  2. Salary is depending on the airline.  Call them to find the average salary.<br>  3. Any airline is good.<br>  4. The job requires great tolerance for rude behavior, and strength (physical).
S8mAO0L5aa	I just came back from Dubai!! It's so beautiful, bring a camera, it it's digital, bring lots of memory, you'll need it. So first, Durhams, the money in the UAE, is something like one dollar to .367 durhams. so things like 100 durhams would be 30 something dollars, trust me, you'll need to know this so you don't accidentally buy something you thought was cheaper, I did that. If you go to souq (the bargaining stores) just try your bargaining skills, they're willing to lower prices and they have a lot of cool souvenirs. If you want to go into a mosque, which I highly recommend, bring something you can cover your head with, if you're a girl. And also just make sure to cover you're hole body except hands are fine. On the beaches, or a resort, don't worry about what you wear, bring shorts and tshirts they're fine with that. You could wear shorts and tshirts in public, they'll understand they're dress code doesn't really apply to you since you live in a place without a dress code, in public they're not as strict as you think, just the mosques. you're going to want to bring shorts though. Make sure to bring a jacket, it's only warm from 9 to 4 there. Also ask your hotel staff about tours. There's a Big Red Bus tour, I hightly recommend, it takes you to 20+ stopes that are very popular there. Also Abu Dhabi is close by, I recommend going there, there's a tour you can do with sand bashing and sand boarding and camel riding. It's so pretty at the dunes and it was the funnest I had on the trip. You should try going to a grand mosque, inside of one if you can. They usually have them open to guests, just make sure to cover up and bring socks (you'll have to take off your shoes when inside) it's amazing in them.

KS2OHXCRaa	You could take line 12 but line 13 would be a better option. There are a couple less stops travelling on line 13, so that should save a little time. You should be able to get between the two places in about 20 minutes time. <br>  <br>  If you're considering taxi, it'll take a good 10 minutes if there aren't any problem with the traffic. <br>  <br>  There's no harm familiarising yourself with the layouts of the two train stations, and identify where you should go to enter/exit the metro stations if you're going to travel by metro. Here are the links to the relevant maps:<br>  <br>  Gare St Lazare : <a href="http://bonjourlafrance.com/france-trains/stations/saint-lazare-station.htm" rel="nofollow">http://bonjourlafrance.com/france-trains...</a><br>  Gare Montparnasse : <a href="http://bonjourlafrance.com/france-trains/stations/gare-montparnasse-station.htm" rel="nofollow">http://bonjourlafrance.com/france-trains...</a><br>  <br>  I'd advise staying calm, because I found from experience that in a rushed mindset, I'm more likely to miss details that's relevant to my travel, and therefore taking more time because I've missed the sign to my platform and have to backtrack etc.<br>  <br>  Safe travel!|`|Ohqon05Raa	Just take the metro.

AA10042296	Today, the exchange rate is one dollar to  14.93 pesos.  But if you convert them at the hotel or buy something at a shop with dollars, you'll probably get something closer to 10 pesos for your dollar.<br>  But at that exchange rate, hotels and shop keepers in the toursit areas (like Cancun and Puerto Vallarta) are happy to take your dollars.  They're making about 40 percent when they cash them in at an exchange (cambio).  They're making a lot more, from you, than if you had paid in pesos.|`|bVbFAyzjaa	no.  you have to trade them in for pesos.|`|e9YFTyzZaa	YES, of course you can. I live in California.<br>  BUT, you better know the Value of the Peso vs Dollar...so you don't OVERPAY....because they will rob you BLIND, if given the opportunity!!|`|numvvSDqaa	ok in the big stores you can pay with dollar. you wont have any problems, mayba in the little stores. but you can change its in any bank,|`|UZFrCWWxaa	yes in tourist places that are hight like in cacun or in yucatan or high costly resturants in puebla mexico city|`|Cpmfx6L9aa	Some places in Mexico take the American dollar.|`|SIUKasInaa	Technically no,<br>  but most places will take your dollar as payment,<br>  <br>  keep in mind since the rates for currency constantly fluctuate, <br>  paying in dollars keeps you at the mercy of the current rate,<br>  <br>  some shop owners will give you a better rate while others wont.<br>  and most shops, restaurants and merchants will take your dollar and give you pesos in change. so be witty because the ball is in their court when it comes to two currencies plus an exchange rate.|`|aat0rPuoaa	yes you definitely can, actually, many mexicans prefer american money.  Just watch though, their exchange rates vary due to most mexicans making up random numbers, so you are best to research what the difference is between a dollar and ten pesos before you go there.
9d8db7cf9f6c11246583829f3005173aaa	No, they have not processed visas there in several years.  Better to get your visa well in advance of your trip.  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://PandaVisa.com" rel="nofollow">http://PandaVisa.com</a>|`|kdjB33lFaa	no, i think they discontinued that since the olympics.. check wikitravel, they offer indepth explanations for things such as visa etc.|`|MMbJiKGdaa	Yes, they process the visas at the border. <br>  <br>  When I travel from Shenzhen to Hong Kong it costs $34 HKD from Luo Hu (Lo Wu) to Tsim Sha Tsui East with the MTR. Train is your best bet. You could also go to Lok Ma Chau, but I don't know if they have visa processing there.<br>  <br>  There's a small government office in Lo Wu (Luo Hu in Shenzhen) tucked away that handles the visas. They would only give a 30 days visit one entry. The CTS (China Travel Service), will not process visas. They only direct you to their Kowloon office. They will not process the same day. <br>  <br>  However, the visa policy is changing on March 1st, 2009. <br>  <br>  On March 1st, they will process visas on the same day. (For an extra fee)<br>  <br>  However, this information, I got off a guy working at a travel agency in Hong Kong, who said that before March 1st, the best visas they could give anyone is 90 days, double entry and it requires 1 or 2 working days. On March 1st, they can give you a 6 month multiple entry visa, and process it in 4 hours.|`|PxwTDDGkaa	I think you can go to Hong Kong to get a China Visa.
pK6esTuYaa	The purse is really cute and very trendy, but I don't think its the best for traveling. First off, the purse strap is very thin - someone could easily cut if from behind if they wanted something in it. Also, the purse hangs really low so it would be easy again for someone to reach into it and take out the things they want. I suggest you either find a more practical purse for traveling or you can maybe alter it a bit so the strap is thicker and shorter (you might be able to get this done at a tailor's.) Anywhere you go traveling you have the possibility of running into people that can steal from you so I hope you prepare by changing up the purse.

True most of our cities are flat and geographically not the most interesting places, the exceptions to this are Sydney around the harbour and Hobart (my home town) which is built in the foothills of Mt Wellington along the Derwent river.<br>  Tasmania is an outdoors mans paradise,the Overland trek is considered one of the best hiking experiences in the world along with the South West wilderness, Cradle Mountain Lake St Clair and Feycinet offer something extrodinary<br>  The Blue Mountains west of Sydney (also a world heritage wilderness) is where they recently discovered the wollemi pine thought to be extinct for 10 of millions of years right on the doorstep of a city of 5 million<br>  All throughout SE Australia are unique experiences both in geography and the environment, so yes I belive it is a place well worth the investment in time|`|gAOAdOHraa	If you find travelling boring then I doubt you will find the coast of Australia any different.  You will probably think it just as boring as the other places.   To me it is the best place in the world and I never get bored with travelling and seeing new things.
7Xiz8iwPaa	These people are fools, take it from a fellow 18 year old. San Francisco is a great city and has so much to offer! If i were you, i would take a day to just walk around as much of the city as you possibly can!! Start at the wharf/north beach, go to china town, go downtown, go to the presido and marina district, go to the richmond, go to the sunset, walk through golden gate park, and finally visit the castro! If you are into art, you will be so intrigued the the landscape of the entire city! There are many high points on the hills that you can climb up. When ever you see a hill, with trees or just houses, try to climb up as high as you can on that hill and just look around! there are so many spots i do this when i want to get away! <br>  <br>  If you are an art and music freak, haight-ashbury will be your sanctuary! There are so many boutique stores, thrift stores, hippies, and artistic influences. If you go up to the top of upper haight street, you will find amoeba records. I don't know if you are familiar with it, but it is the most amazing music store in the world! It has pretty much everything and you can buy a lot of cd's used, which makes them a lot cheaper! <br>  <br>  I don't know if you are, but i am really into film. There are so many historical theaters in the city and they are definitely worth checking out! The Castro Theater is may favorite. It is in the Castro where the best picture nominated movie MILK was filmed! I saw the movie there and it was amazing! <br>  <br>  The Golden Gate Park also has a lot to offer! There are many museums and pretty sites. I really think you would just love exploring the whole city. Don't limit yourself to the tourist attractions. They are over crowed and over hyped. The real San Francisco is away from pier 39, away from golden gate bridge, its in the different districts, where people live and write history! <br>  <br>  Im sure you will have a blast, there is so much to see here!|`|e6deba47bc9cb7fb188c260b4681f676aa	You will have a great time.

Absolutely the most awesome place, trust me, It's free on Wednesdays.<br>  <br>  If you like hiking there are numerous hiking trails in the neighbouring areas as well as great bicycling trails. Oakland, Albany and Berkeley are very close by. <br>  <br>  In Berkeley, there is Telegraph which is like Height Ashbury.<br>  There is an amazingly weird place called the Albany bulb which is right next to the Golden Gate Fields horse racing place that has amazing man-made metalwork sculptures along it's tip as the bulb is made up of what used to be a metal and concrete dump (NO TRASH, JUST METAL AND CONCRETE). There are giant metal sculptures of dinosaurs and Jesus there with his beard made of twisted metal and a series of 20 murals painted beautifully out on old pieces of wood.East of Oakland there is the strange INDIAN ROCK amongst other things and more great hiking trails up in the foothills behind Oakland|`|EJpiaCMQaa	San Francisco has three fantastic art museums:  The Fine Arts Museum of San Francisco, The Asian Art Museum of San Franciso, and The San Francisco Museum of Modern Art.

kMK9E2a7aa	I live near Nerja and the cheapest way may be hiring a car. However, if you want to go there straight from your flight, then Taxi is the only way. There is a bus from the airport (No.19) which will take you direct to Málaga bus station where you can transfer to a bus to Nerja. It will be cheaper, but if you are tired from your flight, then the taxi is the best option. I would say 175€ for both journeys is about the norm.<br>  <br>  Nerja may be the longest journey on the Costa Del Sol, but Nerja is by far the best place for a holiday on the Costa del Sol. It is a beautiful Spanish town by the sea. The whole area is stunning.|`|KRTPJP2baa	€175 is a total rip off. When you go out of the main door at the airport then on the wall on the right is a list of taxi fares to various destinations. By law drivers are not supposed to charge more. There is no train service to Nerja but there should be a bus service from the central bus station.<br>  Edit:<br>  I've just seen that the €175 included the return. In which case it is probably not over the top as Nerja is one of the more distant destinations for taxis from Malaga airport (would still be a lot cheaper by bus)<br>  <br>  Additional:<br>  See this previous question with exactly what you are looking for<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20070819172210AAbTNX4">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>

mx32BnQAaa	Greece has a Mediterranean climate with plenty of sunshine, mild temperatures and a limited amount of rainfall. Due to the country's geographical position, its rugged relief and its distribution between the mainland and the sea, there is great variation in Greece's climate.<br>  In summer, the dry hot days are cooled by seasonal winds called the meltemi, while mountainous regions have generally lower temperatures.<br>  The winters are mild in lowland areas, with a minimum amount of snow and ice, yet, mountains are usually snow-covered. Moreover, a common phenomenon is the occurrence of different climactic conditions during the same season (for instance, mild heat in coastal areas and cool temperatures in mountainous regions).~|`|AA10421518	GREECE is a country.

There are hundreds of interesting museums & historical sites in the Netherlands and it's extremely tourist friendly.

I went on a cruise the first week and my itinary was jam packed, we visted lots of temples valley of the kings etc, it is very cheap in egypt and u can get some very good deals as well.  However, i appreciate that sight seeing may not interest u as much especially with going with your child.  The red sea is more of a popular destination for beach holidys so sharm el sheik would be a good choice and probably more suitable if u only plan to go for a week.

The price also includes unlimited entry to a theme park and two hours a day at the onsite water park. You need to take your own car. The fact that the holiday is so cheap compensates for the poor exchange rate.|`|N48AvxIlaa	Australia.
1bTYCUDkaa	If the flight is very full, the airline will probably charge you a bunch, so take a really late night flight if possible.  If the aircraft is almost completely empty, the fare will be low, so you will buy the ticket.  Generally, no the prices do not go down towards the end of the month.|`|AA11496012	It depends on how full the flights are.  Airlines sell a certain number of tickets at a low price and a certain number at another price.  So the prices can range quite a bit.  If the flight is quite full, then the ticket prices may be higher.  You can check the travel websites to see how much ticket prices are.  Also see if AirTran flies from Atlanta to Houston.  Sometimes the discount airlines will have specials.|`|AzKUBp2Jaa	they usually get  higher as the date of travel get closer<br>  like I got $210.00 round trip fare Lax to Charlotte for march 1 which i booked in January<br>  check the prices the other day the same itinerary is now $550.50
1bTYCUDkaa	Now-a-days, travel websites do not send tickets in the mail.  Usually, the are by email, and on the day before your flight, go to the airline's website, and click "check-in online".  Enter your confirmation number and booking name.  There, you will receive a screen printable boarding pass.  Bring that to the airport with you.
b55f0e519614a0b70ec04c08eb33d605aa	Your choices are Boston Logan, Portland, ME or Manchester, NH.  I find that it's generally cheaper to fly in/out of Logan.  The expensive part of Logan is the parking - i.e. if you leave your car there for a few days.  Assuming your not parking a car in central parking - you won't have that problem.<br>  <br>  Manchester would be less hassle once your on the ground.  With Logan you can get a direct flight from San Jose.|`|Lngb8ryFaa	definitely manchester airport...manchester is only 57 miles away from meredith...boston is 107 miles away from meredith....also, manchester IS a cheap airport to fly into..i always drive from portland maine to the manchester airport to get the cheaper flight...definitely check out Southwest airlines for a ticket--they seem to have the best deals for flying into manchester

If so, Best Western Tria on Route 16 (Fresh Pond Parkway) on the border of Cambridge and Arlington usually has decent rates (under $100 right now), but where you'll really save money is with the free parking.  It's a short walk (5-7 minutes) from the Alewife T station (end of Red line).  I have friends who have stayed there several times, and like it.  Clean, safe, near a Whole Foods with a great prepared food section, so another way to save money.<br>  <br>  Lots of downtown hotels are charging $30+ per night for parking.
KdhNCnEjaa	Go for Burlington, Mass. It is only about 10-15 minutes out, and has a hotel called the Staybridge Suites which is really nice and really reasonable.|`|lys5kB9Daa	New Hampshire sucks. Look in Northboro, Westbourough, Shrewsbury, Sturbridge. Those are all nice safe towns about 40 minutes from Boston. Worcester would be cheap, it's about 50 minutes but not as quiet & safe as the others are small towns and Worcester is a huge city.<br>  Plus remember hotels are giving really good deals right now with the economy (I just booked Vegas woohoo) so you might be able to get a Boston hotel for not much. I have stayed at the Doubletree (there are like 5 diff ones, I was at the one near the convention center) and I think it was about $150 a night. It's probably cheaper right now.<br>  The traffic in Boston on game nights is insane, if the game is at 7, be sure to drive into the city at like 3pm, if you're not already spending the day in the city.|`|jPBwNICBaa	Well since I Iive about an hour and 20 minutes from Boston, this should be easy. I would look in the cities of Nashua NH, Manchester NH, or any suburb cities of Boston. But I would look in Nasuha cuz its Closer than Manchester. Even though Manchester isnt that far either. So look there first.

fd69272cc2b6016b2264e570e7b7a247aa	Wow, a travel-related question here, that's nice for a change! OK here we go: <br>  <br>  To see wildlife: best area is the Kinabatangan floodplain; a number of tour operators operate lodges in the Sukau area, I always go with SI Tours (<a href="http://www.sitoursborneo.com/public/aboutus.asp)." rel="nofollow">http://www.sitoursborneo.com/public/abou...</a> Their advantage: they take you by boat to Sukau, which increases your chances of seeing wildlife dramatically. Other operators insist that you go by road, which is two hours through palm oil plantations where you can see the occasional run over monitor lizard if you are lucky. Plus their food is the best, and their chalets always clean. Yes, I promote them shamelessely, but they deserve it! Budget wise, 3d/2n (don't got for just one night, too hectic and you see more if you are there for two nights) around RM1000+ per person. Budget options: Uncle Tan's (<a href="http://www.uncletan.com/)." rel="nofollow">http://www.uncletan.com/).</a> Accommodation is terribly basic, excursions in the area terribly exciting! Only enthusiastic comments from people I have sent there! Both agents are internet savvy so you can contact them for more details. <br>  <br>  There is also Tabin (<a href="http://www.intra-travel.com.my/)" rel="nofollow">http://www.intra-travel.com.my/)</a> which is really great for wildlife viewing (take the 3d/2n package), and Danum Valley. Danum is high end when it comes to the budget, Tabin mid range. <br>  <br>  Other places in Sabah offer less widlife. Kinabalu National Park is very nice (good hiking), and exciting if you are into bird watching but you need time. Nice accommodation though, freshly renovated. Budget to luxury price range. <br>  <br>  Mulu great trekking (nothing dramatic or hard-core though), fantastic forest, but no wildlife. In Sarawak, to see wild animals go to Lambir National Park for a night, or my favourite: Bako National Park close to Kuching. Stay a night or two! High-end option: Red Ape Trail by Borneo Adventure, in the Ulu Batang Ai area (4-5 days; <a href="http://www.borneoadventure.com/public/home/default.asp)." rel="nofollow">http://www.borneoadventure.com/public/ho...</a><br>  <br>  Shots: the regular stuff updated; something against Malaria is not really neccessary though doctors will want to sell you expensive meds... bring along plenty of mosquito repellent (and sunscreen and an umbrella), and maybe buy locally Malarone as a stand-by treatment for Malaria if you go for really hardcore trekking for a week or so... it is a fraction of the price you pay in European / American countries. <br>  <br>  More inspiration about Sabah: <a href="http://www.sabahtravelguide.com/welcome.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.sabahtravelguide.com/welcome....</a>  <br>  <br>  Happy Travelling!|`|0exde9VEaa	Borneo ?

ZRG7wEf9aa	No worries Katie.  The total cost to check four bags would be $365.  The airlines want to discourage you from adding extra weight to the airplane, and using more jet fuel during the flight.  I suggest that you pack two boxes, and have UPS or FedEx come to your home and pick them up.  You'll save a load of money.  Do not just give the shipper a suitcase as they will not be liable for the condition of the suitcase and safety of the contents.

To drive around is going to take a lot of time but you will see more of the country than you would from a plane. Also if you are considering traveling by train be sure there is one that runs to the places you want to see.

Our trains are slower, not on time as often, and the tracks are often bumpy as they are owned and maintained by the cargo companies.<br>  <br>  Renting a car is relatively cheap, so that's certainly one way to go.  Rideshares can be a lot of fun, save you some cash, and are a great way to meet new people.  Craigslist.org and Couchsurfing.com are both great places to find rideshares.  <br>  <br>  Some of the regional airlines (like Southwest) also run occasional deals which can make regional air travel a more affordable option.<br>  <br>  travel well!

C8ofnXq9aa	It really depends on what you plan to do out there.<br>  NZ is one of the most beautiful country's in the world, so if you like good scenery & dramatic landscapes it would be a shame not to see some of the country and of course trips always cost money.<br>  <br>  Food, drink and most day to day items cost roughly the same as here in the UK. <br>  Accomodation can be cheaper if your standards are not high.<br>  Public transport costs are much as in the UK but many remote parts can only be reached by car. Hiring vehicles or taxis is a bit more expensive than the UK.<br>  <br>  I guess a good way to work it out is plan what you intend to do and spend based on UK prices. Convert that lot into NZ dollars and add 20 to 30% for unexpected things.<br>  <br>  Remember just because family has offered you some free accomodation it does not mean that you should take advantage. <br>  Taking your hosts out for a meal or buying a large bunch of flowers should be included in your calculations<br>  <br>  How I envy you.

ZRG7wEf9aa	Yes you can check all of the above in your luggage.  It's always a good idea to put wet/gels into a plastic bag.  My one concern with checking your nebulizer, is what would happen to you if it was lost or stolen?  I've had bags lost for up to a week.  If you can't live without it, carry it on.|`|Il0QA1Hcaa	Use a diaper bag and carry it on with you. If you have one of the new ones they will fit in the front pocket of most carry ons. Make sure you keep your inhaler with you no matter what. You are allowed a carry on and a purse so if you use a diaper bag instead of a purse I don't think anything will be said, but check with the airlines. You can also purchase an over sized purse if need be.
1ab8cee1141a9c2947e3a140c1b98511aa	I have taken my nebulizer on airplanes both as carry-on and checked baggage. The same with medication. It may get your bag flagged for extra attention, but it should make it through alright.|`|1bTYCUDkaa	Your nebulizer is permitted as carry-on, but since you will not need it, it is also allowed in checked baggage.  Ointments are also permitted in checked-baggage.  It is always a good idea to place liquids in gels in baggies, even in checked baggage, just in case they explode.
AA11496012	See if Southwest Airlines has anything.  AirTran also flies from New York to Texas but you will probably have to connect in Atlanta.  JetBlue flies to Austin I think out of JFK.

On tripadvisor, they have received 4 out 5 in the ratings with 90 reviews.<br>  <br>  The hotel is on the newer side and all the rooms offer modern amenities like a flat-screen TV and free high-speed Internet plus convenient features like a furnished balcony overlooking the water, microwave and mini fridge.<br>  <br>  The hotel is located across the street from the beach and even offers beach rentals. On property, they have two dining options and an Infinity pool overlooking the Intracoastal Waterway. Hope this helps. Good luck.|`|CzNxbsmsaa	The service is usually below par and the condition of the hotel is below standards Any Crown Plaza is overrated and over priced.The service is below par and the cleanliness and condition of the hotel also.For what you would expect and spend there,find a Hyatt or Marriott brand if you are looking for a full service hotel that is glad their guests are there.
c290b7856214fd8baaebf9e77a554dffaa	We have a caravan and have found it increasingly necessary to book as more people seem to be using campsites.<br>  <br>  I would recommend joining the caravan club, about ￡35 a year. Not only do you get access to all of their over 200 full facility sites, (some are open to non members), you also get to use around 3000 certificated locations, CL's as they are known. Open only to Members.<br>  <br>  These are sites licensed by the caravan club and are allowed up to 5 vans without planning permission, but are regulated and inspected by the caravan club.They are cheap - usually around half the cost of full facility campsites. The owners are usually friendly and helpful and many of the sites are in beautiful locations.<br>  <br>  Many are on farms, or behind pubs, in the grounds of stately homes etc. Some have only basic facilities - water, waste and toilet disposal. Others have electric hook ups , showers etc.<br>  <br>  You might also consider, for maximum choice The Camping & Caravan Club, they are similar, but also take tents. They have about 100 full sites, plus Forest Holiday sites. They also have around 1500 certificated sites. Cost about the same as the Caravan Club.<br>  <br>  If you join both clubs, you can probably do your holiday without booking in advance, just phone ahead when you are ready to move - you should find somewhere with a space, especially if you avoid Bank Holidays.|`|BhlGe0A8aa	If you have a caravan it is a good idea to become a member of the Caravan Club.<br>  It may cost you something to join but it is well worthwhile ,as they have their own campsites and can give you advice on finding places to stay.<br>  If you do not want to do that then I suggest you book up as quickly as possible as sites for caravans get taken as early as January.<br>  My friend who has a caravan always books at least 8 months in advance.|`|k6IFEGYzaa	I would book. Due to current situation more people will be holidaying at home this year.
AA10368727	Yeah, no one ever said the airline business made any sense.<br>  <br>  Airline ticket prices fluctuate greatly from day-to-day based on a number of factors.  The bottom line is that when you agreed to the terms and conditions by purchasing the ticket, you agreed to the $150 change fee if you made a change to the reservation for any reason.<br>  <br>  Airlines are bleeding cash now, and they need as many ways to nickel and dime the travellers to death in order to have any hope of making any money.  They're not likely to budge in anything where they can make additional money off you over and above the price of your ticket.<br>  <br>  My advice: Next time, fly Southwest, the airline that doesn't charge change fees (you still have to pay whatever the difference in fare is, but there's no change fee), and there's no bag fees.|`|sBCUKi5Yaa	Most all airlines charge a 'change' fee if you want to make changes to your return flight after purchase/issuance of ticket. When you made the purchase, you should have looked up their change policy and you would have known. It is their policy to collect a change fee. If your ticket fare allows it, you are able to try for earlier/later flight on the same day. I don't think you will be able to skip the fee in this case. Sorry.
lys5kB9Daa	I dont think you would need too too much since you're mainly there for the conference and not for vacation. The restaurants are average priced just like any other city really. My favorite is Quincy Market/Faneuil Hall- it's got every kind of food all stuffed in this one 300 year old building- sushi, clam chowder, pizza, subs, ice cream, indian, whatever you want! You must get a clam chowder bread bowl they are to die for. I like to go sit on the upstairs and just people watch over the balcony. The food is all pretty cheap too most meals there are under $10 and you could go back and try something new a few times! <br>  Fire & Ice is a cool place- it's all raw food (steak, chicken, shrimp, pasta, veggies, burgers, etc, etc) and you bring it up to this huge grill where they cook in front of you. It's all you can eat for about $20-25.<br>  My mom one time was walking and she saw some contrsuction workers eating pizza and asked them where they got it- they pointed her down some alley and she said she got the best pizza of her life for about $1/slice- I'm not sure where it was but ask locals like she did!<br>  <br>  For cheap shopping stay away from Newbury Street & Copley Mall those are all the upscale/designer stores. Go to H & M in downtown crossing (1/4 mile from Quincy Market). it's a great clothing store where everything is really reasonabley priced pants are like $40 and sweaters are like $25. I'm sad I moved and there's no H&M out here!<br>  Also in that area of downtown crossing there are alot of street vendors where you can get boston t-shirts and knick-knacks for cheap.<br>  <br>  I dont know where you're staying but there's a T station in downtown crossing (actually underneath Filene's basement, well Macy's now) so you can take the T there for about 1.25, I would recommend this and not a cab.<br>  Oh yea you should check out the harbor too- go out the back entrance of Quincy Market and walk straight across the street you will end up in the harbor, there are really pretty flower arches you can hang out under and watch the water.|`|twCIv1WNaa	Boston has several different types of food options:<br>  <br>  <$10 - Sandwiches from gourmet groceries, food vendors at Quincy Market (Faneuil Hall), Viga (Italian - pizza, calzones, sandwiches - several outlets around the city; just open at noon), B Good (burgers - several places around the city), slices of pizza, one dish (noodles, tofu, lunch specials, etc.) at a Chinatown restaurant, food courts in places like Pru Center<br>  <br>  $10 - 20 - A pretty good meal in a non-fancy ethnic restaurant - Chinese, Greek, Italian, Thai, Vietnamese, Indian, or casual American - burgers, fish sandwhich and chips, etc. . . . Indian lunch buffets are a great value for about $12, depending on where you are.<br>   <br>  $20 and up - fancier restaurants - some are much higher.  Steakhouses tend to be pretty pricey here; seafood maybe a little less.<br>  If you order wine or other drinks, that will add a lot to the bill.<br>  <br>  These are just generalizations - you'll see some variation by neighborhood, although most Boston neighborhoods have lots of great choices.  You can find more Boston restaurant info here:  <a href="http://www.boston-discovery-guide.com/boston-restaurants.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.boston-discovery-guide.com/bo...</a>   Sales tax here is 5%, and tips are usually 15-20%<br>  <br>  As for other living expenses, you may want to budget for a few rides on the T (subway) - get a Charlie Card (not a Charlie Ticket) at the station and load money onto it if you're going to ride a few times - individual tickets are $2, but only $1.70 with the card.<br>  <br>  Any other expenses would be about the same as at home.

The Istro-Romanians are the closest ethnic group to the Romanians, and it is believed they left Maramure?, Transylvania about a thousand years ago and settled in Istria, Croatia.<br>  <br>  Most of these peoples are white and the only thing you need to be cuacasin is white its not a race question but a ethinicity question. your asiking.<br>  <br>  Oh and the reason people dont know where Romania is, Is because the are slow Americans who dont care about anything but fast food

wVNwoEfCaa	Lupines presumes to know what people criticise and don't criticise.  She can not know what other forums you go on, for all she knows you protest Darfur, and other atrocities as much as the one in Gaza, or how the Palestinians are treated as a whole.  I have been told many times here to go protest something else, such as Darfur, which I already have done, and continue to do.  This is wishful thinking on the part of people like this.  They want you to go away, and criticise someone else.  It takes the spotlight off of them.<br>  The reason many Zionists do this is because the word Anti-Semite has a very strong meaning in the world, and it means that not only do you hate Jews, but you agree with the idea of the Holocaust, but you are also a Holocaust denier, and therefore a very low person.  Now, most people who criticise Israel are none of these things.  But, because most people do not want to be associated with this traits stated above, they will think twice about their criticism, which is exactly the objective, to stem any criticism justly or unjustly of Israel.  Because to them, it is one in the same.  But many people are now seeing through that, and because of it's over use, the word has little meaning any more,  There is nothing wrong with legitimate criticism of a government, and it's policies and wrong doing.  If you hate Jews as individuals, that is where the problem begins.  If you hate ANYONE for their race or religion, that is also a problem.|`|BKrVqOgiaa	I agree 1000% with Maya...I criticize my own government and I'm not anti-American.   I plainly want a BETTER America.<br>  Israelis and their supporters (and yes, Kevin, one can be a pro-Zionist Jew WITHOUT being an Israeli; sorry to burst your bubble there) haven't got anything they can use to "justify" their thoughts and actions with except to holler "anti-Semitism!"---which is so silly it's almost funny; as Palo correctly points out, Arabs are Semites.  <br>  The world is turning against Israel (including the U.S.) and Israel will blame it all on "anti-Semitism", rather than place the blame on themselves, where it rightly belongs.   The government of one nation cannnot blatantly kill, maim, torment and displace a group of people---the Palestinians---without suffering the consequences at some point.|`|HsgEFrJMaa	It's a sleazy gimmick,and you may draw your own conclusions from that. Obviously no other nation on earth hides behind alleged ethnic bigotry to fend off criticism. I don't see the Russian Federation squalling and screeching that so-and-so is "anti-Slavonic" whenever their government is criticised.|`|iCMrsV9daa	How can we be anti-semetic when we are semitic? I dont get it? We are anti-ourselves?|`|hOf38vgpaa	Lupines: "Why do you keep criticizing Israel all the time when there are other peoples in this world that do the same things too and you don't criticize them? And why can't I call you an antisemite when it is so obvious that is exactly what you are doing, using Israel as excuse to criticize just Jewish people?"<br>  <br>  Let me first say that I support the existence of Israel. I don't regard all Palestinians as innocent victims. However, I do not understand your reasoning. You seem to be suggesting there are many murderers in the world so why focus on my little murder? That is just nonsense. <br>  <br>  Israel got caught in a time warp. In the late 19th & early 20th century Western European countries saw nothing ethically wrong with using military force to conquer territories occupied by non European natives, drawing borders, taking political control, then settling those lands with Europeans. Europeans had a history of doing this. For example, this model was used to settle Europeans in the Americas and Australia. The Zionist idea of settling European Jews in Israel along the same lines, was also crafted in the late 19th century, when it made complete sense. However, by the middle of the 20 th century, this model suddenly fell out of favor, when it became seen as morally and ethically wrong to subject  a native population to massive migrations of Europeans.  Consequently, in 1947 Britain withdrew from China, India & the Middle East. Eventually, France and Italy also followed suit and pulled out of their former colonies in the Middle East & North Africa. So, it is not correct that everyone is doing it, why should not Israel? Israel is trying to go forward on a plan crafted in the 18th century whose ethics are now in question.  Most of the laws that authorized the creation of Israel were passed by the League of Nations, when Euopean nations were it's members. A country like Israel could never be created in today's UN. I dont think these realities should be ignored. By suggesting that people who are concerned with the welfare of the natives (Palestinians)  are anti-semitic ignores these realities and suggests people have to be insensitive to native cultures to be Jewish.<br>  <br>  Edit 1: Lupines, why not clue me in?|`|mXCDJ9jYaa	Apparently they think they are supposed to be above criticism because they are "jewish" whatever that means; most of these so-called Jews I've known are just athiests of Russian ancestry. In any event it isn't particular to the the Bizarro State,they react with that kind of infantile name calling whenever they are criticised. No takes it seriously anymore. As you see from the above name-calling is pretty all they are cabable of.|`|pgAnh6f7aa	As pointed out,they obviously think it should be above criticism. Because it is "jewish". Anything jewish should be above criticism. Any criticism is "anti-semitic" which actually means Hostile to the Arabic and Hebrew Languages. Ironically,it was concocted by an antijewish 19th century antijewish writer. Wilhelm Marr was his name as I recall.|`|wVsjgj35aa	Apparently it is at least somewhat effective in stifling dissent or they wouldn't do it. I'll have to give it try and see what happens. I've seen a lot of people get accused of it but I've never known of anyone to ask if the accuser was personally Jewish in any event. So I guess it doesn't matter. Bottom line: from now on anyone who dares to even think anything critical of me is to be castigated in a Most Vociferous Fashion as one of those gosh-darn anti-semite neo-nazi skin-head holocaust deniers with secret connections to David Duke and Iran to boot. <br>  <br>  Frankly,at this point the term has so little credibility left after decades of abuse and overuse it's like rain going off a tin roof. But reporters are still scared of it,so there is a task ahead for the future. I see no reason why reportorial fear of this stale accusation should not be included in the next edition of the Diagnostic Symptoms Manuel as an identifiable phobia. That is to say,as an irrational fear.|`|tod8jy9Paa	I hate Israels government but that does not mean that I hate all Israelis and certainly not all Jewish people. Its never good to paint all people with the same brush. I have had many Jewish friends but none were in the Israeli brutal government Olmert and his corrupt government should all be taken to the Hague and tried for crimes against humanity.Olmert still faces charges of fraud so even that speaks for itself.|`|lCW3Worpaa	Because we let them get away with it.  Next time someone calls you 'antisemitic' because you question the actions of the illegitimate 'state of Israel', simply laugh out loud in their face.

AA10484764	1) Well, considering it is an urbanized area you won't see many! But if you go hiking around, that area is known for its variety of mushrooms, along with chestnut trees. As for animals you may see a hedgehog if you are lucky! <br>  2) The city is in the middle of a valley, surrounded by tall mountains on all sides. Because of this, Bellinzona is a long city, rather than circular like most European cities.<br>  3) Bellinzona is well-known because it is home to 3 UNESCO World Heritage Sites: 3 magnificent castles. Other then that, Bellinzona is known as the party city for the region, hosting many activities such as the yearly Carneval (known to be the liveliest in Switzerland), and many bars and clubs. It also has a good market on Saturday mornings. In addition, there is good hiking around, 2 ski resorts 20 minutes by train, Lugano (the region's largest city) sits on Lago di Ceneri 30 minutes to the south, while Locarno on Lago Maggiore is 20 minutes west, Zurich is about 2 hours north, and Milan is 1.5 hour south.<br>  4) That depends on the time of year! It is cold and snowy in the winter, while summer is hot and slightly humid.<br>  5) There are really no dangerous elements to traveling in Bellinzona. There are no gangs, pick-pocketing is rare, if ever. Switzerland, in general, is a very safe country.|`|Ra9A6tcZaa	1)what are some plants and animals i might see?

3a72ae0c30ef90de390ceb62b46fb44aaa	Though not Rome's intention, it allowed Christianity to spread and flourish throughout Western Civilization. Rome, unified under one government, made possible the passing of information very quickly, thus greatly assisting the spread of Christianity. Even in the wake of persecution from such rulers as Diocletian and Maximian, Christianity continued to grow in strength. People were converted daily to this attracting faith. Men like St. Paul, who before becoming a Christian was a heavy persecutor of them, fervently preached the growing faith, adding more to their numbers. In addition, the cold religion of the Romans made Christianity extremely appealing, as Christianity offered a personal relationship with a deity who offered an everlasting life of beatitude after death. With the weakening government of Rome, the Christian church began to seize the power that the state lost, allowing more and more converts to be won over to the faith. Also, with the rise of the ruler, Constantine, who made Christianity legal, Christianity took the upper hand as Christian laws were passed and enforced. During Rome's reign, the spread of Christianity flourished, making way for Christianity to evolve from a small following of people to an accepted faith of multitudes. This incredible, though unintentional, contribution forever changed the course of history.|`|yUr33ybAaa	- Roman Catholic church<br>    and all the splinter chruches with those patriachs, those claims of lineage from apostols and stuff<br>  - Belief of Trinity<br>    And all those councils where they got togather and put in their own principles into Christianity.<br>  - Christmas day celebrations<br>    Christmas is a remake of a Roman holday.<br>  - GoodFriday & Easter<br>    Of all birth/death days, why is that only here is where a preference is given to day as in Thursday/Friday... over date like 1st, 2nd etc??<br>  <br>  You asked for four, So i just gave that.

etIBdVE3aa	it's an FMT (Forma Migratoria Turista) that will be issued as you enter mexico. if they let you in by land without it. be sure and get back to the immigration booth or window and get your FMT other wise when you are at the airport they will fine you $200.00 USD for not having it plus you have to wait about 2 hrs at the airport to get permission to leave.<br>  <br>  Now. there is no way to get back into the US by land or air if you do not have a US Passport. The US is also issuing passport cards to cross the border by land.<br>  <br>  Be sure and have yours, unless you want some un-wanted troubles.|`|h6NqNzHAaa	Yes you need a passport to get into Mexico and get on the plane and get back into the US|`|818a6c4a96262d3d9669cd5c91b5efaeaa	No, you do not.  Passports are NOT needed for LAND travel to and from Mexico until June 1.  See site below.  To travel within Mexico, you just need your I.D.  The FMT is the tourist card you will get at the border.    It will allow you to visit in Mexico up to 180 days without a visa.  It has nothing to do with a passport.
p4FuV9NMaa	There are taxis everywhere at the airport.   You won't need to call anyone.   But, if I were you, I would just take the train into town.   It's the Leonardo Express and it should take you to Rome's central station or Termini.   From there you can just jump on the subway to go your destination.|`|PiGqg0EMaa	Taxis are everywhere in Rome to signal 1 just wave when you see one they will park next to you.|`|1Vih78dZaa	The second responder said how you should always use one an official taxi; she's absolutely right.<br>  <br>  What she didn't explain very well is how you can recognise an officially licenced taxi.<br>  <br>  All the official cabs in Rome are white and have a large seal of the city of Rome on the front doors. They will also, as the earlier responder said, have a taxi meter and, as others have mentioned, they are required by law to charge you no more than a set fee to get from the airport into the centre of Rome.<br>  <br>  There will almost certainly be a lot of taxis waiting outside the airport (whether it's Fumicino or Ciampino you're flying into), but you're also like to be approached by people offering you a taxi as you come out of the arrivals gate. Ignore them; they want to get you into an unofficial cab which will, at best, rip you off and, at worst, rip you off and not take you where you want to go.<br>  <br>  Go outside the terminal and you'll find lots of white taxis you can use with some degree of confidence.<br>  <br>  Alternatively, you could take the other advice offered here and use the shuttle train. It's cheap, fast and frequent.<br>  <br>  You will, of course, probably then need to use a taxi to get from the station to your hotel, so the advice above is still relevant.<br>  <br>  I hope you enjoy your visit.|`|j38AUPjOaa	Outside of Fiumicino and Ciampino airports you'll find a lot of taxi. It won't be a problem to catch one. Just beware to don't catch an irregular one: a regular taxi MUST HAVE the taxi sign on its roof and the driver MUST turn on the taximeter. If they don't, just ask him to stop and get down from it: you'd pay more.<br>  <br>  The FIXED price for a journey from Fiumicino airport to Termini Station is 50€ (60$, more or less).<br>  <br>  If i can give you a little suggestion: you don't need to take a taxi to arrive into the city. From Fiumicino you can quietly take a train: the station is just in front of the airport. The ticket costs 9.50€ to Termini Station and 5€ to Tiburtina Station. From Ciampino you can take a bus to Termini Station: the ticket costs 8€, and the bus arrives to Termini Station.<br>  <br>  If you'll need a taxi during your stay in Rome, you can call one of these numbers:<br>  <br>  06/6645<br>  06/4994<br>  06/4157<br>  06/88177|`|a9jMOJeHaa	u dont need to call one.there are planty outside the airport waiting for clients.if u need to go in city center they will charge u minimum euro 40 and for the same price u can book a private car service NCC is like taxi but more nice...as bmw ..luxury car and they are professional.i called them lot of time when i had lot of bags and happend sometimes that i left some personal iteam in the car and they call me and bring back to me...is not going to happend with normal taxi.if u want save money u can take train from the airport to termini station where the ticket cost around euro 10 and take 30 minutes to get in city center|`|c7a41e789aa6515bd1104626dfbcd21aaa	the fixed price is 40 euro from and to fiumicino and 30 euro from and to Fiumicino.<br>  ALL INCLUDED<br>  <br>  (the destination must be in the centre of Rome)|`|ybexjS2Paa	There shouldn't be a problem getting taxi at the airport. I remember there were plenty of them waiting outside. Not cheap though and the drivers are crazy :)|`|2hlxMLmNaa	Hello,<br>  <br>  There are taxi ranks just outside the doors at the airport.  You stand in line and take the next available taxi.  There is a fixed rate of 40 euros to any hotel in the city center (inside the walls).  Make sure you let the driver know of this fee before you get into the taxi.  They are already aware of this fee but let them know that you know what the fee is so they don't overcharge you.  This fee is for 2 people with 2 bags each.  There is a supplement for late night or early morning pick-up or drop off.  Do not get into a taxi from anyone who approaches you and offers you a cab ride.  These are people who will try to double or triple charge you.  <br>  <br>  As suggested, you can take the leonardo express train to the termini station.  This will cost 11 euros.  The train comes every half hour and takes a half hour to get into the city.  You will have to handle your own luggage getting on and off the train.  <br>  <br>  You can also use a private car service like romecabs.com.  This will cost 50 euros but the driver will meet you outside of baggage claim, help you with your bags and take a credit card for payment.  You will not have to deal with lines at the taxi rank, worry about an honest cab driver or struggle with your luggage.  <br>  <br>  These are the 3 transport options from the FCO airport.  If you are coming into CIA the taxi fee is 30 and there is no express train to the termini.  You can still hire a private driver.<br>  <br>  Donna

AA10259042	The first responder gave you a good answer, but I have a problem with the size he recommends.  Many people do not like 10 power binoculars because the magnify hand shake too much.  A more popular binocular is 8 power.  Do you wear glasses?  If so you will need binoculars with a long eye relief of at least 17 mm.  It is good to have such a pair anyway in case you ever should.  Also 50 mm are really not necessary.  A 30 mm pair would prove quite sufficient and much smaller and lighter. This is a pretty decent pair and not too expensive.  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.eagleoptics.com/binoculars/bushnell/bushnell-natureview-plus-8x30-binocular" rel="nofollow">http://www.eagleoptics.com/binoculars/bu...</a>|`|jZYs4jahaa	With the binoculars, go for a good brand, that usually means very good glass. I checked the net a lot when I bought ond and I decided for a Nikon.<br>  As you'll go on a Mediterranean cruise, I suppose you'll have a lot of water around (beach, maybe rain, etc). So put some extra-money in an waterproof and fogproof binocular (Nikon calls them EX - Action Extreme).<br>  <br>  I don't know if you're going to do some bird-watching, but I suppose it'll be interesting to see some birds, considering the place you go.  For our birdwatching tours I have an old russian binocular and a new Nikon Action Extreme 8x40 (<a href="http://www.binoculars.com/binoculars/bird-watching-binoculars/8x40nikonactionextremeatb.cfm)" rel="nofollow">http://www.binoculars.com/binoculars/bir...</a><br>  <br>  However, considering that you'll surely have a lot of open space, huge areas, I would recommend a Nikon Action Extreme 10x50. (<a href="http://www.binoculars.com/binoculars/spectator-binoculars/10x50nikonactionextremeatb.cfm)." rel="nofollow">http://www.binoculars.com/binoculars/spe...</a> It's still good for bird-watching and in the same time allows you to see on long distances, with a good magnification.  Higher magnification binoculars make the image unstable so you might need a tripod to be able to look through it.

Dse8LFKfaa	I'm American, but my wife is Canadian- I go to Halifax several times a year and find it pretty nice. Canadians I know think of Halifax as a rather big city, but actually it's pretty small. There is a nice harbor area, much smaller than the Faneuil Hall area of Boston- and you can see the whole city in a couple of days. People are very polite, almost British in their mannerisms, and being a port city multiple cultures are represented.<br>  There are Universities so there is a pretty large population of young people- I think beer drinking is considered a sport.<br>  We live in NYC, and Canadians warned me about some of the unsafe areas in Halifax and I even walked around there at night and didn't feel there was any problem. If I was from an upscale suburb I might have felt some apprehension.<br>  There are beautiful natural areas close by- Nova Scotia has the Cabot Trail, which is stunning, Prince Edward Island ( where my in laws live) is 3-4 hours over an amazing brdge that no one knows about - Summer is  shorter than Mass. and winters are colder.( I used to live in Gloucester for 6 years) Taxes are  high in Canada, and I always get a shock when buying things- depending on the province sales taxes can be betw 12 and 17.5 percent. Clothing is not taxed. Food I found considerably more expensive. So much is imported- A bag of oranges that would be 2.99 here is 7 or even 9 dollars. Meats and Chicken can be almost twice let's say Costco prices. Gas here is around 2.05 now, in Canada it's still 5 and up ( mostly taxes).<br>  this is silly but I noticed that Halifax has really good yard sales. I love yard sales, and when it warms up a bit it perhaps after the winter, it just seems that everyone sets up tables and visits from house to house. <br>  Sorry I have no info on jobs- but it would be worth visitng the C. Consulate- they offer lots of info. If you want to go to Alberta there are amazing job opportunities out there- in December it can be 40 below. <br>  good luck.|`|7vBeWSgsaa	I'm Canadian, but can tell you that Halifax is a beautiful place. It'll be slow compared to Boston, but the people are wonderful. Halifax and Boston are also known as port cities, which gives them some similarities. The market in Halifax is actually alot more stable than many other parts of Canada-not so jumpy like some areas out west. Halifax is also one of Canada's most polite cities, which makes it a nice place to live. If it works for you, I would give Halifax the highest of recomendations.
