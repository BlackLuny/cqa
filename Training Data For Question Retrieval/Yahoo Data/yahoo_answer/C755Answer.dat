Se você n?o gosta de você do jeito que você é, quem vai gostar? se arrume, passe uma bela maquiagem.. arrume seu cabelo, se olhe no espelho e fala: que mulher linda está aqui..! você tem que se auto valorizar, e n?o ficar chorando pelos cantoss.. vamoss, VOCê é UMA MULHER OU UM SACO DE BATATAS? vá a academia, conhe?a gente nova, conhe?a novos lugares, compre roupas novas que deixem seu corpo bonito.. se goste mais.. assim você vai ter for?a de vontade para quando chegar ao final vc parar e pensar: eu n?o sou uma fracassada.. eu sou uma vencedora!|`|mf3QMsfvaa	N?o existe outra coisa. Só for?a de vontade. E vc consegue, se quiser! Todo mundo consegue tudo o que realmente quer! Eu estou conseguindo perder peso, com dieta e exercícios. Consulte um nutricionista é a melhor coisa.

Quando vc come?ar a perder os primeiros quilos o resto vem naturalmente, pois vc se acostuma, é uma quest?o de hábito. é ótimo fazer dieta, se exercitar... vc fica disposto, se sente saudável, é maravilhoso. Só n?o vale achar que vai conseguir tudo no primeiro mês. Consulte um nutricionista que vale a pena. Comece amanh? mesmo e for?a que vc consegue!!!!|`|nBl6oyqxaa	vc deve ser emo, n?o gosto de emos, mas vou supor q vc n?o é e vou responder, vc precisa ter for?a d vontade pra n?o comer, mas tb precisa saber q n?o é t?o simples, ent?o tente assim, estipule uma quantia q vc pode comer(n?o estipule uma quantia mt baixa), e pense assim, eu POSSO  comer esta quantia, ent?o vc se livrará dos seus "complexos", q ja esta mt bom pro come?o, ent?o se vc toma café da manh?, com o tempo diminua a quantia de comida dessa refei??o até conseuir trocar ela por 3 ou 4 copos de agua(isso ajuda a emagrecer), ao meio-dia fa?a sua primeira refei??o do dia(n?o exagere) as 3 horas fa?a um lanche(bem pekeno), e a noite jante(mas n?o exagere), se vc conseguir, tente eliminar a janta, mesmo q demore bastante tempo, e siga assim, com o tempo vc vai se acostumando e consegue diminuir as refei??es, ah, procure fazer bastante exercicios.|`|Cvg2q34aaa	Pede a DEUS for?a p/ vc superar isso...|`|2Y4jz7efaa	Excelente dica em poucas palavras (resolve): vá aos Vigilantes do Peso. O programa alimentar deles funciona.<br>  abs!|`|4EWfPf3raa	Acho que vc está tentando emagrecer da maneira errada. Vc n?o vai perder peso parando de comer um dia para, no dia seguinte, comer compulsivamente. Isso só vai fazer vc se sentir mais culpada e comer mais. Vc deveria procurar um nutricionista ou outro especialista para fazer uma dieta adequada pra vc e que n?o te fa?a passar fome. Pelo que eu ou?o dizer, o segredo para uma boa dieta, n?o é se privar de alimentos, mas comer um pouco de tudo moderadamente. Dizem até que o melhor é alimentar-se a cada três horas com alimentos mais leves, pois isso acelera o seu metabolismo e ajuda a emagrecer, já que o seu corpo vai trabalhar o dia inteiro. Se vc tiver fome, coma. Mas escolha alimentos leves e nutritivos. O melhor seria vc nem ter alimentos muito calóricos em casa para n?o ceder à tenta??o. Outra atitude que vc deve ter é praticar exercícios para ajudar a emagrecer. Pode ser até uma caminhada por dia ou, quem sabe, entrar para uma academia. Ent?o, esse é o segredo n?o apenas para emagrecer, mas para levar uma vida mais saudável: uma dieta balanceada e nutritiva e exercícios. Espero que vc consiga. Bjos...

GOD gives us the choice to live our lives as we want.. and, most will not follow HIM.. simply because the power of sin has to be unleashed..and what you describe is an example of it..If you want to talk about stimulating the economy, well, these industries will always be around in a sinful world. Abundant, I do not think so, but sin will always be available to those who want it and revolve their lives around it.. To grow the economy right now, well, being in the Green power industry is a good place to be.. solar panels, wind mills, and any industry supporting these will flourish in the next 10 years.. if the auto industry snaps around fast enough, like FORD has, then there will be new suppliers for their new products..

Heat the oil over medium heat. Meanwhile, prepare your pieces of dough. Break off pieces of dough the size of the palm of your hand. Flatten each piece with your hands until it is 1/2 to 1 inch thick. With a fork, prick the top of each piece of dough all over.<br>  When the oil is very hot, but not smoking, begin to fry the dough. Cook as many pieces as you can fit in the skillet at the same time. When the pieces become light brown on one side, turn them. When the other side is also light brown, transfer the fried dough to a paper towel to drain.

BWxSSADaaa	I really admire that you want to do this, it's so nice!<br>  <br>  First of all, if he is in a place where he has access to Arabic foods, then it may be better to go with something from your culture that you can make really well.  You didn't mention where he lives, so if he lives in his home country, there's a good chance that he gets Arabic sweets whenever he wants them.<br>  <br>  If he's living away from home, I think it's a great idea to make him something he'd be familiar with, it would make him feel good.  That said, most of the Arabic sweets I've had do not travel well.  They have been covered in a sugar syrup and so I think they'd get soggy.  The one sweet I've tried that would probably ship well is mamoul.  It's a cookie that's filled with dates or nuts (walnuts or pistachios).<br>  <br>  I personally don't have a recipe, I tried some a Lebanese friend gave me and they were tasty, with dates inside.

Shred the beef and serve on rolls with some of the juice from the pot. You may want to skim some of the fat off, depending on how fatty your roast was.<br>  (My roast was small. If you use a bigger one, you may want to increase the amount of liquid. You want the liquid to nearly cover the roast.)<br>  <br>  Ingredients:<br>  1 pot roast, lean chuck, bottom round, or rump, about 3 to 4 pounds<br>  3 tablespoons all-purpose flour<br>  1 teaspoon salt<br>  1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper<br>  3 tablespoons olive oil<br>  1 medium onion, halved, thinly sliced<br>  1 rib celery, thinly sliced<br>  8 ounces whole small button mushrooms, trimmed, washed, or sliced mushrooms<br>  4 cloves garlic, smashed and minced<br>  1/2 teaspoon dried marjoram or thyme<br>  1 small bay leaf<br>  1 cup chicken broth<br>  1 cup dry red wine, such as pinot noir/burgundy or cabernet<br>  1 can (28 ounces) crushed tomatoes<br>  Preparation:<br>  In a large pot or Dutch oven, heat olive oil over high heat.

Cocínela hasta que el agua llegue a ebullición (de 5 a 10 minutos) y cuando este lista, retírela del agua y escúrrala en una coladera. <br>  <br>  Por otro lado, ponga el ajo y la cebolla picados, el jitomate sin semilla, los champi?ones, el albahaca y el chile de árbol en un sartén caliente engrasado con un poco de mantequilla y déjelos cociendo unos minutos para después agréguele el pure de tomate y la pasta. <br>  <br>  Cuando la pasta este lista, viértala en un refractario, encima espárzale el queso panela y parmesano rallados e introdúzcalo en el horno de gas hasta que el queso se empiece a dorar. Es muy importante que observe constantemente la pasta para que no se queme. <br>  También puede cocinar la pasta en un horno de microondas calentándola por 2-3 minutos aproximadamente. <br>  <br>  Cuando el platillo este listo, saque el refractario del horno y déjelo enfriar. Para acompa?ar la pasta puede utilizar un poco de crema baja en grasa y una rica ensalada de lechugas mixtas. <br>  <br>  Pasta fría con mayonesa de cilantro<br>  <br>  Ingredientes:<br>  - 3 tazas de pasta corta cocida. <br>  - 4 pechugas de pollo, sin piel y sin hueso. <br>  - 1 cabeza de ajo. <br>  - 2 cucharadas de aceite de oliva. <br>  - 2 ramas de tomillo. <br>  - ? taza de hojas de cilantro. <br>  - ? taza de mayonesa. <br>  - ? taza de vinagre. <br>  - ? taza de aceite de oliva. <br>  - 1 pizca de páprika. <br>  - 1 pizca de pimienta negra. <br>  - Verduras mixtas hervidas cortada en cuadros peque?os. <br>  Preparación:<br>  Primero, coloque la pasta en una olla con agua hirviendo y déjela cocinando hasta que ésta se ablande (aproximadamente 10 minutos). Para darle un poco más de sabor le puede agregar una pizca de sal. <br>  <br>  Por otro lado, coloque la cabeza de ajo sobre un trozo de plástico adherible, córtele la parte superior y viértale encima un poco de aceite de oliva y una pizca de tomillo. Envuélvalo e introdúzcalo en el horno para rostizarlo: si es de gas por 10 minutos, pero si utiliza el horno de microondas por 3-5 minutos. <br>  <br>  * Si utiliza el horno de gas es mejor que envuelva el ajo en papel aluminio. <br>  <br>  Para la salsa, coloque en la licuadora el aceite de oliva, el vinagre y las hojas de cilantro. Licue bien hasta obtener una salsa ligeramente espesa. Después, viértala en un recipiente limpio y agréguele la mayonesa y el ajo; sáquelo del plástico o papal aluminio y exprímalo. <br>  Revuelva bien la salsa para que todos los ingredientes se integren perfectamente. <br>  <br>  En cuanto a las pechugas, úntelas por los dos lados con un poco de aceite de oliva y espárzales una pizca de pimienta negra y páprika. Colóquelas en una charola e introdúzcalas en el horno a 180° C por aproximadamente 10-15 minutos. <br>  <br>  Por último, coloque la pasta en un plato extendido, viértale encima la salsa y coloque al un lado o alrededor el pollo cortado en tiras delgadas. Para complementar agregue un poco de verduras mixtas (zanahoria, brócoli, calabaza, etc.) y esparza sobre la pasta un poco de queso parmesano. <br>  <br>  Ensalada de pollo con pasta<br>  <br>  Ingredientes:<br>  - 2 tazas de pasta corta cocida (fusilli o ‘tornillo’).<br>  - 4 cucharadas de mayonesa baja en grasa.<br>  - ? pieza de tofú (opcional).<br>  - 4 cucharadas de aceite de oliva.<br>  - ? taza de hojas de albahaca.<br>  - 1 diente de ajo.<br>  - 2 pechugas de pollo aplanadas.<br>  - 4 cucharadas de queso parmesano rallado.<br>  - 2 tazas de lechugas mixtas.<br>  - Ajonjolí.<br>  Preparación:<br>  Primero, coloque la pasta y unas cuantas hojas de laurel en una olla con agua caliente y déjela cocinando por aproximadamente 10-15 minutos. Retire la pasta y escúrrala.<br>  <br>  Para la salsa, coloque en una licuadora las hojas de albahaca (los tallos no), la mayonesa, el queso parmesano, el tofú, un poco de ajo y como medio liquido el de aceite de oliva.

After that, remove the pan from the heat and allow everything to cool.

Anyway, here is a list of topping that you could put on your pizza.  <br>  <br>  *Sausage - when I make my pizza I like to buy sausage from the store and fry it in the frying pan.  The kind of sausage you may want to purchase would be either Jimmy Dean, or Bob Evans. <br>  <br>  *Mushrooms - you can purcahse mushrooms that are fresh in your groceries vegetable section or you can buy canned mushrooms.  But if you are going to wash them, don't wash them all at once, because they will mold quicker.  <br>  <br>  *Green peppers - I like the taste of green peppers, just make sure they are fresh. <br>  <br>  *Onions - this is used for more flavor and crunchiness. <br>  <br>  *Pepperoni - a superme pizza isn't complete without peperonni. <br>  <br>  *Bacon - sometimes adding bacon can give extra flavor. <br>  <br>  *BBQ chicken - I've actually seen this kind of topping added to supreme pizza.  I think it would be something new to try. <br>  <br>  *Olives - I don't particularly like them, but give them a try. |`|ylJoUuMDaa	I like bacon, pepperoni, ham, olives, onions, double mozzarella cheese and, get this, cooked macaroni.

Burro<br>  3 Cucchiai Formaggio Parmigiano Grattugiato<br>  1 Uovo<br>  Noce Moscata<br>  Pangrattato<br>  Sale<br>  <br>  PREPARAZIONE<br>  <br>  Cuocere in forno la zucca. Passarla al setaccio e metterla in una ciotola. Unire l'uovo, il parmigiano, sale e noce moscata. Amalgamare l'impasto. Con la farina e le uova preparare una sfoglia. Una volta asciutta tagliare delle strisce larghe 8-9 cm, quindi tagliare le strisce in quadrati. Al centro di ogni quadrato porre una noce di ripieno, ripiegare la pasta formando un tortello e schiacciare i bordi facendoli aderire.

Nella Cucurbita maxima il frutto, la zucca per eccellenza, ha una forma voluminosa ed appiattita all'apice ed è caratterizzata da una spessa buccia verde solcata da striature longitudinali. Di grandi dimensioni (può pesare anche 80 Kg), la Cucurbita maxima presenta una polpa di colore giallo-arancio farinosa e dolciastra. La Cucurbita moschata è di forma allungata, cilindrica e ringonfia all'estremità. Di medie diemsioni, è di colore verde scuro o arancione ed ha polpa dolce e tenera. Le varietà di zucche più coltivate in Italia sono la Marina di Chioggia, molto diffusa nel Nord, e la Lunga di Napoli, coltivata soprattutto nelle regioni meridionali. >> indice   <br>  Al momento dell'acquisto è importante che il prodotto sia fresco, ben maturo e sodo. Una zucca ha queste caratteristiche se, dandogli dei leggeri colpetti, emette un suono sordo. Il picciolo, inoltre, deve essere morbido e ben ancorato alla zucca. La buccia deve essere pulita e non deve presentare ammaccature. <br>  Date le dimensioni e il peso, nella maggior parte dei casi la zucca si acquista tagliata a tranci,.io nei supermercati la trovo ma mio zio xfortuna ha un orto!- tenendo presente che buccia e semi rappresentano uno scarto del 30-35%. Se si compra una zucca a pezzi, bisogna fare attenzione che la parte tagliata ed esposta all'aria non sia asciutta, che il frutto sia ben maturo e sodo, senza punti cedevoli e che i semi siano umidi e scivolosi.<br>  La cucurbita maxima è la varietà più versatile in cucina, quella che si presta al maggior numero di preparazioni.<br>  Le zucche lunghe, invece, sono più adatte per essere usate nei minestroni insieme ad altre verdure.<br>  Le zucche intere possono essere conservate per tutto il periodo invernale in ambiente buio, fresco e asciutto. La tradizione vuole che si mangino entro carnevale.<br>  I pezzi di zucca cruda si conservano in frigorifero, nel reparto delle verdure, avvolte dentro la pellicola trasparente, e vanno consumate nel giro di pochi giorni, poiché si disidratano con facilità. <br>  Tolta la buccia e tagliata a dadini, eventualmente scottati per qualche minuto in acqua bollente, può essere anche congelata<br>  Credo che quella lunga abbia+polpa quindi si presti meglio per i cappellacci!

MNqwUHypaa	it is good to have boring things at home. my sister the nurse told me that years ago and i have found it to be true. obviously, meals are not  the focus of your life that way. fancy schamzy roast leg of lamb and hot fudge cake and such are exactly what you need steer clear of. make other activities your focus, not food. i lost the most weight by emptying the fridge and stocking up on relatively bland and repetetive food from oatmeal to moderate portions of fresh (frozen) salmon and green peas and other fresh veggies. KISS, keep it simple, stupid. Keep it bland and that means your world does not revolve around food and drink. Work, workout, study, read, etc. Lose weight and search for helpful, healthful activities. <br>  <br>  Avoid appetite stimulants like fancy sauces and salts and rubs etc. are a bad thing. Bland is good. Since there is nothing the matter with you appetitie, quite the opposite, DO NOT make it harder to stay on your plan. You can make a pact with yourself to eat fancy foods on a few holidays and a few very special occasions. Fancy food is highly addictive.<br>  <br>  If your old diet isn't working, drop it. Study up on calories and fat grams etc. All fad diets work for a while, but they all fail in the end.|`|a4661a0c616a32ff5dd3a5301254d3d5aa	Garlic Chicken with Orzo Noodles <br>  Ingredients:<br>  1 cup uncooked orzo pasta<br>  2 tablespoons olive oil<br>  2 cloves garlic<br>  1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper<br>  2 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - cut into bite-size pieces<br>  salt to taste<br>  1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley<br>  2 cups fresh spinach leaves<br>  grated Parmesan cheese for topping <br>  <br>  Directions:<br>  1.

Then you can vary the vegetables and the seasonings and have black bean sauce, red or green thai curry, spicy or not spicy chinese.  <br>  <br>  My secret to good turkey burgers is to mix the ground turkey with a fair amount of good salsa.  It keeps the burgers moist and adds flavor to the meat which otherwise can be a bit bland.  Eat the burger on a bed of salad if you're dieting.  You can add some slices of orange, thin slices of celery, and make a ginger & garlic or peanut sauce dressing to jazz it up.  Delicious!<br>  <br>  Also you can make kabobs, marinating the chicken in a mixture of plain yogurt and curry or an olive oil, lemon and garlic dressing.  Thread skewers (soak wooden ones first so they don't burn) with the chicken or turkey and vegetables or cook the vegetables separately.  Serve with a nice rice pilaf (I add shredded lettuce and vegetables to the pilaf).  <br>  <br>  Try searching Epicurious.com for recipes with chicken or turkey.  <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|2Ek0DM3Baa	try a marinade - I think McCormick is the brand I use.  There is a chipotle marinade that comes in a packet.  All you do is add oil and water (1/4 cup of each, so it's not a ton of oil).  I use a grill pan to cook them.  I usually throw them into soft tacos or salad.  Tonight I am going to make chipotle chicken Caesar salad wraps.  It's got a little heat, but pairing with the lettuce cools it down, and the flavor is great.  They make other marinades too, but I haven't tried them.|`|OSJg4GXkaa	Cooking chicken with mushroom sauce is so good. My mom actually just use the canned mushroom soup to make it.

'08) by choosing a healthy lifestyle way of eating (not a short term diet; its for life).  Don't count calories; just portion control.  Use a small plate and a small bowl. Vary the spices in foods helps a lot with boredom.  Reward yourself for the little milestone that you achieved.  There is the volumetrics way, where you can eat more of nutrious foods high in fiber to fill you up so you don't fill hungry.  Have vegetarian meals a couple times a week really helps with controlling the fat intake.<br>  <br>  I listed Ways to a healthy lifestyle way of eating that helped me:<br>  <br>  Nutritious foods that are high in nutrients and low in fat and sugar (no sugar, if possible). <br>  <br>  Substituting sugar and oil (partially, depends on the recipe) by using applesauce and pureed fruits in baked goods.<br>  <br>  Eating veggies as the main dish and lean meats (including beans), fish and chicken (very little red meat) as a side dish.<br>  <br>  Eating whole wheat rice, pasta and breads is good as a side dish or as part of the main dish, as long as it is not high in fat, but is high in fiber. Lots of times, breads and pasta will say its wheat when it isn't whole wheat; something to watch out for.<br>  <br>  Eating 3 meals plus 2 snacks a day is good.<br>  <br>  Staying away from fast foods and tv dinners laden with fat and sugar.<br>  <br>  Key is finding what kinds of foods you like; going to the American Heart Association website as a guideline.<br>  <br>  Then looking at recipes that appeal to you.<br>  <br>  I made a binder, with plastic sheet pocket protector page with index pages (salads, meats, side dishes, desserts, etc.).  I’d try the recipe, if it’s good, it stays, if not, its tossed.<br>  ----<br>  I like pizza, that is my weakness.  Can make your own and add veggies and grilled chicken with a little parmesan cheese.<br>  ----<br>  By not feeling deprived when modifying your diet, a person stands a better change at eating healthier is the long run.  If you have been good for a while, an occaisonal one scoop of ice cream in a small cup is OK.  Just remember, to keep with it and it is not temporary; its for life.<br>  ---<br>  Can take most recipes and modify it so it is less in fat and more nutritious.  Add veggies to extend the fiber and less emphasis on the meat.

It's not technically ravioli (those Italians are particular when it comes to their pasta), but I'm sure you could make as a ravioli dish. <br>  <br>  It's a very autumn-type recipe, with butternut squash, Parmesan (the real stuff), breadcrumbs, and nutmeg.

c5d064177f8f2df0395649c201d9ed69aa	Various species of Passiflora, climbing vines native to the South American tropics and rainforest, have been domesticated to eat as fresh fruit or to make refreshing and nutritive juices. In the Brazil Amazon alone, over 200 species of fruit-bearing Passiflora have been cataloged. Yellow passionfruit, (Passiflora edulis) is the most widely cultivated species in the warm humid tropics, and its yellow gelatinous pulp is mixed with water and sugar to make drinks, sherbet, ice cream, jam, jellies and salad dressings. Yellow passionfruit grows on 10 to 20 foot long vines and are the size of large lemons, wrinkling slightly when ripe.<br>  Photos:  <a href="http://www.rain-tree.com/Plant-Images/passionflower-pic.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.rain-tree.com/Plant-Images/pa...</a>|`|0SUvroaAaa	I don't know but I know there's a book by that title that's about being lesbian.|`|3fb28fea18240dc8cd59135a0d25a3d8aa	It's hard to describe.

The problem with alcohol is that it gets converted directly to fat because it contains nothing of value to the human body hence the commonly referred, "empty calories" of alcohol.<br>  <br>  If you are dieting avoid alcohol, but if you really can't go without it then the only way to avoid it is to lower the percentage of alcohol (single instead of double shot.)<br>  <br>  Cosmopolitan, Appletini, and Lemon Drops are decent though.|`|ozcm5WGfaa	I suggest you take a look at some of these low cal drinks at Liquor Live:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.liquorlive.com/drinks.php?option=com_listdrinks&drink=Low+Cal" rel="nofollow">http://www.liquorlive.com/drinks.php?opt...</a><br>  <br>  I am sure you should find something that you will like.

53giV6PFaa	I have never had it, but here are two recipes for different flavors of Maryann cakes:<br>  <br>  Maryann Cake with Lemon Curd and Blueberries<br>  <br>  Made from lemon juice, sugar, butter and egg yolks, lemon curd is a rich, creamy mixture that is traditionally served with scones and is also used to fill pastries. Here, it becomes a delicious base for fresh blueberries atop our Mary Ann cake. You can use prepared lemon curd or make it from scratch (see related recipes at right).<br>       <br>  Ingredients:<br>  <br>  2 cups all-purpose flour<br>  2 tsp. baking powder<br>  1 tsp. salt<br>  16 Tbs. (2 sticks) unsalted butter, at room temperature<br>  1 1/2 cups granulated sugar<br>  4 eggs<br>  2 tsp. vanilla extract<br>  1 cup milk<br>  2 cups lemon curd<br>  1 1/2 cups blueberries<br>  Confectioners sugar for dusting (optional)<br>  <br>  Directions<br>  <br>  Preheat an oven to 350°F. Grease and flour a Mary Ann cake pan.<br>  <br>  Over a sheet of waxed paper, sift together the flour, baking powder and salt. Set aside.<br>  <br>  In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the flat beater, beat the butter on medium speed until smooth and creamy, 1 to 2 minutes. Reduce the speed to low and gradually add the granulated sugar, beating until blended. Increase the speed to medium-high and continue beating until the mixture is light and fluffy, 3 to 5 minutes, stopping the mixer occasionally to scrape down the sides of the bowl. Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition and stopping the mixer occasionally to scrape down the sides of the bowl. Beat in the vanilla.<br>  <br>  Reduce the speed to low and add the flour mixture in three additions, alternating with the milk and beginning and ending with the flour, beating just until blended and no lumps of flour remain.<br>  <br>  Pour the batter into the prepared pan and bake until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean, about 40 minutes. Transfer the pan to a wire rack and let cool for 15 minutes. Carefully turn the cake out onto the rack and let cool completely, at least 1 hour.<br>  <br>  Just before serving, spoon the lemon curd into the well of the cake, spreading it to the edges. Arrange the blueberries on top of the curd. Dust the cake with confectioners sugar. Serves 12 to 16.<br>  ======================================...<br>  <br>  Chocolate Almond Maryann Cake<br>  <br>      *   For the cake: 3/4 cup cocoa powder, plus more for dusting<br>      * 2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour<br>      * 1 1/2 teaspoons salt<br>      * 1 3/4 teaspoons baking soda<br>      * 2 1/4 cups sugar<br>      * 2 cups boiling water<br>      * 12 tablespoons (1 1/2 sticks) unsalted butter, melted<br>      * 3 eggs<br>      * 2 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract<br>      * 1 cup semisweet chocolate chips<br>      * For the ganache: 3 ounces semisweet chocolate, finely chopped<br>      * 1/3 cup heavy cream<br>      * 3/4 cup sliced almonds, lightly toasted<br>  <br>  Preparation<br>  <br>  Position a rack in the lower third of an oven and preheat to 350°F. Grease a Mary Ann cake pan (available at "Williams Sonoma" stores) and dust with cocoa powder.<br>  <br>  To make the cake, over a sheet of waxed paper, sift together the flour, salt and baking soda. Set aside.<br>  <br>  In a large bowl, whisk together the 3/4 cup cocoa, the sugar and boiling water. Set aside.<br>  <br>  In a small bowl, whisk together the butter, eggs and vanilla. Pour into the cocoa mixture and whisk to combine. Whisk in the flour mixture in two additions. Pour the batter through a fine-mesh sieve into the prepared pan and stir in the chocolate chips.<br>  <br>  Bake until the cake springs back when gently touched and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 45 minutes. Transfer the pan to a wire rack and let cool for 15 minutes. Tap the pan gently on a work surface, invert the pan onto the rack and lift off the pan. Let cool completely, about 1 hour.<br>  <br>  To make the ganache, put the chocolate in a small bowl. In a small saucepan over medium heat, warm the cream until bubbles form around the edges of the pan. Pour the cream over the chocolate. Let stand for 1 minute, then slowly whisk until smooth. Let cool for 10 minutes before using.<br>  <br>  Pour the ganache into the well of the cake. Using an offset spatula, spread evenly. Sprinkle the almonds in a 1-inch-wide band around the outside edge of the ganache. Refrigerate the cake for at least 30 minutes to set the ganache.|`|KT0UTX8taa	CHOCOLATE VELVET PIE (From Maryanne)  <br>  <br>  1 9" unbaked single pie shell<br>  2 (1 oz.) sq. unsweetened chocolate<br>  1 (14 oz.) can sweetened condensed milk<br>  2 eggs, well beaten<br>  1 c. water<br>  2 tsp. vanilla<br>  Whipped cream<br>  <br>  Bake crust in 400 degree oven for 15 minutes.

TxxAPbZQaa	allur da dove cominciamo<br>  Mirepoix è il nome francese per un misto di cipolle, carote e sedano tagliati a piccoli cubetti. Questa preparazione è stata creata dal cuoco personale del Duca di Lévis-Mirepoix, attorno al XVII secolo.<br>  <br>  Il mirepoix può essere crudo, arrostito o saltato con il burro ed è la base di numerosi piatti come brodo, zuppe, spezzatini e salse. Secondo la cucina francese ne esistono due versioni, au maigre fatta con sole verdure e usata per preparazioni con crostacei / pesci, e au gras con aggiunta di pancetta o prosciutto crudo.|`|4sMTxqOZaa	Mirepoix è il nome francese per un misto di cipolle, carote e sedano tagliati a piccoli cubetti|`|M5yeel4jaa	GUSCI DI LUMACA TRITATI E ADAGIATI SU LARVE DI LUMACA BOLLITE ,IL TUTTO CONDITO CON UN PO DI BAVA ....|`|JNHaJDEoaa	Mirepoix è un termine francese che sta ad indicare un battuto di verdure (sedano carota e cipolla) che si usa soprattutto per i soffritti<br>  <br>  Si distingue in Mirepoix magro (che è quello che ti ho appena descritto)<br>  e Mirepoix grasso (dove si aggiunge lardo, o guanciale o pancetta o altro tipo di grasso)..<br>  <br>  Scusa se ci ho messo un secondo di più ma ti stavo appunto rispondendo.<br>  <br>  Saluti!|`|Wvzk9rSTaa	Si definisce mirepoix l' insieme di due o più bùverdure tagliate insieme, non necessariamente a cubetti: di solito il taglio di una mirepoix è grossolano, se invece si vuole fare a cubetti prende un altro nome, quello cioè di brunoise, che tre diverse grandezze: piccola, media, grande. Se trovi quindi su un menù "zuppa con mirepoix di verdura" mangerai un minestrone, se trovi "crostino con brunoise di zucchine" mangerai una brischetta con zucchine a dadi.

vvoz2jeyaa	you should probably toss it out and buy some more. wheat flour has natural oils in it which turn rancid or bad after a time. whole wheat turns rancid much faster than white because it has more oils in it. next time if you dont use a lot of flour buy a smaller amount and store it in your freezer. I do alot of baking and buy 25 pound sacks at a time 'cause its so much cheaper and I freeze what i dont need on the pantry, then pull it out when i need more.

95338b015043271c6167082a68ef5e88aa	I think she's referring to a depth charge drink that is commonly referred to as a bomb.     A bomb (as in Irish Car Bomb or Jager Bomb) is a shot that is dropped into a drink.     Irish Car Bomb is a shot of equal parts Irish Cream and Irish Whiskey dropped into half a pint of Guinness and quickly consumed. This is a variation of a boilermaker (shot + beer).    A Jager Bomb is a shot of Jagermeister dropped into a glass half filled with Red Bull, also quickly consumed.     Another popular depth charge drink is the Flaming Dr. Pepper. A shot of 3/4 Amaretto liqueur and 1/4 high-proof liquor is set on fire then immediately dropped into a beer and consumed. It is said to taste similar to a Dr. Pepper.     They are fun but not for the faint of heart because they require some quick drinking; pausing while downing the depth charge will result in nasty-tasting beverage.|`|XWRxRWVkaa	shot>bomb|`|AA10766729	A shot is just that...a single shot (1 ounce typically) of a straight alcohol -- tequilla, whiskey, vodka, etc -- consumed in one gulp.

Examples would be:  - Sake Bomber:  Shot of sake dropped into a tankard of Kirin or Sapporo beer.  - Boiler Maker: Shot of whiskey dropped into a tankard of ale.|`|5mIhU9KAaa	a shot is just a shot of liquor straight. a bomb is usually a beer in a mug and then you put a shot into that and drink it. for example an Irish Car Bomb is a Guiness Beer in a mug and then you put a shot of Baileys iris cream in it and you drink the whole thing at once. i've done it before it's brutal

bZud91iuaa	Here's a recipe that I use with pesto on flank steak    roll out steak and pound lightly to break tissue and enlarge the meat.   salt & pepper the meat  spread a layer of pesto on the meat, then put a layer of fresh spinach over entire piece of meat  next, put some thinly sliced mushrooms on top of the spinach  slice thinly, Greek houlemme cheese and place the slices on top of the mushrooms.  From the larger end start rolloing the meat up, hold the roll with a toothpick.    Get out your chef's twine and tie off flank roll to hold it together.    The houlemme cheese will not melt out of the flank steak.  It is a cheese you can bake, fry and BBQ.  Brown all sides and the roast it off at 350.  Let meat rest then slice on the bias and serve.   You can also use olive tepanade in place of the pesto with the same ingredients.|`|nDxfUHFLaa	I see the local grocery store make stuffed flank steak two ways,  One is to take the steak lay it out flat and cover first with Spinach and then with Portabello mushrooms. roll up long side first and then slice into 1 inch rolls. Keep the shape with a toothpick. Bake in a 300 degree oven for 20 mins.. Delic.  The 2nd way was to stuff with Crabmeat. and then again cut into wheels and bake for 20 mins. The problem you may have using cream cheese is that it would melt during cooking. I think the pesto would be wonderful. and breadcrumbs would hold it together. If you pre cut(before bakaing) into rolls then anything that may ooze out would stay under the circle as it bakes.. If you are going to use some cheese combo I would suggest emmanthelar chopped up in small pieces and mixed with the pesto. That cheese is the topping for French Onion soup so it gets a stringy consistency when cooked.
95338b015043271c6167082a68ef5e88aa	Fermentation in winemaking is the process of converting the sugars in grape juice into alcohol.     Yeast, a micro-organism that is technically classified as a fungus, converts the sugars in the grapes into ethanol (or ethyl-alcohol) and carbon dioxide. Temperature and oxygen levels must be carefully controlled to begin and maintain the fermentation process.     And that's pretty much it as for the short and simple explanation. Of course I could go on and on about the chemical and biological processes in fermentation but that's the gist of it.     Wine fermentation is slightly different than beer fermentation and much different than food fermentation.|`|bZud91iuaa	Go with the first answer.  It's direct to the point and correct>|`|cJPOs7Tsaa	The yeast first consume nutrients and oxygen in order to reproduce. When the oxygen is depleted, the yeast begins to metabolize sugars (anaerobic fermentation), with alcohol and carbon dioxide as waste products.
5bYpbodUaa	Chicken broth and beef...(do not go together at all).    What I would do is sautee them until they are almost brown in some olive oil (EVOO: extra virgin olive oil), and put some Bell Peppers, Red Onion (or sweet onion), Mushrooms, and sautee them until soften/carmelized and meet is done, and then put over some white rice. Flavor the meet up with some salt and pepper while cooking, and perhaps a little garlic salt (not too much).  This makes a great meal!  Have a side salad, or baked potato with it.  :-)    Hope this helps!|`|S2ChGxe6aa	I think that you are going to be better off making some type of kabab with them. If he doesn't like stews that is best. Try rubbing the meat w/ olive oil, and you favorite spices, then slid them on the skewers with some whole mushrooms, tomatoes or any veggies that you like. Next cook them under the broiler in you oven. Just a couple of mins 3-4 on each side. The meat is best used for stews, but if you do not cook it to long it will still be rather tender|`|2RWayH3Oaa	it would be wonderful to brown them , add mushrooms , garlic,  onions, and a splash of burgandy wine

The butter once mixed with the melted choc will give you a decadant 'milk chocolate' taste<br>  <br>  good luck<br>  <br>  x|`|vcgn6XZgaa	Melt 100g choc and spread over the biscuits (no vanilla!)|`|c1d20f25b6bdbfe6d14a5895dcda2c82aa	Firstly I would recommend butter instead of margarine for flavour and texture.  Add about 100 grams melted chocolate (dependant on cocoa solids content) to your dough or fold in the same amount of chocolate chunks.  Also soft dark brown sugar is useful for a more 'fudgey' taste!|`|M7Cdycxpaa	go onto this website and there are loads of recipes for different types of chocolate cookies <a href="http://www.bettycrocker.com/search/searchresults.aspx?terms=chocolate+cookies" rel="nofollow">http://www.bettycrocker.com/search/searc...</a><br>  its a great website<br>  cookies are really nice too yumm!!|`|DUq5wGnJaa	99g of chocolate, melt and spread over buscuit

bZud91iuaa	Henkels are good knives and that's what I use.  They hold an edge very well and have the ability to last a long time if cared for properly.    Choose knives that are well balanced for you, as that can really make a difference when you're using it all day.  Over the course of your career you can ask parents, family members to get you gift certificates for specific knives as you build for your chefs kit.  That's how I built my set.  Now I have too many and have a home kit and my professional kit.  Any upscale chefworks store, williams/sonoma and or your culinary institute will ahve sources for knives and other tools of the trade you'll want.  I always carry my own cheese grater, bar spoon,  small needlenose pliers for picking out fish bones, peeler, corer and garnish kit.    Good luck in your culinary field|`|PhPOLgHGaa	Henkles are good    my preference is Chicago Cutlery...i love my set and never had any issues with them. always sharp and always in good conditon.    but here is a link to check out for yourself...maybe of some use.    http://bestkitchenknives.wordpress.com/|`|KkZE2NDYaa	I like to cook and a good chef's knife is my most important tool. My opinion is that the brand is not important but the materials used in the blade and how the handle fits your hand are what counts. Some cutlery is overpriced  because you are paying for brand name "snob appeal". Pure stainless steel just doesn't seem to take an edge and high carbon steel takes more maintenance. I like the newer "high carbon stainless". Remember that stainless does not mean rust free, just that it is less prone to rust. Take care of good knives and they will last years.|`|xuowtZLqaa	I would get a Henkels knife. They are at culinary or restaurant supply stores. Worth every cent.|`|Hg3E5IIOaa	Global makes a good chef knife.  Also, check with your school.  Most culinary schools offer good knife sets at reasonable prices.  That's where I got mine from.|`|F08HDRvraa	Get online to a cutco knives website.  The knives are sold by direct sales like Avon, but are the best knives I've every had.  You'll drop about $100 for a chefs knife, but it is guaranteed for life and they will sharpen free of charge.  I have had Henkles and Wustoff, they are ok.  Also you might try to find Furi (rachel ray knives are this brand), they are also pretty good, but if you are actually interested in culinary arts, I would get the cutco.

b9uOax0aaa	I think that she will be making a horrible mistake.|`|2RzEaod9aa	1. I think a 14 year-old becoming a veggie is just grand, but since you're young and young gals typically suck at eating properly, you'll need to ensure you're not just consuming, say, lettuce and carrots.<br>  <br>  2. Pros are you feel better, and if you eat properly (aka, no junk food), then you'll notice clear skin as well. Vegans notice a change right away in their hair and skin, but if you ate properly as an omnivore, this won't be that big a change for you. You also feel good mentally knowing that you aren't eating the meat of creatures that suffered for no reason.<br>  The only cons to vegetarianism are mostly the idiots who think you want to hear their uneducated, idiotic opinion...kinda like the first answerer. You don't get "more options" just because you add meat. Technically, yes, but the only additional options ARE meat. It's not like being a vegetarian means you can't eat beans, grains, nuts, veggies, fruits, snacks, junk food, pre-made meals, etc.. It's not like, "Oh, well, if I cut out beef then I have to cut out all grains, too." <br>  <br>  3. Being a vegetarian, like being an omnivore or vegan, in and of itself doesn't magically make you healthy or unhealthy. A well-rounded diet of any type is what you need to make you healthy. Just stick to the basics: eat 5-6 small meals a day made of lean protein and natural carbs.|`|llkSmgLJaa	I became a vegetarian at 12, and I'm 22 now.

I found it was hard at first cos i loved chicken. i wasnt bothered about giving up red meat though.

PxJXJKCpaa	Getting over the hump is hard when it's something you really don't want to do.  Go back slowly.  How about if you try more soy instead of eating meat?  Chocolate Silk is pretty darned good.  One serving has 5 grams of protein.  They sell soy bars as well.<br>  <br>  If you still feel the need to be a veg, start off slowly with chicken or fish.  Beef and pork could make you sick like it did me.  I was a veg for two years.  It took two weeks to get back to eating meat again.

You don't seem to know what "nutrition" is. Even if you eat meat, you still have to consume, yep, plants to get all your nutrition. You don't have to eat meat for nutrition, but you sure do have to eat plants. <br>  <br>  And why is it that people who say "I used to eat more for pleasure" always are referring to total processed and sh*t-laden fast food bullsh*t? That's not eating for pleasure, that's eating out of absolute laziness. If you REALLY ate for pleasure, you'd eat delicious, delectable, perfectly seasoned, artfully cooked food, not some goddamned burger from f*cking McDonald's. <br>  <br>  You say you can't even make a sandwich. Well, I'll tell you one thing, friend: if you are soooo lazy that you can't be bothered to eat a sandwich, you sure as hell aren't going to be getting proper nutrition, meat or no meat, because you're too damn lazy to give a sh*t about your body.<br>  <br>  So, even if you add meat, you're still going to feel like bloated, utter sh*t because that's what you're eating: bloated, utter sh*t from your cute little fast food chains.<br>  <br>  <br>  I'll tell you what, my dear. I work 3 jobs and am into bodybuilding. I'm a vegan. I make my food convenient. I bring it to work, I leave some in my car, and I assemble it at work and microwave it if it needs to be heated/cooked. <br>  <br>  But that's just the opinion of someone who's not disgustingly lazy, so what do I know?|`|doz7RIoeaa	Seems you have poor eating habits probably when you were omnivore AND now as a vegetarian.  <br>  <br>  Vegetarian does not mean you have starve or eat less, sacrificing nutrition, taste or calories etc. It just means you choose not to eat meat and/or slaughter by products. Add variety to your meals. Vary the taste and texture so that you don't get tired of "the same old thing". <br>  <br>  there are many websites that can help you plan meals.

XYR9sb5Eaa	At the age of 49, I've chosen not to drink at all - with a few exceptions - for the past 12 years.  The reasons are several - I've seen people destroy their lives with alcohol, it changes the behavior of people I love in a way that is actually scary to me, I want to set a good example for my daughter, and while it feels great the first hour it actually makes me kind of tired the next 24 hours and I don't sleep well. <br>  <br>  At your age I enjoyed drinking a lot - but looking back - I feel like it cost me a lot.  I didn't make good decisions, I think it made life more confusing for me, and if you drive it can affect your driving even if you think you aren't drunk the next morning, for example.  I didn't drive at all until I was 23 because I grew up in Manhattan, but if you or your friends are driving you after consuming alcohol, even if it's the next day, your judgment is impaired and it could literally cost you your life.  Even outside of driving - you can make such bad decisions - even with one drink (on an empty stomach especially) - that it can cost you your life or well being (accident of some type).  I am very lucky that I didn't have some disaster occur during this time as I  made some decisions that were so dangerous they could have killed me.<br>  <br>  I think it's possible to become addicted but it's also possible you wouldn't - I'm not really an expert on that and I think each person is different in terms of how likely they are to become addicted to something.  I never felt "addicted" to it, but looking back it seemed like I needed to do "something" to feel better that wasn't healthy - and I did wind up experimenting with drugs for a couple years as well.<br>  <br>  If someone was injured due to your being a little drunk - imagine how painful that would be to carry around your whole life.  Accidents can happen even if you don't drink at all - but they are more likely to happen if you drink.<br>  <br>  Yet, I know that when I was your age my social life was totally built around drinking with friends.  So I would say if it seems too hard to totally stop, simply drinking less would be a big improvement.  Then I would try to do activities where you are more likely to meet people who don't drink or do drugs, and in general try to see if you can make friends with people who don't.  If you go to college or move for a job, it's easier to do this when you are starting new.  If you get involved with a sport or some physical activity, it may help you realize how much drinking affects your stamina and ability to perform well.<br>  <br>  The friends I drank with heavily at your age are for the most part not doing that well as adults - and one died driving drunk.  I would say none of them are very successful or happy, yet I think it's possible to become those things despite it - many of them are still drinking and drugging.  I don't socialize with any of them and only talk on the phone to a couple once every year or two when they call to say hi.  One in particular saddens me because he is such a talented musician but his getting high has made it impossible for him to succeed in my opinion.<br>  <br>  But at the very least - don't drive after drinking or let others drive you when they've been drinking.  That is so dangerous and the pain accidents can cause can ruin your or someone else's life.  <br>  <br>  I admire your asking the question though - because I doubt 99% of kids drinking at your age would.  It shows you are thinking on a higher level already.  And if you are concerned about it, it may be your your inner wisdom trying to warn you to stop.|`|POJsTn3gaa	If you are asking the question, you probably realize the answer is yes.  I know I am an old fart telling you what to do, but I don't get worried that a kid experiments with drinking, it is when you move beyond the experiment stage that I think is a problem.

Are you drinking to look tough and cool or drinking after a hard days work and to relax. Are you drinking because your mates and want to join in. The secret to drinking is when you drink and it doesn't change your life because when it does then you are drinking to much. I know people who drink from the moment they wake up and it has seriously affected their lives.|`|10456fcb36c09d510c3f73faba95f075aa	Yes.

If my bread is not in the freezer it is in the fridge.<br>  <br>  The simplest way to do it is to just always eat your bread toasted. Either using a toaster, or a flat press. You may have to spend some time experimenting with your optimal toaster setting, but it is easily accomplished.<br>  <br>  The flat press is really good for making savoury sandwiches. Most savory flavours come out a bit better when food is warm.<br>  <br>  Just put your favorite fillings between two frozen slices of bread and put it in the flat press. In a short time, only a tad longer than using unfrozen bread will your toasted sandwich be ready.|`|Jf4TbMSPaa	When I buy bread it goes in the freezer as soon as I get it home. You can toast which doesnt require defrosting. I make sandwiches with the frozen bread and by lunch time it is back to its original softness. or just get it out and sit it on the bench for 10  minutes and it will be soft. Different foods can be frozen for longer than others.We use a loaf of bread for a week and our sandwiches are always fresh, you cant even tell the breads been frozen. If, however you were using bread that had been frozen for a month it wouldn't come back to its original freshness.|`|C4FgFmMUaa	Well, normally I'd freeze a whole loaf, and then defrost the whole loaf when I need it.  <br>  <br>  BUT my friend has an ingenious solution for the problem where you only want enough bread for a sandwich...she freezes the loaf, and then in the morning she takes out two slices of bread, and makes the sandwich with them when they are still frozen.  She takes the sandwich to work and leaves it out of the fridge, and by lunch time it has defrosted...it also keeps the sandwich filling from getting too warm!|`|HmWSssa7aa	Next time put the bread in the fridge.

0sHarzeZaa	All a Macchiato is is a shot of Espresso poured through a dollop of foam. So- yes, you will need an espresso machine. If you're talking about a macchiato more like Starbucks' caramel macchiato, that's just a vanilla latte with caramel on top. Either way, espresso machine. The best home Espresso machines - in my opinion- are made by Rancilio, but you're looking at $600 - $800 to buy one. Any Espresso machine will do the trick, but if you want to be able to make great foam, get one with a steam wand.

cxNLOPHNaa	All you need is a simple siphon and a supply of cartridges for it. They use CO2 cartridges to carbonate plain water (properly known as "Seltzer"), or any clear beverage such as your apple juice, which you can carbonate directly for a sparkling apple juice, similar to sparkling cider. Siphons were known as "Seltzer bottles" and were a household staple in the 20's-40's. You can also add syrups such as those made by Torani to the carbonated water to make your own sodas.    If you want to get into actually brewing your own soda/cider.. Homebrewers.com has all the supplies you need to get started. They are the last link.

1c74cc7ee9876780e94d288d920e0d0aaa	I don't find them weird, but I do get annoyed at the Veggies who claim to be such and go to Subway and eat the Tuna Sub, or eat meat occasionally.  That's their choice, but don't label yourself as a true veggie if that's what is going to happen.( Not you personally)|`|b9uOax0aaa	I do not find the vegetarians so weird.  I do not find them anywhere.  I do find many of their statements and questions here, totally ignorant.|`|2mlHf7Opaa	It's a niche lifestyle.  Society doesn't respond well to that.  Read up about it in a psychology or sociology book.|`|PxJXJKCpaa	It's like being racist.  If your not in the same boat, others will belittle you.  Who did you vote for?  Black or white?  Why are there so many different types of coke out there?  What do you drink?  Coke or Pepsi?  Do you worship God?  Do you do it the way I DO?<br>  <br>  People in the States need to join together in being ONE SOCIETY and quit putting other people down that don't do things the way everyone else does.<br>  <br>  It doesn't matter to me what you eat.  I'm not telling you what I eat, so who the h*** cares.|`|GgWrhISBaa	I don't!

53giV6PFaa	I  have made the brown sauce version of this recipe and it's very good, just like the chinese restaurant version.  There are several versions of this you can try.<br>  <br>  Basic Directions:<br>  <br>  The technique is the same for all three sauces:<br>  1) Cook any meat first. Remove it from the pan.<br>  2) Stir-fry your veggies.<br>  3) Mix up all the sauce ingredients in a measuring cup.<br>  4) Add a few pieces of hot veggies to the measuring cup to pre-heat the cornstarch.<br>  5) Dump all the sauce into the pan with the veggies (and add the meat back, if using) and bring to a boil.<br>  6) Simmer for a minute or two until the sauce is clear and thickened.<br>  <br>  Basic Chinese White Sauce<br>  <br>  In a measuring cup, combine:<br>  <br>      * 1/4 c. (or less) soy sauce, shoyu, or Bragg’s<br>      * 1/2 c. water<br>      * 1 Tbl. grated ginger<br>      * 1/2 tsp. chopped garlic (1 small clove)<br>      * 1 Tbl. cornstarch<br>  <br>  Follow the basic directions above.<br>  Basic Chinese Brown Sauce<br>  <br>  In a measuring cup, combine:<br>  <br>      * 1/4 c. (or less) soy sauce, shoyu, or Bragg’s<br>      * 1/2 c. water<br>      * 0.5 - 1 Tbl. grated ginger<br>      * 1 tsp. chopped garlic (1 clove)<br>      * 1 Tbl. cornstarch<br>      * 1 Tbl. molasses<br>  <br>  Follow the basic directions above.<br>  <br>  Spicy Orange Glaze<br>  <br>  In a measuring cup, combine:<br>  <br>      * 1/4 c. (or less) soy sauce, shoyu, or Bragg’s<br>      * 1/4 c. water<br>      * 1 tsp grated ginger<br>      * 1-2 tsp. chopped garlic (1-2 cloves)<br>      * 1 Tbl. cornstarch<br>      * 1 Tbl. orange juice concentrate<br>      * 1/4 tsp. cayenne pepper (more to taste)<br>  <br>  Follow the basic directions above. This sauce should be much thicker than the others; it’s great on chicken and tofu.|`|BaNrweQ4aa	there are so many good sauces on here; it just depends how long you want to make them as they are pretty complicated(like with a lot of ingredients) but they are homeade and would obviously taste better homeade, than from the shop :) things like: garlic sauce, BBQ sauce and soy sauce :)|`|25a691666619d82c7cf851709bf3ca80aa	Experiment! If you want a really tasty Chinese stir fry, start with <br>  - a 2cm chunk of Ginger chopped finely <br>  - 2 garlic cloves also chopped finely<br>  Fry gently in some vegetable oil for a couple of minutes. Put the heat up. Add the finely sliced meat to just brown it all over.<br>  <br>  Take out meat and stir in your vegetables till covered in oil. Add the rest of the sauce.<br>  - 2 tbsp soy sauce <br>  - 1 tbsp tomato puree<br>  - 1 tsp sugar<br>  - 3 tbsp chicken or vegetable stock. (Marigold stock powder is good.)<br>  - if you wish, replace some of the liquid with vermouth or sherry.<br>  <br>  Mix all this up, add to vegetables. Simmer for 1 minute then add meat again, with any juice etc. (If you wish a thicker sauce, add 1-2 tsps of cornflour mixed with a little water. Add this with the meat.) Simmer again for 1 -2 minutes - depends on thickness of meat.<br>  <br>  Serve with rice or noodles.<br>  <br>  If this is too salty, add less soy sauce, more sherry. All quantities are approximate here! This mixture was on TV years ago, but I have certainly altered it. The frying of the meat with the garlic and ginger gives the meat a distinct flavour so is worth the effort.|`|Zm6nJK9jaa	<a href="http://guideyou.crabdance.com" rel="nofollow">http://guideyou.crabdance.com</a><br>  A very informative website you can also get much information in website|`|M7Cdycxpaa	this one is REALLY nice!!!! <a href="http://www.cooks.com/rec/view/0,1825,155173-251198,00.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.cooks.com/rec/view/0,1825,155...</a><br>  go on to it!! its AMAZING!!|`|swFLFTgNaa	Teriyaki sauce and a few chillis! Mmm... Hope you like it! :)x|`|gLSyuegPaa	If you don't have time to make it, a really good brand is Bragg's Liquid Aminos. It is much better than those disgusting packets.|`|cT44tml3aa	If you mix Soy sauce, clear honey, ketchup, some five-spice powder it makes a delicious sauce.
53giV6PFaa	It is 2 cups or 32 tablespoons.  1 lb of cream cheese is actually 2 blocks of cream cheese you buy from the store, so it's already premeasured nicely for you.|`|PxJXJKCpaa	1lb equals 16 oz<br>  16 oz equals 2 cups<br>  1cup equals 16TBS<br>  <br>  Buy a Betty Crocker cook book.  It has the conversion charts in it.|`|7a29609061cc85b8213f55d1598f7a9aaa	It completely depends on the size of the cup you are using<br>  <br>  Think of it this way. If you are using just one recipe and you stick to the same cup throughout, you cannot go wrong!<br>  <br>  Use that cup to measure how many tbsps/tsps etc fill it, and go from there<br>  <br>  What i do is i keep a specific cup only for baking/ cooking, and as long as i make all my measurements in the one recipe in that one cup- they you just can't get it wrong<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|oMpNorCfaa	One pound is exactly 454 grams.<br>  Two cups of cream cheese would be 500 grams (250 grams is one cup.)<br>  So, that being said one pound of cream cheese would be one and three quarters cup cream cheese and an extra 9 grams ( so to be exact add about a finger tip size piece)
