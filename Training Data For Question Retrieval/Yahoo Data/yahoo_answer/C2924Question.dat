20090223080709AAf1Gfn	Environment;Global Warming	Is it a good idea to insist on shopping local products in order to curb climate change and famines*?	The people in Sweden seem to think so and every food stuff there is tagged with a symbol that the tells you whether it has been brought into the country by aeroplane. To minimize the consumption of everything is the general idea that's seen here at work, e.g. minimizing the avgas (gas/fuel/petrol) used by plane which is a lot more than if the same distance was covered by a truck delivering the goods (the harmful effect in terms of climate change that a plane causes is in almost all the cases a lot more harmful than a truck's/ship's/train's. (unless the distance is as long as a straight line is from Australia to the US through Europe/Africa). So the idea is really to produce the product (food stuff or any other type of products) in a place that is as close to the buyer as possible. The Swedish idea is supported by science (Meadows, Limits to Growth, 30-year update.)  However, an economist student told me that she thinks that it's really stupid to break down the production chains world wide. She thinks that it has taken decades to build a production chain that delivers the best products, and it has come to be organized in an efficient way along the years. At the current moment, food stuff is produced in places where they get a good quality out of a small amount money. People just don't know how to make a really good product of some type in every small country, so it's unreasonable to insist on eating local food. But she doesn't to explain more, as she's not interested in the climate change point of view. I'd still like to learn more about her view, and get some book references, if possible. You see I didn't really get what she was saying.       No climate change is a scam or conspiracy comments plz, 'cause they will just be laughed at in Sweden, and by the vast majority of the world population      Btw, I truly don't want to make people get too alarmed about famines and other disasters, things come in degrees and it's best we don't get too scared or try to overdo minimizing our individual impact on climate change. It's not supposed to consume all your thoughts and energy as every psychologist would agree. It's not healthy. Just do what feels comfortable, every little thing counts (e.g. recycling biodegradable waste, metal or glass etc.), as after all, famines and natural catastrophes come in degrees      *Famines are mentioned in the heading as they are explained to be one of the consequences of climate change in Meadows, Limits to Growth, 30-year update

20090223092248AAcEwdK	Environment;Global Warming	Does the "Global Warming" controversy exist because it doesn't follow accepted scientific methods?	The scientific method requires independent testing of a theory, however this step is skipped over when it comes to "Global Warming".  One researcher just makes a claim, and this is picked up by the news media and becomes the de facto truth.      No one has yet stated that it is going to get warmer, and here's the data that I used to come to that conclusion to let other people test his work independently.  Instead we're bombarded with statements like "the consensus of scientists believe water levels may rise 30 meters.".  This is just a statement of opinion and has nothing to do with science at all.      Computer models are notoriously undependable, with an accuracy rate no better than a flip of a coin.  NOAA had the mid west and Alaska at warmer than average temperatures this winter.  They misses that one by a parsec.      Would it be better for the science to hold back on journalistic sensationalism and wait until there was creditable evidence that the Earth is going to be warmer in the future?      Do these rushed and faulty predictions only make those who believe in "Global Warming" foolish for taking this information on faith?      Would "Global Warming" be better served if these 'scientists' stuck to the tried and true scientific method?

20090223093630AAbEw74	Environment;Global Warming	Earth expand and Global Warming?	Ok, on youtube i saw a video that stated the earth was expanding, primarily because lava underneath or something. It then showed numerous graphs of the change in Earth which supported the claim, and it said that scientists avoid telling the world this fact as they have done so much research on the earth being at the same size. Anyway, real or not. If this was true, would the Global Warming issue not have such a significant effect since the extra water will aquire more space to reside since the Earth is expanding? And is it true the earth is expanding? or is the video full of false claims?
