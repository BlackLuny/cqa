20070410150912AAvHsUz	Social Science;Psychology	Can u give me a critique?	My angry thoughts on a mountain top,   Over looking the fog below.   In the mist I see the world,    Struggling down below.      To dream a dream of maddened scenes,   And screaming from the massive blow.   Who better than myself to challenge   MY OPINION?   Yours is your own, because i do not listen.   I write a song to honor you in all that you achieve,   And in your greatness you will,   See how much you mean to me.   To you I am absolutely nothing,   But to me you mean everything.      I'll fill it all from front to back,   Line after line of chilling facts.   I see no end to my lifeline,   But i refuse to keep on trying.      This blinding suicide,   Slow deterioration of the mind,   Leads to senality, I'm losing all feeling,   Inside of me, becoming numb, I sigh.         A foul stench has come upon my existence,   A twisted soul such as mine.   A lost fool of death presents this and,   Makes aware that my heart is blind.   The fake desert sun in my dreams,   Never bakes down on me   Until I begin to cry  (more)

20070806141920AAHYcUf	Social Science;Psychology	Seguir como amigos o dejarla en paz?	No sé que hacer. Hace 4 meses le dije a mi amiga que me gustava, y aún así me trató bién y me dijo que no sentía lo mismo por mí, que me quería pero no de la misma forma.    Con el paso del tiempo, nos hizimos amigos y me dijo que quiere conservar nuestra amistad.      Pero yo aún siento algo por ella; es buena chica y tengo pocos amigos de verdad que sean tan buena persona como ella. Seguir como amigos (con el tiempo estaré mejor y la veré como amiga)? o dejarla y encontrar a alguien?   No sé que hacer.   Por otra parte, hace poco menos de 2 meses antes de que se fuera a su ciudad de vacaciones la cual reside todo su verano le dije que aun estava enamorado de ella, y que por eso estava mal y me declaré hacia ella diciendole que le guardaba rencor, solo porque quería olvidarme de ella en mi mente (ella no lo sabe q le guardava rencor porq queria olvidarme de ella...) y por eso se pensó lo peor, me pregunto en ese momento si la queria matar.. la vi extremadamente exajerada esa reacion pr supuesto

20090225151957AA8MIkN	Social Science;Psychology	Hey guys can you give me you opinion real quick?	Please read. I'll make this as short as I can. My sister found out she was pregnant instead of being honest with her best friend at the time she told some phony random lies to her to cover up the truth, she acted really weird. Our grandma died that same day too.I guess it was her way off handling the pressure situation. She called her up the 2 days later to apologize(her friend knew she was lieing at the time) but her friend felt so hurt and betrayed she cut her out of her life. My sister later went to her house and bought her chocolate. But she wanted nothing to do with her. She later said that friends should not be so much drama.   My sister also invited her best friend to a wedding in jamaica and she bailed because she said she couldn't trust her she was so hurt.      Is her friend being selfish. IS she a fairweather friend?   Or does my friend deserve this since she lied to her face and now can't be trusted? This was ther first fight by the way.

20090225153331AA0dXiz	Social Science;Psychology	Why Does This Happen When I try To Sleep?	Ok, for example yesterday, I meant to take a short nap but it ended up being a long sleep from 5pm to 2am (it was a long day) so when I woke up at 2 am I went an took my shower, got my school clothes ready and listened to my mp3 until it was about 4. School starts at 7:15 so I needed something to do to pass that time. So I tried going back to sleep, but when I started falling asleep/asleep, My body would go numb and I would get scared and my heart would start beating a little faster and then I could easily wake myself up. This happened every time I fell asleep, It was like I was still aware of things while I was sleep. This is not the first time this has happened but its the most recent. It always happen when I've been to sleep and then try to go back to sleep, Like my body is into rest mode but my mind isn't. Does anyone Know why this is?

20090128095807AAslyrs	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	PLEASE ANSWER!!! Important dream!!!!?	Hi, I had this very very clear dream when I was very young . Here is the dream and its still clear to me today:         I was walking down these old fashioned cobblestone streets. there were people everywere, but I was alone and looking for my mother. I was about 15 yrs old in the dream. A VERY LOUD siren was going off in the streets and it indicated a war was coming. Somehow I just KNEW thats what this siren meant , even though I had never heard it before and even though I was actually 5-6 yrs old in real life when I had this dream.          To me it seems like I saw a war about to take place, is this possible and could this have been a past life ?             I also would liek to know when sirens were used in past wars ? Thanks!

20090128145505AAf71Fh	Social Science;Psychology	Advice please: To help me to show my face to the outside world again?	I was in the shower earlier today, forgot to take my towel in but wasn’t too fussed as I knew that there was no one in. I came out the bathroom and walked to my room. I was walking down the corridor to my room, waggling my tail about when a room mate lead a group of about 10 lads and lasses in, viewing the accommodation for next September. To get to my room I had to walk past them, when I got there my door was shut and I had to walk past them again to collect my keys from the bathroom. All in all I walked past them 3 times, everyone was silent, I was bright red, holding the tears back.      When I got in the bedroom I shut the door and leaned back against it. All of a sudden I hear this great roar of laughter and they were all commenting on how small my cock was. Even the guy I lived with was mocking me. I slid down the door, curled into a ball and weeped.      I’ve not been out my room since.
20081112205238AAcpL41	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	My crazy dreams and what do they mean?	I constantly have weird re-occuring dreams. I have tried to study on them but they aren't really found. My dreams are much more in depth than that.      Dream #1- I am always being followed and chased by people. Its not anyone i know though, they are always different men or women.    I run away from them and escape for a while and then the dream is over.  They act like they dont want me to go, like they are trying to tell me something or keep me safe. Its so scary because i dont know them, i am afraid they will hurt me, although they havent tried. What does it mean?      Dream #2 - Ever since i was 9 years old i was having dreams about demons and people i have never seen before. I had dreams that little demons lived under my bed and in my closet and they were really vicious. They had long sharp teeth and claws and they shredded my clothes. I always had to fight them. They would come out of my grandparents basement while i waited for them to come into the living room or the kitchen. There would be people in my dream, but its like they didnt see me. Sometimes I tried to tell them the demons were coming, but they just looked at me and smiled. I would wait for them to come and i knew when they were coming because i felt this really eerie feeling it was just a horrible strong feeling of evil. I would have to grab them by the mouth and break their bones with my bare hands.   What does this mean?      Dream #3 - I am also having dreams about losing my teeth. Like...they would be decaying and break off into pieces. I would cry cause i didnt know if they would come back.      Dream #4- I always have dreams that i am flying. I feel so free cause i fly, but i get scared cause i can only go so high and i am afraid of heights.       Dream # 5- I meet different people everytime i sleep. I dont know them. Although i do get their names every-so-often. I've gotten a dillon, antonio, theodore, britney, mikey, things of that sort. I have never met anyone by the name of theodore, antonio, or even dillon.   Sometimes i get scared and think they are demons, but then i say that the demons are banished but the people arent gone. I am not so sure they are angels though, because they arent doing holy things when i see them. They are fighting and cussing, drinking and eating. There are so many of them. I go to parties with them and i see a lot of them around me.   Who are they? What does this mean?

20090128172154AAdiPsY	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	What does this dream mean?	I had this dream that I was at a museum.  My mom left me outside and walked inside and literally disappeared.  I saw a tower that was held up by 8 pillars in 4 places.  (One pillar on top of the other).  The tower part was also stacked by 5 towers.  In one jump I jumped on it.  I had trouble getting down so I jumped.  The first time it was fine.  After a few minutes of boredom, I jumped on it again without thinking.  I had trouble getting down again and jumped again, but this time it was about to fall.  I ran and tripped and fell down a short and steep hill.  The tower collapsed and the pieces disappeared.  A kid looked at me from the top of the hill and ran inside.  I climbed up the hill and ran inside too.  I didn't know that kid.  When I went inside I saw these two kids that i didn't know.  They were both brothers.  One older and one younger.  There was also a crowd of these short and weird looking beasts.  They grabbed the oldest by his wrists and were about to carry him away.  The youngest followed with a smile.  (They were holding the oldest as if it were a stage dive).  The oldest looked like he was having fun so I was about to let him go when I realized that it was a trap.  I ran after him, but his younger brother tried to stop me.  I did a suplex on him and he still got up so I finally managed to get him to stay down.  By that time I lost track of the oldest and woke up.  What does this mean?      I also had pretty much the same dream the night before.  I knocked over the tower, but ran and just before it hit the ground, I made it out of the way, but there wasn't the two kids and creatures part in it.  there also wasn't a hill the night before.

Would your parents still be proud of you? Do people generally have a high level of psychotic thoughts that go through their heads that they never act upon? Would the world be safer or more dangerous?

20090128205822AANtyUv	Social Science;Psychology	What are some resources on dealing with children who have been sexually abused?	Physical and sexual abuse is quite common in religious Jewish communities, taboos create perverts more often than they create saints, but no one talks about it, and in Israel, religious neighborhoods are patrolled by religious police (it is very, very difficult to get a religious man arrested) so I can't call the police. There are three houses in my neighborhood where abuse is occurring, and my wife has been letting the children from these houses sleep in our living room, and I don't mind, but every time I see their fathers (all religious scholars, arrrghh!!!) I want to kill them. What are some books I could read or websites I could visit to best deal with this situation? I would like to help them. I also have not been able to sleep since I got home, I stay awake at night in the living room with a handgun in my lap in case any of them try to come get their children from my house.
20090225154214AAZ2Tvr	Social Science;Psychology	Can anyone please tell me what this dream means?	I was very close with my grandpa, and he was the closest person to me, and I always wanted to be just like him. But he suddenly died last summer, and Ive been suffering ever since. And now I keep having this dream or similar to it...      My grandpa is alive and well and I'm over at his house just as I always was before he passed away. When I go to leave a man is walking past, and asks me where I am going. I give the man an awkward look and say "home", and he looks into a window of the house and i say "hey get away from there" and i punch him in the stomach. He then walks away, gives me a look, and says he'll be back. Later, at night I see that my grandpas house is in flames and I run into the house to save him...then my dream ends.      I need to know what this dream means, I miss him so much and I need to know what this means.

20090128191144AAdaIjs	Social Science;Psychology	Style advice based on personality description. Personal question.?	I want to have wavy natural coloured hair, and wear preppy (abercrombie, leggings, in style) clothes, with uggs- which is totally me! But i also want to have big lobes (gauged ears) piercings, wild eye-makeup, wicked white blonde/ rainbows and neon streaks and have lots of tattoos.       I have had 3/4'' earlobes, 5 facial piercings, wicked white blonde and pink hair with a totally punk wardrobe.   I've also had all "celebrity" clothing, heels, etc, naturally blonde long wavy hair, with natural eye makeup, and no piercings.      Right now I am a blank canvas.      I love drawing, painting, colouring(and shading), i like drama, I listen to indie, techno, electronic, hip-hop, emo, metal, and blues.   I have green eyes, am tall and skinny- and completely versatile.      I am the most experimental person ever and I love trying new things, but my style is lost within me.      Should i dress -preppy and have piercings, tats, and big earlobes, and wicked hair,    -or fullout preppy?   I am 100% artistic and can pull together any style put on task.

20090225153615AAdopQc	Social Science;Psychology	Is it possible to lose your sense of humour?	I used to be really wacky and funny and make people laugh all the time, but I've noticed in the past few years (since I had a run of depression) I've changed. I don't crack jokes so easily, and if I do they're not as observant and witty as they used to be.    I still find other people funny and can appreciate humour, but I used to write stand-up and now I can't seem to do it at all! Is there something wrong with me? Will it ever come back?

20090128212531AAJ0SdM	Social Science;Psychology	Are extreme mind games considered to be harressment?	I have discovered that my spouse of 4 years has been orchestrating an extreme mind game on me four the last 1.5 years using Holograms and other various techniques. These techniques have completely changed my outlook on life and has stripped me of all the self confidence I had. I do not trust anyone now as he has included my entire social circle in some form or another. Either they are involved, or they merely know about what is happening but won't fill me in on it.   I won't elaborate any further, but I will say that I am not at all the person I used to be nor do I have any faith in what I once knew was absolute. ie. questioning an alarm that I have heard repeatedly for over 3 years. to be real.   Would you consider that as harassment?
