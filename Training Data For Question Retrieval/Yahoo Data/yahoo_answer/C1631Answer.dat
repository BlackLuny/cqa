WpqwaqcQaa	The United States declared war on Great Britain in June 1812, but the contest did not threaten Louisiana until 1814.<br>  <br>  The British wanted to attack New Orleans and gain control of the entire Mississippi Valley.<br>  <br>  on the morning of 8 January 1815. The American defense held firm. The British were completely defeated losing over 2,000 men.<br>  <br>  New Orleans and the Mississippi Valley were saved from invasion. Coming two weeks after the peace treaty was signed that ended the war, the battle had no effect upon the peace terms; but it did bolster the political fortunes of Andrew Jackson.

pIzC411yaa	You don't really need a skill to come here you just need a visa and a green card then you have to become a citizen. You get citizenship you either have to marry a citizen or pass a citizen ship test. If you do go to live in the US, perhaps you could go to college here, and get a good back round on this nation. There are some great schools here like yale, harvard, princeton, brown, notre dame, ect... As for skills, if you are a musician alot of americans appreciate english musicians. I do as my favorite guitar player is jimmy page. But alot of americans are ignorant and look down on immigrants so you should have a good head on you shoulders and have the ability to roll with the punches as this economy is crazy and alot of times, you will get knocked down i this country so you have to get back up.

There is likely to be a salon in your neighborhood. I go to Supercuts in Rookwood. They have a lot of African-American stylists and customers. I have no idea if they would suit you.

WrDGhduxaa	I have been to South Korea several times. I enjoy the country and people. The big cities are much like all big cities.<br>  You will find many people who can speak some English, especially in big cities.<br>  I am always polite even if some is rude to me, I do not attack them it is better to smile and move away.<br>  If you know basic Korean words you will be very welcome and they will enjoy talking to you.<br>  The Koreans are used to Americans since there are several military bases there.<br>  You will have a good time and see many exotic and exciting things.<br>  Almost all of the people are polite.|`|4VzVfKvdaa	I actually found the opposite of AA.  The older generation is much nicer to foreigners than some of the younger generation because they know and remember what the US has done for them.  The younger Koreans see us as a hinderance, but also a curiosity.  Hip hop is king with the young people.  Also, there are many more foreigners (about 100,000 US alone) in Korea than in Japan and they are spread out all over the country and as long as you stay in the larger cities, you will be pretty much ignored and taken for granted.  However, if you are freakishly tall or blonde haired, you may get stared at.  Foregners can even have bank accounts in Korea without much fuss.|`|pexDbdCuaa	I definately found the Koreans (well, at least the younger generation) more open and loving towards foreigners than the Japanese~<br>  <br>  Of course I think...coz of the Korean history with Americans and stuff...well, yeah the older generation were a tad scary ^^;;; <br>  <br>  BUT! In general the people were very nice, polite and when they hear foreigners speaking Korean they LOVE you! Lol they sometimes get a bit excited and may start blabbing to you in Korean, but that's just the way they are :) <br>  <br>  I find it really good how you are not one of those ignorant people...definately learn Korean and go explore Korea!

5c07eea93e2b7eb3dfa4e16ee3a3c43eaa	Westerners could probably say the same of most Malay speakers trying to speak their language, but it would be equally non-constructive.  Western languages use a different set of phonetics.  Essentially, the languages are built off of different kinds of sounds.  There are sounds in Malay that are not included in some western languages at all, and vice versa.  When a native speaker of Malay speaks a Western language they also sound strange.  I don't think the pronunciation of a foreign language should be the basis of your assessment of someone's masculinity.  If they mispronounce, and you think it is appropriate to do so, offer to correct their mistake, otherwise simply do your best to understand them.|`|gMgh2ypsaa	It is the same as when a Malaysian speaks english they sound like a 5 year old kid.<br>  <br>  Often the vocabulary the Malaysians know is of a 2nd grade level in an English speaking country.<br>  <br>  Also we pronounce some of out vowels and consonants differently than in the Malay language so sometimes we don't quite get the words right just like Malaysians make the same mistakes in reverse.|`|pIxrdAVKaa	i pronounce Z as "zack"..<br>  everybody sounds like that when we try new things..|`|BCstOBfyaa	because they watch too many movies in "ZEE" channel, ask Mr.Singh he will tell you|`|tYK776fEaa	hmm... The way u ask the question is like when u r speaking english, ur english is very perfect and immature n not sound like a 5 years old kid... no offence...<br>  They sound odd when speaking malay is because they are too use to their mother tongue. Pronunciation is completely different from malay. For example the word AIR. In malay it's pronounce as "ayer" but in english it's "air"...<br>  As for the Z question, American pronounce Z as "zee" whereby the British pronounce as "zet". Since Malaysia was once under the British colony, tat's y we pronounce Z as "zet'.|`|IMPh53Ssaa	haha same thing when asian person speaks engrish<br>  <br>  <br>  you are speaking about the differences of New World English and Old world and Australia/New Zealand, its just the way we pronounce it<br>  <br>  <br>  its like we Americans call a Garage a (Ga Raj) while brits say (Ger rej)|`|5rRnSNQhaa	i have never heard of them speak malay before|`|ivdpHmaxaa	entahla beb.. maybe lidah dia ore ni keras kut..|`|gWleYSuIaa	Yeah, Malaysia is such an advanced country - NOT|`|0exde9VEaa	The English pronounce Malay words using English language sounds, e.g. air (water) which we pronounce as ayer, but the English pronounce as ear....

BLD9EEWNaa	You need to go to the embassy or Consulate- are you American?  How much time do you have before your visa runs out?  I need more information, but I will assume that your American.<br>  <br>  <br>  So, you obviously have a short term (Type C) visa.  It may be harder for you to extend your visa than to apply for a new one.  But if you are studying and you are already accepted into the program, then it should be relatively easy- just go to the office of your school and they should be able to help you, I'm sure they encounter this problem quite frequently.  If you are not with a school that is used to foreigners, then you need to go directly to the Embassy or Consulate of your country.  Good luck.

The people there are very welcoming. The school system there is very high up-compared to other countries. It's great. <br>  <br>  The only 2 things I might be worrying about though would be the weather and the economy. Ireland is known for rain upon rain. Sure there are those nice days, but be prepared for rain. The other thing is their economy. Honestly, at the moment it is very bad there. People are losing their jobs far-more then in any other countries.

4qcCsyOzaa	The best place is the airport. This is because they don't charge a fee and you get the full market value of the money. Most large banks, such as the Bank of Taiwan, can change money but you should check to see what is the current exchange rate before going because they might see you as a foreigner and try to give you a bad rate just because they think you don't know what it is. It hasn't happened to me but some of my friends have had that problem. You will need your passport or a Taiwanese resident if you go to a bank and currency that is the most current version of your countries money. New bills are the best. Sorry I can't be of more help, I don't know much about Taipei. <br>  <br>  Live rates at 2009.02.25 21:13:33 UTC<br>  1.00 SGD =  22.8018 TWD|`|7K3RcnNcaa	Go to any bank.  You will need your passport.  Or, just use your ATM at any bank.<br>  <br>  Food, of any description, is great in Taiwan, but western food can be disappointing.  It tends to be expensive, or lousy, or both.  Stick to Chinese dishes.<br>  <br>  To find outdoor eating stalls, step out of your hotel and walk three blocks in any direction.

csvrCMoLaa	my wife and i are going to playa del carmen in cancun next week with taxes and all (flight hotel) it is an all inclusive came out to $2300 total we did a room upgrade to make sure we got a king size bed instead of 2 double beds, better view etc, that was an extra $90 a night.  it was for 3 nights too. i also chose different flights per the time we wanted to leave in the morn i booking and our return flight, so that added some extra money too.  we booked  it through expedia  i researched it off and on for 3 months then they dropped the price over a weekend that dropped the cost about $700 total to that $2300 price.  <br>  <br>  here's some inside info, if you have an account set up with expedia (its free)  create a trip and save it with out buying it.  make sure its just one trip that's saved at a time.  if you wait a few days you will get an email from expedia for some sort of discount on that trip.  its some  sort of email marketing they do.  <br>  <br>  i hope this helps|`|Fu7KQieyaa	A few years ago I went to Costa Rica and plane tickets and a week at an all-inclusive resort cost me and my friend each about $1200 each, and we flew in from Michigan.

KKH9y0ECaa	London is a big diverse city, and the same criticisms could equally be levelled at other big cities such as New York and LA, or big expensive tourist traps like Paris or Rome.<br>  <br>  London is in fact one of the safest large cities on the planet, as well as also being amongst the greenest big cities with beautiful parks throughout the city and new nature reserves being built within areas such as the Thames Gateway.|`|972OdSIJaa	yes to some people.<br>  but east ham aint that bad or romford.|`|3RyvKIvPaa	Personally I think London is overrated.<br>  The shops (other than the fancy ones like the ones you talk about, which aren't that great anyway) are the same shops you'll find anywhere. Think I'd rather shop somewhere thats less hastle!<br>  Alot of the people, are rude and obnoxious most of the time. Very unhelpful. (I remember once I was there and asked for directions, the minute the person heard my Manchester accent they looked at me like I was a piece of ****.) <br>  And yeah, they never apologise or anything! <br>  I was on a train once, going from Euston to Watford Junction, it was PACKED and they were still trying to cram theirselves in. There was absoloutley NO room to move once the train started moving, so what did all the Londoners do? Got out their broadsheets and started reading them, not really caring who they smacked in the face really.<br>  Seriously weird bunch of people down there.<br>  And as for crime, you're right, you are more likely to get pickpocketed. People go on about crime in Manchester, but really I think its a whole lot safer than London.<br>  <br>  In other words, no, it isn't all they make it out to be ;)|`|I5cF2hXdaa	Personally i think you answered your own question with your opinions of London and i have to agree with you.

Some people see life though a negative frame of mind rather than a positive one.<br>  <br>  What people have to ask themselves is - are the negatives less than the positives?  In the case of London they are.<br>  <br>  Let's start with "town centre is full of shops where belts are ￡20".  Load of rubbish.  Primark, New Look, H&M, Next, Marks and Spencer etc. have cheaper stuff and their prices are the same as any branch of the store no matter where it is located.  Let's not forget the huge amount of markets, vintage and second hand stores where bargains can be found.<br>  <br>  Drinks and necessities are twice the price of anywhere else in the country.  Food in fruit / meat / fish markets is much cheaper than most places in the UK.  Up in Aberdeenshire where all the food has to be transported by road, the basics are more expensive.  Drinks in pubs and bars are slightly pricier but not 3 times.<br>  <br>  Nobody speaks english.  Well I do and I live in London.  <br>  <br>  Twice as likely to be pickpocketed in London than anywhere else in the UK?  Really?  Even Dorset had around 50 incidents of knife crime last year.  I feel generally safe in London as there are so many people around.  I have never been pickpocketed but I am careful not to go keeping my wallet in my pocket or waving my money around at a cash machine.  I would take these precautions in any country.  I generally feel more unsafe in Birmingham or Manchester as there are huge concentrated areas of pubs and bars in one place which can make it quite scary on a night out sometimes.<br>  <br>  Worst suburbs in the country.  Have you been to some of the suburbs of Glasgow, Liverpool, Birmingham, Newcastle?  They make Romford look like a 5 star resort.<br>  <br>  People are unfriendly?  I always find that if I drop something, someone picks it up for me, if I smile and say please, they smile back.  If you don't practice politeness yourself then people won't do it back to you.  I always find people lovely and friendly if you talk to them first.  They're just nervous and doing what everyone else does.  I have always found people very apologetic if they accidentally bump into me and have never been stared at.  Unless you count people trying to flirt with me!|`|ZTc7rE1Haa	Have you ever been here? It doesn't seem as if you have. I was born in London and have lived here all my life and I am nearly forty-nine. I've never been the victim of any crime or seen any crime committed. Yes, some of the suburbs are frightening at night, but I'm fortunate enough to live in a lovely area. Londoners are reserved at first, by necessity, but we are friendly once we enter into conversation. We are always happy to assist when a tourist asks for directions. You say that nobody speaks English. That's not strictly true, although I do agree that those of us who were born here are becoming a minority. London is not what it used to be, but it's still a wonderful city and a great place to visit.|`|b8tgCAQJaa	That's tourists for you.<br>  <br>  A lot of the things that those tourists like about London would either be tourist attractions (which they'd get bored of after a few weeks of living in London), or things you can find anywhere in the UK, not just London.<br>  <br>  Carrie S - have you ever actually been to Newcastle? I live there, and even the worst Newcastle estates are nowhere near as bad as some of the ones in London I've had the misfortune to walk through. In the whole North of England, it's only really Manchester that rivals London for crime, violence, and general lack of safety.<br>  <br>  I actually like London and have lived there (and may do so again in the near future), but I'm not so blinkered that I can't see its flaws.|`|af1fe9ebe396bd1dc330674aa3329c96aa	Yep, we are all grumpy wnakers :)  By European standards it is a HUGE city, which kind makes all the impersonal and crime stuff inevitable.  Me, I _loathe_ my journey to work and even take a longer route to stay over ground and avoid the crammed tube.  But I love my job which I really can only do here and l go to about three good gigs a week, which is important to me.   <br>  <br>  Oh, and the East London suburbs you mention ain't that bad anymore.|`|ZNI3LmBRaa	The reason that you have experienced a rubbush time in London is that you are staying in the areas that are for tourists.

If you want to raise kids here - don't. they generally become horrible unless you shelter them. <br>  the whole, don't look at me on the tube thing, is because of the amount of *WIERD* people who are aggressive and/or talk to themselves/ are drunk or smell on it. You have to be that way to protect yourself on the tube.<br>  So don't live here unless you like the mad, materialistic party lifestyle, unfriendly people and bad councils|`|5ede303e3f09ef934bb1a71e8b13e26aaa	London is the greatest city on Earth, I don't car what anyone says.  It's just got something about it.  Yeah, there are rough areas but you get those everywhere.  Have you ever been in the rough end of Paris?  It's easily as scary as Hackney.  By the way, Romford is in Essex, not in London, duh.<br>  Stuff isn't that expensive either, it's just like any touristy area in that you have to know where to go and not buy stuff on Oxford street the same way you wouldn't buy it on Las Ramblas in Barcelona.<br>  You just sound like a bit of an old fart for saying all that really.

Some might call me rude because i am one of those people who does not always say someything if i happen to bump into you for i don't notice that i have done it or i am into much of a rush to get somewhere hence why i need to get past you fast.  but i usually apologize.

2HETgiwgaa	The only male in my family (including my partner, father, brother, son and three nephews) who has been circumcised, had it done for a specific medical reason.  Personally, (I'm a pakeha (European) NZer) I don't see it as necessary - I have no cultural reason for having my son circumcised, and although there are some reported medical benefits (like reductions in transmission of STDs), I'm not convinced that those benefits outweigh the benefits of keeping the foreskin - both for normal penile health and for enjoyment later in life (if you know what I mean).<br>  <br>  Rates are low generally in NZ - 10-20%.  But, there are higher rates amongst Pacific Island communities here - reported rates get up towards 100% - and, of course, Jewish and Muslim communities.  I've included links to a few articles you might find interesting - from both sides of the debate.|`|qU1G6FmHaa	It's unnecessary, it's obscene, it's barbaric, it's torture of some smaller than the perpetrator (that is called bullying), and it's done in the name of God. Huh - some God who approves of this sort of thing.<br>  <br>  The anatomical reason for a foreskin is to protect the very sensitive glans from injury and unintentional contact with external objects.<br>  About 30% of all males born in western countries are circumcised, and 70% of those are American.<br>  An American doctor recently came out with all the tired old "reasons" why the practise should be done, and made very emphatic points. BUT a look at his name at the end of the article showed that he was Jewish, and he was only parroting what Jews have been saying for 5000 years.<br>  <br>  I don't know how much male circumcision is done in NZ, but I'd venture to suggest that it's a small number. After all, why copy the Americans only because they are copying the Jews.<br>  Female circumcision is outlawed by the UN and illegal in most countries, even those that practise it widely. It's carried out for the nearly the same reasons, but it's still unnecessary.<br>  <br>  I suspect that the real reason why it came about is that the church and tribal elders did not like to think that the nerve endings situated in both the clitoris and the glans may give that person a bit of sexual pleasure, and wow, we wouldn't want that, would we.|`|ea1fe0ad90bfbd91db5c9fac7052e639aa	There is a big movement against it here, but not sure why as I think it is a good practice.

I think this is a Jewish plan to weaken the Ummah by trying to reduce our birth rates and numbers. There are now 2 billion Muslims and we should keep having children. Remember:<br>  <br>  "Abu Dawood (2050) narrated that Ma’qil ibn Yasaar said: A man came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and said, “I have found a woman who is of good lineage and is beautiful, but she does not children. Should I marry her?” He said, “No.” Then he came again with the same question and he told him not to marry her. Then he came a third time with the same question and he said: “Marry those who are loving and fertile, for I will be proud of your great numbers before the other nations.” Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Irwa’ al-Ghaleel, 1784. <br>  <br>  "This hadeeth indicates that it is encouraged to marry women who are fertile, so that the numbers of the ummah will increase, and so the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) will feel proud of his ummah before all other nations. This shows that it is encouraged to have a lot of children."<br>  <br>  If Allaah has blessed us with more children before the other nations, why should we use contraceptives?|`|DSVUvfGuaa	Well just wait ... as the Economy crises hit harder in Egypt, then the increase of population is going to be much higher than ever.

Discriminatory and Dishonest Immigration System.<br>  Immigration to Canada is based on a point system, obtained with your education, qualifications and job experience. Points are good enough for immigration, but in Canada, they are not good enough to get a job in your field. Amazing, how the credentials that qualify you to come to Canada are the same credentials that don't qualify you for your profession in Canada. The reason is, Canada only wants immigrants to do the labor jobs - pizza delivery, driving taxis, factory work etc.<br>  <br>  <br>  7. Out Of Control Cost Of Living.<br>  From rent, to utility bills, to shopping, to phone, internet and cable bills, to gas, to car insurance, to eating out, to basically anything you have to pay for or buy, the cost of living in Canada has become astronomical. Recent immigrants are astonished as to how expensive everything is. It is estimated that compared to most countries around the world, the cost of living in Canada is on average five times greater.<br>  <br>  <br>  6. Health Care Crisis.<br>  Practicing physicians in Canada are in a shortage, 1 in 4 Canadians cannot get a family doctor. Canadian doctors are leaving to move permanently to the United States. Statistics Canada and the Canadian Medical Association both have identified that for every 1 American doctor that moves to Canada, 19 (nineteen) Canadian doctors move to the United States! Doctors in Canada are overworked and underpaid, and there is a cap on their salaries.<br>  <br>  <br>  5. Very High Taxes.<br>  Yes, you have the GST, the PST, totaling 15%, on practically everything you purchase and many other taxes taken out of our weekly paycheck. You have to pay a whopping amount to the government, out of your hard earned salary, so that the government can turn around and give it to beer drinking, hockey watching welfare bums. Fair? It does not matter, it's Canada.<br>  <br>  <br>  4. Money Hungry Government.<br>  Canadian Embassies around the world lie to foreigners, painting this picture that Canada is Utopia, because they want them to come to Canada. Why? Because foreigners bring money! So after being deceived, these foreigners come. They must bring with them at least $10,000. Canada has an immigration quota of 250,000 per year. So please do the math, 250,000 multiplied by $10,000 each equals a whopping 2.5 Billion dollars that Canada gains from immigrants every year.<br>  <br>  <br>  3. No Culture.<br>  Unlike almost every other country in the world, Canada has no culture. Actually American culture is what dominates Canada. When was the last time you had some 'Canadian' food? There are no Canadian traditions and there is no national identity. What does it even mean to call yourself a 'Canadian'. . .nothing really. People living in Canada, still identify themselves with the country they 'originally' came from.<br>  <br>  <br>  2. Worst Weather.<br>  Yes, Canada has the worst weather conditions of any country in the world. Freezing cold temperatures, snow, ice, hail, winds, storms etc. From the Prairie provinces to the Maritimes, from the Territories to southern Ontario, the weather is so horrific and disgusting that many Canadians leave Canada simply because of this reason alone.<br>  <br>  <br>  1. No Jobs.<br>  Yes, coast to coast, there are no jobs. Immigrants are highly qualified (MD's, PhD's, Lawyers, Engineers etc.) but they are driving taxi cabs, delivering pizza's or working in factories. Even people with bachelors degrees from Canadian Universities cannot find jobs after graduation. This is the tragedy associated with immigration to Canada. I feel sorry for those immigrants who are stuck in Canada for the rest of their lives. It is indeed a very sad and hopeless future.<br>  <br>  <br>  Broad daylights shootings.<br>  <br>  Break-ins and MS 13 (Most dangerous gang in the world)<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Vancouver is now...<br>  <br>  The Gang Capital of North America.<br>  <br>  ... and fast becoming worst...<br>  <br>  MS13 is now right on your son's and daughter's doorsteps.|`|HESMf5ZUaa	Try looking here<br>  <a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/print/ca.html" rel="nofollow">https://www.cia.gov/library/publications...</a><br>  <br>  and here<br>  <a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/print/nz.html" rel="nofollow">https://www.cia.gov/library/publications...</a><br>  <br>  Otherwise anecdotally people relate the canada / US relationship as being a bit like the NZ / Australia one of big / small brother

What's more, today is Saturday, so expect some parties here and there.
CNvbCpgLaa	I used to live there four years ago. It's not bad, really. Actually it's quite nice in a lot of ways, weak in others but, as always, it depends on what you're looking for.<br>  <br>  Naples is a real snowbird type place. Many of the residents are older, retired midwesterners who live there during the cold months. The traffic is terrible in late winter but it thins out drastically by the summer months. There's not much of a middle class there except for teachers and health care workers. Most people, it seems, are either the wealthy retired folks or the people who serve them. You'll find lots of Haitian people and some Mexicans as well--not all of whom intend to stay there very long. <br>  <br>  There are plenty of nice homes including an amazing number of million-dollar homes. Lots of golf courses, too, along with a zoo and a mall.<br>  <br>  As for the economy, I'd say much of it is driven by tourism, health care, and education. As for nightlife, there's not a heck of a lot but there's always Fifth Avenue South. There are plenty of restaurants there along with a few places to dance, especially during the weekend. There are a few movie theaters and the Philharmonic Hall which has plays, concerts, and other live performances. There are a few nice parks and a dinner theater, too.<br>  <br>  The beaches are nice - Naples Beach, Vanderbilt Beach. The sand is white and the gulf water is warm much - but not all - of the time. There are a few nice hotels including not one but two Ritz Carltons.<br>  <br>  Jobs are not too plentiful around here and once I quit the one I had I was pretty much stuck doing menial jobs until something better came along that required me to move out of state. You might want to keep that in mind because Naples is a small city and Tampa and Ft. Lauderdale are two or three hours away. Closer is Ft. Myers and Cape Coral but I hear that the job market and real estate market are quite poor nowadays.<br>  <br>  Generally speaking Naples is pretty quite and laid back--allright, it's pretty dull most of the year. The peak tourist season would be from January to mid-April or so; that's when things can get pretty unpleasant with long lines and traffic jams.<br>  <br>  There aren't too many big league sports fans in the area, perhaps because it's so far from any big city. I'd say the big sport is golf along with, perhaps, sailing and fishing.
WxKNmxdaaa	I used to live in NYC for a short time as an intern. There are so many things to do in NYC that it's hard to narrow it down. I would skip Planet Hollywood if I were you. They don't have the best food. If you want to try a fun chain restaurant, I'd go to the ESPN zone in Times Square. Not necessarily a great idea for a fun girls lunch you say? I beg to differ, being a gal myself. The restaurant is on the second floor and has a view of Times Square. Very cool. They have pretty good food, and excellent desserts. My favorite is the the half baked cookie with ice cream. Delicious! Plus, it is a great place to meet single guys! I would definitely go and see a show as well while you are already in Times Square. There are so many amazing shows to see. Very fun. But if you want to try something new and a bit more swank, I'd go to a smaller cafe style restaurant in Little Italy or in Soho. The best shopping is in Soho, so why not eat there too? My favorite thing to do while in NYC was to ride the subway to Brooklyn and walk over the Brooklyn bridge. It is best to do this at sunset. You will get views of the NYC skyline that are breathtaking. I did this with everyone who came to visit me and they too thought it was the best free thing to do in the city. The other great free thing to do in NYC is to ride the ferry to Staten Island. You will get a free ride to see the Statue of Liberty as well as a great view of the NY skyline too. Going at sunset is again best. Bundle up and go outside on deck to view the amazing views. For delicious cake, why not go to some of the famous cupcake shops in the city? These are delicious cakes! You could do a cupcake tour and visit all of the cupcake shops in the city. There are so many good ones to try. Here are a few: Mongolia Bakery, Tribeca Treats, Buttercup Bake Shop. Not only will you get your birthday cake, but you will get to see a lot of the city along the way!|`|qdzz6ZJkaa	bus tours are fun, attractions and even planet hollywood meals here <a href="http://www.citysightsny.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.citysightsny.com/</a><br>  <br>  have fun|`|abELhjcoaa	the village is always fun, id suggest seeing if there are any concerts or festivals happening, then again walking down the street can also be fun, as for cake, serendipity 3 is always fun for birthdays, theres also that chocolate by the bald man place by union square if she enjoys chocolate,  then again theres always something to do.|`|4WnazyS7aa	I have been taken out to NYC for my bday.

wPMnHjoHaa	All airlines around the world allows you to bring and use your laptops on board. They only do not want you to use it during take off and landing, because it may interfere with the plane's radio system. (they both operate in 2.4 GHz frequency range)<br>  I have heard some airlines offers internet connection but I don't know if Midwest does yet. The plug may depend on the plane's model. Boing and Airbus have started to put those plugs a couple years ago. If the plane you will be flying is not a new one, you probably won't see a plug.|`|86e53ae673b0e71a74c555f56f9f3708aa	You can bring your laptop, but only for games and messing around. Midwest does not offer internet, only a few airlines do. Midwest also does not have power ports, so fully charge your laptop before you go. You can only use your laptop when the flight crew announces that it's ok or when the seat belts signs are turned off, also anything that transmits wirelessly like a wireless mouse or wireless headphones are not allowed. You'll also need to place your laptop in a separate plastic tray at the security checkpoint for x-ray, so keep it handy.<br>  <a href="http://www.seatguru.com/airlines/Midwest_Airlines/Midwest_Airlines_Boeing_717-200_B.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.seatguru.com/airlines/Midwest...</a>

You can get paris for about $150 a night.  and bellagio if you book in advance you can get for about $160.|`|dFBccLExaa	I've heard bad things about the Imperial Palace... so that depends. <br>  The places I stay most often (on a budget) would be Luxor, New York New York, and the Monte Carlo.

For example - Circus-Circus is great if you have children as there is loads for them to do. I have stayed at Stardust which i really liked because it was affordable, decent and a little way away from the centre of the strip. Weirdly the tropicana is quite expensive and yet quite run down. Excalibur was a reasonable compromise, not too expensive but lots of facilities.|`|H7GtXRqGaa	Ballys, Bills Gambling Hall and Casino, Harrah's all right on the strip and really good with reasonable rates and good facilities.

0nIK4qWTaa	Have a plan B. I lived in Miami for years. I love photography. I thought it would be great to get a picture of the sunrise from south beach. I had access to the beach like any body. I also had access to several tall buildings. 3 months went by and I never got the picture I was hoping for. Maybe I wanted to much I don't know. I expected to see the change in colors as the sun come close to breaking the horizon. Then I wanted to see the sun over the water. It just never happened. <br>  <br>  Will you have a good time yes. Will you enjoy the view yes. I just enjoyed the moonrise and moonsets in Florida better. The used to be a bar in the keys that had a sunset/sunrise party but that was 15 years ago. <br>  <br>  I would take a picnic basket, and a blanket.<br>  <br>  North or South Beach should be great places to go in any case.  <br>  <br>  The links below tell you the time for sunrise and sunset. <br>  Also a hotel in the Florida Keys ( Never been there ) but it might be an alternative.|`|A7cWzCmpaa	the beach on the east coast, i like south beach or you can go further like you said around north beach.  get a blanket, sit, cuddle, wait and  watch.  sounds nice|`|d00b10dabc9468cf41167a88d638ae41aa	anywhere along the beach...but i LOVE key biscayne...|`|hEU4SlhTaa	I would think that they sky would be the bets place to watch it.|`|ze4Gt1araa	I believe in South Beach right in front of the ocean :)|`|OqQPzYfHaa	on any roof building

4xOXiZcNaa	Um... just WHAT is your NATIONALITY?  you people never seem to think this is important.<br>  <br>  When I lived in Paris I lived on Rue Clairaut and was just a few blocks down the hill from the Moulin Rouge... and for a young, single guy... that puts you right in the party area of paris... IT'S NOT CHEAP... my little apartamont was on the 5th floor of a walk up building and no elevator... and it cost me nearly $900 PER MONTH back in the early 1980's, so it's probably double that now.

But in my 20's I liked Hyannis.  It's a great spot for nightlife, restaurants, and shopping.

7B9KEqCnaa	The effiefel tower at paris is nice, plus you get a nice view of the bellagio fountains.   Go at night and make some reservation at the restaurant inside the tower.  <br>  <br>  You can do a spa package together at the hotel your staying at.  or catch one of the cirque shows, I recommend KA or O.<br>  <br>  Dont do the gondola ride at the venetian.  its a rip off. Its 10 a minute ride thats gonna cost you $32 bucks plus your gonna have another couple on there with you.  If you want a private ride its gonna cost you $64 bucks.   Money better spent gambling.|`|mldo1vxYaa	You can have dinner in the restaurant at the top of the eiffel tower at Paris, you can take a gondola ride at the Venetian, have dinner at the top of the stratosphere, and you definitely have to see the bellagio fountains, not sure if you would call it romantic but its definitely a must see.<br>  <br>  Oh you can also get a helicopter ride down the strip at night, and you get a glass of champagne also.|`|nf2xk9Ffaa	We liked to spend a little time off the strip.

CGFfP80kaa	Obviously there is the Opera house and Harbour Bridge to see which are located on one of the most beautiful harbors in the world. You can book in to actually climb the bridge which is very interesting and provides tremendous views.  You can take a ferry to Manly which is a great beach community.  Bondi Beach is another great spot for hanging out, eating and people watching.  The Tooronga Zoo is world class.  The Hunter Valley Wine region is close by and makes for a good overnighter.  The Blue Mountains are also another good day trip.  There are heaps of great parks, restaurants and pubs in Sydney.  The Botanical gardens are good for an afternoon stroll as is Darling Harbour which is a bit touristy but nice and there is a great aquarium there.  Kings Cross and the Darlinghurst area are fun night spots and Oxford Street in Paddington has good shopping if thats what you are into.  Chinatown near the city is worth a look as well.  The Centerpoint tower located in the center of the city has an observation deck which offers great views of the city.  Also depending on when you come there are great festivals especially in January and sports like Cricket, Rugby, Soccer, and Australian Rules Football are great fun to go and watch.  You can also tour the site of the 2000 Olympics at Homebush or take a double decker bus tour around Sydney.  In short there are many things to do here or you can do what I really like doing and that is to just hang out, walk around and soak in the place.

AHpzpRieaa	Hi! I live in Chile and have family in Argentina, so I've traveled a lot over there. Both are reasonably safe, so just be careful and cautious and you'll be fine. Argentina IS a little more unstable and there's a bit more crime, but people are really nice and I've never felt unsafe over there.<br>  <br>  In Santiago, it really also depends on the area you stay in. As in any big city, some neighborhoods are dangerous, but in all likelihood you'll never even go there, so don't worry. Nice and central areas to live in are: Providencia, Las Condes, ?u?oa. A little farther away but also very nice: Vitacura, La Reina, Lo Barnechea. Santiago centro (downtown) is also OK but very busy. Other "comunas" are also safe and nice, depending on neighborhood - I'm just giving you the nicer ones :)<br>  <br>  From Santiago, you can visit Mendoza (Argentina) in 6 hours by bus, so you  can see Argentina as well!|`|Sp5zcBLyaa	I've been in both places, in Argentina i spent time in Buenos Aires (Capital city) and i have lived in Santiago, Chile for 20 years.<br>  Crime rates are higher in Argentina, assaults being the most common thing, in Chile you do have a lot of burglary but depends on which area you are living. <br>  If you are careful and watch your things you shouldn't have any trouble living in Chile. Providencia, Las Condes, Vitacura are the safest areas in Santiago, so i would recommend those to look for a place to live.<br>  As for cost Argentina is cheaper than Chile, but they speak a type of spanish that i am not sure that will help you increase your  expertise on spanish...unless you want to speak everything with a Ché on it.<br>  The semester begins in march having winter break on the end of july and starts over in august. <br>  I hope i helped you.|`|CMWzDKN7aa	Siberia

Carnival, RCCL and Princess would be best. We are told that Celebrety and Holland America are elegant, but half the people on board have those blasted motorized scooters and the lines move slower than molassis in January. Going during school time reduces the number of kids on board, just in case you were wondering. We have found Carnival to be more inclusive than Princess. We have never cruised with RCCL.

Try this website for some very reasonable priced hotels. <a href="http://tracking.alpharooms.com/idevaffiliate.php?id=411" rel="nofollow">http://tracking.alpharooms.com/idevaffil...</a> I always use them and when I stayed in Orlando we stayed at the orlando metropolitan resort which I found on that website.<br>  <br>  We paid 280 dollars for 2 adults and 1 child for 10 nights including a buffet breakfast, its a 4 star hotel right on International drive so close to everything and it has free transportation to the theme parks. Also I would check out www.universalstudiosorlando.com for park tickets as they are a lot cheaper than disney.<br>  <br>  Sometimes they have weekly tickets for both parks which you can buy for little more than a day at disney, we paid 90 dollars for a week for both parks before.|`|jxudIY5Taa	AVOID FLORIDA AT ALL COSTS!

You would most likely get them in the system faster though if you dealt directly with the Embassy/High Commission since that is where the Consulates send them on to.

Take magazines, a book, an mp3 playesr or ipod, and cross word or sudoku puzzles.

JoC6dlASaa	Australia has a much smaller population than Australia: 22 million in AUS, 300 million in America. <br>  Australia's coastline is essentially the only area that can sustain people living since the middle of Australia is dessert, unlike the US which has cities and towns throughout.<br>  Australia is still part of the Queen's commonwealth of England and America is an independent Republic.<br>  Australia has many more government sponsored programs such as national health care than America, therefore the people expect the government to help them out more than people in America.<br>  Australia has less competitive business models ( ie: Coles and Woolies only ) than in America which helps to keep prices down ( in the US ) in the grocery store.<br>  Australia has higher wages in the service and retail industries than in America partly due to the " no tipping ' rule in Australia which is also why in my opinion service is really bad in most pubs and restaurants.<br>  America is 78% white and Christian, Australia is 92% white and Christian but overall Australians are less religious than Americans.<br>  America had a much much higher population of Jewish people than Australia.<br>  Men in Australia are shorter than the men in America.<br>  There is no mail delivery on Saturday in Australia and the postpeople do not pick up mail from your house.<br>  The Australian school year is from late January to mid December whereas the American school year is from early September to mid-June. Australian schools do not have yellow school buses.<br>  The seasons are opposite.<br>  Other than Melbourne, shops ( stores ) close at 5pm on weekdays whereas shops in the US usually stay open until 9pm.<br>  Australians get Boxing Day as a public holiday, they don't in the US.<br>  There is no tipping in Australia.<br>  Australians suffer from "Tall Poppy Syndrome" which means they put down people who are successful. This syndrome does not exist in the US.<br>  Australians consume more beer, chocolate and ice cream per capita than the Americans.<br>  Australia drives on the left side of the road, Americans on the right side.<br>  Australia has a higher incident of skin cancers than in America.<br>  In Australia when you go to a party, you bring your own beverages to drink (and in some cases, your own food), in America, your hosts ( who are having the party) supply all food and beverages.<br>  Australia has ute's, the US does not. They used too but they stopped making them.<br>  In Australia, it is compulsory to vote and you get fined if you do not vote. In America, it is not compulsory to vote.<br>  Highway lanes ( Motorway Lanes ) are slightly narrower in Australia than in America.<br>  In Australia, the date is written: day/month/year. In America, the date is written: month/day/year<br>  In Australia, they use military time, for example 1pm is 13:00. In America, only the government and healthcare facilities do that. <br>  In America paper money is all the same size and the same colour. In Australia, paper money is a different size and colour for each denomination. Also, Australia has a one and two dollar coin. They also do not have pennies in Australia, so when you pay cash for an item, they either round it up or down, ie: item costs 9.98, you would pay 10.00.<br>  In Australia, it is quite common to see cars parked on residential lawns, you don’t see that much in the US and if you do, it is in the deep south.<br>  In Australia, the paper size is called A4 which is slightly longer than America’s 8 ? by 11 inch size.<br>  Australia uses the metric system, American only uses metric in healthcare/science industries.<br>  When you have a baby in Australia, the government gives you a check for $3000.00.

In country areas near me shops are open till 5.30pm and 9pm on Thursdays. The city is open much later too, most shops closing between 7pm and 9pm. Some supermarkets and fast food places are 24/7.<br>  <br>  - Australians suffer from "Tall Poppy Syndrome" which means they put down people who are successful. This syndrome does not exist in the US.<br>  Heresay, never seen it myself. <br>  <br>  - Australians consume more beer, chocolate and ice cream per capita than the Americans.<br>  Beer probably, the others not. And Australia is not the biggest consumer of beer either. .<br>  <br>  - In Australia when you go to a party, you bring your own beverages to drink (and in some cases, your own food), in America, your hosts ( who are having the party) supply all food and beverages.<br>  Depends on the party, highschool parties, 18th, etc.. yes you byo. But older parties and kids parties, etc the host supplies everything. <br>  <br>  - In Australia, they use military time, for example 1pm is 13:00. In America, only the government and healthcare facilities do that. <br>  It isn't common to use 24hour time, most Aussies use 12hour time.  <br>  <br>  - In America paper money is all the same size and the same colour. In Australia, paper money is a different size and colour for each denomination. Also, Australia has a one and two dollar coin. They also do not have pennies in Australia, so when you pay cash for an item, they either round it up or down, ie: item costs 9.98, you would pay 10.00.<br>  American money is a pain in the a-ss. You can so easily mix up the amounts, good to see they are finally adding some colour. We had 1 and 2 cent pieces up until maybe 10-15 years ago.<br>  <br>  - In Australia, it is quite common to see cars parked on residential lawns, you don’t see that much in the US and if you do, it is in the deep south.<br>  Not common where I live, maybe in Boganville. <br>  <br>  - When you have a baby in Australia, the government gives you a check for $3000.00. They certainly don’t do that in the USA.<br>  They actually keep changing this. It went up to $5,000 per child. Now they pay it in fortnightly increments over 6 months. Too many younger mothers were wasting it. It is well heard of as the plasma bonus, as in plasma TV. <br>  <br>  - They have different types of electrical voltage in each country and in Australia, before your electrical appliance will work, you need to flick a switch at the outlet.<br>  Correct but you can leave the switch on, it's just a safety switch for if there is nothing plugged in. <br>  <br>  - The toilet flushers are at the top of the toilets in Australia, they are on the side of the toilet in America.<br>  Correct, intresting to me though. In the US the toilets are 3/4 full of water, Australian toilets are only 1/8 full, no splashback. US toilets suck everything out, Aus toilets the water helps push it and it flows down.|`|DRaq0kz9aa	I have been to the US and loved it.

ipw5zYZYaa	As you said, there are many factors to consider.  Private language schools have different requirements than universities.  Different cities have different types of schools.  <br>  <br>  Most universities require a university degree before you can teach in China.  It does not have to be in English, but a degree is generally required.  There are many schools who say this isn't necessary, but most schools still require a degree. <br>  <br>  As to the person who says English teachers don't "work" . . . well, all I can say is that this person is the type who give English teachers a bad name in China.  My class schedule changes each semester and I have taught anywhere from 14 to 18 hours per week.  However, I also have office hours for two to four hours each week.  I show movies to my students outside the classroom.  I spend approximately 10 - 20 hours each week in preparation for my classes.  The content of the course determines the amount of preparation needed.  Even if the subject is the same for all classes (oral English), I still spend time carefully preparing for the classes. <br>  <br>  All this results in about a 40-hour workweek, but spread over a varying time table.  It's not a straight 8 - 5 job, but can be from 8 - 12 and then an evening activity.  <br>  <br>  My encouragement to you would be to put your energies into your senior year!  Do the best you can at your courses and THEN come to China!  That way, you can spend your spare time in getting to know people and getting to know the country.  <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|7BJ0YScwaa	Of course! English teachers don't really work.  They do something like 20hrs a week.
lN0GkKgaaa	Ok, do not buy clothes and give it out to them.<br>  That is the worse thing you can do. If you want to raise money give it to a charity or an organization over there. Example, the orphanges or the educational centers you will be visiting. That way it will be distributed correctly. If you buy clothes and take it over there to give out, that brings down money for the Kenyans who are selling the clothes in the markets. And if you run out of clothes it can be a terrible thing if another kid or person did not get any from you. <br>  <br>  So the safest thing to do it is to give the money to an organization there. And when you get there I'd switch it to Kenya Shillings. (the best way to do that is make sure your money is in $100 US dollar bills (if your from the USA).

I think not.. Those 5.2 billion will go to the Fatah people and they will spend it for themselves, and not for civilians of Gaza.. On the other hand, if those money were given to Hamas, it would be used for rebuiling Gaza.. And BTW, the tunnels are the source of life for the Palestinians. That is where food, medicine, clothes and other supplies comes into Gaza.

They call it Palestine and refuse to recognize Israel. They talk about peace the same way Hitler talked about peace. A piece of Poland. A piece of France. A piece of Eastern Europe.

The Muslims use the Koran, or the Qur'an. The Muslims are not interested in peaceful co-existence with the Jews. They want Israel dismantled and they want to kill all of the Jews, just like the Nazis wanted to do.

Sure, it might seem like it is, but if you dig a little you find a lot of dirt. If you can answer to Chomsky's arguments against Israel's actions then I'll grant you that Israel really is trying to establish peace.<br>  <br>  Other Jewish intellectuals that have argued against Israel's actions in the middle east include Zinn and Finkelstein. Finkelstein risked his job when he criticized Israel. That kind of censure is surely not what we want in a free society.<br>  <br>  The Jewish community doesn't present this monolithic face as a "pro anything that Israel does" community. I hope Israel figures out how to become a more egalitarian society, because that's its real existential threat. I also hope marginalized Israeli Arabs can learn to love Israel. And I hope we can build on the community and unique culture that's building in Israel and that everyone will learn to love and accept everyone else's culture.|`|s26apn70aa	The Question should be....<br>  Are the Israelis willing to put down their killing machines and shake hands with their neighbors (arabs) and together they sing the same song of PEACE????<br>  <br>  quoted from:<br>  <a href="http://www.jewwatch.com/jew-genocide-gentilehate.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.jewwatch.com/jew-genocide-gen...</a><br>  <br>  Great Reformer, Martin Luther, who in 1543 wrote in Von den J?den und Ihren L?gen :<br>  <br>  "Does not their Talmud say, and do not their rabbis write, that it is no sin to kill if a Jew kills a heathen (non-jews, goyims, gentiles), but it is a sin if he kills a brother in Israel? It is no sin if he does not keep his oath to a heathen. Therefore, to steal and rob, as they do with their usury, from a heathen is a divine service.

If the room does not have that (they usually do have a mini fridge, but it's most often for the mini bar, and is full), you're out of luck.  I think that hotel is not a suite-style with fridges/microwaves/toasters.  If it's not indicated on their site, ask them directly to be sure.<br>  <br>  There is a mall up the street, but no grocery store, I don't think. You might find small convenience stores, but that's about it.  That hotel is on the eastern end of downtown, not too much interesting around that area.

TPVvddHWaa	I am not bothered about the 10 points my friend. We all know the best answer gets that. It is rather childish even insulting, to add it to the question.<br>  <br>  You will find the cheapest thing to do for lunch is to go to a little shop, ask them for a small baguette type bread roll and to fill it with your choice of cheese or cooked meat. That is what the Spanish do.<br>  <br>  Otherwise find a tapas bar and get a drink and a tortilla. That is a potato omelet. Each bar has their speciality, some will do a home made soup or pasta dish for workers who call in regularly for the mid day meal. Often this is between 2pm and 4pm. Workers will take all this time and play games like dominoes in a bar whilst they eat and drink. It is called Siesta and in some areas it is like a sacred time, they expect peace and quiet.<br>  <br>  Two Euros is the least you should budget for lunch but expect to pay as much as 10. More if you want a full meal in a good restaurant.<br>  <br>  A lot of supermarkets do spit roast chickens, you could get a half or quarter of a chicken, perhaps a piece of fruit or yogurt for desert.<br>  <br>  Bread does not keep long in Spain so it is bought fresh for each meal. Some bakeries do savoury pastries. There are usually benches to sit on to enjoy a pic nic. <br>  <br>  Valencia is a large area, some is for tourists and the prices are higher than they are in the areas where the locals live. But in the tourist areas they do speak English. There will be a McDonald's somewhere for you too. Expect to pay the same as you would at home to eat there.|`|4PcxcCVPaa	When you get there poke around the neighborhood and find a tapas bar.  The food there can be very very inexpensive and a great variety.  Also, you might consider buying some oranges and shelled nuts.  With a bottle of water you'll be filled easily and do your body a favor.  That will cost very little.<br>  <br>  A tapas bar (counter) will always be less expensive than a sit-down restaurant.  And there's no expectation of a tip in the bar.|`|pS4e5OtZaa	You can figure 5 euros for a regular lunch. You can do it for less if you go to a grocery store and purchase your drinks in bulk (that's if your host will let you store them somewhere).<br>  <br>  Of course you can spend more, but spending less consistently would get boring.|`|tQsxsuNPaa	You should figure about 10€ a day, if you are planning to eat out, but you can do much better if you go to the grocery store or the market and buy food, there. <br>  <br>  <br>  Of course it's cheaper to go to the market!  You aren't being served, and no one is cooking for you...

cWuumdy7aa	India's coast is 7,517 kilometers (4,671 mi) long; of this distance, 5,423 kilometers (3,370 mi) belong to peninsular India, and 2,094 kilometers (1,301 mi) to the Andaman, Nicobar, and Lakshadweep Islands. According to the Indian naval hydrographic charts, the mainland coast consists of the following: 43% sandy beaches, 11% rocky coast including cliffs, and 46% mudflats or marshy coast.<br>  <br>   <br>  Tso Kiagar Lake at Ladakh on the HimalayasMajor Himalayan-origin rivers that substantially flow through India include the Ganges and the Brahmaputra, both of which drain into the Bay of Bengal. Important tributaries of the Ganges include the Yamuna and the Kosi, whose extremely low gradient causes disastrous floods every year. Major peninsular rivers whose steeper gradients prevent their waters from flooding include the Godavari, the Mahanadi, the Kaveri, and the Krishna, which also drain into the Bay of Bengal; and the Narmada and the Tapti, which drain into the Arabian Sea. Among notable coastal features of India are the marshy Rann of Kutch in western India, and the alluvial Sundarbans delta, which India shares with Bangladesh.[80] India has two archipelagos: the Lakshadweep, coral atolls off India's south-western coast; and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, a volcanic chain in the Andaman Sea.<br>  <br>  India's climate is strongly influenced by the Himalayas and the Thar Desert, both of which drive the monsoons. The Himalayas prevent cold Central Asian katabatic winds from blowing in, keeping the bulk of the Indian subcontinent warmer than most locations at similar latitudes The Thar Desert plays a crucial role in attracting the moisture-laden southwest summer monsoon winds that, between June and October, provide the majority of India's rainfall Four major climatic groupings predominate in India: tropical wet, tropical dry, subtropical humid, and montane.|`|41519dcd613e198147ae134a0f6e6e78aa	Refer to Survey of India Atlas.|`|7h9UOsrgaa	................Lame
8aSADDVjaa	It means younger sibling..<br>  And if you add a "yeo" in front of it, it means a younger female sibling.<br>  If you add a "nam" in front of it, it means a younger male sibling.<br>  But Koreans don't always use it to mean "sibling." They could just be close friends of even strangers..so technically it just means someone younger than you..<br>  Hyung means older brother- only males use this term.<br>  Oppa means older brother, except only females use this term.<br>  Noona means older sister and again, males use this term.<br>  Unnie means older sister and only females use it.<br>  It can get confusing..lol<br>  Oh and same goes for this, they don't have to be related to call each other that.. just as long as the age fits, you can pretty much call anyone those - not just siblings. :D|`|m7MFMRXlaa	true, ?? (dong-saeng) is used for talking to/about your younger sibling, but it can ALSO be used to address someone younger than you that is a VERY close friend to you. <br>  <br>  For example, if your close friend's name is ga-eul (??), and she is younger than you, then you can probably call her ga-eul dong-saeng (????)<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!~|`|2b97e016ad66437b36147f9acd28a75baa	Correction: "dong seng" or "dong saeng" depending on which Romanization system you prefer to use.<br>  <br>  It's a word that refers to a younger sibling.<br>  A younger brother or a younger sister would be your "dong seng".|`|UI9kLlYjaa	?? (also pronounced dong-seng) - younger sibling|`|4PWkysgeaa	it means younger sibling.|`|xnTC73cXaa	its what an older sibling calls their younger sibling,,, spelled like "??" ^^|`|CCChS7ydaa	?? means younger sibling.<br>  it doesn't have to be used necessarily meaning a sibling it can be used to indicate a younger child

tQsxsuNPaa	Why is German the national language of Switzerland? <br>  <br>  Why is Chinese the national language of China?<br>  <br>  Why is Hindi the national language of India?|`|rVUvopaLaa	yeah right Filipino the national language but if you check the Philippine alphabet the letter "F" is nowhere.  <br>  <br>  in spelling alone things are confusing and strange in the Philippines what more in much large issues?  <br>  <br>  to answer the question, the business development started in Manila where trade and commerce to the outside world emanate from there.  many historical events also happened in Manila.  education and infrastructures flourished.  until politicians decided to make Tagalog/Pilipino/Filipino or whatever you call it becomes the national language.  <br>  <br>  i'm a Cebuano speaking i just wish however that when Magellan came trade and commerce could have started and civilization expands in the Visayas.  but it didn't happened unfortunately.  though the oldest university is in Cebu and the oldest church is in Bohol.  <br>  <br>  g'day|`|S2Wp2Vjsaa	The change in attitude towards Filipino and calling it Tagalog will not simply disappear.<br>  But the time will come especially when those non-Tagalogs themselves lose the inhibitions to use Filipino so that they will contribute words that will become part of the national language.<br>  If this happens, perhaps, calling the national language of the Philippines as Tagalog will then be forgotten.|`|4b644d3e9fa1328649e31b2870d579ccaa	Wikang Pilipino is the Philippines' National Language as declared by the Ama ng Wika, Pangulong Manuel Luis Quezon during the Commonwealth Regime.<br>  But Filipino becomes the National Language wherein if you will spell out university  in Filipino, it is spelled out as unibersidad unlike in Tagalog, it is Pamantasan.|`|AtjlmByAaa	Because Manila is the capital of the Philippines, and Manila becomes the heart of Trade and Industry.  It so happens that Manila is in Tagalog speaking region.|`|alN2JxuUaa	Filipino, not tagalog is the national language of the Philippines.<br>  <br>  These two are different.|`|Wgk5Q8Jbaa	Tagalog isn't the national language. Filipino is & it is based on Tagalog & borrows words from other common languages such as English, Spanish, Chinese, Arabic, German etc.<br>  <br>  The reason it is the basis for the national language is because it is the language of the capital & most people around the Philippines know it. It hasn't got the largest native speaking contingent but it has the largest overall speaking contingent.|`|AA11493831	Yes, that is true. But people in Visayas, Mindanao and Palawan can speak tagalog too. Not everyone though, but most of them can and they do speak tagalog. Because there are over 80 dialects here in the Philippines, tagalog became the universal language because almost every Filipino can speak in Tagalog or fluent in tagalog. The Filipino (Tagalog) subject is a part of the curriculum at schools and colleges.|`|AA10278041	Tagalog is not the national language of the Philippines, currently anyway. Filipino is the official one, alongside English.<br>  <br>  Filipino is based on Tagalog (as you know) since Tagalog is a lingua franca, like how Mandarin is in China.|`|QkIJEG1Gaa	sa totoo lang eh taglish na ang salita ng mga pilipino, nakakahiya nga dahil hindi sila marunong magsalita ng purong tagalog o purong ingles, makikita mo na lang sa telebisyon, una magi- ingles pero sa ending eh itatagalog kase naubusan ng ingles, minsan masakit ang katotohanan at napakasensitibo ang mga pilipino, ayaw makinig sa napupuna ng iba, nauuna ang kayabangan|`|kSt1BI6vaa	Because that's the native language of the semi-dictator Manuel Quezon.|`|ZW10YjJFaa	filipino is the national language of the philippines.|`|rNyBkedoaa	because its awesome and cool like ice!!!|`|JGJKWpuvaa	Last time I heard it's FILIPINO.

I think from a student point of view, the best school is one where your friends are going to school with you. If you participate in school activities you will find that you like the school more than if you didn't.|`|QDP59FJ3aa	Ok if you want to live it up why dont you go to Christian Brothers H.S its a private school but ofcourse you have to have the money. South Sacramento doesnt really have good HS's. Theres also Genisis HS i heard its pretty good and strict there.

PSiNv7gUaa	I'm heard that Triple A offers discounted Disney tickets to its members, but I'm not a member so I've never tried that.  The only other legitimate way I know of to get discounted Disney tickets is to attend a timeshare presentation, which I don't like because it takes time away from vacation.<br>  <br>  Sea World and Universal offer discounted tickets on their websites if you purchase an e-Ticket and either print it at home, or pick it up electronically at the park (electronic pick-up is not available at Sea World).  Their ticket deals are fantastic.<br>  <br>  Jenn E is right about the food, bringing your own snacks will save you money.  Also, staying in a condo with a full kitchen will help you save, as you can get a few groceries and cook your own meals, then you won't need to be eating at parks and restaurants constantly and will save money.  I stayed at WorldQuest Resort last year, their condos have full kitchens, and they are very reasonably priced (between 140-160 a night, depending on time of travel).  Also, they are only a mile from Disney World, and about 15-20 minutes from Sea World and Universal.|`|VELnLnIKaa	shop online there are always deals|`|Il0QA1Hcaa	Seaworld and Universal have best deals for there tickets. Disney tickets you can check out the following sites, sometimes they offer cheaper deals. They are all authorized dealers of Disney tickets, just don't buy any at the small shops in Orlando|`|x9RDPwIZaa	AAA sells Disney tickets for a *slight* discount.  It isn't much of a discount either.  Check with your HR department at work and see if they are Tickets at Work members, sometimes they have tickets up to 20% off or great buy x days and get x days free deals.  Other excellent, legitimate sources are Maple Leaf Tickets and Undercover Tourist (especially if you subscribe to the Mouse Savers newsletter).<br>  <br>  Universal and Sea World always have good deals online.  You can also check out Entertainment Books for good deals.  Again, Mouse Savers will have discounts to buy one for the Orlando area, but those theme parks often are in all areas theme parks.  Also check out the official convention bureau for discounts on various Orlando attraction tickets.|`|JLayHNZCaa	tripadvisor.com a free site has links to lots of money saving sites and tips and hints on how to save money on vacation.  Type Orlando into the search box and check out the forum for real people who can give you their best tips.|`|qDrctkHSaa	There is really not a lot of ways you can save money on Disney tickets. Beware from buying them online. If you want to save money do it on food instead. Bring your own sandwiches snacks and drinks.
