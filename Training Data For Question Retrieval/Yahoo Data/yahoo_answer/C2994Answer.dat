Doesn't sound like much until you realise how delicate the balance of our ecosystem is. SMALL changes can end up being devastating...<br>  One way to look at it; Imagine 1 ton of steel on each side of a set of scales with furry animals underneath. Place ONE PEBBLE on one side. Not much change but disastrous results.
0Ek3IplYaa	the fuel cell basically is a controlled reaction between oxygen and hydrogen. when the hydrogen is depleted, the electricity production is also stopped. lots of people also believe that hydrogen fuel cell is a clean but they are actually mistaken. how was the hydrogen isolated in the first place? it can take massive amounts of energy to get the hydrogen and it might not always be the cleanest of energy sources.|`|U9bQgfY9aa	Yes they can if we can find unlimited hydrogen. However, hydrogen does not exist by itself and has to be produces with either natural gas or with water and large amounts of electricity.    And fuel cells are so expensive because ot work they need a catalyst made from platinum.|`|WewCtMpzaa	Your question violates the First Law of Thermodynamics. Nothing is unlimited. Nothing is created or destroyed. Just converted, at a price or expense. Never free...    http://www.physicalgeography.net/fundame...|`|4e1nRQCUaa	of course not.  No more than a light bulb produces unlimited light.  a fuel cell has a max power rating and a lifetime, and it only works if it is hooked up to the right chemical feedstocks, usually hydrogen and air.  A simple design based on platinum is still pretty expensive.|`|npBCankMaa	not unlimited    Heat, electricity and water    NO, they cannot replace it all, but some    The fuel cell is not a prototype, we have been using them for 50 years.  They are made from rare metals and have very expensive tooling and tolerances.|`|20f3291b9320a302e9070bf55325531daa	No, it's not true.    Fuel cells require a source of hydrogen.  The first problem with fuel cells is that 96% of our hydrogen currently comes from fossil fuels.  So while it's true that the fuel cell cars themselves only emit water vapor, in order to get the hydrogen in the first place, you're still using fossil fuels.    Secondly, they only produce as much energy as the fuel you're inputting can make.  If you have an unlimited amount of hydrogen then sure, but again, most of our hydrogen comes from fossil fuels.    Also, the reason fuel cell cars are so expensive is that fuel cells currently require platinum, a very expensive metal.    See the link below for more info.|`|SYZQZGesaa	Fuel cells convert about 35% of the energy in hydrogen to electricity.    The only by products are heat and water.    Because of the materials they are made from, their inefficiency, zero tolerance for polluted water and short usable life, they are not a viable option to replace the ICE.    Simple in design and concept but expensive based on their materials and there is no substitute.|`|dpRQeob8aa	Yes, although if the supply of Hydrogen and Oxygen run out, the Fuel Cell will cease to work.    The by-product is heat and water, because Hydrogen+Oxygen=Water, H2O    It may be able to replace the internal combustion engine, provided it gets much more reliable.    They are so expensive because right now they are in the concept stage. Right now, they are somewhat unreliable, and refilling them is a painstakingly long process. Also, replacing all the gas pumps with hydrogen-pumps would cost upwords of $2,000,000,000.|`|AOrpzha0aa	You can't get unlimited electricity from them. You have to put energy 'in' to the system to get hydrogen in the first place. Either by splitting water, or splitting natural gas.    This isn't 100% efficient, so you need more electricity than you get out.      Hydrogen fuel cells are kind of like batteries: they're just a way to store energy.    The reason why this is useful is because it means you can use more wind & solar power: sometimes it's really windy or sunny when you don't need the electricity. If you can find a way of storing it for later use though, this is good.    It's also useful because they can store a lot of potential energy, so you can put them in cars and the cars will be able to run for hundreds of miles on a single charge - and you need that sort of range to sell cars! Cars are already very inefficient (only 18-30% of the energy from burning petrol gets turned into moving the car...), so this might be more efficient. It also means you can power cars on electricity which can be made clean by using nuclear or renewable power, or capturing the pollution at a fossil fuel power station (which might be possible. You can't capture the CO2 out of a car exhaust because we don't have cost efficient tech to do it with!)|`|L4L0wSZYaa	I'd like to ask why you wasted your time doing that...|`|dffc96e78e1d9103a9ba29153ea6202aaa	No. They do eventually wear out like everything else. If that is the meaning of your question. The platinum catalyst, (which is the most prevalent and efficient) and the cells components lose their effectiveness with use.  Yes, the only by product is heat and water.  Yes, they will replace the combustion engine and make batteries obsolete as well. Research into using other metals by reducing them to nano size to increase efficiency is in its final phases.  And yes, the design is simple, but precision is the key to making a fuel cell reliable and efficient requiring complicated construction techniques. The cost of the platinum catalyst is also a factor. But hopefully, with the advent of nanometals, it will bring the cost of production down to a reasonable level for mass production. And no, I have no ties or relation to Quantumsphere.
9ffe20cb9dcca74567265a38cc00ad1aaa	Is it happening?  If you believe in thermometers then yes.  what is causing it?  Nearly all mainstream scientist agree that the global warming we are experiencing now is caused by an increase the 'greenhouse effect'.    What is the greenhouse effect?  Greenhouse gases, mainly carbon dioxide, trap more of the suns heat in our atmosphere that other gases do.  Without the greenhouse effect the earth would be too cold for life as we know it.    Why is the greenhouse effect increasing?  Again most mainstream scientist agree that the greenhouse effect is increasing because for several hundred years man has been burning fossil fuels which releases more carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.    The direct and obvious approach to help reduce global warming is to use fewer fossil fuels.  Some people have suggested less direct, and more creative ways to counteract the increased warming effect.    If you believe that thermometers work than it is not global cooling.|`|Pfn9d7rGaa	Paper Summary:    This paper looks at how global warming is an issue that is often discussed as if it is a certainty, with considerable concern created about what will happen to the planet if continued global warming is not prevented. It considers whether global warming is a real problem by describing the nature of it including the role the greenhouse effect plays. It is followed by a consideration of some of the arguments made against global warming. By describing the nature of global warming, the role of the greenhouse effect and the arguments against it,the author makes an informed decision about whether or not global warming is an issue of concern.    http://www.academon.com/lib/paper/28516....|`|9dzkbt5yaa	zzzzzzxxxxxxxxxxxx|`|fI64PQIWaa	Try these:  NASA and JPL  http://climate.jpl.nasa.gov/     Yale University  http://earth.geology.yale.edu/~sherwood/...

There are also other things causing it like coal burning factories, etc. Polar animals cannot hunt because the ice they walk on is melting. Mother seals are abandoning pups because their pups must be born on ice. Believe it or not, fish like the cold water. I hope you ace the thing!
