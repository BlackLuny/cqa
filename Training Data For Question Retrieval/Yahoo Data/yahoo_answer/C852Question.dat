Jedes EU-Land soll ja einen stetigen Wirtschaftswachstum von 3 % haben, was D bis jetzt noch nicht geschafft hat. Aber wie soll das m?glich sein? Die Wirtschaft kann doch nicht immer weiterwachsen.

Die Einen sind am meckern, es sei zu wenig, die Anderen beschweren sich, dass die Empf?nger alles Schmarotzer sind. Fakt ist Hartz IV erfüllt seinen Sinn nicht. Das Geld sollte ursprünglich dazu dienen die Menschen vor dem sozialen Abstieg zu schützen. Mittlerweile steigt man aber gerade dadurch ab, dass man Hartz IV Empf?nger ist.      Sollte man es also abschaffen um den Steuerzahler zu beruhigen (obwohl ich mich frage was daran beruhigend sein soll zu wissen dass man direkt auf der Stra?e landet wenn man seinen Job verliert), oder sollte man den Satz erh?hen, damit man nicht mehr als assozial eingestuft wird?

20090205135953AA2oAtX	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment;Law & Legal	LAWYERS/LAW STUDENTS HELP!!!  IS THIS A SCAM??	Okay so there was an ad posted on craigslist with some DAD living in Scotland and he wants to send his SON to America for vacation.        Thing is, he doesnt include the Address or City of where the KID will be staying.  Well, I'm really low on cash and I reply to the ad, kinda not noticing that he hadnt included a City.  So the DAD sends me emails asking how much I'll charge and stuff.  I keep sending emails back with info too.  Then he tells me that he's gonna send me a check that I have to split up with my tutoring fees and wire the rest to the KID's nanny.        So this morning I get this UPS package with a check of $3490.00 and I'm like wtf is this cause I don't recognize any names on it.  I almost thought it was just some junk mail but keep it cause i kept wondering why junk mailers would use UPS express Extremely Urgent mail.        So I get online and I see his new email and it says that the Nanny is at XXXX address and her name is Stacey.  But whats weird is the name on the package that says where the shipment is from is some guy named Ben with the SAME ADDRESS as Stacey (not same last names tho).  I look at the check and it says "Diamond Comp Distributors, Inc."  with some guy named Jesse's signature.  I think that might be the Bank's Money Transfer guys name but I'm not sure.  Theres nothing else in the package except the check.        I sent the DAD an email back asking for the 3rd time which City he wants the tutoring service.  And I also asked for the Nanny's phone number since she's the one thats gonna drop the KID off at my house or wherever.  Also, the DAD never included his or any other phone numbers so I had no way of contacting him besides email.        So I'm wondering if this is a scam or if i should i just keep the cash.  Honestly, I really wanna keep the cash and see what happens just for the hell of it.  lol. But I dont want it to bite me in the *** and maybe ruin my credit or whatever.        ANY SUGGESTIONS OR ADVICE???

20090205113850AAoW2Bt	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment;Law & Legal	Is this Wrongful Termination?	My sister just got fired yesterday.  She worked for Corporate and left them to work for one of their franchise.  Yesterday she received an email saying she has not been following protocol and has been contacting corporate people directly.  I read the email and it looks like another manager asked for advice on how to get a procedure done quickly by corporate and she suggested a few names.  In addition, the email said that she's been talked about this already.  She emailed her boss that morning.  He pulled her into a room and said that his life/money was on the line so he has to disassociate himself from her.  He could not give her a reason.  She told him she had never been spoken about not following protocol.  Later she spoke to a friend from corporate and there had been rumors saying she was incompetent.  The owner of the corporation received that email complaint about my sister that same morning and personally called the owner of the franchise ordering him to fire her.  In addition, a mass email was sent to everyone in Corporate that my sister was terminated and that no one was to speak to her.  It's standard procedure to send a mass email out like this after someone gets fired in this Corporation.  The thing is my sister is very competent--I think she had personality conflict with one/more people.  She was the trainer for all new Franchise owners.      Her boss promised her health care when he hired her on and she's been with him for 6 months w/o healthcare.  He keeps on promising her only.  Added to all this, she's pregnant and he knows it too.  She moved to whole different state to work for him.  Does she have a case against corporate and her boss?  What should she do now?  I'm not sure how she's supposed to deal with unemployment, etc.  She's in AZ, and now she's coming home back to CA. Corporate is in CA and the franchise is in AZ.  Someone please give me some good advice.  Thanks!!!!

20090205124335AAsIjcd	Business & Finance;Taxes;Other - Taxes	Refiling tax returns?	I just had my 08 taxes prepared.  I noticed  the Schedule C income was different than what I had anticipated.   When going over the return in detail, it seems to me that the difference is due to the change in what % I work my business from home  (I consult for small businesses and occassionally I work from my home office, their home office, their business offices, etc).      This difference in % changed the income which changes the numbers throughout the entire return, including the potential tax due/refund.    I checked out 07 and the same thing happened there.  It appears that for some reason the % of  how often I work my business from home was changed in 07.  Unfortunately I didnt review last years 07 returns in detail (due to certain factors) and I signed off on them as is - unaware of  the new % number.    The gentleman who does my taxes is a friend of the family, but I pay him for his services.  I would like to bring it to his attention and ask why % worked from home changed without getting my approval (of course as I mentioned ultimately I approved of this by signing off on the return - but that was with the assumption that nothing from the previous year had changed.).      Can I refile last years taxes although I have signed off on them?     Any suggestions on the appropriate way to handle this business/personal matter?  I haven't paid him yet for this years returns.
20090205125037AAgJWv7	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment;Law & Legal	Question regarding abuse and employment rights?	I have a question about my rights as an employee. As everyone already knows, we are in a job crisis right now. Unemployment is at an all time high., especially in my area. So I need advice on how to proceed here. I work for a company whom is contracted to install certain components on buses. I am the quality control inspector for our company. The company we install these components for did not wire up the controls properly which is their responsibility. Well I noted the issue on their order form and the bus came back around. Their electrician put the control panel back together without fixing their problem. I informed their line manager about the issue. Again, the issue was not corrected. My boss was out of the building. Their inspector tried telling our next in command that it was not their responsibility and it was ours. So I explained to our second in command that it was not our responsibility but theirs. I even double checked this with out electrician.    So both me and the second in command went to their electrician to inform him that it wasn’t our responsibility, we do not wire those components. Their electrician got argumentive and abusive and said we install the components and they do not and got loud and told me I need to go back and learn how to do my job. This isn’t the frist time he has been this way towards me or others. He has a very bad history of exploding like he did. I have seen him almost get in a few fights with his own coworkers.    Tomorrow we are going to explain to my bos the situation. The problem is my boss has a bad habit of not listening and blaming the wrong person and allowing it to continue to happen. I am at my limit with this issue and my bosses failure to correct the issue.    I have a feeling my boss will try saying it is our issue and make me correct their issue just so he does not have to deal with it making me look in the wrong and allowing this person to continue is abusive attitude towards me. Again this will enforce the idea to their electrician he can continue his abuse towards me and allow the situation to progress even worse. I plan on refusing to not do their job anymore. They know they can just keep pawning their responsibility off on me because the way my boss is. I assume my boss will probably write me up for insubordination or something. If this happens, I plan on taking a stand and telling my boss how I eel and I am not going to be abused like this anymore and quitting then and their if it comes down to that.    Can my boss allow their employees to be verbally abusive towards me? What protections and or legal options do I have? And how would this affect collecting unemployment? We recently went from a 5 day work week to a 4 day work week. I was promised to get my 40 hours a week which my boss is also reneging on. Also, I was promised a large raise for the last two raises and both times I didn’t get them and my boss blames it on someone else for it.    Also the last inspector did not have to do nearly as many buses as I do, amount of things to check, or any repairs. She was a female.

I entered the amount for my taxes (I'm using TurboTax) and I don't kno what to put for 'cost or basis'. I don't even kno what that means. I called the bank, and they told me to ask my grandparents, but they have both passed away. Then he said to google it. I tried, but I'm not finding anything that is helping me.      If you kno of a website that can help, or you kno how to figure the amount or whatever, I would really appreciate it!      The amount on the form they sent in the mail was $1560.04. But I think the actual amount I received was over $1900.      Thanks in advance for any help/advice!

I am a senior in high school and I'm trying to figure out what to do next year. I want to go to college. I have always done well in school and on standardized tests, and my mom thinks that because of this, I should go into a "smart person" profession with some level of prestige... like a psychologist, something in business, etc. But what I really want to do is be a veterinary technician. I'm afraid to tell my mom this because I'm scared she'll look down on that choice (no offense to any vet techs) because it doesn't require much schooling (just an associate's degree) and doesn't make much money (around $26k a year). I feel like she would see it as a "second class" career. I want to do something I love, but I don't want my mom to look down on me. How can I get up the courage to tell her what I want to do and help her understand that it's the best thing for me?

My boyfriend at the time got a divorce and his ex put a judgment on him for money he owed her in the divorce.        Later I bought a house with that same boyfriend and his ex-wife put a lien on it because of the judgement.  I didn't know the lien was put on.  Later, my boyfriend and I split up and since he had never worked or paid anything on the house, he quit claimed the house to me and we split up and never saw each other again.        Now I've been paying on this house, my name is on the deed alone but his name is still on the financing because I couldn't get refinancing.      I put the house up for sale and the title company has found this lien.  This is the first I've heard of it.  Now I can't sell the house because the amount of the lien is more than what I will make on the house.  The lien was for my ex not me.

She is always under alot of stress and never gets to hang out with anyone or do anything because of all the work and studying she has to do. Her fiance proposed to her not too long ago which has put more stress on her. (She didnt know that would happen, the way it has at least) Her fiance is a spoiled only child and his mom wants him to get married so bad. Even though his mom wants that my friend is thinking of waiting to marry him in the next four years because of all the classes and work she has to take, but his mom went and paid for some places already without asking and they are non-refundable. Do you think she should just get married to shut his mom up or put her career first? I think her career as a doctor is more important.

Place of Business:   Music store in local mall.      Manager is Heterosexual male in late thirties/early forties.   Daughter is assistant manager and is 21      I called my daughter today at work and the manager picked up the phone and told me that she was up front with a customer. He proceeded with some small talk and then my daughter got on the phone...the following is what was said after my daughter picked up the phone:      "Hey what are you talking to my momma about?"      "Shut up beitch its none of your business."      "Hey don't call me that"      "Well if you wouldn't act like one I wouldn't call you one. "      he hangs up.       Daughter gets a customer and can't talk.       I am sitting here waiting for a call back from her...but I am in shock.

I know she is going to tell me he was just playing around but...I didn't like it at all.

The rent is due on the 5th and we deposited this afternoon to the landlords account however the landlord called me this morning saying she didnt see the money on the account yet .. that was at 8:30 am then she called me at 2:00pm saying she still did not see the money on her online banking.. and was upset because her account was going to be overdrafted because her mortgage is apparently due on the 5th too, so shes relying on our money to be in her account by the 5th or before the 5th.. and began threatning that she will begin to charge late fees if we dont pay on time... BUT I told her that today is the 5th and the day is not over for her to be yelling at me and threatning me to pay on time.. and that its not my problem that her account will be overdrafted and that her mortgage will be late.. and she told me that she had the power and right to say today you will pay me rent and you have to comply...

20090205114605AALi670	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	Did loan officer try to rip me off?	Ok, so I planned on refinancing with the same person who originally gave me the loan for my house. She "claimed" she got me a 5% FHA loan and estimated 3-5K (depending on where we appraised) for closing. The next day she jumped us into a 5% VA loan. When all was said and done, our loan would be jumping from 218 to 228 almost 229. She didn't offer to let us pay our funding fee, which ended up being 2K more than originally quoted. We had the cash to put money down, but she worked it to roll it all into the laon and then claimed we were only paying $556 in closing costs. I looked at the almost 11K that got rolled into the loan as closing costs. We'd move from a 40 year fixed to a 30 year fixed and save $250 per month. I stopped the loan process as soon as I saw the GFE and loan packet. She is angry and said that she gave us a great deal, while I feel she tried to rip us off. I understand saving $250/month, but we'd be going upside down on our loan (appraised at 224 now owe almost 229) and owing almost 11K more than we do now. Am I right to think she's absolutely crazy? I have no problem making my current payments, I only wanted a 30 year and better interest rate than I currently have which is 6.8, but didn't feel owing so much more than the house is worth is wise in this market.       Thanks for your input!

Crashed into someone ter a about a month ago.....it was his fault and i made a claim against his insurance for damages...they send out an assesor to inspect my car and he declared the car as a right off!....So they valued the car at 3000.....About a week later i get a letter from them stating that they will pay 3000 to me onced i they recieve the log book i.e. vehicle registration ownership.....I send out the log book and get no reply!!...I ring them saying whats the problem and they say "we cant pay the money until we find out who was driving car that caused the accident"....They say there still investigating to whom was driving the car..............I then get a letter in the post stating that they have concluded investigations and unfortunitely they could not establish who was driving the car...in other words we are not paying you the 3000 because we are not sure that it was our insured driver who who was driving the car (but that the CAR was definetly insured)!!!......Now they actually are the legal owners of the car without paying me anything as i have signed over ownership to them thinking that i was getting the 3000 they had informed me of!!!!       Were do i stand and how do i go about getting the 3000 when by law it is the CAR that was insured and not the person driving the car.... therefore it should not matter who was driving the car.... i thought that once the car was insured... and it is proven that it was that car that caused the accident they should have to pay out?? thats my view on things       Please tell me what to do and whether or not i have a strong case if i was to make this a legal matter?       Oh and i have a witness who seen the crash and has already been in contact with his insurance to prove i was not liable for the accident and that he was!!!          Thank you

20090205115935AA2D9f0	Business & Finance;Credit	$15,000 tax Credit Details.?	I have done a lot of research on the proposed $15,000 tax credit and feel I have a pretty good grasp on the details. It's for all homebuyers, not just first-time. It is not required to be paid back. You must stay in the home for at least 2 years, and it must be the primary residence. Here is my question: If we have an accepted contract on a house and we are supposed to close 2/27/2009, can we file that on our 2008 tax return? I saw on a website that you can choose to file in '08 or '09,  but I didn't know if that was contingent upon the closing date of the home. Also, if my taxes have been withheld, and I don't owe anything (or much) for my 2008 tax return, will I get a check for the difference? The answers to whether or not this credit is refundable have been hazy. Ideally, we would close at the end of February, file for the credit in 2008, and receive the refund to help with housing costs this year. Am I wrong? Any answers will help. Thanks!

I am a little disheartened becasue I am looking for more of a corporate-office type marketing position at an agency or corporate office. My question is...are job fairs really just a waste of time, has anyone been successful?

20090205123020AAtpF0h	Business & Finance;Taxes;United States	Form 1040, Schedule A...question about state tax write-off?	On Line 5 of Schedule A (itemized deductions), you can write-off any state or local taxes.  From your W-2 form(s), you enter the total amount of state taxes that were withheld.  Then...whatever amount your state refund is...the next year you get a 1099-G form for that amount, and you have to record it as income.      For example:      State withholding = $1500   Actual tax liability = $1200   Refund = $300      Then, the next year, I'd get a 1099-G form in the amount of $300.      Okay...I GET all that.  But, what happens if you end up owing state taxes?        For example:      State withholding = $1500   Actual tax liability = $2000   Amount owed = $500      My question is, is there a way I can claim (or "write off") the $500 I had to pay in?  On my Schedule A, I would have only claimed $1500 from my W-2...yet, my tax liability was actually $2000...(which I did pay...$1500 in payroll deductions and $500 via a check to the IRS.)      It only seems fair that I would be able to claim the full $2000 liability.  In the first example, where you had excess withholdings, the IRS makes sure you claim the difference as profit (in the next year, via a 1099-G form.)      So again, I ask...(in the second example) is there a way for me to claim the extra $500 I had to pay in?      Thanks for reading.

I purchased an item which cost 600+ euros from an online trader based in France on 21st October.  It was delivered on 30th December to a neighbour's house (someone who lives down the street) - we were away on a trip for New Year and had not asked for it to be delivered elsewhere.        When we returned home we opened the item and it was damaged (not delivery damage but damage that clearly had been caused prior to packaging).      We emailed the company to advise them of this but they are refusing to allow us to return the item as it was 8 days after delivery when their terms are 7 days.      They are not at all interested that we emailed them the day that we returned or that they delivered it to someone else      Does anyone have any sensible guidance as to what action we can take.
