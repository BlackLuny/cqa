They are currently 5th in the premier league table and may miss out on the all important Champion's league places next season.Which could signal players such as Fabregas and Van Persie leaving in the summer transfer window. Their form has not been that of champions in any way and last weekends match was proof of that.   Any thoughts on where it went wrong for them and do you think the can still finish 4th??      I personally think they can but many disagree and think Villa will end 4th this season.

20090225070339AAnWRbc	Sports;Martial Arts	My weight training routine for  BJJ - is this good enough?	I started doing BJJ 6 times a week and hit the gym 3 times a week, every second day, but as you see, every second day I lift weights early afternoon and go to BJJ in the evening. Up till now (two weeks), I haven't experienced any pains or severe soreness (just enough to make me aware of it).      My routine is a full body one, where I do 8-9 exercises, heavy weight, low reps, for every part of the body, 2-3 sets. I focus more on compound exercises and nearly never use machines, but I still do some isolation work. I eat like pregnant mother and I sleep like a polar bear, for 7.5-9 hours a day. My only complaint is that recently my performance on the mat started to deteriorate (due to lack of concentration), but that's another matter.      I am now quite skinny, 170 lbs at 6'0''. By using this routine, will I be able to bulk up a little and get better at grappling?

20090202102018AAjfmWS	Sports;Wrestling	Who are the 10 pro wrestlers who have entertained you the most?	Geez...this was a tough list to make.      10. Disco Inferno. Probably the funniest wrestler not named Chris Jericho that WCW ever had. From the bell-bottom pants to forming the "Dancing Fools" with Alex Wright, Disco did not disappoint.      9. Santino Marella. "Of all the times", "Open a can of asswhip"..."you are a keep"....Santino's been held back from wrestling well (see his matches from OVW if you doubt his skills) but I'll gladly take his comic genius.      8. Steve Austin. Whether he was "Stunning", Drinking Beers and stunning Vince, or just kicking back and singing a Duet with The Rock, Stone Cold was entertaining.      7. Ric Flair. Just watch one of his promos from his NWA title runs in the 80s.       6. The Great Muta. I'm a Muta mark, so forgive the bias. This man regardless of opponent or match type was brilliant in the ring, never ceased to entertain.      5. Eddie Guererro. One of the funniest men to ever step foot in a wrestling ring. Would do almost anything to get a crowd reaction.       4. Chris Benoit/Billy Kidman/Juventud/Ultimo Dragon....This spot is for the WCW Cruiserweight Division. Thank you for the memories.      3. Kurt Angle. He can Battle Rap, He can wrestle, he can be funny, he can be intense. Kurt may have done a lot of things that I disagree with in his personal life and career,but he is one of the most entertaining wrestlers I've ever seen.      2. Chris Jericho. "The Moss Covered Three Legged Family Gredunzel"....gettling LOST in an Arena imitating Goldberg, Trading verbal jabs with The Great One, and bringing "Raw is Jericho" to WWF. Jericho is one of the most entertaining wrestlers I've ever seen.      1. The Rock. Just about every time he touched a microphone, the Rock did something, said something, or made fun of something to the point that I was laughing. The most entertaining person I've ever seen in wrestling.       Your thoughts?

20090225060330AAW1uMa	Sports;Football (American)	Does anyone right now in the NFL play the position of Linebacker better than Patrick Willis?	You can say Ray Lewis all you want.      To bad he is old now and is a good motivator. That's about it. Yeah he has a few big hits and knows the game. But he is getting old and cant tackle like he used to or catch faster guys      However WILLIS is the new #52. And he plays on a much worse defense. People have got to understand that Willis is putting up great stats with a BAD defense. Ray Lewis will always put up good numbers on a great defense. His front D-Line will create holes for lewis to enter and create trouble for the quarterback. Just like James Harrison. OF course he will be great because the rest of his defense is good. If you put harrison or lewis by themselves on the lions defense would they be good?

Before the tour started Harbhajan Singh said "India will win 5-0 in ODI's and 2-0 in T20's". While Sachin Tendulkar said "Indian team must be careful. It will be very hard to play in NZ".      Is this the difference between experienced players and young no fear players?      In the contect of this match -   1) Why did Yusuf Pathan go for 4'th six while he already had 3 in a over? (Remember that was the last recognized batting pair left at that time (irfan was of course still available)).      2) Ishant sharma bowls a lot of no-balls (which is Sin in cricket esp in T20's) .. why he can't practice by bowling short of crease?      3) Why did Rohit sharma / Yuvraj go for shots immediately instead of    supporting Raina who was more settled?

20090225054710AAamAXY	Sports;Cycling	Fixed Gear Bicycle For Cross-Training Purposes?	My running friends have suggested that I get a fixed-gear (single speed) bicycle for cross-training days (the days which I take a break from running).      They claim that a fixed-gear bicycle provides a great all-rounded workout for the legs. Since I haven't been riding for a long long time, I would get used to it much quicker than those who have been riding on freewheel bikes. I am looking for a bicycle anyway, just not sure of the type.      I am considering a purchase due to the following main reasons :      1. Cost (I am a student, so I don't have much $ to spare. An entry-level bike would be good)   2. Ease of maintenance.   3. Transportation purposes.   4. All-rounded leg workout (which they claim)      Would appreciate your advice! Thank you!

20090225051517AA4HkPZ	Sports;Boxing	Starting amateur boxing?	Hello! I am 23 and I am about to join the Royal Navy. When I pass basic training I want to get involved in boxing- I dabbled in it a little at school, but fell in with the wrong crowd and so I gave up after a month or so of training. However I really want to give it another shot once I'm done with training.      By the time I get started I'm likely to be 25- is this too old to start competing at amateur level? Also, I am 5'10" and 12 stone (170 lbs). Do I need to lose or gain weight, if at all?       Lastly, is there any place for hard punches or toe-to-toe fighting in amateur boxing? I seem to remember I had a leaning towards this over light footwork when I trained at school, but of course I may be a lot different now!      Thanks.

20090225061604AARApVC	Sports;Football (American)	Brett favre is not good, all of his "records" come from having a long healthy career. Do you agree?	All his records are in the "counting" stats meaning stats that add up over time.       ex. in baseball being the all time home run  leader compared to highest career batting average.      All his records are a side effect of his one real record his consecutive games         Yes he has 44 more tds than Marino but he has 1300 more passing attempts      Favre had 2 great years but that is it. If  he would have got hurt once none of his other records would have followed because once the streak was broken he would have missed more games for lesser injuries         *******There were only two years in his career where you could argue he was even maybe the best of that year but never at any time did he play like any of the true greats of all time. His stats may have passed them because of his number of games.      IF YOU HAD A GOOD TEAM WITH A FOUR YEAR WINDOW FAVRE WOULD NOT BE IN YOUR TOP 10 PICKS ALL TIME TO LEAD THAT TEAM.

You have to be in grades K-4 to be on this team. Team levels 5-6 train together for 16 hours a week. You have to be in grades 3-7 to be on this team. All of the optionals train together mostly, but 7s and 8s train for 22 hours and 9s and 10s train for 26 hours. To be in optionals, you have to be between grades 6-12. If you are too young but on the same level as a team, then you are in Junior category. There are 4 junior levels: novice, intermediate, advanced, and elite. Novice is for all ages below kindergarten and on levels 4+. Intermediate is for grades K-2 and on levels 5-6. Advanced is for grades K-5 on levels 7 and 8 (my sister is on this one). Elite is for grades K-5 and levels 9 and 10. If you are too old for your correct level, you are in the Senior category with the same methods of Novice, Intermediate, Advanced, and Elite. Novice is grades 5-12 on Pre-team, Intermediate is grades 5-8 on levels 4-6. Advanced grades 9-12 on levels 4-6.

Paul Pierce - Has come up big in the clutch countless times       4.) Kobe Bryant - Is clutch in the season {playoffs} not so much, he does not have much game winners. Takes over the game in the 4th that is what makes him clutch.       5.) Tim Duncan - Big man has come up huge in game winning situations       6.) Jamal Crawford - I am a Knicks fan that is the only time JC ever shot with a great FG% in game winning decisions.       7.) VC - Is a clutch player when he wants to be.    8.) Mike Bibby - Very clutch    9.) Derek Fisher - Pretty damn clutch   10.) Manu Ginobili - Excels in clutch too
20090203143414AA0eZGl	Sports;Basketball	Is  Reacquiring Marcus Camby, The Knicks Saving Grace?	To solidify a 6th - 8th seed this year we need to get better down low we are really thin. David Lee is great and is playing, like an All-star, but he gives up size on a constant basis nightly and it may not show offensively - but defensively it's a mismatch in our disadvanatge.      Marcus Camby = the most complete Center in the NBA bar none and the 3rd best overall after Yao and DH12. If we give the Clippers Nate and Q who are expiring contracts the Clippers may take advantage of in the future we can get Camby. Nate and Q have overstayed their welcomes.      Nate - especially last night showed the type of player he is. Yes, he is athletic and can score. But, his height causes much problems he can not defend, rebound, and is not a true PG/SG - so he can not pass. Also, he has a terrible FG% because he is a chucker and forces the action and he has a bad attitude as well and does not seem, like he will fix his shortcomings.      Q. Rich is just inconsistent and I am sick of it really. With Camby we get an All-star caliber player who is a great shot blocker and defender. 2 aspects we desperately need. He is also a premier rebounder and would beast it up w/ Lee and Harrington on the glass. Furthermore, he has an offensive game and is very athletic. He can put the ball on the floor, dunk, hit the mid range jumper, go to the line, pass, etc - all good on a Mike D system. He is also a veteran, so in 2 years when his contract expires we can sign him and Harrington to vet minimums where Camby can compliment Chris Bosh, 1 of the FA's we can obtain as a key reserve, like he was for Patrick Ewing back in the day.      Knicks after deadline:      PG. CHRIS DUHON   SG. WILSON CHANDLER   SF. AL HARRINGTON   PF. DAVID LEE   C. MARCUS CAMBY   6. Danilo Gallinari - Deserves more minutes, he is really something   7. Tim Thomas - For now, when his contract is up he is gone

Greg Oden over Marcus Camby-In my opinion Greg Oden is a better center,because he's better power dunker,more dominating player and better blocker and offensive rebounder.While Camby is a better defensive rebounder,shooter and inside scorer.   Al Jeferson over Andrew Bynum-Better shooter,inside scorer and more dominating player.

20090203142752AA9XEFa	Sports;Basketball	If kobe wins 3 more titles, will he be better than MJ??	To me i think kobe is great and i think he is the closest to jordan but i cant put him past mj in my opinion because he came straight from highschool, so he already had a 4 year head start to get more titles and score more points. . and during those 3 titles kobe was amazing, but he wasnt the best player on the team at the time (shaq) and the one time he was the best player on the greatest starting lineup ever (payton, malone,oneil, bryant, fox) he killed the team chemistry, when mike won titles HE won them whether it was single handedly scoring every point in the 4th quarter or assisting or shooting the last second shot to win the title MJ was indeed the most clutch player in history.      Kobe easily has a better shot than MJ and is probably just a little more athletic, but what does any of it mean without the Jordan ''drive'' that made him explode when it counted........thats just my opinion, what about yours??

20090203143210AAL0hAo	Sports;Outdoor Recreation;Hunting	Skinning a cold Raccoon?	I shot two huge boar 'coons last night.  Skinned one out and the thing was so covered in fat and all slippery that I wasn't ready to take on the task of skinning the second one until after getting some sleep.  After two showers, I still smell like 'coon today.   The other one has been out in my shop where it's been 30 degrees all day.  Any idea if he will be tougher to skin?  Any tips?  I know it's a lot easier to pull the hide off a squirrel when it's still warm,but have never tried skinning a cold 'coon.   Also, any tips on skinning out the tail without splitting the hide all the way up it?  I'm trying to psych myself up for this.  I am not letting them go to waste, but man, oh man, it's going to be hard to flesh out those hides with all that fat on them.  I think I'll have to grab a half pint of Wild Turkey on the way home.
20090203143530AA5kReL	Sports;Baseball	What is the issue with Joe Torre's book ?	He is without doubt one of the best Managers around.  He's won with the Yankees, gave them new life when they were down after the 1995 collapse to Seattle.  Now, Yankees fans are giving him the silent treatment.  This is why no one likes New York or their teams.  Fans must stay loyal, win or lose.  We were not with Joe 24X7 so we don't know what the relationship was between him, Cashman, the Steinbrenners and Levine and the mystery "baseball people."  Let's read the book then pass judgment.  And another thing, stop giving A-ROD a free pass.  A-ROD is overrated.  He cannot close the deal.  A-ROD and Boras just happened to sell Hicks and his Business partners a good sales pitch to get A-ROD that big contract.  Again, this is addressed to Yankees' fans, A-ROD is overrated.  Just ask the Mariners and Rangers.

And why when I refilled it with air did it go flat again? I think it was the cold weather that caused it to deflate but I'm not sure. I was really upset because I had the official NFL football and it costed me 93 bucks to buy it. I leave it in my house now. So does anyone know why this happened? Was it the cold weather or the ball itself? And why did it go flat again after I refilled it with air?

20090203135905AAdWHtu	Sports;Baseball	Is Phil Coke overrated?	Do you think the Yankees are getting ahead of themselves with young prospects that dont put up huge numbers but aren't getting bashed in the Majors? For example: Big fuss over Melky and the result was him going to the minors due to a horrible 2008 season. Phil Hughes as decent I'm not gonna lie but after he came back; he was just awful. Lastly, I always thought they WAY overrated Ian Kennedy. Another guy who didn't put up the most incredible numbers, he was just another young possibility. The Yankees just see rival teams like the Red Sox who brought up players like Pedroia, Youkilis, Ellsbury, Papelbon, Lester etc. and think they have to do it to. So, do you think they put too much spotlight on young prospects who have only played DECENT in the majors. I love Brett Gardner but in the back of my mind, the Yankees are gonna look silly again if they give him too much attention and then he turns out to be bogus.
20090203142340AAFfLkR	Sports;Winter Sports;Snow Skiing	School Ski Trip Nerves?	I am going with my school on a ski trip, and I am scared that I will embarrass myself in front of everyone, or get injured.       Everyone is expecting me to be a good skier, because I have been before, but I have forgotten everything. I am scared I will be rubbish on the first day, and be put in the bottom group. Then I will be bored the whole week learning from scratch!      Do you know any balance exercises or anything I could do to get fitter or more prepared. I am such a scaredy-cat, but I still want to have fun. Maybe if I felt more confidant about my ability I wouldn't panic so much.      Do you have any tips that I could use?      I don't want to dread my holiday, but it comes natural to me.      xoxo      Thank you

20090203142543AAjSrmW	Sports;Fantasy Sports	You have the first overall pick in your 2009 Fantasy Football draft.....who do you take?	I'm taking Peyton Manning.    Runningbacks typically go in that position but that position just seemed out of whack last year and considering how many sleepers and undraftees became top 10 performers (Turner, Forte, Chris Johnson, Thomas Jones, DeAngelo Williams, Steve Slaton) and many typical first rounders didn't work out so well (Tomlinson, Peterson, Addai, Gore, Moss, Owens, Holt), I'd be a lot more comfortable going with a proven QB stud and working the runningback and WR market later than sooner.    You? =o)
