That is the only place I can think of and I am from phoenix lived here my whole life

KpO4UtElaa	a pub is all about beer and wine instead of liquors and cocktails. they have better food selections at pubs. bars serve more mixed drinks and have more varieties of hard liquor, but they only have snacks usually, not good food for meals. a club usually has a bar,  and the focus is on dancing and meeting people. i would say a pub is the most fun of all, because i have been to some pubs with really good fish and chips and pubs are kindof like european and english and i love that type of thing. bars often gross me out and i'm married and hate pop music and don't care for booty dancing so a club is useless for me. a lot of times you have to be 21 to get into bars or especially clubs but pubs are more casual and may not have an age requirement.
33d13c8fa116273403e0f7b580bfabe3aa	Pub: small bar<br>  Bar: Primary service is selling alcohol<br>  Club: Primary service is music and a dance floor, secondary service is alcohol.<br>  <br>  Age requirement depends on the particular Pub, Bar, or Club. Some clubs have 15+ nights, 18+ nights, or 21+ nights depending on promotions. Some bars and pubs serve food so any age can go into them, however only persons over the age of 21 can consume alcohol.|`|AA10873763	A pub in the UK is a bar in the US.<br>  Add music and a dancefloor to either and you have a club.
