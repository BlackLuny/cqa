d621cb8d98b2f593f0a68c7f1d804163aa	Hola Jarocho:<br>  Pues aqui en Texas es un poco diferente, tienes que quejarte al Attorney General of Texas:( <a href="http://www.oag.state.tx.us/" rel="nofollow">http://www.oag.state.tx.us/</a> ) el Better Bussines Bureau ( <a href="http://www.bbbhou.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bbbhou.org/</a> ) o a una corte. No esperes que de la noche a la manana se resuelva el problema pero es mejor que no hacer nada. Espero que no les hayas dado un ss# y asi simplemente no les pagues hasta que se cansen de cobrar. Suerte.

ra86rsTSaa	Depends on the state you live in. In most state you have to be 15 1/2 in order to work. Check with your school for it. First (if you live in Cali, if not check with your school) you need to get a work permit. If you're under 15-18 you need a work permit. It basically says you'll keep good grades and if you don't you'll not be able to work. without one you can't work. Then you have to have a social security card and your birth certificate. Also in most states you can't get a job if you have D's or F's in school. OK anyways, now you have to type up a resume. Basically it's a paper that has your name, address, and phone number at the top of the paper, summary of skills, previous job experiences, etc. Google it. After that you need to get recommendations. Ask teachers or friends (any person who is over 18, not family, and has a good record) basically they are vouchers to say that you are a good person and reliable and they'll risk their name for you. The older the person is the better the recommendation letter will be. Then you need to look for a job. Take into consideration, you can only work part time, location, and hours. Look at malls, clothing stores, food services, grocery stores are pretty much the only places that hire teens. Wear something nice and an employee if they're hiring and if so can you please have an application. Fill out the application and turn it in, wait for a response.

Cuenta en PayPal: <a href="http://www.paypal.es/es" rel="nofollow">http://www.paypal.es/es</a> para que nos depositen el dinero, es gratis y no se necesita tarjeta de crédito ni cuenta bancaria. <br>  ? Tiempo, alrededor de 3 minutos por día para hacer click en las publicidades. <br>  ? Conseguir referidos para así realmente empezar a ganar dinero. <br>  Encima lo haces mientras revisas el correo o chateas!<br>  <br>  ?Cómo? <br>  <br>  1- Antes que nada, si no estás registrado en Paypal, debes hacerlo. Es muy fácil, nada más sigue las indicaciones y completa con sus datos. Es gratis y no se necesita tener tarjeta de crédito ni cuenta bancaria.<br>  <br>  2- Debes registrarse en: <a href="http://bux.to/?r=monsenz" rel="nofollow">http://bux.to/?r=monsenz</a> que es la página con la que vamos a trabajar. Ve a JOIN NOW, llena todos los datos, poniendo tu mail real obviamente. Donde dice "paypal e-mail" deben poner la dirección de correo con la que se registraron en paypal.<br>  <br>  Nota: monsenz es mi cuenta, debe quedar asi ya que yo soy el que refiere. Cuando ustedes crean su cuenta y refieren el link (como estoy haciendo yo ahora) seran ustedes los que deben referir para recibir plata por cada vez que los usuarios a los que ustedes refieren hacen click.<br>  <br>  3- Una vez registrado es facil, luego de apretar login y poner su nick y clave, van a Surf Ads y va a aparecer una lista de direcciones. Abre una y espera los 30 segundos de un contador que aparece arriba de la página, cuando el contador llegue a cero tiene que aparecerles la palabra Done y un tilde verde al lado, de lo contrario hicieron algo mal o tienen problemas con su navegador. Siga así con todas una a una y no todas a la vez, porque sino no las toma.<br>  <br>  Por cada página visitada nos va a sumar 1 centavo de dólar. Si nos ponemos a pensar, clickeando solo nosotros, nunca llegaríamos a una suma de dinero que nos conforme.<br>  <br>  <br>  ?Qué hacer? ???Referir a otros usuarios!!!<br>  <br>  Cada usuario referido que clickee un anuncio, además de sumar un centavo él, nos suma un centavo a nosotros. Entonces con un solo referido que clickee la misma cantidad que nosotros, ya tendríamos el doble de ingresos. Y ni hablar de si consigue 200 ó 300 referidos, pueden llegar a ganar más de 100 dólares por mes. Saquen la cuenta.<br>  <br>  ?Cómo referir a otros usuarios?<br>  <br>  Muy fácil, con el link que nos dan en la sección My Stats. Los usuarios que se registren desde ese link quedan como referidos nuestros y por lo tanto nos suman plata.<br>  <br>  Cuando llegamos a un monto superior a los 10 dólares, ya estamos listos para transferir la plata a paypal. Debemos ir a My Stats y luego a cashout. En unas horas ya tendremos la plata en paypal.<br>  <br>  Se puede gastar la plata en sitios como MercadoLibre, o en aquellos sitios donde acepten PayPal.<br>  <br>  Ejemplo:<br>  ? 35 referidos clickean 10 publicidades por día = $3.50 dolares<br>  ? Tus ganancias diarias = $3.50 dolares<br>  ? Tus ganancias semanales = $24.50 dolares<br>  ? Tus ganancias mensuales = $105.00 dolares<br>  Es cuestión de conseguir referidos y esta bueno para comprarse cosas por Internet.

txVu1SH4aa	That's a tough question to answer. Is this something you're going to be selling online, perhaps on an online auction site? Then you may need a wholesaler who dropships. Most people won't tell you who they use as a wholesaler because you may choose the same product as them and create competition for them. My best advice would be to do your homework and search around on the net. Try <a href="http://www.123wholesalerlist.info/" rel="nofollow">http://www.123wholesalerlist.info/</a><br>  <br>  Why not make the tutus yourself. They seem like they'd be cheap to make, especially if you found fabric at a wholesale price. It sounds like a good idea, don't tell too many people they may steal it from you. Good luck!

Ja3kXyelaa	Speaking as one who for years was responsible for submitting bill payments made by customers at the bank to the respective companies, you must allow at least 2 business days minimum for your payment to be received by them.  Even when doing your banking online or through telephone banking, the information and funds must be transferred between parties.  You simply cannot pay a bill on the exact due date and expect it to be considered paid on time.  <br>  <br>  As the previous poster stated, you are not being penalized because you were honest, you are being penalized for being late.  <br>  <br>  If you wanted to wait until the very last second to pay your taxes, you should've attached a cheque to your return when you sealed it in the envelope.  <br>  <br>  Consider it a lesson learned for next year, and if you insist on paying your taxes online, or on telephone banking, or at the bank, do it by the 27th of April at the latest.|`|RkfIPD7Iaa	Contrary to what you seem to think, MOST taxpayers are honest.  You are not being 'punished' because you were honest, you were punished because you were LATE.<br>  <br>  CRA does not budge on their dates because you had 4 complete months to pay your taxes, you did not need to wait until the last minute.  Just as with paying any other bill (utilities, credit cards, etc), you need to allow the time for the payment to be processed from your bank to theirs.  Trust me, if I pay my Visa bill (due the 29th) on the 29th, and it doesn't get processed until the 31st, Visa is quite happy charging me interest for a late payment.<br>  <br>  I am pretty sure in your case you'll be fined the 5%.

U2UAe1beaa	1. The amount that you earn from Outlet is the same as the percentage from the core catalogs. Your first four campaigns are at 50% for Avon products and 20% for non avon (indicated by the diamond by description). The same would apply for all of the Avon catalogs (outlet, inspirational treasure, beauty/budget, Mark)<br>  2. Absolutely! That is exactly when you want to begin the next order! <br>  3. Carry catalogs with you everywhere you go and make it a point to let someone (or more than one) know at each place you go. Set a goal of how many catalog/contacts you want to make each day and do it! Buy lots of books and "whats new" bags and canvas neighborhoods in your area. While you are out, stop at businesses and ask if you can leave a book or two. Hair salons, nail salons, laundry, dry cleaners, dr offices, ... be creative...<br>  The more people that you talk to, the more sales that you will get. Same goes for canvassing etc. <br>  Remember!

Correct?<br>  <br>  If that's the case, then he could foreclose on the house.  You do owe him the money, and he has the paperwork (note, mortgage) to prove it.  He would have to follow the legal procedures, however.  If it's a mortgage state, that process can take quite a while, especially if you fight it.  So it may be best to try to find a solution.<br>  <br>  Is there any reason you can't refinance with another broker?  If the late payments do not show on your credit, you may still be able to do that. <br>  <br>  It sounds like he's in financial straits, and he was willing to let things go while things were good, but now he needs to get money from somewhere, and you seem to be that source.  It may  not be ethical or morally right, but it's probably legal for him to accelerate the loan.  Just because he hasn't required payment up to now does not mean that he can't do it - it probably states that on the mortgage documents, too.<br>  <br>  P.S. - Since you spoke to him and closed with him and, apparently, knew where he worked, I don't think "but I didn't think I had to pay" will play off too well in court if it came to that - you could have sent the payments to him at his work.|`|AA11695641	You better and I mean better just pay what you owe!!!!!

I do know that these are the hardest to work with (assistance wise) <br>  <br>  I don't think he can MAKE you sell your home.. the note is in your name, the deed is in your name.. BUT... if you feel like you've run out of options.. you may have.. basically the best thing for you to do is to make the fully amortized payment (the 30 year) this way your principal balance dosen't continue to grow.. because you are upside down in your payments (I'm assuming you made the minimum payments every month) refinancing is almost impossible (I've yet to see a neg am loan with the loan upside go through a refi) also.. because of the state of the market.. <br>  <br>  I would call your lender.. the company I work for SOMETIMES will force you to pay the fully amortized payment but dropping your interest rate to an ultra low rate giving you a step rate modification which will rise your interest rate yearly ( not monthly ) yes your payments may increase monthly BUT in the long run.. it will help you keep this property if it is your dream home... or atleast primary living residence the rate adjusting yearly will help you with time to cut back on expenses & bringing up your income.<br>  <br>  Plus if you continue making the minimum payments.. your principal balance will continue to grow.. depending on your not once it reaches a certain loan to value percentage.. you'll be forced to pay the interest only payment.. which won't increase the balance but won't pay it down the fully amortized payment pays down principal & interest.<br>  <br>  This loan was mostly used by those who were "flipping" properties..<br>  <br>  Hope this helped!

MtC3CWZraa	Half the time when I watch those shows, they don’t manage to sell the house before the show was finally edited so I wouldn’t necessarily say it’s always quick. <br>  <br>  Those shows are doing what every real estate agent begs (or would love to beg) their clients to do! So many owners refuse to look at their homes objectively as a buyer would and to do any work to improve them.  They take the “Well, I like it” or “It’s good enough for me” stance and won’t do anything. Those shows also actually price homes based on what has sold recently and where other homes are priced, rather than what too many sellers do which is to price based on what they want to make.<br>  <br>  These shows are proof that pulling your head out of your rear to price correctly & spruce your house up can sell your house faster.  <br>  <br>  Also keep in mind that those shows are often aired six months after they were filmed so they don’t really reflect today’s market conditions. I know an agent team who was on House Hunters and the lag time really is that long.  I am really curious to see what the shows airing next Spring & Summer are like since those will be the shows being filmed now.|`|BYpga7Uzaa	Millions of viewers and lots of editing.  Just because you see 10 buyers does not mean that they didn't send 100 through that they din't show or they can preshow it.|`|2N6oTOLQaa	They offer better value. This means a lower price than comparable houses, plus features that people want like new windows new carpet etc. They also do a lot of advertising to get people's attention and they offer one bonus that nobody else can: fame. Lots of people will jump at any opportunity to get their face on television, if they think they'll be on TV by looking at a house, then they'll do it even if they aren't interested in buying the house or don't have the money to buy it. 
49d798aae69c40cbf0926ebc21291224aa	Often, the case is that when someone has spent a long time in temp or contracting roles, employers don't want to consider them for a permanent position.<br>  <br>  When I'm recruiting, I'm forced to discriminate like this too.  For example, I'm currently recruiting for a finance role and I've received an application from a woman who has spent a long time in contract positions.  She says that this has been her choice (i.e. it's not like she can't hold down a job), and I have no reason to suspect otherwise - she is clearly bright, personable and well-educated.  But, one of the particular requirements for this job is to be able to build strong relationships across the business, and someone who has only spent a short time in each workplace cannot prove that they have been able to do that kind of thing effectively.<br>  <br>  I would advise that there are two possible ways to get out of this cycle.  Continue with temp or contract roles, but only if it's either of the following situations:<br>  - It's an ongoing temp role - i.e. there is no forseeable end date - so it's not like interim cover whilst a new person is hired, and it's not like maternity cover or something.  The reason for ongoing positions is usually that the company wants someone in that role, but doesn't have the budget to commit to hiring a full-time employee.  Therefore if and when they do get that budget, they'll likely hire the person that's temping in the role<br>  - It's a role in a large company, where if that role comes to an end, there will probably be something else for you to move on to.  I used to temp as a secretary and managed to turn a five-week assignment at KPMG into more than a year of continuous work because they liked me and because it's such a large company that there would always be something else to move on to<br>  <br>  In terms of there being loads of jobs in London, well, there's certainly less than there was a year ago!  I'm sort of keeping my eye out for a new job myself although not proper hardcore looking, and that's certainly my experience.<br>  <br>  Also, the job market in London tends to be very competitive.  Yes, there are a lot of jobs.  There are also a lot of people who are willing and able to do those jobs.  In some areas, employers are willing to hire people based on their potential and their perceived ability to learn.  In London, though, employers will often only hire people who have done the exact same thing before.  They can choose to be this picky because the exact profile that they want will almost certainly be available to them.<br>  <br>  So, sorry, my answer isn't very helpful advice, it's more just an analysis of why he's in this situation.  It isn't easy to get out.|`|0hgTGSZbaa	Maybe he need to sort out his work visa problems.|`|NbiMy9Fwaa	hmmm strange, should be lots of jobs. i dont know what to really suggest. maybe go and speak to a special careers person who deals with this type of stuff. ummm all i can do is give you goodluck and i hope he can find a good job that he enjoys.|`|AA12349988	It doesen't make sense to me to be honest - he sounds employable.<br>  <br>  The only thing that i can think of is that there is either something wrong with his CV (he could go to a couple of recruitment agencies and get it checked out), or he is going for jobs where he lacks experience and maybe needs to drop a level to get in a company and work his way up. <br>  <br>  My suggestions are to assist in getting an interview are:- <br>  <br>  1. Ask his temp employers to write a reference and enclose a copy with a his CV.<br>  2, Telephone and/email follow up every CV's <br>  <br>  Recruitment agencies and prospective employers get hundreds of application and it may sound strange but being hardworking is not enough - you need to stand out from the competition.<br>  <br>  Good luck in your search

AA10151510	Home prices for others in the areas are going to go down. Since Andy's house is in FC the bank is going to slash prices to sell it. That will hurt Tom, Matt and John when they all try to sell their houses. <br>  <br>  Houses will be for sale for a bargin. Banks are not in the Real Estate business so they'll be willing to sell for a deal. <br>  <br>  Lending practices will become more difficult. People that were able to get a loan last year will not be able this year unless they meet the strict regulations. Down payment, job, good credit. <br>  <br>  If people are losing houses they more than likely are not current on other bills. Growing debt causes many issues in our personal economy.<br>  <br>  An area with many FC houses sees a boost in sales at home improvement stores.

AA10423600	For starters, you need to forget all the crap that you have seen on the court TV shows.....they make great entertainment but they are not how courts work.<br>  <br>  Example, it is illegal in California for you to record someone's conversation without their knowledge.  You can't use it in court, and if you even let someone listen to the tape they can sue you for a ton of money.  Be very careful with that tape, and consult an attorney.  There are some gaping loopholes in the wiretap laws that could be used to your advantage...but you need an experienced attorney.<br>  <br>  If all you have are blank checks he wrote to you, I don't think that's going to be enough.  You need to prove you gave him some money, and prove there was some sort of agreement to be paid back.  <br>  <br>  Also, California has a limit of $7500 for small claims court....you will need to go to a higher court to sue.<br>  |`|44f4e8b1cc30f6dbca9544f7856b58aeaa	If you don't have any proof besides his word, then you will not be able to win the case in court.

If he DOES show up and you don't have proof, the judge will dismiss it and he won't owe you anything.|`|NpBgMPMyaa	As a general rule, unless it is in writing it did not happen.  So if you do not have a written agreement for a loan, then it did not happen.  If you do have a written agreement then and can prove that no payments have been received through an accounting method then you have an actionable recourse.  In some state garnishment is an option.

If it's charged-off credit card debt: don’t make the mistake of simply cutting a check to whatever collection agency has the debt for the charge-off....Doing so will not remove it from your credit reports. It will simply be updated to a "Paid Charge-Off," which, while slightly better, is still a seriously derogatory item.<br>  <br>  As per the Fair Credit Reporting Act, a charge-off, whether paid or not, can remain on a consumer's credit reports for up to seven years.<br>  ----------------------<br>  Making any payment resets the stature of limitations.<br>  <br>  *****When a debt collector first contacts you, your first step should always be to request validation of the debt per your rights under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act. Even if the debt is valid, request validation anyway.<br>  <br>  Send them a letter via Certified Mail + Return Receipt stating:<br>  <br>  Per the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, I am requesting written validation of this alleged debt<br>  <br>  When they call back, tell them: I have sent a certified letter to your office officially requesting written validation of this alleged debt per my rights under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act.<br>  <br>  Per this federal law they must provide written validation within 30 days and they must cease collection activity until they send you written validation. Do not let them scare you with bogus threats during this period. This will give you breathing time to explore your options.|`|Z9e6XQYzaa	I doubt that they will sue you if you make some honest attempt to pay them.  Remember as a collection agency they get part of your payment.  If they go ahead and sue and force you into bankruptcy they get nothing.  So, getting a payout of something is a lot better than nothing.  They pressure you because they would like to get all of their money as soon as possible.  Tell them what you can do and then stick to it.  Good Luck.|`|w6MtjrMVaa	I can tell you your speaking to an expert in that field. Many years ago i got into financial trouble by using my credit card limits. With that I had the same problem your going through. I can tell you that as long as you make an agreement to pay a certain amount each month and they accept it, then they can't sue you. Iand ifyou don't keep up the agreement then they can bring the matter to court for collection, whereby if you and any assets like a home, a car, or even try to garnish your salary if they know where you work, or what you own. In my case it was credit cards, yours is something else but it works the same way.|`|44f4e8b1cc30f6dbca9544f7856b58aeaa	Send them a letter asking them to validate the debt.  You have 30 days from the date of their letter to do this.  Send it certified mail.  They then have 30 days to respond.  If they don't, forget about it.  You can find a validation request letter on the internet by googling it.  Debt buyers will usually throw these out as they want easy money.  They don't have the proof, and they know it.  So they are banking on you not knowing anything about this.  They just want to scare you into making a payment.  |`|FhWOpW4waa	Any time you have questions about a debt, the best thing to do is call them.

It is probably going to primarily depend on how quick and how well the banking system is fixed.<br>  <br>  Currently it is estimated that there is between $1-$2 trillion worth of toxic assets in the US banking system. If the government quickly purchases those toxic assets at near face value, then I suspect that the economy will recover quite quickly.<br>  <br>  However, I don't think that congress has the political courage to spend that much money on the problem at taxpayers expense. Therefore, Treasury is presently trying to come up with a public/private plan where the government will offer loans, guarantees, and subsidies to private investors to remove the toxic assets off the books. With only $250 billion remaining in the TARP to subsidize the price, the price paid for the toxic assets to banks may be too little to make the banks healthy.

Write N.A, this means not associated, or not applicable. This will let the employers know that you took the time to look over the resume, instead of making it look like you missed it.<br>  <br>  2. You can exclude them from the resume, this is the less professional way, but it will still show them you have completed.<br>  <br>  Personally, i would go with number 1.

With a loan, it usually means that they did not make the minimum payment or didn't pay on time.<br>  <br>  A "remedy" is what the other party can do about a default.  This can include penalties, higher interest rates (default rates), and / or legal action.<br>  <br>  Being in default doesn't man that something bad will happen, just that the other party is allowed to take action.  A person is in default by being one day late with a payment.  Lenders usually don't exercise their remedy immediately, but they could!|`|y4SUDnpaaa	It means you did not make the payments as agreed.

When you own half of a duplex, you get to make those decisions, as it is your own home.

AA11627382	I think from the Organisations point of view it was a very good deal since operating cost had skyrocketed due to the rise in Crude. For a flight be it overbooked or half empty the operating costs remain the same and due to the pre-recession tremors felt in the US market there was a marked decrease in consumer spending over the Ariline industry. IT gives them an option to share resources mainly Line personnel and the maintenance personnel , it reduces operational costs since it pools in Hangar spaces for Maintenance .Airlines spend huge amounts in leasing out Hangar Spaces at Airports as well The Customers get a good deal since they have a increased routes available throughout the north-american continent and the Atlantic/Pacific as well .

This should give you a gauge for establishing your prices.  If you find that you need to charge 'considerably' more than the competition, it's probably because they are buying in large quantities where you may be paying full retail since you're just starting out.<br>  <br>  While you don't want to start a business taking losses just to make a sale, consider how much money you will need to buy a small inventory in bulk to reduce your costs and sell competitively.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!<br>  NO BOSS Workshops<br>  You should be able to start your business for little or nothing.

Mezzanine finance is where the loan agreement gives the lender, upon default by the borrower, a right to convert some, or all of the loan, into an equity stake. This gives the lender some control over the business to safeguard the outstanding loan from the possible actions of the borrower, which may not be in the lenders interest.<br>  <br>  Senior finance includes the release of equity from an asset, eg, a home. <br>  <br>  You will appreciate the above is simply to give a general idea of these types of financial instrument.

gR94waSzaa	Okay, lucky you, we just reviewed this in my careers and technology class today.  There are many questions they will ask you, i will just type some questions, then give you pointers on how to answer them.<br>  <br>  1. Tell me about your self.<br>  Tip: tell them about your self, but keep it short and simple, tell them about your school, and maybe some extra curricular activities.  <br>  <br>  2.  What are your strength?<br>  Tip: Answer this in complete sentences! This is the biggest error many people make, also, give strengths that relate to the job.<br>  <br>  3. What are some weaknesses?<br>  Tip: point out weaknesses, but turn it around, point out ways you are trying to correct them.<br>  <br>  4. What do you know about this company?<br>  Tip: KNOW about the company! Don't do in their knowing nothing.<br>  <br>  5. What salary do you expect?<br>  Tip: Don't make an exact salary.  Tell them that you want a fair salary, and they will give what you deserve, you don't want to seam too needy.<br>  <br>  6. Do you prefer working alone or with others?<br>  Tip: make yourself look good at both, they want some one who can work alone and with others!<br>  <br>  7. Why should we hire you?<br>  Tip: state that you know that there are other candidates, but tell them that you are the best, but tell them why.  Are you persuasive? nice? caring? tell them!<br>  <br>  8. What conflicts have you solved?<br>  Tip: don't be general, and don't be specific, tell them about sports conflicts that you solved, and how.<br>  <br>  9. What questions do you have?<br>  Tip: Don't bombard them with questions, ask simple ones like what the hours would be, and if there is room for a promotion.<br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  General Tips:<br>  - When meeting the interviewer, look them in the eye, state your name, and have a firm shake.<br>  <br>  - Even though it is nike, dress appropriately, not a suit and tie, but maybe khaki's and a polo shirt.<br>  <br>  - Don't give of tips.  These are things that you do such and avoiding eye contact, stuttering, or looking around.  This lets them know you get nervous under pressure, and that you may fear authority.<br>  <br>  <br>  Hope I Helped, Good Luck!|`|RtQaCYUuaa	white tuxedo dress to impress

bankzwwYaa	Sorry, but this new company DOES have signatory. You need to read the fine print. They can sell your loan to the Chinese governent if they so choose and you are STILL liable for the debt.<br>  <br>  It doesnt matter "as far as I am concerned", what matters is the LAW, and the LAW is on the side of the lender you screwed over. You cannot get rid of them if the debt with the original company was valid, if the statue of limitations hasnt passed AND you havent declared/discharged a bankruptcy.<br>  <br>  Unless there is another circumstance here that you arent saying, your butt is grass and the collection agency is the lawn mower.

lGdrvXMdaa	With a lot of years in the Real Estate business,maybe I can offer you some suggestions.<br>  You can go to most hardware stores and pick up for sale by owner signs.<br>  They also have plastic tubes to hold your information sheets .<br>  When you describe your house, just don't ever quote the square footage. <br>  <br>  You can say, "According to court house records" the sq. footage shows to be XXXXX. Otherwise, they can force you to add the extra footage, if you over estimate. I saw that happen.<br>  <br>  You can also call a realtor and ask them to run a market analysis on your home. "(Don't tell them you are wanting to sell it yourself)"<br>  the results will give you the information you need to price your home properly.<br>  <br>  One thing to remember, Pretend you are the buyer of your home, How do you want it to look. when you walk in that front door?? <br>  Keep it clean and in order, touch up any paint and trim.<br>  Keep the yard in good condition.<br>  Remember the first impression, is the front door.<br>  <br>  <br>  You can go to an office supply store and pick up the contracts that Realtors use. They are pretty in depth.<br>  Don't be afraid to ask people if they have been pre-qualified with a lender. If so, you know they are serious buyers.<br>  The lenders can take care of all the paper trail from there.<br>  <br>  Just be sure to tell the buyers about any problems with the house, if there are any.<br>  <br>  With the way the market is today, you want to be sure that you don't over price yourself out of the market.<br>  Best of luck to you.|`|Saul1Bhuaa	Do a lot of searching "FSBO".<br>  <br>  Be prepared with how you will handle a transaction from a prospective buyer represented by a buyer's agent

ce7afe95bf60476394e3f44c376bb2a8aa	The qualifications for foodstamps are different in every state, so the best way to know would be to call and ask what the income limit for two people is. Your age doesn't matter. All that matters is the number of people in your home and how much money you make. I would think since you make about 700 a month after taxes, you would probably qualify. Me and my husband applied for them after our second daughter was born, and the limit for four people was 2,600  a month. So for two people, 700 dollars would probably be under the limit and you could probably get foodstamps. But like I said, the limit is different in every state. All you need to do is call. They should be able to tell you over the phone what the limit for two people is. But I do believe they go by what you make BEFORE taxes.

1cd30775da21ba0943975a758e5f5eacaa	No.  Tell them something else such as you were traveling, tending to a sick family member or doing part time gigs.<br>  <br>  But don't tell them about your OCD.  If you don't think it will affect your work - then they don't need to know.  The employer will act as if they won't discriminate against you - but the reality is they will.  They'll question your dependability and probably offer the job to someone else.|`|AA11597930	It really depends on if the OCD will affect your working.  Myself, I have a slight OCD about closed doors.  A guy I went to school with had one about alarm clocks.  However, we wouldn't have to say anything since they don't affect productivity.  I would avoid using that as a gap excuse if you can.  Maybe use that you were getting medical treatment during the time or had med problems.  Most won't want you to elaborate.|`|1df56fb91ef0bf12d525ab2de00cbb3baa	I think honesty is the best policy.  I think lots of people suffer from that and you should not worry.  If you have done the work to get better, tell them about it.  It will show you care enough about yourself to improve.  Keep it short though, you don't want to give them a sob story.|`|c4f4dd2d9ef9c2eaea8fbbac753b1c72aa	You'll have to anyway|`|c708a5d4783cee433af3471ac686fcbfaa	Personally, i wouldn't.  If you are now on medication for your OCD and are doing therapy, that should help you tremendously, and make it your goal to remain at your job for a long time.  Some people, wake up every day not wanting to go to work, instead, if you wake up and make going to work and performing your duties well, your goal to achieve, you can reach it! Good luck, you can do it!|`|dd359cc64852ff6e00d407ac09db7261aa	Yes, you should always tell them about any condition you may have because they will find out sometime.  If you think you won't let it effect your work, then tell them that and that you are 'growing out' of it as it may seem...  If you assure them that you would be as good [if not better] than anyother prospective employees then they will probably accept you.<br>  <br>  Good luck, I know OCD isn't an easy thing to battle with!<br>  Lorna|`|8b2833aa3759d49f339fc5a11a9c9895aa	No.  If you are better and can conduct the functions of the job normally now then you don't need to disclose.  Find a better more appropriate way to respond to their inquiries on your "time off" on your resume.  Employers are only allowed to ask (in the case of an obvious handicap) if you feel you can perform the work relevant to the job.  Upon receiving an offer letter they will ask you if you need accomodations (you're in a wheelchair, and need a special desk or register height) but they are not allowed to ask before an offer letter.  I had to take a class on this for my Ethics training at work.  As long as you are "normal" now even if meds make you "normal" they don't have a right to know.

654c7643984cd6b3f7f0f00356056e81aa	If you have good credit, by all means refinance.  You should NOT be in a 30-year mortgage in the first place.

Il faut aussi se respecter soi-même.<br>  <br>  Comment réussissez-vous à vous respecter vous-même quand votre salaire vous ouvre droit à des aides sociales <br>  (au passage, ?a co?te cher à la France tout ?a...)<br>  pour réussir à vous loger, vous nourrir et élever décemment vos gamins?<br>  Je ne sais pas si vous vous rendez compte à quel point c'est pour beaucoup de personnes extrêmement dévalorisant de dépendre de l'assistanat alors qu'ils travaillent, et à temps plein en faisant des efforts qui plus est.<br>  <br>  Et effectivement, si les gens recevaient un salaire un tant soit peu supérieur à la limite de survie qu'est le SMIC pour 35h de travail, ils auraient peut-être moins de rancoeur vis-à-vis de leurs employeurs.<br>  Et s'ils avaient l'impression que leurs efforts sont récompensés, cette guéguerre stupide n'aurait plus lieu d'être chez les gens sensés (EH BIEN OUI, le jour aù les employeurs AUSSI auront compris ?a, les choses pourront avancer).<br>  <br>  Alors gardez votre langue fourchue collée derrière vos dents et cessez de persifler. Quelqu'un qui bosse doit avoir un salaire qui lui permette de vivre correctement.<br>  Au 21è siècle, ce n'est quand même pas trop demander, si?<br>  <br>  Aujourd'hui je suis pour ma part à l'abri du besoin grace à mon esprit entreprenant. Mais mon expérience des humains m'a appris que tous ne sont pas faits pour entreprendre, et beaucoup se sentent à leur place quand ils font tourner la machine. <br>  <br>  Ce n'est pas pour autant qu'il faut les prendre pour des dégénérés haineux. NON ce sont juste des PERSONNES qui  TRAVAILLENT et qui MERITENT une certaine reconnaissance... qu'il s'agisse d'un niveau de salaire leur permettant de vivre du seul fruit de leur travail ou de la considération qu'ils re?oivent pour leur professionnalisme.<br>  <br>  Je vais vous dire, j'ai été femme de ménage à 40h par semaine au SMIC. Mes horaires: 5h-8h, 9h30-11h30, 17h-20h. Très facile, non? Et super bien payé pour les efforts à fournir (avec frais de déplacements totalement de ma poche bien s?r...parce que c'étaient 3 horaires différents sur 3 sites différents, soit environ 50km par jour)<br>  Les clients de l'entreprise qui m'employait avaient BESOIN de mes services. Il leur FAUT des gens pour nettoyer leurs usines, bureaux,... <br>  Donc il FAUT des gens qui font ce travail. Est-ce une raison pour les payer à coup de lance-pierre???<br>  Et contrairement à ce que vous dites, les employés ne sont pas tous à vouloir quitter leur poste comme des rats le navire dès l'horaire fait tout en maudissant leur patron. <br>  <br>  La plupart aimeraient un meilleur salaire qui donne l'impression d'être reconnu. Ils ne demandent pas la lune, juste de quoi se sentir valorisés de travailler.<br>  <br>  Et permettez-moi une suggestion en tant que patron. Si vous avez des employés, garantissez-leur des conditions de travail humainement convenables pour un salaire vivable. Et vous verrez qu'ils seront subitement plus réceptifs à une attitude professionnaliste. Si, si je vous assure d'expérience je peux vous dire que ?a marche très bien!<br>  <br>  En conclusion je laisse parler ma longue expérience personnelle et professionnelle dans mille et un domaines qui m'ont tous appris tant de choses:<br>  <br>  LE JOUR OU TOUS LES EMPLOYEURS COMPRENDRONT L'EQUATION SUIVANTE, ON POURRA ENFIN BOSSER ENSEMBLE POUR RELEVER LE NIVEAU GENERAL :<br>  <br>  Bonne considération+salaire décent+conditions de travail exempt de stress inutile = haut moral professionnel+valorisation personnelle et professionnelle+envie de s'investir et de réussir+sentiment qu'on peut faire 15min de plus sans se sentir exploité = professionnalisme = satisfaction réciproque = bon boulot = croissance...<br>  <br>  Partout où sont appliqués les principes:<br>  <br>  cadence dure à suivre+pressions à la rentabilité+salaire qui permet d'épargner 200€ en un an et qui oblige à recevoir des aides sociales pour survivre+professionalisme du salarié trop rarement suivi d'effets<br>  <br>  on retrouve les effets suivants:<br>  <br>  fatigue+stress+amertume+moral en berne+impression d'être pris pour un esclave (même les serfs au moyen age travaillaient moins d'heures que nous dans l'année, à méditer pour ceux qui nous trouvent fainéants) <br>  =vraiment pas envie d'en faire encore plus pour quelqu'un qui ne respecte pas ce qui est fait pour lui et ceux qui le font<br>  =pas envie de le respecter non plus<br>  =perte de productivité et augmentation des arrêts de travail<br>  =forts co?ts pour la société qui doit prendre en charge les compléments financiers nécessaires pour des personnes qui TRAVAILLENT (c'est quand même un comble pour un pays en déficit que l'Etat doive mettre au bout du salaire de qqn qui ne travaille pas pour lui, vous ne trouvez pas?)<br>  <br>  Il serait urgent de comprendre qu'on n'est plus au 19è siècle. <br>  Et qu'augmenter le salaire minimal augmenterait dans les mentalités la valeur travail.<br>  Les sommes (colossales) dépensées pour aider les gens qui travaillent (donc ni fainéants ni profiteurs) à remplir leur frigo jusqu'au 31 du mois seraient mieux employées si elles faisaient directement partie des salaires...|`|ffaK3oXJaa	je pense qu avoir un travail a notre époque est une richesse,face a tous ces gens qui souffrent dans le monde et pas seulement de ne pas avoir de travail alors oui je resterais 15 mn de plus par respect pour la personne qui m emploie @+|`|jb3QCjvnaa	la smic attitude ,c'est a dire un pouvoir d'achat vraiment a la limite du solvable|`|aa8320f3ec4479d8ae69f07ed1ce1d01aa	Ce n'est pas une question de salaire mais d'attitude professionnelle.<br>  Déborder légèrement n'est pas "dramatique" mais il ne faut pas que ce soit tous les jours, sinon, c'est un problème d'organisation.<br>  <br>  Faire preuve de professionnalisme permet souvent de gravir les échelons hiérarchiques et, ainsi, de décoller au niveau du salaire...|`|bbe3df0a13a324c170a59444d35c75adaa	En tant que patron, quand je vois les réponses ici, je suis effaré........... <br>  Je me demande quand les mentalités changeront.... cette guéguerre pitoyable entre patrons et employés......<br>  Si vous n'êtes pas content de votre condition bougez vous le c.. et devenez vous même patron !!<br>  <br>  Merci à Vitriol91 de relever le niveau.....|`|68f248228d64467bdaa9cb2b0a19fa94aa	J'en suis tout heureux en imaginant ce que gagne l'ouvrier philippin ou patagon pour 72 h de taf / semaine, et ?a m'encourage à faire des économies...<br>  J'ai déjà amassé 112 euro à la Caisse d'Epargne en même pas deux ans et grace à toutes les aides sociales, je vis comme un seigneur !|`|HjRvDw9Zaa	Bien évidemment que oui|`|be80a4bcd9752b49798a7dd98e56aea2aa	j'espérerais.<br>  j'espérerais que mon patron voie mes efforts et qu'il va m'augmenter.<br>  mais si c'est tous les jours et que mon patron trouve ?a normal, je lui claque le beignet et je me fais virer.<br>  après le rémi, les allocs etc...<br>  avec tout l'argent qu'ils ont, certains patrons gagneraient à se comporter en êtres humains en récompensant les salariés qui font des efforts.<br>  sinon on lui coule sa bo?te à ce salaud d'égoiste.<br>  travailler n'est pas la foire aux esclaves.|`|c2YhYTMbaa	je reste volontiers s'il arrive parfois que ce soit moi qui doive partir 15 minutes avant l'heure et qu'en l'absence de client ?a m'est autorisée... il faut que la souplesse soit dans les deux sens !
ekTjsjXaaa	I have spoken with the NC Department of Revenue regarding this forum's question.  <br>  <br>     While in year's past, the state has traditionally done exceptionally well with processing efile returns, they are not going out of their way to "hold" returns, nor are they bankrupt and unable to pay.<br>  <br>    They are still processing returns filed electronically and their current posting timeframe is running around three weeks after your return is processed (not when turbotax or similar say your return is received by the state, but when the state actually has processed your return) <br>  <br>  What this means in a nutshell:  If you received a notification your tax return was accepted around Feb 3, assuming it takes 1-2 business weeks to process your return at the state, and another 3-4 weeks to pay out any refund owed... You'll probably receive a direct deposit around March 10-March 17, depending how long your individual banks hold it in limboland.<br>  <br>     That's probably why the media hasn't run anything about it, because it's really a non-issue.<br>  <br>  The following may be of interest:<br>  (Source: Form D401 P5) Need to Call Us about your Refund?<br>  <br>  Automated Refund Inquiry Line<br>  1-877-252-4052 (toll-free)<br>  <br>  * Before Calling:<br>  If Filing Paper Return<br>  <br>  JAN/FEB Please Allow 8 weeks<br>  MAR Please Allow 10 weeks<br>  APR Please Allow 12 weeks<br>  <br>  All Electronically Filed Returns 4 weeks<br>  <br>  * Additional time is required if you owe a<br>  State agency or the IRS any munny, etc.|`|92f390737f9d627f0ae16497a4c2cfafaa	I e-filed on Jan 31 and chose direct deposit for federal and NC.

Well it is March 3 now and still no refund. My sister had hers done by HR Block yesterday and they are saying the state is broke! Dont know how true that is, I just hope NC doesnt turn out to be like California, handing out IOU's.

I received my federal return in a short time but I still haven't received the state. My daughter hasn't receive hers either so she called Raleigh.

Some people are thinking that if Delta Airlines manages to pull through they will make a really good recovery. With the dangers in the world today, I was kind of thinking about Lockheed, but you might wait until the bad press over the presidential helicopters blows over. For the most part, but not exclusively, leave banks alone, and maybe shipping companies until there is more evidence of a recovery. If you are using a search screen, look for companies that have a positive number for earnings per share and compare current price to book value (equity divided by the number of shares outstanding). You will find companies that are still making a profit but are selling for less than what they are actually worth -- a steal in anybody's book, but you may have to wait a while to realize it.|`|9414370f8a77276b4be347b80c209ad5aa	There are a number of stocks that are really tempting.

Then find a mutual fund that is designed for you to take that money out that year.  For example, if you want to keep your money in the market until 2030, buy the Schwab Target 2030.

e83c5229e243a4223beeb3c6e55aac65aa	This is just something for you to think about.<br>  <br>  In 10 years of selling, I have never used a drop shipper.<br>  <br>  Why? Because, I want the item that I'm selling in my possession. I want to be the one to package it and ship it.<br>  <br>  I think about the what ifs. <br>  <br>  What if the drop shipper suddenly runs out of the item and you've sold several. Your buyers are expecting that item and a excuse to why you don't have it now, will not cut it with your buyers, after they have waited sometimes for days waiting for the listing to end.<br>  <br>  What if the drop shipper doesn't send the item to your buyers. Now you have a buyer that has alreadly paid for the item and they are writing or calling you asking why their stuff hasn't arrived. What are you going to say? Will you have all the tracking info to research that shipment? What if the drop shipper sends the wrong item?<br>  <br>  This is my thinking when it comes to drop shippers.<br>  <br>  Why set your self up for failure. This is your business. It's your responsibility to have the the item that you sell. It's your responsibility to properly package the item against breakage.

sby0C51haa	You can sell it the day after you bought it if you want to, the catch is that the mortgage is still owed in its' entirety and you will have to pay it off as soon as you sell the timeshare. If the amount you owe is greater that the amount you are able to sell your timeshare for you will need to come up with the difference to clear the title for the next owner. Good luck on the sale, it is almost impossible to come up with a sale that covers your original purchase price if you bought from a developer.<br>   <br>   <br>  Timeshares can be sold but the resale value is terrible, if yours is a good one (location, season, size of unit, etc.) then it is easier but it will never sell for half of what you paid for. The average prize that I have seen them been sold is for no more than $2000, and this is for completely paid off timeshares.<br>  There are so many options out there and you are right several owners would just give them away, that it will be almost impossible for you to find someone to take over your payments or give you a good amount for it.<br>  You might want to talk to your accountant about defaulting on the payments.<br>  <br>  These are some options:<br>  <br>  - Resale is most likely not an option unless you sell it to a friend or relative.<br>  - BE VERY CAREFUL if someone offers to sale it for you and ask for money upfront, they are just a bunch of scammers.<br>  - It is ok to pay a few dollars (no more that $30) to post an ad in some really good site. There are some FREE sites that you can advertise, and my advise is that you just give it away and let someone take over your payments, you can try these:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://timeshareownerscommunity.com/" rel="nofollow">http://timeshareownerscommunity.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://craigslist.com" rel="nofollow">http://craigslist.com</a><br>  <a href="http://ebay.com" rel="nofollow">http://ebay.com</a><br>  <a href="http://recycler.com/" rel="nofollow">http://recycler.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://usfreeads.com/" rel="nofollow">http://usfreeads.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.inetgiant.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.inetgiant.com/</a><br>  <br>  - Another alternative is donation, some charities take these timeshares. You can see a list of them here:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://timeshareownerscommunity.com/Charities-Accepting-Timeshares-Donations.html" rel="nofollow">http://timeshareownerscommunity.com/Char...</a><br>  <br>  - The last is the more painful, talk to your accountant about bankruptcy or just defaulting on the loan.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|JLayHNZCaa	Sorry, about that, you got took.

It will be a different number, but will still be tied to your eisting account.|`|jeyLZLDGaa	Your liability under federal law for unauthorized use of your ATM or debit card depends on how quickly you report the loss. If you report an ATM or debit card missing before it's used without your permission, the EFTA says the card issuer cannot hold you responsible for any unauthorized transfers. If unauthorized use occurs before you report it, your liability under federal law depends on how quickly you report the loss.<br>  <br>  For example, if you report the loss within two business days after you realize your card is missing, you will not be responsible for more than $50 for unauthorized use. However, if you don't report the loss within two business days after you discover the loss, you could lose up to $500 because of an unauthorized transfer. You also risk unlimited loss if you fail to report an unauthorized transfer within 60 days after your bank statement containing unauthorized use is mailed to you. That means you could lose all the money in your bank account and the unused portion of your line of credit established for overdrafts. However, for unauthorized transfers involving only your debit card number (not the loss of the card), you are liable only for transfers that occur after 60 days following the mailing of your bank statement containing the unauthorized use and before you report the loss.<br>  <br>  If unauthorized transfers show up on your bank statement, report them to the card issuer as quickly as possible. Once you've reported the loss of your ATM or debit card, you cannot be held liable for additional unauthorized transfers that occur after that time.
AEZ75dJ7aa	Ok I thought about this all night ,well since you posted it, and... I got nothin' !!!  I can't think of any job that doesn't require long amounts of time sitting or standing.  I did think that maybe if you talked to your local job corp. or Disabled Americans org they may be able to help you find something OR help you receive the necessary funds and financial aid(even if it is disability) while you are in school getting job training for something.  Receiving disability because you have a true disability is not a bad thing. Especially if you use the time to further educate yourself. With advance career training you'll be much further ahead of the game. Plus you'll show your son that there's always  a way to succeed and that education is important.   Good luck to you and your in my prayers.

Unfortunately, it is not well publicized.<br>  <br>  Check out your local alarm home/commercial provider and ask them if there are openings for an alarm console monitor in which you keep track of any alarms that go off and call the owner's phone to find out why the alarm was going on.  And also obtain from the owner the special password to indicate that no one had access to his alarm system.  And if everything fails, you are responsible for calling in a private patrol service which will visit the alarmed home to check it out.

My advice would be to go for a UK institution that is fully covered by the government savings guarantee scheme.<br>  <br>  Your local building society, if you have one in your area, would qualify for such a scheme.  Some building societies are also having small difficulties, but few are exposed to property deals/sub-prime in the same way some of the banks are.<br>  <br>  You should put your full ISA allowance into an ISA as the interest on this is tax free.  You can use both this year's allowance (3k) BEFORE April and then next year's allowance in the next tax year.  Shop around for a good ISA deal.  As interest rates are low, paying nil tax on a chunk will help!<br>  <br>  You might also like to look at Zopa - a social lending site that will lend your money to other people (after making the requisite credit checks, etc).

Also, you can invest an additional ￡3,600 in a Stocks and Shares ISA, which is also free of tax.<br>  Investing in the stock market may seem a bad idea, and many people may disagree with this, but in fact now is the best time to do so. Even though stocks may fall slightly more in the short term, in the longer term (5-10 years) they are bound to go up again. Investing ￡10,000 in a simple FTSE tracker at today's levels (FTSE 100 is around 3,500) could see profits of over ￡3,000 if/when it gets up to the 5,000 mark again. <br>  It's more risky, but the benefits are huge. You just need to pay in when stocks are low, and pay out when they're high. Simple. Just don't ever assume that Stocks will go up forever.

8063947433f50c3e93546a4ba2133fdcaa	Yes you can.  You need to somehow restructure your budget so that you are paying rent with the check that comes before the rent is due, not the check that comes after the due date.  If you ever get overtime or have a month with an extra check (usually December or January) then you can use that to get ahead. Otherwise, put off paying other bills if you have to but keep the rent paid so that you have a roof over your head. That has to be priority number one.  <br>  <br>  Not to mention if you get evicted, it stays on your credit report for years and will make renting anywhere else very difficult.|`|RZzMse3Haa	Yes, you can.<br>  <br>  You need to talk to your landlord and explain your pay date. It is not unheard of to adjust when the rent is due. They are under no legal obligation to do this, however.|`|VQPtZhTRaa	Yes you could...read your lease and see what it says you have for a grace period.  Im a landlord and I allow until the 5th of the month at which time I add late fees. My lease states that they have to be 30 days past due for eviction proceedings to start. <br>  Just another suggestion...take a look at paying it out of another check!  maybe one that is the middle of the month...realign your expenses so that your rent is not late.  You will always need a roof over your head and once you have an eviction in your pst it will be hard to rent a new place

MGEYaehVaa	OK, first, even if they don't ask for a resume, bring one and hand it to your interviewer at the beginning of the interview.  If will give them something to look over, and will give them a basic idea of what kind of things you're into, and what to ask you about.  Don't lie or stretch anything; many employers will do background checks on possible employees.<br>  <br>  Dress professionally.  Even if it's at a theme parky place, wear a skirt (about to your knees) and a nice blouse.  Practical but formal footwear.  Don't stress.  Be calm and yourself.  Good luck!  :-D

Essential foods, meat and groceries and veg and fruit do not have VAT. Food prepared in a cafe to eat in or take away whether hot or cold has VAT added.|`|2OO9U8o9aa	You pay VAT on what the EU government has classed as luxury , so therefore things like confectionery , biscuits , soft drinks , fruit flavoured milk shakes (not choc !!)   All standard food is VAT exempt e.g meat , fish , dairy products etc <br>  Any food you buy in a restaurant has VAT added3d as you are being provided with a service (hopefully ) <br>  It is reasonable straightforward although there are some grey areas in assessing which food and drink may be luxury and which are necessity |`|631kHi2yaa	Jaffa Cakes have zero VAT as they are cakes and are not taxed!

But i really doubt the practicability of the same.|`|ee63beadde43c1c4370dcd700471caebaa	I suggest you speak with your faculty adviser and see what they suggest. Most colleges offer an opportunity to do an internship in your senior year. Having work experience is good but we start with no experience. I would probably move forward with my education and then start applying for a job in accounting. You may be able to find something part time in the field to gain some experience. During tax season many bookkeeping and accounting firms hire temporary workers. The national tax services such as H & R Block hire people to do taxes for a few months of the tax season. You might be able to do that part time while still going to college. Employers know that most college graduates come to them with little or no work experience in their chosen field. Getting your education is much more important at this point.|`|Sa0N4swjaa	If your current job is what you want to do after graduation, then don't do the internship.  If you want to work in a firm, take the internship, it could lead to a full time job after graduation and a part time job while you finish school.  Many firms will hire their interns because they know what to expect from you and it is easier to keep you than train someone new.

You probably just need someone who knows his way around a tax return. A lot of people post an "I need a lawyer" type question to what for a knowledgeable practitioner is a fairly simple problem.  I used to work for a tax attorney (in Central California no less.)  His fees were $250 per hour.  You need a pretty sizable problem to justify paying that.

j0mI8l07aa	Nah, life's far from over. It'll go on your credit, and you maybe won't be able to get a car financed for a while. MAYBE. Some places will finance you just for having a JOB these days. Keep in mind the auto industry is desperate as hell right now. It really won't effect you much though as far as apartments, renting houses... etc. They are mostly looking at your credit (the ones that do anyway, not ALL of them do) to see if you've bailed on a lease for an apartment or house before.<br>  Look on the bright side, banks aren't lending money to anyone but people with super-high credit ratings now anyways.<br>  And BTW... You're a FOOL if you pay off ANY balance after the auction. I wouldn't give 'em a dime. You're gonna have the reposession on your credit anyways... Why pay them for a car you don't even have if you're credit's screwed anyways?<br>  If they try to make you (which they probably won't, they'd have to spend time and money to take you to court) file for bankruptcy and laugh at 'em.<br>  Believe me... The government and banks would love for you to believe that you can't live without a great credit rating. There are LOTS of ways to get around a bad credit rating.<br>  I'm not saying go around freely ripping people off or anything, but there's no sense in worrying yourself to death over it either.|`|Saul1Bhuaa	That's what bankruptcy is for.  To eradicate debts.<br>  <br>  No, you're life won't be over.  Just make smart decisions from now on.
ChxH58mOaa	age is NOT the KEY here....they go after  experience, licensing, paperwork, etc.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|AA12373941	I don't think age should or will come into it.  You have to pass a medical and this is refreshed every two years.  What may happen is that things pop up in your medical that mean you can't work offshore and as you get older there is more chance of such things popping up!<br>  <br>  As a rule of thumb, if you can walk quickly, touch your toes and the doctor thinks you can "self rescue" (ie get yourself out of a sinking helicopter) then you are probably fit enough.  People who are very obese tend to get told to lose weight and only get given a 6 month certificate.  Likewise, they check your teeth so go to the dentist well in advance!<br>  <br>  If you are any long term medicines then the doctor will need to know about these, and as all bags get searched going offshore they will discover if you are taking medicines.  <br>  <br>  The medical is a good thing to have as you know what condition you are in.  It is a requirement due to the shift work we have to do, and you are likely to be tested for various illegal drugs although this depends on the employer.<br>  <br>  As a 40 year old you should still be in good enough shape, and have plenty of life experience to bring to the job.  I've seen guys in their sixties at work and others come offshore after a career in the forces.  Almost anyone can work offshore, but it is very much a dangerous environment with you spending half your year living away from your family.<br>  <br>  Good luck with your job application.  I presume it's in the North Sea which is having a bit of a recession but there are jobs to be had out there.

kZ8jIStBaa	Of course you can withdraw money from ATMs in India that support VISA card. ATMs that have VISA symbol prominently displayed on them are the ones you have to use.<br>  <br>  As for "charge for withdrawal" if you use HSBC ATM they won't charge you for withdrawal, just the exchange rate on your currency to Indian Rupee will be charged. If you use other banks ATM they will charge you. That is generally the case. But I have heard that even some parent bank ATMs charge some nominal amount on withdrawal. You better make sure with your Bank because these regulations vary from bank to bank.

Check it out first.  <br>  <br>  Now, if the cheque was made out to W.Somebody, and your dad or brother or cousin was also called W.

The product makers pay the owners of the franchised movie or tv characters for the use of the copywritten images, and because children will reach for those before a similar product with now movie character, the product gets more sales through the extra advertising boost.

PbVQHdtSaa	IN MY POCKET : )|`|RE7AvblUaa	into your bank account. wow.....|`|d5zEYomEaa	First the lender must get paid for any loans you have on it, and if there's any leftovers you get a check. With declining house prices, most people's loans are more than their houses are worth so they will still owe the bank money if they were to sell the house, meaning the bank would have rights to own it before the people they're trying to sell it to, so they are stuck. They can't 'afford' to sell the house and if they can't make their mortgage payments, they will go into foreclosure and the bank keeps the house. Also if taxes are owed on the property, if their are any liens such as "mechanics liens" for any contractors that have not been paid in the past, escrow fees, also the real estate agents for both parties will get a chunk out, leaving maybe nothing left for the seller in most cases.|`|dr8BREXLaa	If you owe money to a bank for your home, the 1st lien is to the mortgage company, and they would get paid first out of the total purchase price of your home. If there is a second mortgage on it, they get paid second, if there are municipal liens on the home such as taxes, water/sewer etc, they get paid third if any money is left. Then there after if there is mechanical liens , such as a contractor who did work on it , they get paid if there is anything left over..BUT if you don't owe any of these on your home, then the lawyers get paid a set fee to do the paperwork and HUD statement approx $650 and you get the rest of the purchase price in the form of a check to you, or it can be wired into your bank account as well..hope this helps.|`|pR0iMcz7aa	Into a bank account. When you sell your house it all gets done by the estate agent and money is handed over straight through you bank account.|`|a73a11fa642e15167d49c1ea43b54b8caa	The mortgage company gets what is owed to them and the seller keeps the rest (after closing costs).|`|uRUSs4t8aa	charity (i mean to your wife)|`|7mHlDzn9aa	be more specific but it goes to your creditors such as mortgage holders, unpaid property taxes, legal fees, and if I haven't left anyone  out like real estate comissions then you get a check for the balance.
7QPv7ta7aa	Each derogatory item ages off your credit report 7-1/2 years from the date of first deficiency.  Nothing restarts that clock.<br>  <br>  The older an item, the less impact on your score.  By the time an time reaches the 7 year mark, it has very little impact on your score.  So when the derogatory item falls off, your score will only increase a little.|`|oSBl3xeeaa	Perhaps.  BUT, there is a glitch.  You can have a $1700 balance with a credit card and never pay it off, but the company you owe is smarter than you think.  They sell it, and resell it which continues through the years.  Just face it.  Work on paying it off, ask for a settlement letter.  Some companies are negotiating with folks to the point of asking what they feel they can pay off the account in 1 swoop.  For example:  you owe 1700.00, the company asks you what you can pay in 1 lump sum; you tell them possibly around $750.00.  They call you back and either agree or disagree.  If they agree, you have this opportunity to get it paid off now and they send a letter to the credit bureau stating the account has been settled.<br>  If they disagree, they may tack on 100 or 150 dollars more to see if you agree.  Stand by what you think is reasonable and you may get it.<br>  |`|7mHlDzn9aa	You sometimes have to have items manually removed. This happened in my case

97a7d25a569ecc28c857f02a34b7fd9baa	I know how you feel.  I was once in your situation.  I spent 2 full years job searching; while emplyers wouldn't hire me for some redicules reasons.  <br>  <br>  People say job searching is easy; but in reality it's not.  Theres alot of employers that like to descriminate and that's what makes job searching so difficult.  You can be well-dressed, clean, calm, quiet, easy-going, and well-presentable; andf still get turned down for a job interview for no reason.  <br>  <br>  Apply for jobs everywhere you can think of; hotels, resturants, supermakets, coffee shops, cafes, mall shops, convenient stores, department stores, large retail stores,  fast-food resturants....<br>  <br>  You said that you're a student; so youi might have to work around your class schedule more then you want to.  I spent my first semester in college job seaching; between and after classes.  It took an employer 2 years to hire me.<br>  <br>  The holiday season is approaching; and all employers claim to be hiring.  When you want to know if a place is hiring or not; as a manager there.  Tell them you are interest in the job, and would love to work for them.  <br>  <br>  The places that are in a hurry to interview/hire job applicants are the places with "Now Hiring" signs up.  Those places in general recieve more applications.  The more job applicants a place recieves; the less of a chance you have to be called in for an interview.  I once applied to work for a pet shop that claimed to be quote on quote "help wanted."  When I called them to follow-up on my application; they told me that they only wanted to interview and hire 5-10 people.. Then they told me that they already have about 250 job applicants waiting for interviews.  Ironically; not every job applicant can be called in for an interview.<br>  <br>  Apply for job online and in-person.  If you applyonline for a job; make sure they're hiring first.  Most of the online applications take a while to complete.  They tell the employer that you applied online for ______ position.  <br>  <br>  I will say; job searching does suck.  You will apply for jobs you are capable of doing and you will get turned down for jobs for no reason.  I handed-in about 50-60 job applications before someone hired me.  <br>  <br>  When you apply for jobs in-person; make sure you are clean, well-dressed, calm, quiet, easy-going, and ready to learn the job.  If the employers turns you down for an interview; ask them why.  If they say it's because you don't have job experience; ask them "How can I get job experience if no one will hire me?"  See how they answer you.  <br>  <br>  How you present yourself is imortant; but your personality is more important.  If you are a "big-mouth" or a "know-it-all" and blast your mouth off while applying for a job; you will be rejected for an interview....for sure....Just be calm and easy-going.  Big-mouths are huge turn-offs for employers.  <br>  <br>  I will say some employers do treat job applicants badly..  I once applied for at a supermarket.  When i asked them if they were hiring; they told me yes.  They gave me an application.  When I handed the application in; they took one look at it.  When they heard I am a college student; they turned me down for an interview just because I'm a college student.....Duh. College students need jobs too.<br>  <br>  I once applied for a cashier job at a Petsmart.  The hiring manager was hiring and going over applications.  He refused to interview me; only because I'm a white guy...not a hispanic or black female.   That's descriminate, which is illegal.  The holiday season came last year; and I applied for a job at a department store that claimed to be hiring.  I was well-presenmted again and they refused to interview me because I'm a college student.  I applied to work for many resturants that claimed to be hiring; and alot of them told me that they didn't want to interview me because I'm a college student.<br>  <br>  So many employers are rude to some job applicants; but if they're interested in you...they will treat you like gold.  Just keep trying. Don't give up.    |`|aIakDSstaa	have you tried an agency |`|OXxKTM6vaa	I'd try call centres. There not all cold calling jobs and are probably the most flexible (hours wise) for students. <br>  The pays not too bad as well + bonuses are always good.<br>  <br>  Perhaps you could try them. Jobs aren't usually hard to get.<br>   <br>  Cafes, Bars, Shops, Restaurants and stuff are also good places to try. Especially big stores like Morrisons and Asda..then theres Mcdonalds and Burgerking if you're prepared to do that kind of work.<br>  <br>  Another good way of getting a job is by asking friends to refer you. Get friends to ask at their work if any jobs are available and ask them to put you forward/recommend you. This is a good way and this is how I've got all of my previous jobs (in bars without interviews).<br>  <br>  Good luck I know how hard it is. Im in you're situation.

WniOOchkaa	It depends on the terms of the loan and what all is included in it.  Many times they do not include closing costs, homeowners insurance, down payment, processing fees, ect.  that can easily run up to 10% of the loan.  If you got approved for 300,000 I would try to stay under it at least 20,000 because that means that 300, 000 is the amount they figured based on your credit history and income that you can afford.  You need to keep as much $ saved as possibe for an emergency fund....remember after you own your own home you have to pay for all repairs.  Also, if you are getting the loan with someone else, you need to be sure that only 1 of you can afford the payment if another gets sick...you can also consider taking out insurance to cover payments if you become unable to.

AA11375099	I am so sorry for your loss, but now you need to FOCUS because your daughters NEED you to, and there is nothing so important to them now as their mom needing to BELIEVE in herself.<br>  <br>  YOU need to start with LITTLE steps, interactions with others is not a frightening experience especially to those whose JOB it is to HELP you.<br>  <br>  What gives a person confidence is the TRUST in themselves that they are WORTHY of being helped and a belief that it is your RIGHT to be served and having your needs met.<br>  <br>  So begin by the small things, buying groceries in a supermarket ask somebody where something is located, interact with the checker, demand paper bags, and ask for help out to the car.  <br>  <br>  These are all valid requests that anybody can ask and every store should honor.  It does not matter who would be asking for these services because it is their job to fulfill the needs of their customers.<br>  <br>  That is the same with a bank, a church, a hotel, a restaurant, or a police officer.  You are the public, these are public officials and know that it is their job to serve you and anybody else that needs their help.<br>  <br>  You need to not care what other people think, whatever they think it DOES NOT MATTER!  Good or bad, for anybody concerning anything.  And YOU need to realize it and realize it fast.  <br>  <br>  If your children see how you behave with others they will imitate you and feel insecure about themselves and it is you they look for guidance and example.  So, not caring what other people think is the first step because they do not matter.  What matters are your children and you having confidence in yourself because you are a worthy and deserving person and being a mother is worthy of respect and admiration.  <br>  <br>  At 51 years of age I went to Business School I was a student talking in front of a classroom of 22 year olds and I was pretty nervous because I had confidence issues.  But I realized that it is something I had to do, that it was information that they probably did not know about, and that after wards they would not care that I talked to them and would not be thinking about anything of my presentation.<br>  <br>  That made it easy for me because I did it for me, the more I did it the easier it became and the more confidence I had in doing it.  And I could see that I was improving as a presenter.  It did not matter what the other students thought of me, and as an older student I felt self conscious but then I realized that we are all trying to get a degree together and are all struggling to do our best.<br>  <br>  Life is like a school, living it well earns you a diploma.  Being a great role model for your children there is no other greater responsibility a person could ever have in their life.<br>  <br>  My wife has breast cancer, the last year has been one filled with fear.  So, I know some of what you have been going through and it is scary.  Cancer changes the focus of living, it puts into perspective of what is important in life and that is living, and then you realize that nothing else really matters especially what others think of us.<br>  <br>  Be brave, do what you need to do for yourself and your children.  Knowing that taking care of them is the most important thing and what others think is totally unimportant in life and living.|`|Trw6QiZjaa	If you are well qualified and your qualification is in demand<br>  call times job or naukri .com ask them to prepare a resume <br>  they charge for that <br>  First register in both sites as it is free<br>  If you have already a resume apply by seeing the local news paper<br>  enhance your capabilities by undergoing small courses if any if they relevant to your field|`|r0clhYvmaa	I have a real self consciousness and confidence problem too, yet with fabulous qualifications. Feel confident that everything on your resume is true. You are asking questions because you are concentrating on what is most interesting to you at the time. What they are thinking is about themselves - how do I answer this question so I look good! No one is thinking abot us as muchas we are worried they are. <br>  <br>  When it comes to the interviews, well you have been though worse, as have many people we read about in the papers. In comparison to that an interivew should be a joyful occasion, because you are getting toghether to talk with a group of people who are intersted in the same things you are - you and the job. It shoul d dbe easy. And the interview is just a fact gathering session, on both sides. There is no "judgement" or evaluation of you until all the candidates have been interviewed and notes can be compared. Hope that helps you relax a bit.|`|eACZ1Rhjaa	Act as if you were confident. Fake it until you make it.<br>  <br>  Remind yourself of your good traits. You are a mature adult, not a twit who talks to friends on the phone all day at work. You understand what people want from employees like taking care of customers. A company will be wise to hire you so if they don't the next one gets to be the lucky one to hire you.<br>  <br>  Consider the first few interviews practice, seeing where people work and what they do and meeting new people.<br>  <br>  A month isn't much time to be used to being a widow, I hope you had life insurance to help you get established in your new life.<br>  <br>  Don't forget the children will get Social Security that you can use to help raise them.|`|3CH0Y2B8aa	change your self-image. don't allow your weaknesses and insecurities to keep you from being your best. how you see yourself is how you will act in accordance with your thoughts. think positive believe in yourself. just think that no man is created perfect. <br>  <br>  ...or you may try reading books concerning attending job interviews so you'll be equipped with knowledge. try also reading books about personality development.|`|lk1Bt7i7aa	Earn Rs.2000 daily.

cfdc405defe60d37e2129e3f90174096aa	I worked with an Aussie pastry chef and he told me like here in Canada, the award rates are based on a percentage of a journeyman or certified chefs current wage, so check with the trades board and see what the current rates are, if your a registered apprentice, they have to pay you the going rate.
AA11900069	In a word, GREAT!  Tesco, the un-stoppable cash-earner, now takes over 1 pound in every 8 spent in the UK!  The spread of Tesco-Direct, replacing corner-shops/poorly-stocked convenience-stores with mini-supermarkets, will only see profits rise spectacularly for the near future, as will their on-line and in-store ticket ordering from the catalogue, Argos-style.<br>      If you have free cash to invest, put it there.|`|Saul1Bhuaa	<a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q/sec?s=TESOF">http://finance.yahoo.com/q/sec?s=TESOF</a>
20lCgb6Uaa	No, they wont wait, they want payments every month. You could arrange to get them legally cancelled altogether. Go to www.bdebtfree.info and they will help you get it sorted.|`|eO1o511daa	You can ask, but they don't have to accept.|`|zxlEveARaa	Don't forget, you owe them the money so your in control. be firm with them.|`|zqWuMcclaa	Basically you can ask HOWEVER it strongly depends on how you  ask! For example in these times it would be more costly for them to charge off the account and send it to a collection agency where they would most likely have to give them anywhere from 10-40% of the debt. It would benefit them to work with you as well as considering how long you have had a banking relationship with them. Try not to tell them too much about the situation and that you not working right now but will start in a few weeks and can start making payments then . Telling them you are in training is pointless because you still have income in their opinion.|`|kJ4g1vujaa	There was talk of a Debt Relief order (in the UK) some time ago but I'm not sure it has come into effect.  This would in effect suspend collection activity (but not interest) for a year.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/index/pressoffice/press_index/press_20061117.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/index/p...</a><br>  <br>  Right now what you need to do is make token payments to your creditors and write to them with your income and expenditure listed out showing how much you can afford.  There is a wealth of information on the net on how to do this - or try your local CAB.|`|HXW4i5Ajaa	As Daniel says, you can ask.<br>  <br>  You really need to get expert advice - get along to the CAB now and talk to them, they can help.<br>  <br>  If you want to ask for time, it will help if you can come up with a realistic plan to eventually pay them back. If you just ask someone to wait, they will probably say no, but if you ask them if you can pay this much a month for six months when you finish your training, then that much a month,to pay it all off by such and such a date, you have more chance of them agreeing.
AA10469473	Not nearly enough info.   How much did you make total?  The hourly pay doesn't tell that.  What did you have withheld?  Was all the income on a W-2?  Are you a dependent?<br>  <br>  Depending on those answers, and maybe some other things, you might or might not owe any tax, federal, state, and/or local.|`|AA10202389	Assuming you work 40 hours and are single about $500. If they've already had it deducted out of you pay, it might not be much or any. If you do a long form you might get some back. One of those tax preparers, like H+R block can be gotten to do it for free and you can decide if you want them to do it or not, if they can save you money. I don't see how you can beat that. There might be deductions you don't know about, like if you have a child you could get thousands back. Adopt for a week. LOL|`|JuPs73MFaa	idk
AfndK9LKaa	In the US it is def. a buyers market! Im loving it bc im in the process of buying my first home right now and to be honest it was VERY VERY easy for my fiance and I to get a loan for a house! And with only having to put 3% of the house down as a down payment right now you really only have to save around 3,000-4,000 (for the price we want anyway)<br>  <br>  I have also noticed how much cheaper houses are right now then they ever have been. I am loving it!|`|13vcuAIxaa	That's exactly it. Buyer's market is great right now, if you have a VERY stable job you can get a loan for a down payment, but if not: you have to save $15,000 or so. It was a lot easier to get a loan awhile back, but prices were too high. You win some, you lose some.|`|167529fb60fd91f624600021b83b22c7aa	It is a buyer's market!<br>  you'll need reasonably good credit!<br>  Go to the banks and look at their "repo's", hey want rid of them bad!<br>  Get pre-approved $$, and it'll tell ya how much you can afford!<br>  good luck|`|WniOOchkaa	I don't know about the UK, but in the US supposedly house prices have dropped but when you begin to look for a house they really aren't any lower than before (if not for the most part higher) and now the mortgage companies are putting stricter "rules" on being approved for a loan and the terms of the loan is stricter.  If you do find one of those cheap foreclosures it usually has something really wrong with it so it would've sold cheap anyways, and you end up spending too much to fix it.

What blew your mind back then? You saw something, you loved the idea, then you went home and started doing it. Go for that, get the training and don't go sideways for something that doesn't quite suit your personality but the jobs are there. Compromising early on is the key to being unhappy later on. <br>  <br>  Eg my first day at school I saw the books on the library shelves and it blew my mind that all knowledge was organised and you could go to a certain spot on the shelf and find it. I went home and put my golden books in order of author surname etc. I wanted to be a cataloguer when I grew up. I did do the library course, but few cataloguing jobs were advertised, whil there were many many customer service desk libray jobs. I ahve now gone as high as I can go in my career because as an introvert I am unable to go any further into the public speaking, customer interfacing, marketing and political networking required. I wish I had just persisted in getting into cataloguing a bit longer, because now I don't have the experience to compete with those who did.

See the instruction booklet.|`|AA10469473	None of that income is qualifying income for the stimulus payment, so for RRC.  So sorry, but you aren't eligible.

The court said state law prohibits supervisors from sharing employee tips.  I'm only guessing but I suspect if the managers directly received tips, for preferred seating for example, that would be OK and they may even be being generous by sharing those with you.<br>  <br>  Speaking for myself I always tip the wait staff 15-20% of the bill even though I may have tipped the maitre d' or wine steward separately.  In that case the wait staff should have nothing to complain about.<br>  <br>  Is something wrong with your math?  If the manager takes 50% and the two hostesses 25% each that's 100% and there's nothing left for you.
