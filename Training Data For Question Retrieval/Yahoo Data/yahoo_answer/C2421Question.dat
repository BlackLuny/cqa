I love acting; I always have. I live in a small town; with a family of 6. I really want to be an actress. My parents keep saying that I can do it if I want; and I'd be great at it; but I just won't get far here. I don't want to wait until I'm older. Like.. to go to college. I want to do it soon.

20090205090555AAGzcM1	Arts & Humanities;History	Did you know these facts about JFK?	The house select committee on assassinations (HSCA) agreed with the warren commission that oswald killed kennedy and wounded connolly, but added that there was a second gunman.    They came to this conclusion by studying a recording on a dictabelt from the day of the assassination. An motorbike officer's mic was left on and recorded the entire thing. Acoustics experts reviewed the tape for the HSCA and concluded with a probability of 95% percent or better there was indeed a shot fired from the grassy knoll. This is our own government acknowledging the fact of a second gunman. Yet still some people don't believe, and go with the lone gunman theory.    The staff at Parkland Memorial Hospital on Nov. 22, 1963 gave intimate details of the day to police. One aid present that day recalled where he found the so called "magic bullet", It was found on a stretcher not associated with this case! It had no blood, and was not deformed in any way. Ballistics experts tested bullets and proved that any bullet that hits hard, dense bone mass causing damage will be noticeably deformed.       Walter Cronkite, one of the most influential newscasters of the day, narrated for Nova an episode which was named ' Who shot President Kennedy" ? Many interesting arguments are made, and truth and knowledge about the assassination are prevalent.    Anyone who hasn't viewed this, and wishes to can watch it in its entirety on youtube.    I wish more people would become interested in this matter. I think it is important that the American public knows the truth. How can you know unless you take the time to inform yourself. They're trying to keep facts from you. You have to go seek them out! When you finally decide to do so, you'll be amazed at the facts you find. And you'll be glad you did it. It feels good to be in the know!

20090205090902AArbIQC	Arts & Humanities;Performing Arts	Which is better, Trinity or Associated Board?	My flute teacher prefers Trinity, and I'm doing grade 5 with them. She says it's better because:      -It's actually harder than the ABRSM, a grade 5 piece at Trinity is a grade 6 piece at ABRSM.       - The person who carries out the test has some experience in your instrument      - You don't have to take a theory test to get past grade 5      But I'm taking grade 2 piano, and my piano teacher uses ABRSM because she says it's more well known than Trinity and looks better on your record.                   I've only ever taken one exam before- grade 3 with Trinity. I thought it was quite easy, considering I'd only been playing for 6 months. I got 91% and distinction. Which is better? What are more pros and cons?

20090205090846AAIUBuM	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Is this good writing?	I like writing so just tell me if this is good. I'm starting from a part in my story that I like a lot so just tell me if it's good and you can imagine it. Try to imagine that the person is you, imagine the places, the things, and everything described.    I feel the cool damp earth beneath my bare feet. Droplets of water roll off the bright green leaves and fall to the ground. I gently move my fingers across a small puddle. Ripples form where my fingers just were. A bird sings from high in a tree and water roars in the distance. Walking farther still I come upon a beautiful waterfall that cascades down into the river. White foam forms where the waterfall fell. I sit myself upon a large rock near the shore. The sun beats down making part of the river look golden. I remove my clothes and leave them on the rock. I jump into the water making a loud splash. The water is cool, crisp, and refreshing. I go under and watch a small fish swim past swiftly. Back atop again for a breath of air and then I dive back down again. The sun starts setting, time to get out.    Ok I typed too much already but tell me if that was good. I'm 13 by the way. I could've changed the I's to you's and stuff but I just couldn't right now. But just imagine it's you ok. Thanks.

20090205092050AAERu4G	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	Advice on my poem and help with a title?	By Emily S.      Burning, crashing, the extreme heat,   How much more time until I must admit defeat?   Flying embers, lethal smoke,   Easily enough to make one choke.      Crawling, crying, trying to find a way out,   Losing, dying, the heaviness is all about.   Charcoal stains upon my face, severe heat burning my skin,   I’m praying not to give in      The screaming fire jumps down from above,   Arm stretched out, as if to hug me with love.   I -- I don’t understand what lies before me   Crazy red ribbons powered by an invisible wind, how can this be?      Suddenly I’m frozen, lying down in front of the warm loving flames,   Which makes me think, “How did I get into this silly game?”   Who cares, I just want to sleep,   Even though I’m listening to myself quietly weep      I start to drift off, but instead hear, “Knock, knock,” over and over again,   Opening my eyes, I vaguely see yellow men.   My weightless body is lifted from the ground,   And soon enough, I hear no sound--      No sound of the flames, the crashing, or knocking,   Nothing now, but lots of talking.   They’re talking to me, but I don’t reply.   I drift off, thinking to this world, “Good bye.”

20090205091634AAjeL3h	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	Is it considered morally relatable to follow Kants Imperetive, or rather to follow utilitarian consequenses?	Kants categorical imperetive (loosely) states that the self is the "moral judge" - the occupier of reason, and that observing the ethical action to take is carried out by summing up reasonable courses of action. In essence we take actions because we believe it is right to do so?      Consequentialists believe that a paticular moral path is taken due to one's understanding of the negative consequences and outcomes of the result of actions, rather than a view of simple "right and wrong", as humans are not capable individual judges.      Which view would you consider a more ethically relatable viewpoint?

The world you want for me.   It's not the world I want at all.      You don't care,    you want what you want   yet get it because no one dares   to betray you...the way you betrayed me.      I'm falling   falling without a cause   falling without meaning   falling all alone.      On my own, I run, trip, fall and replay   Because you can't    give me the time of day.   I'm nothing to you.      I'm so much more    than what you want for me   to show when you walk in the door.   Because I'm falling without a cause.      Falling without you   falling and can't stop.   Cause you leave me all black and blue.   You see me crying      you hear the sobs      you see the scars      you find the blades      you don't care about me.   So why can't I set myself free?      In my own little world.   I'm not falling without a cause.   I'm just a girl.   Living in her own little world.      Leaving you,   because you left me.   You yell and scream   because I left you; for me.      Cause you left me falling.   Falling by myself   Falling alone   Falling for your sorry mess.      You left me alone,   when you saw   the truth of me; of how   I deal with your nasty jaw.      I'm falling,   I'm crying,   I'm bleeding,   I'm shaking.      You don't care!   So why should I?   You don't care about my    life so why should I    give you the time of day?      Leave me alone like you always do.   Turn your back on me and leave me black and blue.   I'll be fine because now it's my time.   I summon the strength to leave you,    for me cause it's my time.      My time not to fall.   Not to loose it all.   Cause I left you,   Cause now you're all black and blue.      I was falling without a cause,   Falling for you without a cause.      Now I'm falling in my own way.   I say what the hell I wanna say.   Cause I'm falling my way,   Cause it's my day.      To fall without you.      To be alone    and walk on my own      To leave your sorry ***   high and dry   rolling in the grass   of the world you left me in.      I leave you alone   cause you did the same **** to me.   You drone and drone;   'You can't do it on your own!'      I can and I will.      Cause now I'm falling on my own.      I'm jumping when I wanna.      Not when you tell em to.      Cause I'm falling on my own and       I couldn't be happier right now.      Cause you're gone and I'm here,      So I just say 'bye bye my dear.'      - A.M.M.

20090205095549AAS6Hyx	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	Comments on a Lincoln poem for Presidents Day?	Lincoln's melancholy fueled his greatness,   one cannot take partial without the whole.   He suffered from lifelong depression, carrying     a heart that felt and eyes that saw far too much.   He penned sparse words of his malady, giving   glimpses of true insight into the man.  An   empath with tall frame and eyes that were   hollowed, who governed and skillfully led   a country with anguishes of her own.   His candle burned quickly at both ends,   yet his light shines brightly still, perhaps   because he knew how to see in the dark.

Abutre é o nome vulgar dado a aves falconiformes da família Accipitridae, de hábitos necrófagos, conhecidas também como abutres-do-velho-mundo.

Os abutres s?o largos e compridos, têm uma cauda pequena e n?o têm penas na cabe?a.      Eles só atacam as suas presas quando estas est?o sozinhas ou já mortas. Os abutres têm mais tempo de vida em rela??o aos outros pássaros, conseguindo viver 30 anos em cativeiro.      TERRA FúNEBRE   (Augusto dos Anjos)      Aqui morreram tantos poetas!

Whale Song  By Elaine Polin    My Ocean is the place where I abide  In waters vast, to live, to swim, to learn,  This harbor safe, a shelter deep and wide.    I duel with Oceans winds and then I glide,  With joy beneath wild storms, with no concern.  My Ocean is the place where I abide.    Above calm waters leaping, I confide  His fluid comfort calls me to return   This harbor safe, a shelter deep and wide.    His moods are many; in them I take pride,  He loves his children, here we all sojourn.  My Ocean is the place where I abide    Through storm and calm I swim his flowing tides,  His buoyant body where I leap and turn,  This harbor safe, a shelter deep and wide.    His movements are a never-failing guide,  To him I sing my song, a glad nocturne.  My Ocean is the place where I abide.  This harbor safe, a shelter deep and wide.

I have moved on   years of good therapy   and medication.   Maybe you should try   the same procedure.

Do you like it when the character "wakes up from a nightmare" (I'm not a fan of that)? How do YOU like a story to start? Why?      I'm not a fan of action scenes, I get bored because I don't know who these characters are so I don't usually care about them running away from anything blah blah. I think the waking up from a nightmare thing is overdone but Kelley Armstrong did it right in her latest novel "The Summoning."      I personally like opening up a book and reading funny dialogue between two characters. What floats your boat lol
20090205110622AAzvsKi	Arts & Humanities;History	How many Americans have heard of Operation Bagration?	Just reading (with some dismay) some answers to a query about D-Day, I've discovered that many Americans hold the false impression that the D-Day invasion was some sort of 'turning point'. Someone even erroneously stated that; 'the Russians were in trouble'.      Haven't any of you ever heard of 'Operation Bagration'?, or Operation Mars? Kursk? Operation Uranus/Stalingrad?      D-Day/overlord was certainly one of the 'key' battles/campaigns of the war, but it wasn't any turning point. Nazi Germany were already facing assured destruction.

I'm doing Tamoras monologue from Titus Andronicus, and although I get the story and the theme, I'm having trouble with some of the old language.. like how it should be read in terms of structure, and what it means. This is the monologue...      Have I not reason, think you, to look pale?    These two have ticed me hither to this place,    A barren detested vale you see it is;    The trees, though summer, yet forlorn and lean,    Overcome with moss and baleful mistletoe.    Here never shines the sun; here nothing breeds,    Unless the nightly owl or fatal raven:    And when they showed me this abhorrèd pit,    They told me, here, at dead time of the night,    A thousand fiends, a thousand hissing snakes,    Ten thousand swelling toads, as many urchins,    Would make such fearful and confusèd cries    As any mortal body hearing it    Should straight fall mad, or else die suddenly.    No sooner had they told this hellish tale    But straight they told me they would bind me here    Unto the body of a dismal yew    And leave me to this miserable death.    And then they called me foul adulteress,    Lascivious Goth, and all the bitterest terms    That ever ear did hear to such effect;    And had you not by wondrous fortune come,    This vengeance on me had they executed.

Kneeling naked on the floor   Obediently you sit by the door      Waiting for me to summon you   A glance, a look, anything will do      In front of you are your toys of choice   not sure which one when you hear my voice      As you leap to your feet you let your hand decide   you grasp it tightly holding it close to your side      You feel the long round shaft against your leg   You tremble inside knowing I will make you beg      You kneel again raising the object up to me   You notice now what before you didn't see      I take it from your outstretched fingers   You quiver inside and your trembling lingers      You lay on your back your eyes locked to the toy   Anticipating the pleasure the the agony, the joy      The waxing moon is high reflecting off of you and me   I can not resist a smile when I see the irony      As the flame is lit our eyes finally meet    the wax grows warm from the candles heat

20090205105623AAKCe52	Arts & Humanities;Theater & Acting	Julius Caesar Help!!?	In the first act of Julius Caesar, William Shakespeare establishes two important conflicts that will carry throughout the play. Look back in the text and decide what these conflicts are. In order to find them, keep in mind the definition of conflict.   ? Which characters are clashing with others in the story?   ? Which characters are facing an internal battle with their own thoughts or feelings?      Name both conflicts, Briefly describe each conflict, and explain how Shakespeare establishes it through the events of the play, the words of each character, and the actions of each character.         Please help me.

20090205100041AAFhAoz	Arts & Humanities;Performing Arts	Good at acting, terrible at singing and dancing. Can I make it big?	I want to make it big in the acting world. I don't really care where, but acting is my passion and there's absolutely nothing I would rather do more.   I'm being honest, not cocky when I say that I'm really good at acting. I've won quite a few awards at drama festivals and am currently in the National Youth Theatre.      BUT I am absolutely terrible at singing and dancing. I trip over my own feet and have often been told that I sound like strangled cat when I sing. I currently take singing lessons with an excellent teacher who has been in quite a few West End musicals, but so far I am still absolutely awful. (But I enjoy it anyway, despite being bad at it.)      I have quite a few friends from very good drama schools (both teachers and students), and all of them have told me that in order to really succeed in the acting world I need to be able to sing and dance because musical theatre is where all the money is at, as well as where the majority of opportunities are at. Is this true?      Is there any way I can succeed with only physical acting? Where should I look if I want to be able to find profitable (and enjoyable!) acting opportunities for a strangled cat who trips over her own feet?      Please help. :S

20090203030433AAG3jPK	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	Value of parents,..short story!...?	An 80 year old man was sitting on the sofa in his house along with his 45 year's old highly educated son.   Suddenly a crow perched on their window.   The Father asked his Son, "What is this?"   The Son replied "It is a crow".   After few minutes, the Father asked again to his Son 2nd time, "What is this?"   The Son said "Father, I have just told you "It's a crow".   After a little while, the old Father again asked his Son 3rd time, "What is this?"   At this time some expression of irritation was felt in the Son's tone and he said to his Father with a rebuff. "It's a crow, a crow".   A little after, the Father again asked his Son 4th time, "What is this?"   This time the Son shouted at his Father, "Why do you keep asking me the same question again and again, although I have told you so many times 'IT IS A CROW'. Are you not able to understand this?"   A little later the Father went to his room and came back with an old tattered diary, which he had maintained since his Son was born. On opening a page, he asked his Son to read that page.   When the son read it, the following words were written in the diary: -       "Today my little son aged three was sitting with me on the sofa, when a crow was sitting on the window. My Son asked me 23 times what it was, and I replied to him all 23 times that it was a Crow. I hugged him lovingly each time he asked me the same question again and again for 23 times. I did not at all feel irritated. I rather felt affection for my innocent child". While the little child asked him 23 times "What is this", the Father had felt no irritation in replying to the same question all 23 times and when today the Father asked his Son the same question just 4 times, the Son felt irritated and annoyed.       So... If your parents attain old age, do not repulse them, or look at them as a burden, but speak to them a gracious word; be cool, obedient, humble, and kind to them. Be considerate to your parents. From today say this aloud, "I want to see my parents happy forever". They have cared for me ever since I was a little child. They have always showered their selfless love on me. They crossed all mountains and valleys without seeing the storm and heat to make me a person presentable in the society today".  Say a prayer to God, "I will serve my old parents in the BEST way. I will say all good and kind words to my dear parents, no matter how they behave.

20090203035030AAG8b3z	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	What do you think of my poems?	Silence...         Silence falls across the land,   A struggling arm sinks beneath the sands.   The imminent arrival due in time,   When everything is foreseen, everything is fine...   That which forebodes a coming storm,   Cool as ice, yet strangely warm.      Silence falls across the land,   The Time of Testing is close at hand.   Now we shall see, whether you truly comprehend.   The nature of that which you try to defend,   Whether it is you who is bent or you who bends,   For if you know not then do not contend.   If you are ready, then answer me this:   Have you yet pierced the mist?      Silence falls across the land,   An idle finger plucks a myriad strand.   For what is Life, and What is Death,   What has come, and what has left?   When you See all things and See them True,   The Dark of Dusk and Morning Dew.      Silence falls across the land,   And so you are caught in the outstretched hand.   Now it's too late, you're out of time,   So face your judgment from one not divine.   Face the Wrath of Ice and Flame,   And nothing will ever be the same...      Silence falls across the land,   The Storm has passed beyond these sands.   All is calm so listen to the voices thine,   Everything is foreseen,   Everything is fine....         War...The Endless Cycle      Children are the future,   Yet why do people send   The future to the Battlegrounds?   Will War ever end?      Why is it that wars exists,   Why do we fight?   Why must the palm become a fist,   To do nought, but smite?      Why is it we fight and die,   When we can live?   Why is it we steal and take,   When we can give?      Why is it that soldiers fight   For Glory and for Fame?   Why do we see how we're different,   But not how we're the same?      How can we look people in the eye, and still fire our guns?   There are many reasons for fighting wars, but None for starting one.                                             Children are the future,   Yet why do people send   The future to the Battlegrounds?   Will War ever end?      Why can we not leave be in peace,   Live, Laugh and Love?   Why can't we live through sunny days,   With doves singing above?      How has the World become so Blind,   Why can no one see?   That we can live in a better World,   If we just Believe...         Why does the World Utopia, seem so Far Away?   Why must we live through Chaos, day after day?         Children are the future,   Yet why do people send   The future to the Battlegrounds?   Will War ever end... ?         Dark Descent (C.o.a.B.S)         Pain cuts deep into my soul   bursts the heart which was so full   of the endless troubles, worries and burdens   I take in life, reluctantly and sullen      For one who holds his head up high   is now made to break down and cry   A radiant sun once bright and shining   to be smothered by dark clouds with no silver lining      To ever be slowly losing touch   Be plagued by Death, yet not quite such   To hang between Life and Death   For all my joy and glory have left      To be stripped of all I love and care   Descending to Hell and living nightmare   My pride and achievements now long gone   Finding respite only in haunting song      One who was self-assured and strong   How could I have been so wrong?   Look at me, at what I've done   Look at what I have become      A mere shadow, spectre of my past   A fragment of what could never last   My envy and pride led to insurmountable cost   A never-ceasing reminder of what I've lost      I hit rock bottom and begin to burrow   Leaving a trail of pain and sorrow   Trying to forget who I really am   The Truth that I am one of the Damned.      Damned to forever walk this earth   Damned to never know joy and mirth   Damned to live but never see   What it is Life holds for me      Lost in a endless, winding maze   with the blows of Truth leaving me in a daze   A Mist of Deception blinds my eyes   Leaving me helpless to do anything but sigh...         For something still flickers, yet to be seen   But remains a mystery, a forgotten dream........      In the Dark, Alone...      To be in the dark, alone,   and never see.   What it is like   to experience life so free.      To be in the dark, alone,   And never feel.   What it is like   to have your friendship sealed.      To be in the dark, alone,   and can only hear.   What it is like   to never fear.      To be in the dark, alone,   and always yearn.   To have the flame of Love   start to burn.      To be in the dark, alone,   and never live.   Fully and see   what Life has to give.      To be in the dark, alone,   and finally see.   That this is Reality,   This is Me.      Fate...      I am the one who is always to blame   I am the one who has no name   I am the one which none can avoid   For I pull the strings, with you I have toyed   I have many names: The Wheel, A Curse, Hope, Destiny   But weep, for none truly describe me   Some say I don't exist, but then again, I might   For I am a master of keeping out of sight   There is a name, however, simple as it is   But I don't give up secrets, no, not like this   Well then, tarry not or you shall be late   For your next appointment, a one ... with Fate.

20090203042734AApmA6l	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	What is the name of this book?	It charts the life of a boy who grows up in a dysfunctional family where he is shown no affection or attention by his family. If I remember rightly his mother dies and he eventually kills his only other relative (uncle?) and stows his body in the boot of the car which is parked in the drive. As nobody knows he exists he continues to bring himself up set apart from the world and eventually goes to college where he learns to carve wood and becomes a very talented cabinet maker.      At some point he gets a girlfriend who is a hippy type character working in the local boutique shop.      He does commissions for various people and murders a few people on the way, ending up living in the house of one of the clients he has murdered. He continues to be totally without morals or human feelings and eventually manages to trap himself in the cellar of the house he is squatting in, realising that absolutely nobody knows he exists or is there and therefore is going to die.

20090205115150AA9PoGC	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	Here is a sample of my poetry..comment at will?	Dark dementions,did i mention   that my life is just a ploy,   My previous devotion was just a blight   I do not need light to take flight   Like the night owl hunting by the dark of night,my wings are my own no one else can keep me from.   The deathly wicked,were once did I mention   Angels of the light,their life was just a blight.   I sour up over the oceans expanse no wind at my shoulder,just me and my flight.   I you soar with me you must win the fight,no god no rules no king do i serve,just my purpose is what I choose to make it.Dont disrespect or take it.   No my hair isnt golden and my eyes arnt blue,my hair isnt raven black or anything like that.   Yes Ive seen you embrace,i cant win the race when i've already won,but with her it can be undone   Yes Ive seen your eyes and they tell the trueth I can see the look you get when shes staring at you.   I swear upon death I shall bleed if you ever leave.But for you its nothing new.   For me I speak the trueth.   Yes my aura is plain its average its the same   Upon my wings I shall fly today with everything done,nothings changed.   Your loyalty is true,but if not for me then you'd soar like a bird to that maidne fair.   Damn me for not having raven black hair.   These words they were spoke btu I know the trueth   i am an owl in the night watch me take lightless flight.      This was done a while ago ,and yes I am aware that it is depressing,it isnt my usual style though.

I am shortly, along with my husband and children, due to embark on some voluntary work abroad.  For this project we are in the process of setting up a website and producing leaflets/bookmarks etc.  to hand out to friends and people contributing financially.       Ideally we would like a couple of professional photographs to use on the website and printed media.      Does anyone know of studios which, instead of purchasing physical prints, allows the purchase of the copyright to the photo or at least the right to use it in the processes mentioned above.        I have sent off a couple of emails to studios and am waiting for responses, but if someone could shorten the process that would be great!  I have considered doing the pics ourselves, but experience shows that having it done in a studio with the right lighting does make a huge difference.      I'm in South Yorkshire, but may consider travelling.      Thanks for your time.

20090219114706AAEScZV	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Am I going about this the right way?	 http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...       Thats the backstory......   This is what I've wrotten so far         Prologue       The bond between sisters is one that cannot be broken. Out of all the relationships in life, sisters seem to be the most unique. There are so many times that the bond can come so close to breaking, but it never does. Sisters take on multiple jobs; best friends, shopping partners, rivals, listeners, and so much more. It is often said that sisters who are feuding or who may not know about each other share a psychic connection. No one knows if that is true besides the sisters themselves.     Only certain types of memories can be shared between sisters. They share physical memories of  washing in the bathtub together, playing dress-up, causing trouble, watching each other grow and change, arguing about who has the better body. There are social memories of boyfriends, fighting over clothes, shopping sprees, school plays, and who had the better birthday party. Lastly the emotional memories like that heartfelt advice that you need to hear, unquestioned loyalty, arguing about who is mom and dad’s favorite little girl, who gets the most attention and who got rejected.    What happens when sisters are torn apart by parents? While one sister knows she has a sister, the other doesn’t. The sister that was disowned by her own parents is going to have some type of burning rage inside of her. What if she had that animosity before she found out that her parents were going to abandon her? Is it possible that she was born fully evil? Everything in this world has two halves. Dreams, Nightmares. Life, Death. Love, Hate. Pleasure, Pain. Good and Evil. Melanie and Phoebe.      Chapter 1       Adrian and Layla Jennings were now the parents of a beautiful baby girl that they named Melanie Melantha Jennings. Adrian and Layla were high-school sweethearts. They graduated, got married and attended El Centro College in Dallas, Texas. While attending college, they both majored in Philosophy and graduated. After college Layla became a marriage counselor while Adrian became a psychiatrist. Their lives were going well but when Layla hit 30 she decided it was time for her to have children. They tried and nothing happened. They tried a couple of more times and still nothing so they visited the doctor to see what was the problem. Layla found out that she was infertile. The doctor gave her Dostinex to help her with her infertility problem. After 6 months Layla found out she was pregnant and November 11, 1987 she gave birth to Melanie Melantha Jennings.    Melanie’s birth was one that no one will forget. Her birth contained all the elements of a regular birth except there was no cry. Melanie never cried after coming out the womb, she just stared at everyone in the room. She never smiled, and it seemed she only kept one expression on her face. The look was considered to be an innocent look but it was laced with malice. Layla and Adrian held their daughter while asking the doctor for a reason she wasn’t crying. The Doctor couldn’t give them a reason, but to save his credibility he said the baby might not cry because of the Dostinex, which should wear away in a while.    After two days of running different tests on Melanie to make sure she was a healthy baby the doctors confirmed that she was medically cleared to go home.

The paperback version I got does not say if it is fiction/nonfiction.  I am thinking the historical events like the journey of the ship Exodus, the statehood part, and the battles are probably accurate.  But what about the charaters?  Ari, Kitty, Karen, Dov -are they real people or just made up to make the book more interesting.  Thanks so much for your help!
20090219120413AAUeuoV	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Looking for a fantasy book I read as a kid.?	I'm afraid I don't remember much about it. I read it almost 20 years ago. I think it involved a boy who left his home in the company of one or more companions on a quest of some kind. One of the companions may have been called Archer, or at any rate she was an archer. But I'm pretty sure that was her name as well. It was pure fantasy, set in another world, and I think may have involved some elemental sort of magic (i.e., earth, fire, water, etc.). There was a long journey and I think at some point they passed into an underground realm. That is really all I can remember. Any help appreciated!

Janet Evanovich is my favorite author, and I love the Stephanie Pum series with a burning passion. But after reading the entire series twice (and read her other works), I think I need to try more authors.       Any recommendations?   -The books are of a mystery genre but include a lot of comedy and romance.   -I like mysteries and I have tried a lot of female detective series and unfortunately they never live up to Evanovich's.
