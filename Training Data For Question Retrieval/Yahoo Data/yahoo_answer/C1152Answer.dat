Pih0VIQSaa	I would recommend painting a lotus flower with the koi. Lotus is a water flower and is commonly found in gardens with koi fish. They come in different colors, like pink, white, and orange. Not to mention it has a spiritual significance more so than cherry blossom, although I'm not sure there's a flower that really screams "masculinity" :)<br>  <br>  I included some pictures, one even has koi and lotus together. <br>  Good luck!|`|9aLNaMP3aa	Water lilies or cherry blossoms|`|dEO34fvYaa	Maybe tiger lilies. I've always thought they were pretty and they'll go along right with a koi.|`|i1Qfson5aa	water lilies very cool|`|kCJ8LrpDaa	best flower to go with a koi is actually a mixture of stargazer lillies and cherry blossom pedals, 1. the stargazers actually grow very close to water and ponds so it will be realistic as well, 2. cherry blossom pedals are a vintage japanese representation of serenity, so it will give the right feel to the peice of art.|`|jX4Byb6Eaa	cherry blossom petals.|`|H3PcFertaa	If you look at the Yakuza, and their tattoos, there's beautiful flowers, and koi, and geishas and samurai, and no matter how beautiful the image, I believe that no one would doubt their manliness!<br>  Here's some images, I hope that they inspire you:<br>  <a href="http://www.orientaloutpost.com/usa/n0243.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.orientaloutpost.com/usa/n0243...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.orientaloutpost.com/usa/n9498.jpg'" rel="nofollow">http://www.orientaloutpost.com/usa/n9498...</a><br>  <a href="http://fc13.deviantart.com/fs31/f/2008/191/d/7/Dance_of_Koi_Fish_by_RavenGC.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://fc13.deviantart.com/fs31/f/2008/1...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.kendahljanjubb.com/Current_Work/Wildlife/Fish/Koi/Lotus%20Pond%20Koi.gif" rel="nofollow">http://www.kendahljanjubb.com/Current_Wo...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.kendahljanjubb.com/Current_Work/Wildlife/Fish/Koi/Pink_Lotus_Pond.gif" rel="nofollow">http://www.kendahljanjubb.com/Current_Wo...</a><br>  <a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Az2t_X5ce0o/SKtcQBpTYlI/AAAAAAAABmI/Yw5vIpOM368/s400/SM-9-KOI-2-LOTUS-M-BALDWIN-.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Az2t_X5ce0o/SK...</a><br>  <a href="http://tattoos-and-art.com/wp-content/gallery/koi-fish-tattoos/koi_tattoo_with_bamboo.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://tattoos-and-art.com/wp-content/ga...</a><br>  <a href="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3056/3098589987_bce3225430.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3056/3098...</a><br>  <a href="http://blogs.redding.com/mbeauchamp/archives/yakuza%20tattoos.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://blogs.redding.com/mbeauchamp/arch...</a><br>  <a href="http://fc58.deviantart.com/fs28/f/2008/146/f/a/Custom_tattoo_koi_fish_design_by_WillemXSM.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://fc58.deviantart.com/fs28/f/2008/1...</a><br>  there ya go~
H6b5TbbIaa	i have 8 tats and my ears pierced.  in my heart, i think that in the year 2009 something like that shouldn't matter to people.  it's a poor judge of character.  <br>  <br>  as far as girls with tats/piercings, i'm all about it.  my fiancee has her ears pierced and several tats including a left arm sleeve of bands she likes.  <br>  <br>  the whole point, i think of any body modification is intensely personal, so if you want it, do it.  but if you do it, mean it.  i have a large back tat and people always ask why i got it there because nobody can see it if i have a shirt on.  my response is that it's for me not for anyone else.  and i can't see it without a mirror!<br>  <br>  i would say don't worry about yr boy.  do what you want to do.  but make it real and meaningful, piercings or tats.  know why yr doing it, and accept why some people may disapprove.|`|DQLSK21Naa	i guess it depends where they are like if u have to much metal on your face it would look weird n unattractive like u need a balance with piercings like i have 12 5 on each ear, belly and tongue...if u like them and want them you should get itt ..i think a lot of tattoos on girls is a bit much it makes them look less femine|`|i1Qfson5aa	ok being as 90 percent off the ppl that answered this were female seemed anti piercing im a dude and ill tell you i think piercings are hot as long as its not like 6 lip piercings or 10 eye brow rings i like em get one of each very hott to me|`|C0HZ8ZB4aa	I once had a boyfriend like that, I was smitten with him and did everything he said I should or shouldn't do. Fast forward to a few years later - he is a thing of the past, I have the tattoos I want, I had the piercings I wanted (most retired now for various reasons), and I am happier than I ever was when I was with him. I'm not judging your boyfriend, I don't know the extent of the pressure he's applying, it might be just that he's said he doesn't like it but is okay with whatever you do because he loves you. But either way - do what you want in life. If he's worth it - he'll stick by you and love you no matter what. If he isn't, then he'll be out the door or laying on the pressure thick. And if that's the case, it'll have done you a favour, who needs a partner like that?<br>  <br>  As for your question - guys are totally divided on this issue. In this day and age people are a lot more liberal, but there will always be those who dislike it. It's a shame that there has to be such a 'them and us' phenomenon about it - why people can't just look past things like that and judge on what comes from within alone is beyond me. Miss Broadway's answer is a perfect demonstration of this ignorance. People have every right to dislike. But notice how the ones who claim to have the moral highground are the ones discriminating and being hateful? When all is said and done, it's just a bit of metal, or a bit of ink. It's really very insignificant in the greater scheme of things. And you never see us criticizing people for not having body art. The judgement only comes from the other side. But somehow, discrimination and bullying is the moral highground, and those of us who have a hole or two put in our bodies or a bit of ink injected under our skin, hurting absolutely nobody else, are the immoral ones? Something's gone wrong here...|`|NScOteNraa	dont do the cheeks or anti eyebrow, get something original.<br>  <br>  <br>  but yea tattoos and piercings are awesome.|`|YtAkmjoyaa	ohhhh I love dimple piercings, but it really depends on how your face is shaped.<br>  So think twice on that one. <br>  + job hunting might be a little more challenging, since you can't hide it.<br>  As of a lot of piercings and tattoos can look good on some girls, though there will always be some guys disagreeing, but what's love if he only loves you for how you look like.|`|AYct1ZFRaa	The first answer is BULLSHEET I am very femine and have 10 tattoos and 14 piercings.....<br>  <a href="http://s654.photobucket.com/albums/uu261/Raaaaaaaaaawr/" rel="nofollow">http://s654.photobucket.com/albums/uu261...</a><br>  <a href="http://s654.photobucket.com/albums/uu261/Raaaaaaaaaawr/Tattoos/" rel="nofollow">http://s654.photobucket.com/albums/uu261...</a><br>  This is only my new photobucket so there are only a few pix.<br>  <br>  BE YOURSELF GIRL! I once had a guy ask if I was gonna take my liprings out when i kissed him. I was like "i'm a great kisser and when you get you're bookbag and leave my dorm, i'll take out my lip rings!" Hit the road BISH!|`|iZDsMCghaa	I have none but I know my husband thinks they are hot, the tattoos, that is. I think he might like some piercings but he's defiantly into tats, not my thing,though, fine on him, not me. Your cool, some are gonna love it, others hate it.|`|whO8xG4Naa	coming from a guy, it widely does depend on the man's personality. Some do, and some don't. I personally don't find tattoos and piercings very attractive. A lot of my guy friends think this way also.|`|lGnhPngOaa	i once had a partner who came very close to breaking up with me because i got an eyebrow piercing. He ended up staying with me but a lot of the time, he'd 'accidentally' bump into it and it hurt a lot. All he'd say was, 'well i wouldn't be bumping into anything if you hadn't gotten that ugly thing'<br>  <br>  lesson learned: if they cant love you even without a tiny piece of metal then its not worth it.  When i say 'it' i mean the relationship. If you want the piercing, please do it.<br>  <br>  In the long run, you're self esteem will just turn to crud because of any comments made getting treated like an ugly burden. <br>  <br>  they will do things that sometimes do not please you. you will do them the same. But relationships are about maturity and commitment, not just sticking around for the good times and bolting on the bad.|`|YHZ2vztiaa	I've got 18 body piercings all up.<br>  I love cheek pircings but I have to admit they do not suit everyone.<br>  I wanted an anti eyebrow for a while but then i realised it was surface and I didn't want to have a scar on my face where it had grown out.<br>  I think if your boyfriend respects you then he should respect your decision to get whatever modifications you want. It's your body so you should do whatever you like.<br>  There are always guys out there with that taste in woman so don't stress.<br>  Don't change because someone wants you to be a certain way.|`|E01GXmQeaa	it always amuses me how people try to change you once they get involved with you one way or another.<br>  my ex hated the idea of me getting piercings and tattoos. part of the reason we broke up. <br>  you can't change yourself to fit someone else's image they have of you. it's retarded and it won't make you happy.<br>  i hate possessive guys and girls that think they can tell their partners how to look and what to do or not to do. <br>  i personally love tattoos and piercings and i know a lot of people don't. and it's okay. just choose what's yours.|`|qjCY4Y7zaa	If someone can't except you for who you are, then you don't need to be with them. I have 16 tattoos and 22 piercings and my boyfriend still finds me attractive. And tattoos on females dont always look masculine! I have a tribal piece going down my side and it emphasizes my thin waist, actually making it more feminine.|`|bJqS9GYOaa	I do not care for piercings except on the ears and maybe the belly.  they are disgusting looking anywhere else.   And a well placed tattoo on a woman's body is very hot.    I think Angline Jolie has perfected the tattoos.   She has a lot of them,  and she still looks pretty damn hot.|`|AII8hJu9aa	if you want piercings or tattoos but care about what boys will think (or anyone in general) then forget it. piercings are for you. most people won't like them...sorry to say its true<br>  but if you want them then for goodness sakes go for it! :D|`|Nyc2WH9Baa	i dont think its an attractive look, it takes away focus from your natural beauty. peircings are ok, because they aren't always in, but tatoos are always there! i love alexis grace's or meghan corkrey's look from american idol, try something like that!|`|wUIJSSJlaa	I like lots of piercings and tattoos on anyone.  I think they look good.
GmzVS6VIaa	Definitely no-it will absorb, infect or worse--it's not soluble for live human skin. Besides, why would you want to? It will not look good trust me....it's worth the money in time, effort and aesthetics to pay upfront rather than later. You get one chance afterall. Start in increments if  you can't front all of the cash for the piece...you have better options than half-assed speedball. I think you're worth more than that!! Good luck!|`|WLuEIwp5aa	India ink turns blue or green after a while.  It's no good.  Go to a professional or if you absolutely must be an idiot and do it yourself, buy some actual tattoo ink to do it with.|`|qjCY4Y7zaa	Go to a proffessional! But I have heard of people using India ink.

tFIS2HbVaa	well, they're 2 totally different things. they're both good. exfoliants deep cleanses the pores while masks reduce the size of pores. it's good to have them work together.|`|8S2icURfaa	Exfoliant. It gets all the dirt and oil out.|`|R4CQrjwCaa	They're both good but shouldn't be used every day.<br>  You should try alternating days.|`|yIRcd5X8aa	whatever you use; use dematologica brand products|`|FIWB7Dgtaa	i like exfoliating masks

aZukucejaa	Yeah, use Certain Dri. They have one for day and night, and I use the one for night. It shrinks your pores so you don't sweat out of them. It works for me and anyone I've told about it. Its about 6 dollars and you can find it at most drugstores, and it'll last you at least 3+ months. Good luck!|`|m4q3hikbaa	If you go to the doctor they can prescibe a special deodorant for you.|`|HOdblqIkaa	Hyperhidrosis is a condition where you sweat too much. if that is the case talk to your dr and see what they can do, some can perscribe a clinical strength antiperspirant if the condition isnt too bad, sometimes you can have surgery. go to a store and find an antiperspirant that is a clinical strength. try wearing a plain 100% cotton shirt under your normal clothes, the cotton allows you to breath and will soak up the excess sweat. drink plenty of water itll dilute the sweat and it cleanses your system. <br>  <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Avoid-Sweating-Too-Much" rel="nofollow">http://www.wikihow.com/Avoid-Sweating-To...</a> this might help you with some ideas for now|`|5hIVsBx8aa	I would suggest getting degree clinical protection or dove or anything like that. basically it is prescription strength without the prescription. I use it and it is very helpful. <br>  <br>  Although, you might have a bigger problem than me, and if so go see a doctor and they will probably perscribe something even stronger or give you something else to help you.<br>  <br>  Remember, this is not your fault at all, and their is something that can help you, you do not have to just live with this problem.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|zWo03iLNaa	A girl on my cheerleading team had that problem.

I know this is going to sound awkward, but before you leave to local gym activity, but baby powder under your arms. Then deodorant. That will definitly help.

KGrMMAOaaa	change the lunch. its all carbs no protein. try a sandwich or something instead with yogurt.|`|HOdblqIkaa	you are eating quite a few carbs which if you dont work out your body will transfer into fat. add color to your diet to get the right amount of vitamins and nutrients, yellows and whites are more starchy so limit those in your diet. what kind of milk are you drinking? 2% has the highest amount of fat in it. and what kind of salad dressing? cream based dressings (ranch, dorethy lynch) are typically higher in fats. try a vinaigrette. make sure you are working out as well because if you are just eating and not burning those calories you wont lose any weight. if you were to talk to a dietician they would tell you that the food you ate today was pretty bad. you got vegetables, a little dairy, carbs, and fat. no fruit no protein. cut out fried foods and eat fresh. alot goes into diet planning so if you are serious might as well start now to build a habit for the rest of your life. <br>  try going to <a href="http://www.helpguide.org/life/healthy_eating_diet.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.helpguide.org/life/healthy_ea...</a> for some good tips on better eating and a healthier lifestyle.|`|ixmaM395aa	Whoa you eat fired potatos for lunch... everyday?<br>  <br>  Ok way to much cereal for breakfast cut it back by half & add some fresh fruit. <br>  <br>  Ditch the potato's for lunch, have a healthy salad roll instead. <br>  <br>  Dinner have some protein (meat/fish) with 2-3 cups of vegetables. <br>  <br>  Make sure you're drinking 1-2 liters of water a day and are exercising. Some cardio is enough for your age. Running, swimming, dancing, whatever will keep you motivated.|`|ri4RCtLUaa	i would eat maybe something else for lunch...potatoes are good but when they are fried...they are a lot of fat<br>  just try a simple sandwich or something not fried<br>  i would not cut out a meal...you need the nutrition...it is unhealthy to do that<br>  i would exersise more often i guess...im the same age and i am about average also [130] and i hate exercising...i just try to do more things and get up...like shopping, hiking, walking, swimming, or just doing something active with your friends...i dont do any sports. just marching band in the summer and fall...but other than that i try to eat healthy with plenty of fruits and vegetables which fill you up and are good...so good luck and dont starve yourself!|`|RbVweqN2aa	If you are muscular then that will add a lot of weight. And some people are just more solid. Thats not to much food.

Twist and pin up. You can either dry gently with a blow dryer or let it air dry.<br>  <br>  After either way, take the pins out and gently run fingers though to separate.

HvjIdW9Xaa	1. Don't listen to "I can't explain it"  NEVER USE A GUN FOR CARTILAGE PIERCINGS!!!!  never never never. It could shatter your cartilage and make it look worse than just screwing it up with the piercing itself.<br>  <br>  2. Don't do it. I speak from experience, you're too young. You don't know what you're doing, and you probably don't have enough will power to push through the pain. <br>  <br>  3. As someone answered before, you do not have the right equipment. You need a hollow gauge needle (size above what you're piercing with), auto clave (too much money) as well as the ability to study the top of your ear for arteries.<br>  <br>  You can seriously hurt yourself if you do it incorrectly. I did one of mine when I was 14 and it happened to NOT get infected and still have it 7 years later.... On the other hand, when I was 19 my boyfriend (pierces prof. on the side) did another in my cartilage and got a vein... That took about 8 months to heal... And also remember, a cartilage piercing can take between 6 and 12 months to heal. <br>  <br>  <br>  If you're smart, don't do it. You could screw up your ear, and your image.

ykP7I3caaa	Your hair is curly like hers so it wouldn't be hard to pull off. She basically has side bangs and has hers combed back at the crown. Take that picture to a hairdresser and tell them to cut your bangs like hers. Then brush the hair behind the bangs backwards. It's a little hard to explain but if you play with it going by what I said you should be able to get the general idea. Separate the front part of the hair and brush it forward, so you basically have your hair separated into two sections, one facing forward and one just sitting how you left it. Brush the part that you left backwards and leave the front part where it is. After you brush the back [called the crown] backwards and shaped it like hers, you can spray it with hair spray. Then part your bangs on the side.|`|d6959f140445530c8d381f41dd69fcecaa	Good thing you don't want hair like his!<br>  <br>  Ask her how she doe her hair.|`|msOABQbSaa	It looks like shes straightened the front section.

HOdblqIkaa	facial and massage are my favorite things. dont bother with a mani/pedi because you could get that somewhere else for cheap. a sea salt scrub or mud bath are always nice. look up the spa where you have the certificate and see what they offer to see what sounds most appealing to you. my rule is that i always get something i cant easily find elsewhere.|`|I0rOL46aaa	It depends on the quality of the spa and your personal favourites.  Personally I prefer the facials and massage parts because nail polish will last only a few days before chipping so paying for a manicure/pedicure seems like a waste (to me), but getting it without polish will be cheaper (no need to waste the gift card, haha) and you still get soft, smooth hands/feet and can just paint your nails yourself when you get home.<br>  My favourites: upper back massage, green tea/mud baths, and pretty much any facial.<br>  Hope I helped!<br>  -Alice|`|ixmaM395aa	Personally I go for a full body package. Salt scrub, facial, full body massage and whatever else the salon includes. But this is an expensive option. If your voucher is only for, say, $80 you could get a massage & a facial. Or a pedicure & manicure. Or you can pay the extra for a full pamper package. They're worth it.

gXBPLitzaa	I pierced mine myself about 2 or 3 years ago.<br>  Well first of all your going to need a nose piercing.<br>  & a very sharp needle.<br>  Make sure before you do anything you clean the needle & the nose ring really good with peroxide .<br>  This part may sound weird but it works when you do it put something like a baby carrot up your nose because you dont want to shove the needle through & poke the inside of your nose lol plus it will be really hard to get the needle to go through without something. <br>  Then mark with a pen or something were you want it to be so you dont do the wrong spot accidentaly. Have a friend or something with you so they can tell you if it looks right.<br>  You might also want to numb the outside of your nose with ice.<br>  & just try to push it through as fast as possible.<br>  It doesnt hurt that bad, but you might feel pressure under your eyes & your eyes might water a little bit.<br>  Make sure for atleast the first 6 weeks you clean out your nose ring twice a day with half peroxide & half water dont use just peroxide because its not good for new peircings.<br>  Good luck if you have any other questions feel free to email me.|`|3imLjQlHaa	If you're going to get your nose pierced, you should get it done professionally!! Even having it done professionally, I have had infections when it heals. It's normally anywhere from 35-75 dollars to get it done, and I really recommend you spend the money instead of trying to do it yourself. Then, at least when your parents see that you've gotten your nose pierced, they will know you were responsible and safe.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|COecrPrMaa	Well the truth is that you shouldn't have it done if your parent's are against it, whether you want to hear it or not.  If you ARE going to go against your parent's wishes, atleast don't get other people involved.  Your parent's CAN sue whoever pierces your nose if they didn't have permission to do it.<br>  <br>  If you are going to pierce your own nose then I would suggest looking into online information on how to do it safely (and Y!A isn't the place).<br>  <br>  Try this link: <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Pierce-Your-Own-Nose" rel="nofollow">http://www.wikihow.com/Pierce-Your-Own-N...</a>|`|TDtSZLmvaa	go to walmart and get nose studs. i have mine done and i still cant figure out the twisty ones. sooo if i were you i would get the straight ones.<br>  <br>  then get a pin like one of those straight ones with like a ball at the end (looks like an oversized ear ring) steralize it with either peroxide or rubbing alcohol... shove it through... MAKE SURE U DONT PIERCE THE OTHER SIZE OF YOUR NOSE!!!! you dont want to push it through so hard/fast that it goes through like your "bull ring" part of ur nose. <br>  <br>  be careful.<br>  <br>  =]|`|p3uxmB14aa	1. Examine your nose. Do you have any blackheads? Zits? Pimples? If so, wait a few days, or weeks, and wash your face regularly. These may lead to infection if you pierce right over, or very near, to a blemish. <br>  2. Buy a piercing needle and a nose stud. They have them at jewelry stores in the mall for like $5.<br>  3.Sterilize everything with rubbing alcohol!! Wash your hands and put on latex gloves <br>  4.Mark your nose where you want the stud to go. Look in the mirror. Does it look right? Or is it too low, or too high? Move the mark until you are content with it. <br>  5.Clean your face one more time. Wipe the spot on your nose where you're going to pierce it with rubbing alcohol.<br>  6.Open the needle packaging carefully and lock it into the forceps. 7.Only set it down on a sterilized non-porous surface like a glass plate dipped in rubbing alcohol <br>  8.Use a piercing clamp to hold the area to be pierced. <br>  9.Insert the needle taking care to pierce perpendicular through the tissue. <br>  10.Insert sterile nose jewelry. <br>  11.Congratulations! Cleanse it two times a day, and leave your stud or ring in for at least 8 weeks before changing it out with something else.|`|M0AFjotpaa	Well, there is a reason they say no! But, since your going to do it whether we like It or not, try to be clean, sterilize everything, even if it means using germex, or your going to have a Nasty looking infection and a lot of explaining to do|`|NOz2NIMTaa	I've done this myself. XD Okay, first go to Walmart and get some nose studs, they're usualyy 3 for $5. Then take a pin and pierce it, that isn;t very painful.|`|C0HZ8ZB4aa	I'm not going to say, "Don't do it because you shouldn't disobey your parents". All kids disobey their parents, and I couldn't really care less about that.<br>  <br>  However, I will say, "Don't do it, because there are serious risks associated with piercing one's own nose".<br>  <br>  The nasal area is especially prone to infection. And infections occur in an extremely high proportion of DIY piercings anyway. Also, you have no way of effectively sterilising your needle or whatever you intend to use. Burning, boiling or alcohol does NOT kill blood borne pathogens, so you are open to contracting diseases such as Hepatitis, MRSA, HIV, and so on.<br>  <br>  So how would you feel if you ended up with half your nose missing due to a serious infection? Or spending your life in a wheelchair after a serious bout of MRSA? Or worse. All because you wanted a nose piercing?<br>  <br>  If you insist on getting your nose pierced, find some way of doing it professionally. Pay an adult to pretend to be your parent, if needs be. I'm only saying this to persuade you not to do it yourself.<br>  <br>  But if you get it pierced, do you expect your parents not to notice it? You know you'd have to leave the stud well alone for a few weeks - early removal almost always leads to infection (which as I said before, can be serious in the case of the nose). Do you really think they wouldn't spot it and make you remove it? Just think it through.|`|rzue7CYuaa	Im 15 and i did mine last year.<br>  <br>  -First get a normal sewing needle and clean it with an alcohol swab.<br>  <br>  -Clean your nose with the alcohol swab.<br>  <br>  -Pierce your nose with the needle all the way in, possibly leave it in for a couple of minutes before going on to the next step.<br>  <br>  -Take out the needle and quickly put the nose stud in the whole way.<br>  <br>  There your done.

COecrPrMaa	I'd recommend not 'scrubbing', and instead gently cleanse the area with plain water.  When I got my lebret done when I was 17, it took about a month to really heal up good.  I had the same problem... itching, dead skin, etc, but it goes away.  Keep up with the Listerine and wait it out.  If it's not making any progress in a week, go back to the place you got your piercing and ask for advice.<br>  <br>  Agreed with Pip, too.  Itching is a sign of healing, not infection.  Same with tattoos and cuts and scrapes.  I think you'll be fine.

3whhpHHvaa	Firstly, I love anime too lol so nice Photobucket name.<br>  <br>  Our hair is actually not that different. The best thing I have found to use is actually clay. I think it trumps mousse because you can fix it all day. I know it sounds kind of dirty, but it's not.<br>  <br>  You add a finite amount while your hair is still wet, and it has no sign of anything having been added to it. It's soft and the hold doesn't break down until you wash it all out or you sleep on it for a full night's rest. No worries either - as far as I have seen since I started using it about a year ago, there's no residue or anything that comes off, even if you do sleep on it.<br>  <br>  I use Garnier Fructisse's Play Style Pliable Clay. It comes in a small, green container with a red top. The little jar will last you a long time, one to two months, and it's around 6 bucks.<br>  <br>  Your hair pretty much does whatever you tell it to if you use this stuff. It's really great.<br>  <br>  Happy styling, cheers.

The short answers are:  1) mix in a neutral with your haircolor which helps retain color, especially reds which can be difficult to hold; 2) use a color conditioner after shampooing; 3) use a primer-filler before coloring which helps retain color; 4) I hear using a leave-in conditioner with UV protection helps too, with the outside elements of sun, etc.<br>  <br>  If you want to color your hair, don't let anyone stop you.  Learn how to do your own hair, I promise these suggestions will help.  You'll save a lot of $ and aggravation.  If you decide you want some red in your hair, be VERY CAREFUL as you can add too much with the high-end professional lines at the least, probably not as risky with Professional Excellence for instance (see "carrot" story below). <br>  <br>  10 years ago I had my hair completely re-done at a "snobby upscale" salon, they talked me into changing my color from blonde to reddish-blonde (more on the brownish side).  I spent a ridiculous amount of money doing this ($250+ for the initial color), and root touch-ups were $60+ and they wouldn't even pull the color down to refresh the remainder.  I lost my job and asked them for the formula, they would sell it to me for $100+ !!  I then made it my mission to figure out how to do my own hair.  Besides, I couldn't stand sitting in a salon for hours.  Enough of that.<br>  <br>  I made quite a few mistakes experimenting but learned a few tricks along the way.  I get professional color from a Beauty Supply store.  Framesi works the best for me as the (increasing) grays are extremely resistant, and I typically just do the roots and use a color conditioner on the rest of my hair.  I'm a reddish (copper)-blonde and mix a few colors to get this but it is gorgeous.  I also don't wash my hair as often anymore (3x week vs. 1x week now) which helps to retain color.  Sometimes I want my hair to be more blonde but when I'm in the "I want more red" stage I run into the same problem as you.  One time I went too copper and my hair looked like a carrot; beautiful yes, but too much for me as I've always been blonde.  Sally's Beauty Supply was instrumental in getting me back to my "correct" color.  I had to lift the color very light, I think it was at least 1 level above my goal level  (they have special bleach which is not as damaging as regular bleach) and then deposit my desired color.  But, to do the color I first had to use a primer-filler which made it stick and it came out exactly as I wanted it.  Now I use Framesi which holds the best for me and get so many compliments on my hair color; one guy standing next to me at the gas pump couldn't stop gawking and telling me how beautiful it looked (haha)!<br>  <br>  With the right tools you can do your own hair at a fraction of the cost.  It takes some patience at times but you will get used to it after awhile.  Even if I had the money to spend, I would probably never go to a salon again (well maybe in an exceptional situation).  I've been burnt too many times between coloring and trims (me wanting trim, them taking too many inches OR I want color 9R and they give me 7R-big difference; actually, I think that happened at Regis Salon) because they don't listen and do whatever THEY want to do (sorry to the few beauticians who do -- you are a rare and dying breed).<br>  <br>  Sorry if I ranted on too much.  But I hope my mistakes help you and others and save you any pain and suffering.!  Good luck!|`|SdlEr5zqaa	I work at a Paul Mitchell Focus salon so I have seen all types of problem like this. <br>  <br>  There are a couple reasons why this may be happening to you. First, what is the color that it always fades to? If you dye over light hair, your hair is so porus that the color literally just falls right out. You may need to re-pigment your hair. Stylists will know how to do this, perhaps find a Paul Mitchell Focus Salon. <br>  <br>  Second, the color you may be asking for is a reddish-brown. Red is the first color to fade no matter what type of hair you have. I have seen women dye their hair red and in one wash it is gone. So depending on how often you wash the hair, you may be able to maintain it for longer than two weeks.<br>  <br>  It may also have to do with birth control or if you are pregnant. Not saying you are, I don't even know how old you are, but a lot of times the reason why women don't get their hair colored is because the chemicals react differently. <br>  <br>  Anyways, hope I helped!|`|sw2R5A9iaa	avoid the dyes and get a style you are comfortable with.|`|DMhAPurkaa	YES<br>  Used to work in a full service salon<br>  You can go back and have them do a re do.<br>  You paid for permanent<br>  and 2 weeks isn t even semi permanent<br>  Semi permanent is about a month and it fades out.<br>  They will do the color again for free.<br>  2 things they can do... they might have used a 20 volume( peroxide)<br>  or 30 volume and you may need a 40 volume peroxide to "lift" open the cuticle enough to let the color in the shaft break down, accept a new one in, and then they will wash it out in cool to close the cuticle. It takes 3 days for the cuticle to completely close, so your color will fade a little till that time. Now if you are on certain meds, or pregnant, or a natural redhead, this may help, or they can do a bleach, then put color on top of the very light hair... this is damaging, but if you are careful, do your deep conditioning treatments, don tuse heat appliances, blow dryers, straighteners, curling irons too much, and be careful of your shampoo, do use a moisturizing one, or just wash with egg/water mixture like in Asia. Take Biotin. Eat eggs, the yolk has biotin in it. Take calcium, magnesium and zinc. These all boost hair strength.<br>  Back to on certain meds, pregnant, or a natural redhead, these three sometimes have resistant hair follicles.<br>  It seems like nothing will lift the hair.<br>  In cases like this, you can get hair extensions that are a different color chunked in, (expense) or just go to Sally s , or even Wal mart, and get some clip in hair in a different color for chunking in, or to mix in, like a pony tail, or you can twist it into a messy bun, or whatever.<br>  I don t know why hair turns into Super hair and wont take the color, but when i was pregnant with my second, I had the same problem.<br>  How irritating. <br>  Some women that were pregnant couldn t hold onto nails when I d do them either! Too much moisture in their nail bed, lift right off!<br>  Some would get 5-6 months along, and whew, nail bed tooooo tender!<br>  Good luck, tell them to re lift it, ask for a day they are not too booked so they will have the time to do a good job.<br>  Or invest in some clip in s. <br>  Or fun fake braids, or?? There are so many nice alternatives I know you can do something fun! Sorry this is happening to you!|`|JRRsjByCaa	yes, this does happen. some types of hair just don't hold colour. for instance, my boyfriends hair does not hold dye very well at all, we dye his hair black every so often to keep it dark but within a few days you can see pieces of his hair that reject the colour and jsut fades within weeks.|`|YQZoGNOYaa	yeah red will fade big time. and ironically it can be a pain to color over, too. i've died my hair a dark reddish brown for years now, sometimes myself, sometimes professional and it always washes out some. sorry!|`|Mo2J38uAaa	Buy dye in boxes.

(use a toner after you wash every night to help balance oil)<br>  3. moisturize (every day after wash and tone) <br>  <br>  4. vitamin E face mask weekly<br>  <br>  <br>  i would recommend using a vitamin E or aloe based face regiment, seeing as you need the most moisture possible. <br>   <br>  check out www.thebodyshop.com for cheap natural based products.

qxrr69bnaa	I've seen some cheap lotions in Sally's for around $10.  You can also find some of the "better" lotions sold in the salons on eBay.  Most, if not all, of the sellers are salon owners.  <br>  <br>  The Caribbean Gold (try Mind Eraser) line by Australian Gold is inexpensive and gives good results.  A lotion with body blush will give you a "sun-kissed" look for a little money.  Love Monkey is a good lotion containing body blush.<br>  <br>  You need to keep your skin moist after you tan.  Use a good moisturizer.  I prefer the silicone-based lotions like Enamour.|`|f8bf26c17d2b021c337d130648b25311aa	Most places wont let you use your own lotion because brands other than the ones they sell may stain the bed.

7c63ef82a9b12c820787a1f534edd972aa	Have you considered seeing a doctor to help with your skin and scalp problems? They have better things than you can just go to the store and buy. If your hair is too thing and fine to hold a shape you might want to try a body wave in it. Get one on big rods so you just get some shape and not real kinky hair. You can have your mom or a friend do it but the first time it would be good to get it done professionally and ask them for advice on what you need. Don't just go anywhere. Talk to some friends and ask them what hair place or person is helpful and listens and does good work. Make up can help cover stuff up but most of it is bad for your skin. You might need a good dermatologist to help get rid of the skin problems and then go some where that they do free demos or makeovers and tip them good if they help show you how to do it.

The high pressure bed is going to open your pores, so that the spray solution will go on deep and evenly. It will also help your spray tan last up to two weeks. <br>  <br>  If you don't want to spray, then I would suggest doing 5-6 sessions in a medium pressure bed then a high pressure.|`|5hIVsBx8aa	ya it would be obvious, especailly since it is march and it hasnt been too sunny.

If you have a Mervyns, they always had great wedges in size five. Target of course is great. piperlime.com has great wedges, but they are pretty expensive. Still awesome. When Macys has their shoes on sale, they always have size fives, just a few, but I always find great BCBG and Jessica Simpson wedges for cheap.  You really have to go shopping a lot to find them, as stores only order a select few of size 5s for some reason. So peak in to different stores often.|`|mUhjNZtmaa	payless. American Eagle.

(like im going to put some red in my bangs, which will be badass. haha)<br>  if they don't understand, just bring in some pics of what kind of style you want. <br>  oh, and you could straighten it if you wanted, im sure that would look sexyy<br>  hope that helped =]|`|gKQDNpS3aa	your best bet would be to bring in a picture!<br>  your hair looks kinda short so you're gonna need to straighten it like every day... just ask them to leave the front longer and thinned out but cut the back short a spiky. i don't know if you can color your hair, but you might bleach some of it. then it would look more "scene" i think..<br>  you could get something like these! <br>  <br>  <a href="http://content2.myyearbook.com/zenhex/images/quiz47/231395/231395_res1_sexy.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://content2.myyearbook.com/zenhex/im...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://s.bebo.com/app-image/7926171234/5411656627/PROFILE/i.quizzaz.com/img/q/u/08/08/04/41.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://s.bebo.com/app-image/7926171234/5...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://s200.photobucket.com/albums/aa64/SceneLife444/?action=view&current=l_9e72da1608a31f2b807528ef9562cf39.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://s200.photobucket.com/albums/aa64/...</a>|`|NOz2NIMTaa	Do it yourself?

cF2Wa1tqaa	its pretty normal for it to get swollen after its pierced, my snake bights swelled up pretty bad for like 4 days|`|HvjIdW9Xaa	Holy crap... It's not infected unless you have an unusual amount of puss coming out of it (not just the crusties). Also, if it's not bright red and warm, it's probaly not infected either.<br>  <br>  Swelling is NORMAL. I had a fat lip for a week after I did mine. Some places are more sensitive than otehrs when it comes to swelling or no swelling. <br>  <br>  Keep rinsing your mouth as your piercer directed. If you're truly that concerned about it, get off yahoo answers and ask the person who pierced you. They'll know 90% than half the people on here|`|eVY7Oilbaa	You just had a needle shoved through your lip.<br>  It's going to swell up a bit.<br>  <br>  But I wouldn't know anything about piercings.<br>  It might be infected, and if that's the case no big deal, you'll probably get a shot from the doctor and that'll be it.|`|XaYHMNusaa	You just had a needle put through your lip, of course it's normal to be swollen.|`|V9bejh2baa	I think it might be infected. It's very common and if you don't get it treated properly I hear it could even kill you.|`|BA0N0Hgzaa	NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO...that means it is infected|`|HOdblqIkaa	any damage done to the body will cause swelling, this includes tattoos and piercings. if it is swelling to an uncomfortable size or is leaking anything then it could very well be infected. the reason a piercer puts in a bar bigger than normal is to give room for swelling, which normally goes down in a few hours sometimes days. if you just got it done within the last day i wouldnt worry, if it was in the last week then i would assume it is infected. make sure you are cleaning it properly including salt baths and no smoking. try ice and an anti inflammatory, if the swelling hasnt subsided in a day then go to a dr or your artist. infection from a needle can be severely dangerous and you dont want to ignore any signs. it could be the metal of whatever was placed in the hole. a good artist knows to use only the best metals which does not include silver and nickle.|`|1ba96d5712bb7b62869d2c341295e4b7aa	usually alot of piercings are swollen after its pierced but it could have a chance of infection..|`|9e3mxs6waa	its probably infected <br>  get some glyoxcide i think it's called i used that for my tongue ring and it healed better than freaking listerine<br>  but yea, disinfect it watch what you eat and get on it<br>  don't touch it with your hands unless you just washed them , common sense stuff.|`|rin6JBSmaa	probably infected, you should get that checkedd :]<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090307181459AAxO4yS">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a><br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090307181459AAxO4yS">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a><br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090307181459AAxO4yS">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a><br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090307181459AAxO4yS">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a><br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090307181459AAxO4yS">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a><br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090307181459AAxO4yS">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a><br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090307181459AAxO4yS">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a><br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090307181459AAxO4yS">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a><br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090307181459AAxO4yS">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a><br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090307181459AAxO4yS">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|AkFIVDjQaa	yea it's normal,<br>  the swelling will be gone after 3 days<br>  just don't smoke or drink alcohol, & clean it properly|`|MSzjOOOjaa	INFECTION BABY

HOdblqIkaa	ive always heard you should only vary one cup size when going up or down in sizes. too much will look fake and could give you back problems. if you are at a small B now then go to a small C, if that is what 400cc brings you to then go for it. they might look a little weird on you because you are tiny but once the swelling goes down then they should look natural.|`|tEy9hvebaa	the most common complain post surgery/recovery is they didn't go big enough... maybe 450cc?|`|pcjaqM4Caa	Hi- since you are so small and petite, I would stick to staying at your normal cup size.

Sometimes covering up brown eyes looks a little weird.  Unless you want to freak people out a little bit, you'll want your eyes to look as natural as possible.

GdxA8cs9aa	To answer your first question, it is so hard to cut it because you have had it for so long and because long hair is a powerful symbol of youth and femininity.  And you know that once it's gone, you'll likely never grow it back to that length.   But it sounds like you have been thinking about cutting it for a while and that you are ready to let go of your long hair. Long hair is beautiful, but as you know, a lot of work. It can be very hard to let go of hair that you have had so long--many women do get upset, have nightmares, and even cry at first when it is cut--but that is normal, and after a while they realize that cutting their hair was for the best. Short hair is much easier to take care of and looks more mature and sophisticated.  If you are married (don't need to attract guys any more and don't need long hair for a wedding) and have little kids, considering short hair makes sense.  Managing classic-length hair is a lot of work.<br>  <br>  Consider going to a good stylist just for a consultation, not yet for a cut.  Many will do it for free, and they will be eager to help you with your transformation because it is such a big step.  Tell them what you want--something that is short and easier to care for--and see what they suggest.  If you really want something easier, don't make the mistake of cutting in stages or just cutting 12 inches or so.  Mid-back length hair is still going to take a lot of styling and drying time, and you'll have to go through all the nervousness and anxiety again to get the easy care short style you want.  You want something well above your shoulders, like a bob, so you don't have to worry about ponytails, buns, or your hair falling in your face.  If you're really brave, consider a short pixie which will be truly wash and wear.<br>  <br>  If you still want to cut after a consultation and picking a style, my advice would be to  make an appointment at the end of the consultation to have your hair cut in about a week or two, and stick to that commitment. That will help avoid the problem of never going through with the cut.  Between now and then, celebrate your beautiful hair by having some pictures taken and wearing it down or in fancy styles.  It sounds like you enjoy your long hair, so have a last hurrah.<br>  <br>  When the time comes, take someone with you to the salon for moral support. Have the stylist brush out and braid your hair dry, or braid it yourself as part of the ritual of saying goodbye. They can cut the braid at the nape of your neck quickly and easily so it will be over fast. Plus, you can keep your braid as a memento of your long-hair days. (Don't worry about donating; Locks of Love won't take dyed hair and they sell/trash most of the hair they get anyway.  They're not so great.)<br>  <br>  Another option if you're really anxious is to have a friend or your significant other do the first cut at home in a more private setting just before your appointment.  You get to braid your hair one last time, and your helper makes sure you go through with it by cutting the braid.  Then you and your helper can head to the salon with the hard part done with. <br>   <br>  Then the salon can wash your hair and you can be less anxious now that the hard part is over and focus on them creating your new style.  That's the fun part.<br>  <br>  Short hair will feel wonderful and freeing once you're used to it, and you'll probably never want long hair again and wonder why you waited to cut it. And it will look great, and if you pick something daring or stylish, you'll still get compliments from other women.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|lU8e0VQFaa	Since it's so long you could cut of 8 or 10 inches and not really notice that much of a difference, plus then you can donate it to Locks of Love. <br>  <br>  But I know what you mean about having nightmares, my hair was always super long like yours and I'd have panic attacks about getting it cut. Kept it that way until I was in college and then I just cut it all off, like almost to my chin. It was cute and I liked it and it was easier to take care of but now after 4 years, I want my long hair back, just maybe not to my but long, lol. <br>  <br>  Just remember, it's hair, it WILL grow back, that's what I always say to myself when I'm getting it cut.|`|uj1A73ZGaa	I think you just get attached to it, and you worry about if you do get it cut you worry about how it will look and all.<br>  <br>  I grew my hair out from my jr I was 16-17years old til this past December when I was 24 and donated my hair to Pantene Beautiful Lengths. Their requirement is to only have 8inches. But I ended up donating 16inches. I cried but then my two year old daughter looked at me and said "mommya its okay theirs kids that don't have hair. you look pretty with short hair"<br>  <br>  Good luck. Maybe you could just donate 8inches and see how you like it and if you want to donate it again you can.

It doesn't match at all. Each piece- the shoes, accessories and the dress look like you took them from different outfits and threw them all together. The shoes are inappropriate for the dress, a nice flat or cute little heals would fit much better. The shoes would be more suited with jeans and a button up shirt. Then the headband, necklace and belt don't match and their quite random. They would also fit better with an outfit like I recommended with the shoes or maybe a skirt type outfit. It's not that the pieces are ugly, it just doesn't match..each piece belongs to a different outfit. Personally I don't like the dress, it's not my style, it's very young and I'm a teen and it's not a dress I would dress someone in personally sorry, maybe my 2 year old sister.<br>  <br>  I hope I helped(:|`|VZhhJ648aa	im not a big fan of the belt maybe if it was a ribbon and in the blue color that is in the dress, also I would wear flat slip flops with it|`|sLC47VOZaa	I'm really, really sorry, but it's horrible, doesn't match and well, ew!

qrpcHKO2aa	go to sephora or mac macy at any mall then get ur make up done there probly for free.|`|b0AvMRqbaa	Lilac eyeshadow, or mix a lilac/purpleish colour with brown. Green would also look good. If the colour is too strong tame it with a natural brown eyeshadow. Either a little stroke of eyeliner close to top lashes only or a coat of mascara. Whichever you're more comfortable with.

vLAaeKmdaa	Okay, my friends did this back when I was in high school and it was hilarious. There were three girls and they were Rock, Paper, and Scissors.

0xO8Y98uaa	You have the same problem I do.  I'm 23, but often get mistaken for a high school student.  How nice, especially considering I work in an office building full of people who initially thought I was a workstudy intern.<br>  <br>  I find that "dressing smart" will help, and a little bit of makeup (not too much, or you'll look like a little girl trying to look older), and be sure to highlight your cheekbones with a little bit of blush.  <br>  <br>  Leave your hair down, or tie it back loosely.  I think pulling it up looks more youthful.|`|FxrRIaO3aa	Why don't you put foundation on, and use a darker shade of lipstick? <br>  You could also curl your hair or put it into a pony tail or something. For the eyes you could go for a darker shade or try the 'smokey eye' look.|`|aRYwnafWaa	Dress in want you want to wear :) If your comfy in your waist-high skirt and black heels, then wear them! I'm sure you'd look gawguss in whatever. < And yeah, its a good idea to take your ID, just in case.<br>   (L) Dolly ,x|`|UIhqGzidaa	My advice is just be who you are. Embrace the fact that you look younger than you are. When you are 56 you will wish you could look 26.|`|AA11002791	Actually, there are guys that like very young looking women.  You might want to keep going with that.  Enjoy your youth, because it won't last.|`|cW7xfPqUaa	i would say wear a cute tank top, heals and skirt to match. Curl your hair and leave it down.|`|iRKtKpSyaa	You should love looking young. I'm 25, and I still get ID'd for cigarettes.|`|PwkVl3ymaa	enjoy being young come on now|`|jxg88KqFaa	Bullshit you look 16|`|ZiptAXJQaa	Just go as you please. You're 26, so you know better than anyone, what a 26 year old should dress like, and you should just go with your gut. But, you're NOT wanting to look 16,  you should just stay away from current teenager's trends. The most highest fashions are considered "young" so stay away from them. Like what you were decribing in the details, sounds pretty current to me. So, you should most likely stay with simple. Like a pair of jeans, a nice top (stay away from patterns and bright colors, they are percieved as juvenile). You should wear a top in the color of elegance and sophicated, maybe white, gray, or black. Use a timeless style, a classic style, and one that will never go out of style. That always makes a person look older (in your case, your age). And wear simple heels, nothing flassy or sparkly, or anything like that. That can also be seen as juvenile. So, keep it simple, and go with what you like, it's your best bet. Your face shape (i.e. having a fat face, baby fat, or just overall childish look to your face) can't be changed. You'll just have to live with it, just like I do. Also, height can't really be changed, either. If you're short, ofcourse wear heels whenever you have the chance, and that's about it. You'll be fine. You should take it as a complement when a person asks for your I.D., because it's better to look younger then to look older!!|`|sw2R5A9iaa	don't dress in the current trends and enjoy your youth.|`|q2hq1jr2aa	Note:<br>  umm im not sure about yahoo avatars but apparently your a male, im just saying im not judging ... form the description your wrote im guessing your female but im not sure<br>  <br>  and seeing that i haven't got a clue what gender you are, and apparently neither do you then i cant help you, sorry but good luck with your gender issues|`|TepAZAHyaa	You do realize your contradicting yourself in this question right?  You want to look younger or older? It don't matter what you do. When I was 35 I was still getting carded Wear what you want and just be you, if your REALLY of age and have proper ID you should take it as a compliment I know I did.|`|GaLw1qMwaa	be glad  you look young, would you rather it be the other way around??<br>  <br>  put on some make up and some professional clothes.<br>  dont wear teenager clothes or any clothing that someone under 25 would wear.|`|VEgv5NhSaa	Put more make-up on, dress really fashionable and act mature :)<br>  x|`|FeRC5jkoaa	Theres no way you look 16, hahaha.. I dont buy that for a second.|`|aBwQ06A6aa	I think ur outfit is good. For the eyes, do the smokey eye. And you hair, you could take some of the front strands of ur hair and pin them up in the back. That would make u look older.  If u ask a question like this again, a pic would be helpful or a description of u.<br>  <br>  Hope i helped! :D<br>  <br>  <br>  Hey Darren Clark shouldn't u know how to spell already?|`|FtTx6cLdaa	don't worry, you will look fine!

lU8e0VQFaa	A dye remover, like color oops, will take your hair back to the lightest color it's been since it removes the dye particles from the hair shaft. When you're washing it out you need to scrub like hell though for like an hour. It will look light right after you put the stuff in, this is a lie, the dye partilces have just been shrunken and so you can't see them, if you don't scrub hard enough they won't come out and your hair will re-darken over a few days. Yes this will damage your hair, but a really good deep conditioning treatment should help, as will a couple of inches cut off the bottom. You could also bleach it out, but that would cause just as much if not more damage than stripping.<br>  <br>  Assuming you haven't done anything else to your hair, this should take it back to its natural color.|`|a402885910549caddf0eb474b891f438aa	STripping is the same as bleaching so your hair would be blonde again

Have your hairstylist make it all the same length.  Adding layers in the back always add volume so your hairstylist will have to get rid of the layer.  Also, straighten it- it will get rid of a lot of the volume in the meantime.|`|mYNuP9Kvaa	Okay. You take small sections of hair all around your hair and cut them closely to the scalp. This will definitely thin it out. I do this all the time and I always get compliments on how pretty my hair is.|`|bxKRfCZXaa	you can have  it layered or they do have this shaver thing at the salons and they thin your hair. my sister's hair is so thick and i was born with thin thin hair haa good luck hoped i halped|`|Dcv2hWaIaa	tell your hair stylist to make it thinner<br>  they have a special blade they use[:

kCdISEGqaa	Don't expect it to be free.  I guarantee my tattoos against artist error, that's what most shops do, not if the client doesn't care for them.  When you leave the shop, with the care instructions, it is up to you to be careful with it and not let anything happen to it.  Your artist may charge you, just be ready for that.  Please don't try to lie to the artist and say you took good care of it, artists can tell if a tattoo was taken care of properly.  If you're honest about it, they may do it free or cut you a deal, but don't expect it to be free when you go it.  Best wishes!!!|`|bg86ji6naa	depends on where you go and size.|`|WLuEIwp5aa	Might be free, depending on the shop.  Adding to them will cost you, though.<br>  <br>  And when you get them touched up, DO NOT WEAR JEANS for at least the first week.  I wore pajama pants and sweat pants and other loose stuff when I got a tattoo on my hip bone and it healed up fine.|`|LBHJaqXoaa	You should go back to the shop you got tattooed at the first time - most of the time touch-ups are free. Sometimes they charge you for the set-up and the needle, but that shouldn't be more than $30 tops. If you want it added to, then it will definitely cost you more. But if you go to a different shop than the one you got it done at, it will cost you about the original price of the tattoo to get it re-colored. I would go back to the same shop and ask them about it. <br>  <br>   Next time, wear loose fitting skirts and pajamas and sweatpants until you are all the way healed. I know it's hard, but it's just something you have to do to get good quality ink. You can go 2 weeks without jeans in order to have a nice set of tattoos, right?  Good luck on your touch up!|`|d9B4EVFxaa	usually if you go back to the artist that did it the first time they will retouch it for free!!

fXjlWQO6aa	after you shower, dry your hair with a cotton tshirt instead of a towel. it sounds weird but it really works to cut back on frizz. in the morning, first straighten from the roots to about 3 or 4 inches down. then put some VO5 anti frizz cream. that's the best brand in my opinion. and scrunch hair up GENTLY. i have naturally wavy hair too and this is me after i followed this exact procedure:<br>  <a href="http://i124.photobucket.com/albums/p29/mandyl53/l_89c984e8d93e4d379c53b14cbe5be480.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i124.photobucket.com/albums/p29/m...</a>|`|iDMGBT8Vaa	i know u tried mouse but try a refressing one like paul mitchell(its great) get your hair damp, apply the mouse(do this at night) and put it up in a messy bun on top of your head. sleep with it in and in the morning give it a quick blow dry to firmen in mouse and u should have nice curls.(i have very long, thick hair that curlers and the curling iron wont even curl it) this works amazing on  any type of hair. good luck|`|mZBctgn8aa	okay i have the same thing but i use mane and tail shampoo & conditioner and then flip my hair back and forth and let it air dry. dont brush it after or else it will frizz.|`|2V7aIVv1aa	I know the feeling, I hate my hair. It's like right in between curly and wavy. But it's not either - so it looks awkward. I straighten it everyday, and I wish I could just get it to be curly. As you said - it gets frizzy. I'm thinking about getting a perm, or just using alot of anti-frizz.|`|ReNJZwQuaa	Im the same way, and I hate gel and mousse. I just rub in some leave in conditioner and anti-friz stuff and it works great!

HOdblqIkaa	you should have bought the proper cleaning supplies before you did that. did you sterilize the needle? did you wash your hands and the area getting pierced beforehand? if not then you are at a higher risk of infection. the best cleaning solution is salt water. take 1/4 tea spoon SEA salt (not table salt) and dissolve that in a cup (8oz) of warm water. dip a cotton ball in it and wipe around the ring, twisting it a bit but do not take it out. do that 2 or 3 times a day. clean with anti bacterial soap and warm water and always have clean hands before dealing with the piercing. <br>  do not use rubbing alcohol or regular alcohol to clean with as it will dry out the piercing. these kill bacteria, but they also kill new flesh so it wont heal.|`|ER8L9croaa	do not use alcohol! prepare a warm sea salt (not table salt) solution and soak ur ear in that for a few minutes. do that twice a day for a few weeks.<br>  dont change the earring until its healed, probably a good 6 weeks or so|`|hi1kVUtdaa	use alcohol but if it starts turning red or burning or if it gets itchy, you need to tell your parents because it could be infected and you have to see a doctor.|`|BKUhGTHdaa	Listen to Bean.
XrMMH5tZaa	assuming ur from CA<br>  no<br>  even with legal guardian approval you have to be 16<br>  its child abuse otherwise|`|kCdISEGqaa	First, no you can't.  Only a few states allow tattooing of a minor with parental consent, and even those states are staring to crack down on it.  Even with parental consent, you must be 16 in most of the states that allow it.  You're way too young, your body is still growing, plus, do you really want a Batman or Spongebob tattoo when you're older?  Come on!  No respectable shop will do it, even with parental consent.  <br>  <br>  What state are you in, I will tell you if you can or not.|`|WLuEIwp5aa	Most states that allow tattooing of minors require you to be 16 and have parental consent in order to get a tattoo.  However, most shops just don't bother with anyone under the age of 18 for liability reasons.|`|qxewMAZoaa	yea you can but u need to know a guy|`|jp9OzuXoaa	If your parents allow it and your state allows you to get one with parental consent.|`|qs9QHvy9aa	theres more than one way to answer this.  First:<br>  <br>  1. Can you.  The answer is yes, but, only with parental consent.  And most reputable tattoo artists won't do it even with parental consent.  Your probably going to end up with a second rate artist doing your work, and thats never good.<br>  <br>  2.  Should you.  The answer is no.  I have a lot of tattoos, don't get me wrong, I'm not against them.  Heres what I tell my friends when they ask me about getting a tattoo.<br>  <br>  A. It should not be from a sporting team<br>  B. It should not be a name.<br>  C. It should not be from a music group.<br>  D. Draw your design up and then, wait a year.  If you still want it, then you can begin thinking about it, if not, be glad you waited that year before having it stuck to you<br>  <br>  Why shouldn't you get a music group or sporting team?  Simple, as you grow older, the team, or music group you got, may no longer exist, and now your stuck with a tattoo that has no meaning.  <br>  <br>  Like I said, I am all for tattoos, they are a great way to express yourself, but get something that means something to you.  Mine for example are all Irish based, because I am 100% irish, and they are all symbols of my heritage.  I can't stand seeing someone with a new tattoo and I ask them about it and they reply with "it was on the wall at the tattoo shop", if you didn't create the design yourself, its not going to mean much to you later in life.|`|1N3wmqz7aa	Yea illegally.  I know a couple of kids that got tattoos underage because they had friends of friends who were tattoo artists (without their parents knowledge)<br>  <br>  You could also get one it Mexico or abroad...<br>  <br>  If you aren't willing to break the law though you'll just have to wait till you're 18, or get your parents to let you.|`|dUeDmb7raa	legally no<br>  <br>  <br>  but there are shady places all over that don't give a crap<br>  <br>  <br>  i got a tattoo at 16, i regret it to this day<br>  <br>  <br>  i went to hollywood though, if that helps|`|eb1eB1hCaa	I think it depends. or if you have your parents permission then i guess its okay. idk though. but hey, you want a tattoo at 15, then go for it.|`|237ab7a90e5b9d51488ea4a1c42d65dcaa	Even with your parents, it depends on the parlor and artist, some won't do under 18 no matter what, while others just require them there.|`|cRjRZ2lEaa	only with parental permission.|`|M7pYJhmZaa	You would neeed permision|`|G2NoXxDVaa	if your parents are with you|`|AMvR4u2Taa	If you have a legal guardian with you. Before you even get a tattoo though you should make sure it is something you are willing to commit too! IT IS PERMANENT! Ask yourself these questions . . .<br>  <br>  Is it something I will be ashamed to show people?<br>  If i get a office job how will it look?<br>  If it is someones name will I be with them forever?<br>  What will my future spouse think of it?<br>  Is it something I can look at everyday?|`|WUhE9Vi0aa	it depends on the place. if your going to a good place thats well known they'll only do it for 18 or older. if youre somewhere not so well known, they probaly would do it with or without a parent.|`|0LGAL3eraa	with parental permission, they will need to sign.|`|6ri7AYC1aa	You have to be 18 to get a tattoo, even with parent permission.|`|kFOxlebDaa	If your guardians are with you and give permission.|`|j5279HVsaa	You must be 18 unless you have a parent with you who will provide consent.|`|dTcbssGoaa	18 or have parents permission|`|JhIckFOXaa	if you have parental consent.|`|E638ukebaa	No, and tatts are cheap and nasty.|`|Hhj0cwqQaa	Only if you go with your folks|`|xnJxMaq8aa	not unless your parents there|`|sEKebwuHaa	if parents are with u|`|ns1F0p8Laa	you shouldn't

Get to know him first.|`|1keH3R6paa	Well, this is up to you. Usually you have to find out if it's true whether or not if he's a jerk. Go straight to the source and find out yourself. Don't rush things; you haven't met him yet. Introduce yourself by saying you've seen him around a lot. You can't judge what you barely know! Hope I helped.|`|N14eaRPFaa	you should try to get to know him a little then decide for your self what he is like. You might not have a chance but if he is nice you may have a friend|`|XJ6RxMQIaa	I would let it go. I've never met a sophomore guy who wasn't a total jack***. Not to stereotype, but its true. Plus, lets be real, would anything ever happen?|`|pMrLplHRaa	You should meet him before you judge him, but also don't go at it like you are wanting to date him right then and there.  Just find out about his personality and his tendencies, so you can make an informed decision about going farther.  Just beware, he is a little older, and that is not always a good thing|`|vPtoTavxaa	I'm in 8th grade too and I used to like a sophomore.  He was nice though and he treated me like a little sister.  I think of him like an older brother now.  You should talk to him and see what happens then.  like if hes a super jerk you could just forget about it.  but if he's nice then you guys could go out.|`|AHQQknmSaa	i think you should listen to what other people are saying about him.. and dating someone older isnt a good idea when youre still in middle school. it makes both of you guys look bad. and its probably not a serious crush...ive liked somene a lot older than me when i was in eighth grade, and ... it didnt work!!! he is probably only interested in looks, or has bad taste to be going after 13 year olds...|`|f6coyafAaa	Go with your heart, not your head. Don't listen to your friends, investigate for yourself! If he turns out to be a nice guy, then you can get to know him more. If it turns out you don't like his personality, then just leave it! ;P But remember, follow your feelings, not what other people say|`|DePNsFRbaa	Only thing i can say is go with your feelings if you like this dude.It doesn't matter what anyone say.Remember there is always haters!|`|r0ZiwS8qaa	Chance. He might suit you, no matter how much he doesn't suit anybody else ;).|`|0LluF4WUaa	trust your heart. Maybe he is really cute but someone in your school probably thinks the same about you. Maybe just say "hi" to him and see his reaction. there are other fishes in the pond, but remember your a fisher girl so don't let your line get to deep in the water or else you might pick up a shark. If you see this guy giving crap to other people, chances are he will give you crap too! ask your friends  (whoever told you he was mean" what he did to deserve the name "mean." Hope this helps fisher girl!|`|TQZjLMhKaa	same exact thing is happening with me right now. I'm in 8th grade too and i like this guy who is in 9th. I know how hard it is to just forget about a guy that you really like, even though you don't personally know him. I think that you should give him a try. You will never know what you're missing out on unless you give hime a chance. <br>  <br>  good luck and I hope it all goes well for you:)|`|CySJ2krdaa	I say that you should give this guy a chance. You said you dont know him so I'm guessing he doesnt know you. You should try and befriend him first because then hed know you exist at least and maybe he'll warm up to you and you'll then know if u would want to date him. And you never know if hes a jerk or not because for example, I have friends that people dont like. It happens. But then again if people dont like him for a legit reason don't go to far with him because that would be bad. And like someone else said you dont want to have a bad rep, sorta especially going into high school and such...

If I want mine really curly, after I shower, I put in a little bit of mousse, and then take small sections and twist them around my fingers until it looks almost like my hair is full of dreads. If you keep twisting them like this until it dries, it will encourage your hair to take that shape. Then your lightly run your fingers through it, and you have lovely curls. They're not really kinky, but they are soft and romantic looking. I'm not sure how well it will work for you, but it makes my hair look lovely. It's worth a shot.|`|xNjtfXcuaa	DON'T DO A PERM!!!

It's that big funny looking piece you stick on the end of your hair dryer. I purchased it for 10$. You can get some of those like at walmart but I wanted to buy a professional one.<br>  <br>  All I do is but a little bite of mousse in my damp hair and turn my head upside down and strat drying my hair. Make sure NOT to comb your hair with your fingers..Put as much hair as you can in the diffuser and have the diffuser touch your scalp or almost touching. Bring it up and down like your scrunching your hair but the trick to nice curls is leaving it almost touching your head.<br>  <br>  Then hairspray your hair and keep scrunching with your hands this time. ...It will give you a messy curly look. You can even go in with a curling iron and curl random pieces here and there.<br>  <br>  Looks hot!!!!|`|ZF670FX1aa	For kinky curls you need to use some sort of curl activator.  You can find one of these at your local Target or Wal-Mart for around $3.  Once you get out of the shower, you apply the curl activator to damp hair, and scrunch your hair up.  This should create great kinky curls.|`|6gshK9A1aa	i have really fine hair, and its sooo hard tyo curl it. but when its damp french braid it, then take it out in the morning and schrunch it with hair spray.|`|yhGz4sO8aa	get curling irons and curl it.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090227095221AAEsrYw">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|dUnDqrmtaa	you can buy  a hair curler they work well.

HOdblqIkaa	its not possible to keep your facial muscles still at all times. you move your face constantly even when you dont notice it. there are creams that you can use with collagen in them to help fill in the lines and reduce appearance over time. <br>  try using a moisturizer daily<br>  doing an at home peel each week<br>  and drink lots of water to keep your skin hydrated and firm<br>  wear sunscreen whenever you go out
Q4oPyclQaa	I say get your hair cut a little shorter. It also looks like the ends might be damaged, so the trim will help.|`|bg86ji6naa	try something not so Feminine.

r8VvBxM6aa	I have the same features as you. Depending on how old you are, tour make up style should vary. Basically though when it comes to eyeliner what you want to do is make it "blend" in not to the point that it's faded but just enough to look like it wasn't painted on.<br>  <br>  after you apply a stick eyeliner to your bottom lids wait about 10 seconds then smudge it using your finger (gently) orr using a eye shadow brush to smudge it<br>  <br>  for eye shadow you can try a neutral beige tone just to highlight your eyes and if you want eye liner on your top lid liquid looks best. what i usually do is first use a eye pencil on my top lids and then retrace it with liquid eye liner. this helps it from becoming uneven bc the pencil is easier to control and easier to trace.<br>  <br>  when it comes to concealer/foundation/blush. start with concealer, just put it whereever your skin tends to get red. while you let it dry you should be doing your eye liner. after youre done with your eye liner go back to your face and put foundation on. apply it with a sponge/fingers. either one works. just make sure you wash your hands before hand. then let your foundation dry. and while youre waiting do your eye shadow. after that add blush to the apples of your cheeks and finish up your eyes and youre set<br>  <br>  i know this is long and it sounds like a lot but it takes 20 mins tops.<br>  <br>  the key to putting on makeup well is dont rush. let everything dry before you layer something on top of it.<br>  <br>  btw i've started an advice column on youtube about questions like this. if you want to check it out and comment whatever other questions you may have i'd be glad to answer them. :)<br>  <br>  just go to youtube.com and search for thatbrowngirl890<br>  <br>  or go to the link directly<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqlEYydebvg" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqlEYydeb...</a>|`|8aQ7cEY9aa	Honestly, that's how I was at 13.<br>  first of all i would say liquid eyeliner!<br>  it's bold and sexy if done right.<br>  guys like it more.<br>  make a thin line above your lashes, starting in the inner corner really thin, getting slightly thicker the farther towards the outer corner. <br>  most people who use liquid eyeliner put it underneath their bottom lashes, but it looks so much better if you take the "spongetype tip" of the liquid eyeliner and put it on your inner eye, but more into the lash line to prevent from leaking into your eye. and if it does leak it doesn't hurt. just practice.<br>  mascara i would use lashblast from covergirl. DO NOT let dry inbetween layers. dry=clumps.<br>  use concealer on red spots, undereyes if dark.<br>  i've found that almay foundation and concealer work well.<br>  (:|`|YJlYBmdQaa	How old are you? If you are a kid I would go with just masara and lip gloss. Two easy applying things. For the mascara by the kind with the electronic twirling brush so it does it itself.|`|MUEMs2ataa	Do like a smudgy look|`|ZbLa5lHdaa	Okay, this is what you should do a step-by-step process. It works for me, and It's amazing.<br>  1. If you want foundation/concealer use your color liquid mousse. apply with a makeup sponge.<br>  2. use a power with a nice round brush, apply all over face as well.<br>  3. put some dark blush on [not too much, just a little] to make it look very natural. <br>  4. put some natural colored eyeshadow on, all over the eyelid. <br>  5. on the outside of your eyelid apply a few tones darker eyeshadow to make your eyes look bigger.<br>  6. put lighter eyeshadow on the inner corner of your eyelid. <br>  7. make sure they're all rubbed in nicely together.<br>  8. apply mascara.<br>  9. once they're dry, curl your eyelashes with an eyelash curler.<br>  10. I recommend not using any eyeliner... just becuase it makes you look sort of trashy.<br>  11. If you want, use a clear lipgloss.<br>  <br>  ejoy!|`|ed8b21c184331ef0c9646d80ad48a5e6aa	Haha, I used to have a HORRIBLE time putting on eyeliner...it looked all squiggly and weird. The trick is to pull out the corner of your eye (Asian eyes. I don't mean that to be racist) so it's taut, and then put on the liner. It helps to use an eyeliner that goes on smoothly. Keep the pencil sharp to decrease the thickness of the line.<br>     For eyeliner, I use New York Color and Rimmel, both available at Target. Neither one is expensive- I think NYC eyeliner costs about a dollar and Rimmel costs about three. They're both in regular pencil form and come in like ninety million colors. I would suggest a plum color for you, but it's your face...do what makes you happy = )<br>  <br>  Mascara is easier. To get your eyelashes really long and full, put the mascara wand at the roots of your eyelashes and WIGGLE it. Then brush up or blink, either one works. I've also heard that applying mascara to the top of your lashes makes them look longer and fuller, but I haven't actually tried this.<br>      For mascara, I use NYC Curling Mascara in black, and I LOVE it. It makes my eyelashes thick and long without making them spidery at all. But I have really thick eyelashes anyways, so I can't guarantee that it will work the same for you.<br>   In the end, you're not even thirteen. I didn't start wearing makeup every day until I was almost 16. I have a thirteen year old brother, and he doesn't like makeup on girls. I should probably also let you know that boys are usually pretty stupid and can't tell if you're wearing makeup anyways, unless you wear too much.<br>  <br>  Remember- Practice makes perfect = )|`|b4rSSPDAaa	You would be surprised how just mascara and a great lip gloss( like juicy tubes, MAC, or Covergirl gloss. Loreal Telescopic in brown or black really brings out the eye for a natural girly look. Covergirl Lashblast is pretty good but be careful... it can get a little clumpy.|`|Jh0yyYizaa	At 13 years old, it begins taking practice and time to figure out the makeup look you want. <br>  <br>  Here are some eyeliner/mascara tips in general:<br>  <br>  - Twisting the mascara as you apply it will help curl your lashes<br>  <br>  - Liquid eyeliner will stay on better than pencil eyeliner but it is also harder to apply<br>  <br>  - Don't plump the mascara tube as this will cause it to dry out<br>  <br>  - Don't apply more than 5 coats of mascara, this will result in spidery lashes and won't be very attractive.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped.|`|X3QbcIUwaa	I can understand where you are coming from.<br>  <br>  With your colouring I would suggest golden or silver eyeshadow, applied with your finger, as this way it looks more natural.<br>  <br>  For your lips try a pinky lipgloss, which you can also apply with your finger.<br>  <br>  A bronzer would look great in your cheeks.<br>  <br>  Body Shop and some make up counters can offer you a make over.<br>  <br>  Also, why not spend a weekend out with your mates or mum, just trying out make up?<br>  <br>  You'll have fun and experiment with colours.<br>  <br>  For proper make up lessons, go to you tube and trype make up lessons/tutorials.<br>  <br>  This way you can try out different looks at the privacy of your home.<br>  <br>  Remember:less is more. You don't want to look like a drag queen.<br>  <br>  All the best of luck.
AA10708751	since ur 14 im guessing that u dont have the money to spend on an exspensive straightner. so i suggest to take a paddle brush and a blow drier to straighten your hair. it might take longer, but it'll save alot of money. it works just as well as a straightener. <br>  <br>  i suggest to put your hair 1/2 up 1/2 down or put 2 big braids on the side of your head and fasten them in the back while the rest of your hair either hangs down flat or curly. <br>  <br>  hope this jelps if you need anything else juss email me|`|4PLC1aEJaa	<a href="http://www.a1-hair-straighteners.com/globalbeauty.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.a1-hair-straighteners.com/glo...</a><br>  <br>  this straightener is a little expensive, but it is definitely worth the money.

If you have conditioner at your house you will need that, some thin rubber bands, and a brush. First, take a shower and put a TON of conditioner on your hair! When you get out of the shower don't dry your hair. Braiding is easiest when your hair is wet. Brush through your hair and start to braid. If you want tiny braids then take smaller pieces of hair instead of larger pieces but the most important thing when braiding is start high on your head and braid TIGHT! Tie them off with the rubber bands. If your braids start to get frizzy or dry spritz them with water or condition them. The key to healthy hair is CONDITIONER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! But however if you really can't do this at home and none of your friends know how either then I suggest another method. Get a good conditioner. They don't cost to much. Under 10$ for sure. Usually under five. Condition your hair a ton and I suggest you use panteen. Also, your hair may be dry and brittle because you are overheating it. The best way to keep your hair healthy is let it airdry, don't curl or straighten it, and condition a lot. Good luck!|`|L1EnPN67aa	First, you need to worry about your real hair. You need to go a hair salon when you get some money and have a hairdresser put a treatment in your hair, moisturizer, and trim and cut off all the dead hair. And give you a nice style with your own hair. Then you can worry about getting braids. <br>  <br>  If you get braids with your hair like that, you're still stuck with that hair you have underneath. Take care of your real hair first. When your hair begins to grow underneath the braids, you'll have some healthy hair and try not to get it done too tight. And always oil your scalp. Doo Gro products are great for black hair. Doo Gro oil is nice for your scalp when you've got braids as well.<br>  <br>  You can try an online job, sell stuff on ebay, go find a job at a fast food restaurant (not trying to be insulting, but they're always hiring). <br>  <br>  Then if you get a job, you can keep up a real beauty regimen, Because if your hair is like that, your wardrobe and your nails might need some help also. <br>  <br>  If you go church, you can always ask someone there if they would give you a discount or something, because people might be a little kinder there when trying to get a deal or something, <br>  <br>  If your friend's parents do hair, also ask them. And work out someway to pay them, if you don't have money. Be creative.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps a little.|`|6sJhoXAAaa	Maybe you could make a deal with a friend, like she braids your hair and you help her with (chores / homework / babysitting, etc.)|`|9e3mxs6waa	find a friend and see if they can give you a hook up<br>  i mean im pretty sure they wouldn't leave you hanging.<br>  try that......|`|1c33e4f123cf1ac6b35006a8a8e7d688aa	braid it yourself.. but otherwise wash it and possibly cut of the ends.|`|B6EpHU1Waa	Ask a friend.

0LhAYSyvaa	Well, you have two options.<br>  <br>  You can bleach your hair and then dye it the shade you want it. <br>  *Warning ; That causes more damage to your hair, thus strands of hair will come out if you brush out a not a certain way,I would know.<br>  <br>  And your other option is to go a lot darker brown.<br>  And gradually get to the shade of brown that you want.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped :)<br>  --Rora|`|aClEgPgMaa	It will still look black except for your roots unless you strip the black out of your hair.|`|xFeGxPtoaa	Orange hair is sexy.|`|wjcpXgAIaa	she would have to use a color stripper to get the black out, then dye it.<br>  <br>  you cant dye over black hair and hope it turns out bright.<br>  <br>  <br>  And if your friend is a professional she wouldn't be using box dyes, she would be using a dye and a developer.|`|s4psKJrPaa	it wont turn a different color, but go a shade or 2 lighter cuz your hairs black.<br>  <br>  mine? <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090307183046AAhvbWi">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|wB8C1Zbkaa	It probably will go some weird colour, so try a darker brown first, and progressively go lighter, or just test a little on a bit of hair to make sure it doesn't go all wacky|`|VypzmRTkaa	use a color stripper before to be 100% sure|`|GdgHSFY4aa	uhm.. black is a really hard color to change back into a lighter shade.. i know becuz my sister dyed her hair black and every now and then she colors it one color lighter.. like black to dark brown to medium brown to light brown.. and so on .... becuz as it grows out when you color it and your roots r lighter it will be easier to make the color change.. o dont go to a really light.. just take it little step by step.. i would try dark brown hair color... :D good luck|`|FVEXxD83aa	no it won't<br>   i dyed my hair black and then tried to redye it and it didn't dye over the black at all, only your roots will dye<br>  so i had to go and get the color stripped out and depending on your hair it might work. it didn't 100% for me but it was  lighter|`|NgAaenfuaa	Uhm, it most likely will.

2ZsRAxkuaa	Rings always make a bigger hole. Another reason why studs are better. But you could have torn it a little.<br>  <br>  But I'd definately go find a different piercer for a different opinion, as bruised doesn't sound so great.<br>  <br>  And remember white pus is a good thing!|`|lU8e0VQFaa	You NEVER remove an infected piercing, that traps the infection inside and lets it fester, usually making the problem worse. Just because it "feels fine" doesn't mean it was healed, your piercer gave you instructions for a reason. You probably did tear it slightly, and there's a good chance it may have a slight infection. Keep doing sea salt soaks for the out side and using a alcohol free mouth wash for the inside. For the swelling ice it for a while a couple of times a day. Did you tell your piercer that you were giving your guy head? If not then he didn't really have anything to go on except for the fact that everyone bruises and swells differently. <br>  <br>  Follow what I said and if it doesn't get better in a few days go back to your piercer or another piercer and fess up. If you can't then you'll need to see a Dr for some oral antibiotics, or if it isn't infected (make very sure it isn't though) take it out and let it heal and then have it redone a few months later.|`|6ri7AYC1aa	It's definitely sounds infected.<br>  Go to your doctor!!!!<br>  They can give you medicine(probably antibiotics) to help with the infection.<br>  But until you get to the doctor just continue to clean it and try not to mess with it.<br>  And ice will probably help with the swelling.<br>  <br>  But seriously your best option is the doctor.|`|rdMGWgZBaa	It's probably infected. You have to see a doctor, or things may get worse.|`|BPrMusoLaa	Okay, so I have mine pierced too and Ive had it for almost 8 years now so.... Your lip is infected and if it isnt it will be if you dont take care of it now. I feel you I like to take care of my man too but you did not wait long enough to do that. You have to think about it. Your mouth is the wettest part of your entire body point blank which means its more likely to get infected especially if you give oral sex. Without any piercings you can catch an std of whatever in your mouth if you dont use a condom or if you do and dont use the rubber properly. You can actually catch an std including some forms of cancer in your mouth and throat quicker than if you have sexual intercourse. But he was right just by talking with it in your mouth you can get bruised because in all actuality it is a open wound. You most likely did rip the piercing while you were taking care of your man and didnt know it. The first day I got mine I ripped it while I was talking to my uncle and that **** hurt like hell. It turned purple and swelled up but no puss. Until u get to a doctor just rinse with ur salty water and use some listerine as strong as u can stand and youll be okay. Try not to eat things too hard(no pun intended)or sticky that will get stuck in your teeth because you will be surprised. Even when U rinse your mouth sometimes things are still stuck to the ring. So when it stops hurting use your tooth brush to softly clean ur lip ring. Oh and you might wanna buy a new toothbrush anyway because it is a open area and any little thing can get in there and cause an infection. Sorry its so long but i think I have good advice...........OH AND TELL YOUR BF Back off and control his self until you are healed cause if not hell be waiting much much longer the next time.............DIVA D HOLLA!!!
QAE1gu5jaa	i have my touge piersed,,it will stay swollen for about 4/5 days and then should go down ,after a week the swelling should be almost gone completly and you should be able to eat but it will still be a bit uncomfortable eating but not as painful as it is now. After 2 weeks u wont even notice it in your tounge but keep it in for at least a month b4 u change the bar!!! my touge feels weird now when i take it out bcuz i have had it done with a year now!!:):)..oh dont eat too much dairy,take panadol/neurofin medicine to take the pain away and try not too be moving it up and down in your mouth 2 much!!|`|BPrMusoLaa	I dont have a tongue ring but I think it will take at least a week. I have a question for you and everybody else with a tongue ring! How bad does it hurt when u get it done. I started sweating so bad when I was supposed to get it done years ago and I chickened out and just got my librae done. Now that I didnt feel at all until I went to talk and it got stuck on my teeth. I still want it done now! I wanna know from you how it honestly feels and if I should do it. People be lying saying it dont hurt but come on its your tongue and I dont know about anyone else but mine is very sensitive...so on a scale from 1-10 what was the pain like when u first did it and what is like now from 1-10|`|b6qe5syVaa	just suck on ice cubes that will help with the swelling. thats all I did for the first few days! it was kinda funny cause my tongue would go numb and i would start to droul! lol   just give it some time, and be sure to clean it properly!|`|qlepHpX0aa	when my sister got hers done it was sore for like a week then it gradually got better, but when she got hers done i had suggested to her to get sugar free popsicles to rub around it cause you have the control over it instead of something just moving around in your mouth and you should get sugar free so the sugar doesn't irritate the piercing.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|wZzgX3bBaa	omg yeah im having the same prob. i jus got mines done yeterday and it hurts really bad today. my sister said pain goes away in 3 days and my friend trevor said the more you work on eating and talking right the faster it will heal|`|YyOSSuHvaa	about 3-4 days maybe. it will probly hurt depending on wat you do with your mouth. try not to bite your tongue or anything. (:
jb4YWxvqaa	This is my personal opinion and I am a guy, so please spare me benefit of doubt.<br>  <br>  I think I like tattoo to be placed on somewhat sensitive areas. Areas where when they get kissed, you'll be overwhelmed with excitement.<br>  <br>  I would suggest to place the tattoo at your back, between the shoulder blade and your spine. That's the 2nd least stretched part of your body.<br>  <br>  To me ankle is a place where it's least stretched. However, if you look further in the future, IMHO it wouldn't look good when you turn 50 or 60.<br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  List of less stretched part of body:<br>  1) Ankle<br>  2) Upper Back (Btwn shoulder blade and spine)<br>  3) Upper-Center Stomach (area right below your torso, at the last rib bone and in between your breast. Even though you get pregnant, that part doesn't stretch)<br>  4) Foot<br>  5) Front Thigh (Not inner or outer thigh, those area stretch)<br>  <br>  --------------------------------------<br>  When your skin is tight and if you are looking at short term I think tattoo looks great/sexy on:<br>  1) Upper-Inner Thigh (Give others a feeling of 'Now you see it, now you don't)<br>  2) Neck (From behind the ear to your top most notch of your spine)<br>  3) Lower Abs (Closer to your crotch)<br>  <br>  Those areas are like what I mentioned at the top, somewhat sensitive areas.<br>  ------------------------------------<br>  <br>  In a long run, tattoo certainly look great at your back between your spine and your shoulder blade because it's not only sexy, but it's the best place tattoo can be even if you are old. You can hide it easily too if you want.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|u8WYmZRgaa	I have always loved foot tattoos, they don't seem as trashy as alot of other placements. They seem so elegent! As for lower stomach, I wouldn't recommend it if you don't want to have stretching problems, because it will happen! I know you said you don't care about pain, but my tattoo artist told me that he has never even completed a tattoo around the stomach muscles because the pain is so intense, people can't handle it.|`|ZQdn9xMPaa	First thing is first, I Have a tattoo on my pelvic bone and youre right it is cutre, but you are also right, it stretched when I had my son, not too bad, but it is noticeable. Secondly you want to stratigically place tattoos where you can show them off, or cover them up easily if you want to. How bout your shoulder blade on your back? other than that Id go with foot, Ive always thought they were cute|`|lMcjDJg0aa	Here's a wacky idea:<br>  Why don't you go with not-so-permanent tattoos, I mean you're still young, why would you tag yourself with something that you may not like in a later period of your life?<br>  It will definitely stretch with pregnancy and you will pay a lot for a good laser tattoo removal.<br>  <br>  (I was just trying to be honest with you, that's all)|`|Z10Oed2faa	have it on your foot<br>  would look nice but you may hae to have the other done to look right with it<br>  im not to kean on swallow unless its on the collar bone area<br>  <br>  Feet were the easiest for me to have tattooed and didnt hurt as much|`|u0eTvggDaa	i have one on my ankle and it didn't hurt as bad as i thought it would, and i heard it hurts pretty bad near the pelvis as well. i would go with it on the foot.|`|LYxCuCWhaa	Yes, it's true that the bonier the area, the more concentrated the pain.<br>  <br>  And to answer your initial question, I would suggest getting your tattoo on your hip. I had the same concerns you have with that location [in the event I ever change my mind about wanting kids], so I decided to get the image I wanted literally on my side. It hurts a lot worse, but it looks just as good and it's out of the way of stretch marks. It's also easily covered by shirts.<br>  <br>  Imagine your body in terms of front, back, left profile and right profile. I got mine dead center on my hip when you're looking at my left profile. Maybe you could do something similar?<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|qaiKG1Z2aa	How about your shoulder, near or just over your shoulder blades. I have two tattoos and with my first, when I was 19, thought about what and where my tattoo would be for a few months. Once they start there's no going back, and its gonna be with you til you die. So make sure you know WHAT you want, and WHERE you want it. My second I had designed especially for me, I don't regret my first but if i knew i was gonna find someone to design the second one i got, i wouldn't have gotten my first one. If you do decide to go ahead, then fine, its your choice. But make sure you eat something beforehand, and make sure you have some sugar in your blood. The feeling you'll get when you get the tattoo will be a shock to your body, so get your levels up. I would recommend a small one for your first, as a large tattoo for your first may make your experience not a nice one. I don't think a tattoo on your stomach will get ruined if you were to have kids, but check with the tattooist you plan on going to. Also, check that they have the certificates, and make sure the place is clean, and that the needles are sterilized properly. Good luck, and hope you enjoy your tattoo<br>  <br>  P.S - Any tattoo comes with a bit of pain, but the less flesh there is, the more it will hurt, for example over the spine area, or the wrists where there is barely any skin|`|6L9jJnchaa	Once you get pregnant, it absolutely will be ruined forever.  I have tattoos in all three of those places, and the one that still looks the best, has not faded, and HURT the least, was on my ankle.  The foot was HORRIBLE to get tattoos, and it fades pretty quickly, I've had to get it touched up twice.|`|LBHJaqXoaa	If I were you, and I was afraid of tattoos stretching during pregnancy, then I would get it on my ankle. Its easy to cover up, easy to show off, and it will not stretch during pregnancy and weight gain.<br>  <br>  And it is true that tattoos over bone hurt a little more than tattoos on fleshy areas. But, tattoos hurt no matter what so it really doesn't matter where you get them.|`|QGZBlceuaa	I have a simple swallow on my ankle... I love it. I get compliments on it all the time, and I can hide it easily at work.<br>  <br>  Yesterday I got a new tattoo on my other ankle with a very detailed pendant that went right over the ankle bone area. It hurt more than any other part of that tattoo when it was going through shading. It's not unbearable though, and all tattoos, to some degree, hurt.<br>  <br>  Good luck on your ink! :)|`|AA11447210	I've got 4 tattoos so far, one more planned (at least).<br>  <br>  1. Outside of left ankle<br>  2. Lower abs between navel and hip bone<br>  3. Right side of torso<br>  4. top of right breast<br>  <br>  Foot is an option, ankle, anywhere on your back, chest/breast, inner arm, back of hand, back of neck...those are areas you are less likely to experience stretching either from pregnancy or weight gain over the years.|`|tX27e0UFaa	do it under your arm on the side of your ribs. Thats a good place for a swallow...  but it sounds small and if you are a bigger boned person then do it on your foot!|`|gu0AxKyiaa	ribs, hip, are the best to places to get a tattoo for a girl that is
AA10803040	I think your cut already is very bold, I like it. *:)<br>  <br>  But if you want something with a little more *BOOM* then I'd suggest looking up Special Effects hair dye and cutting your hair into a shaggy pixie.

wXh4QpaYaa	I have never had this done, but I remember seeing something on television about some guy that was out of prison getting his prison tattoo removed.<br>  <br>  If I remember correctly, there will have to be several sessions, because the lazer is pretty much breaking up the ink and your body is desposing of it accordingly. It may be that you will have to wait a week or so to actually see any result from the procedure (if I'm not mistaken, your skin is probably a little puffy and may scab over).<br>  <br>  Just be patient, keep it clean, and don't pick at it and you should be fine. :)|`|WLuEIwp5aa	Depends on the ink used in your tattoo, the skill of the artist who did it, the amount of time you've had it, and the type of laser used.<br>  <br>  However, the next day is certainly too soon to see any results.  The lasers are breaking up the ink in your skin so that your immune system will go in and get rid of it.  You have to give it some time for anything to happen, but chances are good that you'll have to go in for several sessions before it will be gone or anywhere near gone.
vwOwnjUiaa	in my experience with waxing, and i am new to this, have been waxed three times in four weeks.  waxed on a friday, then again two weeks later, then again two weeks later.  my hair does not seem coarse when it is growing back in.  and i have found it to be a very relaxing experience.  i have had my legs, my underarms and my bikini area waxed.  <br>  the person who waxes me taught waxing for 13 years at a local beauty school, and she said hair grows in three stages, hence the three waxes in four weeks,  i am scheduled to go again in three weeks, and she figures after that, i will not need to come for another 8-10 weeks.<br>  i guess we are all individuals, and hair is different, but i will tell you this, i will never pick up another razor!!!|`|57j6hSjNaa	That depends on your genes.

WLuEIwp5aa	Read this: <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Gauge-Your-Ears" rel="nofollow">http://www.wikihow.com/Gauge-Your-Ears</a><br>  And regardless of the title of that article, you're stretching your ears.  Gauge is just a unit of measurement.<br>  <br>  Regular earrings are 18g.  You need to go to 16g.  Skipping sizes, even when the jumps are relatively small (18g to 16g isn't much, but 2g to 0g is a lot) is a really bad idea if you've never stretched your ears before.  You'll end up with a blowout, scar tissue, or even an infection from a tear.<br>  <br>  You can find all kinds of jewelry online, I like bodyartforms.com because you can get their 'poor man's stretching kit' that gives you a taper to the size you want as well as some plain surgical steel plugs to wear.  Remember to never wear a taper as jewelry, they're a tool and shouldn't be in your ear for more than 30 minutes or an hour at most.<br>  <br>  Do your research and be patient.  You need to wait at least 6-8 months after having your ears pierced to begin stretching, and you need to wait at least a month between the early sizes to allow your ears to heal.|`|6CMfKxiMaa	everyone else pretty much summed up the answer, but you could also take a slight amount of tape and put it on the earing so you can stretching it out a little at a time, plenty of my friends did that for part of their stretching process to save money on rings because the money adds up if your stretching them a long ways. but always always wait for it to heal fully, and then some. it's a long process but getting infections, or just straight up making your ear extremely sore sucks as$|`|1haKToUeaa	Mmk, the best advice I can give is to wait until the piercings are completely healed, that should take about a month to a month and a half.  Then you just have to be VERY patient, I know it's a pain in the ***, but you can't rush it, I went from a 14 to a 10 then an 8 then a 0, then a 1/2 inch and now I'm going to a 5/8.  What ends up happening when you skip sizes or rush the gauging process is that you'll tear your ear open, sounds gross, but I did it twice and now it's harder to go bigger because there's a bit of scar tissue that doesn't stretch that easily.  Also, it looks weird.  I'm not saying that you have to go out and spend $20 a pair on a ton of gauges, there are cheaper alternatives.  i.e. you can use straws and pen caps or even markers or what I'm doing now is slowly wrapping my 1/2 inch gauges with electrical tape until they get up to 5/8.|`|1rHmtCdLaa	your ears start out as 16 but wait til your ears are COMPLETELY healed before you do it because if your ears aren't healed then you can really mess them up like i stretched mine too fast and 1 of my ears got really messed up and yeah i wouldn't do more than 2 gauges at a time cause then you risk blowing out your ear (which i also did) and then wait a month between stretching and if you wanna get cheap plugs you can to www.bodyartforms.com good luck =D|`|BKUhGTHdaa	Please do a lot of research before stretching (that's the proper verb, 'gauging' is not a word), you can permanently disfigure your ears by stretching improperly. You won't get all of the information you need on yahoo answers. <br>  Also realize that once you go past around 2g, you can't get your ears back to standard size.|`|hDn15T0Laa	getting your ears pierced starts out of 18...<br>  Go to 16, then 14, then 12, then how ever you want to go.<br>  And if you don't know anything about it, maybe you shouldn't do it...God, I hate wanna be emos, because they gauage their ears.|`|WZK2tKJ8aa	Yes, you're right, you started out at a 20g. And as everyone has stated, wait atleast a month to a month and a half in between each stretch. Althought going from a 20g to a 16 or even 14 isn't too bad because its not a huge jump, but the best way to do that with out taking a taper and shoving it through your ears is to get a heavy style earring or keep your regular ones in and play with them daily by slightly tugging on them in every direction. This will cause it to stretch out and you'll be able to get the next size in. It is a lengthy process but that's ok, it'll prevent tearing.
57j6hSjNaa	It's safe, but it doesn't make sense. If your going to get nose reconstruction done, why accessorize your nose now?<br>  <br>  You should pierce it after your nose is completely healed after the surgery.|`|HJGgVvkvaa	Why not wait to after the nose job is done and heeled? Perhaps after the new look you will change your mind on getting it  pierced.

WLuEIwp5aa	There's nothing you can do.  The timbre and pitch of your voice is determined by the shape and size of your vocal chords, the size of your voice box, and the structure of your face.  Without surgery, you can't change any of that.  However, these things will change as you get older, and I'm assuming you're pretty young, so just wait it out.  There are way more things to worry about than having what you think is a weird voice.<br>  <br>  I bet you don't even sound that funny anyway.|`|6y9Bqok9aa	as i was reading this i was thinking, "a swift kick to the bollocks should do it", but then i read girl so that killed it. as you age your voice will become normal|`|Cfe7NoTdaa	You (along with everyone else) have two sets of vocal chords believe it or not. When you speak, try to speak from higher up in your throat.<br>  Other than that I'd say try to embrace it. I personally find women with the half/half sound more attractive than the higher pitched sound. It just sounds like intelligence to me for whatever reason... Try not to hide who you are as much, you might hide yourself from someone who could be genuinely interested in you.|`|YJlYBmdQaa	Don't try to change your voice! It's part of how God made you!

It will go down in  a couple of days, and the redness wil dissapear. just dont touch it!|`|57j6hSjNaa	Your allergic to the product. Your face is dry and irritated, so that's why is it's itchy and red. You may have dry and sensitive skin. <br>  <br>  I would suggest discontinuing using it.. It doesn't agree with your body chemistry. Find another acne facial cleanser. Try something less potent. <br>  <br>  Do not wash your face with any products. Wash with warm water and a towel for a couple days until your face gets back to its normal PH level. Also, use a facial moisterizer that's non oily and has aloe vera in it to soothe those red blotches.. Then find another cleanser that's made for your skin type; oily, dry, normal or combination.|`|gU3yIZwMaa	are you allergic to aspirin by chance?<br>  i did a search on clear and clean and found that the main medical ingredient is salicylic acid -- a compound similar to aspirin<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salicylic_acid" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salicylic_a...</a><br>  <br>  the next ingredient is a coconut glycol, oil or simply put, by-product.<br>  <br>  disodium lauroamphodiacetate is a cleaning agent<br>  <br>  so if your allergic to certain detergents, coconuts or aspirin try something else.|`|hi1kVUtdaa	i would wash you r face off with warm water and them put a moisturizer on it. if that doesn't help but aloe lotion on your face to sooth the itching but moisturizer should help with the red spots.<br>  hope it gets better!! ?|`|hWceZJebaa	Benzoil peroxide probably irritates your skin.

HOdblqIkaa	i had mine done when i was 14 without my parents consent. the guy who did it was a legal piercer who happened to know a lot of kids who went to my school so he did it as kind of a side job. i did have it done at at legal shop and he did everything correctly so i was pretty lucky, even though i look back now and realize it was pretty stupid of me. my parents dont like piercings (it was tough to convince them i should get my ears done) so talking them into it was out of the question, i was more likely to get a tattoo before my 18th birthday then a hole in my body. my arguments were it would give me a reason to lose weight before i get it done and keep the weight off after, it was my body and i didnt see why someone should tell me how to modify it, and it would be easily taken out if need be. not very good arguments, but i was only 14. i got it done and when they found out they were mad but never made me take it out. so again i was lucky. a few friends of mine went to a different guy about a year later and got theirs done and it went pretty badly for them. both got staph infections and had to take out the piercing. one had to have hers lanced. since then they have both had multiple staph infections and the guy who did theirs was caught and went to jail, i guess quite a few kids got infected. i would never dream of doing a piercing at home, its just stupid. there isnt really a way to convince your parents you NEED a hole in your body. most parents realize that kids have no need for tattoos and piercings, its kinda like why do you need the $200 pair of jeans over the $50 pair?  i would just talk to them and see what they say and if they say no then drop it and get it done when you can. thats really the best and safest thing to do cause you dont want to be like my friends and get sick over it.|`|jER0X5OPaa	Absolutely do NOT do it yourself. You are asking for an infection and huge problems from that.<br>  <br>  If you really want it done, research piercings. Research the after care, what you need to know about getting it pierced, good jewelry vs. bad jewelry, good piercers vs. bad piercers, where is a clean place to get it done, etc. Prove to your parents that you don't just want it, but that you are actually knowledgeable about your topic.<br>  <br>  If that still doesn't work, then you will just have to wait. No reputable piercer will pierce you if you're underage without parental permission. I know it seems hard, but the legal age comes much faster than you think.|`|GEc2jvViaa	Assure them your only doing it for youself. By making sure they know your not doing it for a boy or to look sexy, will ease their mind. Its cute and unique, I love mine! <br>  Do not go behind their back, my friend got her rook done behind her parents back and they made her take it out way before it was healed, bad expierience! <br>  Good luck! and btw, out of my rook, tragus and belly button, it hurt the worse! But it's completly worth it :)|`|fpS90nx4aa	i got mine done at a tattoo shop but it got infected and i had to take it off =[ but what i did to convince my mom was telling her that i had other piercings and that my belly button wouldnt be any different and that i wanted it because i thought it looked cute not to be wearing shirts above my belly button and parading my stomach and she finally let me do it.good luck|`|ztxkW7WKaa	O gosh dont consider doing it yourself. It could get infected or you might not do it deep enough and cause to rip out!!! Well i got mine done when i was 16, im 18 now. I convinced my mom that i was responsible enough and i told her other things i would get pierced that were worse than a navel piercing. and she reconsidered. i said id get tatoos as soon as i turn 18 and yea she was quick to change her mind. i dont recommend threats but it worked lol|`|b6Fsfbfnaa	I assume by your writing that you are quite young and I assume you do not have the means to get it done professionally. Wait till you're older and more independent, you might even change your mind in a few years.|`|WEqRKZzyaa	definitely dont do it yourself! very very bad idea (its one thing to pierce your ears but a body part is much more serious and much more painful and dangerous should it get infected).  I told my mom i was going to get it anyway when i turned 18 so she might as well just take me now (when i was 16 i am now 18)|`|RFhUF2Uqaa	wow.<br>  run-on sentence, much?<br>  learn to use punctuation, grow up, and then ask your parents again.
kCdISEGqaa	It's not something we get off on, we are professionals and it is our job.  It would be like a plastic surgeon enjoying a post-op exam of a woman's breasts, it happens so often you just don't think twice about it.  I am not big into piercing, but do have a piercer in my shop.  She is very professional and treats each client with dignity and respect.|`|4S6V4sb4aa	All the time,, I actually have one booked for tomorrow night..|`|WLuEIwp5aa	Pretty common, I think.  I know apradavyas and prince alberts are relatively common for guys to get, and girls with vertical clitoral hood piercings aren't uncommon either.  Most piercers and tattoo artists are just professional about it, it's a job, and they're going to do it well and not be squeamish.<br>  <br>  Hell, my last tattoo was on my ribs and kind of went onto the side of my boobs a bit, so I had to lie there with my boob just straight hanging out.  My tattoo artist didn't make fun of me for it (okay, a little bit, but I've gotten a lot of work from him and we've hung out outside of the shop a little bit).|`|ZkrGttKaaa	It happens more often than you think. There is a business protocol attached to that. We can turn down anything or anyone we want, especially someone it wouldn't be comfortable with. My mentor does all the piercings, a lot on girls 'down south' areas. I asked him the other day if he'd done any Prince Albert's. He said, 'yeah, one. Just so I could say I did it'. I get my share of private sittings. There is a saying from eastern philosophy I like... 'Nudity is often seen, but never looked at.' It's part of professionalism.|`|8IfePMa3aa	It's actually a very common occurrence; daily.|`|HkKNFiEXaa	Yes. <br>  A client will call first to remain anonymous just in case we didn't give the service.|`|rRS6GjH6aa	Im no tattoo artist or piercer,but i do no this story, that might help you.Once i was at a tattoo/piercing place, and the girl wanted here down section pierced,but a dude was going to pierce it!she also wanted a tattoo on the middle of her chest.the same dude was going to do it!so she took all her clothes off right in the middle of the place!!and he just stuck the wipe on her down section and pierced it, and with no gloves!!when he did the tattoo i left i didnt no i saw enough already!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  (Noit Me that went thru this my friend)|`|lLtbH6pZaa	You can get your clit pierced I know that.

Totally in.|`|vLAaeKmdaa	It sounds like you want to fulfill more of a somewhat "sexual" fantasy than a hairstyle change. Lucky for you, it's fine either way. Hair grows back, and short hair is cute. I love guys with short hair. But don't go bald. Besides, if you love beautiful women cutting your hair, you want to have a reason to go back sooner =] if you shave it all off, you'll have to wait a lot longer.|`|NRJNiSWFaa	Well your barber should probably be aware that your turning them on, otherwise it's a little weird/unfair to them.<br>  <br>  My best advice is fall in love and trust that women enough to shave your head.<br>  <br>  That way you won't sort of take advantage of some hot hairstylist|`|n41yoBzFaa	really? I don't know but I think that's a bit strange to be honest with you. It's just hair... It grows back.

Q4D48Sdvaa	I love to use homemade facial masks and cleansers, its kind of hard to make your own creams because the ingredients are difficult to find. <br>  <br>  For a quick mask i just use honey, i leave it on for about 15 minutes, and then wash it off with warm water. Honey evens out your skin tone making things like acne scars and blemishes less noticiable if used on a regular basis. <br>  <br>  I also use and avacado yogurt mask, i just take half an avacado and about 2 table spoons of plain yougurt blend them together and leave them on for about 15 minutes. Avacado moisturizes and is a good source of vitamin E and natural oils. Yohgurt softens hydrates and have enzymes thate exfoliate the skin.<br>  <br>  Here are some more recipies for cleansers, toners and masks:<br>  <br>  Milk cleanser (for oily skin)<br>  To cleanse and exfoliate, mix 1 tsp. powdered milk with 1 tsp. water and gently massage into skin for 2 minutes.<br>  <br>  Rose Water Toner (for sensitive skin)<br>  To gently balance and tone, apply rose water with a cotton ball<br>  <br>  Egg Honey Mask (for dry skin)<br>  Mix 1 egg yolk and 2 tbsp. honey until a light paste is formed. Apply to face and neck, avoiding eye area and mouth. Leave on for 10 to 15 minutes, and then rinse off thoroughly with lukewarm water.|`|d5065693519b5b048f87de49a76bf961aa	*JUST APPLYING ANYTHING TO SKIN is going to do very little, if anything at all . This is a miracle worker for getting rid of scars. It's helped many on Answers. I had pronounced scars from childhood accidents and pimple/acne scars and as I didn't protect myself from sun damage I also had discolorations. Treatment got completely rid of them all. It's low cost as it's using safe, essential oils. The best for acne prone skins are lavender, rosewood or clove - used by skin specialists for clearing up acne. Will not clog, cause break outs and they lessen skin's production of oil.  Use one and dilute 50/50 with a milder oil such as grape seed, almond or olive.  Massage over and over many times and the rubbing friction rubs them away. First,  tighten skin  by opening mouth about 1",  pull lips firmly back against teeth - tightens most of face. For best and quickest results do for 5 to10 min 2 or 3 times a day. See significant fading in only 10 to 15 days depending on how vigorously you do the massaging. Treatment will almost immediately clear skin of ALL blemishes, tighten and smooth and revitalize it and give it a radiant, healthy glow. Try it - you will be happy that you did!<br>  See my many Best Answers for more info.

You can simply rub it on, but if you have sensitive skin, dilute with water or honey first.<br>  Milk is also great, makes your skin really lovely and soft. When you're having a bath, just pour in two or three cups of milk, and two spoons of honey. <br>  Milk and honey can get rid of scars.<br>  And for a facial mask, you can use oatmeal with water OR honey OR yoghurt.<br>  <br>  Also, if your acne scars aren't old, use BioOil since its great at fading scars.<br>  <br>  Have fun! :D|`|rQVs0sB1aa	I have one I love and it is natural.

o2NZBZO0aa	They can either sew in the extensions or glue them in.  It depends on how long u want to keep them in.  I personally prefer gluing.|`|Afmv2WYSaa	There are many different types of extensions. Clip in, sewn in, bonded etc. Clip ins are great because you can take them out whenever you want, having short hair one day and long the next. Sewn in extensions are when they braid a few small horizontal cornrows in your hair and sew the extensions into the braid. And bonded are when they bond the extensions to your real hair and small peices. <br>  <br>  Personally, i have had clip ins and sewn ins. I like clip ins better because you can take them out with you take a shower and stuff and the hair stays nicer. Also they are easier to style. Also, it is cheaper than having someone sew or bond them in.|`|Jbkz18E8aa	lol they make a braid then saw the extensions in your head.<br>  well theyre reallly annoying i had it for a month i couldnt stand ittt .<br>  it would get ichy and it kept falling , plus it damages your hair.<br>  i mean get it ,if you want ;its good to try things at least once .<br>  but your hair will grow healthier &faster if you dont|`|b6Fsfbfnaa	I'm thinking you probably don't need extensions, just a little time to grow your hair out.|`|QEOx27CUaa	my advice is websites,check out all the info.and then make your decision|`|r6bSSVKbaa	go 4 it|`|Sv2FbL1Yaa	i don't know, i think you should try, but be careful. most of the extensions i've seen are extremely obviously, especially with shorter hair. so i think you should just try to find a really good kind of extension and make sure to have a professional do it.|`|7csfb1g7aa	I think you should put a picuture up so we could get more information...|`|KNKCTMkIaa	go ahead and do it. if you dont like it, then never do it again

penOVgrjaa	my bangs are always annoying me and the grease from your hair will probably just make your acne worse|`|k1wg9nl5aa	Yeahh I got sidebangs to hide my acne :/<br>  But if you wanna know how you would look, part your hair to the side as far as you would want side bangs.<br>  Then hold them up a bit to the length you would want side bangs so you can see what it would look like.<br>  That probably made no sense...<br>  Haha.<br>  But the thing is side bangs look cute pinned back!<br>  <br>  ~Animal_Lover|`|l5Q8lq35aa	I say go for it! You'll never know if you don't try. First find out with<br>  your hairstylist how to make it look the way you want it to look<br>  everyday. Don't be afraid to ask questions. <br>  <br>  Get bangs that can be styled in more than just one way.

Make sure you don't cut them too short though. Make them long enough to tuck behind your ears just in case it doesn't look good. Then cut them shorter if you like the look.

C0HZ8ZB4aa	People who haven't got any tattoos have no business answering this question - it is not an answer and breaches guidelines.<br>  <br>  Anyway, for me it was something I'd always loved and wanted. There were things as a teen I wanted so badly and nearly got - but thank goodness for my lack of bravery, I'm very glad I waited until I was mature enough to know what I wanted. When I hit 18 I thought 'finally, I can do it legally' so I started really thinking about it. But it wasn't until I was 20 until I actually had my first tattoo - nothing important enough came along for me before then. The first tattoo I did get was for my son. Now I have quite a few on my back and arms, and will be having quite a few more on my body before I'm done. They all mean something to me. Meanings ranging from 'I love my son' or 'I love and miss my mum' to 'I loved that story' or even 'I love the beauty of this'. I think the decision gets easier each time - the more tattoos you have, the more you know you love tattoos, and the more you know you can live with tattoos. I guess that's what they call addiction ;-)|`|o6BDapZjaa	I'd never get a tattoo.  I can't imagine having something like that on my body that I couldn't get rid of; I like myself just fine the way I am.|`|QlgnQBVQaa	I love body art. Love my metal too.<br>  I've always loved tattoo's especially. I have two tats right now, and I made sure that it would be something symbolic, and who I am. I got a pisces tattoo on my ribs done in paint strokes cuz I'm an arsty type. Link below is the photo.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://viewmorepics.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=viewImage&friendID=35461622&albumID=2820820&imageID=38999165" rel="nofollow">http://viewmorepics.myspace.com/index.cf...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  and then I got a scarab tattoo...I believe in reincarnation and all that jazz (not gonna go into the full meaning) and heres that picture below.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://viewmorepics.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=viewImage&friendID=35461622&albumID=2820820&imageID=40800176" rel="nofollow">http://viewmorepics.myspace.com/index.cf...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  anyways, if you're gonna get a tattoo make sure its something that you'll enjoy having for the rest of your life. I know I will ~_^|`|0Wtm8Bh9aa	I got mine in memorium for my cat...it sounds reeeeallly lame and I waited it out for awhile to make sure I really wanted it then I did it. Pretty much...the story is he was my first baby...I found him when I was in 2nd grade (Im now a sophmore in college) and he was just always there, like my first best friend and whatnot. 9Were a bigg animal family here...we get very close to them) and this guy was not like an ordinary cat. He was truly very human-like and just "always there" when I needed him. Anyway, long story short...we had to put him down this past summer because he was suffering from long-term effects of Feline HIV (yes, cats get this disease like us) and it was heart-breaking because that was like losing my child, and just in the worst way possible. In his honor, I got a "sunflower" (his name was sunflower lol) on my back...lower, but not tramp stamp like off to the side) and I have him with me everyday mentally and now physically. Thats prob all ill ever get...id never ink myself up just because, you know? There has to be a meaning within it.|`|WLuEIwp5aa	I always wanted them and I'm a sucker for pain.

Then, go to places like Dillard's or Macy's to see if they have bra extenders.

xfAk2KaUaa	It works, but not that great. Its good for a more natural look though, and tends to clump sometimes.|`|rQVs0sB1aa	If you have long eye lashes it doesn't matter what you wear.<br>  <br>  For me it did not but..I finally found one that does and it takes just a few strokes and is amazing what it does! <br>  <br>  The best one is by Neutrogena called healthy volume and looks natural.  It is silver with a blue top.It comes in waterproof which I always wear in case of crying (ha ha) or sweating. Then the other one I like works great too and it is by Almay and it is in a white tube and called Triple Effect. It also is waterproof but both wash off easily.<br>  <br>  They are great! There is one I have been seeing by Maybelline? It is orange but I do not know. But great last does but takes forever!|`|XE2PZZyHaa	I used to use it and yes it works, but I do recommend using another one like M.A.C ones or Benefit[ the Bad Gal's brush is GINORMOUS!]. If you still want the Maybelline one, use a lash curler before you apply it!<br>  ((:|`|StJGeiFyaa	go for the lash stiletto, its amazing.
fzwPmoZpaa	I have a taurus on my shoulder I got it a little over a year ago and I'm goin gsoon to get a backround added. I hate it now. I always wanted my horoscope on me and i got the design i wanted but it's so over done and plain. I would look into more ancient horoscope designs they're more intricate and unique. Maybe you should get it somewhere else too, your wrist hurts. It burns like no tomorrow, and it's harder to hide for work. Maybe get it on your ankle or back somewhere. The best resource you have is the artist. Make sure you have a good connection with the artist and explain what you think or feel and why you want the tattoo what you want to get out of it. remember tattoo removal is more expensive, painful, and takes longer than getting a tat. Good luck and Think about it.|`|2inq4zHZaa	Well, I don't want to offend you, but it is very over done.  My husband is a tattoo artist, and in the last month I have witnessed 3 girls get their zodiac symbols tattooed on their wrists.  One of them was Virgo.  And we live in a small town, so I can't imagine how bad it must be elsewhere.  I don't want to discourage you from doing what you want because it is your body, it's really up to you.  But a lot of people have it and it isn't very original.  Of course nothing seems to be anymore, but I'm sure you could think of something more unique.  Are you sure you just want a tattoo on your wrist?  That doesn't seem like a really good reason to get something injected under your skin for life.  Just to have a wrist tattoo.  I mean if that's all it's about then buy a watch or a bracelet or something.  It will accomplish the same thing.  Think really hard before you let someone take a needle to your skin, it's a life-long decision, and it's important.  Good luck :)|`|80I1aHSGaa	Zodiac tattoos are pretty usual already, but it will be up to your artist if he can come up with a design that is very unique, and yes, you are right, something that's exclusive to you. Put a personal touch on it. And make sure that you are doing it with purpose and you can stand by your decision in the future. That way, whatever design you'd like to be inked with you, there won't come a time when you have to ask yourself, "Why did I ever want to put this tattoo?"
h2sY45Yqaa	well you seem to kinda have a punkish yet girly style! lolz! um well you should definatly try some flats with your outfits it wld look soo cute! and the stores u shld shop at are you should probably still keep shopping at hollister but i also think you should try some stores lke forever 21 and wetseal they have really cute colorful stuff so that even though your wearing lke a plain graphic tee it will still be reallly cute and colorful!

IystM3h7aa	yeah let it grow out and then bleach it, last year i got my brown hair bleached blonde, im still blonde now but it can be very damaging on ur hair, so make sure ur certain u want to go blonde, because its alot of work to keep up with it. <br>  <br>  im now thinking of going back to brown... <br>  <br>  Good Luck :)|`|XE2PZZyHaa	if you are really wanting to dye your hair blonde, let it grow then bleach it. But are you sure you want to bleach it? I have a close relative who has badly damaged hair to the cause of bleaching it and straightening/Curling it. When you bleach, just I recommend you do it at the salon. ((:|`|D8CDf0vVaa	dont bleach it it ruined my hair!<br>  i think you should do only the bottom because you wont be able to see the roots
80Bgu8ZIaa	well if you go for only one time you wont see results, so if thats what your looking for you should go for more. First time, the worker should explain how it works. Stand up thell give you directions. Lay down, usually they give you 5 min to put on lotion, and then the tanning bed turns on. <br>  <br>  But, should wear eye wear when you go. If you dont, you might get severe burns and long term injury to the eyes.<br>  <br>  using a tanning bed might not exactly provide a protective base in regards to sun exposure. <br>  <br>  You might get skin sensitivity if you use certain acne medication on your face. <br>  <br>  Use lotion. Always. <br>  <br>  pregnant women and women on birth control pills may develop discolored skin. (But I never saw this happen to anyone)<br>  <br>  and yes, cancer like you said. wrinkles, premature aging of skin. etc. <br>  So pretty much it is unhealthy, but most people still go, like me, which is veryy very seldom. I think the worst happens if people go very often for no reason. Atleast the chances are higher.|`|x21oB9cxaa	5 minutes will do absolutely nothing, i would recommend you getting a spray tan [versa spa] that dosent look fake and it works in less then a minute, all though it costs about 30 dollars|`|f8bf26c17d2b021c337d130648b25311aa	Starting out on 5 minutes will do literally nothing.  Go at least 8, and if you don't use tanning lotion, you won't tan at all.  Try a lotion with bronzer for a faster tan.
Q0HEpw3jaa	Well I'm a girl but I guess I can still answer this one.<br>  <br>  Ugly-Pretty: I'm sort of confused by this one..<br>  <br>  Natural Beauty: A girl that doesn't wear much makeup or mess around with her hair. She usually has a really nice smile and nice clear skin. She doesn't need makeup/ a straightener/curler to make herself beautiful.<br>  <br>  Classic-Beauty: I usually think of a girl with brown hair and eyes, and light skin. Usually pretty thin, someone like Audrey Hepburn.<br>  <br>  Interesting-Beauty: Usually I think of someone of another ethnicity (African, Indian etc) or someone with very large features.<br>  <br>  Typical Pretty: Blonde and blue eyed, or any girl who has natural beauty but wears too much makeup.<br>  <br>  Model Pretty: Very thin. Generally blue/green eyes, and a small nose.  Very "cold" looking generally.|`|M9FiPNQ4aa	Pretty as a picture i have heard   Natural beauty,very nice features needs no make up. Looks like a lot of Grumps on today!|`|CKpxVeucaa	does not deserve a star. And why does it even matter.|`|F4fjT1bLaa	why do people ask these questions? ask ur friends!!|`|WItdtl0Vaa	natural-pretty: doesn't try, little make up, minimal hair products<br>  sl*tty-pretty: tries really really hard, lots of make up, tight clothes|`|IvMPh09baa	who cares!!!????<br>  <br>  how about this one... STUPID-pretty.<br>  <br>  Ever heard the term... butterface..... ?<br>  <br>  it means she's pretty, but-her-face!
COecrPrMaa	Personally, the only thing I think makes a person look trashy is their personality.  Piercings and tattoos are body art.  It's your skin, your own personal canvas.  If you like it, do it.  Unfortunately, you also have to think about what ever career you want to venture out into in the future.  Of course, you can always take a piercing out later.|`|HOdblqIkaa	thats quite a few facial piercings which in my opinion doesnt look good on anybody. pick one for now, wait a year or so and get another, then when your 18 get the other. getting them all now would look weird and youll have them for your school pictures and sr pics. id say get the nose 1st but thats just my opinion. it is your face after all so do whatever makes you happy.|`|d44d8834433f98c3a93f35f420d4a381aa	Yes they would, just like the rest who have had it done.|`|6CMfKxiMaa	the angel bites would probably ruin it, to be honest. i've seen countless people who look Horrible with them, not even decent, horrible.<br>  nose won't look trashy, and eyebrow,hmm, depends on how you look already. pictures help >.>|`|4d3Md9pnaa	depends on how your face looks.<br>  <br>  also, not to be mean, angel bites look like they'd be really hard to pull off without looking like another teen who just wanted to pierce something.|`|5AtyWKcVaa	You should wait until you're a little bit older. (might regret it) In my opinion nose piercings can be cute depending on the person. Eyebrow and angel bites.. that's another story.|`|rQVs0sB1aa	They definitely  take away the look and you go right there when you look at someone with them. I was laughing the other day about that very thing.<br>  <br>  I am 51 and I was thinking about what people are going to look like when they get old. And I said that the piercings on the eyebrows will be hanging in front of their eyes. The little tatoo of the cherry or whatever will look like an apple now! Or an ink blot. The nose I do not know about that one or what angel bites are. But they to me do not look feminine at all but that is me.<br>  <br>  Think about it long and hard because it is there forever with a tatoo and then what happens when you grow older and no longer want it?|`|t4gjClN0aa	I also agree with the person who said only your personality can make you look trashy and also if you really want to get that done, then you should and it shouldn't depend on what others think.<br>  <br>  I want to get my tongue pierced except a lot of people think it will look trashy but i figure:<br>  if someone else has a problem with the way it looks, fine, no one said they had to get one (:<br>  <br>  go for it, i rekon piercings add character :D btw im 15 too<br>  ** edit, i just found out what angle bites are, and yeah i agree, only a small amount of people can pull them off but see how it goes and if you like them, if you do then that should be fine|`|YGUl7X21aa	i agree with the person who said that it is only a person's personality that makes them look trashy, if you flaunt your piercings and dress trashy with messed up hair and tooooons of dark eyeliner then it might, but other then that it shouldn't. also hardly anyone can pull off angel bites but if you have full lips then they should look good  [ i think that's what anel bites are, the two on your bottom lip? ]|`|7Gf3kWdJaa	If you get all of them it will definitely look trashy.  if i were you i'd get only the nose peirced.  but in general, i think all of them are disgusting.|`|1haKToUeaa	it's hard to say without knowing what you look like, some people can pull off eyebrow piercings and some look like they just walked out of the trailer park.<br>  <br>  ask some of your friends|`|xXXUEfNwaa	nose is common so it wont look trashy<br>  eyebrow it depends<br>  angel bites are lovely but very rarely can people pull em off

F2D1W4Kpaa	I only have an answer for how to straighten your hair without an iron. And my answer is, buy a chemical straighten like in a box, so you don't have to use an iron for a couple months. Don't get it at the hair/beauty salons because those can get a little intense and will kill your hair. Here is a site where you can check the products out and buy them too:<br>  <a href="http://www.nextag.com/chemical-straightener/compare-html" rel="nofollow">http://www.nextag.com/chemical-straighte...</a><br>  And also you can go to a drug store and sometimes they also have it too!<br>  <br>  Hope my tips helped you!|`|xfAk2KaUaa	Use a clarifying shampoo once every few weeks to remove product buildup which you get from supermarket brands such as Pantene, Dove and Tresemme. <br>  I recommend Redken, which is a salon brand, although it is a bit pricey. Al'chemy is also good if you're looking for organic products so you know you're not going to get any of that bad chemical stuff in your hair. And L'Oreal Professional is good if you have colour treated hair.<br>  When I want straight hair, after washing I simply flip my head upside down, and while brushing through it, I blowdry so it ends up straight.

OMuyhd2Eaa	well if you have a curling iron, you can use that to curl your hair. It may take a while though. OR you can always braid your hair and leave it in for a while, and then it'll come out curly. Thats what i do and my hair always turns out nicely. Basically thats it. You  can also buy those bottles of shampoo or conditioner that help to make your hair even curlier. Hope i helped :D|`|lMHy05Lmaa	Sweetie Its called a curling iron|`|NgAaenfuaa	its called a curling iron.<br>  my gawd, you can just tell by looking at her hair.|`|qModiaZlaa	I kinda call those out-of-the-shower curls. Damp your hair, scrunch it up a WHOLE lot, and blow dry. You may want to but some extremely wide-toothed combs because scrunching will tangle and combs get the tangle out without ruining the style. <br>  <br>  Your other option (which works a heck of a lot better!), is to but Garnier Curl Shaping Gel. It comes in a spray bottle and personally I think it is the greatest thing to ever be invented! You don't even have to wet your hair for this, but you can if you like. <br>  Take a dime-sized amount in your palm, spreading it to your fingertips. Brush it generously with your hands to the underside of your hair and rub the excess on the top/side. Then go ahead in with a curling iron or just twist it around your finger because this spray has a natural but strong hold.<br>  Then buy some Garnier leave-in conditioner or straightening gel or hair balm. Swipe a fingertip sized amount on your finger and apply it to the ends the split them up. You don't want bunches and clumps!<br>  Before going out, slip on a thin, plastic, hairband (same as your hair color) to seperate your hair like hers!|`|CKpxVeucaa	curling iron.

You don't need to chop off too much, just enough to get rid of the ends. <br>  If you blowdry, or straighten your hair, try to cut down on those since they can dry and damage your hair over time. And use a moisturisng shampoo and conditioner.|`|Vy8p3Qlcaa	Yes cut the ends, your hair will be fuller with more volume.|`|2eQVWIMxaa	Yes, if you do not trim your ends, they will break & your hair will not grow longer.

For example, the comb-over flip. Get a long, thick comb and brush it over your scalp. Twist it. Leave it like that in the car or while you're walking. After about 2-5 minutes, take it off. You'll have a cute, girly and fashionable curl right in the middle of your head that you can also tie with a ponytail holder if you're doing sports in school.<br>  <br>  It's very hard to curl naturally straight hair, especially if it's long. For church, you can do this with or without the curling. First thing: wash your hair and tone it up with Rejoice Rich conditioner (found at any convenience store, drugstore or supermarket). Grab a curling iron (or a circular brush, curling 'stick', whatever you like) and stretch it out on your hair. Fold that group of hair over the curling iron and let it bounce loose. It will look feminine and great. Now, if you don't want to curl, then simply enhance the richness of your hair with Rejoice Rich, pin two sides up for thirty minutes, and your hair will look formal and perfect. I really hope this helped, please trust me, I've done this before. :)|`|KFvA7cJwaa	when i am in a rush for like school all i do is let the front of my hair(if i had bangs thats what they would be but i don't so it just long) and i clip it infront of my eyes with everything else i through up in a ponytail and then i take the clip out(infront of my eyes where all my hair is covering my face) and take the middle part (so that u have a strand of hair on each side of ur face) (right and left) and with the middle part u make a bump and clip it up. and leave the stands down you might wanna straighten it to form your face though its really not hard:)|`|3Zad0UuWaa	Braids, French Rolls, or twists.

IhLUgRIAaa	YOUR GORGEOUS :]<br>  all of them are really pretty... but my i like number 5 the best|`|OHfZFR31aa	None of these are really right to send to an agency<br>  <br>  1 doesn't work because you are on the ground. The pose makes you look short. You need to be standing up and wearing fitted clothes so you can see your measurements<br>  <br>  2 is all wrong - bad angle. It looks like you took it yourself. Very unprofessional<br>  <br>  3 is ok, at least you can see your body. But your smile doesn't look great. I would reshoot this so you look more relaxed<br>  <br>  4 is also shot from above rather than straight on. It makes your head look large and your legs look small. <br>  <br>  5 is also a funny angle<br>  <br>  You need to really start from scratch. You need 1-2 headshots - facing forward and looking straight into the camera lens, hair pulled back from your face and no makeup. Think of a passport photo - very simple. One should have your face completely relaxes and the other with a smile<br>  <br>  Then you need a profile headshot, also with hair pulled back<br>  <br>  And for the full body shot, it needs to be shot straight on, you facing forward, arms at your sides, wearing fitted clothing. The shorts are fine but you should wear a fitted top rather than the full one you are wearing. Hair should also be pulled back.|`|bOQQR2pYaa	In my opinion, you look uncomfortable, rigid and stiff.

I kinda looks like you're just some myspace pictures. Nothing special at all.<br>  <br>  The pictures you took also make your legs look really short, not a good thing.|`|03b9cb4d0f4affafab8fb073ff4518feaa	K for starts, you are not ugly.

2FsNdcXEaa	I think it depends. When you first meet someone, looks are all you've got to go on, so in that case being generally attractive helps. But I think when you get to know someone and really care about them and them you, they become more attractive to you.|`|xqQO81Omaa	Yes, because beauty is not universal. It's all in the perception of the person and their opinion of what they find attractive. I can look at someone and think they are beautiful while someone else might think they aren't even very attractive. Both of us will probably not understand why the other holds such a different opinion but neither of us are right or wrong because BEAUTY IS IN THE EYE OF THE BEHOLDER!|`|OUBKWrf2aa	From the look of ur pic, I certainly know that u have no beauty.<br>  <br>  just jk :P....really|`|TUhG5vPiaa	There are some universal standards for beauty, large eyes, full lips, clear skin, and symmetrical features. Also, universally beautiful people like many you see in Hollywood, have faces and bodies that obey the golden ratio which is 1.6-1. Like the length of the navel down to the toes is 1.6 that of the torso and the length of the lips are 1.6 times the bottom of the nose, etc. I saw all this on a documentary on youtube called the human face. But there is also the aspect of the beholder, since there are women who don't find Tom Cruise, Brad Pitt, and others attractive. But overall I think beauty is universal.|`|Or1AKzaoaa	I think different people are attracted to different people. People are only as pretty and attractive as others allow them to be. <br>  <br>  I'm takin the beholder side|`|0Pf6yvhwaa	i think beauty is in the eye of the beholder<br>  absolutley|`|rR2z9CFfaa	it certainly is... i know very pretty girls who are in love with very ugly guys and the other way round so yeah

vLAaeKmdaa	Any way you do it, a hair stripper is going to be involved. I'd just bite the bullet and do it, condition your hair after with a high quality conditioner everyday, and use semi-perminant next time. It is the same price, way less damaging, and you'd have to re-apply just as often as you would have to get your roots done with a perminant hair color. Good luck.|`|xyyPp7xJaa	i used a non damaging semi permanent hair rinse.

I use CoverGirl TruBlend, which is ok, but I'm looking for something better. (NOTE: If you use liquid foundation, apply your concealer AFTER, but before if you use powder)<br>  <br>  3. Foundation. I use a pressed powder from CoverGirl. It comes with one of those foam pads, but I use a all-over face brush instead so it doesn't look as caked on.<br>  <br>  4. Tightline the my upper lashline.

This results in loss of hair on both the scalp and body of a person. It is impossible to guess where it strikes and anyone whatever their age, background; social standing, gender ethnic origins etc can experience Alopecia. However, Childhood is the period to start by frequent observationHair is considered as our crowning glory, lovingly cared for and nurtured. In most cultures a woman's hair is a part of her beauty. Women spend a lot of money for maintaining their hair in a fine-looking condition. The symptoms of Alopecia are when you wake up one morning and find much of hair on the pillow, or when washing it to discover much of your hair at the bottom of the drain. These symptoms can have devastating consequences.

0tXiRZU2aa	so i dont know the exact name of the lotion, but i would choose to use an actual lotion that has some tanner in it, and he more you use it the darker you get. i would try that first. everyones skin tone is different and tans differently. if that doesnt work then i would try finding and actual self tanning lotion. neutragena works pretty well. again, you just have to make sure that you wash your hands...or they will look orange. good luck, and like i said, they all work different on different people!!|`|DF6ihDDCaa	Use lotion. <br>  Jergens is the best. <br>  Make sure to wash your hands afterwards<br>  :)|`|f8bf26c17d2b021c337d130648b25311aa	Lotion is the only one that has good results.  Spray goes away really fast, and the wipes are really hard to use because you have to get ONE layer over your whole body, and you can't really tell where you wiped it so you end up with a really bad tan.  Lotion is simple and easy to remember, just wash your hands well after, & if you don't keep it up it will turn orange.

kCdISEGqaa	The reason you're not getting any answers is because tribal is outdated and lame.  It was a fad in the late 90's that tattoo artists hated.  And now, people are still requesting them and it drives us crazy.  I don't have any tribal flash in my shop, and have a sign that says, "The minimum charge for tribal, regardless of size, is $1000"
0SoglbRUaa	i think that straight bangs and  curly hair is "IN" and that it would be cute. dont put any gel in ur hair cause it will look fake. if it iwll hold without the gel or anything keep it like that. it gets greasy..ok??!?!! have fun with ur neew hair|`|hJTvbbKnaa	no i think peoples bangs should be staight if they have a perm|`|TDtSZLmvaa	no its not a "no-no" i permed my hair except for my bangs and i like it like that. good luck.<br>  <br>  =]]|`|vLAaeKmdaa	I think that the only bangs that look natural with curly hair like yours is a straight across bang. I'm assuming that's what you have, and it probably looks cute. Side bangs with curly hair, however, look awkward and like you forgot to straighten the rest of your hair. That is just my opinion though.|`|0JAHvSg0aa	no..... not completely....|`|QUKc25Fcaa	no one in this day and age has bangs|`|AA10061340	Hey I like bangs, and either way it doesnt matter, but what i have done in the past, is they would perm my bangs with a big roller, and you can blow dry them with a round brush, It gives them a little lift and body...|`|Z7oVI2zgaa	My best friend actually has a perm. Sometime she straightens her bangs and it looks fine. But when she got it done, the hair dresser actually put a bigger roller in them so they weren't all curly but had some oomph. :)|`|2J1Ca4Bbaa	That actually sounds really cute!<br>  It's not a fashion no-no so don't worry :)
fa1EcIH8aa	you're very pretty :)<br>  and you have the most gorgeous eyes.<br>  and completely ignore everyone that has suggested wearing make up.<br>  if they call you pretty, and say try make up, thats just rude. thats their way of saying you are not pretty, and not seeming mean.<br>  but its rude.<br>  dont wear make up.<br>  maybe if you're going out ...sure.<br>  but you are a lucky girl, you have a natural beauty.<br>  dont let anyone else tell you otherwise.<br>  :)|`|yv3RIbHuaa	aww. yeah you're very pretty. youre very natural and thats really good. i dont think you need so much makeup it will ruin your natural beauty|`|BnPe68lmaa	KINDOFF..UR 2 WHITE..GET A TAN..BUT OTHER THEN THT IM INLOVEE WIT UR EYES [NO HOOMO]|`|BsfCZlMraa	Your very pretty =) <br>  I love your eyes! such a pretty blue!<br>  keep smiling, it really suites you|`|lAV4rgonaa	yes, you're so pretty! =]|`|fyLgyLc8aa	yeah... you're very pretty, and don't let anyone tell u otherwise. :D|`|JyOVEAUEaa	makeup please|`|ptActoJ7aa	not at all. clear up your acne situation and then lets talk.|`|vRYruIUaaa	very pretty. my advice is just a little bit of eyeliner on TOP and bottem. your eyes will really complement black eyeliner. good luck!|`|Bm2YqJkTaa	I love the blue eyes. I think you are naturally pretty, but if you wore eye make up you could be even prettier.|`|om6OvwxCaa	Very Pretty :)|`|m3CPxLKfaa	yeh lol<br>  make up would look even better though|`|xCIwfYpFaa	I guess not that close though|`|dr6i2CR7aa	yea!|`|24507d459775ede5fdae932098289feeaa	aw you're really pretty! really natural. you would look cute with a little eyeshadow too :)|`|OUBKWrf2aa	No its just average...I know u probably from the south|`|4624eec6cde81909bd950f67a964ba76aa	No, it's considered below average. =/|`|1b4ea77c10a26133d0a52fc258a6bbcfaa	Yes, but she lacks originality.|`|078bdda067d82a0dc6b47d9639e39c3faa	I guess..but too plain..try some makeup|`|PbykKE2oaa	yeah.<br>  wear some make up though. you're cute
4S6V4sb4aa	Yes you can ,, I changed mine in 4 and a half and they have been fine ever since..|`|6Nj5VZQ8aa	Yes you can.

5Iv3gcwxaa	Well you get them at Universal Studios Islands of Adventure.

o2NZBZO0aa	I found that the tongue was actually easier than my nose.  Just get use to carrying a bottle of water and Listerine for at least a week.  LOL|`|VYRMz5qxaa	Ive had a nose piercing and atoung piercing, the tounge hurt waaaayy more than the nose. An it swells so much you cant talk for a while, but after all that stuff is over its fairly easy to take care of.|`|RxO9aSuNaa	no you shouldnt|`|1rHmtCdLaa	i just got my tongue pierced about a week ago and i was expecting it to hurt like hell but actually it wasn't bad and like it was weird my tongue didn't start to swell up til 2 days after i got it done... but i think that was because i was playing with it all the time and yeah now i talk normally and it doesn't hurt... the tongue was WAY better to get done than stretching my ears =D|`|5GPDrBPLaa	I had mine done several years ago.  The pain wasn't bad.  My naval hurt worse.  I can't compare it to nose b/c I don't have mine done.<br>  <br>  The only problem was the 4-5 days following the piercing.  My tongue was sooo swollen I could hardly talk or eat.  I ate a LOT of soup.  You should get it done.  It's pretty cool.  <br>  <br>  I thought it had gone out of style for a while, but people still have them and Drew Barrymore admitted that she just got hers done.|`|TDtSZLmvaa	well i have my ears nose belly button and tongue done.<br>  my ears get infected like every other month and ive had them done for years. but none of my other piercings are infected.<br>  <br>  I didnt think my tongue hurt at all, i didnt think any of my piercings hurt. just depends on your pain tolerance.|`|lMbYgBtQaa	Its different for everyone! Neither my nose nor my tongue hurt|`|ykyG7IY3aa	I dont think you should get your tounge pierced but if you want to go for it.<br>  <br>  My friend has hers done and she said it was more painfull than her nose and she said she could hear the needle going through the skin, which personally grosses me out big time.<br>  <br>  if you do make sure you keep it really clean because they can get infected really easily and then you have a really big problem.|`|t4gjClN0aa	Well since I really badly want to get mine done too :)<br>  <br>  I did a lot of research and read about a lot of people who have compared them and it honestly comes down to your own personal experience, but I can say that most people say tongue piercings dont hurt and yes that also includes in comparison to a nose piercing but I would definitly imagine that they would be two different kinds of 'pain'.|`|MV1l9yGIaa	To my understanding it hurts like all H---! Also  food gets stuck under the ball, tha's what i heard from someone who did it and they finally removed it altogether.<br>  Why do you want to that that anyway, looks ugly as far as i'm concenrned but, that's my opinion!<br>  Try the ears again, too many cute stylish earrings out there going to waste. ears are so fun, you can pierce 2 , 3 , 4 holes and look great.<br>  Keep good gold earring in and you won't have a problem, 10k doesn't cost that much, get one pr at a time.<br>  Tongue NOOOO!!|`|GrZyYDi2aa	yeah go for it I got mine done when I was 15 it really didn't hurt at all you cant eat anything solid for about a week and talking comes out funny,your throat might hurt too for about a week its from the weight of the ball on your tongue but once that goes away,it's awesome.|`|m3CPxLKfaa	having your nose peirced hurts like HELL<br>  so does your tounge<br>  i should know i went with my friend for her to get it done<br>  <br>  i'd advise you not to because it can lead to infection <br>  and u will probs regret it in the future!!!!<br>  <br>  RATE ME xxx|`|sWrJsuGvaa	If your concerned about how comfortable it will be you can by a fake, then you will be able to see how it looks also|`|h5BkKUIeaa	i definitely think getting my nose pierced hurt more than my tongue. <br>  just remember, ice is your bestfriend, once you get it!|`|yRgvBTIHaa	it depends on your pain tolerance .....<br>  i am not at all tolerant....<br>  so in mah pain tolerating terms.....<br>  nose and ears domt hurt but tongue ...it hurts.....<br>  i dont wanna scare u bt.....do wat u like....<br>  hope i helped<br>  toodles..
AsnGFwafaa	I think you would need more than hair and eye color to make an inference about someone's looks.

I've been both light blonde and dark brown and many men tell me that they prefer darker.<br>  <br>  As far as eyes, though, the color can either be eh or showstopping.

a1731418e68343f01ae82b7c12846cf2aa	It doesn't sound gloomy to me, but it does seem a bit trite.  I prefer original symbols as opposed to common sayings, but if it's important to you, that's what matters.|`|jK9H6PHiaa	i'd get it someplace more hidden. most work places are enforcing the "tattoo coverage" policy. i always advise getting a tattoo where it will be visible on casual occasions but not at work. (some people just don't share the same love of tattoos as others)<br>  <br>  i do like it but it does sound gloomy, maybe get it in a different language. that way it doesn't stand out and only people you feel comfortable telling the meaning to will understand.|`|C0HZ8ZB4aa	No, I don't think so. I've been considering having an 'all things must pass' quote for a while. I think it could be taken either way. It is a negative statement, but also positive - it's a helpful reminder and is something that personally helps me deal with the concept of death and loss and as you say, helps you cherish the good times and live for the moment, just in case it's your last.<br>  <br>  I don't think you should worry about how others would take it. Firstly - the answers to this should tell you that the majority obviously look at it in the same way that you do. And secondly, even if we didn't, you know what it means to you, it isn't a horrible or crude statement, so there is absolutely no reason not to go ahead if it's what you want. Good luck :-)<br>  <br>  <br>  ... what's with the thumbs downs? I've given the same answer as others who were thumbed up - the only difference is my answer was longer. Sorry, I'll refrain from being pleasant in future...|`|WLuEIwp5aa	It's a pretty decent sentiment.  I don't think it's gloomy, but I also don't think that life is all sunshine and rainbows.  Other people may disagree.|`|TOYeE0iraa	no i like it! its actually really positive! now if you got a tattoo that said my life sucks or something then ya i would say its too negative!|`|c3889ff1e7cdcea4e6162db4937f07a0aa	Gloomy .....No<br>  It means no more,<br>   or no less, than <br>  what it means to you.|`|84ZyxsEwaa	I wouldn't say it sounds gloomy. It sounds more carefree to me. If you feel that it really suits you, then you should get it.|`|BsfCZlMraa	I like the message it is sending and its really poetic sounding <br>  is there a way you could rephrase it to sound less negetive|`|D5gAExPPaa	it seems like you wanna bring the bad times back and remember them that is not good|`|fpS90nx4aa	no i think it sounds encouraging|`|5ktP8taqaa	no. i think it's a awesome i dea

6ddbc258bcea66dd0bcbcd47cecf412daa	Concealer.<br>  I recommend Maybelline's Age Rewind. It looks like a wand with one side that's a highlighter and another that's the concealer. You apply the concealer first and then the highlighter.<br>  Another concealer you could use is Covergirl. They come in a tube, or it looks like a long lipstick and it has a silver holding. They have one in a green color, which is good for red areas. Then they have the kind that's good for skin, which comes in different tones. Those have salicylic acid in them, and that ingredient is used for getting rid of acne if you have any.<br>  Foundation can also be used if you have a lot of scars you want to cover, or acne in general. It evens out your skin tone, but don't use it unless you have a face full of acne. If you decide to buy foundation, try Revlon Colorstay.<br>  To get rid of scars, you could use Aloe Vera, the kind that comes in a bottle. The scars won't go away right after one use, but it'll probably take two months.<br>  Good luck and happy hunting!|`|r8VvBxM6aa	try a concealer and covergirl clean make up foundation<br>  <br>  just blend it well and you'll look great :)<br>  <br>  btw i've started an advice column on youtube about questions like this. if you want to check it out and comment whatever other questions you may have i'd be glad to answer them. :)<br>  <br>  just go to youtube.com and search for thatbrowngirl890<br>  <br>  or go to the link directly<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqlEYydebvg" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqlEYydeb...</a>|`|bH3wIWAmaa	Go to your local MAC counter and they will help you find a good concealer that will work for you.<br>  or if you want a cheaper alternative, go buy concealer at walmart and try to match it yourself =)|`|6N6IOmq8aa	concealer<br>  <br>  but if you need help getting rid of your acne, try using a medicine called Differen.

Yes, it will hurt, and aftercare won't be fun either... and it's not branding a tattoo... it's creating a legitimate burn mark on your body... you should do more research into this if you really want to get it done... plus, the smell of searing flesh is kinda yucky.|`|1MildASGaa	WTFFFFFFFFF<br>  Yes it hurts a lot!<br>  Way more than slitting your wrists 40 times and sowing them back up with a needle....|`|1Thb8v1yaa	are you serious?<br>  your burning yourself...of course it hurts!
VenYUtH6aa	haha you are going to have to what i call the "after wash lunge" basically after you wash your jeans, if they are a little snug, just get them on and then do a couple lunges or squats to stretch them out a little. they'll be good and get looser as the day goes on.<br>  <br>  hope that helps :)|`|nOVSf06Raa	wash them in cold water and hang to dry this will prevent them from shrinking , if they are new jeans read the label before washing , perhaps they are pre shrunk.|`|24507d459775ede5fdae932098289feeaa	They shouldn't shrink that much... if you put them on and they're kind of tight, don't worry, they will stretch out.

r7RE2yMdaa	I had long hair down to my butt also.  When I first got it cut, I had it cut shoulder length so that I wouldn't go into shock.  LOL  I liked that look right away and I still keep it shoulder length, with side bangs, parted in the center, or no bangs.|`|IystM3h7aa	i rekon u should get long and short layers put throughout ur hair, and get it shaped into ur face =]|`|5GoXlTkQaa	I think that you should keep it longer.

You could also straighten it for a different look<br>  highlights are really pretty too :)|`|WyZR3nznaa	i think that if you have had one hairstyle for a while you should go short because it makes a statement...
AhulHZ2daa	I am a makeup artist, and I work for Mac.<br>  <br>  I don't know where you are looking online for reviews...but you should be looking at makeupalley.com<br>  <br>  Studio Fix Powder is meant for oily skin. It is a foundation and powder in one, meaning that it has lots of pigment in it, more than normal powders. It comes with a sponge, which will give you the most coverage. I use SF over top of Studio Fix Fluid or Studio Sculpt, applying with a soft powder brush. This may be too heavy for most people, and using SF powder by itself is more practical. <br>  <br>  I would suggest using an oil control lotion, or a good primer. Using a primer first will always stop your makeup from becoming cakey or shifting on your face throughout the day. Dust some SF on with a dense powder brush to get the lightest coverage. Keep building until you get the coverage you want, or try using the sponge. When I use the sponge, I get the coverage I want, but it can look dry. If your skin is super oily, try using Blot powder on your t-zone to keep oilies at bay. <br>  <br>  If you need more coverage than SF can give you, you should opt for a liquid foundation. Changing to a medium+ liquid foundation will be better because you won't have to apply much, and it won't et powdery looking. Studio Sculpt is great, but its not really for oily skin. You could try Studio Fix Fluid, which has great coverage and keeps your face matte throughout the day.<br>  <br>  As for clogging pores....ALL makeup can clogs pores. I hear Bare Minerals is actually the worst. With that said, it depends on your skin, everyone's skin reacts differently. I would test it out at the store first, and see if you break out in the days following. If not, then go ahead and purchase it. Make sure you are washing your face properly too. Don't expect foundation to not clog pores if you are not washing your face every night and morning to get rid of sebum (oil) build up in the pores.<br>  <br>  Hope this Helps! :)|`|fpS90nx4aa	ive been using it for 4 years and i love it.i dont think itll reduce oily skin but mac also sells an oil control lotion that i also use.i dont think its cakey at all and its better to apply it with a brush than a sponge (bacteria) you can ask the ppl that work there theyll tell u everything u need to know about their products.<br>  my recommendations are below =]|`|naAsPauFaa	Omg I love this powder so much. One of the MAC consultants told me it was also foundation too. I also have REALLLLLLLLLY oily skin but use oil absorbing sheets like I do. Get a pack of 40 for like 4 dollars at Sallys Beauty Supply, the brand is Palladio or something like that<br>  But anyway the powder gives you a very finished, matte, flawless look. <br>  It doesn't clog my pores..just be sure to wash the makeup sponge thing that you apply the powder with, like every few weeks or so. And it doesn't necessarily reduce oily skin..or make it worse. And it doesn't make your skin look cakey either. DEFINITELY worth it :D so go buy it!|`|XE2PZZyHaa	I have used it twice but I am quit satisfied. maybe its just me not applying too much, but it did not give the " Over Done " look and it did not clog my pores. If you are looking to buy it, maybe you should stop by the M.A.C. store to try it and rate it your self, because everyone 's skin is different!

Ls0hxEkUaa	Well, I have to say that ProActive DEFIANTLY isn't all it's cracked up to be. I have been using it for a month and no results. It just dries up your face, I find that using Clean and Clear for sensitive skin (foaming cleanser) and (astringency) works like magic.|`|fkpaxydPaa	i used proactiv and it worked wonders for my skin. only problem...when i stopped using it my acne came back and just got worse. its happened to everyone i know who used proactiv(really everyone) because proactiv just hides your acne and makes it worse instead of eliminating it. so i wouldn't suggest that.

C0HZ8ZB4aa	It still depends on a few things - is the font very thick that would require a lot of filling? Is there any shading or is it block colour? Is it a fancy or detailed font or is it simple?<br>  <br>  Answering on the basis that it's a simple font that isn't too thick or fancy and just block colour - then you'd be looking at 30 minutes tops for the pair. That is just tattooing time - there'll probably be a fair bit of faffing about so prepare to be there for about an hour.|`|StJGeiFyaa	25-45 mins tops|`|oHKipNjxaa	it most likely depends on how much detail is in the tattoos.|`|dTcbssGoaa	Hour maybe|`|0WFALNSvaa	it should be an hour|`|5LEgp6wNaa	an hour the most

(Ok, except beer and stuff like that, of course.)<br>  There is no age restriction on personal lubricants or condoms.<br>  <br>  The reason the vibrating ring has the disclaimer about children is so if a kid swallows it, you can't sue the condom company.  Anyone can buy that stuff, there is no age restriction.  Just keep it all out of a child's reach.  Some of the lubricants would be very painful if a kid got it in his eyes, and condoms and stuff are a choking hazard, if a child thought it was candy.|`|I97Oxc9Saa	No certain age.

57j6hSjNaa	It's a nasty habit and it leaves hyperpigmentation [ugly scars] on the face. <br>  <br>  I have two suggestions and one tip:<br>  <br>  1. Constantly look in the mirror. You will see how bad your ruining your own face and it will force you to stop. Acne is easy to get rid of, but hyperpigmentation is no joke, they are hard to get rid of. <br>  <br>  2. Get your acne under control so there's no pimples to pop.. See a dermatologist or use over the counter acne medication. Know your skin type; oily, dry, normal or combination. Then use a acne facial, toner, moisturizer & for night treatment, benzoil perioxide cream.<br>  <br>  <br>  Tip: <br>  <br>  When you pop your pimples, your creating an open wound on your face and when you touch your face with your hands and finger nails, the bacteria on them are getting into your skin and bloodstream, causing nasty infections on your face.|`|QbJ04Zqiaa	Cut your hands off. That will stop you from picking.|`|EU7CUy2aaa	Okay i have a lot of advice, but i just broke it down into 4 main tips.<br>  <br>  Tip 1. Finding pimple treatment products that work with your particular skin type is a great start in getting your pimple under control. You will need to research if you have oily, dry or combination skin in order to find the right pimple fighting products.<br>  <br>  Tip 2. In addition to figuring out what type of skin that you have and getting pimple treatment products you will also want to try and stop touching your face during the day. The oil and dirt from your hands can aggravate your blemish problem and will likely create breakouts.<br>  <br>  Tip 3. Cutting down on oily foods will also aide in helping you control pimple issues. The excess grease and oils that a great number of food (especially fast food) contains is very likely to end up aggravating any pimple problems that you might have.<br>  <br>  Tip 4. You might also want to consider using natural pimple treatment products in your quest for getting pimple under control. A lot of natural pimple fighting products are more gentle and are less expensive the products you will find at your pharmacy or prescription medications.|`|I97Oxc9Saa	I always pick at the dry skin on my face, & i used to always pick my pimples, and after w ahile i just sort of quit.

8Njdzwi0aa	Do not wear any heels that are too high, make sure you can walk perfectly in them. Sleek, solid color, pumps are best, don't wear anything that will draw attention from you like bright colored shoes or clothing. Beige slingbacks with a pointed toe are pretty and elongate the legs as they match your skin tone!! Look at DSW shoes, they have great brands at even better prices.  A few years back I won a Ford modeling contest here in Dallas ; )  Good luck!|`|OHfZFR31aa	Something basic like these<br>  <a href="http://www.zappos.com/n/p/dp/51968525/c/72/g/women/s/9/w/1.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.zappos.com/n/p/dp/51968525/c/...</a><br>  <br>  But make sure you can walk in them. it's no use getting shoes you wobble in.

Stick to the people that want more than an inflamed opinion. I don't care if it's a 'troll' or not. Nothing has the ring of truth like the truth.

Remember that every question goes to the "front page" of Y! Answers so anyone just hanging out there waiting for questions to answer can see it.  I'm sure those same people ignore the "what tattoo should i get?" questions...but if someone sees a question like that??  Heck yeah everyone's going to voice their opinion!  Even people who don't have tattoos know that it would be a stupid move.  I'm sure the majority of people who posted to that girl's stupid questions weren't people who normally hang out in the tattoos section.|`|kCdISEGqaa	I agree, I came across your answer and loved it!!!

BxMInUUNaa	A base coat does not mean a coat of clear nail polish! Try putting clear nail polish on beofre and after the colour and it will all just peel off. Base coat and top coats are special formulas (which are clear, but that's not what clear nail polish is!) called "base coat" and "top coat" or sometimes you can get one that does both, but I find the seperate ones to be better. The base coat provides a smooth base for the colour to go on, and also stops your nails getting stained, and helps it stay on longer. The top coat protects the colour and makes it more shiny.  <br>  If your nail polish is chipping it could be because you put the two coats on too quickly. Make sure they completely dry before putting another coat on. Also, are you using a good nail polish? OPI nail polish is really good for not chipping. Revlon and Bloom are also quite good. Top coats are also good for not getting chips. <br>  Personally, when I put nail polish on, I use a base coat, two coats of colour and two coats of top colour. It takes a while but the result is great!<br>  I think navy blue would be nice, or maybe a brown. They are the most un-ladylike colours I can think of!<br>  Good luck!|`|AA10466027	If you like clear colors, there is a buffing process (first condition your nails with olive oil) that makes your nails shine and since there is no polish, it will never chip.

Squirt a nice, plump dallop into your hand and lather up on your legs as if it were shampoo. It should create a nice thick cream, like a second skin. <br>  3.Use a loofa and run water over it to get a closer shave by removing the dead skin cells. Once you have massaged in the exfoliation cream, use the loofa to wipe off any remaining residue. <br>  4.Use a good razor to shave your legs, making sure you do it carefully so that you don't cut yourself. Shave up your legs, not down your legs. <br>  5.Rinse your legs with cold water to close the pores, pat them dry with a warm towel. <br>  6.,moisturize WITHH LOTION<br>  GOOD LUCK|`|hcjW0lRbaa	i use veet.   i have sensative skin and this works great!   it feels really soft before u shave.  just putting it on ur legs  makes them soft..  and u dnt have to use the veet rasor just buy the cream.  wet ur legs, apply a thin layer of veet,then use a rasor to shave.  i havn't had dry legs in for ever! :) try it it works great!!!!!|`|6cbgbDazaa	I use a regular shower gel and shave, then like right before I dry off I put baby oil gel on , it's amazing.

hHSsMyNpaa	I think you need some sleep, thats all.|`|KPNTniA1aa	you look fine. you have really light eyelashes, so i suggest putting on a coat of brownish black mascara to liven up your eyes. but don't go overboard with eyeliner. less is more. there's nothing worse than a girl with smudgy eyeliner that makes her look like a raccoon haha. you're really pretty, esp. in that picture of you in the computer lab! hope this helped! :)|`|wRsSodTAaa	I will not leave the house without make-up.  Sorry, it just ain't happening. I have dark circles and so... no.  So, if you feel better in make-up then who cares what some random guy said.  Just do what makes you feel the most confident.  Someone who truly loves you will love you with or without the make-up.  But, in answer to your question, if you don't want to wear a ton of make-up, you could just do some undereye concealer and mascara.  No worries.|`|WCwOvN4Raa	I agree with the first answer... You look ugly either way. <br>  <br>  BTW - If your just going to say "Shut up" she's cute... don't waste you breath, she's ugly and we all know it. :) <br>  <br>         *---* 2 POINTS *---*|`|vomkbci7aa	maybe just something to make your eyes a little darker and some lip gloss :) i <3 lip gloss by the way :)|`|4d52d758f45db34f29370d8ba6d5ec41aa	u r young to worry about it.|`|31a19ac8b142f41b4a9321181463876daa	ok so here's what you do<br>  it's okay to wear a bit of make up to enhance your features<br>  but don't over do it and wear too much<br>  focus on covering you bags...use a concealer to conceal them and don't put on too much other eye make up other than a little eyeliner and mascara and you don't look totally bad without make up...so just focus on mainly making the bags less noticeable, since that seems to be your problem|`|sdOMcaI9aa	Raw potato slices will help tighten baggy, puffy eyes. All you need is a potato and a knife or slicer!<br>  <br>  To Make:<br>  <br>  1. Slice 1/4 potato to fit over your eyes.<br>  2. Cut 2 slices or, if you prefer, 5 to 10 very thin slices, several for each eye. Either method works.<br>  <br>  To Use:<br>  <br>  1. Spritz eye area with water.<br>  2. Lying down, place the potato slices on your eyelids and leave in place for at least 10 minutes for best results.|`|azTxWptgaa	You have deep-set eyes, and since you are used to wearing makeup, find the best method.

4zQEvzCsaa	I like religious tattoos because you can sort of create your own designs to make it look less preachy. If you could do your own cross design, or work on something with your artist then you could end up with a great tattoo.

3ece80164c2739cc39f908768c919b69aa	Please tell me you are joking when you said "should I wash them to be on the safe side"? You should never wear anything that you purchase from a second hand store, a thrift store, a garage sale, or E-bay without washing it first. You never know who wore it before you, what type of person they were (how clean or dirty they were), or where the garments were stored between the last user and the time you purchased them (warehouses full of mold, bugs, etc). You should use Color Safe Bleach or Laundry Detergent with color safe bleach included in it before wearing them. This will kill germs, bacteria, and whatever else is on the underwear before you wear them. <br>  <br>  It is okay to buy second hand clothes, but you need to wash them before you wear them!|`|ugJHDON6aa	you gotta love these joke questions!<br>  The reason I know it is a joke, is that the cheapest the Salvation Army sells used underwear for is 10 pair for $10.

e1434520b7d6b7db2b483084c9ad434aaa	Hairstyles:<br>  - Flipped through pony tail. Put your hair in a loose pony tail. Reach up under the pony tail and separate the hair there into two sections. Use your other hand to twist the tail and then pull it through from the bottom. <br>  - French ponytail. Put the top section of your hair (above ears) into a ponytail. Next, put the middle into a pony. Then put the bottom into a pony. This looks less kiddy if you do it looser with pretty clips.<br>  - Braids and buns are simple and can disguise bad hair days.

hfNXDCPQaa	The price is expensive to get it done professionally. My friend got it done, though, and she only has a few waves that she can straighten easily. It lasts for about six months because of hair growth, and in my opinion, there are better ways. My friend, before her straightening, straightened her hair at night. Get a good one, like a GHD or chi. I prefer GHD.|`|wRsSodTAaa	I had it done two or three times and I liked it, but it damaged my hair quite a bit.  It cost about the same as a perm.  Maybe starting at $60 depending on where you live.  If it looks strange when it grown back in, just get it re-touched.
kVBDpAMTaa	I used to dye and/or bleach my hair every 2-3 weeks before I became pregnant and I am a cosmetology student so I have plenty experiences with things like this.<br>  <br>  First off, if you dye you hair with dark blonde dye it will probably only turn out medium blonde. If you are going from lighter to darker you will need to go a few shades darker than what you really want, but it will turn out the color you wanted.<br>  <br>  So if you want your hair to be dark blonde you should dye it something like lightest golden brown and it will turn out dark blonde. You could either do that or use the dark blonde, get a medium blonde result and dye it again a month an a half later to a darker shade and get the expected result.<br>  <br>  I went from having white/blonde hair and I made the mistake of dying it medium ash brown and that was the biggest mistake I ever made, my hair turned out light gray with green and purple in it. lol So the mistake most people make when they are dying there hair from blonde to a darker shade is choosing something with 'ash' in it. So stay away from any ash color.<br>  <br>  If you have any questions feel free to email me.<br>  Hope this helps!
epTEmKvKaa	A safety pin on the inside|`|PQzrsXsKaa	Did the button fall off or was it made that way? If it came off, then the zipper is coming down because of that.

zzp1o9mlaa	The likelihood is that this is not abnormal and does not herald a disastrous loss of hair. Hair loss is always occurring, but it is often cyclical. That is to say sometimes it is barely noticeable but at other times is quite obvious. I suspect that you will find that in a while your hair loss will virtually cease, and your hair will not look any worse.

After so many years of technology and blah blah blah... shouldn't we know what goes together and what doesn't? Why should animals suffer and be used for experimentation on our behalf? Why should it be considered in the first place?<br>  <br>  It's wrong. I don't believe that cosmetics or any product should be tested on animals.

sIcaPIXVaa	sure why not.|`|C0HZ8ZB4aa	Of course I would. I have a lot of tattoos myself, so it would be pretty hypocritical of me not to! <br>  <br>  But even if I didn't like tattoos - I would always look below the surface of the skin before judging a person.<br>  <br>  Think of it like this - if you were in love with someone already, who then went and got a tattoo, if you didn't like tattoos, would you stop loving them? Hopefully not, not if you ACTUALLY love them. So you have just as much capability to love someone who is already tattooed.<br>  <br>  Finding the perfect partner is so difficult. It's very easy to find someone you can be with for a while. But cracks start to appear in most relationships after a while. It is something very special to actually truly find the person you can spend the rest of your life loving. So if I met that person - there is no way I would say goodbye to him just because he has a bit of ink under his skin, even if I personally hated the look of it.<br>  <br>  If someone could really decide whether or not they could love someone based on something so superficial, they don't deserve a relationship at all.|`|7add460ae24c9452ae87b5a99c5aa756aa	Yes, because tattoos are like smoking, they make you look cool.<br>  <br>  lol<br>  <br>  I really dont care either way if they have tattoos or not.|`|YtAkmjoyaa	Course, why not. I actually prefer a man with at least 1 tattoo over a guy with none.<br>  A tattoo on a person doesn't change how the person's personality is.<br>  Unless they're the type using it to show off.<br>  + I got a tattoo,so why should I be hypocritical about it<br>  it's really nothing, unless maybe he has a teardrop on his cheekbone|`|jp9OzuXoaa	Yeah, why the hell does it matter if they have a tattoo or not? Unless the tattoo said murder, I definitely wouldn't have an issue dating someone with a tattoo.|`|oJ9NpqALaa	yup.<br>  i dont see why that would be a problem at all|`|vrt8bMzVaa	of course|`|2inq4zHZaa	I am married to a man that is covered in tattoos, and tattoos people for a living.  I am also heavily tattooed.  So yes.  I wouldn't date someone who wouldn't date someone who had a tattoo.  I judge those that judge. I just can't see how appearance matters when you love someone.|`|ZkrGttKaaa	If I decide, hopefully from more information than that, that I want to. There are plenty of jerkettes of every variety. Need to have known 'em at least a short while. The tattoo question isn't a factor.|`|uaHzhUeoaa	Hmm, I wouldn't think any different of them than if they didn't or did have a tattoo.  As long as Iiked something else about them.  Then I wouldn't mind the tattoo.|`|Noi62Kk6aa	Yeah sure. <br>  I'm getting a few myself.<br>  That would be stupid if I didn't.|`|LcAiHBsaaa	only if it's tribal, barbed wire or a swastika.<br>  <br>  :P|`|IS1F69mraa	Of course.|`|9aLNaMP3aa	y not? i got one myself|`|zDJ26bktaa	Do us all a favour and stay in your shell|`|ZYi2ZlUnaa	It depends on what the tattoo is, how many they have, and the reason they got it. If they got it while they were drunk or because all of their friends had one, then no. If the tattoo is of some naked lady or a bunch of curse words, then no. If their body is covered in tattoos, then no.|`|0Wtm8Bh9aa	Well, considering that I have a tat I really cant judge and say i wouldn't date someone else with a tat...only thing is tho...I don't know about the whole like, "Joel Madden" deal, like saturated in tats...like one here or there is fine...mine is hidden so the only time people see it is when im in a bikini or whatever. Yeah i dunno... when it comes down to it i guess, Im more of like if hes good to me and loves me then thats all that matters.|`|ru2IfOeraa	yeah i would<br>  i usually do <br>  i think its a way that people express themself by body art|`|K3osgjgpaa	yes definitely|`|myEbUZwyaa	YESS Tatoos are freaken hot

9UgFbc7Laa	Waxing strips are painful to use but you get used to it. The results last for longer than shaving, they're supposed to last for at least 2 weeks but they don't for me. They might for you, though. You can get waxing strips at pretty much any drugstore.<br>  <br>  Or you can try Nair or Veet which are hair removal creams. You can buy those at drugstores also.|`|GkH5NoFyaa	dry hair, anywhere on the body - pulls when you shave it. And that hurts. Shower first, then apply a cream such as hand lotion. Then shave. Use a good razor. Dull blade also pulls, and hurts.|`|44dcc209645e25a90756133f2c64c1e5aa	Have you tried any hair removal creams? You can find them at stores like CVS, Walgreen's, and Rite Aide. Maybe Target and Wal-mart. Yes, there're waxing strips at the same stores. The creams are good, waxing strips I'm not so sure about. If you have sensitive skin stay away from the creams, use the strips instead. There's a wax called Nad's that's being advertised. You should try it also.|`|31Y7QUmkaa	waxing strips really hurt much more than getting nicked by a razor! id use that shaving pad on TV if you dont want to shave. i like nair but sometimes i doesnt work. if you want to shave less often then use a lotion that prevents hair growth after shaving with a razor. or you could do the laser hair removal.|`|hkzWWuSJaa	use the new hottest product smooth away sold at all stores in the us|`|UlAMJuD7aa	Buy Smooth Away.<br>  It works great :D|`|pyEbjg31aa	You could probably go to a spa/nail salon somewhere where you can be beautified these places are guaranteed to do waxing, and it is surely  quite inexpensive.

It's only true to you (: i bet you look actually really pretty. if you look pretty in mirrors then you should look pretty online. unless facebook ruines your pics|`|bYo5UTa9aa	i think it's because cameras distort things a little. like if you are taking a picture or someone, rather than walk toward them with the camera, you should zoom in because it distorts it less. <br>  as a solution to your problem, i'm not sure about this, but i think that Kodak camera's don't distort as much as other brands. but i'm not sure about that, so don't yell at me if i'm wrong. <br>  <br>  hope i helped. =]|`|IhtABUWMaa	Maybe its your camera. I used to have that problem and when I bought a higher quality camera it worked out.|`|GiEinn85aa	what you see in a mirror isn't similar to what other people see for real. So when you look into a mirror, your bangs might be slanted to the right but when you take pictures, it comes out as left and you may find it a bit weird since you're so use to seeing yourself with your bangs slanting to the right.<br>  <br>  I'm having trouble trying to get use to the fact that pictures won't turn out the way I want them to since it's different from what I see in a mirror...|`|MA8AUiQYaa	you need alighting and try not to move the camera so much<br>  <br>  x|`|gew4KVFfaa	its all about the lighting.|`|Lrrwu7yzaa	LMFAO!! ITS SO TRUE!! AND I HAVE NO CLUE! UGH!<br>  Awesome question!!!!!|`|xfAk2KaUaa	The mirror flips your reflection around whereas the camera takes the picture exactly how you are. So try flipping your picture around and you might find you look slightly better.<br>  Also, eyes are alot better than cameras so you might need to edit the lighting and so forth in the picture so that you don't get any dark or unflattering shadows in some places. <br>  Photogenic people probably practice with their camera all day long.|`|Xw01DbCXaa	its very simple, in the mirror u will be watching ur face continuously i,e like a video .....but wen u take an image it captures that instant picture, i mean , the pose which u hav given at that time will be captured....u may hav posed good or may be bad, bad in the sense not intentionally....some kind of face movements ..<br>   It also depends on the lighting and camera also......and mirrors will also be different, some long some broader....it depends on the mirror size, ur face may look thin or little broader like that.....|`|zmfNXuwYaa	It has a lot to do with lighting and the way the flash works and the quality of your camera. You will look better in a picture taken with a high quality camera than you will will a cell phone or cheap digital camera.|`|LdKQU7QYaa	Try making a pose in the mirror, and then instead of taking a picture of the mirror, take one of you.|`|G0ino2hjaa	That's because the mirror and the camera reflect of each other and that makes a bad picture. You should try posing without the mirror and just take a regular picturee!|`|VLNwmoeQaa	I waz wonderin about that too!!! ;) i gess the person who created the camera was jealous of the prettiness of others and made the people come out ugly in pictures to relieve his/her jealosy|`|Or1AKzaoaa	omfg I have the same problem it takes like a bunch of pics before you find one you look okay in.<br>  <br>  Let me know when you've figured out a solution lol<br>  <br>  sorry im no help|`|Wwi39lwiaa	The reason why we should kill camwhores.

WZK2tKJ8aa	You must relax and I'm taking it that you're probably young, so no worries, I had the same problem, mainly due to the fact that I didn't really know what I was doing. Try different things, try using lotion, no lotion, watching porn, looking at porn magazines. And if you don't have any porn, just think of a scenario that you'd like to happen(fantasize) and wait til you are really turned on, then, that's when you start masturbating. And you can't have the same pace, when it starts to feel good, work it a lil faster. Like I said, try different things, but you must be relaxed and enjoy yourself.<br>  <br>  Also, if you're trying to do it in the shower, don't, you'll never finish while in there...lol|`|GkH5NoFyaa	stress.

Try using the bathroom right after you masturbate and see if anything happens. Or it could be that you tense up too much, may be caused my stress or muscle spasms as you are ejaculating.

Or1AKzaoaa	okays well first you need to buy or borrow a flat iron to straighten your hair.<br>  <br>  make sure its straight when you get it cut.<br>  <br>  Then its best to bring a pic with you to your hair styalist.<br>  <br>  Tell them u want it layered and chopped like the pic.<br>  <br>  After your hair cut get some hair putty or palmade like the Fiber Gum putty from Garnier Fructise or their hair wax. Alittle goes along way with that stuff so rub it with ur finger tips and apply to your hair and kinds muss it up.<br>  <br>  Hoped that helped! =)<br>  p.s ur a cutiee!!|`|oD4RVyODaa	They are both nice cuts.  The cuts are similar, just styled differently.  Just as others have said just take the pics to the salon and the beautician will do the rest.  I'm sure he/shes will also be able to show and explain to you how to do the styling.  They will probably also try to sell you the products that they use on you at the salon. Obviously, it's your decision, but you can find similar products that are cheaper at the drug store.|`|2c8a6775bb939b2b29b71a0fc4602df2aa	I like your hair as it it now :) I agree with almost everyone up there that said you are a cutie haha.<br>  But if you really want to cut it, I would say the second one would be better for you because you don't really have naturally straight hair.|`|YGeJZpqEaa	OBVIOUSLY zac efron :D<br>  I'm not sure how to get it, but your hair would look good tousled and messy, even though it's fine the way it is.|`|q2Q2uPVtaa	personally i like the first one.|`|yHaGnT4gaa	number 2|`|VLNwmoeQaa	HOT HAIR ON 2!!!!!

Kind of hard to tell. I'm guessing you're about 15-16. lol. He has thick blond hair like you only straighter. He looks so much better with shorter hair. The longer his hair is the younger he looks. Have the stylist take some weight off your hair and shorten it a bit.

YwHl37Hgaa	Vitamins B, C, F, zinc, iron, copper and protein are essential for hair growth. Drinking plenty of water and eating plenty of raw fruits and vegetables is probably the best way to achieving healthy hair.Try <a href="http://solutionsforhairgrowth.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://solutionsforhairgrowth.blogspot.c...</a> for more details.|`|8IyZphFVaa	just go to a store that sells vitamins and look at the label. if you want to take biotin and msm you should take those separately because you need to experiment with those dosages to find out what works for you. the multivitamin i have has vit a,c, d,e, b-complex, biotin, folic acid, choline, inositol, paba, calcium, magnesium, potassium, boron, iron, manganese, zinc, iodine, selenium, silica, gla, coenzyme q10, germanium, octacosanol, royal jelly, garlic, a whole bunch of amino acids, and a few herbs. i take it every other day or every 2 days and see a difference. i think it's only sold locally. the guy at the health food store i go to explained what the different things in it do. i think choline, zinc, inositol, silica, and the amino acids are good for hair/nail growth.<br>  and fish oils or flaxseed oil is also good.|`|Jh0yyYizaa	There is no miracle pill to make your hair grow faster. <br>  <br>  Nothing in the world can make your hair grow faster,<br>  but... what can help hair growth is eating lots of walnuts and veggies and fruit and water.

HzjeKsDJaa	maybe 4000<br>  <br>  <br>  .|`|gjteVB2Daa	The gold bands probably are 14 k.g. which is at an all time high at this time, but diamonds are iffy.  Are the little diamonds full cut diamonds or are they "chips"?  You would be lucky to get $1000-1500 for that ring in this market.  Can't remember what gold was priced at in 1987 but it was probably a bit lower than today.  An appraisal of $11,500 for a diamond ring must  have indicated a decent size and clarity of diamond.  A good jeweler in your area may be buying gold and Diamonds at wholesale which would be about $2,500 to 3000 for that one.  Since neither of them are "antique or vintage" styles, the market is probably full of people trying to sell jewelry at this time.  So be reasonable if you have to sell them now.  You might want to get an updated appraisal as they only cost $25 - $50 for each ring and it would be worth it to know if the value has increased or decreased so you could price them in the ball park.|`|nujen4dmaa	Firstly, sorry to hear about you mum and dad going their separate ways!<br>  <br>  You could go over to <a href="http://pricescope.com" rel="nofollow">http://pricescope.com</a> and ask if anyone knows of an appraiser in your area.  I would be getting an up to date appraisal first.  Once thats in hand, go to your local trusted jeweler and see if he is willing to take them on consignment for you.  Be reasonable with an expected price, especially in this current economic climate.  If you set your sights reasonably, hopefully the rings will sell.<br>  <br>  IdealD|`|dIS08i1oaa	First, no one can tell you for certain without looking at the rings.<br>  <br>  Second, it won't be easy to sell estate jewelry in this economy.  Most local jewelers are not buying new inventory, and wouldn't touch estate jewelry unless they are getting an incredible bargain from your mom on the price.<br>  <br>  One of the most reputable and honest estate jewelers in the country is Mr. William Noble, located in Dallas, Texas.  If I were you, I would send your question to him (his email link and website are listed below).<br>  <br>  If he is interested, you can feel secure in sending your rings to him via insured mail and he will offer you a fair price on inspection.

UvYzQv5Saa	well guys pants are usually easy to find because they are measured by waist and inseam. So measuring their inseam will give you the length and i'd measure their hips to get a close approx of the waist that they would need. add a belt and they should be set.<br>  <br>  Men's briefs are done by small medium large etc. just pick what is appropriate<br>  <br>  k
40b38b62d7defc90cd285a9a06a65e69aa	No, but oh how I wish I did.  I would have been a Billionaire years ago.  I have been a small A since junior high and I am 29.  I have contemplated on getting a boob job since I was like 14.  I can afford it now, if I wanted it bad enough, but it has to be redone every 10 years.  You also have to be laid up and in pain for a while.  You can't work, or lift things.  I have had 2 kids and still have A cups.  They were only a small B with breast milk in them.  I know it's sad.  And I am not tiny and petite.  I am 5' 8" and weigh 136 lbs.  So, I need bigger ones to make myself proportionate.  I know just what you are going through, but there is nothing you can do.  I just wish they would find a way to transfer fat from your butt or thighs to your breasts.  They do it for your lips, and butt, and other parts.  Why can't they do it for breasts?  My sister has huge DD's.  She hates them and wants a reduction.  They need to have a transplant surgery where she can donate some of her's to me.  Now I would pay for that! lol|`|tbZ8cg3Baa	theres nothing out there thats gonna make em bigger, u can keep em in place by workin out.|`|EpDTh2BJaa	eat alot of sesame seeds :)<br>  its true|`|e6zJFfd8aa	no... but be happy your flat... mine are huge and guys talk to them not my face|`|Or1AKzaoaa	ha okay i have a little trick.<br>  <br>  i actually wear 2 bras.<br>  <br>  one is push up/padded with a gel stuff which feels a bit more natural then the cotten padding stuff.<br>  <br>  the other is a normal thin bra which is actually a size smaller then what i need.<br>  <br>  put the smaller one on first then the push up one.<br>  <br>  works like a charm XD|`|c3vFddfBaa	my grandama showed my a trick<br>  you grab with your left hand your right elbow and your right hand your left elbow (like crossing your arms but extend them to the level of your shoulders)<br>  then you you contract your boob mussle(lets call it thatt) ans you will see your hand automaticly moves a little.

e1434520b7d6b7db2b483084c9ad434aaa	There are lots of companies that make products specifically for curly hair. They're mainly online however, and expensive. The big lines are Devacurl, Jessicurl, Curly Hair Solutions, and Kinky Curly. Before you invest you probably want to browse around these forums first:<br>  <a href="http://www.naturallycurly.com/curltalk/" rel="nofollow">http://www.naturallycurly.com/curltalk/</a><br>  <br>  Figuring out your hair type before hand is helpful as well:<br>  <a href="http://www.naturallycurly.com/hair-types" rel="nofollow">http://www.naturallycurly.com/hair-types</a><br>  <br>  There's also a "curlmart" on that site that sells most of the products. The code IVILLAGE  will give you 20% off. :)<br>  <br>  Anyways for softer hair I would recommend getting a very moisturizing conditioner and using a leave in under your styling products. If you want to run out and pick up some products locally, I recommend trying the following:<br>  - Drugstore: L'oreal out of bed weightless texturizer (black tub, use under gel), LA Looks or Herbal essences gels, Suave naturals or vo5 conditioners, L'oreal vive pro hydra gloss or nutri gloss for curly hair, red Cream of Nature shampoo<br>  - Organic/specialty store (like whole foods): Giovanni Direct Leave in condish, G conditioners, G tea tree shampoo, Aubrey Organics Honeysuckle Rose or White Camellia Conditioners, AO B-5 Design gel<br>  - ULTA: Devacurl products, Biosilk rock hard gelee, MOP-c curl defining cream (They also carry drugstore products and giovanni.)<br>  <br>  Some great curly care websites:<br>  <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Follow-the-Curly-Girl-Method-for-Curly-Hair" rel="nofollow">http://www.wikihow.com/Follow-the-Curly-...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.ylcf.org/gotcurl/" rel="nofollow">http://www.ylcf.org/gotcurl/</a> (outdated product recs!)<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/jessicurl" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/user/jessicurl</a><br>  <a href="http://livecurlylivefree.com/home.htm" rel="nofollow">http://livecurlylivefree.com/home.htm</a><br>  <br>  Hope this helps! :)|`|ZS7Ew7F3aa	'Care Free Curl Gold'<br>  I have the same...natural, spiral curl, but it needs help to keep the frizz down & get smooth springy curl. I've tried MANY products over the years & have settled on 'Care Free Curl Gold' (I started using it several years ago). It's in the ethnic hair section in any drug or grocery store...I'm caucasian so stumbled on this accidentally several years ago & LOVED the results. It's great in summer, too, when my hair tends to get frizzy. This stuff is a miracle worker!!<br>  <br>  Another great product is 'Infusium 23 - Leave-In Treatment' (also in any drug or grocery store). I was smitten with this product...until I found Care Free Curl ;)<br>  <br>  Both products work beautifully, neither leave your hair heavy, sticky OR 'crunchy',  & you don't have to pay salon prices for either of them.|`|UhirBjKmaa	I have curly hair and my curls are always the best. This is what I do after I shower: I use leave-in conditioner, comb it out, then add a handful of mousse, repeat step two, hair spray all of my hair for 3 sec. max, then blow dry with my head hanging down. If you do it right you'll get soft curly hair for sure because I've been doing this for seven years. I only use Frederick Fekkai leave-in conditioner, Suave Mouse with Extra Hold and Suave Hairspray.

bf6KVbhkaa	I'm biracial too,and my skin changes also. I get darker in the summer and lighter in the winter, mainly.  While there is Ambi and other skin lighteners, there is nothing to make you darker.  I would just use a good sunscreen as usual to prevent premature aging, and then just take it in stride.  You'll get darker again.  While tanning is bad for you, and you don't want to buy liquid tan, you can easily buy and use lotion with a hint of tan from any drugstore.  That way you get some tanning benefits as soon as you put your lotion on with no extra worry.|`|kqTGQTfcaa	id say the only real way to get darker would be to out in the sun... im from ohio and my best friend is mixed and in the the winter he's extremelyight skinned like almost white but during the summer he gets really dark.. id say lay out maybe an hour or 2  and i know you wouldn't wanna do this(most guys don't) but you could even go to a tanning bed which would make you darker a lot faster.|`|WEqRKZzyaa	I'm not 100% on this but I'm pretty sure that as you get older the melenin in your skin starts to fade which is why some people used to be tanner when they are younger but can no longer get the same tan when they are older so this may be what youre experiencing.  If you really want to be darker though and are unable to lay outside all of the time i would suggest going tanning (not spray tan but in a tanning bed).  If you are going to lay outside it really depends on the person how long it takes.  For me it takes about an hour or two to get a good tan but i am greek and you are black so im unsure how that compares
iAbXsxADaa	Well it's pretty much all depending on your own height and for what occasion,<br>  if you're going to a wedding or something formal stick to something shorter but if you're just randomly wearing them than go as high as you want! c:
T7lLLZtAaa	I think you should cut your split ends.  Having split ends means that the hair is dry and not receiving the proteins it needs.  The hair will continue to split further and further up until they are cut off.  Having split ends makes your hair grow slower since the ends of the hair are constantly breaking.  If you trim your hair to get rid of the split ends, you will find that your hair will grow out faster and longer and look a lot healthier.|`|lgMZJQtwaa	heey<br>  yeahh def. cut your splitends because this helps it grow and dont do it by yourself! go to the salloon aand i went there cause i am always scared they will cut off to much and i just make sure i watch adn keep telling them not to cut off alot!<br>  hope this helpss|`|ZYi2ZlUnaa	You can still go to a salon,  just tell them that you want a trim. That is mid-length hair to me, not short. To me, short is shoulder-length or shorter.|`|dUZyEIvwaa	Yes, trim not cut your hair after trimming your hair wash and condition it for about 30 to 45 minutes. This will promote growth and your hair feel and look much health-er. you will like the results.|`|egjgtuYXaa	yes you shud cut ur split ends before it damages all of your hair.dont worry hair grows back fast.its better to have short hair instead of split ends in your hair.|`|LAseDHyRaa	i think you should cut it becuase when you cut the split ends it will make your hair grow longer!!!|`|fpS90nx4aa	of course you should cut split ends.your hair will grow out healthy|`|nWHNbKIfaa	cut all the split ends so your hair can grow faster and healthier|`|ru2IfOeraa	Fa sho you should cut your split ends <br>  not cutting them avoids your hair from grwoing fast and healthy<br>  and if you cut them ever 1-2 months your hair grows faster|`|Draugm5qaa	yes, keep your hair healthy by cutting off the ends. <br>  it will also grow faster, so you won't need extensions !<br>  <br>  hope this helps|`|11QzdN87aa	Okay i feel like my hair dressers do the same when i get mine cut, like i lost alot of length.. it might feel like that but its just because your hair feels lighter and i say go to the hairdresser and say i want to keep ALL my length, and watch them carefully and be really descriptive as to what you want for exact results..|`|DTg3USppaa	well, I'd take probably 1/2 inch off just to keep the length. If your hair looks frizzy, you might want to go a little more. But if you feel that you can put your hair up and make it look pretty, don't cut it off :)|`|jcEtRUVZaa	Yep, and here's why:<br>  <br>  How to Repair Your Hair's Split Ends<br>  <a href="http://www.ehow.com/how_4773578_repair-hairs-split-ends.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ehow.com/how_4773578_repair-h...</a>|`|hwtIZH7Yaa	yeah i would say to get the split ends out of there it will grow faster and be more healthy|`|qARzK8lfaa	Yes, just get an inch of at least.<br>  It's only hair it will grow back.
0AQF8pnKaa	Try buying higher-waisted jeans instead of the low rise kind. I think they also sell special underwear for low rise jeans at aerie or victoria's secret. You can also wear a thong, though those are unhealthy and it'll sorta be like wearing no underwear (which will itch for you). If you're wearing a tank top underneath your sweater you can just pull it past your butt so that way when you bend down it won't ride up and expose your back.<br>  <br>  hope this helps|`|0BdTKNZzaa	Sew them into your jeans.|`|AA11615514	Victorias Secret sells low-rise panties in a variety of styles.

Bh8Wmhmaaa	wow, the way your hair naturally is sounds really cute  :)<br>  <br>  <br>  but, if you want it straight, your should get layers, & then add volume to the layers after you get them done<br>  <br>  or if you don't want to get it cut you can use your straightner & just curl your hair with it(like you would with a curling iron)|`|7PcaEeIMaa	definetly, DO NOT do all that stuff. look i bet your really pretty, why would you do all that bad stuff to your hair? my advice, leave it the way it is.

qIVy4eloaa	i want those hair styles too. <br>  <br>  well you better show that picture to your hairstylist. if your hair moisturizer makes your hair worst, you must stop using those, you better check out some other conditioner and moisturizer. get a hair relax, hair re-bond or something like that. just don't do those too much. don't iron your hair too much it will look dry. dont blow dry too much too. it will make your hair look frizzy. stop adding chemicals on your hair. just shampoo and conditioner alternately.|`|jSda7oDnaa	well lets see stop highlighting it stop using a straightener and use a brush and a blow dryer and it will come out nice if you don't believe me see for your self. also, maybe try to use a little more conditioner, and comb through you hair after you condition it in the shower. Also try not to brush your hair violently.|`|vomkbci7aa	well first you can shampoo and condition your hair every other day and use herbal essenses shampoo and conditioner, your hair looks fine in that picture but maybe try to stop getting highlights and if you chemically straiten your hair then stop doing that and maybe see a good hair salon and then they might be able to get it natural if you want it that way.|`|F3dWvVy5aa	Oh your hair would be pretty like that its just the type of cut and some highlights.

So consume lots of fruits.<br>  Rub raw or ripe papaya on your face to get a smooth and glowing skin.<br>  Drink juice of pineapple for body and facial pains.<br>  Boil mangoes leaves and skin in water and apply for skin infection.<br>  Apply a paste of ground sesame seeds with water as poultice for inflammation of the skin due to allergies, skin rashes, and pimples.|`|eUFW55X8aa	anitoxidents, vitamin E, lots of fruits and vegi's|`|L5rUAciZaa	Just eat fruits.

Shirts are very thin.<br>  People just like it because of the name. <br>  <br>  A hoody or "Fleece", as they call it, is like $60 there...waste of money =/|`|mgM1Ot3Oaa	ppl that judge others for what stores they buy things from are usually in elemntary thru junior high school. they just think there cool because they can afford something ridiculously expensive. def. not worth it. hoodies in aero are as cute they just say aero and are cheaper which is better because you can get more of them. try cuter and better stores like forever 21 and charlotte russe. im not trying to say that a and f completely sucks, sometimes there are cute cheap stuff, but a hoodie costs around 75? i would never buy something like that. buy 5 hoodies instead from somewhere else youll prob be glad you did<br>  <br>  <br>  sorry dont be hating. hope this makes sense. but its so long bc i needed to get my point across since thats one thing that really annnnnoyyyyyyysssss meeeeeeeeeeeee! grrr|`|0Wf3Au4kaa	Everyone is talking about it because it is supposedly "cool."<br>  Their clothes are expensive and not very good quality.<br>  All you're really paying for is that tiny moose and the brand name "Abercrombie."<br>  <br>  When you could buy something that is much more original and creative and WORTH the money, why would you buy Hollister or Abercrombie?|`|FNVYW5zuaa	Every one likes abercrombie because it is a name brand.They feel cool and that they fit in wearing this brand. I have to say that I am a fan just because of the name.

WkcYzNjSaa	I'm not a fan of the first one. However I really like the last 2. The Jessica Simpson shoe would make the dress look a little more casual, but also looks like it would be more comfortable especially to dance in. I bet you would get more use out of these ones also, as they would look great with jeans or business wear. The silver Guess shoes are just the opposite - more dressy and probably will make your feet hurt. You probably couldn't reuse these as often - only for formal occasions with dresses. <br>  <br>  I would suggest trying each of them on first and at least walking around the store before you commit to one. It that's not possible and these are only available online, (and I've done this before) if you have the money - buy both, try each of them on with the dress - and send back the one you don't like. (I think one of them even said free shipping and free return shipping!)
8IyZphFVaa	there could be a lot of reasons why your hair is falling out. you should talk to a dermatologist but you should also try researching it yourself so you don't end up just doing or buying whatever the doctor throws at you.|`|o6VN0SY9aa	If your bald spots are completely hairless and the size of dime, then it must be Alopecia Areata. My bro found a website called www.alopecia-areata-cure.com when he had a similar problem. <br>  <br>  Checkout the images in the website. Its informative and suggests some treatments too. Wish you a quick recovery.|`|3fa42e1d5f13f37e2ec069fe32521d2caa	You might have alopecia, it causes hair to fall out, go see a dermatologist.
IPirciPFaa	lol no you will not die or it will not spread to your brain. First of you got the infection because you put a earing in your nose that is not supposed to be there and you probably did not disinfect it either. You have to take it off your nose asap and clean your nose were the piercing is with disinfectant or alcohol clean it once a day and don't put anything in your nose until its not infected anymore or you can put a proper earing in and clean around it everyday until its heeled so it wont close.|`|4cd2c7649e1949de04b5f7bdd1c51814aa	Go see your doctor right away!!!!  He'll prescribe an antibiotic for you to take. Take ALL of the medicine. When you mutilate your body with piercings, you take a really big chance of getting an infection by not practicing good sterilization & sanitation habits. Yes, infections can go to the brain, especially oral infections that are ignored also. Until the doctor can see you, cleanse the area often with Hydrogen Peroxide poured onto a clean cotton ball. It will bubble a lot & hopefully, it will clean the area of some of the infection. Once infection gets into the bloodstream, only an antibiotic will get rid of the infection completely. Once you get a high fever & you haven't seen a doctor, get to the ER....ASAP.

ZWJae0BJaa	ask for layers because they enhance your natural waves. also, get two or three curly hair products because it's nice to have options. i use garnier fructis wonder waves. it's a spray and it isnt crunchy at all. nice, soft waves. garnier fructis surf hair hair putty...gives you surf hair, but it kinda makes your hair frizzy, but its not like, frizz...then theres the totally twisted gel by herbal essances. crunchy, but makes your hair on the edge of curly. also, don't brush your hair out all the way. it makes your waves flat. use a comb to part it, then finger brush it. scrunch it before you put any product in to give it extra shape. limit hot tool use, because it gives you split ends and split ends=frizz. these are pretty much all my tricks, hope you find them useful :D|`|EIBbzumuaa	half up half down, or front pinned up, or add tiny braids in your ponytail, or a side pony|`|rY84Ap6Maa	go to a hair salon or put it in a bun or french braid it.|`|NGEIyOS2aa	<a href="http://hairbrained.files.wordpress.com/2008/03/wavy-hair-with-band-from-more-com.png" rel="nofollow">http://hairbrained.files.wordpress.com/2...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  just make sure to put some mousse on it so it wont frizz.! =]]

tnoyKjJ1aa	i would say bringing a picture can only help...<br>  <br>  i dont think the color will turn out exactly like the picture but im sure they will do a good job and get as close as possible|`|HypqcnJaaa	Nope that's not weird at all. And yess just ask them to make it look like the pic. It's actually good because they'll get a visual of exactly what you want. =D|`|VezcCTqOaa	going to a salon with an image of exactly what you want is always a good idea. it helps you clearly communicate what you want without a chance for misunderstanding.|`|7QN9wetGaa	well its better than having to explain to them<br>  cuz wat if they do it wrong so jst<br>  take in the picture.|`|oN8YZnQoaa	No, that's smart. If they're good, it should look the same.|`|pw3y3Eo0aa	no itz not weird<br>  they will get i as close to the picture as they can|`|Z94iLLamaa	That's probably the best thing you CAN do.<br>  <br>  Then they know exactly what you want done and they'll try and do they're best to match that.<br>  <br>  If it's a good salon they should have no probably matching it.|`|WGQUyNWAaa	That's what you are supposed to do. However, since a picture doesn't have the name of the die, they will try their best to match it but no promises.
5oEJuhwiaa	i've never seen one that says that but it sounds nice! <br>  <br>  I wear a purity ring but mine doesn't say anything its a crucifix with jesus on it.<br>  <br>  there are rings that say wwjd as in what would jesus do. or love waits like you mentioned. <br>  <br>  You can always get a regular purity ring that doesn't say anything and just go and get it inscribed. Some people get inscriptions that say 'my choice', 'i have decided', 'my decision', or 'my path' some people have rings that actually say 'purity' on them. Your ring can say whatever you want it to it means the same thing no matter what.<br>  <br>  Just be sure you want one and that you plan on keeping your promise. And I really do hope it isn't because the jonas brothers...I cant tell you how annoyed I get with all the "did you get that ring because of the jonas brothers" questions. Because god forbid some people aren't jonas mutants! sorry i'm beginning to rant lol.|`|HypqcnJaaa	Why don't you get it engraved?
5afkd7Vpaa	most people call it golden brown or dark amber, dirty blonde, light almond...|`|jgtfWjE4aa	medium brown??|`|cwsYM2F4aa	If you have a color printer, print that picture off and take it to your stylist.|`|11QzdN87aa	it seems like just a simple dark/medium brown color.. you would have to go to a store that sells hair dye with that picture in color and compare it to the boxes and you'll find out an exact name.. or you can compare it online at a hair dye's site..|`|eqxrSzNgaa	That is a very beautiful color, and it is chestnut brown with golden undertones. I hope if you get it it looks great on you!!! (Thats a really nice color!!!)|`|ZYi2ZlUnaa	I dunno. If you're planning on dying it that color, just bring a picture and go to a professional|`|DFut3S3Caa	um sort of a light brown but sort of a dirty blonde with the majority of brown...<br>  <br>  does that help????|`|7080iLoLaa	Chestnut brown with golden undertones|`|e0ttkqI6aa	golden brown
FtfUvyDsaa	you should try making your hair super extra ridiculously curly it is very strange...maybe you could do a pink blue or purple extension or red tips that would be really cool
C0HZ8ZB4aa	Is the unique factor very important?<br>  <br>  I say this because there are a lot of sweet ideas out there for child tribute tattoos, but most have been thought of and done quite a few times. People often strive to be unique with the design and/or placement of a tattoo, only to find that it might become popular later down the line or that it isn't necessarily as nice as some of the ideas that have already become quite popular.<br>  <br>  The tribute I have for my son isn't overly unique - I haven't seen another quite like it but it is a simple concept - I have his name tattooed in a large, cursive font between my shoulder blades, surrounded by black ivy and nice flourishy detail, with his birthdate underneath. Perhaps not the most original of things, but it looks lovely and I love it.<br>  <br>  One of the most popular ideas around at the moment is the footprints thing. I've never actually seen one in real life but I've seen a few on the internet. The parent will take the footprints of the baby (or in some cases the handprints - this is a bit rarer) and have them replicated exactly onto their skin (pick a good artist for this), perhaps with their name or some sort of floral design around it. That looks great and is such a sweet tribute, but I wouldn't call it unique.<br>  <br>  You have the obvious option of a portrait - but you would need to pick a specialist artist if you went down this route - I've seen a lot of portraits done by standard tattoo artists that just don't capture any personality and often don't even capture a likeness at all. But when done by the right person, they can look beautiful and are an amazing way of capturing a point in your child's life.<br>  <br>  You could wait until your daughter is a little older, and has perhaps a favourite toy, or story book, or animal of some sort, and take an image from the story or an image of the toy/animal etc. and have a design based on this. Alternatively you could have a general symbol of young childhood - perhaps a rattle or something similar.<br>  <br>  Some parents choose to have the names of their young ones in a foreign language, for example Hebrew or Sanskrit or Kanji. This is something I personally don't understand, particularly when it's your child and you have no ties to that language, but it's of course about personal tastes and they can look quite nice, so that is something you might perhaps want to consider. Similarly, if you wanted something small and discreet, you could simply have a tattoo of her birthdate in Roman Numerals.<br>  <br>  Other ideas, once again not particularly unique, but some people choose to have tattoos of their child's zodiac symbol, or birthstone. A similar but slightly more creative idea that I've not heard of many people doing for a child - you could have a tattoo of the animal that corresponds to the chinese year your daughter was born in. I've just looked up what 2008 is - and unfortunately this is the year of the rat - which is perhaps not something you would want to have as a tattoo for your daughter haha - but it's an idea anyway!<br>  <br>  You could pick something a bit more general but symbolic by perhaps incorporating the colour of her birthstone - perhaps a flower of this colour.<br>  <br>  Another idea, if you didn't mind waiting until your daughter was a bit older again - when she is old enough to be able to write her name, or draw a little picture, you could take this writing or picture to a tattoo artist and have him replicate it exactly onto your skin. I have a tattoo of a lovely note my mother wrote to me shortly before she died, in her exact handwriting, and it looks exactly how it did on the card and means so much to me.<br>  <br>  If you intend to have a few more children - you could have a tattoo of a bracelet or anklet, and for your daughter add a charm, and for each child you have afterwards, add another charm.<br>  <br>  Another idea is to have an tattoo based on the meaning behind your child's name. I've looked up Olivia and the meaning is simply 'olive', which is unfortunate as Olivia is such a beautiful name it's a shame there is not a more profound meaning behind it that you could base a tattoo idea on, but if you were into more unusual imagery and could find an interesting way of having an olive tattooed upon your skin - this would certainly be unique!<br>  <br>  Another idea you could go for is to find a lovely quote about a mother's love for her child or similar, have this tattooed and perhaps your daughter's name below. There are lots of great quote websites on google. Some example quotes I found which are nice:<br>  "Children are the keys of paradise."<br>  If you're religious - "Every child born into the world is a new thought of God, an ever fresh and radiant possibility".<br>  "Children are the bridge to heaven"<br>  "Children are the anchors that hold a mother to life"<br>  <br>  Okay I'm running out of ideas now. But I hope you manage to find so|`|3mAgM405aa	Before considering any tattoo operation, check out the new removable tattoo dyes at <a href="http://www.infinitink.com/consumer/" rel="nofollow">http://www.infinitink.com/consumer/</a>  should you later regret the design and want the tattoo removed painlessly.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|80I1aHSGaa	I took the time to check on the meaning of your daughter's name Olivia and it turns out that it was derived from the Olive tree which resembles beauty and dignity, maybe you can have an idea from this. A good picture of an olive tree or leaf with your daughter's name on it.|`|ejvCttS6aa	AWWW, thats really sweet! okay, idk if you're going to understand it... but im gonna try to explain. You could get the phrase "my baby girl Olivia" tattooed into the letters of her name. So, you would have Olivia tatooed on you, but the phrase "my baby girl Olivia," would fill in each letter of her name. I hope this helped....

I just got my tongue pierced and the actually piercing itself didn't hurt too bad, besdies the fact that the guy stopped half way through but now its sore and its my 3rd day with it.

jp9OzuXoaa	Totally depends on where you get the piercing on your body AND where you go to get it done.<br>  <br>  Claires and Icing pierce ears for cheap. 20-30 dollars. They don't pierce anything else though. Parlors would be about 40 for ears. Other body piercings can get up to $100 depending on where you get it. Google the piercing you want to get and see how much they usually cost.|`|6CMfKxiMaa	it obviously depends on what piercing your talking about.<br>  probably 30-100|`|hOGAgVASaa	50-100|`|qq159sWMaa	go there and ask
YwHl37Hgaa	Yes.Use flat beer to help prevent spit ends do it once or 2 times a month put it straight on your hair, wrap it in a towel for 1 to 2 hours and rinse out.

ik1c9sTKaa	Diet and exercise. <br>  <br>  Drink lots of water and eat lots of fiber. Cut back on processed carbs. Eliminate all added suger, white bread, potato chips. No energy drinks Gatorade, soda-pop, or coffee with added sugar. If you can avoid milk, do.<br>  <br>  Replace with water, carb/suger free enrgey drinks, black coffee, coke zero. Even 100% fruit juice shoudl be kept to a minimum. Instead eat fresh fruits with water.<br>  <br>  Get lots of cardio. In other words, sweat. Sweat clears the pours of dirt and dead skin cells that trap bacteria and cause inflammation. After you sweat, shower. Use a face cleanser with salicylic acid. Avoid benzoyl peroxide and products with alcohol as it over dries the skin and can actually make acne worse. Proactive is actually very good if you can afford it. Also use a scrub that will help remove dead skin cells and embedded dirt.<br>  <br>  Keep your sheets and pillow cases clean. wash them twice a week if you can. dirt and dead skin accumulate on them and cause clogged pours with leads to blemishes.<br>  <br>  Almost forgot. Keep your hands off your face. Popping zits and squeezing blackheads can cause scars, lead to more clogged pours and further irritate the condition.|`|Mbg9YrSUaa	pop them or scratch them out LMAO!!!|`|ZNSgjcxpaa	Zits are pustules or papules, and pustules/papules or both types of acne. If you have rubbing alcohol, antibiotic ointment, exfoliating cream, and astringent (sea breeze), most types of acne can be resolved. <br>  1) Use exfoliating cream in the shower. Rinse thoroughly.<br>  2) Use sea breeze, let dry.<br>  3) Use alcohol. Ley dry.<br>  4) Massage antibiotic ointment into popped/bleeding zits to kill bacteria.<br>  If this dries out your skin, use cocoa butter lotion to moisturize.<br>  PS: This is my own routine and it does work for most people.|`|zmfNXuwYaa	Use a hot wash cloth and lay it over your face to open up your pores.<br>  <br>  Mint is very good for drying up zits, too.|`|jH2NZTCuaa	honey, and zits is acne.

I would suggest trying Clean and Clear (works very well for my cousin). Make sure not to touch your face too much. Or pop them! you do not want any scars! Ok and make sure to use products that don't block pores. Or try some home remedies. But just be patient. and please  Don't let your skin get the best of you. Be confident.

That means you have a sunburn but it's not that bad, and when it's gone it gets tan.
MehqmwZXaa	It depends on what your natural and dye colors are and which one is darker, but I think the only option is to dye it as close as you can to your natural color. <br>  <br>  That's what I did. <br>  <br>  But take into account that it will fade a bit and your roots will be noticeable again. Of course, not as much as they probably are now. <br>  <br>  Another option is to cut it short, but I'm guessing you don't want to do that. It's a big decision, after all. <br>  <br>  Hope I've helped.
glRVp2Mdaa	It's very difficult, especially since a lot of the trends go toward lower rise bottoms that are unflattering even on the fittest/best of bodies.  I've had luck with mid-rise pants but they are hard to find. It's also difficult to find nice pieces for the top, because the trends seem to be tunic types, which are unflattering too.  I tend to stay with classic, tailored looks, in prints/colors that are "in" and just do the best I can.  There are some fashionable designers for the full figured types like us, but they are too pricey for my budget and for that reason, I can't tell you any off hand.  I'm sure that someone will be able to.  <br>  <br>  Take Care!! :-)|`|xxSGhywoaa	It's quite hard.  I end up wearing/buying the same outfits over and over because I know it looks good at an affordable cost.|`|AA11156937	Not hard if you shop alot.
WEqRKZzyaa	definitely! you definitely want to start out slow and work your way up. you should start out with about half of the maximum time allowed (ex. if it is a 20 minute bed only go in for 10) going a few times a week should help you build up a good tan but you definitely don't want to go if you are still burnt from the time before, however it is better if you don't burn at all (so be patient and don't go in for too long)  So basically the key is to work your way up from short amounts of time.  Since you burn easily im assuming that it takes a while for you to tan so you want to go as much as possible without getting burnt. so i would go every other day just as long as you are not burnt from the time before! if you keep going when you are burnt it will just get worse!  Basically don't go in for too long, work the time up, and dont go if your burnt! good luck!|`|FVUoFqPGaa	yes you can tan. the key to tanning,is to go for shorter times.and build up your time in the tanning bed. start with just 10min. two or three times.if you do not burn,then go in for 15min. if you feel burned or a little red,wait until it heels.do not keep going day after day when you feel burnt. "do not go in for 30min. the first". you will burn so bad you will not go again. and will not tan!

They say you're only 2 weeks away from a good cut. lol|`|CvsZVTUTaa	Long hair is so pretty. =]<br>  <br>  Here are your options:<br>  <br>  Hair Growing Pills - my friend had these and her hair grew 2x its length in the amount of time<br>  <br>  Extensions - my hair is naturally long, but I love really long hair. You can get extensions to clip in for whenever you want to wear them or get them sewn in at the salon.<br>  <br>  Hair oils/mosturizers - take a trip to Sephora or Ulta and look for some  hair norturing products like a lotion or spray for your hair. The healthier it is, the faster it grows beautifully.<br>  <br>  Trimming your hair - no matter what anyone tells you, getting your hair trimmed just a bit every month will result in faster growing hair. You're getting rid of the dead ends which makes the hair grow more and healthy.<br>  <br>  <br>  I just love long hair. =]<br>  Try any of those options above.|`|POFdWpUzaa	Hair grows about 1/2 inch per month and there's absolutely nothing you can do to hasten this. You can, however, keep split and dry ends trimmed which will guard against breakage and having to cut more off at a time. Get trims every 6 weeks, just the ends. Be patient and use good hair products, don't blow dry or use the curling iron too much as this dries your hair and causes breakage. Don't brush your hair when it's wet, only when it's dry. Use a big tooth comb when it's wet. Take a look at the website below and google taking care of long hair for many, many other websites with lots of information. Good luck with your hair.|`|D0Dwnkuhaa	Trim your ends every 6 weeks, most salons have free trims, I hear. <br>  Vitamin E helps, I think. <br>  Massaging your scalp in the shower makes your hair grow out quicker, and it feels nice.|`|W0U5HdIOaa	Comb your hair often it untangles the hair letting it grow straight and quickly.

3ece80164c2739cc39f908768c919b69aa	Don't tell me that game is still around! It was really popular in the 1980s. It was always using jelly bracelets back then.

Natural easy to apply eyeliner I'd go to prescriptives, they had really soft nice eyeliner. If not then try Nars brand, though I can remember where they sell it.<br>  <br>  Honestly making your eyes vibrant all depends on your eye color, the shades you chose to compliment it and the effects you give it. For instance, sometimes I'll use this turquoise almost shiny eyeliner on my bottom lid then go over the outer half of it with dark blue liner and for a final touch use a silverish liner around the tear duct to give a really awesome effect (I have green eyes). It really all depends on your color tones, be it, eye color or skin tones etc.<br>  <br>  As per your skin, my fave brand to work with is neutrogena however I cant really recommend anything unless I know more about your skin, is it dry, oily, normal. Its very important to address your skind type with facewash and moisturizers to make sure you dont dry out or break out|`|qjaWgov8aa	Okay, so if any price is fine, you should go with a higher end brand, because with makeup, the cheaper it is, the more likely your skin could react to it.<br>  <br>  The best way to get shiny, but not oily, skin is to use a moisturizer before bed. I use Khiel's ultra facial moisturizer. Just put a dab on each cheek, forehead, chin and nose, and rub it in and around. This stuff is like miracle serum, and I swear by it. As for color, you don't even have to buy blush! The best way to get a healthy glow is to lightly pinch your cheeks for 30 seconds, this gives you the perfect flushed, but not crazy looking, shade for your color. If you want your lashes to look natural, stay away from MAC, and try Maybelline or Covergirl, which are pretty cheap.<br>  <br>  I'm a teen too, and I like to just wear eyeliner, mascara, lip gloss, and cover up. For eyeliner try:<br>  Sephora brand-about 5 bucks, comes in lots of colors, like brown, white, black, blue, etc. I like to put white on the inner corners of my eyes because it makes you look more awake, and the rest with either black or brown in a light, thin, precise line. <br>  <br>  For cover-up:<br>  Kiehls, Nars, or Smashbox-A little bit more expensive, usually around $15, maybe more, but totally worth it. Very natural<br>  <br>  For lip gloss:<br>  Nars, MAC, Covergirl, Victoria's Secret- Victoria's Secret is my favorite because it's only $7, or 2 for $12, and they have really good flavors, because what else is there to do in math class besides lick off your good tasting lip gloss? lol...I like their spearmint or bubble it up because they make your breath smell good too.<br>  <br>  Good luck! And remember, less is more.

oKEkKhd4aa	I'm skinny too!  So the things that I wear are, usually more fitted shirts, since skinny people can get away with wearing them.  I also wear dark wash jeans and miniskirts too, they can look flattering on skinny people|`|eb830ngraa	Longer shirts are always good if you are taller...Tank tops are always cute and since you are skinny they would be easy to pull off. This may be random to you but if you are tan bright colors are always good. And if you are pail light colors are good. What I like are shirt dresses with leggings. Hope i helped|`|dKUSJ23Qaa	im skinny and i wear everything, lol and it all looks good, seriously, i can wear the ugliest shirt and still make it look good, the power of us skinny people :D|`|NpJk2Heraa	NO skinny shirts. Babydoll tops or like normal T-shirts.
vvLC5zaaaa	yeah, maybe the wind dryed it out, try some moisturizer|`|h2CuFTRfaa	probably|`|5Dr5cvkwaa	Maybe Rosacea???<br>  <br>  Rosacea (roz-ay-sha) is a very common benign skin disorder that affects many people worldwide. As of 2008, it is estimated to affect at least 14 million people in the United States alone. The main symptoms of this facial condition include red or pink patches, visible broken blood vessels, small red bumps, red cysts, and pink or irritated eyes. Most people with the disease may not even know they have rosacea or that it is a diagnosable and treatable condition. Many patients may just assume they blush easily or have gotten sunburned.<br>  <br>  Rosacea is basically different than acne, although the two can coexist.<br>  <br>  What are the signs and symptoms of rosacea?<br>  <br>  Typical signs and symptoms include facial flushing, redness, burning, red bumps, and cysts. The symptoms tend to come and go. The skin may be clear for weeks, months, or years and then erupt again. Rosacea tends to evolve in stages and typically causes inflammation of the skin of the face, particularly the forehead, cheeks, nose, and chin.<br>  <br>  When rosacea first develops, it may appear, then disappear, and then reappear. However, the skin may fail to return to its normal color and the enlarged blood vessels and pimples arrive in time. Rosacea may rarely reverse itself.<br>  <br>  Rosacea generally lasts for years, and, if untreated, it tends to worsen.|`|mhp7JKMNaa	Skin irritation. Get some lotion. Any will do.|`|Fx4ILfadaa	Okay, have you tried popping it? not all pimples have white heads, some have black heads some are just red.. some are under the skin too. <br>  <br>  If it doesn't work popping it, then i would highly assume that it's just dry skin.. nothing to worry about! <br>  <br>  You can put moisturizer on it if you like it will make it less dry over time and fix it altogether :)
s4psKJrPaa	i think so. keep it in longer than it says to be sure tho :)<br>  <br>  mine? <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090307174139AAVUaLV">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|6LPxzVsPaa	Yes. But red hair would still keep on growing.
TGuePBsqaa	On colors, i think that the silver is cuter, but they are both kind of ugllly.|`|VGy0iFMAaa	Watch 2|`|D6M975deaa	They're the same watch but different color. I think they are both really ugly but id have to go with the first one.
BphZi9yDaa	my wedding dress was boned, it was a little annoying by the end of the night, another dress would probably be better for dancing.
7REKQKmoaa	just do whatever you want im not a stick but even if i was i still dont think i woulf be happy with myself so i dont bother.<br>  <br>  but you donmt realise thst you probably still wont be happy even if you were that thin so you buy other things to make up for it<br>  <br>  maybe if you exercised a little bit everyday like 30 minutes a day you would feel happier with yourself now im not saying you will deninatley lose weight it just might change you perspective on your body. Wear the make up but dont look like a clown and start wearing a ring and just keep it on all the time.<br>  PLease stop; thinking about everyone else and just start thinking about yourself.|`|CxDZT8FJaa	Don't put yourself down, you are a very pretty girl, just let that hair grow back out again and let it grow longer than it was before and pretty soon you will be breaking allot of hearts with your good looks, don't listen to the others you will do just fine.|`|NzIywCkpaa	there is nothing wrong with you... just don't let those people get to you. the people who appreciate you for who you are should be the only people you copy/ listen too :)|`|y9N3DsKBaa	First stop wasting your money on junk. Second most guys do not like stick thin. Personally I don't even like make up on a girl.<br>      Look around you and you will see girls of all sizes shapes and many different looks. Guess what their boy friends all tell them they are beautiful.<br>      Beauty shines through from the inside. It is natural. You can't buy it. But you can stop hiding it.<br>      Clean, neat and natural is the way to go.  Join a gym but to get toned and firm not skinny. The starving Ethiopian look with ribs sticking out is not in.|`|0AQF8pnKaa	yes, you way over do it. instead of using $1000 on junk you're never going to use, try using that money to help people out. obviously all that money you waste isn't helping at all. seems to make people hate rather then like you.|`|YSmYkc5Yaa	Anybody that drops almost a thousand dollars on makeup and hair just to impress people, has something wrong with them.<br>  <br>  That's not right...<br>  <br>  You need to stop living your life for other people. Yes, you're young. But when you start maturing, you'll realize that you wasted a lot of time and money trying to impress people that will not matter to you. Ever.<br>  <br>  The only thing you need to do is gain some confidence and stop trying to impress people.

AILK0BTiaa	yes.. i'm surprised with these what's in what's in style questions.. a real fashionista is confident in her choices and wears whatever she likes and as a result she makes it "in" be confident!!! :o)|`|sg0m6LBRaa	..why not.<br>  there a bunch of htem at pacsun that never seem to sell out.<br>  it can mean two things:<br>  1) no one boys them<br>  or<br>  2) they keep restocking because there that popular.|`|Rpp53LbHaa	Personally, i think they are tacky.<br>  <br>  but to everyone else, they seem so.<br>  <br>  so...i guess they are still "in"...for now atleast.|`|evG6zBBKaa	It's still in but more of different chades of blue/indigo. However in spring, colors like yellow and pink will be highly in style.|`|rOaE0cnRaa	oh yeah :)<br>  The most in right now would be colored skinnys<br>  :)<br>  which are soo cute :D|`|x0gquSCsaa	sure :)|`|wLFahWZbaa	OH YEA ! i cant tell you how many people ive seen wearing colored denim! i think theyre awesom if you wear it right

AA11074814	Absolutely yes. Redheads are instantly eye-catching and that's why other girls are jealous. Nothing like a natural redheaded girl to put a blond or brunette to shame without any effort. The word ginger is way too overused, abused, and now it's just meh. <br>  Redheads come in a whole variety of shades like: dark, natural, and light coppers; blond, light, dark, and natural strawberry; or light, natural, dark, and ruby auburns; burgundy shades; and yes, even some ginger tints.|`|EBKPbkj7aa	yes, embrace your hair.<br>  DON'T DYE IT :O<br>  i like it, because it looks nice.<br>  plus red heads are going to be extinct in a decade :(|`|5itFktgLaa	It depends. I've gone out with a red head before, she was gorgeous, but i've got to say, if its red, its got to be long and straight in my books. Curly red hair reminds me of Ronald McDonald. <br>  <br>  It offends me that red heads get so much **** for no real reason, there is nothing wrong with having red hair. I personally believe its because of the marketing/commercial reality we live in, where blondes and brunettes dominate the fashion and advertising market.|`|UGDMYh0Kaa	<a href="http://media-content.flixya.com.s3.amazonaws.com/files/fordac57738.jpg?AWSAccessKeyId=1TKE66PETJJHG8051M02&Expires=2100475152&Signature=L0riEEuW9hSA72SqXfoNJc7bFfQ%3D" rel="nofollow">http://media-content.flixya.com.s3.amazo...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  now THATS fakkin cuteee! lol|`|aIp4AmLSaa	I've only ever seen 1 woman with ginger hair who looked good.<br>  i just don't find it attractive at all. i don't no why it is.|`|WPao1l5naa	it depends. post a picture and we will see|`|qyWfckScaa	no offense but no because blond es and gingers think their all that but mexicans rule

WywtJ5Vdaa	50+ waterproof suncream or wear a t-shirt|`|gfUUvnpvaa	There is a very easy solution to your problem. Wear as much SPF as you want and reapply after a couple of hours if you stay out in the sun for a long time. This will keep you from getting too tan. <br>  <br>  P.S. Why wouldnt you want a tan? A bronze/tan look makes ANYONE look better and is very attractive.|`|S9nthF7vaa	swim inside...<br>  or use LOTS of sunscreen.
27hANXS4aa	i know February's was a hand cream
SzubaKbuaa	I love it...it really does a good job preventing your hair from getting damaged. I don't know about too thick hair...but you could pump up the heat. I use it on medium heat and I have medium thickness hair. But its really good!|`|3f84c73de2c0e31943a5c269dafcd272aa	ehh it is good but it damages to much if you use it daily it takes awy all the shine and don't use it with alot of layers in your hair ends up looking too poofy. I had to go buy a CHi after I got a scene haircut.|`|e6zqKLGHaa	YES!! i use every other day and it leaves my hair soft and makes it look shiny plus, i have really thick, wavy, long hair and i get done straightening in like 35mins.

a68665ef6c4434c025138a75281114eeaa	wait until the next day. i tried something similar to that and had a beautiful mustache of pimples for a week:(|`|HOdblqIkaa	its bad for your skin. waxing takes off a layer of your skin (mostly dead) and then adding the lotion on top of fresh skin you might cause irritation. best thing to do is soak a rag in hot water and press it against the area you plan to wax for 5-10 min, pat dry and wax the area. after pluck any remaining hairs and rub just a dot of baby oil on the fresh area. if you still have hairs you need to get rid of wait 2 days before using a cream. over time you might develop a reaction to both at the same time so space them a few days apart to give your skin a chance to recuperate.

5hIVsBx8aa	i have acne also and I got to a dermatologist. You might be thinking like wow it's not that serious, but it could get that serious. I would seriously consider going, because it will do wonders.<br>  <br>  Anyway, in the meantime, I would try clean and clear. I used it when I had mild acne and it worked pretty well. I would suggest to buy everything from washes to creams and masks.|`|BJcJbIZsaa	i use this clean and clear acne stuff. it comes in a tube that looks like neosporin. you put a thin layer on your acne, and it helps get rid of them. it has worked good for me. you can get it at wal-mart or other stores for $6
TKf6z1vHaa	I can't say that I really have started again. I am 21 now, and I look different that when I did in hs but it is for the better. Some people do age younger. For example Lauren Conrad who is 23-24 ish, she lives in Cali where there is the sun and people tan and she has the face of a 30 year old. So I would avoid tanning and try to use moisturizer and creams.

I was very fit so my body looked fine, but my skin showed more wrinkles, freckles & a little sagging.  By age 36 I had 2 kids and looked much older.  Aging, lack of sleep & slacking off on my exercise routine/healthy diet are to blame.|`|m8alP5kPaa	Avon has many excellent products to help with aging skin at decent prices.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youravon.com/mvarnes" rel="nofollow">http://www.youravon.com/mvarnes</a>|`|2COaydcfaa	You should never ask a lady her age And you should never ask when she thought she was ageing Silly person|`|wcDS1Libaa	im 13 and at 12 !!!:(<br>  i got frown lines and lines around my eyes (N)
