I am currently 12 years old and love to go to movies and buy clothes like all the time! My mom said that she can't be giving me money all the time so I have decided to get some of my own money! So me and my mom have decided I should do some yard work for people who can't find the time (or just can't do it) to do yard work.   I have bad allergies so I do not want to have to get sick while working. I also am not one for pulling weeds! I hate to pull weeds! But I wouldn't mind mowing an average sized lawn. (no acres)    I will also be willing to set up a binder so the customer can choose if they want the trimmings blown away and put in the trash, and other things like cutting length. Also as for charging I would want a reasonable price and discounts for seniors. And if they let me use their mower i would give them a discount due to gas prices. So help me out and tell me what I should do! Thank you! Oh yeah and I don't want to spend too much money!!

20090202165057AAQNLIj	Home & Garden;Cleaning & Laundry	Feather here, feather there, feather, feather everywhere?	Today, I did my laundry. It was great. I put the down microfiber POS blanket I got from overstock in the washer. All went smoothly, very nice. Smelled apparentally like soft cute little bears, you know like this:     http://graphics.samsclub.com/images/prod...       Snuggles is awesome. you know it. It's not something you can deny.       So when I cheerfully went around putting my microfiber POS blanket in the dryer, I turned it on like a happy cindrella with little blue birds chirping all over the place spinning around my head while I spun around in my apron, with the sun shining so brightly through my window. Everything was clean. It was beautiful, peaceful and happy.      But apparentally I used the wrong detergent.      I got this kind of snuggles:    http://justelite.net/wp-content/uploads/...       Stabbing the crap out of my microfiber blanket. Now there are feathers floating all around my laundry room. Tiny little down feathers just spinning everywhere floating ALL OVER THE FREAKING PLACE.       I am SO angry.       How should I start cleaning up all the feathers when they are still floating everywhere!!??!      PS DONT BUY THIS    http://www.overstock.com/Electronics/Mic...

20090202162015AARu2nv	Home & Garden;Maintenance & Repairs	House shifting/moving- how normal or abnormal is this?	Hello, I live in a 1951 one floor ranch house that sits on the end of an inlet off the Long Island Sound.  I've lived here for 3 years and when I moved in I had crown and baseboard molding installed throughout the house.  Strangely, in my living room and bedroom, both rooms facing the water side, the crown molding is separating. At the corners, and at the middle on a few pieces where it was joined together. In my bedroom it looks like it's separated from the ceiling- in that the paint is cracked all along the top of the molding.    It always happens every winter. In the spring I always end up puttying and recaulking and then it happens again. Is my house moving? is this normal?  What do I need to do to find out IF it IS moving?

I have gotten several estimates and just got another tonight.  THere is one contractor that says my subfloor is bad and will need to be replaced.

This is really all greek to me, but why is it that the other 7 esstimates did not mention that I need a new subfloor. Please help?
