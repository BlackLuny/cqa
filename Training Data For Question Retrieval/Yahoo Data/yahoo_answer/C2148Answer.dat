If you would rather have a photo then you must upload it to Yahoo 360 from your computer.  If it is on the web then download it first. Create a Yahoo 360 account if you don't have one. You can get one at http://360.yahoo.com . Click on the "My Page" tab and then "Edit Personal Photos". You are allowed to put four pictures there by following the instructions. Mark the one you want to use as primary.  3? Now for either a cartoon or a picture save everything and go back to Yahoo Answers.

Answers profile, and then click on the button that says "My 360 profile" in blue letters. It is to the right of your ID. Once you set up the profile, you can click on the button that reads "Edit Personal Photos". That takes you to a page, where you can upload an image you wish to use as your primary photo. After you have added the image, you can set it as your primary. Then, go to your Yahoo! Answers profile, and then click the button that reads "Edit My Info". You will see three boxes down near the bottom toolbar on the page, and the middle one reads "Use my Yahoo! 360 Picture". Check the circle next to it, and then scroll down and save your profile. It will take a short period of time for the picture to process, so be patient. Hope this helped! Good luck!

Or call Yahoo: 1-408-349-1572, explain to a customer service person what happened. If you remember your account details and if your account was "only" hacked, you might get it back incl. your contacts. If however your account was deleted because you maybe violated some rules, you have a problem which is almost impossible to solve. Because when an account is deleted, all info within gets erased and if you don't remember the screen names of your contacts, you can't even look up their profiles.

2uPEty21aa	Garbage in, garbage out.    People who want to annoy and people who want to get points are not necessarily one and the same.    Pointless questions beg for pointless answers.

People who open different accounts on a daily basis in order to ask puerile, often racist and even more often, sexually loaded questions are the ones you should be annoyed about.

7u77AiBjaa	Double-check that you are using the correct Yahoo services and have followed all the instructions below. Some people confuse the Y!Profile (http://profile.yahoo.com ) with Yahoo! 360 (http://360.yahoo.com ). If you've done everything, then likely you just have to wait for a change to be recognized:      Create a 360 space at http://360.yahoo.com . Click "Get Started" button on the far right section of that page. After going through the activation process, you can click on the teeny tiny "Yahoo 360 Home" link on the upper right of that page (or the 360 main page) to get into the 360 space.    Make sure a JPEG formatted photo (with .jpg, .jpeg, .jpe extension) under 5MB is saved to your hard drive.    - Click your "My Page" link at the top  - Click "Edit Profile/Personal Photos" over the empty picture frame  - Click "Browse" and upload photo into an empty field. Then click one "use as primary" radio button on the right before saving (if you've uploaded more than one image).    You can't upload more than 4 profile pictures (this includes an avatar). Make sure that you are following the 360 Personal Photo guidelines here: http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/360/gui... .    Then, come back to Yahoo! Answers.  - Make sure that it is the same Yahoo ID that you used for 360.  - Click the "My Profile" link to the upper right of this Yahoo! Answers page, then click "Edit My Info" in the top left box on the Answers profile page.  - Scroll down to the image section and check the option of showing the 360 picture. Click Preview and then the OK button. Then, WAIT.    NOTE: The image may not show up right away in Y/A, as it sometimes take hours, days, or weeks for the system to catch up. So, in the meantime, you will be without any picture on Y/A (a gray unisex icon) or an old 360 image. Just go through the above process and let your picture stay that way until the system makes your 360 image appear. If you don't want to wait, then just use a Yahoo! Avatar (http://avatars.yahoo.com ) and forget about using the 360 image.    OTHER TIPS:  *** If the 360 space is recently activated, you may want to wait a few days before changing settings, as Y/A may not recognize that you have a 360 space right away.  *** You may want to enable all the communication options on your Y/A profile and/or enable the Simple URL option in your Yahoo! 360 "Basic Info" and "Blog" settings pages. Sometimes that helps make the Y!360 image appear in your Y/A profile for an unknown reason. You still may have to wait for anything to happen though.  *** Although, some people have found limited success in continually trying to re-select the 360 image option in their Y/A profile. I recommend waiting though, as to not inadvertently cause further delay.  *** Some people never see an image show up. You can always post a bug report (or piggyback on other's bug reports) on the issue at the Y/A forum: http://suggestions.yahoo.com/?prop=answe... . This link between Y/A and Y!360 has been buggy for years.

No, you will not be able to get the automated link reverted back, but you can manually add the 360 link to your Y/A profile's "About Me" section:    - Click "My Page" at the top of your 360 space  - Click the drop down menu "Preview as seen by" at the top right of your 360 "My Page".  - Choose PUBLIC as the permission group and click the "Go" button  - Click the "Top Page" link above your personal profile picture section on the left side.  - Select & copy the FULL web address that appears in your web browser's address bar (starting from the http:// part)  - Click "My Profile" to the upper right of this Yahoo! Answers page, then click "Edit My Info" in the top left box on the Answers profile page.  - Paste the address in your Y/A profile's "About Me" section. If you have a Simple URL setup, use that instead. Make sure A SPACE follows the address.  - Click the "Preview" button, then the "OK" button.|`|suPD7c3gaa	No.  The change was planned... not a temporary thing or a mistake.

The e-mail is as following:    Subject: *fans name* has connected to you on Yahoo! Answers    Message:     Hi *your name*,    You are *fans name*'s newest Contact! If you don't know "fans name", *fans name* is probably a fan of your questions and answers and wants to link to you so he/she can find them again. There is no obligation for you to reciprocate, unless you want to. :)     If you'd like, you can add *fans name* as a Contact too. Just follow this link:    *inserts link*    You might like to have a look at *fans name*'s profile:    *inserts link*    You can see all of *fans name*'s Contacts here:    *inserts link*    So, check 'em out!    *Then all the small print*    There is a little check box that you have to click, but it looks like you've convered that bit by looking at your additional details.

eb4a10b7d0c7b16ef422f23a98ba67beaa	You need a total of 250 points to get to Level 2.   You have a total of 122 points, you need another 128 points to get there.    You can vote for undecided questions at Level 1, even your own, but you need to be on Level 2 to rate answers (thumb up /down).    The best way to gain points is to answer and vote to your limit each day, whatever level you are on.    Visit each day - 1 point  Answer to your limit each day - 2 points each answer - 20 questions - 40 points  Hope for some best answers - 10 points each best answer plus 1 point for every thumbs up (maximum 50 points)  Vote to your limit each day - 1 point each vote - 20 votes - 20 points  If you ask a question, -5 points, pick a best answer, you get 3 points back.|`|F0h2iFWsaa	level 2 starts at 250 points - you have 122.    All levels can pick a best answer to questions they ask and can vote for best answer on others' undecided questions.  Once you hit level 2 & get the ability to 'rate', the only difference in the levels is the daily limits on questions, answers, comments, votes, etc.    Levels 2 and up can 'rate' the answers of other Y!A users.  Rating = giving Thumbs Up & Down to express your opinion of other peoples' answers. No points are involved (unless a best answer has TUs, then they get 1 point for each TU up to 50) in rating, and thumbs do not determine the Best Answer selection.    Hints:     answer your limit of questions each day (2 points each)  get an answer selected as best answer (10 points each)  pick a best answer for your question (3 points)  vote your limit of unresolved questions each day (1 point each)  you also get a point a day for signing in    each question costs 5 points, so ask sparingly    :o)     http://answers.yahoo.c om/info/scoring_system;_ylt=Aplad92Pq_Fl...|`|suPD7c3gaa	You'll need a TOTAL of 250 points to get to Level 2, so answer lots, and ask less on the earlier levels. Give quality answers to real questions to get Best Answer points (10). Vote undecided questions and answer your daily limit when you can (1 pt ea.). And ask few questions (-5), but when you do ask, be sure to choose a Best Answer, as you get 3 points back for that. Click on the link below (or your points or level number next to your avatar).

After 4 hours have elapsed, just go to your question, then to the answer you want to choose, and click on that button, and follow the steps. If you haven't gotten the answer you need, you can give it a few more days just in case you get more answers, and one that might be better.|`|c61c81042d80fff5afc27bed499a5b50aa	well for one stop asking questions and start answering|`|9KUrUIzIaa	answer lots of questions.|`|qXlBsRLgaa	get 250 points

sK3qibRwaa	That's not your 360 space. Double-check that you are using the correct Yahoo services and have followed all the instructions below. Some people confuse the Y!Profile (<a href="http://profile.yahoo.com">http://profile.yahoo.com</a> ) with Yahoo! 360 (<a href="http://360.yahoo.com">http://360.yahoo.com</a> ). If you've done everything, then likely you just have to wait for a change to be recognized and we shouldn't see your Yahoo! Avatar on Y!Answers (as we do right now):<br>  <br>  <br>  Create a 360 space at <a href="http://360.yahoo.com">http://360.yahoo.com</a> . Click "Get Started" button on the far right section of that page. After going through the activation process, you can click on the teeny tiny "Yahoo 360 Home" link on the upper right of that page (or the 360 main page) to get into the 360 space.<br>  <br>  Make sure a JPEG formatted photo (with .jpg, .jpeg, .jpe extension) under 5MB is saved to your hard drive.<br>  <br>  - Click your "My Page" link at the top<br>  - Click "Edit Profile/Personal Photos" over the empty picture frame<br>  - Click "Browse" and upload photo into an empty field. Then click one "use as primary" radio button on the right before saving (if you've uploaded more than one image).<br>  <br>  You can't upload more than 4 profile pictures (this includes an avatar). Make sure that you are following the 360 Personal Photo guidelines here: <a href="http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/360/gui...">http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/360/gui...</a> .<br>  <br>  Then, come back to Yahoo! Answers.<br>  - Make sure that it is the same Yahoo ID that you used for 360.<br>  - Click the "My Profile" link to the upper right of this Yahoo! Answers page, then click "Edit My Info" in the top left box on the Answers profile page.<br>  - Scroll down to the image section and check the option of showing the 360 picture. Click Preview and then the OK button. Then, WAIT.<br>  <br>  NOTE: The image may not show up right away in Y/A, as it sometimes takes minutes, hours, days, or weeks for the system to catch up. So, in the meantime, you will be without any picture on Y/A (a gray unisex icon) or an old 360 image. Just go through the above process and let your picture stay that way until the system makes your 360 image appear. If you don't want to wait, then just use a Yahoo! Avatar (<a href="http://avatars.yahoo.com">http://avatars.yahoo.com</a> ) and forget about using the 360 image.<br>  <br>  OTHER TIPS: <br>  *** If the 360 space is recently activated, you may want to wait a few days before changing settings, as Y/A may not recognize that you have a 360 space right away.<br>  *** You may want to enable all the communication options on your Y/A profile and/or enable the Simple URL option in your Yahoo! 360 "Basic Info" and "Blog" settings pages. Sometimes that helps make the Y!360 image appear in your Y/A profile for an unknown reason.

AQsiugSpaa	Hi Lisa,<br>  <br>  This question has been asked a few times as the "Best of Answers" and the 10 Top Answerers in categories have remained unchanged for what seems like an eternity. <br>  <br>  Apparently Yahoo is making changes to the program, and from what I have gathered has not updated these areas for some reason. It is expected that YA will be given a face lift in the near future, so I do hope that when that happens they will update all of these features.<br>  <br>  So I am assuming that YA will announce how they get decide which questions get on that list when the "upgrade" happens.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.. .it is indeed frustrating for sure.<br>  <br>  Troublesniffer<br>  Waiting::::::: waiting:::::: Waiting::::::

kJTzXWoPaa	There should be a little box in the left hand corner saying "don't show again", which means that now you understand you have this particular option and there's no need to keep showing you that message.<br>  <br>  Fill the box and you'll never see that message again. Wait a minute! There IS an option you may have checked, that option would be something like "remind me before deleting". Do you remember enabling an option like that? <br>  <br>  If not, you're good with the suggestion I gave you.
jKfV6DoOaa	Yes, you can block any contact that you want but in order to block a contact you need to delete that contact from your contact list first. <br>  You can not block a contact that is still in your contact list. <br>  <br>  Why don't you just hide for a while instead. You can set your Yahoo!ID to invisible just for that contact that you don't want to be contacted from.<br>  That way that contact can't see when you are online but you can see when that contact is online. That contact can still send you IM's then though but they will not know whether you blocked them or not or whether you received their IM or not. Even if you block that contact they can still send you IM's but then you just will not receive them and they don't know if you blocked them anyway because Yahoo! doesn't tell them that their were blocked by you anyway. <br>  <br>  Here is how you set yourself to invisible for that one particular contact. Point with your mouse curser on that contact in your contact list and then a little window opens up...there click on the very bottom on where it says " You appear online to this contact" then another little menu opens up and there click then on "Appear permanently offline to ...(here it says the contacts name)". Once you have done that your contact's user name will appear in Italic. If you wish to be seen by that contact some time later then you can reverse it again the same way as I described to you above. <br>  <br>  Here is how you block a person. First you have to delete that contact from your contact list. Point on that contact with your curser and right click on it and then choose "Delete". Once deleted you can block that contact by clicking on "Messenger" on the top left, go then to "Preferences" then to "Ignore List", there click on "Add" and in the little window that opens up type in the user name of your contact that you wish to block.<br>  Then click on "Ignore" then you contact will appear on the Ignore List and then click on "Apply" and then "Ok". <br>  From then on that contact is blocked but you can always remove that contact from your Ignore List again. <br>  <br>  I hope my answer helped you out. :o)|`|SttRtZ1Kaa	You could always been a option to "block" anybody.<br>  If you see their name.<br>  Just go their question, then to their profile, then block and accept.

zDQIPFH2aa	If you want serious answers, there are several ways to improve the chances.    1. Write very detailed, complete sentence, correctly spelled questions. They are much more likely to be picked.    2. Ask during the high user times. For the USA 6-10pm New York time.    3. Don't give a lot of extra not needed data and don't write speeches in the added details. That turns people off.    4. If you are looking at questions on personal issues, this is probably not the site to get serious answers. Make the questions less about you and more about people in general.|`|fr180hSmaa	There is no best way but there are a combination of ways  1. Ask in a more popular category like polls and surveys  2. Answer at reasonable time no one is here at 3 in the morning  3. Ask a interesting question more people tend to answer    Note: more answers does not mean there are better answers|`|ickyq53aaa	First of all check your spelling.  Since you misspelled response, a lot of people think you are a moron, and don't want to waste their time on you.  Y/A does a spell check, you should use it.  Second, try to put your question in the right category.  Third, be as concise as possible.  The more info we have, the easier it is to answer your question.|`|AA10487943	The best way to have your response voted the best is simply by having the best answer.
NHlbVaZ2aa	Yes, just use a messenger that doesn't care where you use your e-mail. You can both get Windows Live Messenger accounts (free) and use your existing e-mail addresses on it.    There are other ones as well, such as Yahoo or ICQ. Just find one you both like, sign up, and add the other person to your friends list, and you're ready to go.|`|I9NNRW8Aaa	I would Use The following Url Source to have the best Sound Video Chatting With This It Does Not Matter who has What,   Look below in Sources
znLzOCHlaa	Why?|`|ElBiYV7Waa	Um... okay? If you're using Yahoo! Mail, click on "Mail" on the Yahoo! Homepage. Then, it will take you to your e-mail inbox.
f202428f23f47abf8c99a259c26fc13eaa	You  can't with Yahoo.    Some other mail systems allow you to leave the TO line blank--if you enter all recipients on BCC--and the TO line will show Undisclosed-Recipients.    However, Yahoo requires at least one valid address on the TO line (and that's what shows).  Common practice, therefore, is to put your own address on TO and everyone else on BCC. Their addresses are hidden and your's is the only one showing.|`|ElBiYV7Waa	The "To" field cannot show "undisclosed recipients". To do this, enter the contacts in the "BCC" field (blind carbon copy.) Then, the recipient can't see the email addresses you put in the "BCC" field. However, they can still see the addresses in the "To" field.
AA11307940	Send a email to the address and see if it comes back to you as undeliverable. That would mean it is not an open active account or you typed the address wrong. If you get no response then maybe you were blocked, it would be deleted upon arrival at the inbox and you would not receive a notice of this. Or maybe they just don't want to respond. Many choices here.|`|XZTf8Eahaa	She must have blocked you mate. and she will do more than that if shes finds out you put her email on yahoo answers for everyone to see. good look.|`|BNTDuIGxaa	Maybe she's just not that into you.
b165361aa3bdfd3dd4401459ad6b7836aa	Because they want your money.  Call again and ask to speak to a manager.  If they still don't help you call your credit card company and tell them they are refusing to help you.  They will either stop the charge and/or open an investigation and I guarantee you that Yahoo does not want to hear from them.

suPD7c3gaa	Yes, you can use a picture of yourself.  Unlike what another answerer states, whether you use the Yahoo! (cartoon) avatar, or create an avatar using an image of your choosing, it's still an avatar.  Here's how you use your choice of image file:    First make sure you have the photo/image file that you want to use as your avatar on your computer. (IMPORTANT!  DO NOT us an image that's tiny/avatar sized to start with.  You must use 'normal' size image files.)  Then you need to put the image you'd like to use as your avatar on your 360 page. You may already have one. If you do, you would be able to access it from your profile. Just click on your avatar (or "My Profile" on the upper right). The 360 option will be on the upper right. If not, you'd need to create one.    http://360.yahoo.com/    To be sure your image meets proper specifications:    http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/360/gui...    To add a photo to 360: Go to your 360 page. Click on "My Page" that's near the top. You'll see your photos (or where they would be if you don't already have photos there) and the option to "Edit Personal Photos". Click on that, then you will see where you can add photos. Click on "Choose File" to find the image on your computer. Once you add the image, click on "Save". That'll bring you back to the group of images. If you want to set the new image as primary to use here, click on "Edit Personal Photos" again. Click where it says "Set as Primary", then click "Save.    Then to use your 360 image here for your avatar, go to your profile (Click on your avatar or click "My Profile" on the upper right of the page), the click on "Edit my info". Scroll down to where you choose what image you want to use and choose the 360 one. Then click on "preview" and "OK".    Keep in mind that sometimes, after following all the steps, the 360 image can appear right away, or can take 2-3 days... but it will eventually appear.|`|ElBiYV7Waa	I don't want to be the "bear of bad news", but, I don't recall that you can put up a picture of yourself. I think you need to have an Avatar.    BUT!!    Here's something you could try:    Create a Yahoo! 360 account. Then, I think you can put up a picture of yourself. Then, in Yahoo! Answers, you can choose whether your picture is your 360 picture or your Avatar.    I hope I'm right, and I hope this helps you!
