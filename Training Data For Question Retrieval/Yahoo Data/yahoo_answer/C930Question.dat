Ok, Me, my boyfriend and a friend got together last year, and decided to rent an apartment together....so we did. everythings been ok (rent/bills wise) until about august, when my roommates check bounced... no biggie, things happen. a $397 check turned unto $600 after all kinds of fees.... so since he didnt have the money, my boyfriend had to go to the bank and get a money order -- roommate didnt even bother asking how it went or anything... anyways soo basically boyfriend bailed him out, and roommate eventually paid him back. here we are, 2 months later.. and it has happened again!!!! Roommate reassured us that if he thought that there was going to be any problems, he'd let us know, so we could make other arrangements. so.. he didnt... now im extremely angry. The apt management has told us that its ruining not only our rommates credit, but its ruining our renters credit as well... not sure how true that is, but my boyfriend mentioned that maybe we should break the lease... (i've broken a lease before, and lets just say it didnt go well at all.so i know that its awful to break the lease. i was wondering if any of you knew if we could just get the roommate to move out, we all are signed on the lease, so i dont relaly think we can do that.. i dont want to have to move out of my wonderful apartment after he has gone and screwed everything up. and who knows how many more times this will happen by the end of June '09, (when our lease is up) thanks in advance!

We have no problems with making our payments, but we would really like to move into a house, especially at the current prices. The problem is our condos are selling about $75k less than what we still owe. Is there any ethical and legal ways to get out of our current condo and into a home? I know when someone is "upside down" in a car payment, the dealership will take the trade in any how and add it to the principle of the new car. Does real estate have any system like this?

Vorrei sfruttare i prossimi giorni di lavoro (tranquilli) per organizzarmi meglio. Faccio l'impiegata e sono piuttosto indipendente nelle mie mansioni.

Ho pensato di mettermi sulla scrivania le seguenti "bacinelle":   - In ingresso (tutte le cose che arrivano per me e che devo vagliare/leggere/fare)   - Da fare   - in attesa (di risposte altrui, di una data, ecc.)   - da archiviare (nelle giornate di grande impegno non c'√® magari il tempo di riporre tutto al suo posto... si pianta l√¨ e il mattino dopo, appena arrivata, lo metto a posto)      In teoria dovrei guardare nella vaschetta "da fare" per tutto quello che ho in sospeso, e tenere d'occhio "in attesa" per le cose per le quali devo sollecitare risposte da altri...   Pensate possa funzionare?       Avete anche voi un vostro metodo? come ci siete arrivati?

I was asking for a lot less than the equity I have for my home available.  I was denied because the bank said my DTI was 65% and they only allow up to a 50% DTI.  But when I got my credit report and added up all my monthly payments reported, my DTI using only my salary is 53.5%.  If I include my child support, which I did inform the bank I receive, my DTI is 49.6%.  I don't understand where the bank got the 65% DTI.  I did also inform the bank I was going to consolidate my debt.  If I had received the loan, with my new payment and all the rest gone, my DTI would then be 44.3% or 41.2% respectively.  If I call the bank and ask for a detailed explanation on how they came up with their calculations, will they give it to me?  Or do they not have to?  Thanks for all your help....

I'm applying for jobs abroad but I'm afraid to ask for an interview because my phone isn't reliable enough to have a phone interview. I don't have a landline and when I speak to people on my mobile phone it is hard to hear them properly because the connection is a bit...grumbly?  I'm not exactly sure how to approach this. I'm moving to Australia next month (already have a work permit) and I'd like to secure employment before I get there or very soon after I arrive.      My internet connection is also crap so Skype is out of the question.       Thoughts?

There was also a lot of younger people working there...But this time, I will be interviewd by the owner...      So what can I say to make me look good??? Some pointers?? What should I NOT say???

How do you survive at work when your manager is self-absorbed, all her stories have to be heard, she won't shut up about it. She's mean and rude and never minds her own business. When people are talking, she always ask what? huh?    Like she's jealous she's not included in the conversation or something.   She also think she's perfect, when others make mistake, it's a big deal, but when it's her mistake, she just laughs about it.       Wish it was easy to find another job.

20090309205456AAyOqJy	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment;Law & Legal	Is a law career for me?	Ever since I took criminal and civil law classes in high school, I knew instantly that I am interested in law.  I didn't think about law school back then, I just knew that I want to know more about law and I always question if something is legal or not.        Then in college, I majored in political science and took as many law related classes as I can.  I found reading court cases to be difficult but interesting; as I reached my Junior year, I was contemplating about going to law school.      As a matter of fact, law school scares the **** out of me.  I heard that they use the Socrates teaching method.  It'll be hard for me because I'm so used to learning by memorizing information.  And I heard that you have to read and write write excessively and these are certainly not my strong points.      I have more of a creative mind and love music and art.      I can't think of myself becoming a full time teacher/professor or a musician or an artist because ....      well I guess because of low salaries.        I am competitive if I know I have the ability to succeed (never in science or math though) and I am very driven by high salary.      Is law school for me if I really interested in law?  What are the requirements  to succeed in law school?

I was going to go bankrupt until recently, my Discover card of $15,000 agreed on a settlement of $4,500. I took them up on that offer. Well, today I got a call from an attorney (not mine) who claims that I had a CitiBank card back in 2005-2006 that I stopped payments on and now they are going to send a deputy to my house within the next 24hours to summons me to court! He said that I was already found guilty, that they have come to my house twice this week (no one ever came!), and that I will owe over $5,000.. and that I won't be appointed an attorney or lawyer even though I can't pay!! Is this guy a creditor who is bluffing to scare me?!? Or is he the real deal and I really do have a delinquent card somehow? My question is, I have a Sears credit card (that is a CitiBank card) and I've had it for 8 years now and I'm still current on my payments and in good standing with them. Wouldn't CitiBank have said something to me about my Sears card if they were having trouble with me for 3 years?!?! And why is this the first time I've heard of this "card" from 2005? I'm Really nervous, Really scared, and feeling Really sick right now. What do you think?!?!??

My parents technically have the right to claim me as a dependent on their taxes because I lived with them from January to August.      They are going to get the Hope Credit for their taxes which totals up to $3,600 because I go to school in a Midwest Disaster Area.      I would be receiving more than $1,000 more if I was able to claim as an independent because I worked 60 hours a week last summer and 20 hours a week during school year and made $13,000 total.

Ill try to make this as brief as possible. i have a business plan that i have to do starting with creating a new product. My product is a program that contains Information such as business theories, concepts and so on and behaviours of different customers. the way this works is you use the program for a specific product that you want to create. You added into the computer and it gives you different concepts in which you can start to develop it and also gives you an of what your target market can be by giving you possible reactions form the different behaviours that are in the program. It has other factors such as there are three levels to the program one being you pick a product from a verity that's given to you and u match the concept you use and the customers that you target and it gives you an overview of how successful it will be. second level is a bit more complicated and involves creating your own product while third level it goes as high as creating a whole company with how many employees you will need and also financial factors and so on.      Could you please tell me what are your thoughts about this particular invention. this is only an overview and im sorry its so long but your help will be much appreciated       Thank you for your time

Colleges teach computer science, Literature, Calculus,  Science, Chemistry and things like that.      Those fancy kind of subjects can help people who get fancy jobs in large companies progrmaming, doing scientific work, etc etc..    But i just want to do Jobs that exist in my small town.      like: Receptionist, Administrative assitant, Customer Service,    Consultant, Office Assitant, etc      In other words, if you have knowdlege, it really doesn't matter if there are no JObs of that kind,, OR 2) If you're not a talkative person and you don't have social skills.      So is there any place that can teach you the skills needed for Jobs that Exist in the real world??      Universities, and colleges may  teach Software like Photoshop and Graphics stuff or whatever.. But just knowing software doesn't get you a job. You need to know how to talk in order to advertise your art or whatever. that may be easy for natural born outgoing people but not for shy introverts.      That's why only outgoing people succeed with College skills. Because they already have no problems with dealing with people and talking. So they just need software skils and they'd be ready.      OK The other thing i want to say is There is NO Entry level jobs right now. AT ALL. And most companies that offer jobs want people with experience, so Is there any place that teaches experience?      Anyways, to sum it up:   Where to get skills for jobs that exist??? We don't need skills for Jobs that don't exist .      I'm 29 male

20090309214431AAOc5yg	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment;Law & Legal	Is it legal for my manager to cut my hours below insurance qualifications?	I've been working full-time with a company for nearly a year now. I qualified for insurance in August and enrolled. In the past three months, I've developed a heart issue that I've had to see specialists and wear a monitor for. I've kept my managers completely in the loop with what's going on and provided them with documentation in the form of doctors' notes each time I've had to miss work.      Two weeks after I started having to wear a heart monitor, my managers cut my hours by a whole day-- they didn't give me any reason why, aside from "things just not being busy." This puts me below the 35-hours-a-week eligibility clause for my insurance. So despite the fact that I've paid out over $1000 to the insurance company, I'm going to lose my insurance, right when I need it the most.      Is this legal? It certainly seems amoral, but I'm not sure whether this is something I can threaten legal action over.

20090309214908AAyO6TU	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	Buying a forclosed home at 18?	I am 18 years old and am interested in buying a forclosed home.  Both of my parents have been doing the "fix and flip" methods there entire lives.  They usually buy forclosed homes, fix them, and re-sell them for alot more.  The off campus housing at the school i'm attending in Denver is 700$ a month.  I have a friend who is 24 and is paying $490 in her mortage per month because she bought a forclosed home out of college.  The problem is, I got my first credit card two months ago and don't have any credit built up.  I feel it is crazy for me to be paying "rent" at $700 a month, when I could own a home for less than that.  Any suggestions?  Is it even possible to do this or will I have to wait until I build some more credit?  Any of you real estate junkie out there, or college kids who have done something similar, help me out!   Thanks!   - Mallory

The pruchase price would be $70,000  and I will put 5% down. Total monthly payment (incl taxes) will be about $850 and I will charge $1350.month total rent (it is 2 family.) The question is this- yes I will flow (less random expenses) $500/month, but say I only own the house for 5 years and it remains at the same value-  I am making $500/month but aren't I still losing out by paying so much interest and not really paying off much principle in that time? I know month to month I will make income off of it, what I am really concerned about is is it a sound 8-10 year investment? I'm not concerned with all the associated issues of being a lanlord, etc, just the finanical implications of my decision. Any thoughts?  Thanks

20090309223127AAkAO4y	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	Will my boyfriend get in trouble in my roommate calls the cops on him?	I've been living with my current roommate for about 8 months now and a couple months ago we've started to have issues with each other. I just started dating someone for about a little over a month. He visits my apartment from time to time, and does sleep over. We normally keep to my room or sometimes go out on the patio to smoke. My roommate didn't seem to have any issues with it until last week when my boyfriend over heard her calling the leasing office. Apparently she was asking if she could call the cops on him. She then proceeded to write me a note saying that if my boyfriend continues to stay over then the leasing office would give me some kind of legal paperwork? According to the lease which states no guest can stay over more than 7 days in a row or 14 days in a month, we haven't done anything wrong. It's pretty much impossible to stay at his house because of the distance. My lease isn't up until July, though I've been contemplating breaking it early because living with this crazy woman is driving me insane. Advice?
