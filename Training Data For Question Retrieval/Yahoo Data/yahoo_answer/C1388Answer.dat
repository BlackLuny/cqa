SIqFa1mzaa	It seems like these people do like you, but they notice you are very shy/reserved and this is their way of including you.  This is one explanation.  It's good that some people try to help you and give you advice even if it may make you feel bad sometimes.|`|RHOiO24Gaa	I'm afraid you allowed people to speak down to you. You probably did this because you may be a little socially immature.Whatever the reason they are doing it because they are use to doing it now and they don't have the social skills themselves to know they are insulting you. I am not sure how to advise you but I suppose you could start by correcting as many people as you can and also make sure you act very mature and no goofing around.|`|2s9IZU7xaa	ok so thats pretty normal its just a nick name and your friends are just joking around so you should really relax if you dont like it tell them to stop|`|qdHPvcFeaa	It's definitely not because they don't like you. It's just them attempting to get a rise out of your or to boost your ego.
9HoXpsP6aa	I feel your pain, I was the 'smelly girl'.  Although it wasn't my whole body, I've always needed deodorant (since first grade!-I'm not kidding) and have to wash my feet multiple times a day.  If you get a hot doctor, just deal with it.  She's probably married and won't be trying to hit on you, or vice versa.  She's a woman who went to school so she can help people.  Maybe you have an infection of your skin or something.  Have you tried soaking in the tub with tea?  Tea is a natural remedy I use on my feet sometimes, it is very good odor reducer.|`|Yh4YWdR1aa	I'm not sure if you are making this stuff up , but if its' for real you might see your  school guidance counselor and see if he or she can give you advice on what to do. This all sounds disturbing to me.|`|5UbC5hP9aa	Call the doctor yourself.|`|iziyh97zaa	Don't worry so much. Its so natural to smell bad when your a teenager and im sure its going to go away eventually. Also i suggest that you take a lot of showers. You could also where like colone (but not to much cuz that smells horible:)). If its your underarms that smell so much keep them seperated from your body so then it will sweat less.|`|vK5A9ujzaa	god damn. dont worry about it, go to the doctor and bathe twice a day, and always wear clean clothes.|`|HCbOtZRKaa	Your fine. It happens to everyone. It's something called puberty. I used to have the same thing happen to me, but it goes away with time. Unfortunately nobody talks about it because it is embarrassing. I would try to use some deodorant under the arms, and to stop worrying. If you worry you sweat more, so just calm down, make sure you shower and watch everything really good and use deodorant. You will be fine. Take it from me, life gets easier in a sense when you grow up, but enjoy the time you have while your young.|`|yhI1lkh1aa	ok calm down. You should try to get another doctors appointment and when you schedule it, request a male doctor. They are the best people to help you with this problem. You should tell your mother how much this is upsetting you and let her know it is not just something minor. In regards to your "Additional Details" - please don't do anything to hurt yourself or others. There is help out there and someone will be able to help you with this problem. just hang in there.. - You may also see a school psychologist that may be able to help you with this as well, or refer you to someone who can.|`|GTja6ouWaa	Who put a fish in your pants?

For some reason, I listened to "Hey There Delilah" last night and that's pretty sad too. Oh and "You're Beautiful" by James Blunt is pretty depressing. The songs don't make me cry though.

In life, people learn through their mistakes, and hopefully make them better people into the future. Life is all about experience.|`|G4pmbc0Qaa	You're only as screwed up as you give yourself credit for. If you want to be a victim and whine about how life dealt you a raw hand, you can.

c6eae266bb501e0a315d4b3e606f9c99aa	I would want my patient to be honest about whatever was going on.  Including telling me why they are reluctant to come and see me when they have an injury.  Keep in mind that most places, it is the law that a therapist has to contact DSS if they feel there may be abuse going on.  But ultimately, it is your choice whether you see her or not.|`|Yh4YWdR1aa	If there really is a problems you need to let DSS help you. There must be something wrong if they keep calling and this has been going on for awhile. Just answer the phone and see what they want.
1wIek546aa	who cares?<br>  <br>  he's treating you like crap. why would you want to encourage that kind of behavior? you need to send the message that in order to get YOUR attention, you need to be treated with kindness and consideration.|`|1d627596e14caafeacfad98d799d9a7caa	Try re-posting your question in Singles and Dating.

Now please go back to the Jonas Brother over in singles and dating and never darken the doorstep of Gender and Women Studies again. We have extremely serious issues to solve over here.|`|NGPgWFztaa	I doubt it very much. He seems the kind of man you should avoid. Eventually, he will figure out that treating folk this way is not acceptable - and will either live a lonely existence, or he will change his ways accordingly.<br>  <br>  I had a g/f like that. We got on fine but once we entered a relationship, she would often smack for little or no reason. I was able to handle it for a while, but then she started doing it in front of family members - that was taking it too far even for my laid back attitude.|`|NNHdkLDWaa	Yes he does. Unfortunately a lot of guys have been around girls and women a lot, so they copy their flirting from them. That sounds the way a girl would flirt to a guy o.O .|`|AA10909300	I agree with her. that's not very nice. It could mean that he likes you, but he's just having a little trouble with some self-control.
a57a774f9f8c04193f9a0e52e2fbdde1aa	Okay, you have to be at least 50% awake to remember a dream, so you must usually dream in the REM stage. You probably remembered this one because you were awake, and then you've been able to remember it because you were confused as to why you remembered it, and then it stuck out in your thoughts.
oVeGMNsLaa	I definitely think it's better to give truthful answers.  That said, there are some people who do not understand the difference between being rudely honest and being tactful and explaining these uncomfortable truths.  And, moreover, sometimes I think we bring out own prejudices to Y!A, whether it's in what we think is the truth, or in why we think someone's giving answers thumbs up or down.|`|f6f40965eb7d5df6aa94440ec71e32dcaa	I've been on Yahoo Answers for over two years, and I always give the truth.  Thumbs Down don't mean anything to me, as they don't affect my points at all.  I'd rather get 30 thumbs down for speaking the truth than to blindly agree with the original poster.|`|NYU37jfGaa	I see no point at all in answering questions unless you are going to say what you really think.  What on earth does it matter whether you get thumbs up, best answer or whatever?  It's not like you get paid for it or anything.|`|S2vI4VEXaa	But sometimes the truth is too painful to hear, er..read, and those answers get hit hardest with thumbs downs.<br>  Answer honestly, if you get thumbs downs, so be it.|`|3ISGQ4Csaa	I was going to ask this question, but you beat me to it:(. I answer the questions giving my opinion. I realized that even though other answerers might give you a thumbs down, it is the asker who ultimately decides which answer they liked, regardless of the thumbs. I think that it helps when i really tell them my opinion, and not a lie. They didn't come here for lies, they wanted honest opinions.|`|1HfLkTrdaa	I say it's best to speak your truth.  If they can't handle it, then oh well.  If they get really nasty about, then give it to 'em with both barrells lol  yeah, they'll probably report ya, but again oh well...being reported isn't the end of the world, is it?|`|QRPvIB8Yaa	You're better off giving a smart answer which sticks to your convictions but isnt baldly offensive and sounds reasonable.|`|Olz3goEaaa	What good are the points actually for?<br>  <br>  Say whatever you want. You get points for each question no matter what other people think. The chances of getting best answer are slim so who gives a sh!t?|`|aNIiGpzeaa	better to tell the truth than give a lie|`|521978f4254c4b8f2b7244300239e951aa	There's no such thing as an answer that everyone will like, so might as well tell the truth.  Obviously, it's more likely you'll get picked for best answer if it agrees with the opinion of the asker (because most of the time, they don't ask a question, they just rant and answer their own question). Let's face it, most people who ask ridiculous questions on here aren't looking for a truthful answer, they're looking for someone to agree with their opinion.<br>  <br>  I come to this website because I enjoy giving honest answers, and if my thoughts aren't popular by other people, then oh well.  I won't lose sleep over it.|`|AKvLiwB6aa	i cud care less bout the points...   like wat gud r they for anything anyways???<br>  <br>  i always tell the truth an speak my mind...  an i guess thats y i got so many enemies here...  both the misogamists an feminists on here hate me an always give me thumbs down on all my answers...   but the way i see it... all the thumbs down r a sign i can see thru the bs that fools evry1 else...   it means im rite an the others r all wrong...  but they cant see there wrong...|`|z60J0Z9Daa	Naa gave up giving good answers a long time ago, got tired of explaining the basics...now it's all BS and sarcasm.|`|22GbdmXhaa	You know what, I say say whatever the hell you want. Some folks care mostly about getting points and give kiss-@ss answers, some give answers they believe to be correct. I wish people would just give their honest opinion, but honestly I don't really care.|`|AA10909300	To be honest, i don't think it really matters, because alot of people are just asking for advice anyhow.|`|1wIek546aa	i speak my opinion no matter what. i get a happy little thrill when someone blocks me, because it means that i got so far under their skin that instead of even TRYING to counter me, they went the cowardly route and blocked me instead. <br>  <br>  sometimes, a question will get two of the exact same worded answers and one will get a lot of TU's and one will get a ton of TD's. who knows? it's utterly random.<br>  <br>  plus, there is no pleasing the masses here. we all are so different, there's no telling what stance the crowd will like best.|`|ZYp1AEspaa	I go for truth and fun. The points get you... more points! wheee...<br>  <br>  There's no real way to know why exactly someone thumbs you up or down, since it's a very blunt instrument. Do they like your style but hate your content? Do they only agree with part of what you say? Are they having a bad hair day? Did you use a word that reminds them of their ex?<br>  <br>  Who knows. All you can do is call it as you see it and not take it too seriously. When I see a really egregious and vicious attack I do try to get some balance in there, but mostly it's just about ignoring the ugly, bad & useless and participating where it's rewarding.|`|0d183ab8af4fe4c2164d74294bd981adaa	I will continue to give my actual opinion regardless of how many sore losers and whiners want to rate me down as a result of it.|`|vEj7xoBraa	it's best to go with the truth no matter how much it hurts.

Different people have different levels of comfort around people or large groups. Don't worry about this. It just depends on how you deal with this and if it controls your life.|`|ANsznbWsaa	My husband has that problem. He hates being around crowds at the store and stuff. <br>  It's not normal but it's not something to be too concerned about as long as it doesn't interrupt your life too drastically.|`|Zu7GJeU4aa	I can't go in public alone I am too anxious, I'm going to see a counsellor|`|EvgfhUCPaa	what are you anxious for and yeah thats kinda wierd|`|VquZAwfHaa	Self-awareness is normal, as is a small amount of anxiety, but too much and you may have a problem.|`|JhoryPQEaa	Sounds like you're suffering from some form of social phobia. This isn't unusual but can lead to more serious problems when you're older if it's not treated sooner rather than later.

c6eae266bb501e0a315d4b3e606f9c99aa	One of the symptoms of Dissociative Identity Disorder (the modern term for Multiple Personality Disorder) is having "missing" periods of time, sometimes called a blackout.  It is thought that during these times, an alternate personality is in control and hence, the primary personality is unaware of what has transpired.  The other common cause for blackouts is alcohol abuse.  If you have a period you can't account for after drinking excessively, it is probably not another personality taking over.  It is not a good thing in either case.
S2vI4VEXaa	Why would it be irresponsible to want to raise your own children?<br>  As for the what if's..life is full of them. They shouldn't dictate how you live your life.<br>  <br>  I like your avatar, but you can change it if you wish.|`|NYU37jfGaa	Well, if she isn't going to raise them, someone else will have to.  And that can be expensive.  She's going to have to pay someone else to look after them while she works.  Is that going to be econimically viable?<br>  <br>  And doesn't her husband have life insurance?  If not then he should do.  If my husband died I would be no worse off than i am now.<br>  <br>  And even if he doesn't have life insurance and dies, can't she go back to work if she has to?  My sister didn't work for 20 years, but she managed to get a job after she left her husband.  It can be done.<br>  <br>  As for your avatar, it just looks like most other people's to me, that is you look like a 12-year-old girl with eyes the size of tennis balls.  Whether that is how you look in reality I could not say.|`|uXqDYPNVaa	Not necessarily. For the first year at least, it would be best for one parent to stay home. (Current mat-leave policies ought to be revised to make this more realistic.) After that, a good day care or babysitter (preferably a close relative) will do.<br>  <br>  For your avatar, maybe you ought to lose the hat and put on something more summery.|`|1d627596e14caafeacfad98d799d9a7caa	Julie...you need a more revealing avatar. The face is nice, but I'm really just interested in what is below it. ;-)<br>  <br>  No it's not irresponsible, it is very responsible. Gotta put those kids first. I mean..why even have kids if you're worried about the father dying. He might, you gotta know that going in. And if he does, I guess you'll have to figure out a money solution. Maybe you'll have to go back to work. <br>  <br>  But I wouldn't make important life decisions based on the worst case scenario.|`|f6f40965eb7d5df6aa94440ec71e32dcaa	At risk of getting several thumbs down, I'd say it is risky, unless her husband's financial affairs are in order and he makes a considerable amount of money.

If you find that not working fails to financially support the children and their needs (medically, educationally, and morally) then you need to go back to work.  Otherwise, if your finances remain stable and the children get what they need in life, then you are as responsible as a working mother.|`|qgL98Wv2aa	yes it is unless the woman has put a GREAT DEAL of money aside before even thinking of having kids to help with the long term household expense......and it the father of the children dies she BETTER make sure that she is also educated also before having the kids to make sure that she can financial take of her children without having to rely on insurance SSI because there is no guarantee that all of that will be there or last........if a man chooses to do the same will it be ok or will society look down on him for doing so......|`|HvtTKS4zaa	Have you ever considered that there are two possibilities to solve the problem ?<br>  Either you quit the job to raise the children, or he does, which would mean you keep the job while he will stay at home.<br>  Being your husband I would seriously consider this last solution. It only depends on whether you would be able to meet the family′s needs (alone!) or not. A confident woman may well be proud of it.|`|vGWD8Zncaa	What's most telling about this is you said the *WOMAN* quit *HER* job!<br>  <br>  What about the man quitting his job and staying home, hmm?  Why is our society SO one-sided and programmed that it's always assumed the woman should quit and the man work?<br>  <br>  Sure, men often get paid better but this is not the case.  I've seen too many women leave interesting and passionate careers and let their doofus blue-collar husbands keep working.|`|ZqHqKDqEaa	No I don't think it's irresponsible, but I think before the woman decides to quit she should first discuss it with her husband to make sure that he can carry the load. <br>  <br>  If her husband died, she would receive SSI for the children.|`|fDGPbwdsaa	It all depends on many, many factors. <br>  <br>  As for your avatar, I rather like it - I take a print-out of it to bed with me most nights....|`|aNIiGpzeaa	no, its not irresponsible at all|`|tYTfT5Hjaa	no|`|vWZoAPacaa	shes probably a full grown woman so i think shes capable of making her own decisions, if she wanst to stay at home, i respect her choice.

LLeQyWGcaa	prioritize. I believe family should always come first and foremost, but there will be times when other issues will take priority. one has to try to keep his family as happy as ever and that includes you, as well as working hard to provide for them. there is no outline for life, parenting, working, walking a straight line. do the best you can, don't be afraid to ask for help along the way and you will be just fine.|`|rGjUyzpoaa	Everything in life must have balance.

Consequently, most of us would resent being forced to assimilate to another culture.<br>  <br>  However, if we chose to adapt because of disappointments in our current culture or even curiosity of the new, them most of us would welcome the change.  One note of caution though... To be acceptable to the individual, all of the current culture itself must undergo the change.

6GmtcZteaa	Love for her style or her personality. Perhaps seeing something in her that she doesnt have. Or the feelings that you need an idol or something to believe in or an idea to stick to or something. Just let them be, there is nothing you can do about it.
XIbct4fuaa	Unfortunately I am one of those women.  You might be too...you wont know til you start having sex.  But when I have a good sexual relationship with a man, I automatically start to invest emotions into the relationship as well.  Its our nature.|`|AA11307468	If the two people in question are truly friends, there will automatically be a degree of love between them.  Otherwise, they wouldn't be friends.  I'm not talking forever-lasting romantic love.  You can still have love for your friends.  That is what I've always felt for the men who have been sexual partners and friends.  I have never thought that these men have that eternal, fantasy-driven love.  I also have never given part of myself away.  I don't even know how to do that.  When I take a lover, even if it's only for short-term pleasure, I don't give myself away.  I share myself.  There's a difference.|`|BMIW36XFaa	You may be able to answer your own question after you've become sexually active.<br>  <br>  MOST women have sex with men that they have feelings for, making that act more of an emotional act, along with it being a physical act.<br>  <br>  However, even on Y!A, "friends with benefits" don't usually work out so well, because one or the other becomes attached and develops feelings for the other...and someone almost always gets hurt.|`|f6f40965eb7d5df6aa94440ec71e32dcaa	People keep putting a 'price' on virginity or a woman's vagina, which is why people make such a big deal if a woman has sex, no-strings-attached.  I think it's stupid.  It's not all women that think that sex=love, or a fling=a marriage proposal.  I'm sure that most women are mature enough to know if things are going to progress after a sexual encounter.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Just be prepared for the barrage of, "You're a virgin, so you wouldn't know" comments.|`|wkjncmHTaa	Yes, of course it's a stereotype.<br>  <br>  Give a part of myself away? Sure. I like giving and sharing, what's wrong with that?<br>  <br>  I agree with the other poster though, you can't really say how you'll react until you do it.|`|ZWePAEZUaa	I agree.  Yes.|`|t81MEJ82aa	Well if you're a virgin you don't quite know what you'd actually do. Both men and women are not immune to developing feelings after a sexual encounter, however in general men and women can have different views about sex. If we can agree that women are generally more emotional then why would sex be an exception to this? Men like to have sex with women they find physically attractive, therefore the act is driven by sexual appeal whereas many women prefer to have sex with someone they have some type of emotional bond with or someone they'd like to have one with. This is not always the case but generally it is.<br>  <br>  It's not a bad thing. I don't get nowadays why women view certain behaviors that are natural to them are somehow negative. The truth is most women cannot go around having sex like a stereotypical man, all of the time. I don't know any emotionally stable woman who can, and it doesn't matter what age they are.|`|fDGPbwdsaa	Men get a bad rap (in most areas) thanks to feminism promoting untruthful claims about us. It's almost funny, isn't it? On one hand they demand for equality - and tell us it's bad to stereotype people because we're equal... and then focus only on the bad bits of men.<br>  <br>  Some men do not connect sex with emotions - some men do.<br>  <br>  Some women do not connect sex with emotions - some women do.<br>  <br>  <br>  Feminists perpetuate untruthful and derogatory stereotypes of men as being selfish creatures... far from the truth.
vEEeq7kYaa	Many people with OCD and other disorders of impulse control do also have a very creative aspect to them.  I don't know if anyone has done formal studies to show direct corelationships but I do know for a fact that a creative outlet is often an excellent way to cope with some disorders.<br>  <br>  Many creative people, such as Dan Ackroyd, who shares a love of music and art..have impulse control issues.  His childhood stories remind me a bit of what I see in my own son.<br>  <br>  Like Dan Ackroyd, my son has a mild form of Tourette's Syndrome and has difficulty with impulse control ( one doctor said it was mild OCD, another said Impulse control NOS meaning not otherwise specified).  He is also exceptionally intellectually gifted.  It isn't easy to be understood when you're intellectually advanced but your emotions and ability to control them aren't..  When he discovered his musical creative abilities, he has channeled much of his other impulses into them and it helps him to organize his thinking and he is simply doing great.  It also helps keep him from focusing on controlling his disorder and instead, works on focusing his efforts to creative pursuits.<br>  <br>  For example, he used to have to work harder to control disruptive tics and would sometimes "explode" with them after school.  Now since he has been a percussionist for two years, he has an outlet of drumming and that really has helped him. He excels as a percussionist.  He also has been learning to play the guitar and now he is even writing his own songs..some of which sound really good to me.  I think it is a great way to express yourself.  I don't think that it matters at all if they're great songs or if he doesn't ever perform for anyone else other than for himself, because it is as he puts it...something he really needs to feel good.<br>  <br>  I think it's much better than reliance on drugs, alcohol, gambling or any other impulse or addiction people could have.  What's the downside?<br>  <br>  I think that if you've found something that works for you and isn't harming but can even be something that others CAN find enjoyment in as well..go for it!  I agree that it makes no difference if they're great works of art or simply have great meaning for you to express the feelings you put into them.<br>  <br>  Look at it this way..you could have FAR worse compulsions than a compulsion to be creative. <br>  Shalom<br>  <br>  edit: Below is a link to disorders that may be helpful to you or others ..while the site is primarily about tourette's syndrome..this is a quote from the page <br>  In clinical settings, it is common to see children or adults who have more than one problem or condition. When I first started writing about TS+, I did not really understand the reasons for the co-occurrence of certain disorders. Over the years, advances in genetics and neuroscience have helped us all understand that some disorders do, indeed, "go together." For example, Tourette's Syndrome is often accompanied by Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder and/or Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, while Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder is often accompanied by other anxiety disorders and mood disorders such as depression or Bipolar Disorder. <br>  <br>  All of the disorders covered on this web site have been linked to dysfunction in the basal ganglia, a group of structures in the brain that regulate motor control, learning, and behavior. The basal ganglia are also involved in pathways to the frontal lobes, structures in the brain involved in attention, memory, and the executive functions.<br>  <br>  Now back to my words...creative outlets are often a major form of help for many of these disorders.|`|ebQ4vuUnaa	Yes I am compulsive about wanting to create pretty pictures on you w/ body paint lol<br>  <br>  <br>  Have a wonderful weekend!!<br>  <br>  Cinn =)

But it isn't everything. Character is more important. If he's got character but not as great of a sense of humour I can deal with that. But if all he has is humour - and I knew a guy like that - and the character is lacking, that isn't good enough. In that case I'd just remain friends and not take the relationship any further.<br>  <br>  Lucky me, I got a man who has both! He is hilarious, keeps me laughing even when I feel like crying. Sometimes he even makes me laugh until I cry. lol|`|HNAdM1hSaa	Well I would prefer a man who has a sense of humor that is compatible with mine but not someone who always has a stand up comedy show whenever we go somewhere.

She doesn't (most likely) know she was being the 'b-word'. Maybe she thought she was "telling it like it is." Don't worry yourself about these people, they come and go, and most likely THEY are the ones with issues. I had an awful roommate who in a sense tortured me and made very depressed. Looking back she was the one with the issues, she was failing college, bulimic, a drunk, a pot head, among other things.<br>  <br>  Don't waste anymore time with her, c'set la vie, just because you use logic doesn't mean you should expect everyone else too. Do not worry about what she thinks of you, if anything she needs to be worried about what YOU think of her. De tout facon, bon chance, a bientot.<br>  <br>  ~chai

PMpQRSPHaa	You need to start feeling better about yourself- if you are overweight have you joined a gym?  I recently joined and just joining makes you feel better.  Having goals gives you something to look forward to.  Spend some time with your friends and maybe start doing more activities to keep you busy.  <br>  <br>  Maybe nursing is not for you if you're not that excited about it.  I've heard that volunteering at a hospital or nursing home usually helps you decide whether you like it or not.  Or volunteering for anything could help.  Sometimes it helps to take the focus off yourself and help someone else.  That usually makes me feel better.  Hope this helps and best of luck to you.|`|gspTDufpaa	Sometimes it's best to take a short vacation by yourself.

If there's another career path you're interested in, tell your family that this is what you want and you're going to do it.  They'll obviously be hesitant to accept, but once they see you enjoying what you're doing and what your goals in life are they'll have a complete change of heart.<br>  <br>  Something like nursing is something that you really have to want to do in order to enjoy it and excel at it.<br>  <br>  If you don't know what you want to do yet, don't worry, the path will present itself when it's ready.<br>  <br>  DON'T WORRY!!!

You gotta find what's right for you. What is your serenity? What's your perfect scenario. Close your eyes and think about what makes you a good person. Think about how much better you are then those idiotic msn people. Your probably a kind and caring person. Inner being and who you are is what should be important to you when your angry. You didn't make yourself angry. The outside world had inward actions to you to cause problems. This may sound like I'm saying "blame the other guy" but in reality it wasn't you who made you mad.

Block them. Let it out, just relax and treat yourself. It sucks to diet and not eat what everyone else is eating. I have to diet for my whole life because my metabolism is slow. It sucks, but sometimes you just have to treat yourself. Give into temptations and eat that brownie / piece of cake / cookies, whatever and block them! What some movies or do what makes you happy.<br>  <br>  Just step away from the computer and let it all out. Sometimes you just have to because if you keep it bottled in, it's bad for your health. You could become depressed, develope anxiety, etc. LET IT OUT! <br>  <br>  Scream into that pillow! Go outside and throw stuff- Personally I like to break eggs by throwing them at trees. Very soothing. Read, watch tv, paint your toe nails, take a relaxing bath, etc.<br>  <br>  Just do something for you and forget them. Your mother will get over her issues with you, and just relax.

That's until we got our final exam results and guess what the boys out performed the girls not just in mathematics but in english too. <br>  Funny that. <br>  <br>  Boys find school boring love that's all it is as male really do have a higher iq than females.|`|AA11589988	I think a reality check for smug feminists is in order here. Making school exams harder will actually help boys and it's not a paradox.... <br>  <br>  I too am interested in why there has been a trend towards girls outperforming boys in school exams on average over the past forty years. I think that IQ is mostly genetic and if it is then it can't be that boys IQs have tailed off over that period. Feminists are excited that girls are outperforming boys at school but could it be that during those forty years exams have been changed to stop giving problem solving male brains an advantage over girls? I've seen research that shows girls IQs are tightly distributed around an average level whereas boys IQs are represented more at the upper and lower ends of the spectrum than girls. If so then altering exams to award average performance more highly will boost girls average achievement in comparison to boys. <br>  <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/7497486.stm" rel="nofollow">http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/749...</a><br>  "The experiment, by the Royal Society of Chemistry, showed students scored highest on the most recent questions and worst on those from the 1960s." <br>  "A preliminary finding is that pupils are unused to more complex problem-solving involving a number of steps in completing calculations, without the prompting that is prevalent in some modern examination questions." <br>  On the distribution of IQs in boys and girls... "There are more males 3-4 standard deviations above the mean, and more males 3-4 standard deviations below the mean, which would mean that there are more male super-geniuses than females, and more male super-idiots than females" <br>  <a href="http://mjperry.blogspot.com/2007/09/shame-on-uc-davis-and-reporter-sharon.html" rel="nofollow">http://mjperry.blogspot.com/2007/09/sham...</a>|`|zIqfIIlMaa	I visited Asia last year.

I think that's one reason why girls outperform boys - boys squirm and wiggle, and end up getting in trouble or missing something that the teacher said, but since one teacher has to teach 30 kids she can't go back and redo part of the lesson for the boy who missed a bit of it. If you can work with a boy's energy level and learning style he will do a wonderful job at school. <br>  <br>  It isn't that girls are better at school; it's that school is more suited to girls. Boys need extra help, different teaching methods, and a whole lot more understanding than they are getting right now. It is mostly boys who end up drugged to the eyeballs with Ritalin for being "ADD"  when in reality they are simply exhibiting normal healthy behaviour for a little boy.
3urQfMffaa	Why would a mentor end the relationship? Anyway, to answer your question, what happened to the child still takes part in her life, even if the abuse had stopped. She learned that other people could not be trusted or she'd risk getting betrayed, but she could not accept that. She still clings to her mentor bc she prolly had nowhere else to turn. Her mother already abused her and her mentor abandoned her. I mean, that's bull. People need that basic trust and good relationship with others to live and the child never had a chance at that.|`|agpCn6Kaaa	If the female mentor has bailed out of the situation, then of course the child (depending on the age) will cling to the one person he/she felt the safest with.  Of course, walking out on a child who needs you is crappy, if you ask me.

NYU37jfGaa	In 'Goddesses, whores, Wives and Slaves, women in Classical Antiquity' Sarah b. Pomeroy writes:<br>  <br>  'The goddess Aphrodite represents physical beauty, sexual love, and fertility.  According to Hesiod, she, like Athena, was born of man, not of woman.  Her origin in sexual organs and the sea underlines Aphrodite's nature as a fertility figure.<br>  <br>  much of Aphrodite's seductiveness lies in her frivolous, deceitful character, for these appear to be qualities of sexually attractive women.  She, the most beautiful goddess, is married to Hepahestus, the ugliest immortal.  Perhaps this unfortunate union gives her an excuse for marital infidelity.  Of all the goddesses, only Aphrodite committs adultery, and indiscretion considered only mildly censurable ina lvoe goddess who is sacred to prostitutes.'<br>  <br>  In Greek society, as in most societies in the world, girls were expected to be virgins when they married, and chaste and faithful to their husbands thereafter.  During the classical era, Athenian girls were married off very young, at age 12-14, and it would probably have been much the same in Homer's day.  spartan girls married later, at about 18, because this was thought to be healthier, and a Spartan woman's main purpose in life was to bear healthy children.  For this reason also Spartan women were encouraged to exercise and take part in sports, and leave the spinning and weaving to the slave women.<br>  <br>  The Greeks believed that women were sex mad, and that all sorts of problems could arise if a woman was not getting sex regularly.  But infidelity was not encouraged.  In Homer's Odyssesy for instance, Penelope is the model of the virtuous wife, spending her time spinning and weaving, and fending off her unwelcome suitors by unravelling her weaving every night, so she doesn't have to marry any of them.  <br>  <br>  As in most societies, it was okay for a man to have sex with women other than his wife, with slaves and prostitutes, but women were expected to be faithful.  Odysseus hangs the slave girls who have slept with his wife's suitors, even though they probably had no choice in the matter. <br>  <br>  Aphrodite, being a goddess, might get away with committing adultery, but this would not be something mortal women would be encouraged to do.  In classical Athens, the sexuality of women was regulated by law.  The husband of an adulterous woman was legally compelled to divorce her.  A woman thus condemned was not allowed to participate in public ceremonies, nor to wear jewellery, and she would be a social outcast and never find another husband.  so what was acceptable for a goddess was not acceptable for ordinary mortal women.  A man who seduced a citizen woman could be legally killed by her husband.<br>  <br>  There is no reason to suppose that adulterly was treated any less severely in Homer's day.  Maybe even more so, perhaps it was customary to kill the wife as well as her lover.|`|QQQ36jMOaa	Hmm, Greece is a long time.  Let me see if I can just get you a good link, otherwise I would be writing for quite a while.  Hold on.<br>  <br>  Here--this has a list of women with links provided and several sources on each.  Personally, I always liked Artemisia.  But I like warrior women :)  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://womenshistory.about.com/od/ancientgreece/Ancient_Greece_Women.htm" rel="nofollow">http://womenshistory.about.com/od/ancien...</a><br>  <br>  EDIT--Hmm, that sort of is a difficult thesis to argue, considering that there is little information about how women acted due to religion.  You CAN talk about the temple prostitutes performing sacred sexual rites as a form of religious ceremony--and how said prostitutes were called priestesses and protected from harm by the law as well as considered sacred.<br>  <br>  EDIT--Ugh, that's pretty hard.  Well, I would try to find sources that talk about women's sexuality.  The idea that she should feel ashamed for having sexual desire is a modern one.  Aphrodite wouldn't have been ashamed of wanting sex because it wasn't thought that the desire was BAD back then (unless outside of moderation).  Perhaps link her to other mythological characters?  Like what about Circe in The Odyssey?  She had no problem with her sexual desire and she goes on a rant about the double standard set up by the gods against goddesses and sexuality.
26wIVy7Saa	In an open letter to the ONDCP, Susan Fisk writes:<br>  <br>  In 2005, the federal government spent $12.2 billion on the Office of National Drug Control Policy alone (ONDCP, 1) while federal, state, and local governments combined spending exceeded $30 billion (National Research Counsel, 1).  Much of this money is spent to incarcerate marijuana users due to the existing laws and the existence of mandatory minimums.  Since the war on drugs began, ten million Americans have been arrested for marijuana offenses, around 250,000 have been convicted of marijuana felonies and been sent to prison for at least a year.  In 2001 alone, 724,000 individuals were arrested for violating marijuana laws and 90% of these arrests were for simple possession of marijuana.  This is a costly endeavor as it costs between $20,000 and $30,000 to keep a prisoner behind bars for one year. (Schlosser,<br>  <br>  Leaving alone the tax benefits, the simple reduction in these costs as a result of legalization and regulation are staggering. <br>  <br>  Monies that are spent on incarceration, could be spent on education. This would be an investment in our future that we can believe it.|`|peybb4Foaa	It would never be legalized government and tobacco companies get SH*T load of money from tobacco.<br>  <br>  Legalizing cannabis would not only crash the tobacco companies it would make people live longer ( there is NO proven connection between marijuana and lung cancer)|`|AA11487579	Eh, not much.<br>  <br>  The industry itself is anywhere from $4 billion to $20 billion nationwide. Taxing that at a rate of 50% would net $2 billion to $10 billion, which goes to the government and is taken away from the weed-buyers. Money going to the government is generally less efficient than keeping the money with consumers (at least if you are only considering the effects on the economy, and not things like public health or societal cohesion).<br>  <br>  Another argument against legalizing the sale of grass and taxing it is that suddenly you can have an expansion of the market through advertising. An alternative might be to let people grow their own and give it away, but not to sell it. However, this means no taxes.|`|hycpoz5faa	My philosophy is "Make hay while the sun shines" until the government finally figures out how much the industry is worth, not millions,but billions, it will remain illegal.<br>  <br>  The pros of it remaining illegal are that while their are no laws and regulations to hinder sales (besides the obvious), its distribution will remain local. if its illegal, your friends, your fiances mom, your loser manager, will all be likely sources to purchase marijuana from. keeping the money local, and not to mention tax free.<br>  <br>  The fallowing is where I tend to disagree with many of my peers,<br>  while they feel legalizing and taxing would create a start-up cabin industry in america. I feel if it where legalized and taxed, the growing and processing of the marijuana would take place over seas in places like the middle east and Columbia where the economy already heavily relies on the marijuana industry already. True the american government would still make money off taxing the product but the lower and middle class would suffer as they could no longer offer competitive prices<br>  <br>  There is money to be made by legalizing, just not as much as people think.|`|siuPYTplaa	There are medical marijuana buisness that already pay taxes, on the documentary Marijuana Inc : America's Pot Industry a owner of serveral stores says he pays about 1million a year in taxes.

ToILKl6waa	You lack motivation. You need to find something you want and set your mind to it. Not just tell yourself it's your goal. Roll it around in your mind - think of its benefits. And think how education ties to most or all goals and dreams. It is certainly necessary for you to force yourself up at first, but once you're involved in your studies, things won't be as difficult. Think of the grades you'll get, the pride you'll feel, the information that will be processed in your mind. Let go of whatever fear that is holding you back and take one issue at a time. Don't let the stress overwhelm you - everything can be done if it is done with a positive attitude. Make a check list and set your mind to checking off every item by the end of the night.

They want to help you and can medicate you.<br>  <br>  As for extra stress maybe try meditating. I know, I know- meditating is mumbo jumbo and it's lame, etc- but it really does help if you let it. You just have to sometimes let go of the past and work towards the future. That's all anyone can do in this situation is give it your best effort and work as hard as you can. It will pay off if you try your best and manage your time wisely.<br>  <br>  Listen to some music, sit back and relax- take a 20 minute nap, eat some ice cream or a brownie! Treat yourself when you do good things or succeed in what you are doing. <br>  <br>  If your school is based on levels and credits, consider going down in levels or dropping a class.

The only way to stop it is to put people in ofice that have morals and are humble. It's very hard to do because all of the people in power are not moral, and some times good hearted people go into power and become corrupted. Once you do one thing wrong, or let one little thing slip by say off the record, you have do more and more corrupt things to cover it up, and i suppose after a while it gets out of hand.|`|ND1nFEWSaa	once started............ego gets out of hand and control|`|b4aadea01a6f367b0812c512a44d4cb4aa	In order to acquire a lot of power one has to be doing something right.<br>  It may not be an absolute that power leads to corruption but there is a lot of evidence out there to make many think that it is so.<br>  <br>  Some have thought in the past that life brings us constant change which in our more asleep moments helps us to deviate from the straight and narrow.  What follows then would be phenomena which in time causes our paths to make an eventual 180 degree turn.  In other words, if a bit of fear happened to enter the minds of a supposed pure holder of power, then that focus and the ensuing momentum, and it would not have to be terribly lengthy or strong, would be enough to start the creation of a corruption process.<br>  <br>  If noticed and if the person realized exactly what was going on, it then could be counteracted upon and the original path could be reintroduced delegating the temporary error to the past and hopefully lose all of it`s energy as far as that particular person would be concerned.  <br>  <br>  To answer your second question, the how to stop it bit, I have already mentioned the most important part above.  First the straying has to be noticed.  This requires conscious thought, perhaps as part of a person`s daily review.  The person then must re-orient the focus back to a more positive one, more in keeping with the original program, the one which was helpful in the course of gaining the power.<br>  <br>  I hope this does not sound too complicated as it is actually really simple.  More information related to the adjustment processes can be found in books such as `` Ask And It Is Given``  by Esther and Jerry Hicks.  Whatever is said relating to health can also be applied to the acquiring of abundance and power.  Actually they have a new book coming out soon regarding abundance.<br>  <br>  Cheers!

lMH2cA1kaa	You mean stabilize or regulate their financial market? Answer would be completely different. <br>  <br>  When Chinese government saw the bubble in the stock market, they did several things to bust the bubble: 1. they increased capital gain taxes and stock trade taxes; 2, they raised interest rates for numerous times; 3, they regulated account rules for public companies; 4, they intentionally reduced market liquidity; 5, they lower the bar for IPO offerings.<br>  <br>  After market bubble was successfully busted, the global financial crisis happened. In order to stop continuing market deterioration, Chinese government quickly reversed those regulations. 1, the reduced stock trade taxes; 2, they reduced interest rates 5 times in a short period of time; 3, they injected liquidity and even direct funding to the market; 4, they virtually halted IPO offerings. That is why Chinese stock market is the strongest in this global economic downturn.

I had nothing but good dreams that night but then 2 weeks later I had a horrible dream that I was being hunted by Michael, as if I was in a Halloween movie myself.<br>  <br>  Dreaming is not quite fully understood. Your mind will generate dreams on their own and most of the time you wonder "Where did my mind come up with something like that?". I would say that on this particular dream your mind brough the zombie memories from a previous movie, show, book, that came in contact with and used that to create the dream. I have dreams all the time of things that happened a long time ago. In fact, the other night I had a dream about  walking down New York and could hear the theme song to Law and Order. Now I watch Law and Order a lot but I didn't watch it remotely during that week.<br>  <br>  Thats my theory. Dreams are quite the mystery that isn't completely solved.

This only happened after I committed myself in a relationship with Him, not religion.  If you don't have this relationship, pray the following out loud:<br>  <br>   "Dear Lord Jesus, come into my heart. Forgive me of my sin. Wash me and cleanse me.  Jesus, thank You that You died for me so I would have eternal life. I believe that You are the Son of God who rose from the dead and that You’re coming back again for me. I'll live for you. Thank you, Lord for saving me. Amen." <br>  <br>  If you sincerely meant what you prayed, Congratulations and welcome to the family of God! Keep the relationship going by: <br>  o Talking to God everyday about everything. Ask for His help in the name of Jesus Christ. Expect a change for the better, and speak  encouraging words to yourself, using the Word of God<br>  o Reading, meditating, and applying His Word daily from the Bible to your life. Start with St. John from an easy-to-read version.<br>  o Making friends at a local Bible-teaching, Holy Spirit-led church, for encouragement.<br>  o Telling others about Jesus Christ.<br>  <br>  Check the resources below.|`|vUC8QnX8aa	Im practically the same as you i have been feeling depressed,slippin a little in school,harm myself and i have had thoughts on suicide. <br>  And i had a dream that i hung myself.<br>  But don't worry it doesnt mean your going to do that only you decide on that.<br>  This is what it says on a dream interpreation site<br>  <br>  To dream that you commit suicide, suggests that conditions in your life are so frustrating that you no longer want to deal with the situation or relationship You may be harboring feelings of guilt that you cannot get over and thus turning the aggression on yourself. You need to start approaching problems from a different angle. Alternatively, it may suggest that you are saying good-bye to one aspect of yourself and hello to a whole new you.

BehIVocqaa	Loss of interest in activities you used to like or enjoy is one of the DSM-IV listed symptoms of depression.  I see you sliding down into what I call the pit (darkness, despair, suicidal thoughts).  I know because I've been there.  I've had bipolar depression my whole life.  I am also a professional counselor and have seen depression from that side, too.  Reach out for help now while you are still willing to do it.  Obviously, you care enough to post this question, so go with that feeling.  Tell your psychiatrist that the depression is not getting better and talk to him/her about changing your meds.  Proper use of the right kind of medication can really help stabilize mood.<br>  In my personal opinion, most psychiatrists take their best guess and hope they are right.  They never let on that this is the case, and we go on using meds/treatment that doesn't work or makes us worse.  In the meantime, we suffer for it.  One of the hardest things for me to do was insist on more/different treatment when I was severely depressed.  I definitely feel for you.<br>  I am much better now, and I am stabilized on proper meds and therapy.  You can get here, too.  Good luck to you, and email if you ever want to talk.|`|wKN7n2RKaa	Sit down with a big pad of paper and write "I wish..." at the top.<br>  Under that, start numbering a list of things that you want to do.  Dream it up, and make it a list that you really want.  It could be like this.<br>  <br>  1. to learn Sign Language<br>  2. to learn to fly a glider<br>  3. to stand on the Great Wall of China<br>  4. to own a black great dane.<br>  <br>  List at least 101 things.  Do more if you like.  As you start to get into your writing, it will get exciting to think about seeing things you want, doing things that you want.  <br>  <br>  f you like, you can list any of the great things that you have done already.  Feel the happiness for things that you have managed to do already, because there are people who will never have the chance to achieve some goals that you can have.  <br>  <br>  These goals are for you, not for anyone else, so go crazy, and be positive.  They will be what you find important.   <br>  <br>  Now, you will have a list of goals to keep you busy for the rest of your life, and you will be busy doing them and having fun.<br>  <br>  I've been taking different things, prozac, at one time, paxil now, so I'm there with you on this too.  You may find things that make it more fun to be with your old friends, or you may find that new interests will generate new friends!<br>  <br>  Life is a scavenger hunt, and you make the list of what to find.  The most successful is whomever has the longest and most complete list, and will make everyone else watching you say, "WOW!"  Good luck!|`|Ekg4H6HQaa	Prozac doesn't always help and many pills will not help, either. They may help every so often but don't depend on them to get better. That's bad! <br>  <br>  You need to find something other than a pill to help you sleep. Drink some tea, don't eat anything within 2-3 hours before bedtime. Don't watch TV before bed, either. No internet, either. Get a good book and try to get into that before bed and listen to soothing music (not popular stuff but classical and things like that). <br>  <br>  I don't like pills. I was proscribed pills to make me forget my problems at one point and that got me thinking: every time I take that pill, I would reminded of what I'm trying to forget! It's not the same here, but you need to realize that pills will hurt you many times. Change your diet and eat healthier foods. Do this for at least the next 3 months and see for yourself if anything is different. <br>  <br>  As for lack of interest, I understand what you're going through. Everyone does it differently, and I know it's hard to just go out and try to enjoy what you don't care for, but do try it more often. Go for a walk and plan to look at the scenery and enjoy the birds and trees, etc. It may be boring and not fun but you need to get your mind off what's bothering you. Go out and help other people. Rather than focusing on yourself and depression and lack, go out and look for someone to help, talk to, keep company, etc. There are plenty of opportunities there, you just have to look for them. Helping others will keep your mind off your problems and will make you feel better about yourself. Anxiety may or may not disappear but you need to keep looking for the reason it's there in the first place. It doesn't just happen. Get a job, get yourself involved in different things, take a class about something you wouldn't think of getting into right now, anything. <br>  <br>  When I didn't care about anything, I would stay home and cry or just be bored. Then I took it upon myself to go out and I actually found myself loving what I was doing. You will quit but the point is to keep going, and if you quit, make it a goal to start again, even if it will be next month. Find yourself and understand why you're feeling like this and you will eventually know what to do with your life's problems. It's not easy but it's been done many times before. It is NOT impossible.

8XCdkeudaa	Start telling the reader physically what happens. Like heart beating fast, sweaty palms and a light headed feeling. Then emotional things, like fear and anxiety coming on. Maybe she could get angry. Have her run out of the house possibly. Lock all the doors even. What about passing out from anxiety. Feet feel like trembling. Maybe she could start mumbling to herself in the fetal position. Anythings a possibility.|`|ShgP7NBtaa	Lucky me I have a friend in foster care :-) more than likely if she was attached to a previous foster mom she might leave the house and run to her last foster mom for fear of being alone. Or if she has a boyfriend there's a chance she would take having the house alone to her advantage call him over end up with him sleeping over and then having to hide him in the morning lol. Or she could leave and go to her boyfriend and end up running away for days those are pretty common reactions|`|3S4ci6Traa	I think she'd probably try and contact her previous foster mom.  If that fails, she'd probably get very nervous.  Think about how you felt when you were younger and were afraid.  Since she kept being bounced around from foster home to foster home, she may be more likely to be more tense than a normal 15 year old and probably act more like a 8-10 year old in an "alone at mall" situation.  Since she's 15, I believe she'd try and call either her new foster parents (and this will help build a description of how her parents may react to her.  if her new parents ignore her pleas, then they may seem too careless; if they seem worried, then it would show them as being caring) or she may try and contact her foster mother.<br>  <br>  She would hate to be outside, so she'd probably try and stay inside as much as possible since being outside may terrify her.  Multiply all possible sounds she may hear to the point of being terrified also.  If the neighbors own a dog, a soft whining could be multiplied to what may sound to her like maniacal laughing.  When you're nervous, some of your senses go haywire, and your brain doesn't know what to make of some things.|`|T8WFrELhaa	scared of every little noise she hears outside, probably shakes, pupils dialate, looks outside, hides, rolls up into a little ball
WXF4vtyZaa	write down all your fears, insecurities, and things you want to let go, let out everything. Then shred them, tear 'em up, or burn them whatever you want just release them from yourself and feel better. Then write down want you want to do, who you want to be, the great things in your life, your potential, etc. Every morning pick out 3 good things about you or your life and write them down in a notebook. Stretch out your body and read this too:<br>  <br>  "Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful BEYOND measure. It is our light, not our darkness, that most frightens us. We ask ourselves, Who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented, fabulous? Actually, who are you NOT to be? You are a child of God. Your playing small doesn't serve the WORLD. There is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people won't feel insecure around you. We are ALL meant to shine, as children do. We were born to make manifest the Glory of God that is within us. It's not just in some of us; it's in EVERYONE. And as we let our own light shine, we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same. As we are liberated from our own fear, our presence automatically liberates others." -Marianne Williamson<br>  I'm almost positive that you will feel great!|`|r8VvBxM6aa	I know it's not easy, but once you can block out everyone else's negativity you can focus on your own positivity.

Women get pissed at this fact when you bring it up, but it's the truth and justifies men getting paid more for the same job.|`|HymlYNGZaa	Yikes.. I'm not sure exactly where to begin with this post but I felt inclined to offer some insight given your clear misinterpretation of a few things. Salaries are indeed based on the quantity, quality, and value of their work in the aggregate. What you are qualifying as "intangible value" is in reality a market realization of worth. In this specific instance, (you cite police officers) salaries are determined according to public revenue streams in a city ordinance as well as relative danger of job (which has been empirically studied with regard to risk aversion). Specifically speaking, police officers are not private workers as they are designated to receive government salaries on a county by county basis. More generally the police officer's job is in relative lower demand given the large pool of capable people to become officers. You might value their service to you as being greater than a pro basketball player's but in reality the pro athlete is seen as doing something more unique and difficult, regardless of the moral or societal worth of an individual player. Pro basketball players are paid as much as they are given their skills are in such high demand and without elastic supply (easy substitutes). This in turn is the opposite for police officers who are hired from a much larger and presumably homogenized supply pool. No doubt the total value of the officer (the amount that would be paid to the first and only officer) will be much higher than the total value of the athlete, however it is clear the marginal value (the value gained by one additional officer) is exponentially lower than that of the athlete. <br>  <br>  Now on the fallacious assumptions about why men and women have different pay. As simple as you think it is that men are better negotiators or "more bold" in asking for salaries you are falling victim to the very spurious reasoning that propagates that women are paid less than men for the same work. Although the aggregate statistics would allow people to believe this, in reality women and men that work similar hours per week, similar jobs, have similar years of experience, and similar education make almost identical salaries. In fact many studies cite that women with similar characteristics make 98% of what men do and in more than 40 U.S. industries actually make more than men. The real disparity in wages lies in women's proclivities to exit the work force (for personal or family reasons usually), deal in industries with lower degree decay rates (such as English vs a high decay rate field like Computer Engineering), be risk adverse to dangerous jobs, or move less often to find work. Also startling is the gap between men and women in part time work is almost 2 to 1 (2 women for every man). Again, most of this comes from women's decisions to stay with younger children, raise families, or deal with other responsibilities outside of the work force. <br>  <br>  <br>  The unfortunate measure of gross statistics leads to misconceptions like this but basically neither you or the aforementioned feminist have a very strong grasp on the subject you are referring to.|`|0d183ab8af4fe4c2164d74294bd981adaa	I only have a problem with men getting paid more, when it comes to management deciding who needs a raise more. A lot of times in the past raises were given to men rather then women because it was assumed that the man had a family to support. Meanwhile it was assumed working women did not have a family depending on them. This is unfair and disgusting!|`|S2vI4VEXaa	I don't have a problem with anyone getting paid more because they do a better job within the job.<br>  Professional athletes get paid different salaries, Kobe Bryant makes more money per year from his salary as a Laker than any of his teammates. Why? Because he's better at what he does than they are..<br>  That's the way it's always been.

Some of the decrease in value is just a reflection of the fact that a significant amount of the money which had been invested in the stock market has just been pulled out of the market when investors sold off their holdings.<br>  <br>  On the other hand billions of dollars of wealth have been destroyed.  Just as if it had gone up in flames.|`|MJijF66Paa	Well first of all, if you had your money in the right place you could of made money. It wasn't all losses for everyone.<br>  <br>  When you buy a security or invest into some kind of capital vehicle, you're actually buying something that is worth that amount. So for instance, if I bought a stock for $50 and that stock fell 10 points (20%) the next day, it's not that my money "went away", that security is just less valuable.|`|AcgDcQG0aa	When the stock market crashes then it's similar to a housing market crash.  <br>  <br>  House prices go down because buyers aren't willing to pay for houses as much as before.  And house owners feel that they've lost some money, because their house are now cheaper than before.<br>  <br>  Stock prices go down because buyers aren't willing to pay for stocks as much as before.  And stock owners feel that they've lost some money, because their stocks are now cheaper than before.<br>  <br>  But in both cases, people don't actually loose any money unless they sell their property at a cheaper price than they've paid earlier when they bought the property.|`|Ny5FYSvEaa	It wasn't really money that disappeared, it was value. The value of many financial instruments had been pushed higher than it should have been before the crash, and after the crash it got pushed lower than it should have been. So suddenly these things that people used to be able to sell for a lot can only be sold for a little.<br>  <br>  Price is somewhat determined by supply and demand, so when the demand drops all of a sudden, the price will probably drop too.<br>  <br>  So all these people and institutions that borrowed to buy these assets suddenly owe a lot more than the value of the assets they have. That is when institutions start going under.|`|Jzpf9aYAaa	The Money lost is not material it is only what is called paper money ie figures written on a piece of paper.<br>  If I gave you a piece of paper saying I will give you $1000.00 you would say beauty I can now go & buy a cat but when you come to collect the actual money, I say sorry I can only have $100.00 to give you then you would have lost $900.00.

This doesn't mean everyone does it however a pretty good amount of people do that. I don't know exactly what your situation is but you have the possibility when someone gets in trouble and the teacher talks to them about it then you get scared and a lot of ppl cry when being lectured for doing something wrong especially if they already know they're wrong and feel guilty. If it's just asking for advice or telling them whatever then it could be because you have no friends that your willing to confide in but you want to tell someone so your forced into telling a teacher so you can get it out but at the same time your uncomfortable telling them. Then you have situations like me, I'm more comfortable talking to teachers than anyone else I even have a few of my teachers cell phone numbers and I've cried 3 times talking to teacher cuz the situation was so severe.

I know people with those attitudes are crass....but we all have our own little brand of things that the world could judge us for and to stand acccusatory of others simply by something you hear from a third party source isn't sufficient enough...or should it even warrant reaction.|`|DsEEATKSaa	It's none of your concern.<br>  <br>  Let it go.<br>  <br>  ~M~

qpE61GePaa	I have to say this made me sad.<br>  <br>  Please, don't allow this to take you over. I can see this affecting your life negatively for a long time if you allow it.<br>  <br>  Maybe you feel this way, because you are trying to hide the fact that you don't have anyone to open up to around you. By closing up, you feel like you are controlling life. "I choose to close up." This protects you from others abusing you and you feeling helpless.<br>  <br>  Agh, but you already pretty much said that didn't you?<br>  <br>  Tell me, what about working makes you feel good? And you did say that at one point you were happy and in love, correct?<br>  <br>  Whatever you do, never close your heart on all of humanity, there are those of us out there who truly despise hatred and pain in this world, who aren't out for lust, and who wish beyond anything else for the basic happiness of love. If you close your heart and race through life, then it will be gone before you know it, and you'll be old, and miserable. Slow down, look for these people, who really care, and give humanity a chance.<br>  <br>  I truly hope that you will find happiness, and that pain shall not be a haunting demon in your life.|`|fcbf59d3765fc40afec4d3523db17ba8aa	You need to forgive.

LYhiCV4saa	Hi, Jmiller. One solution, although it wouldn't involve sexual touching, would be to pay for a professional massage. A lot of people have massages for stress relief or muscle problems, so there would be no need to feel embarrassed. If you're very shy, you might feel awkward removing a lot of your clothing, but you could speak to the masseur about that. Do you think this would help? I hope you find a solution- people do need to be touched- it's a basic human need. I really wish you well. Jenny|`|9EVcTnUWaa	Ok if you want to be touched in a non sexual way which is what it sounds like than volunteer some where.  Kids love hugs and so do senior citizens.  Work with those who have less than you and you'll not only feel better about yourself you'll find basic human contact.  You might be surprised that it help you to over come your shyness as children don't look at you for any thing but acceptance for themselves.  They want the same things that you do love and human contact.  The same for seniors who might not get a lot of other human company.  Look outside of yourself and you might find all of what you want.|`|eXbGpOAfaa	well, if not prostitution get a girl drunk at a club or somthing...I dunno that's pretty sad though.|`|UVPEvwy9aa	Sleep with a random guy in a gay club.

oWYevEPtaa	Perhaps you are insecure?  Maybe you are afraid that people will become bored of you, so you decide to distance yourself instead.  A lot of people are really fun when you first meet them because they want to make a good impression, but you have to realize that people cannot be fun ALL the time.  When people become comfortable with other people, they feel like they don't have to be fun in order to entertain their friends.  You need to be more secure with yourself and try to have fun by relaxing with your friends. Playing board games or watching movies at houses are a favorite of me and my friends.  <br>  <br>  I'm in college and when I started, I wanted to make a good impression and try to be fun! Once I become comfortable with people, we didn't need to drink or party in order to enjoy each other's company.|`|XxMhbMa3aa	I have the same problem. Or at least I think I do. Maybe it's just in our heads. We care so much about what others think about us and what we want them to think, that we obsess about every single action and worry about what people think about those actions.<br>     I have also found that when I am around people, I loose control and get carried away, talking too much and not watching what it is I say, and then regret those actions later when I'm alone and have time to think by myself. Are you the same way?<br>     I find comfort in knowing that this IS in our heads and that because of that we are the only ones who will remember. Unless you did anything too offensive, no one will remember and you can start over with a clean sleight, trying harder to watch your actions and try not to become too overbearing on others.<br>     I hope this helps. And about the being bored of other people, I guess I can't help you there. Sorry.|`|AA11228933	I think I know what  you mean. There was someone at work that was very outspoken. I mean always talking. Saying sensible things and stuff but just non-stop. They didn't realize other people need time to think over things instead of speaking up with a rapid fire answer.<br>  Sometimes he talked himself into a corner and made everyone feel uncomfortable with his words. But because we all had to work with him<br>  we allowed him to continue just for the entertainment value.<br>  Lesson is: give other people time to add to conversation instead of assuming that people are agreeing with you. Maybe you can learn something. Be a good listener too.|`|QgeX3Pdqaa	You're already starting to irritate me.
9EVcTnUWaa	I have the same advice for you that I give to my 16 year old daughter and 17 year old niece who want to be come psychiatrist and psychologist.  Finish high school with the best grades that you can get.  Do as much college work as you can now and know that going to college is serious.  Some students get into college and go crazy because it's the first time that they have some freedom and they forget what their ultimate goal is.  What do you have to do, finish college with a BA and and enter medical school.  After getting a medical degree you have to do a residency for 1to 3 years getting your education in psychiatry before you're allowed to practise.  Instead of going to medical school my daughter will have to go to graduate school and get her PH.D. with a residency also in psychology instead of psychiatry.  Know that it will be a long hard road but at the end you'll have a great career and you'll be really proud of yourself.|`|1uRUaSblaa	Psychologists (PhD, PsyD, EdD) and psychiatrists (MD) are both doctoral-level clinicians, but only psychiatrists can prescribe medications. Psychiatrists spend most of their training years in medical school and the last 3 years learning about mental health in a psychiatry residency. Psychologists spend their entire graduate education learning about mental health (typically 5-to-7 years), followed by supervised internship experience.<br>  Maybe you can check out this website for details on schools and etc.. ...<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.allpsychologyschools.com/faqs/becoming" rel="nofollow">http://www.allpsychologyschools.com/faqs...</a>|`|k3ZVZmBJaa	I think it is important for you to understand the difference between a psychologist and a psychiatrist.  I assume that you do and that you know psychiatrists must attend post-graduate medical school.  They are medical doctors (MD) who specialize in psychology.  So. for undergraduate (or whatever your equivalent is in your country) you need to focus on social science, sociology, biology, psychology, or pre-med.  Those are the general majors that will assist you in gaining admittance to medical school.  Obviously, you need to maintain exceptional grades AND you need to be involved in research, directed study, or internship so that you have the hands-on abilities in addition to the classroom abilities.  This is very important for both medical school and masters or doctoral level schooling (for psychology).<br>  <br>  If you decide you would rather be a psychologist, the advice is pretty much the same, but you would seek to apply to a doctoral (PhD or PsyD) graduate program.  Again, maintain high-level grades throughout and focus on hands-on, clinical experiences.
0bYcYz2jaa	If you do not seek psychiatric help on your own, nothing will change.  If you do attempt suicide and help arrives in time, you will get psychiatric attention whether you want it or not.  If you succeed, well, you know the result there.  If you do not want to talk to a doctor, consider spiritual counseling.  Counselors, psychiatrists and traditional doctors are all very different, maybe you just need to find one you are comfortable with.  At least try, the alternative is not a good one.  Hope you are smart enough to know just how much you need help.  Good luck.|`|AA11809403	if you are thinking about suicide a lot, you NEED a doc. i am sorry you hate them, but to save your life, it is worth gritting your teeth and asking for help.
lTUXdbCTaa	You don't need to go feeling suicidal. I can imagine it is SO tough what you're going through. But you will have to go through hard times in your life. God never promised life would be easy. You have to work hard sometimes. And you WILL make it through! Just be yourself and never give up...

Try looking at it this way:  You now have to ability to go find someone else, someone better!  I was in the same situation about 1 1/2 ago.  My boyfriend at the time broke up with me because I was smothering him with my attention - it was too much for him.  I was too serious about our relationship and we weren't right for each other.  He didn't treat me the best, which always surprises me now - why I didn't break up with him sooner.  I cried after he broke up with me, but I had a really good friend to help get my spirits back up.  I met a new guy, Greg.  He is wonderful and we are now engaged with a new house and a new puppy.  I guess what I'm trying to say is that you need to get out there and try to network with people to make new and better friends no matter how hard it might seem.  How did you meet the guy you're talking about?  Can you meet a new guy that same way?  There's always someone out there in the same situation, looking for the same thing as you...try to find him.  <br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  Emily|`|g8Z6Q1FCaa	Take a class. Join a gym or a group. Get out and meet people. We all need to have some people in our lives. Also, find time to pray. Talk to God every day.  He will help to fill that void of emptyness.  Listen to happy music. Dance by yourself. Think about what you DO have in live. Not everyone has someone who loves them like that. You are not alone in this. Believe me.  This may be only a small gap in your life. Things can get better. In the meantime, savor time alone. Your heart will heal but it may take some time. Find things you like to do. Draw, write, play an instrument, exercise.  In the meantime, try to meet new like love and friendship take time to grow. God bless you.|`|x1CcZBENaa	Why don't you try joining a club or starting a hobby? I used to take dance classes and I made friends there. You could take swimming lessons or volunteer at your public library. When I was in college I volunteered at the county animal shelter, all I had to do was walk and pet the dogs and play with the cats. If you can find an animal shelter where they don't put animals to sleep, then they appreciate volunteer work like that, in order to keep the animals happy until they get adopted. Just get out there and see what you can find.and you are already making friends here in the internet so that's a good start|`|i4ThsyUCaa	First of all, determine what the problem was. How come you "blew it with him"? Whatever the answer is to that question, you have two options: One, find him and talk to him. Two, take a deep breath, maybe cry a bit (just let it all out!), and move on. Think about whether you really want to stay together, and if so, go ahead and tell him. You would regret it if you don't. But if it happens that you realize it's time for a change and you would really want to try and make some new friends, now's a good time to back away and shift your focus. Take a risk. You may end up with better friends (and a super duper boyfriend) than you think! Best of luck, xoxo.
1d87d68d27feaf630ac18e418360ae11aa	It sounds like a multiple disorder starting with BPD -borderline personality disorder and ranging to psychopathic behavior. All of the symptoms you described can begin in childhood and are related to psychopathy, (ie, cruelty to animals, charm, no remorse for actions,etc). Antisocial behavior is another big clue to the disorder. I suggest going to wikipedia and searching psychopathy and related disorders. I think you will be amazed at how many of the symptoms match the ones on your list. This child needs immediate help.|`|AA11809403	this isn't a proper diagnosis, but there are a lot of symptoms there that fit with sociopath, the type that may become a serial killer.<br>  <br>  i would expect to find both brain injury, and horrible childhood experiences.|`|8XCdkeudaa	Sounds like me minus the violent parts. I'd say it's depression/manic depression or a type of mood swing.|`|8AIB6iWaaa	There isn't a title for this, but all these symptoms are the result of personal emotional, psychological and possibly physical trauma and or abuse.<br>  <br>  I know cause I was this person when I was a teenager and I have seen these exact syptoms in far too many others. <br>  <br>  The past haunts teenagers more than anyone else. And the adults who try to help them far often than not don't really know the root problems or how to help them. And to make things more frustrating to those who are trying to help, you just simply can't erase the past. <br>  <br>  I felt these things because I felt abandoned and unloved. I build a wall around me to protect what I had left of personal identity and showed the rest of the world whatever mask I wanted to at any given time.  This was always determined by who was around and what they wanted to see. If someone wanted a clown, I was a clown. If someone wanted to be stupid or crazy, well you see the pattern. <br>  <br>  I simply stopped caring because I thought why should I? no one cares enough about me to prevent what happened to me. No one cared enough to protect me or keep me safe, why should I?<br>  <br>  The best option I would suggest would be to take them to be professionally evaluated and possibly committed to a psychological hospital where there are Dr.s there that specialize in the treatment of these kinds of trauma and issues. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps|`|DsEEATKSaa	Antisocial Personality Disorder and Borderline Personality Disorder are both strong possibilities.<br>  <br>  ~Dr. B.~|`|jp9OzuXoaa	Depression?<br>  <br>  Maybe Asperger's Syndrome?
UjIqkYmuaa	the dream don't mean your going to have a baby at an early age<br>  the baby is just a metaphor for your heart because it is fragile and easy to break,just like a baby and you were struggling with the (baby/your heart)because you are struggling with your emotions over witch boy you like,or really want to be with that is why you didn't know who the father was because you don't know who your heart belongs to.the group of guys playing with the baby ruff indicates that that is what you think will happen if you date either of them that these boys might play with your heart.and you weren't sure if you were babysitting or not is because you  deep down inside you are not sure if you are ready for the intensity of the feelings you are having.and there for don't want to own up to them.i hope this helps :)|`|jHmepKRMaa	Sounds like your subconscious.

Sometimes you find the answer in your dream.<br>  <br>  Dreams come from what you're thinking about or worrying about.

I bet if you think about it, you can identify the images in your dream and figure out where they came from.  You'll see that it's just a bunch of random stuff from your day.
1d87d68d27feaf630ac18e418360ae11aa	Absolutely not! I feel just the opposite, you are willing to do something for yourself in order to feel better, solve a particular problem and not give up. Giving up would mean that you refuse to seek any help or advise. Counseling is a very useful tool in dealing with changes in your life, crises situations you may be dealing with, relationship problems, anxiety, death, self confidence, and the list goes on. It is nothing to be ashamed of yet it's also no one elses business. I consider myself to be a very strong person, yet at times we all go through things that seem overwhelming and asking for help is something to feel good about. It's definitely not giving up! Good luck.|`|rhTCejrtaa	Getting help is not giving up. If you are unable to do it yourself its not because your weak, its because it is hard. It is a big hit to your pride to think that way, so why do it? Stop thinking of yourself as a failure because your not, you owned up and your now trying to fix things. There is nothing weak about that.|`|2TavF36Daa	Seeking and receiving counseling is NOT GIVING UP.<br>  <br>  It is grasping a helping hand up.<br>  <br>  Someday, you maybe able to do the same for someone else.<br>  <br>  BTW.

Self destruction is the worse thing your friends and family could ever watch you experience.<br>  <br>  <br>  Much Love!|`|R6IYY4miaa	I do not think of it as giving up or giving in. Giving in to what exactly? You're reaching out because you want to help yourself. Counseling is a TON of work, and you really have to dedicated to it, and do a lot of work on yourself which is difficult, and takes a lot of guts to do. Few people examine themselves honestly, and then try to make choices that are good for them, even if it seems to go against what comes naturally. You have made a choice to take care of yourself, the same way people who decide to work out or eat healthy or take medications/vitamins have decided to do things that were good for themselves. It's mental health- implying the need to behave in ways and make choices that keep you in good health, and you're doing that so good for you!|`|dlTJQL5Laa	No way!  I think educated people--doctors, teachers, etc--and especially people in the helping professions, might actually be a little bit more likely to get counseling.|`|jp9OzuXoaa	I personally see it as giving up (or more so like being weak) if *I* personally am going to counseling. If others are going to counseling though, I don't see it as if they're "giving up". But I am hard on myself and I feel like if I really need to go to counseling then I must be pretty pathetic for not being able to deal with my problems without the help of a professional.|`|e50e6ca9411acd39c8aec91e4abe2b89aa	No, I see counseling as a way to gain assistance in resolving issues. It shows great strength, first in the realization that you have something you desire to change and second the courage to do it. Good luck. The great thing about counseling is it is confidential and you do not have to share it with anyone and no one needs to know.|`|gC8xO53Oaa	Not at all! It takes strength and courage to recognize it's ok to seek advice from a counselor. It's a sign of weakness when we turn our backs on reaching out because of the stigma that may come from it. I admire and respect you for taking the step you feel you need.|`|zZY3JX30aa	No, it isn't giving up. It is, if nothing else, a mature way to seek self- improvement and validation.
CXzrP40qaa	So, this is based off of the theory that the mind is separate from the brain:<br>  <br>  Dreams are your mind's way of letting you know your wants, and needs.  Which is why dreams are so important to some cultures.  I am not saying that you want, or need the feeling of someone holding your hand, but it could very well be along those lines...<br>  <br>  As for the actual sensation...<br>  <br>  As we develop, we store most everything into our memory.  So as you are dreaming, and your mind is telling you a story, or something that you may desire, it is actually telling your brain to feel sensations and emotions.<br>  <br>  You have to think about how it made you feel to be holding this person's hand.  And depending on how you feel, you may be able to interpret it better.  <br>  <br>  Hope all is well =)|`|rhTCejrtaa	Your brain can do funny things can't it? that's cool, kind of like when your just about to fall asleep and you fall all the sudden and you feel like your falling but you didn't obviously.<br>  i know i didn't answer your question sorry :P|`|3E9plH9Iaa	Dreams can be quite vivid.. When we dream it is called The Rem State of Sleep.. At this time we dream..What a lot of people don't know or realize,,is the fact that shortly before we awaken,,the dream cycle and the coordination of sleep is the deepest..Meaning,,you are at the soundest time of sleep approximately one half hour before you awaken..So,,in your state of sleep,,you could actually go in and out of deep sleep,,and leave and go back to your dream !!  Its hard to think of but its like having a interruption in your sleep,,but not enough to awaken you totally.. And as far as the reality of the dream,,sometimes you will awake and be sweating or excited,,or even exhausted from a dream.. They CAN be that intense.. But I wouldn't worry,, usually,,what one encounters in a dream is ONLY a dream.. Pleasant Dreams !!  SOLOMON|`|AA10952792	The REM sleep state is the state where you actively dream. The sleep cycle is such that the REM stage is near the waking stage. the brainwaves are very similar, and when we wake, we are usually emerging from REM sleep. Dreams are just our memories being sparked by brain activity. which is why they usually don't make a lot of sense. And they are usually visual and auditory, but at times dreams can bring up memories of all of the senses, including touch. and the reason you felt like you were still holding the hand is because the REM stage is so close to the waking stage. which is why sometimes, your alarm clock can be incorporated into your dream. crazy huh.
e2DEQ6Euaa	Most people babble nonsense when their drunk because they can't process anymore. There is probably some measure of truth to that, but to what degree is hard to tell. Like she could love you as a friend, and she may have discussed with her friends that you look hot, but maybe she does not want to be in anything serious. As a general rule, try not to bother about anything a drunk person says.

They also strongly encourge a decrease is waste, and continuous improvement.  They also developed the lean production facility.<br>  <br>  For examples of how the Japanese model has been utilized in business look into Toyota.<br>  <br>  It has been termed the Japanese model because they were the trailblazers.  Western companies are lagged, we have studied the Japanese way and have now implemented it into American companies.  Japan was the founder.

That you think you could do better than you already are - by not giving up - if you can see a therapist. They don't have to think you have problems, all they have to focus on is how honest your being. I know you won't tell them the exact same stuff you have told us, but just tell in short, that you would appreciate if you can see a councellor without them thinking there is something wrong, explain that you need someone to listen that's all. And btw theres patient confidentiality - I hope there is no offence by the word patient not intended- which means noone can know your seeing a therapist. Hope it all works out for you.

I really need to go see one and I know that but, money is tight here so I don't let my parents see it anymore. <br>  The best thing for you would to just see a therapist, even for the little stuff. Cause like my parents told me you might hurt someone else or yourself. So don't let that happen. Take action! Get help! Let people know, if your still to embarrassed then find a way to vent let it all out. Write it down then shred the paper and the crappy feelings that you had when writing it.|`|AA10984198	One way is to put it to your parents in a completely different way, so they don't have to accept or reject the idea.<br>  <br>  Tell about how someone you know had problems and their life wasn't that good and they went to see a psychologist, who taught a whole range of techniques to improve their life and their life is great.<br>  <br>  Then your parents can say make the suggestion to you to go, rather than you ask them.|`|5LR1RZelaa	If you're in high school or college, tell them you are trying to figure out what kind of a career you'd like and you'd like to sit down and talk with a counselor about it to be confident in your decisions.|`|qL3dGTXDaa	Tell your parents that you would like to get some "coaching" around some issues you grapple with.|`|lpR9XLYbaa	I know exactly what you mean. I didn't have those issues, but when my mammaw died when I was 15, I was sooo lonely. I had nobody to talk to about it, and I wanted to see a therapist, but I just couldn't talk to my parents about it. Well, it took me about a year to come to terms with her death. I never did see a counselor, but I always really wanted to.<br>  <br>  Now, i'm 19 and in college. I don't know if you are or not, but if you're in college, you can see a certified counselor(not psychology students using you as a guinea pig, but an actual counselor) for free. It's included in tuition. I found out about it my soph year(last semester), and 3 weeks ago, I went for the first time. I told my friends and family it was for academic reasons. I said I was having trouble studying, and I wanted to see if a counselor could help me. The first 2 meetings, all we talked about was why I was a procrastinator and didn't study. But on this past Tuesday, my 3rd meeting, I began to open up more and talk about some family issues i've had for years.<br>  <br>  I have to say, it is so worth it to go. I tend to think I know everything, but she(my counselor) has already opened my eyes and made me think about reasons why I am the way I am. It makes me feel good to get it out, and there are ways you can be helped to.<br>  <br>  I'm not sure what you're family situation is, but if you can find any way to get to a therapist, I highly suggest you do. I know many large churches offer professional counselors, usually at a price. Insurance helps pay though. Maybe you can go to a church and just explain your situation, and I bet they can help you or at least put you in the right direction.<br>  <br>  Good luck. I hope you can find a way to work it out. You will feel so much better when you do.<br>  =)|`|ypJ7RctMaa	don't worry i was embarassed too when i started to see a therapist, but they never tell any one not even your parents, so you don't have to be worried, think of it like getting a shot, you don't want to do it, but after your done it makes you feel better|`|67Lvls2zaa	I have the same problem. Try keeping a diary and thinking about why you might have an issue. Act as your own therapist until you figure out what to do. If you have a strong relationship with your parents, plan how you're going to tell them and go over it in your head. Try to find a way to keep yourself from thinking negatively and keep your expectations on medium ground. I find yoga helpful and I also like to look up some of my problems to find out more about them. If/when you tell your parents, make sure you and they are in a calm mood and atmosphere. Going to a therapist isn't always necessary, either. It's possible that your parents can help you, or you may be able to cope with it yourself. See what your parents say first.
e2DEQ6Euaa	Oh definitely make up, lip stick, eyeliner. She'll try to pose in an amateurish slutty way. Ear rings and necklaces.
lBH8j3mTaa	It sounds like you should be fine. I was very shy in high school and came out of my shell around 12th grade. If you have stuff in common with the other group it should be fine. Having a common ground about something makes breaking the ice much easier. <br>  <br>  Even if you didnt have much in common thats what makes groups of people interesting, because you get to know each other and can teach each other new things or get interested in something you have never done before.<br>  <br>  Just be a relaxed and think about what the other people are saying and say whats comes natural. Sounds like you are pretty nervous about this whole venture so the main thing would be just to relax. They have nothing to lose by being your friend so relax and go for it, you will be fine. I am sure you have hobbies and interests that are interesting to them. If you are all getting ready to finish high school a good ice breaking topic would be what everyone is doing after high school.. college? military? work? travel?<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|mZXZaJbEaa	1. Express your interests and listen to theirs<br>  2. Don't worry about them accepting you- it sounds like they already have<br>  3. Also, you should email that girl and keep in touch<br>  <br>  good luck man!|`|tSwCd5kvaa	Don't force yourself, but it's a great idea to progress. The sooner, the better. You need to feel more confident, and that you can trust your friends more. If they allow you to be near then, I guess that's part acceptance. So there would be no problems with them accepting you. Didn't you say that they were nice to you? If they aren't, then that's a conspicuous signal of saying 'no' to you. In this case, your accepted but you do not have enough confidence or support.|`|hfGE5jieaa	Aw, that's so cute.|`|596ba0725523b654ae88f9a7d31dae51aa	You have to force yourself to be outgoing. You have to act as if you are outgoing. forced yourself to talk to people. Ask them questions. Especially about themselves, what they like, etc. People love to talk about themselves. <br>  The key though, is to literally be an actor. Play the role of outgoing and confident dude-- confidence is the key. Do this for a while, and it will start to be true. You'll learn to be confident and more outgoing.<br>  As for the chick, you should try asking her out. You might be in the friend zone already, but it's worth a shot.|`|CVM4sZv2aa	actually buddy as far as friendship is concerned you can make me your friend. but as your shyness is concerned on that you need to be a bit more practical. everyone when comes to this world is shy person so everyone overcomes his shyness. <br>  as far as your girlfriend is concerned on that i would say that you are in love with her. so you better tell her. because time doesn't stops for anyone. best wishes to you........................................<br>   take care|`|JZ8rkTykaa	Build up confidence.<br>  Love yourself that way Even if people hate on you, it wont matter.<br>  & Please answer my question :) <br>  <a href="http://ca.answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=ApNoFa85gddyg8IYxpvGyfTAFQx.;_ylv=3?qid=20090306210009AAmmQJT">http://ca.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a>|`|6oCqwfQpaa	My advice is go online and do a little research about introverts. One very interesting thing about introverts is that they gain energy when they are alone, and lose energy when they are in social situations. They can operate on the extrovert end of the spectrum for a while, but they need to get away to recharge. Extroverts are the opposite. They lose energy when they are alone. For that reason, introverts are the ones that can focus on a task more, analyze things in more detail, and often create some of the most amazing things. If it weren't for introverts, we would not have cellphones, computers, cars, modern medicine, etc. Personally I think extroverts are to be pitied. They only seem more well balanced but most of those I know lead meaningless lives with no understanding of what it means to be authentic.|`|DjAKQrtraa	The secret to being social is to just do stuff and say stuff in public and not care about what others think. Shy people tend to be more perceptive and circumspect because maybe they have a better appreciation of all that can go wrong than the normal social butterfly who is usually totally oblivious. I was like you once but I became more social after I stopped caring about how others perceived me and how I perceived myself. I do little things that I regret more often now, but I don't have the BIG regret of no friends. You should also ask yourself if you are a judgmental person who holds people, including yourself, to higher standards than is necessary. If so, you should chill out.|`|ORiXdGzNaa	well i know how u feel, i didnt have friends till i was in 10th grade, i was really insecure and had an extremely low self esteem especially since my cousin was always more popular and in the same class. In the end i felt inferior to her and everyone else. Im also very quiet when i dont know someone. I looked for friends but kept finding people that acted like friends in the beginning then i found out they were completely different from me. At half of my 10th grade year I basically gave up and just hanged out with those people so i just would not look like a total loner but i would not speak to them. Then someone really close to me told me that i needed to stop looking and that they would come to me. I didnt believe her till i found the 2% of people that where like me.Who would have thought they where the group of people that sat next to me in lunch. At first i was kinda nervous but little by little i started to talk to them.I was afraid they would not accept me so i lied a little and hid stuff from them, but as we got closer i learned that they would not care what i liked and disliked so i told them everything. From that point everything went up hill, i got more friends, happier, my self esteem went up and i felt more secure.So what im trying to tell you is that you should see how well it goes for you, if they are not the ones you still have collage. I recommend you try to become there friends, you dont have to talk much and dont worry about not being accepted, if they dont accept you for who you are they where never your friends, I had to learn that the hard way. good luck and i hope it goes well for you.|`|TW03vN6Xaa	Honey just be yourself that what matters. Try taking a step forward and make plans. Email your close friend ask how she is doing. Break your shell. I was the same way and had a lot of let downs but you have to get past it. I have a quote "you only burn that bridge if you are holding the match"<br>  <br>  You are in control of your life and who is in it and who is not. Get involved in conversations and activities of your same interests. I was very shy and after i just break that barrier and out myself out there i met ALOT of people, You do get let down and some rejections in life but also in return you get close friendships and special unique bonds with certain groups and people. I have sets of friends i hang with other i go out with other i can really talk to.<br>  <br>  Hell im 30 i Just went on a date with a total stranger and damn i was nervous and thought i would mess it up BUT i took the initiative and went out and had a REALLY good time (and second date planned!)<br>  <br>  I met people I never saw again also. But i have awesome friendships and acquaintances that last a life time. I bet you are a GREAT person with a lot of talents and smarts! and sensitive people like you listen. Tune in to your peers and make the most of it! You only live once and taking chances is a big part of life!!!!!! Best of luck to you!!!!!!!|`|YZioqlSCaa	just be yourself to them.<br>  but you cant be worried constantly about what they will think of you.<br>  cause that's just going to make you scared to open up to them.i had a problem (that is resolved now) but all my friend told every one every secret detail of my life. i was afraid to open up to anybody after that because i thought they would do the same. but then i realized that i had to stop caring what people thought about me. i know that is hard for some people, and im not telling to not care. im just saying that you cant worry every second of your life of what people think. <br>  all i can tell you is... be yourself and if they like your true self they'll accept you. just don't mold yourself to be like them because i know what that's like and its not fun.<br>  i hope they accept you for who you are and you actually meet some nice people.:]|`|rhrrWwL2aa	if you are shy maybe loosen up try to act more out there put a smile on your face, well try i was shy one but once i realized that there were people who wanted to be my friend as wellmaybee a little courage and attitude will help.

I4bhu71qaa	I don't think so. All we need is to eliminate the three human sins of greed, selfishness, and fear of loss the individual possessions. We can recall how much those top executives' failures with vast rewards in the known financial institutions. Country Wide, AIG, Lehman Brothers, Fannie Mai and Freddie Mac. <br>  I am glad to know that Joseph Yam is going to step down soon with his vast rewards of HK $10.3 millions in 2007 to match his total failure of making Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) with a vast loss of HK $1008 billions in 2007. You can refer to the published following article in London's news paper.<br>  <br>  It is published in Daily Mail, dated March 3, 2009, page 6.<br>  Head lines of Truth about Fred Goodwin. PM’s anger as doubt is cast on banker’s defense of 700,000 pounds pension per year…………………….Sir Fred’s argument that he should get the lot despite the public outcry at such vast rewards for failure.<br>  Pledge by MP, Harriet Harman. This is in regard with the highest-paid bankers at HSBC received 32.4 million British pounds in bonus last year, despite profits plunging by more than 60%.<br>  You can get the general ideas of why the financial critics keep on criticizing the American bosses are overpaid in the following article.<br>  <a href="http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/1988/11/07/71241/index.htm" rel="nofollow">http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/f...</a><br>  I think the ultimate goal of Obama should do the followings.<br>  1) Destroy the global stock markets gradually and completely. Simply speaking, it is better to see Dow Jones Index will decline to 4,000 points in the near future. It is necessarly to maintain its daily flutuation of +/- not exceed 10 points with annual +/- not exceed the margin of 300 points for at least 10 consecitive years. If so, the US economy will be stablized in the next ten years. As the economic locomotive, the US will lead the global economics stable and good.<br>  2) Upon the completion of destroying the greedy stock market investors, Obama should try to intervene the heavy real estate transactions as it happened in the US, UK, and HK.<br>  3) Obama try introduce harder policy over the current executive cap of lowering the executive salaries and bonus in all US financial institutions. Hong Kong must introduce the new laws to rent control, cut the overall overpaid civil servants' salaries ranging from 6% to 60%, depending on how much the individual's overpaid in comparison to the international standards.<br>  I think both US and Hong Kong should learn how to live for less. Otherwise, Hong Kong and US will lead to a doomsday in the next five years. Obviously, the major problem of Hong Kong is the overall overpaid civil servants have sucked up all tax dollars, and the top officials and top ranking civil servants have ruined Hong Kong directly. They all needed to be adjusted and probably eliminated. The contemporary US problems are high unemployment plus overpaid and too rich bonus for the executives.

In other words, they could cure Downs Syndrome, Huntington's, etc. Anything else is completely superficial and doesn't benefit the human race.  Who are we to say that everyone should look like a model and have an IQ of 180? Genetic variation is the key to survival. We need to let nature do it's thing with superficial variations. <br>  <br>  Also, at some point it might become possible to make a child who's more compliant and easy to parent than a high-strung, argumentative child.

Should it become possible, then I think we as a society would need to have some serious discussions about the ethics of it all.|`|0nLdwZP2aa	They can't do it, at least not yet.  Mostly because we can't detemine which traits an offspring will have based on their genes, at least not for most of those things.  Stuff like diseases, that are caused by a single gene, are easy to screen for, but those kinds of traits are usually caused by multiple genes.<br>  <br>  Of course we will probably have the technology someday.  However, in its current form, all we can do is take lots of embryos and test them.  The more picky you get, the less likely it is that any one embryo will have all the traits you want.  So doing it by random chance may not be that effective either.<br>  <br>  Either way, we won't be able to actually do this for years yet.  And I hope in the intervening time, legislation to control unethical genetic work like this will be passed.  Now, testing for diseases, especially when both parents are known carriers, is a totally different concept, one I completely support - but It's really only a small step from controlling the traits of your child, to true eugenics.|`|9TeE1K3Eaa	It seems everyone thinks this would be so great and will eliminate all the defects and disabilities that could happen.

RvmYqQtRaa	1794 the steam locomotive(train) is invented by John Fitch. That was the same year that Eli Whitney invented the cotton gin. In 1805 the first steam powered Amphibious vehicle was invented by Oliver Evans who also invented refrigeration that year. However the first home use refrigerator wasn't build until 1834 by Jacob Perkins.

AA11565057	*hugs* I'm sorry to hear that you feel so awful.<br>  <br>  You know, there's a lot of research out there that showst hat when we are so constantly bombarded by images of people who look 'beautiful', we are more likely to have eating disorders and generally feel bad about our bodies. <br>  <br>  A lot of the people on facebook probably touch up their photos though in photoshop. I can make ME look like a model, and I'm anything but!<br>  <br>  To be honest, your body doesn't really matter all that much. It only matters whilst in high school or if you want to go out and sleep with lots of guys because out in the real world (especially at uni), most people don't give a crap about if you look like a model or not. <br>  <br>  I look around at all the beautiful people who had dates for the formal etcetc (I didn't, neither for year 11 nor year 12), who could have any guy they wanted in highschool, etcetc. Most of them have had kids by now and have a dead end job if anything. They didn't go to uni or better themselves because they thought they'd just get by from being pretty. <br>  <br>  It's never life events or circumstances that are an issue. It's how you respond to them, and I think that you might benefit from working on how you respond to things. You need to work on feeling better about yourself and not weighing your self worth by what size clothing you are, or if you feel that people hit on you, or if other people like you, or what you look like. Contingent self-worth is a bad thing and it's so important to develop a good sense of yourself and your own worth without these things.<br>  <br>  I highly recommend a program called moodGYM, which the AUstralian National University runs. It's online and it looks at changing how people react to life events to develop more resilience. Here: <a href="http://www.moodgym.anu.edu.au/welcome" rel="nofollow">http://www.moodgym.anu.edu.au/welcome</a><br>  <br>  I bet that if you showed me a photo of you, you wouldn't look nearly so ugly to me as you do to yourself. And I can't help but wonder what you'd think of me if you saw a photo of me. I'm fat (about 110-120kgs), wear glasses, and have a big triangle-shaped nose. Oh, and my hair is really fine and just sort of hangs there and gets all greasy at the scalp because it has no body. ANd it doesn't matter what I wear, I still look fat because I AM fat. I am extremely pale as well and look white compared to most people. When I do get darker at all, I don't tan. I freckle. My natural hair colour is a mousy brown (I keep it red with henna). Hmm. Yeah. And yet I'm happy with myself. So that tells me that the way I or anyone else looks doesn't have to matter. It only matters if you let it.|`|bcqS54bfaa	You should look at the way media blinds people into being a sertain way.

I percenly try to stay away from tv movies and the radio because it will brain wash you if you cant see their lies. So many hidden messages in the media. But if you realy fell you need to look a sertain way you can. All beauty is a little hard work, time and effort on the body.|`|5bdcd6fdade97ea18590869df8c0bcc0aa	Look at my 360 photo. It isn't pretty but that's the prettiest photo I've got of myself without meddling with the effects. I've got a crappy body and I've got glasses. I've never had a bf before, I'm only five feet two inches, but you know what? Beauty isn't the only way to get noticed.. Be nice to people and don't be moody all the time.. people will really like you..<br>  btw all the pretty girls  know are snobbish and mean, so be grateful you're not one of them, and learn to love your assets.. If you so badly want to look good, get a makeover.<br>  If maturity and niceness doesn't get you male attention, they're crappy males :)<br>  Cheer up and have a nice day|`|85Co7zE8aa	Wow that's hard. <br>  I want to say that I'm sure you're very pretty and stuff, but honestly if you don't think you're pretty you are probably right. We all know ourselves the best. <br>  That said, there's no way to be as pretty as the model shots. For one thing they have an entire team getting them makeup and clothes. They also have a team of computer engineers who spend their day fixing celebrity's faces, touching up blemishes, even for the supposed raw magazine photos in People. Jennifer Anniston was on US Weekly recently. She looked really pretty but I know the photo was altered because she  had no stretch marks (you could see her stomach). <br>  My point is that we spend so much time obsessing about what we don't look like, when really we should be working with what we do have.

ndSzlZKxaa	Hi?<br>  There is a software called dreams mainfestation kit.? Hope the below article will provide you with more info... <br>  ?<br>  Why are some people more successful than others in fulfilling their goals and  dreams? Isn’t it astonishing how some people fail all the time, while others  turn everything they touch into gold? <br>    Is it just dumb luck?  Does God rule over it?  Are some born with successful and predetermined genes?  How To Set Your Success Formula on Autopilot? <br>    Setting goals and  in your life is the single most  undertaking in the entire process of making the life you always dreamed about.

This is the reason why so many masses struggle and businesses fail.<br>   <br>   Tap Into the Infinite Power of Your subconscious mind <br>   <br>   Your subconscious processes about 400 billion bits of information per second and the impulses move at a speed of up to 100,000 mph! Equate this to your conscious mind, which processes only about 2,000 bits of information per second and its impulses move only at 100-150 mph.  Your conscious mind is almost a backward cousin of the subconscious mind.  I am sure you have experienced at some time or another driving you car, and for an instant during the drive, you suddenly became aware that you were driving. Prior to that sudden conscious jolt into the present moment, your conscious mind was busy with thinking and your subconscious mind drove the car – all on its own.<br>   <br>   You might have the firmest desire to achieve something, but as long as your subconscious holds a certain feeling that is not aligned with that desire, nothing will ever happen to manifest the desire.  This is the single most important fact you have to understand. You set your goals with your conscious mind and you reach them with your subconscious mind.The single most important thing to realize is that you set your goals with your conscious mind and you reach them with your subconscious mind.<br>   <br>   There is now a remarkably simple solution for manifesting your goals, dreams and desires in life.

We were just rebuilding our relationship so I trusted her vice versa.  But as soon as she deposited the money to my accnt.  I dreamt that night that cats attacked me in a familiar neighborhood and were clawing my flesh off...seriously I was scared as sh!t.  I returned the money the next day.  <br>  <br>  I've been careful ever since with her - had good reason too based on post dream events.
wNJetCLEaa	Ah yes, the monster inside.  This is probably a very dangerous amount of pent up emotional stress that's been bottled up inside you.  Well the trick is to find whatever it is that caused that stress and confront it.  I know I've been angry and flipped out on people before, but regretted it later because it was so random.  The trick is to talk to that person and confront them about it.  This way you are dealing with things on your own terms, and you can walk away from it if you have to.  Another trick to this is to have a third party present to help monitor the situation and keep things in line.

Hence, Profit=-$50. The firm is making a loss.<br>  <br>  (b) The first is not maximizing its economic profit. You can easily find the total cost function by using the quantities given for ATC, AVC, and total fixed costs. Then the rest is trivial.

Often because this was generally used by a man.<br>  <br>  Whereas, for whatever reason, calling a guy 'man' seems ot be simple a method of address.  It probably has a lot to do with the fact that this is generally used by one man addressing another, who (in historical times) was considered more his equal.<br>  <br>  I don't personally feel that 'woman' is super degrading, at least not any more - but this is kind of a societal issue in that the two words have historically been used in these different ways, and I understand if some women don't want to be addressed like that.|`|NnG8PxMzaa	When guys call each other "man" it's the male equivalent of girls calling each other, "honey" or "darling" or whatever.

AA11064298	In cutting the base rate to almost zero, the BoE hopes to encourage borrowing by companies and households, so that consumption and investment will rise.  This should have the effect of raising aggregate demand and therefore the level of economic activity, to offset the effects of the unwise-credit crisis that has brought banks to the point collapse.<br>  <br>  In principle, this process should not have any major effect on inflation because there are excess resources available to satisfy aggregate demand.  When economic activity starts to rise, the base rate will be raised accordingly and other anti-inflationary measures introduced.<br>  <br>  HOWEVER, this policy of cheap lending will not solve the underlying problem of inadequate aggregate demand because companies and households don't borrow just because loans are cheap.  Companies need to be sure that their investment and other expenditures will be met by raised demand for products and services.  Cheap money is not reassuring - if anything, it points to the crisis and reinforces it in the low expectations of industry.<br>  <br>  Likewise, households don't take out loans, no matter how cheap, when unemployment is rising and their expectations are of continuing difficulties.<br>  <br>  The only effective policy has been abandoned by USA and UK.  It is a large cut in personal and company taxes, so that households and industry have more disposable income and feel better off, not poorer.  Of course, governments will receive less in tax revenues and must borrow or print money to meet the needs of the pubic services.  But that is preferable to borrowing and printing money to bale out the banks (and individual bankers) who caused the problems in the first place with their desire to inflate their balance sheets with unwise debt.<br>  <br>  Don't hold your breath for the policy to change.  Under the influence of Professor Milton Friedman and others, monetary policy is now regarded as the most effective approach to current problems, and there is no indication that it will be abandoned no matter how it fails.  The mantra now is, "Cheap money good - tax cuts bad" and not a single politician seems to have learned from the lessons of history.|`|K2d51gwOaa	They are encouraging economic activity that usually causes inflation to increase.<br>  <br>  The BOE allows financial institutions to borrow money from it to lend to others.

WHO SAYS SO?<br>  <br>  "How to gain, how to keep, and how to recover happiness is in fact for most men at all times the secret motive for all they do."<br>  William James (one of the most prominent psychologists-- graduated Harvard Medical School) <br>  <br>  "Happiness is the meaning and the purpose of life, the whole aim and end of human existence."<br>  Aristotle (Aristotle is one of the most important founding figures in Western philosophy.) <br>  <br>  "Happiness, though an indefinite concept, is the goal of all rational beings."<br>  Immanuel Kant (philosopher, Wikipedia says "He is regarded as one of the most influential thinkers of modern Europe and of the late Enlightenment.") <br>  <br>  "It appeared to me obvious that the happiness of mankind should be the aim of all action, and I discovered to my surprise that there were those who thought otherwise."<br>  Bertrand Russell (Wikipedia says "Russell was an influential philosopher and mathematician." His books "have had a considerable influence on logic, mathematics, set theory, linguistics and analytic philosophy.") <br>  <br>  "All men seek happiness. This is without exception. Whatever different means they employ, they all tend to this end. The cause of some going to war, and of others avoiding it, is the same desire in both, attended with different views. This is the motive of every action of every man, even of those who hang themselves."<br>  Blaise Pascal (He was a brilliant French mathematician, physicist and religious philosopher.) <br>  <br>  "Pleasure is the object, duty and the goal of all rational creatures."<br>  Voltaire (He was a French Enlightenment writer, essayist, and philosopher known for his wit, philosophical sport, and defense of civil liberties, including freedom of religion and free trade.

pl6eDKQbaa	I agree with the above post. Its a face statement, a band aid solution. It offers no clarity as to what is being suggested. Responsible in terms of who? American soldiers? The American public? The Allies? The Iraqi people? Ending? What pulling out? Putting MORE troops in to kill off the last of the insurgents? What does that statement mean? I mean seriously think about it its entirely null and void once you think about it as more than a face statement. If I was a voter I would want to know what the plans were BEFORE I voted for that statement. That is no way enough to influence my voting choice. Which fyi is neutral.

AHJZeo8Oaa	Structural theories of feminism are socialist feminism, marxist feminist and radical feminism - ie, most of them.  A structural theory is one that says people have particular life experiences / treatment on account of their position in society.  So structural feminism would be the idea that women are disadvantaged in society on the basis of being women.<br>  <br>  Post structuralism / postmodernism is the theory that these big, grand, over-arching theories of society (Grand Narratives) are outdated, and fail to explain the complexity and subjectivity of the human experience.  Whereas before people strongly alinged on the basis of group loyalty (ie, working class trade unions) postmodernists say that these traditional collective groups are in decline and that we are all becoming more individualistic, less tied to family, community, etc.<br>  <br>  The problem that this refers to what critiques of feminism have called the 'false universal' of women - ie, the idea that women share a collective experience - marriage, motherhood etc.  As more and more women fail to follow the traditonal paths, the whole idea of what it 'means' to be a women becomes challenged.  And if there are no common features of being a woman, there is no common basis for action, or structural theories of feminism.<br>  <br>  On this basis, there are really only 2 directions that feminism can take - either it fragments into post-modernist feminism (all viewpoints are valid, all types of feminism are valid, no theory is more 'right' than any other as they all represent different viewpoints)<br>  <br>  Or, it can simply fall back on traditional liberal feminist policies.  Liberalism highlights the individual, equal rights, self-determination, agency (rather than structure) etc.<br>  <br>  As for the effect of theory within the feminist movement.  Early women's rights (sufragette) campaigns used a lot of liberal political theory, but theory itself did not come to play a big part until the later stages of 2nd wave feminism, when women's studies began to be established in universities, and feminist critiques began to be studied by sociologists  :-)|`|nPHCPX1Xaa	it encourages feminists to just continue to spend 99% of their miserable lives on their backs|`|nLd4mF4Jaa	Please ask you questions in normal English not arty-crafty gobbledegook.|`|ZjCurM7saa	Both were an invention by the same types of people who support feminism as a way of backing their convoluted arguments into the mainstream.

Well, that is covered under a subject called ethics.  That means there is a some thought about being for it or against it.  There are people who have pushed for rights to choose death.

There is virtually no actual support for his direct interactions and apostleship other than his own. A look at the contents of the new testament suggests a clear variation of focus between what the NT that is not Paul or one of his followers and the focus of What Jesus said in the gospels. This leads me to believe that much of the great amount of Christian antics leading to wars, prejudice, suppression of women, and so on attributed to Christianity is really the act of and the result of the opinions expressed by Paul and his direct followers. The results as such are probably that in part to the writings of Paul et al. millions have been killed,enslaved and so on and those things continue today and will continue across the foreseeable future thus the number of people harmed is still multiplying and will continue to harm indefinitely.|`|T8ksKCWCaa	Vlad the impaler was not a very nice guy.|`|myjB1nWGaa	It is Adolf Hitler because of his wanton, cruel slaughter of millions of innocent people during WWII.
