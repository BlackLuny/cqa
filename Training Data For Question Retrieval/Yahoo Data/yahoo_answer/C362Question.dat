20090202194124AA7LGwS	Home & Garden;Decorating & Remodeling	How can I get paint off trim without ruining the trim?	My husband and I bought his mothers house and we want to repaint the house. Unfortunately the nice dark trim has been painted over with white paint and we would like to get the dark trim back, i'm afraid that we would ruin the trim if we try scraping the white paint off. Is there anything that we can use that would get the paint off? I really don't want to have to buy new trim or try painting it dark brown, it just wouldn't look that nice if it was painted.   (the type of paint is unknown) Thanks for your help!

I need to know of inexpensive and easy-to-maintain flowers that will survive from now through the heat and humidity of summer. I'm not sure if there are flowers that will grow year-round, but if there are, those are what I'm looking for. I'd prefer purple or yellow flowers, but if the perfect flower is a different color, I wouldn't mind. Also, I need to buy the flowers already grown (not the seeds) so that they are ready to plant in mid-March. Thanks in advance for your suggestions.

If not a slipped footer, then the concrete in the basement has settled, causing a sloping in the floor of the house. How are these problems generally dealt with? Is it possible to take care of it yourself?? Please don't tell me to call a specialist, I know that, but before I do that, I wanted to educate myself :) Thanks
