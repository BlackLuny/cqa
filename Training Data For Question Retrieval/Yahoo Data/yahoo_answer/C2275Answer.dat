AA11691363	Definitely... and it's a plug-and-play solution!    You need to get a hold of a "Video to VGA" converter like the ones on this page: http://www.ramelectronics.net/html/video...    If your video game console has a single Yellow RCA plug, all you need is something that can convert composite video into a VGA signal that your monitor will undertand  http://www.ramelectronics.net/html/video...  At $89, I think this is probably all you're looking for :-)    If your console has component video (3 RCA cables Green, Blue, and Red) you'll need to convert component video to VGA.  http://www.ramelectronics.net/html/kd-ct...    If your monitor only has DVI inputs, make sure that it can accept an analog DVI signal. If it can, then hop on over to RadioShack, and buy a VGA-DVI converter plug to connect one of the above units to your DVI monitor.|`|0557995d235d222e1b3f2ae7b8b30933aa	yep its easy just solder a usb connect onto one of ya controllers and then run that into your computer   alternatively just plug a usb from ur computer in to the back of ur comp     u mite need to chip it tho|`|1418a86523847b8907a55e04fa564c54aa	Well, I know that the PS2 has some kind of cord... but it only works with some games...

AA12245771	You need to work with wholesalers if you want to offer your cards at a reasonable price and make a profit. It doesn't make sense to buy everything at retail. If you don't know how to get started with that, then just look through a scrapbook or card-making or rubber stamp magazine and contact the company's whose products you like. Many of them will have wholesaler info on their websites or tell you what their requirements are over the phone. You might be surprised at how easy it can be with some vendors to buy at wholesale. And check out direct sales companies - most have high minimums to remain active and some restrict the use of their products in items for resale like your cards. The one I buy from has a super low min and let's you do whatever you want with their stuff so I know that it can be done.<br>  Good luck!|`|f10ebdaf0188ca166507aae70c628222aa	well i think the scrapbooking embelishments very nice, but you need to write to the maker if you want them in whole sale lots, other places i dont know about, if they are from the uk you can deal with them too, but the postage will bite. i doubt that a card making business will go over all that well since so many people are doing it themselves now, as it branched out from the scrapbooking business.|`|251812c2e4d04bce37192f62b336be4baa	I get all my card making supplies from scrapbook/rubber stamping stores.

2073fea75c39fb570e193f273692481baa	A lot of people have been having issues with their 360, especially the earlier units.  Occasional freezing up, corrupted startup screens, overheating, etc.  Dead Rising has been connected to a lot of these breakdowns, but it might just be that Dead Rising is an insanely popular game and because of that, more people are bound to run into hardware issues while playing it.    If your problems continue to get worse and you're still under warranty, call up the 360 tech support line, tell them what's happening and ask them for a replacement unit.  Specify that you want a new unit, not a refurbished one.    If you're not under warranty, I've seen some do-it-yourself solutions online that have varying degrees of suceess.  I wouldn't try any of those unless the system totally stops working and you're absolutely sure your 360 is no longer under warranty and that Microsoft is not going to help you out.    For now, just keep an eye on your 360 during play and see how it performs.  To minimize the risk of overheating, don't play for extended periods of time without breaks (around an hour and a half to two hours max is a good idea).|`|34eafd20c7a96662d68c9c1920c9bf94aa	Occasionally it freezes or if you have it up instead of lying down it could scratch if even the slightest thing makes it move on accident.

The biggest improvement in this game over the others is that there is so much more destructiveness to the game.

The gameplay is awesome, it's waaay more popular than 2k8 (more tournaments, more people online probably..im just geussing on that one) the graphics are gonna be good on Madden just like on 2k8, its 2007 what game isnt going to have good graphics? Vince Young is going to be awesome! haha. I just prefer madden because it's the actual players-I don't like the made up player thing. There's a reason why Madden's been around for so long, it's simply the best football game out right now.

There was a pirate title for the Gameboy Color called Pokemon Diamond that caused a considerable stir online.  It was really just a title screen graphic hack and a poor translation of a Pokemon-style GBC game.    Now, of course, a real Pokemon Diamond is coming out.

Cualquiera que lo ha jugado recuerda mas a Zephiroth que al chavillo con el que jugabas. Peeeeero, Zelda siempre Miyamoto saca al ni?o que llevas dentro y aunque la historia no era tan enganchante como la de FF7, te hacia sentirte que eras Zelda realmente, un ni?o que no sabe nada de ese lugar Hyrule y que lo vas descubriendo de a poco, poco.

TfxGL1luaa	There are several different entrances to this room.  Each entrance brings you to a different wall.  Look for them in the Lotus Forest up in the trees along the walls and in the tree (you have to feed one of the flowers a potion and it makes you big, hit the tree with your sword and it turns.  Then stomp on the tree stump, and eat the acorn to be small again.  Climb the limbs up to another entrance in the tree.<br>  <br>  The actual Upside Down room is when you're standing on the Bizarre Room ceiling.  The entrance to this is the house at the tea party.<br>  <br>  I think there's also an entrance in the Queen's throne room up on top of the bushes where the save is.<br>  <br>  Check out this walk through.

2073fea75c39fb570e193f273692481baa	You'll need to either burn the disc image to a disc to get it to play, or download a program that lets you use virtual drives.  A virtual drive allows you to mount disc images to a false drive, just as if you had put the game disc into your computer.    The program I use is Daemon Tools, which you can get here: http://www.daemon-tools.cc/    After you install the program (you'll have to reboot) and set everything up during the installation, it should show up as an icon in the bottom right-hand corner of your screen.  Right click on the icon and choose to Mount Disc Image.  Then find the Sims 2 ISO file, choose that, and the program should autorun and start the Sims 2 installation.    If the autorun doesn't kick in, go to My Computer and double click on the new drive, which should show the Sims 2 disc as being mounted.  If it still doesn't autorun, explore the Sims 2 disc and look for the installation exe file.

This card makes your Quarterback have 100% accuracy for one half.    Mistake Free card   Enter XL7SP1 as a code to get the Mistake Free card. This card makes it impossible for you to throw an interception or fumble the ball for one half.    Lame Duck card   Enter 5LAWO0 as a code to get the Lame Duck card. This card forces your opponent to throw nothing but lob passes for one half, which allows the defense more time to react to the ball, and leads to more deflections and interceptions.    Easy Madden Tokens   Use the following trick to get easy Madden Tokens in Two Minute Drill mode. Go to the roster of the team you are going to use and raise their stats so that their entire offensive line, fullback, and halfback are very good. Then, decrease the speed and awareness for the defensive players on the team you are going to play against. Next, go to Two Minute Drill mode and set the difficulty to All-Madden. If you plan to run against the defense, try a HB Toss to run on the outside. If you pass, throw Hail Marys the entire time. Your receivers that are good should beat the defensive backs, especially if you make them very tall and skinny.

The main character might be Carlos Olivera from RE3, and it appears the zombies are back, but they can run.  That's about it.

You'll have to perform a task for Azura before you'll be rewarded with the Star.    Once you have it, be careful with it.  There's only one in the game.  If you're going to use it to trap a soul, I would keep it in store for Dagoth-Ur himself.

b6c1bf5f7fe8df983fe2413ffa3a18d1aa	It would seem that the price of the 360 would go on sale in the near future. For a few reason's, it's been months since the release and its the holiday season coming up so they need to market more of these than ever.|`|59dd90be79e9396c3851ecd4bc8a37f2aa	Not likely.  The Xbox 360 is coming out with an add-on for blue-ray disc technology.  Purchasing both will cost roughly the same as a PS3 unfortunately.    Furthermore, Microsoft is launching some very nice titles right before the PS3 launchdate.    Sony's biggest opportunity is just how many PS3s they can release at the launchdate.  They will likely not launch as many as they would have hoped.    I am seeing the Xbox 360 (both versions, current core and hard) in Wla*Marts just waiting to be purchased.  Customers are shopping for these.  The sales will pick up in November with the holiday shopping frenzy because parents make promises to their children so they will have to buy a game system, just not necessarily what the children want.  Those 360s will get picked up.    There is a widely accepted study in the toy, and now video game industry.  To whit, parents make all sorts of promises to purchase this or that for their children.  Even when the holiday shopping season is over, parents still feel obliged to fulfill those promises or the pressure they felt when they tell their children "We'll see..."  It will likely be many months if not a year or two before any company feels overwhelming pressure from th competition to move their merchandise off the store shelves.|`|e2c64ffab7b4249548cef2c93b3b7321aa	Its possible but I think they will hold firm on thier price for a little longer.I mean come on ps3 and wii are coming out .So it wont cost the most and it wont be the cheapest.|`|2073fea75c39fb570e193f273692481baa	Not before Christmas.  If there's any place where a price drop might be justified it would be in Japan, where the original Xbox and the 360 have sold very poorly so far; instead Microsoft is planning a new 360 bundle with a pack-in game (Blue Dragon) to counter the PS3 launch in Japan.  If they won't drop the price there, where Microsoft is struggling to gain a foothold in the console market, they certainly won't drop it here, where the Xbox name already carries a lot of weight.    Factor in also that the 360 is getting a lot of really attractive titles soon and that the PS3, regardless of what games it launches with (and for the record, most of them are multiplatform), will be almost impossible to get your hands on for a while.  Considering all this, I think it will be a while before we see a price drop on the 360.  We probably will see a similar bundle deal.  I could be wrong, of course.|`|AA11148084	lol

0d9157979790a455b16d5bbc00e0cf38aa	SH 2 is considered to be the best of the series. SH1 got it started, but SH2 polished everything beautifully. SH3 and 4 have taken the gameplay to slightly new places, but the second is DEFINITELY the way to go.      I would caution you against playing Silent Hill 4:The Room first. It actually started out as an unrelated game, and halfway through it's devlopment, they slapped the Silent Hill theme on the game and it plays pretty differently. If you begin with SH4, you will play a game that many SH fans view as the ugly step-child, and it won't give you an exceptionally accurate representation of the series.|`|c0afdec205b2b503abcfbc9c2103dcf9aa	well i have all 4 but the first one i started with was SH 2 and this one is probly the cheapest to buy and if you get and can complete it then you you will have no trouble playing SH 1|`|2311f14503d5161a9b71c3a543ad323aaa	No matter which game you start of with you'll almost always be lost, so you might as well start with the first one|`|1d5ba321e6ad2d037a2234bc29dab153aa	Whatever you do, don't start out with SH4. It's by far the least interesting of the series.  It's one of those 'It's 3am but for some reason I can't sleep...Hmmm, guess I'll play a video game.' Kinda games.     My personal favorite is SH3...but that's mainly because of the soundtrack. It had GREAT music. I'm not really into game music, but when I got that game it came w/ a music CD and I still listen to it in my car.  But aside from the music I just thought it was very interesting.   You don't really HAVE to play any of the previous SH games to understand the latter ones...Just see the movie- It's got some similarities to SH1 SH2 and SH3. It will help you understand what Silent Hill really is, but if it doesnt you can always look that up on some fan site or maybe even the SH homepage.|`|a0154e79bc08776f43c052f5abe131b4aa	Def the 1st and go in that order, but SH 4: The Room was pretty much the embarassment game of the lot.

I see them around often.|`|310e921f6f0ef7f94a0f19ba975b7542aa	silent Hill 3  because the game had stong story against other silent Hills.  in fact the graphic of 3 is the best.  best wishes|`|2073fea75c39fb570e193f273692481baa	I would try to start with the original if at all possible.  A lot of stuff in 3 makes no sense if you haven't played 1, and there are lots of small things in 2 and 4 that reflect back to the events of 1.  It will be worth it if you can find a copy.    I would suggest playing them in order if you can.  Certainly don't play 3 before you're done with 1.    2 and 4 have stand-alone storylines that use the same setting as a backdrop, but you would still benefit from playing them in order.    And for the record, SH4 gets a bad rap but it's well worth playing despite the flaws.  SH2 is probably the best in terms of character and storylne.

He has also said the actor he would like to play snake.(forgot)    Search 'metal gear solid' in wikipedia and you should find out more.    'Rumors of films based on the Metal Gear series have frequently surfaced, although none has been publicly announced. In 2004, Hideo Kojima was quoted to have said that, "Things one can express in a game are different of those in a movie...It would have to be a very different script, almost a different story"[7].    Before official announcements had been made, the internet was rampant with rumours that controversial filmmaker Uwe Boll was set to direct, rumours that were met with varying degrees of horror from fans.    On May 1, 2006, Hideo Kojima confirmed rumors that a Metal Gear Solid movie is in the works, although a date of release is currently unknown[8]. Kojima has also stated that Uwe Boll would not be directing[9]. In a recent interview, Kojima said he would like Viggo Mortensen as Snake[10], but whether this will actually happen is unknown. It is also mentioned that David Hayter (who voices Snake in the games) could possibly write the screenplay[11].'    this is from    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal_Gear_...    4.4|`|dfe94091886ab6111f409d5b0dbc9673aa	Being a popular game its onl a matter of time before Uwe Boll thinks of making it and then raping it beyond all recognition.

590970b56cbdad70e71f602fc59497cbaa	Well, It depends on your mining level and your combat level and what you want to train. If your 30-60 mining then you should got to the mines in Lumbridge swamp ( southwest of draynor ) and mine coal then bring in back to draynor bank. and for the training combat lvl 30-70 you can go to the giants cave which ladder is in a shack thats just under barbarian village. For this spot you need a key though. You can buy the key from people coming out of the shack. (tradeable) Also another good training spot is the Scorpions in the dwarven mines. This is also good if you want to mine and train at the same time. Just bring a weapon and armor and a pickaxe and you'll be good. Most likely alot of people will be in there so don't be overwhelmed just keep to yourself and try to grab as many rocks as possible. Scorps stop aggroeing at level 65 combat. Usually the people in there are pretty grateful for you killing all the annoying scorps. So i hope this helped. And if you need any help my account is Jesse Haines and I'm lvl 73 combat and a member.

QQYK0CTVaa	Round robin IS a bet type!   A parlay is when you bet 2 teams TOGETHER, so it pays more,   an example of a parlay is betting $20 on the Steelers (-7) and the under (47) in the superbowl. Which if both happen, pays $50.  Now, a round robin is betting like 4 teams, and betting them in all combinations of 2, so lets choose teams 1,2,3, and 4 to win, a round robin bets these parlays  1 and 2  1 and 3  1 and 4  2 and 3  2 and 4  3 and 4  so thats 6 bets total, all equal for whatever amount you want to bet, you can also do a round robin with 3 teams in each bet, for...  1,2,3  1,2,4  1,3,4  2,3,4  so, that would be 4 bets total!    I always like to bet a parlay of all 4 teams also, so if 2 or 3 teams win, i get most of my money back or a small profit, but if all 4 win, i break the bank!|`|BwyRLFrhaa	A round robin is simple a series of parlays in which every possible combination of teams is wagered on.  So if you pick three games then you will be playing 3 separate 2 team parlay wagers.  This will allow you to profit even if one of the 3 teams loses.

yzpU5fZJaa	u really don't need mirror force with this deck, becuase it seems to look like it relies on monarch field control. add a second dimmensional fissure. remove mst and add 2 dark core. i know it sounds stupid, but mst isn't that good. it dosent even negate.|`|wwzcobwBaa	i think you should definently keep magical space typhoon because it can really come through when your opponent thinks hes got you beat. this one card does more than you think it could because most stratagies good died without one card.

This card saved a bunch of duels for me. i love your stratagie of having the d.d. cards in your deck they r very strong even if at times its not the case. great deck all togather.  rate:8/10

AA10819525	I'm not 100% sure, but some games require an Active X control. You have to enable Active X control on your computer for them to work. Click on Tools, then Internet Options, go to  Advanced and scroll down, and you'll find it. Other than that, make sure your computer doesnt have a firewall up, and is blocking the applets. Hope this helps.

22oMednCaa	Very common. So annoying.  Try raising that string SLIGHTLY. There should be a screw on the bridge (one for each string) that raises/lowers it.

It cost me around $50.00's to get mine set up.
QzD3rJtMaa	Without giving you a decklist, a Tele-DAD deck is the best deck out there right now.  It is short for Teleport Dark Armed Dragon.  It basically utilizes the decks speed to quickly overwhelm the opponent and win the game within the first couple of turns.  It uses cards like 3 Emergency Teleport and 3 Krebons (possibly 1 Psychic Commander) to Synchro Summon with Destiny Hero - Malicious for quick and easy Synchro Summons.  This deck is so fast that it can generate like 3 or 4 Synchro Summons in one turn.  Along with the fact that you have 2 DAD's in this deck makes it pretty hard to beat.  It runs 3 Allure of Darkness and 3 Destiny Draw to draw the deck faster.  Let's just say it is really good and can't be beaten unless by either another Tele-DAD deck or by another deck with lots of luck.

1DBhVhw9aa	nice deck, I'm not a fan of the AA decks but if thats what works for you its pretty good.    I'd take out Card Destruction and 2 of the Hand destruction try and keep away frrom cards that send your monsters from your hand to the grave yard.
QzD3rJtMaa	The majority of all the Synchros that don't use any specific Synchro material monsters (Doomkaiser Dragon, Tempest Magician, etc.) are good in any deck.  It all depends on what situation you are in too.  If you opponent doesn't have any Spells or Traps set and you have the option for a level 6 or 8 Synchro, I'd go with Goyo Guardian and take whatever monster he has out without having to worry about it being destroyed.  If they have Spells or Traps out, then you'd probably want either Stardust or Thought Ruler.  You'd basically have to guess at what card they have down.  If it is Phoenix Wing Wind Blast, you would want Thought Ruler as your opponent wouldn't be able to target him with it.  If the face-down card was Mirror Force, then you'd want Stardust Dragon as Mirror Force doesn't target.  So you see, neither card is better then the other.  It just matters what situation you are in.    To answer your other question, in my opinion, I believe that Goyo Guardian is the best Synchro, but alot of people would disagree as he doesn't have any built-in protection like Stardust or Thought Ruler.  So he is easily destroyed.|`|xB0vOgSwaa	...id say thought ruler...but you actually need both trust me... get thought ruler first because he is rarer and then buy a stardust tin|`|1DBhVhw9aa	It all depends on what other cards your using.    Every Synchro has a type of deck that it works with best.    Stardust Dragon works well with wind cards    Ruler Archfiend works well with a Dark/Fiend Deck (I've seen it in action in a fiend deck and it worked very well, but I guess it depends on that are being used with it)    hope that helps you a bit
eNA4LIyFaa	you only met him last night........ so get your friend to ask him|`|MK5Ddtiiaa	From a guy's perspective, tell him that it would be awesome if you can some with us to Disneyland because it would be more fun with more people. I will pay for some things and treat you to lunch or something. Also, there is lots of food and coasters there. So, why not go with us? You'll have fun and be away from home! Come on.    If that doesn't work then just confront him head on. Tell him the truth.   Guys hate girls who lie.|`|qSMF6QIYaa	Dress up in a giant Mickey Mouse suit and give him an invitation.|`|rGA5TPxeaa	Since your friend is friends with him I would ask her to ask him if he wants to go with you guys.|`|gX7KThhoaa	well were did you meet him?  you should just ask him to go out as friends maybe to a skating rink? anything to get alone and the n the relation ship will grow closer hopefully Good luck! reply|`|AX13vUJeaa	Just say   "Hey.

Just something like, "Hey, I'm going to Disneyland with my friends. Wanna come with us?"  Or since he's friend with your friend, have your friend ask. =)|`|QWFvw2yvaa	Dude just ask!  Who wouldn't want to go to Disney Land?|`|eUiMXcFcaa	First get the okay from your friend - if you want him to come along she may want to bring a date too so there's no 3rd wheel.  Second find another time to hang out with him before you go, like maybe get your friend to arrange it.  While you're with him mention that you're going to Disneyland and he should soo come with you :) if he seems interested tell him when you're going and give him your number.  Tell him to call you if he decides to come.  That way the ball will officially be in his court :)|`|LiTMU2Dhaa	Just casually ask like,"We're going to Disneyland soon would you like to come."|`|kVZYOBydaa	um... take yur friend and get him in a room  blindfold him and put him in yur suitcase    logic|`|3UXrjynaaa	Just straight up ask.|`|KaZGf4PAaa	you could get tom cruise to go with you if your going to disneyland|`|rNi5MGtoaa	OMG I LUV GOING TO DISNEYLAND.    just tell him there are lots of rides.    there not all little baby disney rides there are huge rollar coasters like big thunder mountain, space mountain, indiana  jones      and also there is a scary one the phantom manor.    disneyland is not just for kids its for any age.

3af30c08175e2bc96bcd85540e09d175aa	1. The Matterhorn is a roller coaster, not a boat ride like Splash Mountain. There are a few "drops" but they aren't free-fall like Splash Mountain and they aren't nearly as long.    2. Most of the rides at Disneyland are essentially the same as at Disney World. There are some minor differences. For instance, Splash Mountain at Disneyland seats people single-file. Also, Disneyland has a much stronger local fanbase than Disney World, so they have kept some classic rides that Disney World has gotten rid of, including Mr. Toad's Wild Ride.    Other than rides, I think something you may not know is that the Disney property in Anaheim is very small compared to the property in Orlando. In Orlando, Disney owns land for miles and miles around the parks, and owns all of the hotels within those miles and miles. At Disneyland, Disney only owns Disneyland, California Adventure, two hotels, Downtown Disney, and a parking garage. There are cheap motels right across the street from the park. There are also cheap restaurants nearby, such as McDonalds. While these restaurants are more expensive than at home, they are cheaper than food on Disney property and are easy to walk to.    If you are staying in Anaheim for several days, it's worth it to get out a bit and go to other parks. Universal Studios is a little bit of a drive, but it's worth checking out for a day. A lot closer to Disneyland is Knott's Berry Farm, which has a lot more thrill rides than Disneyland. It also has a ridiculously good fried chicken restaurant, which is outside the park so you can go there without buying park admission.|`|f80e40c6be11ef18f0153889d9336d4daa	1. If you have been on Space Mountain at the Magic Kingdom in WDW you have been on the same track layout of the Matterhorn at Disneyland.  It is nothing like the drop(s) on Splash Mountain.    2. Most rides are similar, but here are some differences:  Splash Mountain - Mostly the same, but instead of the double-seating at the MK, it is single-row at Disneyland  Pirates of the Caribbean - Disneyland version has additional scenes so is longer in length.  Matterhorn - Same basic track layout as Space Mountain at MK. So no big drops mainly a lot of quick turns and small drops.  Space Mountain - No big drops but a much smoother ride, better effects(IMO), and different track layout than MK Space Mountain.  Also, you have double-row seating instead of the Single Row at MK Space Mountain.  Big Thunder Mountain Railroad - Basically the same, but the track at MK is longer.  Haunted Mansion - Disneyland's stretching room actually is an elevator taking you underground.  Also, the actual "doom buggy" portion is a bit different.    There are other minor differences on other attractions that make each version unique, but these were some of the bigger differences.|`|H0LPCjIRaa	1. There aren't really any drops on Matterhorn. If there are, they're really small. However, the seats are really uncomfortable.  2. Many rides at Disney World are Disneyland rip-offs and vice-versa. Check out disneyland.com for a complete list of rides and see if any sound familiar.|`|dhdz5uNSaa	1. Matterhorn has drops but they're not drops that make you scream. Splash Mountain drops are bigger  2. The rides at Disneyland are original and most of them were made by Walt Disney or Roy Disney|`|c05bb431beac7ffe86bf43bdbf9897fcaa	The matterhorn has dips. They are less than 2 stories. Nothing like the big drop on splash mountain.    Space Mountain at Disneyland is two people across, and a single track. I don't know about big thunder Mountain. Splash at Disneyland is single seats, one behind the other.

And it seems like the movies will take up a while of the time so I wouldn't worry too much about other activities. But, one thing you should play the board game "Curses" It's so much fun. You will have so many inside jokes after. My friend Liz, and i played it so you can play it with just two people but its wonderful for a bigger group.

Make people put a pad of paper on their head and draw a cake or something. Winner gets a prize. Or try the classics like freeze dance. Another game idea could be to buy a whole bunch of suckers. Make a stand for them out of cardboard, then color the bottom of the stick on one or two of them red. Let them take turns picking one. Until on of them picks the winning one.|`|70ihksK5aa	play tag or hide n' seek in dark and someone should flash with camera or whatever bright then people will have hard time to keep running. my friends & i did that for my 15th b-day sleepover party few years ago. make sure to put dangerous things away because we kept falling down and one of us got a little cut but we were having fun so much lol.     or you guys should set stage or scene to make a scene from movie. you can copy some script from a movie that you like or whatever.     by the way, happy early birthday :)|`|cgz7k8Vvaa	I could think of a few good ideas......(they involve a video camera and not much else......)|`|qcyaBE27aa	Well you seem pretty prepared so far, since the whole thing is already movie-themed, try getting all guests together to make your own movie, then put it on youtube.|`|QAN5OxWIaa	your 14? arent u a little to old for sleepovers?

eNHGiEvGaa	When a bookie offers you odds, and you accept those odds by buying a ticket, those are the odds you'll get paid.    Minor correction on some previous answers:    That's also true in horse racing against a bookie (as often played in the U.K.)  It's *not* true in parimutuel betting, as seen in horseracing in the U.S. and elsewhere.  That's because parimutuel racing doesn't employee bookies.  It's gamblers betting amongst themselves, with a house that takes a cut.  In that case, the reported "odds" at a given time are an estimate based on the current proportion of bets placed on the various racers.|`|Um7mYM71aa	yes.|`|2d643fe2509c39d5e9d2affcc16d13bcaa	Yes..

SeSObtS0aa	What is World of Warcraft?  World of Warcraft is a massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG). In World of Warcraft, thousands of players adventure together in an enormous, persistent game world, forming friendships, slaying monsters, and engaging in epic quests that can span days or weeks.    What is an MMORPG?  MMORPG stands for "massively multiplayer online role-playing game." In an MMORPG, thousands of players exist in the same game world at the same time. This creates an incredibly rich and active environment in which interesting things are constantly taking place. MMORPGs provide thousands of hours of game play, with a nearly infinite variety of goals to achieve across a vast world covering miles of land and sea. For World of Warcraft, we also add new content on a regular basis, thus ensuring that there will always be new adventures, new locations, new creatures, and new items to discover.    Is there a monthly fee to play the game?  Yes. After the end of the free month included with the game, you need a subscription in order to continue playing the game. There are three subscription options: a month-to-month package at $14.99 per month, a three-month plan at $13.99 per month, and a six-month plan at $12.99 per month.    Why isn't World of Warcraft free?  The fee is used to support the costs associated with the high-quality levels of service, support, and ongoing content creation that go into World of Warcraft.    Are there multiple methods of payment?  Yes, customers can pay their subscription fees using credit cards, PayPal, and pre-paid game cards, which can be purchased in many game and electronics stores.      If you plan on buying the game, I would recommend purchasing the World of Warcraft Battle Chest which costs $39.99 and includes:  1) The original World of Warcraft game  2) The Burning Crusade expansion  3) A World of Warcraft Strategy Guide from Brady Games  4) The Burning Crusade Strategy Guide from Brady Games    It is also possible to begin playing just by purchasing the original World of Warcraft game without any of the expansions; costing you $19.99 only. You'll not need to purchase The Burning Crusade expansion until you reach Level 60 and Wrath of the Lich King expansion only when you reach Level 70.    You might like to note that the original World of Warcraft game includes 30 days of game time; while no additional game time is provided when upgrading your account with The Burning Crusade or Wrath of the Lich King expansions.      Finally, should you still be keen in purchasing the game, please allow me to recruit you via the Recruit-A-Friend program (click on my avatar and check my profile to contact me). You'll receive a special trial Authentication Key that would provide you with 10 days of free game time and the recruiter would be rewarded 30 days of free game time after you purchase the game and begin your subscription. Thank you.|`|dXEWsMLBaa	Your not the only one who doesn't know that much about WOW. I have never played it, only seen it,... does look cool though. Here is     The breakdown:    World of Warcraft, often referred to as WoW, is a massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG). It is Blizzard Entertainment's fourth released game set in the fantasy Warcraft universe, which was first introduced by Warcraft: Orcs & Humans in 1994.[3] World of Warcraft takes place within the world of Azeroth, four years after the events at the conclusion of Blizzard's previous release, Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne. Blizzard Entertainment announced World of Warcraft on September 2, 2001.[4] The game was released on November 23, 2004, celebrating the 10th anniversary of the Warcraft franchise.    The first expansion set of the game, The Burning Crusade, was released on January 16, 2007.[5] The second expansion set, Wrath of the Lich King, was released on November 13, 2008.[6]    With more than 11.5 million monthly subscribers,[7] World of Warcraft is currently the world's largest MMORPG in those terms,[6][8][9] and holds the Guinness World Record for the most popular MMORPG.[10] In April 2008, World of Warcraft was estimated to hold 62%[11] of the massively multiplayer online game (MMOG) market.  - Taken from wikipedia.org    How much:  -On ebay I found it as cheap as 6 to 7 dollars.  -amazon has similar prices.  - Mainly all you'll need is the cd, and key code, that comes with the game. If you buy it brand new, say fro walmart or some other retailer then it's about: $30    Expansion packs:    There are two expansions to the original World of Warcraft, at this time. The Burning Crusade is the first expansion & Wrath of the Lich King is the second.

Priests are fairly average at both healing and damage, but function nicely as Mana Batteries for the rest of the group.|`|BKqL0mk9aa	world of warcraft stinks no offence

5ec6e061a24d9c036d2640ab0485b48baa	I see that no one has answered you yet, so you might want to ask this question at the sewing one of the boards over at Craftster, or one of the other sewing groups online:  http://www.craftster.org/forum  (it could fall best under various boards there, perhaps Sewing, or Quilting, or Home, or Toys,Etc.)    You'll want to define exaclty what size and shape a "pram" is though for Americans since we don't use that term here and have various sizes/shapes of baby strollers, etc.  Including a picture or a link to a picture would be even better.  And also define what you mean by making a "quilt" since in the U.S. that usually means "piecing" fabrics together, then making a thin or thick "comforter" type blanket with that on top, but it could also mean just sewing "quilting" lines on top of the blanket "sandwich."    Maybe something like one of these?  http://www.google.com/images?q=pram+quil...      HTH,    Diane B.

EUaIGX0Gaa	Pikachu didn't evolve from pichu because at the time of peroid that pikachu was invented, baby forms never existed and you could not breed until Gold Silver and Crystal so pikachu never evolved. <br>  <br>  And Ash's Pikachu won't evole because he refuses to evolve when ash told him to evolve<br>  <br>  Hope this helped<br>  Mip|`|5NpI6rLwaa	You cant find any baby pokemon in the wild, thats why they make you breed them for yourself, its just how it is....and the bonus question, No, he wont, he's thought of it when he lost to Lt. Surge, but he wont do it, pikachu is pikachu, not raichu, and it doesnt want to evolve, it would change so much of the series and would be so different, i personally think it would be a dumb idea|`|RnhAWXHzaa	No one knows, maybe because baby pokemon shouldn't be running around. You can't find Smoochum, Elekid, Tyrouge, or happiny in the wild either and theyre all baby pokemon so why should there be pichu? just breed one its really easy, and no Ash will never do it. Pikachu made that clear in the earlier episodes because ash was thinking about it but pikachu wouldn't let him no matter how hard he tried.|`|ZMcPHP7Yaa	Baby Pokemon come from eggs from the daycare. <br>  <br>  If I'm not mistaken, I think if you raise a baby to it's Level 1 form, it'll end up having better stats overall.<br>  <br>  And to add to your bonus question, no, he won't. he tried once, but Pikachu refused to do it. It's in one of the early episodes, when Ash tries to defeat Lt. Serge.|`|PGAKu4Mzaa	pichu can be found in diamond and pearl in the pokemon mansion's prized garden. or you can breed pikachu to get an egg. no. ash wont ever evolve his pikachu because that would kill the series according to the company|`|qzPZf2XPaa	Here's a real question...<br>  Why can't you catch the baby in Kangashkan's pouch?|`|5N4tsjNiaa	hi,<br>  what pokemon game are you talking about?<br>  In pokemon diamond and pearl you can get pichu in the trophy garden of the pokemon mansion but is rarer then the chance of getting a pikachu.<br>  If though you really can't find a pichu you can just breed Pikachu.<br>  <br>  Also I don't think Ash will ever evolve his Pikachu but there is a chance he will when he is much older and more advanced. The reason I think this is because firstly I think Pikachu has become such a big and popular icon and a main pokemon unlike raichu (its evolved form), there was even a game released because of it. The second reason is because it depends on Pikachu as Ash always asks Pikachu if he want to evolve and Pikachu has been given the chance twice but always refused. My third reason is because Pikachu is special as he is very powerful for a little pokemon (thats one reason team rocket want him) but if he evolves that almost gets rid of the main enemies.|`|VzSsd1asaa	You can never find a pre-evolved pokemon in the wild.  You either have to trade for one, or you can breed at the daycare center.  Leave 2 of the same pokemon with the couple, or you can use 1 of the pokemon along with a ditto.  Then they will give you an egg, and if you keep the egg with you long enough, it will hatch and be the baby you are looking for.|`|s3m70L5qaa	I don't think you ever find baby forms in the wild. Which is what makes the daycare system a necessary part of the games. <br>  <br>  There is a difference between normal first forms and babies, and I believe that difference IS the fact that you can't find them in the wild.|`|orANOS32aa	Well in some games you can like in emerald you can catch Wynaut on mirage island. However, these are rarer. And no Pikachu will stay as pikachu forever unless the creators decided to make a major twist in the show.|`|iO4WLTTqaa	Maybe its because the baby pokemon have to evolve really fast or risk getting destroyed. And no he probably won't evolve Pikachu because the writers would lose a lot of money.|`|nFg5iqOLaa	YA PIKACHU GONNA ELVOLVE BUT HE PUT SOME KINDA MATERIA ON HIM SO HE WONT ELVOLVE HE LOVES HIS PIKACHU I WOULD TOO =]|`|Z3OLmuQFaa	I think its b/c the creator wants u to hatch a Pichu and level it up.<br>  and no i doubt Ash will ever evolve Pikachu.
PpEOZJp8aa	All are tradeable, but since those games are orginal xbox games you can only trade them for like a $20-$30 ps2 game...    Gamestop buys the games cheap......like $2-$3 for an xbox game.  Since you have about 12, you can probably get 1 $30 game|`|5FEIR0nxaa	Trading in Animal Crossing is simple, fun, and addicting!  All you need to do  is have a trad able item in your inventory and approach good Ole Tom Nook.  (Will this Raccoon's abilities ever cease?)  You talk to him and first select  the option "Other Things".  Then from this screen select "Hear Code". Nook  will then ask you to enter the town name and character name of the person  you are sending the item to.  Tom will then give you a two line password.  Each line contains 14 characters of random numbers and letters. You tell  the person you are trading with this code, and in turn they will go to Nook  and choose the option "Say Code". Input your code and the item will be theirs!    I will take you on a simulated trade now.    Say you want to give Billy in Groovy an Orange.    -First you must have an Orange in your inventory, now talk to Nook.    -Choose "Other Things", then choose "Hear Code"    -Nook will now ask you to input the town and character name.    -So you would type Groovy *enter* Billy *enter*  (***NOTE*** The codes are case/space sensitive! So be sure that you have     the information written down correctly!)    -Nook will ask you to confirm the town and character name. Say yes.    -Then he will ask you to pick which item you want to trade. So pick the       Orange from your inventory screen and select OK.    -He will ask something like "So you want me to send Billy in Groovy an       Orange? Is this correct?"  If it is correct say yes.    -Nook Will now give you the password and it will look something like this...          P%isomorphic5gVG        %KM4Qiqihar53U    -Now be sure to write this down ***EXACTLY*** the way it appears! Paying      close attention to capital and lowercase letters.  Also be sure to notice      the difference between capital Ia's and lowercase L's (More on this later.)    -All that is left to do is you to E-mail, IM, post, call, send smoke signal,      use morse code, or just flat out tell the Person that code, and they will      have the item! In this example Billy would have an Orange! Yum!    OK, you have a code and are wondering what to do with it? Easy! All you have  to do is, once you get a code, go to Nook.  Choose "Other Things" Now you  pick "Say Code".  He will then ask you to input your code.  Be sure to enter  it EXACTLY as you see it.  If entered correctly, then Nook will say         "A (item name here) has just arrived for you!"    Trading is just that simple!!!|`|H09OAJxSaa	gamestop stopped tradeing xbox orginal games so then just sell them and use the money to buy new games.|`|BqxYa9tEaa	Gamestop stopped taking original Xbox games I think.

DtkLsetkaa	You have to use the landscaping tool that allows you to affect the ground and sink the ground low, then build walls in the hole you made I believe.  I haven't played with it in a long time but I seem to remember this.  Make sure you use LOTS of lights in your basement, and don't forget to put a real floor down.  After the walls go up you should be able to use the ground tool again to smooth out the area around the walls.  I will play with it a big when I get home from work and see if I can get it to work for you.  If Sims2fan sees this she will definitely know the answer.|`|WuhIoS1laa	You can take a look online for basement tutorials.  There are a few methods to do it, but they aren't hard. You use foundations that you apply a wall covering to that clearly shows the bottom of a full height wall, then lower the ground to that level and start building up to the rest of the terrain level.<br>  <br>  This page has links to several tutorials:<br>  <a href="http://www.sims2wiki.info/wiki.php?search=basement&go=Go" rel="nofollow">http://www.sims2wiki.info/wiki.php?searc...</a><br>  <br>  It takes some careful clicking with the landscaping tools, but I've used it. The first issue is of course, a completely sunken room will have almost zero natural light.<br>  <br>  The second relates to which neighborhood you do this in.  Some neighborhoods have a water table which is very close to the ground layers of the map.  This results in basements "flooding" in those neighborhoods.<br>  <br>  Veronaville comes to mind for that problem. I didn't have flooding in the other default neighborhoods though.|`|7Ca2ns47aa	I wondered this myself at one point in time, and I also attempted it numerous times... but I still haven't found a way... so I don't really think so. I'd love to know how if someone else has figured out a way... but perhaps this building option will be available in The Sims 3 :)<br>  <br>  EDIT: After reading Kia's answers... it seems to make sense to me that this could work. I haven't played The Sims 2 in over a year now (sad, I know) but hopefully I will be able to soon... I'm going to try this... thanks!|`|F52Slt8Laa	First you need to click the elevation tool and make it create a deep declined area, then use wall tools to create a room.

AA10726404	Yeah I just Googled it, and it appears to be nonsense.    It is the failed Martingale System all over again.    Oddly the site also claims that you should quit every time you win $200 in a single day.  Which doesn't make a lot of sense mathematically.  Either a system works or it doesn't.    I had to laugh too at the picture of exotic vacations spots, mansions, and exotic cars.  At $200 a day, it would take you several years to save up enough money for even the cheapest Ferrari, assuming you had no other living expenses and could consistently win $200 a day.    So as far as I am concerned another scam artist has dressed up the Martingale System and is trying to sell it to people who are gullible.    Further more this system is also hand picking certain 'vulnerable' online casinos, and recommending them, which would probably earn the con man commission on that too.    Roulette has been around for 200 years or so.  Some of the greatest minds on the planet have tried to defeat it, and failed.  So I find it hard to believe that some guy with a one page 'tabloid' web site has figured it all out.  And if he had, why alert the casinos to his wonderful system?|`|eNHGiEvGaa	Concur.  No.    Oh, and regarding the comment below, it's true that Martingale systems are entirely without merit, but *not* because of table limits.  A martingale player should thank his lucky stars if a casino is actually going to limit his betting.  Every bet he makes is a loser.|`|L2S9jjdLaa	Just did a search and found his web site sadly he is offering the Martingale system (doubling your bet after each losing spin when betting even money 1:1 bets on red or black for instance) this system is the most common and well known on the net. Table limits render this system useless.|`|5LfkDfXkaa	No.    I have no knowledge of this particular system but it can be mathematically proved that NO roulette system works.  The only exception would be one which involved a device to measure the speed and trajectory of the ball - and they are illegal (and dangerous to the user).

IE A shore snapper can not be blocked by a player who controls an Island since Shore Snapper has the Islandwalk ability.

MKZyKVWLaa	Really, it's all the same and nothing is inherently harder than anything else. No matter what class you choose, you'll for the most part be doing a simple rotation over and over (except in PvP, but even then you'll have a maximum of 8ish spells/abilities you'd need to use at any given moment for any given class), so you shouldn't be too worried that you'll be bad at it.     Just try out the other classes and see what you like. Rogues are pretty simple, as are Shaman (even with the eleventybillion totems they have to choose from, only 1-2 of each type [Earth, Fire. Water, Wind] are ever really needed, the rest being beyond situational.)    I'd say try any class that interests you to about level 20. Since leveling is so easy now, you don't really lose anything but a bit of time if it turns out you dislike the class.|`|3906124cfbe15ee474641dd5c529df6caa	Well if you got that far you should try the deathknight, you get them once any of your characters reaches level 55, they are a lot of fun because they are just as tough as warriors but have the damage potential and DoT's of a warlock and they look quite cool too, it would be a different experience but one worth trying since they are close to warlocks in game play but just as tough as other tanks...you would always try Hunters,they are quite fun to play and it always helps to have a pet out there helping you out.|`|c833y7JZaa	I picked a Warlock for my main, suck's you deleted it, they are so fun now.

I tried to sell NHL 07 and FEAR for 360 and they will only give me $15 credit so I guess it has to be around 5.

	It's called the 'Deathknight Helm', you can get it from certain random quests from Atrix.
dvkWQvfDaa	use a software called Flashget. it is a download manager. with it, if your connection is lost or something, the download will pause. when you regain your connection you can continue downloading. you can also intentionally pause your downloads. you can program downloads so that you download one file at a time, and when one is done the next one continues.    yep, pretty much you should try it. that way you won't have to download the file again and again because you lose it every time.|`|UX3xjsFlaa	Just go to a site where you pay for the game. If you are trying to get it for free it either has glitches or something that will hurt your computer like adware or spyware. Dont use a bit-torrent file.

bCCQwk5Qaa	To obtain the Cloudy Mirror, go to Remiem which can be accessed from Calm Lands. Once you get there talk to the Chocobo, race and win. After obtaining the Cloudy Mirror, you must go to Macalania Woods. Help the lady find her husband and her son to access the shiny path. Follow the path until you find the big crystal. Use it to refine the Cloudy Mirror into a Celestial Mirror.|`|DJNmodhOaa	ive beaten the game and im not quite sure what youre talking about

hwaTOBL7aa	instead of wasting time waiting for an answer why don't you just check by calling Game Stop or bringing in the games and ask yourself, you would have found out by now if you weren't waiting for answer. Plus you already asked this question. Anyway, you will get probaly $120 but no one knows on yahoo answers for sure.<br>  <br>  here's the phone number to Game Stop<br>  <br>  1-800-883-8895|`|J9RIyBDxaa	I often trade in games and lately gamestop have been lowering credit they usually give for games.  I would look into trading with blockbuster.  I notice that blockbuster is trying to increased their gaming side of business and they have been giving better trades than gamestop.|`|JuTvkKwqaa	Unless someone here works at gamestop, I don't see how you're going to get a precise answer.  Why don't you just call one of the bazillion gamestops?|`|aZXnW6AUaa	I dont understand that question|`|62mt0VKJaa	Whats the question?<br>  <br>  *With all that, probably quite a bit. Probably over or around $100
V0uQLz23aa	Hopefully they will|`|0LQ5CuL0aa	they are never gonna make it|`|0R0QngRmaa	try these web-sites:<br>  <br>  a) www.cheatcc.com<br>  b www.gamespot.com<br>  c) www.gamestorrents.com
GV2PtWzMaa	No, I have been to six flags many times in the rain. <br>  <br>  Six flags makes the point that you should check the weather forecast before you go to the park and make the choice yourself if you want to come or not.<br>  <br>  If you ask for a rain check they will just tell you that it was your choice and you should have checked the weather <br>  <br>  When i had my 8th grade trip it rained all day and we just had to stay there and wait for the rain to clear up. Most of the rides close when it rains.|`|SAgCy83Oaa	They will probably give you a Rain Check, which is usually good for any later date in the Season.
FQdE11IBaa	You could buy a DSTT card :-)<br>  A DSTT card is a card - shaped like a normal DS game that can hold many games depending on the type of memory card it has in it (which can be replaced and swapped)<br>  DSTT cards come with a DS Ipod built in, which is a copy and paste job.<br>  If you want any more info on DSTT cards feel free to email me and ask :-)|`|l8WdGC3Taa	Step 1. Mod your DS.<br>  Step 2. You need to open up the back and remove the backlight.<br>  Step 3. After that solder in transistor radio.<br>  Step 4. Press Z or R twice.|`|PXohU6gEaa	you can't put music on a nentendo D.S. unless you are talking about the new D.S. i.|`|2fqXT9W6aa	You'll need a flashcart, e.g. CycloDS or R4. It'll usually come with a 2GB MicroSD card depending on where you buy it. They come with Moonshell, a homebrew app that can play MP3 files. Just copy & paste the MP3s onto your MicroSD card and that's it. There's also another homebrew app, LMP-NG that is an iPod for DS. Get it here: <a href="http://www.cecm.usp.br/~lucas/lmp-ng/" rel="nofollow">http://www.cecm.usp.br/~lucas/lmp-ng/</a><br>  <br>  Far safer than risking the first answer. There isn't even a Z button on the DS :S
dDmGGHs6aa	To breed Pokemon, you have to put 2 of the same Pokemon that have different genders with a Ditto in the Day-care and wait for an egg. The only legendary Pokemon that can breed is Manaphy. (You have to walk around or the egg will never hatch.)|`|cxPPBaojaa	u go to the daycare put two diferent gendered pokemon and wait for an egg<br>  use ditto for males|`|2EHrHsZgaa	u use the daycare.<br>  i wish they made it so u could choose wether to be a trainer, breeder, coordinator, etc...|`|CuEanQY1aa	ask your parents....|`|xVnS9KU5aa	make them fight other pokemon...............i think...................
fVVq9pdGaa	Nod's defense i find personally more effective than gdi's. For starter's the three average nod defenses all come in triplets with a destroyable (yet repairable hub) that also double functions to auto repair the connected defenses... Along with that, combine a beam cannon and an obelisk of light, and u gotta structure that will make tank battalions cower in their tracks.<br>  <br>  Now lets combine what i just mentioned in a real world situation. Let me try to paint the image of a 3'rd of my base perimeter. 1 laser turret, layed out in a slightly curved fashion...1 shredder turret, layed out interwoven between the lazer turrets...an obelisk laid out directly in front of the last two turrets huds...and a sam site layed out in a spread out triangle behind all those turrets...AND FINALLY a stealth generator laid behind that.<br>  <br>  u put about 3 of what i said around your base and your set, add beam cannons to the most often attacked obelisk for added support. Have stealth bombers patrol your most outer perimeter that can be infested with artillery capable of taking out your defense. Also, having extra war factory's near the front lines of your base isn't a bad idea, considering they repair any nearby vehicle that can aid u in your defense, or get back out on offense.<br>  <br>  and thats about it...for defense...don't make me get started in mid field strategy...|`|o3CsT7phaa	Go to gamewinners.com

2430552f9df03330c63a412a1f018406aa	As long as your xbox live account is still active it should be fine. My hard drive died and when I replaced it I was still able to retrieve my online data along with my current single player progress (even though I had lost all saved data on my hdd). It seems this data is kept on xbox live along with your gamer score. Check your achievements and see if you have GOW ones there. If not, I'd say the whole lot has resest.
