My grandmother subleased her apartment to another tenant because she was leaving overseas. The verbal agreement was in effect starting the month of November 2008 (no lease or contract was done). However, yesterday she was notified that the new tenant was not paying rent; specifically, for the months of December and January. A noticed was received in the mailbox stating to pay within 3 days by 2/3/09 or give possession of the premises to the landlord. If failure to pay or to give up the premises, the land will commence summary proceedings against you to recover possession of the premises. In addition, the new tenant was not paying cable and utilities bill as well. The new tenant does not pick up the phone nor return any of my calls. I will take action and have the locks changed on the apartment tomorrow. The landlord was notified about my actions and will do the change of locks. My question is: is this illegal? The reason I ask is because I am not in the lease.

20090131152122AA5zfg1	Politics & Government;Elections	Would you vote for the BNP?	The BNP seems to be becoming a lot more mainstream. A few years ago I was only vaguely aware of their existence. However now you hear about them all the time. I have friends from university who openly support them, as does my aunty Deb from Birmingham- where my cousin Megan is now one of the only kids from this country in her school.    I even heard on the tele that Britain's top model now openly endorses the BNP. I also have an Indian neighbour, who I see every morning when I go to buy my newspaper, who has moved down here from London. Who talks of voting for the BNP, because he says the country is not the country he came to in the 1960s, because there are too many immigrants. And that none of the main parties recognize the threat of radical Islam which caused partition in India.    I have read their manifesto and support most of their policies. And a few days ago I met some representatives of the BNP, who were campaigning in my area, who in contrary to the media image of the BNP, turned out to be just ordinary people.  Some parts of Britain are almost untouched by immigration, however in swathes of the country the English have either become, or are becoming demographically and culturally the minority in our own bloody country. And Labour only ever appease the Muslims to get their votes, rather than confront the issue of radical Islam.    None of the major parties will address these issues, only the BNP seem to be making a stand on this. Would you vote for the BNP in the European elections in June?  And do you think that the BNP getting some seats in the European parliament in June will make much difference to government policy in regards to mass migration, radical Islam etc? And what do you think of the BNP generally?

Unfortunately in America, our hardworking people are so stressed out by their jobs and home foreclosures and hospital bills that we rarely have time to follow important news and politics.      Also, the American people are always in some kind of debt which makes many feel powerless or inferior because nobody wants to strike and lose their jobs and homes.      Part of the reason that people in other countries especially in Europe are more active in their governments is because they live simpler lives and arent bound by the corporations they work for.

20090226082505AAZEQ4o	Politics & Government;Law Enforcement & Police	Need some law enforcement opinions?	Hey guys.. I'm currently applying to be a Police Officer.. however, I applied with about 8 or 9 different departments and have various testing dates coming up. I just got a job offer for a part time 32-hour a week loss prevention job and my days are going to be Thursday-Sunday, 7am to 3pm and 3pm to 11pm.. which might interfere with my upcoming testing dates. I notified my supervisor about one of the dates and he said "thats fine" and was just wondering.. these are some good depts, but I also wanna have some money saved up to go test in the future as well and I know calling out/taking time off to test would jeopardize that. Any advice how to handle this?

Ok so as much as I don't want this to happen (as I am proud to have him as a president) I can't help but think that this could happen. I am worried that because Obama is African American that racism will lead to his assassination. I would hate to see this happen again, but I am  sure that ALL americans are not over racism of African American people, and that could lead to someone assassinating him. What's your opinion?

20090226082111AAu6YS9	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Legal help…. Serious answers please..?	Okay, I’ll start from the beginning…. It all started on November…. I didn’t receive any of my mail From November till January. I moved to a new apartment on January. When I changed my address with the post office, I started receiving all of the mail that I was suppose to receive in November/December.    Once I started receiving all of my old mail, there was a letter for a court date that I did not attend because I had no knowledge of, until January. And on top of that, the DMV had my wrong address, (the correct address is on my State I.D), so this is a fault of the DMV. Therefore, the reason I did not receive any of my court dates in the mail is because they were not delivered to the correct address to begin with.    So yesterday (2/25/09) I turned myself in at the state Police station and my intention is to just straighten things out. I was arrested by an Officer, (Officer Shannan) at the state Police station. The officer then drove me up a block to seven locks road where they put me in a cell for 2 hours. The police officer looked at my case and went easy on me.    All of this is just one big misunderstanding. The reason I had a court date in the beginning was for a traffic violation, the ticket is paid off, but I did not go to the court date that was assigned to me.    I hope to keep my Job and not to be looked as a criminal. I might have left out some minor details that my lawyer may point out to show you that my case is just one big misunderstanding and that the DMV played a big role as to why I did not receive my mail.       I live in Maryland / Montgomery county         My job now knows my situation with this whole arrest thing, and where I work, we have a security clearance with DOD. Soooo, will this make me lose my job, or will they look at this and decide weather this case is just a big and dumb misunderstanding or go by the manual and fire me? Help please

If I would have had a choice between McCain (Or as I like to call him Johnny McRino) or Hillary Clinton...I would have picked Hillary everyday and twice on Sunday! Now why as a Conservative would I pick Hillary? Well it's simple really, if you compare the voting record on really key issues between McCain and Clinton, Clinton is the Conservative. While both are "Moderate" Clinton isn't reflexive and isn't trying to be anybodies "Maverick". Now out of everyone who ran for the nomination I wanted first Thompson and then Huckabee....but when it was a sure bet that McCain was the nominee, I sent Hillary a donation.

20090226082658AARbpVi	Politics & Government;Politics	Do you know why Obamas budget has such a huge deficit?	It's the economy stupid.   Like more then 5 million out of work.   That is just counting those that file unemployment.   What about the ones who have fallen off that list?  The uncounted.      How about profits across the board for corporations and businesses have gone down?   How about imports have gone down.   How about consumers are cutting back?   How about big ticket items have gone down?   What about all the foreclosures?      All of that means lost tax revenue.      Then there is the increase in welfare, food stamps, medical care for those without insurance.      Plus, regardless if it was a dem or repug stimulus bill, it would have resulted in a huge bill, no matter what party controlled it.  I don't care if you are a free marketer, that is irrelevant now. Nor do I care if you are a Bush or Obama blamer, that is irrelevant too if you honestly think about it and use your common sense.       I don't care if it was McCain who got the nod, or Obama, both would have faced a huge deficit, at the very least their first two years.      Just how is America going to get back to work?  Just how is America going to survive and come out on top?  Just how in the hell are we going to keep funding our military and wars?

Why is Obama pulling out of one war and transferring that to our new Vietnam, or Soviet Union type retreat?      Where can we cut back?  What would be prudent?  What should we increase?  Were does it all stop?        Who do we blame it on?   Socialism and communism?  Those that blame that really have no idea what either means.   Free markets?  Those that believe that will fix things do not understand human greed and power.   Or should the blame be put on the government?  How about deregulation?  What about greed and the thirst for power?  Our wars? Our politicians?  The people and our thirst for shopping till we drop and maxing our our credit cards? 5% down on a new home we can't afford but government and credit carpet baggers pushed on us?

But a buddy of mine is going to be a cop when hes older and one day he all of a sudden stopped using all schedule 1 substances. When I asked him why he said because they won't hire you as a cop you've done them before. I immediately questioned this, as many troubled youth have turned their lives around and become a police officer.      Then it occured to me, how the hell are they going to know if you've done them? Some crazy specific drug test that can magically test all schedule 1s? Nope... he claims that theres a lie detector test. I agree that this is most likely true but if that were the case I couldn't imagine them going deep into detail about it and refusing you as a cop for making a few mistakes down the road.      Can somebody clear this up because I personally think he is having ridiculous logic over this situation and being very paranoid... by the way hes not even using anything that hard it just happens to be a schedule 1.

How the Employee Free Choice Act Takes Away Workers' Rights      Does a ballot cast in private or a card signed in pub?lic better reveal a worker's true preference about whether to join a union? A private vote is the obvious answer, but organized labor has nonetheless made the misleadingly named Employee Free Choice Act (EFCA, H.R. 800) its highest legislative priority.   Recently, unions have switched the focus of their organizing operations from private balloting to publicly signed cards. These so-called card-check campaigns make it much easier for unions to orga?nize workers, but most companies strongly resist the idea of denying their employees a vote. Unions now want the government to take away workers' right to vote and certify unions after only a card-check campaign. The Employee Free Choice Act would do this and more.          http://www.heritage.org/research/Labor/b...

20090131162131AACsZGI	Politics & Government;Elections	With Obama's attacks on Rush Limbaugh this week and previous attacks on Sean Hannity, it's very ?	clear he does not tolerate dissent well and really doesn't even like to be questioned.  This was even more glaring when we watched him during the campaign accusing the normally slobbering press corps of grilling him for merely asking follow-up questions.    President Bush spent eight years withering attacks from the Liberal Media and thousands of others and never once attacked any of them publicly.   Obama is not made of the same stuff and his conduct tells me a lot about his intentions.  It tells me that he believes that attacking his dissenters PUBLICLY will frighten off others and allow him to advance his Socialist agenda.  That is what Marxist Socialists do in order to shut down their dissenters.  That is what they are taught when studying Marxism.  Obama is also a student of Saul Alinsky.

HOMELAND INSECURITY   Congress warned: 'Beware of CAIR'   Takes cue after FBI cuts off Muslim group for terror ties      --------------------------------------...   Posted: January 31, 2009   12:00 am Eastern      ? 2009 WorldNetDaily             Warning: Do not meet with representatives of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, a "Dear Colleague" letter sent yesterday to every U.S. House member says.       The three-page letter, a copy of which was obtained by WND, warns legislators to "think twice" about meeting with CAIR officials due to mounting evidence the group is tied to terrorists.       FBI officials have been canceling planned outreach events with CAIR chapters across the country, following a recent directive by FBI headquarters to sever ties with the group.       "The FBI has cut ties with them," the congressional letter says. "There are indications that this group has connections to Hamas," the Palestinian terrorist group.       My question is....

Basically i was a bit worried what could happen to me if i smoked underage i didn't want them to take me home ETC so i said i was born in 1992 (that makes me 16 and legal to smoke) i was with my mate who was 15 and they asked him a few basic questions like name, address, age ETC but he asked me a good few more questions like height, clothe brands ETC. Is this because i was 16 and legal to go to prison? or is it the just it was a different officer and maybe not as  easy going? Could it have been the way i looked because i have a fair few scars on my face/eyebrow and look i guess more thuggish than my friend?    Well basically i lied to the police about my age and ive had other in counters with the police and i told them my actually age because i didn't have cigarettes on me.    Is this a serious crime? could it go on my record or anything if they find out? i wouldn't mind if they just came to my house or anything i just dont want anything that will follow me around for the rest of my life.

We had 90 days to get married- Jan. 27th.  We didnt know there was a 72 hour waiting period in Texas after you get your license so we took the next possible appointment at Justice of the Peace on Jan.26 and thought we were still in our time.  a few weeks later when we went to fill out the adjustment of status paperwork. we took out the i-94 record which was dated Jan.25th that we needed to get married.  We immidiately called lawyers, INS service centre information etc... and was told since it was just a day it should not be a problem.  so we pid the fees and filed the paperwork.  almost a year later got a letter that we had been denied because of the one day late-no other information on what to do.  So we called customer service and we were told we could appeal for 585.00 within 30days.  Immediately did that and with in two weeks, got another denial letter stating the law is the law with no other information on what to do.  So we interviewed, and  emailed several attorneys-they all said situation could be fixed by letting them put him into deportation status and getting our day in court.  So we hired and attorney who started the process, and a few months later said that the trail attorney in Dallas would not put him in deportation status because he is not a criminal, and they do not care that he is going to become illegal.  WE CARE!  By now his work authorization is expired and he can not work.  So they said the only we can do is file all over as my husband to come.  Which will take a year and he will have to go back to his country to interviews, and its very dangerous.  There are miltiple reasons why he cant do that.  So we are trying to figure out what to do now.  I have written to my congress person who called, and sent us a privacy paper to sign to let them get into the case.  They also wanted copies of everything we have sent, and have gotten and we sent it in immediately.  We are waiting to hear back.  Can we divorce and get re-married and file it that way?  what can we do???  We have 4 kids, I am full time nursing student...this is devastating!  If anyone can help please...

20090131170559AAicJFt	Politics & Government;Elections	What has Obama done or is he planning to do to aid Hurricane Katrina victims? ?	Many Democrats bashed Bush claiming he didn't do all he could to assist them, 3 1/2 years later some people are still without their home and are financially ruined. Why are the Democrats who questioned and bad mouthed George Bush for not doing all he could, Not questioning Barack Obama for jumping right on the problem and helping these people out? So far Obama has:      1) Passed a stimulus plan that will not directly help any group of people in this country but will benefit organizations that are known to    p!ss away money like it has no end.      2) Passed a package to send over 1 billion dollars to the gaza strip of which a big portion of this money will benefit Hamas who have attacked Israel and shielded itself behind women and children in order to attempt Israel from retaliating against them.       3) Paid an extravagant amount of money on inauguration day to pay Miley Cyrus and the Jonas Brothers to put on a concert for his own children.      4) Took the time to preach to the Republicans of the house not to listen to Rush Limbaugh if they wanted to get along with the Democrats in office.       I guess some things don't matter to Democrats because it's easier to ash Republicans and blame them rather than to actually try to fix it?

For the past two months I have been receiving late night phone calls from a with held number, when I would answer there was just a man breathing heavily and mumbling, I thought this was quite strange as I never give my phone number out.       Then earlier tonight I had a phone call from a withheld number, this time they spoke, they said "I want to f*ck your tight little c*nt", I didn't recognize the voice,  And obviously I was quite shaken. I immediately hung up, but they persisted and called again. I then proceeded to just switch my phone off.       About a half out later, I put my phone on again to phone friend for a chat and to tell her about what had happened, when I saw I had a voicemail,  It was the same man...   He said:   "I want to f*ck you, I want to beat your little c*nt, I am going to f*ck you so hard, tight little p*ssy, Im going to f*ck you" Then there was heavy breathing (as though he was jerking off) and then and the end he said, "Im watching you all the time".      Obviously I am really shaken;      1. Is this sexual harassment?   2. If i go to the police can they track the number?   3. Will the police be able to press charges?

20090131174234AAI0Qto	Politics & Government;Law Enforcement & Police	Some cops really are retarded?	About a month ago, I was in Manhattan with a friend pretty late at night. Around 12:30 or so... and the both of us were stranded with no money/metrocard, and no way of getting home... other than the train, of course. Anyways, I asked the lady at the front desk if I could get through, and she told me that I have to ask an officer for permission. We looked for an officer for a good 15 minutes, and to no avail, we could not find one.      FINALLY, out of the corner of my eye, I spotted an officer walking down. I called him, but he couldn't hear me. So... I just went through the gate and tried to catch him, and he ended up giving me a ticket. Why? Because he thought I tried to sneak through, and i saw him, so I pretended like I was going to talk to him.      What a retarded cop. The truth is, I really did want to catch him and ask him for permission. I tried to explain it to him, but he refused to believe me.      Anyways, he gave me a $50 ticket, and I didn't pay it. Didn't feel like I was obligated to... because well, I didn't deserve it. Now they sent a freaking notice to my house asking me to go to court on February 11th. Wow.       This just shows me that there are really some stupid cops out there. Instead of dealing with serious problems like murders, robberies, etc, this stupid cop felt the need to deal with a 17 year old boy who was just trying to get home.      Jesus... some cops really are retarded. Do you agree?

20090131164958AA4UQsJ	Politics & Government;Politics	What do you think about Obama's proposed vending machine policies?	Under Bush, people were able to buy a 20oz bottle of soda for a mere $1.00 -- some machines even offer it for as little as $0.80! But these machines have STOLEN jobs from deserving Americans. Therefore, Obama has proposed that a law be enacted which requires a Certified Vending Machine Operator (CVMO) be present at each machine when a purchase is made.      "Essentially, these CVMOs will be present to take the money from the customers. The CVMO will then insert the money into the vending machine, and select the product the customer requests. We will provide training so that each CVMO will become proficient at operating the machine they are assigned to. This will stimulate the economy and provide jobs. This is the gateway to an America with a significantly smaller unemployment rate.", explained President elect Obama.      But some critics are skeptical of Obama's change. CVMOs will earn a minimum of $25/hour and receive health, dental and other benefits. It is estimated that the average price of a 20oz soda will jump from $0.80-1.00 to $8.95-$10.00. Likewise, snack, coffee, sandwich and other vending machines will need to raise their price to cover the expertise provided by the CVMO attending to the machine.      "This is just   ridiculous!", exclaimed Andrew Pierce of Borchard Printing. "When I'm running late in the morning, I am sometimes forced to buy my lunch from vending machines at the office. I hate spending $5.00 for a   lunch. This change will make the same lunch cost near $25! I find it ironic that these people working as CVMOs are the ones who would need a CVMO to use a vending machine. This isn't rocket science."      What is your opinion on the CHANGE Obama has in store for the vending industry? Considering each vending machine would require a CVMO, that is a lot of jobs throughout the US! Maybe he isn't as stupid as conservatives made him out to be before the election?

20090131165344AA0htoV	Politics & Government;Other - Politics & Government	Ethical Question: Who should get the kidney?	Scenario: A wealthy 65 year old man has been waiting in the hospital for a kidney transplant for 2 months. A 19 year old male has been waiting in the hospital for a kidney transplant for 2 weeks. There is only one kidney available. Putting their financial status aside, lets assume the 65 year old man has a 50% chance of surviving the transplant and the 21 year old has a 90% chance. Who should get the kidney?    Argument for the 65 year old man: We need to develop a consistent set of laws and should not decide who gets a kidney transplant by a case by case probabilistic process. Both lives should be treated equally and the 65 year old man has been weighting longer.    Argument for the 19 year old male: The 19 year old has a higher chance of surviving the surgery and potentially has more working years ahead. Economically, it makes sense to give the 19 year old the transplant.     Please, let me know your opinion and more importantly your reasoning.

I am not asking for hundreds of opinions on President Obama or President Clinton. I just want to know if this is true and where I can find out about it. First, I voted for Obama. A friend who does not like Obama swears that he supports this tax: It is a tax on people who have already paid their house off. A dollar amount would be assessed on how much the owner would pay per month if they were renting or still making a mortgage payment. And that amount would be added onto the owner's final income for the year (not that the actually made that much) but for income tax purposes only. So at the end of the year, when the owner has to pay taxes, it would place them in a higher tax bracket. This would make them pay higher income taxes.     He says Clinton tried to get it passed but failed. And now Obama is for it.    I've never heard of such and can't find it on the internet. If someone has heard of it, please explain it and give me a link that I can find out more.    Thanks!

20090131174433AAgS7JC	Politics & Government;Law Enforcement & Police	Neighbor broke in to house to use phone, can I get her arrested?	Let me explain the background: I live next door to a drug-dealing family.  They are none too smart, and are constantly getting into small fights with others.  The woman has recently been going door to door, trying to use neighbor's phones.  My parents have gotten angry with her, so she doesn't come when they are home.  I never answer the door for her.    Yesterday, I heard her signature door pounding, waking me up.  It stopped, and a few minutes later I heard her talking downstairs.  I got up to check the time, and the sounds stopped.  When I went to use the bathroom, I heard footsteps running out the back door.  I was in disbelief that anyone had broken into our house, so I assumed it was my mom doing stuff.  I found out later that my parents were not home at the time.    Later on, my mom told us someone had broken in through the back door, and it had been left partially open like someone had rushed out.  We then realized what happened, but my parents thought we had no chance of getting her arrested.  We need a subpoena to get the local phone records, so no smoking gun that way, but I did recognized her voice (plus the obvious yet subjective evidence).  Is there anyway I can get this woman arrested?  These people are the trashiest humans I have ever met.

Star-Kist Tuna's headquarters are in San Francisco ,   Pelosi's home district.      Star-Kist is owned by Del Monte Foods and is a major   contributor to Pelosi.      Star-Kist is the major employer in American Samoa employing   75% of the Samoan work force.      Paul Pelosi, Nancy 's husband, owns $17 million dollars   of Star-Kist stock.      In January, 2007 when the minimum wage was increased from$5.15 to $7.25, Pelosi had American Samoa exempted from the   increase so Del Monte would not have to pay the higher wage.   This would make Del Monte products less expensive than their   competition's.      Last week when the huge bailout bill was passed, Pelosi   added an earmark to the final bill adding $33 million   dollars for an 'economic development credit in American   Samoa '.

Bush and Hoover had both 1 thing they created a outsourcing policy for the rich and that caused the drop in GDP in both    depressions. Anti worker lobbyist who work for the Walmart Gangsters have spent allot of time and money paying congress to hide this fact from the tax payer. The fact is that 70% WTO members have raised tariffs in last year and I know this because I own a exports business.       We allow countries to steal are jobs and give them tax dollars to do it. We should impose a sales tax on all non American goods to bring jobs which is NOT a tariff that is legally defined as charging the importer, and as a result is exempt to the trade agreements.      This tax would not cause a rise in cost of other goods at the store, and is nothing like the tariffs in 1920's. This tax only keeps are GDP at home and forces the rich to buy & sell American.         How do think we can raise GDP with 80% of our current GDP going to a evil foreign power?      Tariffs did not cause the stock market to crash non American industry is not traded in our market.      Anti American advocates for big imports continue to support pro outsourcing and anti worker policies for the rich.

I know most people don’t actually read the whole question before answering.. so please read... This is all coming from the horse’s mouth.. (No pun intended).      "In today's globalized world, the security of the American people is inextricably linked to the security of all people. Whether it's global terrorism or pandemic disease, dramatic climate change or the proliferation of weapons of mass annihilation, the threats we face at the dawn of the 21st century CAN NO LONGER BE CONTAINED BY BORDERS AND BOUNDARIES.      The horrific attacks on that clear September day awakened us to this new reality. And after 9/11, millions around the world were ready to stand with us. They were willing to rally to our cause because it was their cause too - because they knew that if America led the world toward a new era of global cooperation, it would advance the security of people in our nation and all nations.   The American moment has not passed, the American moment is here and like generation s before us, we will seize that moment AND BEGIN THE WORLD A NEW"..      No borders, no boundaries, A world a new.. New World order, One world government?         Aug 5, 2008 (LPAC)-- Writing in the nation's most widely read newspaper, USA Today, editor Jonah Goldberg exposes more of the megalomaniac insanity of the nation's presumptious Democratic candidate, Barack Obama. When asked his definition of the word "sin," he writes, Obama replied that it was "being out of alignment with my values." "My" values? With this definition, says Goldberg, Hannibal Lector would have had a clean conscience: he believed it was OK to eat people!      It sounds like he thinks he is his own God.         Obama campaigning in Pennsylvania..   "I've got two daughters, nine years old & six years old. I'm going to teach them first of all about values & morals but if they make a mistake, I don't want them punished with a baby."      Babies are a punishment.      Opinions?

In the process of doing a business law class paper that addresses sex discimination in employment, I have read that customer preference is not considered a legal reason to discriminate in job hiring on the basis of sex.      Suppose that an employer hires a man/woman despite customers' strong preferences to be served by/interact with a female/male respectively, in order to comply with the law, and the customer statements turn out to be no idle threat -- customers refuse to be served by the person of the "wrong" gender, and so 1) the employer assigns the customers to someone of the "right" gender, leaving the new hire to be frequently idle and unproductive, or 2) they take their business elsewhere, and sales fall.  Can the employer legally dismiss this new employee, or is he stuck with him/her?

NEW YORK — Most Republican governors have broken with their GOP colleagues in Congress and are pushing for passage of President Barack Obama's economic aid plan that would send billions to states for education, public works and health care.      Their state treasuries drained by the financial crisis, governors would welcome the money from Capitol Hill, where GOP lawmakers are more skeptical of Obama's spending priorities.      The 2008 GOP vice presidential nominee, Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, planned to meet in Washington this weekend with Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and other senators to press for her state's share of the package.      Florida Gov. Charlie Crist worked the phones last week with members of his state's congressional delegation, including House Republicans. Vermont Gov. Jim Douglas, the Republican vice chairman of the National Governors Association, planned to be in Washington on Monday to urge the Senate to approve the plan.      "As the executive of a state experiencing budget challenges, Gov. Douglas has a different perspective on the situation than congressional Republicans," said Douglas' deputy chief of staff, Dennise Casey.      Not a single Republican voted with the majority last week when the House approved Obama's $819 billion combination of tax cuts and new spending. The president's goal is to create or preserve 3 million to 4 million jobs.       http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/01/31...

Failure to take action can lead to Obama imposing even higher taxes on them.

20090131202738AABO4av	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Trying to write a legal brief for college undergrad course.  Any pointers appreciated.  I am not a law student?	Mapp v. Ohio   367 U.S. 643, 81 S. Ct. 1684, 6 L.Ed.2nd 1081 (1961)   Author: Justice Clark         I. Mrs. Mapp was convicted of possessing obscene materials by the Ohio courts.  The police department admitted the evidence was obtained during an illegal search during their attempt to locate a fugitive.  The case was appealed based on the basis of freedom of expression.     II. The question was if the seized items were protected by the First Amendment; as well as if the evidence obtained could be admitted in Ohio State Court, violating her Fourth Amendment rights.  Mrs. Mapp contended that her home was searched after officers arrived alleging that they had a search warrant, which was never produced in search of a boarder.  The items recovered were from the basement – the room of the former boarder.  Mrs. Mapp and her daughter were handcuffed and confined to a bedroom in her home.  The method used to gain entry into the home and the seizure of the items was unconstitutional.  Although the Ohio courts admitted that the seizure was illegal they referenced to Wolf v. Colorado.  Did this case fall under the exclusionary rule?    III. Holding: Yes. Based on the protecting the constitutional liberties of the people.  Based on the belief that the Fourth Amendment, alone is not enough to prevent introduction of illegally seized evidence.  Further the Fourth Amendment does not disqualify the use of the evidence.   It was at that time considered together with the Fifth Amendment – ban against self incrimination – which required the exclusionary rule.     IV. In Wolff v. Colorado held that protection of the 4th Amendment applies to states via the 14th Amendment.   In the Wolff case the court did not impose the exclusionary rule on the lower          court.  The court held that all evidence acquired by searches and seizures in violation of the Constitution is inadmissible.    V. Mrs. Mapp contend that she was assaulted by the police as they wrestled over what she was lead to believe was the warrant.    VI. The courts reversed and remanded.  Justices Harlan, Frankfurter and Wittaker dissented.

20090131201706AAuNJjA	Politics & Government;Politics	Why do the conservs make such a big deal about the measly welfare going to the elderly and poor?	In December 2005, the US Senate pushed through a top priority measure—a budget reconciliation bill that cut spending in entitlement programs for students, the poor and the elderly. Once the bill was signed into law, it marked the first cutback in entitlement spending in nearly a decade.      Vice President Dick Cheney cut short a trip to Afghanistan and the Middle East to attend the final proceedings. The vote was 51-50, with Cheney using his constitutional authority as president of the Senate to break the tie and pass the austerity measure.      The bill included $40 billion in spending reductions over five years that came largely from major rollbacks in federally-subsidized student loans, the Medicaid health program for the poor, and welfare benefits.      In relation to the overall federal budget, the $40 billion over five years is minimal. It is less than one tenth of what the US government spends on the military alone every year. However, the cuts will have a major impact on some of the most vulnerable sections of the population. They are seen as an important step in the drive to undermine entitlement programs and all government spending not aimed at enriching the wealthy or expanding the military-police apparatus.      The blatant class character of government policy is highlighted by the fact that the budget bill is to be followed early next year with a tax-cutting measure worth $60 billion to $70 billion that will overwhelmingly favor big business and the wealthy.

20090226090042AAWbWzN	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	If you own half interest in a home and there is a mortgage but you didn't create the mortgage are you liable?	my son's name is on the mortgage along with his wife's' .They are divorcing.   He owed our family money and to clear the debt he signed over his portion of his home to my husband and myself (we were the original grantees of the home solely to him).....BEFORE the divorce papers were ever filed.  now the soon to be ex wife has voluntarily left the home and refuses to pay her portion of the mortgage.  She will not agree to rent the home , or sell the home. My question would be who is still responsible for the mortgage debt?  My son? Both of them?  Can you deed over a home that has a mortgage?  Our half ownership has not been contested by anyone including a judge at this point. So in this economy the best scenario would be to lease the house.  We have someone willing to do this and the payment would go directly to cover the mortgage , pay fire insurance and taxes. The wife is unwilling . Basically she wants us to lose it to foreclosure. Is there any hope in a situation like this. We don't want to have to hire a lawyer to represent us at this point but the wife won't budge and the payments aren't being met .Their credit is shot. Neither of them really cares . We hate to lose the house as it was my husband's home as a child. We deeded it as a gift to my son.  We thought we were giving our son a nice start in life by having a paid for home. He gave the fiancee half before they married .  A done deal. We can't contest the division of property. He did not think through property division and gifting before you marry. A hard lesson learned.  Thanks for any input or suggestions on where to go from here. (also the divorce has not been finalized because of the home)

20090226091321AAfr7oR	Politics & Government;Law Enforcement & Police	First Colorado cops were to stupid to solve the Ramsey murder, now this, what's wrong with them?	A good Samaritan who helped push three people out of the path of a pickup truck before being struck and injured has gotten a strange reward for his good deed: A jaywalking ticket.      Family members said 58-year-old bus driver Jim Moffett and another man were helping two elderly women cross a busy Denver street in a snowstorm when he was hit Friday night.      Moffett suffered bleeding in the brain, broken bones, a dislocated shoulder and a possible ruptured spleen. He was in serious but stable condition Wednesday.      The Colorado State Patrol issued the citation. Trooper Ryan Sullivan said that despite Moffett's intentions, jaywalking contributed to the accident.      Moffett had been driving his bus when the two women got off. In the interest of safety, he got out and, together with another passenger, helped the ladies cross.      Moffett's stepson, Ken McDonald, said the driver of the pickup plowed into his stepfather, but not before Moffett pushed the two women out of the way.      When he awoke in intensive care, he learned of the ticket. "His reaction was dazed and confused. I was a little angry," said McDonald.      The other man also was cited for jaywalking, while the pickup driver was cited with careless driving that led to injury. Sullivan said the two elderly women haven't been cited but the investigation is ongoing.
