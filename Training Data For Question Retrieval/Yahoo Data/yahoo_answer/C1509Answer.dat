AA11292270	I'm a lawyer and went to AA for nine years before leaving 18 months ago.  Thank you for your question.  <br>  <br>  Some people get the crazy idea that AA is religious after reading the Big Book and other AA literature, noting the constant references to God and the fact that "working" the program involves surrendering to God:  "God, I offer myself to thee--to build with me and to do with me as Thou wilt...." (Step 3, Big Book, Page 63).  Really, it is not a terribly huge leap of logic to read that sort of thing and conclude that there's some religion involved. <br>  <br>  Also, the US appellate courts which have considered the issue of the religious nature of 12 step groups are unanimous in their conclusion that forced participation in such programs violates the Establishment Clause (the constitutional provision requiring separation between church and state).  I'll quote a few of the court opinions on this point:<br>  <br>  In Griffin vs. Coughlin, the NW Court of Appeals (the highest state court in New York) held that under the Establishment Clause of the United States Constitution's First Amendment, an atheist or agnostic inmate may not be deprived of eligibility for expanded family visitation privileges for refusing to participate in AA.   To quote the court:  <br>  <br>  Doctrinally and as actually practiced in the 12-step methodology, adherence to the A.A. fellowship entails engagement in religious activity and religious proselytization. Followers are urged to accept the existence of God as a Supreme Being, Creator, Father of Light and Spirit of the Universe. In "working" the 12 steps, participants become actively involved in seeking such a God through prayer, confessing wrongs and asking for removal of shortcomings. These expressions and practices constitute, as a matter of law, religious exercise for Establishment Clause purposes.<br>  <br>  In Kerr vs. Farrey, the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals, again on establishment clause grounds, held that AA is a religious program and that inmates at a state correctional facility could not be forced to participate:<br>  <br>  The district court thought that the NA program escaped the "religious" label because the twelve steps used phrases like "God, as we understood Him," and because the warden indicated that the concept of God could include the non-religious idea of willpower within the individual. We are unable to agree with this interpretation. A straightforward reading of the twelve steps shows clearly that the steps are based on the monotheistic idea of a single God or Supreme Being. True, that God might be known as Allah to some, or YHWH to others, or the Holy Trinity to still others, but the twelve steps consistently refer to "God, as we understood Him." Even if we expanded the steps to include polytheistic ideals, or animistic philosophies, they are still fundamentally based on a religious concept of a Higher Power.<br>  <br>  And most recently (2007), in Inouye v. Kemna, the 9th circuit stated:<br>  <br>  The Hobson’s choice Nanamori offered Inouye [a buddhist] — to be imprisoned or to renounce his own religious beliefs — offends the core of Establishment Clause jurisprudence.<br>  <br>  Now, let me explain to you why I do not recommend that people go to 12 step groups.  First of all, and most importantly, there is no reliable evidence that they work.  If you read the research showing that the programs are helpful, you inevitably find that the research design is almost laughably flawed--none of them even have a control group!  The valid studies that have been done show that AA in general is about as effective as no treatment at all (and no improvement over no treatment = a 0% success rate), actually raises the level of binge drinking in some cases, and increases the death rate among dually diagnosed people (i.e. people who have mental health diagnoses in addition to addiction).<br>  <br>  Second of all, the horrors I personally witnessed over my nine years of AA membership make it impossible for me to suggest that anyone go to those meetings.  During those nine years, I saw many more people relapse and die than I ever saw get sober.  Beyond the constant relapses and deaths, there were sickening tragedies including heartbreaking abuses by sexual predators and the dreadful practice of convincing dually diagnosed people to stop taking their psychiatric medications.  You can't imagine how I felt right before I left AA, holding a sick, shaking woman in my arms who'd relapsed after following her sponsor's orders to stop taking her bipolar meds.  <br>  <br>  To be honest with you, I think the irresponsible people involved in this debate are the ones who continue to promote 12 step groups as benevolent organizations.  They are not.  They do more harm than good, and yet they constitute 90-95% of the treatment available in the US.|`|oUBUWfS6aa	NA and AA are support programs. Researching it wouldn't harm.<br>  <br>  Obviously, no one that never experienced with being addict  don't know any thing they go through.

It serves and honors God whose body I honor when honoring other people.  It gets my mind off of myself.  It also puts my own troubles into perspective.  What I mean by the last comment is that my burdens are fitted to me.  Other people's burdens seem just so terribly difficult to me.  When I compare my own situation to the difficulties of others I always seem to come out ahead.  How they can carry their weight is unimaginable to me.  People always surprise me with their strength.|`|sGn4FVqKaa	My answer is no. It doesn't make your own problems easier, it just puts them farther from the forefront of your mind - so you perceive them as less than they are b/c you aren't focusing on them. When the day comes you have no one else' problems to fixate on, yours will come crashing down around you and most likely get the better of you.<br>  <br>  I read the story and it was beautiful. Very strong message there. Oddly, I had many burdens in life before I took on others' and I find also, the opposite to be true. After struggling and growing through my burdens I found the strength to take on all the burdens of others. My friends and family look to me in all their hardships for support. So which then is better?|`|vQ75GgNnaa	I like the story, but be careful that you don't end up neglecting yourself for the sake of others.<br>  Even Jesus needed time for him self and away from the world.<br>  I think that you need to sort yourself out first and then dedicate time to others, but this doesn't mean that you don't have to do anything for others beforehand.<br>  I have experienced being used by some people for being too helpful, Balance is the keyword.

Neither can you believe that you don't have a 'privileged place' in the cosmic scheme of things.

In other words, the payoff is not zero.<br>  <br>  For one thing, if you go through life believing a lie, that is a bad thing in itself. Besides that, there is more to being a believer than just saying "Okay, I believe now" and getting on with your life. Serious believers spend a lot of their time in church, and contribute a lot of money as well. There's a reason why some towns have very affluent looking buildings for churches, and why large and elaborate cathedrals are possible: they're funded by folks who donate a tenth of their income throughout their lives to tithing. This is surely quite a waste if the object of worship isn't real.<br>  <br>  That's to say nothing of the persecution of other groups that's been instigated in the name of God throughout the ages. Also, in the US, churches don't have to pay taxes, which includes property tax. Property tax is what goes to schools, so all the land that churches own is sucking money out of schools.<br>  <br>  When "God Did It" becomes an acceptable answer, there is little incentive to continue exploring the question. More damaging, the "success" of this theory encourages one to apply it to other areas of human understanding. Practiced in this manner, theism can actively discourage human knowledge by compelling people to follow an arbitrary code of conduct, rather than one based on logic and reason.<br>  <br>  Which religion?<br>  <br>  Even if you buy into Pascal's Wager and decide you should believe, that doesn't give any basis for choosing which religion to believe in. Fundamentalists often use the wager to prove that you should be a Fundamentalist, but of course, Pascal was Catholic and was using it to prove you should be a Catholic.<br>  <br>  This just highlights the whole problem of which religion is the right one. Since many Fundamentalists believe that Catholics are going to go to hell, Pascal's not much better off than an unbeliever. We don't know if the Jews are correct, or perhaps the Muslims, or if reincarnation is right. The best wager, it seems, would be to choose the religion with the worst punishment for non-belief and the best reward for belief.|`|bVHnNqzBaa	No fear, no heaven, no hell.<br>  <br>  Doesn't it just irritate you that we atheists can live our lives without fear of those two fictional destinations?

He wants you to believe in him and have faith in him.|`|Tcu14CVraa	Pascal's Wager is an invalid reason to believe in God. <br>  <br>  And even if it was, just because it might be "wiser" to believe in God just in case he exists, it doesn't mean we actually can. Even if I wanted to believe in God, given the current available evidence, I simply can't. It's not something I can force myself to believe. <br>  <br>  Try forcing yourself to believe that the Flying Spaghetti Monster is real. You know, just in case. I bet you can't no matter how hard you try.|`|Q0r4YK3taa	There's no such thing as hell...<br>  When pronouncing sentence upon Adam, Jehovah stated: "Dust you are and to dust you will return." (Genesis 3:19) Where was Adam before God formed him from the dust of the ground and gave him life? Why, he simply did not exist! When he died, Adam returned to that state of complete absence of life. The condition of the dead is made clear at Ecclesiastes 9:5, 10, where we read: "The dead know nothing . . . In the grave, where you are going, there is neither working nor planning nor knowledge nor wisdom." (New International Version) Scripturally, death is a state of nonexistence. The dead have no awareness, no feelings, no thoughts.<br>  <br>  Since the dead have no conscious existence, hell cannot be a fiery place of torment where the wicked suffer after death. What, then, is hell? Examining what happened to Jesus after he died helps to answer that question. The Bible writer Luke recounts: "Neither was [Jesus] forsaken in Hades [hell, King James Version] nor did his flesh see corruption."* (Acts 2:31) Where was the hell to which even Jesus went? The apostle Paul wrote: "I handed on to you . . . that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures; and that he was buried, yes, that he has been raised up the third day according to the Scriptures." (1 Corinthians 15:3, 4) So Jesus was in hell, the grave, but he was not abandoned there, for he was raised up, or resurrected.<br>  <br>  Gehenna occurs 12 times in the Christian Greek Scriptures, and it refers to the valley of Hinnom, outside the walls of Jerusalem. When Jesus was on earth, this valley was used as a garbage dump, "where the dead bodies of criminals, and the carcasses of animals, and every other kind of filth was cast." (Smith's Dictionary of the Bible) The fires were kept burning by adding sulfur to burn up the refuse. Jesus used that valley as a proper symbol of everlasting destruction.<br>  <br>  As does Gehenna, the lake of fire symbolizes eternal destruction. Death and Hades are "hurled into" it in that they will be done away with when mankind is freed from sin and the condemnation of death. Willful, unrepentant sinners will also have their "portion" in that lake. (Revelation 21:8) They too will be annihilated forever. On the other hand, those in God's memory who are in hell—the common grave of mankind—have a marvelous future.<br>  <br>  Also, not everyone goes to heaven....<br>  To begin with, the Bible states that only a limited number of faithful Christians—namely, 144,000 of them—are raised as spirit creatures to live in heaven. Why are they given this wonderful reward? Because they make up the group that John saw in a vision who "came to life and ruled as kings with the Christ for a thousand years." (Revelation 14:1, 3; 20:4-6) Compared with the billions on earth, the 144,000 truly are a "little flock." (Luke 12:32) Moreover, having experienced the problems common to humankind, like Jesus they will be able to "sympathize with our weaknesses" as they supervise the rehabilitation of mankind and of the earth.—Hebrews 4:15.<br>  <br>  By providing the ransom sacrifice of Jesus Christ, God began gathering the 144,000 almost 2,000 years ago, and indications are that this group is now complete. (Acts 2:1-4; Galatians 4:4-7) However, Jesus' sacrifice was not for the sins of the 144,000 only, "but also for the whole world's." (1 John 2:2) Hence, all who exercise faith in Jesus have the prospect of eternal life. (John 3:16) Those asleep in the grave but who are in God's memory will be resurrected, not to heaven, but to life on a cleansed earth. (Ecclesiastes 9:5; John 11:11-13, 25; Acts 24:15) What will await them there?<br>  <br>  Revelation 21:1-4 answers, saying: "Look! The tent of God is with mankind . . . And he will wipe out every tear from their eyes, and death will be no more, neither will mourning nor outcry nor pain be anymore. The former things have passed away." Imagine—humans being released from death, and the pain and outcry it causes gone forever! At last, Jehovah's original purpose for the earth and humankind will reach its glorious fulfillment.—Genesis 1:27, 28.

And so the research is actually being funded.<br>  <br>  And so I don't know what all these so-called advocates really want.

qRue8Xdraa	60%-80% of all fertilized eggs spontaneously abort, often before the woman knows a conception ever took place. If there is a God, he's the biggest abortionist of all, since about 3/4ths of all "potential humans" end up in somebody's Tampax. He doesn't appear to have had much concern for infants or children either. Up until fairly recently, 25% of all pregnancies carried to term ended in the deaths of the mothers, with the babies often not too far behind. It was rare up until this century for a family, even with eight or more births, to have more than two children survive to adulthood, because childhood diseases took such a heavy toll. It took the ingenuity of man to come up with vaccines to eliminate most of those early deaths. Unfortunately, they still happen all-too-often in third world countries. Every 2.5 seconds, a child under the age of five dies due to starvation or preventable diseases. So much for "God will provide."<br>  <br>  And if an all-knowing, all-powerful God like the one worshipped in the Judeo-Christian actually existed, he would or at least should know which women would or would not welcome a pregnancy at this particular point in her life. If he puts fetuses in or bestows fertility on such women anyway, then he is at least partly to blame. After all, he should know what will most likely happen to that fetus. Not much of a "gift from God" when it's unwanted, but luckily, gifts are returnable.|`|7KjHEanCaa	Jewish law not only permits, but in some circumstances requires abortion. Where the mother's life is in jeopardy because of the unborn child, abortion is mandatory.<br>  <br>  An unborn child has the status of "potential human life" until the majority of the body has emerged from the mother. Potential human life is valuable, and may not be terminated casually, but it does not have as much value as a life in existence. The Talmud makes no bones about this: it says quite bluntly that if the fetus threatens the life of the mother, you cut it up within her body and remove it limb by limb if necessary, because its life is not as valuable as hers. But once the greater part of the body has emerged, you cannot take its life to save the mother's, because you cannot choose between one human life and another.|`|UiUSsfuYaa	The Bible never specifically addresses the issue of abortion. However, there are numerous teachings in Scripture that make it abundantly clear what God’s view of abortion is. Jeremiah 1:5 tells us that God knows us before He knits us in the womb. Psalm 139:13-16 speaks of God’s active role in our creation and formation in the womb. Exodus 21:22-25 prescribes the same penalty of someone who causes the death of a baby in the womb as the penalty for someone who commits murder. This clearly indicates that God considers a baby in the womb as just as much of a human being as a full-grown adult. For the Christian, abortion is not a matter of a woman’s right to choose. It is a matter of the life or death of a human being made in God’s image (Genesis 1:26-27; 9:6).|`|zmVCqh7Daa	People talk for abortion and people talk of anti-abortion. Bible takes a very stand on abortion and I admit that the word "abortion" is not used in the Bible. However, the word "abortion" is a later addition to the language. The word "abortion" is translated as, Pregnancy lost before the fetus can survive independently. IVF Fertility Glossary<br>  <br>  According to American Heritage Dictionary, Abortion is derived from the noun abort, which means, "to cease growth before full development or maturation," <br>  <br>  The child is alive and Bible calls "abortion" it a murder"If men strive, and hurt a woman with child, so that her fruit depart from her, and yet no mischief follow: he shall be surely punished, according as the woman's husband will lay upon him; and he shall pay as the judges determine. And if any mischief follow, then thou shalt give life for life," (Exodus 21:22-23)If we look at the verse, it talks of a woman losing her baby due to mischief. We can say that mischief if translated in the modern language it would become willful act by a human being to kill a child. God calls this act as murder and no further discussion is required here. <br>  <br>  Now let us see how abortion becomes a willful act:<br>  <br>  Suction Type<br>  This is where the unborn child is literally vacuumed from the mother's womb during the early stages of pregnancy.<br>  <br>  Currette-Type<br>  Is an abortion where the child is cut from the mother's womb with a spoon-like object.<br>  <br>  Caesarean Operation<br>  The baby is surgically removed from the mother and allowed to suffocate, because the child's lungs aren't developed. <br>  <br>  Salt Brine Technique<br>  With this method, the unborn child is literally "pickled" to death by the injection of a strong salt solution. A few days after the injection the child is still born.<br>  <br>  Partial Abortion<br>  This is where a child is partially delivered, then stabbed in the skull to have his or her brains sucked out. <br>  <br>  You can make out whether this is a murder or not, for me the Bible calls it a murder and also sets a punishment too and the punishment is death penalty. <br>  <br>  I watch documentaries on Animal Planet and people take great pride in showing their videos how they are saving wildlife. I am amazed people are more interested in saving animals and treat unborn babies worse than animals. <br>  <br>  Conclusion<br>  There would be no need to Abortion, if people leave their evil ways. Most cases of abortion as per record, are those who live as partners and do not want Liability over their shoulders. <br>  <br>  If we leave our lustful ways, there would be no abortions. Instead of taking out the root cause, we are encouraging people to carry on their sinful lives and justify these acts as calling them "Oh! these are youthful lusts and everyone has tasted it". <br>  <br>  Poor reasoning for a heinous sin, that not only destroys a life but makes a woman a slut, a man a rapist, murderer and leading others to sin. If we look at Exodus 21, then all the doctors and pro-abortionists are equally responsible of murdering children.|`|JXzqhYDSaa	In the Bible is doesn't exactly say abortion is wrong but.... <br>  <br>  Is killing a person wrong?

hzMpdFFBaa	Karma means "action." It used to refer to tending to one's religious obligations in the Hindu religion. Then it began to mean gaining merit or demerit based on your actions.  Some people interpret the law of karma to be a tit-for-tat, thinking that if you do somehthing "bad"  then sometime bad will happen to you and if you do something good, something good will happen. This is a very simplistic idea of "karma." Karma is simply a way to explain the law of cause and effect and to have people be mindful that actions have consequences. There is no one there to judge what action is right or not,. No one metes out punishment or reward. Actions simply have reactions that in turn have reactions. This is called momentum and one action following the next is what Time is.  Actions and  reactions can be either pleasant or painful , beneficial or destructive, wise or foolish (not necessarily "good" or "bad").|`|yMVdKHhmaa	Karma depends on Which belief system your referring to Buddhism or Hinduism.<br>  mostly I think its to do with cause and effect, if you do something wrong then you can expect a consequence.  there are times when an action will be brought into balance by some other force but that only really applies when we start abusing those forces around us by doing something we shouldn't simply because we can, a deliberate choice that goes against life.<br>  <br>  Negative thoughts will always lead to more negative thoughts this is well understood in psychology dealing with depression.|`|53d0ae94f9bd0c3e95a5bbfce4e2af07aa	Yes it can make the difference between the good & bad that you do in your life or the good & bad you did in your previous life.

Yes and no.  Yes because any sinner has the potential of becoming saved.  On the other hand, if the person is professing to be a Christian yet is unrepentantly practicing homosexuality, then it would appear that he would not be saved.  1 John 2:4 says, "The one who says, “I have come to know Him,” and does not keep His commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him."  So, a homosexual can be saved, but once saved, the Spirit of God will move that person to repent of the sin of homosexuality.  If a person continues to unrepentantly practice homosexuality, promoting it, etc., then that person would not be demonstrating evidence of regeneration.<br>       But then again, a person could become saved, still fall into homosexuality, be convicted by the Spirit of the sin, all the while be seeking to break free from it.  So technically, in this last sense, he could be saved and be a homosexual -- not as a life style, but as in struggling against his sin which sometimes can get the best of him.  It would be like a drug addict becoming a Christian and still being hooked on drugs.  He would struggle against and still have the desire to participate in it.  <br>       I would say that a person who has professed Christ and is struggling against sin is demonstrating evidence of regeneration.  Remember, many people who become Christians still struggle with many of their old sins.  Even Paul struggled, "For the good that I wish, I do not do; but I practice the very evil that I do not wish," (Rom. 7:19).  We are not perfect and we must remember to be gracious to others, especially when they are stuck in an old sin, want to repent of it, and are trying to have victory over it.  This is when grace is need, not law.  But, of course, we are never to encourage or excuse a person's sin.  We must pray for them to attain full victory.<br>       Now, some Christians will state that once you become saved, you should automatically have victory over all your sins.  This is an unfortunate burden they place on many Christians because "perfection" becomes the standard for measuring whether or not they are Christians.  This can cause people to doubt their salvation.  While it is true that we have victory in many areas when we become saved, it is also true that we still struggle with many of our old sins.  Of course, it is never okay for us to go ahead and sin (Rom. 6:1-2).  We must always struggle for holiness.  But the fact is, like Paul, we sometimes do the things we don't want to do and don't do what we should.  It is our struggle against sin that demonstrates that we are regenerate since we are seeking to be holy as God is holy (1 Pet. 1:16).  <br>       Finally, it is no dead people who struggle for life.  Only those who are alive struggle.  Likewise, the dead in sin, the unregenerate do not struggle against their sins.  Christians do.|`|XN0cYCATaa	What does the Bible say about homosexuality?<br>  There are those who like to say that the Bible does not condemn homosexuality.  Various verses are cited (out of context) and the verses that people use to show that homosexuality is wrong are explained away.  The world wants to change God's words and meanings into something more suitable to its sinful desires.  Nevertheless, the truth stands:  The Bible condemns homosexuality as a sin. Let's look at what it says.<br>  <br>  Lev. 18:22, "You shall not lie with a male as one lies with a female; it is an abomination."1 <br>  <br>  Lev. 20:13, "If there is a man who lies with a male as those who lie with a woman, both of them have committed a detestable act; they shall surely be put to death. Their bloodguiltness is upon them" <br>  <br>  1 Cor. 6:9-10, "Or do you not know that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived; neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor homosexuals, 10nor thieves, nor the covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor swindlers, shall inherit the kingdom of God." <br>  <br>  Rom. 1:26-28, "For this reason God gave them over to degrading passions; for their women exchanged the natural function for that which is unnatural, 27and in the same way also the men abandoned the natural function of the woman and burned in their desire toward one another, men with men committing indecent acts and receiving in their own persons the due penalty of their error. 28And just as they did not see fit to acknowledge God any longer, God gave them over to a depraved mind, to do those things which are not proper."<br>  <br>  Homosexuality is clearly condemned by the Bible.   It goes against the created order of God.  He created Adam and then made a woman.  This is what God has ordained and it is what is right.  Unlike other sins, homosexuality has a severe judgment administered by God Himself. This judgment is simple: They are given over to their passions. That means that their hearts are allowed to be hardened by their sins (Romans 1:18ff). As a result, they can no longer see the error of what they are doing. Without an awareness of their sinfulness, there will be no repentance and trusting in Jesus. Without Jesus, they will have no forgiveness. Without forgiveness, there is no salvation.<br>  <br>  What should be the Christian's Response to the Homosexual?<br>  Just because someone is a homosexual does not mean that we cannot love him (or her) or pray for him (her). Homosexuality is a sin and like any other sin, it needs to be dealt with in the only way possible. It needs to be laid at the cross, repented of, and never done again.<br>  <br>  As a Christian, you should pray for the salvation of the homosexual the same you would any other person in sin. The homosexual is still made in the image of God -- even though he is in grave sin.  Therefore, you should show him same dignity as anyone else you come in contact with. However, this does not mean that you are to approve of their sin. Don't compromise your witness for a socially acceptable opinion that is void of godliness.|`|7KjHEanCaa	It doesn't consider the New Testament, but I think you will find it very useful.<br>  <br>  It is important to note, however, that it is homosexual acts that are forbidden, not homosexual orientation. Judaism focuses on a person's actions rather than a person's desires. A man's desire to have sex with another man is not a sin, so long as he does not act upon that desire. In fact, it could be said that a man who feels such desires but does not act upon them is worthy of more merit in that regard than a man who does not feel such desires at all, just as one who refrains from pork because it is forbidden deserves more merit than one who refrains from pork because he doesn't like the taste.|`|HqG4MDxGaa	The Dead Sea Scrolls. Those are ancient writings outside of the bible that condemn homosexuality and as far as I know, aren't a part of the actual bible, even though part of the Dead Sea Scrolls confirm stuff that's in the bible and is older than the written bible itself. <br>  <br>  Not to mention that there are no stories in the bible with a man married to a man or a woman married to a woman, which would suggest that it's against God's way. <br>  <br>  As for the question rather or not people are "born" that way, or socialized into that way, I'll let God answer that question. <br>  <br>  But instead of looking for "justification" for homosexuality, instead ask yourself WHY you feel the need to "justify" it. Have you prayed to God about it, in order to see rather or not it's a sin? <br>  <br>  I know what I say what seem harsh but I'm honestly only trying to help.

8kcbn1siaa	I think many of them were orphans, but I, for one, was still praying for those children.   But part of my prayer, (and possibly that of the parents) was "Lord, take them home with you where they will suffer no more and they will know your wondrous love." For many, the actual death was a kindness. However, the starvation was a despicable cruelty made possible by our greed, our unwillingness to alter our pampered lifestyles, and our nationalism (which concerns itself only for AMERICAN children).    Add to this the influence of Satan on the world, wars, fear, disease, ignorance, and selfish human nature, and you make a world where these evils continue.  So what happened to the children is that they were slowly murdered by our (corporate) sin. <br>  It is true that about 30,000 kids die poverty-related deaths each day. it is also true that if the U.S. and Europe would spend as much on starving kids as they do on their pets, the starvation would stop.<br>  God does not answer every prayer of every parent in the way that parent wants, and he still allows human depravity to show its ugly face.  Maybe the children are too innocent, too precious to God for Him to allow them to continue to live in such painful poverty.  Although I, too, grieve their suffering, as I think you do, I rest in the belief that this life (as hard as it may get) is a wink in the eye of eternity.  I can hardly wait to join those children someday. And every tear will be wiped away.<br>  <br>  Our finite human minds can not perceive the mind of God, or why he allows evil to flourish.

LUVBrg3Maa	Sure, Why not? It sounds like you're facing a situation of judgment, and we are not in the position to judge one another. If you open your heart to god and trust that he will assist you on your journey through life, you will not be failed. You must also realize that it is not your position to determine what is 'right' or 'wrong'. Your sins will be forgiven so why dwell upon them. Especially if they are not your sins. Try to enrich your life and learn from your mistakes and of those that surround you. Live and let live, enjoy life and don't let any insecurities get in the way of your or any others happiness. It will take a bigger person to wrap your arms around someone and forgive their sins and show them love and support, rather than question their decisions. That is what the appropriate thing would be. That is what Jesus would do.|`|3lnICFrgaa	I see nothing restricting that. <br>  <br>  However, not remarrying at all is another option to be considered seriously. 1 Cor 7:32-34a:<br>  <br>  32 I would like you to be free from concern.

What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder"<br>  <br>  <br>  Luke 16:18 <br>  "Whosoever putteth away his wife, and marrieth another, committeth adultery: and whosoever marrieth her that is put away from her husband committeth adultery"|`|ef7b5627ea09eab595bfe61385dabaefaa	There was a question posed on here some time ago, which asked, "Under what conditions is divorce God's will?" This was how this question was answered and it fits well in line with the question you asked.<br>  <br>  First, we must realize that Jehovah God is the creator of the human race and the Originator of the marital arrangement. Also, it is safe to say that since we are very limited as humans on all fronts, Jehovah knows better than any human what we need in order to have a successful marriage. The question is, will those who are married listen to the counsel found in God’s inspired Word the Bible and obey it instead of immediately ending the marriage once the couple encounters problems. <br>  <br>  All marriages WILL HAVE problems. It would be na?ve for a couple to expect a life of bliss. 1 Corinthians 7:28 candidly states that husbands and wives would have “tribulation in their flesh.” Why? Simply put, because husbands and wives are imperfect, and we are living in “critical times hard to deal with.” Even a compatible, spiritually-minded couple will face occasional problems. Romans 3:23: “For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.” Again, problems will indeed arise. The issue is how to resolve those issues. Some married couples have learned to handle problems rather than running from them because they view marriage as a sacred gift from Jehovah.<br>  <br>  In fact, Jesus said regarding married couples: “What God has yoked together let no man put apart.” (Matthew 19:6). Granted, living by that standard is not always easy. For instance, relatives and others – including some marriage counselors – who do not recognize Bible principles often encourage couples to separate or divorce on unscriptural grounds.<br>  <br>  Matthew 5:31, 32: “Moreover, it was said, ‘Whoever divorces his wife, let him give her a certificate of divorce.’ However, I (Jesus) say to you that everyone divorcing his wife, except on account of fornication, makes her a subject for adultery, and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery.<br>  <br>  Matthew 19:9, 10: “I say to you that whoever divorces his wife except on the ground of fornication, and marries another commits adultery. The disciples said to him (Jesus), if such is the situation of a man with his wife, it is not advisable to marry.” In other words, if you were married and ended up getting a divorce because of something other than adultery and if either one of you decide to marry someone else, you both would be committing adultery.<br>  <br>  Matthew 19:18: “You must not commit adultery.” However, if either the husband or wife commits “fornication,” the innocent mate is permitted, not required, to divorce their mate.<br>  <br>  Now back to your initial question: Under what conditions is divorce God’s will? Malachi 2:15, 16 says: “You people must guard yourselves respecting your spirit, and with the wife of your youth may no one deal treacherously. For he has hated a divorcing. Jehovah the God of Israel has said.” Yes, Jehovah God HATES a divorcing. Think about that word HATE for a second. What do you personally hate? Perhaps it is seafood because it makes you break out. Would it be your will to eat seafood? No. Similarly, is it Jehovah God’s will for married couples to divorce? No, because he HATES a divorcing.<br>  <br>  What lines of evidence do we have? Malachi 2:16 says: “For he has hated a divorcing, Jehovah the God of Israel has said.” Matthew 19:6 says: “What God has yoked together, let no man put apart.” Yes, Jehovah God wants married couples to stay together forever. That was his initial plan with Adam and Eve, to live forever and to populate the earth with perfect traits like theirs. However, we know that not to be the case today, or else we would still be living in that paradise. Since Jehovah wants couples to hold to their vows, it is unthinkable to believe that divorcing is in any way God’s will. Again the question remains, will married couples listen to the counsel found in God’s Word the Bible and apply it?<br>  <br>  Married couples will certainly benefit if they do. Jehovah stated to his ancient people (which couples can easily apply today): “O if only you would actually pay attention to my commandments! Then your peace would become just like a river and your righteousness like the waves of the sea.” (Isaiah 48:18) Adhering to the guidelines set out in the scriptures can bring success to a marriage.|`|ebQ4vuUnaa	I would say yes, but this is my own liberal Christian world I live in.<br>  <br>  Have a great evening!!<br>  <br>  Cinn =)|`|g4AAZRuxaa	No.

Each troop also gets a percentage, usually under $1 a box (more if you count the prizes they get for the sales).<br>  <br>  One of the Girl Scouts of the USA documents said Girl Scouts is spiritual rather than specifically religious. You do need to be able to promise to follow the promise and law, but that is your decision:<br>  <br>  From GSUSA<br>  <br>  The Girl Scout Promise<br>  <br>  On my honor, I will try:<br>       To serve God* and my country,<br>       To help people at all times,<br>       And to live by the Girl Scout Law.<br>  <br>  The Girl Scout Law<br>  <br>  I will do my best to be<br>       honest and fair,<br>       friendly and helpful,<br>       considerate and caring,<br>       courageous and strong, and<br>       responsible for what I say and do,<br>  and to<br>       respect myself and others,<br>       respect authority,<br>       use resources wisely,<br>       make the world a better place, and<br>       be a sister to every Girl Scout.<br>  <br>  * The word "God" can be interpreted in a number of ways, depending on one's spiritual beliefs. When reciting the Girl Scout Promise, it is okay to replace the word "God" with whatever word your spiritual beliefs dictate.<br>  <br>  And my comment: I had members of my old troop pledge to "serve Earth and my country" and no one even blinked. <br>  <br>  Edited to add: Those of you that lump Girl Scouts and Boy Scouts together, we are entirely different. Boy Scouts kick you out if you are gay or atheist, Girl Scouts embrace inclusiveness.|`|JQ3J5cdZaa	As far as I know Neither the Boy or Girl Scouts discriminate against Atheists.  I was a boy scout for many years and even achieved the rank of Eagle and was never asked about my religious beliefs, I was a non-practicing Jew at the time with mostly agnostic beliefs.  Some Atheists get all bent out of shape because the word "god" is in the scout oath but that kind of thing never bothered me.  The way I saw it, it says to do your duty to god so if you don't believe in him/she/it then you don't have any duty to him/she/it.|`|YfMvrdHNaa	I'm sitting here in amazment that you actually believe that the boy scouts would not allow a child to participate because the child professes to be atheist. <br>  <br>  Man o man you are one seriously deluded individual. My kid is in cub scouts, you are very mistaken.<br>  <br>  What's with you?<br>  <br>  You really wouldn't buy cookies from a kid based on something like this - you 'think' they discriminate? Wow, and to think, we look around and have to wonder why the world is such a nasty place.<br>  <br>  They are kids dude, KIDS, buy the damn cookies.|`|wD2f1ea2aa	Girl Scouts as an organization is extremely unclear on this issue.  I went on a troop trip to the Girl Scout birthplace in Savannah, Georgia, and the woman who was speaking to us said that Girl Scouts can be all religions, so long as they are not atheists.<br>  <br>  Additionally, the historian for my local council (Girl Scouts of Middle Tennessee) says that atheists cannot be Girl Scouts.<br>  <br>  That said, there has been at least one court case where a troop was told they MUST re-admit an atheist girl, and I was an atheist in the Girl Scouts for many years (and am currently agnostic).|`|3ccd31e0b38f18f3123974ce88fcb948aa	Are you also going to stop going to Wal-mart?

Could there be an individual troop that has an incident of such a thing? Yes, it surely could happen. But their policy is that any religion, race, creed, etc. is welcome within their program. <br>  <br>  You might also be interested to know that their official position on the question of homosexuality is that it is inappropriate for an adult leader to be discussing their sex life with the girls regardless. They basically look confused when asked for confirmation on this point and just say something like, "How would we ever know someone's sexual orientation?" <br>  <br>  Boy Scouts do have a policy that they are for people who believe in a god. Girl Scouts have no such policy and I can't imagine they ever would as that would completely go against what they stand for - which is equality for all and empowering girls.|`|4WqvTAfmaa	They are monotheist, more or less. But.<br>  <br>  I learned my first magic spells from them. I learned to love nature from them. I earned my way through the system and learned some aspects of ceremony from them. I learned to be comfortable with those of different beliefs from them. <br>  <br>  The cookie sale allows them to develop independent and responsible thinking. That often is not compatible with some versions of Christianity. It stimulates salesmanship, which can be used to sell cookies or beliefs or tolerance. <br>  <br>  Personally, they have not been the same since the Peanut Butter cookies were changed. But I still buy them when I can. (they don't canvass my neighborhood. Not very safe to do.)|`|5UJSX3vJaa	No, Girl Scouts does not discriminate what so ever.

I should know. I used to be a Girl Scout. <br>  <br>  Now, that being said, there does tend to be a common thread running through the various members of a troop, but it is usually because they all go to the same school. Occasionally, there is one where the girls all go to the same church, but all troops are going to be welcoming of any girl who can't find a troop at her own school or church. <br>  <br>  There is also actually a rising number of individual Girl Scouts. They don't belong to any particular troop, but they can still earn all the same badges. The handbook actually has a wide enough number of choices under the badge requirements so that any individual Girl Scout can earn a badge on her own if she can't find a troop at all to join. This was the case for me as I entered my cadet years. <br>  <br>  Get the thin mints or the shortbreads if you're going to buy some cookies. They're really the only two varieties still worth eating. But, if you're wanting the peanut butter patties, they are NOT affected by the current peanut butter warning.|`|muHctmaGaa	Various Girl Scout oaths allude to religion but are as innocuous as the rewritten Pledge of Allegiance. As an organization they do not discriminate against atheists, nor do they exclude homosexuals like the Boy Scouts. I would never support the Boy Scouts, but I don't mind a $5 box of samoas to a good egalitarian cause.<br>  <br>  Secularly speaking, those cookies aren't made with trans fat anymore.|`|4d16b72ffa495ae128ab9f89679fc203aa	Even though the GSA is a different organization than the BSA, it seems to have similar policies.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bsa-discrimination.org/html/gsusa-problems.html#921222" rel="nofollow">http://www.bsa-discrimination.org/html/g...</a><br>  <br>  Even though in 1993, they relaxed that policy to not define the word God in their pledge, the discrimination was still there for non-theists.|`|paRGbr7Xaa	Last time I checked, Girl Scouts didn't give a flying **** what your religion or non-religion is. And Brownies are a level of Girl Scout (Daises, Brownies, Juniors, Cadets, and Seniors). It's ok to buy the cookies.

9VJV2Dcvaa	Good question!! I was going to tell you that there were lot of translations and that probably in other Bibles it would be different but in the portuguese version is in the plural also!!!<br>  <br>  My opinion on the genesis (not only about this part of it) is that it has a lot of influence of the polytheist believes of the Egyptians... as you must know, the man who wrote the Genesis was Moses... who was raised among the egyptians.... try to compare the creation in the egyptian religion and the creation in the Bible and you will see many resemblances!!! It is a crazy thing to say, but you'll see that it makes sense!!! <br>  <br>  About this having any thing to do with the trinity.. I don't think so..... Moses lived way before Jesus to know about the father, the son and the holy spirit.... plus, the prayers that contain this trinity were all taught by Jesus!!!!!<br>  <br>  I hope I helped in anything!!

6aMeHzryaa	When Jesus gave us the our father he gave us the model for the Perfect prayer.  As far as praying to Mary this is false.  None of the saints would have you pray to them but to our Father through his son, period.  There are two very poignant verses which Jesus addresses his mother as woman.  Not the endearment with which you would address a woman to which you would want your followers to venerate upon your death and resurrection.  Another place where it would give clear evidence of not praying to the saints or even his mother.  When someone from the crowds pushed toward him and said, "your mother and brothers are outside,"  and he declared, "who are my mother and brothers?  I tell you the truth, those who do the will of my Father in heaven are my mother and brothers..."  In other words, his disciples were by their obedience in following, closer to his heart than his own blood family.  And in yet another place he states, "those who would have life will deny their family and follow me..."  And again he never called us into something, he wasn't doing himself, period.  Our prayers should be directed to the Father alone, through our faith in our risen messiah.  If you got bad service at a restaurant would you go in and talk to the waitress about it?  How absurd is that?  No, you'd ask to see the manager.  The same logic holds true here.  When a person tells me that they pray to the saints and Mary, I get the same impression as I would if a man went into the restraunt and gave the waitress the report he should give straight to the manager.  Silly hah?  Yet look at this and you can see it very clearly.  I don't know about you but if I need a mountain moved in my life, I'm not going to go to the one's who struggled with in the confines of this shell as I do;  I'm going to the main Dog, this is what my master did and this is what I will do, no matter how many promises the demons want to make through diverting our attention from God and onto the saints.  These people, were bought at the same price as you or I and if they truly could return and speak to us they would point to our father in heaven, just as our master did and just as I am doing so now.  As far as their promises, there is only one promise that counts and that is the hope of salvation in God through our obedient faith in his son, our messiah  Jesus Christ.<br>                          SO LET IT BE!|`|3lnICFrgaa	I'm a protestant, so I base my beliefs off of the core Bible, without the additions of Catholicism. <br>  <br>  Call it what you will, prayer to Mary and the Saints is essentially a modified version of ancient polytheistic paganism. This is not to discount all of Catholicism, for many still hold to Jesus as their one and ONLY salvation. However, any sort of worship or reliance on dead Christians, even Mary, is certainly not scriptural (not counting the additions, of course.)<br>  <br>  True "venerating" of these people is acceptable, as long as you're simply "honoring" them, as veneration denotes. To elevate them to any other position is a heresy.<br>  <br>  You will get divergent views on this, so definitely research the legitimacy of the Apocrypha before deciding on what to believe.|`|lgYnTXDmaa	people have different denominations, and Catholics believe in praying to mary. i'm not sure why because i'm not Catholic, i'm non-denominational, so i pray to god. the bible does say nobody comes to the father except through Jesus, so I believe in praying 2 God.|`|dj6FHy15aa	I'm baptist- Christian and we beleive that you pray to the father through the son,<br>  <br>  So you address God as you pray but when you finish you say in Jesus Nome or For Christ's sake, before you say Amen<br>  <br>  I'm not sure about the catholics.|`|6LYWanTRaa	Does prayer to Mary and other saints break commandment #3?

We do not know what we ought to pray for, but the Spirit himself intercedes for us with groans that words cannot express.  <br>  27 And he who searches our hearts knows the mind of the Spirit, because the Spirit intercedes for the saints in accordance with God’s will. <br>  <br>  1st John 5, verses 14 and 15:<br>  14 This is the confidence we have in approaching God: that if we ask anything according to his will, he hears us.  <br>  15 And if we know that he hears us—whatever we ask—we know that we have what we asked of him. <br>  <br>  Please do your own research.

They do not believe the Word of God is the only authority. They believe what the church teaches them over the scriptures. They believe those saints who are in heaven with the Lord are more loved by God and that God will listen to them more than the people on earth. They believe those who are in heaven are more worthy than those on earth because they are with God and the Catholics on earth will most likely have to go to purgatory to clean up their act before God will accept them. The Catholic religion knows nothing about true salvation by grace alone through faith alone in Christ alone. They have to earn their way to God through sacraments and rituals. <br>  <br>  Christians know that what the Catholics do in their religion and the things they believe and adhere to are an abomination to God and they also know the Catholics have many subtle forms of idolatry.

Are any Christians being terrorized by Satan’s secret society / NWO?<br>  Have you & your family members been threatened if you wont join, except one of there demonic "God's", live in complete silence and obedience, and go through the secret ceremony performed with transcendental meditation enforced by witchcraft / demonic forces? Have they threatened your employment by false accusations and the establishment of NWO members in management positions? Has the Illuminated masons 33 degree and below / eternally dammed used drug dealers and gang members to terrorize your neighbor hood in their pyramid system of government? When law enforcement is notified do they perform there duty's of service as servants of the people, or do they shine you off with rude comments acknowledging there affiliation with the "Free" Masons and involvement in the brotherhood / NWO? Has this “brotherhood of evil” / NWO / Satan's Secret Society spread like malignant cancer throughout society to the extent that it is going to take a act of God to surgically remove it? Why is it that the NWO doesn’t want the “HORN SIGN” being used to acknowledge there allegiance to Satan & his Secret society / NWO? Is it because shhhhh it’s a secret? The media has surly made an effort to try and eliminate it. Is G.W. the skull and cross bones men / “Free” Masons been informing the NWO to shut it’s pie hole so they can enforce Satan’s rule in complete secrecy? What do you think? Is this how Adolph Hitler and his German army / SS eliminated millions secretly in concentration camps? Have you run into the Nazis within the order & there SS? The cancer is here!!! Did you receive your spiritual mark and one way ticket to “HORROR & PAIN” for eternity?<br>  Is revelation 13, 10 referring to Satan's Secret society and spiritual captivity to Witchcraft?<br>  Has the NWO / Nazis Within the Order and its many branches such as the "Free" Masons / Shriner's / Mafia / New Age Movement, to name a few, distributed occult parafinallia into society to cause spiritual bondage / captivity to witchcraft and take people spiritually captive rev 13,10. Are Games such as Ouija boards, tarot cards, even the "8" ball with its pyramid in the middle a form of (divination)? Could role playing games such as Dungeons and Dragons be another method used to take people into captivity? Is magic art a method to lead victims into spiritual bondage, (which is the precursor to Transcendental meditation and the secret ceremony used for distributing the spiritual mark)? Has Harry Potter witchcraft books been distributed into society to lure people away from God and take captive to witchcraft? Deuteronomy 18, 9 strictly forbids these practices. Is it by  spiritual captivity caused from these practices that victims are forced with witchcraft to go through the secret ceremony of transcendental meditation were they are forced to except the worship of one of the many "Gods" of Satan’s Secret Society? They say that in accepting the worship of one you accept them all. These are no Gods at all but demonic entities, one including the Devil! Is this the method the Devil has set up for distributing his spiritual mark and enslaving society? Those who go into captivity into captivity they will go rev 13, 10. "Who enslaved nations by her witchcraft" Nahum 3, 4. "By your magic spell all nations were led astray". rev 18, 23 There is a way out!!! "Those who overcame, overcame by the blood of the lamb and the word of their testimony, they didn't love there own life's so much as to shrink from death". "This calls for patient endurance and faithfulness on the part of the saints". rev 12, 11. Are you aware that "the martyrs for Christ who don't receive what I believe to be the spiritual mark of the beast will come to life and reign with Christ for 1000 years during the millennium" rev.20, 4? Would you trade a short life on earth for a 1000 year reign with Jesus Christ and then so much more? Amen Brothers and sisters! Also, are you aware that this society has been in the process of being set up for a long time under the rule and wisdom of the Devil! Look up George Washington / Free Masons and the location of the Whitehouse and associated government buildings.

The sheer guilt should be a testament enough to abortion's "morality."|`|wsc96EDmaa	quite simply they view it as murder, to them this is like arguing that it would be okay to murder a 2 year old that was conceived by rape or incest.|`|xelkbdbdaa	What difference does it make... abortion is just a situational ethics argument... thou shalt not murder|`|AA10541249	Is that nine-year-old story made up? It's not physically or biologically possible... If that nine-year-old did get pregnant, her body would reject the fetus anyway. An abortion wouldn't have been necessary. And the child doesn't have to remind the mother of the terrible incident every day. Why are abortionists so adamant against adoption? People are placed on waiting lists for years before receiving a child. Of course, the whole argument that there is no guarantee the parents will be good to the child arises. But then again, I'm pretty sure that if you wait on a list for years to receive a child, you must have some good within you and a strong desire to provide for something you probably can't have yourself. I just think abortions are slightly narrow-minded and selfish. The argument that pregnant teenage girls suffer through school is also an invalid argument. If I were a pregnant teenager, I think the stigma of conceiving the child would be far more bearable than the stigma of being called a "baby killer." Even if I didn't believe myself to be a "baby killer," I don't think I'd be able to handle that. I don't know, I might just be arrogant, but logically, it seems to make more sense to have the child than to kill it.<br>  <br>  (Edit) I just had a radical thought I feel like writing down. Just a hypothetical. So after this abortion matter is settled and there is no more controversy over whether women should be allowed to have an abortion. I mean it becomes an acceptable practice. Why not allow mothers to abort their children after birth? I mean, if they should have the choice to abort it in the womb, why not outside? Then children will never become an inconvenience because as soon as they do, they can be aborted. Instead of allowing that nine-year-old to abort her baby, the mother of the nine-year-old can just abort her daughter. I think that would be a fantastic step in the right direction.|`|GWRP3vLQaa	Most people don't oppose abortion in the case of rape or incest. The problem is MOST abortions are not done for either of these reasons, but rather because somone didn't bother to practice safe sex. <br>  <br>  Abortion is not the same as birth control, and focusing on the relatively rare cases of rape or incest as a justification for unfettered abortion rights is irresponsible.|`|AA11232725	When someone commits a crime people have to suffer. It isn't fair, it's just the way that it is. So the question becomes, is it justifiable to kill an unborn child for what someone else did? Does it make it OK to kill an innocent victim so that the mother can perhaps minimize the consequences that she already has to suffer for the unlawful act of another person? Moreover, how do we know for sure that having an abortion won't haunt the victim of rape or incest and actually add to the suffering caused by the crime?<br>  <br>  The only safe thing to do is to realize that two wrongs don't make a right and to come alongside the mother and help her to deal with her abuse and the new responsibility that resulted from it.|`|t0mb150gaa	People should have the choice regardless of the situation and especially in those cases. However most people are against things they truly don't understand and that is the case of anti-abortion extremists. They have never had to walk in the shoes of a woman who was raped and now pregnant so it is easy for them to pass judgement and make choices that aren't theirs to make.

I hope you find these helpful.<br>  <br>  Acts 17:28: “By him [God] we have life and move and exist.”<br>  <br>  Ps. 36:9: “With you [Jehovah God] is the source of life.”<br>  <br>  Rom. 14:12: “Each of us will render an account for himself to God.”<br>  <br>  Ps. 139:13-16: “You [Jehovah] kept me screened off in the belly of my mother. .?.?. Your eyes saw even the embryo of me, and in your book all its parts were down in writing.”<br>  <br>  Ex. 21:22,?23: “In case men should struggle with each other and they really hurt a pregnant woman and her children do come out but no fatal accident occurs, he is to have damages imposed upon him without fail according to what the owner of the woman may lay upon him; and he must give it through the justices. But if a fatal accident should occur, then you must give soul for soul.” (Some translations make it appear that in this law to Israel the crucial matter was what happened to the mother, not to the fetus. The original Hebrew text, however, refers to a fatal accident to either mother or child.)<br>  <br>  Gen. 9:6: “Anyone shedding man’s blood, by man will his own blood be shed, for in God’s image he made man.”<br>  <br>  1?John 3:15: “No manslayer has everlasting life remaining in him.”<br>  <br>  Ex. 20:13: “You must not murder.”<br>  <br>  Ps. 127:3: "Look! Sons are an inheritance from Jehovah;<br>  The fruitage of the belly is a reward."<br>  <br>  Isaiah 49:15: "Can a wife forget her suckling so that she should not pity the son of her belly? Even these women can forget, yet I myself shall not forget you."|`|eO2rnf7yaa	If you value fairness,  which you seem to say you do,  you should be fair to the woman and the other human creature involved in abortion.  One of the human creatures is scheduled to be put to death in an abortion.  That is gravely unfair.   The intentional killing of an innocent human creature  does not undo rape or incest.    <br>  <br>  I am Roman Catholic.<br>  I think abortion is gravely disrespectful to the dignity of women.<br>  I hope and pray that all victims of abortion - those who die immediately, and their parents, will be reconciled with each other and with God in eternity.|`|78a004f4953e767d0c2c36ffd1bf1c39aa	So, we can kill because we are victimized?  My wife and I decided a long time ago if she were raped the child would be ours.  If any person deserves abortion it is the person that rapes another.  You are right it is too hard to tell the child they were a product of hate and anger so killing is the only adoption.  You forget that because the child is kept and loved they are a product of love and mercy not hate.<br>  <br>  For incest I still believe the child deserves the right to live and be put up for adoption.|`|1TYZDRUqaa	IJR believes there are valid options other than Abortion, and IF ASKED, IJR would discuss these with the woman.

So you would be willing to kill a child over one little word? In either case, it's a beautiful child who is just as deserving to live as the next.  The rapist unwittingly, and unknowingly gave the woman a beautiful gift. God can take bad situations and turn them into something wonderful. Carrying the baby to term also helps a woman heal psychologically from the rape, because it turns her attention to someone else who needs her rather than on herself. No woman, even if she was raped, can look into that sweet face and wish that she had killed him/her.  As far as "having to look at a child who looks like her father" is just plain hogwash. That baby is also HALF HER! <br>  You don't just kill someone just because you're "afraid" of what you're going to have to tell them someday! That's cowardly and selfish! There is absolutely NO good reason to abort a child just because the father wasn't whom the mother wanted. A baby is a baby.|`|PcGvS4Xuaa	Whether or not people should die is not our decision. God makes us, God takes us away. The death penalty is justice, but abortion is not justice. God never said life would be easy, and two wrongs don't make a right. I don't think anyone would argue that incest and rape aren't despicable, because the consequences of those sins are worse than the rest of us could ever imagine, and God will have His vengeance for that. Many children are glad to be here, though they were children of rape. My best friend is a good example. Her mother gave her up for adoption and she not only strongly supports adoption, but is strongly pro-life.|`|zjf1volaaa	The only abortion I am against is women who have unprotected sex, on their own free will and everything, wind up pregnant and realize they are not "ready" to be a mother yet so they get an abortion.

I just belive the woman has a choice, it's her body too.|`|jjDZJmfpaa	But no one knows what that child will do and the purpose for the existence of that child. If the child has no purpose then, it will not live. Those sorts of things have happened too. But if the woman has no desire to care for the child, with so many parents not able to bare children, this would be a perfect avenue for those parents to care for  a child without all of the stigmas attached. The health of the surviving woman is not in jeopardy if she receives adequate counseling. Too many think to do a microwave answer for a slow cooker solution.<br>  <br>  In Christianity we are given a choice. The Word tells us that life and death are in the power of the tongue (Proverbs 18:21). Then we are given the best answer, choose life Deuteronomy 30:19). So if this is what we choose as our lifestyle in the faith, why then would we choose differently because of unfavorable circumstances? God is good (3 John 1:11). So cast the care over on Him instead of baring the burden (1 Peter 5:7).|`|JXVhVODcaa	I think that the only exception should be if the girl was super young like 12 or 13.<br>  I know that the pregnancy would be complete hell, but is it really worst having the guilt of killing an innocent person<br>  Plus, there's always adoption.|`|YfMvrdHNaa	I agree that women should have a choice in these situations.<br>  <br>  However, very few abortions are because of these situations.

We are no longer allowed to pray in public for fear we may offend someone. Although, isn't that why this entire country was founded? To escape religious persecution. To have the right to choose your own religion and believe what you want to. I personally believe that if a woman chooses to have an abortion and can live with the decision she has made, go for it. It is not our job to judge someone for their actions, isn't that a job for God. However, until we get back to the good ole days, before we feared what people of other beliefs might find offensive, and realize that we are all one under God whether we are baptist, catholic, jewish, or muslims. We must trust in God that he will assist us through our difficult time and share with us our happy times and that our sins will be forgiven. Then we will be able to embrace those for their decisions and forgive them and love them, for who they are and not who we (or God) would want them to be. Then maybe a woman will be able to have an abortion without people believing that it is 'wrong' and instead they will see a woman who is struggling and needs the help, love, and support of others.|`|urs9AxiGaa	Simply said...... They are obnoxious humans. See, if it happened to them or someone close to them (God Forbid) then they would probably abort in secrecy. : O : O : O<br>  <br>  People love to say...."Oh, but there's always adoption" <br>  What the hell good would that do, kids that are put into the system usually have to indoor rape, molestation, physical, verbal and sexual abuse.

Wilt thou then not be afraid of the power? do that which is good, and thou shalt have praise of the same: 4 For he is the minister of God to thee for good.

In that case, only the "law" in the New Testament applies...and since there is for all practical purpose no "law" in the New Testament, all the arguments about christian "morality" go bye-bye.<br>  <br>  You can't have it both ways...<br>  <br>  Peace.|`|Rn4GXoJAaa	Romans 13<br>  Submission to the Authorities <br>   1Everyone must submit himself to the governing authorities, for there is no authority except that which God has established. The authorities that exist have been established by God. 2Consequently, he who rebels against the authority is rebelling against what God has instituted, and those who do so will bring judgment on themselves. 3For rulers hold no terror for those who do right, but for those who do wrong. Do you want to be free from fear of the one in authority? Then do what is right and he will commend you. 4For he is God's servant to do you good. But if you do wrong, be afraid, for he does not bear the sword for nothing. He is God's servant, an agent of wrath to bring punishment on the wrongdoer. 5Therefore, it is necessary to submit to the authorities, not only because of possible punishment but also because of conscience. 6This is also why you pay taxes, for the authorities are God's servants, who give their full time to governing. 7Give everyone what you owe him: If you owe taxes, pay taxes; if revenue, then revenue; if respect, then respect; if honor, then honor.

Let's look at the entire passage, shall we?<br>  <br>  Romans 1:21-32 "21 For although they knew God, they neither glorified him as God nor gave thanks to him, but their thinking became futile and their foolish hearts were darkened. 22 Although they claimed to be wise, they became fools 23 and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images made to look like mortal man and birds and animals and reptiles. <br>  <br>   24 Therefore God gave them over in the sinful desires of their hearts to sexual impurity for the degrading of their bodies with one another. 25 They exchanged the truth of God for a lie, and worshiped and served created things rather than the Creator—who is forever praised. Amen. <br>  <br>   26 Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural ones. 27 In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their perversion. <br>  <br>   28 Furthermore, since they did not think it worthwhile to retain the knowledge of God, he gave them over to a depraved mind, to do what ought not to be done. 29 They have become filled with every kind of wickedness, evil, greed and depravity. They are full of envy, murder, strife, deceit and malice. They are gossips, 30 slanderers, God-haters, insolent, arrogant and boastful; they invent ways of doing evil; they disobey their parents; 31 they are senseless, faithless, heartless, ruthless. 32 Although they know God's righteous decree that those who do such things deserve death, they not only continue to do these very things but also approve of those who practice them."<br>  <br>  In this passage it is clear that Paul is talking about people who knew God but worshipped idols instead.  It is not talking about people who know and worship God even if they happen to be homosexual.  There are gay people who are Christian, and this passage does not talk about them.<br>  <br>  Maybe you are an idol worshipper with a "reprobate mind", so I wouldn't want you around children.

They are usually taught from an early age to dislike or hate people who are too different from themselves.<br>  <br>  The lyrics from a song from the musical "South Pacific" portray such feelings towards people who are different...<br>  <br>  You've got to be taught<br>  To hate and fear,<br>  You've got to be taught<br>  From year to year,<br>  It's got to be drummed<br>  In your dear little ear<br>  You've got to be carefully taught.<br>  <br>  You've got to be taught to be afraid<br>  Of people whose eyes are oddly made,<br>  And people whose skin is a diff'rent shade,<br>  You've got to be carefully taught.<br>  <br>  You've got to be taught before it's too late,<br>  Before you are six or seven or eight,<br>  To hate all the people your relatives hate,<br>  You've got to be carefully taught!
8I9uduIiaa	Perfectly worded question :)<br>  <br>  <br>  The answer is that it really depends on which group within Judaism you speak with. Reform Jews, for instance, don't adhere as literally to the Torah as more religious Jews. Thus you will find openly Gay Rabbis in Reform and also Progressive Synagogues. My Synagogue, in fact, when I was growing up, had a Gay Rabbi :)<br>  <br>  Conservative Judaism is a bit more rigid and Orthodox is far more religious, so I don't think they have Gay Rabbis BUT I don't think there would be any discrimination against Gay Jews - I sincerely hope not!<br>  <br>  The only time I've ever, ever heard rumours of any type of problem with being a Gay Jew is in a few of the Ultra, Ultra Orthodox Jewish groups. <br>  <br>  Hope that helps to answer a bit :)<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://jewishanswerstochristianquestions.wordpress.com" rel="nofollow">http://jewishanswerstochristianquestions...</a>|`|d0f93ace5169bf1fc1696345cdb101c2aa	Reform Judaism certainly does.  Interestingly, R.E. Friedman, in his new (and brilliant) translation of the Torah ("Commentary on the Torah") makes an interesting point.  The word used in Leviticus 18:22, "to-ebah", often translated as "an abomination" is used elsewhere in the Torah as a **relative** term which varies according to human perception.  For example, the same word is used in Genesis 46:34 by Joseph to indicate that a shepherd is an "offensive thing" to the Egyptians--but it was clearly *not* offensive to Joseph and his brothers.  Friedman argues, therefore, that the prohibition against homosexuality is binding only **as long as** it is perceived to be offensive, and therefore the current state of scientific evidence suggests that the period in which this commandment was binding has come to an end.<br>  <br>  Just something to think about.|`|oGVMEXR7aa	Reform and conservative jews usually accept them, but not orthodox|`|7Suz37Wiaa	Reform Jews accept it.|`|LIGYejglaa	Kabbalistically, homosexuality results from an imbalance of female/male forces in the spirit.<br>  <br>  There are some homosexuals at my synagogue.

There is no condemnation of homosexuality in the Tanakh. What you see in the English Old Testament are deliberate mistranslations of the Tanakh.<br>  <br>  (Even the ancient Jewish commentaries on Sodom never mention homosexuality as a cause of the city's destruction.

That's not true.<br>  <br>  It's ALWAYS been interpreted that the sin of Sodom was homosexuality, always!<br>  <br>  Liberal reading of scriptures have lead some modern readers to conclude that fornication and sexual sins are actually condemnations on narrow sins - the justification goes something like this.  The word "Fornication" means to be "under the porches" - so some say that it doesn't prohibit premarital sex (or whatever action they seek to justify) - however it's never once used to literally mean "going under a porch" but in the vernacular of it's time meant any extramarital sex.<br>  <br>  The Mitzvote have nearly 90 rules associated with sexuality and numerous among those are rules outlawing anything we would consider homosexuality. It even says that men can't dress as women.<br>  <br>  Clearly the Old Testament is against homosexuality as it is any sex outside of marriage - we know this because they didn't allow any sexual misconduct in their society ruled by religion.  There is no good case for the claim made by the poster who said that it's not prohibited.<br>  <br>  There are some forms of modern Judaism who do accept it, but for many of them Judaism has become more of a ancestry and community and less of a religion.

That large headline appeared on the front page of a widely circulated newspaper after a devastating earthquake in Asia Minor. An accompanying picture showed a distraught father carrying his injured daughter out of their collapsed home.<br>  <br>  Wars, famines, epidemics, and natural disasters have caused immeasurable pain, innumerable tears, and countless deaths. Add to this the suffering of victims of rape, child abuse, and other crimes. Consider the huge number of injuries and deaths resulting from accidents. And there is the anguish experienced by billions of people because of sickness, old age, and the death of loved ones.<br>  <br>  The 20th century saw the worst suffering ever. From 1914 to 1918, World War I killed nearly ten million soldiers. Some historians say that it brought death to just as many civilians. In World War II, about 50 million combatants and civilians were killed, including millions of defenseless women, children, and elderly men. Throughout the last century, millions more were the victims of genocide, revolution, ethnic violence, hunger, and poverty. The Historical Atlas of the Twentieth Century estimates that over 180 million people died because of such "mass unpleasantness."<br>  <br>  The Spanish influenza of 1918/19 killed 20 million people. In the last two decades, about 19 million died from AIDS, and some 35 million now have the virus that causes it. Millions of children are left without parents—they died from AIDS. And untold numbers of babies are dying from AIDS, passed on to them when they were still in the womb.<br>  <br>  More suffering is being inflicted on children in other ways. Citing information provided by the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), at the end of 1995, England's Manchester Guardian Weekly stated: "In the wars of the past decade, 2 million children have been killed, 4-5 million disabled, 12 million made homeless, more than 1 million orphaned or separated from their parents and 10 million psychologically traumatised." Add to this an estimated 40 to 50 million abortions worldwide—every year!<br>  <br>  What of the Future?<br>  <br>  Many view the future with foreboding. A group of scientists stated: "Human activities . . . may so alter the living world that it will be unable to sustain life in the manner that we know." They added: "Even at this moment, one person in five lives in absolute poverty without enough to eat, and one in ten suffers serious malnutrition." The scientists took the occasion to "warn all humanity of what lies ahead" and said: "A great change in our stewardship of the earth and the life on it is required, if vast human misery is to be avoided and our global home on this planet is not to be irretrievably mutilated."<br>  <br>  Why has God allowed so much suffering and wickedness? How does he purpose to remedy the situation? When?<br>  <br>  God's Permission of Suffering<br>  Nears Its End<br>  <br>  <br>  EVERYWHERE you look, there is suffering. Some people bring it on themselves. They contract sexually transmitted diseases or experience the effects of drug or alcohol abuse or of smoking. Or they may encounter health problems because of poor eating habits. However, much suffering results from factors or events beyond the control of the average person: war, ethnic violence, crime, poverty, famine, disease. Something else that humans basically cannot control is suffering related to aging and death.<br>  <br>  The Bible assures us that "God is love." (1 John 4:8) Why, then, has a loving God allowed all this suffering to continue for so many centuries? When will he remedy the situation? To answer such questions, we need to examine God's purpose with regard to humans. This will help us to understand why God has allowed suffering and what he will do about it.<br>  <br>  The Gift of Free Will<br>  <br>  When God created the first human, he produced more than just a body with a brain. Further, God did not create Adam and Eve to be mindless robots. He implanted in them the faculty of free will. And that was a fine gift, for "God saw everything he had made and, look! it was very good." (Genesis 1:31) Yes, "perfect is his activity." (Deuteronomy 32:4) All of us appreciate this gift of free will because we do not want all our thoughts and actions dictated to us without ever having a choice in anything.<br>  <br>  However, was the fine gift of free will to be used without limits? In directions given to early Christians, God's Word answers: "Be as free people, and yet holding your freedom, not as a blind for badness, but as slaves of God." (1 Peter 2:16) For the common good, there must be boundaries. Hence, free will was to be regulated by the rule of law. Otherwise, anarchy would result<br>  <br>  A Marvelous New World<br>  <br>  Under the rulership of God's Kingdom, survivors of the end of the present system of things will be ushered into an earth cleansed of wickedness and suffering. God-given instruction will be provided for mankind, and in time "the earth will certainly be filled with the knowledge of Jehovah as the wa

And if a person is never water baptised, they are of course still saved if they are a believer. <br>  <br>  The thief on the cross was never water baptised. <br>  <br>  Salvation is a FREE GIFT that happens in a split second when you believe in Jesus! It is impossible to lose or "leave" salvation (John 6:39-40, 1 John 5:13). <br>  <br>  The truth about Jesus is that the only way to be saved and to get into heaven and avoid being sent to eternal hell, is by believing in faith alone that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for all our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Believe this and you will be in heaven, no matter what! <br>  <br>  Please pray now: "Jesus, please forgive me of my sins. I believe that You died on the cross for my sins and You rose from the dead.

Actually, we all believe in things that we cannot see.<br>  <br>  For example, at school you may have performed an experiment designed to prove the existence of a magnetic field. It may go like this: Sprinkle iron filings on a sheet of paper. Then place the sheet over the magnet. When the sheet is vibrated, as if by magic the iron filings bunch up near the magnet's poles and form into the pattern of the magnetic field. If you did that, could you actually see the magnetic field? No, but its effect on the iron filings is plain to see, giving you convincing proof that magnetism exists.<br>  <br>  We accept without question other things that we cannot see. When we look at a beautiful painting or admire a fine sculpture, we do not doubt the existence of a painter or a sculptor. So when we contemplate a waterfall or gaze at a sunset, should we not be moved at least to consider the possibility that they are the work of a Great Artist or Sculptor?<br>  <br>  Why Some Do Not Believe <br>  <br>  Ironically, some people have stopped believing in God because of what they were taught in church. This was true of a Norwegian man who was told that God burns the wicked in a fiery hell. The man just could not understand what kind of God would torment people in that way, so he became an atheist.<br>  <br>  Later, however, the man agreed to investigate the Bible, assisted by one of Jehovah's Witnesses. He was amazed to learn that the Bible does not teach that the wicked are tortured in a fiery hell. The Bible likens death to sleep. In the grave, we feel no pain; we are conscious of nothing at all. (Ecclesiastes 9:5, 10) The man also learned that those humans whom God judges to be incorrigibly wicked will remain in the grave forever. (Matthew 12:31, 32) The rest of the dead will be resurrected in God's due time, with the prospect of obtaining everlasting life under Paradise conditions. (John 5:28, 29; 17:3) This explanation made sense. It harmonized with the Bible's statement that "God is love." (1 John 4:8) This sincere man continued his study of God's Word and, in time, came to love the God of the Bible.<br>  Others reject the existence of a loving Creator because of the prevalence of distress and injustice. They agree with a Swedish man who once pointed to the heavens and asked: "How could there be an almighty, all-bountiful God up there when we have so much corruption and wickedness down here?" Because no one could answer his question, he too became an atheist. Later he began to study the Bible with Jehovah's Witnesses. He learned that God's Word provides a satisfying answer to the age-old question, Why does God permit wickedness?*<br>  <br>  This sincere man learned that the existence of wickedness does not in itself prove that God does not exist. To illustrate: A man may design a knife to be used to carve meat. A customer may purchase the knife and use it, not to carve meat, but to commit murder. The fact that the knife was misused in no way disproves the existence of its maker. Similarly, the fact that the earth has not been used in harmony with its intended purpose does not mean that it did not have a Creator.<br>  <br>  The Bible teaches that God's work is perfect. With him "there is no injustice; righteous and upright is he." (Deuteronomy 32:4) God gives good gifts to man, but some of the gifts have been misused, causing untold suffering. (James 1:17) God will bring an end to suffering, however. Thereafter, "the meek ones themselves will possess the earth, . . . and they will reside forever upon it."—Psalm 37:11, 29.<br>  <br>  The Swedish man mentioned earlier was moved when he saw the suffering of fellow humans. Really, his tender concern for others confirms the existence of God. How so?<br>  <br>  For most people, the only alternative to belief in God is belief in evolution. Evolutionists teach "survival of the fittest"—that humans and animals compete within their kinds for survival. The fittest live; the weakest die. That is the natural order of things, they say. But if it is "natural" for the weak to die in order to make room for the strong, how can we explain the fact that, like the Swedish man, some strong humans are moved at the sight of the suffering of their fellowman?|`|vbjgMBdVaa	I do not believe in the christian god.

AA11297267	Well, since Anselm starts off with a false premise (stating that Gaulino is a christian and therefore not a fool), it's hard to go on from there.  He also makes several other logical fallacies, such as when he appeals to Gaulino's "faith" to demonstrate that there IS a god.<br>  <br>  (Anselm in his first statement implies that anyone who is not a christian is a fool -- that's a false premise)<br>  <br>  Beyond that, it's a bunch of word games which, when you consider the real issue, are meaningless.<br>  <br>  The real issue is:  there's no evidence that there's any such thing as a god, so belief in one is unreasonable and illogical.  And arguing about the semantics of how "great" god is, in the absence of any evidence showing there is such a thing as a god, is...well, pointless :)<br>  <br>  Peace.|`|4WqvTAfmaa	Can someone post the name of a book with this discussion, in English?

When we leave here, we all return to God. We belong to him, he created us, and he created your cat, therefore your cat is with God now. Death only hurts the ones left behind.

His bright eyes are intent; His eager body quivers. Suddenly he begins to run from the group, flying over the green grass, his legs carrying him faster and faster. <br>  <br>  You have been spotted, and when you and your special friend finally meet, you cling together in joyous reunion, never to be parted again. The happy kisses rain upon your face; your hands again caress the beloved head, and you look once more into the trusting eyes of your pet, so long gone from your life but never absent from your heart. <br>  <br>  Then you cross Rainbow Bridge together....|`|XaIcNmbxaa	i dont really know much about islam but many people believe every living living thing has a soul and when u are born your soul is  sent to your body and you die when god calls for you. and then your soul will be reincarnated whenever god sends you again and this cycle goes on infinately..so ur cat will return again, maybe next time as a person, or a dog or anything|`|7GcABTJ5aa	cat heaven unless theyre euthanized.<br>  "cat heaven is a beautiful place but you don't go there if you're euthanized dwight."<br>  -angela from the office.<br>  <br>  i usually live by the office and its advice so id say cat heaven..|`|7c0eb610d871f4900af356753fbd90b4aa	(((((HUGS)))))<br>  so sorry to hear about your cat<br>  <br>  I am not religious but I do believe that we meet with all our loved ones in the next life<br>  this includes our animals<br>  <br>  edit<br>  (((Jane)))<br>  thank you for posting Rainbow Bridge<br>  it is one of my favourites|`|enPvwjtbaa	When they die, They're in a better place.<br>  Their lands are frolicking with Yarn and scratch toys<br>  :)|`|AA12378902	Cats go to the Great Cat Box in the Sky ......  oops, I mean Yard! ..... not Sky ...... sorry about your family's loss ....... time's up!!!   go get new kitty..

And I have seen plenty of folks doing a variety of drugs. Some stories I have heard from reliable sources from various different settings.<br>  <br>  Shamans worldwide know and understand drugs of mind bending quality. They know that some folk should not do them. They know how to make the drug fairly safely, they know how to work with someone who has a bad reaction. Some of the recent designer drugs are just plain tough on the body.<br>  <br>  Ultimately, the drugs can be used in a positive way. They open a door and let you see what you are trying to get to in a state of mind. The test of your determination to use drugs instead of being used by them is determined by what you do with the experience. <br>  <br>  Now, I teach meditation. I have been able to get to all the places those around me with drugs get to, but I dont take the drug. IL am committed to not using the illegal ones, and the legal ones are mostly useless anyway.

A lot of people call it set and setting. If someone takes it not really knowing that it is a powerful spiritual tool, then they might feel as though they are going crazy. Their ego will fight and try to hang on instead of just letting go. That is where the bad trips come from, either your ego trying to control the situation or if you have some problems in your life that you are squashing down and then wham they come right to the surface. <br>  <br>  I think psychedelics used in the right context can be a powerful tool for good. There has even been scientific studies on this. John Hopkins University did a study and like over 60% of the people given Psylicibin said it was the most spiritually significant event in their life. Also psychedelics have been proven effective at treating alcoholism. Of course, I do not see any psychedelic ever being legal. The ones with the power and wealth are afraid of the way they make you think. They want to keep you hypnotized by culture and mass media. Keep you institutionalized and playing the game of consumer capitalism. It is all lies about psychedelics, these are some of the least toxic and least addictive substances around, especially natural ones.  So, to answer you question they can be used in a spiritual way, they saved me from the drag of reductionistic material atheism and reminded me of the inner spirit and inner shaman|`|8ubAwaGCaa	Genetic algorithms, neural networks, and heuristic systems: Artficial intelligence.<br>  <br>  Mind-altering substances, including alcohol: Artificial stupidity.|`|7831ee550cade02d213e89fd21c1d0e1aa	Enlighten you till you realize that you are crazy.

Body. The material or physical organism of man. The living electrochemical mechanism of animal nature and origin. <br>  <br>  <br>            2. Mind. The thinking, perceiving, and feeling mechanism of the human organism. The total conscious and unconscious experience. The intelligence associated with the emotional life reaching upward through worship and wisdom to the spirit level. <br>  <br>  <br>            3. Spirit. The divine spirit that indwells the mind of man--the Thought Adjuster. This immortal spirit is prepersonal--not a personality, though destined to become a part of the personality of the surviving mortal creature. <br>  <br>  <br>            4. Soul. The soul of man is an experiential acquirement. As a mortal creature chooses to "do the will of the Father in heaven," so the indwelling spirit becomes the father of a new reality in human experience. The mortal and material mind is the mother of this same emerging reality. The substance of this new reality is neither material nor spiritual--it is morontial.

DTog0VZWaa	There are so many ways in Judaism.  It's all about connection to God.  It's so all about it, that you don't have to have a connection to God that you even know exists to feel it.<br>  <br>  I'm not sure if God exists.  Intellectually I can debate this.  Yet, I had an experience where there was a flood of energy (in a non-Jewish non-religious but spiritual environment) that I recognized.  It was God energy.  I realized then, that the connection to God runs through every elements of Judaism.  That's why I recognized it -- it was from every service, & holiday & conversation & study session.<br>  <br>  Every moment is dedicated to reaching inside oneself to the connect to God in order also to connect to ourselves.  Judaism is an elaborate 4000 year old conversation on how to live life in a Godly way.  It can also be said how to live in a moral way.  So how you light candles for Shabbat is about God.  How you live that Shabbat day is also.  Then there's during the week, where how you do business in a moral way is about connecting to God.  How to you talk about others without gossip, is also about thinking about that connection as part of who you are even at every word that comes out of your mouth.  Then there are similarly beautiful rituals that give more depth to the feeling, such as the service.  <br>  <br>  I once sat in a Succot service out in the "hut" with a four year old.  We needed to leave early, & she started crying - sobbing.  She wanted to stay because it was so beautiful to be there, & she was feeling it & didn't want the feeling to stop.<br>  <br>  On services a non-Jewish friend just explained to me about her visit to a Jewish service, what seemed like the different from her usual services.  To her the Jewish one is a heart thing.  It's not a head thing.  The Jewish service isn't about learning the religion (Christian services often are.)  It's about doing the religion -- the connection to yourself, to prayer, & to God.  Even if you don't believe in God -- you feel God --- and even if you don't think it's God, doesn't matter because it connects you to that anyway & you are a better person for it.  And that's what counts the most (that you act well, not that you "believe").<br>  <br>  There's a famous saying, that even the most unreligious Jew had a deep spiritual connection even if they don't realize it.  It was coined by a non-Jew & I can't remember who.  However, it really does seem to be true.  So much of it is that it's a community religion...so even if you have a moment where you aren't connected it doesn't matter.  The community is & you can always reach out & touch it through that.  You get carried through, & the energy is always there...in everything.<br>  <br>  ======<br>  Very few Jewish answers so far - Mark S & Ruth so far.<br>  <br>  More on Judaism:<br>  <a href="http://www.jewfaq.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.jewfaq.org</a>|`|TVJsOEKNaa	Boy oh boy, you've gotten very few Jewish answers! <br>  <br>  I will answer this in a second, but it seems like I need to clarify a few things first. <br>  <br>  Sacrifices:<br>  ---------------<br>  It is very important to note that there were many different types of sacrifices, outside of the ones for repentance purposes, and most of these sacrifices were eaten by (a) the High Priest, (b) the people making the offering, (c) the poor who could not afford these necessities.  <br>  <br>  While sins did require offerings, it was in ADDITION to the repentance process: Not a substitution for it. Basically meaning, that you could also repent without the need to have a sacrifice. <br>  <br>  Why don't we make offerings today? The Torah dictates that we can only make offerings within Jerusalem inside the Holy Temple. Since we no longer have a Temple, we can no longer make offerings. <br>  <br>  What do we do instead?<br>  <br>  Hoshea provides the answer to us by announcing how prayer and repentance are means through which we can atone for our actions in life.  When we become responsible for our actions, we take better care to make sure that we learn from our mistakes and improve ourselves in the process.  When we apologize for wronging others, we are showing a sign of humility and humbleness.<br>  <br>  "Take words with you and return to Hashem. Say to Him, 'Forgive all sins and accept the good we do.  We will offer prayer instead of animals." (Hoshea 14:3)<br>  <br>  So that answers the 'sacrifice' concept. <br>  <br>  The Chosen People:<br>  -----------------------------<br>  Christian theology has a completely different interpretation to such a concept (and many people use it as a catalyst to be antisemitic). Now, what does the concept mean?<br>  <br>  It simply means that we chose to accept the 613 commandments, and as such are in an eternal binding contract with God. If you aren't Jewish, you don't have to follow any of these commandments. God set aside several laws (Noahide laws: <a href="http://www.noahide.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.noahide.org</a> ) with other people. <br>  <br>  It does not have to do with superiority: In fact, it's the opposite. What happens if you get a cell phone and terminate your contract early? You're subject to harsher fines and penalties as a result right? Same concept here. <br>  <br>  Jews do not believe in the doctrine of 'original sin' and never have (original sin is a precursor to belief in Jesus: eg. If one is born with sin, how can they atone for such a thing?).  <br>  <br>  The doctrine of original sin which looks to the teaching of Paul the Apostle for a scriptural base, is not shared by other religions. <br>  <br>  The soul is essentially born with a clean slate in life. Like all things in the world, as one ages they make mistakes and the soul becomes impure as a result. Think of it like an article of clothing that you buy: After lots of wear, the item becomes dirty and needs to be sent to the laundry.<br>  <br>  The same is true for all souls in the world. When one dies, the soul leaves the sensory world and enters "Gehinom (more of a purgatory)." A soul is then purified from its negative actions in life. So you are essentially taking your soul to be cleansed, the way an article of clothing is sent to the laundromat.<br>  <br>  The idea is to have the soul returned to its natural state. After this, the soul enters Gan Eden or the spiritual Garden of Eden. In the Gan Eden the soul enjoys the rays of the Divine Presence.<br>  <br>  It is believed that people are embodied with a 'Divine Spark' in Judaism also. <br>  <br>  We atone for our actions by asking for forgiveness, giving to charity and doing good deeds. However, this does not take away from the fact that after death the soul gets cleansed.|`|d0f93ace5169bf1fc1696345cdb101c2aa	How about letting someone who's Jewish answer this one?<br>  <br>  OK--we don't have a concept of G-d suddenly "entering" our lives.  G-d has always been here and always will be.  My rabbi says that G-d is found when two people do something nice for each other.  That's about the best definition I've heard.  Personally, I feel G-d when I pray or look at the Western Wall.|`|8ubAwaGCaa	Judaism doesn't have to be a complicated religion.  God promises, they believe, they obey, God blesses.  Christianity started out the same way.|`|vEEeq7kYaa	Wow..only FOUR of sixteen answers here correct.<br>  <br>  Mark S, Ruth, Cher and moo<br>  <br>  And a majority of the rest are so offbase they are downright insulting.|`|38vza5Gxaa	Wow, the hatred sure comes out on the Sabbath when they think no Jews are around, doesn't it?<br>  <br>  Ignore the arrogant, judgmental and hateful answer that don't know the first thing about Judaism.<br>  <br>  G-d is there always for Jews (and everyone else). No one stands between Jews and G-d.  Yes, religion and spirituality is within, without, surrounding us and with G-d.  Jews obey the commandments that can be fulfilled, worship G-d and only G-d and work to repair the world.<br>  <br>  Jews were and are the "Chosen" people in that THEY chose to take on the vast responsibility of obeying G-d's commandments, all 613 of them.  G-d would bless them and it would be eternally.  He wouldn't require as much of others but the covenant would be eternal.  Jews chose to accept the deal.<br>  <br>  Judaism teaches that everyone who is righteous will reach G-d, there is no hell and there is none of the elitism that you find in Christianity and Islam - both of which constantly tell everyone else that you have to be Christian/Islam to reach G-d.<br>  <br>  # # #<br>  <br>  No, Jews do NOT do animal sacrifice3.  The religion evolved out of that and it never accepted human sacrifice, per G-d's instructions - even the sacrifice of a god/deity is abhorrent in Judaism and NOT necessary

CU2eG18kaa	Its a dream from shaytan. Sometimes shaytan comes into a dream and tries to deceive u through that. I once had a dream where it was really dark and red and it was near the end of the world. And someone came and told me the Christians were right. This dream was way long ago, before I started practicing Islam, and if I beleived it, I would be in loss by not being Muslim. Dont let this dream trick u into leaving hijab, bc that's exactly what shaytan wants u to do. Before u sleep, recite ayatal kursi, and the three kul suraahs, falak, nas, and iklaas, and these dreams will go away.|`|5ofS2qQYaa	did you like the dream?<br>  if you disliked it or if you are indifferent to it, then ignore it...<br>  otherwise, if you felt content/satisfied or any level of happy from the dream then it probably matters<br>  <br>  I once had a nice dream where in the end my hijab disappeared<br>  but it dealt w/making someone a part of the family<br>  <br>  what's the context?<br>  <br>  btw, no one here is qualified to give you an interpretation you couldn't have just thought up yourself<br>  <br>  :)<br>  peace<br>  Allah(swt) knows best|`|4Rt7Mm8Aaa	While dreams have a meaning in Islam. It is important to establish 3 things. <br>  <br>  1) Most dreams fall under 'useless' dreams. Wet Dreams, Stupid senseless dreams, etc.<br>  2) Real dreams<br>  3) The dream interpretation is best done by a Maulana that is well versed in the science of interpretation. None of us are such a person, And while there are some books on this topic, there are other factors to a dream that a person reading it does not address. Time of year (season), circumstances in your life, sins, and one's dispositon, all of which will be difficult to determine by yourself. Please direct your question to a Maulana at a mosque. If you have done this, email me after and I will give you a number to call. It will be most likely long distance for you.|`|hceSZoAkaa	this is how i see it. <br>  hijab means alot to you<br>  and maybe you're getting rid of something or someone that means alot to you , willingly or unwillingly , knowingly or unknowingly.<br>  only allah knows best though.|`|bfWcfCKXaa	It means that you are dreaming of throwing of bonds of superstition, irrationality, and fear!

You would have to look at all the possibilities of what it could represent, as well as what things are going on in your own life, and figure out what makes the most sense.<br>  <br>  It might have something to do directly with your wearing the hijab... but I would think that would also mean something is going on in your life in relation to wearing it. For example, if someone is making you feel uncomfortable because you wear hijab, maybe you are subconsciously feeling the need to be accepted.<br>  <br>  It could mean a million other things not related to the hijab either. Think about what is going on in your life. Are you hiding yourself from someone you feel should know who you really are? Are you hiding from a situation when you should be facing it? Do you feel like someone is trying to deny or tie you down in some way, and so you feel the need to break free of them? It could be that, in the dream, the hijab somehow represents how people see you or treat you... and you feel the need break free of that.<br>  <br>  Who knows... it could even represent something like you maturing into a woman, and feeling the need to show you are more than the child people assume you are (deep down, beneath the physical body, in the sense of who you are inside).<br>  <br>  It may very well be that it has nothing to do with either the hijab or anything religious. Dreams are weird. They don't always make sense, and even when they do, connecting the symbolism with what it represents can almost seem a stretch of the imagination. <br>  <br>  I imagine you are worried about the dream, and that is why you asked. If that is the case, I'd say look at how you feel about wearing it. If you don't feel that you are having problems with wearing hijab, the dream is not something you need to worry about, in the least.

rHqe7oMoaa	According to Islam: Anyone who claims to be a messenger or prophet that comes AFTER Muhammad is a dajjal. It is NOT Sunnah to follow them or listen to them <br>  <br>  For example, Rashad Khalifah claimed to be a messenger from God, and he altered the Quran (removed a verse from Surah 9) in order to make his "numerical miracle of the Quran" work.<br>  <br>  <br>  The Shia faith was formed shortly after Abu Bakr's death. After Muhammad died, Abu Bakr took over as the first Caliph, but he died after 22 months in the top job. <br>  <br>  There was an argument over who would take over as 2nd Caliph, some wanted Ali, but Aisha had some things to say that sparked a big argument. Muslim's went to war with each other over who would take over next. <br>  <br>  This is known as the "Battle of the Camel" - 20,000 Muslims died in this Muslim vs. Muslim fight. The survivors split off into what we know today as Sunni & Shia. So no, 300 years after is not accurate.<br>  <br>  Since Aisha sparked the battle with her words, this is why Shia's do not like her|`|X1jupF0paa	get the marbles out of your mouth, I can't read what you're typing.|`|5GL2eFhyaa	English is a non indo europeon language, which derived from...

ms82j4iaaa	Well here are my thoughts:<br>  - girls can be bitches. some girls don't care that a man is in a relationship, they'll pursue whoever they want no matter what the circumstances. there are a couple different ways to look at this the way i see it. depending on your personality, here are some suggestions for action.<br>  1) of course you and your partner are in love. and I'm sure you guys have a deep trust and understanding. so tell your partner that that particular girl bothers you, and that you don't really want her around. it's not like you're trying to be controlling, you just don't trust her. i think if he's reasonable, he would understand and respect your feelings and adjust the situation accordingly.<br>  2) you could take the girl aside if she ever happens to be in the group with you guys again and tell her what she does is inappropriate and that you don't appreciate it and that she needs to stop. show her that you mean business in an assertive but civil way. <br>  <br>  if you've tried one or both of these and they don't work, then maybe this isn't what's meant for you. maybe there's something better out there for you. but the way i see it, she's kind of a gross ***** and not saying that he would but if he did ever like dump you for her, he doesn't deserve you anyways. <br>  <br>  but really, it doesn't seem like you have anything to worry about. i'm sure everything will be fine =]|`|XdgkK76iaa	Cry a lot.

Marriage (which I cannot overemphasize the importance of more) is a sacred thing, and even the preliminary love is an extremely strong bond. <br>  <br>  Still, trust is an issue. Do not be paranoid of your partner, but still seek out his true nature. He must earn your trust. I would even go as far as to say make sure he confronts this other woman and tells her (gently) that you're the true desire of his heart. That would be a good indication of his loyalty.|`|BLWxEdrMaa	I've felt the same way before.  It doesn't come from other people, though.  It comes from a feeling of inadequacy, and a lack of confidence.  You're right - it's not that he has any interest in her.  It's that you aren't convinced that you are enough for him.  Since the problem lies within, and left unchecked it can grow to proportions that WILL see to you losing him completely, do yourself a favor and begin a daily regimen of affirmations or see a therapist - quickly.  If not, it'll become a self-fulfilling prophecy and he'll end up with someone else - maybe not her, but eventually you will convince him also that you're not enough for him.  Please - save what you have by realizing, however you have to, that you ARE enough for him and it'll be okay.<br>  <br>  Now, what does this have to do with spirituality?

But if she cheats on me, at least I know she never really loved me, and I don't have to waste my time with her, and I can go look for mrs. right.<br>  <br>  I hope this helped.

If you say something about a specific other person that is even mildly insulting,  I think it might get reported.   Lots of people like Losasha.  I enjoy most of her answers.  Sometimes I agree, sometimes I disagree with her position.  If someone was to insult Losasha or another member by name and directly, I think a lot of people would report it - not just the target of the insult.<br>  <br>  I realize you are saying that you have had questions deleted even when you did not intend to insult anyone.  Maybe with Losasha being so well-liked by so many people,   even a very mild insult would get reported.

fmHyfVmVaa	Everyone is born with an intact fully functional Truth Sense. Long before little Johnny ever hears about Religion or God he can sense Mommy is sad so he asks her. In most nearly functional & healthy homes, Mommy out of a misguided wish to protect little Johnny says "Nothing dear". At the point little Johnny has a choice, believe & trust this inner knowing or the god like Mommy. Mommy almost always wins hands down. It does not take too many more times like this before little Johnny stops listening, & by the time he is not so little Johnny anymore he does not even remember he ever had this guide. This internal knower is not only our birthright but our equipment for navigating the mass of info we receive. Losing this Truth Sense IS the first cause of us going to sleep or becoming unconscious. Regaining it is the first cause of our re-awakening.<br>  Thanks for a great Q.<br>  Blessings!|`|R8upjPu8aa	For "that eternal", it is just another sport. it is nothing else but sport for "that eternal" to delve inside "layer upon layers" of ignorance, and experiencing increasing depths of unconsciousness, seeing dreams inside dreams. this is eternal sport of eternal.<br>  <br>  it is indeed an eternal process, for that consciousness to fall unconscious and again gain its concious. In other words, it is indeed eternal sport of eternal to  get unaware of itself and again get aware of itself.<br>  <br>  there is no logic, there is no need for logic, because "that eternal" is lavish splendor, most luxurious, at  the eternal's will, a cactus can exist next to a big coconut tree, there is no logic, and that is because there is no need for logic, because the resources of eternal are not limited and neither infinite intelligence can be put in bounds of logic..<br>  <br>  <br>  indeed it is true, one who understands zero to be infinite by his experience, is the true Yogi.<br>  <br>  "that eternal" is just supremely luxurious,  <br>  <br>  just like the same sunlight can be reflected in many pots of water, and reflection in every pot thinks its independent, but it does not know it is just another reflection of the same magnificent source, and its original existence is in the singular light, the One.<br>  <br>  as i am not perfect , and i am still dual, i can also say a statement like "each one is responsible for there own level of unconsciousness and there own karma, but all this is will ultimately be false, as the eternal truth remains. this is only relatively true until whose existence is only till our ego and duality exists.<br>  <br>  and again considering male or female is also of dual mind, it has no effect. because both considerations gives equal opportunity to move to the center. center is where the truth lies.<br>  <br>  Shiva in "Shiva Sutras", a 10,000 Years old meditation technique master book/manual, the source of all meditation derivatives , says : " Tava Bairava rupata "  meaning , attain the state of Bairava in one of the techniques which explains this moving to the center between the in-breath and out-breath.<br>  <br>  Let there be light and let all melt in bliss. let everyone witness the grace of divine.<br>  <br>  { <br>  <br>  Dear one : your words are right, but no your understanding is not what is wanted to convey.

Some people say this is because the ego was created, I am not sure exactly if that is what it is, it plays a role I am sure. Dualism.

7422ddf097669bd7b6e3d48e56258b87aa	You'll find the answers in the plain text of the scriptures ... both Old and New Testament:<br>  <br>  Psa 110:1  A psalm for David. The Lord said to my Lord: Sit thou at my right hand: Until I make thy enemies thy footstool. <br>  Psa 110:2  The Lord will send forth the sceptre of thy power out of Sion: rule thou in the midst of thy enemies. <br>  Psa 110:3  With thee is the principality in the day of thy strength: in the brightness of the saints: from the womb before the day star I begot thee. <br>  Psa 110:4  The Lord hath sworn, and he will not repent: Thou art a priest for ever according to the order of Melchisedech. <br>  Psa 110:5  The Lord at thy right hand hath broken kings in the day of his wrath. <br>  Psa 110:6  He shall judge among nations, he shall fill ruins: he shall crush the heads in the land of many. <br>  Psa 110:7  He shall drink of the torrent in the way: therefore shall he lift up the head. <br>  <br>  Act 2:30  Whereas therefore he was a prophet and knew that God hath sworn to him with an oath, that of the fruit of his loins one should sit upon his throne. <br>  Act 2:31  Foreseeing this, he spoke of the resurrection of Christ. For neither was he left in hell: neither did his flesh see corruption. <br>  Act 2:32  This Jesus hath God raised again, whereof all we are witnesses. <br>  Act 2:33  Being exalted therefore by the right hand of God and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost, he hath poured forth this which you see and hear. <br>  Act 2:34  For David ascended not into heaven; but he himself said: The Lord said to my Lord: Sit thou on my right hand, <br>  Act 2:35  Until I make thy enemies thy footstool. <br>  Act 2:36  Therefore let all the house of Israel know most certainly that God hath made both Lord and Christ, this same Jesus, whom you have crucified. <br>  Act 2:37  Now when they had heard these things, they had compunction in their heart and said to Peter and to the rest of the apostles: What shall we do, men and brethren? <br>  Act 2:38  But Peter said to them: Do penance: and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ, for the remission of your sins. And you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. <br>  Act 2:39  For the promise is to you and to your children and to all that are far off, whomsoever the Lord our God shall call. <br>  <br>  Heb 10:12  But this man, offering one sacrifice for sins, for ever sitteth on the right hand of God, <br>  Heb 10:13  From henceforth expecting until his enemies be made his footstool. <br>  Heb 10:14  For by one oblation he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified. <br>  Heb 10:15  And the Holy Ghost also doth testify this to us. For after that he said: <br>  Heb 10:16  And this is the testament which I will make unto them after those days, saith the Lord. I will give my laws in their hearts and on their minds will I write them: <br>  Heb 10:17  And their sins and iniquities I will remember no more. <br>  Heb 10:18  Now, where there is a remission of these, there is no more an oblation for sin. <br>  Heb 10:19  Having therefore, brethren, a confidence in the entering into the holies by the blood of Christ: <br>  Heb 10:20  A new and living way which he hath dedicated for us through the veil, that is to say, his flesh: <br>  Heb 10:21  And a high priest over the house of God: <br>  Heb 10:22  Let us draw near with a true heart, in fulness of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with clean water. <br>  <br>  Rev 1:7  Behold, he cometh with the clouds, and every eye shall see him: and they also that pierced him. And all the tribes of the earth shall bewail themselves because of him. Even so. Amen. <br>  Rev 1:8  I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, saith the Lord God, who is and who was and who is to come, the Almighty. <br>  <br>  Rev 1:13  And in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks, one like to the Son of man, clothed with a garment down to the feet, and girt about the paps with a golden girdle. <br>  Rev 1:14  And his head and his hairs were white as white wool and as snow. And his eyes were as a flame of fire: <br>  Rev 1:15  And his feet like unto fine brass, as in a burning furnace. And his voice as the sound of many waters. <br>  Rev 1:16  And he had in his right hand seven stars. And from his mouth came out a sharp two-edged sword. And his face was as the sun shineth in his power. <br>  Rev 1:17  And when I had seen him, I fell at his feet as dead. And he laid his right hand upon me, saying: Fear not. I am the First and the Last, <br>  Rev 1:18  And alive, and was dead. And behold I am living for ever and ever and have the keys of death and of hell. <br>  <br>  Rev 5:11  And I beheld, and I heard the voice of many angels round about the throne and the living creatures and the ancients (and the number of them was thousands of thousands), <br>  Rev 5:12  Saying with a loud voice: The Lamb that was slain is worthy to receive power and divinity and wisdom and strength and honour and glory and benediction. <br>  Rev 5:13  And every creature which is in heaven and on the earth and under the earth, and s|`|8ubAwaGCaa	The right hand side was a favored side for seating arrangements.

One believes truth, admires beauty, and reverences goodness, but does not worship them; such an attitude of saving faith is centered on God alone, who is all of these personified and infinitely more.<br>  <br>  Social leadership is transformed by spiritual insight; religion prevents all collective movements from losing sight of their true objectives. Together with children, religion is the great unifier of family life, provided it is a living and growing faith. Family life cannot be had without children; it can be lived without religion, but such a handicap enormously multiplies the difficulties of this intimate human association. During the early decades of the twentieth century, family life, next to personal religious experience, suffers most from the decadence consequent upon the transition from old religious loyalties to the emerging new meanings and values.<br>  <br>  Religion implies that the superworld of spirit nature is cognizant of, and responsive to, the fundamental needs of the human world. Evolutionary religion may become ethical, but only revealed religion becomes truly and spiritually moral. The olden concept that God is a Deity dominated by kingly morality was upstepped by Jesus to that affectionately touching level of intimate family morality of the parent-child relationship, than which there is none more tender and beautiful in mortal experience.|`|dbw210qqaa	John 10:4<br>  When he has brought out all his own, he goes on ahead of them, and his sheep follow him because they know his voice.<br>  John 10:3-5 (in Context) John 10 (Whole Chapter) <br>  John 10:27<br>  My sheep listen to my voice; I know them, and they follow me.<br>  John 10:26-28 (in Context) John 10 (Whole Chapter)|`|3qqvFEsHaa	religion is just an entrapment of the mind<br>  <br>  If people feel the need to be told how to live life, have them read Aristotle and Nietzsche and Plato and Mark Twain and any of ther other great writes in history who were real people<br>  <br>  This would give them opinions to base their lives around without all the superstitious dogma about sins and punishments from the creator of the universe<br>  <br>  But the answer is no though, just look at countries like Sweden<br>  Highest % of non religious, and also have the lowest crime rates, and teen pregnancy rates, etc...<br>  They make it work|`|IGAzs2UEaa	its not about religion - but a common type of thinking that religious people develop at early ages: believing without any reasoning. so if children grow up with other dogmas they will follow those. we need proper education not brainwashing|`|49c1ed9541d154d45ed38796a9a07ec3aa	religion is so unbelieveable ,,that people have to be scared into believing it ,,,its ridiculas a bedtime story that went too far cause that all it is a book about morals ,,and every storybook needs a villian to bring out the goodness and bravery in the charactor ,this villian is the golly green giant only its always in the story for these people ,,,they are not brave so they will not do anything they ll look at the sky and pray baaaahhhhhhhh!!!!!! they wont look for a way out of the field ,,in other words your wasting your breath|`|UBiIQ1wXaa	Well ;you do not know to much about sheep, go see what sheep are like without there shepherds and then get back to me....and no the shepherd is not religion, religion is not what saves somebody from the pits of hell Jesus does.

x7QFtMZIaa	Think about it, all the other people who try to sum up the stories in the Bible were human beings with an agenda. Ideas and concepts get distorted and the original intention of the creators become twisted. Then people decide to listen to them because they are too lazy to read the Bible for themselves and thus ignorance just continues on and on and on. Now we have God and Country, since when did Jesus care about what happened to America or any other country for that matter?|`|tp5TaeOYaa	Because when you use the word popular you are talking about a large group of people, and thus you're no longer listening to what Christ had to say, you're listening to peoples opinions, and people are prejudiced and affected by the world around them.  Christ talked about compassion etc. but could you call your average evangelist compassionate?<br>  <br>  Perhaps you should examine the concept of religion being used as a method of control over large populations....|`|bR4BgFLlaa	Because modern Christians make it up to suit themselves as they go along.<br>  <br>  Note how the previous answerer ignored the content of your question.|`|Rn4GXoJAaa	Jesus spoke of his crucifixion many times before it happened. I suggest you read the gospels (matthew, mark, luke, and john) to learn more about this.<br>  <br>  God bless you as you seek truth.|`|0QzASZQraa	The first problem is truth is not determined by popularity contests.  Just because a preacher or movement is popular does not mean they speak the truth or uphold the gospel.  The key to understanding the gospel is to understand context.<br>  <br>  "Study to show thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, RIGHTLY DIVIDING the Word of truth" (II Tim. 2:15)<br>  <br>  Paul was the apostle of the Gentiles (Rom. 11:13) and his gospel was from direct revelation from Jesus Christ. (Galatians 1:11-12)<br>  <br>   But I certify you, brethren, that the gospel which was preached of me is not after man. 12For I neither received it of man, neither was I taught it, but by the revelation of Jesus Christ.<br>  <br>  The confusion arises because people confuse the messages.  Christians today should be focusing on following the apostle Paul as he followed Christ.  Those who do not understand these facts can go astray.  Allow me to quote from my 2nd source.<br>  <br>  They set "the teachings of Jesus" (on earth) over against "the teachings of Paul," not because they are determined to obey Jesus, but because they are determined to minimize that which God has "magnified"—the authority of Paul as "the apostle of the Gentiles" (Rom. 11:13).
ka6lb9nXaa	Nobody can tell you have a small penis unless they see you naked, so people agree even if it's not true<br>  but you can tell that black women are curvy from seeing them on the street, so saying they aren't would just be weird, not racist|`|DvZdB66maa	What are you talking about?? I have never heard a situation like this in my life. First of all, most Black women ARE curvy, so, that statement in and of itself sounds ridiculous. Secondly, it wouldn't be racist even if you DID say that, so I really couldn't see anyone screaming "Racism!" over a statement like that.|`|iOv9tbULaa	LOL It's not racist. Every race of people have different body types. The truth is the truth. If a girl is flat (and there are women who actually are flat, not just having small breasts) then that's what she is. If she's got flast butt...you already know. <br>  <br>  But putting them in a catagory in general as not being curvy, is pretty inaccurate, because stereotypically blacks have more weight on them than a lot of other racial groups. Could have something to do with the diet passed down from whites in the old days...|`|M0vQFHg9aa	People just get mad whenever you say something negative about blacks. If you say anything bad about them, people will complain that your a racist. For some stupid reason, people have separated themselves into groups. Whites, blacks, Asian, ect.

Just like everyone else.|`|C9QQPROkaa	Not me its just your opinion but if you tried to make it like its a fact then thats probably why people got pissed.|`|vI5NksVfaa	...I was unaware that it was racist.<br>   I'm not curvy at all and it doesn't seem to surprise people.|`|w6tQEuKCaa	antant bytch..u wrong..black guys have big penis..and black girls have big butts...u mixing us up with white ppl|`|n1Ga3kdYaa	who cares! in the grand scheme of things, this does not matter. can't we address real problems for a change?|`|1Bg5E9GIaa	Iv'e never heard anyone say black women aren't curvy.....|`|VpR6qvb5aa	It isn't racist, but it isn't correct, either.<br>  Most of the black women that I've seen have been VERY curvy.|`|0l1ZairMaa	Wow!<br>  Nothing better to do, huh?  ~sigh~|`|Thw2IgxQaa	It's not racist but you lie when you say that, because clearly the majority of black women do have curves.

As long as they stay cool with me, I'm cool with them. As for those Christians who won't bug me with their religion, I'm fine with them as well.|`|AA10641825	Paganism and Christianity are rather similar.<br>  .|`|UxooffHZaa	Thanks for posting this. As an Eclectic Neopagan I enjoyed reading what Atheists think of my philosophies. It warms my heart.|`|Z4avhg3eaa	I have no problems with Pagans.  I was one for a few years. I still sympathize and connect very well with the elements. It was direct spiritual experience that drew me to it.  That being said, there is one fundamental difference between pagans and Christians.  Pagans don't have a religious experience and then think that their experience is THE truth for ALL people at ALL times.  In other words, their experiences are personal, not excuses to proselytize.<br>  <br>  EDIT--The objection that most atheists seem to have with Christianity is that it proselytizes aggressively. It resists education, scientfic progress and potentially life-saving research.  It is obsessed with sex, and not the suffering associated with poor sexual practices. <br>  <br>  Pagans are content to leave everyone else alone.  They have no trouble with any of those things I've listed above. <br>  <br>  It's behavior that causes the attacks on Christians, not beliefs.|`|AA11430900	I don't believe in the deities of the pagans either but I won't harass those that wish to believe in one.<br>  <br>   I don't mind christians who don't push their religion on people but the sad fact is many do by going door to door and by stopping you outside of commercial businesses.  I've never had a pagan do that.<br>  <br>  People have the right to believe as they will - at least in America, there is religious freedom (and implied freedom from religion) and so long as they respect the fact I have no desire to believe as they do, then I see no reason to create any issues.|`|aHEwm3QLaa	There are two types of religion: ones with propositions and ones with no propositions.<br>  <br>  Organized religion (usually have propositions) makes up the majority of the religions and is the dangerous one. Christianity fits into this category.<br>  <br>  Most pagans that I know of have admitted that their experience is just spirituality.|`|35388c245298f734c446f07410c4ec69aa	Well I think they're wrong, of course.  And I don't think they have any reasonable justification for their religious beliefs.  But I've never had a Pagan threaten me with eternal torture, or tell me to convert.  And in my experience they seem quite happy with secularism, and opposed to the religious indoctrination of children.|`|G9dZN8omaa	I like Pagans.  They, like Buddhists, are some of the most respectful people I've met.  They are very caring when it comes to nature and individuality.  <br>  <br>  No, I wouldn't say the same about Pagans and Christians. <br>  <br>  Pagans talk about how their religion affects them as an individual; Christians talk about how everyone who isn't like them is going to Hell.  <br>  <br>  There is a big difference between, "I enjoy my religion, and this is why" and "My religion is the only way; everyone else is wrong and evil."|`|M6VcuiyDaa	Here the pagans are nice, but I have met a lot of pagans and wiccans who are just very annoying and opinionated. Most of the Wiccans I know are 14 year old attention whores.|`|69750f25faea5e6021c54c23d0dcb774aa	I don't believe in their religion, but they are nice people who don't proselytize.|`|T1n3jt6Zaa	Pagans know how to party.|`|IBOuhyWoaa	i don't generalize...but for the most part the ones i have met are very nice|`|ryIMTXrRaa	I don't refer to religious people as 'delusional' or 'stupid'; people can believe whatever they like and shouldn't have to suffer abuse for it. But I have a harder time respecting religions that actively call for violence and discrimination against 'unbelievers', as the Abrahamic faiths tend to.<br>  <br>  Paganism is peaceful and doesn't do a lick of harm to anyone. I am cool with the green brothers and sisters :).|`|bEynoNf6aa	I agree that they're usually nice.  However, I think it might be because they have to due to their significant minority.<br>  <br>  While I appreciate their willingness to question the majority and go against the grain, I find Paganism equally as irrational as Christianity.|`|jQXza1aSaa	I think a lot of the old Pagan religions are really interesting to learn about, which I can also say about most religions (Not Pastafarian). I treat them the same way I would treat any other religious person.|`|fM7yNf8oaa	Well, Pagans, as far as I know, aren't trying to push their religion into our government, so I'm fine with them.|`|qRue8Xdraa	I like religions that keep it to themselves.|`|S4XUl7qWaa	If pagans routinely showed up on my doorstep to preach at me or were actively seeking to keep my friends from getting married or trying to get their religious myths taught as fact at my public schools, I'd have equally as big an issue with them as I do with many christians.<br>  <br>  Thankfully, I have yet to meet a pagan who does any of that bullcrap, so we're totally cool.<br>  <br>  edit: this does not mean I share or agree with their beliefs, but that's not the main problem I have with christianity anyway. i feel compelled to point out the hypocrisy and contradictions of many christians primarily because they feel compelled to try and force their views into my government, because they think they're the only right religion. I have never heard a pagan make that claim. I have never heard a pagan say that their way of worshipping their deities was the only way for everybody. I have never seen a group of pagan missionaries heading off to an NA tribal land in search of heathens to convert. <br>  <br>  I also feel a sense of comaradarie with other minority religion groups. Mind you, they're religious and I'm non religious, but we both get crapped on by the majority religion to about the same degree. Heck, they might get crapped on more than atheists, even.|`|Ve18FAnGaa	i generally feel the same way about pagans that i do about other th/deists but it doesn't surface as much because they are not usually pushy or threatening (too small of a group to be cause problems).  i find it interesting that most pagans i know (in my daily life, not on Y!A) fit similar psychological profiles and have many similarities in their personal narratives.  i guess though the same might be true about us atheists and many other groups.|`|aeAZZ7wDaa	PAGANISM IS A WIDELY USED TERM TO MEAN: ANYTHING OTHER THAN CHRISTIANITY, BUDDHISM OR JUDAISM.<br>  <br>  I understand all religions are man made.  I have come away from all religions myself.  I have studied enough of them in searching for the truth to realize that the truth lies within our own soul.  I no longer wish to be part of ANY conformity.  I am now learning about other "paths"...NOT religions.  So far I'm NOT interested in Wicca, am leaning more towards the power within myself and have been reading about witchcraft.  I like to hear about Ghandi & Buddah (real people with much wisdom NOT gods) Bob Marley was cool too :o)<br>  I'm interested in Native American Indian beliefs and so on...my point: There IS a purpose for us all, we are ALL offspring of GOD - whatever you want to call it/him/her... that which God is, we are.   <br>  <br>  So I suppose I can't be an Athiest because I believe in God,  and am considered a Pagan because I'm neither  Christian, Buddhist or Jewish...So what of me?  I like me just the way I am.  :o)|`|yu53u5TFaa	Well, of course just like with Christians what they claim to exist does not actually exist. But I have more respect for them because they seem more peaceful and less theocratic.<br>  <br>  But the second one of them wants to take someone's rights away, just look out.

AA11232725	It is only "disgusting" in that people who were created in God's image are perverting the uses that God designed for the sexual parts of our bodies.<br>  <br>  That's why God called it an "abomination" when a man lies with a man as with a woman. And to answer your question, "Yes, it is an abomination when women lie with women as with a man" because after you separate your self from whatever carnal thoughts may influence your thinking, it goes against God's design and is a perversion of nature.<br>  <br>  Romans 1:24  Therefore God also gave them up to uncleanness, in the lusts of their hearts, to dishonor their bodies among themselves,  25  who exchanged the truth of God for the lie, and worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed forever. Amen.  26  For this reason God gave them up to vile passions. For even their women exchanged the natural use for what is against nature.  27  Likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust for one another, men with men committing what is shameful, and receiving in themselves the penalty of their error which was due.<br>  <br>  PERVERT', v.t. [L. perverto; per and verto, to turn.]<br>  <br>  1. To turn from truth, propriety, or from its proper purpose; to distort from its true use or end; as, to pervert reason by misdirecting it; to pervert the laws by misinterpreting and misapplying them; to pervert justice; to pervert the meaning of an author; to pervert nature; to pervert truth.<br>  <br>  2.

T1beLIQqaa	Because people think all Muslims are Arab(NOT true-most are actually NON Arab).A very large percentage of India's population is Muslim. There is a small amount of Arabs in India,Sarah-most Arabs generally have straight to wavy, medium coarse hair and are no more hairy than the peoples of India. The Tamils are actually Indo European Aryan Whites and Arabs, like the closely related Jews, are Semitic White. As a General rule, India's peoples have darker hair, eyes, and skin than Arabs.|`|IhLebJVZaa	Ignorance. I've been mistaken for being Arab, and got called a towelhead (I'm a girl) a few times.

It's not just East Indians and Arabs, but with any kind of culture people aren't familiar with. People like to categorize people into groups that they have some kind of knowledge of. It makes socializing with people more easier with others if they can attempt to catergorize them into some kind of group they know a bit of. I wouldn't get angry, it's a lack of education due to not encountering people of either culture on a daily basis therefore not needing to know the differences in the first place. I would try to explain politely to them the differences so they'd avoid making that mistake in the future.|`|DcMWH8BSaa	I'm Arab and hate the fact that everyone is just so stereotypical and think we are all terrorists, get over it.

All major rulers of the past have realized this.  Just look at Constantine.  He wasn't Christian, but he converted because he saw that that was the way the wind was blowing and used it to his advantage.  He made it the new official religion and then held meetings such as the Council of Nicea to edit the early Bible, leaving in what was most helpful to maintaining public order and chucking and denying was wasn't.  He used religion to maintain order and stabilize his rule.  So, if the world suddenly became atheist, I think government would become the next thing to believe in and would develop into something unrecognizable to us.  Much different from the secular state we hold dear at the moment.  People panic.

Atheism is songless. It has nothing to sing about. The funeral notices of Robert Ingersoll, the noted agnostic, stated, “There will be no singing.”<br>   The psalm-singing of Christian martyrs going to their deaths in the arena alerted the Roman Empire to the fact that a new and revolutionary force was coming into being. When the pleasure-bent populace saw the Christians singing as they fearlessly entered the amphitheater where hungry lions awaited them, they were filled with awe. <br>   Heaven is vibrant with song: “And they sing the song of Moses … and the song of the Lamb” (Rev. 15:3).|`|EriaXXVWaa	Because atheism isn't a religion...|`|G9dZN8omaa	Atheism isn't a religion.

AA11232725	That's a keen observation however it lacks a defining qualifier. Nature as we see it today, and as Darwin observed it, is about survival of the fittest. That isn't the way it was in God's original creation before sin brought death into this world and the creation itself was corrupted thereby.<br>  <br>  Genesis 1:29  And God said, "See, I have given you every herb that yields seed which is on the face of all the earth, and every tree whose fruit yields seed; to you it shall be for food.  30  Also, to every beast of the earth, to every bird of the air, and to everything that creeps on the earth, in which there is life, I have given every green herb for food"; and it was so.  31  Then God saw everything that He had made, and indeed it was very good. So the evening and the morning were the sixth day.<br>  <br>  Genesis 3:17  Then to Adam He said, "Because you have heeded the voice of your wife, and have eaten from the tree of which I commanded you, saying, 'You shall not eat of it': "Cursed is the ground for your sake; In toil you shall eat of it All the days of your life.  18  Both thorns and thistles it shall bring forth for you, And you shall eat the herb of the field.  19  In the sweat of your face you shall eat bread Till you return to the ground, For out of it you were taken; For dust you are, And to dust you shall return."<br>  <br>  Romans 8:20  For the creation was subjected to futility, not willingly, but because of Him who subjected it in hope;  21  because the creation itself also will be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God.  22  For we know that the whole creation groans and labors with birth pangs together until now.|`|9BeUbORtaa	In Australia, certainly.

The second assumption is that if what is (nature) were created by God, that God must be below our human understanding of things(reason) and is therefore not benevolent. The third assumption being that nature could not be created by God; therefore there is no God.<br>  <br>  It sounds like the common objection that "since evil exists, there is no God, for no benevolent God would allow evil to exist"|`|D9lMg7A2aa	This is a juvenile logic error, quite common, called Amphiboly or Equivocation in Arsitotle.<br>  <br>  It both denies an evil and a good principle in the universe and thus attributes all things to God.

Since I don't know the person I must go with stupid as the more charitable verdict.<br>  <br>  You see how bad education has gotten.

VLv3Vzjnaa	I was shocked to see the answers to a similar question. The majority of those using the Bible to justify homophobia washed their hands of all responsibility and blamed the victims.<br>  <br>  We are told that we will know them by their "fruits." The fruits of homophobia are pride, ridicule, lies, reviling, prejudice, discrimination, division, unjust laws, hatred, bigotry, gay children being disowned and thrown out of homes by heterosexual parents, people being fired from jobs, attacks, bullying, violence, suicide, destroyed lives, murder of gay people and utter disregard for Christ‘s commandment to treat others as we want to be treated. ["A good tree cannot bear bad fruit, nor can a bad tree bear good fruit" (Matthew 7:18)]|`|hXQnR2Scaa	Why am I not surprised.|`|TyRfv0eoaa	I agree with all but one point. I think the 40% figure is way too low. I think nearly all homophobia in the US can be traced to religiously based bigotry.<br>  <br>  We can't educate the unwilling. But we can try to reach as many teens as possible with the message that they are not flawed and evil. I do this on Y/A in the Gay and Lesbian section. Many teens write in, knowing  they are gay, knowing they can't change it, and fearful about what lies ahead. For those who are concerned with the religious aspects, I show them that there are thousands upon thousands of gay and lesbian, bi and transgendered people in America who are faithful Christians and Jews, and that God loves them as they are.<br>  <br>  I can choose to light one candle, or I can choose to curse the darkness spread by homophobic Christians. The candle does more good.

The elect has been deceived. Only one church is left that formally teaches in opposition to the Dictator of Moral Relativism, and the great Pharmacuetical Infrastructure is indirectly steering the media to cause the whole population to hate the Catholic Church through propaganda because they are losing money. They have Hollywood in their pocket, just look at all the hate movies they make persecuting the Catholic Church with falsehoods.<br>  <br>  Little girls do not grow up dreaming of hopping from bed to bed and contraception.  They dream of a man who will sweep them off their feet and love them forever, and of having his many children. A cynicism born of the sexual revolution has brought emptiness to the hearts, wombs and lives of far too many modern women. This emptiness and pain can be avoided or redeemed and healed by the love of Christ and adherence to His teachings. The Catholic Church believes in such dreams because God wrote them on the human heart. And there are men who long for such a woman to love and cherish.<br>  Real lovers want to give without reserve in God's own superabundance creating more hearts and lives to love. Contraception is like kissing through a screen door and real love cannot tolerate obstacles. Contraception breeds selfishness and separation that drives a wedge between husband and wife that kills love. Real lovers want their love to explode into the posterity of future generations for all eternity. This is the kind of passion and fulfillment God wants for His children. Contraception limits what should be boundless. It spits in the face of this glorious passion and love's true abandon; and that is why it is a sin. It seeks to "tame" love, thus killing it. The Catholic Church is the last bastion on earth of true romance. The modern world has suffocated love and made sex a thing of deadness.<br>  <br>  <br>  Contraception limits what should be boundless. It spits in the face of this glorious passion and love's true abandon; and that is why it is a sin.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Contraception limits what should be boundless.

With the type of birth control used, Christians should research the possibilities of how it works. For instance, the morning after pill would be a definite do not use for a Christian. Why? This is because there is a chance that the life is in progress and to take this form would kill the life, therefore murder. <br>  <br>  There are several options and all true Christians should research well before assuming it's okay. Basically the life does not start until it is conceived. That means the sperm has to meet the egg and the embryo formed.

cd2etz5Raa	I come from a non-denominational church, and I go to the building for students grades 6th - 12th, but most services are the same way whether it be for little kids, students, adults, and even the Spanish service.<br>  <br>  1) Countdown (time to grab a cup of coffee and find a seat!)<br>  <br>  2) Worship. Usually 20 - 25 minutes (during which there is Communion, but only every weekend in the adult services and possibly the Spanish) we worship differently than a lot of other churches. Rather than choirs, we have live bands and play more current songs such as, "Your Grace is Enough" for example. Yes with electric guitars and drums included. It's great! :)<br>  <br>  3) Announcements of events that are coming up<br>  <br>  4) Offering (tithe) and a short prayer<br>  <br>  5) Sermon. Usually another 20 - 40 minutes<br>  <br>  6) Sometimes we end the services with another song or two, or sometimes we do something different like group discussions and such.<br>  <br>  It lasts for an hour, maybe a little more or less depending on certain things. <br>  <br>  Take care!!! :)|`|TyRfv0eoaa	Services last anywhere from two hours to all night. Sometimes people are just enjoying the presence of God so much, they don't want to leave.<br>  <br>  Before church begins, people are in the building praying. Some come an hour early to pray. We usually have singing and worship for anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour. Then there will be preaching. Then an altar call, which usually involves the entire congregation up front praying and worshipping.<br>  <br>  Nothing is carved in stone, so the Spirit is free to move, and so the order of service could suddenly change.<br>  <br>  Our worship is lively, enthusiastic, loud, vibrant and joyful.

MdyHKQRGaa	I agree. If the people who started Christianity had been more clear with their message there wouldn't be so much religious hatred today.|`|b3f4f6798be929d658ec38c5b998d657aa	ALL people are Sinners (Including Christians), and as such commit sin.<br>  <br>  Romans 6:23<br>  For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.<br>  <br>  Christians are saddened when someone who espouses faith doing great evil. There are Atheists who commit great evil, but since they have separated themselves from God, no one notices as they are dong the bidding of evil. But when  someone who expresses themselves as Christian and does great evil, people want to paint all Christians with that person.|`|yDJiiqcsaa	How is it that atheists are so concerned with religion and people that believe in them ?   If you don't believe doesn't it seem a PROFOUND waste of your time to study and critique those that do ?   I think wrestling is fake/phony but I don't waste my time arguing with wrestling afficiandos.|`|AA11520296	Oh you mean those 40+ people...that spoke a number of languages...over a 4000 year span??

3D5D6nB1aa	A more valid question, who's answer would subsequently answer your question as well would be, " why are "atheists" all ANGRY?  <br>  <br>  The answer,   is the feeling of hopelessness that they harbor inside, whether they are willing to admit it or not.  When you have no hope of anything past this miserable world, how can they be happy. Think of how you feel when doubt arises, or perhaps how you felt before you found Jesus?    How as Christians, could we expect anything more? I don't fault them for it, they are human. Human nature brings hatred with sadness.  All we can do is love them unconditionally like our Father first loved us, pray for them, and ourselves that we don't become like the "christians" that resort to name calling and anger. <br>  <br>  Atheists,    I think that you need to cut some of the christians that agrue and fight with you some slack.  Most of them, whether you believe it or not,  are saying these things because they are trying to help.  Our belief is, that without Jesus you have no hope of eternal life in anywhere but Hell.  They are not here to condemn you, they are here to  tell you that there is hope! If they get angry, it's because most atheists are well educated and it's very hard to get a point across to someone who so strongly believes the exact opposite of you! <br>  <br>  A real Christian is only here to help, not to give exact answers to questions only God himself could answer correctly, but us only in faith.       Love you Aunt Molly!  does this help?|`|QLYpq7Zhaa	Atheists and Christians alike have been found guilty of this.  To blanket any group of people is wrong.

As a human I don't like being judged or condemned for my beliefs.  Most of the Atheist here are here because they want to be recognized as followers of a established belief system.  They usually are judged, slammed and criticized. I don't know anyone who responds well to that.  I would say most of their name-calling is just frustration at being put down. We all need to get a grip and listen and learn from those around us instead of spending this time here and no one learning anything about each other. If someone feels strongly about their beliefs let others know about it but stop trying to force others to do something they don't want to.  We will all find out when we pass what the "real deal" is.  Until then we should be humans and treat each other with understanding and tolerance.|`|AA10556726	I'd say that it's a gesture of desperation, just like when you spend hours trying to convince a flat earther that the earth is a ball and they steadfastly persist in their ignorance.  <br>  <br>  On the other hand, ridicule has been proposed as an effective way to make people think.  I'm not in favor of it, but there are times that I really want to grab people and rub their noses in the evidence that they "believe" doesn't exist.|`|326c72d56b3c29d35b1fb5cda316d143aa	Well,in all fairness I've been witness to this method of anger displacement,from most groups represented on this forum..

5qZXeLwkaa	To Colagum,<br>  Yep, you got it, and God can poof you right out of this world too.  He is almighty, He is our CREATOR - key word here is CREATOR,  Since He is our maker, hence He brought us into this world then He can sure take us out.<br>  <br>  I've said this same thing in another question about this same subject.  Those of you who believe the earth to be millions of years old, I want to know HOW you know this.  Were you here when the earth was formed so therefore you know how old it is?  Oh, I know, the scientist have told you that the world is millions of years old.  Wonder how they know.  Guess it's all those test that are suppose to be so accurate that are performed or could it be that God has given them enough intelligence to know how to test or could be that God is just playing a game to see who gets closest to the right answer.<br>  <br>  God made MAN not monkey.  He made man to take care of the animals, and all that was in the Garden of Eden.  Had it not been for Adam and Eves' disobedience then there would be no sin in the world today and we probably would not be here. <br>  <br>  There are no babies being born today with tails that drop off when they reach a certain age and nor has there ever been a human being with a tail.  It doesn't matter how close to a human the apes are or any other animal - they still were never human - not way back when, not now, not ever.<br>  <br>  Use your common sense if you have any.  I agree with the asker, no one would live long enough to see this evolution from monkey to human.  We are made through intercourse between man and woman, we grow inside the uterus of a woman, we are born, not with tails or fur.  If evolution took place all those "millions" of years ago as the unbelievers would have us think, then don't you think that the earth would be less populated since you are of the belief that it takes so long for people to evolve?  Maybe your ancestors had fur and tails  but mine didn't.<br>  <br>  There is no proper response from those who believe in evolution in creating the human race, because it didn't happen.|`|Ilk5Xbzfaa	Your parents witnessed evolution.

The fact that it happens to be totally indistinguishable from normal life is your problem, not evolutions.<br>  <br>  Just because the development of the human species took thousands of generations, doesn't mean that the evolution of a new species of less complex life hasn't been observed within an observable time period.<br>  <br>  Real scientists are able to see this, and look at other evidence, and develop hypotheses, which can be tested by independent, third parties to confirm or falsify the hypotheses, who may also add more detail to the hypotheses until it becomes a widely accepted and well supported theory.<br>  <br>  Good scientific theories have two purposes<br>  1. to form the basis for further experimentation and research, from which the development of new technologies and techniques are derived.<br>  2. to give theistic morons a platform from which to display their ignorance.|`|Gn6jwmzCaa	You witness it everyday.<br>  <br>  You see Atheists and Agnostics who have evolved a much higher intelligence than your everyday run of the mill worshipper of god.<br>  <br>  In fact...christians still have a brain quite similar to the Neanderthal while Atheists' heads hold the more evolved brain of Homo Erectus.|`|91XGHfSaaa	Dude...

6gthdHpnaa	People assume dumb things about fat people. Like the first person, saying that fat people lack self-respect. That's really, really not true. Sure, some of them do, but quite a lot of skinny people lack self-respect also. Being fat is often not the person's fault. It's in their genes, they have a slow metabolism, there are so many reasons that don't involve them eating and eating and not exercising. And a lot of the thin people I know. I think the reason people look down on fat people is because of their assumptions about why the person is fat, which are often wrong.

oa3VMgcWaa	I think you're misunderstanding some things, Obama is president because the majority of Americans voted for him, not white Americans or black Americans or Asian or Native Americans; just Americans.  The fact that you want to separate it out by race is somewhat racist on it's own level. <br>  <br>  I don't think that anybody really thinks that only white people can be racists, the difference is that when white people like you and me do something that can be viewed as racist it historically has had a greater impact because we've been the race "in power".<br>  <br>  I didn't really see Obama's campaign as racist, I do know that there were a lot of people early on worried that he would not be able to reach the black community because he "wasn't black enough", so I think he worked that element of society very diligently, I don't think that he ever addressed issues that could only be understood by the black voters, but it was an advantage that he could build on and it was a very good campaign strategy.<br>  <br>  If people'd quit shouting "there's a ***** in the white house" and put that much passion into electing their local and state leaders that can make a real difference, it'd be a better country.|`|4Vmlf902aa	"Obama Campaign was extremely racist, majority voted based on Emotions and how he looked"<br>  How do you know this?! My parents didn't vote for the guy, neither did i since I can't vote. But that's total BS. That's like saying people only voted for McCain cause they didn't want to vote for a half black guy. Everyone is capable of being racist, not just white people. Oh, and Mr.Einstein i'm sure plenty of white people voted for Obama. Blacks always go Dem too, so no surprise there, not sure about latinos though. <br>  <br>  Evan: Black comedians speak more about black people than they do white. Who's shows have you been going to?

Its not that they have been made exactly that way, they have just always had possibility of the make up.<br>  <br>  With humans its something similar, after a period of time humans went into different groups according to their features. A lot of this started with went as the Bible alluded to, Nimrod was gathering all the people together to build the tower of Babel. His plan was gaining momentum in such a way that God stepped in to separate the people and confused the languages. Hence since having this problem of communicating, they separated from the project and went their own way according to group.<br>  <br>  God's plan was for humans to multiply and fill the whole Earth, not have them all in one place so this is why God did it. Over a period of time genetics caused people to take on features that were distinct from other groups.<br>  <br>  Think of it, sometimes two white parents can reproduce and have a baby with a little taint in its skin.

xB8EAIjLaa	I would pose to you this question:  "What if there is an afterlife?"  If there is no afterlife, then the premise of your statement would be correct, there wouldn't be a true meaning for our lives.  Sure we could live our lives and do whatever makes us feel good, but there wouldn't be a point, a reason for living.  If there is no afterlife, then when we die that's that.  All would be finished and there would be no more.  But if there is an afterlife not only would there be more to come after a mortal death that would give us our reason for living.<br>  <br>  If there is an afterlife, would you be ready for it?  I personally believe that the Bible is the Word of God and in it is stated that Jesus Christ is the only way to heaven.  If you go through life believing that the Bible is correct and that Christ is the only way to heaven and then you die and find out that you were wrong, what have you lost?  There would be nothing after that so it wouldn't matter.  But if you go through life rejecting the Bible and then you die and find out that it was right, you have a lot to lose.  Eternity is a long time to spend in hell.<br>  <br>  Here's a link that'll tell you more about heaven and what how the Bible says you can get there:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.fbbc.com/messages/youcanknow.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.fbbc.com/messages/youcanknow....</a>|`|rkhXCiIBaa	I have hope of something better, and I don't need to die to get there. It's called trying to make the world a better place. Instead of putting all your hope in an afterlife, how about having a little hope for this one?|`|PSY5G9tTaa	Honestly? I'm putting my money on reincarnation.<br>  <br>  I want to be a hippo!|`|sfCRwcRCaa	No one can say for sure whether or nor there is an after life.<br>  For this reason, I think that why we are alive, we should concentrate on this life, and this world, and how we can make it better for ourselves and those around us.<br>  I think that part of the reason that poverty, starvation, and suffering exist is because too many people concern themselves with the afterlife. Too many people are out trying to be right with whatever deity they worship to make sure they get into heaven, or come back as a greater life form, or whatever. <br>  Instead, let's just concentrate on the life we live now, for it may be the only one we get.|`|LZJPMl8raa	We do have a God!!! He is the one that give us right and wrong.|`|AnRTn8yAaa	Hello...<br>  <br>  Christianity is a religion actions...many good things schools to educate, hospitals, universities are made for the good of humans...<br>  <br>  Faith in God happens to all honest people...it's like an orphan who is always looking for his mother or father...honest people are always looking for His Creator and truth...<br>  <br>  Atheism followers put aside their conscience their very own honesty with their logic which is deceiving themselves...|`|3mDvjCa8aa	We have hope for something better, but it's only going to happen if we work on it in this world instead of hedging our bets that it will happen in the next. I think getting over this afterlife thing will help with a lot of the problems you mentioned here.|`|qRue8Xdraa	The fun things in life...|`|yvAR2vcXaa	Fear of the Dead: The dead cannot do anything or feel anything. We cannot help them, and they cannot hurt us. (Psalm 146:4; Ecclesiastes 9:5, 10) The soul dies; it does not live on after death. (Ezekiel 18:4) But sometimes wicked angels, called demons, pretend to be the spirits of the dead. Any customs that have to do with fear of or worship of the dead are wrong.—Isaiah 8:19. <br>  <br>  Eternal Happiness—In Heaven or on Earth?<br>  DOES your happiness depend primarily on where you live? Most people would readily acknowledge that happiness depends more on factors like good health, a purpose in life, and fine relationships with others. A Bible proverb puts it this way: "Better is a dish of vegetables where there is love than a manger-fed bull and hatred along with it."—Proverbs 15:17.<br>  <br>  Sadly, however, our earthly home has a long history of hatred, violence, and other forms of wickedness. But what about heaven, or the spirit realm, where many people hope to go after they die? Has it always been a place of blissful peace and tranquillity, without disturbance of any kind, as is commonly supposed?<br>  <br>  The Bible teaches that God resides in heaven along with millions of spirit creatures called angels. (Matthew 18:10; Revelation 5:11) These are described as spirit "sons of God." (Job 38:4, 7) Like humans, the angels also have free moral agency; they are not robots. It follows, therefore, that they too can choose to do right or to do wrong. Would angels choose to do wrong? It may come as a surprise to some to learn that thousands of years ago, a considerable number of angels did, in fact, sin against God—they rebelled against him!—Jude 6.<br>  <br>  Why Some Do Go to Heaven<br>  Many readers of the Bible, however, are aware of Jesus' words: "In the house of my Father there are many abodes. . . . I am going my way to prepare a place for you." (John 14:2, 3) Does this not contradict the idea of life everlasting on a paradise earth?<br>  <br>  These teachings are not contradictory. In fact, one supports the other. To begin with, the Bible states that only a limited number of faithful Christians—namely, 144,000 of them—are raised as spirit creatures to live in heaven. Why are they given this wonderful reward? Because they make up the group that John saw in a vision who "came to life and ruled as kings with the Christ for a thousand years." (Revelation 14:1, 3; 20:4-6) Compared with the billions on earth, the 144,000 truly are a "little flock." (Luke 12:32) Moreover, having experienced the problems common to humankind, like Jesus they will be able to "sympathize with our weaknesses" as they supervise the rehabilitation of mankind and of the earth.—Hebrews 4:15.<br>  <br>  Earth—Mankind's Eternal Home<br>  By providing the ransom sacrifice of Jesus Christ, God began gathering the 144,000 almost 2,000 years ago, and indications are that this group is now complete. (Acts 2:1-4; Galatians 4:4-7) However, Jesus' sacrifice was not for the sins of the 144,000 only, "but also for the whole world's." (1 John 2:2) Hence, all who exercise faith in Jesus have the prospect of eternal life. (John 3:16) Those asleep in the grave but who are in God's memory will be resurrected, not to heaven, but to life on a cleansed earth. (Ecclesiastes 9:5; John 11:11-13, 25; Acts 24:15) What will await them there?<br>  <br>  Revelation 21:1-4 answers, saying: "Look! The tent of God is with mankind . . . And he will wipe out every tear from their eyes, and death will be no more, neither will mourning nor outcry nor pain be anymore. The former things have passed away." Imagine—humans being released from death, and the pain and outcry it causes gone forever! At last, Jehovah's original purpose for the earth and humankind will reach its glorious fulfillment.—Genesis 1:27, 28.
LJ6vHfgoaa	>>did the Church really excommunicate the mother who saved her daughter's life, but not the stepfather who raped her?<<<br>  <br>  That would seem to be the case. As a former non-Catholic, I know how awful that sounds to many outside (and inside) the Church, but, yes, participating in an abortion is an excommunicable offense, while raping a child is not. The step-father, of course, is not in good standing with the Church, however. He cannot receive any of the sacraments until he repents.|`|yQNit56Qaa	I would just like to add that excommunication as a result of having an abortion performed is **automatic** in the Roman Catholic Church.  Several other acts also result in automatic excommunication.

7cjn2u9uaa	For myself I prefer to be naked in public, especially my back yard|`|de2AwHpHaa	i am an exhibitionist|`|058c86c973fc7c73b883537ed2bc5f70aa	Nudity is an amazing, sensual experience.  In private I am almost always naked.  My roommate and I are both nudists, so there is really no point in having clothes on in our apartment.  Even our friends usually get undressed when they visit, even the ones that don't consider themselves nudists.<br>  <br>  Being naked in public is a bit more difficult.  I like be "nearly naked" as much as I can and spend a good deal of my summer in sundresses with nothing under them or in shorts with just a bikini top or sports bra.  I am lucky to have a nude beach not far from where I live that I spend most of my summer weekends visiting.|`|47l1Sumeaa	Privacy.|`|YOt6uTSzaa	.<br>  <br>  Private, definitely...who doesn't...?<br>  <br>  .|`|2567c53ea5be1f53420408d56fd5f4b4aa	Hell, yeah.<br>  I got a hot bod.|`|xCvhgjlkaa	I love to be naked.

TyRfv0eoaa	I've never understood it. As a Christian, I am taught to follow peace with all men. But some Christians seem to think that war is much better. 30 years ago, it was kill the commies. Now, it's kill the Muslims.<br>  <br>  When the soldiers came to arrest Jesus, Peter pulled out a sword to fight. Jesus told him to put it away. Peter obeyed, but there are still a lot of sabers being rattled in Christianity.<br>  <br>  Not a Muslim, so I can't comment on the other side of it.|`|qxteTM9Kaa	righteousness|`|f8mLpPXlaa	I see your point, "if you don't believe in peace and love I'll kill you". This is a sad commentary on the human condition, but let's not forget the Left also wants war but always blames the Right. War is good for the economy. It always has been. Until Iraq that is.<br>  The liberals always want more money for the doleouts but can't raise taxes so they incite a war to boost production and the GNP to pay for their pork barrel spending. They're not stupid. they'll make it look like the Right got us into a war and then when they are elected all of a sudden they can be the heroes who get us out.<br>  Anyway, back to your question , the Muslims have a directive right from the beginning to spread their word according to Mohamed and to kill infidels who wouldn't convert. They did that right across all of northern Africa and the Middle East to Pakistan. And still believe it today.<br>  Christians on the other hand have done the same thing in South America, North America Europe etc.|`|muHctmaGaa	You know some Christian is going to argue that the "atheist Left" is all for killing babies instead of blasphemers and terrorists...|`|o7050Po2aa	War and God are close companions.|`|OBid7Ozsaa	There is a spiritual warfare going on.

wB3AbJyLaa	Mormons subscribe to the idea of an anthropomorphic God with physical, material dimensions. He is a procreating father, all humans were preexistent spirits that he begat, with a divine mother-wife. It is this conviction that under-girds the Mormon emphasis on marriage and parenthood in this life and the next. Some Mormons believe Jesus was married to both Mary and Martha and that he bore children on earth. Good Mormons enter secret temples and don white garments to indulge in esoteric, Masonic-like rituals that seal their marriage for eternity. The most famous of all Mormon aphorisms declares, "As man now is, God once was; as God now is; man may become." God himself was once procreated in another world, and now humans may aspire to the status of pro-creator that he has obtained. Adam did right by eating of the forbidden fruit because it made him capable of fathering the human race. In other words, "Adam fell that men might be." The right to godhead is not earned by the grace of Jesus but by being a good Mormon. Followers of Joesph Smith prove their faithfulness by being baptized and married in the temple, being a member of the priesthood, and tracing genealogies. As potential father and mother gods, Mormons will ultimately have their own planets to populate. All those born in prior to Mormonism's founding in 1830 cannot enter the celestial state without a little help from present-day adherents. The church has blasted a tunnel out of Utah granite, capable of withstanding a nuclear explosion, to house the ancestral records of devout Mormons. Once departed kin have been identified, posthumous proxy baptism are performed. Mormons spend $10 million a year to maintain the facilities, but for them it is well worth it. Some go through the three-hour ceremony on behalf of a non-relative they have never known. Mormons are universalists and believe that everyone will eventually have immortality, with only baptized Mormons attaining godhead. Article of Faith Number Three states, "We believe that through the atonement of Christ all mankind may be saved." The priesthood concept, a belief in a resorted priesthood of Aaron and Melchizedek, represents one of Mormonism's most distinctive departures from Christian tradition. All Mormon males over fourteen years of age are eligible for the Aaronic priesthood. At twenty years of age they may enter the higher office of Melchizedek and be designated an elder. Until 1978 those with black skins are forbidden this stature. Mormonism's temples, there are now more than one hundred around the world, were off-limits to blacks because Joseph Smith taught that they were decedents of Cain and therefore cursed. Like its views on polygamy, Mormon views on race were also overturned when church leaders determined the time was right. The church rejects the doctrine of original sin and believes that sinners are punished on earth for failure in their past spirit lives. Blacks were thus guilty of the preexistent sin of rebelling with Lucifer and barred from the priesthood until Mormon leader, First President Spencer Kimball, received a revelation abrogating this injunction.|`|7VJcd5YLaa	To see what Mormons believe - rather than take Pepsi's point of view on the formula of Coca-Cola - www.mormon.org.|`|UinOWcMUaa	A Mormon is an LDS memebr who followers the Teachings and theories of Joseph Smith.<br>  <br>  Mormon is a term used to describe the adherents, practitioners, followers or constituents of Mormonism. The term most often refers to a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), which is commonly called the Mormon Church. The LDS Church believes that "Mormon" should properly be applied only to its members. However, the term is often used more broadly to describe any individual or group that believes in the Book of Mormon, which was originally published in 1830 by Joseph Smith, Jr. as The Book of Mormon: An Account Written by the Hand of Mormon upon Plates Taken from the Plates of Nephi.

LuN1unJ3aa	The Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (FLDS Church) is one of the largest Mormon fundamentalist denominations and one of United States' largest practitioners of plural marriage. The FLDS Church emerged in the early 1900s when its founding members left The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). The split occurred largely because of the LDS Church's renunciation of polygamy and its decision to excommunicate practitioners of plural marriage.<br>  <br>  The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormon Church) is not affiliated with the FLDS Church. If members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints engage in polygamy, they are excommunicated. The FLDS church split away from the LDS church in the early 1900s, because polygamy had been banned from their practices.<br>  <br>  I've provided a couple of wikipedia links to the primary articles for both the FLDS and LDS churches.|`|4rWPX8CTaa	They both think Joe Smith was not a lying scum bag piece of crap.|`|DVDYDaVSaa	Absolutely.  The FLDS are pretty much like the early Utah mormons were.  Both believe Joseph Smith and Brigham Young (and I think one more) were prophets of god.  Both use the same scriptures, and I'd imagine their church services and temple ceremonies are similar.  The practice of polygamy in this life is almost the only difference.

AA11232725	First of all pray that the Holy Spirit will prepare their hearts for you to sow the good seed of the Word that He will give you at the right time. Then follow the model that the Lord Jesus gave us where He first met a woman at the point in her life where she was at and then moved the conversation around to Spiritual matters.<br>  <br>  John 4:6  Now Jacob's well was there. Jesus therefore, being wearied from  His journey, sat thus by the well. It was about the sixth hour.  7  A woman of Samaria came to draw water. Jesus said to her, "Give Me a drink."  8  For His disciples had gone away into the city to buy food.  <br>  <br>  9  Then the woman of Samaria said to Him, "How is it that You, being a Jew, ask a drink from me, a Samaritan woman?" For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans.  <br>  <br>  10  Jesus answered and said to her, "If you knew the gift of God, and who it is who says to you, 'Give Me a drink,' you would have asked Him, and He would have given you living water."  <br>  <br>  11  The woman said to Him, "Sir, You have nothing to draw with, and the well is deep. Where then do You get that living water?  12  Are You greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well, and drank from it himself, as well as his sons and his livestock?"  <br>  <br>  13  Jesus answered and said to her, "Whoever drinks of this water will thirst again,  14  but whoever drinks of the water that I shall give him will never thirst. But the water that I shall give him will become in him a fountain of water springing up into everlasting life."  <br>  <br>  15  The woman said to Him, "Sir, give me this water, that I may not thirst, nor come here to draw."  16  Jesus said to her, "Go, call your husband, and come here."  <br>  <br>  17  The woman answered and said, "I have no husband." Jesus said to her, "You have well said, 'I have no husband,'  18  for you have had five husbands, and the one whom you now have is not your husband; in that you spoke truly."  <br>  <br>  19  The woman said to Him, "Sir, I perceive that You are a prophet.  20  Our fathers worshiped on this mountain, and you Jews say that in Jerusalem is the place where one ought to worship." <br>  <br>   21  Jesus said to her, "Woman, believe Me, the hour is coming when you will neither on this mountain, nor in Jerusalem, worship the Father.  22  You worship what you do not know; we know what we worship, for salvation is of the Jews.  23  But the hour is coming, and now is, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth; for the Father is seeking such to worship Him.  24  God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truth."  <br>  <br>  25  The woman said to Him, "I know that Messiah is coming" (who is called Christ). "When He comes, He will tell us all things."  26  Jesus said to her, "I who speak to you am  He."|`|M4WIWMgBaa	Do it and after a while you wont have any friends.|`|b3f4f6798be929d658ec38c5b998d657aa	The best form of Evangelism is living your faith.

If your friends ever mention the word tampon in conversation, you are free to pursue that thread.  If not, there's really no easy way to introduce it to the conversation.  That's true of almost any topic of conversation.|`|8abc5b9cab61ed51f5b3b0ffd3f6ca5aaa	I know this isn't what you want to hear, but the only way to expose your friends to your religion is to live it fully, honestly and well.  Live your life with an open heart, full of love for all, as Jesus did.  Pray in private (as Jesus advised).  Pray for the support to be a living example of your faith in every minute, then leave the rest to Jesus.<br>  <br>  It is insulting to your friends to proselytize to them.  It means you think your choices are better than theirs, and your ways are better than theirs.  This is arrogance, and not what Jesus had in mind.  It is also impossible to influence someone if they think you are arrogant, so in addition to being an unattractive, immature trait, it is also ineffective.<br>  <br>  If they ask you about your religion, or about the role Jesus plays in your life, if you have lived your life fully for Him you will have exactly the right words, full of love and inspiration.  That is, if they are ready to hear them.  Even the perfect words sometimes fall on deaf ears, and that is not your fault.  But you really must wait to be asked, and while you are waiting, your faith can inspire your living, thus making it more likely you will be asked.|`|znt2s3sMaa	I have that problem too-it is hard to figure out what to say to them.

Whoever shall faithfully serve me by the recitation of the Rosary shall receive signal graces.<br>  2. I promise my special protection and the greatest graces to all those who shall recite the Rosary.<br>  3. The Rosary shall be a powerful armor against Hell, it will destroy vice, decrease sin, and defeat heresies.<br>  4. It will cause virtue and good works to flourish; it will obtain for souls the abundant mercy of God; it will withdraw the hearts of men from the love of the world and its vanities and will lift them to the desire of eternal things. Oh, that souls would sanctify themselves by this means.<br>  5. The soul which recommends itself to me by the recitation of the Rosary, shall not perish.<br>  6. Whoever shall recite the Rosary devoutly, applying himself to the consideration of its sacred mysteries, shall never be conquered by misfortune. God will not chastise him in His justice, he shall not perish by an unprovided death; if he be just, he shall remain in the grace of God and become worthy of eternal life.<br>  7. Whoever shall have a true devotion for the Rosary shall not die without the Sacraments of the Church.<br>  8. Those who are faithful to recite the Rosary shall have during their life and at their death the light of God and the plenitude of His graces; at the moment of death, they shall participate in the merits of the saints in Paradise.<br>  9. I shall deliver from Purgatory those who have been devoted to the Rosary.<br>  10. The faithful children of the Rosary shall merit a high degree of glory in Heaven.<br>  11. You shall obtain all you ask of me by the recitation of the Rosary.<br>  12. All those who propagate the Holy Rosary shall be aided by me in their necessities.<br>  13. I have obtained from my Divine Son that all the advocates of the Rosary shall have for intercessors the entire Celestial Court during their life and at the hour of death.<br>  14.

The proud mom mentions that her little Billy is starting second grade next week; the wife to the wonderful husband mentions Ted is out of town this week; the doting husband mentions his wife Betty is head of the Chamber of Commerce.  They aren't LOOKING for opportunties to mention their loved ones, per se.  It's just that their loved ones are so much a part of their lives that many things remind them of them.  <br>  <br>  Don't make it your GOAL to witness, per se.  RELAX!  We're talking about an atheist and an agnostic.  It's going to take a while to EVER get through to them.  It may never happen.  So, what's your hurry?  RELAX!  Just be yourself.  If God pops into your head with one of them, don't censor yourself.  Just say what you just thought!  But don't feel compelled to hammer God, God, God 24/7.  That will be off putting!  God is your friend!  You have a relationship with God.  God is good!  You want to share Him with others.  <br>  <br>  Think of it this way.  Someone says to you, "I ate at a great restaurant yesterday, you should try it," that's one thing. If they KEEP ON with, "Have you tried it yet?  Why not?  When are you going to go?" you're going to get ticked off.  BACK OFF. man!<br>  <br>  Christians can be like that.  I'll say, "We'd love to have you go to church with us sometime."  Then I don't mention it again for maybe 6 months!  Think of it this way.  Had I said, "I'll give you a million dollars, you don't think he would have said something?  So, I casually invited him to church and he ignored me.  That's a hint to back off!<br>  <br>  Just get in a little line here and a little line there.  Try to pique their curiosity.  Try to witness at least a little.  But don't beat them over the head with God!<br>  <br>  Less is more with some people.<br>  <br>  Maybe most importantly of all, witness through your ACTIONS!  They say, "Actions speak louder than words."  The Bible says to set yourself apart.  Show your love.  Etc.  <br>  <br>  So, let's say you all are walking along and you see a homeless guy.  Give him a $20!  They will probably make fun of you.  Say, "The Bible says, 'What you do unto the least of thee, you do unto me.'"  If they call you a sucker, say something like: "God doesn't want us to try to figure out who's the con and who really needs help.  That's His job."  <br>  <br>  You get the idea.<br>  <br>  Lord bless.|`|wRsSodTAaa	Start off slow.  Be a good example first off.  You have to take the higher road even if they are cursing or talking bad.  You can't do those things if you want to let your light shine.  Then, gradually incorporate God into the conversation.  Such as, "Thank God I passed that test... I was really praying about that one." Or something like that.  Then, you can start saying stuff about church... like, "Yeah, there's this really sweet girl at church who bought some of those jeans... I asked her where she got them..."  Or something like that.  <br>  Then, the next step would be to invite them over for the weekend.  You could say, "So, you can stay Friday and Saturday or if you want to stay over until Sunday, we have a concert at church Sunday, if you want to go."  Or something like that.  Just take it gradual and be a light to them.  <br>  Also, "The Book" translation of the Bible has some cool sounding stuff in it.  You could write a verse on the front of your folder that you like and maybe they will see it and ask about it.

It will cause virtue and good works to flourish; it will obtain for souls the abundant mercy of God; it will withdraw the hearts of men from the love of the world and its vanities and will lift them to the desire of eternal things. Oh, that souls would sanctify themselves by this means.<br>  5. The soul which recommends itself to me by the recitation of the Rosary, shall not perish.<br>  6. Whoever shall recite the Rosary devoutly, applying himself to the consideration of its sacred mysteries, shall never be conquered by misfortune. God will not chastise him in His justice, he shall not perish by an unprovided death; if he be just, he shall remain in the grace of God and become worthy of eternal life.<br>  7. Whoever shall have a true devotion for the Rosary shall not die without the Sacraments of the Church.<br>  8. Those who are faithful to recite the Rosary shall have during their life and at their death the light of God and the plenitude of His graces; at the moment of death, they shall participate in the merits of the saints in Paradise.<br>  9. I shall deliver from Purgatory those who have been devoted to the Rosary.<br>  10. The faithful children of the Rosary shall merit a high degree of glory in Heaven.<br>  11. You shall obtain all you ask of me by the recitation of the Rosary.<br>  12. All those who propagate the Holy Rosary shall be aided by me in their necessities.<br>  13. I have obtained from my Divine Son that all the advocates of the Rosary shall have for intercessors the entire Celestial Court during their life and at the hour of death.<br>  14. All who recite the Rosary are my sons, and brothers of my only Son, Jesus Christ.<br>  15. Devotion to my Rosary is a great sign of predestination.<br>  <br>  God bless!<br>  Dave
hqvPk8WIaa	Your observation is corect. The vast majority of famous people have had a lot of plastic surgery. It's sickening when a skanky celeb woman is fawned over for supposedly being so beautiful by the media and clueless people when she looks veeeery different than she originally did. Furthermore, in many cases, even after all the plastic surgeries, the women still don't look beautiful and look like they're made of wax. Some dumb men even argue when you try to tell them. I showed a few men high school pictures of a couple famous women they drool over. They both have clearly had rhinoplasty, collagen lip injections, eyebrow lifts and cosmetic dental work since then. One of the women also has cheek implants and a small chin implant. The other uses butt pads these days. Those men were speechless and seemed confused. It never ceases to amaze me how many men pay no attention to detail and don't think when it comes to physicality. In many cases, you can look at these celebs and notice some of the work they had done if you have a keen eye. Otherwise, many of them have had lots of work done since coming into fame, so if you pay attention, you will see the subtle and not so subtle changes in their looks overtime.|`|9lT4e8Efaa	I totally agree, we are living in a society where fakeness, in both appearance and personality is worshiped! I blame the medial portrayal of beauty, i mean when did massive fake boobs, bleach blond hair dyed so many times its like straw and falling out, and orange skin become beautiful? There are models who simply drop dead on the catwalk because their bodies cannot take all the abuse in a bid to become perfect. I think the reason the fake look is so popular is because like a beautiful real flower true beauty fades whereas fake ones last, however I would rather age naturally (which I believe is FAR more beautiful) than look fake forever and spend far too much money that could go to much better causes. True beauty will always win over fakeness|`|2JqMpiUtaa	Fake beauty is the first thing we notice.
fLpzKulAaa	I can relate to this.  I got married and had children before I realized that I was so unhappy in life because I was gay.  I was naive and never knew that's what my feelings meant.  I was even hit on twice in my teen years by girls and didn't figure out that they were hitting on me.  (I'm embarrassed by it now...lol)  <br>  It wasn't until I had my first girlfriend, who had been my best friend for about a year before then, that I realized what it all meant.  But once I kissed her I knew that I was gay, and from there the other things like "wanting vagina" came so naturally.  <br>  However, the process of discovering this in yourself is very personal and is different for everyone.  You have to figure this one out on your own.<br>  Don't come on to your friends if they are straight.  If you have a close friend who is gay or bi talk to her about her experiences.<br>  In my personal opinion, and don't take this for more than it's worth, you need to explore your sexuality and you will figure out what your preferences are.<br>  Good luck to you.  :)|`|onfTqFe4aa	It's okay, i found myself in the same prediciment at 24! At least you have the excuse that you're still kinda young and figuring it all out. Haha...well actually I'm leaning more towards the bi-sexual tendencies. Have you ever really felt that connection to a guy that you do with girls? Thats how I looked at it. Im still a virgin just becuase the whole sex with a guy thing scared me, I'd much rather be cuddled up with a girl right now. But I still do like guys so, idk....i guess im just letting you know you're not the only one cause I don't think I really gave you any advice or answer...lol.

swkhohjgaa	I think your looking at this the wrong way. First being Bi doesn't make you greedy or butch or anything else. It does give you more options and (in my humble opinion) a little better understanding of sexual relations in some cases. Just relax be yourself and don't label yourself. Be with whoever you want to be as long as your comfortable|`|631c8fd5c39d806e031079d8fccb75f9aa	Please, free yourself of these stereotypes.  They have no basis in reality.  Bisexuals are just as greedy as gay or straight people.  Liking both sexes doesn't mean you have to be dating two people at the same time. <br>  <br>  What does being bisexual have to do with 'butchiness'?|`|UtND0R2Baa	I don't see an issue here! Just because you like girls doesn't mean you have to like butch girls and doesn't make you greedy. Go be happy and bi!|`|4Ito7TPMaa	u don't have to be butch.

3IJNTuTnaa	I think that it could work between you guys with no problem, but how his family is going to accept it just depends on them.  Many Jewish families don't really mind.  Try to imagine how your family will feel - can you imagine them being okay with it?  If so, it's just as likely that his family will.  Or vice versa.  What I'm saying is I don't think there's anything endemic to Judaism that will make it any more of a problem than it is for your Christian family.|`|c1d312af4250951e942d357ba46d734caa	Well, his Mom is not gonna like you since I believe the custom goes that children are what there mother is.  So, your kids cannot (in their eyes) be Jewish since you are not Jewish.  The line passes through the mother, not the father.  Obviously this is silly in modern light, I know a few kids who grew up in a Jewish and Christian home.  One in particular considered herself Jewish because she went to Temple with her father, though she wasn't considered technically Jewish by the community.  (I believe the Jewish have a term for women like you :)  "shiksa"  I probably spelled that wrong.  It means non-jewish woman who steals away the jewish sons)<br>  Bottom line though, if you love each other and are willing to respect each others beliefs then it should be fine :)  Yes you will most likely get some flak from your MIL if she's particularly devout, but how many women in the history of the world have had MIL's who didn't approve of them right away?  Its not the end of the world. So long as your husband isn't going to bend to the pressure of his mother, you should just suck it up and concentrate on showing her what a wonderful person you are.|`|38vza5Gxaa	answer: Would you be willing to raise your children as Jews? Have them to convert to Judaism when they're old enough (unless he's Reform Jewish, which recognizes Jewishness from both mother and father).  If he's a Conservative Jew, will you keep a kosher home?  What about holidays? Will you insist on a Christmas tree?  What about him having a mezuzah on the doorposts in and out of the house?  Keeping the Sabbath?<br>  <br>  Talk with a Rabbi - there's a lot of questions you both need to cover before considering marriage.<br>  <br>  Orthodox Judaism won't recognize your religion (I'm doubting your man is Orthodox or you wouldn't be dating).  Conservative will but the Rabbi won't marry you and many Reform Rabbi's won't do interfaith marriage ceremonies either but recognize marriages done in a civil ceremony.|`|TyRfv0eoaa	Depends on a lot of factors. My Catholic uncle married a Jewish woman. But neither of them are very observant. They were married by a justice of the peace who was also a rabbi. (A fact they hid from my late grandmother, who would have had a fit if she had known the JP was also a rabbi. This was a lady who carried around a shopping bag full of novena prayers!)<br>  <br>  They've been married almost 30 years, have two grown sons, and seem very happy together.|`|FmbwIbtzaa	I would not wish to change your Love for Our Lord.

Paul said, "they that are of faith are the seed of Abraham," and "A Jew is not one outwardly, in the circumcision of the flesh, but a Jew is one inwardly where circumcision is that of the HEART."  <br>  <br>  Rev.

I hate to sound so negative, but I feel it is better to be truthful about the situation, than to lie to you about what Judaism says. <br>  <br>  If you raise your children "Jewish" they will face the point where they are told about these laws.<br>  <br>  Other problems:<br>  How do you plan on reconciling the two completely different  ideologies?<br>  <br>  Judaism does NOT accept Jesus as a savior, messiah, semi-Deity or prophet: He has absolutely nothing to do with Judaism and everything to do with Christianity. <br>  <br>  For example: <br>  --------------------<br>  Christmas is a celebration of Jesus' birth, while Hanukkah is about the war we won against assimilation from outside religions.<br>  <br>  What about the Virgin Birth, New Testament, Original Sin, Daniel being seen as a prophet, Heaven & Hell concepts, etc..Judaism does not believe in any of this. These are not small differences (I realize that Christianity tries to imply that the two religions are very similar: They aren't). These are major conflicting beliefs.  <br>  <br>  What then about Jewish tradition, if you decide to raise them "Jewish"? Who will teach your children Hebrew and Torah, who will be the example of how commandments are followed, answer questions etc.. What about observing Shabbat along with all the other holidays?<br>  Or keeping a Kosher home and lifestyle? <br>  <br>  These are all things that should be taken into consideration, before talking marriage.|`|i6Mi8uWIaa	There have been a lot of marriages between Jews and Christians.<br>  <br>  One famous example comes from Fiddler on the Roof. Tevye's third daughter marries a Christian. Tevye disowns her, but he comes to his senses in the end. Another semi-famous example might be the much more successful marriage of Arlene Klasky, one of the creators of the Nickleodeon cartoon "Rugrats." She is a Jew married to a Christian, just like the character DiDi Pickles in the show is Jewish and her husband Stu is Christian. <br>  <br>  That being said, traditional Judaism does not permit interfaith marriages. In fact, according to JewFAQ.org, the Torah says that children of such marriages are lost to Judaism, and that only 1/3 of intermarried Jews raise their children Jewish. <br>  <br>  There are several things to take into consideration when considering an interfaith marriage between a Jew and a Christian. Judaism 101 (Jewfaq,org) lists among them stereotypes (as applied to your case, that gentile women want Jewish men because they're good providers, don't abuse their women, and don't drink, and that Jewish men want gentile women because they're level-headed and intelligent, not bubble-headed bimbos), where the marriage will take place (most Jewish movements will not allow it at a synogogue), the holidays (what happens when Christmas and Chaunukkah overlap, for example?) and the children (which religion to raise them in?). <br>  <br>  That being said, if the two of you are truly committed to each other and are willing to talk over everything and to be respectful of each other's religious beliefs, it can work.<br>  <br>  I wish you best of luck!|`|94721e681922199602abd6ed928a3f17aa	christians are just jews that received their messiah. who was a jew!<br>  it would not hurt to learn traditions and even observe them, just like Jesus did. there are many messianic jews, that may also be an option. i would assume in-laws would be pleased with you learning jewish traditions.|`|RbumGQlJaa	They may have some problem, but it should not be big.  I did know two couples who were in similar situations.  One lived happily ever after, to say the least, and they have two wonderful children.

Men with a poor fund of knowledge and men who are not austere cannot understand the wonders of the individual atomic spark of spirit, even though it is explained by the greatest authority of knowledge, who imparted lessons even to Brahma, the first living being in the universe. Owing to a gross material conception of things, most men in this age cannot imagine how such a small particle can become both so great and so small. So men look at the soul proper as wonderful either by constitution or by description. Illusioned by the material energy, people are so engrossed in subject matter for sense gratification that they have very little time to understand the question of self-understanding, even though it is a fact that without this self-understanding all activities result in ultimate defeat in the struggle for existence. Perhaps one has no idea that one must think of the soul, and also make a solution of the material miseries.<br>     Some people who are inclined to hear about the soul may be attending lectures, in good association, but sometimes, owing to ignorance, they are misguided by acceptance of the Supersoul and the atomic soul as one without distinction of magnitude. It is very difficult to find a man who perfectly understands the position of the soul, the Supersoul, the atomic soul, their respective functions, relationships and all other major and minor details. And it is still more difficult to find a man who has actually derived full benefit from knowledge of the soul, and who is able to describe the position of the soul in different aspects. But if, somehow or other, one is able to understand the subject matter of the soul, then one's life is successful. The easiest process for understanding the subject matter of self, however, is to accept the statements of the Bhagavad-gita spoken by the greatest authority, Lord Krsna, without being deviated by other theories. But it also requires a great deal of penance and sacrifice, either in this life or in the previous ones, before one is able to accept Krsna as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Krsna can, however, be known as such by the causeless mercy of the pure devotee and by no other way.<br>  <br>  Bg 2.17 P         Contents of the Gita Summarized<br>     This verse more clearly explains the real nature of the soul, which is spread all over the body. Anyone can understand what is spread all over the body: it is consciousness. Everyone is conscious of the pains and pleasures of the body in part or as a whole. This spreading of consciousness is limited within one's own body. The pains and pleasures of one body are unknown to another. Therefore, each and every body is the embodiment of an individual soul, and the symptom of the soul's presence is perceived as individual consciousness. This soul is described as one ten-thousandth part of the upper portion of the hair point in size. The Svetasvatara Upanisad confirms this:<br>  <br>    balagra-sata-bhagasya satadha kalpitasya ca<br>    bhago jivah sa vijneyah sa canantyaya kalpate<br>  <br>     "When the upper point of a hair is divided into one hundred parts and again each of such parts is further divided into one hundred parts, each such part is the measurement of the dimension of the spirit soul." (Svet. 5.9) Similarly, in the Bhagavatam the same version is stated:<br>  <br>    kesagra-sata-bhagasya satamsah sadrsatmakah<br>    jivah suksma-svarupo 'yam sankhyatito hi cit-kanah<br>  <br>     "There are innumerable particles of spiritual atoms, which are measured as one ten-thousandth of the upper portion of the hair."<br>  <br>     Therefore, the individual particle of spirit soul is a spiritual atom smaller than the material atoms, and such atoms are innumerable. This very small spiritual spark is the basic principle of the material body, and the influence of such a spiritual spark is spread all over the body as the influence of the active principle of some medicine spreads throughout the body. This current of the spirit soul is felt all over the body as consciousness, and that is the proof of the presence of the soul. Any layman can understand that the material body minus consciousness is a dead body, and this consciousness cannot be revived in the body by any means of material administration. Therefore, consciousness is not due to any amount of material combination, but to the spirit soul. In the Mundaka Upanisad the measurement of the atomic spirit soul is further explained:<br>  <br>                    eso 'nur atma cetasa veditavyo<br>                   yasmin pranah pancadha samvivesa<br>                 pranais cittam sarvam otam prajanam<br>                  yasmin visuddhe vibhavaty esa atma<br>  <br>     "The soul is atomic in size and can be perceived by perfect intelligence. This atomic soul is floating in the five kinds of air [prana, apana, vyana, samana and udana], is situated within the heart, and spreads its influence all over the body of the embodied living entities. When the soul is purified from the contamination of the five kinds of material air, its spiritual influence is exhibited." (Mund. 3.1.9)|`|b3f4f6798be929d658ec38c5b998d657aa	Man (humans; men and women) alone have souls<br>  <br>  Genesis 2:7 <br>  ... from the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a living being.|`|mFy3M8mVaa	No, yes and yes.|`|84gK4XlHaa	I would think that anything with consciousness has a soul.

You shall have no other gods before me. <br>  (believe in God, no others)<br>         <br>     2. You shall not make for yourself any carved image, or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth; you shall not bow down to them nor serve them. For I, the Lord your God, am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children to the third and fourth generations of those who hate me, but showing mercy to thousands, to those who love Me and keep My commandments.<br>  (-do not worship things that are created- beasts, fish, other people)<br>         <br>     3.

Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days you shall labor and do all your work, but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord your God. In it you shall do no work: you, nor your son, nor your daughter, nor your manservant, nor your maidservant, nor your cattle, nor your stranger who is within your gates. For in six days the Lord made the heavens and the earth, the sea, and all that is in them, and rested the seventh day.

Honor your father and your mother, that your days may be long upon the land which the Lord your God is giving you.<br>  (-obey your parents, respect them)       <br>  <br>     6. You shall not murder.<br>         <br>     7. You shall not commit adultery.<br>  (-cheat/have an affair/ be with someone else other than your wife/husband)       <br>  <br>     8.

Sorry, but no one can tell me that is the "Word of God".<br>  <br>  I don't believe in a perfect book.  I believe in the Truth who came to us in human form as Jesus of Nazareth (John 14:6).  The Truth is not a book or a set of morals.  It is a person<br>  -- and Christ proclaims that Person to be LOVE.<br>  <br>  "The law came through Moses. Grace and truth came through Jesus Christ" (John 1:17).<br>  <br>  To delme:  Don't be arrogant.  How is the question "taking His Word out of context"?

(John 6:47; 11:25-26).<br>  <br>  Mohammed was swift to shed blood (Romans 3:15-17); Christ shed His own blood for the salvation of many (Ephesians 1:7).<br>  <br>  Mohammed preached "Death to the infidels!"; Christ prayed "Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do" (Luke 23:34).<br>  <br>  Mohammed declared a holy war (Jihad) against infidels; Christ achieved a holy victory on Calvary's cross (Colossians 2:14-15) and His followers share in that victory (John 16:33).<br>  <br>  Mohammed constrained people by conquest; Christ constrained people by love (2 Corinthians 5:14).<br>  <br>  Modern terrorists derive their inspiration from Mohammed and carry out their despicable atrocities in the name of his god; Christians derive their inspiration from the One who said, "Blessed are the peacemakers" (Matthew 5:9).<br>  <br>  Modern day disciples of Mohammed respond to the terrorist attacks by cheering in the streets; Modern day disciples of Christ are deeply grieved at past atrocities carried out by those who were "Christians" in name only (the Crusades, the Spanish Inquisition, etc.).<br>  <br>  Many Muslims are peaceful and peace-loving because they do not strictly follow the teachings of their founder; Many Christians are peaceful and peace-loving because they do strictly follow the teachings of their Founder (Romans 12:17-21).<br>  <br>  Mohammed said the Koran is authoritative only in Arabic, and only in his dialect; The Bible is authoritative in many languages around the world, for God knows all things and can inspire (and preserve) His Word in more than one language.<br>  <br>  Mohammed hated music; Jesus and His disciples sang hymns, and the Apostle commanded the Lord's Church to sing. (Matthew 26:30, Ephesians 5:19, Colossians 3:16).<br>  <br>  Mohammed allowed that a Mullah, Imam, or Mufti of Islam can be a terrorist and an amoral animal like Osama bin Laden; The Bible requires that a leader in the Church of the Lord Jesus Christ must be above reproach, and when this is not true, Christians demand such a fallen leader be removed from leadership. (1 Timothy 3:1-7, 5:19-20).<br>  <br>  Islam calls on its followers to observe Five Pillars, while all other aspects of life can be vulgar and not affect the Muslim's prospects in Paradise. The Bible calls on the Christian to submit to the total change of his life by the Spirit of God -- NO area of life and thought is the choice of the follower. (Romans 12:1-2).<br>  <br>  The Muslim looks forward to eternity in Paradise where there will be virgins who are used for eternal perpetual copulation.<br>  <br>  The Bible believing Christian looks forward to being with Jesus Christ and is delighted with that. (2 Corinthians 5:8).<br>  <br>  Mohammed said the witness of a woman was half the value of the witness of a man; and Muhammed said a woman goes to Paradise because she satisfies her husband sexually; The Bible teaches that a husband is to love his wife and be willing to die for her. (Ephesians 5:25).<br>  <br>  Mohammed called upon his servants to fight; Jesus said, "My kingdom is not of this world; if My kingdom were of this world, then would My servants fight . . . but now is My kingdom not from hence" (John 18:36).<br>  <br>  Mohammed ordered death to the Jews (see A. Guillaume, The Life of Muhammad, Oxford University Press [1975], p. 369); Christ ordered that the gospel be preached "to the Jew first" (Romans 1:16).<br>  <br>  The Koran says, "Fight in the cause of Allah" (Qu'ran 2.244); The Bible says, "we wrestle not against flesh and blood" and "the weapons of our warfare are not carnal" (Ephesians 6:12; 2 Corinthians 10:4).<br>  <br>  The Koran says, "Fight and slay the Pagans wherever ye find them" (Qu'ran 9.5); Christ said, "Preach the gospel to every creature" (Mark 16:15).<br>  <br>  The Koran says, "I will inspire terror into the hearts of unbelievers" (Qu'ran 8.12); God inspires His terror into the hearts of believers (Isaiah 8:13).<br>  <br>  The Koran (Qu'ran) is a terrorist manual which condones fighting, conflict, terror, slaughter, and gen|`|2Hot9EJiaa	No- God is the only one that is holy.  We cannot be holy without Him.  The one way that we can become holy is through the shed blood of Christ. It has nothing to do with us at all.

Christians don't "hope" god exists, they just try to have faith that he does.  <br>  <br>  The definition of faith is something like believing without knowing.<br>  <br>  (Ha ha ha, yeah I can just see the atheists reading this one)<br>   Now since your faith is something you must develop along your spiritual journey, it will never be perfect so it is hard to say that most Christian's can say yes to that question if they were to die if they had any doubt whatsoever in their answer.  On the flip side, in my own personal journey I have seen enough miracles  to say that I would have a hard time convincing myself god doesn't exist.  So its really wherever your at (I know a lot of people who just have a jesus high and they really don't count as having faith) <br>  <br>  To that second point, I'm afraid of the afterlife Personally, staying in one place forever (or just living forever) just scares the living daylights out of me.  However it is the infinite knowledge and love of God that makes me feel peace.  God himself really is the the only reason for my belief in god, the afterlife is just another fact of life to me.|`|CugCzH9iaa	Interesting and scarry at the same time.

I wear a purity ring on my right, index finger, that one of my children gave to me, as a gift.  My daughter said that I was the purest, best super dad in the world.  Although she is only 9 years old, and doesn't fully understand what a purity ring represents, she told me that if I wore a purity ring, those that came in contact with me, would also become pure and good.  That no matter how bad and naughty they were, they would somehow rub off of me.  I, for one, will be the first person to admit that I am not a pure individual.  But who's to say that I am not.  It all depends on a individuals interpretation of what purity represents. Or what defines purity altogether.  <br>  If a 9 year old child can attach her own, separate distinction of what a purity ring represents, how can that intention, be a target for corruption?  Targets for corruption, are labeled so, because we give them that corruptive element.  An intent to draw or create corruption, can only be created and caused by us.  Not some material possession.  You can consider gourmet chocolates like truffles, to be corruptive.  Does that mean you shouldn't indulge in them?  If a person considers his/herself, to be pure in any way, shape or form.  Who am I to say that, that person is corrupt.  Who gave me that right?  <br>  I once helped a dear friend get completely off of a heinous addiction.  It was a very slow, tumultuous process.  This individual had an addiction that spanned 25 years of his life.  Starting in junior high school.  When he was finally able to kick his habit, with no cravings related to his addiction whatsoever, all of his addict associates, accused me of corrupting him.  Corrupting him into finally kicking his nearly life long addiction.  Accused me of taking away their friend.  One person, even went as far as to call me EVIL and SELFISH.  I completely ignored him.  After I knocked out 2 of his remaining 5 teeth, of course.  Was I corrupt?  The only thing that I regret after helping my friend, who by the way, is going on his 10th year of being clean and sober, is knock out all 5 of his friends teeth, instead of just 2.  And all the teeth of his other, former associates, as well.  Other than that, if I was corrupting him for placing a ring around his heart, and protecting it with love and care, from my own heart, then I suppose you can say that I had made him a target for corruption.  <br>  By the way, if anyone is wondering.  The word "corrupt," comes from the Latin words "corruptus" and "corrumpere."  Which means.   "Break to pieces, destroy, ruin completely."   Yeah, I corrupted him.  Corrupted him into breaking, destroying and completely ruining his 25 year addiction to heroin.  Thank you for an awesome question.

7422ddf097669bd7b6e3d48e56258b87aa	Here's some detailed commentary for you.Study it carefully:<br>  <br>  Footnotes<br>  1 [1-15] Although these verses continue to reveal information about Paul's opponents and the differences he perceives between them and himself, 2 Cor 11:1 signals a turn in Paul's thought. This section constitutes a prologue to the boasting that he will undertake in 2 Cor 11:16-12:10, and it bears remarkable similarities to the section that follows the central boast, 2 Cor 12:11-18.<br>  <br>  2 [1] Put up with a little foolishness from me: this verse indicates more clearly than the general statement of intent in 2 Cor 10:13 the nature of the project Paul is about to undertake. He alludes ironically to the Corinthians' toleration for others. Foolishness: Paul qualifies his project as folly from beginning to end; see the note on 2 Cor 11:16-12:10. <br>  <br>  3 [2] Paul gives us a sudden glimpse of the theological values that are at stake. The jealousy of God: the perspective is that of the covenant, described in imagery of love and marriage, as in the prophets; cf 1 Cor 10:22. I betrothed you: Paul, like a father (cf 2 Cor 12:14), betroths the community to Christ as his bride (cf Eph 5:21-33) and will present her to him at his second coming. Cf Matthew 25:1-13 and the nuptial imagery in Rev 21.<br>  <br>  4 [3] As the serpent deceived Eve: before Christ can return for the community Paul fears a repetition of the primal drama of seduction. Corruption of minds is satanic activity (see 2 Cor 2:11; 4:4). Satanic imagery recurs in 2 Cor 11:13-15, 20; 12:7b, 16-17; see the notes on these passages.<br>  <br>  5 [4] Preaches another Jesus: the danger is specified, and Paul's opponents are identified with the cunning serpent. The battle for minds has to do with the understanding of Jesus, the Spirit, the gospel; the Corinthians have flirted with another understanding than the one that Paul handed on to them as traditional and normative.<br>  <br>  6 [5] These "superapostles": this term, employed again in 2 Cor 12:11b, designates the opponents of whom Paul has spoken in 2 Cor 10 and again in 2 Cor 11:4. They appear to be intruders at Corinth. Their preaching is marked at least by a different emphasis and style, and they do not hesitate to accept support from the community. Perhaps these itinerants appeal to the authority of church leaders in Jerusalem and even carry letters of recommendation from them. But it is not those distant leaders whom Paul is attacking here. The intruders are "superapostles" not in the sense of the "pillars" at Jerusalem (Gal 2), but in their own estimation. They consider themselves superior to Paul as apostles and ministers of Christ, and they are obviously enjoying some success among the Corinthians. Paul rejects their claim to be apostles in any superlative sense (hyperlian), judging them bluntly as "false apostles," ministers of Satan masquerading as apostles of Christ (2 Cor 11:13-15). On the contrary, he himself will claim to be a superminister of Christ (hyper ego, 2 Cor 11:23).<br>  <br>  7 [6] Apparently found deficient in both rhetorical ability (cf 2 Cor 10:10) and knowledge (cf 2 Cor 10:5), Paul concedes the former charge but not the latter. In every way: in all their contacts with him revelation has been taking place. Paul, through whom God reveals the knowledge of himself (2 Cor 2:14), and in whom the death and life of Jesus are revealed (2 Cor 4:10-11; cf 2 Cor 6:4), also demonstrates his own role as the bearer of true knowledge. Cf 1 Cor 1:18-2:16.<br>  <br>  8 [7-10] Abruptly Paul passes to another reason for complaints: his practice of preaching without remuneration (cf 1 Cor 9:3-18). He deftly defends his practice by situating it from the start within the pattern of Christ's own self-humiliation (cf 2 Cor 10:1) and reduces objections to absurdity by rhetorical questions (cf 2 Cor 12:13).<br>  <br>  9 [11-12] Paul rejects lack of affection as his motive (possibly imputed to him by his opponents) and states his real motive, a desire to emphasize the disparity between himself and the others (cf 2 Cor 11:19-21). The topic of his gratuitous service will be taken up once more in 2 Cor 12:13-18. 1 Cor 9:15-18 gives a different but complementary explanation of his motivation.<br>  <br>  10 [13-15] Paul picks up again the imagery of 2 Cor 11:3 and applies it to the opponents: they are false apostles of Christ, really serving another master. Deceitful . . . masquerade: deception and simulation, like cunning (2 Cor 11:3), are marks of the satanic. Angel of light: recalls the contrast between light and darkness, Christ and Beliar at 2 Cor 6:14-15. Ministers of righteousness: recalls the earlier contrast between the ministry of condemnation and that of righteousness (2 Cor 3:9). Their end: the section closes with another allusion to the judgment, when all participants in the final conflict will be revealed or unmasked and dealt with as they deserve.<br>  <br>  11 [11:16-12:10] Paul now accepts the challenge of his opponents and indulges in boasting similar to theirs, but with differences that|`|dASHruataa	I put up with it?

He was saying how easily they accept some other preaching of Jesus. Please look at the previous verse, verse 3 for reference. <br>  3 But I am afraid that just as Eve was deceived by the serpent's cunning, your minds may somehow be led astray from your sincere and pure devotion to Christ. <br>  Paul is stating that his followers are being deceived by another Jesus. Now compare verse 3 with verse 4:4For if someone comes to you and preaches a Jesus other than the Jesus we preached, or if you receive a different spirit from the one you received, or a different gospel from the one you accepted, you put up with it easily enough. Also, compare verse 4 to verses 12 through 14 where he is stating that those who teach another Jesus are as Satan who is a deceiver.<br>  Verses 12 through 14:<br>  I will keep on doing what I am doing in order to cut the ground from under those who want an opportunity to be considered equal with us in the things they boast about. 13For such men are false apostles, deceitful workmen, masquerading as apostles of Christ. 14And no wonder, for Satan himself masquerades as an angel of light. 15It is not surprising, then, if his servants masquerade as servants of righteousness.

X9rXRNUxaa	Isaiah 49 - <br>  Glorious things had been spoken in the previous chapters concerning the deliverance of the Jews out of Babylon; but lest any should think, when it was accomplished, that it looked much greater and brighter in the prophecy than in the performance, and that the return of about 40,000 Jews in a poor condition out of Babylon to Jerusalem was not an event sufficiently answering to the height and grandeur of the expressions used in the prophecy, he here comes to show that the prophecy had a further intention, and was to have its full accomplishment in a redemption that should as far outdo these expressions as the other seemed to come short of them, even the redemption of the world by Jesus Christ, of whom not only Cyrus, who was God's servant in foretelling it, was a type. In this chapter we have,  I. The designation of Christ, under the type of Isaiah, to his office as Mediator (Isa_49:1-3).  II. The assurance given him of the success of his undertaking among the Gentiles (Isa_49:4-8).  III. The redemption that should be wrought by him, and the progress of that redemption (Isa_49:9-12).  IV. The encouragement given hence to the afflicted church (Isa_49:13-17).  V. The addition of many to it, and the setting up of a church among the Gentiles (Isa_49:18-23).  VI. A ratification of the prophecy of the Jews' release out of Babylon, which was to be the figure and type of all these blessings, (Isa_49:24-26). If this chapter be rightly understood, we shall see ourselves to be more concerned in the prophecies relating to the Jews' deliverance out of Babylon than we thought we were.<br>  <br>  May God bless you as you study His Word<br>  <br>  <:)))><|`|VzIWDuRzaa	AMEN Sister.

Like in school I look at them and if I liked their style or their hairstyle, I'd admire that and would want something that they'd have. Not jealously, just improvement lol.

(Ezekiel 18:4) But sometimes wicked angels, called demons, pretend to be the spirits of the dead.

Most people would readily acknowledge that happiness depends more on factors like good health, a purpose in life, and fine relationships with others. A Bible proverb puts it this way: "Better is a dish of vegetables where there is love than a manger-fed bull and hatred along with it."—Proverbs 15:17.<br>  <br>  Sadly, however, our earthly home has a long history of hatred, violence, and other forms of wickedness. But what about heaven, or the spirit realm, where many people hope to go after they die? Has it always been a place of blissful peace and tranquillity, without disturbance of any kind, as is commonly supposed?<br>  <br>  The Bible teaches that God resides in heaven along with millions of spirit creatures called angels. (Matthew 18:10; Revelation 5:11) These are described as spirit "sons of God." (Job 38:4, 7) Like humans, the angels also have free moral agency; they are not robots. It follows, therefore, that they too can choose to do right or to do wrong. Would angels choose to do wrong? It may come as a surprise to some to learn that thousands of years ago, a considerable number of angels did, in fact, sin against God—they rebelled against him!—Jude 6.<br>  <br>  Why Some Do Go to Heaven<br>  Many readers of the Bible, however, are aware of Jesus' words: "In the house of my Father there are many abodes. . . . I am going my way to prepare a place for you." (John 14:2, 3) Does this not contradict the idea of life everlasting on a paradise earth?<br>  <br>  These teachings are not contradictory. In fact, one supports the other. To begin with, the Bible states that only a limited number of faithful Christians—namely, 144,000 of them—are raised as spirit creatures to live in heaven. Why are they given this wonderful reward? Because they make up the group that John saw in a vision who "came to life and ruled as kings with the Christ for a thousand years." (Revelation 14:1, 3; 20:4-6) Compared with the billions on earth, the 144,000 truly are a "little flock." (Luke 12:32) Moreover, having experienced the problems common to humankind, like Jesus they will be able to "sympathize with our weaknesses" as they supervise the rehabilitation of mankind and of the earth.—Hebrews 4:15.<br>  <br>  Earth—Mankind's Eternal Home<br>  By providing the ransom sacrifice of Jesus Christ, God began gathering the 144,000 almost 2,000 years ago, and indications are that this group is now complete. (Acts 2:1-4; Galatians 4:4-7) However, Jesus' sacrifice was not for the sins of the 144,000 only, "but also for the whole world's." (1 John 2:2) Hence, all who exercise faith in Jesus have the prospect of eternal life. (John 3:16) Those asleep in the grave but who are in God's memory will be resurrected, not to heaven, but to life on a cleansed earth. (Ecclesiastes 9:5; John 11:11-13, 25; Acts 24:15) What will await them there?<br>  <br>  Revelation 21:1-4 answers, saying: "Look! The tent of God is with mankind . . . And he will wipe out every tear from their eyes, and death will be no more, neither will mourning nor outcry nor pain be anymore. The former things have passed away." Imagine—humans being released from death, and the pain and outcry it causes gone forever! At last, Jehovah's original purpose for the earth and humankind will reach its glorious fulfillment.—Genesis 1:27, 28.<br>  <br>  bible gives us time to b with our love ones, but not now it's in the future. JEHOVAH will do it in the near future|`|ixHwF4apaa	there is one thing called medium,in black magic, by which any body can talk, converse with the dead person. <br>  find out the person who is practising that.<br>  some countries such as india, africa are practising that.<br>  i do not know how could you contact them|`|zMcHYQeBaa	That's kinda gross, don't you think?

S4XUl7qWaa	If a young person is told over and over that an inherent part of their being is "perverted" and that all they have to do is "choose" to be somebody else entirely other than who they are, if their family and social group repeatedly rejects, taunts or makes false accusations toward them based upon these misguided and damaging assumptions, I can see how even the strongest person would consider ending it all. I have seen it happen, and it's really sad. Yes, religiously based prejudice plays a key part in the suicide rate of young gay people.|`|TyRfv0eoaa	I think that religious oppression and the misinformation they spread is the leading factor.<br>  <br>  I was suicidal at the age of 19. The cause? My pastor kept telling me I was going to take my own life because I was gay.<br>  <br>  I didn't. And I don't blame God for that man's fear and ignorance.|`|4rWPX8CTaa	Yeah, a big part. I think religion makes people think they're filthy sinners and a god hates them. This can't be good for self confidence and the sad thing is; it's all a load of bullshit.

It sucks.|`|FhHklqkhaa	I do think religion plays a big part<br>  I also think that society has been so influenced by christianity's homophobia that even atheists are homophobic<br>  immorality is a religious term<br>  not everyone whose gay does feel suicide thankfully|`|7f0ZVPt8aa	Yes, it's the influence of religion. Bad religion. Tsk tsk|`|wMFfGkIRaa	I think it is society and immorality....No one should commit suicide.|`|Co22S0viaa	I don't think being gay has anything to do with suicide in my opinion.I'm a very proud,spiritual gay female.I been with my fiancee for eight and a half years.I believe suicide has to deal with your ability and will to live.Religion and spirituality are two different things!Religion is your way of life.Example,waking up,taking a shower,getting dressed!Routine things!Spirituality has to do with "inner strength and a personal,spiritual connection with "God",Universe or The divine".Being able to understand your "purpose,essence and establishing an identity"!Developing an "inner connection with "God","Spirit",whatever names you call it!I'm spiritual,not religious!|`|pSfW0ROmaa	Unfortunately, some of us Christians can be very judgemental and un-Christ like sometimes. Suicide is never the answer- hang in there. Jesus loves you.
DyMm1bKEaa	prankster|`|K21EOmJ9aa	Sir, religion is a private matter if you really believe in what you preach, regardless of your sect, church or faith.  From my experience, the ones who really are spiritual, don't go around to change some one's religion or for that matter preach every chance they get.  Religion is not science, it is completely based on faith, which is fine, as long as we don't try to impose it on others, or claim to know who is going to heaven and who is not.  There are actions that are universally good and evil irrelevant of who, where and how they are practiced, so let God judge us.  If you want peace in this world, which I think God wants also, its best not exploit religion for political or monetary reasons. Actions speaks louder than words.|`|AA11743216	what really gets me is if all of the faiths took the main<br>  issue or verse they emphasize in their faith <br>  and put them all together we would have<br>  the perfect faith<br>  <br>  the jws spread the word<br>  the apostolics baptize in jesus name- acts 2:38<br>  the catholics take communion regularly<br>  the mennonites dress modest and dont get caught up in the<br>  world<br>  the church of God helps lead people to the baptism of<br>  the Holy Ghost acts 2:4<br>  <br>  I could go on and on, but the truth is denomination will<br>  never save you, because each one has its own traits<br>  and each one LACKS what it should have.<br>  <br>  Jesus said the Kingdom of God is within YOU<br>  thats when I realized it will never be a church or<br>  organization that gets me right with God<br>  It will be Gods Holy Spirit and me being responsible for<br>  my own faith.|`|asb7PCZeaa	Please don't knock on me door.<br>  <br>  And if it's true only a few hundred thousand of you are going into the atmosphere, don't you think you could increase your odds by not proselytizing?<br>  <br>  Nice rant, btw.|`|6w1e6zUVaa	Based on your last question:  Haaaaaaaaaaaa.

I think it more likely that he did (just personal opinion) although I obviously do not believe he was anything other than a normal man.

If you are having questions, doubts, feeling angry, mad at God, I DON'T think he is judging you...if you are a child of God he ALREADY knows (Biblical quote) what you are thinking and what is in your heart, so you might as well take it to Him in prayer, right?<br>  I don't think God wants "memorized" prayers that say the same thing over and over...and I cannot believe he would want us to LIE in our prayers or NOT PRAY AT ALL, because talking to a "parent" is what a parent child relationship is all about! So the only thing left is to believe he WANTS us to come to Him with all our thoughts, no matter WHAT. He is the POWERFUL one and only GOD...so I think he can handle the answer to your questions or thoughts. Quite often when I am angry, hurt or filled with sorrow, I speak to Him and say what I am thinking. AND quite often....REALLY OFTEN he sends me a message that totally shows me my answer...sometime, a little on the scary side, so be prepared. These I call "Miracles" that God gives us everyday, if we are watching for them, to show us and PROVE to us that He IS ALIVE and well and that He is LISTENING!<br>  This certainly isn't a "judgement matter."<br>  Blessings<br>  Bunny7|`|rGEZup0Zaa	Does that mean you'll have wood on judgment day?<br>  <br>  Since you're very much in love with God n' all.

Since Christians hold that the serpent in the Bible represents Satan, one might wonder about this. In Genesis 3:1 <a href="http://www.blueletterbible.org/Bible.cfm?b=Gen&c=3#top" rel="nofollow">http://www.blueletterbible.org/Bible.cfm...</a>  the Bible describes the serpent as "more subtil than any beast..." Some early Gnostic heretics believed that Satan and Jesus were the same. They may have used sayings such as this to support their belief.<br>  <br>  It seems odd that Jesus would resort to the metaphorical "sheep" instead of sheep-dogs or some other noble animal. The awkward fact remains: people raise sheep to either fleece them or kill them for food. To send them as prey in the midst of marauders hardly seems advisable.<br>  <br>  Note also that doves actually act just the opposite of "harmless." Doves sometimes act viciously against other birds.<br>  <br>  <br>  ~*~ NOT SOLICITATION ~*~|`|YUAegpPoaa	Luckily there is no third admonishment to have "the eye of an eagle".<br>  <br>  If you are anything like me your eagle eyes are 'lost' on the top of your head.|`|jBYxEX8taa	Wise as one.

In other words, when they turn into "women", then they get married off. <br>  <a href="http://www.answering-christianity.com/aisha.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.answering-christianity.com/ai...</a><br>  <br>  Now, the big Q. is:<br>  <br>  why nobody is talking about such examples?? why only talking about the prophet Mohamed peace be upon him??<br>  <br>  as I said once, only ignorants ask such Q. people with no knowledge at all.|`|iH7ZB5Soaa	Qur'an orders war against hostility.Not against the innocent people.<br>  Regarding to 9 years old girl:Her real age could be different and the social traditions of that age should be considered.<br>   Such vile doubts cannot be directed at that lofty one!

His then having numerous wives after the age of forty, that is, when bodily heat subsides and the passions are quietened, is evidence proving decisively and self-evidently to those who are even a little fair-minded that such marriages were not to satisfy the carnal appetites, but were for other important reasons and instances of wisdom.|`|Ilc0eEGOaa	whether you like or not believed or not he is the greatest and best human ever been on earth.<br>  <br>  only people with pure hearts can know whats islam.<br>  <br>  there is no point from arguing with people like you....i just feel sorry for people like you... you don't know what are you losing.|`|MhbEQoJYaa	You obciously have not read the Quran, Hadith or EVEN YOUR OWN BIBLE!|`|cfusEJPFaa	Everything about Islam comes from the lips of Muhammad.

Whilst I do not reject Hadith, I have always felt that all Hadith should be subjected to greater scrutiny based upon more parameters one such being mathematical conformity. <br>  <br>  (2) - 16-19 proof: Having done research, some mathematical reasoning and having read the following scholarly articles <br>  <a href="http://www.maraisburg.co.za/index_files/Page2506.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.maraisburg.co.za/index_files/...</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.iiie.net/node/59" rel="nofollow">http://www.iiie.net/node/59</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.muslim.org/islam/aisha-age.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.muslim.org/islam/aisha-age.ph...</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.islamicity.com/articles/Articles.asp?ref=ic0811-3718" rel="nofollow">http://www.islamicity.com/articles/Artic...</a>  and viewed the following video <a href="http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=NyqV7D7q5lE&feature=related," rel="nofollow">http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=NyqV7D7q5l...</a> it became clear that her age was much greater, either 14-20 or 16-19. Through mathematical deduction this is abundantly clear. <br>  (2) - 16-19 proof: Consider that Aisha (ra) had a sister whose name was Asma (ra) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asma_bint_Abi_Bakr" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asma_bint_A...</a> who was 10 years older than Aisha (ra). This sister Asma (ra) died at an age of 100 years in the year 73(AH), as such this logically means she was born in the year 27(BH), if she was supposed to be 10 years older than Aisha (ra) it threfore logically means that Aisha (ra) was born in the year 17(BH) and since we are told she married our beloved Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) a little after the Hijrah (1AH) it clearly means she was 18 years old when she got married. <br>  - Alternatively, one can look at this same proof in another way as we are told that Aisha (ra) died in the year 58(AH) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aishah" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aishah</a> and her sister Asma died in the year 73(AH) aged 100 which means there is a 15 year gap between the years of death for these two sisters and as such it means that Asma (ra) was 85 years old when her younger sister Aisha (ra) passed away and logically it means that Aisha (ra) had to be 75 years old when she died, as such if she got married some 57 years earlier it means once more she was 18 years old when she got married. <br>  (3) 14-20 proof: Consider also that Fatima (ra) was 5 years older than Aisha (ra) as mentioned In Asad Al-Ghaba’s collection of traditions (volume 4, page 377) it is reported: Fatima (ra) was about 5 years older than Ayesha (ra). Okay, now we know that Fatima (ra) died in the same year as her father Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) ie: 11(AH) and the most accurate age at which she is considered to have died is 30 as per the following "Zubair bin Bakar narrated to Abdallah bin Al-Hasan that he was with Hisham bin Abdulmaalik and Kalbi. Hisham made an inquiry of Abdallah, "How old was Fatima bint RasoolAllah?" Abdallah replied, "30 years old." After this he asked Kalbi the same question and Kalbi replied, "35 years old." Upon hearing this Hisham said to Abdallah, "Listen to what Kalbi is saying," and Hisham gave more importance to Kalbi’s testimony. Then Abdallah said, "Oh ameer al-momineen! Ask me about my mother and ask Kalbi about his." (Istia’ab, vol. 6, pg. 752) " So if she died at age 30 it means that Aisha (ra) would have to be age 25 and since she got married some 10 years earlier, it would mean she was 15 when she got married and if one were to go by Fatima (ra) being 35 when she died as above, it would therefore mean that Aisha (ra) would have been 20 when she got married. <br>  -Alternatively. Also as mentioned above in Asad Al-Ghabaa's collection of traditions (volume 4, page 377) it is reported:<br>  Fatima (RA) was about 5 years older than Ayesha (RA). <br>  Hence, to find out Aisha's (ra) birth date we must find out Fatima's (ra). <br>  "Abbas went to Ali's house, and Fatima was saying to Ali that she was older than him. So Abbas told Fatima that she was born in the year the Quraish were building the Kaaba and Ali was born a few years before that" (Al-Ghaba, vol. 4, pg. 280). <br>  Fatima (ra) was born in the year the Quraish were building the Kaaba and when the messenger (pbuh) of Allah was 35 years old (Al-Ghaba, vol. 4, pg. 377) <br>  Fatima is the daughter of RasoolAllah. Khadija was her mother. Fatima was born in the year the Kaaba was being built, and that was 5 years before the nabuwwah (Tabqaat ibn Saad, vol. 8, pg. 11). <br>  We all know our Prophet (pbuh) was 40 years old when he received Nabuwwah and he was approx 54 when he married Aisha (ra), as such from above if Fatima was 5 at the time of nabuwwah, it means Aisha (ra) who was born then would have then been 14 when she married our Beloved Prophet (pbuh) some 14 years later<br>   <br>  So here we have it, 3 ages for when she married, (1) 6-9 years, (2) approx 16-19 years, (3) 14-20 years. Two out of three of the above logical deductions show she was a teenager when she got married and not a child, hence we can safely deduce that the greater likelihood is that she was a teenager and therefore mature when she married, we will never know for sure but logical deductions clearly prove she was a teenager. Salam to all of you|`|stD14wWaaa	First of all, Our Prophet (SAW) is not a saint. There are no saints in Islam. He is a Prophet and a Messenger chosen by God to convey His message to mankind.<br>  The battles of the Prophet of Islam against the infidels were, needless to say, meant to remove those brutal selfish pagans from the scene who for the sake of their own satanic passions and desires inflicted all kinds of oppression against God's pure creatures and prevented the promulgation of Islamic precepts and beliefs. He only fought to bring about conditions of justice and equity under which human beings could materialize the ideology of world peace and mutual understanding. <br>  Can such a war be considered illegitimate and unjust? It goes without saying that such struggles are necessary and that no Prophet could avoid combating those who intend to bring ruin on human societies and cause corruption and social decay. No doubt any wise, humanitarian person accepts such combat and admires it because there is no other way to achieve the sacred ends of the Prophets. <br>  Jesus Christ, peace be upon him, had a short prophetic life and lived under conditions that did not permit war, so he did not attempt any wars. Otherwise, he too would have destroyed the weeds and troublemakers of human society. <br>  Regarding the Prophet's (SAW) marriage to Aisha (RA), we just want to clarify that there is a purpose for this marriage and primarily it was to strengthening the Muslims by all bonds, same reason as some of his other marriages, to build ties between communities. Since Aisha was the daughter of Abu Bakr, who belonged to the Banu Taym sub-clan of the tribe of Quraysh, the tribe to which Muhammad (SAW) also belonged.<br>  And one more clarification is that the marriage was not consumated until Aisha matured and was ready to get married. In hot places, people mature very early and 9 years old at that time is mature enough.<br>  <br>  I hope I clarified your doubts and May Allah forgive me if I taught you wrong.|`|Qvc0tVOnaa	Watch this it will answer your questions! <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iB_R6RU8KrI&watch_response" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iB_R6RU8K...</a>|`|N8QLKpCMaa	Muhammad is not saint but prophet & messenger of Allah,<br>  His marriage was with a little girl by order of Allah, Early marriage is not a sin, there has been evidences of their marriage but no evidence of any immoral & brutal crime,<br>  it was an early marriage which was used later on , not same time, is not is Good ?<br>  there is no evidence that prophet did some wrong with her etc...<br>  So what your objection is & why.<br>  thing is simple he married a young girl & there marriage consumed in later age.<br>  what objectionable you find, there was no issue, Aysha had no complaints to him, right !<br>  Allah is merciful, orders to fight for defense of self & faith, killing non muslims is not virtue unless it is a war for defense of faith & muslims.<br>  <br>  you know in USA 9 year old & 13 year old girls are pregnant & get free  abortions , their families not knowing all.<br>  is this brutality to them from an unkind society or early marriage is ??????<br>  <br>  Don't you know marriage is better then adultery in Usa !<br>  So early marriage is !<br>  <br>  you better know !

Now take a look at Deborah in Judges 4. Deborah was a judge and obviously a leader of Israel. God can choose anyone to lead his people, young or old, male or female. It was Deborah who encouraged Barak into battle telling him that the Lord would be with him. Barak not only went into battle but he took Deborah with him. <br>  1 Cor. 14:34-35. The women in Corinth were getting a bit excited about their new found freedom in Christ. They thought this freedom gave them the right to question the men in public worship causing division. Paul was just stating here that the women were to ask their husbands at home. Remember also that in those days they did not receive formal religious education as did the men.<br>  1Tim.2:11 Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection. The word "silence" is often translated "be in quietness" expressing an attitude of composure.<br>  v.12 But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be in silence. Paul's words "I suffer not" (I never let), can be more literally translated "I am not allowing." Paul was here prohibiting the Ephesian women from teaching. The women in Ephesians were new converts and caught up like the women in Corinth with their new found freedom. When you read the verses before you can see that these women were caught up in the outward adorning rather than the inner beauty of knowing Christ. <br>  Paul did not forbid all women from teaching men.

You know how I feel about the Apostle Paul teaching. Go with Serene answer because she is 100 percent right. Like I told you before with my mom. She was the head of the house since my step dad did not know how to read and most of the time he did not understand what the preacher said. So if we had to depend on John to teach us at home, we would have never been taught the truth. The one thing that people need to understand about the bible, if Paul knew that african slaves in our generation would have been treated the way they were when it came to reading and not being taught scripture correctly, I'm sure he wouldn't have written the letters. Paul can only write for the things he see. This is why I tell people, read and learn. Don't just read and go for it. Use common sense.|`|c2fc70c8196fb6665f4605b33bcc57a4aa	(1 Timothy 2:12-15) I do not permit a woman to teach, or to exercise authority over a man, but to be in silence. 13?For Adam was formed first, then Eve. 14?Also, Adam was not deceived, but the woman was thoroughly deceived and came to be in transgression. 15?However, she will be kept safe through childbearing, provided they continue in faith and love and sanctification along with soundness of mind.<br>  <br>  This is in relation to being a church "leader".

kdo6qnS9aa	The "seven spirits of God" are mentioned in Revelation 1:4; 3:1; 4:5; and 5:6. The seven spirits of God are not specifically identified, so it’s impossible to be dogmatic. Revelation 1:4 mentions that the seven spirits are before God's throne. Revelation 3:1 indicates that Jesus Christ "holds" the seven spirits of God. Revelation 4:5 links the seven spirits of God with seven burning lamps that are before God's throne. Revelation 5:6 identifies the seven spirits with the "seven eyes" of the Lamb and states that they are "sent out into all the earth."|`|jKiCcz20aa	Revelation 5:6<br>  "Then I saw a Lamb, looking as if it had been slain, standing in the centre of the throne, encircled by the four living creatures and the elders.

ur3vgbXoaa	Ha!  That is so funny about the bangs!  I think I went to school with you!  <br>  <br>  I remember my mother giving me a Tonette permanent and if I would have had any idea how to do it at that tender age - I would have killed myself!<br>  <br>  Talk about burnt to a crisp!|`|XEbrGfZuaa	When I was little, my mother had my hair cut in a salon. Then she<br>  decided she liked the look of braids. So I went through several years<br>  of that. She'd tie them up into loops and put ribbons on them to hold<br>  the loops together. I must have looked like a Russian refugee. I never<br>  realized how old fashioned that was, until seeing pictures of old dates<br>  in magazines of the turn of the century.<br>     Then when I was in 5th or 6th grade, it was cut again. And this<br>  time I became acquainted the hard way with the home permanent. I<br>  can still smell that rankness, that could easily overwhelm anyone.<br>  And those pinched tight perm rollers, were something else. Then<br>  it was laying my head back while the cold solution could be poured<br>  over the tightly curled hair. And then I think I had to sit and wait til<br>  it was timed to perfection. Much like a roast, in the oven. After that<br>  was up, then I think I had a white creamy solution poured over after<br>  the rollers were removed. At some point, my hair was dried, and if<br>  the toning solution was successful, then I didn't wear a singed look with burned hair ends. Otherwise, I probably looked like a refugee from<br>  'Fright Night", or something from a lions den. <br>     I don't remember how many perms I did have growing up. But they<br>  were something I soon learned to dread, with much anxiety. The <br>  solution was enough to take my breath away. And then having to sit<br>  and wait until the solution set, was really hard to do. I didn't have many<br>  salon perms, as I have worn my hair short for more years than I can<br>  remember. I wore it short in highschool for much of the time when it<br>  was the most popular style, next to the long rolled ends or the pony<br>  tail.<br>      Boys were so lucky. They only had to decide how short they <br>  wanted their hair cut. Well until the 70s, when men started getting<br>  perms too, after the Afro took off. Then they got the experience of a<br>  lifetime. I'll bet each of them, remember having a perm for the first<br>  time. You don't forget that smell.|`|7xGtL1vxaa	Sure, all the time. I hated perm day. Back then the fumes were so strong and they dripped and ran into you eyes making them burn. Whoa, that brought back some memories.|`|80lWqRFiaa	Mom always kept our hair cut short, but no perms, we all had naturally curly hair.|`|fc61095727fe8a17ac058f0c1b8e3bf2aa	Never got a home hair cut and my mom only tried a home perm once.<br>  I got to go to my mom's hair dresser with her on Saturdays.|`|LQ52bOFFaa	My mother cut my hair for years and years.

I got my brothers butch wax and pasted it down!!!!  I'm sure that looked good!!!LOL!!!|`|0rpN2419aa	You betcha!  Toni!  Pink, blue and white rollers for different sizes.  Back in my younger years a poodle cut and perm was fairly popular. Do you remember those?  Short curly hair all over...so funny.|`|rJJhMQ37aa	When I was little, Mama always cut my hair straight around from ear lobe to ear lobe.  Finished it with straight bangs on my forehead.  Sort of like a dutchboy style.  Hated that.  My hair was so straight and fine, you couldn't do anything with it.<br>  <br>  When I became a teen, Mom cut my hair the same way, and put in perms.  Now, if i hated the dutchboy thing, I reeeeaally hated the dutchboy with a perm in it.  Took forever to do the perm.  It burned and itched.  Was cold, running through my hair.  I made up my mind that when I grew up I was never, never, never going  to have another home perm.<br>  <br>  I have had salon perms.  They're not fun, but a whole lot easier to take than those home jobs.

That is crazy thinking.  God may at times send a sign to someone, but they will understand it as that. We are told, however, to not expect signs and not to put God to the test. Also the angel of darkness can come disguised as an angel of light, so one should not take anything out of the ordinary as from God.

The Rosary shall be a powerful armor against Hell, it will destroy vice, decrease sin, and defeat heresies.<br>  4. It will cause virtue and good works to flourish; it will obtain for souls the abundant mercy of God; it will withdraw the hearts of men from the love of the world and its vanities and will lift them to the desire of eternal things.

Whoever shall recite the Rosary devoutly, applying himself to the consideration of its sacred mysteries, shall never be conquered by misfortune. God will not chastise him in His justice, he shall not perish by an unprovided death; if he be just, he shall remain in the grace of God and become worthy of eternal life.<br>  7. Whoever shall have a true devotion for the Rosary shall not die without the Sacraments of the Church.<br>  8. Those who are faithful to recite the Rosary shall have during their life and at their death the light of God and the plenitude of His graces; at the moment of death, they shall participate in the merits of the saints in Paradise.<br>  9. I shall deliver from Purgatory those who have been devoted to the Rosary.<br>  10. The faithful children of the Rosary shall merit a high degree of glory in Heaven.<br>  11. You shall obtain all you ask of me by the recitation of the Rosary.<br>  12. All those who propagate the Holy Rosary shall be aided by me in their necessities.<br>  13. I have obtained from my Divine Son that all the advocates of the Rosary shall have for intercessors the entire Celestial Court during their life and at the hour of death.<br>  14. All who recite the Rosary are my sons, and brothers of my only Son, Jesus Christ.<br>  15.

God sends me signs like this. pray for answers and he will answer either in a mysterious way, or maybe he will talk to you, and you will find out weather it is a sign or not. the answer may or may not come instantly and sometimes you will have to search for the answer and think to figure it out.<br>  <br>  hope i helped :)<br>  <br>  x|`|3l6DE1m0aa	In terms of the kind of sign you are speaking of, I say an emphatic "No."  God expects us to seek wisdom from Him, but we all need to make decisions the best we can instead of hoping for a big "This Way" sign for every thing we have to do.  When tough times come, one thing to think is that life is just like that.  Maybe ask God what he wants you to learn, and thank him for stickin with you through those challenges.  God does provide guidance, but not by means of signs.|`|zLfIp3NMaa	the only sign is that you live in a fallen world, you are not supposed to be sick ...

Yes, I truly believe that God sends signs, but usually, unless your a Christian, they can likely go by undetected. For Christians, there are several ways God can send signs. Praying can really help. God can send signs through other people, Christian or non-Christian. For example, let's say you pray to God for encouragement. By doing this, God may send people for you to meet that do just this. He may send signs through events that take place in your life, whether bad or good. It really is hard to explain some examples, but maybe you sort of get the idea. Perhaps God has brought you to this website to help you get to know God and our Savior Jesus Christ.

X9rXRNUxaa	See the dominion he is advanced to, and the throne he has above every throne (Isa_9:6): The government shall be upon his shoulder - his only. He shall not only wear the badge of it upon his shoulder (the key of the house of David, Isa_22:22), but he shall bear the burden of it. The Father shall devolve it upon him, so that he shall have an incontestable right to govern; and he shall undertake it, so that no doubt can be made of his governing well, for he shall set his shoulder to it, and will never complain, as Moses did, of his being overcharged. I am not able to bear all this people, Num_11:11, Num_11:14. Glorious things are here spoken of Christ's government, Isa_9:7. [1.] That it shall be an increasing government. It shall be multiplied; the bounds of his kingdom shall be more and more enlarged, and many shall be added to it daily. The lustre of it shall increase, and it shall shine more and more brightly in the world. The monarchies of the earth were each less illustrious than the other, so that what began in gold ended in iron and clay, and every monarchy dwindled by degrees; but the kingdom of Christ is a growing kingdom, and will come to perfection at last. [2.] That it shall be a peaceable government, agreeable to his character as the prince of peace. He shall rule by love, shall rule in men's hearts; so that wherever his government is there shall be peace, and as his government increases the peace shall increase. The more we are subject to Christ the more easy and safe we are. [3.] That it shall be a rightful government. He that is the Son of David shall reign upon the throne of David and over his kingdom, which he is entitled to. God shall give him the throne of his father David, Luk_1:32, Luk_1:33. The gospel church, in which Jew and Gentile are incorporated, is the holy hill of Zion, on which Christ reigns, Psa_2:6. [4.] That it shall be administered with prudence and equity, and so as to answer the great end of government, which is the establishment of the kingdom: He shall order it, and settle it, with justice and judgment. Every thing is, and shall be, well managed, in the kingdom of Christ, and none of his subjects shall ever have cause to complain. [5.] That it shall be an everlasting kingdom: There shall be no end of the increase of his government (it shall be still growing), no end of the increase of the peace of it, for the happiness of the subjects of this kingdom shall last to eternity and perhaps shall be progressive in infinitum - for ever. He shall reign henceforth even for ever; not only throughout all generations of time, but, even when the kingdom shall be delivered up to God even the Father, the glory both of the Redeemer and the redeemed shall continue eternally. [6.] That God himself has undertaken to bring all this about: “The Lord of hosts, who has all power in his hand and all creatures at his beck, shall perform this, shall preserve the throne of David till this prince of peace is settled in it; his zeal shall do it, his jealousy for his own honour, and the truth of his promise, and the good of his church.” Note, The heart of God is much upon the advancement of the kingdom of Christ among men, which is very comfortable to all those that wish well to it; the zeal of the Lord of hosts will overcome all opposition.<br>  <br>  May God bless you as you study His Word<br>  <br>  <:)))><|`|DE8EB2Kzaa	the government as in, christ is ruler and king. he governs everything.|`|LM4Qjl5Jaa	I'm not quite sure what your question is. could you be a little more specific?|`|Lc5FtItDaa	We are going to have a baby, a son.

That they're Muslim and they shouldn't bother you, or that they should be cute before they bother you? I think you're a bit confused. But bottom line, you don't like them bothering you. I guess if you were a little older and mature, you wouldn't find it hard to figure out that all you need to do is tell them to leave you alone because you're not interested. If not, tell your friends to tell them. It's not like anyone's gonna force you into a date with them...|`|42SDcehQaa	Stay away from them and watch out for them.

rIvp1BToaa	I  have  not come  across that  so do  not believe it is  in the bible at all.|`|PgWkqjeZaa	Quite to the contrary, Romans states the following:<br>  <br>  Romans 1:<br>  <br>   21For although they knew God, they neither glorified him as God nor gave thanks to him, but their thinking became futile and their foolish hearts were darkened. 22Although they claimed to be wise, they became fools 23and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images made to look like mortal man and birds and animals and reptiles. <br>  <br>   24Therefore God gave them over in the sinful desires of their hearts to sexual impurity for the degrading of their bodies with one another. 25They exchanged the truth of God for a lie, and worshiped and served created things rather than the Creator—who is forever praised. Amen. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Pre-marital sex is not a commitment, nor does the bible make it out as such (OT being a sliglthy different case with the Levitical laws; Not in scope for this dicussion though). <br>  <br>  <br>  Christians do not have the right to judge others, especially those that have been raped. Romans 2 in fact states this:<br>  <br>  1You, therefore, have no excuse, you who pass judgment on someone else, for at whatever point you judge the other, you are condemning yourself, because you who pass judgment do the same things. 2Now we know that God's judgment against those who do such things is based on truth. 3So when you, a mere man, pass judgment on them and yet do the same things, do you think you will escape God's judgment? 4Or do you show contempt for the riches of his kindness, tolerance and patience, not realizing that God's kindness leads you toward repentance?<br>  <br>  <br>  This makes a very clear case for not judging others and pre-marital sex. For more info, I would highly recommend all of Romans, with emphasis on Romans 1-2 for this topic.<br>  <br>  Grace and peace to you!<br>  - Isaac|`|15c26a1121cb38645e9f7a1fafb02e43aa	The bible doesn't say to kill all the gay people. That's just ignorance and spreading rumors.<br>  <br>  The truth is sex is a VERY intimate thing. You are giving your body to someone. After you have sex or a sexual encounter so to speak, you have a connection with someone. Whether you want to believe it or not it's intimate. What happens when that person leaves you? from personal experience I know that a part of you will always be with that person. Whenyou do eventually get married it can create some difficulties with your husband or wife.<br>  I just have one thing to say. Having sex is not a right, You have a right to your virginity!|`|e1Ecc6pxaa	The Bible does not say that. Christians do not put guilt and blame on rape victims unless the woman is wearing sexual clothes to tempt the man into sinning. <br>  <br>  The Catholic Church, as well as Jesus Christ Himself in the Bible tells us that if you tempt others into sinning, you are committing a sin yourself.<br>  <br>  So don't tempt others to sin because it's a sin.

You need to apologize.|`|RZaPnqzWaa	In the book of Ludicrous, chapter 2, verse 25.|`|k9tQqJpUaa	That statement all depends on what you define as marriage in the Bible.<br>  <br>  1. Some people think vows have to be said.<br>  2. Some think that when it said in Genesis "and they became one flesh" that this means they share part of their soul. No vows were written in this tale of Isaac and his wife. <br>  <br>  I am for the latter because that is what I have read. Never once have I used this to guilt other people. So, don't be generalizing us all. The Bible also says that rape victims don't have to marry the one who raped them, just that he pay the father the price of becoming her husband. So nope, that doesn't work either.<br>  <br>  I'm beginning to think you made this up to try and tick a few people off.|`|CugCzH9iaa	The Bible DOES NOT say that you are giving them your heart and soul and body when talking about sex. It does say that your body is a temple and therefore we should not abuse our bodies in that way. Giving your heart away is something that is taught as an idea and example of what it does to you mentally if you give yourself to a man outside of marriage.<br>  <br>    Rape victims do not give themselves to the rapist. Rape victims will go through all kinds of hurt because of what happened to them and what a man took that they had no control over. I have been surrounded by Christians my whole life and neither I nor any of them (that I have heard) have ever said that about a victim. I can not imagine a true Christian ever seeing that as the victims fault and belittling them in that way.|`|QF4W5aYRaa	Haven't seen that verse myself.

If an unidentified biracial person's body were found, DNA testing would prove them to be just as much white as black. The one-drop rule is based in racism (white purity), not fact.

Its not who he is.  And yes, it would be wrong for me to try to make him change when its not him.  On the other hand..  he likes to horse around and tickle.  Its also a part of his personality and who he is.  Horsing around I like, tickling I hate.  It took a long time to get him to change and not tickle me, but I think I have a right to say if I am tickled or not.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, you shouldnt have to put up with your spouse sleeping around behind your back because thats who they are, nor should the person be forced to accept an open relationship because its who their spouse is.

Some of the questions that they asked for the afterlife are ones that we should all ask in our lives now. As for adding in parts of the movie, that's cool. I mean, his style is his style and he can add in what he wants. I wasn't even really thinking that much about the Egyptian culture being added into the movie, and still looking back don't think that much about it. Sure, I noticed the eagle in the poster and thoughtt to myself the same, but that is the case with a lot of movies. <br>  <br>  To me, a movie is a movie. What the writers want to add in as extras is just that... extras. I liked the movie because of the movie, and knowing that he added in religious symbols (Be Jesus or not) doesn't make the movie any better or worse for me. Lol, the same with Lord of the Rings and Narnia. It's fun to catch those things, but doesn't make it any better my friend, or worse for that matter :)<br>  <br>  I hope that I answered your question.|`|HqwHbeM5aa	answer is E.

I'll be going to public school for the first time next year, so I have no idea what public school is like, really. From some people I've heard that it's worse than it sounds, and yet from others I've heard that it's not as bad. I guess it just depends on which school you go to.<br>  <br>  I will give you some advice. OWN YOUR FAITH. You say you're a strong Christian, which is great, but now you have to exercise that faith by not letting anything or anyone in public school shake it. You can steer yourself away from any sex/drugs/alchohol by mixing yourself in with a good crowd.

That's nothing new.  I'm sure your parents and grandparents had to deal with those things also.<br>  <br>  Keep in mind, too, that just because some other kids get sexual with their girlfriends or boyfriends, does not make them a bad person.  Maybe you think they are making bad choices, but they are human beings like you, with similar desires and thoughts.<br>  <br>  Just be yourself, be low key, be friendly but not gushing, and try to look at the best side of other human beings.<br>  <br>  Oh, please realize that lots of Christians think God used a natural process of biological evolution to develop life, *just* as God used your parents to create you using a natural process.  Dr. Francis Collins, who headed the Human Genome Project, is a committed Christian and also accepts evolution as being correct.

After being brought up on private school standards, the publicc system will not be a challenge. Just learn what they teach you and regurgitate it on the tests and they will be happy. They do not bother teaching thinking skills so much. The vices that you found in your old school will be the same, only more overt.

These kind of things are all around you, regardless of the school you go to.  Yeah, they're not great,  but the choice is your as to whether you get involved with them, or just stay right away from those things and the type of people that do them.  When you get out in the real world and get a job these kind of things don't just go away - people still use drugs, drink and have sex.  When I was in school it was the Private school kids that we brought our drugs from and the private school kids having more teenage pregnancies.  Why?  Because they are simply told not to do it (drugs/sex) instead of being given better information and education about these things, what damage they can do and how to protect yourself if you are going to do them anyway.<br>  <br>  As for evolution - it should be taught and it's nothing to be afraid of.  It's just science after all.  Even if they don't believe it, christian schools are doing a dis-service to their students by not teaching science properly by including evolution.  You don't have to believe it but science deals with facts and that is what they teach.  Not biblical stories passed off as facts, but actual scientific facts.  Learning evolution is just a part of an honest, well rounded education.<br>  <br>  Don't be afriad of public school - your education is what you make it, not the school and their religious (or lack of) beliefs.|`|gb9REJN4aa	Depending on your public school, it isn't necessarily at all bad. If it's a bad school, then yes, you'll see drugs, sex, and alcohol. But in other public schools, these things don't happen. (That doesn't mean that the kids aren't drinking, etc., but that they aren't doing it at school and you won't see it.) It will depend a lot on what your school is like. Nobody is going to force you to do drugs or have sex though, even at the roughest school around. So don't worry about it too much.<br>  <br>  Evolution is just a small part of a normal biology or life science class. You won't see much of that, either, though you will see it briefly in those classes. It is taught and you will be expected to learn it. I believe in evolution, but any decent public school will teach it as a theory, and if you are worried about it, just remember to learn it in that light. You don't have to believe it--you have to understand it. In the same way, we teach Newtonian mechanics in physics class, which a student has to understand--but we know now that Newtonian mechanics is not true (rather, some combination of relativity theory and quantum mechanics appears to be closer to the truth). Nobody has any trouble learning Newtonian physics, though. Maybe it will help you to think of evolution the same way: when you do encounter it, which I think will probably be rarely, think of it as an academic exercise in something you have to understand, rather than necessarily something you have to believe.<br>  <br>  Good luck! You'll be okay whatever school you go to. I do hope your local public school is a good one, though, and you never have to deal with drugs or sex while you're there. All the best!|`|pSfW0ROmaa	I have Christian children your age in the public school. Don't be afraid- He that is in you  is greater than he who is in the world. Maybe God is bringing you here for a reason. You won't get caught up in any sex, drugs, and alcohol if you stay away from places where this is happening- you won't see it happening in the halls or anything:) You may hear a lot of offensive language, etc. Mosts teachers teach that evolution is only a theory that has not been proven. In fact, more and more scientists believe otherwise and are finding more evidence to back up the Bible. You may want toseeifthere are other kids in your youth group who go to this school or see if there are Christian based orginizations you can be a part of so you don't feel alone.|`|li22L9gZaa	It really depends on what public school you go to (as far as the drugs, sex, and alcohol goes).  If you live in NYC, be afraid of public school.  If you live in a suburb, do not be afraid of public school.  As far as evolution goes...dude, are you so insecure in your faith that you have to hide from scientific fact?  At least learn what it is and understand it before you deem it the work of the devil and a sin to even learn about!  There are plenty of strong Christians who went to public schools, and plenty who also accept evolution as the scientific fact that it is.|`|2hX0tLzIaa	Drug use is higher in private schools ( irregardless of wheather they are christain or not)  partly because they can afford to buy more drugs<br>  <br>  You are very naive to think that kids in private school dont do drugs sex and alcohol<br>  <br>  EDIT<br>  <br>  I think private school do a bit more screening to keeping the real idiots and troublemakers out.|`|3ccd31e0b38f18f3123974ce88fcb948aa	I TEACH in a public school and am here to tell you that there are sex, drugs, and alcohol in private schools as well...Christian schools are often the worst.<br>  Some of the kids in Christian schools are the meanest people I have ever seen.

You can be all good and abstinent but one day you will look back and ask yourself "what the **** was the point."|`|k52tKYVPaa	first, please learn to spell once you get there. <br>  unless you're going to an underfunded school in a poor neighborhood you have absolutely nothing to worry about. and on the evolution issue... i'm convinced evolution is truth, but you ought to just look at it this way, the more you know about it the better equipped you'll be to debate the issue. i see most christians i meet know almost nothing about it then try to debate with limited knowledge. it only makes people mock them more. help your side out some, be informed.|`|7PSfYTQnaa	evelution? looks like christian school isn't doing its job...get into a public school as soon as possible. There is a lot of diversity in public school yes, and no people arent as devout as you are...by a long shot. But thats life. You're going to meet people that arent the same as you, but you have to learn to deal with that. Might as well do it now before you get to college and get hit even moreso by this culture shock...|`|lXDAhSL4aa	Remember that Moses (age 0-40)  went to the Public school of the Egyptians and kept the faith.<br>  <br>  Remember that Daniel (age around 14) went to the public school of the Babylonians and kept the faith.<br>  <br>  You can to.|`|e1Ecc6pxaa	Drug use and alcohol are unavoidable in public schools but if you are a Christian you should already know to have nothing to do with those types of things.

Best of luck thought.|`|50978a3bc71d5b16825edcecdbb32f6caa	They aren't any different from private schools in regard to drugs, sex, and what not.  Private schools just talk about it less.|`|vccz6IYHaa	YES!!!!<br>  but get over it.<br>  you dont have to be a part of it.|`|CugCzH9iaa	I was home-schooled for 10 years in private school for 2 and in public school for 1 year, my senior year.  Public school is NOT as scary and horrible as some make it seem. There was some drinking and some drugs even at my private high school. There are more bad people that you will come into contact with at public school but there are more good kids than bad and plenty of Christians.  There are Christian clubs in most schools that you can join (after school) to meet Christians in your school.  Try not to worry about this so much. If you end up there, just choose your friends wisely and the bad kids are gonna stay away from you.  They don't care to hang out with good kids anyway. God has a plan for you and if you end up at public school it is for a reason. Once you graduate you will meet all kinds of people like that anyway.  You can not hide in a private school forever.  <br>  <br>  Oh and about evolution...all you can do is try not to get upset about that.  They DO teach it alot in science classes but you know the truth.  It does not hurt to know what they believe, then you know how to talk to them, witness, and debate your beliefs better.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you!|`|PgWkqjeZaa	From Romans 8:<br>  <br>  28And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose. <br>  <br>  Paul goes on to say in verse 31, <br>  <br>  1What, then, shall we say in response to this? If God is for us, who can be against us? 32He who did not spare his own Son, but gave him up for us all—how will he not also, along with him, graciously give us all things? <br>  <br>  No doubt this is a trying time in your life, but God has promised that he will never forsake nor abandon us. <br>  <br>  37No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us. 38For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers, 39neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.<br>  <br>  If the creator of the universe has this much love for you, then while your trials will be difficult, they are already won through the gift of God in Christ Jesus.<br>  <br>  Do you have a church youth group or friends you can talk to? I would recommend talking to your youth group leader and maybe he/she will have some ideas as well.<br>  <br>  Above all, pray in Jesus name about these things and you will receive wisdom.<br>  <br>  Grace and peace to you!<br>   - Isaac|`|xi19aSjvaa	Yes, it is true that there are those things in schools, maybe not as bad as what you're describing, but being a strong Christian myself, they are certainly noticable. But just remember that you don't have to join the crowd. Remember that God forbids these things and does not want you to turn away from Him. For every school there is, there will always be Christians available. Try finding some Christian friends and hang out with them. Also, if the school you are going to has any Christian organizations such as Bible stude or FCA, I would highly recommend you joining them. While you won't be able to complete avoid being around people who do these things, you don't have to live like them. It doesn't mean you can't make friends with any of those people too, as long as you don't do the things that they do. Maybe you being around some of them will encourage them to change their lives as well. Who knows? Remember to pray that God will lead you toward the right direction and follow His will and you can't go wrong if you do that. Good luck and God bless.

OMGosh!|`|AA10847209	I hope you're joking.If not, go on the Jerry Springer Show if you're old enough to.

Second...I've never heard of friends with benefits not leading to someone getting hurt.|`|NopJGHPLaa	Maybe you just like  talk too much drivel and his only defense against it was to get drunk and call you a slut|`|7ED5xvGxaa	like like like oh my god. Honestly this isnt a great place for asking advice.|`|3ioUdPuZaa	I think by your way of phrasing your question that you are young. I also made note of drinking or being "drunk" mentioned, as well as "benefits" which I TAKE to mean sexual benefits.<br>  Girl, ARE YOU LISTENING TO YOURSELF? <br>  No one can correctly answer your question and be "for sure" of anything because if drugs or alcohol are involved you are dealing with emotions and thoughts that CHANGE WITH THE BREEZE !!!<br>  And if you are willing and advertizing that you WILL HAPPILY give out "benefits" without ANY TYPE of said or IMPLIED committment, THERE AREN'T MANY MEN WHO ARE GOING TO TURN YOU DOWN. <br>  Words are just that....WORDS. Its the ACTIONS that count!!!!!!!!!!<br>  I think you are asking this question because you DO care or LOVE him and DO want him to love and care for you.<br>  If this is true, then you have things backwards. Relationships are suppose to be a "symbol" of God's relationship to the church (mother) and His children (believers). That is the ONLY reason the relationship of man to woman and having babies EVER came about!<br>  There is a NATURAL order to things....natural laws. Something that starts out ALL wrong will end up that way too, USUALLY, not always. <br>  SEX was a gift given by God in order to enhance the relationship between two ADULTS who INTEND TO LIVE THEIR LIVES TOGETHER AND TO LIVE ONLY FOR EACH OTHER, AND WHO WANT TO HAVE CHILDREN TOGETHER, AS A SAMPLE OF THEIR LOVE. <br>  Anything else, is just games. Do you want your life based on a game or do you want to really REACH for TRUE and lasting LOVE, Joy and happiness for the REST OF YOUR LIFE!<br>  If the latter is what you want, read your Bible and don't give out the benefits without being "paid!"<br>  Turn things back around and be honest without "putting out!" If he cares, he'll be back around someday soon. If he doesn't, he won't. It may be hurtful to lose him if that happens, but it would likely happen someday anyway...YOU CANNOT LOSE WHAT YOU NEVER REALLY HAD. <br>  And if this is just a game to you, then you are HURTING yourself and your future "building bad baggage" that will hang on your shoulders for years to come and that will not allow you to build a good life...UNTIL YOU DECIDE TO TAKE THE BAGGAGE OFF AND CHANGE YOUR LIFE...do this and your life can be one filled with joy and happiness past your wildest dreams.<br>  Good luck!<br>  Bunny7|`|CyslkJdEaa	He sounds like he might have been drinking, which has the tendency to bring out 'what you really want to say, and how you really feel', so maybe you should just ignore what he said.  Also, maybe he's already put what happened behind him and moved on, and if 'you' decide you 'still' want to be friends with him (without the 'benefits') then perhaps you ought to try and do the same as well.<br>  Then again, usually once people have 'crossed that line', they either move on from there, or can sometimes remain somewhat distant friends.
xssqrr7Yaa	I would call it getting rubbed the wrong way.|`|yXx1nB0Qaa	I would say somebody is dipping their quill in the company ink..|`|VYWaL2graa	People are too sensetive. Get over it. Yes it's appropriate.|`|OiJGi6ltaa	How much money are we talking about, here?<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  ...just kidding.<br>  <br>  I've been seriously irritated any time I've seen some guy try to give my wife a backrub.  I was reasonable about it; told him, "keep your hands off my wife or I'll cave your head in with a tire iron."  And the only reason I demand loyalty is because I'm extremely loyal, so no backrubs for me or from me, either.  If the company or individual hires a professional masseuse, that's entirely different, but being touched and kneaded and caressed is a rather physical thing that really should only be the purview of one's spouse.<br>  <br>  If the co-worker is completely friendly, isn't looking to score points toward anything else, and genuinely interested in relaxing you out of consideration, then maybe, but.....yeah right.|`|iwVB6E4Paa	if you're sexy it is :P

If you really want to feel better about women and yourself; and be happier and feel better about life my suggestion is to not give up on trying to find a woman for you.  It took me forever to find a wonderful woman and companion.  After many yrs of much happiness I lost her and had to start over.

About the guy beating his girl about the keys, you should have stopped it, then told the girl "that's what you get for dating a jerk". Just be nice and if the woman has a problem with that she's worthless. Just work hard, earn money and you'll be too good for them and you'll be over it. Women/girls are just not worth it these days and hatred towards them is normal after all.

Good Buddhists or Hindus are saved by responding to the "Christlike element" in Buddhism or Hinduism. This is certainly what CS Lewis wrote and believed. Why then evangelize? Because walking in the light is better than stumbling in the dark.<br>  The minority Christian view is that, since all have sinned, the fact the God saves anyone at all is reflective of his immense mercy and love. I lean toward the first view. Christianity is never as simple as its critics think it is.|`|1g49KgoGaa	Of course its not fair.  That's what tipped me off early on in my religious stage.

God knows what's in your heart. The literal torturous, fiery pit called hell is a fallacy that was developed through the incorrect translation. The lake of fire was a literal place on earth in which people cast their children as sacrifices to false gods. Hell is a state of mind and the emotional turmoil one faces once they obtain the knowledge given to us once we pass on and know the full affects of everything we have done in our lives. Those who are truly evil experience this for eternity. However, no one goes to a literal eternally-burning lake of fire forever after they die. A loving, caring, gracious, merciful, fatherly God would not create such a place. Could you honestly do that to your children? Of course not, and anyone who could does not deserve them. So why then do people insist on believing in and following a god who could do that? It's simply not true, and it's nothing but a tactic used to scare people into believing what they want you to believe. It started as a misinterpretation from incorrect translations. Then it went from there, and, sadly, far too many people believe this and dwell on it and judge others accordingly. Believe me, God knows all truth and what is in the hearts of everyone. All will be judged accordingly and fairly.<br>  As far as choosing the right or wrong religion, that is another touchy subject. But all religions have truth in them. The differences lie in translations, interpretations, etc. A loving God would not say, "You didn't choose the right church, so you're not going to Heaven." Get real.<br>  Everybody is different, but everyone has good in them somewhere. If they didn't, they wouldn't be here. The difference is that some embrace it, while others don't. It's what's in your heart that counts most. Believe me, there are some incredibly good-hearted, well-meaning, loving, caring, and wonderful Atheists, just as there are some truly cruel and judgmental alleged Christians.<br>  The only way to know truth is to be open-minded, loving, accepting, and welcoming of all knowledge. Search, and you will find. It's sad to think how distorted the Word of God has become.<br>  Also, as far as people who don't have the opportunity to learn what Christianity is about or those who are taught otherwise their entire lives...they will find out the truth and will receive another chance.  No one should be punished for something that is not their fault, and an all-knowing, loving God would not do that to His children.|`|m0lxBmPqaa	well.. not really.. if a person who doesn't have heard of the gospel is not going to hell.. he will be judged by his actions.. even the Bible shows different point of view.. but in another context.. Jesus christ came for all the people.. so if he died for all the sins of the humanity.. they should be good.. as a catholic and our source is not just the Bible as well the tradition.. the non-believers will go to heaven by their actions.. but christians will go to there by faith and actions..because they have more responsibility in the gospel|`|7LWDRI2Uaa	God doesn't see what man sees God sees the heart sees the truth in everyone whoever you are whatever you believe at any point in your life, God doesn't demand success in every way only that we try and that we love, If you know love you know God. No one has any grounds to say who will or who will not go to heaven or to hell only God, some of my best friends are atheist a couple are muslim I would not say any of them are going to hell anymore than I could be.|`|wNJetCLEaa	This is not true<br>  My father is a pastor and I asked him the same thing.  His response was that god makes provisions for those who have never heard of christ through the state of there soul.  The bible says that humans instinctively know that god exists and that they will follow what there heart tells them to do.  Even if they have no direct knowledge of christ, he will still reside in their hearts, they just don't know what to call him.|`|O5h1pgdbaa	If ignorance were a ticket to heaven the greatest evangelic enterprise would be a concerted cover up campaign. Such a cover up would consist of ending evangelism, burning bibles, and closing churches. Eventually no one would have heard of Jesus and all would be on their way to heaven.<br>  <br>  Everyone has the light of both creation and conscience. God is not capricious. If we respond to the light we have He will give us more light.|`|zLfIp3NMaa	You question is for God.  All others are poor reflection of Him.  The only problem is that the first time we stand before Him ... we do not get to question Him ... it will be just for judgement ... He is God ... if you have a real concern for those who have not heard about Jesus then give to a preacher who is going there ... or send a bible to them yourself ... or go yourself ... God wants your heart to work for His kingdom ... God will get someone to anyone who will accept the message of the cross.|`|jNQ0BhODaa	no because according to christians you have to believe in their god to go to heaven apparently even a murderer will still go to heaven  because they are christian which is really stupid<br>  <br>  I do not believe in god|`|AA11824333	No, because we are all born sinners.

The details of delusions aren't important though.|`|3mDvjCa8aa	I don't think the inventors of Christianity were really expecting the whole world to link up the way it has...it shows.|`|4LrOVUgnaa	who said religion or the world was fair?|`|O4wYyo7laa	You have the conscience of a missionary. Yours is the reason men of Christ travel to the far corners of the world and invade the dangerous worlds of the unbelievers to carry the Bible and the word of Christ to those who have never heard of these things. Missionaries take Christ to unbelievers because they know these people will die without hearing the word and might go to hell (depending on which brand of  Christianity you believe in) Some  believe God gives those who can not hear or understand the word a way out because of their circumstances, such as small children, the mentally ill or those who are being misled by false religions. Those who will surely go to Hell are those who hear the word and understand it but choose to laugh at it or ignore it. God will not be mocked and yet  no one is forced to believe.|`|sTITFgMgaa	That's what the thousand year mi-lineal reign of Christ is about!<br>  Those who have heard His word and deny Him, He will do like wise and deny them. But entrance to the Kingdom of the universe where He has gone before us to prepare a place for us requires discipline of the word of GOD, Governmental Ordered Dominion. Those  who have not received a chance to make a conscious choice will receive that chance. The Lord is fair and always has been. No truly Innocent  souls will be sent to the lake of fire unless they refuse to conform to the rules. The game is on you could say, choose the team your going to play for, but if you have paid attention to the score you already know who the winning team is, it's not the cheaters they have already been disqualified! Don't worry about others because everyone gets to play eventually.|`|yu73aU9Uaa	this is a hard question to answer.<br>  <br>  it seems incredibly unfair for that to happen. i am a strong believer in Christ myself, though no one else in my family are. when i asked what would happen to them when they died the answer shocked me. i automatically thought they would go to heaven because i was. i was told they would go to hell as they were not believers and that in the afterlife i would not want to see them as they would be in immense pain and suffering. this shocked and upset me knowing that when they die, the will be in hell. if i child is brought up in a muslin family, when they are adult, no doubt they would hear about christianity. they would be able to make the decision themselves. however, if they were to die a young child, i would think that they would be taken to the gates of heaven and be asked what their belief was to be.<br>  this is what i think and hope would happen.<br>  <br>  hope it helped :)<br>  <br>  x

Since I have no such belief, then the answer is none of the above, as in, NO 2nd coming since I do not believe there was even a 1st... My problem is every religion claims to have the one true god and all others worship false idols. So, if true, WHICH of the MANY making the same claim is the ONE true faith? Just point me to the RIGHT one, because isn't worshiping a false idol just as bad as not to believe at all? The problem with all religions I have looked into is all of you want me to simply take your WORD alone with NO proof. And please, do NOT point at scripture as PROOF. All scripture is hearsay and could never be used in court as any kind of proof of anything. Say I say to you I am going to toss a gold coin a Krugerrand perhaps, and if heads I will give it to you. Then, without even showing I tossed the coin, I simply announce you lost. Would YOU simply accept my word alone? Wouldn't you want to at least see the toss and the result? Until you can "show me the coin" to back up your word, I have NO reason to believe YOU that you know the word of god... Therefore, no 2nd coming... And yes, I AM being serious... And if one day, when I die and possibly discover I am wrong, I will be the FIRST to admit to the error of my ways...|`|ij5Sv6staa	How can anyone be serious about this answer....do you think that anyone here is going to know the answer?  Do you think that somebody here has an "in" with God, and he whispers the world's secrets in their ear?|`|7f0ZVPt8aa	I thought it said in the Bible it was supposed to happen when the apostles were still alive.

I believe that the second coming and the rapture occur almost at the same time.  The second coming and the rapture is when Judgment day happens. And no one knows so be ready for Him at any time.<br>  <br>  RCD<br>  Now concerning the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our being gathered together to him, we ask you, brothers, not to be quickly shaken in mind or alarmed, either by a spirit or a spoken word, or a letter seeming to be from us, to the effect that the day of the Lord has come. Let no one deceive you in any way. For that day will not come, unless the rebellion comes first, and the man of lawlessness is revealed, the son of destruction, who opposes and exalts himself against every so-called god or object of worship, so that he takes his seat in the temple of God, proclaiming himself to be God. Do you not remember that when I was still with you I told you these things? And you know what is restraining him now so that he may be revealed in his time. For the mystery of lawlessness is already at work. Only he who now restrains it will do so until he is out of the way. And then the lawless one will be revealed, whom the Lord Jesus will kill with the breath of his mouth and bring to nothing by the appearance of his coming. The coming of the lawless one is by the activity of Satan with all power and false signs and wonders, and with all wicked deception for those who are perishing, because they refused to love the truth and so be saved. Therefore God sends them a strong delusion, so that they may believe what is false, in order that all may be condemned who did not believe the truth but had pleasure in unrighteousness. But we ought always to give thanks to God for you, brothers beloved by the Lord, because God chose you as the firstfruits to be saved, through sanctification by the Spirit and belief in the truth. To this he called you through our gospel, so that you may obtain the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ. <br>  (2Th 2:1-14 ESV)But we do not want you to be uninformed, brothers, about those who are asleep, that you may not grieve as others do who have no hope. For since we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so, through Jesus, God will bring with him those who have fallen asleep. For this we declare to you by a word from the Lord, that we who are alive, who are left until the coming of the Lord, will not precede those who have fallen asleep. For the Lord himself will descend from heaven with a cry of command, with the voice of an archangel, and with the sound of the trumpet of God. And the dead in Christ will rise first. Then we who are alive, who are left, will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air, and so we will always be with the Lord. Therefore encourage one another with these words. <br>  (1Th 4:13-18 ESV)|`|I8YZEyR4aa	no one will know.<br>  but i think soon the way things are going.|`|2V87n4PKaa	never, cuz he doesnt exist

Je is obvious "I." Now, every time you negative something, you have to add "ne" before the verb and then "pas" after it. <br>  <br>  So someone just wrote bad French. "It get" is obviously English, and they just tried to negate it. <br>  <br>  If you want to say "I don't get it" in French, you should probably say "Je ne comprends pas"|`|nK4j9s7paa	that is not french|`|qHwI9ev8aa	Definitely not French.

You have to give to God to get something in return. Whatever you give to God, he will return back to you double. Not any being cares more than God himself and your lack of caring about God is due to your lack of not knowing God.  How can we know God if we don't pray and read his WORD (Bible). If you truly knew God, you would have eternal happiness.  Faith is the belief of the things yet unseen. You have to believe as in Book of Mark chapters 11 and 12. and you have to pray and as for forgiveness and you have to read the bible as God commanded us to. Miracles do come true.

8OREBeRdaa	I'd want to know upfront for the following reasons:<br>  - in case she ever has to cancel a date or something then I know it's likely for her kid as opposed to "washing her hair"<br>  - good mom's are people that tend to be people of good quality. <br>  - if I show up to the mom's place to pick her up and another guy is there, I can put 2 & 2 together that it's likely the kid's dad.

I'll be honest, I think most guys get anxious when the get put into a position where they could be 'insta-dad'.  I know that I'd be really careful as to not give the kid any ill impressions because you not only have the Mom to impress but the kid too!

Faith, if you try to force it, becomes impossible; you must give your children time and space to find and feel the NEED for faith. Everything else, as the Preacher saith, is VANITY, the need to manipulate children in order to justify your own weak faith. Sometimes ol' Ecclesiastes do come in handy. . . .|`|U7sBZKUuaa	It is the parents' duty to pass on their wisdom and experience to their kids, and it is the child's place to learn all they can.

This is accomplished from start to finish by faith. As the Scriptures say, “It is through faith that a righteous person has life.”<br>  But God shows his anger from heaven against all sinful, wicked people who suppress the truth by their wickedness. They know the truth about God because he has made it obvious to them. For ever since the world was created, people have seen the earth and sky. Through everything God made, they can clearly see his invisible qualities—his eternal power and divine nature. So they have no excuse for not knowing God.<br>  Yes, they know God, but they won’t worship him as God or even give him thanks. And they begin to think up foolish ideas of what God is like. As a result, their minds have become dark and confused. Claiming to be wise, they instead have become utter fools. And instead of worshiping the glorious, ever-living God, they worship idols made to look like mere people and birds and animals and reptiles.<br>  So God has abandoned them to do whatever shameful things their hearts desire. As a result, they do vile and degrading things with each other’s bodies. They trade the truth about God for a lie. So they worship and serve the things God created instead of the Creator himself, who is worthy of eternal praise! That is why God abandons them to their shameful desires. Even the women turn against the natural way to have sex and instead indulg in sex with each other. And the men, instead of having normal sexual relations with women, burn with lust for each other. Men do shameful things with other men, and as a result of this sin, they suffer within themselves the penalty they deserved.<br>  <br>  Since they think it foolish to acknowledge God, he abandons them to their foolish thinking and lets them do things that should never be done. Their lives become full of every kind of wickedness, sin, greed, hate, envy, murder, quarreling, deception, malicious behavior, and gossip. They are backstabbers, haters of God, insolent, proud, and boastful. They invent new ways of sinning, and they disobey their parents. They refuse to understand, break their promises, are heartless, and have no mercy. They know God’s justice requires that those who do these things deserve to die, yet they do them anyway. Worse yet, they encourage others to do them, too.|`|o3EXn3rMaa	if the child is young,then regardless of what the child feels,he has to do what the parents think is best.i do believe that everyone is entitled to their own beliefs, but there is nothing wrong with parents encouraging their children to believe in something that they agree with.i dont think that parents should force their children to believe in their beliefs if they are old enough to make their own decisions. parents just want the best for their kids.|`|8321dcc91dbc3f1a3f5120ba6e386798aa	should parents force children to go to school? should parents force their children to go to bed? should parents force their children to come in at dark? should parents force their children to get immunized? should parents force their children to go to the dentist? well, ETERNAL issues are of more consequence than TEMPORAL issues......|`|li22L9gZaa	Oh no, just as I shouldn't force my kid to go secular humanist meetings (if I ever have kids).

So many of these questions are you know? We could all sit down and talk forever and not really find an "Answer" but I guess that isn't really what this site truly exists for. <br>  <br>  I understand that you do not believe in God but I hope you can forgive me for the sake of my argument in the terms I am going to put things because it may help us better understand your friends parents. I really agree with you about the type of Christian comment you made as well. It breaks my heart when people represent Jesus without truly placing Him in their hearts and living their life for Him and with Him, loving each individual child of His as He would. I also need to say now that I am sorry because I have mis-represented Him before as well, we will never be able to live up to Him and because we are what we are as humans we cannot always forgive each other for this. <br>  <br>   Our Heavenly father created us with one very important choice. To accept relationship with Him and receive him as our savior or to deny Him, His existence or any form of relationship with Him. I think you are very right that a parent should not force their child to go to church  because God does not force us to come to him. Accepting or denying God is a personal decision and something no one can force on another and perhaps your friends parents because of their immense love for their son don't see this. <br>  <br>  I am a son as well and because I have not become one yet I cannot say what it would be like to be a father or a mother. Of course I will never become a mother but that is beside the point haha. I think that any parent who believes in something strongly, spiritually related or not hopes to pass that on to their children because of the guidance it has given them in their life. I believe that God has blessed me immensely in life and I pray that when I do have children together with Him my wife and I will be "good" parents; but to go into parenting believing that we will never make mistakes would be setting ourselves up for failure because we are human, we are not perfect, nor are we expected to be.  <br>  <br>  I am very sorry that your parents did try to force you to do something that you didn't want to do. I am curious as of this: why was such a cruel thing for them to do? I certainly don't want to be a cruel father if I am ever blessed enough to become one. And again I am sorry if the way I worded my response made it less approachable.|`|9YMLsk7Taa	When my children were all still living under my roof they all went to church. I never "forced" them to go. Sometimes they were not really overjoyed at going and complained and grumbled but today they all have a firm foundation of faith to draw on when life is hard. Also now that they are adults they thank me for insisting on it. The Bible says "train a child up in the way he should go and when he is old he will not depart from it".|`|g4AAZRuxaa	No.|`|SfS4d0gkaa	My parents used to drop my twin brother & I off at church alone every Sunday so my parents could spend time together at home.  We were only 6 years old.  We didn't know what to do but sit and wait in a church full of adult strangers.  It was awkward and uncomfortable for us.  At the time, we had no idea why we were being left there.  My parents were just using the church as a poor excuse for a babysitter or child drop off.|`|35388c245298f734c446f07410c4ec69aa	No. I support religious freedom, which necessarily means that I oppose the religious indoctrination of children.|`|cIvFOzoiaa	No, freedom of religion applies to anybody with an opinion, and that includes kids.|`|6173ede5e3ea0a8b44522ccd89de7fe0aa	Train a child up in the way that he should go, and when he is old, he will not depart from it."  Proverbs 22:6
2D8aUsq3aa	It was described as..<br>  <br>  You wake up in a cell-like area, you have no strength... you couldn't move even if you spent your entire eternity attempting to do so.<br>  <br>  You hear an endless source of blood curdling screams- they echo throughout every corner of this place. <br>  <br>  You notice at least one demon.. Big, hateful, deformed and wretched creatures... and they HATE you... So thats when the first pain will hit you. They'll start ripping you apart.. pulling strands of your insides right out. You'll want to die, but all of the ripped out parts will soon grow back. And it begins again. <br>             After a long while of this, you'll probably have enough time to realize whats happened, that there is no escape. You are cut off from God forever- no one can save you- this is how you will spend all eternity. It will never get old- and you can never tell your family to avoid this place. <br>  When they bring you near the lake, you'll see countless human bodies. They are more like skeletons, with flesh constantly reforming to intensify the pain. Their screams hurt already- but in a moment- you have joined them. A pain like no other hits you- one that surpasses all of your limits. You begin to sink- your lungs gasp for air. But they only find fire, and this you inhale- for even more pain. <br>  <br>  You will only get exactly what you have earned in Hell.|`|YZ8umCJXaa	When it says in the Bible that something burns forever it means until its all burnt up, but the affects of the fire are forever.<br>  Or unquenchable fire, meaning it can’t be put out until its finished doing its job.<br>  It says that Sodom and Gomorrah burnt forever, but they are not burning today.<br>  Jud 1:7 Even as Sodom and Gomorrah, and the cities about them, having in like manner with these given themselves over to fornication and gone after strange flesh, are set forth as an example, suffering the punishment of eternal fire. <br>  Psa 37:10 For yet a little while, and the wicked shall not be: Yea, thou shalt diligently consider his place, and he shall not be. <br>  Psa 37:20 But the wicked shall perish, And the enemies of Jehovah shall be as the fat of lambs: They shall consume; in smoke shall they consume away. <br>  <br>  We cant go to Hell forever because the following scripture says that there is no more Death and the Grave/Hell will be done away with.<br>  Rev 20:14 And death and Hades were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death, even the lake of fire. <br>  <br>  The Lake of fire will destroy the wicked but the lake of fire is a different thing to Hell/grave as it is translated, they are not the same thing.|`|O4wYyo7laa	When they asked Jesus to describe Heaven he said  could not do it because it is beyond  human understanding. I think it would be the same for Hell. I knew a man who drank and drove his car even after he was arrested for drunk driving several times.One night he killed a woman and three kids and lost his arm in a tragic accident. He sits around all day now in regret that he did not quit driving while he was drunk and that he killed the woman and kids and lost his arm. He wants to die but is afraid because he is sure he will go to Hell yet his life now is a a living hell.There can be no end to this mans torture because nothing can be changed. He still drinks constantly to kill the pain I think Hell is something like what this man live in. Constant regret for bad choices knowing its too late to change. Knowing also everything will remain the same till he dies then he has an eternal Hell waiting for him..|`|6JzgBhRQaa	i cant even imagine its so horrible<br>  I'm glad I'm not going<br>  and I'm gonna do me best to make sure all my friends and everyone I've ever met isn't going either<br>  <br>  i'm sure its gonna stink sooo bad like the worst thing in the universe|`|e1Ecc6pxaa	Hell will be a place of torment...

eb4e977a0cb9ce50b08bf74f0f3a0c61aa	Here is truth - read and understand. <br>  1. Vampires, defined as a humanoid being that MUST consume blood or energy to survive do not exist. Cut and paste time, as it is too much work to type this out over and over and I "recycle" my own answers instead of retyping them so here goes. A brief discussion of the human digestive system and then the probable vampire population given an exponential growth rate should explain why vampires are not possible. <br>  <br>  2. The human body is not designed to process large amounts of blood for nutrition. There is not enough protein, carbohydrates, and fats present in blood to maintain a complex creature such as Homo Sapiens or any theorized offshoot mutations. When a human ingests food it is first broken up into a bolus by chewing, then churned up in the stomach with digestive juices to form a mass called chyme. It then passes through the pylorus into the duodenum, part of the small intestine where it mixes with bile salts and secretions from the pancreas and liver which continue breaking it down on a molecular basis, mostly affecting fats at this point. The broken down nutrients pass through the wall of the intestines and into the bloodstream where they are carried to each cell or stored for later use. Indigestible bulk continues through the intestines, turning a dark brown from the bile. Water is absorbed from this mass in the large intestine depending on the needs of the body - a well-hydrated person will usually have a softer stool than a dehydrated person will. Water also enters the bloodstream, and this is what helps to maintain blood pressure. The pressure tends to balance itself in a healthy person because the bloodstream goes through a formation in the kidney called the Loop of Henle, where the narrowing blood vessel forces excess water and cellular waste such as urea out through the cellular wall into the kidneys, where it is excreted through the ureters into the bladder, and then out of the body via the urethral passageway.<br>  <br>  3. IMPORTANT - A person physically unable to process his own food for nutrition therefore also could not process blood - it's the same process. Ingested blood does not transmit directly to the veins anyway - it would be chemically broken down by the digestive system.<br>  <br>  4. Theoretical ingestion of blood to supply these nutrients would therefore have to occur at least once a day, and would require the ingestion of the entire blood supply which could not happen as the stomach is far too small to hold that much liquid volume. Hold up your clenched fist - under normal conditions your stomach is about that size. Furthermore, such a mass would be difficult to pass thru the intestines as it has no fibrous bulk, would create an intestinal impaction, causing massive vomiting from the large concentration of iron present, and any "real" vampire would have to eventually expel the waste, which would come out as a black, tarry, smelly goo, just as stool does when blood is present from a upper GI bleed. <br>  5. These humans that affect the whole "vampiric lifestyle" are NOT vampires. They are simply humans playing their own little game, in their own little fantasy world, usually pandering to their own little sexual fetish, which may or may not actually be sexual. I too, play my own little game, in the SCA, but mine is a game where the deeds that I do are determined by the strength of my arm and sword - I am a warrior, with just as much skill and ability as any warrior of ancient times. The difference is that I am claiming to be something physically possible: a warrior, and I prove it everytime I strap on my armor and walk onto a SCA battlefield. The so-called "vampires" are claiming to be something physically impossible: a walking corpse, and all they prove is that black Victorian clothing, a pair of false fangs, and a little makeup make for a good Halloween costume - it does not make you a vampire.<br>  <br>  6. Even if a vampire feeds once a week, and his victim also becomes a vampire, that is exponential growth, with four iterations a month. First iteration: One makes one, total two. Second iteration: Two make two, total four. Third iteration: Four make four, total eight. Fourth iteration: Eight make eight, total sixteen. 16 vampires at the end of one month, 256 at the end of the second month, 4096 by the end of the third month, 65,536 by the end of the fourth month, 1,048,476 at the end of the fifth, and 33,572,832 vampires at the end of half a year! By way of comparison, there are currently approximately 33 million people who have HIV/AIDS and the disease is a world-wide epidemic. I see people every day in the hospital with AIDS, but never has there been one documented case of a vampire attack. Do the math - vampires are a mathematical impossibility. As for the idea that vampires existed "a long time ago" consider the estimated global population 5,000 years ago - using the above mathematical rationale, a single vampire converted every human on the globe in less than two years. This falls therefore, under the logic of Occam's Razor - which states that when you have removed every impossible answer, whatever remains, no matter how improbable, must be the truth. Since there is no "vampiric plague" swarming the earth, the logical deduction is that they don't exist.<br>  <br>  7. Point of clarification about "vampire" bats: vampire is simply the name we have given them because they do drink blood, same as a flea, mosquito, leech, or spider. Are these creatures vampires? No. They are living creatures, not legendary monsters. They can subsist on blood because of their smaller size and proportionately larger stomach volume. Drinking blood does not make you a vampire anymore than eating raw meat makes you a werewolf, although it might make you a mosquito.<br>  <br>  8.The humans who profess to be vampires are victims of an all-encompassing self induced delusion. They are as human as you or I, regardless of their claims, and if they ingest HIV tainted blood they can most certainly contract the disease, esp. if they have any cuts, sores, or lesions in and or around their mouth. It is a very dangerous delusion to be laboring under. Note that there is absolutely no scientific or medical proof that these people derive any benefit at all from the ingestion of blood, and even worse are the so-called "psychic" vampires, because their delusion is one that they cannot substantiate with any concrete evidence at all.<br>  <br>  9. There is no "vampire" gene. People are not "born" as vampires. When a woman goes to the hospital for prenatal care there are many tests done on mother and child, even while still in the womb, to check for many things, including genetic anomalies that result in deformities and birth defects. If such a gene existed, in today's world with today's technology it would have been found - we have already completely sequenced the human genome. It would also have to follow Mendel's law of dominant/recessive gene theory. Again, the odds on that many "vampires" all escaping the notice of the medical/scientific community are so low as to be almost nonexistent. The idea that there is a global "vampire community" engaging in controlled breeding to keep the "bloodline pure" is delusional in the extreme.<br>  <br>  10. There is no "vampire virus" - as I have already pointed out, HIV is a virus, and look at how fast it has spread - virtually everyone knows someone with the affliction. According to the "vampire websites" there are "thousands" of vampires running around. If that was so then at least one of them has ended up in a hospital for bloodwork when they became pregnant, had a bloodborne infection, was injured in a car wreck, etc, etc, ad nauseum. The anomaly would have been detected and medical science would have isolated it, studied it, applied for research grants on it, published papers on it, and turned it into the talk of the medical and scientific community, as well as making its "discoverers" celebrities and rich beyond their dreams. A virus cannot alter your DNA in such a radical fashion without killing you.|`|T1n3jt6Zaa	Suck the blood from fruits and vegetables.|`|4PwPsjJpaa	i haven't seen that movie, what do they do, suck the juice out of veggies?|`|5eu5P1hYaa	Dude, first of all you have to BE a vampire, and the 'vegetarian' ones feed of of wild animal blood instead of human blood.|`|eeb898bd256e45f62aa2f9354d7b958baa	Read the Bunnicula series.

mVTGl6HGaa	Penis envy in Freudian psychoanalysis refers to the theorized reaction of a girl during her psychosexual development to the realization that she does not have a penis. Freud considered this realization a defining moment in the development of gender and sexual identity for women. According to Freud, the parallel reaction in boys to the realization that girls do not have a penis is castration anxiety.<br>  <br>  In contemporary culture, the term is sometimes used symbolically or metaphorically to refer to the idea that women wish they had a penis, or to refer to anxieties between men about the size of their genitals.

Sooner or later he'll find out the kind of person his girlfriend is, so tell him when realizes what a fool she played him for, you'll be there for him. You can also offer to have her say it in your face with him present. She'll probably refuse and that will convince him. If nothing convinces him, you're better off removing yourself from his life until he comes to his senses.
tmfhieP7aa	The following is all my belief, obviously no one knows what will happen so nothing is fact. :)<br>  <br>  I personally don't believe in Heaven or Hell, but it is a possibility. I asked a question today that asked if a good person who never committed a huge sin, loved everyone but didn't believe in God/Jesus  would be sent to Hell for eternity, and overwelmingly the answers were yes I'm going to burn and suffer in hell forever even if I'm loving and do great deeds. I don't understand how people can think this way, and it kind of hurts when people say that someone like me actually deserves to burn and suffer forever. So that's why I just can't believe in it. And also cause I'm unsure about my belief in God and Jesus and the Bible. <br>  <br>  According to the people who answered my questions: to get into heaven you have to have faith and be a believer in God and the Bible, ask for forgiveness for all your sins (oh yeah you can ask for forgiveness of murder and still make it into heaven, how cool....), and you still might not make it in cause god makes the final decision. <br>  <br>  Prayer is an interesting thing. At one point when I hit rock bottom I prayed a lot and I would pray for an hour and I would cry and get emotional about it (basically it was intense). But I still didn't really believe in God (I don't know though, I have no set in stone belief), I just was like talking to myself or an invisible friend. I had no one that I could talk to about it and it seemed like the only thing I could do was write in a diary and talk to myself/invisible friend/God. I never got any answers, I just got satisfaction that "someone" knew about my situation. Even if that "person" couldn't help me, my thoughts were still out in the universe. <br>  <br>  Reincarnation. I was actually talking to my friend about this today. I really think it is such an interesting concept and I hope that it's what happens to us. :) Even if you turn into a fly, that only lasts a day then your soul will go into the universe again and you will come out as a cat haha how fun. I really don't know that much about it, but I know that people have had dreams of people who they think they knew from a past life which seems neat.|`|LSJ8BmHVaa	There is no hell.  If heaven exists then everyone goes there, but it probably doesn't exist.|`|67EaIAvbaa	ok..this gonna take a while..<br>  <br>  heaven question...john 14:2-6..who will enter heaven<br>  hell question..revelation 20:11-15...who will go to hell<br>  <br>  there..i just kept it short.|`|d0945a07b59dce3ca7393bc610216aa9aa	The idea of hellfire and damnation is really a Christian invention, not a Jewish belief, but then again, "Christianity" isn't Christian either; it's Greek (hello Hades) and Roman, thanks to Paul and the early church. <br>  <br>  Jesus would not have believed in a place of eternal suffering, nor would he have taught it. As a Jew he would have believed that there is a place of contemplation and self-examination the soul visits - temporarily - after death. As an Essene Jew (which history indicates he was) he would have believed in and taught reincarnation (which he did). <br>  <br>  The only people who "go to hell" are the people who expect to. When they realize that they are creating their own reality, they come around to the understanding that the cleansing process of the soul is achieved by self discovery and awareness of one's shortcomings rather than some divinely sadistic, senseless and spiteful torture. <br>  <br>  There is no hell because there is no psychotic, sadistic deity who sends us there (or as some deceptive Christians put it, who allows us to "send ourselves" there). What there *is* is a connection between each one of us and the Cosmos, and eternity. Resurrection is a gross distortion of the truth, which is and always has been reincarnation.|`|JXMpZiwxaa	"If you persevere until death in true devotion to Mary, your salvation is certain!" -St. Alphonsus Liguori<br>  <br>  Hell exists.  It is a large and extensive place.

Whoever shall faithfully serve me by the recitation of the Rosary shall receive signal graces.<br>  2. I promise my special protection and the greatest graces to all those who shall recite the Rosary.<br>  3. The Rosary shall be a powerful armor against Hell, it will destroy vice, decrease sin, and defeat heresies.<br>  4. It will cause virtue and good works to flourish; it will obtain for souls the abundant mercy of God; it will withdraw the hearts of men from the love of the world and its vanities and will lift them to the desire of eternal things. Oh, that souls would sanctify themselves by this means.<br>  5. The soul which recommends itself to me by the recitation of the Rosary, shall not perish.<br>  6. Whoever shall recite the Rosary devoutly, applying himself to the consideration of its sacred mysteries, shall never be conquered by misfortune. God will not chastise him in His justice, he shall not perish by an unprovided death; if he be just, he shall remain in the grace of God and become worthy of eternal life.<br>  7. Whoever shall have a true devotion for the Rosary shall not die without the Sacraments of the Church.<br>  8. Those who are faithful to recite the Rosary shall have during their life and at their death the light of God and the plenitude of His graces; at the moment of death, they shall participate in the merits of the saints in Paradise.<br>  9. I shall deliver from Purgatory those who have been devoted to the Rosary.<br>  10. The faithful children of the Rosary shall merit a high degree of glory in Heaven.<br>  11. You shall obtain all you ask of me by the recitation of the Rosary.<br>  12. All those who propagate the Holy Rosary shall be aided by me in their necessities.<br>  13. I have obtained from my Divine Son that all the advocates of the Rosary shall have for intercessors the entire Celestial Court during their life and at the hour of death.<br>  14. All who recite the Rosary are my sons, and brothers of my only Son, Jesus Christ.<br>  15. Devotion to my Rosary is a great sign of predestination.<br>  <br>  God bless!<br>  Dave|`|Le2FNF75aa	I don't believe in a heaven or hell.|`|ZxhPwaruaa	I don't believe in Hell. I do believe in Heaven. Everyone goes. I believe in reincarnation i dont think it makes sense for G-d to keep creating more souls. its kind of weird. I think G-d takes prayers into consideration but is really picky about it because if He gave everyone what they prayed for the world would be messed up. It wouldn't function if everyone had what they wanted. and i think a lot of things are caused by humans and not G-d. but most people blame G-d for them or ask Him to do something about it. I don't think He interferes that much. what would be the point of life if he controlled everything?
AA10408625	no, people's lives are directed by choices and consequences. we would like to believe that things are fated or that we set our course before we were born or that something greater thann us is in control, but it is just a way to not be responsible. if you believe that something is destined, then you no longer have to act to change it. you can disconnect from life and be a watcher, not an active participant.|`|OKClYfDQaa	No; relatively, by chance.|`|7mhRDbvsaa	yes...and its down right a big shame|`|4rWPX8CTaa	Nope, they're controlled by peoples brains.|`|RPLsG63caa	no
KBBonf97aa	What you're going through isn't as uncommon as you'd think.  You're actually lucky to have avoided the raging hormones and consequences that often follow them.<br>  <br>  At 19, you're too young to stick yourself with a label, since sexual orientation often doesn't make itself clear until late adolescence or early adulthood.  That's why most of the girls who label themselves bisexual as teenagers figure out a few years later that they're actually straight.  They misread normal hormonal confusion and "chose" a sexual orientation, rather than waiting to find out what their true orientation is.<br>  <br>  Most people go through periods of sexual disinterest that makes them seem asexual.  I felt the way you do when I was in high school and through my first couple years of college, which enabled me to focus my energies on things that were more important at the time.  After I graduated and settled into a job, I just felt more interested in dating.  It has a lot to do with hormones, so don't overthink it, since you can't control those.  Just be patient and let nature do the work for you.  When you're least expecting it, you'll meet someone who gives you a case of the tinglies.  And it's normal to find sex organs a little unappealing, too, since you're supposed to be attracted to the person carting them around, rather than the organs, themselves.  When you meet someone you really like, the last thing you'll be thinking about is how odd his/her "naughty bits" are.<br>  <br>  There's no reason to think you're a lesbian just because you haven't had luck dating teenage guys.  More often than not, teenage boys aren't that compelling.  But they become more interesting with age and life experience, just like the rest of us.|`|YupMCYHlaa	Just relax.

Because being either gay -or- straight is a mixed blessing.  8^)<br>  <br>  My dad used to tell me: Don't try to be something you're not.

So, why give a thoughtful answer based on intelligence, thoughtfulness, kindness, compassion or a moment to think about "how they really feel".

Arius appeared on the scene when <br>  theologians were endeavouring to harmonize the apparently contradictory doctrines of <br>  the unity of God and the Divinity of Christ.  Instead of unravelling the knot, he simply <br>  cut it by bluntly asserting that Christ was not God like the Father, but a creature made <br>  in time.  The simplicity of the solution, the ostentatious zeal of Arius for the defence of <br>  the "one God", his mode of life, his learning and dialectic ability won many to his side.  <br>  "In particular he was supported by the famous Eusebius of Nicomedia who had great <br>  influence on the Emperor Constantine.  He had friends among the other bishops of Asia <br>  and even among the bishops, priests, and nuns of the Alexandrian province.  He gained <br>  the favour of Constantia, the emperor's sister, and he disseminated his doctrine among <br>  the people by means of his notorious book which he called <thaleia> or 'Entertainment' <br>  and by songs adapted for sailors, millers, and travellers." (Addis and Arnold, "A <br>  Catholic Dictionary", 7th ed., 1905, 54.)  The Council of Nicaea anathematized the <br>  heresiarch, but its anathemas, like all the efforts of the Catholic bishops, were nullified <br>  by interference of the civil power.  Constantine and his sister protected Arius and the <br>  Arians, and the next emperor, Constantius, assured the triumph of the heresy: the <br>  Catholics were reduced to silence by dire persecution.  At once an internecine conflict <br>  began within the Arian pale, for heresy, lacking the internal cohesive element of <br>  authority, can only be held together by coercion either from friend or foe.  Sects sprang <br>  up rapidly: they are known as Eunomians, Anomoeans, Exucontians, Semi-Arians, <br>  Acacians.  The Emperor Valens (364-378) lent his powerful support to the Arians, and <br>  the peace of the Church was only secured when the orthodox Emperor Theodosius <br>  reversed the policy of his predecessors and sided with Rome.  Within the boundaries of <br>  the Roman empire the faith of Nicaea, enforced again by the General Council of <br>  Constantinople (381), prevailed, but Arianism held its own for over two hundred years <br>  longer wherever the Arian Goths held sway: in Thrace, Italy, Africa, Spain, Gaul.  The <br>  conversion of King Recared of Spain, who began to reign in 586, marked the end of <br>  Arianism in his dominions, and the triumph of the Catholic Franks sealed the doom of <br>  Arianism everywhere.

79529314dfb5ac7be366558924c3393baa	>then how come there are different races<br>  <br>  I'm not sure what you mean by 'races'. You mean different ethnicities, like african, oriental, caucasian, etc? That's just another effect of evolution: Until relatively recent times (the past few thousand years or so), transportation technology wasn't good enough for people to move around much, and different parts of the world were just about totally isolated from one another. The humans in these different areas evolved by natural selection to have different traits suited to surviving in those areas, for example europeans have the ability to digest milk more effectively than orientals, while the inuit people are relatively short and thickset in order to conserve heat in the cold climate they have been living in for many thousands of years. A particularly good example is the parallel evolution in some groups, such as black africans and native australians, who both developed (or simply didn't lose, as the case may be) the dark skin pigmentation that renders them less susceptible to sunburns in their hot, sunny, equatorial climates.<br>  <br>  >and how did the monkeys come around?<br>  <br>  They evolved from earlier species.<br>  <br>  >did they evolve from some fish or something?<br>  <br>  Yes. However, the separation in both time and physiology between us and our monkeylike ancestors is much smaller than the separation between those monkeylike ancestors and their fish ancestors- we're talking about 30 times longer here. Our ancestors split off from fish well before even the dinosaurs came around, which if I recall correctly was about 210 million years ago.|`|cIvFOzoiaa	I'm not a science major, I'm just an atheist.<br>  I'm only in 9th grade, but what it seems to me is that the species of animals spread around the world and adapted to their environments and each other, but since they were in different areas, they adapted differently.<br>  This may be wrong, I don't exactly have a PhD on the subject.|`|czf6uhIraa	You're not actually looking for an answer.

lady?<br>  <br>  Different races come from regional adaptation. We all evolve from Africans, but our features depend on our placement on the globe, and our skin tone varied based on where our ancestors evolved. <br>  <br>  In places with more direct sunlight, darker skin develops to protect us from burns, skin cancer, and prevent the absorption or production of too much vitamin D. The less direct sunlight, the lighter the skin so more vitamin D may be absorbed (from sunlight).|`|23033d499769542e5e7910234a60e4f7aa	We did not evolve from monkeys...

Often Doomsday prophecies are very scary, but the Mayan calendar only stops on that day. The Mayan's never predicted that this would be the end-of-the-world, but the beginning of a new age! Many more predictions about specific dates of the end of times, have been made in the past which have never come true. The predictions of end times appear to increase in certain time periods. After the crucifixion of Jesus Christ the apostles started predicting that the end was near way back then.<br>  <br>  During world wars 1&2, the Korean war, and Vietnam war, there were also many predictions of the end times. The media and television programs about 12/21/2012 are only trying to cash in on all of the hype and make a quick profit with 12/21/2012 fast approaching. It is true that mankind is obviously on the edge of another great change, with the recent economic crisis looming, global climate changes occurring, the speed of Internet communication ever increasing. Religious and moral differences world-wide are causing conflicting belief systems about the planets future. The doom and gloom prophecies about December 12, 2012; may or may not have any basis in fact or reality at all!<br>  <br>  Do you remember the Y2K frenzy? There is however one interesting astronomical phenomenon that will happen on 12/21/2012 when the sun rises on that day, as seen from Central America, it will be in the direction of Sagittarius in the exact center of the galaxy. While the Mayans deserve credit for figuring this out, as well as all the rest of their marvelous astronomy, none of this means their mythology is reality based. In fact they couldn't even predict their own future of what tomorrow might bring!<br>  <br>  See the source link below:|`|BucDukvnaa	Predictions similar to this <br>  made by Christians with such sincerity and seriousness, <br>  is enough to make a cat laugh. <br>  They can’t even predict what the weather is going to be tomorrow, <br>  or what horse will win the 2.30|`|SN72Hgimaa	It will absolutely be the last day with that exact date......then it will be the 22nd|`|rIvp1BToaa	no   but maybe  it will be  12-12-2121
3KD6RRhPaa	Jesus came as our unblemished Lamb of God and took all your sin and all the sins of the world away with His water baptism and His shed blood on the Cross (John 3:3-5). So in order for you to experience the cleansing of your soul forever you must come to know this heavenly gospel of the water and the Spirit and then believe in it.<br>  <br>  Its likened to someone coming along and paying off your huge debt which you could never settle, and once this person settled this debt for you, you therefore don't owe anything anymore. You are debt free!!!<br>  <br>  Likewise, if you believe in this benefactor Jesus Christ who came and paid off your debts for life, then you have no need to forever try and do your repentance prayers, trying to cleanse yourself (which is impossible), but simply to thank this Jesus for taking away all your sins whenever you commit a sin in ignorance.|`|wypaLDm0aa	maby this is god telling you hay steve this is not what i want for you in my life. mabye god doesn't want you for her. mabye god has someone more special for you in your life. often this is alot of problems people have. it's not what you want it's what god wants.<br>  <br>  you have to submit yourself to god so that your priorities line up with god's priorities so that you start to see things happen in your life.<br>  <br>  Anything that doesn't have a godly foundation under it will surely fall.<br>  <br>  is you and your girlfriends first priority in life jesus? do you and your girlfriend love jesus more than you love each other. if the answer is no then you both have things to work on.<br>  <br>  if you email me i would love to go over some bible scriptures and truely help you out steve. you seem like an awsome person give me a holler

There certainly are no problems with doctrines and as far as hypocrisy, that is a human condition that can be ignored as we are called to be shepherds of our flock. The best way to deal with hypocrisy is to pray to the Holy Spirit to help these people with their human failings. The big question is are you doubting your faith, calling or vows. It sounds as if you are having doubts about Jesus' ministry since you are doubting you want to continue acting in persona Christi for our Lord. If you work outside the Church you will not be in God's will who prayed that we all be one in His Church. You would actually be doing the work instead of the father of lies.

Even those claiming to be religious have perpetrated horrendous persecution upon other religious groups that didn't agree with them - the Inquisition, for example. Need I say more?<br>  <br>  Today, in Britain, secularism is making many threats against religious freedom, under the guise of making threats of religious hatred a crime! How cunning is that?!?

I finely called to ask why, and the Editor refused to even speak to me.

I asked why my Letters were never printed, and was told that The Paper had a right to refuse to print any Letter it chooses to refuse to print.<br>  <br>  The Goldsboro News Argus Editor knows that most people in this community will not agree with her removing this Wonderful Tradition from our News Paper.

8ZhowoPMaa	The honest answer.....<br>  People who are fat have baggage.  Most of them are caught up to some extent on their weight.  Obesity is almost always tied to depression.  And while some people have legit medical reasons, a majority of obese people got that way using food as a drug.  And not just using food as a drug.  Everyone does to a certain extent.  But a drug that they have become addicted too.  Loosing weight is hard work and partly so hard because its an addiction.  But instead of going to doctors and getting on a real weight loss plan that involves healthy food managment, mental and emotional support, and exercise starting on an appropriate level...  Most obese people try nothing but ridiculous fad diets that would be impossible for anyone to do and stay sane and exercise routines that are too far above their beginning ability.  The market is saturated with bogus quick fixes that do nothing but set the person up for failure, but it seems to be the only things people want to try.  And ofcourse men arent attracted to it.  I want to puke every time I look in the mirror, and Im looking at myself.  How can I blame someone else for not finding me attractive?<br>  <br>  A sugar coated answer...<br>  Men are pigs and are only looking for the magazine perfect sex kitten.|`|7sqpiGgoaa	stop whining and do some exercise... lifes hard, we are all given different cards to play with... you got the fat card.... stop whining and do something about it...<br>  <br>  i can't help judging heroin addicts also|`|4LrOVUgnaa	no answer will leave you satisfied.|`|M1J4xDJgaa	some people do, some don't. i'm an underprivileged short male, can't change that so i move on and just do things i like regardless of what people, in particular girls my age, think because i'm free : )

aNlT1NRqaa	It's an offensive term for an offensive Christian (usually born-again) who can't let you live your life without telling you you're going to hell because you don't believe exactly as they do.<br>  <br>  They often twist scripture to their own view. Like the group that protests at military funerals, calling the dead soldier a fa****.<br>  <br>  In the past as well as today, they also used their view to justify slavery, keeping the vote from women, prohibition, and killing abortion workers.<br>  <br>  When your belief says you should kill me for mine, I'm not going to "turn the other cheek".|`|X1jupF0paa	it comes from people thumping their finger on the bible as they quoted scripture, usually taking time to alternately wave a finger in your face. They are annoying, and give religion a negative image.|`|49c07573b2ef8b7f4c512a10de7d7febaa	It can be all of those things, and several others.  It comes from the habit of many fundamentalist preachers of literally pounding a copy of the Bible on their pulpit when they give a sermon (particularly if it's the "hell and brimstone" variety).  They tend to get very loud and agitate, and pound or "thump" the book on the lectern.  I've sat through many such a sermon as a child (I was raised Christian); they always scared me!<br>  <br>  It can also mean someone who's busy pushing the Bible on others, whether they want it or not, or who constantly references the Bible for things that have little if anything to do with the religion.  As my (Christian) granny would have said, "Some of 'em are eat up with it!"|`|dYQUQGflaa	An example would be someone that hates a gay person because it's "in the bible."<br>  <br>  Not an offensive name to all Christians.

It could also come from those who would quote the Bible and tap on it to indicate it was the source of what they were saying.<br>  <br>  Basically, anyone who preaches Christianity fervently or quotes the Bible too frequently is now included in the derogatory term.|`|BucDukvnaa	Preaches from the bible, <br>  bangs the bible on the table or thumps it with his hand to get your attention.<br>  Waves it about in front of your face, opens it out pointing to underlined passages.<br>  Similar behaviour exhibited by followers of other such texts as Mein Kampf,  Little red book, Manifesto etc|`|lTUXdbCTaa	It is someone who tries to force the Bible onto others basically.<br>  Unfortunately, sometimes it is used to define Christians.|`|CugCzH9iaa	I have always heard it used in reference to those preachers who yell (sometimes thumping or hitting their Bible) and preach fire and brimstone every week.|`|cXXJVz64aa	It's an offensive name for a Christian.

Most "vampire cults" are dumb teenage kids that think they're cool.  Some vampire cults may be religious, but by and large they're just a bunch of wierdos.  Some probably worship "vampire gods" and others maybe worship the Devil.<br>  <br>  Here's a story from the UK, and apparently they believed in Satan:<br>  <a href="http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/serial_killers/weird/vampires/10.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/seria...</a>|`|wTmNCQhcaa	I would say...no. I admit I don't know much about them, other than that one cult that killed the one member's parents. But the literal definition of a religion is a group of people who follow a supernatural power.

g4lLX3iaaa	King George V|`|GHefTsUyaa	Who was King of Scotland in 1933?|`|N7CJSTr1aa	The King of England was George V. His wife was Queen Mary, and they had 6 children: Edward, Alfred ( who later became George VI), Mary, John, Henry and the real George. After that, Edward became King, but abdicated the throne to his younger brother, Alfred. Alfred (of George VI) is Elizabeth II's father.|`|Iqp3ZUAlaa	George V reigned from 1910 to 1936.His ill-fated son,Edward VIII succeeded him for a short time,only to abdicate to marry Mrs.Simpson.George V knew that Edward would not make a good king;he had once said,"I hope that nothing comes between Bertie(George VI),Lilibet and the throne."<br>  <a href="http://www.royal.gov.uk" rel="nofollow">http://www.royal.gov.uk</a> has a short biography on George V:<br>  "George V's reign began amid the continuing constitutional crisis over the House of Lords, which refused to pass a Parliament Bill limiting its powers (which would remove its power to veto a Bill from the Commons). <br>  <br>  After the Liberal government obtained the King's promise to create sufficient peers to overcome Conservative opposition in the Lords (and won a second election in 1910), the Parliament Bill was passed by the Lords in 1911 without a mass creation of peers. <br>  <br>  George visited India in 1911, the only King-Emperor to do so. He was accompanied by his wife, Queen Mary. <br>  <br>  In 1914 the First World War broke out. The King made over 450 visits to troops and over 300 visits to hospitals visiting wounded servicemen, he pressed for proper treatment of German prisoners-of-war and he pressed also for more humane treatment of conscientious objectors. <br>  <br>  In 1917 anti-German feeling led him to adopt the family name of Windsor (after the Castle of the same name). <br>  <br>  Support for home rule for Ireland had grown in the late 19th century. This was resisted by the Unionists in the north and by the Conservative Party. The 1916 Easter Rising in Dublin, and subsequent civil war, resulted in the setting up of the Irish Free State (later to become the Irish Republic) in 1922, while the six northern counties remained part of the United Kingdom. George played a conciliatory role on this, and on other occasions, such as the General Strike of 1926. <br>  <br>  George readily accepted the first Labour government in 1924. Following the world slump of 1929, the King persuaded the Labour leader to head a National Government composed of all parties, which won the election of 1931. <br>  <br>  The Statute of Westminster of 1931 meant Dominion Parliaments could now pass laws without reference to United Kingdom laws, and abolished various reserve powers still possessed by the Crown and Parliament. This paradoxically increased the monarchy's importance, since the Dominions (no longer subordinated to one supreme Parliament at Westminster) were now linked through common allegiance to the Crown. <br>  <br>  George started the annual Christmas Broadcast by the sovereign to the Empire (more recently to the Commonwealth), the first being transmitted in 1932. <br>  <br>  In 1935, the King celebrated his Silver Jubilee, an occasion of great public rejoicing. <br>  <br>  He died in 1936 and his son Edward succeeded to the throne."|`|sbnUAllfaa	King George the Vth, to complete the deal his wife was Queen Mary.<br>  Now you know I wasn't copying other answers.<br>  <br>  Pee - Wee.|`|1evqSw67aa	george 5th.|`|U3fwQPcjaa	King George V (1910-1936)<br>  <a href="http://www.britannia.com/history/monarchs/mon60.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.britannia.com/history/monarch...</a>|`|H1qwIaP1aa	It was King George V.|`|YgUCXYuxaa	king george v|`|b06d5f5c50bd7cf1d8a2a3aedfcc1c94aa	George V 1865 - 1936

P544Sbmqaa	Marijuana.  I cant stand the way alcohol makes me feel.  I want to stay far away from the harder drugs.  But marijuana is cool.  Having a hit or two for me is the equivalent of someone else having a beer or two, most of the time.  Other times it helps me concentrate and be creative.  I support legalization with age restrictions and dui laws specifically pertaining to marijuana and all other narcotics.|`|uu1IUxAkaa	1 girl - Natural high & healthy|`|AA11922229	My drug of choice is fresh ocean air, because fresh air and soberness is the the highest level of consciousness attainable. Six things happen which are not possible with chemical mind altering consciousness. The body is cleansed with the intake of fresh air and the exhalation of negative energy. The body is oxygenated. The mind reaches a state of relaxation,  The body reaches a happy state of homeostasis, a balanced level of health, a rise of life energy within the body, a super level of healing. The mind reaches a creative mode of realization, a grasp of real life,  and although the transcendental moment is temporary, the essence of the moment, and the feeling of the moment is remembered eternally.  <br>  <br>  Meditation is attainable by anyone, even animals experience meditation. Man's intellect is short circuiting his ability to be alive. Meditation is a return to our primal self.  Meditation is the reverse of intoxication.  <br>  <br>  Drugs are an injection of pollutants into the body, often in excess, causing the body to go into emergency elimination mode, diaphoresis (sweat), urination, emisis (vomiting), and deification ( diarrhea).<br>  <br>  Chemicals impair the functioning of the body's systems. The defense systems of the body are stressed to extremes and are overloaded to the point of tissue damage from the poisons in the blood. The entire body fights to survive.<br>  <br>  The lungs are effected with possible risk of oxygen deprivation, a slow suffocation of the every cell in  body, with highest risk of cumulative brain damage within minutes of taking the drugs. <br>  <br>  All the bodies systems going into emergency mode accelerate. Pulse, blood pressure, and respiration all increase. The mind goes into a frenzy. Amazing, the automatic functions controlled by the brain can sustain with the over load of chemicals, but they do or else death ensues. It happens all the time. My first cousin, the same age as I, ODed with casual drugs at 19 years. He hung out with the wrong crowd. <br>  <br>  Maybe with drugs there is a moment of unique inspiration, but it is a fleeting moment of numerous silly signals and they are forgotten forever.<br>  <br>  Good luck with that. I hope you can read this. It took years to develop to this point. You may stand on my shoulders if you like. Even a chimpanzee can attain transcendental excellence and they do all the time.

One is the book of the universe, a jot of whose testimony we have heard from the thirteen Flashes together with the Thirteenth Word of the Risale-i Nur. Another is the Seal of the Prophets (Peace and blessings be upon him), the supreme sign of the book of the universe. The other is the Qur’an of Mighty Stature. Now we must become acquainted with the Seal of the Prophets (PBUH), who is the second and articulate proof, and must listen to him.<br>  Yes, consider the collective personality of this proof: the face of the earth has become his mosque, Mecca, his mihrab, and Medina, his pulpit. Our Prophet (Peace and blessings be upon him), this clear proof, is leader of all the believers, preacher to all mankind, the chief of all the prophets, lord of all the saints, the leader of a circle for the remembrance of God comprising all the prophets and saints. He is a luminous tree whose living roots are all the prophets, and fresh fruits are all the saints; whose claims all the prophets relying on their miracles and all the saints relying on their wonder-working confirm and corroborate. For he declares and claims: “There is no god but God!” And all on left and right, that is, those luminous reciters of God’s Names lined up in the past and the future, repeat the same words, and through their consensus in effect declare: “You speak the truth and what you say is right!” What false idea has the power to meddle in a claim which is thus affirmed and corroborated by thousands?|`|BYvAivz1aa	He was a normal man like anyone but he couldn't read or write.. then the quran came down to him... it was said that light came from his face and he was really handsome.<br>  Allah protected him from all evil including the devil.<br>  before he was the prophet everyone respected him because he was always truthfull, kind, respectful and so on..|`|77AJmExlaa	see shia worshipping their imams here:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.nejom.com/up/nejom/fn1973.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.nejom.com/up/nejom/fn1973.jpg</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://almuslm.jeeran.com/9owar_shee3ah/alsejood%20wa%20al9alah%20mowajahat%20alqabr.bmp" rel="nofollow">http://almuslm.jeeran.com/9owar_shee3ah/...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.up-00.com/szfiles/eui43811.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.up-00.com/szfiles/eui43811.jp...</a>|`|4sc7bMbkaa	she is the best man in this world ever!<br>  he was Highly educated from Allah!
gyrihMqhaa	Having finished his hajj to Makkah, the Prophet of Allah  returned to Madinah and the great multitude of Muslims went back with him. At Ghadir Khum (Brook of Khum) somewhere on his way to Madinah, he received the order of Allah to appoint Imam Ali ibn Abi Talib  as his successor and the commander of the faithful after him.<br>  Allah, the Most High, for some purpose only He knew, willed that this place should be where the Divine order would be communicated to the people.<br>  <br>  The sun was slowly climbing in the sky and soon noon was approaching. It was a hot, sweltering day. It was so warm that when the Messenger  stopped the Muslims to tell them Heaven's order, they began wrapping their feet with garments to ward off the heat of the gravel. It was the extra importance of the order, which by no means could be postponed, that made the Messenger  halt, at that place and to deliver the new message.<br>  He stopped them at crossroads from which they would go in different directions. Many of them would not see or hear the Messenger  thereafter.<br>  <br>  It was the last hour for many of the Muslims to see the Messenger  and hear him telling them that Ali , and only Imam Ali, would be their social and religious leader. It was the hour of good-bye and such an hour would be etched in one' s memory and so would be its implications. It had a distinguished flavour with deeply rushing sentiments. Had the Messenger  delivered the news of the appointment of Imam Ali , say 10 years earlier, the importance may have forgotten or it could have been subdued. But at the behest of Allah, he made it the last thing he communicated to his people so that it would live in the conscience of the ummah and remain alive in their memory.<br>  He stood upon many mounts gathered for the purpose, so that all could have him in view. He praised and thanked Allah and said:<br>  <br>  "O people! I am about to be called to Allah and depart to Him. I am responsible and so are you.

Befriend every friend of his and be the enemy of every enemy of his. O people! I will depart from you and you will certainly meet me at the Fountain: A Fountain that is wider than the distance between me and Sanaa and has two goblets of silver as large as the space in which the stars are swimming. I will be asking you, when you return to me at the Fountain, about two weighty things: The weightier one is the Book of Allah, the Mighty and Glorified, which has two bonds, one is in the hand of Allah, the Most High, and the other in your hands. So hold tight to it, don't go astray and don't change your faith. The other mighty thing is my progeny, my household.

I1BlNBAaaa	"BTW, I'm an atheist" you just contradicted yourself, with your question being I believe in a different God. Because you have clearly stated that you believe is something just not necessarily the God that Christians do. Welcome to the world of being a human being, you are allowed to believe in a higher power without calling it God or even having to give it a name for that matter, you just know that something other then yourself is in control and that is fine with you. Pagans have been doing it for years and we like it like that. That is why the Christians don't like us very much, they think we are out to take over their churches and ruin their children...lol.

One thing that occurs to me when I read this is that math is an abstraction created by the human mind. By that I mean, in the universe itself, 2 or 4 or even 0 don't really exist because they are ideas (symbols to represent another idea called "quantity") of the mind. So if you get rid of ideas, what you have left is matter. Yet matter has meaning because it takes the shape of objects to which we assign names. Meaning is something more than pure, indifferent nature. I don't know what the answer is but those are some of the thoughts that come up for me. Basically it seems that if there is any God, it would be mind or "idea" in the broad sense rather than something totally mindless. But beyond that it's all a big mystery to me.
5BVZWhusaa	Trousers are an item of clothing worn on the lower part of the body from the waist to the ankles, covering both legs separately (rather than with cloth stretching across both as in skirts and dresses). Such items of clothing are often referred to as pants in countries such as Canada, South Africa and The United States. Additional synonyms include slacks, kegs or kex, breeches (sometimes pronounced [?br?t??z]) or breeks. Historically, as for the West, trousers have been the standard lower-body clothing item for males since the 16th century; by the late 20th century, they had become prevalent for females as well. Trousers are worn at the hips or waist, and may be held up by their own fastenings, a belt, or suspenders (braces).

W8bs2VQSaa	I suffered a bout of cancer 9 years ago, one of the bad ones that usually kills you. For the duration of my illness, I had a lot of time to contemplate my mortality and come to terms with my demise. I had time to go through the different phases of grieving, and to figure out what my life had been all about, and what parts were important to me. <br>  <br>  Then, the wonderful news came that I had been cured. I took the knowledge that I'd gained from my meditations, and over the next year or so I made many changes in my life. Those changes were all for the best, and made it possible for me to enjoy every precious moment of life that has been given to me. Before that, I'd been puddling along without giving things a great deal of thought - now I'm grateful for every day, and I make the most of every opportunity.

It happened on his 40th birthday.  He was thrown out the back window of his pick up truck when it rolled over after hitting a badly botched repair on a gravel road less than a mile from our home.  Every rib was broken in more than one place.  The broken ribs punctured both lungs and sliced his spleen in half.  He suffered a compound fracture of his clavicle and his left leg was broken where it joins the ball of his hip.  An elderly neighbor who had just had both knees replaced that winter found him by chance when he looked across his field and saw the truck in the ditch.  It was the neighbors first trip outside since his surgery.  <br>  I received the call to get to the local hospital as soon as possible because they were preparing him to be life lined to a  hospital in Indy.  I was 45 miles away at the prison I worked at.  <br>  When I got to the hospital his parents had both of our children there.  They gave me a quick and sanitized update of his condition because both of the kids were there.  When I got back to where they were working on him, he was already in a paralyzed state and not breathing on his own.<br>  The doctors tried to prepare me, as they didn't feel he would live through the night.  I leaned over him and said "you will make it through this".  "The girls are here and we will always be here for you".  By then the care flight was there to pick him up.  My girls were allowed to quickly kiss him and then he was gone....in God's and medical personel's hands.<br>  The horror of this event taught us all many things.  I learned that when faced with many burdens to focus.  Life had to go on for his family, bills had to be paid and I had to be strong for him and my children.  He was in a coma for 2 months and in a rehab facility for 2 more months.  <br>  The bliss we learned was that life wasn't about chasing the almighty dollar, thinking that this would secure our children's future.  At the time of his accident neither he nor I was home very much.  He worked 7 days a week and I was at work from sun up till past sun down.  <br>  I took an extended leave to be with him and the kids.  When he was able to come home I asked to be put on 8 hours.  They weren't willing to do this so I put in my resignation.  Financially we have never been as secure since but this event taught us many things about ourselves and to who our true responsibilty in life should be.  We've never regretted our decision.  He got to work for 10 more years until the his plant closed and the results of his injuries casued him to be disabled.

They would try to cheat at checkers when they played with him, lol. . He would laugh and say wadda wadda wadda wadda. . Which meant you can't fool me !  We had him for 5 or 6 more years, and my children learned patience with the elderly, compassion and kindness to someone who has less in life than you do, appreciation for time spent with family, unconditional love to someone different than you are, how to give instead of receive and so much more of the good lessons in life.  They learned these things way before some of their playmates did, and turned them into the wonderful adults they are today.  So yes, there are many blessings in disguise . . . keep your eyes open for them !|`|5qFmukWwaa	My aunt fought and beat cancer in her younger years but when it came back in her 80s she just didn't want to go through all that again.  She went home with one of her daughters and they managed the pain (with medication) as much as possible.  The good that came out of this was the time her daughters and son had to spend with her.  They had long conversations about the past and the future and she even planned her own funeral.|`|aXYiOskmaa	i don't know if i'd call it a 'blessing" but, when our mom died 14 yrs ago, my older bro started coming around again. he had kind ostracized himself for many years due to some problems.our dad was thrilled that my brother became a member of the family again and it was nice to be able to get to know him again before he passed this last september|`|XEbrGfZuaa	Seventeen years ago, my mother suffered a major stroke. She'd had<br>  a couple earlier, but not as debilitating. My sister drove her to the <br>  hospital and alerted those of us, she could. I saw my mother briefly<br>  as she laid there looking at two of her sisters, and myself, her daughter also. She didn't like us staring at her, As she felt like she<br>  was the meat and we were all vultures. So we left her to rest. Later<br>  that day, she had a brain hemorrage and went into a coma. She never<br>  saw or spoke to anyone again. The surgeon, released pressure on her<br>  brain from the hemorrhage, and said that if she lived, she' would be<br>  a vegitable, needing around the clock care. None of us was in the<br>  position to provide that. And no one wanted her to be in that cond-<br>  tion, and just existing, rather than fully living.<br>     She was put on life support for three days. And when she was taken<br>  off, she lived several more hours on her own.<br>      I don't know if she had any thoughts in her mental state.  But I did<br>  say my goodbyes' while she was in the coma. I feel she was removed<br>  from a future life of silent agony, in releasing her hold on life. And <br>  she left just four days, after my birthday.

A mother will protect a child, and nurture it and keep it from harm, sometimes to the detriment of the child's development.

But no, i'll tell you what's f---ed about the stigma about fat people is that most of this stigma is against fat women not really men. EVEN though men have testosterone while we have estrogen!!! Testosterone helps muscle development while estrogen promotes fat gain. So it's COMPLETELY back to front! Men burn more calories sitting then women because of their testosterone. and yet you hear phrases like "no fat chicks" - Uhh I'm sick of it!!!<br>  Now this actually seems like a "fat chick feminazi" rant but truth be told I'm thin and I just hate double standards!

Just in between is good. I don't think dark eyes and hair are very exotic with that complexion because that's the features that usually accompany that skin tone. I could probably go to any Asian country and find at least a billion women all fitting that description. So if it was like blue/green eyes and blond/red hair, that would be "exotic" because it's out of the norm.

apnOVubMaa	Hi Babyyygirl. Did you know that to forgive someone who has hurt you is a gift from God. We can not do this on our own. Just the fact that you want to forgive your father is enough for Jesus. Keep that thought in your heart and when its the right timing and timing is everything with God this will be a reality to you. Your Mama knows exactly what he is doing. she chooses to stay with him and over look the problem he has. This is very common in life. As far as him getting back to you when you need him, well sweet dear I'm a Senior and my father is really a big Senior of 90 and to this day he only talks  to me when I call first. It does not bother me anymore to call him, its always been this way. I,m just glad he is still alive and I can hear his voice. Honor thy mother and father. You will be doing good by being as kind as you can when you talk to him and love him truly. You love him but you hate the sin he is choosing.Don,t condone his actions, If he ever ask you what is wrong you can in good conscience in a kind manner explain to him that there will be no adultery in heaven and what your doing is hurting the family.In communicating with men at there conveniences pretty standard.They don,t think like we do so don't ever expect them to know how to communicate  correctly with the opposite gender unless they have studied up on it. You have a life and I suggest to live it as honorable an you possibly can . You might teach him things.Theres a right way and a wrong way in making choices , You be the example for him. Let him learn from you.All you have to think about this is you obey God . You live a rightous                                                              life and you be responsible to your own life and too God. God bless you Babyyygirl. Love in christ,missleslie|`|tQO9LW8Qaa	When you're little you think of your parents as role models. When you get older, you have to face the fact that sometimes they teach you what not to do as well as what you should do. Fathers and mothers are human, and that's a hard lesson to learn, but it's a part of growing up. Be patient with him and with yourself. Aim first for acceptance, then for understanding, and move from there to forgiveness if and when you can.|`|N89HLv92aa	It take time to forgive. Does he see that what he is doing wrong?

Is it you that is always doing the compromising in the relationship. Maybe this is a turning point in your relationship with him.

nS7koC7Oaa	Al-Hadith Al-Qudsi is the divine speech which the prophet (saw) has narrated without being via Jibreel (as), it was directly inspired to the prophet (saw), the meaning is from Allah (saw) and phrasing it is by the prophet (saw).

(Glorious Quran  7:185)|`|iH7ZB5Soaa	God’s Most Noble Messenger (Upon whom be blessings and peace) was a human being; hence he acted like a human being. He was also a messenger and prophet, and with regard to his messengership, he was an interpreter and an envoy of Almighty God. His messengership was based upon Revelation, which is of two kinds:<br>  The First is explicit Revelation. In this case, the Noble Messenger is merely an interpreter and announcer, with no share in the content. The Qur’an and some Sacred Hadith are included in this kind of Revelation.<br>  The Second is implicit Revelation. The essence and summary of this is also based on Revelation or inspiration, but its explanation and description were left to the Messenger. When he explained and described such Revelation, sometimes he again relied on Revelation, or on inspiration, or sometimes he spoke in terms of his own insight. And, when he resorted to his own interpretation, he either relied on the perceptive power given him on account of his prophetic mission, or he spoke as a human being and conformably to usage, custom and the level of common comprehension.<br>  Thus, all the details of every Hadith are not necessarily derived from pure revelation, nor should the lofty marks of messengership be sought in such thoughts and transactions of his as are required by his participation in the human state. Since some truths were revealed to him in a brief and abstract form, and he himself described them in the light of his insight and according to common comprehension, the metaphors and allusions in his descriptions sometimes may need explanation, or even interpretation.|`|mOWyzwubaa	these classifications are made by bukhary and co.there is no such thing as qudsi,all made up,<br>  <br>  [12:111]  In their history, there is a lesson for those who possess intelligence.

Indeed, he who associates others with Allah - Allah has forbidden him Paradise, and his refuge is the Fire.

Studying Islaam can be done later (when they aren't under the age of 7... <br>  <br>  Some rulings my daughter (of 4 years old) knows (and tries to follow) just by viewing us (like Goefranak after the toilet, that the salaah is fininshed after tasleem, saying bismillaah before eating and drinking. We praise her if she does something good and on her own free wil and other way if she leaves something behind she hears from us (properbly you forget to say ...? Have you forgotten we as muslims are eating with the right hand? <br>  <br>  Some things she learned just by asking.... She asked me last year, mommy may i eat a lot of candy? I said to her, the Sunnah of Muhammed is that you should eat 1,3,5,7,9 (she can count untill 10), so how many do you wanna eat? She is still a child by saying 9. I said to her i can give you 9 candy, but you should divide. She agreed, she gave me one, her father one, her little brother one and kept 6 for herself. After 3 candy she had enough and said "mom here you get 3 more because you are nice..." I said to her thank you, but i let one here because if i eat more than 3 candy i get pain in my belly, is that alright with you? She said yes, because otherwise i receive also pain in my belly. Or you could ask your father if he wants one candy more? She runs to her father asks do you wanna eat one candy? Here, but eat not more than 3, otherwise you will get pain in your belly! I praised her and she said, "it is easy to give way, rather to keep and get pain in my belly." I said to her, do you know what you could keep for yourself, if you want? This glass with "blabla"-drank (we in dutch say bla bla (typicall the sound of a sheep, for unusefull talk, i call it bla bla drank, because of the high sugar level...) I make for her a long small glass of this drank knowing it is not more drank in it than a normal glass. "Here you go, because you are a nice girl, masha Allaah here you receive a straw.." Thank you mommy and i said to her, wait did you forget to say something? She said no i have already said Bismi Allaah! I smiled to her and i said to her where do you wait for than? Enjoy your drank!<br>  <br>  All i wanted to teach her the sunnah of unequal numbers and not to eat so many you get pain in the belly (one third of the stomach is for food, one third is for drank and one third is for the belly itself) and to exam her about the rules she already knows. <br>  <br>  It is a way on how you present the Rules to your children. And how you look upon it, do you think this rules are there to maltreat you or to protect you. If you teach your children that rules are here to protect us (even agianst harm we can't see or notice) the children take it easily over. (Like not going outside after magrib, we said to her she can't go because it is gonna get dark and she will fall...) But if you show the Rules are outdated and not there to protect you but to torture you (like "Stay in your houses"), they will receive the message, okay if i don't follow the islaam, "i am free".... And so you raise difficult children, why me but not you? I want also this and also that... Not realising it is bad habit or sinning...

Baptism in water is not required as the Spirit of God comes upon the believer at the time of regeneration. Baptism then is seen as the outward sign of the inward state, kind of like Confirmation in the Methodist or Catholic churches.<br>  <br>  Not all believe this is the case. Fundamentalist groups may contend that a water baptism is necessary. You must carefully study the scriptures to determine this for yourself. <br>  <br>  Chafer's Systematic Theology helped me to find what I believe in conjunction with serious reading and praying about the subject.<br>  <br>  In Christ, and not with divisive intent for the believing community here,<br>  - Isaac|`|f1oFH4rCaa	I can't speak for Jews, but Jesus Christ said, "except a man be born of water and of the spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of god" John 3:5.  It is a commitment to god to keep his commandments and remember him.  <br>  <br>  Immersion, specifically, is furthermore symbolic of the death of an old life and the beginning of a new one; also of the death and resurrection of Jesus himself.|`|qK1iEcVhaa	Most people don't even do that anymore, but baptizing is pretty much purifying yourself, lol just think of it as a tradition to wash yourself before you become holy haha.|`|7mxCMfYKaa	Its an outward profession of faith.

Ipheh638aa	i like boys too, huh! what can we do? lol|`|zBqt99avaa	Okay I haven't read the other answers, but just your question and edits.<br>  <br>  First of all, it's okay.  You're feeling torn between two lives.  You know there are good things in Islam, but you're seeing a life you want to be a part of and you know you can't, not really.  And because your mom is the one stopping you, you feel a little resentment, but you love her and respect her and are more or less trying to do what she wants, but you want you own life too.<br>  <br>  This is normal for everyone, Muslim or non-Muslim.  There comes a time in every person's life when they want different things from what their parents want for them.<br>  <br>  But the reality is your mom knows best.  Just being in a room with both boys and girls is not actually haram.  But what might happen while you're there may be.  And not just to you, I mean, you sound like a good girl, but you might end up watching things you shouldn't see. Then being asked to lie.  And cover up.  How will that sit on your conscience?  How does that mesh with your beliefs?<br>  <br>  I'm a western christian and I've been there, done that.  Parties, nightclubs, drinking, dancing, boyfriends, I did all those things.  But those aren't the memories that I cherish from my teenage years and early twenties.  Makeover parties with my girlfriends.  Hockey games.  Staying up all night chatting about future dreams.  Movie fests.  Those are the things I remember.  The parties and the craziness isn't as fun as people say it is.  You're not really missing out on anything.<br>  <br>  If your friends are really your friends, they'll care about you and your beliefs.  If you tell them you would love to come to their party, but can't because of the guys, ask if once in a while you can have an all-girl event.  Host one at your place.  This gives you the opportunity to show your mom that your friends aren't so bad and you don't want such terrible things, just to have friends and feel accepted.  That is something your mom can understand (inshallah).<br>  <br>  About general discussions at school, you should just be frank with your mom.  Let her know it's really not feasible for you to completely blow guys off at school, but promise you won't go seeking them out for conversation.  Then don't go seeking them out for conversation (LOL).<br>  <br>  Don't forget what Islam has given the world: science, medicine, literature, many important and exciting discoveries have come about due to members of the ummah.  Prayer is important to every faith, but especially yours.  Remember that God asks so little of each of us in return for all He's done.  A few minutes of prayer each day will help you feel more connected to your faith.<br>  <br>  Good luck and take care.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  well...loads can happen at the theatre too o_O<br>  <br>  One way we got around this problem with our parents was...chaperone.  If it's a birthday party, talk to your mom about acting reasonable, and see if the hosts would mind your mom coming to help.  Put up with this once or twice and see if that helps your mom trust you more.<br>  <br>  As for movies, mom can drive or pick up from the theatre, that way she sees what you're wearing, who's there, etc.  But of course, you don't want your mom shadowing your every move...but you might have to compromise to get some of what you want.  If you have any specific things you can e-mail me if you want, but this answer is getting collosal!  lol.|`|RVWyPicKaa	Don't blame your mother..... <br>  I|`|4FxmTLayaa	I don′t know why you′re feeling ill but you should just take it easy, inshallah you′ll feel better, and don′t take your mother seriously, you say you live in austraila? your mother is probably not used to the australian culture.

mOWyzwubaa	There are only Muslims mentioned in the Quran. <br>  <br>  The Quranic Iman can not enter a Sectarian Heart. It can only enter an open heart. <br>  <br>  "And that those on whom knowledge has been bestowed may know that, The (QURAN) is THE TRUTH from your Rabb (Nourisher), so that they may acquire Iman in it and their hearts may be made humbly (open) to it."(22:54)<br>  <br>  Thus the real challenge is: Do we have the courage and the patience to go deep down in our hearts and try to cleanse them from all types of non-Quranic concepts so that Iman can enter? Or, do we simply want to keep practicing what our forefathers have passed on to us? The choice is ours. But we better be prepared to face the consequences of that choice.<br>  <br>  Iman is not to accept it with the tongue but to accept it with the heart. (2:8-9)<br>  <br>  To accept everything which the Quran says as truth is Iman. (2:26)<br>  <br>  In order to acquire Iman in Allah, it is necessary to first reject every authority other than Allah.

PvgZUzHjaa	You can be pro-life and also pro-choice.  I am.  I consider myself pro-life because I think abortion is a very serious thing, and taking the life of a potential human being should never be done casually.  But I am pro- choice because I recognize that sometimes it is a matter of necessity.  <br>  <br>  To me, the important thing is to make sure every pregnant woman knows what all the options are, what the consequences are of the various options, and what help is available to support her in her decision.  Then those who are pro-life (i.e., anti-abortion) should concentrate on supporting the options involved in carrying the fetus to term.|`|Be55sDJlaa	Atheists tend to think more scientifically, since the bible is so blatantly against science (ressurection, miracles, etc)<br>  So you need to consider what life really is.<br>  Scientists don't consider a cluster of a couple thousand cells life (which is the time at which people usually get abortions)<br>  -a fly's brain is 200,000 cells<br>  -a cockroaches brain is 1,000,000 cells<br>  <br>  Pro choicer's also have a big problem with people like YOU making the choice for other people whether or not they should have an abortion.

It is most commonly used, especially in the media and popular discourse, to refer to opposition to abortion. More generally, the term describes a political and ethical view which maintains that human fetuses and embryos are persons and therefore have a right to live. Less commonly, it can be used to indicate opposition to practices such as euthanasia, the death penalty, human cloning, and research involving human embryonic stem cells.<br>  <br>  On the issue of abortion, pro-life campaigners are opposed by pro-choice campaigners who generally argue in terms of the reproductive rights of the woman, rather than fetal rights.|`|POzCKBzvaa	I have to say - if you think abortion is a viable option in those situations, I'd call you pro-choice.

A rose is a rose...|`|jard50Yiaa	Constantine I, Roman Emperor adopted Christianity following his victory in the Battle of Milvian Bridge in 312 AD. Under his rule, Christianity rose to become the dominant religion in the Roman Empire, and for his example of a "Christian monarch" Constantine is revered as a saint in the Eastern Orthodox Church. Not only the details of his adoption of Christianity make the religious beliefs of Constantine I interesting; theologians and historians alike have argued about the question to which form of Christianity Constantine ultimately converted, with regard to the legitimation of religious persecution.<br>  <br>  Though Emperor Constantine I had been exposed to Christianity by his mother, St. Helena, there is scholarly controversy as to whether he adopted his mother's Christianity in his youth, or whether he adopted it gradually over the course of his life. Whatever the case, the accession of Constantine was a turning point for the Christian Church. In 313, Constantine issued the Edict of Milan, legalizing Christian worship, and the emperor would be a great patron of the Church and set a precedent for the position of the Christian Emperor within the Church that would be followed for centuries.|`|tI1NHwfBaa	Nope.<br>  <br>  Christianity was growing wildly long before Constantine got interested in it.  Early Christians, you'll recall, were fed to the lions in Rome, and there was never a short supply of them.  Early Christians lived together, underground, hidden as much as possible from the authorities who wanted to kill them for their beliefs.<br>  <br>  And yet they continued to grow in number.|`|rGEZup0Zaa	North mythology does not inspire conformity and respect of authority. Hence, Constantine chose Christianity.|`|PRzmwFfgaa	No.|`|zPfgFXU5aa	Constantine was much smarter than that. Constantine wanted to have a state Church, with Christian clergy acting as civil servants, so He and a very ambitious Bishop of Rome took Christianity and combined it with Roman Paganism and Greek Philosphy and manufactured a State run religion to unite the Empire.<br>  <br>  This Religion was spread using Roman roads, Roman wealth, Roman law, Roman power, and Roman military might.<br>  <br>  Before Constantine, Christians were persecuted. Now, instead of facing persecution, the Bishop of Rome lived in the lap of luxury just like the high ranking Government official he now was. He had a beautiful palace, with the finest furniture and art. He wore silk brocade robes. He had servants to wait on him. Near his palace was a basilica which was to serve as his cathedral. This luxurious building had seven altars made of gold, a canopy of solid silver above the main altar, and 50 chandeliers. The imperial mail system and transportation system were placed at his disposal.<br>  <br>  The Christian Church was radically changed. Suddenly, being Christian resulted in power, prestige, and promotion (whereas previously it had resulted in persecution). Suddenly, by the Emperor's decree, Christianity became "politically correct". So ambitious people joined the Church for worldly reasons. <br>  <br>  Now in theory Constantine could have successfully promoted and god or religious system he chose to, but then he would have had the thorn in his side of those pesky Christians who would rather die than renounce jesus. It was far smarter of Constantine to take over Christianity and slowly evolve it into a new system.<br>  <br>  Not all Christians went along with this of course and the Roman Catholic church branded them as "hererics" and spent the next 1,500 years persecuting them and trying to drive them out of existence. They almost succeded but there have always been Christians who rejected Roman Catholisim and with the Protestant Reformation they went from being a small minority to almost equal numbers.<br>  <br>  I think therefore that regardless of what Constantine did or didn't do, there would still be a sizeable Christian Church in existence today. Only difference being that they might have been closer to the original church of the Apostles - the church described in the New testament Book of Acts In which there is no 'Queen of Heaven', no praying to Angels, Saints, Martyrs, no 'Infallible Pope', no devotion to relics, no use of the kiss as a sign of reverence for holy objects, no practice of kneeling, no use of candles and incense. <br>  <br>  All those things came later when the Pagans were absorbed into the Roman church and brought their Pagan traditions, customs and practices with them which the church was only too happy to receive and adopt.|`|Be55sDJlaa	Constantine spread Christianity because he figured that his empire would be best if everyone was christian because that was most fitting in regards to them being controlled, obedient,  non-violent, etc...|`|XpZumlkwaa	Two.|`|xBGEcPvCaa	No

This is the true original gospel!!!!<br>  <br>  The reason for His death on the Cross was because He took them up in the Jordan River when He was baptized (Matt 3:15). He could not have been crucified if He was not baptized where all the sins of the world were laid upon Him in accordance with the sacrificial system as set by God.<br>  <br>  In the OT the Jews on the Day of Atonement had all their sin laid upon an unblemishhed goat called a scapegoat by the High Priest Aaron by him laying his hands on it head. It was then led out to the barren dersert bearing all their sins where it died. This enabled the children of Israel to becoime sinless for another year before God.<br>  <br>  Likewise, in the NT the Messiah Jesus Christ came to us as this scapegoat as promised in the OT or Torah, and in like fashion took away all our sins by His water baptism and His shed blood on the Cross.<br>  <br>  This is the true Jewish gospel that God originally gave to mankiind, and it has been made available to all men living on this planet.

This because the Jew refused to accept that fictional Jesus story and the Romans began what became the hate of the Jew across the world.  Christianity promoted that hate of the Jews and still does.|`|d42418ca88e523b628710adb23553fb1aa	The point of His death was to redeem Israel, and to effect a new covenant as stated in Hebrews 8:8. You have to understand that Jesus was the Son sent to His people. He made the way for Israel to be brought back into the fold.     Israel was a cast off nation/people that Peter and James wrote to, read Hosea. He is the one leader, He stated in Matthew 15:24, He was sent only for the lost sheep of the House of Israel.

And man was incapable of paying for those sins.  The sins were owed to God; so, God became man, and as a man payed for our sins.  Just any ole prophet couldn't be a sacrifice for our sins because man is incapable of paying off those sins.  Only God was capable of paying for the sins owed to him.  So, he self-limited himself in Jesus Christ and as a man paid for our sins.<br>  <br>  Now, as far as faith, having a personal relationship with God, God has revealed the truth of his word.  To someone who doesn't have this it may seem like foolishness.|`|UCrcbyCPaa	In the name of Allah the most Gracious the most merciful.<br>  <br>  As a Muslim i respect your religious beliefs and views but i may not agree with them.<br>  Firstly on what basis do christians call jesus a God or a Son Of God or a part of a Godly trinity???The Church has told you so.Jesus Did not!<br>  Religious beliefs should be based on proofs of Gods word and the statements recorded from Prophets and messengers sent by almighty God.Not on man made theory and concepts.<br>  Where is it in the Bible that jesus says ;;I am God so worship me and pray to me"'<br>  It is the Bible writers and backgrounded commentators who tried to show jesus as a son of God with a few uttarences here and there.Prove to your own self from your Bible where Jesus has said vertabim '' I am the only son of God and i have to offer myself as a sacrifice for your sins''<br>  Prove to your self in your bible where jesus mentioned about the Trinity.If he did not know then who should know???<br>  Ask yourself what it means in the Bible when it says''The son shall Not Bear The Inequity[sins] of his Father and the father shall not bear the Inequity[sins]of the Son''This throws your theory of atonement of sins and sacrificing life for the sins of others out of the window.The bible here is telling you people in plain and simple english that no one will be punished for the sins of another!Can you imagine a God who is most Kind and Just asking someone one else to die for sins that he did not commit.What is it that makes you believe that God the almighty is unable to forgive sins unless he sheds some ones Blood??/<br>  Do you not find in the Bible jesus[peace be on him]Repeating time and again that he was the SON OF MAN.But you people are insisting he means Son of Giod.<br>  <br>  God almighty Sent many messengers and Prophets during all ages and times.We know some of them by name like Prophet Noah,Prophet Abraham,Prophet David,Solomon,Prophet Muhammad [peace be on them all]Like wise jesus[peace be on him]was one in the chain of Prophets after the advent Of Prophet Moses.<br>  God almighty supported his chosen ones with Miracles which they did by his power to make people believe the message they brought.Now some of these prophets were accepted,some were killed and some were made as gods as in the case of jesus[pbuh]<br>  God in his infinite wisdom tests the faith of a person.The stronger the Faith the stronger the trial.God almighty tested his prophets with pain and suffering and more so.Before jesus[peace be on him[there were many Prophets who were put to death and they Gained Martyerdom the ultimate success for the higer positions in paradise and they willingly accepted these trials from almighty God becaused they knew the rewards that were awaiting them.<br>  According to the bible we find that the affulent of the jews the high priests began to plot to kill jesus,Now God being the all knower the all aware also plotted.When jesus became aware of such a plot he prayed to God Almighty like any human being to take away the pain and suffering that he had to bear and we believe that God the merciful accepted his prayer.<br>  The Holy Quran Says that that those without knowledge know nothing For Surely They did not Crucify nor Killed jesus[peace be upon him}But at some point God Put the likeness of Jesus on another mans face and they crucified that man not Jesus.Jesus was lifted alive up to the heavens to be sent back at some point in time.This is the Truth and if anyone believes otherwise he will be the loser on the day of Judgement.|`|fjidmhxsaa	I'm a bit confused with your question. But let me try... hope i get it right.<br>  <br>  Jesus is the son of God. Why Jesus died for us? The answer is in John 3:16 and John 10:10.<br>  <br>  Jesus is the redeemer. He is the comforter. He is the way truth & life. <br>  <br>  You have to believe in the Son of God for his death to have any impact on you. Something that is not of importance can't have a meaningful hold on you. So if your creed doesn't believe in the Trinity, Death & Resurrection of christ, baptism of the holy spirit, second coming of christ... then Jesus coming to earth is just another story.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps?|`|l2XtZlPUaa	Well, if you read the bible, Jesus knew that it would be his fate to be crucified, his holy big dad told him so in an sms from heaven. IF you read, when jesus went out after the last supper to check his handphone, he received troubling news.<br>  <br>  He also did not struggle and told peter not to fight against the soldiers. He asked some imaginary man to give his strength when he was being whipped too. <br>  <br>  All in all, Jesus Crucifixion was what later immortalized him as a vision for the people, also it was the choice method of execution and lastly, he couldn't have recovered from a beheading and rose to heaven right? <br>  <br>  ** I don't believe in all that stuff about the holy holy crap about cheesus, but still, thats what official records claim.|`|FXoPkZZdaa	Jesus was the sacrificial lamb, offered to the Father in atonement for our sins,  Jesus was the perfect offering because He is divine and the Father was pleased with His sacrifice and accepted His sacrifice for the remission of all men's sins|`|a1603878f94bf716825648ee0a82000faa	I believe the Bible, and it states Jesus died on the cross to save all that believe on him from their sins, and if a person dose not believe that then there would be no good reason for his death on the cross.|`|q2KfJ4JDaa	Common guys... didn't you know "goddidit"?

He died on the cross for our sins, to bear the wrath of God for us, as God cannot let sin go unpunished. So great was His love for us while we were yet sinners, that He came and offered Himself  as the Lamb of God. Since His resurrection and ascension He now sits at the right hand of The Father, making intercession for those who believe in Him, Therefore if we ask with contrite heart and humble in spirit to forgive our trespasses or even bad thoughts  God the Father forgives because we ask it in Jesus name. So our faith is in Christ Jesus the Son of the living God.|`|DuyuUJNDaa	Jesus was not just the son of God - he is God.<br>  For only God can save you from your sin.<br>  The Old Testament repeatedly required a blood sacrifice for sin.

For throwing truth in the face the then current religeous leaders about how far they had stryed from the path of God, just like todays big palyers in politics and religeon you rock the boat you pay for it big time!    As for Jesus dying for out sins it is presumtous to think that someone would die for sins I may of may not commit 2000 years down the line.  And what sins were committed by persons like mother Theresa or all the Catholic Saints?   And another point what happended to all those born and died BEFORE Jesus who never got to "accept him" as thier personal saviour are they in hell or what?  Did they get everlasting life?  Did living a good life before Christianity amount to nothing.  AND everyone seems to forget that no matter what!!  Jesus never denied being a Jew and never neglected or steered his follower away from the Hebrew faith yet not a person today who is a "Christian" is Jewish.  Jewish stories about jewish people and what thier Jewish God and his son did but yet we have chrisitanity a purely non jewish religion.

Once death approaches and you have not repented then a punishment may occur. <br>  <br>  Also, Allah takes the rights of people very seriously than for HIS own.  If you have stolen, cheated, were unkind to your parents, not given different people their due rights, then that would make GOD angry.<br>  <br>  Again, HE is the Most Forgiving, so repenting would repel HIS anger, as saying sorry or making up to your victim would bring peace.<br>  <br>  ALLAH knows best.|`|11b70cab8a6a69fef89e99846ac0cc19aa	Yes.

AA12302854	What do you mean? I am a Catholic and I know I am a Christian. Furthermore, in all the Catholic catechisms ever published, the first question was: "Are you a Christian"?<br>  Incidentally "Catholic" (meaning "universal") was not initially used to define a denomination. In the Apostles'and the Nicene Creed it just means that the Church is not a national one and is open to all people. It was first used in the present sense in the times of St. Augustine, when the Church in North Africa was ravaged by a schism called "Donatism". Then "Catholic" meant "in communion with Rome" as oposed to "Donatist" (in communion with bishop Donatus of Carthage). When further schisms appeared, "Catholic" came to be generally understood as "in communion with the Bishop of Rome".<br>  But the primary reality about Catholics is that they are Christians in that they follow Jesus Christ as his disciples. Some day, Christians will be united again, and then the name Catholic will probably lose its present sense.|`|RNyEQUQDaa	Sad 2 say, most of what Catholics (Cc) practice isnt Biblical so the Cc isnt Christian. I almost became Catholic & found it no better than Protestant churches I grew up with:<br>  <br>  The Bible severely warns us not 2 trust humans, not even ourselves, clergy/churches (Jer 10:2-5,23; Is 2:22; Job 12:11; Prov 14:12; Acts 17:11). So carefully think over what I say. Dont just believe or dismiss what I write. It might save u from making the same mistake many made, getting caught up in religious beliefs that hv nothing 2 do with knowing God (poisoned tree & its fruit).<br>  <br>  Rituals hv no meaning under the NT Covenant. The Hebrew rituals were by instruction of God the best 1 could do under God's Law (None in NT). Other religions (even many Christian) either copied or invented rituals (the best humans could do within the limits of being human). Jesus' perfect sacrifice canceled the need 4 all rituals (doing them calls God a liar as it makes it appear Jesus failed His mission). The closest thing 2 a ritual is Communion but its not 2 b treated as a ritual as its 2 b treated most seriously (not 2 b presented as Jesus' actual body/blood - Cc belief).<br>  <br>  Many dont know the difference btwn a ritual done as a ritual & genuine "remembrance" - not possible without following Jesus' actual Biblical instructions - absent in Cc teachings (the Cc didnt write any part of the NT [not a Cc text - NT was written in the 1rst century by Apostles {NT Gospels/letters preserved the truth 4 all ppl not the Cc}, full Cc possession was not until 3rd century] which contradicts their teachings/practices/God's will, 1 in truth & Spirit not rituals - God allowed them 2 produce the Bible despite their wrong teachings like He allowed the Romans 2 fulfill prophecy without their knowledge [happening again today). A teaching can hv a truth in whats written but the action taken is superficial - The Cc/others, like the Pharisees, know how 2 clean the outside of the cup but dont understand how the inside is 2 be cleaned with respect 2 Jesus' actual message. The fact that the Cc & other religions hv an altar @ the center of their religious practices is 1 sign of their being about rituals not the truth.<br>  <br>  The problem is theres many religions & subset varieties. 1 day I realized they cant all be right (i.e. theres 1 Bible, why so many interpretations? - II Pet 1:**19-21). Most religions came thru ppl who thought up things 4 a God they & others liked. Some realized religion could b good 2 control the masses & 4 other agendas - but, religion cant teach u much about God (they cant teach what they dont know). Who knows more about a house the Builder or he who moves in later?<br>  <br>  4 Christians, the trouble began when the Apostles/disciples were killed off or died during the 1rst century (Christianity was illegal 4 most of that time). Over the next century others, whom either didnt know Jesus or were less informed than Jesus' 1rst generation of believers &/or (un)intentionally added in their own ideas/agendas, replaced the original believers. By the time the Cc religion became a "state - Jn 18:36" recognized, organized religion in Constantine's reign (about AD 325), most of what Jesus taught & original Apostles practiced were no longer present.<br>  <br>  The Cc mixed in things of Pagan religious practices 2 please & draw in ppl, thus, creating a new religion they labeled "Christian/Catholic". The Cc's, like other religions' agendas (some mayve been well-intentioned), was mostly 2 control masses & 2 influence politics (II Tim 2:*4; I Jn 2:*15-17; Col 2:*8; Jer 10:*2-5). The Cc claims they didnt distribute Bibles 4 over a century b/c ppl couldnt read so why didnt they teach ppl 2 read?<br>  <br>  God & Jesus hv never been about pleasing man. In fact, the Cc, RCc & Oc had made religions just like the Pharisees, which Jesus emphatically stated was an abomination b/c they were about pleasing man not God (Mt 23:15; LK 16:15). Even when Protestants/others split off from the Cc they kept the same wrong Cc format.<br>  <br>  Even tho these churches got rid of some of the Cc nonsense they still didnt know much about Jesus (most skipped over Biblical instructions due 2 various agendas) nor did they go 2 the Bible 2 find out all of Jesus' instructions [a huge mistake, as they're fulfilling prophecies against their practices (Amos 8:*11; Jr 12:*10: Is 5:*9 (large houses r churches - Mt 24:*1-2); Hos 4:*6: Mk 7:1-23 (John 3:*3,5 & Ez 36:24-27,*26); Lk 16:**15 (see Rv 21:27; Jr 10:**2-5; Is 1:*11-15)].<br>  <br>  2 Major Cc lies:<br>  <br>  1. The CC claims 2 b the 1rst church & since they r the longest existing church, they r the only "official" church. Jesus' Apostles never named their church catholic (not in the Bible nor in line with God's message that never changes) nor did they ever practice Cc religious rituals. There was nearly a 250 yr gap btwn Jesus' original Apostle's church & the start of the official Cc - there4, the Cc was never a part of or the true 1rst Christian Church (Neither a label, title, name, its history, # of members, amount of time it existed or claims made about them means anything (u can call anything anything). Its whats practiced that makes them either the whole truth or a lie. A dictionary definition doesnt necessarily encompass God's full definition/usage of a word (or His exceptions thereof). I.e. neither Jesus nor the Biblical prophets were ever muslims no matter what Islam's definition application 4 the word muslim is & the Cc's claim of veneration of saints/Mary is a form of idolitry no matter what they claim (calling a dog god doesnt make it God).<br>  <br>  2. Peter was never a pope nor was he/other Apostles ever members of the Cc (not in the Bible = no apostolic succession) the use of the word pope is a Cc invention - the Bible instructs us not 2 go beyond whats written (I Cor 4:6; Rv 22:18-19). Peter was never a bishop of the Cc (he died nearly 250 yrs b4 the Cc became a church). Peter would never call himself a pope or b a member of the Cc b/c calling 1self Father & other Cc teachings r abominations. Even the devil knows Jesus is the Son of God so 1 would b wise not 2 trust any church ahead of whats in the Bible. Calling urself a Christian or saying u believe in Jesus doesnt make it true - recital of words means nothing.<br>  <br>  More wrong Cc things:<br>  <br>  Mass (not in the Bible) is full of non-biblical rituals, Statues (God isnt in2 dead things - non-living things can't help or save any1 - praying 2 them is an abomination), the Rosary & beads, mother Mary (virgin 2 Jesus' birth) as interceder (Jesus is the only way 2 God - not His Apostles/disciples - Jn 14:6; 5:39; 10:1,7; Acts 4:12; IS 1 - Mary was a sinner & had children after Jesus - Mt 12:46-50), candles, incense, the cross (its a symbol of the curse rather than Jesus & 4 the same reasoning against statues), making the sign of the cross, stations of the cross, the pope's & other leader's garb they wear, confirmation, Trinity, the Cc creed & other documents, raising ppl 2 the status of "saint" (only God & Jesus hv such authority), purgatory, catechism, devotionals, sacraments, holy eucharist, penance, traditional/repetative type prayers & other things they do rnt in the Bible - cancels out any truth they know.<br>  <br>  Religion is built on what man likes, not what Jesus told us 2 do 2 know Him. The result is few will b saved thru most of them (u cant save urself by ur own initiative nor will good deeds save u - theres no good in any man - Rom 1:23). 1 must b very careful not 2 get sucked in or going 2 various denominations (especially if u dont hv a good handle on whats actually written in the Bible) as u can only add 2 the confusion.<br>  <br>  Just b/c religions made many fatal mistakes doesnt mean God doesnt know what He's doing. The main point missed: Jesus is the only 1 in history who said that no1 can find our real God except thru Jesus (Jn 14:6; 5:39; 10:1,7; Acts 4:11). This means "the" truth was complete & there4 finished thru what Jesus did. So, any so-called new teaching & other religious beliefs r invalid & cant lead u 2 God. The truth is either the whole truth or its a lie. It cant hv any lie. Either Jesus told the whole truth or He's a false prophet, among many, who should b disregarded. It would also mean God must not exist either (He either knows what He's doing or He cant b God).<br>  <br>  Jesus couldnt hv done nor said what He did unless He fully knew the entire OT (NT didnt exist @ the time of Jesus - the only way Jesus couldve known the whole OT is if God was with Him). & the Apostles couldnt write the NT unless Jesus allowed them 2 remember & know His purpose (Lk 24:25-27,45). Only possible b/c God caused it.<br>  <br>  No matter how much well-meaning ppl (religious or not) read the Bible they cant find Jesus without going 2 Him thru His Biblical instructions (Jn 5:39; 10:1,7; 3:3,5). God outsmarted man - the Bible is the only 1 that cant be properly understood without Jesus (Jn 14:6; II Cor 3:14, Is 29:11-12 - If Jewish ppl cant pierce the veil over the OT without Jesus then 4 sure all gentiles cant). Its why theres many interpretations & many thinking its fairy tales (Jesus came with the sword of division).<br>  <br>  voyc4rmwldrns|`|LSwvB8Xwaa	Some Christians do not like to be clumped up with Cathollics.

I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it; rather, I received it by revelation from Jesus Christ.<br>  <br>  2 Timothy 3:16 tells us that the Bible was "breathed out" by God.<br>  <br>  Galatians 1: 11-12 tells us that the gospel was a revelation from Jesus Christ himself, which was recorded by Jesus disciples and Paul.<br>  <br>  God himself chose the disciples and the people whom He knew were going to spread His word and write the Bible.<br>  <br>  The Bible was written by approximately 40 men of diverse backgrounds over the course of 4000 years. Despite being penned by different authors over 40 centuries, the Bible does not contradict itself and does not contain any errors. The authors all present different perspectives, but they all proclaim the same one true God, and the same one way of salvation—Jesus Christ (John 14:6; Acts 4:12).<br>  <br>  In John 8:58 "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!"<br>  <br>  The above verse speaks a lot about who Jesus really is.<br>  <br>  All about Jesus and the Holy Trinity explained in the below website.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com</a><br>  <br>  Lots of videos, sermons, songs are also present, along with all of Jesus miracles, his parables, and questions on his birth, crucifixion, resurrection are answered.<br>  <br>  Many major questions on Christianity are answered with lot of examples that cannot be denied by anyone, such as,<br>  <br>  1) Did Jesus really exist? Is He God? Why did He suffer on the Cross?<br>  2) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet?

The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,<br>  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)<br>  6.

Medellín puede que sea una linda ciudad, pero están más pendientes de eventos de modas y cirugías estéticas.|`|bqrYmPvpaa	El hecho de que Wikipedia diga eso, no le da nada de merito, ya que esa enciclopedia es construida por diferentes personas, y cualquiera puede dar su opinion. En cuanto a la ciudad, si Medellin  esta bien, es muy bonita y la gente muy cordial, pero eso no quiere decir que sea mejor que Bogota, ya que la capital es mas grande y mucho mas avanzada, aparte tiene mas historia, por algo fue que los espa?oles decidieron que fuera la capital. La mayoria de gente que vive en Bogota, es de otras ciudades, y muchos la odian, sabiendo que esta es la ciudad que les da de comer, y les da el estudio. Por eso es que la gente  de Bogota tiene tan mala fama, por que los de otras ciudades la crean al no tener sentido de pertenencia con esta hermosa ciudad; eso se ve reflejado en que botan basura a la calle, no cuidan las cosas de interes publico, y se la pasan hablando mal de la ciudad. Te dejo esto para que sepas por qué mi Ciudad es <br>  la capital:<br>  <br>  Bogotá, una gran ciudad<br>  <br>  <br>  Bogotá, capital de Colombia, está ubicada en una meseta de la Cordillera Oriental de los Andes, a 2.630 metros de altura sobre el nivel del mar.<br>  <br>  Fundada el 6 de agosto de 1.538, empieza a consolidarse como el centro histórico, económico, político y cultural del país; la mayoría de quienes habitan la capital son de diversos lugares de Colombia y hoy por hoy su censo está por los 7 millones de habitantes.<br>  <br>  Su fundación se desarrolló en el descanso del Zipa en la plaza del Chorro de Quevedo, a su alrededor se constituyó el barrio más reconocido de la ciudad, La Candelaria. <br>  <br>  Esta ciudad limita al occidente con el río Bogotá, al sur con las estribaciones del páramo de Sumapaz y al norte con los terrenos agrícolas de la Sabana.<br>  <br>  Su nombre original fue Bacatá, luego pasó a llamarse Nuestra Se?ora de la Esperanza, cambió nuevamente a Santa Fe, después se llamo Bogotá y finalmente se bautizó con el de Santa Fe de Bogotá Distrito Capital en la Constitución de 1991.  <br>  <br>  El 17 de diciembre Bogotá se constituyó como Distrito Especial y en ese mismo momento se anexaron los municipios de Bosa, Engativá, Fontibón, Suba, Usaquén y Usme.<br>  <br>  Actualmente Bogotá se encuentra divida en 20 localidades que cubren la totalidad de los sectores de la ciudad, cada una de ellas tiene un alcalde local y una junta administradora local.<br>  <br>  A esta capital la rodean los ríos de Arzobispo, San Cristóbal, San Francisco y Tunjuelito y el más importante: el Río Bogotá que nace en el municipio de Villapinzón.<br>  <br>  La temperatura normal de la capital está en los 14° C, pero en el día se pueden presentar cambios de temperatura impredecibles.<br>  <br>  Bogotá además de dividirse en 20 localidades, también se puede dividir en 4 grandes zonas:<br>  <br>  Zona central: se encuentran el barrio La Candelaria y el Centro Internacional, allí se localizan la mayoría de las dependencias político administrativas del país.<br>  Zona norte: en este lugar se desarrolla la actividad financiera y se encuentran  los principales museos, iglesias y edificaciones de interés cultural. <br>  Zona sur: sector obrero e industrial.<br>  Zona occidental: allí se ubican las grandes industrias, parques e instalaciones deportivas y el aeropuerto internacional El Dorado.<br>  Si bien es cierto, que Bogotá es una ciudad de negocios y de política, también es importante resaltar su gestión en el desarrollo cultural.<br>  <br>  Su labor ha sido constante, durante el a?o realiza diversas actividades para fortalecer el ámbito cultural de esta gran ciudad.<br>  <br>  Entre las actividades que se realizan, están los conciertos de ópera, orquestas sinfónicas y conjuntos de cámara nacional e internacionales, que tienen lugar en diferentes escenarios culturales, entre los que se cuentan: <br>  <br>  Teatro Colón.<br>  Teatro Colsubsidio.<br>  El Camarín del Carmen.<br>  Teatro Jorge Eliécer Gaitán<br>  Auditorio León de Greiff, de la Universidad Nacional.<br>  Adicional a los conciertos, cada dos a?os en Semana Santa, se realiza el Festival Iberoamericano de Teatro, que atrae e invita a diversos países del mundo entero.<br>  <br>  La ciudad tiene alrededor de 42 museos, 12 bibliotecas, 36 iglesias  con tesoros coloniales y republicanos, 132 monumentos nacionales, 25 universidades, el centro interactivo más moderno de ciencia y tecnología llamado Maloka, 21 teatros y 20 centros culturales.<br>  <br>  Los eventos realizados durante el a?o van desde la Feria Internacional de Bogotá, en donde se exhiben maquinaria industrial y agrícola y toda clase de productos comerciales, la Feria Internacional del Libro, la Feria Turística de Anato, Expodise?o y Expohogar. Todas estas realizadas en la Corporación de Ferias y Exposiciones (Corferias).<br>  <br>  En este momento Bogotá cuenta con un sistema de transporte masivo, TransMilenio, que le ha permitido a la ciudad una organización mayor en cuanto al transporte público y ha servido de ejemplo a otras ciudades de Colombia.<br>  <br>  Bogotá es una ciudad en crecimiento, con mucha cultura, atractiva para el turismo y albergadora de cualquiera que desee vivir en esta bella ciudad.|`|0a1CXdqRaa	"Lo único que tiene Bogotá es que es más grande"???? sabes algo?? me parece el colmo que hasta aqui nos toque estar leyendo este tipo de comentarios regionalistas tan malucos.

Yo se completamente que Medellin es de mejor proceso, pero mira USA, la capital es Washington pero Los Angeles, Nueva York y Chicago tienen mas progreso que su propia capital. Tambien Canada, su capital es Otawa pero las ciudades que mas se destacan son Vancouver, Toronto, Montreal y Ciudad de Quebec. Asi que Medellin viene siendo una de mejor potencia y muy mejor destacada, pero realmente no descarto que Bogota ha tenido un cambio inmenso...mejor dicho, no digo mas amigo, perdoname si te llegas a ofender...pero creo que Bogota como quiera tambien se ha destacado mucho como capital de Colombia y buenisima pregunta la verdad..porque para serte sincero, me dejaste pensado demaciado...pero si me pusieran a votar, quizas lo haga por Bogota por el momento...saludos amigos y te va la estrella porque a lo mejor hay Colombianos que tambien quieren dar una opinion y la verdad, yo quiero saber que dicen...|`|X8c3nawjaa	Estoy de acuerdo, soy de Pereira pero Medellín me gusta más, su gente es más cordial, es una ciudad más familiar, más sana, más trabajadora, más pujante.

Tiene edificios importantes y representativos, tiene el metro, mejor dicho, Medellín es lo máximo de Colombia. Bogotá es una ciudad maravillosa con mucho éxito y futuro también, es la sede del Ejecutivo en este momento, sede de todos los ministerios, sede del legislativo.

Creo que sería mucho mejor que una de las ciudades más amables de Colombia fuese la ciudad, y si a eso le sumamos todo lo que mencionaste, pues si quedaría perfecta.<br>  <br>  Pero tampoco le quites a Bogotá tanto el merito, que lo único que tiene..no es que sea más grande, recordemos sitios como la quinta de Bolivar, la calera, la candelaria, Monserrate, las Bibliotescas hermosas...como la Virgilio...y más cositas...<br>  <br>  Saluditos..desde Bogotá...n_n

En su concepción de Dios no entra que pueda haber algo bueno fuera de él. Tienes que pensar que cada creyente se forma su Dios de una manera particular y muy personal. Dentro de los ateos también se da el mismo caso y hay muchos que niegan o no quieren ver las bondades y buena fe que tienen algunos creyentes. Creo que se trata más bien de comportamientos personales excluyentes que no tienen que ver con ser creyente o ateo si no con educación o con la necesidad de autoafirmar su creencia (o no creencia) mediante la negación de la otra parte, quizás por dudas en su concepción.|`|4b5a460ea46566009d09379d2b366ce8aa	El pensar que un ateo no es buena persona no depende de que quien lo piense sea o no católico.<br>  Católicos, que se llamen católicos, hay millones, pero que lo practiquen solo unos pocos. Ni yo ni nadie podemos saber cuantos, pero a la vista del comportamiento de la gente que nos rodea me atrevo a afirmar, con seguridad absoluta, lo que he dicho: que católicos de sentimiento son poquísimos.<br>  Por ultimo, el ser o no ser buena persona en modo alguno depende de sus creencias religiosas. Evidentemente, la persona religiosa y creyente, que le gusta seguir las leyes de la iglesia, debería ser buena por obligación. Pero la realidad es la que es y no la que no gustaria que fuese: el que es bueno es bueno, el que es malo es malo, el que es religioso es religioso y el que es ateo o agnóstico es ateo o agnóstico, y cada una de estas características o formas de ver la vida, es indenpendiente de las demás.|`|6d457285915aaf7543deadc62621ec39aa	Soy ateo e paradójicamente muchos católicos me consideran muy linda gente ^.^<br>  <br>  <br>  Pues lo que ah de pasar es que en su cerrada manera de pensar creen que quienes no sigan sus arcáicas normas morales son gente mala <br>  <br>  Ellos piensan que por ateos hacemos exactamente lo contrario a ellos y en cierta forma es cierto pero yo me considero ateo y no por eso voy a estar robando y asesinando gente<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Por desgracia una de las cosas que traen mucho los católicos es que basan todo en fe más que en razon y por eso su forma de pensar es ilógica (como muchas de las cosas que ellos piensan por desgracia)|`|AA10059786	Opinan mal porque reconocen en vos la moral de los se?ores, mientras ellos deben sentirse esclavos y seguir caminos prefabricados para estar bien (y lo desean para los demás).|`|df1da26fae1822e16a08f529cd5530f2aa	Porque la conciencia tribal del humano rechaza a todo aquello que sea diferente de él mismo, lo cual es el principio del racismo:<br>  Los ****** piensan que todos los blancos son malos, los blancos piensan que todos los ****** son malos, los gringos blancos y ****** piensan que todos los latinos son malos, etc. <br>  Los que tienen fe rechazan a quienes no la tienen, los de 2o a?o se pelean con los de 3o y los de "en la ma?ana" con los de "en la tarde".<br>  <br>  En especifico, una persona (cristiana, mahometana o judia) puede tener una vida, sus actos y principios centralizados en una fuerza o ente superior, y no los conceptualiza sin esta Presencia, si no lo analiza, o se deja llevar, puede pensar, por poner un ejemplo: "Yo no robo porque me voy al infierno, esta persona que no cree en el infierno, ?que le impide robar?" <br>  Y no se va a poner a pensar: "pues porque no se debe robar".<br>  <br>  Ademas, en tiempos pasados, habia una corriente filosofica llamada "positivismo" que entre otras cosas, negaba la existencia de un Dios por no poderse comprobar, pero algunas personas sin escrupulos se decian "positivistas" solo como excusa para no dar cuenta de sus actos a ninguna autoridad.

Ni voy a misa todos los domingos, pero sí hablo con Dios , porque creo en él, creo que existe, que me ve y que me oye, desde el fondo de mi corazón, de verdad lo creo. No le rezo porque me lo digan, ni porque sea un mandato de la Biblia, simplemente lo hago porque lo necesito, necesito saber que hay un Padre que me creó y que está ahí para ayudarme. Para serte honesta, siempre me ayudó en todo lo que le pedí. Eso me hace sentir muy bien. Y la verdad que no me agrada la gente que se cree tan omnipotente como para no necesitar nada y mucho menos de Dios. Dios es el mismo para todas las religiones. Y es que alguien nos tiene que haber creado o qué? vinimos en un meteorito? No pueden estar tantos millones equivocados. Pero bueno, cada cual cree lo que quiere.<br>  Por mi experiencia, y a juzgar por lo que ví, en general, la gente atea, tiende a empezar a creer después de haber sufrido algo importante, porque el espíritu solo lo pide, cuando uno está muy mal, en un pozo, empezás a buscar.... a buscar algo que te ayude.. y en general, queridos amigos, ese es Dios. Pero bueno, habrá que esperar el tirón de orejas, no?<br>  A veces me pregunto, y no es por discriminar, ni nada, como será la vida sin creer en nada? Creyendo que solo uno maneja su vida, y que uno solo todo lo puede? Se me hace imposible. <br>  La fé es un sentimiento que es intransferible. Nadie te lo puede contar, ni intercambiar, tenés que sentirlo vos. Justamente es eso de lo que hablaban por ahí arriba. "Creer sin ver". Y es verdad, las cosas de Dios, no son tangibles, pero si yo te contara en todo lo que me ayudó, y que sí pude ver con el tiempo los resultados.... quizás pensarías de otra forma. <br>  Dios no se ve, pero se siente, en el corazón. <br>  De todas formas, no significa que la gente que cree en Dios, le va siempre bien y es exitosa en todo y nunca se enferma ni se muere... nada que ver.. lo que nos tiene que pasar nos va a pasar.. pero sin duda una ayuda extra nunca viene mal. Yo no creo en las casualidades. Y cuando me muera, si Dios quiere me voy a ir a un lugar mejor, a encontrarme con él y con los míos y a ser feliz toda la eternidad... eso creo yo fervientemente. <br>  No hay que juzgar a los demás, cada uno tendrá sus tiempos y sus razones. Lo importante es cultivar el espíritu y no vivir pensando en la boludeces del mundo, que no son mas que cosas superficiales, mundanas y pasajeras. Hay que darle de morfar al alma, eso es lo que importa, y que cada uno lo haga como pueda. <br>  <br>  PD: creo que hay una cosa equivocada en la gente que cree que Dios o la biblia te obligan a.... para darte.... o si no.....<br>  nada de eso.<br>  Dios quiere que lo quieras, lo consideres y le hables. Nada más. Que seas buena persona y que hagas el bien. Y ante todo proclama el amor.<br>  No es eso lo que pensamos todos? Bueno, de eso se trata.<br>  El que elige pensar que la religión se basa en castigos y en pecados, alla él, nunca falta gente que quiera tirar abajo o desvirtuar las cosas. <br>  Mi humilde opinión, besos para todos.|`|ff9edd1f1d6825ab1c0c7cddd9ec45eeaa	Pienso que esto es un tema para tratarlo en profundidad a fin de poder poner los puntos sobre las "íes".

Me explico: Yo fui educado en la religión católica, incluso pasé unos a?os de formación para seguir la vida religiosa en una congregación dedicada a la ense?anza. Pero mi ideología ha ido evolucionando y hoy, aunque conservo cierta parte de las ense?anzas, no sé si puedo seguir incluyéndome en el catolicismo. La vida ha dado muchos tumbos, y lo que ayer era inamovible, hoy no me sirve... y lo que hoy me sirve, me da la impresión de llevarlo prendido con alfileres mientras encuentro algo mejor. ?Quién sabe lo que pensaré ma?ana? Y no se trata de que ande mariposeando de flor en flor, sino de una búsqueda honrada de la verdad a través de mis dudas. Y pienso que posiblemente mis ideas religiosas sigan cambiando, no de forma radical -nunca me ha ocurrido así-, sino de una forma escalonada que a través del tiempo modifica las ideas primigenias de una forma muy amplia.<br>  <br>  Y, hasta aquí, la descripción somera de mi forma de pensar y actuar, con el fin de que sepas quién te está dando una respuesta y por qué.<br>  <br>  Yo, francamente, me adhiero a esa idea, bastante común en las respuestas, del respeto a los demás; del vive y deja vivir; del ayuda en lo que puedas, pero no te erijas en salvador de almas en contra de su voluntad.<br>  <br>  Como ya te han apuntado, gentes buenas y malas las hay en todas las partes y dentro de todas las creencias. Estoy seguro de que tú no crees que todos los musulmanes sean terroristas ni fanáticos.<br>  <br>  Y otro factor muy importante para que la gente piense mal de los demás: la ignorancia, que es lo más atrevido que existe.<br>  <br>  Pero, como ya te han dicho, haz oídos sordos a esos sonidos chirriantes que quieren demonizarte porque afirmas que no crees en Dios. Estás en tu derecho, como también lo estás de cambiar de opinión, si un día lo crees oportuno, sin que nadie te pueda tildar de chaquetera. La vida es una contínua búsqueda y en los recodos de este camino nos encontramos las sorpresas más insospechadas. Es mucho más importante que tú desde tu ateísmo y yo desde mi teísmo podamos comunicarnos, y ayudarnos mutuamente compartiendo los hallazgos obtenidos en nuestra búsqueda.<br>  <br>  Y, para terminar, me gustaría contarte una peque?a anécdota. Quizá te parezca un poco grosera, pero es real como la vida misma. Puede que ya la conozcas, pero, por si acaso, allá va.<br>  <br>  En un programa de TV en el que se presentaban diversos monólogos humorísticos, apareció un día un gran actor, Enrique Sanfrancisco, con un monólogo sobre Dios. En determinado momento se expresó poco más o menos en estos términos:<br>  <br>  "Hoy día no se lleva decir que se cree en Dios. Más bien se habla de una Fuerza Superior, una Energía Total, un Ser Supremo, ese Alguien o Algo que está por encima de todo... pero todo el mundo sigue cagándose en Dios."<br>  <br>  Un afectuoso saludo.|`|4c0faedea365c7f182994311e3654c8baa	Yo pienso lo mismo, el ser buena persona es lo fundamental.

Creo que yo no he rechazado ni mucho menos menospreciado a una persona atea.  Mira tengo mis creencias firmemente confirmadas y se lo que quiero y lo que no.  Se que hay una variedad inmensa de personas y se también que nadie puede cambiar tu modo de penar.   Yo creo en esta religión por opción propia y cree me que nadie me obliga a creer en esto.  Pero si me gustaría que sepas que no por que algunas personas que tu conoces están desgasto contigo quiere decir que todos los católicos seamos así.  No se lo que tu crees y eres libre de elegir lo que decees.  Si tu dices que no le haces da?o a nadie solo tu lo sabes y sabes que hacer o no.  Creo que cada cabeza es un mundo y pues si todos nosotros pensáramos igual, creeme que todo seria felicidad o ya nos hubiéramos matado, no crees?

No es lo mismo religión que espiritualidad. Puedes ser una persona muy espiritual y no religiosa. Como bien dices, se puede ser "buena persona" y no tener ninguna relación con la religión. La espiritualidad es el camino del auto conocimiento, de saber quien eres realmente y no quien crees que eres debido a tu educación. <br>  Todos somos seres espirituales por naturaleza. La religión es una opción (voluntaria). Para sentir y transmitir el amor no se necesita pertenecer a una religión, sencillamente, escucha tu corazón y te darás cuenta de la gran persona que eres y del poder que hay en ti para vivir en la felicidad y el bienestar interior. <br>  La voz del corazón te indicará que debes hacer para tu mayor bien. Cada uno oirá su voz, para su mayor bien y el de todos. <br>  La religión es sólo una serie de dogmas que te dicen como actuar y obrar. Tu corazón, sin embargo te dirá lo mejor para ti, sin coaccionar ni limitar al ser humano, todo al contrario, él te abrirá las puertas de tu potencial espiritual. Lo que te diga será beneficioso para todos. <br>  La religión es parcial, la espiritualidad ilimitada.|`|ca3479eb19627ac72a6cc8892b29ff78aa	En mi caso no necesito de un Dios que me guie ni un cura o pastor que me diga lo que debo hacer, pues mis padres y la vida me han ense?ado los valores de la vida misma y creo ser mejor persona y mas solidario que muchos "religiosos".|`|862481d6cac0fc901c8bb4569cdcd4feaa	Pues porque en este mundo hay variedad de personas para todos los gustos, no solo entre los católicos, sino en cualquier "clasificación" que se te pueda ocurrir (existen también ateos que tienen como "regla general" que los católicos no somos buenas personas).<br>  <br>  Yo, personalmente, soy católico y nunca se me ha pasado por la cabeza decir que los ateos no sean buenas personas. De hecho, tengo buenos amigos que son ateos.<br>  <br>  El hecho de ser católicos (me permito hacer un inciso sobre tu pregunta) no implica que todo lo que hacemos lo hacemos porque "nos lo dicen".

I used to be in a religion like that. I do not feel this way, personally. Honestly they are just like you and me, they just do things a little differently which in the end may not be so bad.|`|AA10547783	Well, it's hard to be specific about Paganism because you could be a Wiccan or a Heathen or just a Pagan...and still be a Pagan.  What I mean is, that there are multiple varieties of Pagan...so you'd have to go on general ideas like nature worship, ritualistic ceremonies, and a base in folklore and mythology, whether proven in archaelogical evidence or not.<br>  <br>  What does it mean to be a Pagan, it means to ME that you haven't whittled your religious preference down enough to be called anything else, such as Wiccan to Celtic Wiccan or Gardenarian Wiccan, etc.  You may not have a specific god or set of gods/deities to worship...  At this point, I'm sure I'm Pagan, but I'm also Wiccan, and I've narrowed things down to where I'm sure I don't follow Gerald Gardner very much in his definition of Wicca, but I haven't made my deities that I pray to very specific in origin, such as a Celtic group of gods or a Greek group of gods, or even a Nordic group of gods...

But when talking to others who like studying history, I use the term "neo-pagan" for modern practitioners of polytheistic religions that are based on pre-Christian beliefs/practices and I reserve the word "pagan" for ancient peoples who practiced their indigenous non-Christian beliefs.

We call ourselves Pagans whether we be of The Lore, Asatru, Wicca, The craft, and many more including individual believers in religious structures. <br>  <br>  The Christians are now frustrated and angry because we have a far more better relationship than Christinity has ever had.

Firstly, the persons who wrote both the OT and the NT were not just wandering, dumb nomads, they all were the educated of their time.  Some things, especially in the OT do seem as if the writers were not thinking far enough ahead at the time of writing, because likely they thought that nobody would ever notice their mistakes.  But the people of those times did believe those stories and just as the NT was written to cause belief in it so that the masses would more easily be controlled, so was the OT also written for control purposes.  Without accepting those foolish stories, belief would have never grown.  It is such a shame that so many people today still believe in those fairy tales and that hurts all people and it causes a slow down in advancement of knowledge.  If Christianity had not been invented, we would now likely have developed five times more knowledge than we now have.  Religion is nothing but lies, and more lies and a hindrance to all people.|`|urlDKYPraa	I think it was taken much more literally when the texts were freshly written. It would have been easy to take it literally then, because it fit their lifestyles so much better.  Today, we no longer raise goats and grow grains for a living.  So we are forced to take it as metaphor and find ways to adapt it to our current life style.<br>  <br>  As the speed of cultural change increases and technology and culture change at today's blinding pace, there will come a time ( maybe already ) that the bible makes no sense at all unless you stretch like metaphorical taffy.<br>  <br>  Naturally that leads to a backlash by some believers (fundamentalists) who would rather go into denial than follow the strained metaphors any further.

In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father that was seen in the OT (John 6:46). Who, then were they seeing? See John 8:58.<br>  22. Jesus claimed the divine name, "I AM", for Himself in John 8:58 see<br>  Exodus 3:14.<br>  23.

I believe that many of the writings in the Bible are cultural anecdotes and parables and are not meant to be taken literally. That's why I don't understand when people put Christianity down by saying that a lot of the things in the Bible may just be stories. Well, yes, some of them may be. But that doesn't mean that those stories don't still contain valuable lessons. <br>  <br>  I think that it's certainly possible that a long time ago people had a better understanding of where these stories were actually coming from. But, also remember, that these were people who took their culture very seriously. So, even if they understood that a lot of these things were parables, that didn't mean that they didn't carry any weight.|`|clgc86Voaa	Well, first off people in Jesus day didn't have a Bible in their hands to begin with. Second, a lot of them were poor and slaves which tells us that they had no knowledge of reading for back then they were only for the rich and powerful. Third, the only thing the people in Jesus day knew were the Laws of the Land, stories passed down by generations, and hymns song by the temples in Jesus day. They actually listened to the prophets and speakers of what they were saying and what their messages were. Sure Jesus did told stories but they were actually very well and thoughtful lessons. I love the parables of Jesus. I mean his stories didn't focus on the details of the place, person, or thing, but on the main moral of the story whether it be to love you neighbor or having a faith like a mustard seed. If you dont agree with the lesson Jesus taught then thats fine with me but MLK and Gandhi followed His teachings and proved that they were actually real and true. Hard to argue with them.|`|7d49ddbf3b36edeb5a77c20235621a44aa	The Bible wasn't yet written in the time of Jesus. and the more well educated don't take it as literal very often but as applicable to the spirit.

The same law is at work when a particular entity communicates with you. Because you have sent out a thought which vibrates in unison with it, a connection is established between you and this entity to which your thought has attached itself. Well then, people who have negative and chaotic thoughts shouldn't be surprised when they have unfortunate encounters with the invisible world. They have simply contacted entities which correspond to these thoughts. Now you understand why it is important to hold a divine idea in your mind: it will magically attract all the beings and elements that will contribute to its realization. This divine idea in your mind is like a notice announcing to the spirits of darkness: busy, not at home, beware of the dog, and they dare not enter. To all luminous spirits, however, it is an open invitation."         <br>  Omraam Mikhal Avanhov

The biggest problem with all of your guessing about your Jesus is because he is not real and you can't grasp that fact.

Whoever shall faithfully serve me by the recitation of the Rosary shall receive signal graces.<br>  2. I promise my special protection and the greatest graces to all those who shall recite the Rosary.<br>  3. The Rosary shall be a powerful armor against Hell, it will destroy vice, decrease sin, and defeat heresies.<br>  4. It will cause virtue and good works to flourish; it will obtain for souls the abundant mercy of God; it will withdraw the hearts of men from the love of the world and its vanities and will lift them to the desire of eternal things. Oh, that souls would sanctify themselves by this means.<br>  5. The soul which recommends itself to me by the recitation of the Rosary, shall not perish.<br>  6. Whoever shall recite the Rosary devoutly, applying himself to the consideration of its sacred mysteries, shall never be conquered by misfortune. God will not chastise him in His justice, he shall not perish by an unprovided death; if he be just, he shall remain in the grace of God and become worthy of eternal life.<br>  7. Whoever shall have a true devotion for the Rosary shall not die without the Sacraments of the Church.<br>  8. Those who are faithful to recite the Rosary shall have during their life and at their death the light of God and the plenitude of His graces; at the moment of death, they shall participate in the merits of the saints in Paradise.<br>  9. I shall deliver from Purgatory those who have been devoted to the Rosary.<br>  10. The faithful children of the Rosary shall merit a high degree of glory in Heaven.<br>  11. You shall obtain all you ask of me by the recitation of the Rosary.<br>  12. All those who propagate the Holy Rosary shall be aided by me in their necessities.<br>  13. I have obtained from my Divine Son that all the advocates of the Rosary shall have for intercessors the entire Celestial Court during their life and at the hour of death.<br>  14. All who recite the Rosary are my sons, and brothers of my only Son, Jesus Christ.<br>  15. Devotion to my Rosary is a great sign of predestination.<br>  <br>  Our Lady has 117 titles.

NwXnzARwaa	First, you should visit a gay bar to see if you would like to apply for the gay position.<br>  <br>  If you feel you would be comfortable in a certain position you can apply directly to another gay person, but make sure to check the boxes of either top, bottom, or versatile on the application. Once offered a position, you will be given your own personal copy of the gay agenda (which is suitable for framing).<br>  <br>  Once you have achieved the position of gay, you can apply to become super gay. The position of super gay will require taking a test that includes knowing the meaning of at least 5 of the 6 colors of the rainbow flag, knowing how to explain to uneducated people that being gay is not a choice, as well as at least 3 personal references that can verify your participation in a gay pride event (musical performances by Elton John, Cher, Madonna, or Bette Midler are not currently recognized, although Clay Aiken has applied to have his performances accredited).|`|0121db3d89fa7258a5d230763048afc9aa	*prances into the room* <---that right there was enough to make anyone gay.<br>  <br>  Gymmy!!!

e4ffd05d5175695c64fc913b628c28a3aa	hi,<br>  <br>  Yes, Indians are learning a lot from the foreigners, the reason our lives are turning miserable and the "culture" is being pushed into the toilet.<br>  <br>  Once upon a time these guys came to India to learn the culture, to follow their education, medicine, trade system and many more.  <br>  <br>  We're so unfortunate we've learnt from them to use tissue paper instead of water to clean our asses.<br>  We've learnt to party in the late nights throwing the tradition into the dustbins.<br>  We've learnt to wear clothes that make us look like monkeys and not humans.<br>  We've learnt to use deodourants instead of taking a fresh bath in the morning and in the evening.<br>  We've learnt from most of them to disobey, threaten and abandon our elders once we've earnt our flaps to fly.<br>  <br>  What more do do you want Indians to learn from them ??<br>  Yes, Brits have given us penal code, railways, roads and some civilization.

Perhaps you should remove the question, do some research, get your facts straight, and then perhaps consider reposting. You clearly are not hear to ask a question, you just want to debate.  You cannot debate with someone who has no knowledge of the other side.  You are going off of what you think you know rather then researching and finding out the facts.  Sorry, but your "facts" are wrong.|`|AQPmrsVSaa	Christians believe Jesus is an incarnation of God, so many pray to him.<br>  <br>  Catholics believe that they can ask Mary and the Saints to pray to God for them - they do not worship them nor do they expect them to intervene in their lives.<br>  <br>  All symbols of Christianity are not worshipped, they are merely used to represent ideas related to the faith.|`|srUuoCwcaa	First of all, not all Christians pray to the saints, and none pray TO crucifixes, icons, etc., in the sense of addressing the image itself.<br>  <br>  All Christians pray to Christ, as it is a fundamental part of Christian belief that Christ is truly God Incarnate, the Second Person of the Trinity (belief in the Trinity is likewise a fundamental tenet of the Christian religion--that is, belief in one God in Three distinct Persons). The Holy Spirit is viewed as the third Member of the Trinity, and thus as truly God, and so naturally Christians pray to him as well.<br>  <br>  Now, some (Catholics, Orthodox, and a few Protestant groups including some Anglicans and Episcopalians) DO pray to saints. They do not worship them but, rather, venerate or honor them as exemplary figures and guides. And since Christians believe Christ is divine, the logical conclusion that follows is that his mother is to be revered for her unique position in bringing the Son of God into the world. (And no, God did not have any "romantic" encounter with the Blessed Virgin, if that is what your question implies; she was chosen to be the Theotokos, the "God-bearer.") By virtue of their sanctity, saints are trusted as reliable intercessors and intermediaries for us here on earth. We pray to them, ask them to pray for us, because they stand in the very presence of God and the Church can never truly be divided.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps.|`|F9UToz4aaa	I pray to God and only God...If you read your history book, you would know that Christians don't pray to all of those things...|`|N8QLKpCMaa	So you are asking them why they follow Christianity !<br>  <br>  you could ask one expect to define & elaborate !|`|JXMpZiwxaa	We consider Jesus to be God.  We pray to Mary because she is the perfect creature, and can pray to God more effectively than we can ourselves.  Other saints can help too, but they are not nearly as powerful as Mary. Catholics use the term "pray" to mean "talk," rather than "worship."<br>  <br>  The rosary is explained here:<br>  <a href="http://www.ewtn.com/Devotionals/prayers/rosary/how_to.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.ewtn.com/Devotionals/prayers/...</a><br>  <br>  The fifteen promises of Mary to Christians who recite the rosary:<br>  1. Whoever shall faithfully serve me by the recitation of the Rosary shall receive signal graces.<br>  2. I promise my special protection and the greatest graces to all those who shall recite the Rosary.<br>  3. The Rosary shall be a powerful armor against Hell, it will destroy vice, decrease sin, and defeat heresies.<br>  4. It will cause virtue and good works to flourish; it will obtain for souls the abundant mercy of God; it will withdraw the hearts of men from the love of the world and its vanities and will lift them to the desire of eternal things. Oh, that souls would sanctify themselves by this means.<br>  5. The soul which recommends itself to me by the recitation of the Rosary, shall not perish.<br>  6. Whoever shall recite the Rosary devoutly, applying himself to the consideration of its sacred mysteries, shall never be conquered by misfortune. God will not chastise him in His justice, he shall not perish by an unprovided death; if he be just, he shall remain in the grace of God and become worthy of eternal life.<br>  7. Whoever shall have a true devotion for the Rosary shall not die without the Sacraments of the Church.<br>  8. Those who are faithful to recite the Rosary shall have during their life and at their death the light of God and the plenitude of His graces; at the moment of death, they shall participate in the merits of the saints in Paradise.<br>  9. I shall deliver from Purgatory those who have been devoted to the Rosary.<br>  10. The faithful children of the Rosary shall merit a high degree of glory in Heaven.<br>  11. You shall obtain all you ask of me by the recitation of the Rosary.<br>  12. All those who propagate the Holy Rosary shall be aided by me in their necessities.<br>  13. I have obtained from my Divine Son that all the advocates of the Rosary shall have for intercessors the entire Celestial Court during their life and at the hour of death.<br>  14. All who recite the Rosary are my sons, and brothers of my only Son, Jesus Christ.<br>  15. Devotion to my Rosary is a great sign of predestination.<br>  <br>  Our Lady has 117 titles.

eIQ5T2amaa	I live in America, so that is the only place I'm describing in this answer. Slavery used to be the face of America. It was the black spot (stupid pun not intended) on America's clean slate. Back then, whites acted superior to blacks, and treated them very badly. I won't deny any of that, but, guess what, "back then" isn't now. Why can't people get over this stuff. It's just like you said, there are no slaves now, and I've certainly never owned a slave. I don't consider myself superior to any other race, but I will not act inferior just because my ancestors made them mad. Ya, I just said it. Some black people don't want equality. They want slavery all over again, but with the roles reversed. They want to be superior to white people. Should we become inferior to meet their wishes? Hell no! I don't care if I offend someone, I'm not going to consider myself lower than a person of any other race. The weird thing is this: I'm fairly young (18), so I really haven't seen any discrimination. I don't ever consider color of skin, really. I see people, I don't see black peole, white people, Indians, and asians. In fact, the only time I think of all this stupid racism is when some idiot racist brings it up. Why can't people get over the past, that's a good question. I think the answer is that they don't want to get over the past, they want to be able to pull out the history book any time something bad happens.|`|GTuoRorFaa	This is a derogatory term used by black people to describe white people. There are others they use also, like cracker (IDK if they mean soda or graham) and an oldie like honkey. I find all of these quite amusing and not at all insulting.

My younger sister killed herself after 3 attempts. I have seen psychologist on a few occasions and suggest my siblings do the same for various reasons.

That's like these people who say they hate an entire race because a few people from that race mistreated them.<br>  <br>  If you continue to be bitter and hate everyone then you've let those people win and it makes you look weak. If you overcome  your bad childhood and suceed in life despite what was done to you, then you win. <br>  <br>  I think a successful life is the best revenge of all.|`|eIQ5T2amaa	Man, I'm sorry about the cards you were dealt. You've had a pretty bad life. My parents actually work at a Children's home, and I know of kids/teens that have experienced similar situations. Still, you can't hate everyone in the world. Every one in the world didn't treat you badly and there are a lot of good people in the world. I've seen several of your answers that said something about how horrible America is. I do not agree with these statements, but I now understand why you feel that way. Here's some encouragement, though: America is the only country in the world where you can rise from being a foster kid to being a successful business men. Americas colleges readily welcome people like you, and they bring you up, treat you as an equal, and set you on a path for success. I'm really sorry about what has happened to you, I am. But, you must move on. Forgot the people who treated you badly. Forget the places you used to live, the places you used to go. Forget the things you used to do. That is the greatest thing about America: You can start over. Look to the future with optimism, because you can succeed. In America, anyone who wants to can succeed. I know it sounds corny and you've probably heard it before, but you have to move on and forget the past. Because, to be honest, your past is not something you want to remember. Good luck and I hope you find your place in the world. The world is a good place, but it has some bad people in it. It seems that you've mostly seen the bad parts, but trust me when I say there are more good people than bad.|`|vejBlTO5aa	I'm so sorry for how your life has gone so far. If it was me, I would get as far away from your family as possible (doesn't sound like their doing you much good), and then I'd start over from scratch. Sounds good huh? But the problem is it can't be done unless you cut the anchor from the boat. And the anchor that will keep you forever in this mess is the unforgiveness you have toward your family. And yes, you have every right to that bitterness and hate. You sure do, but even so, it IS the anchor that will keep you forever tied to your pain and your past. So don't do it for them. They don't deserve it at all. Do it for YOU. Because without it, you will never find healing. I'm sorry for my answer. I'm sure its not what you wanted to hear. But wouldn't it be cool if you could get that stinkin boat finally out to sea and find a new life?|`|62364eb8ec72973c388641049ba83389aa	The people who did this to you would be all currently in prison in my country. Also you would have never gone hungry or bashed or terrorized verbally abused like you were, or shipped off place to place if you grew up in Australia.  <br>  <br>  You have to remember what these people did to you was totally wrong and they were nothing more than criminals. All of what they did to you was never your fault. You have remained strong, and why would you want to hurt the person who remained strong to look out for you, which is you.<br>  <br>  What was done to you can never be forgiven only you can change this from happening to you again. By remaining strong and showing these bastards, your stronger than them. Telling them, one day they will be frail and weak and you'll be the one who is in charge giving out their punishment for years of abuse. By placing them into the most crappiest nursing homes you could ever find. <br>  <br>  Remember let yourself be the one to piss on their graves and never let them ever piss on yours.
PRzmwFfgaa	I understand what you mean.  It is just as bad as some of the racist comments that I see on here.  People judge an entire group of people based on a title and it is sad.  I am Christian and have some friends who are atheists (as well as friends who are Muslim, Buddhist, Catholic, Jewish, etc.)  We are all civilized adults and from time to time get into healthy and normal debates about religion.  I have no problem with debating a topic, however, on here, people have a tendency to go beyond debating and just take it upon themselves to slam and insult an entire group of people.  And usually, people who make comments like this are completely incorrect in their assumptions.  Take for instance, Chance who has already commented on this question.  What religion does he believe is praying for the world to come to an end?  I am curious to find out who he thinks does that?  But someone has clearly fed this false knowledge into his head so now he feels as though it is okay to disrespect an entire group of people.  Fortunately, their are people, including myself, who do not assume that everyone atheist is walking around in blind ignorance and making statements like the ones Chance has made.  Therefore, I will not link an entire group of people to that statement.  Unfortunately, everyone on yahoo answers does not have that capability to know when they are making prejudiced remarks.|`|hMR0aVVAaa	yeah, i agree with that...i'm a catholic myself and i love other people who deserves to be loved, uhm deserve is not the right word, but more of like those who are willing to accept love no matter what kind of people they are. You can never achieve anything by forcing your belief on others. We tend to get rebellious more if forced. People have to find for themselves what they would like to believe in.

Why do we have to divide and divide and divide people into are groups and boxes and think that what the person believes in will decide whether they are reasonable or ignorant.

You need to study a little about all of the hostility brought on by your own religion, Christianity.  BTW, you also know really nothing about Christianity when you say that Catholicism is not Christianity (you really said that Catholics are not Christians).  Are you really comfortable being so uninformed about what you believe in?  The religion known as Christianity was originally invented as the Roman Catholic Church, and it started in Turkey, not Judea. The Romans made it in entirety.|`|JOankL0eaa	You can believe whatever you want as long as that belief doesn't affect the lives of other people. And unfortunately, Christians try to push their beliefs on other people; through   laws or prohibitions. Once your beliefs start affecting the way of life of other people, and result in intolerance and hatred of other people..then your beliefs become my business and someone needs to stand up and question what you are doing, and tell you that you are wrong. <br>  <br>  If I can protest against  racism, a belief, why can't I protest against your religious belief, also belief. Why should  religious beliefs be on a pedestal? Are they better than other beliefs? Untouchable just because it hurts your feelings?|`|pGf4mIw9aa	I would love you as a friend.

The true things that do add, well they do add when you add them together which adds the truth once of what you are adding the truth three times two. That is why that some truths that appear to be false minus six because of the truths four times squired are inherent in the false truths that use pi which is squired. That means there are no truths false of the left of truth, then they to, do point to the right of truths too become true. Hope I helped.|`|MM5iGrnIaa	You're probably doing the math wrong.

oVhKGw3Maa	What has having pre-nuptial sex relations and being a Christian have in common?in my opinion nothing.Lets get one thing absolutely clear. Most of the rules of being a Christian are "man made", and before the feminists amongst us start on me, I use the term generically, they have little to do with the teachings of Jesus. I have never been able to find where in the teachings of Jesus does it say to refrain from sex prior to marriage. The whole business of marriage is a device to control people. Apart from breathing, I would argue that sexual contact is the next strongest act and desire of humankind. So it is obvious that if we are to have any kind of cohesion in our society, we must be able to prevent people going off in all directions having sexual contact with each other. Human nature being what it is, if we did not have some way of controlling people, we would be spending all of our time fighting off sexual predators even more than we do now. So how to do that?, why dont we invent "marriage" in that way you will have your partner and all will be well in society sex-wise. If only!!<br>  But your question is can you be a good Christian and have sex before marriage? I suggest that you can.I am trying to draw the distinction between being a Christian and a "church goer". At the risk of bringing your scorn upon me, I suggest that they are two different people. There are millions of people going to church of all denominations, and would not recognize a Christian act if it bit them on the nose. I am talking of helping the poor, helping the sick, feeding the hungry, making sure that homeless people have a roof over their heads and all the other things that Jesus implored us to do for our fellow man. He did not say build edifices that suck up the money of poor people to keep them going, he did not say for clergy to go about in clothing that would cost the national output of a third world country, nor did he say for the so-called princes of the Church to live palaces and magnificent house. Neither did he say refrain from sexual contact before marriage. All of these things are man made churchmen inventions. Now you can ask, should we be having sex as a recreational act. I suppose you have to ask that of Jesus father God, after all he created us in his image and in doing so instilled all of our acts and beliefs,good or bad, in us. He did give us a very important virtue, conscience.So you will know if you are doing good or evil in this matter.|`|srUuoCwcaa	Yes.<br>  <br>  Christianity--and in particular my own Catholic religion--doesn't encourage it because sex is best within the confines of a committed relationship, with two people who truly love one another, etc., and outside of marriage, the level of commitment admittedly wavers.<br>  <br>  Even so, there are many responsible individuals who are madly, deeply in love and do so within the confines of a committed relationship. I personally do not see how this fails to conform to Christianity's ideal.<br>  <br>  Even so, I am also of the opinion that, while serious, abiding relationships are certainly a wonderful context for sexual intimacy and expression, the whole act loses some of its meaning, its multidimensionality, when all frivolity is automatically excluded. A healthy view of sex includes both aspects.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|EbF8WUvUaa	Sex outside of marriage is condemned. <br>  <br>  God is not against sex. Duh, it was HE who created sex. <br>  <br>  1Cr 6:9 Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind.<br>  <br>  Hebrews 13:4<br>  Marriage should be honored by all, and the marriage bed kept pure, for God will judge the adulterer and all the sexually immoral.<br>  <br>  <br>  Yes, God forgives , but still do not do something you know is wrong. Common sense here. If he says EXPLICITLY not to do it.. then why would you blatantly disregard his Word?|`|uIZDd3y5aa	well you could, but it considered a sin.<br>  if you already have done it, all you can do is ask God for forgiveness, and he forgives everyone.|`|5LR1RZelaa	Possible?

It might be also why people were largely illiterate for a few thousand years in the Christian world.|`|5wvg0sLLaa	yea i know so many people who still do those things before they ever get married.<br>  christianity does have rules i guess you could say but god will always forgive you if you ask for it, the main thing about being christian is just believing in god and that jesus is our savior annnd the he died on the cross for you....|`|gWu693giaa	Yes it is possible.<br>  <br>  As long as you believe that Jesus is the Son Of God you are a Christian.

No matter what you do,if you believe that Christ died for our sins,you are a Christian.<br>  <br>  Nobody can tell you that you're not a Christian, as long as you believe.|`|AA10397522	Yes.  If you want to have sex do it.  Don't do it in the back of pick up truck cuz you got wasted at a party tho.  Make it worth something, but dont worry its not as big of a deal as everyone makes it out to be.  Your first time u will remember forever tho so...|`|upXeWQMOaa	to make the mistake?? well of course... "all have sinned and fall short to the glory of God" He will forgive. but to continue to sin is going against his word and will make your relationship (with Christ) grow weak instead of stronger|`|euXK0VrZaa	Anything is possible no matter what religion ur in.<br>  <br>  okay you're a christian and you have sex before marriage....go confess and you'll be forgiven the end!|`|mQg5SVQXaa	Yes, you are still a Christian but if having sex before marriage upsets you so much, maybe you should rethink that decision and pray about it.|`|eGSIXIsFaa	If not, then Sarah Palin's daughter isn't a good Christian like Palin claims that her whole family is.|`|pHkJ9Yb3aa	As long as it doesn't interefere with the ceremony!|`|CjWdxAJaaa	would depenend on how devout you are to your beleifs, decission would be yours and yours alone.|`|6jcEtPPKaa	Yes, but you're going against your religion.

God, more than anyone, knows that humans are weak and don't always live up to the standards of their faith.  If your religion or faith forbids it, premarital sex is a sin.  But I come from a family of devout Christians where it's pretty common for a couple that's been married six months to celebrate the birth of a 10-pound preemie.  All it means is two people who are in love gave in to impulses that have tempted people since the beginning of time.  It's a sin, but it's not the end of the world.  If people weren't inclined to act on their weaknesses, Christ died on the cross for absolutely nothing.|`|AA11765949	Of course it's possible, do you seriously believe that all Christians are virgins when they marry. I can tell you that many are not and some are in fact pregnant before they get married. Christians are normal human beings they are not flawless.|`|UcgWrGaAaa	Sure, but the consequences are the same.  Jesus forgives but he won't take away the consequenses. Such as STDs, pregnancy, broken heart.<br>  <br>  Sex is not a toy.|`|SiPGcBnYaa	well sure it's POSSIBLE|`|m2PlMByKaa	yeah, i think so... nobody is perfect.

And so are bad relationships, promiscuity, drugs, alcohol, making excuses, spending money to fix problems instead of dealing with them, enforcing elitism to make yourself feel better than others, cheating, lying, working out excessively,  eating excessively, spoiling children, playing hours of video games a day, watching way too much tv, being on 2nd Life, being a douchebag, being depressed and sleeping all day, being on pills for being depressed and sleeping all day....<br>  <br>  <br>  shi*.....I'd take some voodoo and faith any day over all that crap.|`|hiCSVwchaa	Have these people never heard of alcohol?!|`|7d49ddbf3b36edeb5a77c20235621a44aa	it has been called a crutch and a comfort but I believe there are other ways of coping with brutal truth of life besides myth.|`|4OLpe1Ylaa	Some people, you perhaps, have had a cushy life. Others who have lost a child or suffer from terrible illness, realize that life is not only short but for some very difficult.

I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it; rather, I received it by revelation from Jesus Christ.<br>  <br>  2 Timothy 3:16 tells us that the Bible was "breathed out" by God.<br>  <br>  Galatians 1: 11-12 tells us that the gospel was a revelation from Jesus Christ himself, which was recorded by Jesus disciples and Paul.<br>  <br>  God himself chose the disciples and the people whom He knew were going to spread His word and write the Bible.<br>  <br>  The Bible was written by approximately 40 men of diverse backgrounds over the course of 4000 years. Despite being penned by different authors over 40 centuries, the Bible does not contradict itself and does not contain any errors. The authors all present different perspectives, but they all proclaim the same one true God, and the same one way of salvation—Jesus Christ (John 14:6; Acts 4:12).<br>  <br>  In John 8:58 "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!"<br>  <br>  The above verse speaks a lot about who Jesus really is.<br>  <br>  All about Jesus and the Holy Trinity explained in the below website.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com</a><br>  <br>  Lots of videos, sermons, songs are also present, along with all of Jesus miracles, his parables, and questions on his birth, crucifixion, resurrection are answered.<br>  <br>  Many major questions on Christianity are answered with lot of examples that cannot be denied by anyone, such as,<br>  <br>  1) Did Jesus really exist? Is He God? Why did He suffer on the Cross?<br>  2) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet?

Jesus is God in Heb. 1:8<br>  3. John the apostle states that Jesus was the Word which was God that became<br>  flesh (John 1:1-14)<br>  4. The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm<br>  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh<br>  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,<br>  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)<br>  6. Jesus said that He and the Father are One (John 10:30), that caused the Pharisees to<br>  claim that Jesus was making Himself out to be God.<br>  7. Jesus knew all things (John 21:17)<br>  8. Jesus knew all men (John 16:30)<br>  9. Jesus is everywhere (Matt. 28:20)<br>  10. Jesus Christ, dwells in you (Col. 1:27)<br>  11.

In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father that was seen in the OT (John 6:46). Who, then were they seeing? See John 8:58.<br>  22. Jesus claimed the divine name, "I AM", for Himself in John 8:58 see<br>  Exodus 3:14.<br>  23.

vs5rK3iRaa	YOU are a saint!  <br>  I agree wholeheartedly with every syllable you just wrote.  I, for one am dismayed and ashamed for those people you mentioned, especially when, upon being corrected, they reply that they have the RIGHT to spell any way they please.  Ignorant punks!<br>  I saw a bumper sticker that said, "If you can read this, thank a teacher."  It might have read, "If u be reedin dis, tank a techur."<br>  I read a question here in the last week that said, "How can I leason (sic) to my I-pod in class?"  I answered that perhaps he should "leason" to his teacher instead, and learn how to "spel".  It just infuriates me, especially when there is a default SPELL CHECKER just over there on the right!|`|onkUcy19aa	Strange but true. I agree with you! And thanks for making such an interesting rant, as you said. The truth: I really enjoyed reading your short piece. We need more of it or rather I need more of it. Anyway, good luck to you and God bless.|`|B4wody2Kaa	You get a star from me. I agree and until you said you were 17, I thought you were much older since those types of things bother mainly old people like me.<br>  #5 I would give the guy a break though, maybe he never learned to type, I'm sure he would rather be typing fast than hunting and pecking, but then again, I don't type so fast and constantly have to fix my errors, go figure. I'm just not good at using this keyboard for some reason.<br>  <br>  I hopes u kool wit dat!|`|JX0I6x1paa	You are so right and it pleases me to know you are 17 and concerned.  <br>  <br>  My pet hate is the inability of people to write contractions.  I see 'your' instead of 'you're' so often these days it amazes me.  It infuriates me when I see it in advertising (which is bad enough) but the worst example I've seen was in a birthday card!  Then, of course, we have 'their' instead of 'there' or 'they're'.<br>  <br>  My other pet hate is the use of the expression 'youse'!!!!  For heaven sake!  The plural of you is YOU!  Need I go on...?<br>  <br>  I'd also love someone to explain to me the emerging trend to confuse the words 'weary' with 'wary' and 'then' with 'than'.  For example, "I am weary of using that lift, it broke down yesterday" and she was older then her sister".  What?  How on earth can you confuse those meanings and usages?  It drives me insane.<br>  <br>  How can we expect our young people to know how to construct a sentence when their teachers don't have a good command of their own language?  Today's teachers come from a generation who were not taught to spell, use punctuation or construct a sentence and yet they are given the responsibility of teaching future generations.  They are ill-equipped for the task yet education departments seem unwilling to do anything about it.<br>  <br>  Parents, higher education authorities and employers have been calling for change for decades with no response.  It's time for change but who will make that change?  <br>  <br>  Sadly I don't have the answer.  I wish I did.|`|pxdEpIZAaa	I think everyone is just getting lazier over time. not just with language, but EVERYTHING. think about it. we are living in an Instamatic society. everything has to be done as quick as possible with as little effort as possible.

This is written by my dear cousin on facebook. I had to spend quite a while to decode all of her abbreviations!<br>  <br>  Grammar mistakes, I may be able to forgive, but there's absolutely NO reason to have spelling mistakes. We have SPELL check, honestly! <br>  <br>  However, it's not only us who's guilty of linguistic errors...some adults surprise me with their usage of language. Just the other day, I was reading a post which was strewn with horrible syntax and incorrect placements of punctuation. <br>  <br>  *sigh* Well, at least there's somebody out there who cares for the English language. :]|`|9a5a35a0de0e98fc945b24c9e9935e91aa	In my opinion, chatting, IM-ing and texting have become main stream methods of communication. Adolescents have become so comfortable with their quick modes of communication & language that they don't think they are wrong when it comes to learning and understanding the proper use of our language. <br>  This generation, I have labeled the "entitlement' generation" They want all of the rewards without putting forth any of the work. When in fact just the opposite will be true for them. They will have to work twice as hard as our generation for half as much. This age of young adults aren't concerned with specifics and details. They want to just 'show up' and recieve what they feel is owed to them. <br>  I am working hard to try to raise my kids properly..ie be responsible for your own actions, treat others the way you want to be treated and take care of yourself. I refuse to allow my kids to always blame others for their mistakes. However, I see this problem trickling down into the upper elementary school levels ie 3rd & 4th grades. <br>  I loathe for the future!!! <br>  <br>  and It's NOT the schools' problem to fix, nor is it the schools job to fix...It's the responsibility of the parents to raise their children.

qaA8U4xCaa	No. There should be a strong reason you believe what you do. <br>  The bible itself tells us at 2 Corinthians 13:5 ?'Keep testing whether you are in the faith, keep proving what you yourselves are.'<br>  <br>  Jesus himself, when he was a boy asked questions of the teachers at the temple. Luke 2:46,47 <br>  'Well, after three days they found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the teachers and listening to them and questioning them. 47?But all those listening to him were in constant amazement at his understanding and his answers.'<br>  <br>  Romans 12:2 2?'And quit being fashioned after this system of things, but be transformed by making your mind over, that you may prove to yourselves the good and acceptable and perfect will of God.'<br>  <br>  So, really we can see the need to know whether our beliefs are in harmony with Gods will and whether our form of worship is acceptable to him. So yes, prove to yourself, that what you believe in is true.|`|1f57b43a72ebc542b4835ebc4c5f5fbfaa	I don't think it's sinful since the decision to change religions is a matter of personal option and should, as much as possible. It should not be brought upon by from external influences and pressures and instead be based on actual sound judgment and an evaluation of one's beliefs, along with a firm resolve to make the change. <br>  <br>  I guess that as long as it is not damaging to both one's self and others, and if it is a healthy curiosity, it is normal to raise questions about one's faith, especially if one is born into that faith.<br>  <br>  I personally admit that I rarely do question my own faith for fear of losing it, as well as for other reasons. Different groups in my specific Church have differing stances on questioning the faith. Some encourage free and independent thought while others severely restrict it.|`|OxFgAg6Kaa	Of course it's not wrong or sinful.

Most of them say questioning faith is natural and God doesn't react punitively to it, however, when you speak with the born agains, they will inform you that questioning faith dilutes a Christians ability to perform miracles.  So for them, even though they deny it, questioning faith is punished by God.|`|r1k8lUVbaa	they certainly go on a lot about the importance of 'faith', which is unquestioning belief.

It doesn't sound like they questioned whether there was truth in what they heard but as Paul said they searched the scriptures ..basically to verify what was told them..So in all honesty..It is very necessary know the sciptures thereby if any man should come with a false doctrine...something that is questionable you would be able to prove that it is false based on the written word..which is the final authority ..Jesus instructed his followers..of this in Matthew 24 <br>  Mt 24:4 And Jesus answered and said unto them, Take heed that no man deceive you. ..The word has to be in your heart otherwise any could come with a false word and deceive you ..knowledge is power..the power to believe in Gods word without doubt...especially when it becomes alive to you..Bottom line it is not sin to study and know the word so that you would not be deceived..Yet everything must be done in decency and order<br>  <br>  And to all those who say "we were told not to questions our faith" I don't know where you get that from but let me show you one last scripture and hopefully your jaded minds will open ..Malachi 3:10 Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be meat in mine house, and prove me now herewith, saith the LORD of hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it. ...God is saying here TRY ME...doubters try me..skeptics try me...if you have any questions TRY ME...I will prove you..I will show you ..Open your heart and try the God of all creation..He will never let you down..<br>  <br>  Applauds Raychel Loudly..|`|bb06GQ5Paa	No matter what I've read or understood to be the truth in the past, it still does not detract from who God is to me.

vmhPRQa7aa	I was thinking about this, too. Check this out in Hosea 4:6 <br>  <br>  "my people are destroyed from lack of knowledge. Because you have rejected knowledge, I also reject you as my priests; because you have ignored the law of your God, I also will ignore your children"<br>  <br>  This verse specifically says that believing and trying to do the right thing are not enough, we have to know what's right and wrong, we have to study our Bibles.<br>  <br>  There's more: John 8:31 "To the Jews who had believed him, Jesus said, 'If you HOLD TO MY TEACHING, you are really my disciples...' " (So it's not enough just to believe)<br>  <br>  Revelation 3:5 "He who overcomes will, like them, be dressed in white. I will never blot out his name from the book of life, but will acknowledge his name before my Father and his angels" (This was written to a church, so Christians can have their names taken back out of the Book of Life)<br>  <br>  So to answer your question, a believing Christian can go to hell just by not knowing the right teaching. This really explains why Jesus reserved his harshest judgment for the teachers of the Law (Pharisees, etc.)<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|AA10692326	Read 1 John.  It covers this question well.  If you have faith in Christ as your Lord and Savior, then you are saved by his death on the cross, yoou are forgiven, and your sins are not counted against you.  This includes both former and future sins.  Nonetheless this is not license to sin (see Romans 6), but you need not fear that every little sin is going to end up putting you in hell.  Our salvation is based on Christ's merit, not our own.  We are not saved by faith first, then works second; we are saved by faith through and through.|`|CPGDbq8Laa	Because you never really have been convicted by Jesus' love and righteousness. <br>  <br>  Unless you feel utterly touched or regretful is and indication that you truely have receive salvation, and when you procalim that Jesus is Lord, and exult his name, if you do, you are convicted, for his glory and love is overwhelming, naturally anyone will break down and weep by a boy. Have you ever experience that, i have. And i was like a baby, but as childrens of God its natural. <br>  <br>  If you are struggling its only the right conclusion that you are still trapped in your evil desires and there are somethings in your life that Satan is using it as a bridge to reach into your life and attacking you. Therefore destroy all of its sources before Satan really destroys you, its urgent its serious, as you wont know when you will die, for the fire of hell has broken and ur life is spiritually unfruitful until you convict yourself and be totally yielded to him, destroy all the bridges of sins in your life.Only then, the plan of God for your life, the power of your prayers, the love, the protection, divine peace, prosperity, wisdom and understand will only come.

The truth is that when we sin knowing that it is wrong (willful sin) that sin become what the Bible calls "the sin that so easily besets us". It will remain with us throughout our lives and when we get away from God in our walk with Him, that sin will rear its head just to show us that we can't play around with God. It is illustrated int he life of David, when God judged Him for killing Uriah God said to him "because you used the sword the sword will never depart from your home".  You can have victory through faith, but if you let down your defenses you will be right back into it again.

UhyvM73iaa	No it is not haram to wear hair style of Mohawks or any other style you prefer.<br>  <br>  When I was teen age boy all adults would critize if our hair covered our ears and hair covered our shirt collar in back. These days in USA being bald is fashion. <br>   <br>  We know Rasoolallah had his hair long enough that covered his neck in back.  That was style of men in those days. Today in Mecca or Madina all men wear short hair.<br>  <br>  Rasoolallah did always advise to follow the middle path and to avoid extreme right or extreme left views in our all matters of life and that was true for fashions also.   Wearing clothes and hair  of unusual color and style   will attrack attention of people and they will make unpleasant comment that anger the strange looking person.  It is always best to follow the current fashion that all people of our gender wear.  <br>  <br>   It is much better to get attention of other people with our decent matters, our helping and caring for others, keeping our gaze down when females are passing by, having a friendly nature rather than harsh attitude towards all is much better to get liked by all relatives and friends.  Most businesses didn't like to hire young men with long hair in Chicago in seventies and eighties because that was the style of hippies those days. In nineties Michael Jordan (Super Basket Ball player)  shaved his head. . No one mad comments on him . In fact being  ball headed became a fashion. Even today lots of men shave their heads or leave very short hair in the center.

Don't get offended.|`|ry6vQwwSaa	as far as i know, its not haram but its one of those things thats frowned upon...i guess if u still have ur beliefs etc u should be ok...<br>  <br>  as far as dying your hair black (and a bunch of other colours), thats not allowed...the prophet pbuh said you should only dye it with henna or some other plant which is similar to henna...i cant remember the exact wording but you dont die it black since thats trying to look more youthful and shows that you're unhappy with the way you look...<br>  <br>  futhermore, modern day dyes kind of 'coat' your hair, rather than penetrate it, which technically means your wuzu isnt complete...science has shown that henna colouring absorbs into your hair, rather than add a physical coat...

We'd decided that it be a very simple and classy garden ceremony and dinner - no fuss or frills. But on the day, I realised that he'd been busily making other plans ! He'd decorated the car with ribbons, had ordered a cake with a little "couple in a sports car" on top, and had gone to the restaurant and decorated the table with candles, gold sprinkles, heart-shaped chocolates, the works...and he'd hired a pianist to play our favorite songs throughout the dinner. He just couldn't resist making the day as romantic as possible. He is such a sweetheart, the loveliest man in the world. That day was so special because he did everything straight from his heart.|`|AA10387455	I can`t pick out just one, as my wife gave me so many happy memories in our 54 year marriage. Her`s just one.

nZP6FT1Qaa	Yes,this reminds me of the scribes & pharisees who were knowledgeable in scriptures, but their hearts were far from God. A religious person is someone who always wants to use the dead letter word to make a point.  A person can make a religion out of religion, its like the blind leading the blind.God teaches us to be Spiritually minded not religious minded.|`|6Nuaqihpaa	You become too religious when it's your entire life. People need to make their own decisions. A book that may or may not be complete bullsh*t should not make your decisions for you.<br>  <br>  I grew up in the Methodist church and still enjoy returning to it when I'm back home (I'm away at college), but I consider my values and morals to be secular.<br>  <br>  I'm an adult can make adult decisions based on adult judgment. I don't need religion to make those for me.|`|myjB1nWGaa	There is a term in Catholicism called "Scrupulosity". Scrupulosity is when a person becomes pathologically worried about sinning. When I first became Catholic, I was scrupulous; not obsessive, but enough to cause me to worry about doing things the right way. I also worried about other people doing things correctly. Any little error would leave me in hysterics (not literally). I was highly critical of priests and other leaders in the church. I wondered if the Catholic Church was still holy, like it was pre-Vatican II. If someone held my hand during the "Our Father", I was annoyed. Where was the Latin? Where was the incense? Why didn’t she/he kneel? I finally realized that we are all sinners. There are bad priests, but most leaders in our church are good men and women. Latin is nice, but not essential to have a valid mass. The Pope is the real Pope. The papacy didn't end with Pope Pius XII. People are human. They make mistakes. Unless someone is deliberately and willfully breaking the rubrics of the mass; it is valid. Basically I had to allow God’s grace to flow in me and other people. I had to learn to trust his word that the "gates of hell will not prevail against the church". I had to learn forgiveness. I am still a Roman Catholic. I deeply love Jesus. I deeply love my church and faith. I still love the Tridentine Mass, but I also know that the Novus Ordo Mass is beautiful too. Jesus is in charge. He didn't make me second in command!|`|EmtJ287caa	You become crippled because you become unable to make decisions without consulting someone or something in your faith.|`|8ACSEVy7aa	There are many levels in Brainwashing!!!<br>  <br>  .|`|BYf9WuLWaa	There head explodes<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  KABOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!|`|SLcT4dqyaa	You wonder where all your money has gone.|`|XzXpDPpfaa	You turn loopy.. and become my death target.|`|GTs1n7IYaa	You can end up in the mental ward suffering serious delusions, or, you might find yourself lying dead with an empty plastic cup in your hand, having swallowed poisoned cool-aid at the guidance of the pastor.

Your fellow people of faith are ashamed of you for some of the stupid things you spout and those who dont share your faith hate and despise you for your intollerance and aggressive attitude. Often the true intent of said religion is forgotten in favor of zealotism, all traces of humanity is expunged and a monster takes its place.<br>  <br>  Religion is an ideology, like all ideologies if you feel you must employ it then do so with some measure.

We have found that soap and water reduce disease and once we became used to washing daily, we notice the odor of people who do not bathe.

If you are a new creation through Christ...then you know that His will does not consist of the things of this world.<br>  Pray to God to guide you and let Him work His will through you...that way He is doing His will and not yours.<br>  However, if you have a good idea that will honor and glorify Him...run it past Him...let Him know how excited you are about it because you will be working for Him and be able to spread His word and glorify Him. He will most generally give you His blessings, unless He has something else planned for you.<br>  <br>  Pray for guidance and be assured that He will lead you where you need to be. Remember to put your complete trust and faith in Him to do this....no plan B!  <br>  Just believe in Him and be filled with His peace....it will happen....

See promise #8 below:<br>  <br>  The rosary is explained here:<br>  <a href="http://www.ewtn.com/Devotionals/prayers/rosary/how_to.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.ewtn.com/Devotionals/prayers/...</a><br>  <br>  The fifteen promises of Mary to Christians who recite the rosary:<br>  1. Whoever shall faithfully serve me by the recitation of the Rosary shall receive signal graces.<br>  2. I promise my special protection and the greatest graces to all those who shall recite the Rosary.<br>  3. The Rosary shall be a powerful armor against Hell, it will destroy vice, decrease sin, and defeat heresies.<br>  4. It will cause virtue and good works to flourish; it will obtain for souls the abundant mercy of God; it will withdraw the hearts of men from the love of the world and its vanities and will lift them to the desire of eternal things. Oh, that souls would sanctify themselves by this means.<br>  5. The soul which recommends itself to me by the recitation of the Rosary, shall not perish.<br>  6. Whoever shall recite the Rosary devoutly, applying himself to the consideration of its sacred mysteries, shall never be conquered by misfortune. God will not chastise him in His justice, he shall not perish by an unprovided death; if he be just, he shall remain in the grace of God and become worthy of eternal life.<br>  7. Whoever shall have a true devotion for the Rosary shall not die without the Sacraments of the Church.<br>  8. Those who are faithful to recite the Rosary shall have during their life and at their death the light of God and the plenitude of His graces; at the moment of death, they shall participate in the merits of the saints in Paradise.<br>  9. I shall deliver from Purgatory those who have been devoted to the Rosary.<br>  10. The faithful children of the Rosary shall merit a high degree of glory in Heaven.<br>  11. You shall obtain all you ask of me by the recitation of the Rosary.<br>  12. All those who propagate the Holy Rosary shall be aided by me in their necessities.<br>  13. I have obtained from my Divine Son that all the advocates of the Rosary shall have for intercessors the entire Celestial Court during their life and at the hour of death.<br>  14. All who recite the Rosary are my sons, and brothers of my only Son, Jesus Christ.<br>  15. Devotion to my Rosary is a great sign of predestination.<br>  <br>  Our Lady has 117 titles. She selected this title at Fatima: "I am the Lady of the Rosary."<br>  <br>  St. Francis de Sales said the greatest method of praying IS- Pray the Rosary.<br>  <br>  St. Thomas Aquinas preached 40 straight days in Rome, Italy on just the Hail Mary.<br>  <br>  St. John Vianney, patron of priests, was seldom seen without a rosary in his hand.<br>  <br>  "The rosary is the scourge of the devil" -- Pope Adrian VI<br>  <br>  "The rosary is a treasure of graces" -- Pope Paul V<br>  <br>  Padre Pio, the stigmatic priest, said: "The Rosary is THE WEAPON"<br>  <br>  Pope Leo XIII wrote 9 encyclicals on the rosary.<br>  <br>  Pope John XXIII spoke 38 times about Our Lady and the Rosary.

If you've got those, then you are in the the right place.|`|3KD6RRhPaa	To know the will of God for your life is to obey Him 100%. If you follow your Churches doctrines you will not be following God, for they stink in God's nostrils.<br>  <br>  To know the will of God for your life is to become truly born again by the water and the Spirit (John 3:3-5). The water mentioned here is the baptism of Jesus by John the Baptist. It has absolutely nothing to do with our water baptism.<br>  <br>  To know the will of God you must also be ready to be taught by the servants of God who have gone before and to cast away your previous notions and thoughts. Their faith is the correct one, and this faith God approves. So if you are ready to know the will for your life, then may I ask you to go to www.bjnewlife.org and order for yourself the first 3 books in the series? Its all for free.|`|7mxCMfYKaa	Read the Bible and pray for it to be revealed to you. Maybe ask Him to open a door.

It's not easy to know and to understand God's will as He ever mentioned." Your plan isn't my plan".<br>  <br>  The same things go to Mary and Joseph mother and father of Jesus. They were confused what to do, but God knew they needed His guidance that's why He sent Gabriel to bring the message and appeared also in Joseph's dream.<br>  <br>  Jesus mentioned that we need to leave ourselves and carry the cross with Him...we need to pray to know what God's specific will in each of us...but we need time before we know it...God wants particularly the faithful to help the poor, the needy, the oppressed....and that's the key to enter heaven...<br>  <br>  In Matthew 7:21-23: Jesus said, "Not everyone who calls me Lord will get into the kingdom of heaven...<br>  <br>  Please read on Matthew 25:31-46..<br>  <br>  God bless you!|`|l2XtZlPUaa	What you got to do is discover it yourself, there is purpose in life thats for sure but there isn't any written word, nor should there be [Im making reference to a popular book of lies], that dictates how to experience god.|`|AA10846623	I suggest that you find that god first, not just in your imagination as all other believers have allowed themselves to be taken in by preachers and priests, but literally find him, then you can ask that  do nothing god all the question that you have.|`|1n6LMCS3aa	I am my own God. therefore I know my own will is in my own life.|`|SqB0ysksaa	There is no God.

The Koran reveals the will of allah.  The purpose of the Holy Bible is to reveal GOD or YHWH.  There is a difference.  GOD or YHWH wants you to know Him and have a personal relation with Him.  That is why salvation and knowledge of whom GOD and Jesus are is what is important in the Christian's faith, while in all other religions it is obedience.  <br>  <br>  This has been a problem for non-believers since Christ's crucifixion.  It is the reason they cannot understand the believer's concept that you can live an evil life, but accept the relationship with GOD before death and still go to Heaven ,while without the relationship, you can live a life of good works, and go to eternal hell.  <br>  <br>  The Bible says the "plowing of the wicked is sin."  In other words all "good works" done by someone without a relationship with YHWH is sin.<br>  <br>  Know GOD, and He will lead you in HIS will, regardless of what you may do.<br>  <br>  The LORD bless and keep you and make HIS face to shine upon you.

Which is nothing like what we've been told.|`|aac509d23ce8da767d68e4f377f3f4c7aa	Your comment, "If you hate someone you are not murdering them in your heart" shows why you are confused about Satan. God says you are just as guilty of murder as the one who does the actual murder. (See Matthew 5:21-26) Why? Because out of the heart comes hatred: "Anyone who hates his brother is a murderer, and you know that no murderer has eternal life in him. Anyone who does not love remains in death." (1 John 3:14-15)<br>  <br>  Hatred arose with Satan, who was responsible for tricking our first parents into losing eternal life. Satan remains in death because of his hatred against God. Lots of humans are in the same uncomfortable place but their pride prevents them confessing this to God. Instead, they accuse God. The name Satan means accuser. So if you accuse God of killing countless people and wiping out the entire earth, whilst Satan hasn't killed anybody, you have hatred in your heart and you remain in death.<br>  <br>  God won the victory over sin, death and the devil by dying in our place. Satan is never going to die so that you might live, now, is he?|`|wNJetCLEaa	Well, satan is more concerned with sending you to hell for all eternity.  In the bible, God only kills people who are completely evil and are in danger of corrupting the good, but he really does want the best for you.  It's just that some people reach the point of no return and become a virus to humanity.  We ourselves have the death penalty and don't even have infinite knowledge.  Now that God has paid for your sins, there is no such thing as the point of no return and thus he doesn't kill people anymore.|`|xBGEcPvCaa	He has caused countless death, look at jobs family for example, read that book<br>  <br>  He hates, he who hates is a murderer at heart, God says satan was a murderer from the beginning, the implications i can not currently comprehend.|`|AA10407603	Here's 4 Biblical studies on Satan... to let you know more of what he's about.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.watchtower.org/e/20021015/article_02.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.watchtower.org/e/20021015/art...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.watchtower.org/e/19990901/article_02.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.watchtower.org/e/19990901/art...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.watchtower.org/e/20070601/article_02.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.watchtower.org/e/20070601/art...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.watchtower.org/e/20051115/article_02.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.watchtower.org/e/20051115/art...</a><br>  <br>  READ AT YOUR OWN RISK!!!|`|MD1nwIW7aa	<a href="http://www.halexandria.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.halexandria.org/</a><br>  There is more than one god, they weren't gods in the way you think of them, probably aliens, and not your Scientology kind.|`|2D8aUsq3aa	If you hate someone, that is all it takes to have sinned.

If so your argument is invalid from even Satan's standpoint as he believes God does exist.<br>  <br>  You don't see the need to eradicate the wicked and why God needed to intervene in ancient times and also in the very near future? <br>  <br>  You fail to see the parallels between those days to this time and why Jesus even used them in comparison with the last days. <br>  <br>  You also lack insight on what took place within the Garden of Eden. <br>  <br>  If the wicked were allowed to run their course they would end life for mankind completely.<br>  <br>  Did God set man up? You lack accurate knowledge here as well.<br>  <br>  What was “the tree of the knowledge of good and bad”?<br>  <br>  By taking of the fruit of “the tree of the knowledge of good and bad,” Adam and Eve expressed their rebellion. The Creator, as Universal Sovereign, was acting wholly within his right in making the law regarding the tree, for Adam, being a created person, and not sovereign, had limitations, and he needed to acknowledge this fact. For universal peace and harmony, it would devolve upon all reasoning creatures to acknowledge and support the Creator’s sovereignty. Adam would demonstrate his recognition of this fact by refraining from eating the fruit of that tree. As father-to-be of an earth full of people, he must prove obedient and loyal, even in the smallest thing. The principle involved was: “The person faithful in what is least is faithful also in much, and the person unrighteous in what is least is unrighteous also in much.” (Lu 16:10) Adam had the capability for such perfect obedience. There was evidently nothing bad intrinsically in the fruit of the tree itself. (The thing forbidden was not sex relations, for God had commanded the pair to “fill the earth.” [Ge 1:28] It was the fruit of an actual tree, as the Bible says.) What was represented by the tree is well expressed in a footnote on Genesis 2:17, in The Jerusalem Bible (1966):<br>  <br>  “This knowledge is a privilege which God reserves to himself and which man, by sinning, is to lay hands on, 3:5,?22. Hence it does not mean omniscience, which fallen man does not possess; nor is it moral discrimination, for unfallen man already had it and God could not refuse it to a rational being. It is the power of deciding for himself what is good and what is evil and of acting accordingly, a claim to complete moral independence by which man refuses to recognise his status as a created being. The first sin was an attack on God’s sovereignty, a sin of pride.<br>  <br>  Do you really think you have the Bible all figured out? Do you really think that you are smarter than your own Creator? Pretty arrogant of you to say that "if God does exist he better have a really good excuse." Why would he HAVE to explain himself to you? If he does exist then you better have a better excuse as to why you didn't take the time to seek him with an honest heart.<br>  <br>  Try educating yourself first on the Bible before making weak assumptions.<br>  <br>  Why Was An<br>  Ancient World<br>  Destroyed?<br>  <br>  A Whole World Destroyed!<br>  <a href="http://watchtower.org/e/20020301/article_01.htm" rel="nofollow">http://watchtower.org/e/20020301/article...</a><br>  <br>  Why Did That Ancient World Perish?<br>  <a href="http://watchtower.org/e/20020301/article_02.htm" rel="nofollow">http://watchtower.org/e/20020301/article...</a><br>  <br>  WHAT IS<br>  ARMAGEDDON?<br>  <br>  “The War to End All Wars”<br>  <a href="http://watchtower.org/e/20080401/article_01.htm" rel="nofollow">http://watchtower.org/e/20080401/article...</a><br>  <br>  Armageddon—God’s War to End All Wars<br>  <a href="http://watchtower.org/e/20080401/article_02.htm" rel="nofollow">http://watchtower.org/e/20080401/article...</a>

Actually, according to United Nations World Magazine,"The Catholic church is the biggest financial power, wealth accumulator and property owner in existence. She is a greater possessor of material riches than any other single institution, corporation, bank, giant trust, government or state of the whole globe.

Fue entonces cuando él comenzó a interesarse en la expedición de las nuevas tierras descubiertas.<br>  1519 - Desembarcó en la Capital Azteca de Tenochtitlan. No recibió ninguna resistencia de la gente azteca ya que éstos pensaron que Hernán Cortés era su Dios. Le dieron todas las riquezas de los aztecas y le atendieron bien. él también suprimió la ciudad de Tabasco y se encontró con una mujer llamó Malinche que se convirtió en su amante, guía, e intérprete.<br>  1520 - él sospechó que los Aztecas le iban a echar de sus tierras, entonces él tomó de rehén a Moctezuma y le obligó a jurar lealtad y fidelidad al rey de Espa?a. Para intentar calmar al resto de los Aztecas, liberó a Moctezuma, pero ellos respondieron apedreándolo hasta la muerte.Finalmente, con la captura de Cuauhtémoc, el Tlatoani de Tenochtitlán, también el jefe, el Imperio azteca desapareció.

I see it in my own family. My dad is native american, and brought me up to respect my elders to the extent that I wait on them hand and foot, call them all grandma or grandpa or aunty or uncle for the ones I do not know very well, etc...however, in my moms family (they are mostly white, have nothing to do with their native family) my siblings are the only ones that check in with my grandparents regularly and make it our personal responsibility to ensure that we meet whatever needs of theirs we can from a distance (my grandma lives in canada) For most of my cousins, they call on holidays and send occasional letters or pictures in the mail, but thats about it. My grandma also comments on how my siblings and I are the only ones interested in learning family history and remembering the names of our ancestors. My tribe has a lunch program that allows the elderly in our community to gather everyday for a free lunch and socialise. It serves as a time for them to discuss issues going on in the tribe and make decisions about certain things presented to them (by the younger generations) non native elders like to come because they  get treated so well, even though they don't have a voice in the decision making. Anyways, the type of elder-younger generation relationship I just told about is typical (or so it seems) among many white american families. Its the culture I guess, not to have compassion for the elderly to the extent other cultures do.|`|mgJaBrQOaa	I agree with you.

98db094f444e5154c3fcacd3e51e23c2aa	It is common to develop the personal friend of 'God' (or whatever) when feeling lonely. Its also common for many people to grow up feeling lonely in a sense.<br>  <br>  There is really no 'atheist' side. Just rational and skeptical thinking. You thought it was lonely before, wait till you fully realize how little we do KNOW in life, and learn how many of these other beliefs are another version of the 'god of the gaps'. <br>   <br>  After I lost my belief, I felt life was scary somewhat no longer KNOWING what happens after I die and not having the good friend around anymore. So at first I reminded my self that the truth is I do not know. So as to not feel the full thrust of the possibility that death may be the end for good. I still kind of take that position at times, however it is probably safe to say its more reasonable to live like death is really the end. If you need to believe in reincarnation for now, just don't start adding any more unproven notions to that belief for your own benefit.

That belief is something that people need to discover or un-discover themselves personally.  As for me, I believe in GOD.

I still believed in a greater force in the universe, or perhaps a greater force *of* the universe, but I realized I couldn't accept the basic premises of Christianity, or any of its wicked stepbrother religions.<br>  <br>  I don't claim to have all the answers, and this is why I think I might be on the right track. The universe is a crazy fun complicated ridiculous place, and anyone who claims that they have all the answers written down in their cozy little manual of the ancients is clearly full of ****. I love the fact that science changes on a daily basis, because it means that science is constantly challenging itself and reevaluating its interpretation of things. This doesn't mean that I believe that science, as it stands, is the ultimate authority. It just means that I like the method, and most importantly, I completely and unequivocally reject the idea that ANYTHING is beyond our understanding. It may turn out that some things are incomprehensible, but from what I can see, any claims that there are things beyond our ken are at present just the meanderings of lazy assholes who want to keep the overachievers down.<br>  <br>  So if it turns out that there are things that we mere mortals can never grasp, I'm okay with that, but what really annoys me is the ridiculous number of people--religious, atheist, pseudospiritual, or otherwise--who assume that because something is currently not within our scope, it never will be.<br>  <br>  F the ineffable.|`|pjGmAOgXaa	First, i suggest you dont base your beliefs on idealism. I hear alot of young adults and teens saying they believe in reincarnation rather than God because the process sounds nicer, that there is no judgement. Ok that may sound nice but you shouldnt believe things to be true just because they would be more ideal. I think it would be nice if 9/11 never happened... but that doesnt make it so. <br>  <br>  How can you know there is no God, heaven, or hell? The only way you could prove that is if you died to see what happened. It is illogical to assume things you have no proof of. The smart thing to do would be open to the possibility since you have no proof either way. This is NOT illogical, in fact, its what all of the greatest scientists and philosophers have in common. They question things and dont assume. <br>  <br>  In my personal opinion, you cannot even have reincarnation without a God of some sort. If someone dies, what determines whether they come back as a human versus a rodent? It is implied that there is a judge or someone who decides, like God. You see, there are ways to logically debate religion, but they dont follow scientific principles.|`|CLB32006aa	Why do you think there is an after life or that you had lives previous to this one?|`|UWKF7x4faa	You can believe whatever you want to believe.

You can be spiritual without being "religious". If it makes you feel better, that's fine.

You would now be on your own, with only other lowly mortals to turn to.<br>  <br>  The bright side is, you can now do what is morally correct, not because a book tells you so, but because you know it's morally the correct thing to do.

Hidden or buried objects found by the information given by such children, often located at extreme distances for instance.<br>  <br>  You are clearly searching for ultimate truth and that is not a "bad" thing at all. Just keep in mind that as you reconsider your deeply rooted programing (and we have all been programed by our familiar culture, the way we use language, and what we accept or dismiss) realize that sometimes good ideas are infected with bad ones and that removing/ cleaning these out can be quite painful.

ATCjFVRAaa	Because most non-Hispanic Americans wrongly believe that "Hispanic" is a separate race and that all Spanish speakers are the same. Most are not even aware that "White" Hispanics even exist. <br>  <br>  There is a caste system in Latin America that most Americans are also completely unaware of.  This caste system has existed since Spanish Colonial times and places those of pure White Spanish descent (Criollos) at the top of the social/economic structure while those of mixed race (Mestizos and Mulatto's) are positioned considerably lower. People of pure Native American or African descent are ranked lowest of all. This caste system does not exist in the U.S. for obvious reasons and Americans tend to group all Spanish speakers together regardless of their race or country of origin or social class - which is how the U.S. Census Bureau defines the term "Hispanic" by the way.<br>  <br>  Obviously the rich, upper-class Latinos have no real reason to immigrate and are therefore not very common in the U.S. Cubans are the exception because as you said the first wave of Cuban immigrants in the 50's and early 60's were the wealthy, educated, upper-class who immigrated to the U.S. to escape Fidel Castro's newly established regime.  They were followed a couple of decades later by the Black and Mulatto Cuban immigrants who because of their sheer numbers became almost synonymous with Cuba and Cubans in the eyes of most Americans (much in the same way that Americans wrongly stereotype all Mexicans as being non-white Mestizos). <br>  <br>  There is also the misconception that Hispanics are all somehow descended from illegal immigrants - when in reality a large portion of what's now the U.S. was claimed and colonized by Spain way before the U.S. even existed and there have been Spanish speakers here for 500 years.  But that's a whole 'nother topic.<br>  <br>  <br>  Blanquita - You're partially correct but there are many non-WASP whites (Italians, Greeks etc) that are accepted by the WASP community because they don't look or act stereotypically ethnic.  It's all about perception.  The same is true for Hispanics - if a White (pure Spanish descent) Hispanic American behaved and spoke in a non-stereotypical manner he/she would probably be perceived simply as a white person.<br>  <br>  WASP specifically means White Anglo Saxon Protestant.|`|80bc9ac3af8ceeb5b69ac3461ec5d0f7aa	Cause your cuban.

JTu1cLkYaa	I saw that show also, very interesting. However, there was never a Lilith. The verse in Gen 1:27 "....God created he him; male and female created he them." refers to the creation of Adam and Eve. Later in Gen 2;22 "... made he a woman, and brought her unto the man."  <br>  <br>  There are many who believe that having two references to making woman means that Eve was Adam's second wife. But it states at the end of Gen 1 that this was the end of the sixth day. The first verses in Gen 2 states that the heavens and earth were finished and on the seventh day God rested. Then the rest of Gen 2 is a recap of how everything had been created, including woman and with Adam naming everything.|`|hiCSVwchaa	Well, there are definitely two creation stories in the bible that create the first man and woman in different ways, but I don't remember woman flying off in either of them...<br>  <br>  Just another instance of the error of man.<br>  <br>  As far as I know Lilith is only mentioned in Jewish  Kabbalistic writings.|`|tI1NHwfBaa	I'll use a technical term: poppycock.<br>  <br>  None of what you've described is in scripture.  <br>  <br>  The creation account speaks in general terms about making man and woman, and then it goes into details later about that event.  This is clear from the context.  Only by taking it out of context and twisting scripture can you make a case for the whole Lilith story, but then you have to explain why Adam was created twice!

I go out and see friends occasionally. I don't have a whole bunch of them, but enough to keep me going. I am a shy person as well. But when people get to know me, I become quite social. I also enjoy spending time by myself though. I actually prefer it. You don't have to put up with any nonsense from other people. You can just be yourself and do whatever you want to do. I like it :).

The Rosary shall be a powerful armor against Hell, it will destroy vice, decrease sin, and defeat heresies.<br>  4.

Whoever shall have a true devotion for the Rosary shall not die without the Sacraments of the Church.<br>  8. Those who are faithful to recite the Rosary shall have during their life and at their death the light of God and the plenitude of His graces; at the moment of death, they shall participate in the merits of the saints in Paradise.<br>  9. I shall deliver from Purgatory those who have been devoted to the Rosary.<br>  10. The faithful children of the Rosary shall merit a high degree of glory in Heaven.<br>  11. You shall obtain all you ask of me by the recitation of the Rosary.<br>  12. All those who propagate the Holy Rosary shall be aided by me in their necessities.<br>  13.

Think of the shi* that's changed your life...usually it's not run of the mill "real" shi*. Remember growing up and loving a specific super hero? We relate to these heroes, these beliefs. Superman, Jesus, Buddha, Zeus, Medusa, Hercules, etc all shape our ideologies...and no matter how atheist you are, you can't escape these thousands of years old religious repercussions that are deep set into your daily life. <br>  <br>  It's not so much of what truly existed or did not exist, it is the unwavering desire to believe in something greater than ourselves...be it religion, comic books, World of Warcraft, Tarot Cards, "destiny", music, or whatever, we all relate to the quintessential "hero" or "god" or "moral order" in some way, as a form to look up to, to believe in. <br>  <br>  Maybe Xmen's Wolverine on Saturday morning didn't make you want to be a badass, maybe Jesus didn't make you want to be a kind hearted celibate, maybe you only relate to actual real people you know (because celebrities/authors/singers/artists etc you've never met etc are basically the same dynamic as "myths" or "heroes" just call your religion "buying esoteric records" or "smoking pot and listening to phish") and maybe you truly have no affinity toward fictional/mythical beings found in books and stories....<br>  <br>  yet, somehow, I doubt that.|`|4GaPFgiuaa	As a Catholic I have learned that to believe in the existence of God is a question of intelligence not of faith.

Life is but a dream, a journey, a story, and you're ultimately controlling and creating it based upon your beliefs and perceptions both consciously and subconsciously, so it's best to come to your own beliefs and perceptions instead of letting others create them for you.. the next time you have an accident think about how it felt when it happened, what really happened was a major glitch in the reality you're creating.

Taking lessons is always important, but equally important are these:<br>  <br>  1) Listen/watch: Listen to internet radio stations like BBC, watch TV shows in English (use only subtitles, NOT voice dubbing!), etc.<br>  <br>  2) Write/communicate: Try to find discussion forums from the web about things that you find interesting (music/various artists, hobbies, etc.) and start communicating there with other people using English. Start using instant messaging systems in case you find some new friends or start emailing them.<br>  <br>  3) Buy yourself a proper dictionary, and each time when you see a strange word that you do not understand, look it up.<br>  <br>  The main point in ANY language learning is to make it as fun as possible for yourself. Try to find topics that interest you, read online newspapers, listen to BBC/NBC and other radio stations online, if you find a discussion forum for e.g. your favourite hobby or your idols in music do participate there, etc. <br>  <br>  I'm sorry there is no easy way out with this, you must develop your skills in ALL these language "levels" or dimensions in order to reach better language skills!! <br>  <br>  Last but not least: NEVER EVER use ANY online translators, they are nothing but utter rubbish!!

They believe that he came to earth to establish his gospel, redeem the people of the world from their sins if they will turn to him and repent, and make possible the resurrection of the dead.  Because this is the center of their religion, they are Christian.<br>  <br>  Here are some differences.<br>  1. They believe in an apostasy: that is, after Jesus established his gospel, the disciples were killed, doctrines were corrupted, and the world lost the authority and many truths brought by Jesus <br>  <br>  2. They believe in a restoration: after the world had been prepared (through the reformation, the establishment of a tolerant, free county, etc) the climate was right for the Lord to restore the missing truths and authority.  This happened through Joseph Smith.  The church is thus named the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (formally) because it is Christ's church in the present time (or latter days).  <br>  <br>  3. They believe in ongoing revelation: that God speaks to men now as he did in times of old.  For this reason, the bible is not the only scripture.  Since God speaks to mankind in all times and places, the Book of Mormon, for example, is a record of God's word to the inhabitants of the ancient Americas.  Furthermore, there are other records of scripture we don't have that certainly exist.  Also, because God is not silent, there is a prophet on the earth today, as there were in old times.  The current prophet is Thomas S. Monson.  <br>  <br>  4. Another distinction people make is the nature of the trinity.  When Joseph Smith saw God, two "personages" appeared to him - the father and the son.  For this reason, Mormons believe that the trinity is composed of three separate and distinct beings, unlike many other christian denominations.  For this reason, they are often referred to as non-christian - an argument which baffles Mormons, who think of themselves as die-hard Christians.<br>  <br>  5. finally they believe that proper authority and ordinances such as baptism are necessary for salvation - concepts that are accepted in varying degrees in mainstream Christianity.  God provides a way for all to have access to these ordinances whether they know about them or not, because no one can be kept from salvation simply because they didn't know what the requirements are.  However, this in itself (like most other points) are too long a discussion for a yahoo post.  <br>  <br>  For more information visit www.mormon.org<br>  try chatting with someone!|`|mjGSAGHyaa	Yeah, it's pretty different. It's different enough for many bigoted Fundamentalists to call it a "cult" or refer to the church as not being Christian at all.|`|tI1NHwfBaa	Yes, it's extremely different.<br>  <br>  Would you consider a religion that believed that Mohammad never lived to be an Islamic religion?<br>  <br>  In the same way, Christians who believe in the deity of Jesus Christ don't consider any belief that rejects Jesus' deity to be a Christian religion.<br>  <br>  When you change a central tenet of a belief system and create a new belief around the change, that's a cult, Jared's charge of "bigoted fundamentalism" notwithstanding.|`|618783bb3688632e3fa1d8194cbf4c02aa	Yes.<br>  <br>  Smith WAS a charlatan.  He created a religion (an institution known for its controlling influence) by reading golden plates, which no one could see, out of a hat.  When prompted, he couldn't repeat the feat.<br>  <br>  There were many forms of writing in use, by humanity, during the time that christ was supposed to have existed.  The Roman's were known for their record keeping.  The Egyptians had been carving hieroglyphics into stone centuries before the christian era.  <br>  <br>  There is no reason that there are no writings that prove the existence of Hebrew slaves, Christ, or the claims made by Smith when creating the LDS.  In fact, the lack of writing (which would be considered contemporary evidence), lends a great deal of credibility to the notion that these are all fabricated events.

nkAHoiDbaa	You would not necessarily be discriminating or bigoted.  People are allowed to have their own preferences and if they are not against others who choose a different lifestyle that is not discrimination.  I am totally heterosexual and have no interest in homosexuality for myself, but I have friends and a relative who are homosexuals.  They are nice people and I associate with them. Just because I don't have the same sexual preferences does not mean I am prejudiced against them.|`|ULkqriEhaa	Well, thinking homosexuality is repulsive and disgusting is pretty biggoted, buddy. Welcome to the 21st century.<br>  <br>  Yes, i say you do have prejudice, it's time to open your mind and accept people..you don't "CHOOSE" your sexuality, you don't wake up and say "i am gay today" it's a bloody sex preference, it's nothing gross and repulsive-most people who are homophobes possibly  have some sexuality issues with yourself, those who judge are insecure with themselves.|`|eKOgRHa6aa	What people do in their own spare time is their business. It's not as if they are having sexual relations with children or animals or corpses or eating feces or something. They are two grown consenting adults having sex. What's so bad about that? What's so repulsive? Do you think the same when a heterosexual couple do it in the butt?<br>  I would say you are quite bigoted not discriminant but still bigoted|`|BxTAfd2baa	It is possible that you are just a homophobe and that it is not your fault.  Some people are just that way.  There's nothing wrong with it.|`|0aaa10bf1334628de7df8d1527e7a5a7aa	Yes, you are still prejudiced, by definition (i.e., having a dislike that is derived from a preconceived opinion not based on reason or fact- Webster's). I would not say you are bigoted, though, because you recognize the injustice of limiting others because of your prejudices. You might be surprised to find that your repulsion and disgust mellow with exposure to homosexual people... that is, those you needn't engage in any repulsive acts with.|`|QH02h9REaa	I don't think so. Just because you think something is gross or disgusting doesn't mean that your discriminating or anything, it's just a difference of opinion. I'm sure there's plenty of homosexuals who think straight sex is repulsive and disgusting, but we don't consider them to be discriminating.|`|vs5rK3iRaa	Why worry about such things.

Ring and say you cannot get there after all.<br>  An invitation for dinner should be just that and of course friends should do likewise and invite them around too.  Like there should be give and take in these situations.  I take it you have had them over to your place for dinner, whatever?   <br>  So things should even themselves out if you go to each others places (the bunch of people) with give and take all ways.   I would not accept an invitation such as this unless you all owe her in some big way like if she is the only one who ever does things like dinners and is getting sick of always paying for everything.   With an invite like this I would just about ring her up and ask her what is on the menu before you hand the money over if you are definitely going.|`|MoFrhr0iaa	It seems like a great idea for a souring economy.

eb4e977a0cb9ce50b08bf74f0f3a0c61aa	You've. been. talking. to. one. <br>  Be very careful - there are many predators on the Internet, that will tell you ANYTHING you want to hear just to get you somewhere alone.<br>  Here is truth - read and understand. <br>  1. Vampires, defined as a humanoid being that MUST consume blood or energy to survive do not exist. Cut and paste time, as it is too much work to type this out over and over and I "recycle" my own answers instead of retyping them so here goes. A brief discussion of the human digestive system and then the probable vampire population given an exponential growth rate should explain why vampires are not possible. <br>  <br>  2. The human body is not designed to process large amounts of blood for nutrition. There is not enough protein, carbohydrates, and fats present in blood to maintain a complex creature such as Homo Sapiens or any theorized offshoot mutations. When a human ingests food it is first broken up into a bolus by chewing, then churned up in the stomach with digestive juices to form a mass called chyme. It then passes through the pylorus into the duodenum, part of the small intestine where it mixes with bile salts and secretions from the pancreas and liver which continue breaking it down on a molecular basis, mostly affecting fats at this point. The broken down nutrients pass through the wall of the intestines and into the bloodstream where they are carried to each cell or stored for later use. Indigestible bulk continues through the intestines, turning a dark brown from the bile. Water is absorbed from this mass in the large intestine depending on the needs of the body - a well-hydrated person will usually have a softer stool than a dehydrated person will. Water also enters the bloodstream, and this is what helps to maintain blood pressure. The pressure tends to balance itself in a healthy person because the bloodstream goes through a formation in the kidney called the Loop of Henle, where the narrowing blood vessel forces excess water and cellular waste such as urea out through the cellular wall into the kidneys, where it is excreted through the ureters into the bladder, and then out of the body via the urethral passageway.<br>  <br>  3. IMPORTANT - A person physically unable to process his own food for nutrition therefore also could not process blood - it's the same process. Ingested blood does not transmit directly to the veins anyway - it would be chemically broken down by the digestive system.<br>  <br>  4. Theoretical ingestion of blood to supply these nutrients would therefore have to occur at least once a day, and would require the ingestion of the entire blood supply which could not happen as the stomach is far too small to hold that much liquid volume. Hold up your clenched fist - under normal conditions your stomach is about that size. Furthermore, such a mass would be difficult to pass thru the intestines as it has no fibrous bulk, would create an intestinal impaction, causing massive vomiting from the large concentration of iron present, and any "real" vampire would have to eventually expel the waste, which would come out as a black, tarry, smelly goo, just as stool does when blood is present from a upper GI bleed. <br>  5. These humans that affect the whole "vampiric lifestyle" are NOT vampires. They are simply humans playing their own little game, in their own little fantasy world, usually pandering to their own little sexual fetish, which may or may not actually be sexual. I too, play my own little game, in the SCA, but mine is a game where the deeds that I do are determined by the strength of my arm and sword - I am a warrior, with just as much skill and ability as any warrior of ancient times. The difference is that I am claiming to be something physically possible: a warrior, and I prove it everytime I strap on my armor and walk onto a SCA battlefield. The so-called "vampires" are claiming to be something physically impossible: a walking corpse, and all they prove is that black Victorian clothing, a pair of false fangs, and a little makeup make for a good Halloween costume - it does not make you a vampire.<br>  <br>  6. Even if a vampire feeds once a week, and his victim also becomes a vampire, that is exponential growth, with four iterations a month. First iteration: One makes one, total two. Second iteration: Two make two, total four. Third iteration: Four make four, total eight. Fourth iteration: Eight make eight, total sixteen. 16 vampires at the end of one month, 256 at the end of the second month, 4096 by the end of the third month, 65,536 by the end of the fourth month, 1,048,476 at the end of the fifth, and 33,572,832 vampires at the end of half a year! By way of comparison, there are currently approximately 33 million people who have HIV/AIDS and the disease is a world-wide epidemic. I see people every day in the hospital with AIDS, but never has there been one documented case of a vampire attack. Do the math - vampires are a mathematical impossibility. As for the idea that vampires existed "a long time ago" consider the estimated global population 5,000 years ago - using the above mathematical rationale, a single vampire converted every human on the globe in less than two years. This falls therefore, under the logic of Occam's Razor - which states that when you have removed every impossible answer, whatever remains, no matter how improbable, must be the truth. Since there is no "vampiric plague" swarming the earth, the logical deduction is that they don't exist.<br>  <br>  7. Point of clarification about "vampire" bats: vampire is simply the name we have given them because they do drink blood, same as a flea, mosquito, leech, or spider. Are these creatures vampires? No. They are living creatures, not legendary monsters. They can subsist on blood because of their smaller size and proportionately larger stomach volume. Drinking blood does not make you a vampire anymore than eating raw meat makes you a werewolf, although it might make you a mosquito.<br>  <br>  8.The humans who profess to be vampires are victims of an all-encompassing self induced delusion. They are as human as you or I, regardless of their claims, and if they ingest HIV tainted blood they can most certainly contract the disease, esp. if they have any cuts, sores, or lesions in and or around their mouth. It is a very dangerous delusion to be laboring under. Note that there is absolutely no scientific or medical proof that these people derive any benefit at all from the ingestion of blood, and even worse are the so-called "psychic" vampires, because their delusion is one that they cannot substantiate with any concrete evidence at all.<br>  <br>  9. There is no "vampire" gene. People are not "born" as vampires. When a woman goes to the hospital for prenatal care there are many tests done on mother and child, even while still in the womb, to check for many things, including genetic anomalies that result in deformities and birth defects. If such a gene existed, in today's world with today's technology it would have been found - we have already completely sequenced the human genome. It would also have to follow Mendel's law of dominant/recessive gene theory. Again, the odds on that many "vampires" all escaping the notice of the medical/scientific community are so low as to be almost nonexistent. The idea that there is a global "vampire community" engaging in controlled breeding to keep the "bloodline pure" is delusional in the extreme.<br>  <br>  10. There is no "vampire virus" - as I have already pointed out, HIV is a virus, and look at how fast it has spread - virtually everyone knows someone with the affliction. According to the "vampire websites" there are "thousands" of vampires running around. If that was so then at least one of them has ended up in a hospital for bloodwork when they became pregnant, had a bloodborne infection, was injured in a car wreck, etc, etc, ad nauseum. The anomaly would have been detected and medical science would have isolated it, studied it, applied for research grants on it, published papers on it, and turned it into the talk of the medical and scientific community, as well as making its "discoverers" celebrities and rich beyond their dreams. A virus cannot alter your DNA in such a radical fashion without killing you.|`|bqisLny9aa	sure|`|AA11209831	Since vampires don't exist, the answer would have to be no.|`|BvY47ts6aa	Yes of course, that would be exciting.

I recently read a book called A place called Heaven by Richard Sigmund. In the 1970’s he was dead for 8 hours after being in an auto crash during the time he was deceased. He says that he had a tour of heaven and even talked to the Lord Christ, he described Heaven as being a planet that has seas and even different continents. <br>  <br>  To me Heaven being on another planet makes far more sense then the common concept that it is in our clouds. From this passage from 2 Corinthians 12:2  “I know a man in Christ who fourteen years ago was caught up to the third heaven.” The Third Heaven obviously has to be the place where the holy trinity  and the angels live and those who have passed and were saved live. If that is the third heaven then obviously there most be a first and second Heaven as well. The second heaven is the sky/ clouds, while the first Heaven is said to be interstellar space.|`|AA11402196	Bible says very little about heaven.<br>  <br>  Heaven is where God is and from. We were made from earth, and the earth is where we are.<br>  <br>  God created the heavens and the earth, our Universe. God existed before He created everything we can observe. God exists in the unobservable. Since heaven is where God is, then heaven must also be unobservable. <br>  <br>  There is a distinction between heaven and heavens. Heaven is where God is, and the heavens refer to beyond earth, the stars.<br>  <br>  We have one more hint about heaven. It comes from the revelation that God is spirit. God revealed that He made man, and man has a body, a soul and spirit. We were made in the image of God, spirit. So heaven is in each one of us.<br>  <br>  The Kingdom of God (Heaven) is a kingdom not of this world (earth). It is a place where God is on earth.<br>  <br>  Answer: Heaven is where God is. It exists in both unobservable and observable. It is not of this world, but it is each one of us.|`|zUMvC6QEaa	Heaven is not a physical place bound by time and space.

CjWdxAJaaa	tell your boyfreind of your fantasies and see what he says and then if its ok by him then fill up on your fantasy and then you can settle down to married life, but if your fantasy is more than you wanted then you may have to rethink your future.|`|KBBonf97aa	Unless you're still in preschool, you shouldn't be inclined to act on every impulse you have.  There's nothing wrong with curiosity, but if you were truly committed to your boyfriend, you wouldn't even be entertaining thoughts of cheating on him, whether he gives his consent or not.<br>  <br>  Bisexuality is about being open to the possibility of a relationship with a man or a woman.  It's not about "dabbling" because you want to satisfy your curiosity or test your boundaries.  Any person can enjoy physical stimulation from another person, so if you decided to have a sexual encounter with another woman, it would be no less crass than when a guy pays a prostitute for copulation.  Would you think it was okay if your boyfriend was curious about sleeping with a stripper and needed to get that out of his system before marrying you?  Your curiosity happens to be about having sex with another woman, but the infidelity is no different.<br>  <br>  As for your boyfriend thinking it's okay, he's being naive.  The thing about commitment is that you no longer act on physical urges with anyone other than your partner.  If you're inclined to act on your curiosity, you should make your relationship with your boyfriend completely open and allow him the same freedom to sleep around.  That would be more honest than pretending there's a real commitment between you.|`|MgMsMExPaa	If you do not do this before you marry then you will feel like you cheated on him if you give in after you marry him. <br>  You could discuss this with him but would this turn him off if he knows.

Technically though they are not magic spells, more of herbal remedies that OTC brands cannot compare to. The reason the headache ones work so well is because you convince yourself they work, mind over matter. The herbal ones for cuts are never eaten, but applied to the area like a bandage with then acts a coagulant, so again, not really magical spells, though I found it strange how it works only with the spell being recited, odds are a mental or chemical thing at work. There are two though that anybody can do which could be deemed as black magic, even though there is no spell for them... The evil eye and the double wink. You use the evil eye on someone, it could mess up there whole day because they'll be thinking about what they did wrong. The double wink can make people what you're thinking all day. Those are the only two, although they're more of a physical transfer being interpreted. Depends whom they're used on. So over all, Most spells are flat out false, very few though work.|`|GeoiGjbCaa	Only on idiots.|`|GC9g3Nrmaa	yes they do.|`|V8TFzhYZaa	"magic spells" are the same thing as "prayer."<br>  <br>  Both are considered to be forms of self-hypnosis and both "work" with varying degrees of efficacy.<br>  <br>  Numerous objective tests have shown that prayer/spells work in circumstances ranging from healing to relationships to the finding of lost or mislaid objects.<br>  <br>  What has proven to be the greatest surprise in these controlled experiments is that prayers to rocks, trees and pagan deities work every bit as often and as well as prayers to jehovah, allah, or a statue of Abraham Lincoln.|`|d42418ca88e523b628710adb23553fb1aa	Yes.|`|xFqlUbQIaa	No they don't

T5DbLLgQaa	Actually, broadening one's language skills is a very broad concept, it can be done in more than one ways at the same time which is highly recommended. You can NOT become better ONLY in one area e.g. speaking, you MUST improve your skills in ALL dimensions of the language!<br>  <br>  Learning language well requires being as active as possible and making the learning fun for yourself. Taking lessons is always important, but equally important are these:<br>  <br>  1) Listen/watch: Listen to internet radio stations like BBC, watch TV shows in English (use only subtitles, NOT voice dubbing!), etc.<br>  <br>  2) Write/communicate: Try to find discussion forums from the web about things that you find interesting (music/various artists, hobbies, etc.) and start communicating there with other people using English. Start using instant messaging systems in case you find some new friends or start emailing them.<br>  <br>  3) Buy yourself a proper dictionary, and each time when you see a strange word that you do not understand, look it up.<br>  <br>  The main point in ANY language learning is to make it as fun as possible for yourself. Try to find topics that interest you, read online newspapers, listen to BBC/NBC and other radio stations online, if you find a discussion forum for e.g. your favourite hobby or your idols in music do participate there, etc. <br>  <br>  I'm sorry there is no easy way out with this, you must develop your skills in ALL these language "levels" or dimensions in order to reach better language skills!! <br>  <br>  Last but not least: NEVER EVER use ANY online translators, they are nothing but utter rubbish!!

HxXduL1maa	It's true  when important emotional needs, such as sexual fulfillment, are unmet, there is a risk for an affair. But having sex at all costs is not the solution. <br>  Most women experience no pain whatsoever when they have intercourse. The vagina is designed for intercourse, and works very well under most conditions. But most women do experience pain during intercourse.  <br>  One of the most common primary cause of vaginal pain during intercourse is  dry vagina. when a woman is sexually aroused, fluids are secreted in the vagina that keep the lining well lubricated. But if a woman is not sexually aroused, or if fluids are not secreted for some other reason, intercourse can cause very painful damage to the vaginal lining. <br>  There are two ways to avoid a dry vagina during intercourse. The first is to avoid intercourse until you are sexually aroused. The second way is to use an artificial water-based vaginal lubricant,. <br>  Since vaginal secretion is usually an indication of a woman's sexual interest, I recommend wait until she experiences sexual arousal and natural lubrication. I want couples to avoid getting into the habit of sex that's passionless for her. <br>  If you're not sure if dry vagina is cause of your pain, use an artificial lubricant once. If there is no pain under those conditions, then you have proof that it's the cause of your distress. <br>  Another common cause of vaginal discomfort during intercourse is bacterial infection. This occurs frequently in women, and an antibiotic will generally cure the problem within a week or so. A related problem is bladder infections. While the problem may be in the bladder or urethra, not in the vagina, it often causes discomfort during intercourse. <br>  most cases of persistent vaginal discomfort are not due to primary causes at all, but rather to a reflex called vaginismus. It's physical. Vaginismus is a painful reflex created in association with a primary cause of vaginal pain. <br>  This reflex responds to stimulation of the vaginal opening. If you suffer from vaginismus, you will notice it most when you first try to insert something into your vagina. The opening involuntarily contracts and pain is immediately felt. <br>  Regardless of how sexually aroused you might be, or how lubricated your vagina might be, as soon as you try to insert your husband's penis, you would experience excruciating pain. It may be difficult to insert his penis, because the vaginal opening becomes constricted. In some cases, it is impossible to insert a penis. <br>  There is a tried and proven way to overcome the vaginismus reflex. If you follow this exercises  in the privacy when you are alone in the house.. <br>  Begin each session by covering your finger with water-based lubrication. Very slowly, lubricate the opening of the vagina with your finger, then slowly insert your finger about an inch.. In a slow circular motion, gently rub the vaginal opening with your finger in ever-increasing circles. Remember to go slowly enough not to trigger the reflex or experience any discomfort. After you have rubbed the opening for about a minute without any pain or discomfort, slowly insert your finger into the vagina, and in a circular motion gently rub the inside of the vagina as far as your finger will go. Then remove your finger, and do the same thing all over again. Do it about five times before you end the session. <br>  You will notice that after the first insertion of your finger, the opening is much less sensitive, and you will be able to penetrate much more quickly without triggering a reflex. Move your finger slowly enough so that you avoid any discomfort. But after a while, you will find that you can move it very freely without pain. <br>  The number of sessions to completely eliminate the reflex will depend on the severity of the vaginismus. But when it is eliminated, you should be able to insert an object the size of a penis, with lubrication, fairly rapidly without any pain or discomfort. <br>  There are some women who are not comfortable touching themselves, and would prefer having their husbands carry out these exercises. While it can work, the problem with anyone else doing it is that no one but you knows precisely how much pressure to use, and your husband would inadvertently trigger the reflex far more often than you would. That means that it would take much longer for you to overcome vaginismus with his help. <br>  His turn should come after you are convinced that the reflex is extinguished. Up to this point, obviously, you should have avoided intercourse, because it would have brought the reflex back. But when you think the reflex is gone, it's time to start having intercourse again. Unfortunately, you will find that after you have learned to insert a penis-sized object into your vagina without incident, the reflex may suddenly reappear the first time your husband tries to insert his penis. <br>  To prepare for that common outcome, the first time you have intercourse you should insert his penis yourself. Use plenty of lubricating fluid, and lay on top of him when you do it so you can control the penetration. He should lay motionless so that the penetration and thrusting is done only by you so you can stop whenever you experience the least amount of discomfort. Eventually, you will be able to insert his penis without any pain, thrust as fast and deep as you want, and experience no discomfort whatsoever. The vaginismus reflex will have been eliminated. <br>  If it ever comes back, it will be in a much milder form, and you will be able to eliminate it in a day or so by going back to inserting his penis yourself and controlling the thrusting motion during intercourse. <br>  To repeat what I havesaid , whenever you experience any pain during intercourse, stop immediately. Then solve the problem before resuming intercourse.|`|UinOWcMUaa	She should see a doctor to rule out any significant problems, but what is most likely is that your hitting her cervix. The cervix, otherwise known as the mouth of the womb, is located at the top of the vagina. If you insert your finger, you can feel it as a firm area; it feels almost like the tip of one's nose. <br>  <br>  Because the cervix is part of the uterus, if the cervix is impacted during sex, the whole uterus is moved.

xxEhpytpaa	Respect and fear is healthy for anyone, But this is the respect and fear I mean. I respect my father, I know when he made a decision for me it was in my own best interest. Even if I didn't agree with him, he always thought of how it would harm or help me. And then told me why he made a decision like he did. I also feared my father because, he enforced punishment on me when I went beyond the limits he set for me. This is a father's love and I think he did the best he could do for me when I was growing up. This is called a healthy respect and fear of my father, for I love him dearly and I know all his decisions he made for me were because he loved me too. This is the kind of respect and fear God wants from us. We don't always know why God has allowed something to happen, But in the end it is always in the best interest for us. And when we go beyond the limits He gave us, He always forgives us but punishment goes along with that forgiveness. This is where so many think that once forgiven nothing is required of us. But we are supposed to make amends for what we did in some way or another. Privately or publicly which ever the case may be. This is being a good christian and living a good life. God bless you.|`|7qTKREOmaa	It is fear. If bad things didn't happen, then people would have no reason to fear. Therefore there would be no reason for any kind of deities because people started believing in gods when bad things would happen. They thought if the gods were happy, then nothing bad would happen. If They weren't afraid of things then they wouldn't think there was something to protect them from bad things.|`|7d49ddbf3b36edeb5a77c20235621a44aa	it's unfortunate but a predominant part of what drives religion is reward and punishment just Pavlov discovered with his experiments or BF Skinner discovered with his pigeons .

Religion is a set of beliefs and practices followed by those committed to the service and worship of God. The first commandment requires us to believe in God, to worship and serve him, as the first duty of the virtue of religion.|`|836c6e132fae41eb80ae1909882962c3aa	wyeld C......Many many people practice "Religions" and they accept the "Processions" or at least practice them and then they "feel" reverant, Holy.  It's unfortunate that they are not able to see that this "Feeling" means nothing.  The Bible does NOT state you are saved if you "Feel" holy.  The Bible tells us to "KNOW" God through His Son, Jesus Christ.<br>  <br>  "Religion" is a man-made process of worship and nothing more.  In many cases, it is the idea that if I do this or that, I will be Holy and acceptable to God.  That is the Fallacy.....of this idea!!!<br>  <br>  WHen the Bible speaks of "Fear", it means that you should be "Reverant" before God.  Think on this for a moment!!  God created everything, He can change the way you think or act if He so chose.  The very next breath you take is given to you by God, because He Loves you.  "Religion" can not do any of this!!!<br>  <br>  Hindus, Buddists, Shintoists, Catholics, Methodists, Baptists, NONE of them will enter into Heaven, if they have not "Willingly" gone to the Cross of Jesus Christ, confessed their sin and ask for "Forgiveness".  Jesus Christ IS the only way to the Father, which is in Heaven!!!  I don't care how "Religious" you are or are not, or how much money you give the church or how much volunteer work you do.  It makes no differance if you are attentive during worship service, or how pretty or handsome you look, or how popular you are.  If you have NOT gone to the Cross of Jesus Christ, admitted your sinful nature, asked for Forgiveness truthfully, then you are NOT saved, you will spend Eternity in Hell........I did NOT say this.....the Bible does!!!!<br>  <br>  I don't care if anyone wants to scoff or whatever, this is the Truth!!!<br>  <br>  The Bible is your Guide, the Words given to us by God.  It is meant to show us how to be saved and go to Heaven and it teaches us how we should live our lives everyday.  EXAMPLE;  In the days when the Isrealites were running around the middle east, the Bible says that God told them what to eat and what they shouldn't.  This was to make sure that these people did not eat something that could cause disease and death.<br>  <br>  SO this then shows that God loves them and wants the best for them, that is LOVE from God.  We as the people should be "Reverant" to God, after all He is the Creator of everything, right??  So the Word FEAR means to be "Reverant".  Love in return!!<br>  <br>  The Bible is a guide in terms of what is RIGHT and what Is NOT.  WHat is GOOD and what is EVIL and how to tell the differance, how to avoid conflict and what is trully JUSTICE.|`|xPeIvywdaa	respect is admiration or fear for somthing<br>  <br>  Christians admire God because of the love He gives|`|V8TFzhYZaa	"Religion" literally means "to be tied or bound again" - the root word is the same as that for "ligament." <br>  <br>  Religion is a social mechanism for restraining people so that their actions can be controlled.|`|rYCud1IQaa	Ashley-Anne made me rofl.

To any more global immigration, and make it even harder for any person to migrate to our country. <br>  <br>  We have witnessed what this has done to other countries and we don't want it in our back yards. Or people in our country who disrespect our culture, customs, laws, traditions, people and our free society. <br>  <br>  Being a small populated country Australian film,sport, entertainment is world known same as for our actors, entertainers, performers, models, bands, solo artist, writers, painters, fashion designers, etc, etc. just as our film and television industry has set it's mark globally.<br>  <br>   As we are not a poor country in recession or with foreign debts, with very high global exports and mineral wealth we don't need any other countries to supply with natural energy or imports. Our country is financially prospering, with wealth and employment, in our financial markets, tourism and new business. <br>  <br>  As the USA falls further in debt, more films are being produced and made outside the USA. With having so many home grown globally known actors and new talent, our film industry has flourished as well all of our television programs dramas, comedy's and soaps are being bought and shown in countries all over the world. <br>  <br>  Many well known overseas actors and entertainers are moving to Australia due to available work in our country in film and television. Also many people might not realize almost all the film studios and cinemas, in the USA are Australian owned. (Google it). <br>  <br>  We don't do too bad for a country the size of the USA with just only 20 million people, which has invented many things which people around the world use everyday.

(unsurprisingly meaning half...) at least the US is a "melting pot of cultures" and there are probably a huge population of foreign and mixed race people (compared to japan at least!!!). if people come up to you and question your nationality, just smile and ignore them if you like. although they're just curious you don't have to spill out a long list of nationalities to please them, you could just say " it's complicated" or something. i think it's kind of weird and sort of demeaning when people ask me for what fraction of me is australian and japanese... so you should avoid answering those types of questions... i don't really think race matters when i meet someone new :)<br>  <br>  oh and i just found out recently that i'm also possibly spanish and irish.... here we go again|`|Q440sUWqaa	well i am not bi racial but i am not multi cultural and very proud.

I do not believe in hell as the christians do, nor do I believe in a God that would send us to that type of place.

From my own personal experience, I believe there are stages to go through before you will become emotionally comfortable with your new world view.<br>  <br>  When I became atheist, there was an initial rush of excitement. The whole world was new to me as I looked at it in a whole new light. It's like being a newborn baby and discovering it all over again.<br>  <br>  But after about a year or two, I realized that there were some missing spaces inside of me that religion used to fill. Some of the questions we hear all the time from theists are indeed valid questions that you will need to find new answers for.  like "What is the point of life". And "what is the source of morality".<br>  <br>  This is a dangerous phase where you will be tempted to fall back on the easy, familiar answers of religion. But you have to push through this phase. Talk to other atheists and ask them about their experiences and feelings.<br>  <br>  After a while you will emerge from that phase with all the holes filled. And suddenly life makes sense again, and you realize that you are free.<br>  <br>  At least that's my experience.

Bq0gqw7qaa	In order for it to be immoral, one must consider the act itself.<br>  <br>    When you thumb someone up/down without reading what they have to say because you previously liked/disliked other things they have posted, in effect you're judging their character not their answer.<br>   <br>     Is this "wrong to do"? Well in effect the forum is designed for Q&A and the thumbs down/up feature is designed to, and does serve a purpose if properly used. So misusing it would seem to be "wrong to do" to me and I am a self professed moral objectivist. When I offer you this submission I do so suggesting this is not merely my personal ethical subjectivism, my relative moral assessment, I contend that it is in fact "wrong to do"<br>  <br>    I think that I would be offended if someone thumbed me up or down without reading what I had to say regarding the question and this feeling is a clue to me as to the immorality of misusing the priveledge by pre-judging answers without considering them.<br>  <br>    Of course circumstances and intent always affect the moral culpability of the individual. So in this case considering there are many people that misuse the forum regarding their Q&A's and there are people that establish paterns of rudeness or down rite illogical off topic silliness or personal opinions, generic copy and paste novels and the like it would be a moral act that was bad but not that bad.  <br>  <br>    If you know it's wrong to do and choose to do it anyway, then it becomes sin (if you believe in that stuff). A well informed and properly functioning conscience governed by natural law should guide you in this matter.<br>  <br>    Your inferred guilt of hypocracy regarding everyones right to their opinion should also be a flag.<br>  <br>  EDIT; I'm diggin' your super bike avatar BTW|`|qSHO1wQtaa	I read most answers before I thumbs them down.

If it's been done by a man, then I suppose there may be some measure of being gay, but unless you imagine that you're doing it, or you fantasise about sex with men, then you're probably nearer to being straight.<br>  Hope this helps

d0945a07b59dce3ca7393bc610216aa9aa	Reincarnation represents the Rosetta stone of Jesus' ministry which clarifies his teachings and reveals the mystery of life itself. The early Christian church modified his teachings to better fit the Roman and Greek religions, which we now call "mythology." Reincarnation was and is an integral part of ancient Jewish mysticism, however, over which Christianity had no control. <br>  <br>  The early church edited, rewrote and redefined Christianity to place itself as the mediator between "God" and mankind. Only a few fragments of truth remain but they are clearly there: e.g., WHO sinned, THIS MAN or his parents, that HE BE BORN BLIND?... TRULY, LITERALLY, YOU MUST BE BORN AGAIN. <br>  <br>  History provides proof, too. As the Dead Sea scrolls reveal, John the Baptist was a member of the Essene sect of Judaism; Essenes were one of many Jewish sects that taught reincarnation. Jewish mysticism has always taught that reincarnation is true, since before the time of Jesus, and there is no doubt that Jesus was a Jewish mystic. Baptism originated as symbolic of reincarnation, of being dead and rising up in physical rebirth (water) to live again. To be baptized signified a metaphorical reincarnation and its promise of a new *physical* (not just spiritual) life. <br>  <br>  When John's cousin Jesus was baptized, to Jews of his acquaintance it was symbolic of Jesus' soul having returned in a new state of being. <br>  <br>  There is nothing in the bible that "disproves" reincarnation. The oft-quoted "It is appointed that men die once and face judgment" has no connection to rebirth. As the "man" is dead, the people who use this quote - what exactly do they think hangs around to face judgment? Could it be that non-corporeal part of that person, usually referred to as the soul? Of course. And the *soul* is what reincarnates - not "the man."<br>  <br>  It is the soul that survives death, the soul that "faces judgment" and the soul that is reborn in a new body. <br>  <br>  Although re-writers of the NT essentially presented Jesus as a zombie rather than a soul reborn in a brand new body, the soul does not return to the old physical body to reanimate the corpse. "Resurrection" is how the men who didn't understand his mysteries interpreted Jesus' teachings on reincarnation. He stressed separation of body and soul, but the resurrection believers couldn't comprehend that distinction.<br>  <br>  "Judgment" faced at death is contemplation of your previous life, your failures and successes. This contemplation (self judgment) is a fundamental Jewish concept. "Hell" is a Christian invention. Jews believe that there is a period of contemplation after death. This is "the judgment." Christians often ignore the fact that Jesus was Jewish, in particular an Essene Jew. Even the Pope, however, recently admitted that Jesus followed the Essene calendar, according to when he celebrated "the last supper's" Passover. <br>  <br>  Essenes naturally followed the Essene calendar, and Essenes believed in reincarnation, baptism, which are things Jesus actually would have taught.<br>  <br>  Other bible verses contradict the single, solitary "man dies but once" verse. Paul wrote, "I die daily." There's a reference in the NT to "the second death." Clearly other bible verses disagree with the "once" remark. However, it's the "faces judgment" portion that brings the verse into focus as a reference to the continuing soul (which is what reincarnates into a new body).<br>  <br>  This Isaiah verse that Christians slap on every question about reincarnation at YA may refer to zombies, but not to the return of the eternal soul in a new body -- which is what Jesus believed in and attempted to teach. Apparently he failed. Fortunately, reincarnation requires no belief. You return whether you believe in reincarnation or not. Awareness of one's eternal journey is not necessary in order to continue learning and perfecting the spirit. <br>  <br>  "Be ye therefore perfect even as your father in heaven is perfect," Jesus instructed his followers. He didn't say 'hey, do your best,' or 'if you just believe I existed that's enough...' He said BE AS PERFECT AS GOD IS. Jesus indicated, according to the bible, that absolute perfection is within the reach of every human when he made the statement, YE ARE GODS. <br>  <br>  Anyone with a functioning mind should be able to comprehend that perfection and godliness cannot be attained in a single lifetime and that unbiased examination of historical fact is evidence that Jesus was a reincarnationist.|`|db7df25ea31227e5641d5c32d43c3bcdaa	no our souls are eternal<br>  <br>  we live on earth once there is no reincarnation|`|641c55ed860a473abbc5c57c2b35186aaa	I am a Christian and I believe in reincarnation.  I believe that just as animals have evolved over the years that our souls evolve also.  With each life we live we are tested and put through trials to learn lessons ultimately perfecting our souls for eternal salvation in heaven.<br>  <br>  I also believe that the bible explains that we are reincarnated, but those with closed minds cannot receive this truth.|`|GGtWK3R4aa	Our souls don't only live once because it lives for all eternity. It is eternal. As for reincarnation, I do believe in it. <br>  <br>  In the beginning, we are all part of God. But as S/He gave us freewill, we began doing bad deeds. Because of this, we have to pay for whatever we do, whether it is bad or good. That's what Jesus meant by "What you reap is what you sow". So then we started reincarnating over and over in order to pay for our mistakes. It is called karma. And as we cleanse our souls through karma, we are starting to become one with God again, just like what lord Buddha did. In the end, we will be cleansed totally, stop reincarnating, and return to our great loving God.<br>  <br>  By the way, the New Testament also mentioned reincarnation in some ways. Read Matthew 17:12-13. Lord Jesus Christ was talking about Elias and his reincarnation St. John the Baptist. That's just one of the readings. There are more verses in the Bible which pertains to reincarnation.|`|P5rczL0Saa	Your soul never dies. It's the same one always. It either goes to Heaven or to Hell after you die.

Of course, I said "no."|`|DkVqOe8Iaa	Ok...this may sound like the most exaggerated story ever but believe me it really did happen!<br>  <br>  I was walking down a residential street one night (around about 20:15) with my sister and friend. We were messing around; dancing about and singing; when next thing three cars that were driving along the road beside us stopped. Each car was full. So altogether there were around 15 guys between the three cars. They were trying to get us to go in their cars and after about 10 seconds of getting over the shock of what we were seeing. We all ran for it! One of the cars reversed back and drove after us but thankfully the road was a dead end and we managed to get away.<br>  <br>  Another story...A couple of years ago...I was walking along a lane with my sis again and a friend (not the same one that was in the first incident) we got halfway along the lane when a gang of about 5/6 boys ran towards us. They were running so fast they nearly ran straight into us. Anyway we continued to walk along and we were just getting to the end of the lane when we heard a loud bang, like an explosion. Because of the noise we all looked to see what it was and well it all happened so quickly but all I can remember is seeing a big dark shape come hurtling towards us. I can remember something/someone pushing me back. I don't know what....then the big dark shape went "flying" past us. I then remember looking to see what it was and realized it was a police car. They had been chasing the boys who had nearly ran into us and the explosion like noise we heard was the car braking and just about losing control to try and avoid hitting us. If we hadn't heard that noise and continued to work we would have been hit!<br>  <br>  I was also nearly knocked over by a lorry when I was a baby in my pram! However because I was really young, I can't remember exactly what happened.

I've been through a colonoscopy three times and I haven't starved yet. It's unusual that the nurse told you liquid for so many days; it's usually only the day before, but you have to refrain from aspirin for 4-7 days to avoid bleeding. Keep busy. If you keep your mind on other things, the time will pass. Have you started the laxative regimen yet? That'll take your mind off of food for sure.<br>  P.S.~ I don't believe Instant oatmeal, made soupy.<br>  Powdered protein drink, Yogurt or ice cream are allowed before the procedure. Anything colored red or purple are off limits as well. Good Luck. It could be worse!|`|AA12382612	Why are you on a clear liquid diet for 3 days? You need to call your physician.

If you are referring to a weight reduction liquid fasting intake, that is not a "clear liquid diet," but it's still not healthy, and a real thing of the past.

They should give you a hand up if they can find it in their hearts.  I have seen clear liquid in the infant isle of the grocery store...but I have no idea if that is good for an adult.<br>  <br>  Why not just eat a banana & get yourself a bowl of chili until your inerds get adjusted to the emptiness?  I'm guessing you MUST do this to yourself for medical or religious reasons (Iwon't pry)...or you just wouldn't starve on a beautiful day like today.  <br>  <br>  You could also burn a bundle of sage & ly down in a cool dark room until the pain subsides.|`|fc61095727fe8a17ac058f0c1b8e3bf2aa	Popsickles, beef and chicken broth, seven up or sprite, tea, orange jello. None of these really stick to the ribs. I cant imagine this many days on a clear diet. Most colonoscopies just require 24 hours on liquid diet and taking something to "clean you out".|`|6IooffjFaa	Fruit juices might be good.  I like fruit flavored herbal teas with sugar or honey.  Hang in there!|`|FcZU29W6aa	I have never heard of a clear liquid diet requiring that many days.  Are you sure you understood the directions?<br>  <br>  I am a retired x-ray tech and the prep for a colonoscopy was a clear liquid diet for 24 hours before the procedure.  You also take a liquid prescription that helps clear out the colon.<br>  <br>  Don't have anything that is red in color, but you can have orange Popsicles or any popsicles that are not red.  As far as jello, lime or orange would be fine.  And you can have bullion, chicken, beef, or vegetable.<br>  <br>  I am not sure where you live, but where I am it is Sunday morning.  If you can't reach your physician, call the hospital and double check on this clear liquid diet and the time period.  It should not take longer than 24 hours to clean out your colon.|`|0rpN2419aa	3 days of clear liquid diet is common after some surgeries.  Have you had surgery?  Or are you preparing your body for a procedure that will take place at a hospital or clinic?  <br>  I was on a clear liquid diet when I had a diverticular infection, however, I was in the hospital getIrv's IV's at the same diet.<br>  I could have chicken broth, jello as long as it wasn't red, tea with no cream or sugar, apple juice....it is pretty boring after many days on it.  Hope whatever is going on with you improves quickly.
H8WqMK1eaa	That could be the case...or it could be dried out.<br>  <br>  Take it out...soak it in some cleaner, then lightly fold it between your finger tips...if it looks like a taco (with the edges slightly inward) then it should be right and you can simply try again.|`|wYBur7c7aa	If it doesn't feel how it should then just take it out, clean it and then put it back in. There really is no backwards type thing, like you can tell which way it should go in. If you need any more help go onto your contact brand website and most likely they will have a video on everything you have a question about.
gGZz2EGyaa	Yes I did know that charcoal ( or black dog biscuits) was good for stomach ailments and about having a pee on your chilblains.

Still can't deny it done me no harm.|`|XEbrGfZuaa	There were three things mom would push me to eat. One was freshly<br>  cooked spinach. The other was fried liver and onions.

My mom was overly strict. If I didn't finish my dinner, I had<br>  to go straight to my room. And go to bed as punishment. This could<br>  be during the height of summer, when it was too warm to sleep or even<br>  try, with the daylight shining in.<br>     It was on nights like that, that my best friend would come down to<br>  play, and I couldn't leave my room. So I would entertain her, by read-<br>  ing her golden book stories, and show her the pictures. That gave us<br>  alot of entertainment. My mom only interrupted us once.

It includes celebrations of Christ's entry in Jerusalem (Palm Sunday), his last meal with his disciples (Maundy Thursday), his passion and death (Good Friday), his Resurrection (Easter Saturday/Sunday night vigil) and his encounters with his disciples (Easter Sunday and following week).<br>  <br>  There is no historical evidence of any connection to paganism. The date of Easter derives form the Jewish Passover around which time the events are said to have occurred,|`|f24a4de342b1375dc37e91955d32d1a1aa	Rabbits and eggs are both symbols of the fertility goddess Eostre/Ishtar/Ostara. Her symbol is also the moon, in which some cultures see a rabbit instead of a face. Eggs also symbolize the moon and are the ultimate symbol of creation and new life. The basket is a symbol of the womb in which this new life is carried.<br>  <br>  The feast day is pagan and was widely celebrated way before the time of Jesus. Like pretty much all holidays, it was adopted by Christians to help get more converts. However, since the point is to celebrate new life and the hope of continuance, Christian symbols of a Resurrection day and the old pagan symbols mean the same thing.

They depend on the fertility of their farm animals not just for food, but also for the muscle power to pull the plow and the grindstone, and they depend on the fertility of their own bodies to produce sons who can labor in the fields and daughters who can fetch dowries. So natural religions generally center on fertility—of everything in the field, the barn, and the marriage bed. In a fertility religion, the greatest good is marriage and bearing children. This can lead to gross immorality, as happened in the middle east in ancient times, because infertile people sought a remedy in the arms of the priests and priestesses—and it became a religious act, because by having union with the priest or priestess, they were communing with the pagan fertility god. The Old and New Testament writers constantly condemned this, because for them it was a contemporaneous practice. Isaiah 56:3-5 even prophesies of a future time in which the infertile would no longer be outcasts.<br>  <br>  In the British Isles and Germany, the spring fertility festival involved eggs and bunnies, because they are natural symbols of fertility, and it also involved worshipping trees. The Christian missionaries who brought Christianity to the British Isles and to Germany suffered quite a lot of grief at the hands of our ancestors when they chopped down the sacred trees to demonstrate that they weren’t gods. Since the people did not actually worship the bunnies and eggs, the missionaries figured they could just Christianize them. So the custom began of painting Christian art on eggshells and they just tolerated the bunnies. I guess they would be greatly saddened if they could see that the eggs and the bunnies once again overshadow the cross.<br>  <br>  It is common for missionaries to incorporate existing traditions into Christianity, wherever it’s possible to do so without compromising the faith, because it isn’t practical or necessary to abolish a native culture, along with all its festivals and folkways, just to introduce Christianity. For this reason, Christmas is called ‘Yule’ in Nordic countries—‘Yule’ is the name of the winter-solstice holiday that Christmas supplanted. In the same way, English-speaking Christians retain the name ‘Easter’ for the holy day that is called Passover by Greek-speaking Christians.<br>  <br>  nfd?|`|4b21006f14999f52b2e85e092542486baa	The Easter Bunny comes from a German idea of the Easter Hare which brings eggs in the spring.<br>  <br>  The eggs come from the fact that Christians used to fast from eating eggs during Lent, the 40 days of fasting before Easter.<br>  <br>  The hare is associated with eggs via on old folk story about hares laying eggs. This probably arose because European hares raise their young in forms - nests in the open fields. They do not make burrows like rabbits do. These forms look a bit like some birds nests and its is also thought that some birds will use hares forms as nests and lay their eggs in them.<br>  <br>  The stories about pagan origins were made up in the 19th and 20th centuries. There is nothing in the historical record to support the idea.|`|e9bv4ijlaa	This is what I heard, it was when the children of a rich family were having the easter egg hunt,one of the children saw a rabbit sitting on an egg of course the rabbit fled when it saw the child coming leaving behind the egg .Of course the child told the story to everyone saying that an easter bunny left them eggs. That's legend of the easter bunny as I know it,don't know the truth in it but like I said that's how I heard it.|`|94a46d94405353b1f3f1de9ec8eeca2aaa	Its origin is disputed but the character was mentioned as early as 1600; some trace it to alleged pre-Christian fertility lore,[1] others to the role of the hare in Christian iconography.|`|Sd3kXRgGaa	Lol I know, how much sense does that make?<br>  <br>  "Well, Jesus rose from the dead ... what should we do?"<br>  "How about a bunny hiding eggs?"<br>  "Yea, that fits great!"|`|Lvz3x1ycaa	if you need to about easter bunny go on

Even in the deepest depths of recession the milk of human kindess shone through the darkness, and that to me was a beautiful thing.That is until I realised these helpful people were always men and the helpful things tended to happen on days when I was dressed up nice.

ozwLZwXeaa	I find your question really fascinating. If I were as educated as you are and have the experience you have, I would start making a few phone calls to find out where in your city there are discussion groups on all the subjects you would like to debate and discuss. They are everywhere in big cities it is just finding out where they meet is the troubling thing. Call the city offices and let them know your desires and see what happens. People like you are a blessing as long as your attitude isn't to abrasive towards others. Learning from each other about your points of view would be so great. Make that call.|`|nwnILcEAaa	Yes, often catch myself over-talking because I miss the casual conversations with co-workers and others at work. You have some good suggestions here, but also, how about learning Espanol? You might be surprised how much that could help you.|`|8G42oyydaa	I understand, it can be hard to be isolated and when you get a chance to talk everything you have been hoarding up just comes flooding out of you.   I am wondering if there is a discussion group in your area, you know something like a theological group but something that suits your interests?  Maybe you could even start one yourself. The hard part would of course be weeding out those who DONT have much to contribute to the group.  But I think they would just get bored and leave after awhile. <br>  <br>  Maybe you could get involved with a political group of the same ilk as you.  This is a tough one !  One suggestion is you might meet like minded people at a library, see who is in what sections. <br>  <br>  You are conscious of your tendency to over talk, when you catch yourself apologize and say "I dont get out much". <br>  <br>  Also you should develop the patience to listen to other people, talk about things that you arent necessarily interested in or fascinated with but if you dont do that, and monopolize a conversation, change the subject to something you are interested in people ARE going to think you are rude and boorish and avoid you. DONT preach, DONT try to make others agree with you.<br>  <br>  Like it or not other people DO have the right to talk about what interests them, having a friend means being a friend. And that is listening and caring about what your friends think, feel and have to say.|`|bf4cc388616ba9cb48357f54373c609eaa	Welcome to the club, Jack. Like me, you probably spent years with a lot of people and now retired, you are socially isolated. Yahoo Answers is a good outlet and provides you with the opportunity to communicate with a lot of people in a large part of the world. I am forever indebted to the great people in this section of YA ( Yahoo Answers ). Many of them are, I think, across the pond and I know they are scattered all across the U S. With such a large geographic region to draw from, you have the opportunity to communicate with many people from all walks of life.<br>     Rest assured that now in retirement you have broadened your commonality with a vast number of people who in the past you would have had nothing in common. <br>    You may also recognize that you now have the opportunity to communicate with people who will be around in a hundred years or so.  Granted, this is somewhat of a one-way communication at this time, for obvious reasons. But you must work with what you have. Someday you may have a descendant who will call your "Epistle of Jack" the finest link to the past that they could possibly hope for in all worlds.  Get on your computer and start a letter to an unknown descendant. In each person there is one good book. How would you like to be able to sit down and read a book written by your Great-Great Grandfather about his life. Wouldn't it be interesting to read what he had to say regarding his values and the life that he made for himself? Why don't you do for a descendant what you wish an ancestor had done for you?  No, your Epistle of Jack, probably will not become a best seller, but would you care about how your ancestor's writing  was received by the general public? Write your Epistle to that one person in the future that would be extremely appreciative. I assure you there will be such an individual. Begin with day one and expand enough to answer any question about you and other individuals in your family that you have known or that you are familiar with now. If you write enough to answer any question that might come up, you might write furiously for the rest of your life.  From time to time, bind your missive and deposit a copy in the Dallas Public Library Genealogy Collection; State Library and Archives Genealogy Department in Austin; and in every local library where you and your people have made a home for yourselves for any length of time. .<br>    This should keep you busy for the rest of your life, and you can devote as much or as little time as you wish. Just do it for someone that will love and respect your efforts a hundred years from now. I believe that this would be more fulfilling than being a greeter at Wal-Mart but don't totally reject that idea, either. I invite you to go to my profile by clicking on my avatar and read my answers,and you will see how I have let off steam and enjoyed this site. My collection will at least put you to sleep on those nights when you can't seem to get back to sleep.  I will have you nodding off in no time.|`|23d4e5541c3e44e5449602e6ac5d7671aa	Have you thought about community college? I realize you are already educated as you stated, but perhaps you could take a class in communications, debate, economics, political science, etc. It would be a good way to meet people and perhaps indulge in a little friendly debate. I'm sure you're probably aware, but the night courses tend to have the more mixed group of ages as opposed to the days classes that are mostly filled with people fresh out of high school.<br>  Maybe give it a shot??|`|qGw6FSY8aa	Find an educated website with people who like to talk about the same things you do.<br>  <br>  Eons<br>   Daily Strength<br>  <br>   " boomers website" in any of your search engines and a few will come up|`|AA12382612	You are out of your element, and out of self-esteem, and . . . friends. When we are isolated, our friends move or die, our lives change, too - there's no give and take with those who we once knew so well, and we all accepted easily over the years. Plus, friends do change as they age, too - and all aren't as easy to get along with because we lose some of the common interests we once shared, like "the kids," jobs, spouses, traveling, camping, shopping, golf, etc. It's developmental, and you must be willing to either consider making new friends, or finding pasttimes you really enjoy doing by yourself- there is nothing wrong with that, either, if you are happy. You need to be so busy, your son will have to "catch" you for coffee at Cafe Brazil (even if you're not that busy yet, in fact - it's none of his business)! <br>  <br>  Big D is an easy place to "die" in and so is much of Texas, but once you find a peer group you can grow where you are planted. Seniors are a rare commodity in Texas, they hide them somewhere. It's 180 degrees different from the coastal cities, for some darned reason - no transportation, is my guess.<br>  <br>  Get to the libraries, take in some lectures and visit their wonderful museums, take a course to be a docent (volunteer) in some of them (you'll learn a lot in just the training), take some health courses at the American Heart Association or other health group there, or volunteer -- at Parkland, Presby, or Baylor, the Zoo, any non-profit, at anything you do well or just want to do, regardless of your age - ignore it. If you take a course at the local CC, you'll be amazed at how much the students like you!<br>  <br>  But, you must force yourself to follow through so people get to know you - initial relationships are always full of "surface tension" so give things time, relax, "let go" of impressions about others, and yourself, and keep it up - don't miss meetings, events, or classes with others b/c you'll have to start all over again. No one is perfect, so get that out of your head, not even in "Big D." <br>  <br>  If you cannot "go out and jog" because of a disability, call the local Advocacy Center and tell them you need to be able to integrate with humans more easily, and need help. . . they'll refer you to something, or someone, or contact the Arthritis Foundation there, or AARP in Dallas - In Texas dial 211 and you'll get a bunch of resources to help you get started. The Y has a marvelous swim program for seniors, and others, at all levels, and "water" is healing.<br>  <br>  Now, also call the Mental Health Association in Dallas, and make an appointment for an assessment - you deserve it for yourself. Just tell them them the truth, you're feeling isolated, and on "a desert island" - it's never too late to do something for yourself. But, you'll have to regain some self-esteem to get yourself out of the rut you dug into - but remember, "let go," don't bother about what others say, even if you know the answer, including what your son says or does. Just nod, and read. . . You'll enjoy the coming spring days a lot more. The Azalea Festival will be coming up - get ready to go to that! It's a lovely event.|`|SfGyzMSFaa	My dad and my father-in-law have gone through something very similar to what you describe when they retired. There have been days that I've spent close to 2 hours in a single phone conversation with my dad. Sit dad down at a table full of people, of any age, and he'll not only participate in the conversation, but share advice and tell stories for hours. I haven't reached retirement age yet, but twice I have gone from a very structured job surrounded by people and very stimulating work, to being at home and far more isolated. I find it helps if you can add a bit of structure by doing things that are interesting and require you to periodically do something on a schedule.<br>  <br>  Here are a few ideas:<br>  <br>  I recently asked a question about people who have done remarkable things after they've retired. Rosebud described a friend of hers who had retired due to heart problems. This friend started taking water aerobic classes, and then became an instructor. She now has her own business specializing in exercise for the elderly and people with physical disabilities. Stella answered that her husband became a volunteer museum guide, and also designed and maintained the museum's web page, he is enjoying this unpaid work.<br>  <br>  I agree with those who suggest taking classes. Since you live in an urban area I bet there are plenty of low cost or even free options, and the variety of classes offered is likely huge. I have audited a class at a local unversity in the past. Right now; I'm taking a 'blended class'; it begins with an online class that I do on my own schedule and ends with a series of discussions that I will attend in person.<br>  <br>  Have you ever considered joining a Toastmasters Club? Doing your own speaking and also serving as an evaluator, grammarian, etc is a great way to use and share your gift of the gab...:)<br>  <br>  There are other social clubs that might strike your fancy; check out your local daily newspaper, weekly journals, or tv station websites for listings of local clubs. <br>  <br>  Learn a new hobby, do some volunteer work, serve on your city's advisory boards; the possibilities are endless. The important things are 1) Doing something that you find engaging. 2) Overcoming the fear of doing something new, be willing to try something and not feel bad if it doesn't work out. 3) Finding the right balance between structure/comittment and your energy level/freedom.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you!|`|y7HD8unTaa	Oh I feel your pain Brother...I feel your pain!<br>  That's why I enjoy using Yahoo!Answers & getting to find out I'm not alone & that there really are some people in my age range who have lead a similar lifestyle.

AA12382612	Yes. I've used it for a long time. You don't need a separate telephone, in my experience. <br>  <br>  Also, you need to be realistic about the total cost of MagicJack. It's fine considering the low cost, but one has to remember, we pay for our cable or DSL to transmit the MJ, so once that cost is averaged in, long distance, per se is still not a bargain. It should really team up with the cable and DSL Internet companies for a better option all around. But, do American corporations give a hoot about saving the consumer money? I doubt it.|`|XEbrGfZuaa	We've had a Magic Jack for a few weeks now. And yesterday, due to<br>  some glitch in our cable or wiring, we were without phone use until<br>  in the wee hours of this morning. It was very frustrating, not being able<br>  to get onto the internet. Maybe that's why the phone company said<br>  they would keep our file available awhile, in case they need to reactiv-<br>  ate it. When I left the computer on for several days and nights, I had<br>  a slow running computer. So now I turn it off and one of us turns it<br>  back on in the early morning, before anyone might call. <br>    It is a cheaper mode of phone service than that other one that goes<br>  through your computer. I suppose I was a bit naive, to not realize I<br>  might have some headaches to go along with the cheaper price.<br>  EDIT: The other service was Vonage. But you can't use it<br>  unless you have a dial up ISP. So we don't have that option<br>  at the present time with our faster speed modem.|`|y7HD8unTaa	The name alone is enough to keep me away.

All that $40 coupon got me was the price that they are currently selling them for out the door without the coupons.  <br>  <br>  I don't want any more electronic gadgets in my personal space...they give me a headache & the lights flash all night long.

But then I found out I'd have to have THEIR phone number they supplied.  Problems there:<br>  (a) I'd have to notify MANY people about the phone number change (a real headache since more people have my land line number than my cell number)<br>  (b) They didn't have my area code available (757) and the closest one was 50 miles away. Thus anyone in my area code who calls me would be charged for long distance.<br>  I cancelled it, sent it back and got my money refunded.<br>  I have Vonage, which I'm not overly fond of because when THEY'RE busy, my computer access to web sites slows down.  <br>  If my computer has problems, I'd have no land line.

Tledw3eAaa	If you mean physical fight... I've only really had one true fight. I believe it was all the way back in the third or fourth grade. I was in the wrong, she challenged me to a fight over it after school got out. While I probably deserved to lose, it didn't get to that point. We made a deal not to hit each others faces, and punched and kicked each other everywhere else, until we were too bruised and exhausted to keep going. At which point we decided to be friends. lol. I haven't fought since then.<br>  <br>  If you mean just an arguement though... it was a few days ago, with my boss. The same thing that always happens happened. I make my point, I give mathematical evidence to support my point of view... but you cannot win an arguement with someone who believes she is always right. Nor can you win an argument with someone who denies their previous statements. Nor can you give mathematical proof to someone who uses an excel sheet to do basic math, and does not understand that if the formula is wrong the answer is as well. <br>  <br>  So the outcome was... I went back to my desk and resolved to stop caring about the business when I didn't get paid care.

Did you know that many Catholics don't know that they are all 'Christians.'  The word Christian first came into being when Evangelicals started using it for people who had been 'born again.'  If you haven't been born again, according to them, you can't be a Christian.  In fact, anyone who believes in Jesus is a Christian ... to become a Catholic, you must first be a Christian, then be baptized (any Christian church) and confirmed in the Catholic faith.  The Evangelicals and Charismatics do not 'own' the word Christian ... it has been around for many more years, but wasn't used in the way they use it, and I suggest the best way to 'get it back' into the more common usage is to tell people about it every chance you get!  |`|G4SwEHP5aa	Ignorant Atheists and ignorant Christians took up with torch..|`|799756bd4c88f2ce87a508802ca1e9cdaa	People who TELL THE TRUTH!|`|AA12343309	Probably because there are so many Protestant denominations that they use the words "Protestant" and "Christian" generically to define themselves, particularly if they don't belong to a specific Protestant faith.<br>  <br>  As a Catholic, I will always say Catholic and other Christians.  |`|el8yX5q3aa	Chris....HOW DARE you criticize any religion unless it is RADICAL muslim!  God is God and as a Catholic we do believe in Jesus and we believe in God and we like all religions have our good people and bad people in it.

You are not living God's word.  He said honor thy neighbor and you are disrespecting everyone who does not agree with you.  With YOUR ARROGANCE and YOUR RIGIDITY and YOUR JUDGEMENT you won't see heaven either.  God is the only one to Judge buddy...NOT YOU!  You are NOT living up to the teachings of God or Jesus or the Bible! <br>  <br>  How did you get so much hatred in you?  Hatred is Satan's work...did you know that?  Not loving people who are different from you is SATAN'S work...did you know THAT?  <br>  <br>  You better pray and ask for forgiveness buddy....God doesn't need someone to tell him how to run his business or how to judge people...especially a mortal man!  <br>  <br>  As a Catholic and just as a good person I will pray that God sees your mistakes as immaturity and ask him to help you grow into a person that can pass on and live his word.<br>  <br>  God Bless you Chris.  I hope you don't treat your whole life as you speak now...you will be totally unhappy and lonely.<br>  <br>  And Bebe or whoever you are...there are alcoholics and abusers and theives and everything In EVERY religion just like NON Catholics.  <br>  <br>  You can see fallen leaders all over...not just Catholics.

You are like Chris....I will pray for you too.<br>  <br>  Some of you are so ignorant.....so very ignorant.  Where did all this hatred come from?  Why are you so threatened by what we believe and how we believe?  God is all that matters....not how YOU believe or how we believe...it is your own personal relationship with God .  God knows you heart and your intentions...and if they are evil.....like some of you have evil thoughts here....God knows the difference.  You can deny all you want...but you can't fool God.  He alone will ask you why you hate what he made and for what reason!  If he could forgive those that killed his son....why can't you forgive and have tolerance for those that believe differently than you?  We forgive you for being hateful.

Those two groups (and I'm sure some of them will post an answer to your question) seem to be obsessed with "proving" that Catholics are wrong. <br>  <br>  That way, they can exclude us from their version of the Christian Good Old Boys Club until we shape up and buy the fundamentalist party line. They've got some serious control issues, and their belief system is too rigid to permit diversity.<br>  <br>  Bottom line: they're trying to justify their own bigotry and hatred of anyone who doesn't agree 100% with their narrow-minded, simplistic version of Christianity.|`|RKhSRMlZaa	The people who protested against certain principles of the Catholic faith--also known as Protestants who are called Evangelical Christians in modern day.  It's not "nonsense."  The Protestants had specific problems with the Catholic Church--that is why Martin Luther posted his "95 Theses" on the door of the Church in 1517.  <br>  <br>  In that time, the Bible was only available in Latin.  The Roman Catholic priests were the only ones who were able to read it, and thus they taught the people what it said and interpreted it for them.  Martin Luther could read it and in doing so found many theological issues with the way the priests were interpreting the Bible.  So he "protested" and because of him the Protestant religion came about.  Some of those people were on the Mayflower and came over to America.  It's basic World History.  <br>  <br>  EDIT:  I am neither Catholic nor Christian, but I've paid attention in History class my whole life.|`|7422ddf097669bd7b6e3d48e56258b87aa	Catholic Christians ARE different than non-Catholic Christians, because Catholics believe and accept all that the Catholic Church teaches and practices, for the purpose of our salvation.<br>  <br>  Non-Catholic Christians believe only what they choose ... which varies widely.<br>  <br>  Viva la difference!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://douglawrence.wordpress.com/" rel="nofollow">http://douglawrence.wordpress.com/</a>|`|0fnzDpKXaa	I never heard it at all until I arrived here either.

Where do people get these ideas?|`|f7fcb6877caa0ad4f41dd9af2258ee0aaa	Obviously Protestants desperate to validate their own existence.  Most Protestants know enough of the Bible to realize that Christ intended all his followers to be members of ONE Church.  It is obvious that their tradition exists in open defiance of the stated will of God.  Therefore some of them seem to think that if they can throw enough trash at the original Christian Church, make it look bad enough, then maybe their rebellion against it can be justified.  Sad.|`|AA11382947	That would have come from some non-Catholic Christians.<br>  <br>  But not all Protestants are so ignorant or misinformed.

However, there are other Catholics who aren't. They may call themselves Christians but don't have a living relationship with Christ."<br>  <br>  .....ugh, what?. <br>  <br>  "Christians don't worship statues like Catholics do, yes they do, and christians don't get drunk in the basement of the church like catholics do, so they are different! Christians don't have saints either!"<br>  ................ugh, what?<br>  <br>  "a Catholic once told me they are different from all other Christians and want to be categorized differently."<br>   <br>  ...........huh?<br>  <br>  Someone is feeding these "flocks" a false teaching. They make these statements because they are totally brainwashed. They do not even research for the correct information (which also is in Scripture?. I assume that is why they are called cherry pickers.....they pick and choose what is convenient for them. <br>  They continue to go by sola scriptura. This was a theory by Martin Luther....a man in the 1521 (?).......and not by what the Fathers of the Church agreed upon. So through the years, they continue to pick apart their separate denominations. They probably do not know anything about Martin Luther. If they would even research him, they would realize that he had veneration of Mary and the Saints, the belief of Mary's Immaculate Conception, her Perpetual Virginity and that Christ is present in the bread and wine of the Eucharist. <br>  <br>  We must pray for them.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  |`|crxbob5jaa	Being a Christian is to be a follower of Christ. There are Catholics who are Christians. However, there are other Catholics who aren't. They may call themselves Christians but don't have a living relationship with Christ. <br>  <br>  In the same manner, there are protestants who aren't Christians, even though they attend church regularly. It's not the church, it's the relationship with Christ that makes a true Christian. <br>  <br>  Many "church people" (Yes, I am one of them) will disagree with me, but the Bible won't. And it's the Bible that counts.|`|JWM1MKa0aa	Have no idea...that's what I'm wondering too! What most people don't understand for a reason which I cannot fathom, is that Catholicism is a denomination of Christianity - there were no different sectors of Christianity until the Protestant Reformation (Martin Luther nailed his 95 Theses to a Church door), then they split as you know.

They loved the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) far more than we do, yet despite that they did not celebrate this day. Hence we do not celebrate this day, in obedience to the command of Allaah Who has commanded us to follow the commands of His Prophet. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): <br>  “And whatsoever the Messenger (Muhammad) gives you, take it; and whatsoever he forbids you, abstain (from it)” [al-Hashr 59:7] <br>  And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “I urge you to adhere to my Sunnah [way] and the way of the Rightly-Guided khaleefahs. Adhere to it and cling tightly to it. And beware of newly-invented matters [in religion], for every newly-invented matter is an innovation and every innovation is a going-astray.” (Narrated by Abu Dawood, al-Sunnah, 3991; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood, no. 3851). <br>  The extent to which a person loves the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) is to be seen in how he follows him with regard to all that he commanded or forbade. That includes following him in not celebrating the day on which he was born. See question no. 5219, 10070. <br>  Whoever wants to venerate the day on which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was born should follow the alternative that is based on Islamic evidence, which is that one should fast on Mondays, not just the day that he was born but every Monday. <br>  It was narrated from Abu Qutaadah al-Ansaari (may Allaah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was asked about fasting on Mondays. He said, “On that day I was born and on that day the Revelation came to me.” (Narrated by Muslim, 1978). On Thursdays deeds are taken up and shown to Allaah. <br>  Conclusion: celebrating the Prophet’s birthday was not prescribed by Allaah or by the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), so it is not permissible for the Muslims to celebrate his birthday, in obedience to the command of Allaah and the command of His Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him). <br>  We ask Allaah to guide you to the Straight Path. <br>  And Allaah knows best.<br>  Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid<br>  so its a bid'aa....<br>  <br>  salam.|`|Bb6fQtl0aa	It is not permissible to celebrate the birthday of the Prophet, peace be upon him. This was an innovated practice that was never taught by the Prophet, peace be upon him, his family, or his Companions.<br>  <br>  And they were foremost in respecting the Messenger of Allaah, peace be upon him, and they did not celebrate his birthday.<br>  <br>  <br>  There is actually a detailed history to how and who introduced this terrible practice.

There is also good and bad in everyone, and even when people do bad things they have reasons why they do them which make sense to them and which don't clash with their conscience.  As a Christian, i'm afraid i found Christians to be hypocritical, uncaring and materialistic, basically very focussed on money and status in society, compared to the non-Christians i knew, so i left the church.  I was probably being very unfair and judging everyone by the people who made the most "noise".<br>  <br>  Just to add something to what you said at the end.  Just because someone's an atheist doesn't mean they don't believe in the ten commandments and so forth.  They still make sense morally to someone who doesn't believe in God.

So they have no excuse whatsoever for not knowing God.  <br>  Rom 1:21   Yes, they knew God, but they wouldn't worship him as God or even give him thanks. And they began to think up foolish ideas of what God was like. The result was that their minds became dark and confused.  <br>  Rom 1:22   Claiming to be wise, they became utter fools instead. <br>  |`|45c225e1fbbf144b5f2d4c805307255eaa	Well dearie, thanks for telling us you didn't offend us with your question.  We didn't know.  For future reference, if you want people to be nice to you, it helps to be nice to them too.  Also, there is wisdom everywhere, not just in your bible.  Good people don't have to be religious at all.  They answer to their own conscience.  It takes a bit of education, some maturity and yes a realistic thought process to be an atheist.  A lot of religious people just don't question their beliefs.  They go with what was handed to them.  Atheists don't care what others believe, as long as they leave us alone.  Don't ask us questions that insult our intelligence unless you are ready for a good debate, and you won't win.|`|Yn9O0xX5aa	we are just normal people, the bad guys are the ones using religion to control others... even though we do eat the ocasional babie.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT: HAHAHA there goes mnemonic, usng the word straw man out of context again, i think he loves that term. shame he has no idea what it means.|`|X4WRMvGqaa	Atheists are like the rest of us.

Mean and realistic are not terms that are exclusive to one another. In other words, being one does not mean you are not the other.  There are mean, realistic people and nice unrealistic people and all other combinations of the terms. <br>  <br>  Here's where I caution you.  By setting up the question as you have, you have forced a position onto yourself.  Since she is your friend, I assume you probably do not think she is a mean person, in which case, you'd have to say she was realistic.  If she is realistic and atheistic, then you are forced to admit atheism is THE realistic idea.  <br>  <br>  As someone trained both as a scientist and a pastor, let me suggest that reality and truth are not exactly the same.  |`|fe72c95bfe9dd443b87fa4581ac25324aa	Aw, I'm not so bad...   <br>  <br>  There are a lot of mean religious people (I'm sure you can think of more than a few), and a lot of very unrealistic atheists, so I don't think that's really the issue.  Usually people say that atheists don't have morals because they don't specifically follow the Ten Commandments and aren't afraid of going to Hell.  However, I find that I am just as likely to be moral, respectful of others, compassionate and helpful, even though I don't believe there's an afterlife consequence for not being that way.  It just makes me feel better about my life to do the right thing by others - my legacy is not in the afterlife, but in the good I can do for others, here on this Earth during my one lifetime.|`|war8KUDzaa	wellll you religon dosnt make you mean.<br>  so they are normal people.<br>  and slighly more realistic than most people.<br>  and i get what you are saying.. <br>  about the 10 commandments!!!!!!<br>  yeah they follow laws tho..which are basically like the 10 commandments you know?<br>  liek tho shalt not steal.. not all athiest steal.<br>  it just depends on the person. not the religon.<br>  but i get why you asked tho.|`|c4915188681351ae48e3e8dbbb67e2baaa	You can't generalize Christians or atheists.

To be Christian is to be Christ like... That is what Christian means.<br>  So I guess Im saying that BELIEVERS are sometimes judgemental because they do not realize that they are wrong for doing so... Us believers are sinners too and we do wrong just like anyone else. The only difference is that we have accepted Jesus as the son of God and as our Savior. It does not mean that we are better than anyone else in any way We just believe differently... If a Christian or Believer comes off a little judgemental, "forgive them, for they know not what they do".|`|KA4jmUoMaa	We're accused of being judgmental because we point out what actions are sinful.|`|IhzeHAx4aa	because they think they can speak for god|`|AsyB1qLyaa	about what?|`|wxBFZ41Taa	I don't think we are. I think that understanding what "judging" really means is the issue. <br>  <br>  As an analogy, let's say you see someone jay-walking and they are at risk because they are not in the cross walk. If you go up to them and say "hey, jay-walking is against the law and dangerous. You could be killed" are you judging them or stating a truth? They can choose to listen or they can choose to ignore you.<br>  <br>  Judging is to say to someone you are a bad person, or you will go to hell. Now maybe some people do this, and they call themselves Christians...but this is not the Christian way. Only God is the judge of our souls, only he can say who will be in hell. But he gave us guidelines so we know what leads to hell and what leads to heaven. Sin leads to hell...this is not a personal opinion but a truth. For Christians to state the truth does not amount to judging. <br>  It's the same with sin. The Bible tells us what is sinful, Christians just state what is truth. It is not our opinion, we are not judging the person. But we've gotten mixed up between what is sinful and what is legal. Being legal doesn't make something less sinful. Pornography, for example, is legal but sinful. Other things are illegal and also sinful, such as stealing or murder. |`|fOfJz9OMaa	We are suppose to evaluate, determine, and conclude matters by the Word of God.

Sure, there are many who judge when they shouldn't, but doesn't everyone, including Atheists, Muslims, Agnostics, Hindus, etc...?<br>  <br>  The only reason that judgment from a Christian is noticed more is because one of Jesus' teachings was for us not to judge one another, so they are not removing the plank from their own eye before trying to remove the speck from another's eye. I think percentage-wise, there are less Christians who are judgmental than there are non-Christians. It is just noticed more when a Christian is judgmental because our doctrine teaches us not to be.<br>  <br>  What I always say is God doesn't need my help to judge anyone, he's perfectly capable of doing it all on his own, and he can offer a more fair judgment than I could.|`|IX4i2tjcaa	but don't we all judge others. the west judge the middle east and asia. asia judges the west and america. i bet the korean judge the american ways. you think one group of people should be judge because they judge, if that's the case everyone is guilty. we all judge, is how we are. standards are created from judging, anyways that's how we got our laws because people decided to judge the kings. |`|4iOSq8M9aa	I follow God's laws.

gqhoCu3faa	First of all, for the most important facts for your question please visit the web side <a href="http://www.mormon.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.mormon.org</a> <br>  &<br>  Just for you to know the truth<br>  There have to be a purpose for life otherwise we will miss the peaceful path of happiness so we want to be just better everyday<br>  So, spiritually, what is God? , What’s makes God as god? , What is God’s Power? , For all sort of these questions, I have very limited understanding so Let me give you the point. Well, just try to know, what’s makes God as god, the Power, isn’t it? So what the power can do? Ah? Well, it can give the ability to organise all things & it can give the ability to separate everything and most importantly, the Ability to control everything, isn’t it? Isn’t it good? Ah? So, what I try to say here is, from my hard study and research effort with the help from god, I realized that the ability to control everything, the Power of God is gradually increased in the full amount to use so; The Power of God is always the omnipotent and existed among everything. & The God now is always the same omnipotent for us, who is organised us and we are growing towards perfection. The perfection is the final stage, not the end. & The Power of God, the Ability is the reward for us to control everything in a proper manner, like the true God of goodness. & Everlasting Happiness is the final stage. & it cannot come alone without the final stage perfection of God. & if god always perfect in perfection then there have to be beginning with God for the organizing progress of all things. So, there is No end and also No beginning for all things, including this on going organizing progress. So we cannot get anything from nothing. & how could that be possible to be perfect in perfection always, ah…? No way has the perfection of god come first or the growth towards perfection. There is No End and there is No beginning and so the Ability is for the Love of Joy & ~ LOVE IS THE ABILITY ~ <br>  If you don’t still agree, then note this important point: - you can use any thing for Good or Bad so, whenever possible If you ask the god for the good reason to give you the ability perfection, because of your obedience, then the God will give you, if the god is good and Almighty. Simple logical prove (the evidence) for this concept. So, <br>  If you are humble, please... Pray to know the truth from true God by the inspiration of the Holy Spirit with great faith and. Good in Bad & Bad in Good so the values are most important. God gave us the rights to do what is right for you & sometimes, things can be right in your point of view but wrong in Public point of view so Basically, just pray about it for the Good Answer and try to do the God's will first always & If you think, why so much trouble and pain in this world…? Then there is only one reason, without pain, No pleasure and without pleasure, no pain. So without them, we cannot enjoy this life so always we need them in our development towards the perfection of God. So-so you use pain and pleasure instead of pain and pleasure use you. I mean the vision of your future should be clear & it have to pull you rather than you have to push so you must link a lot of pleasure in order to succeed in the Best job. When you feel strong enough links a lot of pleasure in your subconscious mind and your desire for success should be greater than your fear of failure. & It is wonderful nature for us by the true God. And we all make mistakes so it is hard to look for star in daylight. So just in faith… it is possible. Like that the faith in true God. &  If you think, even expert can be wrong then you have to make the fine research in all most everything so It is hard and some time, it is impossible to achieve so Why we need inappropriate action to find the owner of higher power? So, because of Lack of faith in true God, we do not have the great gift of understanding of things. & All things are spiritually first, to govern by God with glory so closely, Have a look at this world of wonders of yours and then you know the truth, when you listen to your real voice and then Having a strong desire to do the best every day then stick with the best to do your best. And most importantly, try to be grateful for what you have now & try to know where you come from to have the great gift of understanding and then, have the faith to become the best winner in your life. & The Law of mercy cannot rob the Law of justice so Justice demands the punishment of our sin but The Law of mercy requires the forgiveness to give to us and God is perfect in perfection so cannot violate his laws so The God provided the way to our salvation to overcome our sin so Jesus Christ sacrifice is much needed to return to live with God, so Jesus Christ is our savior. &<br>  Did you make the commitment to find joy in every moment by using your empowering meanings and conscious focus for the needs of your five senses?<br>  If you find this useful, please help others.

If you do not feel sorry than there is no way to truly repent. you must show some remorse or at least have recognition of guilt to even thin of repenting. The thing to keep in mind here is that repenting is not only saying sorry but also turning way from the sin and doing it no more. <br>  King David was sorry and repented of his sin with Beshaba but he was still a bit proud of his conquest. It was one of his down falls he was a very prideful man. Yet each time he sinned he turned away from it and that sin was never committed again, and there are thousands of sins he avoided from the beginning.<br>  Either way Good luck and perhaps you should pray that God should give you the temperance of mind to truly be sorry to assist you in repenting.|`|NENdAfDLaa	To repent means to be "sorry". Not only sorry, but grievous and full of sorrow of the sins you have committed. You are the epitome of why many people hate Americans. Your attitude of being proud of these things you've done will have you standing before God one day, without the smirk of pride on your face. You will NOT be the one having the last laugh. You will be 'stunningly' aware of your consequences. And you will be paying for your actions, whether you are "sorry" or not. Must suck to be you.|`|WywLv1Xqaa	The road to repentance can be a long drawn out one.<br>  The truth is no, you cant repent without being sorry.Take time to consider the feeling of those you have harmed by doing those things. Would you be happy if people did those things to you with total disreguard for your feelings etc?<br>  The gospel tells us to treat others as we would like to be treated.<br>  Reading, pondering and praying over the gospel is the key.<br>  Repentance is  - 1.to stop doing those things  2.make amends for having done those things where ever you can through which you can come to realise the harm you have done(then you start feeling sorry)  3.pray and ask god to forgive you  4.continue to do no.s 2+3 whilst reading and praying over the gospel. <br>  ALL OF THE THINGS YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT HAVING DONE HAVE BEEN DONE BY OTHERS IN THE BIBLE,  WHO OVERCAME THEIR WEAKNESSES JUST AS YOU SURELY CAN.8-)<br>  Have faith and don't doubt yourself or god.<br>  god bless|`|2d30854bec7b4d3aa1bb8af4207bdf4baa	No, Andrew you cannot 'repent' if you are not sorry for the infidelities. Being secretly married to 2 woman at the same time is illegal as well as immoral. If you want to sleep around, why not stay single? <br>  I can't understand why you would continue these illegal and immoral practices if you are concerned about what God thinks...<br>  ~Peace~|`|2oTCBhRgaa	Repentance without being sorry is hypocrisy. Lord Jesus came to this world to bring sinners to repentance. He did not condemn sinners. But He condemned hypocrites. <br>  <br>  If you do not wear the wedding garment and go to the wedding banquet, you will be bound hands and feet and thrown into the outer darkness. There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.<br>  <br>  May God give you the Spirit of Repentance.|`|urmhRHwxaa	What's the point of repenting if you don't mean it?<br>  <br>  If you're doing it just to keep up appearances with people who assume you're religious, I say go for it.|`|TFV8RLiQaa	Your terminology suggests you are from the Emerald isle, so do what they do -- go and celebrate with your friends and you also know where to go.|`|5JJe5Jedaa	Definition of Repent: Feel remorse for; feel sorry for; be contrite about<br>  <br>  So not really, since that's the definition of the word.|`|QCspoMFMaa	no<br>  there has been TAUGHT tht there is 5 steps to repentance.<br>  <br>  recognition of sin<br>  sorrow for sin<br>  confession<br>  restitution<br>  <br>  and i forget the 5th|`|m6Ih7DHYaa	You better take a long look in the mirror.|`|veB7gJYcaa	No.<br>  <br>  That is the whole point.<br>  <br>  Peter denied Jesus 3 times and<br>  <br>  he wept bitterly.|`|TjI97BHtaa	if it was the other way around and your wife was doing the shennanigans , then, what would you want her to do?|`|sNoObjA4aa	Yes. Repent just means you change your ways. It doesn't matter how you feel, as long as you never do it again. Change your ways. Be a human being. Once you practice being a human being, the feelings will come later.<br>  <br>  To follow that line of thought, you can't go on like you are and expect to have an easy time. There are 2 ways to learn: 1) the hard way, or 2) the easy way of doing the right thing that people tell you from books and life.

The word "repentance" in the Bible means "a turn around." Making a U-turn is a good example of repentance. The Bible clearly teaches that repentance is necessary for salvation. So don't think that Christians have a license to sin; on the contrary, they will be held more accountable to God if they are sinning in the knowledge of the truth.|`|jC7Wx8aXaa	If you're not truly sorry for your "shennanigans,"  then what would be your point in repenting...?<br>  <br>  Carry on with your life.

If we do not even regret sin, then we are yet in them, for we must reach the point where we hate sin.  There is no such thing as being sin friendly with Christ.  And if we are a friend of the world, then we are the enemy of God.|`|I5av9h9naa	You're talking about religious issues here... so you can do what you like.

He is anti-Christ, that denies the Father and the Son. HE THAT DENIES THE SON,  THE SAME HAS NOT THE FATHER". (I John 2:22)<br>  Don't be deceived. The Islamic god is totally different than the God of Jesus Christ.<br>  In fact, Jesus said....your salvation depends on you BECOMING A SON OF GOD.....by being born OF GOD.<br>  <br>  "But as many as received him (Jesus), TO THEM he gave the power to become the Sons of God, even to them that believe in his name, which were born.... not of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but were born of God"- (John 1:12)<br>  <br>  "Except a man  be born again (from above), he shall not see the kingdom of God" - Jesus- (John 3:3)|`|d5K8wORqaa	i heard this O.o|`|uxfacsgmaa	Yes.|`|oHrqbdydaa	Well originally the prophet Mohammed insisted it was the same God and was apparently quite shocked that the Jews and Christians didn't think so.

You will notice that is has the "crescent moon" on the flag. There is a reason for this: You see, in the beginning before anyone ever heard of the Prophet Muhammad, Allah met something totally different to the inhabitants of the Arabian Peninsula, he was the "Moon god of Arabia."

Muslims and Christians oppose the same intellectual errors; struggle against atheism, racism, fascism, and moral degeneration; and use very similar methods to communicate the message of God's existence. Their common aim is to help all people know God (Allah) so that they can build a world full of justice, one in which they can live in peace and tolerance. They act out of fear, respect, and love for God; follow the path of His messengers, and abide by His revelation. <br>  <br>  I strongly recommended you to look at this dialogue between Christians and Muslims which will enlighten you about the TRUTH.

Moreover, most have emotional problems and are being taken advantage of under "buyer beware."<br>  <br>  Generally, in fact more often than not, the products are available elsewhere, and/or for far less cost, and no "Shipping & Handling" charges, which are astronomical for all of those sources. Almost as inferior are the lack of sales tax savings now that Sears and Penny's bought out some of the really decent online and catalog companies - plus shot the prices up to boot! Now, those companies are failing too - you'd have thought at least Kresge would have been smart enough to hold it's consumer-base and not sold out to Sears. <br>  <br>  We are getting tired of these games, and know what they do to our savings.<br>  <br>  Most of such companies are marketing to those who are bi-polar, etc., and cannot stop spending online, and via the TV, never thinking to question the origin of the products, return and/or warranties, which are darned hard to obtain once they're in our homes, and on our bills.

Check the history of families from "the old world," and you will be surprised. <br>  <br>  Violence against women and children has been very high in the U.S. for many, many decades, because power is a serious issue with males. Also, those who have been abused have a stronger tendency to abuse others. Additionally, alcoholism is rife in this nation of "temperance" so that some groups that forbid alcohol cause it to becomes a serious issue in families who have abusive parents, for example, yet their church-going groups forbid drinking - the pressure pops out in abuse, very often, but young people (under the age of ~22) have a difficult time with abstracts; they see things in simpler terms. They may view abuse as being OK to hurt others (as in domestic abuse) and hide it from outsiders, but it's not OK to drink! Guess who grows up abusing others, and/or alcohol (self)?<br>  <br>  Eventually, of course, after several generations alcoholism may become an inherited dependency. <br>  <br>  Abuse is only about power, not "gang mentality;" but people who migrate to gangs may indeed have been abused, and need some peer-ship.<br>  <br>  People with low self esteem are most often abusive, etc. And, around it goes, generation after generation, and in the U.S. it respects no income groups, or religions. The U.S. is higher is child abuse than most other civilized nations, but at the same time, our mental health coverage is far lower, our nation has no healthcare for everyone, and look at our maternal-infant death rate, it's in the bottom 4 of the world.

Titled Royals really don't need surnames,because their titles often serve that purpose.As an officer/ambulance driver during World War II,Elizabeth was identified as Elizabeth Windsor.<br>  The name,Windsor,was originally Saxe-Coburg-Gotha;because of anti-German sentiments caused by the war,and patriotic fervor to assert that the family was British,George V changed the name to Windsor in 1917.<br>  Philip's name of Mountbatten(originally Schlesweig-Holstein-<br>  Sonderburg-Glucksburg ,first changed to<br>    Battenberg) is added on to Windsor for any untitled descendent in need of a surname to use(Mountbatten-Windsor).<br>  There is a longer explanation at <a href="http://www.royal.gov.uk/ThecurrentRoyalFamily/TheRoyalFamilyname/overview.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.royal.gov.uk/ThecurrentRoyalF...</a><br>  but my information includes the books listed below|`|2016b2eff949f27f73d7f010484e92fcaa	Do you mean middle name of surname?<br>  <br>  Her middle name is: Alexandra Mary<br>  <br>  Her surname is: Windsor. <br>  It would have been Saxe-Coburg and Gotha but her grandfather changed it to Windsor because Saxe-Coburg and Gotha sounded too German, and we was at war with the Germans.<br>  <br>  <br>  Her full name is Elizabeth Alexandra Mary Windsor.|`|ZTc7rE1Haa	Her name is Windsor as that is the name of the Royal house to which she belongs. There is nothing weird about it!|`|g7M1DxFCaa	Elizabeth Regina Winsor|`|b06d5f5c50bd7cf1d8a2a3aedfcc1c94aa	Yes it is Windsor. <br>  During the 1st world war they changed the name from Saxe-Coburg-Gotha to Windsor because it was a german name.|`|3IPFCaU0aa	Elizabeth Alexandra Mary|`|AA10620084	Alexandra Mary|`|iw8nIjzLaa	Windsor...?|`|OD3FqMaKaa	alexandra mary<br>  <br>  but i had to look it up!<br>  <br>  <br>  good question :0)|`|ed658ab54221fdf8e76c9f6718308484aa	It's Boneidle|`|8d32360b2ae46f54d5979a019fc43955aa	Windsor?<br>  I think so, but i'm not certain x.|`|c8cc0a83b902efd1ea58347dbb599a91aa	i've always thought its windsor|`|ks9I8eFtaa	If she were a normal lady it would be Mountbatten or Windsor-Mountbatten if she decided to keep her maiden name. That saxcoburgwhatever is not her last name and has not been their last name in a long time, it was only their technical last name for one monarch and even if you (because you're an idiot) don't accept this then it still wouldn't be the saxcoburgwhatever because she likely would have taken her husband's surname which is Mountbatten.<br>  <br>  Most non-idiot people will tell you it's Windsor and legally this is correct because Churchill wanted to make sure the Monarch would always retain the surname Windsor so a law was passed saying that only those not in direct line to the throne would take Prince Philip's surname. For example according to Churchill's wish Prince Charles's legal last name is Windsor whereas Princess Anne's could very well be Mountbatten-Windsor or simply Mountbatten. I've noticed they don't always follow this rule though.<br>  <br>  However, REALLY she doesn't have a last name. She belongs to the house of Windsor which is different than it being her surname.<br>  <br>  btw, she is related to the house of Stuart, James I is her 9th great grandfather. Just because she is related via cousin links instead of directly from the rest of the Stuart monarchs doesn't distract (to non-idiots) that she is James I's 9th great-grand daughter.|`|NqJDWKDPaa	The name of the Royal House she is from is Winsdor, but the monarch the United Kingdom and its Commonwealths takes on no surname.  He name is really Elizabeth II.|`|RjJMV20taa	what a bunch of idiots on here Windsor? it`s  Elizabeth Alexandra Mary of Wndsor|`|ja4raa5Saa	i dont think she has a second name|`|Ku3A8kkzaa	Officially as the head of state she has no last name, no passport and no number plates on her cars.<br>  <br>  She belongs to the house of Windsor, lower members of the royal family that require a surname use Windsor.|`|GHefTsUyaa	Saxe-Coburg Gotha.<br>  The name Windsor was a made up name to distance the English monarchy from their close German relatives at the beginning of World war 1.<br>  <br>  God bless Scotland and the House of Stuart.
IxoBFCpTaa	What do you mean? Is it in the Qur'aan?<br>  <br>  Taa-Haa {20:130}<br>  ((Therefore be patient with what they say, and celebrate (constantly) the praises of thy Lord, before the rising of the sun, and before its setting; yea, celebrate them for part of the hours of the night, and at the sides of the day: that thou mayest have joy.))<br>  <br>  <I lol too much><br>  <br>  That is a complete lie. Read the verse I posted.|`|d1i3ac5baa	it started with the night journey of mohammad. mohammad rode buraq, a flying horse to jerusalem and from there mohammad climbed up a golden ladder up to heaven. during mohammad's visit with allah he told him to have muslims pray to him 50 times a day however after several trips of running up and down the stairs between the 7th and 6th heaven and talking to moses, mohammad managed to talk all knowing allah down to 5 prayers a day. . this can be found in the bukhari hadiths, the night journey  and confirmed by sura 17:1 53:6-7  81:22-23. it doessn't say how mohammad was able to breath as he climbed up to heaven.|`|ouXrNitMaa	The number of times to pray does NOT come from the Qur'an. It comes from second-hand reports of a story Mohammad told about flying up to heaven, and haggling DIRECTLY with Allah. He claimed Moses had him keep going back to Allah to ask for a reduction in the number, until Mohammad felt too pushy. <br>  <br>  One Hadith says the original number of daily prayers was 50. Another says 40. That PROVES one (or both) accounts are unreliable. That's the problem with the Hadiths. They are clearly the words of men, and men have been known to make things up ;o)<br>  <br>  It's my understanding that the Qur'an is to be used to make Islamic law, and not outside material such as the enormous collection of second-hand accounts known as the Hadith.|`|7aoHmM4baa	when the prophete mohamed S.A.W  came and asked god to minimize the prayers to oly 5 a day to make it easier|`|Eeo6HPvuaa	They come from the Quran which is the word of Allah.|`|mOWyzwubaa	Salat,Zakat,Hajj,Saum all were given to Prophet Ibraheem,|`|0izWHHKXaa	No one really knows.  It's just done.  Was supposed to be 50, but Allah figured that 50 times a day would make life retarded.<br>  <br>  I figure the guy who made the 50 rule was retarded himself.  Stupid desert moon god.
tdQTZPI7aa	Yes it was a violation since you did not provide any information that the question was seeking.  Instead you replied with a question of your own.  Read the guidelines.|`|KXQVRQdjaa	I think it was reported because it isn't an answer.|`|7c73d357ee89c177275de5c2d1c35fd2aa	Some people mistakenly believe that Socratic method constitutes a question instead of an answer.  Of course, you should expect this and not use Socratic method.<br>  <br>  Then again it only has to be reported enough times to be removed - the content is rarely if ever looked at.|`|q2imh5Zyaa	Nah!

ab406a9a5d69ca0d2cc95e30217f543aaa	Some people see it as the government saying homosexuality is approved.<br>  <br>  I believe in equal justice for gays. Equal right to marriage.<br>  <br>  But lots of people don't see it that way. Both the Old Testament and the New Testament speak harshly against homosexuality. That's a gigantic amount of socialization and of history to get past.|`|iIzlC2KCaa	Many people feel that it is morally wrong for homosexuals to marry and that marriage is meant to be between a man and a woman.  It would be wonderful if we could live our lives without it affecting others, as some responders have suggested, but it just is not so.  Over time, the gay rights movement has increasingly forced their way into our lives and expect us to accept them and their way of life.  I do not believe it is acceptable, nor do I want my children taught that it is.  Unfortunately, they go to school and are taught both socially and in class that it is acceptable.  If they have the right to believe what they believe so should we.  Homosexuality is not right and it never will be.  For many people, myself included, this will not change.  I do not desire, nor do I condone, any type of hatred, maliciousness, or crime against homosexuals, and I would take a stand against this, but I will not and cannot accept it as a lifestyle.  And I have the right to believe this and believe that they should not marry, because I am an American.  Not everything we want to do is a right, including gay marriage.|`|tbeO3Lataa	I don't live in California! Plus I am not 18, so I couldn't have voted anyway.<br>  <br>  But no doubt, I would have voted against it. <br>  <br>  You'd have better luck asking this question in elections.|`|FjiRPKp2aa	You do realize that most of the rest of the world have no idea what prop 8 is.So how come you folks keep asking about a topic most of us do not care about?
aa01e8d5606d9a4d7c095368bc29a370aa	Modern society will tell you that physical attraction is extremely important. People are more shallow than they have ever been and dont care about what really matters. Its unfortunate but this is the truth in todays reality. The media also teaches us that beautiful people are the only ones that matter so its not getting any better.Personality is much more important than looks. I usually fall in love with someone because I love their personality not their looks. If someone can not appreciate you then its their loss not yours.|`|24Cz1lItaa	who knows. but everyone judges ppl by what they look like. some of the sweetest ppl you will ever meet arent even that attractive cuz they focus on better important things in life. but i gotta say, if i date a guy i want him to be cute!
tvzzSCSGaa	Of course not!  A job promotion should be solely based on ability, how qualified they are and the results they get.  All of the above should not factor in at all. Sadly, it does. gender: men are often paid more than women and given priority in senior and management roles. On the other hand, I'm sure there are plenty of attractive women that got jobs over male/less attractive but better qualified female competition if they have a male sleazeball boss. Race...there's discrimination on two levels there, I'm sure a lot of people would hire white people over ethnic minorities (unfairly), but at the same time positive discrimination means that some employers (such as the police) will favour less qualified but non white candidates. Weight: studies have shown that most HR people said they would much rather hire a thin person that a fat one, as fat people have negative connotations (lazy, unmotivated etc). Height: Plenty of studies have shown that taller people are paid more, and get better promotions - a 6ft man is likely to earn something like 5 grand a year more than a 5ft 5 one. So they all happen. It's wrong though|`|84726b724d7d1fd7da09652c50425c38aa	No. <br>  How well you do the work and how competent you are should make you considered for a job promotion.
sYNyNFOWaa	Where there is freedom of choice there will never be peace on earth. Whether the ruling party was male or female, young or old, homosexual, heterosexual or bi-sexual.<br>  Where people can choose to be good or bad or an in-betweener. When you have people who design leopard print stilettos for 6month old babies which in turn sexualises them even more in a paedophiles eyes there is chaos and no peace for the families involved. <br>  When game designers create games that encourages excessively violent behaviours where you can run around realistically targeting women and raping them or killing people and cops in realistic settings.<br>  Ever increasingly more drugs that twist with a persons mental capacity too differentiate between reality and not all in their head.<br>  Not too mention your everyday person who just snaps one day because enough is enough.<br>  Yet take away peoples freedom of choice and there will still be anarchy.<br>  People want the right to be able too choose; fight or don't fight. Be good or not be good. <br>  Where the human race is concerned there will never be peace. Someone will always want to go too war because another country may have more oil than them or better farming land, or theirs is the only true religion. They maybe holding ancient grudges from a time well and truly over like the stolen generations or slavery etc.... Or the leader of a country just wants a pissing contest too show how powerful they really are.<br>  Over the ages people have shown no sign of being capable of everyone of us being able to co-exist peacefully with anyone or anything and everyday that goes by our societies attitudes seem to be deteriorating a little more as each day passes by.|`|VP7A10bXaa	You can't say that men are better rulers than women or that women are better rulers than men. It completely depends upon the person ruling|`|daDJrtcvaa	no,because the women would see men the same way men in power see women|`|0V8It6sSaa	Don't think it would make any difference... We're all just people. However, when their 'time of the month hits', men should hide the WMDs somewhere where they can't find 'em!|`|NXujuDxnaa	No. If one single sex ruled the world, there would infact be far more chaos than ever before.|`|J6uERgKoaa	They would be more calm about situations.|`|1AyRPRSOaa	No, because Nancy would still be at war with Hillary|`|Rh2tpV1Faa	umm  no.  I think it would be worse.  LOL|`|mNhzeKYnaa	No, things would probably be very similar to how they are now.|`|84726b724d7d1fd7da09652c50425c38aa	I think there would be less wars if women ruled the world, but peace? Probably not. Instead of wars, there would probably be little cliques of countries and the women would talk behind each other's back. I don't think there wold be a 'sisterhood' if we ruled the world. <br>  <br>  Now, I don't think only men should rule the world either. A good mix of men and women is nice.|`|1yJWrccXaa	Depends on the women who ruled; but I would like to give it a try.  I think that it could be better; unless they are billary clintons.|`|a1731418e68343f01ae82b7c12846cf2aa	No, but warfare would be a lot different.  It would be far more emotional and psychological terror, rather than physical terror.<br>  <br>  We'd still be Christians, Muslims, agnostics, Arabs, French, Americans, Sunnis, Shiites, etc.  We'd believe near the same.  How we carried out our beliefs would be different.|`|jRtQTN24aa	Say what ? Have you forgotten about pms, hot flashes and mood swings? May not be peaceful, but could be interesting.|`|7uznrLBXaa	There will be peace when people get along - not when one gender rules the world.|`|Vy8p3Qlcaa	No, maybe if gay people did.

9qmjaZP2aa	I am happy to see that you began your question by letting us know that this is indeed a trick question.  For those who wish to research it further it is known as the cosmological argument which was first made prominent in Christian circles by Thomas Aquinas.  The truth is there is no answer to this question.  The reason we humans find it troubling is because it forces our finite minds to contemplate a question which is infinite in nature and therefore totally outside our frame of reference.  Since we all had a beginning at some point we find it literally impossible to understand that there must be a first cause and that first cause must be uncaused, which means it always was and is without beginning.  To some, the first "uncaused cause" is God.  For others it is the universe itself.<br>  <br>  Good topic.  Thanks for the question.<br>  <br>  Mark|`|3K51tgQWaa	I did.

Why are you reading an Arab newspaper?" <br>  <br>  Moshe replied: "I used to read the Jewish newspaper, but what did I find? Jews being persecuted, attacked, Jews disappearing through assimilation and intermarriage, Jews living in poverty. So I switched to the Arab newspaper. Now what do I find?

Pagans in Britain and Ireland used to dress in animal skins on the holiday they named after him. It was believed that, on October 31st of each year, Samhain and his minions would return to the world of the living dressed in animal skins, in an effort to ''blend in'' with livestock and wildlife. If they were mistaken as animals, the living would not realize who they were, and would therefore allow them to wander the earth in freedom for a night. So the dead disguised themselves as animals, and the living disguised themselves as the dead. A certain Pope came along, and suggested a change in Samhain practices. He suggested that people dress as Christian saints, rather than as malicious corpses. He also suggested that the poor beggars of each township be allowed to go from door to door and ask for food on the holiday now called Halloween. (Halloween, or ''All Hallows Evening'' is called such because it is the day before All Saints Day). The beggars would then pray for the deceased relatives of the person (their relatives in Purgatory) who gave them food.<br>  <br>  I'm Christian, and though I don't have kids as of now, I will not forbid my future children from participating in Halloween. I don't celebrate it myself, but only because I don't yet have my own family (not to mention the fact that I live about five miles from the nearest town, and kids honsetly just don't come this far from civilization on Halloween), and I basically see it as a holiday reserved for children, even though I do observe All Saints Day as an important Christian holiday. If we focused on remembering some great event on Halloween, it would probably be more important to me, but as it is, I see it as an excuse for kids to be kids and have fun with other kids, and not much more.|`|Kel5lb7Baa	It is a fun thing to do but the Christian thing to do is not let it go to their heads.

Kids love Halloween because it is both fun,gay,scary, and of course free candy. But they have no idea what's behind this celebration -- if children really knew it represented a history of popes selling out to convert pagans, they would be sick to their stomach and probably start to watch naruto. To satanists and witches, Halloween is no joke -- of course, witches don't max out their credit cards to celebrate Jesus' birthday, so they're pretty bad at getting the message of most holidays. As we get closer to the Second Coming of Jesus, Satanism will increase -- until, people are calling each other terrible names, starting wars in other countries for no reason,becoming jews because pigs will extinct, and pretending to love Jesus just to get elected. So will human sacrifice (sic: see previous comments on foreign wars in the name of Christ)!|`|Ixp4dADyaa	I am against halloween, why? because it has nothing to do with God, only satan. going out and dressing up, to get either candy (if you a kid), or going to a costume party, where there is dancing and drink. where is God in those. it would be my advice for parents that have kids in a christian life style to teach their children that halloween is a man made tradition and is a day for the spiritualist to do their rituals.<br>  <br>  that is my opinion, but i believe that God does not approve of this day.<br>  <br>  God bless,<br>  |`|aA73aZq5aa	I don't believe in Halloween.

NYU37jfGaa	She became Queen because she was next in line to succession after Mary I.  She would have become Queen whether she wanted to be or not. She had no choice in the matter.<br>  <br>  One of her most notable accomplishments was to settle the religious question, by establishing the church of England as the official religion of England, and by "defending it with tenacity and ingenuity for forty ears" as David Loades puts it in 'Elizabeth I'.<br>  <br>  Her foreign and domestic policies were, as Lodge says, not so determined:<br>  <br>  'Elizabeth's priority was clear.  England's interests, including her own, took precedence over every other consideration.  This led directly to the endless convolutions and short-term shifts that every historian of Elizabethan foreign policy has charted.  As the stroms of ideological conflict rose in Europe, engulfing England's nearest neighbors, France and the Netherlands, the Queen struggled to keep her realm in peace, and to avoid commitment.  She disliked rebels on principle, fearing that such ideas could prove infectious, yet self-interest dictated that she should support them; first in Scotland, then in France, and finally in the Low Countries.  Elizabeth's aim was always to do as little as possible, for as long as possible, and she took advantage of every shift in the circumstances to achieve this, with baffling displays of indecisiveness and inconsistency.<br>  <br>  Elizabeth often had her own reasons for not wanting to make her control obvious; and she regularly reserved a position from which it was possible to disown mistakes.  The growth of English piracy, particularly at the expense of Spain, between 1565 and 1580, is an obvious case in point.  Elizab eth could, and occasionally did, forbid these adventurers to set out, which suggests that those who did went without her explicit or implicit approval.  Foreing complaints, however, were regularly met with bland surprise or asusmed concern, or refered to the admiralty, court, as not bein gpolitical issues.  <br>  <br>  Elizabeth had no grand ambitions, as her father had done, either for honor in the military sense or for territorial expansion.  She had no desire to be the leader of Protestant Europe, but had no option but to accept the pope as a declared enemy after 1570 (when he excommunicated her).  She did not make alliances with Protestants such as the Huguenots or the Dutch because they were Protestants, but because they were curbs upon the power of Spain.  Elizabeth would happily have avoided conflict with Philip II if she could have done so, and wriggled like an eel for years to preserve the peace, but the logic of both their positions made that eventually impossible.<br>  <br>  The queen was not directly involved with Frobisher's explorations, or with the Roanoke venture, although she was interested in both, but she was an active participant in many of the ventures and expeditions which brought about the diversification of england trade during her reign, and created the springboard for the great expansion of the following century.  Her role in this promotion was one of the most positive features of her reign, as well as one of the most neglected in conventional assesments.  Elizabeth believed that England's future strength and prosperity lay in its commerce.  Good relations with the sultan, and with the tsar of all the Russias, to say nothing of Drake's circumnavigation of the world, spelled out a global ambition which the queen herself had neither the time nor the resources to realise; but it was a legacy to her succesors.'|`|c8lBbWtQaa	She was the daughter of henry VIII & had a lot of her fathers traits She brought peace to england she brought tolerance especially between catholics & Cof E she brought prosperity by trade &encouraged exploration [ she did expect them to bring home wealth] she also founded poor houses in each parish in england to house the old & destitute the 1st time the state recognised its duty to its people this was the fore runner to the welfare state in britain she encouraged the arts & literature she was very intelligent & was educated to a high standard when women were not thought of highly.

aLNLl482aa	I'll tell you how much of a fan I am...I've never been to one. I was practically bullied in work for refusing to go on the almost monthly 'trip' to the trafford centre.<br>  <br>  I'm really sorry I don't mean to insult but the fact that other posters have mentioned it as a 'day out' fills me with despair.<br>  <br>  I prefer normal city centres with  mix of old and new and variety of 'feels' to the different quarters ( loathe to use that word but it is apt) There is nothing wrong with state of the art developments but to move them out of town with no thought given to the architecture save some naff bejeweled dome on top of the identikit 'units' oh ffs don't start me..I'm going for a lie down.|`|CEePcKs7aa	I enjoy shopping at Bluewater, mostly because it's a day out all in itself - you can go to the cinema, have a go on the paddle boats on the lake, and play in the playground (if you happen to be under 10) without ever leaving the grounds.<br>  <br>  It also has a better atmosphere than a normal high street IMO; instead of cars rushing by you as the cold wind strikes your face, you have a pleasant space constantly air conditioned with benches and seats.|`|mmMgfhf2aa	I have a very busy life and like to be able to pull up outside a shop or shopping centre. I also like to park for free. I've stopped going into Town because it's an expensive nightmare to get parked. Target the councils who have parking wardens destroying the trade of local high street shops. I can't nip in to our local shops anymore, as much as i'd like to.|`|e8FiZHkRaa	No. I see the outlets as a "day out". I probably go to one once every few months. Everything else I buy in my town and it's always busy in my town as well. I don't think they're to blame for the "heart and soul" being ripped out of other towns. You can't just stick a GAP, a River Island and a huge Cadbury discount shop everywhere can you? It's unrealistic. The only decent shop there is where I live is New Look. It's either visit the outlet, or go and buy from a charity shop. With me being a teenage girl, I don't fancy wearing other people's cast-offs.<br>  <br>  Maybe you're just living in the wrong place. If anything, the outlets near me are dead and it's the town that's busy.|`|f4fddd96f6c1635b7fc9966339558ba9aa	It's all a bit moot for me. We are rapidly losing our high street and we haven't got an out of town shopping centre, unless you count another town as a shopping centre.<br>  <br>  There's one of these outlet villages about a n hours drive away. I went once a long time ago. It wasn't that great, so I haven't been again.<br>  <br>  I have to say that I like Poundland though. I like cheap junk :D|`|ae69df0205dd6e6d96e6d67fdc47b203aa	I'm glad we live in a free and open democracy where you are allowed to make a legal ￡ in whatever way you can

GAYeuM0Zaa	good question.. i dont really know... but if your chinese or asian who use chopsticks, you are usually right handed because while eating dinner, everybody is to hold there chopsticks with their right hand so you wont hit each others chopsticks... For example two people sitting beside each other the person on the left is using its right hand to hold the chopstick and the person on the right is holding the chopstick with their left hand. When they are in the eating motion, it will interfere... in today's society, there not that strict anymore about this rule about holding it with your right hand|`|XBYiHaWIaa	Because that's the way it is.|`|6LKEWFPoaa	I am the only left handed person in my family.

AA12258992	I was a child during the '40's, and it was a wonderful time; except for the war.<br>  <br>  There was certain food and gasoline rationing.<br>  <br>  The main entertainment was the movies.  The rest of the time, we just played outside with our friends.  All kinds of games outdoors, got alot of exercise.<br>  <br>  In the winter, we had sled-riding and ice skating.  I lived in the north at that time.  We played board and card games in the winter.  There were serials for kids on the radio.<br>  <br>  The music was great, big bands and swing.  There were alot of musical movies, Abbott and Costello, Tarzan, Frankenstein, cowboy serials every week.<br>  <br>  Alot of westerns, Roy Rogers, Gene Autry, and Bill Boyd.<br>  <br>  There were alot of war movies, also.<br>  <br>  We wore skirts and tops or dresses to school.  Saddle shoes became a big favorite.<br>  <br>  It's a time I will never forget.|`|0rpN2419aa	We used to go with mom and dad to friends homes or they would come to ours and play pinochle, or when we went to Grandma's we'd go with them to the Finn Hall and go do the polka with the old folks.  We though it was lots of fun,   The atheletic events and school dances were our entertainment during the school year. <br>  <br>   In the summer, we would go out in the fields and pick berries, beans, hops, and other crops to have extra money to pay for school clothes.  In Oregon school was let out in late May back then because they needed field workers and it was lots of fun! When we weren't in the fields, we would go on long bike rides, sometimes to the river and swim.<br>  <br>  Wen TV came into existance, for me in the early fifties, it kind of took some of the visiting friends away, because everyone was so enthralled with televison...kind of a shame we let it run our life so, but it did.  <br>  What did I wear?  Great, full skirts with can cans to make them stand out.  We would sit in our seat at school and our skirts would make a wooshing sound..annoyed one of the teachers..he'd just look at us and shake his head.  <br>  <br>  Ah, those were the good old days!|`|sO2CKU1uaa	Well I'm not old enough to answer but I'd like to spend a year in the 40s and in the 70s too|`|d11beb9dbe4d078345e0f4632d56c6d9aa	I was born in 1949, so I have no memories from that time frame.

KqiiT1WSaa	For some WEIRD reason I like brain dead jobs, i have worked in factories doing some difficult and some easy jobs which require no brains but a little brawn and i loved it. easy money. i just hated wearing safety boots, they get somewhat uncomfortable.<br>  <br>  I have also worked in professional environments, but has been VERY low stress. but requires too much brains. loool i have more than enough brains but i just want to sleep most of the time.<br>  <br>  quite sad, i know<br>  ____<br>  <br>  @imuslimah HAHA - well to be honest im sure you have both brains and patience.

They were born into the middle class and worked their way up. <br>  If you are rich and end up rich, sorry, you did not work as hard as the person who was born into poverty or was working/middle class. <br>  Not all poor people are ignorant. <br>  I'm assuming you're under 15, so I'm not going to call you ignorant.

Also, they're ignorant for the same reason as rich people: they're human. You just said you're rich, then clarified that your dad is rich. Nice hard work you did there, being born. Must've taken some real intelligence.<br>  <br>  ***EDIT***<br>  <br>  Okay, before I was typing via phone and had space restrictions, but now I can really respond.<br>  <br>  For starters, I can now see your Q&A page, indicating that you are, in fact, a troll. Not only do you type as if you've no concept of the written English language, but you ask questions such as, "My friend joe has a dad who is a teacher he datin a girl who mom is a teacher is that like datin ur sister?" Or better yet, your, "Help my friend c the error of his ways?", which is basically you going on about how your friend's girlfriend has a brace on her arm which makes you childishly call her Robocop, and he should therefore not date her. And don't try to sell your mangled words as "kewl internetz speek", because I'm pretty sure "ded ened" is raw stupidity.<br>  <br>  Further, way to make up a statistic, Captain Ignorance -- which, I don't believe you know the true definition of ignorance, either. Ignorance is not necessarily bad, if you choose to do something about it. It is not a polite way of saying "stupid", which appears to be how you intended it. EVERYONE is ignorant, i.e., uneducated, about something. Odds are, you don't know much about how to perform open heart surgery. That doesn't make you stupid, it makes you ignorant. The modern (read: connotative) definition is used more as a weak insult which is ignorant in itself. Anyway, if you have a reliable source showing that your 90% of life is heredity comment is true, they have A WHOLE BOX for that here. Otherwise, have fun making up numbers so you can sleep at night. Made-up statistics won't carry you through life. Your daddy's money might, but it doesn't matter if you don't deserve a cent of it.<br>  <br>  You state that poor people (which, by this point, I'm beginning to wonder if you consider the middle class "poor") don't pay their bills, which is not necessarily true. You are an overwhelmingly prejudiced -- and due to the nature of some of your other questions, I can also presume racist and otherwise wholly biased -- individual, who surely doesn't even have a high school diploma yet. And so arrogant that you feel you have the right to judge!<br>  <br>  And yes, my being born comment was a nice comeback, mainly because it's true. You have a rich daddy. Congratulations. I wonder what he would think if he saw what a bigot he'd produced.<br>  <br>  Finally, thanks again for the two points. That's really all you're worth. You came here with a pseudo-question that you weren't even truly seeking an answer to, because you already think you know everything. At best, you came here so other "rich people" could stroke your ego. As indicated by your description, you already feel you know the answer better than any of us could convince you. I type this knowing I've accomplished nothing in the way of a breakthrough to you. Maybe you should come back in twenty years, once daddy's paid your way through school and used his influences to net you a job you couldn't have otherwise gotten. Hopefully then you'll have lived enough to understand that life isn't money, and there's more to being rich than having expensive things. I'm sure for now you'll be comfortable in your own ignorance, but life will eventually become more transparent for you, I hope, and you'll see that, however cliché, you can't buy happiness.<br>  <br>  tl;dr: Grow up. I'm done feeding the troll for tonight.<br>  <br>  P.S. Beastishh878: Yes, because everyone who makes less than $100,000 a year (or $50,000, even) must be a dropout. Clearly. And you were trying to make a case for poor people being exceptionally ignorant?|`|kYItYRo9aa	I don't know but the blacks always act ignorant I guess now I see why|`|rxItXYk8aa	Some of them do realize it, but I know exactly what you mean.  I hate it when people say that rich are stupid... The rich usually work very hard for their money, or they wouldn't be rich.  You could argue and mention Paris Hilton.  I could argue back, mentioning that her parents earn the money and worked very hard to do so.  Whereas poor people are poor USUALLY because at one point in life, they DIDN'T work hard.  For example, a drop out.<br>  It's common racism.  They're ususally envious but don't tend to realize it, so they make stuff like that up.  Don't bother unconvincing them, honestly, they'll only just get mad at you.<br>  <br>  &&nainibo- that's one example, as I said.  so don't be so quick on your answer. chill.

I thought she was evil! lol|`|4c979acd3ee945a6e63181337a60c6e7aa	I was a born again Christian and got tired of praying to the air.  My thought is that if God was supposed to be my father why did He allow alot of things to happen that my earthly father would never allow and no...can't be explained away by the old we live in a fallen world crap.  Besides ... ask 2 different Christians anything about God and you'll get 2 different answers ... if His people can't even agree on simple things something is wrong here.|`|AA11043053	I was a Christian, grew up the son, grandson, nephew, & cousin of Methodist ministers. However, rational examination of the evidence for god convinced me that all my prayer life, and indeed, anyone's prayer life, is simply talking to oneself in a quiet state.<br>  <br>  There was no failing of God, but rather just a look at reality. We are all on our own, but we have each other.|`|EgsE5RFaaa	I was raised Christian- Methodist to be more specific. My doubts never arose out of anger, rather just finding the notion of an intelligent God and the story of Christianity to be utterly ridiculous. But please note that atheists are not angry at God. If you're angry at God, you're not an atheist, you're an angry theist.|`|i0OVwfcyaa	I was raised in a Methodist/Catholic household, but never believed.<br>  <br>  For most of us, it's not about feeling "failed," it's about the complete lack of evidence for the existence of any gods.

I never thought the christian deity was real and always wondered why do people want to go talk to the air like it's a real person.  When I got older and did my own research I confirmed my views with the lack of empirical evidence available to show that any deity from any belief system is real.|`|CBKjEvp5aa	I used to be EXTREMELY religious. I once treated atheists like complete crap and acted as if they weren't humans; but I was 11 then, and just doing what I had been taught. As I got older and started thinking for myself, my belief in a higher power disappeared, and my ignorance started fading out.|`|VgC5ip1xaa	I was once a christian. When I starting looking into it more I realised how little there was to prove the validity of it and gave up on it. Quite simply, there just wasn't anything that made me feel sure it was right, so I decided that there was no point trying to pretend I believed when I really didn't. If there is a God, I doubt he'd appreciate that anyway.|`|gGd3v3M5aa	I was raised without religion,<br>  My parents are both Christan but they thought it best to never talk about it. Hahaha.<br>  When I got old enough to actually use my mind for myself, I took a class that taught (as unbiasedly as they could) about the 5 most talked about world religions, (Hinduism, Buddhism, Judaism, Islam, Christianity) and I just decided through tons of thinking that I thought I was doing fine and mine made the most sense for me.<br>  Atheism.|`|99o9d6S4aa	I was, now I am not.

At one point i was on the bubble and that was when i was a kid. As i grew up the idea of it became more and more absurd.

They only time i have gone since i refused to along time ago is when my grandfather died last year.<br>  <br>  I hate all these religious wars, i hate all this fighting about whos religion is better.

HziXc5Ovaa	There is no reference about Ham's wife's colouring. It was Moses who married a Cushite woman.<br>  The genetic makeup of the first man, Adam, was such that extensive variety could develop among his offspring—in such things as skin color, hair color and texture, body size and facial characteristics. This variety was increased by language and geographical differences.<br>  <br>  Concerning geographical isolation the Encyclopedia Americana explains: “When lands inhabited by two or more populations are separated by seas, mountain ranges, deserts, or other obstacles to travel, the members of these populations are perforce confined to their respective territories. .?.?. races will be separated by gene frequency gaps corresponding to the geographical boundaries. .?.?. this condition is approached in Africa, where the Sahara Desert forms a boundary between the European (white) and the African races. The Sahara is very sparsely inhabited and difficult for man to traverse; it constitutes an isolating agent of long standing.”<br>  <br>  Thus genetics, language and geographical barriers help to explain why distinctive racial groups appear in all parts of the earth.<br>  <br>  According to the Bible, all humans descend from Noah, through his three sons Shem, Japheth and Ham. Genesis chapter 10 lists 70 descendants of Noah saying: “From these the nations were spread about in the earth.” (Genesis 10:32) One of the many ways in which these nations have been classified is with reference to skin color. In the skin of all normal humans is a blackish brown pigment called melanin.<br>  <br>  Noah and his three sons all had a measure of this dark pigment. From Shem came the Babylonians, the Assyrians, the Jews and the Arabs who vary from fair to light-brown skin. The descendants of Japheth, who include the Indo-European races, vary from light skin to dark brown. As for Ham (meaning swarthy or sun-burnt), some, but not all, of his descendants had dark skin. The Egyptians, with light-brown skin, descended from Ham’s son Mizraim. Ham’s son Canaan was the forefather of the light-skinned Canaanites.<br>  <br>  In agreement with this, Dr.?Hughes, a professor of anthropology at the University of Toronto, said: “On every continent, and in every geographically defined race, there is a considerable range of variation in .?.?. skin pigmentation, .?.?. the Tamils of South India are considered by many anthropologists to be members of the Caucasoid [white Indo-European] major race, yet in skin pigmentation they are darker than many Africans .”<br>  <br>  All divisions of mankind have a dark pigment in their skin, some to a lesser, others to a greater extent.|`|0zRDFRxPaa	From africa|`|p2E60yBSaa	You can't take the bible as fact. |`|rLDB7ZwJaa	The Mormons believe they are descendants of Cain.

This was "the mark of Cain." It's not politically correct now, but hardcore Christians (white ones anyway) probably still secretly believe this, although they might suggest the Tower of Babel as an alternative explanation.|`|N9mP2Kqfaa	all of the people on earth came from Adam and Eve<br>  <br>  When God created, he created DNA with a lot of variables. you cannot look back in history by today's criteria of families and genetic diversity.<br>  God's original creation probably included so much genetic diversity such that children born to Adam and Eve were yellow, white, black and every shade in between. the hair was some diverse variety of black, red, blonde to brown.<br>  as people became isolated, you began to see a population group with similar traits ie. language etc.<br>  <br>  so, black people were always there, <br>  you can see that the black skin texture is changing in America b/c we nolonger have the intense sun and the colour hue of blacks is gradually changing with each generation and they are becoming paler and whiter with each generation|`|F3NNKwP9aa	we ALL came from black people so yours is a good question.

XvCaZYCqaa	He probably has expenses that are unimaginable to you, assuming you are in your 20's.  Because he is in his 40's, it appears that he is time conscious and wants to be punctual,  which is a very good work ethic.  I  would like to say that you should be patient and kind, for you know not what your co-worker is going through nor what he has been subjected to in the past.  Remember, do unto others as they would do unto you.  You can not look down the road and determine how your life will be when you, too, will be in your 40's.  Pray that someone is there for you with understanding and compassion when it is needed as you are now there for your co-worker.  Help him, please,  kind one.  There could be many reasons why he is unable to have a license and a car at this time...perhaps in his past these things were of no consequence to him. We go through various challenges in life...some we can avoid and control, others we simply grow and learn from them, hopefully. Would you not want the same kindness extended to you and/or your close family members if need be?  There is no need to be rude or hurtful. Simply explain that you need his assistance in fueling your vehicle. Do not assume you are being used;  This may not be the case.

Why have you not already asked him for gas money? Why do you apparently feel you have to leave the house earlier than suits you if he asks? Why are you apparently unable to say no to him?<br>  <br>  It's good that you want to be a considerate and kind person, but you have to accept that there are people in the world who will treat you like a doormat if you let them. If you get some sort of satisfaction out of being used – if you enjoy playing the martyr or you have a masochistic streak – then that's fine; you'll continue to attract people like the user who you're working for as an unpaid chauffeur to these days. The world if full of people who will happily take advantage of you and not feel a single flicker of guilt.<br>  <br>  If you're not willing to be used, then you need to learn how to recognise those people and you need to learn how to take a deep breath, stand up straight, look them in the eye and say, "No, I'm sorry, but I just can't do that."<br>  <br>  You don't need to explain to the guy why you can't do what he wants you to do. However, if he's as big a jerk and as self-centred and infantile as your question makes him sound, then it's entirely possible he will ask you for an explanation. Be strong, look him in the eye and repeat that it's not what you want to do.<br>  <br>  Whatever he may think, you were not put on this earth in order to help him out. You do NOT need to do what he wants you to. You do NOT need to justify your needs and desires.<br>  <br>  If you developing a spine results in him making life difficult for you at work, start taking notes and refer the matter to your supervisor when you have enough evidence to show that he's deliberately causing problems for you (and therefore attempting to sabotage the organisation you both work for).|`|pcANxhy2aa	That's a tricky one, but you'll just have to be honest and stand up for yourself. Tell him that although you don't mind giving him a ride, considering that you're going out of your way, you'd like some help with petrol. If he kicks up a stink then just say "Look, I'm not interested in fighting, but I only think it's fair. If that's a problem, then maybe you should carpool with someone else." And tell him that you're not willing to get up an hour early, that's when you're in the shower. If he wants to get in early, tell him to make his own arrangements. You don't have to be aggressive or rude about it - just be calm, friendly and matter-of-fact. <br>  Tell him that although you don't mind giving rides, you're not a chauffer, and you were told at first that he would help with petrol money. Until then, refuse to pick him up. And tell him that he should first check with you, if he wants to be in an hour early. Otherwise, the public transport system awaits him :P<br>  Good luck, it sounds like he's really taking advantage. |`|pPX1Kvy4aa	Treat his need as holy, but don't let him take advantage of your kindness.

Honesty is the best policy.|`|AA11289758	You're probably going to have to stand up to this person and tell them that you feel you are being taken advantage of.  Inform them that while you enjoy helping them out every so often, you are not a taxi and do not appreciate being treated like one.  Tell him you enjoy knowing him as a coworker, but you will no longer be able to give him rides.  (If you feel you need to justify with a reason, you can say that it interferes with your personal time, that it has become too inconvenient, too costly, that you miss sleeping in, that you need to be getting home earlier, or that you need privacy to call family on the phone during your commute....you get the idea.)<br>  <br>  Be assertive!  You're worth it!|`|EHGu6taOaa	I can see helping somebody if they have a vehicle that is broke down and they have money to fix the problem. The guy sounds like he f***ed up by gettng his license suspended or by not wanting a driver's license. You can't go this day in age without a driver's license. The man is using you and won't reimburse you for your gasoline and you have to cater to his needs.   He probably doesn't watch his money to well so he will never have money for a vehicle. His money is probably spent on the bars and pack of cigarettes. The man should at least courtesy by buying you lunch and paying for your gasoline. I would tell him straight out to find another ride.|`|AfnQ95Z5aa	Stop driving crazy.  There's no point in causing an accident because you're too shy to confront him.  <br>  <br>  If I were you, I would tell him that I feel like I'm being used and I'm not going to be his free taxi anymore.<br>  <br>  People like this can sense vulnerability and will take advantage of people like you every time.

He's obviously taking advantage of you.|`|36C2dn6eaa	You are not being mean to stand up to him.  You don't have to be spineless to be nice.  Freeloaders will take exactly as much advantage as you give them, so give exactly as much as you are willing to give, and not an inch more.  <br>  <br>  Just tell him, "I need time to shower and eat breakfast, so I can't be there before x time.  If you need an earlier ride, you'll need to find someone else."  If he argues that you've given him earlier rides before, tell him that it "wasn't working out" for you to do that.  You don't need any better excuse, and don't give in to his demands for one.  YOU are the one doing HIM a favor.  <br>  <br>  As for collecting the money, then just go up to him and say, "Okay, your share of the gas money thus far is $x."  And then stand there until he gives it to you.  If he puts you off saying he doesn't have it with him, be firm and tell him that you'll give him until x day to give you a check for $x.  And tell him that you'll collect the gas money every Friday or whatever from here on out.  The threat to stop giving him rides can remain unspoken -- it's more ominous that way.

There was this Big Bang!!! And a maggot went through space and happened to fall here on the earth. Along with the earth. then this little maggot was covered with water so it became a frog. And then. That frog leaped out of this pond and couldn't get back in. So it had to learn to walk upright. Then it got cold so this frog had to walk somewhere. It had not noticed it was walking upright until it saw it had hairy legs because of the cold. Then strangely it had a hairy face and instead of croaking, a sound came out of it's mouth and it thought I am a man!!! That's what I am , a man !! Now I will go and and see what that other good looking creature is. It was a Wo-man. Or so it thought. But it happened to be another man just like himself. That's how homos came to be.

I hope you don't become an atheist because God is a real lliving spiritual being.  God has given humankind...man...the freedom to make choices.  We make choices every day.

Some people make bad choices...to rape, to murder, to start wars etc.  God will not take their right to make choices away either.  But a lot of people make good choices...to love, to care, to help others...There are people who love & those who hate, people who are bad & those who are good.  Now we have a conflict, a war between the bad & the good.  In time, God will raise up someone to bring peace, to work out the problems.  Just because bad exists does not mean God does not exist...He does.<br>  <br>  I would sugest that you talk to God...yes, talk to God.

wB3AbJyLaa	Nothing in history can be proven the way we can prove something in a laboratory. However, the resurrection of Jesus is a historical fact much more fully attested to than most other events of the ancient history we take for granted. Every effort to account for the birth of the church apart from Jesus' resurrection flies in the face of what we know about the first-century history and culture. If you don't shot-circuit the process with the philosophical bias against the possibility of miracle, the resurrection of Jesus has the most evidence for it. However, the problem is that people do short-circuit the investigation. Instead of doing the work of answering these very tough historical questions and then following the answers where they lead, they bail out with the objection that miracles are impossible. N. T. Wright makes a scathing response: "The early Christians did not invent the empty tomb and the meetings or sightings of the risen Jesus....Nobody was expecting this kind of thing; no kind of conversion experience would have invented it, no matter how guilty they felt, no matter how many hours they pored over the scriptures. To suggest otherwise is to stop doing history and enter into a fantasy world of own own." I sympathize with the person who says, "So what if I can't think of an alternate explanation?  The resurrection just couldn't happen." Let's not forget, however, that the first-century people felt exactly the same way. They found the resurrection just as inconceivable as you do.|`|QLDMmp6Taa	There's nothing you can do about it.  <br>  <br>  My mom and dad took my brother when he was very little to someone that had the gift of healing.  He was born half brain dead and was paralyzed.  The man healed my brother, and he was standing up in his crib the very next day.  The doctors had told my parents that he MIGHT be able to walk someday.  Boy were they amazed at the next appointment!<br>  <br>  They couldn't explain how it could have happened.  Today, my brother is a normal person, works full time as an iron worker, and has a wife and kids.  Yeah.  Sure Miracles don't happen.  People don't believe me when I tell them that either, and they will say it was just coincidence.  Sure.  Whatever.<br>  <br>  There's nothing you can do to change his mind.  The sooner you accept that and start praying for him, the better off you'll both be.|`|WX1b747Iaa	Your friend is trying not to harden their heart to critical thinking by accepting Jesus' 'miracles' without proof. That would make them ignorant.|`|AA10988107	Jesus has shown what he can do when his kingdom comes and the world will be full of people to need all kinds of cures, he must make all things perfect and as new as before Eden, he can do it. Rev.21:1-5.|`|TinNG7k7aa	Provide real proof, evidence that such things actually occurred. Physical proof would be the best, not just some rehashed mumbo-jumbo.|`|UH1ipgJmaa	Cut your freindship from that Atheist..............|`|gRObakpZaa	Show him the proof. Better yet, ask God to appear and tell him/her himself.|`|8b35140fd5eabcceff1f6c71562a2a02aa	Think back to before you got saved you probably had loads of questions, no doubt made lots of comments, had lots of opinions etc, many of which just did not make sense until after you got born-again.<br>  <br>  My advice would be to pray for him, God knows exactly where your friend is on his journey of life and if God is after him, which it sounds like he is, then God will change his mind.<br>  <br>  I was reading about Moses when God told Moses to go to Pharoah and ask him to let him his people go.  However, God told Moses that he would harden Pharoah's heart so that he would not let the people go.  Exodus 7.  The point I am making here is - wouldnt it have been much easier for Moses just to go ask Pharoah and God make it that Pharoah agree?  There clearly was a lot that Pharoah and the Egyptians and the Israelites - and even Moses - had to learn - some were nasty hard lessons unfortunately but God has a plan for everyone!<br>  <br>  Hopefully your friend wont have to suffer plagues or slavery etc before he believes but hey, think of all you have been through on your journey and how blessed you have been as much by the good times as you have through the not-so-easy times. <br>  <br>  Even as a devout christian I bet you still have questions some that niggle you, so dont be so hard on your friend!  Prayer is powerful.  Commit him to God, dont talk about the miracle thing for a while, see what happens. He'll no doubt have lots of other questions!<br>  <br>  Every blessing.|`|6354f9b17eeb910a803f8ef20a4505afaa	Jeremiah 33:3  The Lord says, "Call unto Me and I will answer thee and show thee great and mighty things which thou knowest not."<br>  <br>  Ask God to show you a mighty thing and to let your atheist friend to be with you when He does.  You can't convert your friend.  It is Christ who changes hearts and minds, not us.  Pray for him without ceasing and even try fasting for his salvation.|`|4boTYkt7aa	There is really nothing you can do.Your friend will not believe until he wants to.Jesus told us as Christians to tell people about salvation,but He knew that some would not believe.In one part of His talk to His apostles,He told them to go into a city and preach the truth and if they do not want to receive the truth,they were to leave the city and kick the dust from their heels.I hope one day,your friend will hear you.May peace be with you,my friend.|`|iHDYncuXaa	Ephesians 4:18<br>  They are darkened in their understanding and separated from the life of God because of the ignorance that is in them due to the hardening of their hearts.|`|E7fguoVBaa	Don't try to convert someone.  Just discuss and have an interchange of ideas.|`|AA10894901	But they are to some people.|`|3159ba3bf7bf777ace6d092394020e75aa	What makes you think they're real?  Can you prove it to yourself?  If not, you can't prove it to him either.|`|WY1TQyv8aa	Why don't you just accept your friend's "atheism" at face value for now and then listen to them closely when they talk.  Eventually people who call themselves atheists will say something contrary to atheism.  When they do, jump on it like a rat with cheese.<br>  <br>  Unless your friend is particularly intelligent, they WILL do this eventually.  I've never known an atheist who hasn't ... and I have known a LOT of atheists.  They all end up converting to agnostic or Wicca or Satanism or something.<br>  <br>  Give me a negative rating if you want atheists, but a lot of you just call yourselves that because you're either mad at Jesus or "atheism is cool."  I'm sure some of you truly reject spiritualism, but not nearly as many of you that claim to.|`|Y9u1kXozaa	Actually not just Christians believe in the miracles of Jesus, Muslims do too......<br>  <br>  You can't really prove it to him unless he reads the Qur'an or something that hasnt really been corrupted and clearly comes off as something not written by humans.  However, it's said that God conceals the truth from those he chooses, so don't worry so much about your friend, it may be God's will, but ask him this<br>  <br>  What happened before time?  SInce time is invented by man since the big bang, what was there before?  What was at the beginning(and not just the beginning of this parallel universe)|`|8599c16fb8c024a84d9e0e7d395be5baaa	Seriously? That shocked you? Nobody believes they were real, except Christians...<br>  <br>  You have been trying to convert him for months and only now do you find out that atheists don't believe Jesus performed miracles. Hm, maybe you should consider listening to others for a change?|`|SsIWhrUyaa	I am not a person of faith. I want to believe, but everytime i try to convince myself that there is a big boss, my mind gets attacked by scientific thoughts, and i find myself defeated. I read the other answers on this site. The question "What happened before time." Time had no beginning and will never end, for there will always be a before that, and a after that, just like the universe has no end, or if it has there will be an endless row of " What is on the outside of that?" (Just saying that that question will not make me believe.) however impossible things do happen from time to time, like endlessnes. or premenitions or people of faith getting healed or saved from a sure death situation. i know that it is possible for a god to exist but i dont believe any of the stories. the books are man made and man will do anything for power. and the best way to obtain power is to convince people that you talk with god and can have him strike people down with lightning. But i think that it is wise to have faith. It gives hope when life is hard. it sometimes makes people come together to do good, and it starts wars so the world do not over populate. If you can converte your friend i think that would be cool, but have this in mind. If god wanted ALL to believe he could just appear, and live among us. he has the power to, right? ;) Maybe it is his will that not all should believe. Why else make us doubt?|`|3a9f326d01ff48571ab8b07403c16d21aa	I was once in the direct path of an out of control boat that would have flattened me dead. I remember my Mom shouting Jesus save Tommie Glen. The boat made a mysterious turn and crashed on to the bank across from me. Explain this miracle to me please. I am still alive.|`|uLYlQMs3aa	You can't... and it is not up to you to convert. That is God's Job not yours. He does not believe, and short of providing a true miracle he won't believe. In today's world even if you could produce "through God" you'd be counted as Wiccan anyways.|`|AA11427300	Miracles still happen today,we only need to recognize them by the revelation of the Holy Spirit...this happens with discernment after you have accepted Christ as your Savior, the birth of a healthy child is a miracle|`|wMrWVOsZaa	Quite simply " You're wrong."<br>  <br>  "When did you become a bible scholar?"|`|9SH8m1fEaa	Here a good tip, gather up all of your evidence (things you can actually touch and feel, aside from the Bible) oh...you don;t have evidence? Stop trying to convert him then.|`|cbtKJFNvaa	Give him proof.|`|G2yUpoqfaa	Explain to him what is "devout Christian" and maybe he will be right.   What is devout?  What is "christian?"   <br>  <br>  You ask the world to assume that you are right --without evidence.  Why are you "christian?"  Why should anyone believe you are "devout?"  Just because you are "christian" does not mean you are going to save your soul.  The atheist would welcome the assurance of eternity.  <br>  <br>  What is your evidence?   Prove what you believe.  From whence comes what you profess?    Is what you believe what Christ believes?  What He teaches?  In His Perfect, Divinely Instituted Church?  Are you a First Century Christian?  Or a Fifteenth Century Apostate following Luther-Wyclif-Knox-Wesley, et al?  Perhaps you are a Twentieth Century  Vatican II "christian."  <br>  <br>  Tell the atheist who you really are and listen if he thinks you are "christian" or Christian.  Outside the CATHOLIC Church there is no salvation.   But this does not mean the apostate "catholic church of 1958-2009" since the impostor popes have stolen it.  In 1958 Pope Pius XII reigned as the last pope on earth.  The Catholic Church is decidedly hidden in plain view today. <br>  <br>  The atheist thinks he does not believe in God.   He does believe in Him.  He just hates Him and he hates Him through the "christians" he sees everywhere.  He sees all men today, those "christian" and those calling themselves "catholic-christian" (who seem embarrassed to call themselves catholic--they can't prove the claim anyway),  all blended together.  They ought to be embarrassed for having given up the True Faith--but they are <br>  not.  They have trashed everything--but still call themselves "catholic."  Luther trashed everything and called himself "christian."  Who is "devout" anymore? <br>  <br>  No wonder the poor atheist cannot find bottom.  Catholics have become Roman Protestants, admitting they were wrong before.  Protestants call themselves right.   Roman Protestants let them do it.  Nevermind that they, formerly Catholic, trashed everything, too.  Luther told them to trash everything in his day.  They did it.  The missionary zeal is over.   Mankind's desire is to find God, and to find Him Perfect, and to find His Church Perfect, and to secure for himself a place in eternity to know, love and adore that God that everyone claims they are devout about.  The atheist wants to find a religion so perfect that it will not trash itself, revise itself, throw out its own scriptures and rewrite the Words of Christ.  All the "revisionists" are the same in that the former Catholics have everything in common with the Protestants, who call themselves "christian."  They are all Protestants now.  This change-over and revisionism, the revised this and revised that makes everything pretty disgusting to an atheist.   He has this in common with God.  No fallen-away Catholics have to look to God for approval for their disloyalty.  God is disgusted with them.   Perhaps God is very pleased by the disgust the atheist has toward those who only profess <br>  "devotion."  God has it, too.  <br>  <br>  He would probably seek the full Catholic Truth if he knew where it was.  In his eyes the world of "christians" has homogenized itself and he cannot tell the true Christians from the pseudo-christians.  He wishes that they all did not hate God so much,...   Perhaps it is the atheist who has the truest view.  He will not take a chance on blaspheming the true God, and he cannot tell which is which.  Is God "christian" "romanchristian" or neither? <br>  <br>  The atheist perhaps knows more than you think.   It is just possible that he knows that Outside Of The Catholic Church There Is No Salvation. [Papally proclaimed by twelve popes eighteen times!!] And he knows that it is not the 10,000 bands of Protestant churches, nor the full-blown deviate, the Novus Ordo "catholics" of 1958, departers from Catholic Doctrine, who make this claim.  That he knows.  But he can't find where that True Catholic Church went!|`|sZ3nGSNNaa	Matthew 12<br>  <br>   38Then some of the Pharisees and teachers of the law said to him, "Teacher, we want to see a miraculous sign from you." <br>   39He answered, "A wicked and adulterous generation asks for a miraculous sign! But none will be given it except the sign of the prophet Jonah. 40For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of a huge fish, so the Son of Man will be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth. 41The men of Nineveh will stand up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it; for they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and now one[e] greater than Jonah is here. 42The Queen of the South will rise at the judgment with this generation and condemn it; for she came from the ends of the earth to listen to Solomon's wisdom, and now one greater than Solomon is here. <br>  <br>  <br>  2 Corinthians 4<br>  <br>   3And even if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled to those who are perishing. 4The god of this age has blinded the minds of unbelievers, so that they cannot see the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God.<br>  <br>  1 Corinthians 14<br>  <br>  20Brothers, stop thinking like children. In regard to evil be infants, but in your thinking be adults. 21In the Law it is written: <br>     "Through men of strange tongues <br>        and through the lips of foreigners <br>     I will speak to this people, <br>        but even then they will not listen to me,"[f] says the Lord. <br>  <br>   22Tongues, then, are a sign, not for believers but for unbelievers; prophecy, however, is for believers, not for unbelievers. 23So if the whole church comes together and everyone speaks in tongues, and some who do not understand[g] or some unbelievers come in, will they not say that you are out of your mind? 24But if an unbeliever or someone who does not understand[h]comes in while everybody is prophesying, he will be convinced by all that he is a sinner and will be judged by all, 25and the secrets of his heart will be laid bare. So he will fall down and worship God, exclaiming, "God is really among you!"<br>  <br>  Luke 12<br>  <br>  46The master of that servant will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour he is not aware of. He will cut him to pieces and assign him a place with the unbelievers. <br>  <br>   47"That servant who knows his master's will and does not get ready or does not do what his master wants will be beaten with many blows. 48But the one who does not know and does things deserving punishment will be beaten with few blows. From everyone who has been given much, much will be demanded; and from the one who has been entrusted with much, much more will be asked.<br>  <br>  1 Corinthians 1<br>  <br>  18For the message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God. 19For it is written: <br>     "I will destroy the wisdom of the wise; <br>        the intelligence of the intelligent I will frustrate."[c] <br>   20Where is the wise man? Where is the scholar? Where is the philosopher of this age? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of the world? 21For since in the wisdom of God the world through its wisdom did not know him, God was pleased through the foolishness of what was preached to save those who believe. 22Jews demand miraculous signs and Greeks look for wisdom, 23but we preach Christ crucified: a stumbling block to Jews and foolishness to Gentiles, 24but to those whom God has called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God. 25For the foolishness of God is wiser than man's wisdom, and the weakness of God is stronger than man's strength. <br>  <br>   26Brothers, think of what you were when you were called. Not many of you were wise by human standards; not many were influential; not many were of noble birth. 27But God chose the foolish things of the world to shame the wise; God chose the weak things of the world to shame the strong. 28He chose the lowly things of this world and the despised things—and the things that are not—to nullify the things that are, 29so that no one may boast before him. 30It is because of him that you are in Christ Jesus, who has become for us wisdom from God—that is, our righteousness, holiness and redemption. 31Therefore, as it is written: "Let him who boasts boast in the Lord."[d]

This is 1 of the most annoying things. So many places need at least 1 bilingual person just for those who are too lazy to learn the language.

They refuse to learn the language and they need to be deported.|`|JRKJ1w3Zaa	?no habla engles?<br>  <br>  so what that's not your problem|`|cwsYM2F4aa	Sigh.  If it's really not affecting your life, what do you really care?  I mean, you sound pretty condescending towards them anyway, so they probably don't want to learn the language so just they won't have to listen to you and so many others berate and whine about them.  I can't blame them for that.<br>  <br>  I don't think you have any idea how difficult it is to learn a foreign language.  If it wasn't, they would all know it.  I'm sure it's not easy living in a country where they can't understand the language that the majority speaks.  They are just trying to improve the quality of their lives by living and working here.  If you were in their shoes, I'm sure you would do the same.<br>  <br>  Cut them some slack and try not to be so contemptful toward something you've never been through.<br>  <br>  So obviously, my answer is no.  I would not petition with you.|`|8WPpcjhCaa	Uh what about the ignorant people that go to Europe, on their little trips to Italy and Spain and France and don't know one word of their language.?? and expect everyone there to speak English with them while they're there?

The whole point for those people leaving their country was the "be free" idea.<br>  <br>  Its not your place to start a petition against someone speaking another language.  I'm sure you don't go to every country and bother to learn their language?<br>  <br>  It seems like a waste of energy to be so concerned about what language people are speaking in a free country.  If you don't like Spanish, then don't learn the language... but if you expect them to learn english, you might want to grab a spanish cd rom and start learning basic sentence structure.<br>  <br>  When you go to a resort in Mexico, you expect people in THEIR own country to learn english... there shouldnt be a double standard, don't you think?<br>  <br>  My dad was fresh off the boat greek more than 30 years ago... I was born in Canada.  He still has one of the thickest accents I've ever heard and most cant understand him.  But too bad for them... I dont speak greek... too bad for me.

Distinction in status, for instance. Like to say one is better than another. This leads to idol worship, similar to what the christians did when they began to worship Jesus instead of treat him as the Prophet he was. They just took it a step too far.. and kept running with it, up to what it is today. <br>  <br>  The Prophet (sallallahu 'alaihi wa sallam) has said: Do not over praise me as the Christians over-praised the son of Mary. I am His slave so say: 'Allah's slave and messenger' [Al-Bukhaari and Muslim] <br>  <br>  What is important about each Prophet and/or Messenger is the MESSAGE<br>  <br>  REMEMBER THIS:<br>  Hadith - Reported by an-Nasaa'ee (3/188). <br>  <br>  "… The most truthful speech is the Book of Allaah. The best way is the way of Muhammad. The worst of affairs are the novelties and every novelty is an innovation and every innovation is misguidance and every misguidance is in the Fire." [Saheeh according to Sheikh al-Albaanee in Saheeh Sunan in-Nasaa'ee (no. 1487)]|`|Bb6fQtl0aa	It is not permissible to celebrate the birthday of the Prophet, peace be upon him. This was an innovated practice that was never taught by the Prophet, peace be upon him, his family, or his Companions.<br>  <br>  And they were foremost in respecting the Messenger of Allaah, peace be upon him, and they did not celebrate his birthday.<br>  <br>  <br>  There is actually a detailed history to how and who introduced this terrible practice.

However, I personally was brought up not eating halal food at all. You can pray before eating. But thats because i was brought up in a western country.

I'm not 100% sure but my thoughts are that it is not enough to only choose an animal permitted for consumption, because the animal should be slaughtered in the halal way for it to be OK for a Muslim to eat.  A Muslim can only eat meat from permitted animals like chicken, cow, etc, if it has been slaughtered in the halal way. I know the gelatin is made from slaughtered animals, so if the cow was not slaughtered the halal way, I don't think it would be OK for a Muslim to eat that.<br>  But like I said, I am not 100% sure, I am just giving you my personal thoughts regarding it. Maybe someone else can give you a more definite answer with proof.
AA11682450	im working on a pretty long presentation on Human trafficking and i'd have to say yes it does.

tbeO3Lataa	I have a few suggestions for you.<br>  <br>  1. We do an annual "Enchilada lunch". We get together to make them, and then sell them on Sunday morning. Last year we raised more than $1,000, and we only had about 100 people! We do enchiladas because I live in New Mexico, and so it is a common food, but you could do something else like pasta or sandwiches.<br>  <br>  2. Ice cream socials. Easy, fun, sweet. We bought ice cream in bulk (from Sam's Club), and toppings, and then charged people, I think, $5 for a scoop (it is a fundraiser after all) with toppings.<br>  <br>  3. We did a talent show one year with the children and youth of the church. We charged people and "entry fee" (usually they don't mind because they know it is going to a good cause), and we all did our talents. It was a hit!<br>  <br>  4. Because you said you have a lot of older people in your church, how about organizing something like a 50's themed dance/dinner night. You could play swing music, and even cater it yourselves, and just charge people to get it. That would be fun!|`|XxQVSzGiaa	Because the people are older, you could go to their houses and offer to help around the yard or inside of there houses for a fair price.

bda465ikaa	You actually have a good point. Scotland feels as if they were slighted in the union of the crowns. When the present Queen Elizabeth was numbered II, some people felt that she was the first Queen Elizabeth of Britain (the previous one had been sovereign of only England).<br>  - The solution was to go ahead and number her Elizabeth II, but that the agreement in the future would be to count Scottish monarchs in the numbering system for future sovereigns, The next King James will be numbered 8, and not 3.<br>  - Many people feel that Prince Charles will use another name when he ascends to the throne. Charles has had bad connotations associated with the two previous kings. It has been suggested that he will follow his grandfather and use his 4th name of George. Personally, I think it would be a nice gesture if he ruled as James the 8th.|`|H08vPJ2Maa	Because James was (VI) King of Scotland as well as England.

1NO10YfPaa	I was born in 1946 and remember the epidemics of the early fifties, probably because my father was a polio survivor. He had polio in 1905 when he was four years old.  His right leg was an inch shorter and a lot smaller than his left; but, he managed to walk and get around very well until his late eighties when what they call post polio Syndrome put him back in a wheel chair.  He lived to be 97.<br>  <br>  At any rate, this all made my parents very much aware of polio and I was immunized on the first day it was available at our doctor's office.  This was the Salk vaccine that was given in the arm.<br>  <br>  In 1963 our city, Jacksonville FL, had a polio epidemic; and, everyone was asked to take the new Sabin vaccine which was taken by mouth, even if their immunizations were up to date which mine was. They gave the vaccines out free at schools, etc.  We lived next to a school, I ran over with a little cardboard box and got a bunch of them on napkins for my family.  They would give you as many as you wanted.  Little white sugar cubes with a pink stain (the vaccine) in the middle.   My parent's, sister, niece, and I were sitting around chewing ours when my brother-in-law came in and told us that Lee Harvey Oswald had been shot.  It was November 24, 1963.<br>  <br>  As my father's caregiver in his later years I learned quite a lot about polio.<br>  <br>  Polio is a common virus, a lot more common back then than today, that in most people just produces cold like symptoms; but, for unknown reasons, in some people it develops into full blown infantile paralysis.  <br>  <br>  Most people, especially back then, came in contact with it at sometime while they were still nursing and protected by their mother's immune system, and they just came down with cold like systems, if that, but had from then on a life long immunity of sorts.<br>  <br>  Someone who did not come into contact with the virus while still protected by their mother's immune system would be more likely to get sick and even develop full blown polio later on if they did come into contact with the virus.  That is what happened to FDR.<br>  <br>  If you can follow what I am trying to say here is that cleanliness is generally a very good thing; but, the increased cleanliness of the twentieth century was not such a good thing as concerns polio as it managed to delay, for many people, contact with the virus until they were no longer protected by their mother's immune system.<br>  <br>  The mother's,  of course, had developed an immunity when they came in contact with the virus while still protected by their mother's immune systems.<br>  <br>  The fact that increasing fewer children were being nursed by their mother's at the time also played a role.<br>  <br>  NOW AS FOR THE WATER!!!  It is quite simple really.  Polio is found in fecal matter.  Children poop in pools or do not clean themselves properly, the virus is transferred to the water and into the mouth.  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.health.state.ny.us/diseases/communicable/poliomyelitis/fact_sheet.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.health.state.ny.us/diseases/c...</a><br>  <br>  Some years ago, I wrote on a webpage about my father and polio.  It is still there.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://members.fortunecity.com/northsider/polio.html" rel="nofollow">http://members.fortunecity.com/northside...</a>|`|AA11100707	Re: the water thing, I had forgotten about that and still don't know why it was an issue, but I wasn't allowed to go to public pools either.<br>  <br>  I also remember my mother making me a nap every afternoon as someone told her that was necessary to avoid being beset by polio.<br>  <br>  And the pictures of iron lungs scared the gabeebees out of me - I was around 7 or 8|`|ur3vgbXoaa	Yes it was scary for everybody.  It sure cut out a lot of good times at the swimming pool and the creeks.  Nobody was sure - so they completely cut out the swimming and contact with outdoor water.<br>  Also no drinking fountains were open.  <br>  <br>  That's all I remember other than one person I know now was put in an iron lung.  She said that the big burley guy who placed her in the iron lung had her leg bent backwards and no matter how hard she screamed and tried to tell him, he would not pay any attention to her. <br>  I think she had to stay in there for a long time.   She swears that he is the reason for her crippled leg today.<br>  <br>  She is an older adult now, but I don't see why she didn't find that guy after she grew up and 'have a word' with him!|`|W8bs2VQSaa	Yes, my elder sister had it really badly. She was in an "iron lung", an early form of life support, for a year, which was terrible. She could only have visitors once a week, and no children, so I didn't see her for that year. She was left with a severely withered leg, and had to wear built-up shoes forever after. But she was very resilient, had a lot of therapy, and ended up becoming a nurse, and a very accomplished ballroom dancer. When she was dancing you'd never know there was anything wrong with her. <br>  <br>  People today wouldn't have even heard of it, since it is so well controlled by vaccination. Thank heavens we have good public health measures in place now.|`|IDWlqSY2aa	I had a slight case of polio when I was 10 (1950) .  It did not leave me crippled tho. I sure was sick at the time. Now that I am a senior I have terrible leg problems.  My polio it seems affected my legs and I didn't know it at the time. I have been recently been diagnosed as having Post Polio Syndrome.  Not many people are aware of this . So if you are having leg problems please have your dr check it out.|`|ku2tP4eEaa	I remember standing in line for the shot.  At that age I could have cared less what caused polio.  Yes, I have seen the PBS documentary about polio, very interesting.|`|AA12045802	Yes,in the mid 40's at age seven we were very frightened that we may catch it.|`|qxteTM9Kaa	I remember lining up to get sugar cubes at the local high school|`|U31gt85xaa	The polio outbreak in the UK was in the early 50's and I was one of the unlucky children (aged 11/12 years)  who contracted the disease although not severely.<br>  I had partial paralysis down the whole of the my right side of my body and suffered with fluid on the brain causing fever and hallucinations.<br>  At that particular time, the possibility of the polio vaccine was in it's infancy and not available by immunization like today.<br>  I was admitted to hospital and given drugs to try to control the severity of the attack.......I was one of the lucky ones, I survived with some good nursing care and physiotherapy and was only left with a weak right side particularly around the knee joint and partial loss of calf muscle. <br>  The doctors could not determine 100% how I caught polio., but there was a suggestion that my immune system was at a low ebb following a previous illness and I had drunk some contaminated water although nothing was ever proved..|`|SfGyzMSFaa	I was born after the polio vaccines were developed and in common use. I do remember the vaccines; I had both the 'sugar cubes' and the injections. My aunt had polio and was sick for quite awhile, she had permanent damage to muscles in her shoulders, neck, chest and one leg. She now has post-polio syndrome; muscle weakness, trouble breathing, and other symptoms.<br>  <br>  There were many more than one polio outbreak in the US. The first epidemic outbreak of polio in the US happened in 1894, in Vermont. There was a large outbreak in New York City in 1916. By the  1930s outbreaks occurred nearly every summer. 1952 was the 'peak' year; when the epidemic spread to many towns and infected many people. This was 6 years before I was born.<br>  <br>  The virus that causes polio is very easily spread; which is why public pools were closed, large gatherings were cancelled, and some pretty harsh quarantine measures were done in some towns. The polio virus can be spread by contaminated water; and I'm not sure how well public pools were maintained, but there was probably a good deal of panic too.<br>  <br>  From the March of Dimes website:<br>  What is polio?<br>  Polio is a disease that can infect the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) and cause lasting disabilities in a small number of infected individuals. It is caused by any of three types of polio viruses. Polio infection is most common in infants and children, but young adults and some older people get it, too (2). <br>  <br>  Up to 95 percent of individuals with a polio infection have no symptoms (1). A small number (4 to 8 percent) have mild symptoms, such as a sore throat, headache, malaise, upset stomach and low-grade fever (1). These individuals generally recover completely within a week. <br>  <br>  However, from the digestive tract (stomach and intestines), the virus can get into the blood stream and be carried to the central nervous system. About 1 to 2 percent of infected individuals develop a high fever, meningitis (inflammation of membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord), stiff neck and limb pain (1). These individuals generally recover completely, usually within 10 days (1). <br>  <br>  In fewer than 1 of every 100 infected persons, the virus attacks nerves inside the spine that send messages to muscles in arms, legs and other areas (1). This can result in partial or complete paralysis. If the virus gets into the brainstem (bulbar polio), muscles needed for breathing, swallowing and other vital functions become paralyzed, and the person may die. <br>  <br>  How does polio spread? <br>  The virus is spread from person to person by contact with infected secretions from the nose or mouth or by contact with infected feces. It usually enters the body when the person ingests contaminated food or water or touches the mouth with contaminated hands. <br>  <br>  Polio Quick Reference Fact Sheet<br>  March of Dimes<br>  <a href="http://search.marchofdimes.com/cgi-bin/MsmGo.exe?grab_id=6&page_id=984320&query=polio&hiword=POLI+POLIOS+polio+" rel="nofollow">http://search.marchofdimes.com/cgi-bin/M...</a>|`|y7HD8unTaa	I was 3 when one of my aunts came to live with us.  She had Polio & then a stroke & then Tuberculosis & she died at home in a hospital bed that was in the dining room.  We were under quarantine & no one could come in or out without the health department knowing about it.  Children were not allowed to swim in or play with "dirty" water.  My mother became a clean freak & was constantly using alcohol & lysol & special hospital soaps.  Everything was sanitized & sterilized with bleach too.  If we broke a nail...we were almost hospitalized.  Weekly shots of penicillin & hospital staff that seemed to have cared less if we lived until their "procedures" were completed.  Drawing blood in those days was like a scene from a sci-fi thriller.  I just can't watch certain scenes in movies once I know what's coming.|`|a380da2fafb5a1c092370a06829451f8aa	I watched that too.  Wasn't it good???  I was born in '50, but remember that time.  We always came in to rest during the afternoons.  Seems like they thought (or knew?) that getting overheated raised the chance of infection.  And I remember getting the sugar cubes.<br>  I also remember a young woman in our local hospital in an iron lung for years.  I don't remember how long she survived in that condition.|`|3e342b4c35254658976e2faf3d9365f0aa	Poliomyelitis is now nearly extinct in the world.

Idon't remember how he got it, but I do remember them telling us not to swim in the river...weird,huh?  Big ol' river and we couldn't go swimming for awhile.  It was  the 1953-54 school year...I was 12.|`|Dmaahsc3aa	1953, I was nine and a girl in our school caught polio.......We were given shots as a precaution so we would not catch it. Dr. Salk invented the killed virus vaccine given with a shot and then Dr. Sabin came up with the live virus vaccine which is the sugar cube. . . Sabin invented it right here in my hometown of Cincinnati. . . I think he died about 15 years ago, but his son has also gone into medical research. . . . <br>  I loved that show on PBS too, as it brought back memories !|`|UBxKqdPwaa	I remember very lengthy lessons on hygiene in school and the teachers being very careful to check us to be sure we washed our hands and only coughed in tissues and so forth.  One girl from my class was sent away to a big hospital to be placed in an "iron lung" and eventually our local hospital got a couple.  One girl from my brother's class had her tonsils removed and then went swimming in the local pool the next day and she caught it and died. We were all so very glad when the Salk shots were developed and somewhat later the oral vaccines.  It was a very terrifying thing during those years.  I never heard that it was contracted from water.|`|GrKiEDb1aa	A friend of mine contracted polio in the 2nd grade (1955).  His right arm is nothing but skin and bone.  Growing up he was a tall lanky kid. We graduated in 1965 and I never saw him again until 1995 at our 30th class reunion (I missed our 5th while in Japan, our 10th while in Sardinia, and out 20th while in Israel).  When I saw Howard in May of 1995, I wouldn't have recognized him if it wasn't for his right arm. He looked like a half back!  Gone was the tall skinny kid and some huge, well built hulk had taken his place.<br>  We didn't think we caught polio FROM the water, but it could be TRANSMITTED in the water....public pools in particular.|`|bf4cc388616ba9cb48357f54373c609eaa	At one point in time the source of poliomyelitis was not certain and stagnant water was a common property in the environment of many areas where the disease was the most prevalent. When you are not certain, a shotgun approach is adopted, in hopes that you will eliminate the source.

sZFLtCbdaa	I gargle with warm salt water at least 3 times a day. <br>  If that doesn't solve it, then off to the doctors I go.<br>  In your case, I would have gone to the doctors like yesterday. You do say that it has traveled to your ear. The next stop will be your sinuses. <br>  Like others have mentioned, lemon juice mixed with honey, followed by some ginger tea. After you had that mixture, chased it down with some whiskey. At the very least, you'll feel mellow until you make that doctor's appointment.|`|x7OeeOKkaa	No miracle cure.  Either it's viral (in which case it'll have to work itself through and your immune system clear the infection) or bacterial (in which case antibiotics might work).  <br>  <br>  The only way of finding out which it is to have a tissue culture taken by a doctor (who don't often do that, as it's expensive, invasive and sore throats are usually self-limiting anyway)<br>  <br>  I'd recommend paracetamol rather than ibuprofen (easier on the stomach and better pain relief/fever reduction), drink plenty of fluids and rest.  There's not really much else you can do, especially after only two days.  If it's not resolved after 5 days, or gets worse, see your doctor.|`|FATyhyZ2aa	For temp. relief of ear ache (until Dr.'s visit), take 1-2 cups white or brown rice (not instant) & place in clean athletic (thick) sock.  Place in microwave 1-2 minutes (stay there & watch for burning).  Remove & test heat.  Can place directly on ear or wrap in towel if too hot then remove towel later for the rest of heat.<br>  <br>  But it's just a symptomatic relief.  Have Dr. find source of pain.  Any baterial infection near brain is serious matter.|`|HIkXnqfzaa	gargle with salt and water.<br>  <br>  otherwise take a trip to the shop <br>  <br>  buy pot of honey and some lemons<br>  <br>  boil kettle, soak 3/4 slices of lemon in a large mug of boiling water add two or three spoon fulls of honey allow to cool stirring until at a temp you can sip and drink slowly.|`|yS5uy9NBaa	My go to comfort thing is always Vick's.  I use it whenever I have anything going wrong from chest to eyebrows.  I don't know that it does anything really, tho I swear it can open my sinuses when I rub it on the pressure points, but we used it when I was a kid and it always feels like comfort and helps to make me go to sleep.|`|AA11100707	When I do not have Listerine to gargle with I use a mixture of salt and warm water. Salt diffuses infection and helps considerably.<br>  <br>  Avoid ANYTHING sugary. Sugar spreads infection.|`|SkzKyc6daa	disolvable aspirin is normally the best,gargle it at the back of the throat before swallowing.but seem as you dont have aspirin this advice prob wont help.|`|zXDVn4BQaa	That's serious.  You need a doctor.  Aspirin will relieve the pain but it won't cure the infection.|`|5AyoYsBkaa	A ********. Ahaa Works Everytime.|`|KgKVWv9paa	yeah, a doctor.  they have these great things called prescriptions.|`|lcg1u1U7aa	The only over the counter that will help will be antihistamines, allergy medications.  They will help to reduce the swelling and that will help with the pain.  The ibuprofen will also help as will aspirin.|`|bf4cc388616ba9cb48357f54373c609eaa	I would see a Doctor or go to a Emergency Clinic or Emergency Room at a hospital. My health is something that i take few risk with.|`|Dmaahsc3aa	Do you have a blow dryer for your hair ? ?   Put it on a low setting and blow the warm air into your ear. . . the warm air will sometimes relieve ear pain........gargle with salt water too.....Gosh I feel your pain !!  Hope you get better . . see your doctor as it could be strep throat !|`|YAWkCPqYaa	Manuka honey ,and pour boiled water over dried sage , let it sit 10 Min's , give a good stir , ,then gargle every hour or so ,|`|6ozmjp3xaa	You might have strep throat, so you should see a Dr.Try  garglring in salt warm water|`|WbKBHh8Haa	swallow a clove of garlic like a pill with a glass of milk.

Try another approach.|`|oI4Cudm8aa	If you have a question, ask it. <br>  "it is looked upon as false" is just nonsense. Who considers it to be false?

S4zNEAFJaa	One time a complete stranger told me that I look like someone who goes antique shopping a lot. To this day, I don't know if that was an insult or a compliment. It's very puzzling.|`|AA12312933	iv had so many wierd moments in my life up to this point and im sure iv many more to com, lol but i think that one of the moments tht sticks out in my mind is wen i was innocently waitin for my train and this guy came up to me and said ill pay u, i was like wat, he was like come on, ill pay u- nw im nt being suspicious but im sure he was offering to pay me for sex, eugghhhh, it wudnt be sooo wierd if i was remotely dressed in a sexy way but i had no make up on, was fully covered and even had a cold, oh and there was like 25 other people there too!!!!!!!!!!|`|kYItYRo9aa	hi

eMSP740Taa	No. People are paying to have "all they can eat". So they gotta let them have ALL they can eat! As simple as that! =]|`|6c1639b085f1a5fa992d7054377ac71faa	yes they can|`|r2JPcUN8aa	No.  A buffet is so people can truffle around like hogs.  Buffets encourage bad behaviour, bad hygiene and gluttony.|`|77700ae60cac2abd41d7a7f8bd98336aaa	As long as they are eating in the establishment no. It's an all you can eat buffet|`|AA11334468	They give you the bill when they think you've had enough|`|rpU209Xfaa	i don't think so...<br>  i mean, they paid right?<br>  and it is an all you can eat...<br>  so they can eat all they want...|`|SFai2Eb9aa	umm no, that sounds like me<br>  i eat wayyy too much than is consisdered normal|`|9XyACTtYaa	Well, if you're taking so much that no other costumer gets to have food, than yeah.<br>  <br>  But, it's a buffet, so it will take a ton of plates to be kicked out. Like 15. I don't think anyone would be able to stomach that unless they're 600 pounds.|`|cwsYM2F4aa	No.  Otherwise, it would not be called "all you can eat".  I'm thinking they could be sued if they did.  I've never seen a disclaimer on any buffet sign that said *Important Note--People who overconsume excessively will be asked to leave*.  That would be weird.|`|G6yyceAxaa	No, however they can ask a person not to return if they see a intimate health threat. in the interest of the health and safety of the customer|`|dT8tbGrLaa	Nope , you can sue if they do.|`|9btcOpxXaa	no, it's all you can eat<br>  but you could glare at them and be like, hey, maam, please save some food for the rest of us|`|AA11198190	l would say no.<br>  Regardless of how hungry a person is.....you can only take in so much.|`|AE6pB6mEaa	well thats the ultimate fear of the business|`|NzIywCkpaa	i don't think so... it is a buffet|`|87756LlTaa	Yes.  Restaurants are privately owned, and the owners have the right to serve, or stop serving, anyone they want at anytime they want.  The customer could get a lawyer, but he'd lose, and the lawyer would get rich.  Any privately owned business (which is all but a few of them) can kick you out whenever they want.|`|k6c1V8jXaa	well i mean its an "all you can eat buffet." they cant kick you out when you told them that they can eat all they want.<br>  <br>  as long as they pay for all of it, there is no way they could kick them out.|`|JGJKWpuvaa	'all you can eat' hun! <br>  <br>  <br>  but this buffet I've gone the lady gave the bill to this morbidly obese person...and out of shame, he stopped pigging out.|`|gbqqoaf6aa	It's called all u can eat buffetthat's's what all of the buffets are called.

hoGumKrHaa	This really depends on your area of the country but I would say at least...<br>  $400 week or $10/hr.<br>  Don't short yourself though, look at local newspaper (should have classifieds on line) and review what others are either offering to pay a nanny or what nanny's are listing as their rates.<br>  Good luck!
d1i3ac5baa	expose it , most people don't have a clue about the cruel way animals are killed using the halal practice.|`|dPJr1Lbmaa	Are you planning on ensuring the Kosher slaughter of animals is made illegal too? Or is your disdain only for how Muslims carry it out and not Jews? Just curious...<br>  While your at it why not call for all animal slaughtering to be made illegal see how that goes down with non muslim carnivores? Are you trying to tell me that is "humane" please...<br>  Now get of your wee soap box, and get a clue about what your talking about because so far you dont seem to have one.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT<br>  Go complain to the Jews then lets see how far you get...<br>  You slaugher how you like and the rest of us who follow Gods laws will continue to slaughter as he likes us too, kay? Good glad we have that cleared up I am off to fry me some steak, want some? Dont worry its 100% Halal ...|`|H8WqMK1eaa	I don't think "Immortal Verses" up there realizes that most animals in the United States are slaughtered in a "halal" way...they just happen to be stunned via a blow to the head or an electric shock first.<br>  <br>  Immortal Verses: Well, then halal means BARBARIC and CRUEL.  Because the heart of an unconscious animal still beats...and that way the blood can be drained when the neck is cut....the animal just isn't aware of it.|`|cd969f9c7a6bf20748a5b6528e2da246aa	Maybe you should actually learn what humane is, you idiot.  Lets club a cow over the head with a crow bar, or lets electrocute them, or lets throw them in the grinder(mcdonalds).  Who defines what inhumane? Plus animals are human.  Halal will always be legal. inshAllah<br>  <br>  @Natassia, I don't think You understand that slaughter of an unconscious animal is not Halal.  Learn about Islam before speaking about it!!!|`|BmSaQd0Zaa	Why would you go out of your way to come to this section to simply bad mouth muslims? <br>  In fact, the non-halal method of slaughter is, in my opinon, the worst. Animals are stunned, leaving them in spasms whilst still alive then the majority are cut at the neck also so what it the difference?<br>  <br>  Muslims wouldnt stun an animal for it to feel that unnecessary pain.<br>  <br>  We let the blood drain to keep the meat clean so what about this method of slaughter is wrong?|`|NlQhkgFCaa	The Islamic way of slaughtering an animal is the most merciful way upon the animal of doing it <br>  <a href="http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?c=Article_C&cid=1157365866876&pagename=Zone-English-HealthScience/HSELayout" rel="nofollow">http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satel...</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.halaljournal.com/?page=article&act=show&pid=3220&PHPSESSID=68bdc65604c0ced3de2c1e4c88b09885" rel="nofollow">http://www.halaljournal.com/?page=articl...</a><br>  <br>  Excellent article here <br>  <a href="http://www.iuhk.org/Eng/Publication/Fruitweek/2004/040312.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.iuhk.org/Eng/Publication/Frui...</a> <br>  or html format <br>  <a href="http://209.85.229.132/search?q=cache:FnGG_dbmDhgJ:www.iuhk.org/Eng/Publication/Fruitweek/2004/040312.pdf+Islamic+way+of+slaughtering+is+merciful&hl=en&ct=clnk&cd=9&gl=za" rel="nofollow">http://209.85.229.132/search?q=cache:FnG...</a>
HmakIJm3aa	Sexual harassment / assault is probably definitely illegal. It could also be misconstrued as an attempted rape.|`|4MLtp9g1aa	Don't know about bein' legal or not, but it might just get the livin' s**t kicked outta ya.|`|6R9McFZhaa	bad guy lol do you want to do to me lol|`|AA11615514	I would imagine that would be considered assault. If you then touched her breasts it would probably be considered sexual assault.|`|nUW4oioxaa	Taking something that does not belong to you is Theft. You will also have invaded her personal space which could be deemed as assault.|`|8QRmftlqaa	no its not legal its sexual harrasment lol|`|jQQYdfbhaa	Yes, it's probably illegal.<br>  <br>  BUT! What if you knew the person?<br>  OR! What if the person is dead?<br>  OR! What if the person was being lewd? Is it then illegal to harass someone who's indecently exposing themselves?<br>  <br>  Idk. Maybe I should repost this as a series of separate questions...|`|iMZOfZwtaa	its called sexual harassment/assault and it is illegal. and if the girl you do that to decides to kick your precious jewels, and you try to countersue for assault, no judge will have sympathy for you! it would be a really stupid thing to do! unless you like to wear orange and be violated on a daily basis!!|`|wt26nAb9aa	i would say it most likely is.<br>  similar to pulling down someones trousers or something in public. <br>  which is illegal im sure.<br>  <br>  but still it would be fun to do|`|zrmaX7YCaa	It would probably be classed as sexual assault.|`|fkBxYLB0aa	I think thats probably illegal, yes.
a1PcWRQOaa	she doesnt sound like a very good roommate at all. i would suggest moving somewhere else. i know it sounds tiring after just recently moving but you will be alot happier, safer, and healthier because you wont have the stress. it will also be easier to concentrate on your studies too if you have a happier relaxed home environment|`|HoHHpwDlaa	I'm not trying to sound mean or rude... but it's true. You did move in last.  If you can report her, then it's obvious that she can't smoke outside.  I dunno, deal with it or move out. If everyone was okay with it before, no one should have to change just because you're there. If you're living with 2-3 other roommates, they're prolly going to do things to tick you off. Find a 1 room apt. <br>  <br>  plus, i'd hate to get beat up. no doubt she's going to start messing with you if you keep up your babble.|`|6k5fhFyBaa	When living with other people you must be respectful. She is not being respectful by smoking indoors when it can't be tolerated by everyone. I would try to sit and come to agreements with her once again on the terms that if she won't cooperate you'll have to report her. Especially since most rental properties do not allow smoking indoors anyways.|`|851c6ba054fa621b9fc32855c092c444aa	If you wanna avoid problems with her, just pack up your stuff and go. If the management ask what the problem is, just tell them honestly what's going on, and you can't stand it anymore. If they want you to stay badly enough (of course, they want your rent), they'll resolve the issue with her.|`|DdFkTv29aa	I mean yeah, you should bust her, if she's being a jackass to you, then why not? If she get pissed off, then move somewhere else. Not that hard to do.|`|AA11570752	LET HER SMOKE<br>  if smoking offends you that much Move <br>  if moving cant happen smoke with her|`|9wdAKAGRaa	Honey, you should not subject yourself or let anyone subject you to something that can harm you physically such as smoking. It's not fair to smoke in the house if you live with non-smokers. Tell her that you're not asking her to not smoke, it's just that it makes you feel ill and it stinks up the house, and request that she smoke outside or at the very least always by an open window (making sure to blow her smoke outside). And if she persists, call management, or if you're afraid of her reaction, then get the heck outta there and find a new and improved living situation. I am a moderate smoker myself and I cannot stand inconsiderate smokers!!! I do not smoke around any of my nonsmoking friends or my non smoking boyfriend unless we are outside where there's enough clean air to go around. Good luck to you, and do not back down. Stand up for yourself and demand the respect that each and every one of us deserves.

For new surname: The name of a street where you once lived (or grew up).<br>  <br>  When I do that, my new name is Tabby Franklin!  What's yours?<br>  <br>  Response to your update:<br>  No, it would just be Captain Greening (you just use the name of the street, and leave out "Road," "Avenue," etc.).  Actually, if you shortened Captain to "Cap" you've got quite a soap opera name there!  LOL|`|InJ5SKd5aa	Max or Maxine Awesome|`|m9zVrgeNaa	Look at a name page and choose from there be original|`|lkNJNnlSaa	Jonathon Dorian (JD)|`|PPyMhRJAaa	Spartacus Nixon.
