20090222204324AAR9XHR	News & Events;Current Events	I dodged the vietnam draft proudly in 1969 and went to canada and came back in 1982, draft dodgers monument?	My fellow draft dodgers were trying to build a memorial in Nelson, BC to honor our courageous legacy to avoid the draft and stand up to what we believed was right      However the VFW and other organization got on this and trash talked this, and people begin boycotting my old town and attempting to bankrupt it and pretty much forced the canadian government to refuse to  it to be build.      I just want to say a few things. You say you fight for freedoms, yet we dont even have the freedom to build a monument. (Thanks to the VFW, Etc)   2. This is a slap in the face to us, trying to force us against our will to kill people or goto jail. To be a victim of this vietnam war. We have even right to be angry at what they tried to do to us and be able to build a monument, to thank Canada for taking us against our corrupt government during the time and dealing with misplaced power.      Agree?

Aquí en Espa?a cada vez hay más: Acaban de entrar a robar a las oficinas que hay debajo de mi departamento con una patada a la puerta que da a la escalera. Todos hemos oido el ruido, eran las 12 de la noche y ya no les importa que les oigan. Se han ido volando y cuando ha venido la policia ya no habia nadie.    Las leyes en Espa?a están muy blandas pero las quieren endurecer porque la gente ya esta preocupada.    Un vigilante el otro día mató a uno de los 4 delincuentes que entraban a robar a una casa y han metido en la carcel al pobre vigilante. Eran muy peligrosos y si no llega a disparar el, lo matan. Esto ya es bastante preocupante.

20090222210952AAKkAAl	News & Events;Current Events	Would this work if Obama and the government did it?	How about an incentive for people to lose weight like a stimulus package.Say you have to register with a doctor and if you are obese and you lose weight then Obama and the government will send you a check at the end of say 12 months for XXX amount of dollars for how much weight you lost and only if you lose enough to get down to your target weight or at least 50 lbs.   Say 50 lbs=500 dollars   100 lbs 1,000 dollars   and if you say lose half your body weight for those 300 lbs or more and get down to their ideal size of say 130 then they get 5 thousand dollars...it would help because you would have less fat people going to the doctor and in the long run would cost less to pay them than to pay for their fat related medical expenses..what do you think????? people do anything for money on tv why not this!!!!!!

Je croyais que les orientations sexuels des uns et des autres ne devaient pas intervenir en droit (comme dans le droit à l'embauche). Qui êtes vous donc pour les juger moins responsable ou moins garant d'une bonne éducation que les autres. A moins que vous ne donniez du crédit au moquerie des cours de récré et derrière ?a à l'homophobie.       Des milliers d'enfants risque de mourir tous les jours par manque de soin sanitaire, par la malnutrition, ou par la guerre. Mais non il ne faut pas qu'ils aient la possibilité de se faire adopter par un couple homo parce qu'il est très important qu'il ait une maman et un papa pour survivre en occident ....

If oil companies lowered gas to $1.00 a gallon, then more people could go out and put their hard earned money back into the economy, by shopping and going on short trips.The government could raise more road and bridge taxes as well. I haven't heard one politician mention the oil companies for lowering production so they can make more money by raising the price!
