20090224232434AAYkROW	Travel;Africa & Middle East;Other - Africa & Middle East	Possible studying in Tehran- what is it really like?	*Please no racist or intolerant comments,* I'm looking for a real idea of what it's like, preferably from someone who lives there or has been there. I don't need people's brainwashed or uninformed opinions. Thanks!      I obviously don't believe the rhetoric of most Americans, but I also don't entirely believe those people online who are trying to attract tourists and describe Iran as an open and inviting place. I'm sure it's somewhere in between, but I'd still like some insight...      A few specific things are still bothering me. I would have no problem dressing appropriately, it's just polite, or with avoiding alcohol. I want to know, though, just how strict people really are about things like music (I love my classical music!), political discussions (obviously if they're respectful and among friends) and free speech, or, yes, the rights of women.  While I don't believe Iranian women are "oppressed," I'm a little worried about the restrictions I've heard of. Would people blow me off I wanted to learn? Would it be difficult to make friends because of the gender barriers?      And if it's genunely too restrictive for an American woman to live there, what about just traveling? Thanks!      Thanks!      (And yes, I know Iran is not in the middle east, but I figured I would get fewer nasty remarks than I would in a broader category like Asia...)

20090225003842AAF5mH6	Travel;Africa & Middle East;United Arab Emirates	What is it they are using?	A while back I noticed that every once in a while they would spray the big trash cans opposite from our building. First this one guy would spray some sort of liquid and then the next would spray what looks like white smoke. If there is any wind the smoke or what ever it is will spread over the whole area around the trash can. As a precaution I do keep my windows facing that side shut when they do that.    Today I noticed the same thing at a villa I passed while out walking. It was so much smoke that I first thought the villa was on fire. But when I came closer I noticed that it is that white stuff they are spraying.    I was on the other side of the road, but because of the wind the stuff came over to where I was walking.   I was wondering now what is it they are using ? And is it dangerous, I was walking with my daughter at that time and I would be really concerned for her? I would think it wasn't because I can't imagine that they would spray it so lavishly around the neighborhood otherwise, but I just would like to know anyway what that stuff is. I guess the liquid they use first is some kind of pesticide, but why then spray that white smokey stuff?

20090225014632AArLXDv	Travel;Asia Pacific;Japan	Want to go to Japan, where should I start?	I want to go to Japan with my boyfriend. I am utterly confused as to where to go what to see and where to stay. I've been looking on the web but it's just confusing me more.       He's into Ninja's and Samuri's, I'm into Ghibli so the Ghibli museum is a must see. Also I just love all things "kawaii". We both love Ninja Warrior and Takeshi's Castle. We're both into gaming also and technology.      I don't think we would want to stay in Tokyo the whole time we're there so any rural areas any one can think of would also help.       I'm clearly not asking for much! ;)      I just need a push in the right direction but I would love to hear any of your suggestions!       Thanks!
20090225014716AAXQrqR	Travel;Asia Pacific;Other - Asia Pacific	I'm a U.S. Citizen Can I move to Saipan or GUAM?	Alright, so to clarify. I'm 25, and have worked in lots of places. Mostly Customer Service (retail, Fitness Gyms, Motorcycle Shops etc.)  I've gone to school (no degree yet) and studied Tagalog and Japanese and Mandarin on and off  for 4 years. I love these languages, and would like to be around them on a daily basis. I figured since Guam and Saipan have a very small white population (I'm white myself),  most with Asian, & Pinoy. Since they are both US territories, how hard would it be for me to pick up, get a job to get me by, rent out a room from someone, and just live amongst the natives? Nothing special. Anyone done this?
