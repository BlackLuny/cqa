c8828614b563cd3de41253b6a9e40991aa	I am a Christian because I had a personal encounter with Jesus Christ at age 30. At that time I was very involved with the pseudochristian cult my parents raised me in,and thought I was right. I wasn't.<br>  <br>  Being a Christian means that I have accepted Jesus Christ as my Saviour and Lord, and His Word as the guiding principles for my behaviour. I try to the best of my ability to show His love for others. <br>  <br>  I believe that after death the spirit returns to the God who created it. Those who have accepted the gift of salvation will live eternally in God's Presence. Those who have not will be eternally separated from Him, and eternally aware of that separation.<br>  <br>  I take it very seriously since Jesus saved my life and my sanity as well as my soul. And I will never be able to express my gratitude fully.|`|Z2gWKI4Oaa	i am catholic, and i believe in one god, which means that the father the son and the holy spirit are all one. and i believe that life after death is god will judge you if you believe in him and want to be with him he will allow you into heaven, if you reject him and you dont believe in him than he will send you to hell where you cant be with him.|`|RvddYKqjaa	I'm a Christian. I'm not in your generation though. I can tell you that we have a church full of kids who are in that generation though. They are there because they want to be. My faith is my religion. It's a faith that gets me through. When others are crying over some simple thing, I can see so far beyond that. My faith gives me that sight. The faith that comes from believing lifts me up so I can do things I didn't know I could do. I can stand in front of a group and tell them what my faith means to me, and I say things I didn't know I could say. I won't quote Bible verses to you. You can read the Bible for yourself. There is strength in those words. Don't worry about what others say about being a Christian. Just worry about yourself and how you can be a light to other people. Our Lord says that following him isn't always easy. Someone always wants to try to trip you up or cause you to question. You don't answer to anyone except yourself and your maker. <br>  The Bible says that we come from ashes and return to them. Our bodies fall away after death. Our spirits and souls live on. What we have done for others in need lives on. We live on in the hearts of those we love, including our heavenly Father. We dwell forever in that love.|`|Fdo2G5BZaa	I am of The True Christian Faith... I would think you might know what that means.<br>  if any one would like to know... it is quite a study...

People speak of seeing things when they die on the table, but this can easily be explained by the chemical reaction in our brains. Right before we die perhaps we all think we are entering some other dimension (a dream caused by our brains) and than we vanish into nothingness(which though there are atheist, we could never comprehend as we've never experienced this ourselves). We all die thinking we've got off somewhere.<br>  <br>  Though there is still the facts of science that keep me thinking 'maybe.' As there are the ideas of eternity (which also may not exist) and the boundaries of the universe (Cause though space is infinite it does have a border). Really all I'm saying is that such a topic isn't basic enough to have an answer. No one knows, but if they have an idea and would rather stick to it than spend there whole life pondering that's fine by me.|`|zXHHTyfpaa	I'm a Methodist, Christian.

"Christ") is a monotheistic religion centered on the life and teachings of Jesus as presented in the New Testament.<br>  <br>  Adherents of Christianity, known as Christians, believe that Jesus is the only begotten Son of God and the Messiah (Christ) prophesied in the Hebrew Bible (the part of scripture common to Christianity and Judaism). Christian theology claims that Jesus Christ is a teacher, the model of a virtuous life, the revealer of God, as well as an incarnation of God, and most importantly the savior of humanity who suffered, died, and was resurrected to bring about salvation from sin. Christians maintain that Jesus ascended into heaven, and most denominations teach that Jesus will return to judge the living and the dead, granting everlasting life to his followers. Christians call the message of Jesus Christ the Gospel ("good news") and hence label the earliest written accounts of his ministry as gospels.<br>  <br>  Like Judaism and Islam, Christianity is classified as an Abrahamic religion (see also Judeo-Christian). Christianity began as a Jewish sect in the eastern Mediterranean, quickly grew in size and influence over a few decades, and by the 4th century had become the dominant religion within the Roman Empire. During the Middle Ages, most of the remainder of Europe was christianized, with Christians also being a (sometimes large) religious minority in the Middle East, North Africa, and parts of India. Following the Age of Discovery, through missionary work and colonization, Christianity spread to the Americas and the rest of the world.<br>  <br>  Christianity has played a prominent role in the shaping of Western civilization at least since the 4th century. As of the early 21st century, Christianity has between 1.5 billion and 2.1 billion adherents, representing about a quarter to a third of the world's population.|`|TyjAcOQ7aa	My religion is Christian. I learn in many different ways. Here's a little bit about God... <br>  <br>   I am going to talk about God. God is the highest of all kings. He forgives us, and we will never<br>  be forgotten by him. He wrote a book called the Bible. In that Bible, he tells us his past times,<br>  and the lessons that will seek our future. The Bible is very powerful and reveals the most <br>  excruistiating things. God  is the only person who chooses to reveal his powers. That is why we<br>  have our lives we are living this very moment. Also, God does things for reasons. If you think<br>  that you are put in the hardest situation.. its for your own good. Maybe, if it means moving<br>  or even getting your car hit. Everything happens for a reason. It may seem weird at first, but <br>  you will know what I mean when you face a situation like a just had said. I am telling you <br>  about God because I think everyone should know him. The best thing to do to worship him is <br>  to 1.obey him 2. get good grades.. so that you can be successful 3. dont be negative but positive<br>  4. dont let stress or temptation get to you 5. pray<br>  The last thing I mentioned ( praying ) means to worship to God and either ask  him for <br>  forgiveness for your sins or to tell him your feelings. He will already know what you will say <br>  but, I think, you were sent here on Earth for a lesson. A lesson that revolves upon you and God.<br>  This lesson.. LIFE.. proves to God that you can love him over anything else.. good or bad..<br>  in the world that gets in your way. God has already planned how long you will live.. and what you<br>  SHOULD do on Earth, its just for you to do and find. Its not hard at all. All you have to <br>  do is be good. Do this, and your life will be granted full will. Do you sometimes think that if<br>  you disobey God he will not love you? Well, that is not one tiny bit true. He loves everyone no<br>  matter what they have done unto him. He forgives you and forgets if you just ask. The only <br>  people who will remember what you did wrong will be you and the other person associated with <br>  the problem or issue. Life, like I said, is hard... I will admit, but God is with you every single <br>  bit of every single day.|`|e67045ea08edd6bf714e0243622a0defaa	Short Version:<br>  I suppose I would label myself as a "Gnostic Christian".<br>  <br>  Long Version:<br>  I haven't always believed in "psychic" abilities. When I was younger I tried to ignore certain aspects of myself. I grew up in what I felt was a very religious family. Even my extended family members are religious. Not only did I fear being different from my ENTIRE family I feared the supposed repercussions that could happen to someone like myself. Repercussions that were believed by many people of this religion. From a very young age I inherently *knew* that a few things about this particular religion just weren't true... for me at least. :-)<br>  <br>  Through the years I have extensively studied many religions & belief systems in search of my truths. What I have come to find is that every religion is much too confining as well as conforming for my taste. I have come to understand that as there is zero scientific proof to completely support any entire belief system then there is no actual way to determine what is and what is not real, what is and what is not true nor what is and what is not correct.<br>  <br>  I have slowly but surely come to a point in my life where I believe that the concepts of right and wrong can not be accurately defined as they are both purely subjective theories. What is right to one person from one culture may be completely wrong to another person from another culture. With that said, how can any man on this planet ever truly judge another man's beliefs or actions? It can not be done in a definitively just manner, for doing so would be hypocritical in and of itself.<br>  <br>  I believe there are two equal parts that create human sentience. The Ego and The Self. The Ego is that part of us that provides raw, tangible instinct. It is that part of us that we rely on to keep our physical body protected in times of peril. It is that instinctual protector that gives our personality the more abrasive traits such as dominance, arrogance, denial, aggression, etc. The Self is that part of us that provides insights beyond the physical world. It is that part of us that allows us to understand & realize human emotion and the causes behind the emotions. It is our insightful understanding side that gives our personality the more conciliatory traits such as compassion, peace, unconditional platonic love, etc.<br>  <br>  In realizing the existence of these two parts in humans I have come to see the world in a completely different light. I now understand why people cling to their beliefs and also why some are willing to die or even kill for them. The answer is fear and fear alone. For me, I chose to cling to my beliefs because I feared what my family would think of me and because I feared what could possibly happen to "me" when "I" died. Had I have never faced those fears, never embraced my presumed differences, and never taken the chance to not believe in something then I never would have found me.<br>  <br>  The journey was not an easy one and it certainly isn't complete by any means, but I am glad that I had the courage to not just look down the less trodden path... but also the courage to take it!|`|KXQVRQdjaa	I had a great five paragraph explanation of Wicca, my religion.

But they imagined he was speaking about taking rest in sleep. 14?At that time, therefore, Jesus said to them outspokenly: “Laz′a?rus has died,<br>  21?Martha therefore said to Jesus: “Lord, if you had been here my brother would not have died. 22?And yet at present I know that as many things as you ask God for, God will give you.” 23?Jesus said to her: “Your brother will rise.” 24?Martha said to him: “I know he will rise in the resurrection on the last day.” 25?Jesus said to her: “I am the resurrection and the life. <br>  I believe in the resurrection Jesus spoke about in (John 5:28-29) Do not marvel at this, because the hour is coming in which all those in the memorial tombs will hear his voice 29?and come out, those who did good things to a resurrection of life, those who practiced vile things to a resurrection of judgment.<br>  <br>  There will be a new heaven and new earth with Jesus as King,this is the Kingdom that he taught us to pray for at (Matthew 6:10) Let your kingdom come. Let your will take place, as in heaven, also upon earth.(Isaiah 9:6) For there has been a child born to us, there has been a son given to us; and the princely rule will come to be upon his shoulder. And his name will be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Eternal Father, Prince of Peace.(Isaiah 9:7) To the abundance of the princely rule and to peace there will be no end, upon the throne of David and upon his kingdom in order to establish it firmly and to sustain it by means of justice and by means of righteousness, from now on and to time indefinite. The very zeal of Jehovah of armies will do this.(Isaiah 11:1-10) And there must go forth a twig out of the stump of Jes′se; and out of his roots a sprout will be fruitful. 2?And upon him the spirit of Jehovah must settle down, the spirit of wisdom and of understanding, the spirit of counsel and of mightiness, the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of Jehovah; 3?and there will be enjoyment by him in the fear of Jehovah. And he will not judge by any mere appearance to his eyes, nor reprove simply according to the thing heard by his ears. 4?And with righteousness he must judge the lowly ones, and with uprightness he must give reproof in behalf of the meek ones of the earth. And he must strike the earth with the rod of his mouth; and with the spirit of his lips he will put the wicked one to death. 5?And righteousness must prove to be the belt of his hips, and faithfulness the belt of his loins. 6?And the wolf will actually reside for a while with the male lamb, and with the kid the leopard itself will lie down, and the calf and the maned young lion and the well-fed animal all together; and a mere little boy will be leader over them. 7?And the cow and the bear themselves will feed; together their young ones will lie down. And even the lion will eat straw just like the bull. 8?And the sucking child will certainly play upon the hole of the cobra; and upon the light aperture of a poisonous snake will a weaned child actually put his own hand. 9?They will not do any harm or cause any ruin in all my holy mountain; because the earth will certainly be filled with the knowledge of Jehovah as the waters are covering the very sea. 10?And it must occur in that day that there will be the root of Jes′se that will be standing up as a signal for the peoples. To him even the nations will turn inquiringly, and his resting-place must become glorious.<br>  I hope to live on this new earth and see my family and friends resurrected and live forever together,if I stay faithful and loyal to Jehovah.|`|7kJFmyxdaa	Religion is man made.

If you truly believe in Him, he will forgive you and give you the chance to be one of His children. <br>  You have long way left, you need to keep believing, doing good things, to live your life getting closer and closer to God, reading from Bible and praying, changing your life in better and fighting against sin...|`|0F1775TVaa	Ok, this question crosses two different boundaries so you can't exactly say.<br>  <br>  But atheists (like me) are going to say you don't go anywhere, it's the end of your life.<br>  <br>  and Christians (other religions) will say, because we don't believe, we are damned and will go to hell.<br>  <br>  those are your answers.|`|4Wzpfji8aa	Only God really knows that.    But it does say in the bible that you can only make it to heaven through Jesus Christ.<br>  <br>  <br>  People who do wrong,   but didn't know (better) will also be punished,   as it does say in the bible that they will recieve fewer lashes.    HOWEVER ignoring something deliberatly will be treated as if you knew on the day of judgement.  In other words,   if you choose to ignore something,   you will be judged on it.<br>  <br>  So no one can really say who will go to heaven and who won't.    <br>  <br>  Can an athiest make it into heaven?   I don't know.   <br>  <br>  I used to think that if an athiest lived a good life,   he would have a good chance,     BUT Christ did say that he is the only way to the father   (Athiests don't believe so they may miss the train)<br>  <br>  It also says in the bible that not everyone says says   "Lord,  Lord!"   will be saved.    They will say to the Lord   "Lord,   didn't we cast out evil demons in your name"   and some other stuff and then the Lord will tell them to depart and that he did not know them.    That's pretty scary.     So just hearing that,   probably means that just by merely  being a  "Good"   person,   isn't nearly enough.   <br>  <br>  Also note that the word  "Good"    is also mistaken,   because no one is good.   Christ said that himself  when a man approached him saying to Christ   "Good man"   and then Christ said something like why the man called him good,   adn no one is good except our father in heaven.<br>  <br>  People need to use the word  "Respectable"   instead of good.|`|FOzN3xwzaa	The only way to get into heaven is by believing in Jesus alone for salvation. <br>  <br>  All the good deeds in the world won't pay for even one of your sins.  <br>  <br>  Only JESUS is acceptable payment for sins.  And we're all sinners. <br>  <br>  Either Jesus pays for a person's sins, or that person pays for their sins in eternal torment in hell. <br>  <br>  The only way to get into heaven and to avoid being sent to hell, is by believing that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for all our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead. Believe this and you will be in heaven and not in hell, no matter what! :)|`|UGyrxDHvaa	No, christanity believes that if you arn't a believer of that religion, weither u know of it or not, go to hell<br>  <br>  kinda unfair if u ask me.|`|ENOU23U1aa	no you have to accept the Lord Jesus christ as your lord that'sis the only way to get to heaven|`|0GdFoDfraa	sadly no, just being good is not going to change any thing. there is only one way to heaven. and yes they would go to hell but it would be no ones fault but their own|`|RhDPB70Baa	No we don't, and neither do you.

AlybkawCaa	Yes, it is not that simple. Both the current science views and the Bible Genesis Creation view is in error.<br>  <br>  Science still has many missing links in the evolution chain, this is because some new species suddenly evolve in one generation and there are no missing links to ever be found.  God creates in space-time by progressive evolution and also in Paradise by instant and eternal perfect creations.<br>  <br>  Scientists are correct that the earth is about 4.5 billion years old; and the earth did not cool down enough to allow water to form and primitive life to be implanted here until about 550 million years ago.The first humans did evolve from the apes; but God put souls in humans and His spirit to distinguish man from the apes. Only physically is man descended from the early frog and later the apes. There were two transition mammals between the lemur monkey and then the first male and female humans at nearly one million years ago.  Scientists today think that the first humans were about 5 million years ago; but they were actually just apes. There is no way for our scientists to know which bones were associated with super-material souls and spirits from God making man in His Spirit Image ! Personality and spirit and soul are the real you who survives into the next higher Heaven; the temporary human physical body remains always gravity-bound to earth. "Ashes to ashes and dust to dust".|`|759ae5ae6e1570ab62326b25526ef339aa	There is no way that the theory of evolution is true. <br>  If small changes are cumulative, all life would blend together by small changes.

For anything to happen at all you need three elements working together. The intent or direction, the vehicle or agent, and the energy to get it into motion. <br>  <br>  There are always two sides of something, the physical and the energetic. The energetic provides both intent and motion to produce the physical. All matter is an energy vibrating at a particular dense frequency. The closer the wave length the denser it gets the more solid the matter. We can pass through water because it is vibrating at a less dense frequency than we are. We can't pass through rock because the rocks frequency is more denser than ours.

6cfdab636ccaf4a70aefcc4c24a14540aa	I wonder this often. A friend of mine is in the Army going to be deployed Afghanistan in March and is a staunch Christian. He won't drink, do drugs, have premarital sex, and he goes to church every Sunday...but he has absolutely no problem with the idea of killing people. In fact, he almost looks forward to it.<br>  <br>  I think it's fascinating that people of faith are selective about which commandments they choose to believe in. It seems sort of hypocritical, doesn't it?<br>  <br>  I guess it's justified by the thought that the people they're fighting aren't Christians, and therefore aren't really worth anything. None of it really makes any sense to me.|`|NR3YnkVPaa	Wow am I surprised. If any of you christians should dare consult your bible you would find that it teaches against any and every kind of war and violence. Jesus said to pray for your enemies. When the crowd came to arrest him and his disciples pulled swords to defend him he told them to put them away. He taught that we should never repay evil with evil. If someone compels you to walk a mile, walk 2 miles. If they take away your shirt, give them your coat as well. Can any of you give me a quote from the new testament that supports wars, fighting, or any kind of violence?  You guys sound more like followers of Achilles than of Jesus. The person who acts most like a Christian in this discussion is the atheist. What a sad commentary on modern christianity. A person who eats meat cannot call himself a vegetarian and be truthful.

Logical thinking can only get you so far; this is what irritates the hell out of rationalists because they want the world  to operate with the cold precision of a machine,all the better to be measured & labeled, calculated & safely debunked, no surprises to upset their lives.

But here's something funny: his supporters think he can do no wrong. <br>  <br>  For example: Obama has now sent troops into Afghanistan to fight insurgents there who are trying to assassinate the elected officials and take control of the country. Are Americans calling Obama a war monger and an occupier? Nope. Even though they call Bush those names, and even though our troops are in Iraq right now for the very same reasons - insurgents are there fighting us trying to assassinate the elected officials and take control of the country. Why the double standard? Because Obama is the anti-christ, and he has a spell on his supporters. LOL I'm kidding. It could just be that liberals, who are his supporters, only protest wars when it's a republican commander in chief. Now that we have a democrat commander in chief, Obama can have his little war, free of charge. Liberals are hypocrites.<br>  <br>  By the way, liberals call the Iraq war illegal, and they call Bush a war criminal. So, now that Obama is president, and has yet to bring the troops home from Iraq, does that make Obama also a war criminal? I didn't think so. Again, just showing you what a bunch of hypocrites liberals are.|`|2eecc312d64a4153c89aa81a8eead855aa	Hey,<br>  <br>  There's a website that follows prophecy that I haven't read lately so I can't directly answer your question, but you may want to check it out. It's www.cuttingedge.org <br>  But, I warn you that it's not your conventional website. But, it looks at current events and compares that to scripture. <br>  <br>  A more conventional site that I recommend is by Hal Lindsey, the author of "The Late Great Planet Earth" and "There's a New World Coming". It's www.hallindsey.com<br>  <br>  As with any look at prophecy, we should remember that Scripture is accurate, but our interpretation of it may not be. <br>  <br>  Enjoy the study.|`|CEGnkcHzaa	He's BLACK.|`|MA5NqIuNaa	ummm none.<br>   He is not trying to have a one world religion.|`|Fo9ADQLBaa	I am staying focused on God, not the world and all it's drama!  :D|`|CmHLKKODaa	The World does seem to be drawn to him !<br>  <br>  I doubt he would be him but, I don't know !|`|860c6e6cbb0a45ed8571556722c3f97aaa	None, no end time prophecies concerning an Antichrist.<br>  <br>  1Jn 2:18  Little children, it is the last time: and as ye have heard that antichrist shall come, even now are there many antichrists; whereby we know that it is the last time. <br>  1Jn 2:22  Who is a liar but he that denieth that Jesus is the Christ?

Just as a person may have varied relationships with varied people, a relationship with that which one believes and accepts to be "God" may be considered the correct way for them, a different person may find another path that is the path that fulfills their personal relationship. The varied relationships in turn are subject ti individual perceptions and interpretations.|`|xLKPKgZXaa	Angels are God's created beings which did not rebel and get thrown out of heaven with Satan.

You do not worship Jesus by adoring a statue. Even if we had a photo of him and you worshipped that photo of him you are still in sin. <br>  <br>  You must first know the truth and the truth will set you free. You must get down and read the bible and pray to the HS to guide you. If someone teaches something not found in the bible but teach it because a "HOLY" man like a Pope then you are in sin. You must obey Christ and what Christ taught. You must obey how the authors of the NT wrote. They all back one another up. The bible is the word of God not just the red letters.<br>  <br>  As far as with Christ we have some general ideas about how he looks. We can be certain he is not blonde haired and blue eyes since he was a jew born by jewish parents with jewish blood. So we can be certian he looks similar like jews as a whole who are full blooded jews.<br>  <br>  The other thing is that in revelations it gives a description of Jesus with white hair like a lamb, skin of bronze and with eyes like lighting I believe. So anothe thing I am sure of from the bible and logial analyzing of people appearances in particular races such as the jews.<br>  <br>  So if he was a jew, had jewish parents, with full jew blood we can know he must look similar to the way full blooded jews looked. Since we know in revelation he had curly hair I am sure while on this earth before he beame all supernatural looking he most likely had brownish curly hair. He was most likely pretty built since he was a carpenter and all carpenters during that time in Jerusalem were more like masons because they used lots of bricks and muds and soo on. He would have had dark skin naturally like Jewish dark skin and it would most likely have been a few shades darker since he was a outdoor laborer. All most every jew has brown eyes.<br>  <br>  But the main point is it does not matter hiow he looked but what matters is if you follow what he taught.|`|AA10720479	You shouldn't worship any idols.  10 commandments|`|9YMLsk7Taa	Do you worship the statue or the person of Jesus? If you get right down to it we probably shouldn't have statues, paintings or anything of that nature to try and depict Him. He could have come back at any time in history maybe the fact that He came during that period was so we should realize we are not to put such emphasis on the outward appearance! These are just my thoughts and i mean no offense; blessings to you....
530e3f8d6a946003d76d09039006b8e2aa	This is actually a great question.  Thanks for asking it.<br>  <br>  Many Christians dislike a lot of (but NOT all of) pop music because they feel it promotes, romanticizes, and glorifies evil things such as violence, unabashed wealth, excesses, sexual objectification, etc etc etc.<br>  <br>  Many religious leaders had a big problem with rock music when it came  along in the 1950s.  I would think that by their standards, popular music is 10,000 times worse than it ever was.  Music videos today are all about putting style before substance, and appearance before the actual musical creativity.  And they use sex to sell everything in pop music.  Why can't an artist make music and videos without anything sexual about them?<br>  <br>  But basically, in answer to your question, I think that many pop music artists, especially in rock and rap (but in other genres too) promote these values that Christians find objectionable if not downright evil.|`|PwD3slrTaa	That argument started with 20th century racism.  Backward slope-headed sub-Christians in Louisiana said they didn't want their young people to be affected by "the [*****] beat" they seemed to like.<br>  <br>  There is a reality of seductive and dangerous ideas at work in music, but it's not because music is sinful (quite the contrary), it's because the specific music in question is full of sin.  And that's almost everything on the radio; and really it has been for some decades.|`|oBmLIDHtaa	The vast majority of 'pop' music is very wrong.<br>  <br>  Since it is manufactured almost completely with the intent of marketing it to specific target groups, selling large number of albums, packing stadiums with 'fans' at $80-$120 per seat, and selling merchandise - it tends to lack production values, musical integrity, or anything resembling talent.<br>  <br>  People have different tastes, but for any style of music you can almost always find real artists doing it much better than the carbon copies that record executives use to try to cash in on trends.|`|AA11502346	I don't have anything wrong with it either but a certain minority of people believe that anything related to pop or rock music is satanic, even Christian rock!|`|4dXcZhuTaa	i think it has to do with vulgarity, and how it promotes sex and drugs, but i believe tha almost every kind of music does that|`|W4Dek41Jaa	I don't think that any music is wrong.

When we allow the music to control us it cannot be right. It won't necessarily be the same kind of music for all people.<br>  <br>  I think sometimes it is the pop singers themselves that create havoc in a young person's mind. They are often indisciplined, foul mouthed and take drugs. Today's young wish to emulate their 'idols' and if they think that insulting and being Fourthmouthed to parents is 'cool' then they'll do it. They begin to show no respect to anyone and not even to themselves.<br>  <br>  Some modern songs are about violence and drug taking and this is a worry to the parents of young people and these are, possibly, some  of the reasons why many feel that the music is wrong.|`|CAYTDHjWaa	Its a guilty pleasure...<br>  <br>  Pop music is made to be sold and 'popular' without being edgy or actually talented!!!<br>  <br>  It's like in Art where everyone now is loving street art - Bansky to be precise, he was edgy when he was unknown but know he has become 'Pop'!<br>  <br>  Dosn't make Pop bad but means it is everywhere, in your face and after a while it becomes sickening!|`|425ca8dc150991adaf3ef229478796cdaa	I take my music, and societal well being, seriously enough to think that this actually is a moral issue.<br>  <br>  You know how listening to certain types of music (classical and jazz in the studies) increases one's ability to do math and other types of analytical thinking?

When the lyrics promote the use of drugs and a loose sex lifestyle then, the song is wrong for Christians to listen to.<br>  <br>  Many think that, if it isn't glorifying God, it's just plain wrong.  There nothing wrong with that belief.  Such a belief gives the listener the power to choose what he/she will allow to enter their ears.  And, it lessens temptation to adopt the lifestyle spoken of in the songs.  <br>  <br>  There are some "blues" type songs that will affect one's heart beat.  It was rumored that most of the Doors ('60's music) were the worst offenders of this phenomenon.|`|RhDPB70Baa	No one thinks rock music is evil and hasn't since the 50s/60s.

It's all Almighty Jehovah's Elohim's; Shaloms; Jireh's Holy Word not a man written book with man's doctrine. You see when you study the pure word of God and allow the Holy Spirit ( Which is the third member of Godhead Genesis 1:26-27; John 14:26; Philliapians 3:3; Matthew 28:18-20) Then the real truth of Almighty God will reveal itself. <br>     For all those who want to take vengence out yourselves Romans 12:19-21; Deut. 32:34-47;Hebrews 10:30-31.

They weren't hampered by truth.<br>  <br>  The Christian church stuck with what God authored.<br>  <br>  It's enough.|`|zPfgFXU5aa	The Gnostic Gospels were written too long after the events to be authentic eye-witness accounts and they contain so many heresies and historic errors that they were condemned as forgeries as soon as they were circulated.<br>  <br>  The lack of manuscript evidence in support of them plus the failure of the early church fathers to quote from them or recognize them,  shows that they were never used or accepted as genuine in the early Church. <br>   <br>  These  Gnostic "gospels" therefore fail the test of continuous usage and acceptance and the church was right to reject them.

We are not a reincarnated human, we are exactly the same with renewable cells, which is what we were at birth.

AA11849917	Look at Paul's example when he preached to the people on Mars Hill.  He first analyzed their situation, understood their culture, and started with things they already believed, and went from there.<br>  <br>  A good example of this is in C.S. Lewis' book, "Mere Christianity."  I recommend it as a "must read" for anyone who wants to learn how to answer skeptics.<br>  <br>  Along with "Mere Christianity" is also "Who Moved the Stone?", "Evidence That Demands A Verdict", "More Evidence That Demands A Verdict", "More Than A Carpenter", and other similar books.<br>  <br>  The problem with people, as I have pointed out in many answers I have presented, is based on something Jesus said.  He said that people reject Him "because their deeds are evil, and they love darkness and hate the light."<br>  <br>  He also said that if you REALLY want to know if His teachings were from man, or from God (implying the existence of said God), "then OBEY  THESE  COMMANDS, and you SHALL know."  (I believe He was referring to the Sermon on The Mount, starting in the 5th chapter of the gospel according to Matthew.)<br>  <br>  People challenge God's existence, but when you present them with this test, they back down.  They make every excuse in the book why they shouldn't bother.  That's really hypocritical to ask for proof, then mock or ignore the answer when it's presented.<br>  <br>  Jeremiah records these words from God, "If you seek for me, then you shall find me, if you search for me with all your heart (with an honest and humble heart), and I SHALL be found of you, says the Lord."<br>  <br>  He said that He would reveal Himself to the person who has a humble heart, but also He said that He would hide Himself from the proud, the arrogant, the skeptic, the scoffer, and the mocker alike.<br>  <br>  So, when somebody says there is no God, and there is no evidence for God's existence, when God plainly and clearly told us HOW to find Him, then all I can say is that the ONLY reason they don't believe in God is because they don't WANT to believe in God!<br>  <br>  I've also shared this illustration in other answers:<br>  <br>  If a flea says of the camel whose back it lives on, that camels don't exist, that flea is a fool.<br>  <br>  If a grain of sand in the Sahara Desert says that the desert doesn't exist, that grain of sand is yet an even bigger fool.<br>  <br>  If an electron says that the cosmos doesn't exist, that electron is yet an even bigger fool.<br>  <br>  And when a finite, miniscule, temporal being who hasn't even existed a thousand, much less a billion, years, who hasn't even explored his own solar system, much less the galaxy, when that person says there is not God, who is infinite and eternal, that person is an infinite fool! <br>  <br>  There is the story of a man who for some obscure reason, hated rainbows.  The only problem is that he lived in a village near a waterfall.  Whenever there was a double rainbow, all the kids would run outside and tell everyone to come out and look at the double rainbow.<br>  <br>  This man hated rainbows so much, that one day he poked out his eyes, so that when the children came running to his house to tell him about a double rainbow, he told the children that rainbows don't exist.  When they asked him how in the world he could say such a thing, he told them, "Because I can't see any rainbows, and therefore they do not exist!  Now leave me alone with your fairy tales!"<br>  <br>  Sadly, "There is none so blind as he who will not see," especially when he pokes his own eyes out just so that he can say that he can't see any rainbows!  How sadly pathetic!|`|DRSv6SOLaa	Probably has somethin' to do with 'accountability', and doesn't care too much for 'authority', and focus on people's failures' instead of Jesus HimSelf.|`|r8rykCkGaa	They are rebellious.

They reject Divinity in its entirety, God the Father, God the Son, and God, the Holy Ghost.  They reject the Trinity!   And they reject the graces which God gives them daily to know Himself.  Maybe tomorrow they will accept the grace.  Tomorrow God will give them the grace again.  And the next day, and the next.  Perhaps they will reject it every day until the last day, but God will still give that same grace, the one to know Him, to love Him, to adore Him above all else.<br>  <br>  This is what you must tell them, for Our Lord Jesus Christ instructed them how to pray to the Father:<br>  <br>   "Our Father, Who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy Name.  Thy kingdom come, Thy Will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.  Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us, but deliver us from evil.  Amen." <br>  <br>   [this is the ONLY translation from the Greek Apostolic Fathers of the First Century].   <br>  <br>  Instruct them in this, and then WAIT.  <br>  <br>  Christ knows about rejection, and asks us to suffer  rejection, too.  Christ never instructed us how to pray to Himself.  He only said, "Do this in memory of Me," offering His memorable sacrifice to the Father in the species of bread and wine.   You and I cannot do anything about those who reject Him, except pray for them.  God will give them the grace, and maybe they will not throw it away in the last second of the last day of their lives.|`|GHdscZ2Haa	I find his message as repelling as you find the message of Vishnu.<br>  <br>  Why do you hate Vishnu so much?

jnnIwdtyaa	Self Dedication Rite<br>  By Scott Cunningham<br>  <br>  If you wish to walk the Wiccan path, you may desire to dedicate yourself to the Goddess and God. This self-dedication is simply a formal ritual marking your conscious decision to embark on a new way of life - for that is the essence of Wicca.<br>  <br>  You may wish to use or adapt the ritual below, but the best dedicatory rituals are self-created.<br>  Before even considering dedicating yourself to the deities, be certain of your intentions for so doing and that you have studied Wicca to the point where you know it is indeed the right way for you.<br>  <br>  This means continued study. Read every book you can find on Wicca - the good ones as well as the bad. Subscribe to Wiccan and Pagan publications. Familiarize yourself with Wicca as far as you can. <br>  In addition to reading, study nature. Celebrate the seasons and the phases of the Moon with ritual.<br>  You may also wish to fill your soul with music. If so, order by mail some of the Wiccan music tapes now available. If this is impossible, spend time each day listening to the music of nature - go to a place where wind blows through leaves or around tree trunks. Listen to water bubbling over stones or pounding a rocky coastline. Pinpoint your hearing to the meow of a lonely cat heralding the dawn. Create your own music too, if you are so talented.<br>  <br>  This done, stay up late a few nights or rise with the dawn. Alone, write down what you hope to gain from Wicca. This may include spiritual fulfillment, deeper relationships with the Goddess and God, insight into your place in the world, the power to bring order into your existence, the ability to attune with the seasons and the Earth, and so on.<br>  <br>  Once this list has been fashioned, spend the next evening or morning creating a new one. On this, record what you feel you can give to Wicca. There is much you can give. Not only your time, energy, devotion and so on, but also more concrete things. Here are some suggestions:<br>  Join a national Wiccan or Pagan group.<br>  Donate to an ecological organization.<br>  You may wish to start recycling.<br>  Following these suggestions, discover other ways to show your devotion to Wicca. A hint: anything you do for the Earth, or for our fellow creatures on it, you do for Wicca.<br>  <br>  Prepare yourself by drawing a bath of warm water. Add a tablespoon of salt and a few drops of a scented oil such as sandalwood.<br>  If you have to bath, use a shower. Fill a washcloth with salt, add a few drops of essential oil, and rub your body. If you're performing this ritual at the sea or a river, bathe there if you so desire.<br>  As you bathe, prepare for the coming rite. Open your consciousness to higher levels of awareness. Deep breathe. Cleanse your mind as well as your body.<br>  After bathing, dry and dress for the journey. Go to a place in the wild where you feel safe. It should be a comfortable spot where you won't be disturbed by others, an area where the powers of the Earth and the elements are evident. It may be a mountain top, a desert, canyon or cave, perhaps a dense forest, a rocky outcropping over the sea, a quiet island in the center of a lake. Even a lonely part of a park or garden can be used. Draw on your imagination to find the place.<br>  You need take nothing with you but a vial of richly scented oil. Sandalwood, frankincense, cinnamon or any other scent is fine. When you arrive at the place of dedication, remove your shoes and sit quietly for a few moments. Calm your heart if you've exerted yourself during your travel. Breathe deeply to return to normal, and keep your mind free of cluttered thoughts. Open yourself to the natural energies around you.<br>  When you're calm, rise and pivot slowly on one foot, surveying the land around you. You're seeking the ideal spot. Don't try to find it; open your awareness to the place. When you've discovered it, sit, kneel or lie flat on your back. Place the oil on the Earth beside you, don't stand - contact the Earth.<br>  Continue deep breathing. Feel the energies around you. Call the Goddess and God in any words you like, or use the following invocation. Memorize these words before the rite so that they'll spill effortlessly from you, or improvise:<br>  <br>  O Mother Goddess,<br>  O Father God,<br>  Answers to all mysteries and yet mysteries unanswered;<br>  In this place of power I open myself<br>  to Your Essence.<br>  In this place and in this time I am changed;<br>  From henceforth I walk the Wiccan path.<br>  I dedicate myself to you, Mother Goddess and Father God<br>  <br>  Rest for moment, silent, still. Then continue:<br>  <br>  I breathe your energies into my body, commingling, blending,<br>  mixing them with mine,<br>  that I may see the divine in nature,<br>  nature in the divine,<br>  and divinity within myself and all else.<br>  O Great Goddess,<br>  O Great God,<br>  Make me one with your essence<br>  Make me one with your essence<br>  Make me one with your essence.<br>  <br>  You may feel bursting with power and energy, or calm and at peace.

Since most people doing a self dedication are relatively new to paganism, it is recommended to do so when it is easiest to raise power. <br>  <br>  Here is some basic info: <a href="http://bluemoonwicca.org/choices.html" rel="nofollow">http://bluemoonwicca.org/choices.html</a><br>  <br>  click on self dedication and initiation.

Hence, don't touch my organs.|`|cFaCmYrXaa	The only reason I've ever heard for people to be reluctant is that because there is such a shortage of organs and a huge list of people on the waiting list, some people are paranoid that if they're ever in an accident and the EMS people see that you are an organ donor, they won't try very hard to save you.  But, whatever, I try not to get drawn in by doomsayers so I'm listed as an organ donor on my license.|`|Z5KvRSRCaa	hmm...<br>  <br>  My organs aren't good.<br>  <br>  <br>  Actually I just thought of an interesting one:<br>  <br>  This is more for being a registered organ donor, but the fear is that a doctor may not try to as hard to save you if you've got all of those nice organs waiting to be plucked and given to the other sick people in the hospital.<br>  Addendum to that: they start taking the organs incredibly quickly after brain death occurs.

She begged Him to release her child from the demon's control...<br>  <br>  Since she was a Gentile, born in Syrian Phoenicia, Jesus told her, 'First I should help my own family, the Jews.*  It is isn't right to take food from the children and throw it to the dogs.'<br>  <br>  She replied, 'That's true, Lord, but even the dogs under the table are given some crumbs from the children's plates.'<br>  <br>  'Good answer!' he said, 'And because you have answered so well, I have healed your daughter..'  And when she arrived home, her little girl was lying quietly in bed, and the demon was gone."<br>  <br>  Mark 7:25-30<br>  (certainly that is compassion.)<br>  <br>  * Greek- Let the children eat first.|`|KlXUrxBfaa	Compassion can be either good or bad ?  It is throughout both the old and new, passion is emotion, even in division of war, both sides love their own.<br>    The Mind Heart and Good Spirit coupled together in a compassion of passionate love|`|T5ztIAZbaa	Jesus is the main example.  Many times he healed the sick, and the text actually says "And He had compassion on them."|`|LnoyylQ7aa	jesus and judas|`|H7LZg5z0aa	Jesus showed compassion many times when He dealt with people.  Some verses are Matthew 14:14 and Mark 6:34 where Jesus had compassion on the crowd that followed Him (the 5,000) and again in Matthew 15:32 and Mark 8:2 for the 4,000.  And, in Mark 1:41, Jesus is moved with compassion to heal a leper.  Also, the father of the prodigal son had compassion on his son when he saw him coming home. (Luke 15:20)

wZEGi1EHaa	god wills your hamster to be cannibalistic.|`|APjnSYKuaa	The hamster thing is an adaptation for occasional environmental deficiencies. If it tried to raise all those young in the conditions you are keeping it in, it likely would die along with them. If it eats them, it gets nutrients it needs, doesn't have to put futile effort into trying to feed them, and may just live long enough for the conditions to get better so she can actually raise some to adulthood.<br>  <br>  Big question is why a half decent god would create hamsters in a way that they had to eat their babies to survive.|`|WbaN6osZaa	Try the science section (biology?)<br>  <br>  Amusing that you think religion = biologist<br>  <br>  Unless you can find a biologist who believes that some lifeforms kill their young because of 'sin', where we move out of biology and into superstition.<br>  <br>  PS there's always the chance that your hamster has a mental defect...<br>  <br>   ...or because it is captive it doesn't forage or provide own food own food, it instinctively kills it's young who are viewed as competition for a limited food supply.<br>  <br>  Just a guess.<br>  <br>  Again, you need to ask in biology or pets section.|`|LuN1unJ3aa	1 - many species of animals eat their young, including fish.<br>  2 - male penguins shelter the egg between their feet and folds on their flesh. Male seahorses do the same with a pouch into which the female places the eggs (and it is not that uncommon for a number of tropical fish varieties to incubate the eggs in the mouth).|`|kFpFU97zaa	You want Biology.<br>  <br>  1) Have you seen how many babies they make? If they didn't cannibalize, they'd overpopulate. It's a system of checks and balances.<br>  <br>  2) The males don't give birth, the females do. The female passes the young to the male, and the male incubates them.|`|ZzWO4olgaa	1. don't know. but that is why hamsters are low down on the food chain.<br>  <br>  2. i'm pretty sure the male doesn't  give birth. he just stores the fertilised eggs in his pouch. kangaroo-style.|`|SvEzmp4Laa	Why would cannibalism be strange to a Christian?  You people eat the "body" and drink the "blood" of Jesus all the time?|`|IjKndeVvaa	1. It is what generally happens, but the fact that you have a hamster is proof that this trait has not wiped out their species. It has just prevented over-population. <br>  <br>  2. I don't know how or why this happened. What rule states that females are more capable of giving birth? I don't know why one gender was chosen over another in any species. "Male" is just a man-made title given to distinguish one type from another. We could call it a female and it wouldn't make a difference. Not all animals have XY chromosomes that determine that individual is a male. In some species, XY is female and XX is male. I don't know enough about seahorses to know the evolutionary advancement that goes along with that trait. Maybe, you should do some research into it. I'm sure you'd find your answer.<br>  <br>  You were already at the Wikipedia article. You should've continued reading...<br>  <br>  "The question of why it is the males who undergo pregnancy rather than the females is actually not entirely known, though some researchers believe male pregnancy allows for shorter birthing intervals, hence more offspring. When looking at which sex has the ability to produce more young if they had an unlimited number of ready and willing partners, males have the potential to produce 17 percent more in a breeding season. Also, females have “time-outs” from the reproductive cycle that are 1.2 times longer than those of males."|`|0m81aJ5Kaa	I'm guessing the hamster was in a cage? <br>  <br>  She evaluated her situation, decided there wasn't room for population expansion, and reabsorbed the nutrients that went into reproduction.<br>  <br>  Perfectly logical from an evolutionary viewpoint. Hamsters in the wild rarely eat their young unless there is a food shortage.|`|lMmhkeZ0aa	If you add the platypus, it becomes good evidence that god gets high.|`|VhtyM9Bpaa	So you find diverse lifeforms and bizarre mutations to be evidence AGAINST evolution?<br>  <br>  To answer your question, have you ever seen that family that made a killing as the "lobster" family?  All of their offspring had clawlike hands, and even though they were freaks, their family kept breeding.  They were big in the freak show scene for years.<br>  <br>  Check out Idiocracy for another example of how poorly adapted species can thrive.|`|WX1b747Iaa	Animal behavior in captivity is often aberrant, but they do it in the wild as well. She might do it because she considers her living environment unfit to raise a family in. She might be insane. You might have touched one of the babies and she didn't like your scent on them. She might be hungering for an occasional juicy protein source, most rodents will eat bugs or worms occasionally.|`|f7fcb6877caa0ad4f41dd9af2258ee0aaa	Hamsters don't behave that way in the wild.  It is a response to the stress and unnatural living conditions of captivity.  Female seahorses produce the eggs and male seahorses the sperm just as in other vertebrates.  The male just has a pouch where the fertilized eggs are stored until they hatch.|`|7ylYxklsaa	Better yet, you explain why God would make either of those things happen.<br>  <br>  ** If you touched the babies, chances are you're the reason the mother ate them.

Why?|`|AA11058044	It's not a belief, any more than I "believe" in gravity.<br>  <br>  I am convinced that evolution occurs.  It has been observed in laboratory settings.  Allele proportions have been shown to change in populations over time.  That is evolution.<br>  <br>  I am also convinced that the theory of evolution through natural selection is the best explanation we have for WHY allele proportions in a population change over time.  <br>  <br>  It explains everything from why there are platypus and echidna in Australia, but not Africa, to why humans can choke to death on their food, to why the earliest marsupial fossils are found in Alberta and not Australia, to why we don't find mouse fossils in any sediment older than 70 million years.<br>  <br>  No other theory has that ability or that depth of explanation, nor the incredible amount of evidence supporting it.|`|0312ec6bd9788b0c6bf89b026c84d0c6aa	Whose definition of evolution should I believe? it seems that there are many these days and the only thing that I can see is that the explanations given are the only thing that are evolving!|`|yoKHoKXjaa	No, I accept Evolution as the best explanation we have.|`|3GAiVmEAaa	I don't need to "believe" it- that implies faith.

I do believe in what Darwin called "evolution" but it must be interpreted past what the morons of todays scientific world see it as.... It is Adaptation, only , just adaptation simple as that!

Evolution is happening every day, all around us, inside people, inside our minds... is it so hard a concept to see that to survive as a species we change over long periods of time?|`|JYDzjudGaa	Yes as this is how different organisms have changed and adapted to environments.

The good go to heaven not only born agains.|`|uxfacsgmaa	That's okay! I'm ashamed of what a lot of atheists here say. Just take comfort in knowing that you are an individual, and nobody speaks for you but you. Lead by example! :)|`|4GiIXWUXaa	Wow. Well i tend to agree with you on this, wholeheartedly.<br>  <br>  As i have said before, to believe in God is not a crime, but to not believe in God is not a crime either.<br>  <br>  Personally i am uncertain as to which embarrasses me more:<br>  Christians who go on obnoxious diatribes ridiculing atheists and other faiths OR those who pontificate and are obviously ignorant of the world around them, let alone the "dogmas" of their own religion.<br>  <br>  As for the issue of "good people going to heaven" well on that my friend i must respectfully, doctrinally disagree. Christians generally do not believe in Purgatory, the Redemption of the Soul by works alone OR in prayers for the Dead. Salvation is a matter of Grace through the shed blood of Christ on Calvary, and regardless of a person's good works, he can still go to hell for rejection of Christ. Catholics hold to those views on the doctrine of works and Purgatory etc, Protestants do not. <br>  But that is not the main issue here, either in your question or in my answer to you.<br>  <br>  Bottom line, I agree with you. Those who cannot walk in love and would rather misuse and mishandle the Word of God to condemn others with their hate speech and malevolent ideologies have never known Christ and remain an embarrassment to the Faith, and are a living testimonial to the ignorance of prejudice as they make a Disgrace of the Shed blood of Christ in their actions and words.<br>  <br>  It has little to do with the religion and a lot to do with the individuals personality and perception of his religion. <br>  <br>  But, Oh to rid the world of such malevolence would make it such a better place; Yet i find it comes in all forms, of all faiths, not just in professing Christians ... but um, Yes Fundamentalists seem to be much worse than any bunch i have ever met, and they often make us all look badly.<br>  <br>  And a Star for you, my friend.<br>  xoxo ?|`|AA10819407	Ah!!

So in answer to your question, NO, it's not the faith that dictates, it's the lack of acceptance, resistance to knowledge, declination to understanding, and sometimes it's simply a lower IQ.<br>  <br>  It has little to do with faith.|`|B0GujA9Aaa	Wow, you are awesome. <br>  Thanks for being tolerant of other people's beliefs.

See how some of them neglected your opinion all together and just focused on the fact that you "dared" tell the naughty atheists that they'll go to heaven (LOL)?<br>  I am a Christian but I believe we need to respect what other people believe. <br>  I agree with what the first answerer (Jon) said. There are some really great questions that appear here, and some really good discussions. The only problem is, you have to swim through a lot of the "mud" to get to the good ones.<br>  Nothing stirs the basic human emotions like religion or politics (take a look at some of the answers/questions about Obama!) and it would seem a lot of sad people have a lot of time on their hands and like the attention.<br>  I really don't care what folks believe. As long as they are open to discussing it with me a nice MATURE way, I'm all for it.<br>  If there are Christians that get offended by what atheists say or how they say it, they should take a leaf from their Leaders book and either reply in a mature way..or better yet, ignore the question!<br>  As for those Christians that are downright rude to atheists and those that have different faiths...shame on you.

I don't lump all atheists together as cold-hearted a--holes.<br>  <br>  As a former agnostic, I can understand where you're coming from.  I understand atheists don't believe in God.  But I do not criticize atheists.  I don't make fun of them, or consider them less intelligent.  I view each person as an individual.  And I know God has His own plan for each person, so some people will be atheists until they accept Him, while others will reject Him their entire lives.  That is their choice.  I respect their choice.|`|DOQ4bZQuaa	The concept of a god among gods is entirely different from the concept of one all-powerful, perfect God. Your analogy that because we reject the notion that many imperfect gods exist in favor or the existence of The One God; we should accept disbelief (from others) in the One God, is wrong. Belief in many gods (who are by nature imperfect) is really about favoritism. One can believe in whichever gods they wish and reject whichever gods they wish because imperfect deities are by nature subjective.<br>  <br>  Belief in the One All-Powerful God is not about subjectivity (He cannot just exist for those who believe and not exist for non-believers). God (in the monotheistic sense) is objective. He is not just a god for some and not others, He is God for all. This is why we do not accept lack of faith in God because He is God for even non-believers. <br>  <br>  With that said, criticizing or damning atheists is foolish. God is God for all people, so all people must be loved. Most reasonable Christians, Muslims, Jews etc. wish to live among all peoples, whether they accept The One God or not. I just hope that one day all can accept Christ as God.|`|7kJFmyxdaa	Why are the Atheists always putting down Christians for believing in God? I believe your question works both ways my friend. I don't put down atheists. If they don't believe in God well so be it that is their choice. So, I would suggest you stop judging all Christians as Atheists haters because this is simply not the case.

UPgLy0Ahaa	*Tattoomom*, it doesn't have anything to do with the fact they were Jehovah's Witnesses. Many of our members have tattoo's because at one time they weren't Jehovah's Witnesses. The Bible says at Lev.19:28 not to tattoo the body.<br>  <br>  It's probally because of them being conservative. My family has witnesses and non-witnesses. Some of the non-witnesses are very conservative and would be judgemental and intolerant if they met you. I have to be honest some of the witnesses that have never been exposed to tattoo's, etc...would be a little scared of you until they got to know you. The other witnesses wouldn't blink an eye if you had any. (Inc. myself)<br>  <br>  My daughter almost died from having one put on her shoulder. If it wasn't for me, she would've died. She was unconscience with a high fever. It had poisoned her. I found her in this shape. So I am strongly against tattoos, but I would never judge someone on having a tatoo. It's the heart that matters. This is what Jehovah sees. He is drawing people to him regardless if they have a tattoo or not.<br>  <br>  1 Chron.28:9"...all hearts Jehovah is searching, and every inclination of the thoughts he is discerning. If you search for him, he will let himself be found by you; but if you leave him, he will cast you off forever".|`|AA11025703	I can't say for sure, as I doubt I've met you:D<br>  <br>  I am a Christian, one of Jehovah's Witnesses.

Sex is designed to be between two people that are in it for the long haul. It is not simply a matter of procreation. It binds you spiritually to the person, not just emotionally and physically.<br>  <br>  In any case, I am not going to judge you. I have had premarital sex (not in three years) lol but i have had it, more than once nonetheless.<br>  <br>  I can understand your fears, especially IF the sex was unprotected AND he was promiscuous and he may or may not have had STDS. I think that this is something that all women (and men) become worried over, at least once. I have never heard of strep throat in connection to HIV but okay then LOL, if you say so. You never had it in the first place *sighs* <br>  <br>  Anyways, because physical attraction involves hormones OF COURSE you are going to want to get down to business ... especially IF you really like the guy and are making out bigtime. I think it is easier for those who have never had sex to refrain from initmate contact than it is for those of us who have already done it. <br>  <br>  Your "promise" depends heavily upon your own convictions. Obviously you know that it counts as "sin" and obviously you are considering the obligatory obedience to a vow that you made to God in a moment of fear and panic. The point is not will you be forgiven IF you break this vow? But do you actually care about "God's opinion, Law, or requirements? You have to decide who you love more: God, or yourself.  Do you want to please God, or do you want to please your own nature? (Sex feels good, even if it is lousy it still feels good LOL).<br>  If you sleep with a guy you know what follows. You know what CAN happen and what DOES happen. <br>  <br>  I do not see that this should be an issue with you, considering that you have stated that you have already broken this vow in a moment of weakness once. Therefore it must not have that much merit to you, if you have already done so. Though in each circumstance, even where there has been past mistakes, there remains the opportunity to do right. You need to choose what it is that you want to do. You cannot blame God or the devil (for temptation) OR the other person, YOU are responsible for your own actions therefore you are accountable for them.<br>  <br>  I am not married. I am a Christian. I also, am not a Virgin. Therefore, there will be no judgment from me. All i can do, is advise you in what is right, and tell you that it is better not to swear by heaven or Gods throne and make a vow that you do not intend on keeping, then to swear an oath before heaven and break it. <br>  <br>  Good Luck.<br>  xoxo ?<br>  <br>  TU and TA to SB.

This time really think it through and find something that would be more meaningful to you. Like to be more charitable, etc. Go through your flaws ie are you selfish or kinda lazy, not as helpful to others as you should be or something? Promise to work on those things and become a better person and do something useful for humanity. <br>  I don't think promising to stay abstinent means a whole lot to God when you don't believe in abstinence and the original prayers were so self serving and desperate? <br>  <br>  Personally I don't even believe God answers these types of prayers at all but even if he did he wouldn't have been that into this one.

Do you think anyone ever sticks to that promise? I'm pretty sure God is used to it.  And you already said you didn't stick to that promise - so, I'm not sure what it is you're looking for help with?<br>  <br>  Though it was rather silly of you to automatically assume HIV with strep throat.  So, instead of consulting a physician and getting a real answer first, you made a promise to God, which you broke and want to continue to break, yet you love God with all your heart.  I think you are a little confused, and not willing to accept the responsibility for and consequences of your own actions.  You should have a chat with God about these issues.<br>  <br>  <br>  Live4Christ - Jesus did NOT perform a miracle and cure her of HIV - she never HAD HIV to begin with - she had a common case of strep throat.  It's gone around my local high school in the past week and over 100 students were out sick with it over a couple of days - do you think each one of them has HIV????  Please - let's be realistic here.|`|v7Wflu78aa	This is a very common way that humans behave: something traumatic happens, and rather than seeing it realistically or putting into context, they make up a story and a method of preventing the trauma from happening again.<br>  <br>  For example, a child is abandoned by it's mother, and learns to avoid making emotional connections with other because of the pain it caused.  While our ability to learn, to understand cause and effect, is strong, its accuracy is often wrong.<br>  <br>  The cause of the baby's emotional pain was the mother leaving, not the attachment the child felt.<br>  <br>  The reason for your traumatic experience was because of your fears and judgments about the sex and subsequent illness.  Your decision to avoid sex may or may not be reasonable.  Millions of people have sex before marriage and enjoy it, and don't get sick.  Thousands get AIDS from sex WITH their HUSBAND!<br>  <br>  So, you have not stepped back and looked at the reality in which you had your trauma.<br>  <br>  It may still be that your choice of men is off - you might be attracted to men who are violent or unstable, in fact, I would guess that it is very likely in your case.  So, being celibate is a good solution.<br>  <br>  But, there are also men who are trustworthy, dependable and kind,  If one of those men is in your life, and if your feel sexual attraction, you might really enjoy the sex, and end up happier and healthier.|`|tHwXESv1aa	I'm sure God is understanding and you are just a human being with sexual needs.

I think it is very serious to make a promise to God and then break it. I quit smoking in 1980, and at that time I made a promise to God that a cigarette would never touch my lips again. And I have never touched a cigarette again. And I used to smoke up to three packs a day. I also believe that God did do a miracle about my habit, cause I remember going in my bedroom and getting on my hands and knees and praying to God to help me quite smoking and when I got up, I threw my pack of cigarettes away and made the promise to God and have never smoked again. Praise the Lord.

RuOTJLyvaa	We come from a long list of ancient apes that have evolved over many millions of years. <br>  Theres a theory that says somewhere along the line, these ancestors started to eat the marrow out of bones instead of just fruits and vegetables. Over time the extra protein began to form larger brains. Soon we hunted and ate meat all the time which probably continued to expand our brain size slowly over time. <br>  Who knows, maybe if chimps start to eat meat they might become very intelligent over the next few thousand years....smart enough to be our slaves, but dumb enough to never revolt....|`|YXGdwwTJaa	They gradually evolved form other species by changing a little at a time and also by sudden mutations.

Some, like the neandertals of Europe (Homo sapiens neandertalensis) may have been evolutionary dead ends, or may have interbred with Homo sapiens sapiens (there are skulls which appear to be hybrids of  neandertals and modern humans in Eastern Europe).<br>  <br>  Just how many earlier groups of humans there were depends on how much you want to split groups based on fragmentary finds.  Many paleoanthropologists at least accept Homo ergaster as a distinct prior population.<br>  <br>  Prior to that, there was Homo erectus which was the first hominid species to move out of Africa.  It appeared about 1 million years ago.<br>  <br>  Prior to that was Homo habilis, the first homind for which there is really good evidence to link to stone tool manufacture.  It appeared about 2 million years ago.  There are some who doubt that Homo habilis was on the "main line" of human evolution though, and include another species, Homo rudolphensis in there too.<br>  <br>  Prior to that was the Australopithecines.  Whether or not you include them again really depends on where you want to draw the magical dividing line and say that everything on one side of the line is "human", and everything on the other isn't.<br>  <br>  The earliest Australopithecines (i.e. Australopithecus afarensis) really aren't that much different from chimpanzees - they just had a more bipedal stance, which freed up their hands.  Are they human?  I don't know.|`|nXSpS3Axaa	The most common belief from scientists is that humans (ape developing into man) began in Ethiopia. The oldest skeletal remains of primative ape/humans are located in Ethiopia. Evidence suggests that Ethiopia is the birth place of the evolution between ape and man.

v7Wflu78aa	Actually, I can't imagine wanting a true Christian to be our president.<br>  <br>  After all, who would Jesus bomb?  How many troops would Jesus put in Afghanistan?

How high would Jesus raise taxes to clothe and feed the poor?  How would Jesus handle the rich - who can't get into heaven?<br>  <br>  The reason why some Americans prefer a person who claims to be a Christian is because, "I am a Christian," and "I go to Church" are the preferred substitutes for, "You can trust me."<br>  <br>  But, plenty of untrustworthy people attend church and claim to be religious.

This “allowing of Self” will dictate the flavor of both our life and our kundalini trip. To avoid resistance and maladaptation the path of fire requires a certain strength. The key to metamorphic mastery is to become superbly adapted to one’s own incarnation. Conscious incarnation is giving ourselves permission to show up, hence awakening is a “choice.” Metamorphosis is a process of purification, and yet it is not a simple detoxification that is occurring, but the ongoing refinement of life itself toward the incarnation of a deeper Self. Evolution simply IS when we stop suppressing, abusing and holding ourselves back from the fluid realization of our Being."|`|1CS2KR7Taa	It sounds good as a starting point.<br>  But if we go deeper, we will realize we can only find ourselves within others.<br>  Our true self is found in our connection with others, based on unconditional love and giving.<br>  It is almost a paradox, we have to leave our individual egos behind, and merge with others to really learn who we are.<br>  I hope it helps, all the best.|`|AA10014750	Yes, Love one another.|`|nrXCCf76aa	"Be who you are and say what you feel because those who mind don't matter and those who matter don't mind." -Dr. Suess<br>  <br>  It has the same message, I guess?

No way !"<br>  <br>  I was also told by my boyfriend that my Mother only did the best she could, and I was shocked to hear him say that. <br>  <br>  It took me a very long time to understand what my Grandmother and boyfriend were trying to tell me. <br>  My Mother only did her possible best.

yX4xVukPaa	Actually I first came across it at University, studying law... the case of Hubbard v Vosper. It was fairly clear that Scientology was some sort of dodgy enterprise from the judgments.<br>  <br>  The case was from the 70s, I didn't think for a moment that they were still around, abusing the law, attacking their critics... Then I did my research, and found that they were... And they were *far worse* than they had at first seemed...|`|wywdxhBAaa	It's satanic in origin and is the worship not of the Lord Christ Jesus, or even Father God, but of Fallen Angels, and promotes self-adulation and man as "god".|`|4rWPX8CTaa	Yeah, I at first got it mixed up with Christian Science. The Christian cross that Scientologists use in their signage threw me off. It's quite deliberately misleading, huh. I mean, what the hell does Scientology have do with Christianity?

Thought it was something based on science.<br>  <br>  South Park educated me.
2rJwgk40aa	Pretty much.|`|NjSWQFBYaa	Why isn't the Bible seen as some type of "historical" evidence?<br>  <br>  To give an historical analogy, everyone thought that the City of Troy, and thus the Trojan War, was completely fictional until Heinrich Schliemann found the ruins of Troy right where the mythical "Iliad" said it would be.  Up until then, no one thought that Homer had based any of his stories on anything historical.<br>  <br>  It is convenient to dismiss a document as purely mythical and/or fictional when it contradicts conclusions that you have already jumped to, but is that position logical?  It sounds biased to simply dismiss the Bible out of hand as any type of evidence.<br>  <br>  I would also argue that the existence of the Christian church, as well as Christianity itself, implies that someone started it. If not Jesus, then who? And why would this anonymous founder give credit to a mythical character with the creation of a new religion?  Why not give the credit to himself?<br>  <br>  And, if you were inventing a religion, then why would you have your main character crucified?  To the Greeks & Romans, a god or a son of a god would have never allowed himself to be killed; he would have been a heroic character who would have slain his enemies and saved himself (think Hercules).  And since the Jews were fiercely monotheistic, and thought that anyone who was "hung on a tree" was cursed by their god (according to Moses), then it seems unlikely that one would have just made up a story about the Jewish god having a human son who was crucified on a tree.  You couldn't have just invented a story like this out of thin air and have expected people to buy it unless it was somehow based on real events.<br>  <br>  But there is some circumstantial evidence that suggests that the New Testament writings are historically based; they describe people, events and places that can be verified by archeological evidence to some extent. If the New Testament was completely made up, then you would think that archeology would contradict it by showing that the incidental details mentioned in the stories, such as the location or existence of certain structures or buildings, but it does not.  <br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  <br>  ...Frank Morrison, a British lawyer of the 1930s, undertook an expedition to collect circumstantial evidence to disprove the resurrection. Such evidence, of course, is admissible in all courts of law in civilized countries to prove or disprove events of which there are no living eyewitnesses. When he analyzed the evidence, he reached a stunning conclusion: The resurrection had actually taken place! Morrison presented his case in his book, "Who Moved the Stone?"<br>  <br>  Another factor worth considering is the character of the disciples. They were eleven cowardly men who shut themselves in a room after the crucifixion because they were afraid. Yet what galvanized them into action so that within their own lifetime, much of the then known world could hear the message of Christ? Some of them paid for this message with their lives. Would they have done so if the resurrection were a hoax? ...<br>  <br>  ==edit==<br>  <br>  In response to the second part of your question, having Jesus die for our sins was not a mere metaphysical idea. Jesus actually suffered the punishement for our very real sins.|`|OQdPzl15aa	actually, there is secular historical evidence that Jesus existed.<br>  <br>  Read a book called 'Shattering the Christ Myth"....the author provides concrete examples and books of historical antiquity that prove there was a man name Jesus, who claimed to be the son of God and was crucified.<br>  <br>  The debate is whether or not he is who he said he was.<br>  <br>  (you don't need a birth certificate to prove you exist...otherwise, how do we know Beethoven or Rembrant or Lincoln existed???? History and documents.  None of us has met these people, but we know they existed.)|`|hZjPYyFTaa	Of course there was an historic Jesus. During the Messianic times of the first century there were a number of men preaching that the Kingdom of God was at hand. John the Baptist was one of them. The gospels were consistent in the person of Jesus and what he said and did. You don't have to accept his divinity. Check out Time Magazine's article of the historians that mentioned Christ. in paticular Flavius Josephus, in The Antiquities of the Jews<br>  <a href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,905859,00.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.time.com/time/magazine/articl...</a><br>  Nobody could create such a powerful mythology that could impact the world to this day changing  the course of history. and the hearts of men and women. Plus inspire the greatest writers and artists of every kind over of 2000 years.<br>  A birth certificate, so Jesus needed one even though there was the small bit about the first born and Herod's census plus the Guttenberg Press wasn't invented until much later.<br>  Your out of your league here missey.|`|H9AlDTZOaa	Historically speaking, Jesus is even recongized in World History books used in high schools.|`|224cm8qtaa	So you have a birth certificate that proves you exist...

It's his title of 'Son of God' you do not have 'physical' or 'historical' proof of. Christianity is what you each individual accepts it to be. God gives us free will...he doesn't force us to believe in him. If you feel comfortable believing we evolved out of nothing then so be it. It's your free will. Just know that a true Christian would not judge you, call you names *aka PSO*, or have any other ill feelings toward you. That defeats the purpose of love one another, judge not lest thee be judged and I really don't think God wants him children calling each other names. Good luck to you in your quest to prove/disprove the existence of my Lord and Savior. :-D|`|3c8f50775ba1fe482f5b2061fc35dab8aa	so Mohamed is real?  even if it wasnt historical tell me what it means..it means at the least some cool people got together a hell of a long time ago and came up with some basic rules to live by,non were bad,so why hate it?|`|588c4efaf310c2f71fabe2d5945551d1aa	No "historical evidence" ???<br>  <br>  hmmm......<br>  <br>  here is one of many websites to explore:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.westarkchurchofchrist.org/library/extrabiblical.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.westarkchurchofchrist.org/lib...</a><br>  <br>  god bless|`|3ccd31e0b38f18f3123974ce88fcb948aa	There IS physical evidence.  <br>  <br>  Your question mark is in the wrong place.

No music other than Gregorian Chant(with occasional organ accompaniment). The ancient practice of incense is still used. It's the same language that they'd have said it in 1,000 years ago. And I think most of all that there is a greater reverence for the holy Eucharist, which is what the Mass should be all about. I wish they had it at my parish.<br>  <br>  But it would be completely wrong and missing the point if people do not know what is going on. It's not supposed to be cool or fun. It's because it's the language the Church has used for millennia. I've picked up a lot of the latin prayers(I understand the Ordinary completely). You just have to learn them, and it isn't really that hard (especially if you speak Spanish or French, etc.). Most of the time parishes will have missals with translations if you don't know the prayers yourself.

Believing in God, Souls, and an afterlife means you have to have faith. Faith can not be proven, it's going on something that is intangible. But life is an intangible and so is death. I cannot tell you to believe in anything or to accept that there is a God, Souls, or an afterlife. This is only something you can choose to believe. I can give you my own thoughts.  <br>  <br>  How depressing is life if there was no purpose to it all in the end. So many thousands of years of human life and to find out there is nothing to it. No, I cannot believe that at the end of life their is nothing. <br>  <br>  <br>  Then their are the words that Christ spoke<br>  <br>  John 11: 25-26 <br>  <br>    25 Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: <br>    26 And whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die.<br>  <br>  But don't take my word on it, you must find out whether your heart has room to accept these beliefs.|`|1TYZDRUqaa	No.  It may be comforting, but it is not the truth.

Even at that time, people tried to comfort me by telling me he was in Heaven.  But I never believed that.<br>  <br>  A few years later, I came to the conclusion that he only died in body.

All prophets of God said the same thing essentially. God is One, without partners.<br>  <br>  Jesus , Moses, Mohammad (peace be upon them), they all worshiped the same God, the God of Ibrahim (pbuh). All prophets taught "surrendering one's will to God" that is the meaning of word "Islam". JAMES 4:7 Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you. <br>  <br>  <br>  Muslims love Jesus (pbuh), they believe in his miraculous birth with the will of God without a father or sexual act (the way Adam was born without a mother and father), , they believe in miracles that Jesus (pbuh) performed with permission of God, muslims faith demands them to believe Jesus (pbuh) was a great prophet of God and belief in the original message of Jesus (pbuh) the massaya.<br>  <br>  The teachings of the Church contradict the teachings of Jesus (pbuh) and that is the cause of the confusion. <br>  If a sincere christian who wants to follow Jesus (peace be upon him), asks priests about trinity, the answer that he gets is "It is a Mystery, not explained by Jesus (pbuh) clearly", at that time again those forget that Jesus (pbuh) said, <br>  <br>  "I spoke openly to the world. I always taught in synagogues and in the temple, where the Jews always meet, and in secret I have said nothing" (John 18:20 (NKJ)). <br>  <br>  If trinity is confusing enough to be called a mystery, it cannot be from God. Because:<br>  "God is not a God of confusion."—1 Corinthians 14:33, Revised Standard Version (RS). <br>  <br>  There was no mystery in the message of Jesus (pbuh), nothing secret. Will you accept the priests' so called "mystery of trinity" and forget clear commandments of Jesus (pbuh)? <br>  <br>  Jesus (pbuh) clearly said:<br>  <br>  A) Mark 12:29: "the Lord our God, the lord is One". <br>  B) Metthew: 26:39: "He went a little farther and fell on His face and prayed" (Following Jesus (pbuh) way is following what he did). Jesus (pbuh) prayed to one God<br>  C) Matthew 4:10 "You shall worship the Lord, your God, and him only you shall serve" <br>  D) John 5:19: "Most truly I say to you, the son cannot do a single thing of his own initiative but only what he beholds the father doing."<br>  E) John 7:16  Jesus answered them, and said, My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me <br>  F) Matthew 27:46:  "Eloi (Allah?) , Eloi, lama sabachthani?" -- which means, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?" <br>  (G)Jesus answered, If I honour myself, my honour is nothing: it is my Father that honoureth me; of whom ye say, that he is your God:  John 8:54<br>  <br>  <br>  The trinity is a doctrine from about the year 325 AD, It has its roots in polytheism, It is not in the bible unless you really, really stretch it to fit. Jesus didn't have to hide the concept of trinity if it were the basis of salvation. <br>  <br>  The New Catholic Encyclopedia - 1967, VOL. XIV, PAGE 299:<br>  The formulation "one God in three Persons" was not solidly established, certainly not fully assimilated into Christian life and its profession of faith, PRIOR TO THE END OF THE 4TH CENTURY. But it is precisely this formulation that first claimed to title "The Trinitarian Dogma. AMONG THE APOSTOLIC FATHERS, THERE HAD BEEN NOTHING EVEN REMOTELY APPROACHING SUCH A MENTALITY OR PERSPECTIVE. <br>  <br>  <br>  You should not accept the word “son” literally . Word "son" was used in bible for general human beings and other prophets also. "we all are the children of father in heavens" indicates that word "son" was used in different meaning of love and care. Mathew: 5:9. "Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called the sons of God.”<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  There was just not one holy book sent by God on earth through His messengers.

Unlike Bible that was written after decades after Jesus by people who never met Jesus, this book was not preserved on paper or in one church but in hearts of thousands of muslims who memorised Quran word by word the way it was revealved. Quran should prove to be a very valuable asset to both Muslims and Christians. <br>  <br>  Quran: [4:171] O people of the scripture, do not transgress the limits of your religion, and do not say about GOD except the truth. The Messiah, Jesus (pbuh), the son of Mary, was a messenger of GOD, and His word that He had sent to Mary, and a revelation from Him. Therefore, you shall believe in GOD and His messengers. You shall not say, "Trinity." You shall refrain from this for your own good. GOD is only one god. Be He glorified; He is much too glorious to have a son. To Him belongs everything in the heavens and everything on earth. GOD suffices as Lord and Master. [5:73] Pagans indeed are those who say that GOD is a third of a trinity.

I will acknowledge that I can't prove their nonexistence 100% as they could use their magical powers to elude detection. I see no reason to believe they do though. I like to think that if evidence should arise for any proposition I would be willing to analyze it and make a fair decision based on the credibility of the data. When it comes to weak versus strong I guess I'm stronger about personal gods as represented in the monotheistic religions that make certain claims that are somewhat contradictory and fly in the face of some of the data we do have.

But that does not mean they do not hold strong moral or religious beliefs!  They can follow any religion that does not have a god and there are a lot of those!!<br>  <br>  What you describe as weak atheism is AGNOSTICISM – Does not believe anything can be know about or proved about a god.  Thus they can still believe a god exists.  This description obviously fits a lot of Christians!!!<br>  <br>  There is only one atheism and no other!!<br>  <br>  Get real they are simple definitions!!
1CS2KR7Taa	Yes, there is reincarnation.<br>  Our physical being is a housing for our souls, which souls need to go through an evolution process, which takes thousands of years.<br>  During that time the souls change their physical shell many times.<br>  Here is a short video in reincarnation:<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7Ua4FH985Q&feature=channel_page" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7Ua4FH98...</a><br>  I do not want to confuse the question too much, so regarding an evil person I would say it does not matter in this regard.<br>  I hope it helps, all the best.|`|LdprMkAcaa	I believe so, though you are entitled to your opinion. Through the process of Reincarnation, through various life-forms  the 'Aatma' or soul is cleansed of its bad Karma which in incurred during the process of it's human lifetime. Thus when someone is reborn they are no longer evil or bad as they have atoned for their sins.|`|UqgCazhGaa	Evil person is punnished by having to accept a lower form eg dog,cat, worm etc.<br>  <br>  Bg 15.8 P         The Yoga of the Supreme Person<br>      At the time of death, the consciousness he has created will carry him on to the next type of body. If he has made his consciousness like that of a cat or dog, he is sure to change to a cat's or dog's body. And, if he has fixed his consciousness on godly consciousness, he will be transferred to Krsnaloka in the spiritual world and will associate with Krsna. It is a false claim that after the annihilation of this body everything is finished. The individual soul is transmigrating from one body to another, and his present body and present activities are the background of his next body. One gets a different body according to karma, and he has to quit this body in due course. It is stated here that the subtle body, which carries the conception of the next body, develops another body in the next life. This process of transmigrating from one body to another and struggling while in the body is called karsati or struggle for existence.|`|79uzTFl7aa	We only get one ride.

cqhhM7Hhaa	Hmm..upon all the times I have read the bible I have come across several things that angels do to help man, God, and salvation. This is a list of all the things that as a theological major I know that angels do and where the proof for these actions can be found in the bible.<br>  <br>  Angels were created to glorify and worship God the Father and God the Son: <br>  Revelation 4:8 <br>  Hebrews 1:6 <br>  <br>  Angels report to God: <br>  Job 1:6 <br>  Job 2:1 <br>  <br>  Angels observe God's people: <br>  Luke 12:8-9 <br>  1 Corinthians 4:9 <br>  1 Timothy 5:21 <br>  <br>  Angels announced the birth of Jesus: <br>  Luke 2:10-14 <br>  <br>  Angels perform the will of God: <br>  Psalm 104:4 <br>  <br>  Angels ministered to Jesus: <br>  Matthew 4:11 <br>  Luke 22:43 <br>  <br>  Angels help humans: <br>  Hebrews 1:14 <br>  <br>  Angels minister to humans: <br>  Daniel <br>  Zechariah <br>  Mary <br>  Joseph <br>  Philip <br>  <br>  Angels rejoice in God's work of creation: <br>  Job 38:1-7 <br>  Revelation 4:11 <br>  <br>  Angels rejoice in God's work of salvation: <br>  Luke 15:10 <br>  <br>  Angels will join all believers in the heavenly kingdom: <br>  Hebrews 12:22-23 <br>  <br>  Through these actions the angels help to bring about the Kingdom of God, helping both God and humanity to be reconciled.<br>  Interesting question by the way!|`|f6dxZXPGaa	Copy our secrets and pass it to God lol
86PFQF4raa	Hebrews 1:14: “Are they not all ministering spirits sent forth to minister for those who will inherit salvation? <br>  <br>  God sends angels “to serve those who will inherit salvation.”<br>  <br>  The Bible also explains how those who are saved have guardian angels, angels sent to protect us and be a help when necessary. These will more often work invisibly behind the scene.<br>  <br>  Many teach that we can see angels as Elisha saw the chariots of fire all around him in 2 Kings 6:15-17. "And Elijah prayed, and said, Lord, I pray thee, open his eyes, that he might see. And the Lord opened the eyes of the young man; and he saw: and, behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire round about Elisha. (II Kings 6:17). It is true Elisha saw numerous angels but it was a one time event that never repeated again in his life nor any other prophet throughout the whole Old Testament. Elisha did not pray every time to see angels? And neither he nor Elisha prayed this again. He is the only one who participated in this one of a kind revelation. <br>  <br>  This is an unusual one time answer to Elijah’s prayer. The Bible promises to give us all insight (by faith) that there is a real spiritual war going on around us at times. Elisha did not have an experience with the angels but was allowed to see that they were more than the enemy to give him faith in God to face the enemy.<br>  <br>  There is no noticeable angelic appearances to man till after Abraham is called. From that time onward there are frequent references to their ministry on earth (Genesis 18; 19; 24:7,40; 28:12; 32:1). Throughout the Old Testament we have one particular angel, called the Angel of the Lord that continues to appear to guide and protect Israel. This continues from Abraham, to Moses through the exodus and to other key figures of faith. This angel is also known as the "angel of his presence" (Isaiah 63:9 see Exodus 23:20,21; 32:34; 33:2; Numbers 20:16) and is probably the pre-incarnate Messiah that guides his people.<br>  <br>  Hebrews 1:7: “And of the angels he saith, Who maketh his angels winds, And his ministers a flame a fire: is a quote of Ps.104:4. Who maketh his angels spirits ho) poioon tous autou pneumata. "spirits" can be rendered "winds" (In Hebrew, "spirit and wind" are often synonymous).<br>  <br>  This can be better translated as angels that are swift as wind, rapidly doing Gods will, ministering judgment for God. In this passage, angels are the spirit creatures God sends according to the need of their service; in this case, being a “flame of fire” is about judgment. <br>  <br>  The Old Testament makes this clear Ps. 21:8-9: “Your hand will find all Your enemies; your right hand will find those who hate You. You shall make them as a fiery oven in the time of Your anger; the LORD shall swallow them up in His wrath, and the FIRE shall devour them.”<br>  <br>  Isa. 66:15: “For behold, the LORD will come with FIRE and with His chariots, like a whirlwind, to render His anger with fury, and His rebuke with flames of fire.”<br>  <br>  (I love you so much babe)|`|snj9zznvaa	According to the New Testament, Gabriel announces the birth of John the Baptist (Luke 1:5-20) and the birth of Jesus (Luke 1:26-38).<br>  <br>  According to the non canonical Enoch 9:1-2 Gabriel, along with Michael, Raphael, Uriel and Suriel hear the cries of humanity under the strain of the Nephilim. It was their beseeching of 'the Ancient of Days' [Yahweh], that prompted God to call Enoch to prophethood.<br>  After Enoch informed the Watchers of their fall from Grace, Yahweh sent the archangels to earth to complete various tasks. Gabriel was to 'Go to the biters, to the reprobates, to the children of fornication, the offspring of the Watchers, from among men; bring them forth and excite them against one another. Let them perish under mutual slaughter; for length of days shall not be theirs.' Enoch 10:13. And so, Gabriel instigated wars among the Giants (the children of the Watchers).<br>  Enoch 20:7 says that Gabriel presides over 'Ikisat'. While Enoch 40:9 states that Gabriel presides over 'all that is powerful'.<br>  <br>  *edit* for Khefri<br>  The Arabic name for Gabriel is Jibril, Jibrīl, Jibreel, Jabril? or Djibril (????? , ???????,)<br>  Muslims believe Gabriel to have been the angel who revealed the Qur'an to the prophet Muhammad.<br>  Gabriel's physical appearance is described in the Hadith (4:54:4:55)|`|NWnOTkwCaa	You really do need to read Colossians.|`|f6dxZXPGaa	He is very cool guy too lol|`|NZ0mRaG3aa	As well as in Luke he's in Daniel - Daniel 8:16 and Daniel 9:21. (An angel of the Lord also appears in a vision or dream to warn Joseph in Matthew's gospel - he's not named, but maybe he was also Gabriel.)<br>  <br>  In Luke he indicates to Zechariah that he is a high angel in that he stands in the presence of God normally.<br>  <br>  Possibly he's in the books in the Old Testament apocrypha which the Roman Catholic Church calls the second canon, but I'm using a concordance that doesn't deal with that. I say that because there is also an angel called Raphael who is allegedly in the second canon; I have the second canon/apocrypha but no way of indexing into it, and I've only looked at the gold-plated parts of it.|`|7bz6BnScaa	it doesnt|`|khdFNlJ7aa	Gabriel Was a Messenger that spoke with the Prophet Muhammad.

They are not allowed to help anyone on earth unless they are related them or the angel has been promoted to arch-  or sargent-  angel. They cannot sleep but have to spend forever looking at their grandchildren and seeing them in life. You can guess what they want to do next. It is a sad life for them as the grand kids wont believe in god and his angels until the are older like twenty or so. That's my story and I am sticking to it. Oh they can not rest until someone in the family dies to take over the watch. But the more kids there are the fewer people to do the work.

A person who recognizes the inability to prove the existence of god(s) and who has no thoughts either way on the matter.<br>  <br>  Agnostic-theist - This is when a religious person recognizes that their belief cannot be proven or disproven and that all arguments concerning the existence of god(s) are merely efforts to casting doubt.  A person who I personally consider to be an intelligent religious person.  I may not agree with them but at least they appreciate my position. <br>  <br>  <br>  Becoming an agnostic is a good thing.

There is no forgiveness for those who receive a perfect knowledge of the truth and who then sin wilfully and defy the truth.<br>  <br>  29. Every member of the Church must live as becometh a saint or suffer the consequences, for "there is a possibility that man may fall from grace and depart from the living God; Therefore let the church take heed and pray always, lest they fall into temptation; Yea, and even let those who are sanctified take heed also.<br>  <br>  If men have received the good word of God, and tasted of the powers of the world to come, if they shall fall away, it is impossible to renew them again, seeing they have crucified the Son of God afresh, and put him to an open shame; so there is a possibility of falling away; you could not be renewed again, and the power of Elijah cannot seal against this sin, for this is a reserve made in the seals and power of the priesthood.<br>  <br>  These scriptures and others have been used to argue the important doctrinal question concerning the extent of an individual's influence in his own salvation: once obtained, can a state of grace be forfeited through a Christian's failure to endure? Christian writer R.E.O. White summarized Saint Augustine's views on this doctrine as follows: "Electing, effectual grace includes not only the call to salvation, the impulse of faith to respond, the inspiring of a good will, but also . . . the gift of enduring to the end. Such being the decree of the unchanging divine will, backed by divine power, it is  irresistible; the assurance of persevering in grace is therefore absolute and infallible.|`|4GiIXWUXaa	Consequence.<br>  <br>  A willful transgression of the Law comes with just punishments as a consequence of the action that are known to the one sinning.<br>  <br>  As far as the Scripture goes, what is the point? Do you seek to condemn others for sins that you yourself have also committed? Or do you seek to pass judgment as if you are sinless?<br>  <br>  Sin is disobedience therefore all sinning is a matter of a willful conscious choice to disobey. There is no one righteous who does what is right and does not sin (Romans 3:10-12; Psalms 14:1-3; 53:1-3; Eccles. 7:20) Therefore all remain guilty before the One who judges both the living and the dead. <br>  <br>  Even those who claim righteousness through Christ only are deceived if they assume that salvation and the expiation of sins is a license to pass judgment on others.<br>  <br>  "This righteousness from God comes through faith in Jesus Christ to all who believe. There is no difference, for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, and are justified freely by his grace through the redemption that came by Christ Jesus." (Romans 3:22-24)<br>  <br>  In any case the result of sin is due consequence for those actions. Be it in this life immediately or in the one to come. Be not deceived, each man is held accountable for his actions, and his words; either now or after death. This is applicable to Christians also. Just because we are "saved" does not mean that we are not held accountable for what deeds we have done in the body, whether good or bad.<br>  <br>  The only consolation for Christians is that we escape eternal judgement and have come under the Law of Grace which frees us from the penalty that our willful sins deserve.<br>  <br>  Was your question meant to be rhetorical?

Ps. 106:32, 33, R.S.V. <br>  <br>  Cursed be the man that eateth any food until evening, that I may be avenged on mine enemies. 1 Sam. 14: 24.<br>  <br>   During the day's battle Jonathan, who had not heard of the king's command, unwittingly offended by eating a little honey as he passed through a wood. Saul learned of this at evening. He had declared that the violation of his edict should be punished with death; and though Jonathan had not been guilty of a willful sin, though God had miraculously preserved his life and had wrought deliverance through him, the king declared that the sentence must be executed. To spare the life of his son would have been an acknowledgment on the part of Saul that he had sinned in making so rash a vow. This would have been humiliating to his pride.

He said that whoever taught anyone not to obey all the commandments would be least in the Kingdom of Heaven.|`|AA10471892	When referring to the law, he always referred to it as either "your" law or "their" law when referring to the Jews, or "the law of Moses."  He never referred to the law as the "law of God" or "my" law.|`|qyoXSdPCaa	Matt 5:17-18<br>  17 Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil.<br>  18 For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.<br>  (KJV)<br>  <br>  When the Bible speaks of the law, it usually refers to the law given to Moses. This law is recorded in Exodus, Leviticus, and Deuteronomy, and is often called the "law of Moses" (Jos. 1:7-8; Lk. 24:44). It is also called the "law of the Lord" (Is. 5:24).  <br>  The law's purpose? (1) It was given to reveal sin and to show man that he is a guilty sinner before God (Ro. 3:19-20; 7:12-13; 1 Ti. 1:9-10). (2) It was given to bring men to Jesus Christ (Ga. 3:24-25).<br>  <br>  How were people saved during the time of the law? (1) Men have always been saved by faith in God's Word (Hab. 2:4; Ro. 4:1-8; He. 11:7). People in O.T. times did not necessarily understand completely about how Jesus Christ would come to earth and die for their sins, but when they believed in the things God told them, they were saved by their faith in God's Word (He. 11). (2) Men have always been saved on the basis of Christ's blood and death (Ro. 3:25). There is only one reason our holy God can forgive man's sins, and that is because Christ paid the penalty for those sins. Therefore, believers of all ages have been saved on the basis of Christ's bloody death, even though they did not necessarily fully understand this salvation (1 Pe. 1:9-12). The O.T. animal sacrifices did not remove sins, but only looked forward to Christ (Jn. 1:29; He. 10:1-4).<br>  <br>  What is the Christian's relationship with the O.T. law? The Bible says Christians are dead to the law (Ro. 7:1-4). What does this mean? (1) The law does not control the Christian's life (Ro. 7:1-2). Christ is our new husband, and He controls our lives through the New Covenant. While the eternal principles of morality reflected in the law of Moses are respected by the Christian, our rule in life is not the law of Moses but the life of Christ as revealed to us in the N.T. (2) The law cannot condemn the Christian (Ro. 7:3). The Lord Jesus Christ took our condemnation upon Himself on the cross! (3) The Christian serves Christ through the Spirit, not through his own power and wisdom (Ro. 7:6). <br>  <br>  The difference between keeping the O.T. law and living the Christian life. (1) The motive is different: We do not live the Christian life in order to gain righteousness, blessing, and life, but because we already possess these things in Christ. We serve Christ out of a sense of gratitude because of the salvation God has given to us, not in order to earn salvation or escape judgment. We already have perfect righteousness (Ro. 3:21-24; 2 Co. 5:21). We already have eternal blessing (Ep. 1:3). We already have life (Ep. 2:1). (2) The power is different: We live the Christian life through the power of the indwelling Spirit, not through our own strength and wisdom (Ro. 8:9-14). (3) The compulsion is different: We live the Christian life because Christ lives in us and works in us (Col. 1:29). The compulsion is from within. The law of God has been written on our hearts and compels us to serve God (He. 10:16). (4) The pattern is different: The Christian's goal is to be conformed to the image of Christ (2 Co. 3:18; Ro. 8:29; 13:14; Col. 3:10; Ep. 4:23-24). The O.T. law was only a shadow of Christ and of heavenly things (He. 8:5; 10:1; Col. 2:17; Ro. 2:20). Now that the Lord Jesus Christ has come, we have the perfect pattern and substance. <br>  <br>  Some common errors in regard to the law: (1) Justification by works (contrast Ga. 2:16-21; Ac. 13:38-39). (2) Receiving the Spirit by works (contrast Ga. 3:1-2). (3) Sanctification by works (contrast Ga. 3:3). (4) Mixing law and grace, faith and works, for salvation or sanctification (contrast Ro. 11:6; 3:21-22; 4:4-6; 9:30-33; Ga. 2:16). (5) Throwing off all morality and law; "since we are not under law, we can do anything we please" (contrast Ro. 6:1-14; 1 Co. 9:21; Ep. 4:17-32; Col. 3:1-25). (6) Bringing the shadows of O.T. law into Christianity--sabbath keeping, dietary restrictions; special priesthood; elaborate temples; candles and incense (contrast Col. 2:14-17). <br>  <br>  God's warnings to those who misuse the law: (1) To turn away from the gospel of grace alone is to turn away from Christ (Ga. 1:6). (2) To turn away from the gospel of grace alone is to be cursed (Ga. 1:8-9). (3) To turn away from the gospel of grace alone is to turn away from salvation (Ga. 4:9-20; 5:3-6). (4) To turn back to O.T. legalism is to fail to enter into rest (He. 4). (5) Those who turn back to O.T. legalism crucify the Son of God afresh and cannot be brought again to repentance (He. 6:4-8). (6) Those who turn back to O.T. legalism will be judged severely (He. 10:26-31). (7) God has no pleasure in those who turn back to O.T. legalism (He. 10:38-39).|`|aYY9dPVJaa	Mosaic-He fulfilled it to the letter.<br>  man's-He respected civil authority, and kept those, too (ex. taxes).|`|SM9rugibaa	Christ did not flout the law.

Jesus healed a lame man on the Sabbath, He healed a blind man on the Sabbath, and He confronted a group of men who were about to stone an accused adulteress, saying "if any among you be without sin, let him cast the first stone".<br>  <br>  The Pharisees had it all wrong.  They added burdens to a man's back, Jesus said, and didn't lift a finger to help that man.<br>  <br>  There is a verse in the bible that says "the law was a schoolmaster to bring us to Christ".  Jesus showed that it was mercy that God desires.

Lk4aCBACaa	Astrology for the most part accepts that the beginning of a lifetime is with the first breath. There are a couple random astrologers who have played around with setting charts from the date of conception, but there's a really big problem with that: how the heck are you supposed to get the exact data you need?<br>  <br>  An astrological chart is based on the date, place and *exact* time of birth. If you were doing a chart for the conception, how could you possibly know the exact time down to the minute? First of all, how do you know which sex act got the woman pregnant? Then you'd have to consider how long the sperms' journey to the egg took... Even ultrasounds have a margin of error of a few days. There's simply no way to be as accurate as astrology needs to be with this kind of event.<br>  <br>  PS: Pluto is still a planet, just a different classification of planet (dwarf). :)|`|e67045ea08edd6bf714e0243622a0defaa	Pro-life or Pro-choice aside, astrology is based on the physical date of birth.|`|E2VUH8Q0aa	I am Pro Life and I believe in astrology.

While many churches in my city do have a heart for God, I just really like the one I am at. Every person has a church that just sort of appeals to them for various reasons. But, in the end, we realize that we go there to meet with God and connect with His body, no matter where it is stationed.<br>  <br>  I love praising God, but probably do it in a different way than you considering our church is a contemporary Christian one (has worship bands and sings newer songs/ old songs in new ways). And prayer is one of the best things to do! After intense worship just going straight into like half an hour of hardcore prayer... awesome! <br>  <br>  As for God knowing that you love him, if you neglect him and speak like that it certainly doesn't show much love. I find no waste of time praising the God of the universe and learning more about him as he reveals himself to me. <br>  <br>  "Better is one day in your courts than a thousand days elsewhere."
g8JGLnk6aa	First off, I'm sorry for your losses.<br>  <br>  Now to answer your question: no. There is no connection here. First off, the number 3 is an abstraction. It doesn't actually exist. "3" is just a label we have created to represent a certain quantity. To that extent, "quantity" is also just a concept we have created as well. <br>  <br>  But philosophy aside, there is no connection between these events. They are all separate from one another. Once you learn the expression "bad things happen in 3's", you will start to see examples of it everywhere. And you assign the bad things yourself. How many bad things occurred in the world between those 3 events you described? That was 3 months -- I'm sure a countless number of bad things occurred -- car crashes, murders, wars, genocide, illness...yet you only chose 3 out of those hundreds of bad things to string together as though they were connected. Why do you assign significance to certain events? Because they mean something to you? Just because they mean something to you, it does not mean they are connected. <br>  <br>  Think of every bad thing that happened as a bead. The pile of beads grows larger continuously. You are building a necklace. Why do you choose 3 of those beads to string together? <br>  <br>  The point is, YOU assign significance to events. YOU create patterns where they don't exist. YOU choose to string events together even when they are unrelated. <br>  <br>  Humans are especially good at creating patterns, even when there are none.

iSU0O9W0aa	You can ask her and she will be happy to answer you to make it clear why.<br>  Very briefly I will explain here.<br>  The Qur'an lays down the principle of the law of modesty. In Surah 24: An-Nur: 30 and 31, modesty is enjoined both upon Muslim men and Muslim women4:.<br>   "Say to the believing men that they should lower their gaze and guard their modesty: that will make for Greater purity for them: And God is Well-acquainted with all that they do. And say to the believing women That they should lower their gaze And guard their modesty: and they should not display beauty and ornaments expect what (must ordinarily) appear thereof; that They must draw their veils over their bosoms and not display their beauty except to their husbands, their fathers, their husband's fathers, their sons, their husband's sons, or their women, or their slaves whom their right hands possess, or male servants free of physical needs, or small children who have no sense of the shame of sex; and that they should not strike their feet in order to draw attention to their ornaments.<br>  The following conclusions may be made on the basis of the above-cited verses5:<br>  <br>  1. The Qur'anic injunctions enjoining the believers to lower their gaze and behave modestly applies to both Muslim men and women and not Muslim women alone.<br>  <br>  2. Muslim women are enjoined to "draw their veils over their bosoms and not display their beauty" except in the presence of their husbands, other women, children, eunuchs and those men who are so closely related to them that they are not allowed to marry them. Although a self-conscious exhibition of one's "zeenat" (which means "that which appears to be beautiful" or "that which is used for embellishment or adornment") is forbidden, the Qur'an makes it clear that what a woman wears ordinarily is permissible. Another interpretation of this part of the passage is that if the display of "zeenat" is unintentional or accidental, it does not violate the law of modesty.<br>  <br>  3. Although Muslim women may wear ornaments they should not walk in a manner intended to cause their ornaments to jingle and thus attract the attention of others.<br>  <br>  One of the verses in the Qur'an protects a woman's fundamental rights. Aya 59 from Sura al-Ahzab reads:<br>  <br>  O Prophet! Tell Thy wives And daughters, and the Believing women, that They should cast their Outer garments over Their Persons (when outside): That they should be known (As such) and not Molested.<br>  <br>  Women who on account of their advanced age are not likely to be regarded as sex-objects are allowed to discard "the outer garment" but there is no relaxation as far as the essential Qur'anic principle of modest behavior is concerned.<br>  Surah 24: An-Nur, Aya 60 reads:<br>  <br>  Such elderly women are past the prospect of marriage,-- There is no blame on them, if they lay aside their (outer) garments, provided they make not wanton display of their beauty; but it is best for them to be modest: and Allah is One who sees and knows all things.<br>  <br>  <br>  I hope sister I gave a little idea.<br>  May God Almighty bless us all, Amen.|`|1l69CCScaa	It stems from the belief that people should dress modestly.  Although the hijab is not mentioned specifically in the Qur'an it has been promoted by many Imams for hundreds of years.  Many sects of Islam don't require hijabs, it all depends on the practitioners, the sect, and the Imam.  In recent years it has become a major debate as to whether Imam-set ideas of modesty should be followed as opposed to personal interpretations of modesty.  <br>  <br>  In particular, the hajab is meant to cover the most alluring aspects of a woman, of course the style of the hijab varies as much as those who wear them.<br>  <br>  <br>  Do ask your friend why she wears the hijab.  It could be for a number of reasons, from habit to the belief that it's modest apparel the reasons can be fascinating.  Asking would be the equivalent to asking some Christians "what does the man on the cross symbolize?"|`|wywdxhBAaa	To hide the hideous bruises and horrible scars all over their bodies from the brutal beatings they get from their psycho Muslim husbands who are all women-hating misogynists.|`|U53R1Bq0aa	Muslim women wear scarves to be modest...Islam teaches women to be modest and only to show their hair (their beauty) to their husbands and not the rest of the world. Women have to cover in front of anyone the can marry, so that means they do not cover in front of their dads,brothers,uncles, and so on.. Also, Islam does not allow gay marriages so women can uncover in front of other women...<br>  <br>  I hope that cleared things up for you! =)|`|uzczwVT1aa	You can go ahead and ask your friend, its not offensive or anything, but anyway Muslim women wear the hijab because we're told to do so in the Qur'an, our holy book, so we do it for Allah first, not for men. Modesty is important in Islam, and both men and women are told to be modest. Women shouldn't be forced into it - wearing the hijab must be her choice because its about her faith, not anyone else's. There are many reasons why the hijab is important, but the main reason why we do wear it is for Allah, because he told us to, and thats more than enough for us.

An act of obedience.<br>  <br>  The hijab is an act of obedience to Allah and to his prophet (peace be upon him), Allah says in the Quran:<br>  <br>  "It is not for a believer, man or woman, when Allah and His messenger have decreed a matter that they should have an option in their decision. And whoever disobeys Allah and His Messenger (peace be upon him), has indeed strayed in a plain error." [Noble Quran 33:36]<br>  <br>  Allah also said:<br>  <br>  "And tell the believing women to lower their gaze (from looking at forbidden things) and protect their private parts (from illegal sexual acts, etc) and not to show off their adornment except what must (ordinarily) appear thereof, that they should draw their veils over their Juyubihinnah." [Noble Quran 24:31]<br>  <br>  Juyubihinnah: The respected scholars from As-Salaf As-Saleh (righteous predecessors) differed whether the veil cover of the body must include the hands and face or not. Today, respected scholars say that the hands and face must be covered. Other respected scholars say it is preferable for women to cover their whole bodies.<br>  <br>  2. The Hijab is IFFAH (Modesty).<br>  <br>  Allah made the adherence to the hijab a manifestation for chastity and modesty. Allah says:<br>  <br>  "O Prophet! Tell your wives and your daughters and the women of the believers to draw their cloaks (veils) over their bodies (when outdoors). That is most convenient that they should be known and not molested." [Noble Quran 33:59]<br>  <br>  In the above Ayah there is an evidence that the recognition of the apparent beauty of the woman is harmful to her. When the cause of attraction ends, the restriction is removed. This is illustrated in the case of elderly women who may have lost every aspect of attraction. Allah made it permissible for them to lay aside their outer garments and expose their faces and hands reminding, however, that is still better for them to keep their modesty.<br>  <br>  3. The hijab is Taharah (Purity)<br>  <br>  Allah had shown us the hikmah (wisdom) behind the legislation of the hijab:<br>  <br>  "And when you ask them (the Prophet's wives) for anything you want, ask them from behind a screen, that is purer for your hearts and their hearts." [Noble Quran 33:53]<br>  <br>  The hijab makes for greater purity for the hearts of believing men and women because it screens against the desire of the heart. Without the hijab, the heart may or may not desire. That is why the heart is more pure when the sight is blocked (by hijab) and thus the prevention of fitnah (evil actions is very much manifested. The hijab cuts off the ill thoughts and the greed of the sick hearts:<br>  <br>  "Be not soft in speech, lest he in whose heart is a disease (of hypocrisy or evil desire for adultery, etc) should be moved with desire, but speak in an honorable manner." [Noble Quran 33:32]<br>  <br>  4. The hijab is a Shield<br>  <br>  The prophet (peace be upon him) said: "Allah, Most High, is Heaven, is Ha'yei (Bashful), Sit'tir (Shielder). He loves Hayah' (Bashfulness) and Sitr (Shielding; Covering)." The Prophet (peace be upon him) also said: "Any woman who takes off her clothes in other than her husband's house (to show off for unlawful purposes), has broken Allah's shield upon her." The hadith demonstrates that depending upon the kind of action committed there will be either reward (if good) or punishment (if bad).<br>  <br>  5. The hijab is Taqwah (Righteousness)<br>  <br>  Allah says in the Quran:<br>  <br>  "O children of Adam! We have bestowed raiment upon you to cover yourselves (screen your private parts, etc) and as an adornment. But the raiment of righteousness, that is better." [Noble Quran 7:26]<br>  <br>  The widespread forms of dresses in the world today are mostly for show off and hardly taken as a cover and shield of the woman's body. To the believing women, however the purpose is to safeguard their bodies and cover their private parts as a manifestation of the order of Allah. It is an act of Taqwah (righteousness).<br>  <br>  6. The hijab is Eeman (Belief or Faith)<br>  <br>  Allah did not address His words about the hijab except to the believing women, Al-Mo'minat. In many cases in the Quran Allah refers to the "the believing women". Aisha, the wife of the prophet (peace be upon him), addressed some women from the tribe of Banu Tamim who came to visit her and had light clothes on them, they were improperly dressed: "If indeed you are believing women, then truly this is not the dress of the believing women, and if you are not believing women, then enjoy it."<br>  <br>  7. The hijab is Hayah' (Bashfulness)<br>  <br>  There are two authentic hadith which state: "Each religion has a morality and the morality of Islam is hayah'" AND "Bashfulness is from belief, and belief is in Al-Jannah (paradise)". The hijab fits the natural bashfulness which is a part of the nature of women.<br>  <br>  8. The hijab is Gheerah<br>  <br>  The hijab fits the natural feeling of Gheerah, which is intrinsic in the straight man who does not like people to look at his wife or daughters. Gheerah is a driving emotion that drives the straight man to safeguard women who are related to him from strangers. The straight MUSLIM man has Gheerah for ALL MUSLIM women In response to lust and desire, men look (with desire) at other women while they do not mind that other men do the same to their wives or daughters. The mixing of sexes and absence of hijab destroys the Gheerah in men. Islam considers Gheerah an integral part of faith. The dignity of the wife or daughter or any other Muslim woman must be highly respected and defended.

He gives us the Ten Commandments, and tells us to love ourselves and our neighors as we would love the Lord. That DOES NOT give us permission to keeping doing the same sin day after day and expect to be forgiven just cuz we ask for it.<br>  <br>  My suggestion to you would be to NOT talk smack on the Lord.

First 70% of air we do not use, N2.  Less than 30% of air is 02.  Furthermore, through looking at geology, frozen ice cores, and other sources, we can see that the air of the Earth was not the same as it was millions of years ago.  In fact, it wasn't until the diversification of the photosynthetic algae (which release 02) did our Earth contain satisfactory 02.  It then took animals billions of years to figure out how to use it.  <br>  <br>  2) The ozone layer was not created for our skin.  Our skin evolved the ability to withstand the amount of UV light let in through the ozone layer.  Moreover, mutations in certain persons genes actually inhibit them from stepping into the sun because they lack the ability to resist the UV rays.  Further evidence can be seen in skin color.  Dark people live in places filled with sun, white people developed in cloudy European areas.  This isn't a coincidence.<br>  <br>  3) Of course everything we need comes from the Earth.  Evolution is the explanation of this.  But it wasn't placed for us.  We just figured out how to use it.   One example of this is our vestigial appendix.  We can't eat all plants. But many species can.  We could solve the food crisis easily if we could just eat leaves off of trees.   Well...actually one of our ancestors had that ability and our appendix is evidence of it.   The appendix (which no longer functions or has any purpose in our body...except for getting infected and being a big source of disease) is seen in many animals as a way to digest the "greeny" plants we cannot.   This would be great so that starving kids in third world countries would have food.  Unfortunately, our animal ancestors got more than enough energy foraging fruits over chlorophyll. <br>  <br>  Take an Evolution class.  You'll see why people defend it.|`|b8e3dd68b7fdbbbac6132e0c73015651aa	It's easy to accept when you have such limited understanding of the world around you.

We also appreciate the comfort and joy that brings to you. However, we do not share the same belief structure here in our home. Since this issue has become a bit of a point of anger and hurt, we are going to have to specifically ask that no more mention of religion, God, ways of worship, or lack thereof be brought up to us. Please do NOT ever contact another church, or suggest to other people in scandal or gossip that we are in sin, or in need of God. That is our path in life, and should we feel like going down it, it will be of our own volition -- not yours.<br>  <br>  On that note, and as you know: we are about to have a baby. We would love for you all to be involved in our child's life. Part of being responsible parents is surrounding the family with people who love and support all of us, not fight or argue or force beliefs. We would be very upset to have to start pulling away from this family if a decent level of respect is not obtained.<br>  <br>  So on that note, again, in order to stay a loving part of your extended family we are asking you not approach us or any churches regarding our faith. If you feel the need to silently pray for us, by all means do, we appreciate it -- we just no longer need to know about it. <br>  <br>  Thanks,<br>  <br>  US"<br>  <br>  Don't respond at all to the facebook issue anymore.

The greatest thing you can tell them is right now ur happy and ur observing them and how they live their life as a testimony to christ.  <br>    What will bring peace to both of you is tell them they can pray for you, that if god has salvation for you it will be as they pray for you. Then as the bible says in 1 Peter 2:12<br>  having your conduct honorable among the Gentiles, that when they speak against you as evildoers, they may, by your good works which they observe, glorify God in the day of visitation."

AA11232725	I get my information from Christians who are scientists and who use the quotes of evolutionists to make their case. You can quibble about the definition of what a "theory" is but I would rather talk about the claims of evolution versus the claims of Creation and which model the fossil evidence supports.<br>  <br>  The fossil record is characterized by abrupt appearance of fully formed and complex creatures that vary little over time.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.foolishfaith.com/book_chap3_fossils.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.foolishfaith.com/book_chap3_f...</a><br>  <br>  Evolutionist Niles Eldredge[48] of the American Museum of Natural History said, “[Darwin] prophesied that future generations of paleontologists would fill in these gaps by diligent search. . . . One hundred and twenty years of paleontological research later, it has become abundantly clear that the fossil record will not confirm this part of Darwin’s predictions. Nor is the problem a miserably poor record. The fossil record simply shows that this prediction was wrong.”[49] <br>  <br>  Geologist David Raup, supervisor of one of the largest fossil collections in the world, said that today “we have even fewer examples of evolutionary transition than we had in Darwin’s time. . . . The evidence we find in the geologic record is not nearly as compatible with Darwinian natural selection as we would like it to be. Darwin was completely aware of this. He was embarrassed by the fossil record because it didn’t look the way he predicted it would. . . . Some of the classic cases of Darwinian change in the fossil record, such as the evolution of the horse in North America, have had to be discarded or modified as the result of more detailed information.”[50] <br>  <br>  Niles Eldredge, again commenting on the acclaimed exhibit of horse evolution, states, “There have been an awful lot of stories, some more imaginative than others, about what the nature of that history [of life] really is. The most famous example, still on exhibit downstairs, is the exhibit on horse evolution prepared perhaps 50 years ago. That has been presented as the literal truth in textbook after textbook. Now I think that that is lamentable, particularly when the people who propose those kinds of stories may themselves be aware of the speculative nature of some of that stuff.”[51] <br>  <br>  A senior evolutionary paleontologist at the British Museum of Natural History, Colin Patterson[52] has also made some surprising statements about transitional fossils: “Gould and the American Museum people are hard to contradict when they say there are no transitional fossils. . . . I will lay it on the line — there is not one such fossil for which one could make a watertight argument. . . . It is easy to make up stories of how one form gave rise to another. . . . But such stories are not part of science, for there is no way of putting them to the test.”[53]|`|3ba0ab7304ca31210254987d14dbe035aa	I don't pay any attention to evolution.

Surely this is an apt description of evolution. <br>  Evolution is a 'belief system' i.e. a religion !<br>  <br>  Models of science are subject to change for both creationists and evolutionists. But, the beliefs that these models are built on are not. The problem is that most scientists do not realize that it is the belief (religion) of evolution that is the basis for scientific models (the interpretations, or stories) used to attempt an explanation of the present. Evolutionists are not prepared to change their actual belief that all life can be explained by natural processes and that no God is involved (or even needed). Evolution is a religion to which they are committed. <br>  <br>  Evolution is a religion, not a science.<br>  <br>  Peer review is the main problem, as if all your peers are of the same opinion, what use are they?<br>  <br>  One cannot, I believe, be a Christian and believe Satan's evolution lies.<br>  <br>  May God bless you as you study His Word<br>  <br>  <:)))><|`|Wn64Oxxyaa	Nova (PBS) has a great special of a PA court case that shows the religious will go to great lengths to try to push their agenda, including perjury.|`|A9oWuOFBaa	They're getting it from those blasted Gravityists.|`|f4ik0ScQaa	Most of the "smart" ones know they are lying.

A proposition that have yet to be proven.<br>  Theory is no fact.<br>  Darwin himself was not an Atheist.<br>  In his writings he himself had doubts.<br>  <br>  Just to deem Evolution it to be science is another topic.<br>  Just for instant.<br>  We can all agree that there is much more than we can see, hear, smell, taste, feel.<br>  Which are the 5 senses.<br>  Would you agree there is more than that?<br>  We believe in air, but we don't see it.<br>  We feel the affects of it, right.<br>  We don't see radio waves, or television signals.<br>  There are cell phone signals, too.<br>  They are there.<br>  We don't see microwaves.<br>  There are frequencies that we do not hear that dogs can hear.<br>  Just because you can't sense it with your senses, doesn't negate it.<br>  Ok.<br>  Everyone believes in something.<br>  Atheists say there is no God.<br>  But they cannot prove there is no God.<br>  You can't prove a negative.<br>  If someone doesn't want to believe in God, no amount of evidence can force such a person to accept God's existence as fact.<br>  <br>  Evolution says that matter and life itself started billions of years ago and changed upwardly into their present states via natural selection. <br>  <br>  What is science?<br>  For the most part when people are talking about science, there a 2 types.<br>  One is Soft Science and the other is Hard Science.<br>  That's all the time I have for now. <br>  I will continue at another junction.

AyEkA6Flaa	This whole subject is very nuanced and very difficult.<br>  <br>  There is not an infallible list of infallible councils and infallible teachings, lol.  I could absolutely make your head spin on these subjects if you wanted me to.<br>  <br>  To be totally honest, I think worrying about infallibility misses the point -- that we have a living *relationship* with God the Father, Son and Holy Spirit, within Community, nourished by the holy Mysteries.<br>  <br>  But I think most would agree that there is a consensus among Catholics in teaching:<br>  <br>  -- The Nicene Creed<br>       -- The Triune God<br>       -- Christ Jesus as our Divine and Human Savior<br>  -- The decrees of Trent as regards Grace and Tradition and Sacraments<br>  <br>  --The Roman Church also claims the Immaculate Conception of Mary and the Infallibility of Papal Dogmas given Ex Cathedra, however, note that Vatican Council I is not received by the Eastern Churches.<br>  <br>  But the doctrine of Papal Infallibility does not apply to all Papal Bulls and Encyclicals.  Some of those have been erroneous, like the Bull of Paul IV in 1555, "C um nimis absurdum" which established the Jewish ghettoes in Papal lands, mandated Jews wearing yellow hats, forbade them to own land, and taught that they were in "everlasting servitude".  <br>  <br>  Likewise, it does not cover the teaching of the Holy Office and Pius IX, supporting slavery: "Slavery itself, considered as such in its essential nature, is not at all contary to the natural and divine law, and there can be several just titles of slavery, and these are referred to by approved theologians and commentators of the sacred canons … It is not contrary to the natural and divine law for a slave to be sold, bought, exchanged or given".<br>  <br>  Note also that the teachings regarding sexual ethics are *NOT* considered infallibly taught.  When Pope Paul VI promulgated "Humanae Vitae" in 1968, it was specifically said that it was not infallible.  And, this teaching has NOT been received by the majority of faithful Catholic married couples.  Likewise, teachings against homosexuality do not bear the weight of infallibility.<br>  <br>  But you must ask yourself the question: Do you wish to live a life of perpetual intellectual gymnastics?  Or do you wish to live a life of peace that is free in the freedom of Christ Jesus (Galatians 5:1)?|`|1TYZDRUqaa	Papal infallibility is the dogma in Catholic theology that, by action of the Holy Spirit, the Pope is preserved from even the possibility of error] when he solemnly declares or promulgates to the Church a dogmatic teaching on faith or morals as being contained in divine revelation, or at least being intimately connected to divine revelation. It is also taught that the Holy Spirit works in the body of the Church, as sensus fidei, to ensure that dogmatic teachings proclaimed to be infallible will be received by all Catholics. This dogma, however, does not state that the Pope cannot commit sin in his own personal life.<br>  <br>  This doctrine was defined dogmatically in the First Vatican Council of 1870. According to Catholic theology, there are several concepts important to the understanding of infallible, divine revelation: Sacred Scripture, Sacred Tradition, and the Sacred Magisterium. The infallible teachings of the pope are part of the Sacred Magisterium, which also consists of ecumenical councils and the "ordinary and universal magisterium". In Catholic theology, papal infallibility is one of the channels of the infallibility of the Church. The infallible teachings of the pope must be based on, or at least not contradict, Sacred Tradition or Sacred Scripture. Papal infallibility does not signify that the pope is impeccable, i.e., that he is specially exempt from liability to sin.<br>  <br>  In practice, popes seldom use their power of infallibility, but rely on the notion that the Church allows the office of the pope to be the ruling agent in deciding what will be accepted as formal beliefs in the church." Since the solemn declaration of Papal Infallibility by Vatican I on July 18, 1870, this power has been used only once ex cathedra: in 1950 when Pope Pius XII defined the Assumption of Mary as being an article of faith for Roman Catholics. Prior to the solemn definition of 1870, Pope Pius IX, with the support of the overwhelming majority of Roman Catholic Bishops, had proclaimed Immaculate Conception an ex cathedra dogma in December 1854.|`|38f15601baa14cb41ff2021454524fbbaa	The doctrine of papal infallibility refers to the fact that the Pope is considered infallible *only* when he speaks "ex cathedra" ("from the chair of Peter") for the entire Church on matters of faith and morals. This is extremely rare, and in fact, the only such doctrine that I'm aware of is the Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin.<br>  <br>  There may be a few other examples of papal infallibility, but that's the only one that I know about.|`|f522078ffdf8786fcab6f8023c6befbdaa	Papal Infallibility applies only when the Pope speaks specifically Ex Cathedra, meaning literally, "From the Chair" (refering to the throne of St. Peter), on matters of doctrine or dogma concerning the faith and morals of the whole Church.<br>  <br>  In all of Catholic history, it has been invoked officially only twice.  Other documents considered to meet the criteria bring the total to seven.<br>  <br>  The seven are:<br>  <br>  Immaculate Conception of Mary (Officially invoked)<br>  Assumption of Mary (Officially invoked)<br>  Two Natures of Christ<br>  Two Wills of Christ<br>  Beatific Vision<br>  Condemnation of five Jansen propositions as Heretical<br>  Condemnation of seven Jansenist propositions of the Synod of Pistoia as Heretical<br>  <br>  Papal Infallibility does not imply that the Pope is perfect or without sin or always right in anything he says.|`|e6brEEbOaa	As I understand it, infallibility covers only the judgment of the pope in extremely particular circumstances.<br>  <br>  In other words the pope is not always infallible in his judgment only in a very small minority of time when certain criteria and rituals have been satisfied. <br>  <br>  I am not a Catholic, so if a Catholic believes I am misrepresenting something here, I completly defer to their position.|`|xabf4UbJaa	dogma is the basics like Mary was the mother of Jesus, Jesus is the son of God

I don't think Christians should go to war at all, since it does involve killing others. "So, Christians should let others fight battles while they sit back?" - some would ask. Well, no. If everyone would follow Christ and obey the Laws of God, we would not even have wars. Yes, we will make mistakes here and there, since we are only human. But causing a war would be out of the question. <br>  <br>  "But, religion is the cause of most wars?". Wrong. Do your research. Less than 7% of all wars have any religious entanglement. Plus, more than 55% involved Islam, which didn't even exist as a religion more than half the time of these wars. People cause wars in the name of religion and God, but that is such an easy excuse to hide the truth. I mean, I can go cause a war and say I'm doing it in the name of chocolate.

AA11796124	<<Segregated Catholic churches in the south? I'm not catholic but attend catholic church once in a while with my wife and her mother. And over the years I have noticed one thing. There isn't any white people there! Well let me reprise that there is only about a hand full at the most. I asked about it and was informed that "the whites go to another catholic church on the other side of town.">><br>  <br>  You're reading too much into something that just isn't there.<br>  It's fairly obvious that this Church is mostly black people attending because the majority of Catholics in that part of town are black.<br>  So wouldn't it stand to reason that the Church in the "white" end of town have mostly white people?<br>  <br>  In larger towns, it's common for there to be more than one Catholic house of worship, so that no one has to travel too far out of their way to attend Mass regularly.<br>  <br>  <br>  <<And then I started to pay attention to things like the priest is always either form another country or black you never really see a white priest at a catholic church attended by mostly blacks. Is this by design of the catholic church or by the people that attend the church.>><br>  <br>  Did it ever cross your mind that the black Catholic parish may have asked for a black priest? AND many black priests do come from Africa because the Church is growing by leaps and bounds there.<br>  <br>  <br>  <<Why is it that Father O'Brien is at the white church and Father Jose is at the Black church.>><br>  <br>  What is INTRINSICALLY wrong with that?<br>  <br>  <br>  <<And why would a town that is small as the one my wife is from have 2 catholic churches anyway?>><br>  <br>  Like I said, it's not uncommon for there to be several Catholic parishes in a single town. Typically, a Catholic house of worship is built NOT primarilly due to the Will of the Church but due to the collective will of the parishioners.<br>  <br>  Did it ever occur to you that perhaps, for whatever reason, the blacks and whites want their own parish? And, if that's what they want, what's the problem with it?|`|yQNit56Qaa	I think what you are experiencing is not the result of church segregation - rather, it is the result of **town** segregation.  At one time, your town was even more segregated than it is today.  Assuming that your town is large enough to support 2 Roman Catholic churches (this seems to be the case), it is only natural that the attendees go to the church which is nearer.  Thus, when the town was more definitely segregated, the "white" side of town would attend the church that was located in the "white" side of town, etc.  Of course, racial prejudice still exists, so that even a person living closer to the "other race's" church might travel a longer distance in order to attend a church that his or her racial prejudice allows them to feel comfortable.<br>  <br>  BUT, no, I don't think that this is something commonly seen in Roman Catholic churches.  It is, rather, the unplanned but natural result of former strict segregation within your own town.  I don't think the race of the priest is significant at all - although it most certainly could be, if prejudice exists among the local Roman Catholic clergy and especially if your local bishop allows such things.  It certainly is not a practice common to the international Roman Catholic Church.<br>  <br>  Jim, <a href="http://www.bible-reviews." rel="nofollow">http://www.bible-reviews.</a> com|`|667fbb3f5754a94cb0e93724d53755a5aa	That's a good question, but more than likely the people who were going to the "black" and "white" Catholic churches didn't want to change churches after they were no longer segregated.   I don't know why the Pope or whomever has a white priest at the "white" one and Jose at the "black" one.  There must be enough Catholics in your area to have two Catholic churches.|`|5gANvXyTaa	Thats weird. Ive never heard of that before. But there is alot of things that could have happened from that.

He is forerunner of the Lord. The word for Lord in Isaiah 40 there is the word for Yahweh. Luke means that John the Baptist is forerunner of Jesus (the Lord, kurios in Greek.)<br>  <br>  Jesus uses the title Son of God a lot in John's gospel, but also in other gospels at times.<br>  <br>  (Colossians 1:15 also definitive.)<br>  <br>  Also note a prophecy about his ascension - Daniel 7:13-14, has the Son of Man - a title Jesus frequently used for himself - ascending to the right hand of God [the Father] and then receiving service/worship from men of all nations. The Aramaic word for service/worship there is only ever used in the context of worship of God or gods; so it is implying Jesus is God, especially also since he receives an eternal kingdom in that prophecy.|`|BzGnuWs4aa	1.

AA12203324	Lent is a spritual preparation period for the celebration of Easter in the Christian faith.  It developed slowly in the Middle Ages, from a few days to a clearly defined season at the tail end of winter, when many root cellars were getting bare anyway.  The model for Lent was Christ's 40-day ordeal in the desert.  A Christian was to practice spiritual exercises such as prayer and fasting, or avoiding common pleasures for the sake of ascetic purification and contemplation of the state of one's spiritual progress.  It is believed that by doing so, one can better appreciate the significance of the Passion, Death and Resurrection of Jesus.<br>  <br>  Catholics are required to observe a modified fast and abstain from land-based meat on Ash Wednesday and Good Friday.  Other Christians may observe it as they wish.|`|eAMq1iBWaa	I lent my brother ten bucks and he hasn't paid me back yet<br>  <br>  :-(|`|806025c44dd8e27b6c1d544348b087c0aa	Lent is the season that comes before Easter.  It starts on Ash Wednesday and runs through Saturday the night before Easter.  Historically it was a time to fast, pray, and give money to the poor as part of a person's spiritual development and responsibility.  Now it has evolved more into a time of reflection as well as penitence -- a time we can use to draw closer to Jesus and become more like him.<br>  <br>  You can give something up for Lent -- such as a luxury you enjoy, like Starbucks, or chocolate.  Some people would give the money they would have spent on those to the poor.  OR you could use the time to add something to strengthen your faith, such as a daily devotional, prayer or reading the Bible.<br>  <br>  Part of the practices you might do could depend upon the denomination to which you belong.|`|93r3nCM1aa	Lent is the 40 days of fasting before Easter, symbolic of Jesus's days in the desert.<br>  <br>  It starts next week, after Ash Wednesday.

You know why|`|D9lMg7A2aa	You only added 'in origin' because you had to. People would laugh at you if you had said 'in fact' -- which shows what the Jewish Bible taught from the beginning, that the very same thing can be an honor to the One God OR an idol  Here are two examples :    NEHUSHTAN  King Hezekiah instituted a religious iconoclastic reform and destroyed the Nehustan (2 Kings 18:4). It is identified with the bronze snake mentioned in the biblical Book of Numbers, which was said to have been used by Moses to cure the Israelites from snake bites.    EPHOD OF GIDEON   Judges 8:27  Gideon made it into an ephod, and placed it in his city, Ophrah, and all Israel played the harlot with it there, so that it became a snare to Gideon and his household.

No one new Jesus birthday for a fact so they celebrated at a time of year when folks didn't have much else to do and already had a celebration of the winter solstice.    You are entitled to your own beliefs in the same way Christians are entitled to theirs.  They are equally valid.  A better question would be why folks who already had these beliefs you speak of were so ready to embrace Christianity.  While there may have been some instances of coercion, most were eager and willing to accept its premises.|`|azY3Qmjdaa	you are correct, but just the same, a little behind the times... i agree with the paganism being incorporated into Christianity, and i am against it, that is the reason i abandoned the catholic church...     I respect your research, and i wish Catholics had the same curiosity about their own beliefs and traditions...    This does not deter me from believing that Jesus Christ died for my sins. I am still very much loyal to God, but the difference is i am more aware of the mistake made by many Christians in our history.|`|bTA5ndeMaa	Some 'Christians'     Others have not permitted leaven to foul their bread.

Look into it deep enough and there is in fact virtually nothing original in Christianity at all.|`|ePv45ad6aa	You are absolutely right!  Today's Christians, and for that matter ever since the disbursement of the Israelites from Israel, they have incorporated pagan festivals and traditions into their own.  Which is directly going against YAHWEH's will to not learn the way of the heathen and worship HIM as they worship their gods.  True Believers of YAHWEH's word have there appointed feasts and festivals which are given by YAH to HIS people to do.  The "church" has been lied to and given up to pagan gods unknowingly on their part.

GMFXD1ENaa	Hmmm... it depends. There are many ways of interpreting the Torah, depending on the predominant ideas of the branch of Judaism with which one most closely identifies, as well as on personal opinion. Tradition is discussed extensively in the Talmud, which is based on rabbinical interpretations of the Torah. As you can see, interpretation has a definite presence in Judaism. :-)|`|7vh5fOeRaa	Just as with anything based on religion and culture, the answer to this question would be different based on the specific Jewish group it was posed to.<br>  <br>  For example... the Hassidic and Orthodox Jews view the Torah as the unquestioned Word of God.  Their traditions would closely adhere to the Torah, word-for-word.<br>  <br>  Reform Jews, on the other hand, view the Torah as a collection of teachings and parables and don't believe it is to be followed word-for-word.  Their traditions use the Torah as a guide, but will also be heavily influenced by their surrounding culture and modern influences.<br>  <br>  The best example I can give you are the laws of Kashrut; the dietary laws associated with "keeping Kosher."  Orthodox Jews will follow these laws strictly, to the point that they will keep seperate sets of dishes, seperate sinks and dishwasher, etc.. in order not to mix milk with meat.  An Orthodox Jew would never eat bacon or a cheeseburger.  Refrom Jews such as myself will follow the laws of Kashrut on certain occasions, such as the high holidays.  But on normal days we are just as happy as the next person to enjoy a good cheeseburger or an order of shrimp.  Same set of laws, just a different level of interpretation of the "strictness" of the Torah.<br>  <br>  As a Reform Jew, I know that there are ways of interpreting the Torah that differ from the ways my more Orthodox brothers and sisters will interpret Torah.  Still, you will find a great deal of similarities in beliefs and celebration... it is just the level to which we adhere to the Word that will vary.<br>  <br>  The Talmud, as opposed to the Torah, is NOT the Word of God... it is a scholarly examination of the Torah and its traditions and laws that was written by Rabbis based on their interpretations of the Torah.  There are many such books in this vein:  The Talmud, the Midrash, the Mishna...  so the Talmud is of human origin and is not considered Holy in the way the Torah is.|`|B0GujA9Aaa	Jewish tradition is more or less the study of the Torah (the Talmud is a guide to understanding some issues that takes place in the Torah, but the Talmud IS NOT considered the divine word of G-d, just a guide). <br>  <br>  And a lot of Jewish tradition is based on rituals that we observe during our holidays and our daily lives. <br>  <br>  I have starred this question for my contacts. They should be able to give a better definition on Jewish tradition than I can give.|`|CmHLKKODaa	I Wonder !|`|AA12245463	No.  Our traditions come directly from the Torah and Talmud.<br>  .
bc1cdc0543b28607a5324cf5017d42daaa	I don't think the Bible is 100% real.

You can't hide the truth from God.  Every person will have to answer to Him for what they have done.|`|zZxX5PXBaa	severina is right. The passage in Corinthians is addressing the situation where someone has converted to Christianity and their partner basically says 'Right, I don't want to be married to you any more, I'm divorcing you'. Clearly that would be a civil divorce, depending on the particular rules of the local jurisdiction. The Christian partner wouldn't have much choice in that, as far as the civil law was concerned, which Paul accepts. But he says, if the unconverted partner wants to stay in the marriage, you should stay with the marriage, because that could lead to the unconverted partner being converted, which is something you see happening to this day.    There's no contradiction at all then, since both passages are saying that, wherever possible, only death should end a marriage. They're just very different passages addressing very different issues; our relationship with the law in Romans, and our relationship with an unconverted partner in Corinthians.|`|4807230affa1ab91b912bc7830a4b01baa	People tend to read these verses backwards, "and she (non-believer) be pleased to dwell with him (believer)," "and if he (non-believer) be pleased to dwell with her (believer)." Paul is confirming what is said in your previously quoted verse. If the non-believer is not pleased to live with the believer that would be abandonment. The fact that you are married to a non-believer is not an excuse for divorce as long as that non-believer is willing to continue to be married.|`|uFAoq4idaa	In Romans 7:2-3 The marriage is between the believers. So each of them are bound under the law of marriage.   In 1st Corinthians 7:12-15 The marriage is between a believer and unbeliever. So only the believer is bound by the law of marriage. The unbeliever is unbounded. She or he is free to choice if she or he will abide with the law of marriage. God must have put these in the mind of Paul in order that people might not think that He is a so called  a dictator. God can only dictate His own people if they are willing to follow Him. There is still an "if" because God wants us to be wholeheartedly submissive to Him not that because we are forced to do so. He wants our 100% devotion and obedience.|`|VHwM54iUaa	Paul was approaching the issue from the viewpoint of the Old Testament.  Moses said that the reason why God would allow divorce was the people were stubborn and not wanting to honor their marriages.  And the only grounds that he could allow divorce was if one committed adultery.  The basic message was that marriage is a COVENANT that should be honored and KEPT.  No excuses.    Being unequally yoked should be avoided if possible.  Of course, there are people that become Believers after being married.  I think that this is the issue that is being addressed.  To continue to try and make it work despite the differences.  Of course there may be extreme circumstances that would require one to get away from the other.      I have known christian women that testified of being married to abusive and negligent husbands.  They prayerfully tried to honor their marriages and make them work, but the husbands refused to change.  In most of the cases the husband ended up leaving the wife.  But from the sound of it, instead of being abandoned, it was like being set free.  Some tried to fight for their marriage because they surely still loved their husbands.  But they all had to let them go.    The only contradiction that I can see in this is that if the couple divorce they would be considered adulterers if they remarried.  And how can that be acceptable?  Yet again it is the issue with people being stubborn.  Accept in this case it may be that the unbelieving spouse may try to get the believing one to sin against God (while still married).|`|AA10287238	It doesn't say to leave your spouse if they are an unbeliever. It says to stay with them. Only the unbeliever can leave.

Elle doit voir un professionnel, et avec le temps, l'isolement va cesser. Fais attention de raconter ce qui se passe a ses parents, si elle ne le fait pas elle-meme, parce qu'ils sont ses parents, et ils compendront.

x7qtyglzaa	"A" goes before all words that begin with consonants.        * a cat      * a dog      * a purple onion      * a buffalo      * a big apple    with one exception: Use an before unsounded h.        * an honorable peace      * an honest error    "An" goes before all words that begin with vowels:        * an apricot      * an egg      * an Indian      * an orbit      * an uprising|`|WVPYem5Vaa	You use "an" when the word following it starts with a vowel sound. Typical words would be "American", "arm" and "end", but also words like "hour" and "honour", because the starting "h" is silent and the word starts with a vowel sound.    You use "a" when a word starts with a consonant sound. Words such as "word" and "year" are examples, but also words like "university" and "European", because they are pronounced with a "yu" sound at the start and therefore sound more like consonants.    Hope that helps!|`|GEfUTyi8aa	the simplest way to remember this is use "an" before a vowel such as " I was in the market and I bought an apple"  you wouldnt say " I bought a apple" you would say "an"    "there was a beautiful hat in the window" (no an because no vowel after a)  " there was an ant in the window"  "there was an elephant, there is an elephant"  " there is an ostrich"  " there was an umbrella on the stairs"  " I saw an ice sculpture today"  " I saw a Yak" (y is not a vowel here so there is no an)      this is the simplest way to remember... use an before a vowel (aeiou)|`|vuDE5TPbaa	You use an when there is a vowel following.    For example:     A butterfly.  A dog.  A cat.    An Encyclopedia.  An Octopus.  An Oreo.    The an is used so two vowel sounds aren't together. Does that make sense?|`|IBZfDuYjaa	You use "a" before a word that begins with a consonant.  "A guitar" "A cat"    You use "an" before a word that begins with a vowel (a, e, i, o, u) - an apple, an egg, an ostrich    "y" which can sometimes be used as a vowel, works like a consonant in this case:  "a yo-yo"|`|bhpdlDOdaa	you us "a" when the following word has a cons-tent--which is any letter in the alphabet that is not a, e, i,o, u...like for example you would say'  a girl  a horse  a dog  for "an" it is only for words that start with a, e, i, o, or u...for example    an apple  an ear  an olive    simple right

My grandfather and my uncles and all the men would go out hunting for hours. It was the event. We children would build tunnels under the snow and forts waiting for them to return. My mom and grandmother would be cooking all those delicious warm filling foods. It was great after they came home and we all gathered together and ate dinner. After wards they would break out the hard stuff and sit by the cook stove. They would tell us all their hunting stories, that days and all the ones from years past...it wasn't long before we children where quite worn out and the warmth from the stove had us soundly sleeping, always one of us in grandpas arms .....gee, thanks for the memory......hope you get to enjoy the day how ever you choose to...:)
agwxFmITaa	You grow through each phase as best you can.  Newly married, young parents, parents of teenagers(help!) and all the things that occur in  life.  When the hard times hit you put your backs to the wall and hold hands.  You take the rough with the smooth.  And before you know it, you have a long shared history!  Like a little ethnic group!  You laugh more than you scowl.  You work hard in and outside the home.  Then, if you are lucky you can enjoy things together that you'd never have imagined you could have afforded right at the beginning.  And most importantly you make sure you still fancy each other!  There are too many marriages where that side slips away.|`|JGjpc7Itaa	We will be married 40 years in June.  My husband jokes that it has been 6 months happily.  It hasn't been easy, what commitment is?  We have give and take with me doing most of the giving.  I am fine with that.  I often make him think that things are his idea after I plant the seed.  It works for us.  I rarely argue with him because I have learned that even if I am, in his eyes I am rarely right.  Again, I let it ride and work it so that he eventually sees my point of view.  It works well for us and we are happy and have a lot of fun.    I even have him watching American Idol with me now!

We were lucky and found each other when we were mature enough to understand that you ignore the little things - and 90% of it is "little things".  You also have to look at the person you are going to marry and ask yourself "Can I live with this person exactly as they are right now?"  Yes, people change but you shouldn't go into the marriage expecting them to change to suit your tastes.  Respect for each other as individuals is crucial.  My husband and I are opposites on religion and politics but have the same core values - honesty, hard work, loyalty etc. and have never ridiculed the other person's beliefs or view point. Make time for each other and just because you are married doesn't mean you have to stop dating each other.  When we were really broke we would ask grandma to watch the kids for just an hour and go grab a cup of coffee together - some of our best dates were the simplest.|`|UBxKqdPwaa	By ignoring that he had another woman on the side.|`|b3h0ovgRaa	Hubby worked away from home every week so we only saw each other on weekends for many years.

There will be days and even years when you are miserable because of money problems, where you are living, the responsibilities of raising children, jobs, etc.  Stay put and keep going through the motions.  Those times of thinking you don't love him anymore are going to happen.  Then you will fall back in love with him again.  Respect each other, love each other and be faithful to your marriage vows.

8I9uduIiaa	Thank you for this kind post :)<br>  <br>  It's pretty impossible to ever find a 'reason' for anti semitism. It's an enduring hatred that, much like a virus, mutates according to the time and location in question.<br>  <br>  The two answers above mine actually illustrate this. The first one tries to argue that Jewish customs 'irritate' non Jews. But then why aren't the Amish hated? They too have numerous rules. Why aren't Scientologists loathed and persecuted? Or any group we could mention. Clearly being 'annoying' has nothing to do with it - Jews don't try and get NON Jews to observe our customs! So why WOULD it 'irritate' someone?<br>  <br>  Then you have the other post, and here we get far closer to the heart of the matter. The age-old, deadly myth that the 'jews killed jesus'. Two Popes and countless modern Christian theologians and leaders have publicly acknowledged that it was the Romans, yet still the hatred persists.<br>  <br>  Jesus was charged with sedition - it was a crime against ROME.<br>  Jesus was arrested and killed by crucifixion - a purely ROMAN method, and one banned in Judaism.<br>  <br>  The Romans killed another 250,000 Jews around that time - it is clear that Jesus was one among many. Many other young preachers and leaders of messianic groups were ALSO crucified.<br>  <br>  Nothing to do with the Jews!<br>  <br>  Yet the myth persists - as does the hatred.<br>  <br>  There is a very interesting article on the topic, at <a href="http://www.aish.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.aish.com</a>   - type in 'anti semitism' in the search bar. See what you make of it :)<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.ajewwithaview.wordpress.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.ajewwithaview.wordpress.com</a>|`|celVUtGeaa	mike63 is right thats why people don't like and i personally think he's full of **** Jewish people are some of the kindest i've ever met.|`|zmkTPwgoaa	Because they crucifide jesus and blamed it on the romans|`|3ae438759d1f82f0733d2a5dc01aba4daa	because their beliefs annoy us at times<br>  for eg:<br>  such as not being able to touch or use  anything electronic after a certain time and we have to oh idk , turn on the light switch or press the elevator button for them.<br>  <br>  but in general I do not have anything against jews, they have their own religion and we should just respect them.
rtFkwelQaa	The other term for it is the unpardonable sin.  The fact that your scared is a good thing.  It is an indication that you have not commited the unpardonable sin.  When the Bible talks about blasphemy of the Holy Spirit it means that when the Holy Spirit attempts to speak to your heart over and over again to get you to follow God's ways and you continually refuse, that's the unpardonable sin.  It's a continual refusal over time. Deep inside you know what's right, but you don't do it.<br>  <br>  Once you ask for forgivness, and follow the Spirit's leading you will not be in that situation.<br>  <br>  Blessings|`|bE1AuHORaa	Don't let anyone scare you. I'm certain if God exists, he'll not be pleased with people scaring his children. Sin is a made up concept to control our behaviour. As long as you do your best with your life, and try not to hurt others and are sorry for any mistakes you make, I'm sure God will be pleased with you. And even if he isn't, I'm sure you have nothing to fear because he is better than us.|`|QsbB6vkoaa	it's not literately unforgiving. it's just a way of saying that if you know the love of god and still blaspheme against him, it's a very serious thing.<br>  but a lot of the people in jesus day, blasphemed against god, because they didn't know the truth, but once they learned about him, and accepted to live by his norm, got forgiven.|`|ZrJ3sA0Haa	i dont know what it is.<br>  we were talking about unforgiven sins in my confirmation class and my teacher didnt really specify it.<br>  <br>  wow i wish i could remember what he said<br>  <br>  it doesnt let you go to heaven because it ruins love between you and god and the holy spirit is love.<br>  <br>  butt im not exactly sure.|`|lPQu5Uzpaa	But someone who has committed the unforgivable sin--the sin against the Holy Spirit--is a person who has said "no" over and over and over again to the personal calling of the Holy Spirit to a living faith in the Lord Jesus so that the Holy Spirit doesn't call that individual to faith and Christ any more. They become so hardened that they are no longer concerned about their soul or Christ at all.  By your question, it is obvious that this DOES NOT apply to you.<br>  <br>  Truly, "no one can call Jesus Lord [and really mean it] except by the Holy Spirit." God's Spirit will not always strive with human beings (Genesis 6:13); and when He ceases to strive with us, calling us to turn from our sins to a living faith in Jesus Christ and His Cross, when we no longer care, we have committed the unforgivable sin.<br>  <br>  BTW I did not write this but I hope it is useful to you.|`|KmULmT7Baa	Don't believe that.

The message of the Holy Spirit is that believing in Jesus alone for salvation, is the only way to get into heaven and to avoid being sent to eternal torment in hell. <br>  <br>  When you believe in Jesus alone for salvation, then you are forgiven all sins past, present, and future. But if a person dies without having believed in Jesus alone for salvation, then they are forgiven nothing, and are sent to eternal torment in hell. <br>  <br>  The only way to get into heaven and to avoid being sent to hell, is by believing that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for all our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead. Believe this and you will be in heaven and not hell, no matter what! :)|`|kNTP6HWbaa	Religion is just a system of beliefs that help ignorant people understand some of the more complex enigmas of our universe.

D4xmy588aa	Hanzalah (ra) and Jameelah (ra)     Hanzalah RA and Jamilah RA.  assalamu alaikum :)  bismillah.    i wanted to share with you guys excerpts from 'Muhammad: his life based on the earliest sources' by Martin Lings (Abu Bakr Siraj ad-Din). i specifically chose the story of Hanzalah RA and his wife Jamilah RA:    Chapter L: Preparations for Battle (Uhud):  ...After the prayer two men waited behind to speak to the Prophet, each having an urgent decision to make.One of them was Hanzalah, the son of the self-styled Abrahamist Abu'Amir, who was even now, unknown to his son, in the enemy camp below Uhud. It was Hanzalah's wedding day - a day which had been chosen weeks in advance. He was bethrothed to his cousin Jamilah, the daughter of Ibn Ubayy, and he was loth to postpone the marriage, yet determined to fight. The Prophet told him to celebrate his marriage and spend the night in Medina. There could be no fighting before sunrise, and Hanzalah would have ample time to join him on the battlefield early the next morning. He could find out by inquiry which way tthe army had passed.    the story carries over to the next chapter:    Chapter LI : The March to Uhud:  In Medina that night Hanzalah and Jamilah had consummated their marriage; and in her sleep, during the small hours, Jamilah had a dream in which she saw her husband standing at the outside of Heaven; and the door opened for him and he entered through it, whereupon it closed behind him. When she woke, she said to herself: "This is martyrdom." They performed their ablutions and prayed the dawn prayer together, after which he bade her farewell. But she clung to him, and would not let him go, and again he lay with her. Then he tore himself from her embrace, and not even staying to repeat his ablution, he put on his coat of mail, seized his weapons, and hastened from the house.    Hanzalah reached the camp and joined the ranks of the Army, and went off to fight in the Battle of Uhud:    Chapter LII: The Battle of Uhud:  ...Abu Sufyan narrowly escaped the sword of Hanzalah, who was fighting valiantly near the centre and who was about to cut him down, when a man of Layth came in from the side and thrust Hanzalah through with his spear, felling him to the ground and killing him outright with a second thrust.  The battle had gradually moved down the slope away from the Prophet as the Meccans were driven back towards the camp. He could no longer discern in any detail what was happening, though he could see that so far his men were winning the day. But now his attention was drawn upwards from the battle and his eyes were raised as one who watches the flight of the birds. After a moment he said to those beside him: "Your companion - he meant Hanzalah - "The Angels are washing him." And afterwards he said to Jamilah, as if seeking an explanation: ""I saw the Angels washing Hanzalah between heaven and earth with water from the clouds in vessels of silver." Then she told him of her dream, and how through fear of being late for battle, he had not made the ablution he would normally have made.    Later after the battle when the muslims were burying their dead, every person that came into contact with Hanzalah's body dared not to touch him. He lay there as the Angels had laid him, with his hair still wet with water upon the noon-dry earth. His beauty and peace were as a sign from heaven, to inform the rest of them of the condition of their martyred kinsmen.    subhanallah, a story resplendent with the sacrifices the sahaba RA made for Islam. subhanallah.    and Allah Almighty knows best.    sheik speare.    posted by sheikspeare at 1/28/2005 02:05:00 AM    (source: http://sheikspeare.blogspot.com/2005/01/...  and here is a pasto nasheed on it for those who can speak and understand pashto    http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=okBYyPF20u...|`|Kiv4D2aWaa	The Prophet sent 'Ali to Khalid to bring the Khumus (of the booty) and I hated Ali, and 'Ali had taken a bath (after a sexual act with a slave-girl from the Khumus).

Khalid bin Walid ( ra ).|`|f8dz0ffFaa	Hazrat Abu Zar's real name was Jandab ibn Junadah ibn Sakan, better known as Abu Dhar al-Ghaffari, or Abu Thar al-Ghaffari. Hazrat Abu Zar's Kunniya was Abu Zar, which is because his eldest son was named Zar (this word in Arabic means 'fragrance'). By one estimate, Abu Zar was born in 568 AD, which means Abu Zar was two years older than the Prophet Muhammad (saw).    Hazrat Abu Zar Ghaffari (Radhiallahu Anhu / May God be pleased with him) had belonged to an Arab tribe by the name of Ghaffar, hence his last name.    Abu Zar was most unhappy about the custom of Idol-worship that was rampant in Arabia of the 7th century. He had already believed in a Supreme God and he would spend most of his time reflecting on that.    As news of the Prophet's mission spread in Arabia, it also arrived in the tribe of Ghafaar. Abu Zar heard of it. It was something that he himself had been thinking about. He sent his brother to go to Hijaz, find out about the new message and report back. His brother did that. Abu Zar found the news and the report from his brother encouraging.    Hazrat Abu Zar Ghaffari (Radhiallahu Anhu) then decided to meet with the Prophet Muhammad (saw) personally. This was the time when Islam had only collected a handful of converts. He was first met with Imam Ali bin Abi Talib who introduced him to his own father Abu Talib. Abu Talib took him to Hazrat Hamza. After a thorough security check, Abu Zar was finally introduced to the Prophet Muhammad (saw).    It is said that Abu Zar said Salam to the Prophet Muhammad (saw). That was long before the Islamic Salam was introduced into the early Muslim culture of Arabia. Abu Zar was taken by the charm, the majesty and the kindness of the Prophet Muhammad (saw). He said his Shahada (I bear witness that there is no god but Allah and Mohammad is His Servant and Messenger) and accepted Islam, so did his brother.    Hazrat Abu Zar Ghaffari (Radhiallahu Anhu) hung around in Makkah for few days. During those few days he made a couple of speeches in the temple grounds. He was immediately subdued by the infidels and actually was beaten up badly. Al-Abbas ibn Abdul Mutalib, the uncle of the Prophet Muhammad (saw) came to his rescue both times and the incidents were reported to the Prophet Muhammad (saw). Prophet Muhammad (saw) called him and advised him to go back to his tribe of Ghaffar and stay there until he (Prophet Muhammad (saw)) goes to Yathrib (Madina) and Muslims had established themselves. Hence Abu Zar went back home and under the influence of both sons, their mother also accepted Islam.    Hazrat Abu Zar Ghaffari (Radhiallahu Anhu) has had the reputation of being an outspoken orator and he always spoke his mind whatever the consequences. He and his brother began speaking about their new faith among his tribesmen. Immediately there was resentment against Abu Zar and his brother among the young men of the tribe. Finally the issue was reported to the chief of the tribe. Abu Zar had a lot of respect in the tribe. However, when the chief called him and his brother, they both had to appear before him. He questioned Abu Zar and his brother about the trouble that both of them had started. Abu Zar pleaded his case with strength of reason but with due respect and compassion. The chief reflected on what Abu Zar had said and after some reflection he announced his own Islam. A great number of the young men also accepted Islam after that turn of events. Abu Zar continued to teach Islam to his people.    Hazrat Abu Zar Ghaffari (Radhiallahu Anhu) is reported to be the fourth Muslim in chronological order. He had the exclusive honour to call the Prophet Muhammad (saw) as Ya Habibi (my dear friend), while everybody else could only address him as Ya Rasool Allah. Abu Zar finally arrived in Madina after the Battle of Ahzab / Battle of the Trench (5th year of Hijra) and spent the rest of the days in the company of the Prophet Muhammad (saw).    During those few years in Madina, Abu Zar became very friendly with Imam Ali bin Abi Talib. The four people named Salman al-Farsi, Abu Zar Ghaffari, Miqdad bin Aswad and Ammar Yasir were always seen in the company of Imam Ali bin Abi Talib. They came to be known as the Shia.    In the 9th year of Hijra, the Prophet Muhammad (saw) prepared a large contingent to confront the Romans and moved out towards Tabuk. Imam Ali bin Abi Talib was appointed the administrator of Madina. Abu Zar also accompanied the Prophet Muhammad (saw). However, at that time, he had a very weak and old camel. It could not keep up with the rest of the group. Finally, when he was left behind by a great distance, he left the camel, took a back-pack and decided to walk. Finally, people saw Abu Zar coming and they reported to the Prophet Muhammad (saw) that Abu Zar was coming on foot. The Prophet Muhammad (saw) looked at him and said: "This is Abu Zar, my companion (Sahabi). He is walking alone, he will live alone, and one day, die alone.

The earliest Muslims suffered terrible torments at the hands of the Quraysh, the ruling tribe of Makkah. Those who emigrated from Makkah left behind their homes and families, even all their worldly possessions, to follow the call of Islam. Thus we owe a great deal to the Companions of the Prophet (saws), and we honor and respect them all.  ______________________________________...

His daily meal used to be a handful of dates. He lived a contented life, always spoke the truth and he was firm in his faith.    Once someone asked him that he was always seen in one pair of clothes. Abu Zar replied: Yes, I had another pair of clothes but I saw some one who needed it more than I did. How could I keep a second pair of clothes while there was another person who did not have even one? That one episode speaks volumes of the thinking of Abu Zar.    Hazrat Abu Zar Ghaffari (Radhiallahu Anhu) seems to have kept a very low profile after the passing of our Prophet Muhammad (saw) and during the first two Caliphates of both Abu Bakr and Umar ibn Khattab.    During the third Caliphate of Uthman ibn Affan, things moved from good to bad and from bad to worse. Uthman refused to take advice from his well-wishers such as Imam Ali bin Abi Talib and Abdur-Rahman bin Awf.    When Uthman ibn Affan began misappropriating the public treasury for his own use and began distributing it lavishly on his cousins and in-laws, Abu Zar become active again and began reacting to it.    Uthman ibn Affan was very displeased about that. When Abu Zar's activities became unbearable for him, Uthman ibn Affan ordered a complete boycott of Abu Zar. No one was allowed to speak to him in the Masjid, nobody was allowed to visit him or invite him to his place.    Abu Zar's voice, in spite of all that, was hard to silence. When Uthman ibn Affan was not able to silence Abu Zar then, he ordered Abu Zar to be transported to Muawiyah in Damascus, Syria.    What Abu Zar saw in Damascus was even worse. People were building palaces for themselves and living in luxury. He realized that all that was a far cry from the Islamic heritage that the Prophet Muhammad (saw) had given to the community. He built a hut out of blankets on the outskirts of the city and began living in that with his family.    One day Abu Zar passed by the location where Muawiyah was having his Green Palace built. He went upto Muawiyah and said: "O Muawiyah, if you are spending Allah's wealth in this project, you are being dishonest because you are embezzling Allah's wealth; if this is being built of your personal wealth then it is disgusting extravagance." Muawiyah could not say a word in reply.    Abu Zar then proceeded to the central mosque. He stood among the people and delivered a speech. People began to gather round Abu Zar and listen to his discourses. The poor and the dispossessed were attracted to him and the rich were scared of him.    A man named Habib bin Muslim Fehri saw all this and said to himself: This is a big Fitna. He then went up to Muawiyah and said: "If you wish to continue to rule over Syria, do something about Abu Zar, otherwise he will bring a revolution here."    Muawiyah was greatly perturbed. He considered it one of his great failures if he could not control one old 'fool' such as Abu Zar. First Muawiyah tried to silence Abu Zar by bribing him. He sent three hundred Dinar to Abu Zar. He immediately returned it to him saying: "I do not need your money."    As Abu Zar was openly criticizing Muawiyah by name in the mosque, one person bent over and whispered in his ear: "What are you saying against the ruler? Be afraid of his wrath." Abu Zar turned to him and said:" My friend (meaning the Prophet Muhammad (saw)) had advised me to speak the truth at all times even if it is bitter, and not to be afraid of any critic in truth's path. I pray to Allah: O Allah, I ask your protection against cowardice, save me from being miserly, I do not wish for long life, I ask Allah's forgiveness from this world and the Hellfire in the other world|`|vMAEeh66aa	Malik Al-Ashtar R.A ????? ???? ????

P1jSof68aa	Since no one has fully answered this question lets answer it using the Bible. First, we must understand John as an author. You see when John describes a vision he always uses this specific method: whenever he describes a vision, if youll notice, in the entire book of Revelation John always hears something, then he describes what he heard, and then he sees. For example, in Johns vision of Christ:    I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day, and HEARD behind me a great voice, as of a trumpet, Saying, I am Alpha and Omega, the first and the last: and, What thou seest, write in a book, and send it unto the seven churches which are in Asia; unto Ephesus, and unto Smyrna, and unto Pergamos, and unto Thyatira, and unto Sardis, and unto Philadelphia, and unto Laodicea.   Revelation 1:10, 11.    Now watch what happens.     And I turned to SEE the voice that spake with me. And being turned, I SAW seven golden candlesticks; Revelation 1:12.    Heres another example.     After this I looked, and, behold, a door was opened in heaven: and the first voice which I HEARD was as it were of a trumpet talking with me; which said, Come up hither, and I will shew thee things which must be hereafter.   Revelation 4:1.    Again, John hears the angle and then the angel shows him things which must be hereafter.    And immediately I was in the spirit: and, BEHOLD, a throne was set in heaven, and one sat on the throne. Revelation 4:2.    Heres an example from Revelation 6:      And I HEARD a voice in the midst of the four beasts say, A measure of wheat for a penny, and three measures of barley for a penny; and see thou hurt not the oil and the wine. And when he had opened the fourth seal, I HEARD the voice of the fourth beast say, Come and see.   Revelation 6:6, 7.     Again, first he hears and now he is going to see.    And I LOOKED, and BEHOLD a pale horse: and his name that sat on him was Death, and Hell followed with him. And power was given unto them over the fourth part of the earth, to kill with sword, and with hunger, and with death, and with the beasts of the earth.   Revelation 6:8    John does this dozens of times. That is just his style. Now, he also does this in Revelation 7, in respect to your question:     And I HEARD the number of them which were sealed: and there were sealed an hundred and forty and four thousand of all the tribes of the children of Israel. Revelation 7:4     Now lets ask ourselves a question: does John see the 144,000? Lets read it again.    And I HEARD the number of them which were sealed: and there were sealed an hundred and forty and four thousand of all the tribes of the children of Israel. Revelation 7:4     No John does not see them yet. In verse 4 he does not see them, he only hears them. And in verses 5-8, he is describing what he heard. And now finally in verse 9, he sees what he heard.     After this I BEHELD, and, lo, a great multitude, which no man could number, of all nations, and kindreds, and people, and tongues, stood before the throne, and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes, and palms in their hands;   Revelation 7:9.     Therefore, to answer your question, yes the people in Revelation 7:4 and 7:9 are the same group of people. You just have to get past Johns style to understand this. John always "hears" and then se "sees."  Furthermore, this is why the 144,000 are not a literal number. John says that the the multitude that he saw (the 144,000) were a group which no man could number If the 144,000 are an actual, literal number, then John wouldnt have said it was a great multitude, which no man could number    Therefore, the number 144,000 must be symbolic and must be a far greater number. We just have to let the Bible speak. I hope the Bible answered your question.    GOD Bless.        p.s. If you want to know exactly who the 144,000 are then I would be happy to let the Bible speak on that.|`|9mLjDa5kaa	The 144,000 are Jewish evangelists in the future tribulation period.

In this case, these two groups are obviously and definitely different.    Those who try to wave the magic "figurative" wand over this passage are usually Amillennialists and Replacement Theologians who are trying to get rid of a literal return of God's attention to the Jewish people (Rom. 11:25) as it was before Acts 8.    The passage is pretty straight forward.  Anyone who is trying to make the passage in Rev. 7 mean something other than it says is trying to maintain belief in something that isn't scriptural.|`|3aVxJYf6aa	144,000 are humans jews and gentiles redeem from earth ...according to Revelation 14 verse 3    3  And they are singing as if a new song before the throne and before the four living creatures and the elders; and no one was able to master that song but the hundred and forty-four thousand, who have been bought from the earth.    the rest ....the great crowd are the meek Jesus  said in Matthew 5 verse 5 that will inherit the earth|`|AA11707311	The 144K are Jews, verse 9 talks of people of all nations, a great multitude.  They are obviously different, but the same before God.|`|bTA5ndeMaa	Yes and No!    Please read carefully verse four, since you didn't quote it.    "4 And I heard the number of the sealed, a hundred and forty-four thousand, sealed out of every tribe of the sons of Israel:"    What we see is that both groups are Israel, spiritual Israel since the verse says that the 144,00 are sealed out of Israel.    In this way they are as Jesus said one flock, one people.  All of them being of Israel spiritual are under his New Covenant having through this covenant been brought into the covenant for his blood that forgives sins (Matt 26:28) and received the baptism for forgiveness of sins. (Acts 2:38)    In this way through "the blood of sprinkling which speaks in a better way than Abel's blood" (Heb 12:24), we see that like in Lev 16:15,16, a forgiveness is obtained by this new covenant whose blood so to say is sprinkled upon us all who receive forgiveness by it.      We can therefore understand that all Israel which is included in the New Covenant also must partake of these emblems until Christ arrives.  As Paul says in Romans, all of God's children are led by God's spirit, and most certainly all Christians must be led by God's spirit so as not to be illegitimate children of God.    In Isaiah 66:21, it is shown that these 144,000 of these are to become priests (21 And I will also take of them for priests and for Levites, saith Jehovah. ) while the rest, the great crowd, then is the survivors of Armageddon that at this moment make up the commoners of spiritual Israel.  To these shall of course be added those who are resurrected later on earth.

If you have believed and trusted that the Lord Jesus Christ died for your sins then you are going into God's heaven. There are thrones, dominions, principalities and powers in heaven just like there are on the earth. Colossians 1: 16 For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him: In heaven there God's Holy Angels, so many that they can't be numbered.

I have a really nice Sephardic Artscroll Siddur which was a gift from my father.  I also have the Siddur (silver cover with an engraving of the tribes of Yisrael), that my grandfather gave him. :)    This Siddur is very special to me, and using it at any opportunity is always a nice feeling.  Now that I have a daughter of my own, I hope to partake in this special family tradition, and give my daughter a Siddur that she would love and appreciate.

JKKpwmBFaa	The Nazis violated international law. Remember the Nuremberg trials?|`|AA11849917	In the words of Peter, "I must obey God rather than man."    Obedience to God comes first and foremost, and then, as long as man's laws do not conflict with or contradict God's laws, then we are under obligation to obey man's laws.    For instance, state laws give us a speed limit on the highways that we are not to exceed.  The speed limit laws in no way conflict with any Biblical laws, so there is no reason why we shouldn't obey the speed limits set up by each state.    On the other hand, the Bible says "Thou shalt not commit murder."  If the government is telling us to kill this person or that, then I must obey God first.      This is only common sense.  I don't see how ANY body who loves God could be so foolish as to think that man-made laws are higher than the laws God gave us!    The military is a different matter completely.  One does not join the military for the sake of killing.  Killing may occur, but not killing the innocent, like Hamas does, or the terrorists who strap bombs on their chest, then go into crowded areas like the British subway, then kill themselves along with many innocent people, including women and children!  The purpose of the military is to serve and protect.  If it weren't for the military, you would be a slave right now to whatever government decides to overthrow ours!    Remember, "Freedom isn't free".  World Wars I and II both cost us many lives.  But if we had NOT entered the war, what would the world be like today?|`|E9chZY74aa	God's law supersedes that government.

Contrary things cannot co-exist in peace,  and mixing contrary things makes an oxy-moron;  So pick only one of Law vs Grace for what God is:  Law: I will forget you & I will forsake you: Enmity  Grace: I will never leave nor forsake you: Friend  Christ is our peace who abolished the law(enmity)|`|Wxj4yEgFaa	Most did what they were told or their families were killed.  And, there were some who still hid Jews etc and risked their own lives.|`|18f23c8e100103ef2ddb3c61fe1e09e3aa	I disagree with the answer that someone gave out of Romans.  That law is referring to JEWISH law.  That law is the law that Jesus fulfilled; so, that we can live by and be justified by faith.      I actually don't know of any scripture per se that frees us from man's law.  With that said, however, I will say that common sense must prevail in such a question.  Would any reasonable person believe that God would EVER put man's law above His own sense and expression of right and wrong?  So, for example, God says for us not to murder.  Then you say, well ... what if the law tells us to murder?  I'm saying to you, "What do you think?!  Duh!"  God's word trumps man's law everytime.      As for Christians resisting the Nazi machine, I'm not certain that's a fair question.  I mean, didn't the Jews largely go along with their own destruction too?  The Nazis took over, oppressed, led by fear, intimidation, and murder.  A Christian could have easily thought: If I resist then I'm dead.  How is my murder going to help the Jews?  So, I don't think their was any enthusiastic cooperation with Hitler's plan, but yes, Christians were intimidated and I guess to some degree did aid Hitler, if for no other reason, then by not resisting him.    Lord knows how many Christians ACTIVELY resisted Hitler.  But one famous family that did was the Ten Boom family.  Read Correy Ten Boom's story of how her Christian family was destroyed for trying to help the Jews.  Her book is called The Hiding Place.

2c27e0995a08bf926614dc941ff77a61aa	From what I've learned in my years is that people go to hell because they have not accepted God, and do not believe in him, and ask for his forgiveness in there lives for there sins.  I'm not a totally religious person but I know to give a shout out to the man upstairs when times are good and when they are bad.|`|f582421fab21195960a57126a91727beaa	people have free will. they don't have to accept Jesus , Christianity and all that jazz. So they don't accept god. Thus they shouldn't be 'forced' to spend all eternity with a god they don't worship... 'cause that'd suck. they might not go to hell. Bible just says they won't be 'with god'. so they might just die and rot.|`|Fot1B738aa	Yes we were but that was the sins before that and Those were the sins of the biblical days I think. Okay so you know when you comet a sin you always ask for forgiveness? Ya so sometimes Like If you stole a pepsi from Waly mart (not saying you did just using as example). and you lied about it and said no I didn't steel anything, that's one lie. Then they ask u where were you on so n so date of course being human your not going to say Waly mart, that's 2 lies. Then they ask you where you got the pepsi in your car you say a friend or at home, that's 3 lies and you see when you lie once you have to cover up every other lie until you finally end up telling on yourself becuz you forgot the first lie. and you will never remember to ask for forgivness for all of those lies and you already broke 2 of the commandments so yea! I hope i helped you on your confusesion|`|cd2etz5Raa	John 14:6 (NIV)    Jesus answered, "I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me."    - - -    One must accept the gift before they can open it.     Christ's sacrifice and the salvation He offers us are gifts - the biggest gifts we can ask for, and He is openly offering them to us. But it's like sitting with someone on Christmas morning. They offer you a gift, wrapped neatly and whatnot, but if you say something like, "No thanks, I don't want it." then you can't open it. It's the same with salvation.    Also, Christ died so that our sin could be taken away - sin being what was keeping us from Him all along. But, it won't be taken away until we ask for forgiveness, and accept Christ into our hearts. It's like we're in prison, with our cell door wide open, but there are chains around our legs. We have the key (Christ being the key) to unlock our chains, but it's up to us to do it.     I hope this helped you understand a little better.  Take care!!! :)|`|AA11867839	You must use your intelligence and think about what religion is.   If it had any real substance their would only be  world religion. However that is not the case. We have many religions in this world and each one demands belief in it.   The most Intelligent way is to know there is the Spirit we call God. No human can even begin to understand the Spirit. Religion is a man-made thing invented to make money. It is a good money maker too.  You will be surprised at how you can come to peace with yourself by forgetting human invented religions and began praying directly to the Spirit.

You have to have Jesus and God in your heart and have true faith.  Then can you only truly be saved.  If you continue to sin, then you do not have Him in your heart.  The devil makes us sin and in order to refuse the devil we have to be strong enough to stand up to him and say that Jesus is in our heart and a part of our soul and that the devil will never penetrate that faith we have.  That's what i think and that's how i interpret what the bible says.|`|H7L66ynJaa	You only get your sins forgiven under the following circumstances:  1 You believe with all your heart and soul and might that Jesus is your Savior  2 You believe Jesus can forgive sins  3 You confess your sins to Jesus  4 You repent of your sins and vow to try not to do them again.|`|AA11232725	John 3:16  For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.  17  For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through Him might be saved.  18  "He who believes in Him is not condemned; but he who does not believe is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.      19  And this is the condemnation, that the light has come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.  20  For everyone practicing evil hates the light and does not come to the light, lest his deeds should be exposed.  21  But he who does the truth comes to the light, that his deeds may be clearly seen, that they have been done in God."|`|IqqaA2wIaa	cuz it isnt automatic...it takes willingness and repentance....hell is graves.....no we werent....unless we repent|`|7NugugsDaa	When Jesus comes back he will be the judge for those on earth in heaven in hell and the ones that have died.

If they sinned again, they would have to do another sacrifice offering. The animals were seen as innocent, since they have no knowledge of right and wrong.    When Christ came, he died for our sins. He KNEW the difference between right and wrong, and yet he chose to NOT sin. He stayed pure.    So when we sin now, we can call on the sacrifice of Christ. If we sin, we are once again breaking God's command. However, we can repent, and call upon the sacrifice of Jesus, and God will forgive us.|`|9mLjDa5kaa	You must believe to be saved.

Be happy.|`|3aVxJYf6aa	Ok..The original sin created a very critical problem for mankind. Adam began life as a perfect human. Therefore, his children could have enjoyed perfect everlasting life. However, Adam sinned before he fathered any children. The entire human race was still in his loins when he received the sentence: "In the sweat of your face you will eat bread until you return to the ground, for out of it you were taken. For dust you are and to dust you will return." (Genesis 3:19) So when Adam sinned and began to die as God said he would, all mankind was sentenced to death along with him.    "That is not fair,".. someone might say. "We did not choose to disobey GodAdam did. Why should we lose our prospect for everlasting life and happiness?" We know that if a court of law were to put a son in prison because his father had stolen a car, the son could rightly complain: "That is not just! I did not do anything wrong."Deuteronomy 24:16.    Adam's death had no value; he deserved to die for his sin. Jesus' death, however, had great value because he died in a sinless state. Jehovah God could accept the value of Jesus' perfect life as a ransom for obedient descendants of sinful Adam. And the value of Jesus' sacrifice does not stop at paying for our past sins. If it did, we would have no future. Being conceived in sin, we are bound to err again. (Psalm 51:5) How grateful we can be that Jesus' death makes provision for us to gain the perfection that Jehovah originally intended for the offspring of Adam and Eve!    Adam can be likened to a father who died and left us in such deep financial debt (sin) that there is no possible way for us to get out of debt. On the other hand, Jesus is like a good father who died and left us a rich inheritance that not only frees us from the enormous debt that Adam burdened us with but also provides enough for us to live on eternally. Jesus' death is not simply a cancellation of past sins; it is also a wonderful provision for our future.|`|64d77l4qaa	Sins were forgiven, but you have to believe and accept that they were forgiven for them to actually be forgiven.

People go to hell and are separated from GOD for the main reason that they REJECT the mercy, grace, and atonement offered by GOD thru His Son, Jesus Christ.

Remember the group of people who shouted, "we will NOT have THIS MAN to be Lord over us!!!" - that's the group that ends up in hell.

I used to be a devout Christian, but the confusion that you're experience right now drove me away.  The wages of sin is death, right? at least that's how I see the scriptures. So, death itself is said to be our punishment--and that's straight from the bible. We go to Hell because that's how whomever is telling you is interpreting the Bible. They're misinterpreting the scripture. Here's another scripture that tells you exactly what happens at death:The bible says that the dead are conscious of nothing at all, so then can you torment some one in a burning hell forever, if they are unconscious? For the living know they will die; but the dead do not know anything, nor have they any longer a reward, for their memory is forgotten. (Ecclesiastes 9:5) When you die, you just die. Or does that verse mean something else?    These scriptures are not necessarily to written in black and white, and the reason I say this is because someone else will interpret it differently and make into something else. I guess the conclusion I came to as a 34 year old ex-Emmaus Bible College student is that it's not really important to know the specifics about things like this. My question had more to do with how I can be a better person--PERIOD. Knowing specifics of the BIBLE, or being able to quote scripture means nothing. It's like fasting and announcing it to everyone so that they can see how much of a " Christian" you are. It's just a big show.  Desert Rose is getting his info. from the watch tower. As an inactive Jehovah's witness I do agree with a lot of what they teach----this subject in particular.  I don't believe it because of it being the truth, but because they follow the bible the closest of all Christian religions. They do know their scripture and they don't add their own twist on most things--this subject is one that they do interpret correctly.|`|B12rW6Dsaa	ACTUALLY JESUS HUMAN SOUL WAS SACRIFIED TO REPLACE THE ONLY OTHER PURE MAN CREATED,ADAM.BLOOD IS OUR LIFE FORCE AND ONES SOUL PERFECT PURE  BLOOD WAS ONLY WAY EVEN THE SCALES SO TO SPEAK.THE SINS OF OUR FOREFATHERS WAS FORGIVEN AND WE WERE WASHED ANEW IN GODS MIND AS A WHOLE AND TO BE TAUGHT AGAIN BY THE NEW TEACHER,THE MESSIAH.NO ONE GOES TO HELL IT DOES NOT EXIST IT IS AN ANCIENT MISINTERPRETATION OF SCRIPTURE BY MEN  EASILY MORE SUPERSTITIOUS THAN LEARNED IN all BOOKS OF THE WORD.IN MY MIND THE WORD PROBABLY ONLY EXISTED IN THE WORD ITSELF AND THAT IS THE REAL MIRACLE OF THE WORD.ITS EXISTENCE KNOWING THE REAL HISTORY OF HEBREW AND GREEK SCRIPTURES.

JESUS IS NOT DEAD:  Ok, we know we don't create each other and we don't come to this world from nowhere because when we die we must be going somewhere as well, hence there must be God, if there were many Gods, they would have fought over what to be created and what not to be, probably over who to die and who to live at the same time... so it's gotta be one God... if that God created us then there must be a reason... could we figure it out on our own? God made it easy and sent us messengers and prophets to show us the way and tell us why... so all the messengers and all the religions are from the same only God, so they've got to be complementary to each other, not opposing each other!!! then God must have said His final words in the last message, what is the last message? and how do we know it's the last one? I guess that would be the religion that believes in all messengers and all books equally... is there such religion? actually yes, Islam does :)  A True Muslim (man or woman) gets his reward for obeying Allah's orders (Allah means The God in Arabic) by going to heaven, where he/she are indulged forever in all the good things that were on earth and more, things no one ever dreamt of or heard about. The Holy Quran tells Muslims (men and women) there will be good food, good wine and sex in heaven for all, but not in the bestial way you may think of, but rather in a way that is satisfactory for everyone and better than what was on earth. Heaven is no heartbreak or injustice land.  True Muslims are no terrorists, and Islam never calls for that, Islam means peace, it bans violence unless you were fought so you fight back, it only doesn't require Muslims to be cowards, and true Muslims understand this very well and never attack civilians.   Islam is the only religion that accepts freedom of religion and asks men to treat women gently like queens.   It's all in the Holy Quran and the right teachings of prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him).  If some people behave otherwise, then it's because people behaviour doesn't necessarily reflect the rulings of their religion always, for example, we can't (and don't) judge Christianity by Hitler or Madonna.  And that is another reason why there is heaven and hell after we die, heaven for the obedient and hell for the disobedient and/or oppressor, it's all going to be decided on the day of resurrection and judgement.  To be a Muslim, you must believe God is only one with no spouses or offspring, believe in his angels (servants not males or females), believe in all his religions, messangers and books equally, the day of judgement, heaven and hell and that everything is in God's hands and because of his will (good or bad).  Muslims believe God is the only divine who never dies, the creator who deserves to be worshiped, all prophets who came to earth are human messangers sent by him.  Muslims don't deny christianity, judaism, Jesus or Moses. They believe in them as the noble prophets and messangers of God, love and respect them so much.  We believe the birth of Jesus (messanger of God) was a miracle from God to us, being born by a mother only and with no father. God is the creator, he can do anything.  We believe Jesus (peace be upon him) is NOT dead till today; he wasnt even murdered or crucified as most people think. God (most glorified) made the man who betrayed Jesus be killed instead by switching their looks for a moment. Jesus was left up to live in heaven until the end of days when he will come back to earth again, with no new teachings or messages but just to make justice prevail instead of oppression, fight the imposter who will claim to be God and (most important) to perform his last prayer with the Muslims announcing he's too a follower of the last prophet (Muhammad) as all people should... then he really dies like other Prophets and be buried (peace be upon them all). So we're waiting for you Jesus, Messenger of God, to bring the world peace and pray with us. Thats what prophet Muhammad told us and this is what I believe in, Im a Muslim  so how do we know it's true? what is said in the last message and what should we do? read the following, and you'll figure out for yourself:

eb71d539c6860290e80bdaa4253a2f87aa	Do you realize that you just did the very thing to Muslims that you are complaining about other people doing to you?    "True" Muslims are exactly the same type of people that you describe "true" Christians to be.    If you want people to stop stereotyping, and disliking Christians because some"Christians" treat others badly, then you might want to start with not doing the same type of stereotyping to Muslims.    Jesus did say:   "Do to others what you would have them do to you."  Matthew 7:12|`|bxYWJAYNaa	Mmm.    So, the BEST Christian is the example of what a Christian is.

If there weren't so many Christians who appear to be totally clueless but still insist that they are right then I might be more inclined not to be so sarcastic to them in general.    The one thing that I note, is that you're talking about "true Christians", which particular sect is that? I think that aside from the whole 3-in-1 god thing, the only thing that all sects of christianity share is the belief that they are the one true church and everyone else is wrong...

0vmQNf0oaa	No. Christians are to defend those who are downtrodden by evil people like atheists who want to dominate everyone and take away our rights.    Christianity is opposed to violence unless it is necessary.    Isa 1:17  Learn to do well; seek judgment, relieve the oppressed, judge the fatherless, plead for the widow.    It is atheism that promotes violence. The major atheist tyrants of the past 100 years murdered over 100 million people.|`|E3yOmel9aa	Throughout history every religion has promoted apathy (indifference) towards violence and human suffering in the name of religion.|`|EAuMJrs4aa	yes you are correct just checked|`|IqqaA2wIaa	no thats nuts...|`|7NugugsDaa	say whatever you want look at your avatar it seems a little violent to me    He that has no sin shall cast the first stone.|`|ewWUFWyWaa	I missed the previous question. The Bible NT promotes violence and discord in a very subtle way... take this example...    Before his conversion Saint Paul was instrumental in the death of countless followers of Jesus Christ. He must have left behind a lot of widows and orphans. He never repented! After his conversion he doesnt have people killed anymore, but he still has a special hatred for certain people. He doesn't like gays and lesbians, he hates women, and he doesn't like Cretans. He hates widows, especially the ones that he left behind in his past DUNG life as he call it. So he is denying any church help to any widow and no apologies, either.  He hates escaped slaves and he orders them to return to their masters. In fact, he dedicated the whole book of Philemon to teach escaped Christian slaves to return to their masters.    Titus 1:12-13 (NIV)  (Saint Paul writes) Even one of their own prophets has said, CRETANS ARE ALWAYS LIARS, EVIL BRUTES, LAZY GLUTTONS. THIS TESTIMONY IS TRUE! Therefore, rebuke them sharply, so that they will be sound in the faith    Saint Paul wrote the bulk of the New Testament. He laid down the basis for the new Christian religion. Apparently he doesnt like the people of the Island of Crete. He is accusing them on hearsay evidence that they are ALWAYS LIARS, EVIL BRUTES, LAZY GLUTTONS! Christians ought to know that the transforming power of God the Holy Ghost has no effect on the Cretan Christians. The Cretan Christians need to be rebuked sharply that they are no good people.  If a Cretan fills out a job application anywhere the hiring manager is tipped off that they are ALWAYS LIARS, EVIL BRUTES, LAZY GLUTTONS! So good luck all ye Cretans Christians! What if Saint Paul would have made the same statement in the Bible about the American Christians?    I know I know Saint Paul was moved by God the Holy Ghost to write what he wrote and he was not aware of it According to the Fundies the Bible is 100% the Word of God and Saint Paul was his mouthpiece!|`|D9lMg7A2aa	Through what ? The World Council of Churches ?    Have you thought about what you are saying ? forget the data and the point you are hoping to make    There is no supra-denominational Christianity.

Heck, and what's the penalty ? Can't be violence, that would be stupid in the extreme. I know : Apathy !!      I don't mean to make you feel stupid but you are sounding to a lot of us like college days, when the guy who smoked too much started talking and you had to shake him real hard.

Now, there are some religions that do preach hate, but as far as the Christianity that Jesus belong to--It safe to say he didn't preach hate.  It's a shame that religion is the number one reason for numerous wars in different countries, but I don't blame GOD, I blame People.

QC94lBXOaa	I don't know if he scarred him for life, but I'll bet that kid never had to be told twice to take out the trash.|`|AA11622701	Human sacrifice was very common in Abraham's day, practiced all around him, and even by the family from which he came.  But it has always been something that God has hated.    In the act of offering Isaac, the trauma of that moment, and the way it is presented in scripture, it had such a lasting effect on Abraham and Isaac, and through them to the rest of the Jewish nation, that you will not find human sacrifices ever practiced again by the Jewish people.  In that single dramatic moment, God was able to block 3500 years of any more human sacrifices by the Jews, and by extension, the Christians.  For there it has nearly reached universal status that human sacrifice is wrong.    So whatever you may think of the actual moment, apparently God was smart enough (the "all-knowing" thing he has going for him) to know that by that single act he could remove human sacrifices for first the Jews, and then the rest of the world.      Did it scar Issac for life? Apparently not, as Isaac continued on in the worship of YHWH, and passed that faith on his sons. Isaac was in late late teens or early twenties when the event happened, so he did have some maturity through which to understand the event, and apparently was a welling part.  Most 100+ year old men would have a difficult time binding up a 20 year old against their will.    How it affect the relationship between Abraham and Isaac is not dealt with in the scriptures.  In fact, that act is the last recorded conversation between the two in the scriptures.  But then, Abraham died very shortly after that, making any such conversations difficult.|`|RCn1Y3Ogaa	If this situation happened today, you'd see the dad being jailed for 20 years, 40 if the jury really thought he was serious.    Yet, what if he said: "But God told me to do so to show my faith in Him!|`|NjPjpewlaa	No, this is a great thing, (but only was meant for that time) because Abraham showed how much he truly put His trust in God... so things were great for Abraham after that.    Also, because of that incident, God revealed another part of His character to Abraham... the Provider.  that may not have happened, if Abraham didn't obey, and trust.|`|HlFzl1piaa	Unless you don't believe in Jesus, then there will never again be a reason to sacrifice anything.

Edit: *snicker* call the cops on God. *snicker*|`|EyCgjjV4aa	Yeah, im sure he was scarred, "why is daddy blind folding me", "Why am i on the sacraficial alter"  Im sure he was thinking what a unfair siduation.

VNrchvUNaa	Interior Castle: Too much good will ?? :)      It's not good will. It's INTENTIONAL insulting due to lack of understanding and own delusional faith driving the pointless need for prayer in the first place.|`|MSHxYrLEaa	look at it from their point of view    "when will you realize that they WANT to pray for you?"|`|T52vXXBJaa	I guess I would say that those who would pray for you need some kind of closure. Their minds can't fathom that someone could be content with life without their God, so they "pray for you" so they can feel like they've actually done something and then leave the rest up to you.    As distasteful as you find it, try to see the human side of things. Try to see the situation from their point of view (even if they don't want to reciprocate). If they really believe that your soul is at stake, it's perfectly logical to want to pray for you. Advocating creationism being taught in school and picketing abortion clinics are things worth standing up against; having someone pray for you really isn't.|`|7e2dad446deb31af0e15a02d4e75fc9caa	When will you (and others) realize that we have not nor will we ask for your permission to lift you in prayer. The biggest thing you fail to realize is that we follow Gods word first and foremost. That word instructs us to pray for those who do not know God. If you consider yourself an "enemy" to people of faith that's okay too as the word instructs us to pray for our enemies. We do not do it to insult you however we will be obedient to the word and do as the Lord instructs us first. If that is offensive to you I'm sorry your offended but I am not sorry I am being obedient to God and will continue to do so as long as I have breath.|`|EAuMJrs4aa	i know what you mean but really if you dont believe in it it doesnt effect you|`|D9lMg7A2aa	NO...you miss the whole point -- and they probably detect that from talking with you.

If you do not accept HIm, then you have already rejected Him. But either way, all will stand before God on the judgement day.  So, Jesus says, ":I am the way, the truth and the life, NO ONE comes to the Father except thru Me.  So, if you choose to be without Jesus, then Hell is the only other place for anybody to go.  The Bible is truth, like it or not, that doesn't make it not truth.

64d77l4qaa	They can't grasp the difference between faith and reason because their faith *becomes* reason when there is no evidence to prove.    It is a conclusion formed in the absence of reason.    What is unfortunate is that even when evidence is presented which disproves their conclusion, they will reject that reality. They start by substituting reason, and then end up rejecting it all together.|`|QMbaeva9aa	Yes, that's all fine. So?|`|urIm4YaBaa	I don't think that's a good definition of reason, but, yes, there is a world of difference. I also find it terrible to equate reason and science. The scientific method is a procedure developed off of philosophical propositions that were developed using reason, based in simple postulates that were popular among some intellectuals at the time of the scientific revolution.    Reason is a process that can lead to the acceptance or rejection of a proposition. The scientific method is a particular procedure that makes use of reason, but it is not reason itself.    Faith is a lack of process that can lead to the acceptance or rejection of a proposition. The result is that certain propositions are taken as a given, without substantiation, although some after-the-fact justification is sought out and, usually, found.    After a proposition has been accepted on faith, people can (and do) use reason to figure out some ramifications of the proposition. As a result, people tend to think that they've been rational all along. As such, I can certainly see where the mix-up takes place. But you are correct: faith shouldn't be considered as an element of science or reason: it's something entirely distinct.|`|9mLjDa5kaa	"Reason" is an idol, but the unbeliever needs to look to Jesus to see that is the case, simply because "reason" is based on deceitful sinful flesh.     Faith in Jesus alone is what He wants from us  :)|`|0vmQNf0oaa	Because you have faith in science. It is your religion.    Science does have faith in a number of unproven things. You need to study a bit more.    The laws of thermodynamics make it clear the universe couldn't pop into existence from absolute nothing with absolutely no cause. If you believe science therefore you will believe in the existence of God.|`|VNrchvUNaa	Wow... The two answers above me are EPIC FAIL.    They prove your point exactly.

Ok, we know we don't create each other and we don't come to this world from nowhere because when we die we must be going somewhere as well, hence there must be God, if there were many Gods, they would have fought over what to be created and what not to be, probably over who to die and who to live at the same time... so it's gotta be one God... if that God created us then there must be a reason... could we figure it out on our own? God made it easy and sent us messengers and prophets to show us the way and tell us why... so all the messengers and all the religions are from the same only God, so they've got to be complementary to each other, not opposing each other!!! then God must have said His final words in the last message, what is the last message? and how do we know it's the last one? I guess that would be the religion that believes in all messengers and all books equally... is there such religion? actually yes, Islam does :)  A True Muslim (man or woman) gets his reward for obeying Allah's orders (Allah means The God in Arabic) by going to heaven, where he/she are indulged forever in all the good things that were on earth and more, things no one ever dreamt of or heard about. The Holy Quran tells Muslims (men and women) there will be good food, good wine and sex in heaven for all, but not in the bestial way you were told about or may think of, but rather in a way that is satisfactory for everyone and better than what was on earth. Heaven is no heartbreak or injustice land.  True Muslims are no terrorists, and Islam never calls for that, Islam means peace, it bans violence unless you were fought so you fight back, it only doesn't require Muslims to be cowards, and true Muslims understand this very well and never attack civilians.   Islam is the only religion that accepts freedom of religion and asks men to treat women gently like queens.   It's all in the Holy Quran and the right teachings of prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him).  If some people behave otherwise, then it's because people behaviour doesn't necessarily reflect the rulings of their religion always, for example, we can't (and don't) judge Christianity by Hitler or Madonna.  And that is another reason why there is heaven and hell after we die, heaven for the obedient and hell for the disobedient and/or oppressor, it's all going to be decided on the day of resurrection and judgement.  To be a Muslim, you must believe God is only one with no spouses or offspring, believe in his angels (servants not males or females), believe in all his religions, messangers and books equally, the day of judgement, heaven and hell and that everything is in God's hands and because of his will (good or bad).  Muslims believe God is the only divine who never dies, the creator who deserves to be worshiped, all prophets who came to earth are human messangers sent by him.  Muslims don't deny christianity, judaism, Jesus or Moses. They believe in them as the noble prophets and messangers of God, love and respect them so much.  We believe the birth of Jesus (messanger of God) was a miracle from God to us, being born by a mother only and with no father. God is the creator, he can do anything.  We believe Jesus (peace be upon him) is NOT dead till today; he wasnt even murdered or crucified as most people think. God (most glorified) made the man who betrayed Jesus be killed instead by switching their looks for a moment. Jesus was left up to live in heaven until the end of days when he will come back to earth again, with no new teachings or messages but just to make justice prevail instead of oppression, fight the imposter who will claim to be God and (most important) to perform his last prayer with the Muslims announcing he's too a follower of the last prophet (Muhammad) as all people should... then he really dies like other Prophets and be buried (peace be upon them all). So we're waiting for you Jesus, Messenger of God, to bring the world peace and pray with us. Thats what prophet Muhammad told us and this is what I believe in, Im a Muslim  so how do we know it's true? what is said in the last message and what should we do? read the following, and you'll figure out for yourself:|`|6KpZ2fIRaa	Maybe they get their virginity restored.

Claiming they are all in the nature of the Cambrian Explosion is sheer nonsense.

After 150 years, billions of fossil have been discovered covering a period of 3.5 billion years. Fossil beds have been discovered that cover a billion years. The fossil record does not blend together by small steps.

Q4MqzxX7aa	about as effective as praying to anything else.|`|D9lMg7A2aa	That is totally up to God...by definition.|`|3EudCWEuaa	Oh yes, totally effective. Why?    Because the tooth fairy, while told as a myth, is actually represented by a real person- the parents. So the tooth fairy does exist, just not as the interpretation people often describe.    By praying to the tooth fairy, the parents could overhear the person praying, and the prayer be answered by the parents.    So yes, clearly it is effective.|`|Q1XUe0PDaa	Yes, but only if you are praying for a quarter and you have to pay the price. 1 tooth - .25|`|XxWovDNCaa	It's certainly as effective as praying to any other god or pixie.

If you put your faith on anything and pray to it, your prayer will be answered.     It won't be the true God the One who will be answering your prayer, though.

AA11232725	I would wager many Christians on here would say "the talking donkey and talking snake parts of the bible are not to be taken literally".    Actually the context of those passages demands that they be taken literally because both of those accounts occur in historical narratives and they are not an account of someone speaking in poetic or prophetic language where symbols that represent literal truths are used.    Revelation chapter 12 gives us the identity of the serpent.    Revelation 12:9  So the great dragon was cast out, that serpent of old, called the Devil and Satan, who deceives the whole world; he was cast to the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.    And Peter confirms that God used a donkey to speak to Balaam.    2 Peter 2:15  They have forsaken the right way and gone astray, following the way of Balaam the son of Beor, who loved the wages of unrighteousness;  16  but he was rebuked for his iniquity: a dumb donkey speaking with a man's voice restrained the madness of the prophet.    The Bible doesn't make it clear, but if a donkey was speaking with a man's voice then it would seem that actually God was speaking through the Donkey, and not that the Bible has a talking Donkey running around in it like some Shreck movie.    Now, when Balaam was giving a prophecy in that historical narrative, he was using symbolic language that represented literal truths but the symbols were to be recognized as being representative of something else.    Numbers 24:15  So he took up his oracle and said: "The utterance of Balaam the son of Beor, And the utterance of the man whose eyes are opened;  16  The utterance of him who hears the words of God, And has the knowledge of the Most High, Who sees the vision of the Almighty, Who falls down, with eyes wide open:      17  "I see Him, but not now; I behold Him, but not near; A Star shall come out of Jacob; A Scepter shall rise out of Israel, And batter the brow of Moab, And destroy all the sons of tumult.  18  "And Edom shall be a possession; Seir also, his enemies, shall be a possession, While Israel does valiantly.  19  Out of Jacob One shall have dominion, And destroy the remains of the city."    Most people see the coming of Jesus in this cryptic prophesy where a Scepter refers to someone who rules as King. Is the "star" the star of Bethlehem or does it have a different meaning as when Jesus called Himself the bright and morning star?    Revelation 22:16  "I, Jesus, have sent My angel to testify to you these things in the churches. I am the Root and the Offspring of David, the Bright and Morning Star."    In summation, the events in historical narratives contained in the Bible are to be taken literally. Passages where symbolic language is used are there to convey literal truths, however the symbols have to be investigated to find out what they represent in order for that literal truth to be correctly understood.    In regards to issues like what the Bible says about practicing homosexual sex, that issue is clearly addressed in a teaching passage given to us by the Apostle Paul who reminds his readers of God's power to enable former sinners to live changed lives in Christ.    1 Corinthians 6:9  Do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived. Neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor homosexuals, nor sodomites,  10  nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners will inherit the kingdom of God.      11  And such WEREsome of you.

Then how is one supposed to have a clue as to what these people were trying to tell us here and now?   Was there a talking donkey? Or was that a literary device to tell us how the Lord comes to us and speaks to us?   Was satan in the form of a snake or was that some kind of premonition to allow us to get a handle on the essence of evil?   Please! People!

It takes discernment to do that, and that is a spiritual gift, that comes only from God and He only gives it to those who belong to Him , His children...  And those so called "Christians" that you are talking about , God will deal with them, they are pretenders and they hurt the Kingdom of God more than help it...because they are turning people , who might want to get to know God, away from Him...  You cannot pick and choose what to believe in the bible , all of it is truth and the Word of God...in the last part of Revelation it says "Don't take nothing from this Word and add nothing to it"...that is a direct warning from God...|`|AA11521494	Agreed.

I mean, man can fly to the moon, and split the atom, so surely the Devil wouldn't have too hard a time flapping a snake's tongue around!|`|MVLanV8zaa	Well done. Many christians do decide themselves what is to be taken literally.    Christians have fallen from the word, and still call themselves christians sometimes.    Anybody that changes to the bible, will regret it.     "Like, lots of Christians say that the bible condemns homosexuality (this is in the old testament) - yet they then say that the old testament should be ignored.".    This part I can at least tell you...  Even Jesus condemned homosexuality. (New Testement)  There is no part in the new testament that tells you that it is fine now.    The rest of it, like been able to eat anything, comes from where the new testament says it is not what goes into the mouth that makes you unholy, but what comes out. (What you say)    The sabbath day, were many times also done by Jesus.    * Where do they now in the new testament say that it is alright to be gay, or imply that it is fine now?    Do not look for codes in the bible people. For then you are surely part of a cult.    Read and understand. The bible was made for us all who wants to follow God. Only the ignorant people will not be able to see what the bible says.    PS. I would like an answer for the question with the star from anybody who wants to promote gayness. :)|`|vZxk6xi4aa	You know, there are a lot of Christians who don't do that.  You shouldn't judge those you don't know.    And we DO pay attention to the Old Testament. What about the Ten Commandments of the Bible?? That's in the Old Testament.    And we DON'T choose what to be taken literally. As least no one I know does that, and pretty much everyone I know is a Christian.    Why judge people you don't know?      Also- this is to Quiet.Buck- the talking snake that is being reffered to is the serpent that tempted Eve to eat from the Tree of Knowledge in the Bible.

It seems like there's no end to atheists who think they know more about what The Bible REALLY means than what Christians do.    The problem is that you don't believe God exists, and therefore anything The Bible says has to be impossible in your estimation.    Open your mind for one tiny moment and consider that if there really is a God who created all things ~ would it be too hard for him to cause a donkey to speak?     If Satan is real ~ could he not speak through a snake or disguise himself as one?    If Jesus truly is the Son of God ~ would he not know that Hell is indeed a literal place? In fact, he preached more about Hell than he did about Heaven.    The New Testament condemns homosexuality as well as the Old Testament does. You should read it for yourself instead of repeating someone else's ignorance.    Your misunderstanding of The Bible is classic, and you know nothing about that which you criticize.     The Bible is comprised of 66 books, written by men from all types of backgrounds, over a period of roughly 1500 years. Although it was penned by men, their inspiration came from God. All of the books in the Bible are considered inspired works ~ meaning that God's authorship can be seen in them. There are different types of literature in The Bible as well. Some things are intended to be figurative and others are meant to be taken literally. Knowing the type of liturature you're reading goes a long way in being able to understand it.|`|hZjPYyFTaa	The Bible is not meant to be understood literally and there are study tools to properly interpret and apply Gods Word.     No the Bible does not condemn homosexuality if interpreted properly.     Yes it's true Scripture is taken out of context. The new phenomenon of Fundamentalism and Bible literalism is very far away from traditional Christianity.    No do not understand the Bible by the letter, but by the spirit.    Scripture has to be understood through Context and Literary form.   Context includes the historical, social and cultural circumstances of the authors and the communities for whom they were writing.    The literary genre exceeds more than 100 styles, under the two main styles of narrative and poetry.    Bible study takes work or you will be hung up on snakes forever. Bible Dictionary, Concordance. Word Study, Bible Atlas, Bible Customs/Culture,Bible Studies and Commentaries, which are written by scholars from many disciplines that help interpret scripture.  This website gives you an idea of how it is done:  http://www.theologicalstudies.citymax.co...    This website has major study tools  http://bible.cc/     Jesus spoke of a fiery dumpsite outside the walls of Jerusalem called gehenna dnoora which translates into Hell. It's not really a concern of modern churches.   http://www.crossleft.org/node/6051    It's all fun stuff.|`|U51pBeLfaa	The honest thing to do is to follow the bible as God meant it to be followed. The bible is an ancient manuscript mostly written in Hebrew. If it is to be followed to the letter then the letters must be in Hebrew. As I understand it the Hebrew scholars say that 'the bible' should be interpreted allegorically. This defeats the purpose of following the bible literally in the first instance.    I don't have a problem with Christians cherry picking and holding the 'wrong' or a confusing interpretation. I do have a problem if any Christians try impose their interpretation as the only interpretation politically or otherwise. I thought that was what the reformation was all about.    For the purpose of discussion on atheists looking at Christianity and finding it confusing. What should Christians make of atheists here? Some say Jesus was historical figure, others say he does not exist at all. This is from the group of people claiming to be scientific, rational, consensual and based on the facts. We Christians are supposed to be the 'faith' based group; where you would expect contention among the different faiths.    Let us face it is human nature to cherry pick and choose 'the facts' that will support our own argument.|`|yk7jmSnDaa	the bible isn't the kind of book that you can pick and choose from. to be a real follower of Christ and to truly believe you have to accept the bible fully. it's either all or nothing to experience His true grace and mercy!|`|0O7nk7AKaa	the bible is to be taken literally and open-mindedly, otherwise you will never understand it, homo is not condemned, it is just a hateful sin-and nasty, hellfire is literal

AA11818873	Doesn't really help much.<br>  We are taught to say "sorry" as a matter of courtesy, when we are kids at school. It is to promote that 'feel-good-factor' more than its intrinsic value!  In most cases, it ends up as a good 'diplomatic' tool, during skillful negotiations.<br>  Moreover, in true sense, 'sorry' is not apology! Like, "I am sorry to know that you had....  (what ever kind of mishap etc)..." Apology has to be in addition to this sorry feeling, if we had caused it. And, we have to really do our best to compensate for any wrong we have caused, if we have remorse. <br>  The spirit by itself does not get touched by any situation like a "sorry state of affairs".<br>  Till a person really evolves, perhaps, saying 'sorry' MIGHT to some extent, help dissolve that tough 'ego' , adamant resistance, which blocks spiritual growth.|`|c7pbvYmpaa	Sorry|`|eAMq1iBWaa	It's the best way to get in the last word<br>  <br>  ;-)|`|mggll8dRaa	"I'm Sorry" has become the most over-used Excuse in these times;<br>  <br>  Don't do it in the first place, then there will be No Problem....!!<br>  <br>  "And Everybody Does It" is another Lame excuse, Sorry, EVERYBODY DOESN"T DO IT.....only Fools, who then go back to the "I'm Sorry" Syndrome.....!!|`|UinOWcMUaa	Because it makes you not so prideful -- :) Lucifer was prideful and then he became known as the DEVIL !!<br>  <br>  Proverbs 6:16-19 There are six things the LORD HATES, seven that are DETESTABLE to him: haughty eyes, a lying tongue, hands that shed innocent blood, a heart that devises wicked schemes, feet that are quick to rush into evil, a false witness who pours out lies and a man who stirs up dissension among brothers.|`|g4AAZRuxaa	Makes people humble as long as they really are and don't intend to that again.|`|zGAGZKY5aa	Relieves some of the guilt you may be feeling|`|5JqCObDSaa	Saying sorry free's you and the other person from bondage, or bitterness from a wrong action. It allows forgiveness to take place and free each person from feelings that cause separation or discord. When you have something that keeps you bound it affects your spirit to the point of a heaviness that doesn't allow you to be free in the spirit because you are weighed down with that conviction or condemnation.

The way things worked out ended badly and now there is tension. Each of us is really tied up in our version of events in which the other is wrong. <br>  Both angry, Both stuck being angry.<br>  The fact of the matter is that you were 50% responsible.<br>  You were there, you acted or reacted in a certain way, you said something you shouldn't have, or didn't say something when you needed to. You trusted or ignored your instincts in the interaction. You were a good friend, or less than a good friend.

Nobody is perfect, we all do things less than perfectly. Identifying these flaws gives you the opportunity to make yourself a better person. And it takes a lot of maturity to see this. <br>  <br>  2. A lot of spiritual teaching is based on withdrawal. If you can take yourself out of the equation, view things as though these interactions were part of a movie and see each persons actions and motives objectively, then you are doing yourself a favour.

Apart from the first ever in the world religion.|`|gqhoCu3faa	For The most important facts of your question, please visit the web side http://www.mormon.org   &  THE GOOD SECRET EVIDENCE  There have to be a purpose for life otherwise we will miss the peaceful path of happiness to choose truly what is right & wrong. In fact right love does not need anything but only feelings of right. Where love is high, there selfishness is Low. Just only faith is not enough to be right. We need real Evidence. Right..?  So,   Spiritually,   What is God?  Whats makes God as god?    Well, just try to know, whats makes God as god, the Power, isnt it? So what the power can do? Ah? Well, it can give the ability to organise all things & it can give the ability to separate everything & most importantly, the Ability to control everything, isnt it? Isnt it good? Ah? So, from our hard study & research effort with the help from god, we realized that the ability to control everything, the Power of God is gradually increased in the full amount to use so; The Power of God is always the omnipotent & existed among everything. & The God now is always the same omnipotent for us, who is organised us & we are growing towards perfection. The perfection is the final stage, not the end. & The Power of God, the Ability is the reward for us to control everything in a proper manner, like the true God of goodness. & Everlasting Happiness is the final stage. & it cannot come alone without the final stage perfection of God. & if god always perfect in perfection then there have to be beginning with God for the organizing progress of all things. So, there is No end & also No beginning for all things, including this on going organizing progress. So, we cannot get anything from nothing. All are energy. E=MC2     If you dont still agree,   Note  this:  you can use any thing for Good or Bad so, whenever possible If you ask the god for the good reason to give you the ability perfection, because of your obedience, then the God will give you, if the god is Almighty.       If you are humble, Please, Pray to know the truth from true God by the inspiration of the Holy Spirit with great faith. Good or bad, Good with bad.

Otherwise we would have become children of Satan of Adam's sin.|`|2cffac83fd0af111ee13a8847dc6ba9daa	Yes there is only of story of Jesus and what he did for mankind.  There is none like him. No one else cares for you like he does or has done for you like he has.    None other can forgive sin or bear sin or bear sickness or disease or break the chains off of ones life.    None other is as merciful as he and if they were  they could not forgive and totally obliterate the sin record in your life.    Keep it simple. Some historians and volumes of books written by PHD's and laymen are out to just deceive people to turn them away from Christ.    If you have not done so already get alone somewhere and ask God to reveal his Son Jesus to you. Ask Him to come into your heart and life. God is chomping at the bit to show himself to you and I. Lots of times we are trying to figure it out instead of accepting God's gift. Just receive it by faith. Somethings will never make total sense. Stick with the basics and build from there.    God bless you.|`|FYjf7hkEaa	The Jesus myth is from the Egyptian Horus myth, freshened up and rewritten.|`|GtazNrplaa	It was originally Judas Khrestus an Essene who was crucified|`|7NugugsDaa	Why yes it is.|`|ZNo1Ah5taa	you get that guy and add Horus being killed and resurrected 3 days later and you get......heres a hint his name starts with J and he is the son of god|`|nrnVqh7iaa	This video is AMAZING and explains all religion over time... soo interesting.|`|D9lMg7A2aa	This was always used in the opposite way, that God had adumbrated the Coming of His Son even to the pagans. Hence the Pax Romana was the 'fullness of time' and the Eclogues of Virgil a kind of pagan prophecy.    The Jesus story is original in the sense that everything else points to it.    You even use the word 'original' wrong !!! It really means to go back to an origin, you use as 'to be new' !! -- Opposite meanings.

This should explain the boy in the purple shirt beyond question.|`|gqhoCu3faa	For The most important facts of your question, please visit the web side http://www.mormon.org   &  THE GOOD SECRET EVIDENCE  There have to be a purpose for life otherwise we will miss the peaceful path of happiness to choose truly what is right & wrong. In fact right love does not need anything but only feelings of right. Where love is high, there selfishness is Low. Just only faith is not enough to be right. We need real Evidence. Right..?  So,   Spiritually,   What is God?  Whats makes God as god?    Well, just try to know, whats makes God as god, the Power, isnt it? So what the power can do? Ah? Well, it can give the ability to organise all things & it can give the ability to separate everything & most importantly, the Ability to control everything, isnt it? Isnt it good? Ah? So, from our hard study & research effort with the help from god, we realized that the ability to control everything, the Power of God is gradually increased in the full amount to use so; The Power of God is always the omnipotent & existed among everything. & The God now is always the same omnipotent for us, who is organised us & we are growing towards perfection. The perfection is the final stage, not the end. & The Power of God, the Ability is the reward for us to control everything in a proper manner, like the true God of goodness. & Everlasting Happiness is the final stage. & it cannot come alone without the final stage perfection of God. & if god always perfect in perfection then there have to be beginning with God for the organizing progress of all things. So, there is No end & also No beginning for all things, including this on going organizing progress. So, we cannot get anything from nothing. All are energy. E=MC2     If you dont still agree,   Note  this:  you can use any thing for Good or Bad so, whenever possible If you ask the god for the good reason to give you the ability perfection, because of your obedience, then the God will give you, if the god is Almighty.       If you are humble, Please, Pray to know the truth from true God by the inspiration of the Holy Spirit with great faith. Good or bad, Good with bad.

86218b3eee8a27ac46cd66ace3e43a3daa	This might touch upon your question:    *** it-1 pp. 244-245 Balaam ***    Son of Beor, of the 15th century?B.C.E. He lived in the Aramaean town of Pethor in the upper Euphrates Valley and near the Sajur River. Though not an Israelite, Balaam had some knowledge and recognition of Jehovah as the true God, speaking of him on one occasion as Jehovah my God. (Nu 22:5,?18) This may have been because devout worshipers of Jehovah (Abraham, Lot, and Jacob) formerly lived in the vicinity of Haran, not far from Pethor.Ge 12:4,?5; 24:10; 28:5; 31:18,?38.    Balaam turned down the offer of the first delegation from the Moabite king Balak, who brought with them payments for divination, saying: Jehovah has refused to let me go with you. (Nu 22:5-14) When other princes in greater number and more honorable came (Nu 22:15), and Balaam again sought Gods permission to go, Jehovah said: Get up, go with them. But only the word that I shall speak to you is what you may speak.Nu 22:16-21; Mic 6:5.    On the way Jehovahs angel three times stood in the road, causing Balaams *** first to turn into a field, then to squeeze Balaams foot against a wall, and at last to lie down. Three times Balaam beat the animal, which then miraculously uttered a spoken protest. (Nu 22:22-30) Finally, Balaam himself saw Jehovahs angel, who announced: I have come out to offer resistance, because your way has been headlong against my will. Yet Jehovah once again allowed Balaam to continue in his chosen course.Nu 22:31-35.    From start to finish God unalterably disapproved any cursing of Israel, insisting that if Balaam went he would have to bless, not curse. (Jos 24:9,?10) However, God permitted him to go. It was as in the case of Cain, when Jehovah expressed his disapproval but at the same time allowed the individual personal choice, either to abandon his bad way or plunge ahead in his wicked course. (Ge 4:6-8) Balaam, then, like Cain, was headstrong in disregarding Jehovahs will in the matter, and was determined to gain his own selfish objective. In Balaams case it was greed of reward that blinded him to the wrongness of his way, as Jude writes: Balaam rushed into the erroneous course for reward. The apostle Peter comments: Balaam, the son of Beor, .?.?. loved the reward of wrongdoing, but got a reproof for his own violation of what was right. A voiceless beast of burden, making utterance with the voice of a man, hindered the prophets mad course.Jude 11; 2Pe 2:15,?16.    Upon reaching Moabite territory and meeting King Balak on the bank of the Arnon, Balaam wasted no time in going to work for these opposers of Jehovahs people the next day. Balaam together with Balak offered up sacrifices, and then Balaam withdrew, hoping to come upon any unlucky omens (Nu 23:3; 24:1), but the only message received was a blessing for Israel from Jehovah. The same sacrificial procedure was again followed atop Pisgah, and again there was no unlucky spell against Jacob, only blessings. Finally, the performance was repeated atop Peor, and again for the third time God changed the malediction into a benediction.Nu 22:4124:9; Ne 13:2.    At this turn of events, Balaks anger blazed against Balaam, and, clapping his hands in a rage, he exclaimed: It was to execrate my enemies that I called you, and, look! you have blessed them to the limit these three times. And now run your way off to your place. I had said to myself I was without fail going to honor you, but, look! Jehovah has held you back from honor. (Nu 24:10,?11) Balaam tried to excuse himself, blaming Jehovah for his failure at cursing Israel, saying he was not able to pass beyond the order of Jehovah, and that whatever Jehovah said is what he had to speak. So with a few more proverbial pronouncements against Israels enemies, Balaam got up and went and returned to his place.Nu 24:12-25.    When it says that Balaam returned to his place it does not necessarily mean he actually reached his home back in Pethor. The words themselves do not imply that Balaam left more than the immediate vicinity of Mount Peor. As Cooks Commentary observes on Numbers 24:25: Returned to his own place .?.?. Not to his own land, for he remained amongst the Midianites to plot by new means against the people of God, and to perish in his sin.?.?.?. The phrase, which is of frequent recurrence (cf. e.g. Gen. xviii. 33, xxxi. 55; I S.xxvi. 25; 2 S.?xix. 39), is idiomatic, meaning merely that Balaam went away whither he would.    Balaam still entertained hope of having that rich reward for which he had come so far and for which he had worked so hard. If he could not curse Israel, he reasoned, perhaps God himself would curse his own people, if only they could be seduced to engage in sex worship of the Baal of Peor. So Balaam .?.?. went teaching Balak to put a stumbling block before the sons of Israel, to eat things sacrificed to idols and  to commit fornication. (Re 2:14) By Balaams word, the daughters of Moab and Midian served to induce the sons of Israel to commit unfaithfulness toward Jehovah over the affair of Peor, so that the scourge came upon the assembly of Jehovah. (Nu 31:16) The result: 24,000 men of Israel died for their sin. (Nu 25:1-9) Neither Midian nor Balaam escaped divine punishment. Jehovah commanded that all the men, women, and boys of Midian be executed; only virgins were spared. And they killed Balaam the son of Beor with the sword. (Nu 25:16-18; 31:1-18) As for the Moabites, they were barred from the congregation of Jehovah to the tenth generation.De 23:3-6.|`|AA11047076	Bilaam is an interesting character- on the one hand, he represents the potential that any human being, Jewish or otherwise can achieve- but on th eother hand he shows how badly that potential can be misused and bring the person to destruction.    Yes, there is a midrash that states the Bilaam had the potential to be equal to Moshe in prophecy, yet he never achieved that potential.  we see this in the manner that Hashem spoke to Bilaam:  Hashem only comes to Buillam when he is asleep- i.e. through his dreamds; on the other hand, Moshe would speak to hashem at any time.  The examples of this are many:  everytime Bilaam speaks to the messages from the Midianites, he has to tell them to wait till the next morning so he can communicate with Hashem overnight.  On the other hand, when the Jews come to Moshe with complaints or queries, he gets them an answer right away!    So Bilaam was a true prophet who communicated with G-d, and he had the potential for more- yet he failed to achieve it.  What happened- sinat chinam (baseless hatred), the same sin for which we are told the Temple was destroyed.  Bilaam had no reason to hate the Jews, and yet he did.  He was eager to go and try to curse the Jews- never mind that he was always concerned about his personal honour, when he finally gets told he can go with the messengers from Midian, he gets up early in the morning, saddling his own donkey, not even waiting for his servants to help!    Why did he tt become a giur?  Why did he have such a fatal flaw that the meforshim go on to tell us led to his complete downfall?  It was his at his suggestion that the Midianites used sex at Baal Peor to entice the Jews into idoltary- and for that he lost the power of prophecy and resorted to sorcery.  But no explanation can be found as to why he was so willing to debase himself to attack the Jews.  Hatred leads people to do things they would not otherwsie, to ebd up destroying themselves as Bilaam did.    As to his personal beliefs, nothing is said beyond that which he read in the Torah.  As he had a knowledge of witchcraft and sorcery, he would have had a knowledge of the spiritual realm- but we don;t knwo what form that took or how he viewed the afterlife.|`|IqqaA2wIaa	rebelliousness.....always use REFEREnces.|`|9mLjDa5kaa	There's no "7 commandments" given to the Gentiles.

Mnm35sjNaa	That's one of the first major dilemmas of Genesis.<br>  <br>  God gave us dominion over all the other animals of the world.  He gave us intelligence.  But he doesn't want us to use it.  His one warning to Adam and Eve was to keep their grubby hands off the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil.  Furthermore, the entire Bible has not one word in praise of intelligence.<br>  <br>  The Bible is anti-intellectual.  It clearly portrays thinking as a bad thing that only leads to distancing yourself from (the biblical) God.<br>  <br>  And that is, in reality, the truth -- if you keep free will in mind.<br>  <br>  Free will cuts to the core of scriptural veracity and reveals the contradictions, ignorance and lies that dogma tries to cover up.<br>  <br>  The concept of free will wasn't really "fleshed out" until around 400 A.D., when St. Augustine developed a doctrine of free will to make man responsible for his own actions, as well as accountable to God.  This was centuries after the Bible (both Old and New Testaments) was written.  The Bible is so riddled with free will contradictions because its authors had no concept of free will.  Everybody in those days were entirely deterministic in their beliefs.<br>  <br>  Today, most Christian denominations proclaim free will as reality, despite the fact that the Bible is really deterministic.  Although there was no concept of free will in biblical times, some verses might nonetheless be construed as promoting free will -- but one would expect that to happen in any book written by humans.  Even if we believe everything is predestined, we also experience our plans and goals being met in a directed way.  We are always willing to accept credit for our accomplishments.  This is a tacit acknowledgment of free will, despite the lack of a free will doctrine.<br>  <br>  Here's the twisted morality that Genesis presents us:<br>  <br>  1)    Sin is disobedience to God<br>  2)    God doesn't want us to know about right and wrong (Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil)<br>  3)    God will take away your immortality AND curse all your offspring, FOREVER, with mortality, if your disobey him ONCE.<br>  <br>  If you're sentenced to death for a single instance of disobedience, then you MUST obey God or die!  That is NOT free will.  God made us human and gifted us with intelligence, then tells us the nature of our humanity is sinful.<br>  <br>  How can people not see through this preposterous charade?  Biblical sin is a tool to manipulate and control us via fear and guilt.  It puts us in opposition to ourselves by proclaiming our nature to be sinful.<br>  <br>  I reject that neurosis!  I say most people are basically good but sometimes make mistakes.  We were created HUMAN, not saints or angels.  Any religion built on denying our nature is an unhealthy religion.<br>  <br>  That's why the Abrahamic religions (Judaism, Christianity and Islam) have been the most persistently divisive influence in the history of civilization.<br>  <br>  You doubt that?  Just turn on CNN world news and see the results for yourself.|`|rAmhfdqkaa	he's just a tease.|`|AA11058044	Maybe He didn't think we'd actually use it start investigating how the universe really works.<br>  <br>  He just intended us to be clever little puppets, making cute poems and psalms and stuff to stroke his ego.<br>  <br>  But then Eve had to go and eat that stupid fruit, and ruin everything.<br>  <br>  He's been trying to put the pieces back in the box ever since - breaking people into divisive, hate-filled groups with the Tower of Babel thing; He even tried to wipe us all out at one point, but kept a drunken animal lover around rather than simply reboot the whole system.  <br>  <br>  We're his little science experiment gone wrong.

AA12059450	Your question seems to relate to the New Testament use of the word "law." Here is the definition of the Greek word used in the New Testament and commonly translated by "law:"<br>  <br>  law, regulation, principle; this has a broad range of meanings and referents, ranging from law as a principle revealed in nature or reason, to the OT Scriptures as a body, the first five books of the Scriptures, or any single command of the Scriptures.<br>  <br>  Notice that it can refer to the entire Old Testament or pieces of it... <br>  <br>  Here is an example of it NOT referring to the Torah (the "books of Moses," the first 5 books of the Old Testament) or even any of the rabbi's 613 "laws:"<br>  <br>  John 10:34 Jesus answered them, “Is it not written in your Law, ‘I have said you are “gods’ ?”<br>  <br>  Jesus quoted Psalm 82:6 but described it as "law." This goes against the idea that it refers only to the Torah. <br>  <br>  <br>  Basically you have to look at an individual context to determine the sense in which the word is being used. Remember to always start with the broadest meaning (in this case, law as a principle, or the entire body of  OT scripture) and allow the text itself to narrow it, if it does. For instance, "written in..." limits it to scripture, and a specific quote links it with the context of the quote, as with Psalms above.|`|VzCygD6taa	All of the instructions found in Exodus.

nisfxpXHaa	I'm not sure how old the two of you are, or the reason for the break up. But you both sound young. I just can't believe that your ex is that serious about rekindling your relationship, or she would be the one pursuing you and not leaving it up to friends to get it to you through the grapevine. I also like to remind people in your position that you ex's for a reason. Are you really sure you want to go back to what ever it is that split you up in the first place.    Sometimes we have to face the fact that some people are meant to stay in our past. Your young, don't limit yourself to this one person because you had a relationship with her once upon a time. See what else is out there, you might be surprised.      L|`|P3JsbI7gaa	talk to her about it.  it seems like you 2 love eachother i mean its been 2 years and u still have feelings for each other. tell her you dont want to get hurt again but that u do still love her.|`|C0yagFFoaa	you must be a masochist, she is only playing with you, she has to be in control, she has no feelings for you at all. runaway form her|`|0r8KV5jiaa	F*C* THAT!   Keep testing the waiters... if she broke up with you or u did, then that's over homie!|`|wOytdKEQaa	I honestly think that you should move on from your ex girlfriend. From what you've been saying, it sounds like she's toying with you.    Of course, it would also depend on why you broke up. If it was for an extremely serious reason, one that debilitated a healthy relationship (such as she cheated on you, or she just suddenly stopped communicating and talking with you), then you should not start dating her again.|`|Xgm680dCaa	just remember a ex is a ex for a reason    we all have feelings for people we have dated but if it didn't work the first time it will not work the second time

What does not kill you only makes you stronger, so the saying goes.|`|jjt2enntaa	No I do not everything happens for a reason.  But I do think we can learn something from everything.  And I think we can eventually come up with reasons for something happening.  But, if you are speaking of some divine intervention that there is a deep reason for everything in our lives, than no.|`|8G42oyydaa	Of course and that reason is usually human error.  Everything that happens is a reaction to a previous action, taken by someone that set off a chain of events.  This simple concept IMO suggests that everything that happens is part of some great cosmic plan and I totally disagree ! <br>  <br>  A man has a fight with his wife, he leaves home pissed off, he cuts someone off while he is driving, gives them the finger, that person flies into a road rage and vents that rage on someone else, only he takes it even further, the little old lady he terrorizes gets so scared she has a heart attack while driving and runs up onto the sidewalk and into a group of people standing there - is this some great cosmic plan? Or Gods will? <br>  <br>  This is free will at work, action = reaction. Nothing more, and to believe its part of Gods plan or some cosmic plan and has happened  because somewhere, hidden from our poor human brains there is some "deep and meaningful" reason is IMO silly,<br>  <br>  Sorry dont mean to offend, just stating my opinion. We have free will and we have the brain to control our actions which create a reaction. Thats what I think.<br>  <br>  One dead butterfly does not change the course of the world or its evolution, thats why God made spares|`|bf4cc388616ba9cb48357f54373c609eaa	Everything that happens does influence something or someone.

Sometimes I don't understand the reason for a long time. Maybe even for years.  But, eventually, I do.|`|2R3iJnFPaa	No.|`|ku2tP4eEaa	No.  The Universe is based on chaos.  Seldom do random events come together for any meaning.  Life on Earth is one of those few events.  And still there is no justifiable reason for the existence of life.  After all most of the universe is lifeless.   Even more improvable is that life is dominate by an intelligent animal.  It is known that someday all life will end on Earth.

There is no need for questions that offend or provoke others.|`|4Rt7Mm8Aaa	Obviously the answer is no we should not put up questions like that. We should not delve into matters that we know nothing about. But somehow, on Yahoo Answers, everyone here is a mufti in rulings of jurisprudence, fiqh, hadith evidence, a scholar of Islamic history etc. These people need to understand that it is not what one 'thinks' and what one 'feels is right' that makes Islam. Islam is not meant to be something to pick and choose, you accept all of its teachings. While it is true that the differences in the ummah are a blessing, they only remain a blessing so long as they are not a source of fitna, then those differences become a curse. If Muslims want to know about Islamic questions and rulings they should go to an islamic website like www.askimam.org a Sunni site that contains highly reputable Ulama that have studied Islam intensely.|`|9QhnQNFyaa	yes i agree that a lot of questions lead to fitnah and so much hate .|`|bs9Zbouaaa	Say what is truth and that makes people aware about the truth.|`|diaSqz8laa	let's just all agree to be able to disagree.

It only proves media right when (stinky stuff) gets stired. People who stir hate and misconception only fuels hate. Itis really heartbreaking the way some people make the most beautiful thing "Islam"look bad.The very idea of Islam is a reminder and correction for the misguide of what had come before not a new religion.    [74:31] We appointed angels to be guardians of Hell, and we assigned their number (19) (1) to disturb the disbelievers, (2) to convince the Christians and Jews (that this is a divine scripture), (3) to strengthen the faith of the faithful, (4) to remove all traces of doubt from the hearts of Christians, Jews, as well as the believers, and (5) to expose those who harbor doubt in their hearts, and the disbelievers; they will say, "What did GOD mean by this allegory?" GOD thus sends astray whomever He wills, and guides whomever He wills. None knows the soldiers of your Lord except He. This is a reminder for the people.    [11:120] We narrate to you enough history of the messengers to strengthen your heart. The truth has come to you herein, as well as enlightenments and reminders for the believers.

60303894b298b261e863d683d3b7c896aa	I am the way and the truth and the lifewith this simple statement, Jesus summarized the objective of his life and ministry on earth. Those words are filled with meaning for us today. Recall that Jesus followed up this statement by saying: No one comes to the Father except through me.  Jesus words are as relevant today as they were when he uttered them. We can therefore have full confidence that if we follow Jesus, we will never become lost. He, and he alone, will show us the way to the Father.|`|iaPtohhhaa	Yes, yes and yes. Not many accept this fact though it is 'plaster' all over the scripture.    Just to add a few:  Col. 1:14-15 'In Whom (Jesus) we have redemption through His Blood, even the forgiveness of sins: Who (Jesus) is the IMAGE of the INVISIBLE God, the first born of every creature.'    2 John 2:20: 'And we know that the Son of God is come and hath given us understanding, that we may know Him (ever wonder who is this?) that is true, and we are in Him (as person) that is true, EVEN IN His Son Jesus Christ. This (that's Him) is the true God, and eternal Life.'    Remember, no one can see God. So He has to expressed in someway for us (of those in space-time) to know Him.    If you get this revelation, you will understanding why Jesus talked the way He talk.|`|EAuMJrs4aa	he may have been , so why dont christians stop following paul?|`|A01w1dHqaa	He is in us, so we are also.

THEN . . . the non-believers will be interested in our Bible, our Savior, and our God.    Dan in Miami|`|NLinPsyhaa	Amen.|`|gqhoCu3faa	For The most important facts of your question, please visit the web side http://www.mormon.org   &  THE GOOD SECRET EVIDENCE  There have to be a purpose for life otherwise we will miss the peaceful path of happiness to choose truly what is right & wrong. In fact right love does not need anything but only feelings of right. Where love is high, there selfishness is Low. Just only faith is not enough to be right. We need real Evidence. Right..?  So,   Spiritually,   What is God?  Whats makes God as god?    Well, just try to know, whats makes God as god, the Power, isnt it? So what the power can do? Ah? Well, it can give the ability to organise all things & it can give the ability to separate everything & most importantly, the Ability to control everything, isnt it? Isnt it good? Ah? So, from our hard study & research effort with the help from god, we realized that the ability to control everything, the Power of God is gradually increased in the full amount to use so; The Power of God is always the omnipotent & existed among everything. & The God now is always the same omnipotent for us, who is organised us & we are growing towards perfection. The perfection is the final stage, not the end. & The Power of God, the Ability is the reward for us to control everything in a proper manner, like the true God of goodness. & Everlasting Happiness is the final stage. & it cannot come alone without the final stage perfection of God. & if god always perfect in perfection then there have to be beginning with God for the organizing progress of all things. So, there is No end & also No beginning for all things, including this on going organizing progress. So, we cannot get anything from nothing. All are energy. E=MC2     If you dont still agree,   Note  this:  you can use any thing for Good or Bad so, whenever possible If you ask the god for the good reason to give you the ability perfection, because of your obedience, then the God will give you, if the god is Almighty.       If you are humble, Please, Pray to know the truth from true God by the inspiration of the Holy Spirit with great faith. Good or bad, Good with bad. God gave us the rights to do what is right for you & sometimes, things can be right in your point of view but wrong in Public point of view so Basically, we & god can do anything for right reason but just pray about it for the Good Answer and try to do the God's will first always.    Just think, why so much trouble & pain in this world? Then there is only one reason, without pain, no pleasure, without them, we cannot enjoy this life so always we need them. You use pain & pleasure instead of, they use you. You have to be certain to win in order to succeed in your Best job. If possible, keep the photo of your vision. The vision of your future should be clear & feel it strong enough in your visualizing mind & your desire for success should be greater than your fear of failure. & Love is the Ability. When we do repetitive actions somehow our State of mind has to be new as we did the first action. & we all make mistakes so it is hard to look for star in daylight. So just in faith, it is possible. Like that the faith in true God. Because of Lack of faith in true God, we do not have the great gift of understanding of things. All things are spiritually first, to govern by God with glory. Have a look at this world of wonders of yours & then you know the truth, when you listen to your real voice. & having a strong desire to do the best every day then stick with the best to do your best & most importantly, try to be grateful for what you have now to get out of fear & doing your best & making good people as a powerful influential person / leader, this is going to make your life winning.    The Law of mercy cannot rob the Law of justice so Justice demands the punishment of our sin but The Law of mercy requires the forgiveness to give to us & God is perfect in perfection so cannot violate his laws so The God provided the way to our salvation to overcome our sin so Jesus Christ sacrifice is much needed to return to live with God, so Jesus Christ is our savior.    Did you make the commitment to find joy in every moment by using your empowering meanings & conscious focus for the needs of your five senses?  Did you make this promise; I will never going to settle less than I can be?  Do you have the must realistic measurable rules, goals & best clear image of what you really want in all aspects of your life?  Do you live your life as a mission for your vision purpose?  Breaking down your vision into mini-goals & give must time for them regularly  Write it down the answers to be more real  Try to know all the basics to manage your life & Ask: Is it enjoyable? Rather than believing the progress is hard  Be aware of your believe which is holding you back to take actions   The Power is focus; choose wisely  http://in.youtube.com/watch?v=O061waey5g...

0312ec6bd9788b0c6bf89b026c84d0c6aa	To deny one`s marital partner sexual intimacy is very wrong and fails to fulfil the pledge to love and honor one another,but to seek sexual satisfaction with another outside of the marital union is adultery and a very grave sin indeed.  It is obvious to me that your Husband has some problem that has to be dealt with and you should seek some marriage counselling advice before you are driven to the point of distraction and your marriage fails altogether.  I pray that things will work out for you as this problem is hard to live with and suffer in silence.  God bless.|`|AA10192697	I'm not sure what your question is.  You start out with asking "would it be a sin if..."  I'm not sure what the 'sin' is with your story.    If you are having intimacy issues, seek couples counseling.  Maybe he is having erection problems and that makes many men feel less that a man.  There is help for that.  Maybe he isn't interested in sex with you or anyone anymore. Yes, that happens.  I know of 2 couples that haven't had sex in over 15 years but still love each other greatly. Sex just isn't for them anymore.    If sex is such an issue for you, ask him if it would be ok for you to satisfy yourself. Or ask him what he wants.  But I don't undestand why you posted this here.  What is the sin that you talk about?  Divorcing him?|`|7e8NN8saaa	What exactly do you think is a sin here?     It sounds like marriage counseling is the answer for your problem. In order to find out why he is acting the way he is you need someone professional who can help him open up and really talk about what is going on. Until that happens, you are not going to know the whys.|`|iaPtohhhaa	You are very right. Wife ougth to be loved and cared. Unfortunately, this is the common thing happening in a lot of family: Is just that the romantic sparks a couple once enjoy were lost due to lifeless daily responsibility. Especially man, the way he provide love is quite often not what the woman wants or expects. Man don't talk much of the feeling but woman is because she is a more emotional being. That's why there are cases people work till they snap out and leave home, or just work and work as if this is his life.    Both (especially men) need to know work is not their life. We can still breathe without work for few days. It is responsibility, but not life. There is time for everything. Try go out for a meal, or on holiday, away from home and work or anything that will snap out of daily routine. Then talk about what you both did enjoy when first courted. Rekindle the romance. It is NEEDED.|`|ltwC6Bv1aa	The question is: Do YOU still love him?    Be honest to yourself first.    If the answer is no, then honestly tell him that you want to break up and move on. If you still love him, then start working on your relationship quickly!    Do something romantic for a change! Be adventurous!  Bake a cake or go out and light the candles!! Wear something sexy! Maybe that will get him started to be more romantic too. Who knows it may get the both of you in the mood for more.    Don't forget, a relationship needs to be worked on all times, otherwise it will die out.|`|a5ef125f73c7e0507eb991485e86abc2aa	It sounds like you are married to my husband. lol I have the same issues as you, my husband and I do not really have sex (maybe once every 6 months) and I know he is not cheating because he is home with me every night. I also know we don't have sex too much because he is overweight and cannot last long and it kills his ego. He is not the best dad because like your husband he spends most of his time on his computer. With me, I try not to worry so much because I am not a super sexual person and I am fine doing without, and it seems that is where are similarities end. In answer to your question, yes it is a sin to seek sex elsewhere regardless of the reason. I would suggest praying about it and possible seeking counseling somewhere. You do not have to bring your husband, just work on yourself. I wish there was a pill that could magically change things, but there is not. I find concentrating on my relationship with God and concentrating on my own life helps me to not focus on that part of our marriage. I have questioned my decision to marry my husband, but it is too late. I will not leave him because of sex and his lack of emotional attachment. I vowed before God to be with my husband until death and that is what I will do. Any worries or frustrations I have, I give to God and let Him deal with that. I pray you find some peace with your situation.|`|GtazNrplaa	He has a medical problem maintaining an erection seek medical advice and drag him kicking ans screaming to the doctors. If he don't then get some Viagra and slip it into his food.|`|E9chZY74aa	Holding on to this desire is not helping you.  When you pray to God, tell Him you will accept and love the man he has given you and that you can not change him, so you will change yourself.  I know this is hard, but it is the only way.  Once you do this, then become the wife you are suppose to be, no nagging, or expecting in that area and simply give it up to God to resolve. You can not control your husband, no matter how you try or want to.  So, change yourself, it is all you ever have.  God will honor this sacrifice. Remember, this world is not our home.|`|AA10137068	lol  you don't have to downlaod anything to chat.  and stop snooping on him!|`|0fQk2spXaa	You are in a difficult situation.  I can empathize with you.  But, I assume when you got married the two of you took vows to each other and to God.  Just because he broke his vows to meet your needs, does not give you license to break your vows to "forsake all others".

I've been to Asheville, and OMG, what a beautiful place!!!  It would be great to retire to, but I don't know how much of the gaylife you are going to find there.  As for Charlotte, I'm clueless... but you know anyplace is what you make of it.<br>  I know a couple of guys that might interest you, but we are all in Missouri.  And I'm not sure if any of them are computer literate... hahahah, we are all old school....<br>  If I were you and trying to start over, and maybe open your salon, I would concentrate on getting your career going... then look for a new beau.  You could try www.icu.com  It's like window shopping.... everyone has their pictures up and you can at least glance at the merchandise before making a purchase.... Otherwise I think you mentioned that you are not into the "bar" scene....  Well most bars have those free papers usually by the door as you leave.  And, most of them have personals, that you can peruse.  You'll have to learn the lingo of what all the abreviations mean.  I hope you find every happiness because I know you deserve it.....   Good Luck!|`|FrPVteUIaa	eek!!!!!!!!!!! holy crap!!!!!!! who would want to date u!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! that's scary!!!!!!!!!! here's a website to make u normal!|`|TyRfv0eoaa	The best way to meet someone is to get involved in your local LGBT community.

sE94HgDBaa	Society has become dangerously dependent on fuel (gas/oil). We each should look into implementing alternative energy sources (such as wind or solar energy for example) in our lives.

ef3e8a055f877ac48bf7cb67749b1830aa	Make it nice.<br>  <br>  How old are you first of all?  B/c you can get by with a lot more at less than 20 than after 21.<br>  <br>  You don't have to be an amazing cook to wow her.  Look up some of Rachael Ray's recipes.  She makes a great portabello sandwich for hiking.  I don't know how long the food will be outside but a general rule is to avoid mayo.  As this is right outside your house, I doubt it will be a problem.  <br>  <br>  A nice pasta salad is a great idea.  Nice for hot days.  You can buy the Pasta Salad boxes.  They are great and super easy.  Another idea is to go to your grocery store and buy a pint of their pasta salad but I like Pasta Salad boxes better. A Greek salad would be amazing.  <br>  <br>  You want to be a bit unique.  Ham or turkey sandwich just doesn't cut it.  Chicken salad on croissants though--even if you buy the Pillsbury croissants and chicken salad from the deli.<br>  <br>  Find a nice cool refreshing bottle of wine.  Wrap it in the icepack and wrap a towel around it.  This will help keep the cold from getting on the food as well.  I recommend a Pinot Grigio or a Reisling for an outdoor picnic but that's just me.<br>  <br>  Carry some hand foods--chips, cookies, something easy to handle.  Don't forget cups and silverware.  I can't begin to tell you the number of times I've had a picnic and the guy brought mash potatoes or pasta with no silverware to eat with.  Napkins.  Women like napkins.  And a blanket to put down on the ground.<br>  <br>  Good luck!  Sounds very romantic.|`|rThIVk2maa	Well, a picnic basket is always a good investment. For whatever reason, it's so much more romantic to have a lovely woven basket as opposed to a greasy sack from a fast food joint.<br>  <br>  Even if you are going to have fast food, no matter what kind of food, bring along two REAL plates, two wine glasses, and some actual silverware and linen napkins. Also have a nice picnic blanket. You won't BELIEVE how impressed she'll be and I guarantee you'll both enjoy the meal more when it's served on real china and silver instead of styrofoam and cardboard. <br>  <br>  Bring along a towel or plastic bag in which to place the dirty dishes (you can wash them later) and put them out of sight in your picnic basket when you're done eating so you two can just enjoy each others company.|`|AA10316420	One of my most favorite picnic memories was grabbing a bucket of KFC and the fixin's and heading to the park with our new neighbor's little girl.

Which one would be "The"?<br>  <br>  I think the good parts of church are how you can get together with others who share/support your faith for support, help, and just general friendship.<br>  <br>  The bad part: Sometimes it gets very political, you have to be tied to the right kind of people and there may be those who "don't belong".<br>  <br>  But this is just my observance.|`|T71SAa1Baa	Good:  you can get closer to God through studying His word<br>  <br>  Bad:  a lot of times churches are like high school and have cliques which can turn against each other and make it a very uncomfortable environment.|`|eLGDh1Hzaa	Tradition / Church Fathers<br>  I.

93eppE5Gaa	Hon, there is nothing wrong with uncertainty or having questions. Some people are firm in their beliefs, while others are still working things out, or are starting to do so.<br>  <br>  For quite a long time, I felt that my salvation wasn't 'real' or valid because I believed, accepted Jesus, and was saved. I continued  throughout my childhood (I accepted Christ at 11) content with my decision. Through the years, my faith became greater and grew stronger. But I still didn't think my salvation was exactly 'right', because I did not find Christ through some overwhelming or devastating life experience. No drugs, abuse, or alcohol. My home life was pretty okay, I was an excellent student, had friends, etc.<br>  <br>  It wasn't until I was in my mid to late 40's or so that I realized I had been very fortunate that I did not have to go through what many others did to eventually accept the gospel that leads to salvation, and to placing their faith in  Christ. I had been blessed to hear the truth and simply believe. But that's my experience.<br>  <br>  Its okay that you don't feel what others do. Your relationship with God is personal, and will ebb and flow periodically. Perhaps you feel (or don't feel) the way you do because you are either TRYING to feel as others do and/or are bothered because you don't.<br>  <br>  Don't worry about that at the moment. It is far more important to maintain a relationship with God. Take your concerns to him, tell him everything, and ask him to help. He will. Just hang in there.<br>  <br>  If you are unsure of your love for him at this time, that's okay. Try to consider and focus on his love for you. Consider Jesus' love and obedience to die on the cross, not for the world, but for you. If you were the only person on the planet who needed salvation, he would have given his life up just the same, and just for you.<br>  <br>  Consider the love that has no strings attached. It isn't what we do, but who we are, that makes us the recipients of God's love. We are his children, saved or not, and he loves us.<br>  <br>  But it is through salvation that we can have a relationship with him, because Christ bridged the chasm that existed because of sin.<br>  <br>  Take a long, serious look at what you know about God and Jesus, and then consider what you believe, what you are having trouble with, and  why.<br>  <br>  It seems you just need to figure out where to go from this point. From a knowledge of God and Jesus to a relationship with God through Christ.<br>  <br>  It also seems as if a few ideas you have, like mine about salvation, might be a bit off the mark.<br>  <br>  I don't know that the Bible was ever intended to make us feel love for God, but rather that it provides the framework and establishes the  foundation for a relationship based on love.<br>  <br>  Neither do I think that the purpose of church is to inspire or make us feel love for God.<br>  <br>  Much like love between  people, love for God has to grow. Our love for people usually begins with something that touches our heart, sensibilities, and/or emotions. (For  example, love can blossom because a person is kind, sweet, thoughtful, funny, etc.)<br>  <br>  Sure, there are those who experience love at first sight, that hits them like a lightning bolt, while others' love develops gradually as the couple's relationship and familiarity (trust, confidence, etc.) with each other increases. Here again, you may have overlooked some of the ways God has demonstrated his love for you. His love for us is the foundation for the love that we feel for him. <br>  <br>  Are you familiar with the parable of the mustard seed? If we have even that much faith, near-infinitesimal, we can move mountains. If that is all the love you can muster for God right now, he can work with that.<br>  <br>  You have received some excellent responses:<br>  <br>  Linda J -- Find a church where they talk about God as if He was actually interested in you. Trust me, those kind of churches exist, and they are not found in only one denomination.<br>  <br>  Jeanmarie's comments about worshipping on the Sabbath.<br>  <br>  Galaxie Girl' -- Maybe you should find a new church, one that fits you better.<br>  <br>  Jimmy J -- I would recommend that you find a grace-based Bible-believing church that preaches the gospel of grace. The kind of fellowship is secondary, as important as fellowship is, because ultimately what will make the deepest impact in your life is whether the teachings preached in the church unveil Christ - His Person, His beauty and glory, and the perfection of His finished work at the cross. <br>  <br>  I, too, would suggest that you consider a church that teaches of God's grace, and teaches that our relationship with God is less about what we do and more about who he is, what he can do, and has done.<br>  <br>  Also, I don't know what type of music you listen to, or what spiritual material you read besides your Bible, and I don't know what Bible you read. <br>  <br>  But I know that at certain points in my life when I feel separated from God, music helps. And certain verses, especially the promises, help.<br>  <br>  I grew up Baptist, but determined some years ago to not affiliate myself with any particular denomination, because I don't like the predominance differences that separated the body of Christ instead of there being more to unite us. So I now consider myself non-denominational. I also don't believe that a thing in the Bible was misinterpreted. That thought doesn't line up with the character of God, who does things decently and in order. <br>  <br>  The thing with the Bible is that the rules everyone should observe most Christians treat them like suggestions, and the things that are up to the individual, people treat them like they are mandatory. <br>  <br>  I believe that it is far more important to God THAT we go to church, than when. This is based on the simple observation that he works in the lives of those who attend on Saturday and those who attend on Sunday, and that those who attend on Sundays have not experienced any particular condemnation or correction from God for doing so.<br>  <br>  On the subject of the Mark of the Beast, that won't happen until the end of days, after the Antichrist has been revealed. The only way a person can be lost forever before that time, is to blaspheme the Holy Spirit.<br>  <br>  Our relationship with God should be based on love and faith, not fear. Reverence, definitely, but never fear. How can you love someone you are afraid of? Tell God of your fears, too, and ask him to show you the truth, and to calm your fears, To help you be peaceful in his care.<br>  <br>  As far as you reaching out to those of whom others disapprove:  Unless I'm mistaken, Jesus did that very thing. Wasn't he raked over the coals for hanging out with sinners? We are called to love others as ourselves. <br>   <br>  My suggestions:<br>  <br>  Read your Bible. Learn God's word for yourself, then you will be able to make decisions based on God's instructions according to his will. Read it prayerfully, asking God to speak to you, and reveal what he wants you to know for your life. Ask him for guidance at this time, and for direction.<br>  <br>  Ask him to lead you to the church he wants you to be in.<br>  <br>  Find and listen to music that speaks to you, and touches your heart. That ushers you into the presence of God. Allow God to minister to you this way. <br>  <br>  Actively seek the ways God is showing his love for you. Consider keeping a journal. Include verses, songs, and lyrics that speak to you and of his love. Note your prayers, and God's answers.<br>  <br>  Since you are home on Sundays, consider watching some spiritual programming, either on TV or online. TBN has a great lineup. Listen to some of the messages, see if one of the churches seems like a place you could call home, or at least gives you an idea of what the right church home for you would be like.<br>  <br>  I have verses to include, but I don't want you to close out this question before I get a chance to submit this. So I will add the verses in a few minutes.<br>  <br>  If you have any other questions, and feel I can be of some assistance, please do not hesitate to email me.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped.<br>  God bless you.<br>  ? ?|`|ec0b60fee25a982ef565651fd4f465d1aa	You poor dear.<br>  First take a deep breath. Remember when Jesus said let those without sin cast the first stone to that women caught in adultery? <br>  Look who Jesus hung out with-a fisherman who said he wasn't worthy and was sinful, a former tax collector who stole from people-some viewed him as scum and one women with questionable moral standards.<br>  We can love and show compassion to people since our sin is not better.<br>  <br>  You have been indoctrinated in religion and not with Jesus personally. He will draw you and you will find him-he knows you are searching.<br>  <br>  I left the church I grew up in and now belong to what's called "christian" church from the restoration movement. We practice what we preach. <br>  <br>  Now you have been taught to only worship in Saturdays this isn't new test teachings. I bet you belong to 7th day advan. <br>  <br>  Read what the new test says about this:<br>  Let no man judge you in respecting the sabbath!<br>  Col. 2:13-16: [God] kindly forgave us all our trespasses and blotted out the handwritten document against us, which consisted of decrees and which was in opposition to us . . . Therefore let no man judge you in eating and drinking or in respect of a festival or of an observance of the new moon or of a sabbath. (If a person was under the Mosaic Law and was judged guilty of profaning the Sabbath, he was to be stoned to death by the whole congregation, according to Exodus 31:14 and Numbers 15:32-35. Many who argue for sabbath keeping have reason to be glad that we are not under that Law. As shown in the scripture here quoted, an approved standing with God no longer requires observance of the sabbath requirement given to Israel.) <br>  The disciples worshipped on sunday.<br>  Acts 20:7 <br>  On the first day of the week we came together to break bread. Paul spoke to the people and, because he intended to leave the next day, kept on talking until midnight. <br>  <br>  1 Corinthians 16:2 <br>  On the first day of every week, each one of you should set aside a sum of money in keeping with his income, saving it up, so that when I come no collections will have to be made. <br>  <br>  ?|`|THRtsl83aa	Good for you, actually seeking out the truth.  You should be commended for your effort.<br>  <br>  I have a different background myself.  Grew up agnostic, recently became Christian.<br>  <br>  From what you've described, you sound like a very good Christian person, caring for others and all.  Personally, I don't think you have to go to church every week to be a "good Christian".  My husband and I are looking to find a church, since I would like to go, so that I can learn more about it.  I find for me, I have to keep renewing info in my mind, I have to keep it fresh, or my mind dumps it (you know, like a class in school that you never use again - I took thermodynamics in college, but I don't really remember any of it now).  I think going to church on a regular basis will help me to be a better person.  But that's what works for me.  It doesn't work for everyone.<br>  <br>  I also don't "feel" the love others talk about.  I think it's because there's so much I don't know about Christianity, that I'm still really confused about a lot of things.  I have just accepted the idea that Jesus died for our sins to save us, and I try to live a good life as best as I can.  Perhaps you don't "feel" it because you also have questions about Christianity.<br>  <br>  Maybe you should find a new church, one that fits you better.  I admit, I'm not sure exactly how to do that, but you probably have a better idea than me.<br>  <br>  I think you should remember that Jesus wanted us to live good lives, and I think you understand that by you saying you want to help others.  Perhaps you could join a volunteer group, and by helping others every day, you will feel a renewed love of Jesus.<br>  <br>  Sorry if this isn't helpful, I did my best.  Good luck with everything!|`|FOzN3xwzaa	The bottom  line is to understand the Jesus loves YOU, and He died for your sins, to pay for your sins, and then He rose from the dead  :) <br>  <br>  The only way to get into heaven and to avoid being sent to hell, is by believing that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for all our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead. Believe this and you will be in heaven and not hell, no matter what! :)|`|H7jy99NOaa	It seems to me that you feel inadequate in comparison to all those ecstatic or seemingly perfect people around you, or like CJ above here, who make it all seem so simple. It isn't. They are either liars or self-deluding, and either way it's dangerous and confusing to REAL people such as yourself. I think you are on the right track. Of course helping others gives you a good feeling, and pretending in church doesn't. That shows you're a real person, in touch. Don't change, you're fine the way you are.|`|ljzb6fZBaa	You have some good answers there, sister, such as JeanMarie's answer. I believe Christianity is a personal relationship between you and Jesus, so it is not a religion based on do's and dont's. It is based on believing, and right believing will produce right living, according to God's words. How you live your Christian life would be based on your personal relationship with our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, not based on how other Christians live their lives. Just as Jesus said to Peter, "You follow Me", we need not worry or be unduly concerned about other Christians - "For if we live, we live to the Lord; and if we die, we die to the Lord. Therefore, whether we live or die, we are the Lord's." (Romans 14:8) :)<br>  <br>  I would recommend that you find a grace-based Bible-believing church that preaches the gospel of grace. The kind of fellowship is secondary, as important as fellowship is, because ultimately what will make the deepest impact in your life is whether the teachings preached in the church unveil Christ - His Person, His beauty and glory, and the perfection of His finished work at the cross. The gospel of grace has been transforming people's lives from the inside out, and is still transforming lives today. Whenever the apostle Paul preached the gospel, those who heard the message and believed were saved, and their lives were blessed. Paul preached the forgiveness of sins and justification by faith in Jesus, and "on the next Sabbath almost the whole city came together to hear the word of God... Now when the Gentiles heard this, they were glad and glorified the word of the Lord." (Acts 13:38-48)<br>  <br>  The gospel of grace glorifies Jesus and His finished work, whereas religion glorifies man and his good works. Man hates the gospel of grace because it makes everything of Jesus and nothing of man. Paul said he was not ashamed of the gospel, for it is the power of God to salvation for those who believe, because the gospel reveals the righteousness of God that is given as a gift to sinful man through faith in Christ. (Romans 1:16-17) The gospel means "good news", in fact it means "too good to be true" in the original Greek language. "Grace" means unearned, undeserved, unmerited favour of God. The good news then is that we are saved by grace through faith, not by works, lest anyone should boast. (Ephesians 2:8) We don't deserve to be saved because we were sinners, but God's grace is for the undeserving. Therefore, we simply come to God just the way we are and receive His gift of salvation through faith in Jesus Christ, as the scripture says, "But to him who does not work but believes on Him who justifies (or makes righteous) the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness." (Romans 4:5) And again, "that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved." (Romans 10:9-10)<br>  <br>  The gospel is about the message of the cross, which centres on Jesus' death, burial and resurrection, and what it means to us today. There is so much more to share, but I do not wish to overwhelm you with the teachings I have received in my own church. By no means am I saying I am attending a perfect church - no church is perfect, but I believe in attending a church that is Christ-centred, Christ-exalting instead of man-centred, and I believe there are such churches around the world. For now, just know that now that you are in Christ, you are a new creation. (2 Corinthians 5:17) You are the righteousness of God in Christ. (2 Corinthians 5:21) Believing that Jesus died for your sins is no small matter - it is a very important first step you have taken, for that's how you have received the Holy Spirit. (Ephesians 1:13) The Holy Spirit abides with you and dwells in you forever. (John 14:16-17)<br>  <br>  You may like to visit my church website to read about the gospel of grace of Christ. Again, it may not answer every question you have about Christianity. The Lord encourages us to test all things and hold fast what is good. (1 Thessalonians 5:21) Listen to the Holy Spirit of truth who dwells inside you - does what you read and hear bears witness with the truth?<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.newcreation.org.sg/aboutus/we_believe/ourlordjesus.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.newcreation.org.sg/aboutus/we...</a><br>  <br>  You are welcome to read the daily devotionals, and listen to the audio and video messages preached by my senior pastor. :)<br>  <br>  May the Lord guide you in understanding more about your faith in Jesus Christ. We are all at different stages of Christian growth, and it is alright to ask questions like this - we thank God for the Bible, the Holy Spirit and the body of Christ to encourage and build up one another in the Word, so thank God we don't have to figure the Christian life out on our own. God bless you richly, sister.|`|xZ1GD4zbaa	First, do you know God loves you?<br>  Seriously, do you KNOW how much He loves you?<br>  <br>  He created you just like you are; down to the last freckle, and He thinks you are wonderful! He is proud of what He made and He wants you to know that.<br>  <br>  God doesn't need you to please Him, He wants you to know Him. <br>  <br>  Find a church where they talk about God as if He was actually interested in you. Trust me, those kind of churches exist, and they are not found in only one denomination.<br>  <br>  When was the last time you talked to God?<br>  <br>  Maybe it's time to start looking for Him yourself.|`|PwvVoWFYaa	I would just like to encourage you to keep growing! Your being to lay the foundation you know God and Jesus are real, there love for you is real. <br>  understanding will come with growth. AS ONE OF GODS CHILDREN WE ARE CALLED TO LOVE ALL PEOPLE.... this is a charge that Jesus gave to us and yet most christians struggle with this one. Love is a fruit of the spirit.  I wold also like to point out that feelings / emotions are usually the things that get in the way of our relationships. because feelings and emotions are wishy washy and irrationial and leads plenty of people a stray. The enemmy loves to play on our feelings and emmotions. <br>  <br>  I would also like to say that worship is not just for whatever day you attend service but its everyday continuesly. like talking to your best friend - you wouldnt just chat for two hours once a week but all the time. <br>  I would also recomend that your bible is at least King James version. Keep on pressing through dont put your trust in man because people will dissappont but God is always faithful!! <br>  <br>  God Bless you and let the Holly Sporot Guide your steps!!

There are a lot more chapters and verses mentioned in the below website along with music, speeches and praise and worship.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com    Jesus is God. He is alive forever.    The questions usually asked are:-    1) Did Jesus really exist?  2) Is Jesus God?  3) If Jesus is God, then why did He keep praying to the Father in Heaven? How can the Father and Jesus be one God? Why did Jesus have to suffer on the Cross?  4) What is the Holy Spirit?  5) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet? Why should I see him as God?      It would not be possible to give a short answer to these questions .    I suggest you visit the below website.    After visiting the below website, you would get a lot of answers.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com    1.Thomas calls Jesus God in John 20:28 (Note, Thomas addresses Jesus  specifically.)  2. Jesus is God in Heb. 1:8  3. John the apostle states that Jesus was the Word which was God that became  flesh (John 1:1-14)  4. The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as  "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT  (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)  6. Jesus said that He and the Father are One (John 10:30), that caused the Pharisees to  claim that Jesus was making Himself out to be God.  7. Jesus knew all things (John 21:17)  8. Jesus knew all men (John 16:30)  9. Jesus is everywhere (Matt. 28:20)  10. Jesus Christ, dwells in you (Col. 1:27)  11. Jesus is the exact representation of the Nature of God (Heb. 1:3)  12. Jesus is eternal (Micah 5:1-2)  13. Jesus gives eternal life (John 10:27-28)  14. Jesus is our only Lord and Master (Jude 4)  15. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6)  16.

In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts  7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father  that was seen in the OT (John 6:46).

If Jesus would have done so, he would have conceded to Satan which would have caused Satan to be his GOD.     Jesus HAD to die, and he was determined to die, because without death, there could be no forgiveness, and also he could not send us the blessed holy spirit.    The horror of death loses its sting when we realize that death in the flesh while we live upon this earth is not always going to be a peaceful passage. It is a violent realm in which physical bodies and put against spiritual.    Jesus died the death of a saint, who was under vicious attack from a murderous demonic angel. He died and passed the test, and now he sits in the heavenly realms standing in the way of the sinner.

AA11648578	Muhammad could not have worshiped the God of Abraham if Islam is correct the words of the prophets and the word of God was corrupt.  How God chose a prophet who could not have known him and had no way of testing the revelation he was receiving from a spirit he could not have known and first considered a demon...is totally beyond me.  I guess God didn't think it was important that a prophet know him or have any way of verifying his revelation.. so he doesn't mind that Muhammad would not have really known if this revelation was from God or Satan...You would think All knowing God would have planed this a little better..the Qu'ran says Muhammad is anounced by the previous scriptures..Islam says these scriptures are corrupt..so you tell me how God proves a prophet with corrupt scriptures.    This is just some of the many, many issues with Islam...It agrees with the prophets but the prophets words are corrupt.  The Allah of Islam is the God of Abraham but he doesn't even agree with God's righteous nature but agrees with the serpent in the garden that the God of Abraham calls Satan.  The God of Abraham always proved his prophets and no prophet could anounce himself..until Muhammad...|`|6100f239c1abd562ada33e5323d1c871aa	As salaamu 'alaikym, my friend.    Insha'Allah, they practiced polytheism (the worship of many gods) and idol worship as well as a host of superstitions.    One particularly distressing aspect of these practices was the murder of infant girls who were often buried alive.  Such is spoken of and condemned in the Holy Qur'an.    Groups from different cities within Arabia would place idols of their gods in and around the sacred Kabaah to which they made yearly pilgrimages and which became a lucrative business in Makaah (Mecca) of that time.

In his personal life, the prophet shines as a man of high character, integrity, and humanity. He lived a simple Spartan life, exemplifying the truth of the dignity of labour. In his later life, he felt that he had a mission to deliver to humanity in general, and to his own Arab people in particular, and he set about implementing this mission and succeeded, before his death, in uniting the Arab people through a religio-politico ideology and making them conscious of their destiny to be a civilizing force in the world.|`|a6f5efb2cbade02a525b433574402dc8aa	Christians, Jews, Zoroastrians and pagans.

Adam and Howa(Eve) were muslims and so were their kids and the prophets after them,and the people who followed the prophets.    When the prophet Muhammad(pbuh) didn't know he was a prophet ,most of the people in Arabia worshiped idols and based their religion on that.  Muhammad (pbuh) new it was wrong and went to the high hills and prayed to whom ever created him,in that place he later on received his message that he was a  prophet.    SO later on in his prophet-hood he invited and taughtt Islam to the idol worshiperss, and most of them accepted it,who then became muslims.    Some others he taught were the jews and christains.    hope I helped!

mfSp38yzaa	"Pray without ceasing."    Assuming you mean God when you say "Allah." And if you're thinking of becoming Buddhist, what does Christian prayer have to do with it? Buddhism is not a Christian denomination.    EDIT: OK, I get it. You think all religions are a joke. So far we have Christians, Muslims, Buddhists, Hindus, and Mormons. Who's next? Cause you're JUST so funny...|`|1UokhVRXaa	0|`|hiCSVwchaa	One of us is confused...|`|RC1r1tsHaa	RAmen...    All hail the FSM!|`|i48kxrbaaa	None.|`|UmdKqP5kaa	Ok, we know we don't create each other and we don't come to this world from nowhere because when we die we must be going somewhere as well, hence there must be God, if there were many Gods, they would have fought over what to be created and what not to be, probably over who to die and who to live at the same time... so it's gotta be one God... if that God created us then there must be a reason... could we figure it out on our own? God made it easy and sent us messengers and prophets to show us the way and tell us why... so all the messengers and all the religions are from the same only God, so they've got to be complementary to each other, not opposing each other!!! then God must have said His final words in the last message, what is the last message? and how do we know it's the last one? I guess that would be the religion that believes in all messengers and all books equally... is there such religion? actually yes, Islam does :)  A True Muslim (man or woman) gets his reward for obeying Allah's orders (Allah means The God in Arabic) by going to heaven, where he/she are indulged forever in all the good things that were on earth and more, things no one ever dreamt of or heard about. The Holy Quran tells Muslims (men and women) there will be good food, good wine and sex in heaven for all, but not in the bestial way you may think of, but rather in a way that is satisfactory for everyone and better than what was on earth. Heaven is no heartbreak or injustice land.  True Muslims are no terrorists, and Islam never calls for that, Islam means peace, it bans violence unless you were fought so you fight back, it only doesn't require Muslims to be cowards, and true Muslims understand this very well and never attack civilians.   Islam is the only religion that accepts freedom of religion and asks men to treat women gently like queens.   It's all in the Holy Quran and the right teachings of prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him).  If some people behave otherwise, then it's because people behaviour doesn't necessarily reflect the rulings of their religion always, for example, we can't (and don't) judge Christianity by Hitler or Madonna.  And that is another reason why there is heaven and hell after we die, heaven for the obedient and hell for the disobedient and/or oppressor, it's all going to be decided on the day of resurrection and judgement.  To be a Muslim, you must believe God is only one with no spouses or offspring, believe in his angels (servants not males or females), believe in all his religions, messangers and books equally, the day of judgement, heaven and hell and that everything is in God's hands and because of his will (good or bad).  Muslims believe God is the only divine who never dies, the creator who deserves to be worshiped, all prophets who came to earth are human messangers sent by him.  Muslims don't deny christianity, judaism, Jesus or Moses. They believe in them as the noble prophets and messangers of God, love and respect them so much.  We believe the birth of Jesus (messanger of God) was a miracle from God to us, being born by a mother only and with no father. God is the creator, he can do anything.  We believe Jesus (peace be upon him) is NOT dead till today; he wasnt even murdered or crucified as most people think. God (most glorified) made the man who betrayed Jesus be killed instead by switching their looks for a moment. Jesus was left up to live in heaven until the end of days when he will come back to earth again, with no new teachings or messages but just to make justice prevail instead of oppression, fight the imposter who will claim to be God and (most important) to perform his last prayer with the Muslims announcing he's too a follower of the last prophet (Muhammad) as all people should... then he really dies like other Prophets and be buried (peace be upon them all). So we're waiting for you Jesus, Messenger of God, to bring the world peace and pray with us. Thats what prophet Muhammad told us and this is what I believe in, Im a Muslim  so how do we know it's true? what is said in the last message and what should we do? read the following, and you'll figure out for yourself:|`|ask4MdtEaa	As much as you want.|`|sUVpbKDDaa	Christians do not pray to Allah.

SsEAvhs7aa	That girl is out to hurt herself. He will never be what she expects from him. That guy is not asking her to marry him, he's asking her to cover for him. That's not the same thing. So he'll probably bring boyfriends or flings home or go with them somewhere else, and he will not be the one who's dishonest either, since she knew he was gay and that she was a cover from the start. She'll end up really hurt, because I'm sure what she expects is for him to change. But he won't. And as soon as he is more comfortable with his sexuality, when he tells his family to accept him or f*ck off, he will get a divorce.    She is not ready to give up? Okay then, let her break her own nose! Why do you ask us about our opinion on that matter if you know she'll do the exact opposite anyway?|`|QmIK2vgqaa	I would make sure she married him and had lots of confused kids that got into drugs and goth clothing.

How can she make love and have a baby with someone who will always be wishing he were with someone else?  What he needs is to be brave and tell his family and what she needs is to be there for him and date other people. What ever they decide i wish them both weel and good luck|`|Yi0sksmJaa	He only wants to be friends with her in the context of the marriage. He doesn't want to be her husband in any other way. He will always be gay and he prefers to have relationships with men.

How can this turn out well? It would be unfair to both of them.     She would wind up hating him and not loving him.     This isn't taking a risk - it's unhealthy, masochistic and really, really stupid.|`|Lt9VAJdGaa	Noo. She shouldn't marry him. Because she most likely wouldn't be happy after awhile. And his mother shouldn't care.. no matter how religious. And she might be hurt at first, but she'll eventually accept him. But no, her marrying him would be a bad idea.|`|0p9CZHPVaa	No, in this situation marriage does not sound like a good idea. It is very easy for a woman to have an intense relationship with a gay male. No matter how gay he may be he is still going to have his masqulin tendancey, which she will be attracted to. But in the end he is only going to be unhappy. It is not that he wont love her. It is that he won't love he intimatly like a husband/wife (or husband/husband) should. Best wishes!|`|8UtLYssXaa	WHAT?!!!! Ofcourse not! she shouldn't sacrifice her whole life.... and even if she did marry him, one day she'll say that she had enough of this (half) life she's living and she'll get a divorce.  If you ask me, I'll say why start something you know is going to fail eventually.|`|dOGwA6Vjaa	That sounds like a horrible idea. In the end both will wind up getting hurt. If he is truly gay, he isn't about to give up his gay lifestyle and sexual preferences because she loves him. In reality, he should accept himself for who he is and present himself to his family that way. If he continues to hide, he will never be happy.|`|RSv2E2KNaa	No.|`|iaoOx4xjaa	Well things like this are never ever black and white so a few things to consider    1 if he is gay he cant switch it off, he will always be gay and will always be attracted the men  2 is he wanting to get married so he has an alibi for his gay secret life or because he loves her?  3 does she really want to have suspicion hanging over their relationship forever?    My First boyfriend dumped me, got married and had a kid, I never heard from him in about 6 years then out of the blue he adds me to yahoo messenger and tells me he wants to meet up and continue what we started previously, though he was still married and raising 2 kids he said he was deeply unhappy but for financial reasons could never leave them.    So she needs to ask herself the above questions and think hard about what it means to be gay and if she really loved him then maybe being there for him as a friend who knows he is gay will be more rewarding than getting involved with someone who may hurt her deeply when society catches up and being gay isn't as awful as this guy seems to think it will before his family,|`|IRTSahGiaa	If there is no chance of his leaving his boyfriend...I think there is a big problem, could she live with him as a friend forever without any contact? it's better they don't marry, unless the boy consults a Phsyco Doctor and looks for cure of his situation...  It's very tough situation, I give  50/50 chance|`|Ox9PAq9Saa	I don't think a straight woman should marry a gay man. What if in the future he or she finds someone they are truly head over heals for? Then they can't be with them because they are married to someone they don't sexually prefer. He is gay. Be his best friend. She will get attached and will in the end have a broken heart. He can't be there for her the way she wants. You should marry someone you physically are attracted to and emotionally feel safe, secure, and fulfilled.|`|aDXsUPYRaa	That's stupid  don't standing there and feeling bad for herself  go out and get a new one|`|swkhohjgaa	No. Not a good idea.|`|9a2101ed2f6c0a177128332796fe6a28aa	For me, I will say it depends on both of them.

Be sorry, pray for help, and have the Faith to forgive yourself if God has.    You don't want to teach your child that if she ever finds herself on the wrong road to have a Self-Hate Party. Teach her that you get back on the right road and tell the devil to kiss your ***.|`|Eo7KcX3Waa	You need Jesus, and when you call on Him be real in your heart, and He will come to rescue you...|`|c1Dpi0eyaa	Get some therapy or look up AA.|`|AA12193600	Figure out what it is about your home life that makes you wish to be elsewhere.  If everything was beautiful about "home life" you'd be there instead of a bar.  Begin by really being honest with yourself--what is it you like--what is it you dislike about your home life.  Assuming you are truly honest with yourself--there will be things you don't like.  (To much housework with no help, husband doesn't display the interest you'd like, and so on).  Once you figure out what's really bothering you--sit down with your husband and have an honest talk with him.  Assuming once again that there is something you don't like--don't attack when discussing--tell your husband how things make you feel.  People can argue with "you don't pay attention"==but can't argue with "I know you've had a hard day and your tired, but when you don't seem to see me it makes me feel like you don't want to be around me-and so I go where people seem to be happy to see me".  Doesn't sound like you have a drinking problem so much as running away from issues which need to be discussed.  Open and honest communication in a marriage is the best thing in the world--let him know how you feel--what's bothering you.|`|IBZfDuYjaa	It helps to have an "accountability partner" - this is someone who is also trying to change for the better and who you can pair up with to chat and share your successes and shortfalls.    I would say you are 75% of the way toward solving your problem.  You already recognize that it's unhealthy, you recognize that it makes you and your loved ones unhappy, and you are rebelling against this lifestyle and habit.    Spring forward off of this momentum!  Establish habits that will trend you toward a happier domestic life.  Create a checklist of things that you want to do every evening - such as, play a game with your daughter, kiss your husband, read a chapter in a book you like, start the laundry for tomorrow.  Every night, when you're tempted to "escape" and head out for some party-fun, run through your check-list *FIRST*.  (Don't say you can't go, just go through your checklist first).  I would be willing to bet that by the time you go through your list of pleasant and productive things to do, that the urge to escape will have dissipated.  If worst comes to worst, call your accountability partner.  And when you stumble and fall, don't beat yourself up.  Try to learn from your stumble, and see how you can improve the next night.  Make a game of it.    I'm not going to throw Christianity at you because I see that many answerers have already done so.  However, if you do have a tie to God already, it doesn't hurt to include that in your evening routine.  You can add a 10 minute devotional time to your list of things to do - just something to re-orient you spiritually and help you to keep your life in balance.    Another suggestion is to check out this website:  http://www.flylady.net  ; Flylady is Marla Cilley who offers a way to help you get from CHAOS to control through the use of simple routines, established slowly in what she calls "babysteps".  She also sends out essays designed to help you become more productive, peaceful and empowered by helping you to center yourself mind, spirit and body.  I highly recommend her. :)    I think your flight into the bars is an escape from something that you don't like in your own life, and which you feel you cannot control... so you escape.  Perhaps you might consider seeking the advice of a therapist, a trusted mature friend, or a church elder to help you to narrow down what is really bugging you on the inside.      We all have stuff in our lives that we don't like.  You are not alone in this, not by any stretch of the imagination.  You are not *BAD* ... and by taking the right steps, you will find yourself making fewer unhealthy choices and more healthy ones.    Good luck and I hope that you are able to resolve your situation to the happiness of you and those you love!    And to reiterate - you are already 75% there, girl!  You can easily beat this thing. :)|`|AA10287238	Why are you asking this in Religion & Spirituality? These people here can't help you.

And the fourth river is Euphrates. 2:15 And the LORD God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it. 2:16 And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat: 2:17 But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die. 2:18 And the LORD God said, It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him an help meet for him.

duk4iAgUaa	I suppose it's because many teaching practices (enforced in CA--the late 1980s and early 1990s) enforced inventive spelling.  My 29-year-old sister is a "victim" of this terrible teaching method--that educators were basically required to teach this!  <br>  <br>  Another thought might be the interest, or obsession, with video games and lack of reading interest among youth.|`|V1dNF1vCaa	I can't stand it.

IB2V5t1Oaa	Why do you lose your patience with her? Is she sloppy and you have to clean up after her? <br>  <br>  I would speak to her so that you can discuss your issues with her. Maybe she's not aware that what she's doing is bothering you so once it's out in the open, she can avoid it.|`|AA10316420	COUNT!  It does work. When you get those thoughts in your head, start counting and at the same time ask if this is really a bug out problem.  If it is then think of a way to approach your roommate and tell her so.  Like, "hey chickie, I just want to let you know that if you put the peanut butter back up instead of leaving it on the counter, we won't get any critters in the kitchen, I heard ants are going to be bad this year."  Or whatever the problem may be.  Sometimes others might not know there is a problem unless you tell them.|`|scyLaz0saa	First Deep breath.<br>  Second Address situations when you are calmer if that means take 5 minutes to calm down before you do that do that.  Always use "I" Statements.  (I.E.  I feel that when you make a mess you should clean it up)  <br>  Third try meditation during the day.  It may help center yourself and add you in the day.  <br>  Fourth Work out.  Get out those issues in a positive way (plus you get into shape and that isn't a bad thing).|`|Xnhm6bWnaa	get a new roommate <br>  <br>  or just call dibs on all your stuff|`|cVVvHNXSaa	I'm sorta in the same position as you.

I have no patience as well. I could look at her and just get annoyed on spot,ugh. <br>  <br>  Just take deep breaths slowly it will help you relax. Do something to keep your mind off of her or whatever she's doing to annoy you. Just leave, go for a walk or a drive around the block. Why I say this is because I think sooner or later you're gonna lose it with this person so its better to find something to do than bother with her. And if possible try talking to her about what's annoying you, it wouldn't hurt to try. If that doesn't work find a new roomate because some people are stubborn and wouldn't change their discouraging ways for no one.|`|AA11108306	First take a deep breath.  Second, tell yourself an argument or a fight is not worth it.  It'll make you feel even worse.  Unless, of course, it really is worth it.  Like you're fighting for something right.  But if it's something petty, I have the petty people have their way.  It's just like dealing with crazy drivers.  Lastly, if it gets too annoying for you.  Then, perhaps it's time to just move.

If it works out cool, if not move on until you find the one thats right for you, he's out there. Meet new people, just be weary of the fact that all guys are trying to get laid. This is ok only if you are ready if not only take it as far as your ready for, one step at a time. But with the right person a relationship can be a wonderful thing. If you do decide to be sexualy active get on the pill and make sure your partner has a condom. This way you can finish school and have a future before you have a baby.

rThIVk2maa	Well, he is probably there because he has struggled with controlling some aspect of his personality. You should not talk about this to your coworkers, and it's too bad you already have, because it's not their business and can harm what little dignity he has built up. <br>  <br>  However, something you can say next time you talk to him, because you are in a position to help, is this "Josh, I just want to make it clear that I am so proud of you for all the work you've done and am so excited that you are leaving soon to have your own life. However, you must understand that you have to get permission to kiss people, no matter how overcome by happiness you are. I am flattered that you feel I have helped you so much and I am pleased to call you a friend, so that is why I need to reiterate this, so you don't accidentally offend somebody who might not understand you like me."<br>  <br>  Said pleasantly and with a handshake pact at the end, you can extract a promise from him to make you proud and be careful of what he does. Of course, you're the best judge of how to alter those words, but it's up to you to help him not offend others.|`|IB2V5t1Oaa	You sort of returned the kiss? Hmmm? Did you have feelings for him too or did you just do it out of instinct? He obviously has feelings for you. :)<br>  <br>  There's no way to prepare yourself for these types of situations which is why you were in shock when it happened. Just let it be...especially cause you said that he's harmless.|`|oojO4WAraa	The school should have taught you that it is inappropriate to kiss patients.  You encountered him in a group home setting in your role as a student of psychology.  Ethics say you should have pulled away and not returned the kiss.  You should discuss this with your instructor.|`|Xxt4pEyEaa	Wow. Was he cute? I sure it was harmless and genuine.|`|Xg3iry5qaa	You need to tell you supervisor - or whom ever is authority.  Dont feel bad for returning the kiss - you were shocked and unsure what to do.  Anyway - hope that he doesnt coctact you, but if he does you need to be VERY direct with him and let him know that your not interested in a relationship of any sorts.  <br>  <br>  ...unless you are, then thats a whole different situation.|`|O2d1XQPwaa	It's kind of sweet in a totally inappropriate violation of ethics and 'you should never let it happen again' way. I'd just look at it as a mistake you made and learn from it. That's the hardest part of being in the doctor role, not letting your feelings come into the way of your work. You've watched grey's anatomy, right? that's like the whole basis of the show.|`|scyLaz0saa	I would put the situation down so that no charges are brought against you for sexual harassment or anything. (I know that sounds extreme but I am always a person that plans for the worse and hopes for the best.)  Then I would just keep your distance.  If he contacts you, you need to end it.  Sometimes patients start having feelings for their doctors.  I know your just a intern but still.  Good luck to you.|`|HlUEFypHaa	If that's all it ever is, then it's kind of cute/sweet in a way.  Honestly anything more than that (including him lurking around and/or showing stalker tendencies) would make me very nervous.  I'd say the right way to handle it would be to ignore it, BUT to be extra wary for a while.|`|Ybk0wwQZaa	Well, if it were me, I would've noticed the guy coming in for a kiss. I don't like people being that close to my face. I definitely would've never kissed him back! I would just forget the whole thing ever happened. You'll laugh about it someday.|`|MFDlhwxxaa	ooooooh damn too bad for you|`|77Ng0HT8aa	It's not *that* crazy really. It's very common for clients/ patients to feel an attachment with someone who is in the helper role. You're a girl, around his age and you talk to him and make him feel better.. He prob trusts you more than the 50 year old psychiatrist dude/ therapist and confides in you more b/c you're his age. <br>  <br>  However, it was a little rude of him to kiss you but he could have just been thanking you for your help and figured he'd never see you again. Don't beat yourself up over it, it's not that insane.. Kisses aren't that big of a deal. just never let it happen again.. if you want to be a therapist, you'll have to learn how to separate your personal life from your job. You're still young, you'll make mistakes..|`|AA10316420	Try to remain professional in your dealings with people like this.  This is your "job" keep it separate from your personal life.  Since you are new to this field and still learning you are going to make mistakes.  Just try harder and never let it happen again.  We all make mistakes we are human.  You have chosen a profession to help people deal with problems not add to them.  Try to remember little clues like that and perhaps you won't find yourself in a situation like that again.|`|AunZaJOEaa	He probably just thought of it as a kind thank you gesture...still very awkward|`|ef3e8a055f877ac48bf7cb67749b1830aa	PJ is right.  You should have taken classes in ethics.  You want to work in psychiatry you have to be a voice of reason, of strength, or control.  They need to see you as a rock--not as some kid their own age that they can fondle whenever they wish.<br>  <br>  You are dealing with unstable minds here.  You cannot be perceived as inappropriate with clients.  You cannot even put yourself in the situation that is inappropriate.  And most importantly you shouldn't tell your coworkers.  Not only have you lost their respect and come across as a promiscuous schoolgirl, but your boss is likely to hear it from the rumor mill and not from your own lips.<br>  <br>  In a psych clinic, you could get in a lot of trouble by doing things like this.  It can be held over your head for a long time that you walk such a fine line between client who you don't hold at a respectful distance, and not a client who you make out with.  It's hard at your age not to think of these clients as people your own age--b/c they are.  But you are trying to be a doctor, you need to be the senior role model here.  You need to be the authoritative figure, not the sister they exchange eye rolling looks with when the parent turns their back. <br>  <br>  If I were you, I'd talk to some people in a senior position about how to mentally get yourself in a position to deal with the patients you are dealing with.  How do you come across as mature, untouchable, and respected?  As a doctor you will have patients who are your age too.  You will have some who are much cuter than this guy and much more aggressive.  You'll need to have the control to handle it.|`|DZzBfzVeaa	Well it was a little rude of him to kiss you, even if he wasnt a patient anymore. It was a little unperfessional. Im assuming by this that means he likes you? if you know he is harmless and you like him back then go for it but if you dont like him like that then just ignore it and pretend it didnt happen. if he contacts you again, politely tell him that you are not intersted but maybe as friends?
06513454f057ec526caa7fcd77f5e44baa	Richard Dawkins is one of my heroes, in the same vein as Carl Sagan but refreshingly much more outspoken about the absurdity of religious belief. He speaks as well as he writes, and I have had the pleasure of talking with him personally. <br>  <br>  It's laughable how some people call him "strident," as he is one of the most polite people on the planet! While personality has nothing to do with the value of his ideas (which is considerable), he is the whole package, a charismatic ambassador of reason in a world desperately in need of them.<br>  <br>  He has two websites, www.richarddawkins.net and .com. On them you can find articles, videos, and a discussion board where people say pretty much anything they want, often contrasting starkly with Dawkins' own more mature approach to things (such is the price of free speech).<br>  <br>  Besides Dawkins, Christopher Hitchens is a delightfully no-holds-barred debater and writer, and Sam Harris and Daniel Dennett are out there swinging too. Michael Shermer is the publisher of Skeptic magazine, PZ Myers is a biology professor from Minnesota with a hilarious blog called Pharyngula where he slices and dices religion without mercy, Pat Condell makes his own videos which dismantle Islam in a very humorous manner (which Muslims just don't get, of course), and from all these places there are links to the rest of the rational universe.|`|KgCUpE5naa	Dawkins is the the Atheist movement like Poe is to the Gothic Literature subculture; over-played and stale. ALthough he has some good ideas, they simply are all ideals that have been thought up before and given a fresh coat of paint.<br>  <br>  Not only that, but his arguments are worded in such a way that anyone with common sence could easily creat a valid argument against them.|`|leCcd0rfaa	I proposed to him once.<br>  He's still thinking about it.|`|g4nlUfmeaa	I've only read a little of The God Delusion (well, listened to it on audiotape while in my girlfriend's car) and what I've heard of it (and read on his blog and elsewhere) is pretty good.

AA11058044	Science deals with describing reality.<br>  <br>  Reality has a well known anti-Christian bias.<br>  <br>  Therefore, Christians assume that science is anti-Christian, and therefore "atheist" (which their pastors told them means "hating God").|`|dd1bce7bddbe2e3eb6a98a7a76a80171aa	You seem to think "facts" are opposed to Creationism, when in reality facts can have multiple interpretations. It is the underlying philosophy of the science that determines how the facts are interpreted. Naturalism is currently the accepted philosophy, therefore God is NEVER an acceptable explanation, even if it were true. I also like how you try to repudiate stereotypes with more stereotypes. But what do I know? I only listen to Fox News and my pastor. Derrrr....<br>  <br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  Yaay. It's learning time. You are now going to learn the definition of a fact! Did anyone observe the creation of the moon? No? Then how do they know what happened? They certainly look at data about the moon. It's composition, it's orbit, its size maybe, all of which are FACTS. But in order to come up with a plausible scenario of what happened, they MUST use assumptions. And the question is, what is the basis for those assumptions. I am not saying that evidence doesn't strongly point in one direction, or you can't REAONABLY assume one thing or the other, but you must understand the difference between that, and a cold hard fact. That is what I mean when I say facts are not in opposition to Creationism, popular interpretion of them is. I've read both sides, and the facts fit my assumptions just fine.|`|4sUek7ugaa	They think that anyone who doesn't worship a deity must worship something, and that something must be science.|`|lOzbR6tvaa	Remove any reference to theism and you would get them immediately committed to an asylum.|`|YyEEAJBkaa	I am pro insane asylum for people like that|`|Ynsow6qbaa	I do not know, why do you capitalize atheist?|`|79529314dfb5ac7be366558924c3393baa	>Do these people not realize that Atheism has been around just as much as Theism?<br>  <br>  ...except that it hasn't. Before about 300 or 400 years ago, atheism was virtually nonexistent, and no self-respecting person would ever call themselves an atheist for fear of being ridiculed, persecuted, or even put to death.<br>  <br>  >Why must Christians become angry when Science simply gives the facts?<br>  <br>  Because christianity itself doesn't hold up very well against the facts. The christians want to preserve their own preconceived ideas regarding the existence of God, the creation of the world, etc, and so they have to reject more and more scientific discoveries in order to accomplish this as time goes on.<br>  <br>  >Will people always be so self deluded that they can't even face reality?<br>  <br>  No.|`|AA11097612	Science is the atheist's "god" that they worship.  Science doesn't present facts to which Christians object.  Facts are facts.  What Christian's object to is the erroneous opinions that atheists come to as they misinterpret those facts and then claim their opinions to be facts as well.  Atheists, in general, are arrogant assuming facts not in evidence (just a brief scope of your "question" is evidence of that), make condescending comments on things of which they have no understanding as if they know anything at all.  <br>  <br>  I am honestly amazed at how atheists believe that they are any smarter than the slime from which they believe they came.  When atheists become as critical of their own religion as they are about other religions and stop being so insulting I might have more of a tendency to listen to their arguments.|`|Ipq6Bvh3aa	I understand your frustration with the Christian need to attack scientific knowledge.  However, I think that you have a very narrow idea of what theism is.  You shouldn't define "religion" based upon the concept of some narrow minded people.<br>  <br>  Buddhist philosophy can be understood to be a form of theism.|`|pxgIsS0Maa	Because atheists tote science as the reason why they believe what they believe.  Basically it is a matra we have swallowed.  It is the false idea of "knowledge" that people crave... and as we know, knowledge puffs up, but love builds up.  Since people don't want to put their faith in God... it is only natural that they try and put their hope in "knowledge," even if it is false... at least it isn't God.  Just as those who worship the *created* rather than the *Creator*.  This is the same old stuff... worshiping the knowledge, not the knowledge giver.<br>  <br>  If God exists... is that not scientific?|`|kc1IBYMRaa	Science supports atheism; but atheism is not scientific itself.  It is just a word to denote a non-belief.  It is neither a religion nor a philosophy.  There are as many "atheisms" as there are atheists.

Science says is a round ball of rock circling a star. The Bible blames epilepsy on demonic possession. Science has established the causes are physical and not supernatural.  Bottom line is that those who believe in primitive and provably nonsensical views of reality hat sceince because science says superstititon is ignorance, and the theist believes they have divine knowledge. It threatens them at every level.|`|ridu0Rtwaa	Two things the BAD christians have such a terror of!!<br>  <br>  But good christians accept non believers rights and evolution!!<br>  <br>  The Pope, Catholic Church, Church of England and mainstream churches all accept evolution and the big bang!!<br>  <br>  Lord Carey the former Archbishop of Canterbury put it rather well – “Creationism is the fruit of a fundamentalist approach to scripture, ignoring scholarship and critical learning, and confusing different understandings of truth”!! <br>  <br>  So these people are fast becoming the laughingstock of christians, atheists and all the other religions!!|`|C1SOqQSkaa	Weeell - seems to me that atheism is what you get when you apply the scientific method to belief systems.|`|26DoxkOBaa	Darwin's theory says God doesn't exist, and Darwin had to launch a vicious attack on theist to promote this, and I suppose ever since then it's been a fight. He did this because his theory isn't very rational and at the behest of Zionist Jews who hates Christianity, he had to push it on our culture. So it's not Darwinism of itself, it's being attacked with it that upsets theists.<br>  <br>  Atheists on R&S tout science's dogma and Darwinism to prove that God doesn't exist, as though science and Darwinism is the rational "authority" that "modern" society has agreed upon to represent reality, however, societies can be wrong and the collective controlled en mass, and when it comes to psychology or the spiritual, authority is used to control others. It just acts as a control mechanism and stops people from having an open mind to inquire anymore.<br>  <br>  I think Buddha was misinterpreted concerning the Nirvana state. When the limited ego or “I,” vanishes along with it's mind, energy , body (typifying happiness) and worlds with all of their corresponding paraphernalia, a state of absolute vacuum is spontaneously experienced by the consciousness, which remains eternally when once it is gained. At this stage God, in the man state as man, with full consciousness as super-consciousness, is now only conscious of absolute vacuum—the consciousness is now ?xed and focussed on “Absolute Vacuum” itself.<br>  <br>  This vacuum is absolute in its entirety; vacuum alone prevails and there is an entire absence of the Nothing as well as of the Everything. This is therefore called the “Divine, Absolute Vacuum,” and it is not born of Illusion, but it is born of Reality. This state of divine vacuum prevails just at the instant when the Nothing disappears or vanishes and just immediately before the Everything ?lls in that vacuum to give conscious experience of the reality of the “I am God” state.<br>  <br>  This is the ?rst stage where all that is of the Nothing vanishes completely and where the super-consciousness is focused only on absolute vacuum, which now prevails as it prevails eternally in the original God-Is state of God in original, divine sound sleep. In the ?rst stage, consciousness of God, in the man state as man, is not of the limited self or ego or “I,” mind, energy , body and worlds, nor is the consciousness even of God or of the unlimited Self or Ego or “I,” universal mind, unbounded energy , universal body and universes; because, in this first stage only the consciousness of absolute vacuum prevails. This vacuum is also divine; it is not of Illusion but it is of Reality. In this ?rst stage the super-consciousness of God, in the man state as man, experiences the “passing-away-in” the absolute vacuum state of the original God-Is state, and is thus conscious now only of absolute vacuum.<br>  <br>  The experience of the ?rst stage is of the nirvana state. Nirvana is that state where apparently “God Is Not.” This is the only state where “God Is Not” and “Consciousness Is.” This experience of the ?rst stage is what Buddha emphasized, but later on it was misinterpreted as Buddha having emphasized that there was no God. The reality, however, is that God Is; but in the absolute vacuum state of the ?rst stage only consciousness remains, experiencing absolute vacuum.<br>  <br>  As it can never happen for God not to exist, in the state of nirvana God plays the part of consciousness itself, which consciousness is sometimes termed super-consciousness or mahachaitanya. The second stage follows this nirvana state and the “I am God” state is experienced consciously.

Favorite places to hang are Venice, Santa Monica, Westwood, Marina. But, yes. Outrageously expensive. Never spent much time i the Valley (Burbank, Glendale, Studio City, Encino).

You cannot use 'parce que il' since 'que' ends with a vowel and 'il' starts with a vowel.

She's latino as am I, if she's any mature, she will think it is funny. I think its funny when used in that context because it is such a stereotype, but I would never use it. Most of the people that I adore and care about are black, like my husband for 1.

Yes, I agree that words are just words, but when a word has a negative connotation attached to it that is potentially going to hurt someone why do you need to use it?  It's a simple case of reaching in to your vocabulary and choosing a word that sums up what you're thinking without causing distress or offence to anyone else.  It just takes a little thought and sensitivity, and occasionally being creative with language, but if everyone were to make an effort not to make people feel victimised or different based on their race, sexual orientation, creed etc the world would be a much nicer, more tolerant place.  Just because a word or phrase is used commonly it doesn't mean it's right.|`|12VQ4ETcaa	Yes, it was completely inappropriate.  There are lots of very common behaviors that are completely inappropriate.  Just because lots of people do them doesn't mean it's okay.<br>  <br>  The point of etiquette is to help you figure out what to do when you do something offensive unintentionally.  If you'd done it intentionally, of course it would be even worse.  What would you do if you accidentally poked someone in the eye with an umbrella?|`|rThIVk2maa	Eh.... this would be a good reason not to make such commentary in the first place. If she's angry and you're branded a racist,... well, I'm sorry, but you can't be too surprised. <br>  <br>  I would suggest apologizing and attempting a sad excuse such as it was a joke intended for another person who knew that you meant no harm by it.|`|c4ab5d2160987edad1038a9ad7d207baaa	I'm brown and my white friends say the n word in front of me all the time, i don't think it is racist because I know they don't mean it like in a racist way, so i guess if she knows you well enough, its cool.|`|IB2V5t1Oaa	I hope this taught you a lesson not to use this word unnecessarily. If you know what it means, you will realize how wrong it was to use in front of anyone... no matter what nationality they happen to be.|`|sxy4AJooaa	well you probably shouldnt have used the term, and if she is offended then she has a right to be. you DID use the phrase so you cant really defend it. you should apologise.|`|8000008da995a7f2941cb90d17250013aa	It isn't common here to use that expression.....( I get the context though)<br>  <br>  But screw it, it's just a cracker expression. let her be offended if she wants....

White, Black, Native American, latinos, Indians, Asian and whoever else I left out.|`|kYH1OYB4aa	Every race wants to be "in charge" but in America, because this is a British settler colony, of course we are gonna wanna take charge over everyone else. If China had a colony it would be the same thing.|`|y6XqWAueaa	As a caucasian, I have to say that I have given that exact question intense thought, not saying I have an answer yet, but yes I think that as a race there are some serious power issues. Throughout history we have plundered resources and laid claim to lands, giving little to absolutely no thought to killing and destroying all that stood in the way of "what is ours". My biggest issue here is that it seems the sense was/is that it's ours because God wants us to have it..yeah sure, that makes alot of sense, because obviously God created caucasians, and every other race on the planet just magically appeared...<br>  I am ashamed that my forefathers could be so egotistical and ignorant as to think that somehow the earth was theirs to own, when it's really a gift for all to share and cherish...<br>  Take as an example a comment made by Salman Rushdie in his novel Midnights Children, his character mentions how bazaar it seems that the british claim to have 'founded' India, as though it would not have existed had it not been for their presence there...Idiots.<br>  I hope that Obama will lead the way for many more countries to look beyond mere skin and seek good men AND women to be the leaders of the world.|`|qvuQSQvpaa	i think it all started wen white ppl started makig guns and using em alot 4 their armies. before that they didnt bash nbdy but themselves (and mayb egyptians at one pt). but they got trigger happy and felt like they needed to just run the world... but hey. if africans or asians or anybody else produced guns the way white ppl did from the jump. it would be the other way around|`|5AWSNoOhaa	There is something inherent in the human condition that causes us to form groups / clans along lines of similarities and set ourselves apart from those who don't share our declared similar characteristics ( race, gender, nationality, religious affiliation, etc.). Even in cultures that don't have readily visible differences they still manage to set up separatist groups on along religious and ideological lines. Try to think of it this way, it's not just a white/black/other thing, it's just that those differences are the most glaring and easiest to use as a condition of separation. I'm not making excuses for racism of bigotry, it is and should be intolerable.<br>  All I'm saying is that civilization has existed for about 5000 years, it's only been recognizable as a 'civilization' for a few hundred years. We are in our infancy as a species and for an 'infant' species we are actually doing pretty darn good. We have grown through the civil rights movement, suffragist movement and other periods of 'mini-enlightenment's' and a global decline in violence. We need to continue to grow as a species and hopefully we will eventually stop looking for differences and start looking at similarities (of which there are many). <br>  There is a wonderful book by Donald Brown called "Human Universals". It is a collection of hundreds of things ALL humans share in common despite race, gender, culture, national and ideological differences. These similarities exist even among peoples who have never had contact in any way shape or form.<br>  We all seem to like to set ourselves apart from others in any way we can. In every group of any kind there are always sub-groups and in the sub-groups there is a "pecking-order". It is hard-wired into humans.<br>  The task ahead of us is to continue to give our 'darker side' characteristics (bigotry, racism, intolerance, etc.) the light of public scrutiny and condemnation without allowing those things to become another point to seperate along. To use your own words, it's time to stop 'bashing' each other and look to what we have in commonality and focus on those things alone. We are all part of the human family and I don't allow anyone to "bash" another member of my family in my presence. Keep pointing things out. It's how we change things.|`|751b6d52b808446c5c6ff2cb8a8d596aaa	I agree with you, I'm white and I have seen evidence of this in the UK too. Don't worry about people thinking you are racist by asking your question, you are entitled to voice your opinion just like everyone else.|`|8KxurcApaa	My grandfather (who is still alive & vividly remembers the Jim Crow Era) once described white people as having a superiority complex that wouldn't allow them to co-exists on the same level with other people ... they always wanted more.  I can't say that I agree or disagree but I thought it was fitting to share his opinion considering the question.  <br>  <br>  As for Hello's comment that everyone wants control ... no one wants to be without control if they are going to be oppressed without it, but that doesn't mean that other races are just as aggressive as whites are.  The native Americans welcomed the settlers (originally), taught them how to live in this land & offered brotherhood ... the settlers eradicated them.|`|n6IBfiDPaa	I completely agree that whites do bash other cultures and races, however, it is unfair to say that they are the only ones. EVERY race bashes other races. Its not just race either, people bash what is different.<br>  I'm not racist, but how is it that a black comedian can base his/her entire routine on race and it's ok? It's funny! Ill admit, I do laugh at the occasional white joke (Im a white women btw) but if a white comedian did the exact same thing, its not ok? It's perfectly fine if that white comedian bashes white people though.<br>  <br>  I think its great that we finally have a black president! It means we are getting somewhere in the world! But people are so caught up with the past that they forget the the world IS changing. Im not saying it is equal, it is far from equal. Whites do control most things, but in time I believe it will change.<br>  Just like, it is safe to say that MEN control most things.<br>  It isnt just about race or culture, its about everyone being different, and each person has their own vulnerable part of themselves that gets bashed at times.

Mellon, also director of the Mellon Bank, was U.S. Secretary of the Treasury. He associated with other wealthy men such as William R. Hearst, Sr. and the DuPont brothers. Hearst owned a chain of newspapers across the U.S. as well as a large lumber company. The DuPont family had just patented a paper making process using wood pulp some years earlier.

If your relationship with your boyfriend is totally serious, and you're about to get married. Then, that's a reason to get mad, cos you're gonna spend your WHOLE life with him.<br>  But if it's a just a normal relationship, it's really really stupid to break up with you.<br>  <br>  unless, you've said or done something to him at your friends house that made him upset.

The reason is that all analogies are materially-based, and matter does not and (as far as we know) cannot have properties analogous to the properties of the trinity.<br>  <br>  To put it another way:  no "thing" has all of the same properties as the trinity.<br>  <br>  The problem with "your" analogy:  is that this is merely a collection of titles applied to a single person.  In that analogy, the mother is the same person as the daughter and the wife.  In the trinity, the three persons are 3 *separate* persons.<br>  <br>  Now, here's my favorite analogy.  I don't like using it because, like all analogies, it does *not* describe all of the properties of the trinity.  Still, I think it's pretty good.  I'll let you figure out how it fails to represent the trinity...<br>  <br>  There is a law firm:  Smith, Smith and Smith.  The three partners are equal owners.  Smith Sr. has authority over every person in the company's employ.  So do Smith Jr. and H. S. Smith.  In other words:  when Smith is in the room (it doesn't matter which Smith), you'd better listen, because he has absolute authority over everyone who's not Smith.<br>  <br>  Now, the REASON that each of the three is called Smith is because they all *are* Smith.  Still, they are clearly 3 different persons.  Still no one of them is more "Smith" than the other, and every one of them has all of the authority and power of Smith.<br>  <br>  Jim, <a href="http://www.bible-reviews." rel="nofollow">http://www.bible-reviews.</a> com/selector_rc.html|`|a7fc3089d9e7ba174faf16c6aa239694aa	I'm not Catholic.

We are limited in mind and cannot fathom the absolute, true trinity of God. The example of one man being father, son, and husband is a poor example, but it is the best one that we can create to compare with the trinity. I always try to explain it thoroughly when using that example. I make certain that others realize that God does not have a father, but is the Father and the Son at the same time. God is not limited in body, spirit, or mind like we are. My point is that the example is only to help people create a picture or get the idea, but it is a poor example, and it is the only one that comes close to explain the trinity of God.|`|WYk0zYdhaa	All analogies break down because we are trying to describe in our words something so complex as the nature of God.   Our early church fathers use a 3 leaf clover or an egg.  You have the shell, white, and yolk.  Again not too great... I've heard of water as in vapor, ice and liquid.  However the best way I've found is to learn scripture in context.  So yeah I agree the woman or man and their roles are a flawed analogy I can't think of any one that would be better.  <br>  <br>  I stick with the trinity being one God head comprised of three distinct persons.

DtlQawvgaa	Basically she has been so brain washed by the Watchtower that you can not reason with her. It is very common among Jw who are deep in the cult not to listen to reason. <br>  <br>  Acts 15:19-21,28 is the Scripture the JW cult typically point to as the reason they refuse to accept blood donations. <br>  <br>  Acts 15:20 says, "Instead we should write to them, telling them to abstain from food polluted by idols, from sexual immorality, from the meat of strangled animals and from blood." <br>  <br>  It is clear from the context that the instructions were against eating / drinking blood, not blood transfusions. Blood transfusions were not even possible in Bible times, so there is no possibility that this Scripture could be referring to blood transfusions. There were many pagan religious practices that involved eating and drinking blood and/or strangling an animal to keep more of its blood in its meat. <br>  <br>  The Scriptures and all people recognize the difference between eating or drinking something as a food for nourishment or pleasure, as compared to taking the same thing for medical treatment (see 1 Tim. 5:23).<br>  <br>  After Russell's death in 1916, Joseph Franklin Rutherford succeeded Russell as president of the Watchtower organization. Under his administration Jehovah’s Witnesses depicted uses of blood as heroic and the Lord’s work.<br>  <br>   In 1925, blood transfusion was mentioned in an issue of Golden Age. It reported on Mr. B. W. Tibble who donated blood on forty-five separate occasions. The article highlighted his refusal of payment for donating, and the honor accordingly bestowed upon him by Order of the king.<br>  <br>   In 1927 the Watchtower organization addressed blood, stating, “God told Noah that every living creature… must not eat the blood…”.<br>  <br>   In 1931 this was expounded by the Watchtower organization teaching “that it was not the eating of the blood that God objected to, but it was bringing the blood of the beast in contact with the blood of man.” At this time the Watchtower organization taught that human blood was sacred and that it was wrong to contaminate human blood with animal blood.<br>  <br>   In 1940 while discussing interesting medical news, the Watchtower organization reported on a woman who accidentally shot herself with a revolver in her heart and survived a major surgical procedure during which an attending physician donated a quart of his own blood for transfusion.<br>  <br>  After Rutherford’s death in 1942, the Watchtower organization (under Nathan Homer Knorr’s administration) wrote in 1944, “the stranger was forbidden to eat or drink blood, whether by transfusion or by the mouth” and that this applied “in a spiritual way to the consecrated persons of good-will today, otherwise known as “Jonadabs” of the Lord’s “other sheep.””<br>  <br>  In 1945, the application of the doctrine on blood was expanded to prohibit blood transfusions of whole blood, whether allogeneic or autologous.  While the prohibition didn't specify any punitive measures for accepting a transfusion, by January 1961 it became a disfellowshipping offence to conscientiously accept a blood transfusion. This represented an admitted shift toward increased strictness by the Watchtower organization imposing additional obligation upon the community of Jehovah’s Witnesses. As part of this doctrinal shift, the Watchtower organization warned that accepting a blood transfusion could prevent them from living eternally in God's new world.<br>  <br>  God Bless!|`|EJHhCDcaaa	Imagine being the Witness parent of a child that needed a kidney transplant in 1970. Although the Awake! 1949 Dec. 22 had described transplants as "wonders of modern surgery" in 1967 God revealed that transplants were wrong in his eyes. The Watchtower 1967 Nov. 15 pp.702-704 stated that being now "enlightened by God's word" God's people understood that transplants are against divine principles and cannibalistic. The parents must sincerely have believed they were putting Jehovah first when watching their child die, refusing them the opportunity of possible survival through a transplant. How would that parent feel on reading the Watchtower 1980 Mar. 15 p.31 -"There is no Biblical command pointedly forbidding the taking in of other human tissue…. It is a matter for personal decision…" The enlightenment of 1967 had proved to be dark, harmful and in need of later correction, a regressive doctrine that resulted in the unnecessary death of members. When a doctrine changes and then reverts back to the original position this is not evidence of light getting brighter, it is evidence of a lack of Holy Spirit directing the Governing Body.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.jwfacts.com/index_files/blooddoctrine.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.jwfacts.com/index_files/blood...</a><br>  Has a lot of Information that may help you.|`|Hb6Ifwa6aa	I don't see an issue, to be quite honest.  She is your wife, you are the HEAD of the household, she needs to respect that, regardless of the issue.  Your son is a ADULT who rejects her faith and can make his own decisions.  She needs to respect that too.  You should threaten to leave her because of (heaven forbid) rather watching her son die than allowing you to step in and donate blood if he needs it.  See how that makes her feel.  Threatening to leave you over this is really stupid, and not a biblical reason for divorce.  Look it, I would never take blood myself, but I'm O+ and thus a universal donor, should either of my sons or my brother ever need my blood, I would donate it in a heartbeat, and if my husband were to threaten to leave me as a result, I would pack his bags for him and show him the door.... but he would never disagree when it comes to that issue.|`|n5AXfWEfaa	Hey Old Man, how are you feeling now?

In truth, you son is of age and can make the decision (so long as he is  mentally and physically able) for himself, without the consent of either you or your wife.  As a father you are bound in conscience to respect your son's wishes should he be unable to make the choice, himself. <br>  <br>  The entire 'anti-blood transfusion' nonsense is simply the worst sort of mis-interpretation of Scripture.|`|nGyOmjPsaa	First of all, divorce isn't an option.  Only in cases where there is adultery or abuse is it an option.  But it's not an option for different beliefs, actions or refusing to cave to the spouse's stance.<br>  <br>  That being said you should look up what it says in the watchtower.  I believe it says something there with family members who leave the JW without being booted out and still remaining in close contact with them as if nothing happened.  And, if you should choose, leave the JW with your son because neither of you believe in the rejection of blood transfusion, then leave.  Maybe I'm just saying this because I'm Catholic, but if you can go to the Catholic Church.  There they understand that any good that can be done should be done.  This way you can give your son the blood if he ever needs it without having duties to the JW belief system.  And your wife wouldn't be able to say much since you nor your son are any longer JWs.<br>  <br>  God bless and I'm happy to see you standing up for what is right and healthy for your son!

They follow a process of 'study' to do this. According to their studies the blood is a unique fluid with divine properties (semen also has this quality) and as such should not be shared or 'wasted'. The Jehovah's are prolific writers and have bunches of pamphlets and 'help books' that go into detail and list the scriptures that are the basis for this belief. If your wife is intent on continuing in the practice of JW teachings and principals you will either need to assimilate or look forward to a widening gap in understanding. One key part of their teachings is the fact of 'truth'. It is either all true or it is false.

JW spouses are warned by their elders to watch out for a former JW spouse becoming "a spiritual threat". If this is deemed to be happening, then the elders put pressure on to get the couple to separate - supposedly for the spiritual safety of the JW spouse. This also acts as an intimidation device to 'encourage' the former JW to return to the fold, tail between his legs. Your stance on the blood issue (even a hypothetical one!) could be the excuse needed to create distance.<br>  <br>  It appears to be an excuse because any reasonable person would admit that a lad, almost 18, is deemed to be fit to make up his own mind on a life or death medical issue. The Courts would award him any treatment necessary if either of his parents resisted - and your wife knows this. But she's now threatening to leave you?

We should not reject it.|`|SsSIbFhcaa	Question it all,<br>  <br>  When I met you here on YA I wondered if you may have family still involved with the JW movement but did not ask as it was not my business.<br>  <br>  Since you are asking a question now I will give you an answer:<br>  <br>  1 Corinthians 7:12-16 (NIV)<br>  12To the rest I say this (I, not the Lord): If any brother has a wife who is not a believer and she is willing to live with him, he must not divorce her. 13And if a woman has a husband who is not a believer and he is willing to live with her, she must not divorce him. 14For the unbelieving husband has been sanctified through his wife, and the unbelieving wife has been sanctified through her believing husband. Otherwise your children would be unclean, but as it is, they are holy. <br>      15But if the unbeliever leaves, let him do so. A believing man or woman is not bound in such circumstances; God has called us to live in peace. 16How do you know, wife, whether you will save your husband? Or, how do you know, husband, whether you will save your wife? <br>  <br>  To those who say you should do what you have to and possibly antagonize your wife I say they are being un-biblical. You are to live a Christian life before your wife, as long as she stays with you, in the hope that she will become a Christian.<br>  <br>  So what does this mean for your son and any other children? You said your son is almost 18. I suggest you "give" him the money to go talk to an attorney who specializes in what are called "advanced directives". This is a legal document that specifes what care is to be provided in the event the person is incapable of making the decision themselves. <br>  <br>  Courts have decreed that after a certian age children can make these choices even if it means their death for refusing treatment. Since your wife will not allow this type of treatment then your son needs to take the steps to ensure that choice is taken from her in the event something happens.<br>  <br>  By doing this your son will remove you from having to take his side in this issue and remain at peace with your wife.<br>  <br>  If there are younger children in the house then IF the situation arises you will have to make the choice then. Do not borrow trouble and talk about it now.<br>  <br>  I am providing a link to an article at the bottom. I would recommend reading it. Your children are important and you need to do what you can to support them but not at the expence of your relationship with your wife, unless it is truely a life and death choice. If it comes to that then I pray for God's peace for you in making that choice.<br>  <br>  Email me if you want to talk more on this.|`|dbw210qqaa	Friend, <br>  My daughter works in a cancer clinic and has had to counsel JW's re: blood<br>  They refuse transfusions because it alters the blood, but do take meds which do that also<br>  I am not a JW and don't have the info re: book, etc: but thought this might give some thought on it|`|AA10764658	Go back to your library where you still have your JW books before you decided to leave the congregation last year.<br>  You have been in the congregation for a very long time and just left the congregation months ago, so you should know that the bible states: Abstain from blood.|`|WQvqLnnhaa	There is nothing biblical or scriptural that should stop you from helping another human being with some of your blood.<br>  <br>  You can also tell her that scripture says the only lawful divorce is the result of adultery.<br>  <br>  Use the bible, and not the New World Translation.|`|qHoWraAaaa	Yeah, I know of a Great Book.

I can't find any literature from the WBTS saying that, but they do say again and again that adults have the right to refuse a blood transfusion. If that is so, then the same should apply to adults having the right to accept blood transfusions as well.

People donate blood to save lives. There are other procedures that can be done by transfusion that you can call ask the Doctors about.

We are all doomed to hell and damnation.<br>  <br>  We yell and scream over petty things we learn from religion. We get get so upset we want to part. The issues are never solved by anger. Anger motivates us to sin. <br>  <br>  Your son's need and the life and chance of your son to live is important. What say you? Does she love him to take a chance in a life or death situation. God's word says nothing about going to hell for a blood transfusion. God gave Doctors and test for man knowledge to aide people when illness strike. God knew he would give men knowledge for life to continue. <br>  <br>  We can die from lack of knowledge and so we do and even our young.<br>  <br>  So pray for your wife even if she leaves you and pray for your son even if he gets a blood transfusion.God sees,he hears and he knows.|`|PdaUxZMjaa	JWs are a non-traditional religion with no ties to the modern church.

Wow...|`|aGRJ6MPdaa	Since your son can make the decision on his own concerning taking blood, then your wife has a choice to make;<br>  <br>  1. Let you give him your blood which you know is healthy;<br>  2. Let him take someone else's blood and take the risk that some bad stuff got through the system, possibly infecting him with HIV or some other blood- borne disease. <br>  <br>  JWs are allowed to take blood fractions. Just where do they think these fractions come from? From donated blood or plasma! Donating blood couldn't be "unlawful" to JWs if accepting parts of such donations are OK. <br>  <br>  This reminds me of a discussion I had with a friend long ago, before I became a JW. He refused to eat @ Burger King. When I asked him why, he said that it was because BK advertises on porn channels. My first thought, after thinking how he knows this, was what Jesus said about giving Caesar's things back to Caesar. When I go to BK, I pay for the food, the labor, and the energy necessary to provide me with a warm meal. I don't go there with the thought that I need to help support their ability to advertise on adult TV programming. What they do with that money afterward is their business. I am in no way responsible for their choice to pay for air time on porn channels. <br>  <br>  I think the same principle may apply here. JWs who use blood fractions rely on donations from other people to get those fractions. Therefore, a JW should be able to donate blood with a clean conscience. If the medical institutions choose to use the blood in a way that JWs do not approve of, then it is on the medical institution, not the JWs who donate. <br>  <br>  In fact, the same would apply to $$$ that JWs donate to the organization. If the organization decides to use some of the worldwide work money for some other purpose, that is their choice. I'm sure JWs wouldn't question it or have a problem with it at all!|`|cIZS6Wr2aa	Your wife is so brainwashed.  You son is 18, not 8.  She just can't handle her family going against the church teachings.  I think she just can't handle it.   That is not putting God first.  That is putting Charles Russell and church doctrines first before your own husband and son.   That blood thing was said in the old testament and does not apply to today.  They are still under the old testament Jewish Law.  If so, then they should become Jews because you cannot please God under the old covenant without becoming Jewish.|`|df54f1044a5b499adb758231bb8e4a90aa	I have a friend whose parents also got a divorce over the JW blood issue,in that case, the non-JW Father did give the son a blood transfusion while he was unconscious (the boy tried to commit suicide). The boy was disfellowshiped for the blood transfusion (not the suicide attempt). The JW Mother divorced the Father and disowned both of her children.  <br>  <br>  At 18 your son is an adult. He can do whatever he wants and if he wants to grant you permission to give him your blood should he need it, that is his choice. Would your wife disown her own child? As a matter of fact, yes! JWs disown even their own children for the sake of their faith...When it comes to divorce however, things can be a bit more complicated.

It's a female strategy that has an effective counter attack...whatever she threatens you with, threaten her with it right back. When you do that, you take your power back and make her think twice about threatening you with something like that ever again.<br>  <br>  For instance:<br>  <br>  She says - "I need to rethink our marriage because I cannot be married to a man who would force blood onto our son."<br>  <br>  You say - "You know what, maybe I need to rethink our marriage, because I cannot be married to a woman who would risk our son's life to uphold religious rules that don't even apply to him...because he's not JW!"<br>  (I put the exclamation point at the end because it is much more effective if you say it with some passion)<br>  <br>  If she doesn't get the point and continues to emotionally bully you, then perhaps you really should rethink your marriage to her. <br>  <br>  By the way, anyone who pulls out the "I need to rethink our marriage" line when they aren't getting their way could seriously benefit from relationship counseling!|`|AA10527991	Find a book of law.

For you being his father, it is likely that you could actually give your own blood to him in case of need but your blood type might not be the right for him. <br>  <br>  You need to show your wife that you are the spiritual leader of the family. If she divorces you, it is her choice. It is funny how she  thinks that it is better to end a marriage than try to save a child with blood transfusion. This proves how WTS has been able to make the followers captive. What happens after you have divorced over it and the WTS changes the blood policy?? Or what if your child dies for this blood policy and then it changes?<br>  <br>  We  are under the new covenant. The Old Testament KOSHER LAWS do not apply to us. If they need to reject blood, why they do not do the same way with fat?<br>  <br>  Hang in there. Ask guidance from God, and Holy Spirit will guide you.

While the word "dinosaur" is a relatively new word, there seems to be evidence in many places around the world that men and these creatures have co-existed.  In the Bible, when God is responding to Job, in Job 40 and 41, we see two creatures described, the 'behemoth' and the 'leviathan.'  Both are described as extremely large animals and seem reminiscent of descriptions of a dinosaur and a giant sea creature.  Although Bible notes in many modern translations suggest these animals might be a hippo, a crocodile, an elephant, or other known animals, the Biblical descriptions defy those identifications.   http://www.rae.org/pteroets.html        The Bible and Pterosaurs:  Archaeological and Linguistic Studies of Jurassic Animals that Lived Recently         The Chinese histories and legends abound with dinosaurs.  But they are not called "dinosaurs."  They are called "dragons."  The dragon is one of the twelve animals of the Chinese zodiac.  What is interesting is that all the other eleven are commonly known animals and there is no hint of 'mythology' involved with their identities.  It seems as if the dragon was just a commonly known at one time.  The pictures are often fantastical, but so are their stylized pictures of horses and other animals.  I checked the web for accessible information on this.  I was able to find a few things that were not having to do with video games, sculptures, movies, items for sale, and such.  The following links may be of interest.  There are more.  If you have access to books, you might want to check the epic of Beowulf, in which he battles a monster.  If you have access to a good book on the history of art, you may be able to see some dragons and sea monsters painted on ancient Roman pottery.   The legends abound all over the world.  They do not seem to be connected to each other, but each telling of its own place.  We have the story of St. George and the Dragon; there is the reference regarding Alexander the Great of his army disturbing some giant monster in a cave on their way to India.  The American Indian thunderbird may very well be one of the ancient flying reptiles.  An excellent essay by Lourella Rouster is "The Footprints of Dragons," at http://rae.org/dragons.html         A couple of pages which chronicle a bit the possible existence of monsters in Europe are dragon myths from Austria http://www.strangescience.net/stdino2.ht... page includes two paintings of dragons from the seventeenth century that are quite interesting!

What do you think?<br>  <br>  Hope is one leg of a three-legged stool, together with faith and charity. These three stabilize our lives regardless of the rough or uneven surfaces we might encounter at the time. The scriptures are clear and certain about the importance of hope. The Apostle Paul taught that the scriptures were written to the end that we “might have hope.”<br>  <br>  Hope has the power to fill our lives with happiness. Its absence—when this desire of our heart is delayed—can make “the heart sick.”<br>  <br>  Hope is a gift of the Spirit. It is a hope that through the Atonement of Jesus Christ and the power of His Resurrection, we shall be raised unto life eternal and this because of our faith in the Savior. This kind of hope is both a principle of promise as well as a commandment, and, as with all commandments, we have the responsibility to make it an active part of our lives and overcome the temptation to lose hope. Hope in our Heavenly Father’s merciful plan of happiness leads to peace, mercy, rejoicing, and gladness. The hope of salvation is like a protective helmet; it is the foundation of our faith and an anchor to our souls.<br>  <br>  The scriptures say that there must be “an opposition in all things.” So it is with faith, hope, and charity. Doubt, despair, and failure to care for our fellowmen lead us into temptation, which can cause us to forfeit choice and precious blessings.<br>  <br>  The adversary uses despair to bind hearts and minds in suffocating darkness. Despair drains from us all that is vibrant and joyful and leaves behind the empty remnants of what life was meant to be. Despair kills ambition, advances sickness, pollutes the soul, and deadens the heart. Despair can seem like a staircase that leads only and forever downward.<br>  <br>  Hope, on the other hand, is like the beam of sunlight rising up and above the horizon of our present circumstances. It pierces the darkness with a brilliant dawn. It encourages and inspires us to place our trust in the loving care of an eternal Heavenly Father, who has prepared a way for those who seek for eternal truth in a world of relativism, confusion, and of fear.<br>  <br>  Hope is not knowledge, but rather the abiding trust that the Lord will fulfill His promise to us. It is confidence that if we live according to God’s laws and the words of His prophets now, we will receive desired blessings in the future. It is believing and expecting that our prayers will be answered. It is manifest in confidence, optimism, enthusiasm, and patient perseverance.<br>  <br>  In the language of the gospel, this hope is sure, unwavering, and active. The prophets of old speak of a “firm hope” and a “lively hope.” It is a hope glorifying God through good works. With hope comes joy and happiness. With hope, we can “have patience, and bear . . . [our] afflictions.”|`|dfda2f35c60f40f353b0765d8b3ec561aa	I pretty much had the same experience that you did.    <br>  <br>  Religion has been manipulated by the ruling classes since day one, whenever a new government leader was established they would outlaw the previous religion putting to death all 'heretics' and burning any evidence of the previous religion while setting up a new one. <br>  <br>  It is easy to become angered by such plots and schemes, especially because these are the people that we are suppose to be able to trust the most. <br>  <br>  I too have begged God for a sign and have been blessed by receiving those signs but my faith has never been tied to any religion or book and therefore I didn't have to choose one belief or non-belief over another<br>  <br>  I do admit my ignorance though, as I realize daily that I know nothing.|`|zLKsBm1Uaa	It seems that you have tried too hard to find something that you should just naturally feel.|`|jsM8F4bLaa	I guess because I want to believe and dont necessarily need all this great proof of Him. <br>  <br>  The Bible is enough for me.

I didn't become a Christian until I did meet Jesus, in the way you seem to want so much, in a spiritual experience. I was not brainwashed or deluded as I was not brought up to go to church or believe in anything, and this happened when I attended a friend's baptism service. Caught me by surprise. I was pretty much ignorant of the beliefs of Christianity at that time. Like yourself, I have studied it a lot since then, although cannot claim to have gone to great lengths, but when you approach the faith from the original standpoint that you know Jesus is real, it makes sense.<br>  <br>  I have continued to believe, because I have had many prayers answered for one thing, been used to heal in the miraculous which I could not do before I met Jesus, and seen many lives changed by the Holy Spirit. <br>  <br>  We may have had vastly different experiences of Christ, and I cannot explain why you never felt his presence, but I'm concerned that you feel the need to try to persuade Christians that they are deceiving themselves, when we are quite happy the way we are.|`|QPbnFJGKaa	You said it yourself that deep in your heart you 'knew' He didn't exist, this is the state of your heart. It seems that you were longing more for acceptance from others, wanting to 'fit in' so to speak.<br>  Besides, I don't think that people know Jesus like they should.  Just look at how the Church and other Believers profess their faith yet condemn and not walk the walk so to speak.  I myself don't know Him like I want to know Him.  It takes time and walking the walk.  My mother in law has been a Believer for over 30 years and still confesses she yearns to know Him more and be closer.  <br>  Being a believer takes perseverance, you gave up.

Just because You are ignorant about true salvation does not mean others who truly do believe in God are ignorant.<br>  <br>  From your very words it is obviouse that you were simply "trying" Christianity.  You were "putting on" the face, but not really believing.<br>  <br>  This is why Jesus said in John chapter three, "ye must be born again".  There is two natures, that of the flesh, and that of the spirit.  A person must die to their flesh, and be born again by God's Spirit to be saved. When this happens, a person is "born again".<br>  <br>  There are many, many people who are going through the motions, but have never really given themselves to God, and, from their heart trusted Jesus Christ as their Saviour.  They are lost even though they "say" they believe.  And, just like you, in their heart, they know they do not truly believe.  Yahoo Q/A is full of folks just like you.<br>  <br>  I know where you are at right now, because I have been there.  From the age of 9 to the age of 31 I was just like you, claiming to be saved, but knowing it was all a lie in my heart.  At the age of 31, God got my attention in a dramatic way and I finally admitted I was truly not saved. <br>  <br>  But, unlike you, I did not blaim God and turn my back on Him.  I realized the problem was ME.  I stopped "trying" Christianity, and I got down on my knees and truly trusted Jesus as my Saviour.  Turning from myself, and completely giving myself to God.  When I got off my knees that day, I knew I was born again of God's Spirit, and for the last 19 years, God has shown Himself to me in many ways.  I KNOW I am saved, and I know God is real.  Jesus IS my Lord and Saviour, and there is nothing that can change that.<br>  <br>  So, instead of claiming ignorance, I claim truth.<br>  <br>  I pray you come to this realization as well.|`|t88527U1aa	I can't answer for you. I can only state what happened to me I was Atheist/agnostic from age 12-38 through series of people(Christians) I saw they seemed to have more hope more positive witnessed many things acts of kindness and forgiveness, When I invited Christ into my life I felt nothing the first day. The next day I woke up I looked out at the world through new eyes it was beautiful again. People saw the change in me. I became happy and healthier than I had ever been before. It turned my life from womanizing drinking to one of serving others to their betterment. Was a radical change! Of course I surrendered my life to him I sought him out on a daily basis,I went through trails and sin ,I heard from him every step of the way sometimes by the Bible sometimes from his people but mostly by his Holy spirit.

But I'll tell you, God became apparent to me in my darkest hour, not because I was desparate but because I was totally and completely humbled by my circumstances. It's hard to explain, but it was really a matter of "I've done things my way and it isn't working and it hasn't worked in a long time.

I agree with what you say but not the means of delivery. You said you went through this "quest to find the real god" and you came up with your own answers. This is what I feel everyone needs to do. Like you said it's not about spitting out biblical facts it's about showing your work. You can not ask people to do something you were not able to do. Renounce god without doing the research. You did not take other peoples word you took your own, as you should. Now at the end you said "Admit your ignorance" but they can not until they take the same quest. I had a similar road to yours. I went to catholic school, but I asked to many questions and form most there were no real answers. It's not about the destination it's about the journey (or foreigner). Life is not this serious and neither is spirituality. If you help everyone you see and donate every dime to charity, you give and help and give and help, but you do it all in the name of evil,devil,darkness (whatever you call it) it is still a good deed. If this helps these people get through life without killing themselves because it is so crappy and maybe puts a smile on there face is that bad. You came to your conclusions in your way let others do so. I agree with the bulk of your statement, but after studing religion what makes you views and methods any different from those people you said made up religion. You are telling them to believe in a system that they did not figure out for themselves. To blindly admit there ignorance without asking the questions and doing the "research". Babel|`|nGyOmjPsaa	So what about all those saints who were stigmatized?  And all those who had apparitions?  What about our Lady of Guadalupe in Mexico that still stands and is not corrupt?  What about all the saints' bodies who are still not corrupt?  What about the miracles of the Eucharist that still remain in Europe?<br>  <br>  Yes, doubts come inside but that's precisely when we look outside of ourselves.  Prayer can easily turn into talking to oneself, which isn't prayer.  Then we become self-centered without even realizing it.  This doesn't happen to everyone, but to me it does.  So it's a fight sometimes for me to keep focused on God and not myself in order for it to be a true prayer.  When this happens I have to look outside of myself at everything that has happened.  Yeah, God doesn't show himself to everyone and he certainly does not show himself 24/7 to anyone, but that's the struggle we have to face in this world.  I wish I could see him all the time or even feel his presence but he won't do that for me.  He wants me to stay true even in the thick times, even when I find it unbearable--which happens.  It's hard, I agree, and it frustrates me sometimes if I let it.  But I then have to put my will power over my emotions to keep trucking along.<br>  <br>  Sometimes I feel like Mother Theresa (although surely not holy like her!).  She lived 50 YEARS without feeling any consolation from God.  She never once felt him near nor saw him.  She only had faith and hope that he was there with her.  She was truly left naked and felt nothing in any prayer, experience, or Mass until she died.  A testimony for me to keep trucking even when there are no consolations....none.<br>  <br>  God bless always+<br>  <br>  EDIT:  But maybe in the end it's all about giving your heart.  Shuting out everything you've ever heard or thought and let yourself listen.  Maybe it's all about laying yourself down for someone; for God.  Maybe it's all about finding yourself in Him.  Yes, this is what this life is about.

If yes, let us continue. I want to say you that you are in a very honest place right now. Since you are in such a place, you have reached a level of introspective reflection. I can say today with absolute sincerity that I KNOW Jesus is VERY real. There was a time in my life that I said it only with my mouth and wanted to feel the same way inwardly but did not. When I decided that I wanted a change in my life, I came to God with absolute sincerity and humility in my spirit. I had been going through such a preparatory process and I was in a position that I could not longer rely on any fleshly man to advise me. They were just as clueless as I was,  so the answers are not there. I wanted to hear from God himself. I cried out to him and asked to receive the Holy Spirit. Since then, my life has changed so much. There are many people who say with lips only that they know him, and they have a knowledge of him, but not an intimate relationship with him. You see over my life, I remember encountering genuine people whose lives looked like what I wanted mine to be. I wondered what made these people outstanding examples. They weren't so vocal about their beliefs, but their lifestyles DISPLAYED the Light of Christ. I knew this, even when I did not fully comprehend it. I wanted the same. As long as you still feel some "thing" speaking to your spirit, there is still an opportunity. You will not find it in the opinion of another man or woman. It only comes from ONE source. Don't you find that when you KNOW something, you TRULY KNOW it and there will not be a person walking who can tell you otherwise? HIS power is so true, he is waiting on you. Be genuine in your words and watch the way you approach the One who Created you, the giver of life, as he knows your heart anyway. You WERE Created and he loves you. Seek Him, don't look to another and HE WILL COME. Don't take my word for it though, call on Jesus, he will be there.

Anyway.....<br>  <br>  Sin disturbs every relationship that exists in the human realm, and by the way there are only three, man and God, man and nature, and man and man, and all of them have been destroyed by sin. You read Genesis 3 and the curse came violating the relation between man and God, man and nature, and man and man. First of all man was separated from God, he died spiritually. Secondly man was separated in a sense from nature insofar as he had to toil by the sweat of his brow and he had to fight against a cursed earth. And man was separated from man as we see in the very curse upon Adam and Eve bringing conflict in their own marriage. <br>  <br>              And sin has generated cosmic chaos from earth up into the heavens. We find there is even chaos going on between the holy angels and the fallen angels who are known as the demons. Sin waits in lurking to attack every baby born into the world, beginning at conception. David said, "In sin did my mother conceive me." Sin rules every heart, sin is the monarch of man, sin is the king of humanity, sin is the lord of the soul and nobody ever escapes. All who die in childbirth, all who die from heart disease, cancer, war, murder, accidents, old age or whatever die as a victim of sin. "For the wages of sin is" what? "death." Every person on the globe has been infected with the virus of sin, only one person ever entered this world and passed through it without the stain of sin and that was Jesus Christ. Every other human being is captured under the fearful power of sin, and sin is a destructive thing. That's what Satan does to the unregenerate man. He "clouds" his world with a "smog" of sin. You cannot see your sin for what it is until you call upon the name of the Lord to save you. For those who do this, God will lift them out of the "smog" of sin and grant to them everlasting life.|`|AhJaRRlbaa	Good grief.  You sound exactly like me ten years ago.

Agnostics frequently consider all competing views because they haven't come to a decision about theism or atheism.  By definition Atheists have made a decision about the non-existence of the divine, and thus reject opposing views on the matter or stop being Atheists to become Agnostics.  <br>  <br>  If you want to use an example of cognitively flexible behavior, then you should also consider primates as tool users to be at a higher level of cognitive reasoning than a fox.  I also don't know that foxes or Atheists express their ego in a modest manner per say.  In terms of self-criticism I am only aware of humans demonstrating that characteristic, though many mammals can learn through the process of trial and error.  <br>  <br>  There is also the concept you are implying through anthropomorphic description that Hedgehogs stand their ground when under duress, while Foxes steal from chicken pens, then run and hide while trying to deceive their attackers.  I'm sure many Atheists might object to the characterization as a thieving deceitful coward.  So thus we can see the problems with describing behaviors and traits as virtues through anthropomorphic description.  It depends on which qualities the other side might try to emphasize in making their counter argument.  <br>  <br>  So my point is that Christians are Christians and Atheists are Atheists.  In this instance why not call someone what they are without trying to imply value judgements by using metaphors.  <br>  <br>  I hope this helps.|`|8rbQBaIeaa	Have you ever owned a hedgehog?

One must repent, which means turning from one's former lifestyle and choosing God's ways (Acts 2:38, 17:30, Luke 13:3),<br>  <br>  4.

That's what it comes down to. A man can horribly murder dozens of people and then accept Christ and go to Heaven, according to your naive tales, but an intelligent and civilized man who never harmed one person burns forever just because he knows there's no reason to believe in your deity. You can't make that seem to be logical or just by any means. Your example involves corruption. To begin, I've never committed any crimes, horrible or trivial. If I did, and you punished someone else, Jesus or Joe Blow, you'd be perverting justice. Nobody can take responsibility for anyone else's crimes. If you were a judge like this, you'd soon be in prison for taking bribes and deliberatley punishing the wrong person. That's quite some god you worship who says the worst crime is just not believeing in him when there's no evidence whatsoever of his existence. You aren't qualified to say what's "morally justified". I was born with reason, not faith, and it's much better. I see no reasons to believe in any gods, whether it is God, Yahweh, Allah, Odin, Zeus, Marduk, Enlil, Ahuramazda, etc., so I rely on my own intelligence, not outmoded myths that have been disproved.|`|LnoyylQ7aa	nice coercion tactics to get more followers by giving them the option not to go to hell|`|ZjSgawcpaa	God doesn't exist.

Christian doctrine says it doesn't matter what you did; if you paid off the judge you can get away with mass murder but failure to pay the tribute will result in a really bad outcome for you.<br>  <br>  Free will - you're free to refuse to pay Guido when he comes around offering to  protect your business, but don't blame him when your business "accidentally" burns to the ground with your wife in the building.

The fallacy with this line of reasoning is that faith in god for some reward or to avoid punishment is no faith at all. It is a selfish act to receive something in return for a belief. The whole point of religious belief is so that one can become a better person or achive spiritual enlightenment, not to receive a reward or please a spiritual being.|`|zWj6HXHNaa	1.

Christians should understand that while they believe Jesus is the definitive revelation of God; they should also understand  that non-believers do not share in the same relationship of daughterhood or sonship in Christ that Christians do, but they do seek and find their own Truth in other, more or less adequate or definitive ways. If Christians desire to change the Atheist thinking, it should be your goal to find a better way!<br>  <br>  Christians absolutely cannot assume that "non-believers" go to hell- as that is your God's work? But none the less; Christians have a way off judging the non-believer just as your question does. You didn't fool anyone.<br>  <br>  Atheist are not stupid and do not appreciate being judged for their beliefs. It is actually the Christians fault as a whole for not learning to share the message of their Christ with a better approach.  Who knows, your audience just might grow. You may win one soul now and then; but change the approach and you might win a 1000 fold.<br>  <br>  So the answer to your question is that you and the Atheist are just not thinking from the same source.<br>  <br>  Christian may have an opinion of the Atheist fate, but should refrain from judging as that is your God's work.  I shouldn't have to be the one to teach you this.<br>  <br>  Although I am not an Atheist and do believe in a spiritual world, I don't believe in Hell or the God of your bible. My God is loving, kind, and supportive. He nor I judges no one and believe we are all on our own path with destiny whether one chooses to believe in a God or none. But you judge me just as you judge them.|`|Ne9rXERpaa	<sigh><br>  <br>  If Jesus has already "paid the cost", then why am I required to do ANYthing?

It's sometimes nice to think God will vindicate ME by giving those disgusting creeps the full punishment THEY deserve. :-) <br>  <br>  Still, there is something really repugnant about the the notion of an all-powerful and omniscient God -- supposedly a God of "love"  --supposedly condemning millions of people to Hell for "sins" that God must have known in advance they would commit, since God make them weak enough to commit sins.<br>  <br>  That picture of God creating that picture of Hell is just horrible, and it's impossible for many people to believe, who also want to believe that "God is Love."  <br>  <br>  And you're right, I am nobody to be questioning the most intelligent  being in existence, if He exists.  But I do question, nonetheless.  <br>  =========================<br>  "O Thou, who Man of baser Earth didst make;<br>  And even with Paradise, devise the Snake --<br>      For all the Sins wherewith<br>       the face of Man is blackened,<br>  Man's Forgiveness give -- and take!"<br>                                                   -- The Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam,<br>                                                      Edward Fitztgerald translation|`|f79a4e31211ec881cdd7df7de85a9262aa	if you were a judge who allowed an innocent person (even if they did volunteer themselves) to pay for the crimes of the guilty i would sue you for malpractice.  that is a horrible judge.<br>  <br>  but then again jesus isn't really paying for my crimes is he?  he died, went to hell for three days, came back to life and is currently god.  how is that a sacrifice?  what did he sacrifice?<br>  <br>  if you deserve eternal punishment then the honorable thing to do is accept it.  what your doing is finding a scapegoat.  your weaseling your way out of punishment.  if you killed someone then you should be in prison.  would it be justice if the judge allowed you to walk free in exchange for an innocent person to go to prison instead?  Your god is a crappy judge.

It got really sunny, and hot and dusty 'back in the day'. I don't think Jesus wore sunglasses, but I know he spent a lot of time and energy, ALL his energy, in fact, teaching people right from wrong.  Putting himself in uncomfortable situations, even giving his life for the opportunity for us to have salvation. Salvation isn't a 'given', tho. You have to live a christian lifestyle, not being concerned too much with money, but more with spiritual attributes. Jesus found a lot of 'fence riders', those who were not sure of what way to follow. If 'christians' aren't teaching and living the way Jesus did, they aren't true christians.

Whether it is spanking, restriction, removal of electronics, etc. a child needs to know exactly what the consequences of certain actions will be.  I once made a threat in haste of removing the tv from my son's room and putting in the garage after he turned it on when being told not to.  I found myself at about 9 p.m. that night having to move his entertainment center away from the wall, unplugging cable, video games, dvd player and everything else, and lugging a 30 pound tv out the back door.

Never threaten what you aren't willing to do.|`|e79f5e1a552ff5c84888995f3663d481aa	My mom is 90 I doubt she could spank me!!!LOL!!!|`|rdTnt1Tuaa	I think this day and time that is the problem....The parents never follow through, so the child learns that the parent is just issuing idle threats, and it is just words.  A threat is nothing to take serious, unless you know the person is serious......When my Dad said, "Do that ONE more time, and I will spank you!"....I ceased what ever it was I did.  He was serious, and I knew that from experience, and had learned to appreciate the warning.   Parenting is serious business, and repeated idle threats do not help the character of the child....I was never afraid of my Dad, but learned to respect that he would follow through.|`|hallarIxaa	When my mom said she was going to spank me she always did.|`|59Wg2cI3aa	Not where I come from|`|IS7Xubkfaa	Spanking was the last resort. We usually made the child stand in a corner. Sometimes take away privileges or ground to the house, room or yard. If we did use corporal correction I would administered it with a specially designed paddle. I would use a ping-pong paddle that had holes drilled to allow the air to escape and not cushion the strike. I refer to it as the board of education. I would have the child bend over and touch their toes. I would strike the buttocks with a swift hit. 2 or 3 strikes were sufficient punishment.|`|VWAl3tcnaa	In today's society threatening a child with spanking does not work because the liberal society says that is a no-no.|`|1OBXqGi8aa	I think the repeated threatening without follow through leads to big problems. I like to warn one time. No warning is needed if they already knew better. Usually get a good understanding after one or two exercises with each child and it becomes unnecessary|`|IWyrJ7o3aa	If my parent threaten to spank me, it was no threat I always got that spanking,|`|xyt9NdjVaa	I've heard a lot of threats in this day and age, but much less on following through with discipline. There was a time when I grew up, 'the look' was all that was necessary because if you didn't straighten up, you knew what was next. Threats don't mean anything. That is what has happened with parenting. After you 'threaten' to discipline a child, about 20 times, they don't take you seriously. One of my pet peeves is hearing a parent continually say, "Don't do that, I've told you to stop that," over and over like a broken record. It is quite annoying, and you can't blame the child. It's the parent that needs to get a grip and follow through the first time.|`|AA10405438	Too many times they are trying to scare you out of misbehaving.  I think we'd have fewer problems today if parents carried through with their threat to spank.  Sometimes it is truly the only way to get through to the child that the behavior will not be accepted.  I am not saying to beat a child, I am saying a quick and firm pop on the butt never hurt anyone and most times a second pop on the butt is not required.    I guess I am really showing my age here.  Spanking is not the accepted discipline these days.  I think it should come back just like bell bottoms!|`|nwnILcEAaa	I gave mine the count of 3 to stop whatever it was they were doing.

4068ddb702bdc41558e963e223abc40eaa	Interesting question.    The puzzle you pose comes from the Pauline gospel (Christ died for our sins). But Christ did not preach Paul's Gospel, so if you are after a solution to the puzzle simply go back to the real gospel about how to increase the light of God to become a better person.    This will explain what I am talking about: http://gospelenigma.com    But your question is excellent, and it points right at the problem with the popular gospel. It's not the real gospel!|`|UmdKqP5kaa	HE DID NOT DIE ON THE CROSS:  Ok, we know we don't create each other and we don't come to this world from nowhere because when we die we must be going somewhere as well, hence there must be God, if there were many Gods, they would have fought over what to be created and what not to be, probably over who to die and who to live at the same time... so it's gotta be one God... if that God created us then there must be a reason... could we figure it out on our own? God made it easy and sent us messengers and prophets to show us the way and tell us why... so all the messengers and all the religions are from the same only God, so they've got to be complementary to each other, not opposing each other!!! then God must have said His final words in the last message, what is the last message? and how do we know it's the last one? I guess that would be the religion that believes in all messengers and all books equally... is there such religion? actually yes, Islam does :)  A True Muslim (man or woman) gets his reward for obeying Allah's orders (Allah means The God in Arabic) by going to heaven, where he/she are indulged forever in all the good things that were on earth and more, things no one ever dreamt of or heard about. The Holy Quran tells Muslims (men and women) there will be good food, good wine and sex in heaven for all, but not in the bestial way you may think of, but rather in a way that is satisfactory for everyone and better than what was on earth. Heaven is no heartbreak or injustice land.  True Muslims are no terrorists, and Islam never calls for that, Islam means peace, it bans violence unless you were fought so you fight back, it only doesn't require Muslims to be cowards, and true Muslims understand this very well and never attack civilians.   Islam is the only religion that accepts freedom of religion and asks men to treat women gently like queens.   It's all in the Holy Quran and the right teachings of prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him).  If some people behave otherwise, then it's because people behaviour doesn't necessarily reflect the rulings of their religion always, for example, we can't (and don't) judge Christianity by Hitler or Madonna.  And that is another reason why there is heaven and hell after we die, heaven for the obedient and hell for the disobedient and/or oppressor, it's all going to be decided on the day of resurrection and judgement.  To be a Muslim, you must believe God is only one with no spouses or offspring, believe in his angels (servants not males or females), believe in all his religions, messangers and books equally, the day of judgement, heaven and hell and that everything is in God's hands and because of his will (good or bad).  Muslims believe God is the only divine who never dies, the creator who deserves to be worshiped, all prophets who came to earth are human messangers sent by him.  Muslims don't deny christianity, judaism, Jesus or Moses. They believe in them as the noble prophets and messangers of God, love and respect them so much.  We believe the birth of Jesus (messanger of God) was a miracle from God to us, being born by a mother only and with no father. God is the creator, he can do anything.  We believe Jesus (peace be upon him) is NOT dead till today; he wasnt even murdered or crucified as most people think. God (most glorified) made the man who betrayed Jesus be killed instead by switching their looks for a moment. Jesus was left up to live in heaven until the end of days when he will come back to earth again, with no new teachings or messages but just to make justice prevail instead of oppression, fight the imposter who will claim to be God and (most important) to perform his last prayer with the Muslims announcing he's too a follower of the last prophet (Muhammad) as all people should... then he really dies like other Prophets and be buried (peace be upon them all). So we're waiting for you Jesus, Messenger of God, to bring the world peace and pray with us. Thats what prophet Muhammad told us and this is what I believe in, Im a Muslim  so how do we know it's true? what is said in the last message and what should we do? read the following, and you'll figure out for yourself:|`|QGuxbItCaa	I think he died from boredom.

Heed them all & walk in his commandments.|`|db7df25ea31227e5641d5c32d43c3bcdaa	yes God warns that<br>  <br>  <br>  it applies to all the words of god not just revelation.|`|8b35140fd5eabcceff1f6c71562a2a02aa	Yes thats why its important to always back things up scripture x|`|rWP4suXuaa	Yes and lot of other places to! "accept jesus and live he is your only hope"<br>  <br>  <br>  God loves you...God bless|`|uD8d5V9Saa	That is true.  So what is your problem?|`|OT4SrmDXaa	Yes I have read that, what are you trying to say?|`|57yUAgfAaa	Well then why does the Roman Catholic Church add so much of their own stuff and then take interpretations out of the bible only to turn round a couple of decades later and change their mind!?  Like the whole suicide thing, the RC's used to believe someone who committed suicide went to hell, but recently decided that, oh, wait a minute, no they don't!?  Who told them?|`|mVsWyu0yaa	If anything were needed to prove that Revelation is nothing more than bible-babble-bull, that verse would do it. <br>  <br>  p.s. Might want to change your sign in name. Eusebius was the 'Christian' Bishop who declared that it was alright to LIE so long as it furthered the "faith".  Sort of puts you at a disadvantage, right at the start. lol|`|9ib0tC9Waa	Ya I did know that.|`|Um79JB1naa	Yep. Knew that. Your point?|`|FgdJpfiVaa	yes..it does say that...many times actually...<br>  <br>  what is your point?|`|g7wuTmA0aa	Yes, why yes we did know of that warning.<br>  On the other hand though, you should be asking mockers, fakes, heretics, long tongued liars, ramblers, backsliders, hatemongers, super fanatics, and so on about how they feel about that warning in the book of Revelations.<br>  Ask those who have foolishly misused and abused the pure spirit of zeal with their lack of knowledge of the Word of God, and filled in what they did not know with blasphemy's, lies and deceit in order to meet their own perverted agenda. Charismatically rousing the people and wowing them with long sermons, flashy backgrounds, flickering lights and so on, all wile sucking the pocket books, of those who are too distracted by all this, dry. Those poor people not even realizing they are being duped by the puppeteer on that "Stage" (what should be an alter) telling them fantastic lies that will tickle the ear and fancy of those who need a quick "feel good" fix. <br>  These lies so marvelous and eloquently put together that the masses are nearly brainwashed, and lash out against the truth with violence and hatred. Such lies can easily be made by simply taking the truth, and taking, or adding, what ever you need that borders reasonable, then sell it it like some type of produce. Just add the spices where ever they seem fit to be added, and scrape what ever can be scraped away without people noticing a change.<br>  It's like the butcher who tried to sell a 1pound bird to a wise woman. When she asked if he had anything with more meat on it, he went into his empty stock room for a few seconds and came out and put the same bird back on the scale. This time he hid the tip of his thumb at the back of the scale and pressed down. She saw it was 2 pounds and smiled. She said, " I'll take every part on that scale, to include your thumb."<br>  Edit: Be honost now, the Apocrypha really is a very good read with "some" truth in it. All we did was not include the books that was not included in the first place. For some reason, the Catholic church put it in. Fine, no harm truly done with that. It is after all a good read. The point that verse was trying to make, and you missed it to the point of sadness, is that the message contained in the Bible was not to be alterd like the way it has been by the people I described before the edit. The Catholic Bible and the Prodistant Bible message is the same. The books in both Bibles, save the Apocrpha, are the same. The alteration of the true books in the Bible though, the 66 books, are not to be altered in any way what so ever. This means no words to be added or taken away that would alter the message of those books and their true meaning. Such a thing is monsterus and most unholy to say the least. Translation from latin to english or another languege on the other hand is bound to take grammatical conjunction or other small words out or add some as to replace the grammatical conjunction so the reader can make sence of the messages in the Bible. Such a petty thing to argue about that seeing as the Catholics added words like, and, or, but, along with commas and other punctuations so that it can be clearly read without fail or argument when one line ended and the other began.<br>  The Christian Protestant will read the Apocrpha from time to time for study to see when and where some quotes have been scattered throught the Bible.<br>  Edit: Not saying I agree 100% with the Catholic Church, but I respect them and learn about the way they conduct mass. Hail Mary is a quote from the Bible when Gabriel Hailed Mary to tell her God's divine plan. The Catholic church does not in fact, pray to the Saints, but rather, pray "With" the saints. Like asking a friend to pray with you or for you to God.|`|Fo9ADQLBaa	Yes, my friend.  These are words of warning to be revered.<br>  The bible has been translated and revised so many times, I wonder...
rDFnsFf2aa	just make him aware that your dad is kind of scary and he's only trying to scare him.|`|8PA58u3kaa	Just Bring him over, and ask your dad not to be too scary. I don't think it will turn out that bad, he sounds like a good parent to me. Not only is he fine with your orientation and is willing to let you spend the weekend away with him (which believe me is 10 times better than many parents out there) but he is also just trying to make sure you're with a trustworthy guy.|`|gLVbSrx6aa	tell your boyfriend to act like he is another one of your guy friends and not to act boyfriend-ish in front of your dad. i've had boyfriends over that i'd tell my mom after they left that they were, but because they acted like a friend and weren't all over me, she minded a lot less|`|4NyZDzjqaa	i think u should let ur boyfriend no how ur scary dad is and maybe ur boyfriend will be aware of it and no how to act and no wat to say around him. but u wont no unless u give it a chance|`|8BRdSzoaaa	Have him over for dinner and tell him the way your daddy is and tell him no hand holding or kissing in front of your dad to act like your best friend like he did before and make small talk about school or work but not about the two of you good luck.|`|oYD7QkYsaa	Just do if but maybe you should talk to your dad and ask him to behave, I image dinner will be a little tense but at least you get a weekend with your bf:-) have fun|`|Hcc9fxqJaa	well maybe your dad will be alright with this since his already accepted you have a boyfriend and i think he will behave|`|DIj072Sqaa	Maybe there's no need to speak to your father but you should give your bf a health warning before the meeting. I imagine he's the one most nervous so I think is the one you need to talk to the most.
SF1uPJZhaa	All correct. :)<br>  <br>  Do not bother me. = Lass mich in Ruhe. / St?r mich nicht. / Nerv mich nicht.<br>  <br>  edit: Because there is only one verb in the sentence. If you have a modal verb and a second one, then the second goes at the end. Like:<br>  I went swimming in the ocean. = Ich war im Meer schwimmen.|`|MeeJWmGtaa	Perfect.<br>  <br>  And "Lass mich in Ruhe!"|`|10bb153a928c9693ebec1b2660853526aa	My German is beyond beginner, but my instinct tells me "macht" should be at the ends of those sentences, like "Das M?dchen Hausaufgaben macht." I could be completely off, though.<br>  <br>  @ Sedora: Why in this case is it correct to leave it "Das M?dchen macht Hausaufgaben" instead of "Das M?dchen Hausaufgaben macht"? I'm just curious. :)<br>  <br>  @ Sedora: Ah-ha, okay. Thanks!
J3Dva3sAaa	Yeah the people that have good looks tend to be snotty and rude haha. They are the ones that have everything going for them yet they complain and whine.|`|VEoURHoCaa	yea i agree.
WYk0zYdhaa	Heck yeah!<br>  <br>  I not only believe but I follow HIM and have accepted Jesus and His plan of redemption for us.  It's all about personal relationship.    <br>  <br>  "Even the demons believe and tremble".|`|xieiM0FRaa	No, my religion of choice is Buddhism, for so many reasons. Partially because too many people tried to force God and Jesus on me, when I wasn't sure what I believed in. It made Christianity unappealing, but that's not the only reason for it.<br>  <br>  But good for you, I'm happy that you're content with your beliefs, as some people are not.|`|cl4wdRnvaa	I believe in a Universal God. I'm a Deist/Pantheist and I do not believe in Jesus. there is no historical proof of his existence. I was raised Roman Catholic.|`|4di2FUSUaa	I dont believe in Jesus, i dont believe in God, or heaven or hell. I dont go to church at all. I am an atheist. I dont judge anyone for their religion, just dont try to force ur religion on me or i will say some things that i hate saying....|`|OMgF0RcIaa	I believe that jesus may have been a living man once...but i don't believe there is a god up in heaven listening to all your prayers.|`|AA10527991	There is no god, and the sooner you come to that realization the better off you life will be.|`|K8QTdUnfaa	And what exactly has god saved you from that you couldn't have achieved on your own?|`|T588vfJDaa	Yes. but not in the way you do|`|WUeNGH3daa	Seems that this god hasnt saved you from you own ignorance|`|0k8ZPfx2aa	Yes, but not in Paul, so that keeps me out of most Christian churches.|`|LxxrrKn9aa	Nope, never will.|`|R3V27Zwdaa	of course I believe|`|db7df25ea31227e5641d5c32d43c3bcdaa	yes I do|`|d4ab69OKaa	No I don't. Can you tell me what your God have saved you from?|`|b73d4eb6bf979588795fb3b329f48afaaa	Not particularly.<br>  <br>  Why do you want to know?<br>  <br>  Outside of a chance to crow?|`|wdnbwViFaa	yes! of course|`|f4uYkNwkaa	nope never have and never will.|`|bb5e3162f4c207ab157801f357f83c36aa	Jesus is almost certainly a character in Greek religious fiction of the first century, loosely based on various earlier prototypes.<br>  <br>  There is no evidence of an active god.  Prayer has, at best, the function of a placebo.|`|WjRqYf6naa	Yes, I do. Oh, and your religion is Christian. Your denomination is Methodist.|`|4yg7zZZ2aa	No. There is no reason to, there is no evidence for either.|`|nw0fqXj9aa	No I don't. I'm happy for you. *hands you a ball* Have fun.|`|WQvqLnnhaa	There in lies so many problems.... as you said, your religion is Methodist. Not a Christ follower, not just a denomination.<br>  <br>  By the way you should pray more than just once a day before bed. It should be full of thanks and praise, not just a wish and want list.|`|1fB2UdRHaa	You should probably use proper grammar and spelling.<br>  <br>  Anyway, yes, God is my savior, Jesus Christ is the way, the truth, and the light.|`|MVT34FZsaa	Yes, I believe in the Biblical Jesus who has always been God and who is the Creator God and Jehovah and Elohim|`|fqLo4HvKaa	Neither - and Methodist is a Christian denomination, not a religion.|`|Xg1ZR4ptaa	both are the same. and I pray to him every night.

MPCfQuT5aa	Don't believe everything reported by the media - they are only interested in extremes, for obvious reasons. Like anywhere in the world Britain has it's fair share of good and bad, but remember that most of us are tolerant, fair minded people.|`|Kz2n6P1Vaa	I'm a bit........shocked!!!!|`|4D059ohkaa	I'm certainly not homophobic or racist.  Don't believe everything you read in gutter press, most of its just bollocks.|`|8ZUVToXgaa	I don't know what to say, other than, "How sad...."    :(|`|61c8oevtaa	It's not just Britain, it's everywhere.    It must be human nature to hate people like that, because we've been doing it for ever.     And yes, homophobia is bad, but it's getting better. 50 years ago, gay relationships were illegal. Now we can get married, adopt kids etc and it's illegal to discriminate against us, so I think we should be thankful about how lucky we are to live here and not in one of the many countries where being gay is punishable by death.    =]    Edit: I'm half Italian - trust me, it's a lot worse there.|`|W545hqrpaa	Wow!|`|fdkegbwgaa	it does not surprise me, we had an open day at college for the LGBT centre in our local area nd we certainly got a bit of abuse so yea it's not gone away.  It is getting better though.  As Luca said you don't die here because of it and we do have a lot of laws now, but it still needs to go further.  I also worry about the backlash going on with the British workers etc, I understand what they are saying I Just hope it does not turn into racism|`|aCdya2qkaa	I know what your saying mate i wouldnt blame Britian I blame the Royal Family, the Queen the Ahem..couch**couch** got all the treasure, we got jackanory !!|`|iCzMOXOWaa	the country is f*****d up!run by an idiot government and full of foreigners,rapists and murderers,and yes 90 per cent are selfish,and brits hate everyone,and everything,and we love to moan and groan endlessly,and we do nothing about it we are a paranoid under the cosh and meek,the british bulldog has lost its ba**s.|`|5a2eKYynaa	Yeah, it really sucks that a lot of our country is homophobic. But at least our laws are more liberal about it than a lot of places. Hopefully this means the country's attitude will soon follow suit, especially since we're mostly less religious than, say, the US. I think everyone always hates something, we're just unlucky enough to be the targets at the moment.|`|AfbjU9Guaa	Once again, someone comes on here and pointlessly generalises.|`|1f5996779efb6a4589f7767428fbc708aa	Sometimes homophobia arises when certain events take place. The recent report that a gay couple were intent on adopting two children in preference to the children's grand parents stirred up hostility to gays once again. Is is homophobic to accept that some people are gay by nature but believe that it is not right that they should be allowed to adopt or foster children?|`|PC6SC6jyaa	That's the reason, when I reach University. I am going to study Spanish and Russian. So my choices of countries are ENDLESS.
2059629ba703ea51b813a449b0cb4431aa	Yep, I think you definitely nailed it. Better hope all those elephants keep their footing, huh?|`|42pr8akBaa	Pretty sure the elephants don't fall.  But if they did then the disc would probably just crash into A'Tuin's back.  Like when Twoflower and Rincewind went over the edge of the disc and somehow fell down.  A'tuin definitely has some weird gravitational properties.|`|e4faab4ffbfc5318a5f2dd566f521533aa	You need to ask Terry Pratchett.|`|UOIcXs7Haa	Isn't there a fifth elephant?|`|C1SOqQSkaa	Don't worry. The Fifth Elephant will be automatically summoned.
bYDVTv7Maa	They pay with brain cells.    D:|`|QMbaeva9aa	Biblically, somewhere, tithing is required (not just OT), but my church doesn't enforce it. It's a matter between you and God.|`|bxYWJAYNaa	Yep, 1/10th of their packed lunch.|`|pRF5LLloaa	Only individual and churches doomed by legalism require tithing.    Tithing is an Old Testament ritual that Jesus got rid of in the New Testament.  in the New testament, you give what you can, IF you can, and you give any amount that make you happy (the Greek word used there actually means "hilarious"), including Zero.    Only those individual and churches that don't fully understand the New Testament still require you to give 10% of your income (or allowance) to the church.|`|7NugugsDaa	WOW you have a lot of questions about children it's starting to really creep me out.|`|mfSp38yzaa	My son does. He receives $10 allowance a week, and at least $1 goes back to the Church. If he gets in trouble at school, he loses money, but still owes the Church a minimum of $1.    EDIT: Not in a paid position. I hold a seat on the council, and volunteer 2 Sundays a month (but I really just do that because a friend works for the Church, and if I didn't volunteer, she'd have to work every Sunday). If you're asking if I answer these questions because the Church asks me to, the answer would be no. I just like R&S.|`|XN0cYCATaa	For one thing Children don't have any Money to speak of, They can hardly "pay" attention in Church, so how are they to 'Pay' tithes ?    Edit: This Is my way of "lightening up"    Perhaps I am not the one who needs to lighten up
EyCgjjV4aa	uh, u need to prepare your self for the possibility they may never get the point. We all hope they will when there older, but reason dosent even kik in till the spawn hit their 20's. Also..  they prolly do get the point, they just wont admit it no matter how much u spank them or throw out there toys. Kids are stubborn, its human nature|`|18f23c8e100103ef2ddb3c61fe1e09e3aa	There are so many variables in your question that I cannot even begin to comprehend them all.  Here are some:    1. What kind of parents you two are; e.g., are you consistent, fair, loving, instructional, etc. in your discipline    2. What kind of kids you have; e.g., some kids are just more rebellious than other kids.      3. The relationship you all have.    My wife and I got lax in some of our discipline just recently and the next thing we knew, our kids were "blowing off" just about everything we said.  It went like this: "Allison, pick up that toy."  "Okay."  We ASSUMED she would do it and didn't follow through on it.  An hour later, we realized, she never did it!  "Allison!  I TOLD YOU TO PICK UP THAT TOY!  WHY DIDN'T YOU DO IT?!"  She gave us the world renown, "I forgot."      What are you going to do?  Well, the first thing we did was took some of the blame for them suddenly "forgetting" all the time.  It started slowly with a few genuine forgets.  But because we had gotten lax overall, those blended right in with the times they actually did follow through.  We were basically ignoring their responses.  So, no rewards for good behavior and no punishment for bad.  That's lukewarm parenting!  Shame on us!    So, we kicked it up a notch!  When I tell one of my kids to do something, I stay tuned.  I WATCH THEM!  (I try to be subtle about it, but I am aware.)  I give them a reasonable amount of time.  If they don't do it, I immediately meat out a punishment, like ... "You have to take your bath first."  (They fight every night about who's turn it is.  They take turns "going first.")  Or ... "You have to go to bed 30 minutes early.  The more consistent we are with catching them doing these things, following through on a punishment that they don't like, the better they behave.    But what if they were simply rebellious kids?  I was such a kid!  What if they said, "Screw you!"  That's a different issue that I pray I never face.  That's war!  That's a battle for being the head of your house.  I don't know what to do then.    But discipline is not just punishment.  You teach them why you tell them to do the things you do.  Why it's important that they listen.  And what the consequences of bad behavior are.  Consistency, fairness, love, and even a touch of merciful forgiveness go a long way.    Lord bless.|`|usfVqbajaa	yes|`|AA11220299	Usually once makes the difference.|`|XN0cYCATaa	It takes a while, Hence the reason we don't present them with the Gospel in such a way as they cannot understand it.    1Cr 3:2 I fed you with milk and not with solid food; for until now you were not able to receive it, and even now you are still not able;|`|6TuyXuJRaa	Your talking about two different viewpoints. Sometimes you might never agree or "get it".|`|YOt6uTSzaa	Unfortunately, some children never do.....sometimes a life time.  If you are speaking personally about a child of yours and not God's children, I truly feel for you...it is so difficult and trying....wishing you all the hope and strength you need.|`|s40sgQ45aa	Example from last night concerning my boys that would not settle down to sleep...    Bedtime is a time for sleep.  After sometime of playing around and keeping up other siblings I gave both my boys 2 choices.      1st choice...  They can remain together in their room as long as they went to sleep    2nd choice...  Separation    Their choice by their actions.    Sometimes they make the choice that benefits them.  Sometimes they don't...  Last night they both chose option  2 though they were unhappy with it.|`|HVY2rqzfaa	If the problem is the message rather than the children's comprehension - then forever.    This question disturbs me for some reason.|`|AA12193600	But if you kill them and condemn them to eternal torment you never have to worry about such disrespectful behavior again--that's what a loving parent would do, isn't it.  I mean they have to learn a lesson--don't you think eternal torment would teach them this valuable lesson?
KqiiT1WSaa	WE do.<br>  <br>  When he gives sources he quotes them in Arabic, and then translates the sources to English. And does the talk in English.|`|dtRkn4Jlaa	Actually in the khutba, a lot of duas are made, so they make them in Arabic as all duas are in Arabic, its just we don't know them, or if we know them, we haven't memorized them. As for the Baeen, it should be done in English if that is the majority language. But it could be that the Imam doesn't know English, or doesn't realize that majority don't understand Arabic. Best think would be to go talk to your Imam, tell him your concern and ask him if it could be done in English, or if he could do a small part in English too, so listeners can understand what is being said. <br>  <br>  As for reward, just being in the mosque with the intention of praying and listening to Khutba and Baeen, you are getting great reward. And by talking to the Imam and trying to see if he could make it easier for you and everyone else to understand, you will get even greater reward.  You will get reward for every person who was having a trouble and due to you would be able to have a better understand. <br>  <br>  Take care and may Allah make it easy for you to understand and learn. Amen.|`|QIgrBrFdaa	Yeah I agree. Living in Britain, giving the Khutba in English would be a wise thing to do! It's nice to know all the Arabic quotes etc, but most people don't understand it, they should do translations.<br>  <br>  My local mosque is similar, the Imam gives the Khutba in Urdu, which certainly doesn't appeal to the younger people, they don't understand what is being said and so are less motivated. It would be much more effective if the Imam gave the Khutba's in a language that the majority of the Muslims attending would understand, especially the younger generation.|`|SCkhQc2Caa	It is agreed upon by the scholars that Khutba should be given in Arabic Language and it is more better to do so. <br>  <br>  However scholars also agreed upon that there is no harm if it is given in a language other than Arabic specially when the majority includes "Ajams".<br>  ________________________________|`|Eeo6HPvuaa	I totally agree with you.  But I think they do get rewarded its not their fault they don't understand it. Their doing a good deed at least by listening.  Allah Knows best.<br>  <br>  I myself don't know Arabic either.|`|NlQhkgFCaa	Either you blokes learn Arabic or go get an English Imam|`|zKQKl9mZaa	We should. Its important to understand the Khutba to increase our knowledge.|`|zBqt99avaa	I've been told that here in Canada the imam gives the sermon/khutba in english.  That's kind odd that your imam doesn't.  Someone should right him a letter making the suggestion.<br>  <br>  Does he speak English?  Does your masjid offer Arabic classes?|`|4ViYw6Hxaa	We have Irish American Muslim Imam|`|be059bdf4ef4d8d4f864f42d17a8e06eaa	I'm going to say yes.   I think you do get the blessings for simply attending.....but the whole purpose is to teach you something...remind you of things you may have forgotten........that doesn't work if most people don't understand.|`|n49i9t6paa	Yeah, I dont understand Arabic, so I'd appreciate it a lot if they did, but I'm just going to learn arabic.|`|nS7koC7Oaa	Khutba is not Qur'an, yes people should understand the khutba since it's a part and parcel of the Jum'ah,,|`|Cugx9IXraa	why don't you ask the imam?
NlQhkgFCaa	Interesting :)|`|WyjRm10jaa	interesting..
uFAoq4idaa	I have not celebrated any birthday when I was small until I was 18 years old. That was the most memorable birthday I ever had. I was in Manila with my old maid aunt. We were living in my uncle's house. His wife an aunt also [they are cousins so much in love with each other]  took the burden of celebrating my debut. She prepared everything for the party and she even invited a famous movie teen star. That was my first birthday celebration and the best ever. Comes this February 14 will be my 66th birthday. I don't worry so much about the celebration. My children since they have already income of their own are making this important day of my life a joyful one. Praise God!|`|NkKfvuqNaa	I love birthdays and i can't wait to be 15 in 3 weeks! i'm sorry to hear that you don't enjoy them|`|AzwqJ6Hdaa	I use to like birthday's and yes,I enjoyed them, but now that i'm getting older(i'm 23) I wish I could go back to being a kid. LOL!|`|76cAAPfBaa	Wait a minute, think for a second: birthdays are GOOD, regardless!    The year you don't celebrate a birthday, means you died!!    Having a birthday therefore, is GOOD!!|`|T4t9ZtT7aa	It depends, before my 6th brithday they, sucked, from my 6 th bday to my 18th they were good because my dad was in my life and he cared whether i had fun or not whereas my mum didnt.(on my 18th my mum hired a pink limo to go to a club, that sounds nice right? but she invited her friends and i was not allowed to invite anyone until she'd decided how many of her friends were coming then i could invite people to fill spaces. It was my birthday!) My 19th birthday was the most amazing birthday ever because i spent it with the love of my life.        EDIT Thanks, all you need is one special person to make your day perfect, i refuse to have anybody else there on my bday cept my man, do you have someone like that, boyfriend/girlfriend, friend? Its easier than pretending to be grateful for other people that are there when all you really want is for them to go way!|`|qlcY8aKFaa	The only birthday's that ever enjoyed is the ones when I was a kid until I realized that I was getting older|`|fB6sDPloaa	The best birthdays I've had ... a small few, is when I have been surrounded by some of my favourite people in the world. I think it was 3  of my closest friends & 3 of my closest relatives. Nothing wild or outrageous happened, but being surrounded by my favourite people in the same place at the same time made me feel really special. And I'd prepared my favourite foods. Luckily for me, the dishes weren't difficult to prepare. The dishes turned out just how I like them & nobody complained about my cooking. Those were good birthdays.        (By the way, my birthday is in a few days too- no kidding. I've been around for 1/3 of a century. All the best for yours.)
k4T1Jgblaa	What REALLY irritates me is when people wear a neat jacket and white shirt with old jeans- it's ridiculous!  Jeans are casualwear, and should not be worn with formal clothes.<br>  <br>  You're right, you should always make the most of yourself at a job interview; jeans just aren't good enough.<br>  <br>  They USED to make jean-style trousers out of other materials, like good quality cotton which did not go baggy.

AA11622701	Isn't it interesting that the scripture in Isaiah 6 that you stated as a hiding of the message from Gentiles, is quoted by Jesus in Matthew 13:15 as a hiding of his message from those Jews who came out to listen to him, and by Paul in Acts 28 as a hiding of the message of Christ from the Jews so that he could be preached to Gentiles.    God has made different covenants with different groups over the centuries.  Including covenants with non-Jews such as Enoch, Noah and Job.  One of the covenants, and one of the most important, was with the Jews.  But God kept the Gentiles out of the covenant - kept them from understanding it - because he had a better deal waiting for them.    To bring that covenant about, it required that Jesus be rejected by enough of the Jews that he be crucified, and the Christian faith reject by enough Jews that it be extended to the Gentiles.    So Isaiah's statement does not appear to be a blanket reject for all time of all Gentiles, but a statement that at that time in history it advanced the purposes of God to exclude them from the Jewish covenant for a time, so that he could bring them into a better covenant through Christ.|`|ZDrXFS2daa	He had a better plan for the Christians.|`|mNyhRGowaa	Hard to really answer that one. We do know that Gods chosen people (Israel) rejected him and he provoked them to jealousy by going to a people who did not know him (Gentiles) and to this day the gift is free to anyone who will accept it, even though originally it was meant for his original people only  ( in scripture)|`|HGadAqG9aa	probably because the gentiles might have jeopardized God's ultimate plan to save the whole world through Jesus.|`|q6H2ru3waa	what are you reading dear?|`|bxYWJAYNaa	Um, maybe he was a bit of a racist.    Seriously, I can't think of any proper reason why not.

It's a lot like saying "Well, if you don't believe what I say, you're just stupid" without making any effort to define why it's stupid or even what it is in general they feel is so intelligent about their own viewpoint.  It attempts to thwart further discussion, but in reality is a house of cards that is afraid of the next tiny wind.
EiiVMtjyaa	Dear Friend,<br>  <br>  I am sure that Satan is telling God every reason from A-Z why he should have my soul dragged to Hell, so that I can be locked in chains for eternity and forced to worship him with wailing and gnashing of teeth.<br>  <br>  But...Jesus is MY Advocate (spiritual attorney), and He speaks to the (Judge) the Father, on my behalf because of my relationship to Him and says, "This one... is with Me."

He can only use what comes out of your mouth and your own actions against you, to torment you with feelings of guilt and self loathing ect. God is all knowing and has already forgiven you so nothing the devil can say to him would affect his love for the individual and the devil is a lier so I don't think God would even ingage in conversation with him.|`|IKif85LUaa	The question is better put: what is the devil telling you about yourself to bring you down, to cause you to do something that could effect you, or to bring fear into your life? In other words, the what might happen rather than what will happen. The best thing to do is to tell him to go. Jesus already took care of the devil problem. Just tell him to get and he has to obey. he is a whipped pup.|`|L6zpJkTxaa	i thought the the devil and god were not on speaking terms anyway?<br>  p.s i never saw the comment above me lol|`|D9lMg7A2aa	But since the book of Job we have a new and definitive development : "having a great High Priest, one who ever lives to make intercession for us.

rMB71kZ8aa	That is because evolution is a bunch of BULLSHIT  it makes absolutely no sense at all.  Of course these sensitive atheists are going to come up with all types of excuses to try and prove you wrong.  Anytime a person questions evolution as being the truth, they always claim that person is completely ignorant and has no knowledge about evolution.|`|X6RwSrJjaa	This argument is so misguided. I will go to the "If Men evolved from apes.. why are there still apes?" argument. Men did not evolve from the modern ape. It is just the easiest way to explain it without frying your little brains. But I will try and give you the benefit of the doubt and see if you can comprehend all this.     A very long time ago, there were ape-like creatures... that lived in the forests in Africa. Well... for whatever reason (whether it be food, drought, whatever) some of these ape-like creatures migrated into the African grasslands. Now, there are not as many trees in the grasslands as there are in a forest. So for a while, these ape-like creatures were having some trouble. They would have to run across the tall grass to get from tree to tree. Now, like modern apes.. they can be bi-pedal (that means walk like humans do) for a short period of time. So these ape-like creatures needed to do so more often in the grass lands to see over the tall grass to know if a predator is coming. This is the first huge evolutionary stepping stone. These ape-like creatures in order to survive have to adapt. Most when it comes to these certain stepping stones.. fail and the species becomes extent. Which happens most of the time. However, in this case... it is not. These ape-like creators got better and better at standing on 2 legs to the point where they could survive. Still possible that running was still on all 4's. These creators are our earliest ancestors called homo Erectors Now while homo erectus is doing their thing the ape-like creators that stayed in the forests are doing theirs. Now what makes homo erectus different from their ape-like cousins was just just that they were able to stand on 2 feet. Homo erectus became scavengers. Adding a lot more protein to their diet. What does that mean? Brain development! Nothing big, but it allowed homo erectus to be able to find meat. Simple stuff like "Thous things in the sky flying in cycles means there is some food below them." Now... a long time goes by, and homo erectus starts to become even more successful, learning to use basic tools, and eventually go from being scavengers and predators. There is a huge population increases once again... and to survive some homo erectus move north into Europe.     This is where its going to freak you creationists out. A long time goes by again and this time there is another huge change. The homo erectus species has now split in two once again. As it did with homo erectus and the ape-like creature... the climate and living conditions in europe are FAR different than in Africa. This is during the ice age. The homo erectus in Europe get fatter, bigger noises and become known as Neanderthals. Neanderthals learned to adapt to the cold and reserve the little food sources that they had. They were hunters, but had no real natural predators. While the homo erectus that stayed in Africa became known as homo sapiens. Homo sapiens continued to become better hunters and have access to fish. More protein means better brain growth. Along with that Homo sapiens had more natural predators that they had to deal with.    Now, a long time goes by again. The glaciers from the ice age start to melt and the homo sapiens ounce again start to migrate north for food. This is were homo sapiens and Neanderthals first meet. The whether is not as cold, so smaller animals are more likely to survive like a some kind of wild boars for instance. This is survival of the fittest comes in. Homo sapiens were better hunters and by the end of it all.. cause the extermination of the entire Neanderthal species. More time goes by and you get the picture. It is all 100% random. The ape-like creatures could have easily died out in the grasslands and then there would not be us. If any sort of event was changed.. it could have easily made us extent before we even started.     Hopefully now you retards will at least understand what we are talking about. The same is Wolves and Dogs. They both evolved.. and at one point they were the same thing. That is not the case with all animals however. Alligators for instance, have not changed much since the dinosaurs. No reason to change climate.. no food problems.. no reason to evolve. I really dumbed this down for you guys. We understand the Creationist Theory.. it seems only fair that you understand ours. Maybe some other time I will explain how every single animal on this planet is related. But to understand that, you need to be able to understand this first.|`|m09snBrEaa	its called divergent evolution. there are so many wolves that it is rare for every group to interbreed, so you get the groups of wolves evolving on their own, one group can evolve into something different without any requirement for the other groups to evolve in the same was or die off.|`|95s0Dlg9aa	Shhhh.

The selective breeding that has produced dozens of breeds of dogs is a pretty prime example of exactly what evolution does.|`|83Cvwbu1aa	More proof that creationists find it easier to let websites think for them than to actually learn...that takes effort.More evidence that creationist desperately want to avoid examining their own spiritual walk,and what pathetic humans they actually are,so they divert attention onto evolution,which should have no bearing on how they act.Evidence all the way around that creationists are lazy both intellectually and morally|`|X548yCR6aa	So, why wouldn't there still wolves?    Do you think God would smite all the other wolves if he notices a population of domesticated wolves or something? Speciation occurs when two populations of the same organism are separated for a long time and don't interbreed.    That said, this didn't happen long enough ago. Most modern canines can still interbreed, meaning they're the same species. But if dogs and wolves stay separated, they might diverge after enough time. First they will be like tigers and lions today, barely capable of interbreeding but never doing so in nature, then a complete divergence causing two separate species.|`|BZEN8QXbaa	The wolves that came up to us and worked with us during the hurting and gathering day,they were the nice wolves that trusted us ,so overtime the meanness was bred out of them,and we started getting involved breeding dogs to get what we wanted and so we end up with the modern dog...|`|vmn8hsb8aa	Excuse me, Mr Moron, but dogs came from DOMESTICATED wolves.

Just as there are many types of apes / humans / cats / snakes etc, there were and are many types of wolves. Some over time, domesticated and became known as dogs.

That's why I'm black and I'm guessing your white.|`|E870WbAsaa	Where did dogs come from? Similarities between the wolf (Canis lupus) and the dog (Canis familiaris) have long suggested that domesticated dogs originated in wolf populations that began to live along with people. But where did the first steps of domestication take place? Researchers have long eastern Europe or the Middle East    But a new study published in the November 22, 2002 issue of the journal SCIENCE suggests that dogs first apeared in eastern Asia. In fact, when the very first Americans crossed the land bridge from Asia roughly 15,000 years ago, dogs may have been at their sides. Researchers based their conclusions on DNA studies of modern dogs, and also of the remains of dogs from both the eastern and western hemispheres.

ixPskp3Oaa	:)  Buses don't have seat belts.<br>  :) Bus drivers are angry.|`|12VQ4ETcaa	Well, they could be safer.  I saw an elderly man slip and fall once because the aisle was wet.<br>  <br>  But I've also been on two buses that were hit by cars, and you could barely even feel it.<br>  <br>  It's also safer than walking or riding a bike because if anyone bothers you, you can tell the driver.  He can even radio the police and have them meet someone and arrest them - I've seen that happen.|`|AA11296044	I really don't think buses are unsafe.<br>  <br>  The reason for not having belts is becuase of the size of the bus, they are large enough to absorb a pretty good impact.   A seat belt would only make (in god forbid and accident) clearing the bus complicated.<br>  <br>  It is not the norm of the driver to jam on the brakes when they are stopping, they should come to a gradual stop.  If this is an issue take it up with your local transit authority.<br>  <br>  I do take the bus every day, often in very crowded standing room only buses and have never had an incident.|`|nDAnSuVBaa	Well I go on one to school everyday so yeah.<br>  <br>  I went to town today and the bus was all over the frickin place, I think the driver's take the pissss when it comes to bumps though don't they?<br>  They seem to speed up over them so later you have a bruised bum.<br>  <br>  :/<br>  <br>  I agree.|`|rThIVk2maa	Perhaps you should take this up with the manager of the transportation office.

mOWyzwubaa	you may do optional fast for Allah Allmighty,|`|3E2EQH12aa	nothing better than fasting whats sunnah, except fasting Ramadan. personally i do fast mondays and thursdays and find it very beneficial. aside from prayer its nice to have something to keep u grounded, and your mind on whats important|`|be059bdf4ef4d8d4f864f42d17a8e06eaa	Get blessings for fasting....more for following the sunnah.   Not to mention its a spiritual reboot.  Nothing is physically forcing you to fast.  So every time you get hungry, but choose not to eat...you remember its because of god.  It keeps god on your mind.   You become more mindful of your actions.  Making sure they are complying with islam.      The prophet said the best fast is the fasting of david.   Fast 1 day...dont' the next..following day fast...and so on.   So every other day.    And since david is a prophet..doing his fast is also sunnah.|`|vnty8yOgaa	One Optional fast is equal to ten Fasts. If you fast 3 days a month that will be considered fasts for the whole month.|`|5ofS2qQYaa	"If we want to discover which is better, fasting on Mondays and Thursdays or fasting three days of each month, we find that fasting on Mondays and Thursdays is better than fasting on three days of each month, because if a person fasts on Mondays and Thursdays each week, that means that he is fasting eight days each month, so he will have done both: fasted on Mondays and Thursdays and fasted three days of the month."

Look closely into yourself and try to understand the dynamics of happiness and sadness (or lack). Its like you have a cup and you can fill it, sure; but to fill it again you have to empty it.    This is because we live in our "will to receive", and the will to receive functions on moving from one desire to the next, and develops through different incarnations. However true fulfillment, as in fulfilling an others desires, then this is a method of fulfillment that transcends the life of the corporeal body. Living in the will to bestow, is the method of transcending your own desires, also called "unconditional love". Of course religion talks about this, as in love others, or two people praying together etc, but aside from lacking a method to attain this, it also treats this issue on a very corporeal level by literal interpretation of the words.

You can certainly mantain basic human morality in college--even if you do learn things that make your realize that your membership in a cult is nothing more than a membership in a cult.|`|759ae5ae6e1570ab62326b25526ef339aa	Pick a Christian college or one with strict rules. And then pick your friends wisely. You don't have to use drugs, get drunk, or have sex in order to have fun.|`|2242ab75cc3bad9ab4ca7fbaf5578defaa	It is definitely possible    Just mix with like minded friends and you'll be fine.|`|HOQp0gA7aa	As strange as you may find it, some Christians actually consider faith and fellowship more fun than lewd and drunken behavior.  Plenty of Christians sing, eat, play games, and spend time together as comrades.  In other words they are not much different than regular people except they consciously avoid committing the excesses some people pursue.    Of course in my experience there are plenty of self proclaimed "Christians" who fall off the boat of righteous behavior into drunkenness and fornication when they escape the restrictions of their families and faith at college.  During my college years I called a number of them out as the hypocrites they actually were when I caught them acting with such poor behavior.      What was my reason for being unkindly about their behavior?  Because none of them felt it necessary to hold their tongues when it came to condemning my Agnostic world view either.  If they wanted to hold the Bible up as a means of showing their moral superiority over me, then I was certainly going to hold it back up to them when they fail to abide by God's word.      So to answer the question, it is possible to have fun by doing what is fun within the bounds of acceptable Christian behavior.  It also is possible to enjoy yourself in college without subjecting yourself to the headaches of hangovers, or the regret of fornication with an unsuitable partner.      I hope this helps.

The only [given] difference between a gay person and a straight person is merely whom we date.

EVnlDpPUaa	I do enjoy some junk food on the odd occasion that i can afford the treat. Quite agree my friend,too expensive,for my pocket.|`|Onzxe6ysaa	healthy foods are more expensive. You can get a doughnut for 99 cents. you can get a bag of chips for 89 cents. Try making a salad and see how much that costs.|`|cd750eea4217ae61281dfe63b451de8eaa	It certainly doesn't cost more than natural organic produce, dairy products and meats.|`|vOYyFqxRaa	You have not been to a health food store lately. The prices there are way more than your average junk food.|`|R32J8Z4Yaa	junk food is not more expensive than healthy food.  It is far more expensive to buy fresh produce, low fat meat, and good multi-grain bread.  It costs the same to buy a bag of chips as it cost to buy one grapefruit.  I wish it were cheaper to buy healthy food!|`|y7HD8unTaa	Cuz it's a part of the program to see how long we can self medicate ourselves with sugar & toxins.  It builds character, doesn't it?  Sooner or later, it sends most of us to a doctor or clinic so they can take our blood for their experiments.|`|IhGE1m9daa	For certain the fast food industry has challenged the mentality of many of our youth.<br>  I think you should avoid them for awhile and see if your levals come down that you may be able to function again as a civil member of society.|`|zfXVF2XVaa	It doesn't, actually.

It cost more because it is prepared for consumption by someone who earns a wage for their efforts and eaten by someone who is too busy or too lazy to prepare the food for consumption by themselves.|`|1NO10YfPaa	It doesn't cost more. Healthy food costs more, as anyone on a limited income who wants to eat healthy can attest.
XEbrGfZuaa	A registered independent voter, is one who votes his or her conscience, disregarding any allegiance to a political party. They are<br>  interested in the best man for the job when voting. Doing their research on the qualifications of those persons running for that pos-<br>  ition, rather than voting according to one politcal partys' guidelines.<br>     It does not matter their prior affiliation. And it's obvious to me, that<br>  they became an independant, due to disagreements with their former<br>  party and those politicians who run their office with their own pockets<br>  in mind. I was raised to believe in democratic ideals, and I now see<br>  that the party no longer resembles it's original premise. And that there<br>  is corruption and greed among the two major parties. I would like to<br>  see more strength in those parties which support the constitution<br>  which want the preservation of our inalianable rights, rather than to<br>  allow more to be taken from us. I would actually like to see a total<br>  dismemberment of all political parties. With only candidates on the<br>  ballots representing themselves by the ideals they believe in, not by<br>  how much money they can raise to come out on top at the polls.|`|Ne9rXERpaa	No.<br>  <br>  I'd say it's more of a stance that the two-party system is a broken institution, and that fundamental changes need to be made.<br>  <br>  But in practice, I'd wager that a majority of independents would vote Democrat as the perceived lesser of two evils.|`|1NO10YfPaa	No.  I know a number of Independents who vote Republican more often than Democratic.|`|AA12005609	No it isn't. Many Independents can see the corruption in both parties and don't want to be associated with it.|`|1b9d6f92644c7ecc734f3330365356a8aa	where I live, it just means you don't get to participate in the primary elections|`|NvrVjOhBaa	Why would they need to be politically correct by associating with the Independents? More people are registered Democrat than any other party.<br>  <br>  Also, I think Independents tend to vote for the best candidate, despite their party affiliation. If that makes them seem more Democratic, then so be it.|`|r2bbLMUZaa	No, being independent means to not tie yourself to any party, and only to vote for those who are capable of keeping their promises. <br>  <br>  That most of these candidates also happen to run for the Democrats is simply coincidence.|`|FjsmaFcYaa	no, independents are another party aside from republican and democratic.....democrats are considered liberal, republicans conservatives, independents are  the are kinda the wildcards|`|eceLQUj5aa	Is it politically incorrect to be a democrat? I am an independent because I vote for who I want, and never along party lines.|`|SPh4ctPCaa	I'm a independent and I always look on both sides and make a decision. I just feel it's more safer to go this way instead of just going all out and hope for the best.|`|QOTLIRF7aa	no they believe in a little bit of everything from every major party|`|zfXVF2XVaa	No.  How does it feel, to think you know everything?|`|AA10653329	I'm sorry???|`|cXdoFRVsaa	Independent pretty much means you aren't part of any major party. These days being an Independent would mean you are not A republican or a democrat.|`|hyyBy2ofaa	no they think that they aren't either republican nor Democrat, They have different views on the issues.|`|dlXaZOXzaa	No, Independents simply do not affiliate themselves with any one party|`|DYoyrsT3aa	no they believe in both republican and democratic ideals.|`|wqchA8B7aa	No. Independent means you don't belong to either party, and you vote for who you think is best.<br>  <br>  edit: Apparantly you don't want to ask a question, just want to spout off and vote people down. What a sad life you must have, if this is fun for you.
bf4cc388616ba9cb48357f54373c609eaa	Because the stimulus package is only the Liberal  Democrats realization that now they can and will fund every social program that they ever dreamed of instituting in this country. They are aware that this is their opportunity to make the masses dependent on the government for every want and need.|`|zauQuf29aa	Most people believe that the stimulus package will not do enough if anything at all to reverse the economy. For the Dow to rise there has to be real hope that an even deeper recession can be avoided.|`|AA11828439	The Stimulus Package is only a first step in fixing the economy. Anyone who thought this would be a "Magic" wand was ignorant. The President even said it would probably get far worse before we saw any improvement.|`|2R3iJnFPaa	The stimulus package is just one  step.  Obama can't undo eight years of Bush/Republicans in less than a month.  Give the guy time.|`|zfXVF2XVaa	We all know that one piece of legislation isn't going to turn the whole thing around in a few days, weeks, or even months.  Even you know that, Redcore.  It's just another excuse to whine and rant on here about  a politician you don't like.|`|cd750eea4217ae61281dfe63b451de8eaa	It would be ridiculous to expect a package signed into law on Tuesday to reverse the current worldwide financial crisis.|`|AA12005609	Because Wall Street knows that the stimulus is just a pork project for corrupt politicians.|`|FjsmaFcYaa	because he can't magically fix the economy in a month like most people think|`|EVnlDpPUaa	Never heard of this bloke Dow,just a Tom Jones my friend.|`|wqchA8B7aa	Because the world is in an economic crisis due to massive Republican Greed and Mismanagement.

And production has been cut to<br>  allow the Arabs to increase the cost of it, according to demand.<br>    I don't see how Obama can do anything to intervene in this. We are<br>  sure to see staggering highs by summer, to again minimize efforts <br>  for vacationing outside of ones' back yard.|`|2R3iJnFPaa	The Arabs have cut production to raise prices.  Obama has no control over that, the public does.  Don't use as much, start combining your trips.  People waste too much.  As long as people keep paying the price they have no incentive to lower them.|`|o6MQWMo5aa	Well he seems to have given you the energy to ask so many questions. Just think of all the questions you couldn't have asked if the other guy won.|`|cd750eea4217ae61281dfe63b451de8eaa	I actually never heard President Obama promise to cure the nations ills in less than a month.  It would be nothing short of utterly ridiculous to expect him to do that.|`|AA12005609	Obama promised many things during the campaign. Many of us believed him. It is our fault!|`|IhGE1m9daa	Still making up for all those years of Bush drilling on his own pipeline.<br>  Here his summer home in Iraqi is comming along well.|`|AA10240238	By all your questions it is obvious you don't like Obama.

Now it wasn't until the taliban were removed from power and the American installed their government in afghanistan that drugs increased in production a million times.<br>  <br>  Now if you watch interviews with the taliban carried out BOTH by the BBC and an American radio station (I forget their name, but it is on youtube) then you will find them denying this allegation against them. However, you are not interested in the truth you just enjoy the proppaganda that is spewed against them<br>  <br>  What do i think of the taliban??

Western countries do not invade any other country based on<br>  the fact that it doesn't like the way that country rules it's people. a sad fact my friend is that there is no humanitarian give a care at all. Western influence on that region has failed and always will and the fact that they have control of the largest and most lucritive of worldwide commodities is one of the main reason's wetsern country's presence is even there. If you took the cash crop and it's value out of the equation you would see a real lack of interest on the US and Canada's part to even be there.

This earth would be a peaceful place if it wasn't for people like them. God is letting them sink deeper and deeper in their ways so his punishment can be equal to their ways. Know this that God's second greatest commandment is 'Love thy neighbor.' They want no part of that one. (I'm talking about the fundamentalists, not the good muslims who live in harmony with  their neighbors.)

The Ten Commandments are essentially a summary of the 600+ commandments contained in the Old Testament Law. The first four commandments deal with our relationship with God. The second six commandments deal with our relationships with one another. The Ten Commandments are recorded in the Bible in Exodus 20:1-17 and Deuteronomy 5:6-21 and are as follows:<br>  <br>  (1) “You shall have no other gods before me.” This command is against worshipping any god other than the one true God. All other gods are false gods.<br>  <br>  (2) “You shall not make for yourself an idol in the form of anything in heaven above or on the earth beneath or in the waters below. You shall not bow down to them or worship them; for I, the LORD your God, am a jealous God, punishing the children for the sin of the fathers to the third and fourth generation of those who hate me, but showing love to a thousand generations of those who love me and keep my commandments.” This command is against making a idol, a visible representation of God. There is no image we can create that can accurately portray God. To make an idol to represent God is to worship a false god.<br>  <br>  (3) “You shall not misuse the name of the LORD your God, for the LORD will not hold anyone guiltless who misuses His name.” This is a command against taking the name of the Lord in vain. We are not to treat God’s name lightly. We are to show reverence to God by only mentioning Him in respectful and honoring ways.<br>  <br>  (4) “Remember the Sabbath day by keeping it holy. Six days you shall labor and do all your work, but the seventh day is a Sabbath to the LORD your God. On it you shall not do any work, neither you, nor your son or daughter, nor your manservant or maidservant, nor your animals, nor the alien within your gates. For in six days the LORD made the heavens and the earth, the sea, and all that is in them, but he rested on the seventh day. Therefore the LORD blessed the Sabbath day and made it holy.” This is a command to set aside the Sabbath (Saturday, the last day of the week) as a day of rest dedicated to the Lord.<br>  <br>  (5) “Honor your father and your mother, so that you may live long in the land the LORD your God is giving you.” This is a command to always treat our parents with honor and respect.<br>  <br>  (6) “You shall not murder.” This is a command against the premeditated murder of another human being.<br>  <br>  (7) “You shall not commit adultery.” This is a command against have sexual relations with anyone other than your spouse.<br>  <br>  (8) “You shall not steal.” This is a command against taking anything that does not belong to us without the permission of the person to whom it belongs.<br>  <br>  (9) “You shall not give false testimony against your neighbor.” This is a command prohibiting testifying against another person falsely. It is essentially a command against lying.<br>  <br>  (10) “You shall not covet your neighbor's house. You shall not covet your neighbor's wife, or his manservant or maidservant, his ox or donkey, or anything that belongs to your neighbor.” This is a command against desiring anything that does not belong to you. Coveting can lead to breaking one of the commandments listed above: murder, adultery, and theft.

Mostly I think you meed to find a good friend you can count on so you can maintain some perspective when these wolves start preying on you. Having a true friend will help you be reminded that not everyone is like these people and then you won't feel so sad but only like it's comical that people would go to that extreme to get ahead. You might even start feeling empathy with them. Wonderful things happen when you have perspective to fall back on.

sPDOMTTjaa	Since we know from Isaiah 11:6 that animals will indeed be in Heaven, I would say that yes they do have souls.|`|nw0fqXj9aa	Not a single creature has one, including us.|`|xrtraIMGaa	Yes animals do have souls. A soul is a living being,individual,person(Genesis 1:7). The same is applied to animals sense they live breath and have personality.(Genesis1:20).Notice, it said "swarm of living souls"(animals in the water).<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.watchtower.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.watchtower.org</a>|`|rWP4suXuaa	The Bible does not give any specific teaching on whether pets / animals have “souls” or whether pets / animals will be in heaven. However, we can take some general Scriptural principles and shed some light on the subject. The Bible states that both man (Genesis 2:7) and animals (Genesis 1:30; 6:17; 7:15,22) have the breath of life. The primary difference between human beings and animals is that man is made in the image and likeness of God (Genesis 1:26-27). Animals are not made in the image and likeness of God. Being made in the image and likeness of God means that human being are like God, capable of spirituality, with mind, emotion, and will - and - have an aspect of being that continues after death. If pets / animals do have a “soul” or immaterial aspect, it must therefore be of a different and lesser "quality." This difference probably means that pet / animal “souls” do not carry on after death.<br>  <br>  Another factor to consider in this question is that God did create animals as a part of His creative process in Genesis. God created the animals and said they were good (Genesis 1:25). Therefore, there is no reason why there could not be animals on the new earth (Revelation 21:1). There will most definitely be animals during the millennial kingdom (Isaiah 11:6; 65:25). It is impossible to say definitively whether some of these animals might be pets we had while here on earth. We do know that God is just and that when we get to Heaven we will find ourselves in complete agreement with His decision on this issue, whatever it may be.|`|hvNqywbBaa	Catholic teaching doesn't actually deny that animals have souls.<br>  Pope John Paul II had declared that animals have souls.<br>  Also, if we look at Genesis, it is clear that God blesses the animals, even before he blesses (or creates) man. This would indicate, I think, the theological belief that animals do possess souls.<br>  <br>  A righteous man knows the soul of his animal - Proverbs 12:10 <br>  <br>  However, while Judaism has plenty of laws regarding the proper treatment of animals, normative judaism does not believe animals have souls. But it does teach that how one treats animals is linked to how one treats people. We prefer shepherds over hunters. We also believe animals (domestic) are to be rested on the Sabbath.<br>  <br>  I found this website......<br>  <br>  THE CATHOLIC STUDY CIRCLE <br>  FOR ANIMAL WELFARE<br>  <a href="http://www.all-creatures.org/ca/ark-186soul.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.all-creatures.org/ca/ark-186s...</a>|`|lJUyhMceaa	The "soul" is simply the mind, emotion, feelings, and experiences that each living thing has.

This doesn't mean animals will disappear; the all the animals that God created will still be on the new earth that God creates after the end of the world, in their original, pure forms.|`|ro0lmK5haa	They do not have souls because an animal can not be saved.

She already indicated she's broke and your suggestions entailed purchasing a camera, taking out comprehensive on her car insurance, taking out renters insurance, hiring a house sitter, and taking pic's of her apartment everytime she leaves.  This landlady knows her daughter and the circumstances without a doubt.  The renters are probably on drugs and alcohol.  Their behavior will not change.  The idea of determining who holds the deed to the land lady's property and contacting them will more likely result in them not getting involved as long as the mortgage payments are being made, why would they?

Why he would subject his quiet, peace-loving tenants to this one never knows.  I think it's very much to your benefit to send him a note about the noise and behavior and tell him that if it continues you may have to look for another place to live.  That doesn't obligate you to move, but it should motivate him to action.      Also, he has a duty as a landlord to make sure no unauthorized person has access to the keys.  If something does happen inside you apartment, contact the police and be sure they note that there was no forced entry.  This may help you should you decide to point the finger at the daughter, who recently came on their radar.  Then he would suffer the liability for any theft or damage for not keeping things secure.    You caution is justifiable, but please try not to be too paranoid.

I think it might be worth your while to park your car a few blocks away for a few days until things settle down.  or if there is a way park your car next to your window so you could see it at all times.  If  you don't see her mess with your car I don't think there is any way you could prove it was her.  I would hope her mom wouldn't be so immature to give her daughter the key to your place, but in this world I wouldn't be surprised if her mom did give her the key.  But the only thing I could think of is asking someone to house sit for you. Or take pictures of your place before you leave for work, try and make sure that whether you take pics from your phone or camera the time you took the  pic is recorded somewhere. That way you could prove you took the pics right before you went to work, and if things are trashed take pics right when you get back.  Hope everything works out for you, that's too bad...|`|3KKWVagaaa	First make sure you have comprehensive coverage on your vehicle this is in the event it is vandalized no matter who does it, it will get fixed.  Second go to the court or police station and file a TRO (Temporary restraining order) against her and her boyfriend to protect yourself and the person space around yourself. This may not deter an attack but at least there is record of the fact you fear for your safety. Make sure you have renter's insurance that would cover any damage or stolen property in the event they come into your home. Then find out the headquarters for the leasing company that owns the property where you live. Like for instance I live in VA and the headquarters and owner for my property is in CA.  Write a lengthy complaint to the company and property owner. They may not be aware this is going on. Forward copies of the TRO complaint and keep a journal and note all days and time of disturbances and what they are. Do not confront them anymore always call the police so there will be record of the event. These should help begin to solve the problem but it may not solve it completely. So you need to decide if you want to stay there after going thru all of this. B/c even if the above steps presents a remedy you will still have to see these people and may be subject to ridicule...Hope it all works out for you, but you should be able to be comfortable wherever you live.

It is not just a way to get sensual relief and exchange fluids, and we dont rape either for the same moral reasons I have already stated.    Love is everything, and it is not a gift from god.|`|wT1mHCM2aa	Your premises are incorrect. An atheist may not believe that we are just made of atoms, they may believe that they have a soul and still believe in morals. Similarly, many theists believe we are made of atoms etc. You cannot generalize for atheists or theists.   Basically yes, and please remember as well that not all theists are Christians.|`|G5JpK5Puaa	Do you claim that 2 thirds of the world who aren't Christian can't love. Of COURSE we can love. Stop asking silly questions and stereotyping us. Just because we believe that life was an accident doesn't mean we can't enjoy it! Everyone can love.|`|k4WlqPK7aa	it amazes me what you people claim to know, and what truths you claim are false. do christians know how it feels to conceive an original thought?|`|plZFYzlZaa	Yes...we can.     Love is a mammal emotion; it's our natural instinct. Not just in humans though, but other mammals as well.     Dolphins, apes, cats, dogs...etc.     I've lived my whole life not believing in God, and I've managed to meet and spend most of it with a woman whom has made me the happiest man alive.     Your description of atheists being "humans are just made of atoms and nothing more than another form of animals...", sounds more like Scientology than atheism. By understanding atheists, you'll have to study atheism itself. Every country in this world has their own type of religion; so who are Christians to say that atheism is wrong?     Start looking into some diversity, and you'll realize that us atheists have the same human morals and obligations in life as you Christians do.|`|dDprsKZYaa	"Without God nothing is wrong..."?    WTF?    Who shovelled that little nugget into your brain?    To call you a moron would be unfair to morons.....|`|a6f5efb2cbade02a525b433574402dc8aa	I do feel pity for people whose mind's have such a small scope that they honestly believe this sort of cr*p. I love, have loved, and am loved. Of course we feel it, we're human. Love may be a evolutionary imperative, but that doesn't mean it's not wonderful. Nature came upon this solution by pure serendipity and as one of the subjects of this solution I am affected as equally as any christian, in fact probably more so as I am not loaded up with the guilt and split loyalty that can restrict that love.|`|c5X6IOclaa	Why would we want to go killing and stealing because there is no God. I do the right thing because I believe it is the right thing and I would like to see mankind Truly prosper and live right. It is common sense. Morals shouldn't be made and followed out of fear of God and eternal damnation. They should be common sense and for the betterment of human kind. We do love but we understand that things like time and love are all man made and is a thought. It is not a real physical thing but comes from the individual mind and is more of an attachment and care for or about something or someone.    Time and love never existed before we gave them definitions and created the concepts of time, love, faith, belief, mental anguish. They all existed in different forms but did not come to be what we now know them as until we created them and gave them power and meaning.    We love, and we love better..    I am an Athiest.|`|B12rW6Dsaa	Well i must say first up that i can't really fathom the answer you are seeking????1/atheists have no beliefs by definition of the word.2/the whole point of this life is to prove we are above the other creatures we  were created with on this miraculous life providing(maybe creation and miracles are all about us ever second of our lives,we go from under 10lbs to over 150 on average,where that come from?we go from a tadpole/egg to enough intestines to stretch thousands of miles?????that is bizarre and where did it come from?oxygen,carbon etc...where it eventually come from?the un fathomable heat of our miraculous sun?where does that come from because logic(fk sience ok) says we have no remote idea what the sun could possibly be,not substance,existence or anything else that a true scientist ONLY will happily admit with adequate awe and wonder.ok now souls are simply our bodies our carrier of the spirit,our spirit.no other creature on earth has a spirit only humans.its a fact.spirit is our conscience he part of us made in god's image in genesis.every one of gods children has a spirit,a conscience,to question things in a just,humble and irreverance simply for our existance.satan asked the first unfair,selfish,bold assuming question,the original sin...The word "devil" means someone who tells wicked lies about another person. "Satan" means an enemy or an opposer. These are terms given to God's chief enemy. At first, he was a perfect angel in heaven with God. However, he later thought too much of himself and wanted the worship that rightly belongs to God.Matthew 4:8-10.    in my logic it means if you question against your conscienc(for rtue conscience is truth itself.it is a fight for survival strictly speaking,the fight is in ur mind,where our whole world exists without doubt.the strong minds ,the learned,the knowing,the wise, the peaceful, is all in ur mind,exercise the muscle cradling ur spirits only way of existing in this world...a true believer is so because he knows all the answers,until then u want to believe.i am a wannabe believer too so be fair in how u judge or waste ur time.secret of life.romance is a word invented by poets,it pertains to love in no way.nothing exists but through god nor without him,therefore not one thing existing that is not from/out of god.of course logic demands acceptance that the devil/evil only exists because of god,that he permits evil.which of course he does and is until this system of things is totally exhausted.meaning quite possibly a miraculous self destruction of the miraculous existence of mankind on planet earth,milky way style.the rape quip is bizarre.but the last poor attempt at either sarcasm or very inept attempt at some none exist point?look up the meaning origin of word romance/tic/er before you make a NON CHRISTIAN JUDGEMENT OF OUR FATHERS LOST SHEEP.ACCEPTANCE IS WAT REPLACES THE ANTI=CHRITIAN NOTION OF ANY FORM OF  JUDGEMENT AND|`|6542d65c904582403b7e46c7c170a38eaa	I have no words for how completely ridiculous this is.  How is it you can be this ignorant and still remember to breathe?|`|eBKJRmEgaa	Simply because love is known to be emotional attachment caused by, among other things, chemicals and psychology, does not mean it is any less real for those that know this.|`|2259822f0cd7ff32d9ffac0f2a824a63aa	"Able to feel" ?  Surely, AND with godless abandon.|`|urIm4YaBaa	We can and we do.     If you can't conceive of how this is possible, I recommend that stop trying to second-guess how we think.|`|PjwWWMu4aa	Empathy.    All that typing and it only merits a one word answer, which is patently obvious to anyone who is not a psychopath. Pathetic, really.    Also, just because we know what is going on when we experience feelings like love, doesn't make the feeling itself any less wonderful. Or terrible, depending on how emo you are.    Also, survival of the fittest does not mean what you think it means.|`|FI916ISFaa	This atheist loves his wife and God has nothing to do with it.|`|RC1r1tsHaa	Of course we love, that's an absurd assumption!|`|oojO4WAraa	Of course they do.  You religious people are misguided.  Humans can love.  You guys just made up god.  God is not necessary to love.|`|baaf30673b204103b269ddf718be2c5caa	That is fatuous beyond comprehension. I love because, well, because I do, frankly. I pity you if you think that you can only love because the Sky Pixies says you can.    I have many emotions, none of them God Given.|`|mAE7vbX6aa	I'm not an atheist, but there is one part of your question that is just simply wrong.  I would be remiss if I didn't point it out.  Rape is a crime of violence, be it against a man or a woman.  Rape=violence, period.  It has nothing to do with reproduction or any of the good things God blesses us with.  Rape is not sexual.  It is only a way for someone to assume power over another.  And, of course, atheists can enjoy romantic love like us Christians. As you can see, I don't believe in attacking another's beliefs simply because they don't agree with mine.|`|7ylYxklsaa	Are you serious?    What are you looking for? No, only you Christians are human. Everyone else is an animal with no feelings and isn't worth life.    Really?     What a narrow-minded sad little world-view: 'Anyone who is not like me is unworthy of human respect and kindness.' That's the attitude that breeds racism, hate, bigotry, and just so many problems with people and the world.     Step outside the box once in awhile and please realize that you aren't the only human here. Your god didn't preach arrogance. Your god didn't tell you that anyone who is not Christian is an animal. Your god did tell you that you should treat others as you would wish to be treated, and right now you're asking to be condescended to and mocked.|`|QC94lBXOaa	Love is a biological response, so yes.|`|i6QfwNTJaa	and we are all space mokeys, right?  i feel like i shouldnt be nice to u cuz of what u r saying, but i will be nice because now it is my time to answer u.  1 even in the animal kingdom we have social species of animals. if u ever watch a documentary u would also know that some are very close knit group. if one like the other they try to do anything in their power to get the affection that they are seeking. or, if one member of the group dies they mourn. so, are u telling me there is a differnce in our emotions than that of animals. if god gave us the gift of love he sure gave it to the animals too. and just because u r a christian does not mean that u are the only ones that can make a romantic love work,  that's not how it goes! and u know it too. we ALL love to have that special someone in our lives. this is archived by personally getting into the courting ritual. u christians do that too. everyone does no matter what religion u are! that's just the way nature wired us. if u are asking for success rate, then u should know that u cannot cast the first stone on behalf of believers, cuz u and the rest of us, are all guilty of having failed a couple of time before we got it right.  every person is capable for romantic love, because that is an emotion we all were born with and not given too. hey i am an atheist. i just celebrated my anniversary. 11yrs. are u telling i am not capable to love? u cant anymore. if god gave love to mankind as a "gift" then why are we born with it? why not yank it away from us since we dont believe? and make us suffer more until we turn to him? wouldnt that be effective to get more ppl to turn to his ways? oh, ok i get it. "he works in mysterious ways", am i right?  whatever, i cant believe i answered this question.|`|wwdllMzYaa	yes  "romancit love" is nothing more than biology, if you understand some basic biology, then you understand love  jsut because we dont believ ein a god doesnt mean we dont love     i have never beleived humans are "just atoms and nothing more"  i  you have some strange ideas about atheists  its not all about sin and sex, despite what you may hve been told by your religion and any followers|`|MUcINsQ3aa	love is a chemical reaction to a certain stimuli, so yes, we are capable|`|8ab6993234808864c73a8260c98e510aaa	you are assuming that atheists are also immoral, antisocial, and without emotion... and that's not true...|`|SnqZcQIgaa	I find it scary just how little humanity Christians seem to have when they believe that all emotions and morality come from god alone.|`|z8O3HxZaaa	that is utterly absurd    of course they can :@|`|i48kxrbaaa	of course they are capable of loving, even I know that and i am not Atheist.|`|nrnVqh7iaa	You sad sacks need religion to tell you what to think and feel because you came from parents of low IQ...

All human beings have to capacity to love unless there is some sort of brain damage going on. Just because some one doesn't believe the same thing as you doesn't make them non-human. Get a grip!|`|3GAiVmEAaa	Atheists do not believe in God. They can still believe in our humanity, some still even believe in an afterlife.    I am agnostic and I am engaged to an atheist. Of course we love each other. We just fit together, we enjoy our time together and want to spend our lives together. WHat does a belief in God have to do with it?|`|x3rqmwrNaa	The short answer is yes, Atheists and Christians alike are able to enjoy love, as are Muslims, Jews, Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Agnostics and people of any or no faith. After all, We're all made of the same stuff regardless of what we believe in. We're all affected by nature and have our natural instincts. Love is a trick played upon us by nature to get us to reproduce.|`|bxYWJAYNaa	Yes, you are right. Atheists are very much like robots, full of wires and circuits and without any feeling.   They don't feel love or any other real emotions like you and I do.|`|a7364c50b7e6712ee3c77218a3232b45aa	Well gimme a solid man any day over a wraith of "God".    I don't presume to speak for all atheists but live by laws of nature and according to social mores. Do Christians like you in their smug little bubble not think animals and people not in your in-crowd can show love, affection and loyalty to each other (and to us)?  Why DO so many Christians have such literal interpretations of facts and limited understanding of the world?    If things were that simplistic then the atheists would be the ones up in court for stealing, rape and incest and yet the media tell us daily of upright members of the Christian community abusing their supposed elevated level in society - what's God say about that?|`|lOzbR6tvaa	A more pertinent question is why are you unable to activate the rational mind that natural selection created for our species.     Is the mental virus of religion so encumbering you are unable to recover from it?|`|laSYIzULaa	Of course they can love. Love is not about god. It is about a feeling of how much you care about that person. Just because you do not believe in god does not mean you are incapable of god. At least atheists love the person without needing to love god first. The love atheists feel is far more incredible than what you would call love because they do not put god first.     Atheists enjoy romantic love more than Christians. But don't worry your pretty little head about it. You keep believing in what you believe, but please don't make assumptions about other people's love, its just ignorant.
46fouwFfaa	Yes, I think that since we have the privilege of being educated in Western, prosperous countries we should use whatever knowledge we've gained and try to help our countries. I do want to go back and help Somalia but I do find it difficult to believe that as one person, I can make a change. Even if I do make some change, I do think that there will be some people who will want to take me out but we can't just sit around and wait for it to change on its own. Besides, we might inspire other Africans to do the same.|`|eqaUMrYZaa	I do not think you and your friends will change much , you might be able to help a few people.I would think you and your friends trying to change the corruption in Africa , would fall on deaf ears and likely cause harm to you and your friends.I would think you do not want to mess with those in Africa with power .<br>  <br>  You will need more than you and your friends , tho it is a start.|`|9n4MpLwvaa	It certainly wouldn't hurt.

orRJdm0maa	Sit at a table with you and at least one other person - put a glass in the middle of the table upside down and place one finger on the glass. Then ask if there is anybody in this room.

Noises or shadows or a feeling like someone is watching you.  The best way to tell if a home is haunted is to get an expert, a medium who can connect with the dead. Many will come to your home and connect with the spirit and then pass them over to the Other side.  A medium has gifts that allow her or him to see and hear earthbound spirits. They can in many cases get them to follow the light home and to leave the spot they are dwelling.    Or, I you wish to attempt a Spiritual Blessing yourself you can try that. There are many types but I like the Native American blessings. You can get information on the internet on just how to do it. I did one before using tobacco and it worked for removing negative imprints on a home.    Also, talk out loud and ask the spirts to leave. Tell them they are not welcome in your home. Your spirit guide will assist you in this matter.|`|7f1w30PXaa	my aunts house is haunted here's how I know    1 lights go on for no reason and the switch to turn them on and off are untouched    2 one day she left the empty house to go across the street to the bank when she went to open the do her laundry basket was blocking the door and it was up right so it wasn't the dog plus it was in her room in the very far corner     3 the dogs barks into nothingness for no reason out of no where
cd2etz5Raa	God created Eve to be "a helper suitable for him." (Genesis 2:18 NIV)  By helper, He meant someone to help Adam spiritually and emotionally. Let's face it ...

They resemble angels in universality of worship, extensiveness of supervision, comprehensiveness of knowledge, and in being heralds of Divine dominicality. However, man is more comprehensive in his worship, but since he has an appetitive soul that is disposed towards evil, contrary to the angels, he is subject to progress and decline, which is of great importance. Also, since in his work man seeks pleasure for his soul and a share for himself, he resembles an animal. Since this is so, man receives two wages: the first is insignificant, animal, and immediate; the second, angelic, universal, and postponed.|`|3YduZ8Q1aa	Darwin-Darwin-Darwin!  read again!|`|6106bf75a443c7ad47b50d9b2b1cadc6aa	I have past the age for beleiving in Fairy tales.|`|oSME7B23aa	This question is awesome.

He told me it was against policy, and that if the company did that then they would have to sponsor everyone in any activity they wanted, just to be fair.  That would open the door to donations for Little League, Girl Scouts, charity walks, and all sorts of stuff.<br>  <br>  Later they had a United Way campaign and everybody contributed.<br>  <br>  I wasn't offended because I understood the point, and I'm always glad when someone supports a charity, even if it wasn't my first pick.<br>  <br>  Now, it would have been *smarter* for your manager to come to you and flatter you into doing a bunch of work for the fundraiser.|`|mmeVN3zKaa	Extremely rude.

Indeed many workplaces have rules in place prohibiting employees seeking donation or soliciting other employees at the workplace.   In many instances that can be considered unprofessional.<br>  <br>  It is not your workplaces place or responsibility to support your own personal fundraiser activities.<br>  <br>  However, many companies do partake in their own philanthropic endeavors.   These are Absolutely corporately sponsored, they generally raise a pile of money and are treated as a team building exercise.

It only matters if that's how you feel.  If you're feeling some guilt or punishment for teasing Caesar, then it's karma.  If you have no remorse and see it as coincidence, the result of your lifestyle, or some health issue that is causing the weight gain, then it is not karma.<br>  <br>  Here, you will find the idea of karma in Theravada Buddhism:<br>  <a href="http://www.thebigview.com/buddhism" rel="nofollow">http://www.thebigview.com/buddhism</a>|`|cwfAJ6utaa	Maybe.

But then again it could be your metabolism slowing down due to stress.|`|yOK32PM9aa	I'm not sure about other religions, much less about vague new-age sentiments, but the Buddha saw Karma purely as intentional action.  So yes, if you intended to say something, there is an instance of Karma.  This intentional action is only one of many causal factors in the world.  So your weight gain could have been caused by what you said (but for the life of me I don't see how!), or your feelings of guilt could have been exacerbated by your memory of what you said (more plausible).  But it is likely that both are the result of other factors, none of them attributable to human intention.|`|A01w1dHqaa	Consequences return until we learn...that's the only reason we are here.

Either those characteristics don't matter to you, or they don't. You can't have it both ways.|`|FNk35vR6aa	It's true, it is kind of odd. I understand slightly though, throughout history we have been dominated by upper class white males and to let them have yet another advantage (a group) seems kind of bizarre, even though it shouldn't because, if you are going to make a bunch of minority groups couldn't white males be considered a minority now a days? I'm sure you could find a business group out there that doesn't have any preferences (open to everyone regardless of race/gender etc) I'm surprised you were answered with such malice!

Since Jesus said "I am the ONLY way to approach the Father," then either he was lying in which case only hinduism is true, or he was telling the truth, in which case hinduism is a lie.    There's a really great test that Jesus gave to determine if his teachings were from God or not (implying the existence of said God).    He said that if you REALLY want to know, then "OBEY  THESE  COMMANDS, and you SHALL know!"  (I believe he was referring to the Sermon on the Mount, starting in the 5th chapter of the gospel according to Matthew.)    If that isn't enough, God (the same God that Jesus was talking about) said, "If you seek for me, then you'll find me, if you search for me with all your heart (with an honest and humble heart), and I WILL be found of you, says the Lord."    So, if that isn't enough, then nothing will be enough.  And if a person says that God is NOT real (that Jesus was a liar), but refuses to put him to the test, then that person is a hypocrite, and the only reason he doesn't believe in God is because he doesn't WANT to believe in God!    Which is MORE true?  Only one of them is true, and the other is false.  But if you aren't willing to look Jesus in the face and stand toe-to-toe with him (so to speak), and take his challenge, then you have no right to say anything at all about the matter!|`|TgU9P6pdaa	Tooth fairy or santa clause, which is likely to be more true?|`|WhUV9k6Jaa	Both are true, but neither encompass the whole of truth.

I know a young couple who got divorced and had a child. The wife  waited until it was completely final and moved back.

vmn8hsb8aa	Capes are fairly easily found at costumes stores or by various manufacturers online. Try checking shops that may be linked to renaissance faire websites, or just do a search for renaissance or medieval garb. If you're in the New England area, I can recommend the sites of 2 friends, www.threadsoftime.com or www.woolycat.net. Both make good quality garb, including cloaks/capes.  As to the handfasting ceremony, your friend may be looking to have you help "call the quarters". This means that you will be one of 4 people set at intervals around the ceremonial circle, North, South, East, and West, who calls on the spiritual elements of Earth, Air, Fire or Water to attend, watch over and protect the ceremony and the circle where the ceremony takes place. You might also be one of the people who calls the God or Goddess to be present. There are other aspects that can be added to a handfasting as well, but these are some of the most basic.   Depending on who performs the service and which version of the handfasting ceremony is used, it can be a truly moving experience for anyone, just like any other religious ceremony. It all really comes down to the ability of the officiant. Hope this helped and that you have an enjoyable experience attending your friend's handfasting.|`|495e344229dc3bcc5dcbf3cd52fed97eaa	Every handfasting is very different and individualized, but you can see quite a few of them on YouTube. Just ask your friend what she wants you to do.    Smart-assed answers not withstanding, if you go to your local fabric store and look at Halloween costume patterns you can find some very good ones for capes from both Simplicity and McCall's, and because they're not seasonal right now you might even find them in the discount bin. As another person said, capes are not especially traditional for Wiccan handfastings, but are probably just the preference of the couple-to-be.    Congrats to them!|`|246ef99fe9f19ae4da709934694ddcd8aa	I have been to several handfastings and I do not recall the participants needing capes. I could be wrong, but I believe that it is just your friends preference on how she want the event to look.    Swords or knives and staves (staffs or brooms) have been a common theme in several I have gone to.    It will probably be outdoors and there may be a "jumping the broom" ritual or dancing so wear comfortable shoes.    ADD: The handfasting is a life/lovebonding ritual. Meet her partner and learn something interesting about him. Talk to your friend and tell her you approve of the bond then mention the interesting tidbit you learned from him as proof that you actually talked to him and approve.    Since handfastings are often for a set amount of time, tell them that you are confident they will be happy and continue to renew their vows in the future.|`|wwdllMzYaa	read your bio, very interesting,     just wanted to say that  i dont know anything about capes and details of a handfasting except the important ones, ie the marriage itself (despite myself wanting to have one in the future ;-D   )    hope you find some answers|`|mNyhRGowaa	Type in search bar halloween stores they probably have capes on sale right now.

But that would be awesome, if they ever did exist.|`|stAeoUeSaa	Azazel was one of the 200 watchers (or Igigi) sent to Mount Hermon (also called Sion), that fell madly in lust for fair human women in the days of Jared. This is told of in Genesis 6:2-9; the books of Enoch; the book of Jasher; and the book of Jubilees. Enoch says they appeared almost like 'white men' of various size. Their offspring were the Nephilim (Titans or giants). Azazel mainly but also with his friends taught their new wives and enormous offspring sorcery, astrology, weather, and lots of very highly classified information from Heaven (like merkabahs, mind control spells,etc). Think of it a minute. A pure antediluvian race from Adam living up to 300-900 years old each(Genesis 5) just learning how their world around them worked, but on top of that the watchers gave their Titanic children enough technology and power to control the entire original supercontinent called Pangaea. In fact, they did. This combination had in almost no time created a Golden Age (for the Aristocrats and a nightmare for the lower class) - a mixture of technology and spirituality this planet hasn't seen again to this day. They built the crystal skulls, Stonehenge, and all the pyramids from South America through Bosnia to China. The watchers were punished immediately as told of in 2 Peter 2:4, Jude 6, and the books of Enoch. The devouring Nephilims and others were destroyed later in the Great Flood where they tried to climb mountains and hover over the water until the merkabahs (actually a bit less glorious version called a Vimana) eventually crashed into the sea. <br>  <br>  But it was said some found safe refuge in a secret place of the Earth. This is how some of the giant line still survived down to men like the sons of Anak (Annunaki), the Rephaim, Zuzummim, Goliath from Gath, and King Og of Bashan not to mention some of the technology that wasn't lost for good (supposely) until tyrant King Nimrod (Sargon or Enmerkar) rebelled with his Tower of Babel in Eridu. It was going to be so high he boasted no flood would ever reach him and their heavenly wonder-toys again. Needless to say, God destroyed the Tower, confused all speech, divided Pangea, and scattered all the people in the time of Peleg whose name meant "divided". So bye! bye! Atlantis, Lemuria, Mu, and Ultima Thule (Hyperborea). <br>  <br>  Now a few millennia later come the Nazis with their "knowledge"of their white Aryan ancestry. Using the occult black arts to conjure demons, their father satan, and using the gorgeous but evil withces of the Vril Society as mediums to contact the imprisoned watchers to find out where the antediluvian technology was hidden... Tibet? Tunnels in the Andes?? Bolivia??? Even a strange void in Anarctica?!?! So the Nazis built Base 211 down there. America had Admiral Byrd fly to the North Pole and sure enough he found Job's 'empty place' in the North (Job 26:7) and their own stash of antediluvian goods. <br>  <br>  The Germans engineered the Nazi Bell prototype, then a real vimana- the Haunebu model, followed by another- the Vril model. They were seen during WW2 and were called foo fighters or wonderweapons. At the end of the war, America formed Operation Paperclip and tried to get as many of the German scientists and occultists before the Soviets could. They then sent Phil Schnieder and the boys behind the 'green door' to dig up the watchers from gloomy Tartarus just like the prophet foresaw (Amos 9:2) followed by digging DUMBs (deep underground military bases) to carry on experiments with the rediscovered hightech artifacts with watcher help of course. After being toasted, they now appear as tall grays, short grays, and orangish grays that all wreak of sulfur! They have retroengineered all kinds of unimaginable weapons using the antediluvian HAARP technology, Tesla rays, zero point energy, and the latest vimana called the TR-3B that uses mercury plasma magnetic vortex propusion just like the vimanas used in the great massacre of the Negroid Harappan and Mohjen-Daro people (of the sons of Joktan and Raamah or Lord Rama) of the early Indus river civilization by the Aryans told of in the Rig Veda. The same Vedas that J.Oppenheimer quoted Shiva as saying, "I am become death." More specific details of vimana schematics can be found in the Vaimanika Shastra. <br>  <br>  America built Thule Air Base right on top of the ruins of Thule and Ultima Thule. The Illuminati are waiting anytime between now and July(ever wonder why Bill Clinton's favorite movie was Independence Day?) to do a pretend fallen 'alien' invasion with holographic augmentation to bring in the New World Order and the so called 'Noahdic' one world religion as told of in 2 Thessalonians 2:9-12. Only Jesus can save you off this prison planet now, and only He can if you are saved, repented, and never taken the implant(Verichip/Xmark), electronic tattoo(Somark), nor any 'Mark' told of in Revelation 13:16-18.

HbQmDGb6aa	In my opinion, the kind of sneezes that sound like they have a shout of "AH-CHOO!" behind them are rude. These sneezes make me jump, and also sounds like the person adds in the near-yell behind it. I can sneeze both loud and quietly, and if I'm ever around people I ALWAYS make myself sneeze quietly. I had to consciously teach myself how to be quiet sneezing, so I feel like it's a learned- not impossible - behavior. There are exceptions to every rule, but I do feel that if a person has a very loud sneeze, he or she should make an effort to learn how to tone down the volume a bit. It disturbs everyone around them, whether or not it's intentional.|`|l8yfpyy1aa	If you're sneezing, have a bandanna or a cloth handkerchief with you all the time, and use it to cover your nose and mouth.  A clean tissue is OK too, so long as you throw it away right afterward.  Never just sneeze into your hand or your sleeve.  And it's good hygiene to wash your hands frequently, especially after using a handkerchief or a Kleenex.  <br>  <br>  At any rate, all of us respectfully request that you stay at home with your contagious, disgusting cold unless it's a matter of life or death.|`|RoqxGbgRaa	yes.|`|4a2eee5eefa1d6701c73d4bd94101010aa	Just sneeze and let your body decide how loud you need to be (cover your mouth so you don't spray germs over everyone).  If you try to suppress your sneeze by making it not so loud, you run the risk of damaging your ear drum (I know a guy who actually did this) (something about the pressure from withholding backs up into your ears).  So, let it blow.|`|YupMCYHlaa	No.  Some people can't help sneezing loud.  I am a loud sneezer, I always was.  It scares our cats.  My sweetie sneezes like a cat, just a little (-chu!-).  Neither of us has any control over how we sneeze.<br>  <br>  But it is rude not to turn your head or cover your face and nose.  And it's polite to say 'Oh, excuse me!' afterwards.|`|AA11828439	No, you cannot control the volume of a sneeze. Trying to suppress a sneeze can be harmful.|`|gW0nD5cEaa	You can't always control the noise or force of a sneeze, and believe me, I have allergies and sinus problems. Be sure you try and face away from people and cover your mouth and nose, preferably with a kleenex. If you are having sinus problems or think you will be near something you are allergic to, be sure to have kleenexes, handkerchiefs or something. And wash your hands as soon as you can and maybe carry some sanitizer.<br>  <br>  It is rude if you try and make it as loud as you can and don't cover it, but usually it just happens.|`|rThIVk2maa	It's a bit rude, yes. Everybody has different sneeze types, but the really LOUD ones are generally doing it to get attention. If your sneezes are that loud, get yourself a handkerchief and cover your mouth and nose to muffle the sound. <br>  <br>  No need to startle everybody around you because you think it's funny or that you can't help it. There are a lot of body noises that are involuntary, but that doesn't mean that people should flaunt them. We can actually exercise some control over our bodies.|`|pl96lkzIaa	You should try to sneeze quietly if you can, but it's not really something you can control.  Some people are just loud sneezers and that's fine.  Just make sure you cover your nose and mouth, turn your head away from other people, and say excuse me.|`|OXljAxooaa	Wounded Duck above is correct, trying to suppress a sneeze can rupture your sinuses and cause injury.  <br>  <br>  Sneezing is a natural, involuntary human response.  You're allowed to be a human.|`|AA11637099	When someone sneezes, it's an accident and a polite person excuses it. If a person is amplifying their sneezes to be rude, they risk injury to their nose or throat.|`|b87482cd8013bcfad52b6cff60829a6eaa	only rude of you dont cover your face. I mean of your are blowing germs and who knows what everywhere then yes thats rude. but to sneeze in the appropriate manner and be loud...nope its fine.|`|DZCFD0p2aa	yes...it's annoying. Anyone who "can't control" the volume of their sneezes can't do so because they weren't trained properly as a child.

We can still do what we want, but we'd have to risk getting criticized, or even sometimes, getting more attention.|`|8KxurcApaa	Women are not treated equally nor should they be treated equally ... because men & women are not equal.<br>  <br>  Women get paid less for the same work - that is wrong & focus should be put there so that women are respected just as much as a man is.  But feminist, being equal to a man doesn't mean getting all the good stuff and being a lady to avoid the bad stuff.<br>  <br>  And the double standard is atrocious.  If you truely want to be equal that means accepting the consequence men have to faces as well as accepting the rewards we have access to.  By consequences I mean that if a smart mouth girl talks smack about my Mama ... I should be able to slap her down just like I do any guy in the same situation.  It means if you want the house to have YOUR last name & not mine ... then when some fool runs up in the house ... you get the gun & confront them while I go back to sleep.<br>  <br>  [Edit: Paying a women less because she might have a child isn't proper justification in my eyes, having a higher insurance premium withheld from her check is.  Men are now receiving maternity leave (which I think is kinda stupid) as well nowadays so that's a wash.  As for women taking the job seriously, some women are more serious about their career path than men thus I don't think that should be justification of her receiving less pay (unless she's getting paid less because her performance warrants it).  That said, I have to disagree with the points you made in your clarification concerning equal pay]

Νικ?λαο? , Agios Nikolaos, "victory of the people") (270 - 6 December 346) is the common name for Nicholas of Myra, a saint and Bishop of Myra (in Lycia, part of modern-day Turkey). Because of the many miracles attributed to his intercession, he is also known as Nicholas the Wonderworker. He had a reputation for secret gift-giving, such as putting coins in the shoes of those who left them out for him, and thus became the model for Santa Claus, whose English name comes from the German Sankt Niklaus. His reputation evolved among the faithful, as is common for early Christian saints.[2] In 1087, his relics were furtively translated to Bari, in southern Italy; for this reason, he is also known as Nicholas of Bari.<br>  <br>  The historical Saint Nicholas is remembered and revered among Catholic and Orthodox Christians. He is also honoured by various Anglican and Lutheran churches. Saint Nicholas is the patron saint of sailors, merchants, archers, and children, and students in Greece, Belgium, Romania, Bulgaria, Georgia, Russia, the Republic of Macedonia, Slovakia, Serbia and Montenegro. He is also the patron saint of Barranquilla, Bari, Amsterdam, Beit Jala, and Liverpool. In 1809, the New-York Historical Society convened and retroactively named Sancte Claus the patron saint of Nieuw Amsterdam, the Dutch name for New York City.[3] He was also a patron of the Varangian Guard of the Byzantine emperors, who protected his relics in Bari.<br>   santa|`|p4kbPcOjaa	I think my 8 year old figured it out this past Christmas (I wasn't as sneaky as I thought I was!)

iCqfmRC3aa	1. If you were in a federally enforced national park or national forest, it was perfectly legal.  There is not a federal law against nudity.  Be careful though since some federal lands are actually enforced by state agencies and they all have anti-nudity ordinances.<br>  <br>  2. The human body can not be naughty, but people can act naughty. If you were not doing anything wrong, then it wasn't naughty.<br>  <br>  3. 74% of Americans agree nude recreation is ok in appropriate settings (see source below)<br>  <br>  4. 40 million Americans admit to having skinny-dipped with the opposite sex.<br>  <br>  5. Nude recreation is a $450 Million industry now.<br>  <br>  6. There are more then 6 Official Clothing Optional Beaches that are run by the Federal Government or State Park Agencies in the US<br>  <br>  7. Nudity has come out of the closet and is very mainstream now.<br>  <br>  It is common courtesy to cover yourself when clothed people are approaching unless you are in an officially sanctioned nude or clothing optional area.  While we may have the right to be nude, we should never cause others discomfort because of our nudity.  If your gf says she felt "naughty" you should find out if that was a fun naughty or an uncomfortable one, if the later, you should not do it again with her.<br>  <br>  But, by all means, continue to enjoy yourself with or without others, it just feels great.<br>  <br>  Come on in, the water's fine.|`|T0gv52CDaa	The knowledge that you could get caught (even though the odds of it are very slim) makes it just naughty enough to be exciting.

Of course, it was at night and there was no moon out so it was really dark.

UxSF3Doaaa	On several sheets of paper, write or type on it: Seek Ye Heavenly Treasures FIRST! Tape these in every room of your house in plain sight, and on your front and back door ( garage door, too, if you have one) to remind yourself to think in terms of godly stuff instead of worldly stuff.<br>  <br>  2. Be more concerned about what it right instead of what is popular. What is popular is more often than not tends to be immoral stuff in the eyes of the Lord. So doing the unpopular thing in the eyes of society is essential to gain favor from the Lord.  And be willing to speak up about your faith. There is a way to do it without it pushing your thoughts onto others. <br>  <br>  3. It is ok to have friends with people who do not believe in a higher power or people who's belief in a higher power is different. However, only make friends with people who will not affect your walk with God and who will respect your sense of morals.<br>  <br>  4. Don't watch most of the stuff on tv. Seriously!<br>  <br>  5. Constantly seek guidance on stuff. Be in habit of praying before doing something.<br>  <br>  6. Read the Bible every day, or as close to every day as possible.<br>  <br>  7. If someone talks to you about God and Bible thump, but you feel uneasy about what is being said, pray for help to see if what is being said is legit or not. <br>  <br>  8. Just let God be in control of your life instead of you in control of your own.<br>  <br>  Blessings to you, and the peace of God the Father and Jesus be with you!|`|FmbwIbtzaa	As religion becomes institutionalized, its power for good is curtailed, while the possibilities for evil are greatly multiplied. The dangers of formalized religion are: fixation of beliefs and crystallization of sentiments; accumulation of vested interests with increase of secularization; tendency to standardize and fossilize truth; diversion of religion from the service of God to the service of the church; inclination of leaders to become administrators instead of ministers; tendency to form sects and competitive divisions; establishment of oppressive ecclesiastical authority; creation of the aristocratic "chosen-people" attitude; fostering of false and exaggerated ideas of sacredness; the routinizing of religion and the petrification of worship; tendency to venerate the past while ignoring present demands; failure to make up-to-date interpretations of religion; entanglement with functions of secular institutions; it creates the evil discrimination of religious castes; it becomes an intolerant judge of orthodoxy; it fails to hold the interest of adventurous youth and gradually loses the saving message of the gospel of eternal salvation.<br>  <br>  When our house is clean we can start with others.|`|ibAJ0YiMaa	Read Ephesians 6:10 "Be strong in the Lord and in his mighty power.

FHMItCgvaa	There are two main ways that the Europeans moved across the ocean to the Americas (I am including Russians in this as well)    1. The Nordic folk and vikings sailed across the ocean. Many of these trips took place after the original trips made by the Russians.    2. The second way was by walking across an ice bridge in the baring straites. This bridge spans from the eastern most side of Russia to the western most side of Alaska. This bridge still exists today but it is against international law to enter either Russia or the U.S. by walking it.    A third possibiltiy is that the fabled Atlantians were able to help as well.

KqiiT1WSaa	Every religion has sects.<br>  <br>  The difference with Islam, is that the prophet Muhammed (saw) informed us that there would be sects.<br>  <br>  Islam is a religion which is true and sincere. The prophet (saw) said "Adeenun naseeha" which means, "The religion is (sincere) advise" and so the prophet (saw) advised us with a sincere advise about what will occur, why it will occur, what will happen, and how to resolve the situation.<br>  <br>  So I will discuss the issue of the sects, the prophet (Saw) said that there will be 73 sects ALL to the hell fire EXCEPT ONE.......... <br>  <br>  Now tell me who would say about their own people that they would be in the hell fire? If you want people to simply support you, you would promise them ALL heaven, wouldn't you? But of course REMEMBER the prophets words "Adeenun Naseeha" So he advices us with a sincere advise.<br>  <br>  The prophet once he informed his companions that there will be one sect/group which is saved, they were quick in asking, Which is the saved group?<br>  <br>  To which the prophet (saw) replied: “It is the one to which I and my companions belong”<br>  <br>  So from the above hadith we can find that we must follow the prophet's (saw) in every action and how do we know what  the actions of the prophet (saw) are?. Of course it is by studying the Quran and the Sunnah - example of the prophet (saw) - which is known through his companions. <br>  <br>  So this is the sincere advise.

Never embrace a doctrine when evidence stands against it, nor should one follow a principle without evidence. <br>  <br>  If God wants a person to believe in a principle, He should make it clear and evident. He is the Most Fair and Just. He knows that belief is not a voluntary thing; that is, it is not up to the individual. A person is not able to believe or disbelieve anything he chooses. The human body is at one's command but not the mind. <br>  <br>  "And follow not that of which thou hast no knowledge. Surely the hearing and sight and the heart, all of these will be asked about it." 17:36 <br>  <br>  <br>  2. Never accept popularity at face value. A religious researcher should not take the popularity of a religious doctrine in his society as an evidence of its truth.<br>  <br>  "And if thou obey most of the inhabitants of the earth, they will mislead thee far from the way of God: They follow naught but an opinion, and they do but guess." 6:116 <br>  <br>  <br>  3. Inherited religious principles should be examined. Islam advises every adult to examine the religion which he inherited. Inherited religion, like any other religion, is subject to proof. <br>  <br>  "And we have enjoined on man concerning parents.... saying: 'Give thanks to Me and to thy parents. To Me is the eventual coming. And if they strive with thee to make thee associate with Me that of which thou hast no knowledge, obey them not, and keep kindly company with them in this world. ' " 31:14-15 <br>  <br>  <br>  4. Doubters are not excused. <br>   When a person is not committed to any religion and doubts the whole religious concept, he should not be satisfied with his doubt. It is his duty to protect himself and his vital interests in this world from any harm and damage. Similarly, he has the same responsibility and duty in protecting his spiritual interest from being damaged.<br>  <br>  "God does not impose on a soul a duty but to the extent of its ability." 2:286 <br>  <br>  <br>  5. When you conduct a religious research, let no one make decisions for you. Do not rely on the judgement of any other person, even if he is sincere and highly intellectual. <br>  <br>  "And no bearer will bear other's burden .... " 35:18, 53:38 <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Thus, we can see from these five Qur'anic verses that Islam is not afraid of being questioned or analyzed. Only those who fear failure forbid free discussion of their religious principles and avoid examination by researchers. <br>  <br>  May God guide you to the right path.|`|JiaGiVexaa	Not every muslim is a true one. Lot's of bad things are happening falsely in the name of Islam, but it is just a political agenda, lust over power.

A muslim is the one that believes that there is no god but ALLAH, and that Mohamed is his messenger. The differences are superficial, but the core of Islam is followed by all.

Muslims Should be United<br>  <br>  <br>  It is a fact that Muslims today, are divided amongst themselves. The tragedy is that such divisions are not endorsed by Islam at all. Islam believes in fostering unity amongst its followers. <br>  <br>  The Glorious Qur’an says:<br>  <br>  "And hold fast,<br>  All together, by the rope<br>  Which Allah (stretches out for you), <br>  and be not divided among yourselves;"<br>                  [Al-Qur’an 3:103]<br>  <br>  Which is the rope of Allah that is being referred to in this verse? It is the Glorious Qur’an. The Glorious Qur’an is the rope of Allah which all Muslims should hold fast together. There is double emphasis in this verse. Besides saying ‘hold fast all together’ it also says, ‘be not divided’.<br>  <br>  Qur’an further says,<br>  <br>  "Obey Allah, and obey the Messenger"<br>                  [Al-Qur’an 4:59]<br>  <br>  All the Muslim should follow the Qur’an and authentic Ahadith and be not divided among themselves. <br>  <br>  <br>  2.   It is Prohibited to make sects and divisions in Islam<br>  <br>  <br>  The Glorious Qur’an says: <br>  <br>  "As for those who divide<br>  Their religion and break up<br>  Into sects, thou hast<br>  No part in them in the least:<br>  Their affair is with Allah:<br>  He will in the end <br>  Tell them the truth<br>  Of all that they did."<br>             [Al-Qur’an 6:159]<br>  <br>  In this verse Allah (swt) says that one should disassociate oneself from those who divide their religion and break it up into sects.<br>  <br>  But when one asks a Muslim, "who are you?", the common answer is either ‘I am a Sunni, or ‘I am a Shia’. Some call themselves Hanafi, or Shafi or Maliki or Humbali. Some say ‘I am a Deobandi’, while some others say ‘I am a Barelvi’. <br>  <br>  <br>  3.   Our Prophet was a Muslim<br>  <br>  <br>  One may ask such Muslims, "Who was our beloved prophet (pbuh)? Was he a Hanafi or a Shafi, or a Humbali or a Maliki?" No! He was a Muslim, like all the other prophets and messengers of Allah before him. <br>  <br>  It is mentioned in chapter 3 verse 52 of Al-Qur’an that Jesus (pbuh) was a Muslim. <br>  <br>  Further, in chapter 3 verse 67, Al-Qur’an says that Ibrahim (pbuh) was not a Jew or a Christian but was a Muslim.<br>  <br>  <br>  4.   Qur’an says call yourselves Muslim<br>  <br>  <br>  If anyone poses a Muslim the question who are you, he should say "I am a MUSLIM, not a Hanafi or a Shafi". Surah Fussilat chapter 41 verse 33 says<br>  "Who is better in speech<br>  Than one who calls (men)<br>  To Allah, works righteousness,<br>  And says, ‘I am of those<br>  Who bow in Islam (Muslim)?’ "<br>                 [Al-Qur’an 41:33]<br>  <br>  The Qur’an says "Say I am of those who bow in Islam". In other words, say, "I am a Muslim".<br>  <br>  The Prophet (pbuh) dictated letters to non-Muslim kings and rulers inviting them to accept Islam. In these letters he mentioned the verse of the Qur’an from Surah Ali Imran chapter 3 verse 64:<br>  Say ye: "Bear witness<br>  That we (at least)<br>  Are Muslims (bowing<br>  To Allah’s Will)."<br>                  [Al-Qur’an 3:64]<br>  <br>  <br>  5.   Respect all the Great Scholars of Islam<br>  <br>  <br>  We must respect all the great scholars of Islam, including the four Imaams, Imam Abu Hanifa, Imam Shafi, Imam Humbal and Imam Malik (may Allah be pleased with them all). They were great scholars and may Allah reward them for their research and hardwork. One can have no objection if someone agrees with the views and research of Imam Abu Hanifa or Imam Shafi, etc. But when posed a question, ‘who are you?’, the reply should only be ‘I am a Muslim’.<br>  <br>  Some may argue by quoting the hadith of our beloved Prophet from Sunan Abu Dawood Hadith No. 4579. In this hadith the prophet (pbuh) is reported to have said, "My community will be split up into seventy-three sects."<br>  <br>  This hadith reports that the prophet predicted the emergence of seventy-three sects. He did not say that Muslims should be active in dividing themselves into sects. The Glorious Qur’an commands us not to create sects. Those who follow the teachings of the Qur’an and Sahih Hadith, and do not create sects are the people who are on the true path. <br>  <br>  According to Tirmidhi Hadith No. 171, the prophet (pbuh) is reported to have said, "My Ummah will be fragmented into seventy-three sects, and all of them will be in Hell fire except one sect." The companions asked Allah’s messenger which group that would be. Where upon he replied, "It is the one to which I and my companions belong."<br>  <br>  The Glorious Qur’an mentions in several verses, "Obey Allah and obey His Messenger". A true Muslim should only follow the Glorious Qur’an and the Sahih Hadith. He can agree with the views of any scholar as long as they conform to the teachings of the Qur’an and Sahih Hadith. If such views go against the Word of Allah, or the Sunnah of His Prophet, then they carry no weight, regardless of how learned the scholar might be.<br>  <br>  If only all Muslims read the Qur’an with understanding and adhere to Sahih Hadith, Inshallah most of these differences would be solved and we could be one united Muslim Ummah|`|fN6eDrFKaa	islam do not have any sects<br>  And verily this (i.e. Allah’s commandments mentioned in the previous two verses 151 and 152) is my straight path, so follow it, and follow not (other) paths, for they will separate you from His path.

You will see their actions and disapprove of them.” Hudhayfah said, “Will there be any evil after that good?” He said, “Yes, there will be some people who will invite others to the doors of Hell, and whoever accepts their invitation to it will be thrown in it (by them).” Hudhayfah said, “O Messenger of Allaah, describe those people to us.” He said, “They will be from among us and speak our language (i.e., from among the Arabs).” Hudhayfah asked, “What do you command us to do at that point?” He said, “Adhere to the jamaa’ah (group) of the Muslims and their leader.” Hudhayfah asked, “What if there is no jamaa’ah and no leader?” He said, “Keep away from all those different sects, even if you have to bite (i.e. eat) the root of a tree, till you die while you are still in that state.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari and Muslim). <br>  “… And let those who oppose the Messenger’s commandment (i.e., his Sunnah) (among the sects) beware, lest some fitnah (disbelief, trials, afflictions, etc.) befall them or a painful torment be inflicted on them.” [al-Noor 24:63] <br>  Our Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) told us that these divisions would emerge; he warned us about them and commanded us to adhere to the jamaa’ah [main body] of the Muslims. He said: “The Jews and the Christians split into seventy-two sects, all of which are in Hell; this ummah [nation] will split into seventy-three sects, all of which will be in Hell apart from one.” They asked, “Which one is that, O Messenger of Allaah?” He said, “Those who follow the path which I and my Companions are on today.”  He said,  “A group of my ummah will remain following the truth and will prevail, and those who oppose them will not harm them, until the Day of Judgement begins.” <br>  <br>  visit:<br>  <a href="http://www.islam-qa.com/en/ref/6280/split" rel="nofollow">http://www.islam-qa.com/en/ref/6280/spli...</a>|`|xtLOisgqaa	Dear sister,<br>  <br>  Your confusion is logical. Let's keep it very simple and straight. Why not consider the sect that still prevails in the holy places of Islam's origin, i.e. Makkah and Madinah from Day-1. Of course, it is the Sunni one. Since the very beginning, all the Imams (leaders of the prayers) in these two holy places have ALWAYS been Sunnis. Even during the Hajj (Pilgrimage), the Shia Muslims are also bound to follow the Sunni leaders because the latter ones (Sunnis) are direct followers of the beloved companions of the Holy Prophet (Peace be upon him).<br>  <br>  I am not saying that Shias are non-Muslims. Don't get me wrong. Had this been the case, then there would have been an embargo on their entry to the holy land by the Saudi Government. Shia sect originated many years later after the sad demise of the Holy Prophet (Peace be upon him).<br>  <br>  Let's put this question like this..... if someone asks you as to who are the orthodox Christians, then of course your answer will be Catholic, simply because the Protestants were an invention of an era latter (King Henry VI). <br>  <br>  But still I would say that both the Sunni and Shia Muslims share the common fundamental beliefs of Islam, i.e. one God (Allah), last Prophet (Muhammad - Peace be upon him), the Holy Book (Qur'an), the Hell, the Paradise and the Judgement Day.<br>  <br>  My dear sister, I understand that God Has His Blessings on you and His Will for you is to go straight to the Paradise; that's why He has inclined your attention towards Islam - the true religion that has a lot of love and respect for Jesus (Peace be upon him) and also for all other Prophets / Messengers / Apostles of God.<br>  <br>  One last thing sister. Consider Jews; they don't believe Jesus (Peace be upon him) as the Messiah although Jesus (Peace be upon him) was INDEED and UNDOUBTEDLY the Messiah and being Muslims, we await his return to this world from the heavens. Similarly, Christians don't believe Muhammad (Peace be upon him) as the Last Prophet although he is INDEED and UNDOUBTEDLY the Last Prophet of God as indicated in the Holy Bible (the Book of God).<br>  <br>  Hope this helps sister and best wishes. Meet you in Paradise in'sha Allah as I am sure God Wants you to be a follower of the only true religion in the world.

They all basically follow the same principles, it's just that they may do small things the others don't. The Sunni and Shia aren't really fighting that much, it's all media hype believe me... The only real difference is that Shia believe Ali (ra) should have been the heir to the Islamic dynasty after Muhammad (sa) instead of Abu Bakar (ra), this has been the base for the entire division... and it is all political..<br>  The other sects are deviants...<br>  <br>  Sunni= Follow the Qur'an an the Prophets words = the straight path<br>  Shia= Almost Same thing, except for the political differences.<br>  <br>  <br>  We don't have Different Qur'an's for each Sect, the Qur'an is the same for all of them...

It seems to me you are looking for the 5 minute a day God, whom you can wave your hand at each day to earn your salvation, rather than work hard, search your soul to understand what is good and wholesome to please Him. <br>  <br>  From an Abrahamic monotheist point of view, these three scriptures OT, Gospel & Quran, each has been crafted in such a way that the three nations (Jews, Roman, Arab) will jealously guard every single word in them till the end of time. This is because, God has designed them in such a way, that separately, these texts form Orthodox religions followed by people in these nations that makes them feel special. As if God would rather glorify their tribal ambitions than himself. However, combined together these scriptures also provide  individuals an opportunity to discover a  compassionate God of all humanity,  rather than one who prefers one tribe over another (as worshipped by the Orthodoxy in the three nations).<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, this is not a prepackaged God that you can find at Walmart (or Orthodox Synagogue, Church or Masjid). I found him by first reading about the Ebionite Jews in early Christianity. Then  the Messianic expectations in Matt 24 & Isaiah 19. Then, history in the book Catastrophe by David Keys about what life was like in the days of Muhammad. Then comparing the expecations in the Bible with events described in the book Catastrophe. Then, imagining how the Jews & Christians must have  thought that only a true God could have foretold in the Bible, everything they had witnessed in their lives.  There could be other ways of finding him too. So I suggest, at the very least, do as natassia said, read the OT, Gospels & The Quran. Here are a couple of verses from the Quran to warm you up:<br>  <br>  <br>  [Saba' 34:31] And those who disbelieve say: We believe not in this Qur'an nor in that (Bible) which was before it; but oh, if thou couldst see, when the wrong-doers are brought up before their Lord, how they cast the blame one to another; how those who were despised (in the earth) say unto th ...<br>  <br>  [Al-Imran 3:199.8] And lo! of the People of the Scripture there are some who believe in Allah and that which is revealed unto you and that which was revealed unto them, humbling themselves before Allah. They purchase not a trifling gain at the price of the revelations of Allah. Verily their reward is with their Lord. Lo! Allah is swift to take account.

There are many terms that get turned into slang and most of the time they have nothing to do with the original words meaning. The term you first used is not a good one in any respect and for some reason the N word is only appropriate for black people to use and that's fine with me.

AA12158476	Brace yourself for sexual sensations you cannot compare to what you may do you to yourself in the privacy of your own home. You can find stimulation having someone else do you or watch. Indulge yourself sometime, you could like it.<br>  <br>  <br>  Edit: Whether gay or not, sometimes one may want to think "out side" the box. No one said curiousity made you a "slut."|`|SaQ5d420aa	If you are not gay, then you are abusing your partner.<br>  <br>  Either find someone for pay, or invest in a relationship with a man and see where it goes.  But just being curious about gratifying yourself with a man is not being gay.<br>  <br>  When I first came out, and before I knew better, I did find places to meet with men who just wanted a quickie.  I found out they were there because they thought it  was easy to get a BJ from a guy than from their wives.  I stopped that kind of hookup real fast.  I am gay, not a slut.

We usually head to upstate PA or NY for camping or Jersey, Maryland, the Carolinas, Virginia, or Florida to go to the beach|`|bb06GQ5Paa	America is such a diverse place that we really don't have to leave the country in order to experience a different climate or change of scenery.  But the Carribean is very popular.  Central and South America also.  Mexico, not so much maybe this year because of everything going on down there.|`|rJJhMQ37aa	I stay in America.  Ours is a huge country.  Lots of different places to see.  Many parts different from other parts.<br>  <br>  Let's see.  I have seen the Grand Canyon, Las Vegas, Hoover Dam,  Yellowstone, the Badlands, so many places!<br>  <br>  My favorite is the east coast, especially in autumn.  The trees are a blaze of color.  I toured Lizzie Borden's house (which my husband thought a waste of time, but I loved seeing that.) and we have seen some maritime villages, complete with people demonstrating the way people used to live.  Museums, and aquariums.  <br>  <br>  I've seen (and now understand the reason for) the village of Salem and the witch trials.  Plymouth Rock and Boston harbors.  Cape May and Cape Cod.  And I have toured the mansions that rich folk built as "summer homes".  Amazing places!  Palaces.<br>  <br>  Why should I go to other countries when my own is so rich with things to see and do?  The money spent on air fare goes a long way here, to travel the highways (and back roads).  Interesting places right here.|`|dgRTkccBaa	People in the US don't always go to warm weather destinations on vacation because most places in the US get warm summers.  For warm weather most people will go to Southern California, Mexico, the Caribbean, Florida, and Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic are also pretty popular spots.  <br>  Skiing is also popular here and many people head to Colorado or Utah during the fall and winter months.  Las Vegas is also a popular place to vacation year-round.|`|iN0cyZoTaa	I live in central California.  We usually go to Monterey, Pacific Grove, San Francisco and the like. Anything near the ocean.

rThIVk2maa	What you can do is actually go to their house (this is traditional). Bring a dish of food of course, they aren't wanting to cook right now. <br>  <br>  While you're there, give your hugs and say you're so terribly sorry for the loss. Offer your help with anything should they need it and do not expect them to want to talk. Offer to take any pets to your house if needed or mow the grass if they'll be out of town.<br>  <br>  They will talk when they want to, but sometimes talking only makes someone feel worse, so do avoid it unless they bring it up to spare their feelings.|`|12VQ4ETcaa	You should definitely call or send a card.  They might not be ready for much company yet.  If your husband and his cousin were close, go in person.<br>  <br>  The thing about tragedy is that people are sometimes too numb to grieve much right away, but by the time they're ready to talk about it, everybody else has moved on.  Sometimes people even avoid them because they don't know what to say.<br>  <br>  When you visit, it's good to tell a story about something nice the cousin did and why he was a good person.  You can put a good memory like that in a card, too.|`|EQKaMfPAaa	Sorry to hear about your families loss. I think in most cases it is customary to go over to the families house and bring a meal or plant and stay for a while.  At least in my family that has always been how it worked.  In some cases it is like different family members take turns being there for the grieving parents so they have support if they need it during the difficult time.  If you cannot stay it is still customary to take something and drop it off. Once again, sorry for your loss and I hope this helps in some way.|`|a402885910549caddf0eb474b891f438aa	Yes, you should go sit with them. If you don't, you will wish you did. If you have the money, stop and pick up something up or make something for to eat. They most likely wont be in the mood to cook but will need to eat.|`|DZzBfzVeaa	Dont bring food to a funeral! Usually that is frouned upon. Sit where ever there is an empy seat but make sure you talk to his parents before you leave and tell them if there is anything they need to not hesistate to call you guys. If you want to bring some type of gift usually large flowers and plants are brought to set around the casket you could do that. or get some pictures together of your husband and his cousin and make a small album and give it to the family or set it on a table near the casket so everyone can look at them.
motz4Y14aa	Exercise is the first step.<br>  <br>  Exercise make a person fit. More energy mean more work which equal to more money <br>  <br>  Exercise also make a person feel good about himself. <br>  <br>  Meditation also help<br>  <br>  Also helping others to focus on other humans rather that flaming their own little egos (ie getting them to join volunteering work)<br>  <br>  Get some help by befriending some one with similar taste like your. Brainstorming cannot be done alone.<br>  <br>  Did you know that you are extremely rare? Rare are people who do good. Keep up the good work!

They would appreciate any help you could give them and you could help teens go there.

He was losing control because 50% of the population died, including his wife. <br>  <br>  Constantine was an evil despot that on the back of the plague went of a killing campaign murdering anyone left who disagreed with him in his attempt at keeping control. He was the man who commissioned the bible, it is his invention. He was the man who ordered the libraries at Alexandria to be burnt setting mankind back millenia. <br>  <br>  Sorry but your wonderful religion that murdered its way up through Europe and across the world has nothing to brag about. Evil is as evil does in my opinion. Perhaps your wonderful religion would like to explain why they burnt my g.g.g.g.grandmother alive for being a healer.

Please help stamp it out in our lifetime.<br>  ?|`|FmazIF6Maa	No, you are mistaken.<br>  <br>  "White" magic and "Black" magic are misconceptions, terms that come from rumor and fiction. Real Witches do not believe magic is white or black. <br>  <br>  Magic is neutral, like electricity. It is simply an energy that exists in the universe that we have access to.  <br>  <br>  It can power your  home and keep you warm all winter, or it can electrocute you or someone else if you're not careful with it. <br>  <br>  Just like a hammer is neither good nor bad, but we can pick it up and build a house or we can bash someone's head in. People, and their intentions, can be good or bad. Magic is neither-- it is neutral. <br>  <br>  <br>  Most Witches do not share your concept of the Divine; that is your religious beliefs. Why would I consider those when they are not my religion and I do not believe them? <br>  <br>  That would be like asking you to live and think like a Buddhist or a Hindu. That would be silly-- if you believe in Jesus and the Bible you are a Christian. <br>  <br>  I do not believe in Jesus, the Bible or the Devil, heaven, hell or evil. These things are inconsequential to me and have nothing to do with my life. In my religion, the practice of magic is embraced and believed to be positive. That is what I follow. <br>  <br>  I have never seen your devil in 18 years of practicing magic, never had any negative results in my magic or my life. The devil is your pantheon, not mine. He is non-existant in my life.|`|SDDgbtQ4aa	Who is "you guys"?  You are mistaken here. This witch does not label magic with colors.  Magic is energy - energy has no color (or intention) of its own. The energy and intentions come from the person who is working the magic.   <br>  <br>  Think of it like fire.  Fire has no intent of its own.  We use fire to heat our homes and cook our food - good intentions.  An arsonist uses fire to burn down buildings - bad intentions.  The fire did not decide for itself how it would be used.<br>  <br>  Your Christian concepts apply "white" to good and "black" to bad.  However, as you should well know, the world is not simply all "black & white".  "Black" or "darkness" does not automatically equate to "evil".  Sometimes darkness is necessary.  A flower seed planted in the earth must begin its growth process in darkness, it must take root before it can break through the earth's surface and bloom in the light.<br>  <br>  You do not "know for a fact that the devil is behind magic."  You *believe* this.  You have no evidence to prove this belief.<br>  <br>  If you're going to use this "logic" that "the devil" tricks people into doing his bidding, then the same possibility applies to you. Your God could be "the devil" in disguise tricking you.  Also, Jesus performed magic - so you are saying that the devil was behind Jesus? <br>  <br>  But considering "the devil" doesn't exist, and was just made up to be used as a scare tactic to keep Christians in line, as well as a convenient scape-goat so that you don't need to take responsibility for your own actions, the argument is moot.<br>  <br>  I take responsibility for my own actions, thank you.<br>  <br>  And as others have already pointed out - you can measure cold, and your God did claim to create evil.<br>  <br>  The Saint - one cannot worship or idolize something they do not believe exists.  It's really that simple.  I do not believe the devil or demons exist.|`|2059629ba703ea51b813a449b0cb4431aa	Yes, something is definitely wrong here, and it's your lack of spelling ability and understanding of grammar.<br>  <br>  Oh, and your unbelievable superstitious credulousness. Let's not forget that.|`|IS7Xubkfaa	Oops! You gotta say: "My bad".  You stated: "And for the record God didnt creat evil,..."<br>  <br>  But according to the bible: Isaiah 45:7 (King James Version)<br>  <br>  I form the light, and create darkness: I make peace, and create evil: I the LORD do all these things.|`|lVAe2SLXaa	Our leaders are "prophets", yours are "wizards". My "prophets" do "miracles", your "wizards" do "magic". We worship "god", you "idolize Demons and Devils".<br>  <br>  That can and does go Both Ways.|`|4IVWMgp7aa	As a Christian, do you believe in the power of positive thinking?  If you do, try lighting a candle while thinking those same good thoughts.  There you go, you just performed a simple candle spell... now you're going to hell.|`|Fpi8im9taa	Many Pagans/Witches use magic to HEAL people. How in the heck is that "of the devil"?<br>  <br>  As if prayer is any different.|`|lOzbR6tvaa	Beam me up Scotty no signs of intelligent life here.|`|3FaosgzZaa	God made Satan. If he is all knowing why would he create the source of ALL evil. oh and FYI Magic does not exist|`|jN5SXl5Caa	I don't know for a fact gravity is made by the devil. So therefore i'm right because I said I know it's a fact. Even though I am not a physicist and have never studied gravity. <br>  <br>  Also just because you think all magic is evil doesn't mean it is. If I use magic to save a child from dieing in a fire is that evil. And if it is not evil and the devil made magic then isn't the devil good. And if the evil is good then god is evil so god and the devil are the same. See crazy logic can get you anywhere.|`|L6zpJkTxaa	I personal dont think magic comes from the devil it was practiced in shamanism and many other religious pre dating christianity many christmas traditions come from the old religious like mistletoe above the door it was believed then that it scared away bad spirits and daemons also im talking about ancient europe before magic was good or bad when is what a gate way to the ancient ancestors that sort of thing :)|`|5JEYrUuTaa	well, and for the record i,too, am christian, i think that youre on the right track but not all magic is bad e.g. card magic tricks, escape artists, and other stuff of the sort. magic is fake. its all an illusion, not some weapon used by the devil to steal your soul. and you can measure cold because even cold things have some thermal energy (just throwing that out there)|`|d9tCS7BPaa	You make a good point, and I totally agree. Not through blind judgement..but I have had bad experiences with magic and so have some of my former friends who have practiced it. Witchcraft does NOT come from nature spirits or wonderous ancient gods who promise you powers. Its garbage. That is all just a lure to seduce you into trusting evil entities control over your mind.<br>  <br>  btw; You may want to fix your spelling in the title.|`|MI9zXGEOaa	Really?! Whoa! That all sounds so amazing!!<br>  <br>  <br>  All I need to do is see a shred of evidence, and I'll be all set to start believing!!<br>  <br>  I mean, it would just be ridiculous to expect me to believe it without seeing any evidence whatsoever, wouldn't it?!<br>  <br>  But you just provide that evidence and I'll believe right away! Gee wizz!|`|baW9sSsLaa	If you "know for a fact that the devil is behind magic"--then you know nothing at all.

You don't want an answer, you want to discredit someone else's beliefs, which is rude. Christians are supposed to show their faith by their actions, by being kind and loving. How can you expect to spread love by attacking someone else's beliefs?|`|zP0U1lp9aa	When you talk of the devil's magic, do you mean like walking on water, turning water into wine and parting the Red Sea?  Or are you referring to someone pulling a quarter out of your ear?|`|QX2fP3Cbaa	magic is not from the devil it is from the spirits of the people. what is done with it makes it white or black. you really need to read what you say before you post it you could make the wrong person angry|`|XBI9ekydaa	No, I say it's all made up bullshit.<br>  <br>  <br>  The cult guide book disagrees with you:<br>  <br>  Isaiah 45:7<br>  "I form the light, and create darkness: I make peace, and create evil: I the LORD do all these things."|`|OYG8vWhSaa	You know "for a fact"?

Since the sixties groups claiming to represent "True Christians" or "The Moral Right" have done acts of hatred to make many associate Christianity and more improtantly Christ to such groups.  In the 1960's a radical southern "moral right" group known as the KKK stirred up trouble in the South including bombing Black Churches.  In the 1970's "True Christians for Life" assaulted women nurses and doctors going in and out of multiple abortion Clinics.  In the 1980's they started bombing them.  Also the 1980's brought about anti-gay christian leaders to fight the right for gays to even have a political voice let alone a normal life.  In fact the original name for AIDS was Gay immune defency syndrome.  In the 1990's we saw many of the popular religious leaders exposed as tax frauds and even just plain old frauds.  The voices of Christianity most often heard are not voicing the "joyful" words of Christ but they use Christ name as an avenue for hate.  I believe in God but I can understand my opposition in this belief because of the impression we as a christian community have left. Romans 5:8, "But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us." In this verse and in John 3:16, we find no conditions placed on God's love for us. God doesn't say, "as soon as you clean up your act, I'll love you; " nor does He say, "I'll sacrifice my Son if you promise to love Me." In fact, in Romans 5:8, we find just the opposite. God wants us to know that His love is unconditional, so He sent His Son, Jesus Christ, to die for us while we were still unlovable sinners. We didn't have to get clean, and we didn't have to make any promises to God before we could experience His love. His love for us has always existed, and because of that, He did all the giving and sacrificing long before we were even aware that we needed His love.|`|MPAv0DdBaa	Why so much hate on Zeus?

You can be as UN-PC as you like and the government cannot legislate against it unless it's hateful, i.e., likely to incite violence.  "Political correctness" is the dirty word for "diplomacy."  It is necessary because in today's society you don't want to be discussing the presidency as being held by a colored guy.  You need to define what it is first, then then illustrate what's wrong with it, because I think people have their own definitions, which is what makes it all so wrong.|`|rThIVk2maa	The point of political correctness is to raise awareness about offending and unconsciously oppressing people. When certain phrases are used, such as "the office girl" or the endless variety of racist, religionist, ageist, or sexist remarks or any other slur or casual indifference, they subconsciously send the message that "that group isn't quite as important, so it's okay that I treat them as second class citizens". <br>  <br>  Most of the time that isn't what is meant, but that is what happens. And as people become more aware of what is and is not to be tolerated and that everybody has equal rights in our society, they become offended when those social slurs are committed. <br>  <br>  It all boils down to this, don't cause offense or humiliation. This is how we, as people, keep from killing each other.

For example, in a horse race, if the second horse follows the first horse so closely that its head is always overlapping the first horse’s body, then it is called Al-Musalli, and the first horse is called Saabiqun. [Taj-al-‘Urus, vol. 10, page 213; Lisan-al-‘Arab, vol. 7, page 398.] Therefore, Salaat means to follow Allah closely. The only way we can follow Allah is to follow His Book, Al-Quran, to remain within the limits imposed by it, and never to transgress these limits. This implies that we have to establish a system so that we lead our lives according to the Code enshrined in the Quran. Establishment of this system is referred to as Aqeemus Salaat by the Quran. This is quite different from theocracy where religious leaders rule in the name of God using their own version of ‘shariah’ rather than the ‘Shariah of God’, the Quran. "Woe to those who write the book with their own hands and then say, "This is from Allah" - 2:79", so says the Quran about them.<br>  <br>  The Quran uses the term Aqeemus Salaat quite often which is usually translated as "Establish Prayer." This translation does not fully convey the meaning of the original concept. The root of Aqeemu comes from ‘qaa-ma,’ which means to stand, to be balanced, to have a just, fair and long-term strategy for dealing with problems, and to be steadfast. Therefore, Aqeemus Salaat means "to establish Salaat" as a permanent and balanced system in which human beings can follow the Divine Code in all aspects of their lives individually, as well as collectively. This obviously requires an independent and sovereign land in which the Divine Code can be enforced as a living constitution. This is the essence of prayer and, in fact, an essential requirement for the establishment of Salaat. The Quran is very specific on this point when it says:<br>  <br>  "These are the people who, when they will have power in the land (24:55), then they will establish Salaat…" (24:21). <br>  We have seen that according to its root meaning, Salaat is a system and not a ritual.<br>  Praying is only one part,component of Salaat. When we finish our prayers in the Masjid, we are not done with Salaat. It is not something to do and finish. It involves every aspect of life, keeping it within the guidelines of the Divine Code twenty-four hours a day. And this has to be done within a system under a central authority according to the Quran. This system was originally established by our Prophet. This renewal boosts our psychological energy to come together and support each other towards the goals of the Quran. Salaat is the mechanism by which the Quran is implemented in mankind. This is how Allah’s laws can be engrained within us|`|I5pUxwPbaa	it helps to keep us on the right path, and to never forget our place on this earth and our humbleness as servants of God

Also get a leather punch or an awl and some leather lacing (you can use cording if you rather, just make sure it's thick). Lay your book open on the leather. Mark where your book will lie on the inside of the leather (the side you want facing the book, not the side you want out). Punch holes in the book cover every centimeter or so. Do the same for the leather on the places you marked. Lay the book back down and lace it to the book.

Some clothes go to third word nations, others go to be made into commercial rags, and some are ground up and used  for automobile insulation or padding. old shoes and sneakers are ground up and turned into running tracks for schools.  So none of it goes to waste in the landfill if you donate it to the Salvation Army. It will still go to good use.|`|GrwWH5XJaa	Give it to the Salvation Army.

Asteroids can only take out life, not the earth.|`|lJUyhMceaa	The Bible tells us that no one knows the time when Christ will return.  We can know the "season" (when it is getting close), but not the exact time.  Given the Biblical prophecies yet to come, and the world events going on right now, it would be safe to say that Jesus' return will be soon.  But, by soon I mean within the next three or four years.  Or, maybe even today.<br>  <br>  As far as "the world ending", it will not end when Jesus returns.  After He comes back for the Born again Children of God (saved, saints, redeemed), then there will be a period of time known as the "Seven year Tribulation".  After that there will be a 1000 year period when Jesus will rule here on earth.  After that, satan will be released for "a short time" to pull together an army and come against God.  He will fail of course and be cast into hell.  After that, the end will come.<br>  <br>  So, we have at least 1007 years before "the end of the World".  But, Jesus could very easily come back at any moment.  When He does, those who have heard the Gospel and have not accepted Christ as their Saviour will never have another opportunity to do so.  You will be lost for all eternity.  My suggestion is to get right with God now (today), and trust Christ as your Saviour, turning from your sins, and accepting God's salvation.  Then, whenever it happens, you will be ready.|`|gW0nD5cEaa	Nobody.

But if it is very large, the removal crew most likely will need to put some equipment in the neighbors yard to saw branches off. So you will want to talk to your neighbor to make sure it is okay with him. They don't just start sawing at the bottom of the trunk and yell timber like in the cartoons. Branches that are very large may have to be cut down in several pieces. And all main and most secondary limbs will all come off separately. When it is down to just the main trunk going up, that will be sawed off in several pieces too.<br>  You may want to let your neighbors know you will be cleaning up all of the mess from your endeavor.|`|c8d511b57b38b8ff3a19d1b90168fef3aa	Please don't cut the tree down just because it's messy - they're so beautiful and take so long to grow.  You could have it trimmed up, but it you really feel the need to take it down, you should let the neighbors know.|`|rThIVk2maa	You should inform your neighbors that your tree service will be removing those limbs (hopefully from your yard) on [specific date here] at [specific time here]. You have, of course, already asked the tree service if they will need to enter the neighbors yard, and you can inform your neighbors of what they have told you. <br>  <br>  Being good professional arborealists, they will guarantee the protection of each neighbors property and your own. Should damage occur, the neighbors may take it up with the tree company, not you.|`|AA11296044	I would be polite and inform them of your intentions.<br>  <br>  I would simply go over there introduce yourself as the new neighbor and let them know of your concerns regarding the tree and your intentions to move it.<br>  <br>  If you are going ot be replacing it with a neater tree, let them know as well.|`|DZCFD0p2aa	talk to your neighbours and offer to clean up any mess it makes in their yards when you cut it.|`|0003a5b50268aea93401640c3a727d6faa	The tree is on your property and you have the right to cut it down.

If you are prepared to clean it up yourself, why would they hire strangers to do the same thing.<br>  <br>  also, check with your local by-laws regarding tree removal.  Some cities require a permit and/or your rationale (in writing - always) as to why you want to cut this tree down, especially if it is healthy.|`|O4jGlC2caa	Honestly, I wouldn't cut the tree down.  Trees block sunlight in the summer and wind in the winter.  They help reduce the electric bill.  Plus yards without trees look so sterile.  <br>  <br>  Perhaps trimming the tree would be best (and not one of those cut all but the main branches off deals... just a nice trim).  It would still be good to let your neighbors know what you are doing out of common courtesy.<br>  <br>  Others are right.  You may find the other neighbors like the tree.  Cutting it down could also result in some ugly feuds with your new neighbors.|`|Gem96NQyaa	It would be wise to inform them that you're having tree services come out to remove that tree... just in case something goes wrong during the removal that results in property damage.

Maybe they like the tree and will "take-over" responsibility for it. Probably not, but they would probably also prefer not to be surprised by the chainsaws firing-up.

But this isn't just a "Mormon" teaching, here are examples of what the early Christian Fathers taught on the matter:<br>  <br>  -ATHANASIUS, bishop of Alexandria, in 347 A.D.:<br>  <br>  "The Word was made flesh in order that we might be enabled to be made gods. . . . Just as the Lord, putting on the body, became a man, so also we men are both deified through his flesh, and henceforth inherit everlasting life." (Athanasius, Against the Arians, 1.39, 3.39. )<br>  ---------------------<br>  <br>  -AUGUSTINE (AD 354-430), one of the the greatest of the early Christian Fathers:<br>  <br>  "But he himself that justifies also deifies, for by justifying he makes sons of God. 'For he has given them power to become the sons of God' [John 1:12]. If then we have been made sons of god, we have also been made gods." (Augustine, On the Psalms, 50:2).<br>  -----------------------<br>  <br>  -CLEMENT, an early Christian leader in Alexandria:<br>  <br>  "yea, I say, the Word of God became a man so that you might learn from a man how to become a god." (Clement of Alexandria, Exhortation to the Greeks, 1).<br>  <br>  ------------------------------<br>  <br>  People are obviously free to believe that what we are now is all we can become, but we believe there is a POINT to following God's teachings, and that point isn't free cloud rides and harp lessons in the afterlife.|`|6d10d96d77b1df1496e4b66f2f0098bcaa	Really that's no more ludicrous an idea than any other ideas espoused by various faiths (such as a "loving" god who condemns nonbelievers to Hell).|`|mxe86blRaa	No, they actually believe that.|`|46eedfcc0d431f5086b7b4cfa950eb57aa	No we do not believe we can become a God.

It is the first principle of the gospel to know for certainty the character of god and to know that we may converse with him as one man converses with another, and that he was once a man like us, yea, that God himself the father of us all, dwelt on an earth, the same as Jesus Christ himself did; and I will show it from the Bible." <br>   <br>  Author:  Joseph Smith <br>  Source:  History Of The Church <br>  Volume:  6 <br>  Page:  305 <br>   <br>  <br>  It's really crazy talk....IMHO.<br>  <br>  Here is a site that has most all of the quotes from LDS leaders about Godhood...<br>  SEE:<br>  <a href="http://www.mormonquotes.com/search.php?category_id=2&subcategory_id=32&photo=&submit=" rel="nofollow">http://www.mormonquotes.com/search.php?c...</a><br>  <br>  AND Eternal Progression...<br>  <a href="http://www.mormonquotes.com/search.php?category_id=2&subcategory_id=143&photo=&submit=" rel="nofollow">http://www.mormonquotes.com/search.php?c...</a><br>  <br>  QUOTE from Joseph Smith himself..<br>  "Here, then, is eternal life—to know the only wise and true God; and you have got to learn how to be Gods yourselves, and to be kings and priests to God, the same as all Gods have done before you, namely, by going from one small degree to another, and from a small capacity to a great one; from grace to grace, from exaltation to exaltation, until you attain to the resurrection of the dead, and are able to dwell in everlasting burnings, and to sit in glory, as do those who sit enthroned in everlasting power."<br>   <br>  Author:  Joseph Smith <br>  Source:  Discourses of the Prophet Joseph Smith <br>  Chapter:  44 <br>  Page:  341 <br>   <br>  Seems pretty clear to me.|`|CecQFtDvaa	it was a bunch of hogwash <br>  we  DO NOT belive you can become a god|`|0lTNy27saa	Yes they believe that God also had to progress and become God, and that we being his children can progress and become Gods.|`|FByWgM5baa	Paul seemed to believe it...Phillipians 3:14<br>  <br>  <br>  You tell me...|`|qvuQSQvpaa	i equate immortality as being a form of a god. so i think christians believe somthin like that too|`|6lJuKKMHaa	Good question!

Practically they need then and there the best a parent can give when :<br>  -- a marriage breaks up<br>  -- someone dies<br>  -- they want to know where they came from and are going<br>  <br>  Notice, I have not come down on any opinion just on laziness.This sore-mouthed Bass knows bait when he sees it.|`|NCRfZRopaa	No, it's not wrong to bring your kids up in a skeptical or atheistic way.|`|tl2pMkOcaa	No more wrong than bringing them up to believe in Santa Claus or the Tooth Fairy.|`|X8LNbaKQaa	There are certainly cases where it lead to bad futures.

I find it more useful to say that as a society we should support the idea that kids should respect their parents and accept the parenting they are receiving.  If a child wants to do something different as an adult, fine.  And if they want to raise their own children differently, fine.  <br>  <br>  I support parents being the authorities in their households (I'm not talking about abusive households).  It's up to them how they raise their kids, in spite of all the "they should do this, they should do that" and there are many ways to go down that path.|`|FmazIF6Maa	If parents do not believe in God, it would be silly to bring their kids up believing in something they think is a fairy tale.<br>  <br>  If parents believe in God, or Goddess, or any Higher Powers, I feel you should share that with your children, but ultimately you have to allow them to think for themselves and come to their own opinions.|`|26DoxkOBaa	I think it would be better if they didn't. Children should be given the freedom to think for themselves, and belief doesn't let you do that. Any belief prevents real intelligence which requires freedom to function.|`|AA11282654	No. It's wrong teaching kids baseless religious philosophies. I'm sure you agree as long as it's not your own god.|`|ridu0Rtwaa	NO!!

I can't imagine not being able to go to God when I have a burden or I'm just not sure of myself or I need direction in anyway.  I think parents should train the child in the way he should go.... the child may stray but eventually, when it get's tough enough...they WILL look to God for deliverance.|`|MkZC5gd6aa	It's fine to teach your children about your OPINION, but important to point out that it is only ONE opinion.<br>  <br>  Personally I plan on bringing my kids up atheist, like me, however if they show interest in a religion, they are free to choose it. But they're going to have to put up with old dad mocking them from time to time :)|`|2ogimlBxaa	I find it's only bad if you turn them into tiny Fred Phelpses.<br>  <br>  Edit: Oops, misread it.

They will find thier way one day and it will make them happy bc THEY chose it...    ;)|`|lJUyhMceaa	Yes.  We are commanded of God to "train up a child in the way they should go".<br>  <br>  Parents will stand before God and give an account for how they raised their Child.  Once that child leaves home, then it is on them.<br>  <br>  I can not understand how a parent who says love their children can take the stand, "I will let them make up their own minds when they are ready".  Children's brains are not equip to make decisions like that on their own.  They must be taught right and wrong...good and bad.<br>  <br>  It is the parents RESPONSIBILITY to teach them these things.  This would include teaching them about God and Jesus Christ.  <br>  <br>  Now of course I am talking to parents who believe in God themselves.  If there is someone reading this that is a parent and does not believe in God, they of course would see no sense in teaching their child about God.  However, they will still stand before Him someday and give an account.  They know there is a God, they just don't want to acknowledge Him.<br>  <br>  God will get the truth to their children somehow, and they will have to make a decision, but the parents who did not teach their child about God and about His Saviour Jesus Christ, will stand accountable before God.|`|f8mLpPXlaa	It is wrong to tell them there is no God. You could simply say that a lot of people believe there is but your father and I don't. Let him or her make up their own minds.|`|UxSF3Doaaa	It is written clearly in the Bible that parents are accountable for how their children gets raised.|`|jsM8F4bLaa	yes, I believe the Lord says this is one of the things that you as a parent have to do. :)|`|182defe841baeb406682182cc8675475aa	No, in fact, I'd say it's commendable to allow your children to make up their own minds, when they're ready.  Cheers to you.|`|AA10609634	No, not at all.  <br>  <br>  But what do you tell them when they ask, "What happens when you die?"|`|CBUPymktaa	kids will believe what you do i think .. forcing things doesnt do a thing ..|`|VMXl7Up1aa	no|`|62s7J8sHaa	There was a study published recently in Great Britain. Children who are raised without some sort of God-figure in their lives have many disadvantages:<br>  <br>  Their test scores are lower in the early years of school<br>  Their ability to relate to others is less<br>  They have less self-control<br>  Anecdotal evidence - non-measurable - was that their teachers observed them to be less happy and/or contented than other children<br>  <br>  This was not carried out or commissioned by religious people. In fact, the researchers were surprised and disappointed in their findings.<br>  <br>  My opinion: Children come to earth knowing that they are eternal beings with a purpose in life. It is their unthinking parents who rob them of what they know innately. Or worse, substitute the Easter Bunny, Father Christmas, Santa Claus, etc. for the God they left just a short time ago.|`|2eGgbhVoaa	Nope. <br>  <br>  What you have to understand is that it is not about right and wrong. No religion is more right or wrong than any other. Atheism and agnosticism are not more right or wrong than any religion.<br>  <br>  If a child is brought up with any belief background they can turn out good or bad or just fine. It does not really matter. I've seen plenty evil Christians, for example, and plenty good ones.<br>  <br>  I grew up having no beliefs forced on me. My parents left it up to me what to choose and yet I still grew up with an incredible sense of compassion and morality. So how can it be wrong?|`|XeaC5UZhaa	No its wrong to bring your kids up believing in God! That's the great thing about free will and thinking if they choose to follow God later in their life than that is there Choice. Religion is forced into too many children and religious beliefs are fed off of fear of the unknown. Its better that a kid has more than "faith" to look at.|`|e4OWhHP1aa	of course it isn't. it is wrong to tell your children stuff that you believe to be lies, and it isn't right to force them to believe in a god, if they don't want to. if you beleve in god, then you bring your kids up beleiving that you believe. i would not tell my kid that god exists, but that i believe he does. of course that is just my oppinion. i do not personally beleive in a god. i beleive in evidence, and so far, there has been no solid proof of a god, and there has been agains it. <br>  <br>  but to get back on topic, no it is not wrong to raise children not beleiving in god. it is up to your children to decide what they believe.|`|t88527U1aa	It is wrong not to be true to your convictions Children watch us for good for bad they will emulate us! If you teach children no hope will be hopeless you teach them love and plan for there lives they will thrive. To teach a child that they end up rotting in the ground is mental child abuse I totally agree. To teach your hope that is in you,tantamount to a happy person later in life!|`|gj18ySAWaa	Iit is if that parent goes to service. For example if your spouse stays home for whatever reason & your children want to do the same, do you force them to go with you? I want my oldest son (age8)  to go with us as wel las my 4 yr old son, but they want to stay with their daddy at home, so do I argue an hour & waste energy & time? no. What I do is give them the choice, but I do instill the bible to them & read them bible stories so they're still knowing who God is.|`|qpMX2Mhxaa	OF COURSE NOT!<br>  <br>  If anything, it's surely the right thing to do.<br>  You wouldn't be forcing a belief upon them.<br>  It makes more sense to let them believe what they wish as children.<br>  If they choose to take up religion later on in life, so be it.<br>  Far easier than having them renounce the faith in an act of rebellion.|`|DJd0DruQaa	i think it ix. god is real, just open a bible and see..god has done many things for me and my family, but we by no means have a great life. god isnt a magic geenie, but if you come to him and seek him he will help you get through life|`|33d13c8fa116273403e0f7b580bfabe3aa	No, it's all in what you believe... If you give your children the freedom to choose for themselves instead of cramming it down their throats I personally believe you will raise a more open minded and accepting human being.|`|XKzUsb7zaa	If you are a christian and you do not encourage your child to believe, then that is wrong, just as any Muslim should teach their children and so on...|`|YBRQsmLMaa	It's not wrong but it's certainly not right either!

3q3QXQp4aa	I agree with first answerer. In UK its not compulsory by any means and a lot of people don;t because they either don't realise they are supposed to or are just mean. I tip waiting staff and taxi drivers usually. Only for good service for waiting staff, politeness for also and promptness for taxi drivers. I usually round it up, say if the fare is ￡5.10 i'd say ￡5.50. Not a lot as you are paying for the service in the first place for taxis and they charge a bloody fortune anyway. With waiting staff its rounded up again but if a meal is say...￡26 i'd leave ￡30. Thats reasonable to me in a country where its not expected and rigidly defined as it is in US for instance. You pay service charge anyway, the tip is for the waiter/ess. <br>  Other than that...can't think of anywhere else it would be appropriate. We are proud people as a country and a tip offered can sometimes offend people.|`|0F8hauikaa	Factor in your own financial circumstances. There are high ends and low ends to the range of acceptable tips. But you can't go breaking the bank just to pay for good service, so knowing your capability is primary. <br>  <br>  Figure out what kind of service it is you're receiving. Some services should receive percentage-based tips, while others are more of a flat cost (most of the time). A car washer, coat checker or furniture movers should require a flat rate. From $2-$5 for a car washer to $10-$50 per mover. Other people like hairstylists and waiters should receive 15 percent to 20 percent, sometimes more. Pizza delivery service is usually about 10 percent, but no less than $2. <br>  <br>  Use your best judgment. What's the real different between, say, 15 percent and 20 percent, when it means a matter of a dollar? Well, it says a lot to the person who you're tipping. The additional dollar (or one fewer) tells them how they're doing. You're essentially helping others' future experiences with that person. For things like babysitters, nannies or house cleaners, tip them at the end of each month at an amount you see fit. No more than one week's pay for a month of work, but the work they do is constant and not easy, so they do deserve a heftier tip. So, keep things like that in mind. <br>  <br>  Be discreet. Don't flaunt how much you're tipping someone at a restaurant by leaving the bill in plain view. If you're paying for a household service, placing the tip in an envelope is a good idea. Basically, you want to keep the tip transaction -- good or bad -- between you and the person receiving the tip.|`|AA10404097	If you are in doubt you can never go wrong to say "Thank you very much would you accept a small gratuity?". If they are used to getting tips they will say "Why thank you" and then you tip them.|`|145811a27a6c8d5d7b012583d1de95f0aa	Here are a few guidelines to follow:<br>  <br>  When their occupation depends on it and if they are on commission.  <br>  <br>  If we are talking about the food industry in the US servers at a restaurant make way less than minimum wage because tips are supposed to compensate this lack of earning; therefore you should tip servers.  Fast food workers make at least minimum wage so you don't have to tip them.  If you don't want to tip a server at a sit down restaurant, don't go to one.  Go to a cafeteria or a fast food place where it is not required.<br>  <br>  Tip chauffeurs and taxi-cab drivers because their job is all on commission.  <br>  <br>  If you order a drink at a bar, give the bar tender a dollar for every drink you order.  <br>  <br>  Tip hair dressers 10 to 15% of the cost of the hair cut.<br>  <br>  If you stay at a hotel it is customary to leave a few dollars on your pillow for the maids.<br>  <br>  For adequate service, give an adequate tip.<br>  <br>  For excellent service, give a generous tip.<br>  <br>  For robotic service give the bare minimum for a tip.<br>  <br>  For poor service give no tip and complain to the manager.|`|216d90e6aa749da6fe51585ee054ef87aa	Any time any type of services to you are rendered.<br>  <br>  <br>  nfd?|`|DZCFD0p2aa	Depends on the country you are in.|`|mhvb9eFkaa	Everybody has their own ideas on tipping; how much, when, where...<br>  This article has some other interesting thoughts:<br>  <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/12/08/AR2005120801834.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/con...</a><br>  <br>  Bon Appetite!|`|SYaSbJb5aa	Restaurants, bars, bellhops, taxis, hairdressers....<br>  <br>  <br>  15% is a good amount.|`|34XCm07vaa	when i feeneesh eating at the restaurant, gringo.|`|AA11579380	if they are friendly and patient...and positive,then you could tip them
gq9W69rcaa	probably. You should do some reasearch on your house and the particular room that you were sleeping in. The question to determine whether your house was broken into was did it linger and then vanish into the air...or did it linger and then run. <br>  <br>  Also when you woke up was your room colder that it normally was? Usually unnatural coldness is a frequent sign of a ghost. <br>  <br>  Oh and if it was a robber they wouldnt have lingered like they did once they realized that you were awake|`|J5KpCgeEaa	Maybe you thought you were awake but were still dreaming, but ghosts do exist.|`|0iOqIbfNaa	yea it was. glad you didnt freak out|`|SDDgbtQ4aa	Since you awoke from a peaceful sleep, consider this could have been a hallucination caused by sleep paralysis.

I would suggest seeing a doctor. Are you on any medicines that could cause hallucinations, any problems with any mental illnesses, drug abuse, etc? Don't be upset about me asking these questions as the doctor  will anyway so be prepared to tell the truth. You won't get in trouble for admitting drug use as you're seeking medical attention and they would advise you to seek help. This is not normal to wake up like this as you did. If you check out okay than I'd suggest having a pastor come to your house to try to rid it of any spirits as they might know more about this kind of thing than most. Good luck to you.|`|0fd322f7e3846eddeeb82c635c2ce31baa	Perhaps it was sleep paralysis? Part of the hallucinations that come with sleep paralysis are images or speaking that appear during the paralysis. The person may think that someone is standing beside them or they may hear strange sounds. These may be dreamlike, possibly causing the person to think that they are still dreaming.<br>  <br>  Has anyone in your house, aside from  you, seen any "images" or "beings" present?

8BRdSzoaaa	He maybe older than you are but at 50 i hope that i have the same sex drive i have now. I think you need to set down with him and talk to him if he is in love with you like you-are with him then talk is very import in your lives.I know it is in my life. The old saying just because there is snow on the chimney does not mean there is no fire in the heater. Sounds like he has git set in hes ways and some people do that. Please talk with him and see how he feels I know how it is to be an older guy and what someone younger to love you.|`|AA11164025	Well your still young, and at 50....yea....people his age tend to....sloooooow down and be lazyish sorta as you said with the eating, tv, and sleeping. you should find someone that HAS a sex drive too lol, don't waste your time waiting for him to want it. find someone younger ^_^ but if you love him just tell him, he might reactivate his sex drive, ya never know.|`|E5iFR6BJaa	Talk with him. He is 50 years old. I'm sure he is wise enough to give you directions.<br>  <br>  Although, I already predicted the outcome.......|`|2RWayH3Oaa	Best thing to do is talk to him and discuss things.  If he feels he is not satisfying you sexually then either he will have to improve on it or he may ask if you want to see other people.  It takes two in a relationship.  So start the conversation.|`|MyszK0T4aa	just talk to him tell him you still want to talk to him and everything but there is no sex drive for you anymore ... he should understand<br>  <br>  And jesuslover get a life im 18 and dating a 38 old man and im a man to so that makes me gay.... go to the jesus section of yahoo if you want to talk about jesus not the gay section cause we really dont care how wrong the bible says being gay is wrong|`|FJPKtZN5aa	i think you should tell him how you feel...<br>  tell him you love him very much and how you need sex once in a while your 28.<br>  then again he might not understand but he might.<br>  but hes 22 years older then you, are you sure it working out, even tho i think love matters more then age are you sure he's right for you.<br>  but just tell him  what you think|`|7q78bhAaaa	well thats always the risk of getting into it with someone way older than you are because you wont be at the same level sexually.

tYO2Ir1oaa	Haven't seen those films but i've had my own kind of love story and yes, they do exist! Mine's a little longwinded, but my friend met somebody once on holiday and they ended up speaking on the phone a lot when they were back in the UK. They were just friends and nothing had happened between them, although they both liked each other without openly admitting it. She was due to move to Paris to work, and 2 days after she moved there, the he showed up in Paris and confessed his undying love and said he couldn't live without her. 7 years later they are still completely devoted to each other|`|D1vWRwOaaa	ive always had the bad parts of the romantic things but never the good things..so i'm still waiting:)|`|ESKslyfsaa	My sister met a man in the pub and she really liked him but was too shy to tell him.  A few weeks later she saw him again and followed him home (stalker!) and put a note through his door and the rest is history, they've been married for 5 years now, have a baby daughter and are blissfully happy.|`|ae3e1d351362ce2aa8644626c2d77f9caa	My partner and I met through tagged on the 30th aug 2008, two days later, he came to my house for a coffee, as soon as our eyes met, we knew that we would be together forever, it was more than love at first sight, it was like we had been searching for each other, it was like we have known one another for years. He came to see me on 1st September and is still here 5 months later, every day is like the first. We had both given up looking for love and was going to settle for friendship. Our love for each other is more than ever our wildest dreams could have given us. We are friends as well as partners, we are soulmates and do not feel complete now without each other. The best thing about this story is that it is actually my life, it has turned it all around.
IU2Znlv3aa	In my opinion that was an unethical question to ask.<br>  You are not there to worship, you are there to work, why should your beliefs have any effect on you ability to work?<br>  As for whether it's legal or not i have no idea, but for them to ask you that question in a job interview is an absolute joke, and completely useless in determining whether you would be a good employee.|`|11a867519828ee7f2df6eda7cb34fb8faa	Personally, I think religion should never be allowed in the workplace or schools.   However, if you are being interviewed at the St. Paul's Elementary school, you can expect they want religious people.  If the name of the car wash is the Holy Trinity Car Wash, you can bet it is owned by Christians.   But what really irritates me is that these places make profits and get to claim them.  Are they tax free?  I don't think you can be a religious organization and a place of business at the same time.  I think it is definitely a conflict of interests.  Stay away from small town religious businesses or trust me, they will be into your personal life.|`|4fd0Bmpmaa	In America, we are free to be whatever religion we chose, and possibly not one at all. So it would be extremely bias, and very rude to not hire someone because of their religion. Also you should have the freedom to not bring your personal life into the workplace. In fact during such is sometimes distracting to other employees, if religious talk is struck up. Remember what they say... "If you want to get in a fight, bring up Religion, Politics, or Family.|`|CM0C65dtaa	Here in Canada, it is illegal to base hiring on a persons religion, I'm not sure if they can even ask.|`|VU4DLpnlaa	over here in UK it is illegal to ask those sorts of q's in an interview, and to refuse to take someone on due to there religious beliefs is even more so.

SaQ5d420aa	I don't know why you would meet with a doctor to ask questions about gay marriage.<br>  Get an interview with your state senators or legislators.  Maybe even your  town mayor to get gay partnerships recognized by them.  Start local, spread nationally.<br>  <br>  As for asking questions: does he know any happy couples?  Can they speak out and stand up as an example of what happiness looks like?  Has the doctor ever felt he needlessly stimulated a man or woman just to see them squirm.  Is that normal behavior for a medical man to do?  How about doing a prostate exam: can he tell if the guy is gay?<br>  <br>  Have fun.
2d98c2bb1f91687f4c39b7eaa00a89c9aa	I would get statics on how much it occurs, do women seek help, do they stay with their spouses etc|`|RoqxGbgRaa	i would go back and discuss the history of rape in the law, where it was generally accepted that a husband could not be guilty of rape against his wife.  physical intimacy with her husband was a wife's duty, so if he took it against her wishes and by violent means, he was still well within his rights, and no charges could be brought against him.<br>  <br>  i would talk about how over the 20th century, rape became seen as an issue of power much more than of sexuality.  in this regard, rape--no matter who commits it--is guilty of using sex as a declaration of power.  it is an act of subjugation.  <br>  <br>  this coincides nicely with a discussion of the power differential that has always existed in marriages, wherein in a patriarchal society, a man has the force of law and culture on his side, and a woman has much less recourse. <br>  <br>  for examples, you might look at the famous scene from what's love got to do with it, or read tina turner's biography (i, tina), which the movie is based on.|`|vXa7IeDiaa	If you want an example.. watch movies<br>  <br>  The Burning Bed<br>  Whats Love Got to do With It|`|uqMK3rUZaa	You could quote statistics on rape and spousal rape and the reasons rape occurs and why a spouse would rape the other spouse.

tK7hl9Qlaa	Before you call the cops, talk to them.<br>  <br>  Tell them that what they do with their own time is their own business, but when it starts affecting their neighbors that's when they are overstepping their boundaries, so to speak.  Tell them that you need to be able to sleep at night in order to keep functioning in your life, so they cannot be loud at night.  Let them know that you are serious.  Do not threaten to call the cops.<br>  <br>  Make it an issue of morals, not an issue of legality.<br>  <br>  If they choose not to listen, call the cops carefully, because you want to make sure it works.  Make sure that it is after midnight, that there are a lot of people there, and that they are being loud.  If you are sure they have underage people there, that is a plus.  Then when you call the cops, they will be able to bust some people.  This ensures consequences, and consequences help with changing behavior.  <br>  <br>  If your neighbors know they can get in serious trouble for acting like idiots, they will be less likely to do so.|`|DZB0WCmmaa	live the car at a paid/guarded car park, or a garage.

So you're an Atheists, ask her what's she going to do about it? And if she's such a believer in God why is she going out of her way to judge you when that is up to HIM. And walk away. Peace.|`|PVbJtssZaa	well, it cant be racist because she doesnt hate u based on ur race, she hates u because you dont believe in god.<br>  <br>  She's just being opinionated, and quite frankly she has no room to talk because God says you shouldnt hate anyone, and hatred is a sin. SO JUST TELL HER THAT SHE AINT FOLLOWING HER RELIGION AND SHE's A HYPOCRITE!|`|00b5UjqBaa	no, being racist is having something against your race. not your religion. you can't do anything about it; if she doesn't like the fact that you're an atheist then let it go.|`|eqaUMrYZaa	She has every right to hate you and your religion.Now if she keeps harassing you or physically harming you , then you need to step up.Other than that , who cares ?|`|2AqU4SjYaa	It is not racism because her actions are based on your religion (or lack thereof) not race.<br>  <br>  She is a religious bigot . .. . not racist.<br>  <br>  Dan in Miami|`|znjl6WrWaa	That is religious discrimination not racism. and yes if you're having an issue you should go to your school administration.|`|QsxIPCCZaa	not racism but discrimination|`|X5hTmAkBaa	does atheism have anything to do with race?|`|b87482cd8013bcfad52b6cff60829a6eaa	she is of course not a racist. She has to hate someone because of race (your race is your nationality...color) she is just prejudice. its religious prejudice and the same if she decided to hate all Catholics or Buddists. She is probably saying she hates you because the fact that you are atheist might be scary to her and she probably has been raised to believe that atheist is bad.|`|Dk8ro0a1aa	No its not racism, because it doesn't have anything to do with being harassed because of your ethnicity(Race). But that still does not take away from the fact that you ARE being harassed for something you have every right to believe (or don't believe). Not to mention that while they are harassing you because you don't believe in God, their behavior shows no signs of them believing in him either. Its people like this that gives active christian like myself a bad rap. Who the heck would even WANT to believe in our God if so call believers act like these clowns? Stick by your guns, you have just as much right to disbelieve, as I do to believe. If you ever need a best friend, give me a Holla'....aaight?!?!   TT|`|aLGe7JZEaa	No.  It is actually called Religious intolerance<br>  <br>  The mere statement on the part of a religion that its own beliefs and practices are correct and any contrary beliefs incorrect does not in itself constitute intolerance (ie., ideological intolerance). There are many cases throughout history of established religions tolerating other practices. Religious intolerance, rather, is when a group (a society, a religious group) specifically refuses to tolerate practices, persons or beliefs on religious grounds (ie., intolerance in practice).|`|GepkdhPvaa	No, the true definition of racism is believing that your race is genetically superior to all others.  That statement means you believe that your skin color was born smarter, faster, better, whatever to every other race. <br>  <br>  What she did was called "being stupid" because you are an atheist you will receive a lot of stupid coming your way. I suggest mace the ***** and continue along your mary way through life.|`|oAkhoCQ6aa	No, it's not racism. Racism is discrimination based on race, ethnicity, color of skin, etc. Atheism is in the realm of religions and beliefs, so has nothing to do with races and the like.<br>  <br>  She could be accused of prejudice, which is a broader category of discrimination. Prejudice is simply discrimination without reason.|`|fOSmIyaRaa	NO!!!! good grief....another prime example of how "racism" is used way out of context in this country.<br>  <br>  looking at these other answers it seems since  "race" is not involved its an "opinion" that is ALSO for people who don't like other races! that is their OPINION and they are more than intitled to that!!|`|Ay7Fkvd4aa	No atheism is not a race it is a belief.  So she wouldn't be raciest just a bigot.<br>  <br>   bigot is a person who, without thought, is intolerant of opinions, lifestyles or identities differing from his or her own, and bigotry is the corresponding attitude or mindset|`|h1bTiQvIaa	It's only racism when the focus is on race. Hence the name. Racism is just a particular kind of prejudice.<br>  <br>  Being discriminated because you are atheist is just general prejudice.|`|3SRH0p06aa	No that is racism contary to the above comments. Your being discrimated against... Say you wanted to kill a certain some1 because they was jewish, now that would b racist wouldnt it. Thats because of some1s belief.|`|InmfvbVxaa	If you are an atheist you shouldn't believe in anything like you said you do. Racism is about the race not your believes and religious thoughts. What she does is called the HARASSMENT.|`|169uCi1Naa	No, racism is when you hate someone because of their race (like if their asian, white or black). Religion has nothing to do with racism. Hating somebody because of their religion is religious intolerence.|`|lEFmUa3iaa	no its doesn't make her racist but it does make her prejudice whether it is religion,sex gender but racist would be not liking somone solely based on their race|`|mePPZXAsaa	no she is just a religious ***. she is discriminating because you are an atheist.|`|8NphFD9maa	Tell her to go fly a kite.|`|8mQILFtVaa	No.|`|fZEVgFe8aa	I could see it as an effective comeback in the heat of the moment.  Call her a Hater instead.  Or, if she hates you because you are an "atheist" then she's not worth your time and trouble, and scr*w her. Why do you call yourself an atheist and why is it any of her business anyway?  Your faith and beliefs are personal and private.<br>  <br>  No you should not do anything about it, its in God's Hands.<br>  Just kidding Sweetstuff.<br>  Hey, just pass it off as lesson learned...

2AkngfXwaa	Do you have documentation that you are? A naming ceremony is a family occasion the family consults with a medicine man then the family has a giveaway to honor friends and elders of the tribe. A name is also given to a young boy after they do a vision quest which is not done very often anymore. A name will also be given to someone if they did a great thing and the tribe wants to honor them. In other words not  everyone in the tribe gets a name. You don't get one just because you are Indian. Half of the US population claims to be part Indian.At least it seems that way to me  I can't tell you how many times complete strangers will come to me and tell me of their supposed Indian linage most of it hearsay anyway. The Blackfoot reservation in the US is located in  Northern Montana right by the Canadian border they are other bands in Canada.|`|SSave0Rvaa	You Can't|`|Dw4jXVnHaa	Make one up.|`|igI5yX0vaa	Research your Blackfoot roots and traditions.

6ELSwKKvaa	I am all for homosexual parenting. There are a lot of babies and children out there who need love. Many people say that they will turn their child gay and that is why they shouldn't parent. Well, I can tell you... my best friend growing up was a lesbian. She went into the military and to prove she wasn't gay, had sex with a guy. (They will kick you out if you are gay) She conceived a son that she raised with another woman. This boy is now 18 years old and in college and very straight. He is also respectful of women. He has been dating the same girl for about 4 years now and they have plans to get married once they are both finished with college. The straight father on the other hand, was told he was going to be a father and he claimed it wasn't his. (She knew it was because she only did it once and it was with him) He has rejected any connection with his son and at present, no one even knows where they can find him. He never paid a dime of child support either.<br>  <br>   Now, I am about as straight as a person can be, and I have a lesbian daughter. I feel I did a great job in raising her and this is not something that she should be ashamed of. This is just part of who she is. It is not something that happened to her growing up. She has both a father and a mother who love her dearly. We are married to each other, ( a rare thing these days indeed) and are both Christian.<br>  <br>    Homosexuals just as good of parents as heterosexuals and in some cases even better parents! They at least get a child because they WANT one but lots of heterosexuals wind up with kids and are resentful because they didn't want one in the first place and were not ready to give up their freedom to become parents.|`|OsY0lmTCaa	Language is a tool. That's one thing that you should remember. It's likely the most true form of magic to ever exist. We can cause wars, peace, hatred and love merely by uttering certain phrases. <br>  <br>  Consider the language of your question: "Does homosexual parenting really matter?" <br>  <br>  Homosexual parenting places an untrue expectation on all parents who are homosexual. It makes it look like they are raising children to be gay. That's not the case. Instead you might ask: "Does it matter if a parent is homosexual?" to which the answer would be "no, it does not matter in the least."<br>  <br>  "Is it whats right for the child?"<br>  <br>  What's right for the child is to have a loving family that promotes a healthy and happy life. What's right for the child is to be provided for in a safe environment, that promotes growth and education.<br>  <br>  "What if you were and wanted a child?"<br>  <br>  I'm not homosexual. But if I were and wanted a child, then I'd find a willing partner and make a baby. That could be through natural methods, or medical methods, but so long as we both agreed to the method, I'd be happy.<br>  <br>  Hope this answer helped.|`|9MZ7Gygdaa	Im against it, but that doesnt nessisarily mean it wouldnt work out.<br>  <br>  I think there has always been a 'mothering' figure and a 'fathering figure' and only they can be shown from the correct sex. How good a parent you are doesnt depend on your gender, but i think as a child growing up you need a balance like with food, learning, and of course with your parents being married and girl and boy, you understand what love is. You have a more likely chance of being gay if you have gay parents i think. <br>  <br>  It doesnt mean Gay parents cant raise a child, i just think it would be unfair on the child as they wouldnt be able to understand about relationships at such a young age. :)|`|qbb9YiRsaa	Me and my partner are raising our too kids.  All children need are a loving family to be raised in.  It does not matter what that family is comprised of.  Also, its important to note that it would stand to argue that gay parents might be better parents then some because they CHOOSE to be parents.  Many parents have children thrust upon them (the children we have were both results of "accidents" and the mother has since not been allowed to see them due to her inability to keep them safe) while gay parents have to go through so many hoops and deal with the scrutiny of society that they really need to want to be parents to be parents.  I think we are doing a pretty good job so far.|`|qGVBxZZOaa	Your sexual orientation is no reflection on your parenting skills.<br>  I honestly think they are better, because they are a lot more open-minded, though some straight couples have the same mind frame.<br>  Right for the child?<br>  Having them grow up in a different environment, in my opinion, is better. Because they see, right then and there, that love is love. <br>  If I wanted a child, then I'd try to adopt. Or insemination.<br>  Hope this helped :)|`|AuVlR4cYaa	Well, lets look at it this way;<br>  <br>  Say you have a father and a step father and they are both good parent - figures.<br>  Now lets say your mother died and your father never remarried or anything.<br>  Your step father's still in your life.<br>  <br>  So, you've got dad and step dad. Both still good parent's regardless of whether there is a mother figure or not.<br>  <br>  Vice Versa with Mother & Step mother.<br>  <br>  So what makes gay couples any different? Nothing.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  I can see many of you now "What if the child is unaccepting of gays?"<br>  If you're raised around something - its usually something you accept.<br>  I found out my mom was bisexual when I was 11 - heard her having sex. Cried at first b/c it wasn't something I'd ever been around. Now I'm fine. (& bi, go figure? Maybe its genetic.....)|`|V0Y0wTQ2aa	The only thing that matters is the child is okay with having gay parents, in my opinion anyway. But other than that, the people above me said everything else.|`|7uNASlURaa	I don't think it matters.  All that matters is if you are a good parent, love your child unconditionally and help/be there for them when they need you.  Hope this helped =)|`|T588vfJDaa	Don't see how it matters|`|yzgS5KiQaa	Well my father physically abused me as a toddler, an mentally, verbally and emotionally abused me the rest of my life. And my mother sexually abused me, then psychologically abused me saying I would go to hell when I was a small child if I didn't do crazy things,like stay in my room for hours. An she taught me that if I liked or wanted something it was satan tempting me, it got to the point where if I wanted food, I felt like Satan was tempting me, and I would feel like a sinner if I broke down and ate or something. She would often give me things an then take them away once i loved them because I "loved it more than Jesus". Later she would watch my father abuse me an then tell me I deserved it. Yeah, I think that having your two hetero parents is overrated, to the maximum degree. I would rather have had two daddies, or two mommies, than two f*ckups.

ANYTHING said that often gets annoying.

Or sometimes I say, "Zeus has nothing to do with my cold.  Blame Xoltchili, the Aztec god of winds and rain."<br>  <br>  Seriously?

Living in the wild, without the ease of modern technology, genetic defects were an early death sentence, and populations that tended to inbreed would tend to die out. That 'stuff' hasn't died out today, there are cultures where cousins marry in order to cement clan ties.<br>        In the modern world, where unfortunates born with defects can expect to live due to advances in medical care, brute nature has lost much of its role in culling. Intelligent educated people can take care ahead of time, to have themselves tested for potential genetic abnormalities before they go ahead and have children. None of our modern medical advances in this area could have occurred without an undrestanding of genetics and evolution, you need to get some schooling, bucky.|`|WMrNa3Doaa	I don't think any "evolutionists" are saying that.  I don't think anyone says that brothers and sisters were having sex with each other.  Genes that are passed down can either be recessive or dominant.  It only takes one dominant gene from one parent in order to pass that gene down to the offspring, which would cause that offspring to exhibit that trait.  So, you wouldn't need two people possessing the same gene in order to further the evolutionary process. <br>  <br>  The reason incestuous procreation is harmful, is that it severely limits the gene pool and allows a larger chance of two recessive genes (one from each parent) to combine, which would make their offspring possess that trait. If it's a harmful trait, then that is bad.  And if this goes on for generations, the chances go up for more recessive/negative traits to show up in the population.|`|rUgC7SPsaa	Because evolution also effected our brains...  we now know that reproducing with blood relatives creates genetic abnormalities in children.... when we were neanderthals, the human race simply didn't have that information.|`|oY4vwdjVaa	Having 5 too many chromosomes isn't called evolution - It's called still birth.|`|2UUcuhHZaa	hi,this is easy to answer for u ,now think about the things we eat and the things we drink an the things we smell in the air ,everythings has something in it right ,look at the meat before it comes to us ,what happens to it, an what do they feed it to keep it healthy,the same go's for what we drink,and the air we breath ,but back then their was nothing like it is today ,they eat from the land and it was pure ,thats why their was no defects happening then everything was really good and pure,but as time went on we added these things into our bodys which makes the defects in our dna ,thats why some people feel that if u have sex with some one in family or some one else close to u the children will come out defromedin some way which is bull crap,i know more than 8 dozens couples that are close relatives with kids and theirs nothing wrong with them so ,i just think they say that to scare u ok ,well bye 4 now

If nothing else, you may find a true friend in her....not the friends you have that judge other people.  The best way to stop your friends from insulting you is to ignore the insults.  They want to get a reaction from you.  When there isn't one, they will stop.  When she turns out to be fun, they will feel stupid.|`|3q3QXQp4aa	Don't be so shallow and you'll find life in general a whole less awkward.|`|LWvh2g2maa	Well you shouldn't have said yes if you didn't want to go.  No one should feel obligated to do something just because they were asked.  You can say no.    Now that you've agreed you need to suck it up and go.  Who cares what anyone says.  Geez dude.  There are more important things in life to fret about.  I mean, grow up.  These things only exist in high school.    Didn't you say this is her dance?  Why would your friends be there if it's a dance from another school?|`|fYWE0fBjaa	You must be thinking about it, otherwise you wouldn't ask here.  What your friends say (and if they poke fun) is of no consequence.  You've already spent a little time with her - so how do you feel about her?  That is all that matters.  If you feel you'd like to know her a bit better, learn a bit about this girl, then go for it.  If it doesn't work out it doesn't matter.  Let your friends laugh, but you will have learnt from the situation - as much about yourself as anything.   If you feel you really are not interested in her at all from your own personal experiences then "no" is the only answer.  This isn't about other people - it's about you and her.
LPO8RlVdaa	First of all, it is certainly possible, as Vikings were extremely competent sailors and traded throughout the known world at the time. Furs and pelts would have been a very tradeable commodity. However it is much more likely that they wore the simple and readily available pelts of the animals of their homeland such as wolves and bears.    It is the ancient equivalent of you wearing a pair of jeans from your local Burtons/topman/whatever, or a pair of designer jeans from the Champs Elysee in Paris. Be honest, what do you have more of in your wardrobe?|`|4S5NnT7aaa	It's possible that they may have acquired some in trade from their contacts in Eastern Europe/Black Sea. The Vikings were around in c.700-1100AD. The Roman Empire had fallen in the west, but continued as the Byzantine Empire in Constantinople until overrun by the Turks in 1453AD, who changed the name to Istanbul. There is actually Viking runic grafitti inside the Church of Saint Sophia (now the Hagia Sophia Mosque) in Istanbul, so they certainly visited the place.  It was a place where you could get rare and exotic stuff, like spices and silk from China, so a few Tiger pelts might not have been too difficult to get, for the right price.|`|KOsGtal8aa	i thought it was bear fur.|`|2vzj65Kfaa	The western Roman empire fell centruies before the coming of the vikings ...    But, the vikings did trade quite far south - the black sea and such.    It is quite possible that they would have lion and tiger furs, however, in my opinion, they probably had plenty of warmer fur from the regions they were in and set about to trading things that they could not so easily obtain.|`|YYbVDcw8aa	They probably had Snow Leopard and Siberian Tiger, being established in Kiev and Novgorod.|`|40c85b996c134163f45223b2c362cd80aa	No, I don't think so.     First all, the Roman empire ended in 476 and the Vikings didn't start raiding until 794, so they missed each by three centuries.      Now, the Byzantines (who are sometimes called the "Eastern Roman Empire") still existed during they Viking Age, but they didn't hold the same territories in Africa (source of lions) that the old Roman empire had.  Also the Byzantines and Persians were traditional enemies, and the Persians guarded the main viable route to India, the only place to find tigers.  However, the Swedish Vikings are known to have traded with *both* the Byzantines and the Persians.       That said, an awful lot is known the Norse (aka "vikings") from archeology and I have never come across a reference to anything that could be identified as either lion or tiger pelts from these digs.  Many, many other furs have been identified including:    Hare, Squirrel, Beaver, Fox, Ermine, Marten, Badger, Wolverine, Otter, Sable, Reindeer, European Elk, Sheep, Goat, Seal, Wolf and Bear.    I personally find it interesting that there are NO felines in the list, even though a species of lynx is native to Scandinavia.  Perhaps the Norse simply didn't like cat fur.    It also seems that the Norse were more interested in metal work to show off wealth and/or superiority.  More common on high status clothing than either embroidery or fur edges are brocaded bands woven with gold or silver.       The berserkers wore bearskins, but then although they were celebrated, they weren't rich or high status.  Also, the berserkers seem to have been an anomoly for wearing the skins fur side out, rather than the most common fur side in.  Various Norse tales indicate that fur was usually used to line hats and garments, and they only wore them fur side out during the silliness of Yule celebrations.    I would venture a guess that the Norse traders abroad might not have been that impressed with furs of any kind since fur was one of the big items they brought *out* of Scandinavia to trade.  Trading one kind of fur for another probably wouldn't have seemed worth it, even if it was an odd yellow or stripey orange!  Trade good that were brought back (and have been found in the archeology) included silks, wine, glass, pottery and metalware.  A little silver Buddha has been even found in Birka (Sweden)!    Finally, I can't recall any mention of a Lion or Tiger pelt in any of the Norse sagas and given how prone they were to bragging about things, I think if somebody had had an exotic fur like that, somebody would have mentioned it.  Instead, we have Sutoneous who writes of a king wearing an ermine vest, Ibn Faln who writes of another Viking leader wearing a fur-lined silk coats with gold claps, the Rigsthula which mentions a high-status bride taking gifs of bear and otterskins to her new husband, etc.    The earliest reference I can think of to "lion" in the Norse language, is from a pair of 13th century translations of the medieval French romances "Tristan" and "Yvain, the Knight of the Lion".  These come nearly 150 years after the Viking Age was over.    As for tigers, I think it's worth pointing out that medieval Europeans, although they knew the word "tiger" (and knew that it was derived from the Persian word for "arrow" because their speed) had no real concept of what they looked like.  Tigers in medieval drawings are shown all kinds of ways, none of which look like a tiger:  a great blue cat with darker blue spots, a kind of leopard with multi-coloured spots, a large blue creature that appears to be a cross between a lion and a wolf, etc.  All of this seems to suggest that no one in Europe during the middle ages (which included the Viking Age) had ever actually seen a tiger or its pelt!|`|iCzMOXOWaa	some probally did as they travelled down through russia into the east,but i dont think it would have been common!just trade really!|`|i77cV7Q0aa	yea  the vikings r = swedens,norwediang,dans|`|y3jD0DDpaa	i think so they traveld alot|`|mLn4YsRMaa	Highly unlikely. Even in the regions where tigers or lions are found, there wouldn't have been many people with the pelts of big cats - as predators, they are rather thin on the ground, and difficult and dangerous to hunt. They would have been far too valuable to trade.     The Vikings never came into contace with the Romans. The Roman Empire collapsed 400 years before the first Viking Raids.    On the extremely slim chance that a pelt might have been traded as far as Northern Europe, it would have been prohibitively expensive. When you consider that a beaver pelt - and the beaver is native to Northern Europe - could cost around 185 grams of silver (approx 2,400 in modern terms), you can imagine how expensive anything more exotic would have been. 1 oz of silk sold for 2 oz of silver, and that was more easily transported than a pelt.    Yes, the rich would have trimmed garments with fur, or perhaps lined a hood, but you're looking at fox, otter, martin, seal, and beaver (only for the very rich). Wolf skins were used occasionally as well.

nEc0L0MRaa	Co-habitation is living with another person, I have four male roommates, we share a living space.   We have meals together, we act like a family at times, but we are not eternally bound to each other.      Marriage is a lifelong commitment to another person, together or separate, good or bad, sick or well, these two people are bound to one another.      A good example of this would be the military.  While serving, people are separated from their families, loved ones, spouses and so on.  That does not invalidate their relationships because they are no longer in the same living space.  And visa verse, sharing a barracks with another person in no way makes them married, they are sharing a living space, for a specific purpose, other than romantic entanglements.    And thank you for at least being honest about the homework help.|`|FI916ISFaa	They are not the same thing.  There is a level of commitment that goes with marriage that is not present with co-habitation.|`|D9lMg7A2aa	IF they were the same you would not have asked the question.|`|mfSp38yzaa	Uh, NO!    Marriage is a committment made in front of witnesses. Cohabitation, while it may have some level of "committment", nothing holds you together (legally or spiritually). There may be a financial deterrence from splitting up, but that's not exactly the same as a conscious decision to be together for life.|`|7NugugsDaa	no not the same thing    1) you get married  2) you co-habitat (live together)    two totally different things|`|urIm4YaBaa	When I first moved to the city I live in, my girlfriend, her roommate (who was also a good friend of mine), and I lived in the same house (her roommate had a different bedroom). We were fresh out of college and, as a result, broke.    I had no intimate involvement with our friend and housemate; I remained committed to my girlfriend at the time, whom I married after our friend was able to move to out.    Living with someone and having a romantic relationship with that person are not the same things.|`|jsD8WaQbaa	If marriage and co-habitation are the same thing, then eggs, flour, sugar and cooking oil in a bowl is the same thing as a cake.    When you two people get married, they agree to function, to a certain degree, as one unit. They will face life's problems, and enjoy life's pleasures, together. Marriage is the "oven" that turns the cake ingredients into a cake.    When two people co-habitate, they live in the same "bowl," but they're never going to be a cake, not in the eyes of the law, or God, or society, or their own souls. They know they can both get out of that bowl any time they want; all they have to do is pack their stuff and walk out the door. There's nothing to hold them together into a cake.|`|dd1c8373d258bab9181f891f88ea8dafaa	One makes the public stand that its an entity apart from the rest, it makes the public announcement of commitment and longevity.     The other does not.     In practice it might be the same, but in actuality it is not.|`|K1iUzewyaa	Don't agree... Marriage is a lifelong committment. Co-habitation is just sometimes convenient. You do not have ties that marriage gives you. You're not obligated to make the relationship work. It's easier to just leave when times get tough. It looks like marriage, but in the end there are no ties that bind eachother for life..|`|io7nHB3Oaa	One involves a formal contract that provides a variety of rights to both parties. They should be the same, but the government and our wonderful legal system love to complicate things.|`|jW0VqZcOaa	Marriage involves a contractual agreement between the two parties in question.    Co-habitating does not.|`|65653c6c063e99db1f7f272c5c93e006aa	No, of course not.    Marriage is the act of entering into a covenant before God and man and makes the couple accountable for their actions regarding the vows they have made, and in my view is only valid when performed in the light of God's ordination.    Any thing else is co-habitation.  Usually embarked upon by the free wheelers of society who do not have the capacity to form a commitment and do not expect to be held accountable for their actions.|`|31M2IDw2aa	No, shackin-up is not the same as the Sacrament of Holy Matrimony.  Only in this age of modernistic depravity could such a question be asked.

People who don't like aa usually don't acknowledge white priviledge in America. They need to blame themselves because if they acted right in the first place this program would never have happened.|`|waeDshbyaa	It helps significantly, by leveling the playing field and making hiring and promotions fair, much like the seniority system, it takes competition out of the equation and makes for a more just workplace.|`|3862H0WVaa	In the long run it will hurt society.  Discrimination is just that no matter how you try to dress it up.     This first happened in Britain as the labour party had women only shortlists for election to parliament.  Some would say that was fine as it put more women into parliament, however these women don't command respect and they actually cause damage to women how have got there by defeating the men fairly and squarely.  No personally I feel it is flawed and can only drive a wedge between groups in society    Equality yes, affirmative action or positive discrimination NO!  Discrimination is just that discrimination.|`|AA10067344	Affirmative Action is just another case of institutionalized discrimination.  Race should not be a factor AT ALL with regard to employment, enrollment, or anything else.  The sooner the lawmakers figure that out, the better off we'll all be.|`|Ar80Ri8eaa	Yes, they are racist policies, they help only certain races.

z74a7wvlaa	Back to the brethren again.= no hebrew word for stepbrothers hence, brethren refers to 1st cousins, stepbro/sis; as in "Am I thy brothers keeper".<br>  <br>  They did NOT. St Joseph and Mary were holy people and they kept their vows to God.<br>  a] In the eastern catholics, St Joseph was a 90 yrs old and only act as guardian to then 15-16 yrs old teenage Mary and a foster father to infant Jesus. St Joseph died in old age.. he was about 112; reason why the bible does not mention about him after the Jesus preaching at age 12 in the temple.<br>  b]  In the Roman Catholic, the brethren are the children of the 'other Mary' which is explicitly clear in the bible.<br>  c] Jesus endorsed His mother to St John when He could leave her to the suppose brother, if He has these other natural siblings. St Mary lived in Ephesus for a while. The site in Ephesus never mentioned of 'alleged other children' = NEVER.<br>  d] The brethen thing is completely UNKNOWN in the eastern catholics; it is a western melodrama; a mega advertising scheme for the love of PROFITS. <br>  So guys, don't get so literal and you can not stretch the brethren thing for so long as it just cannot stand.|`|93galWG1aa	No they remained pure and chaste their whole lives as they dedicated their whole lives to God.|`|cIPziIdnaa	probably|`|F4Wu6JXyaa	The gospel of Matthew implies they did, in Chapter 1:<br>  <br>  24 When Joseph woke up, he did what the angel of the Lord had commanded him and took Mary home as his wife. 25 But he had no union with her until she gave birth to a son. And he gave him the name Jesus.<br>  <br>  That "until" sort of suggests he did have union with her afterwards.  <br>  <br>  Various translations of this agree that Joseph did consummate the union, but only after the birth of Jesus.

(Exodus 31:18)|`|qRFTEBlGaa	Critics of the Bible do not need to point out that mere men wrote this book. The Bible itself honestly informs us of that fact. But what makes this book different from any other book written by men is that the Holy Bible is inspired of God. That is to say, breathed of God, as one of the Bible writers describes it. It was as if God, by an invisible breath, put into the minds of the thirty-nine God-fearing men who composed the Bible what to write and what truths to put on record. This fact makes God the Creator really the Author of this Book. This is not strange. He could create a book just as easily as he could create heaven and earth and the brains in mans head.    The Holy Bible is written in Gods name, Jehovah. Its judgments and laws are pronounced in his name. Its prophets are sent in his name, and their prophecies are declared over his name and written with his name as a signature of guarantee. The Bible does credit to Gods name. What other book tells us so much about this God the Creator? What other book describes him so fully or presents him so vividly? He is not a god set out in unhistorical, undatable mythologies and unreasonable religious traditions that are the product of mans imaginations. He is a God tied in directly with human history from mans very start till now, for He is mans Creator. He has nothing to do with myths or religious mythologies. As a living God, he weaves his speeches, his prophecies, his deeds and his course of action right in with dated, true-life history of mankind, and gives his attention, not to just his chosen servants or people, but also to nations, not excluding a single nation today.|`|aUVB29lmaa	God inspired the apostles to write the Bible.|`|AA11615514	It wasn't Jesus' role to be an author. He was sent by God to be a teacher. God guided men to write The Bible for Him.|`|fc201279b728cf66cb3edc5fb588f42eaa	He did write it himself indirectly you could say. The Old Testament was written by prophets who were receiving visions and the word of God. Therefore, through God it was written. How do we know these men were really receiving the word of God you ask?     Various tests by which scripture was determined to be God inspired:  a. The book had to have been written by a prophet of God, in which it was then the Word of God.  b. Was the writer confirmed by acts of God? Prophesy fulfillment or supernatural acts would have to be witnessed to separate true prophets from false prophets.  c. Was the message telling the truth of God? Does the message contradict itself? If so, it was thrown out because God cannot contradict himself.  d. Does it come with the power of God? If a scripture was truly God-inspired it would have a transforming force on those who preached it and heard it. The power to change lives.  e. Acceptance from the people of God. Believers of God who personally witnessed and knew the prophets would confirm the scriptures.    With Jesus (Son of God), the witnesses of His life wrote the New Testament. So in a way, God and Jesus did write the bible and an indirect way.|`|RfOLqUKlaa	Neither of them was willing to pay the agent's fees|`|xfYUxKmvaa	God did write it.|`|mrzeXJ6Eaa	It's the same answer as this joke:    Two older men were playing checkers and one accused his buddy of cheating. His buddy said, "If I cheated, may God strike me down!" The man hit his buddy so hard he flew off of the porch. "What did you do that for?"    "God uses his servants."    2 Timothy 3:16  All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness,    2 Peter 1:20-21  Above all, you must understand that no prophecy of Scripture came about by the prophet's own interpretation.  (21)  For prophecy never had its origin in the will of man, but men spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit.|`|xo4iux9gaa	He did...|`|Nu6vDwLtaa	possibly cos god told the men to do it.  man heard voices.  if a man today hears voice he is considered mentally ill.  the bible is a book of accounts supposedly written by what was seen or heard.  each account is contradictory and cannot stand up to tests and cross examination.    if god, or jesus had written the bible, and gave the book to man and said "this is how it will be" then world will be a better place and the word of god would not be confusing or contradictory.  however it wasnt so and so gods word in my opinion is a complete fable.|`|lAMdAKmzaa	Not necessary.

WMrNa3Doaa	It seems that God only likes men with shotguns, jacked-up pickup trucks, mullets and strange facial hair.

It is human nature to call God a liar; just like Satan's nature. Satan's tasks are sometimes designed to try to make God out to be a liar, mankind was infected with that nature at the fall of Adam.<br>  <br>  So violence was natural for some people.

In that religion, the emperor was the divine incarnation, the son of god (Jupiter), so to claim that somebody else was the son of god was a crime.|`|P1Sl55Coaa	Because the Bible and Jesus said they would, and people hate the truth.

cIZS6Wr2aa	Anything to do with witch craft, no matter what color she is (wink) is an abomination before the Lord and forbidden in the bible.<br>  <br>  PS - Anyone who needs to cast a spell on a person to make them love them sounds a little desparate to me.|`|bgA9wLD0aa	it depends on the intent.  a good love spell is about drawing positive energies, not a specific person.  the purpose of it is to prepare the target of the spell to be open to love, not to manipulate another person.|`|qHoWraAaaa	Ethical my butt!  It's flat out witchcraft no matter what color you put on it and it goes against the ordinances of God.  In this situation, if you ask Christ what He would do, I am positive that the resounding answer to your heart would be to rebuke that witch with the full authority which was given you by Christ!  God Bless!|`|21808938a2c954ea0389683f10267c69aa	Depends what she means by a "love spell."  A spell to merely "attact love" as you say in your title is generally considered ethical.  The goal is to bring love into your life, not bend the will of any particular person.  If it's targetting a specific person, it generally is seen as interfering with free will and is thus either impossible or unethical.  <br>  <br>  Some (a minority in my experience) consider it ethical to target a particular person because they expect the result to be a simple nudge in a direction, no more influencing than, say, wearing an attractive outfit or an alluring perfume.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.|`|Jsqlkb3caa	My definition of an ethical love spell: A spell that does not negatively manipulate people so that you can win the object of your affection. Anything that alters a persons "free will" in unethical. Spells designed to "Make her love me!", or "Make him come back to me!" force someone to do your bidding. That's wrong, be it through magical or mundane methods. <br>  Love spells at I consider ethical..things that make the *caster* feel better about themselves. Spells to increase confidence, make you feel more attractive. Or spells that help you find someone with a certain set characteristics. Spells that open your eyes to the things around you, make you take notice, and help you find "Mr/Mrs. Right". They don't bring you a specific person, but instead bring you the person you are intended to me with. <br>  I hope this help you. And I also wanted to thank you for a kind question that was very respectfully written. Bright blessings!<br>  <br>  Edit: What the heck did I get a thumbs down for? Ah well...|`|HVY2rqzfaa	I don't actually believe that spells work, but for the sake of this argument I will assume they do exist<br>  <br>  No. You are using unfair means to bring someone over to your side which takes away their element of choice (ie not falling in love with you). Would hypnotizing someone and then making them have sex with you be fair? No...|`|cjWrSpfYaa	You must remember that Wicca is a religion with it's own guide lines.  That being said, there are many, many more forms of magickal practices out there.  Ethical?  It depends where you are coming from and what the intent is, but for the most part I would say it is fine, simply because anyone that truly understands magick will also understand that the Universe (or God if you may) will not allow anything to happen that could not naturally happen anyway.  Just think of magick as a probability modifyer, increasing the odds of a desired effect, if that person did not contain the possability of being  attracted to you to begin with (either for your physical looks or inner beauty) , their free will will not allow it to happen.  You can think of magick as some other attribute you can use to attract someone, for example, getting a new haircut, putting on some perfume or wearing something sexy.|`|yqKlmaD1aa	From a magical perspective, it would depend on the mechanics of the spell.  One that seeks to act on others would be unethical (bringing them to you).  One that seeks to change you by making yourself more open, etc would be ethical.<br>  <br>  That said, I am a proponent that magic is a last resort, not a first option.  It should also be used complimentary, i.e. together with more mundane activities (going to singles nights, getting out and about, personals and all of that.)|`|uLHCY6Qmaa	I'm an atheist, but I understand Wicca well. I know a lot about earth-based pagan religions.<br>  I'm thinking that your neighbor speaks of a "general" love spell, that simply puts one out there to attract love vibes. You know, "I'm single and would like to attract someone". I think that it would be unethical to cast a love spell toward a specific person, unless this person has already revealed some of his/her thoughts regarding their friendship.<br>  Auntie Kookoo|`|Hb6Ifwa6aa	Look it, some people are so unattractive, that a love spell to make them appear more attractive so as to get some kind of interest is pretty much a last resort, it has nothing to do with ethics, just desperation, LOL!!!  Oh, I'm sorry, did I appear to be unkind in my answer?  Maybe I'll put a spell on all of you so that my answer appears heartfelt and kind....|`|ESS4ltRYaa	Im new here but I HAVE to answer this ?. My brothers girlfriend told me that she did a love spell about 2 weeks before she met him. She also said she did it so that person would stay with her. Well, needless to say, my poor unknowing brother has been stuck with this.....girl (i guess thats what we'll call her) for about 5 years now. He wont leave her and shes just a mooch. The whole family doesn't like her and he just wont get away from her. I've also learned that you NEVER do a spell on another person without thier consent. I dont know if this falls into that catagory or not but I so dont agree with this spell at all.|`|V9N3R0T1aa	I don't think it would be ethical at all.|`|2Rk3FvFbaa	The ethical dilema of Love Spells is the focal point to which you are directing them. A general spell to attract a compatable mate or friend to you would have to use yourself as a focal point, you are simply increasing your chances of meeting someone whom you would find fun and interesting. These people are out there but they may be too busy to notice you or may be distracted by other forces. The ethics involved here are personal. <br>   However, if you are casting a spell on a specific person in order to alter their feelings towards you then that is plain unethical. True love comes only through free will anyways, but some power hungery/starved people may resort to this kind of "rape" to attract a mate. The person is most likely not compatable and had no intention of delving into a relationship but are compelled to intitiate one. Only those with no morals and a poor upbringing would resort to this. <br>   I hope this has been helpful.
K5nwQfnjaa	When the feeling to do it comes you have to do it.    Its unexplainable, its a magnetism, it compells you to write, that happens to some people.    I found once I wrote once, I just kept going and can't stop.    I think its a great thing!|`|Qvc0tVOnaa	You can post as much as you want!    I don't like poetry!     I think it depends on people mood!|`|sE94HgDBaa	I don't write poetry, I'm not a good writer.  If I was I'm sure the negative emotions would be most inspiring.  I can bleed out the negative emotions onto a paper and keep the positive emotions inside me.

ZYUpEdcqaa	Exactly.  I don't want everyone wearing black at my funeral and crying and everything.  I want it to be a celebration of my life.  And like when people get older, on their birthday they are always cranky and super sensitive like my dad was on his 40th.  I would happy that I have lived a good long life and that it was prosperous and I would be proud of how much I have done and accomplished.  I think people have it backwards.  I don't want to meet God yet because I still want to hang out here for a little bit longer and do my best to show other Jesus.  btw, laughing at your x was unchristian like.  Not to sound annoying, I am being serious; what would Jesus have done?  Now, he also wouldn't have divorced, but there is no need to be unpleasant (mean) with someone you don't like.  If i don't like someone at school, I am still nice to them; I just don't associate with them.  If they ask for a pencil, I let them borrow one or if they need paper or ask me a question.  It's what God would do.  Treat others the way you want to be treated.  Even if i hated you, I wouldn't laugh at you for wearing a neck brace.  I would be worried.|`|A01w1dHqaa	Al is not his body and neither are you. You are mind. And all of mind is connected, but we only connect when we have something to learn or teach.|`|FpMS47sXaa	I agree.    I do not see death as a sad occasion. I am only sad because of my own selfishness. I rejoice when people pass. They are continuing on their journey.|`|d7c8ecd624fbbc0797b1502ba6682e8baa	If anyone actually believed in heaven, they would neither be sad when someone else dies nor fight too hard to maintain their own life. The fact that neither of these is the case is evidence enough that no such belief exists.|`|Sx6vlEUbaa	Your story is nice but it is not truth. All who die simply are dead until they are resurrected. My brother was murdered at age 12. He is in his grave today and will be resurrected at the appointed day. This truth also sees death in a positive way and the best part is - it's the truth.    Think on this- God created Adam from dust. What is the big deal in raising our dust from the Earth? In death we simply have no consciousness of time. Whenever someone dies, their next waking moment is a resurrection.|`|uFAoq4idaa	You are right again. If only all people here will accept the truth that God loves them then all will be happy to face death. Death is peace with God. He gives hope for every believer. He said that He had already prepared Paradise for those who believe. Hi friends welcome to Paradise!|`|ZasNwdXaaa	Flesh life is jail. To die, is to be released from jail.

But anyway, why dont you enjoy life and stop hoping it continues?  What if it doesnt?  Should would have a lot of stuff to regret, eh?|`|zmVCqh7Daa	Good point. But I have to say, when Al died, he didn't go to heaven. He didn't go anywhere. He was dead in the grave.     God bless.|`|a9etFur6aa	Well, sure. If you want. Alternatively, some people go to hell though (of course I'm pretty sure children are exempt). Not always a positive experience.
5pB2QAPUaa	No.<br>  'God is Love' (1John 4:8), and it would not be fair for anyone to be tortured for all eternity for what he did in 60-0 years on earth. Here are some things to think about:<br>  <br>  1. In the original languages, sheol nad hades simply refer to the grave.<br>  <br>  2. Jesus was in hell for parts of 3 days. (Acts 2:25-28) Why would the perfect and righteous Son of God be tortured in hellfire?<br>  <br>  3.  'For the wages sin pays is death, but the gift God gives is everlasting life by Christ Jesus our Lord' (Romans 6:23).<br>  <br>  The scriptures always make sense if we do not read into them. If anyone would like to read more, please get the book 'What Does the Bible Really Teach', from Jehovah's Witnesses.|`|VYLEfiSTaa	The religious clergy of Christendom have made God’s name stink to the high heavens throughout the whole earth. They know, or should know by reason of their theological education, that the Holy Bible sets forth God’s name as being Jehovah. Over the centuries these clergymen have taught that this God of the Bible is a God who delights in eternal torture of his own creatures, that He prepared a place called “hell” filled with fire burning forever with brimstone (or sulphur), and that there he keeps alive sinful human souls after death to be tormented forever, without any relief. The clergy twist the meaning of things said in the Bible in order to teach this, and to this day they have never erased this teaching from their church creeds, thus declaring it to be absolutely false and a God-dishonoring, demon-inspired teaching. They do not want to admit to teaching lies.|`|q6H2ru3waa	We harm ourselves when we continue living in sin.|`|gGmMw2vDaa	Does your us include people who do not like your fairy?|`|hIaBgCrgaa	God Jehovah does not harm anyone. People harm themselves by doing things that are low which tarnishes their spirit. When we die it is our sins that weigh us down and cause us to sink to the underworld. It is through God and his son that forgiveness is given to raise our spirits back up.<br>  That is only possible through recognition of mistakes made and asking God for forgiveness.<br>  It is true that our world has turned to sin and is fading fast but it is happening to prepare a new Earth when it is reborn again. It is part of the natural cycle of the Earth. <br>  <br>  I will quote Merlin from the movie Excalibur "The world is ending, the One True God is returning to chase all the other gods away"<br>  <br>  We as humans cannot hold the earth together no matter how hard we try because the world is held together through God El Jehovah's magic.<br>  <br>  God Bless All Life!|`|UtE4QdBraa	G-d doesn't want to harm us, but he can't accept us into heaven if we die in our sin and don't receive Jesus into our hearts.<br>  <br>  And why would the devil want to make us think that G-d would punish us? How does that affect him and wouldn't that just make us try to be better people. <br>  If anything the devil wants to make us think there is no hell.|`|37LKDbtsaa	Does Hell ring a bell? Is that "hurting us, because he loves us"-sort of thing?|`|gBoUrlrKaa	Oh, burning us forever for not believing in him is love?<br>  <br>  Well I should start burning people I love then. Got a match?|`|CDsLUCXUaa	think about being alive never mind when we're dead|`|sVyH0jTiaa	Satan is smiley now because he has fooled them all over the world.<br>  Actually , you don't get burn in hell because you going back to the dirt like what Jehovah God told Adam after he disobeyed.<br>  please keep reading Bible.|`|tx4bRDrXaa	(2 Corinthians 11:14-15) And no wonder, for Satan himself keeps transforming himself into an angel of light. 15?It is therefore nothing great if his ministers also keep transforming themselves into ministers of righteousness. But their end shall be according to their works.<br>  <br>  So they try to teach the manmade doctrine of  hellfire when.No where in the scriptures does it teach us that Satan is stoking the fires of hell,rather it tells us he will be destroyed in the lake of fire which means the second death.(Revelation 20:14) And death and Ha′des were hurled into the lake of fire. This means the second death, the lake of fire.<br>  <br>  And the dead know nothing at all.
9pXeC0EGaa	Like I said earlier. Christian logic is a little bit like sh!t on a hot day. Somewhere along the lines it served it's purpose...but now, it just stinks.|`|v93T1z2Aaa	Yes, we are not. We are his creations not sons. If we are his sons then  Human, Jinns, Angels, Animals are his sons. <br>  <br>  You have to bear in mind that Allah has created Jinn and us to worship him and he did created Animals and other things to think well that these thing won't be found but there is a God created them.<br>  <br>  He created all humans from clay<br>  He created all Jinns from Fire<br>  He created all angles from Light <br>  He created all animals from water.|`|O9WVH9yhaa	No, how could that be?  We'd *all* have to be God's children.  Even the nasty ones.  We just have to accept Jesus Christ as our savior, and all is forgotten. <br>  <br>  What's more disturbing is why God produces purely sinners.  I don't get why He would?  It doesn't make sense.  Babies are born good.  And we all would be of God if you believe in him.|`|r4cThgwdaa	But according to the xtians holy book their god created everything including Satan|`|q0LMxKcjaa	In the Garden of Eden, Adam and Eve were created perfect.  But when the serpent (Satan) tempted them to eat the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, which God had told them NOT to eat ...well that was disobedience to God and that is SIN.  Before that sin, they had a perfect RELATIONSHIP with God.  But that sin separated them from God.  The spiritual part of man died that day, and sin entered into the heart of all mankind.  God gave man a choice to obey Him or not....and they chose "not."  God gives man a choice to love Him or not also.  He didn't want  a family that was "made" to love Him.  How awful that would be.  So He gives us the choice.  <br>    His Son Jesus willingly left all the glory of heaven to take on a human body...to come and live among us to show us who God is...how much he loves us.  Jesus is God in the flesh.  God says we're either for Him or against Him.  And if we're against Him....we're FOR Satan.  <br>     In John 8:42- 44 it says. (New Living Translation Bible) "Jesus said to them, "If God were your Father, you would love Me, for I proceeded forth and came from God; nor have I come of Myself, but He sent Me.  Why do you not understand My speech?  Because you are not able to listen to My word.  YOU ARE OF YOUR FATHER THE DEVIL, and the desires of your father you want to do.  He was a murderer from the beginning and does not stand in the truth, because there is no truth in him.  When he speaks a lie, he speaks from his own resources, for HE IS A LIAR AND THE FATHER OF IT.  But because I tell the truth, you do not believe Me.  Which of you convicts Me of sin?  And if I tell the truth, why do you not believe Me?  HE WHO IS OF GOD HEARS GOD'S WORDS; THEREFORE YOU DO NOT HEAR, BECAUSE YOU ARE NOT OF GOD.<br>  <br>  But there is great HOPE.....John 3:16-17 says, "For God so loved the world (that includes you), that He gave His one and only Son, that whosoever believes in Him, will not perish but have everlasting life.  For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world, through Him, might be saved.<br>  <br>  The Bible says that all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God.  If you break even one of God's commandments you have sinned.<br>  (If you lie....that is sin!)  You see we're all sinners....but God made a way for us to restore our relationship with Him and that is through the death, burial, and resurrection of His Son, Jesus.  If you will confess that you are a sinner, believe in your heart that Jesus Christ is God's Son and that He died for your sins, and ask Him to forgive you and invite Him to be your Lord and Savior....YOU WILL BE SAVED.  You must repent of your sins which means turn from them...yes, you will still sin...but YOU WON'T WANT TO.  You'll want to live a life that pleases God, your Father.  He promises to never leave you or forsake you.  He gives you His Holy Spirit to live inside you to help you live a Christian life...I have been a Christian for over 30 years and let me tell you.....God is real...He loves you so much and wants to help you live a life for Him...to tell others about His love.  NO ONE.....NO ONE loves you like God does.  He know the # of hairs on your head...His thoughts about you are more than the grains of sand in the sea.  I pray that your heart will be receptive to what I have told you.  Hell is real and God doesn't want anyone to go there but if you choose not to accept His Son Jesus and what He has done for you....then you CHOOSE HELL....a place of eternal fire and suffering...the worst part is being separated from God.<br>  <br>  Please think about it.|`|q6H2ru3waa	We were all born in sin.  you have to be born again in the spirit to become a child of God.|`|93galWG1aa	No Satan can not create life, it means that you serve Satan rather than God you make him your Father your master etc.|`|a7364c50b7e6712ee3c77218a3232b45aa	All along the same load of b*ll*cks as not towing the line at the Stepford Country Club - wear the right clothes and smile and you're in, question (involves thought) and sow the seeds of doubt and you're out.<br>  <br>  The price to be paid for undermining the Great Allegiance (by boring holes and creating chinks in the fabric of the building, thus putting it at risk of crumbling and falling, leaving those previously protected out in the cold stark harsh reality) is that convenient hole in the floor from where those who are disloyal are dropped into the arms of Satan.<br>  <br>  God didn't create man, man created God and the whole implausible storyline.|`|yzRHAWNhaa	No God creates but satan steals.<br>  <br>  Ro:8:9: But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you.

QX2fP3Cbaa	good luck. when you find him let me know|`|XyIOD5Olaa	God is a human concept.  A concept created and sustained by humans.  Therefore, you can "find god" in your own mind.  Just continue to learn and spend some quiet time alone, developing an understanding of what you've learned, incorporating your ethics and values.  Once you do that, you will "find" (define) god in the way that not only serves you best, but also in the way that will help you lead a rewarding, happy life.  God is in your mind, not in your heart, not in a faith.  Don't buy the cliches.  You define god.|`|FOzN3xwzaa	Jesus is God, and He loves you so very much!  :) <br>  <br>  Salvation is a FREE GIFT that happens in a split second when you believe in Jesus! It is impossible to lose or "leave" salvation. <br>  <br>  The truth about Jesus is that the only way to be saved and to get into heaven and avoid being sent to eternal hell, is by believing in faith alone that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for all our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Believe this and you will be in heaven, no matter what! <br>  <br>  Please pray now: "Jesus, please forgive me of my sins. I believe that You died on the cross for my sins and You rose from the dead. Thank You for eternal life!"

So looking inward is the most direct a connection one can make. <br>  <br>  But if you want to learn about God, I suggest you start by reading Love Without Conditions by Paul Ferrini. <br>  <br>  Finding God is not a one step process, nor is understanding God and God's intentions for you in your life.

The professor did not say he was gay in the article , that i read, and neither did Mr. Lopez. SO they both are butting in were they don't belong. The professor does not have a right to tell anyone that what they FEEL is wrong. I do agree that the student should not have used his classroom as a soapbox unless the speech required it. He did not violate his free speech rights because it is a school. It was not a christian school and it was not a religious studies class. So if my boss asks for a report on the upcoming events that will bring in a lot of room nights to my hotel and I give him a report on gay marriage he would not violate my right to free speech because that is not what he asked for. Now if this child's paper was on gay marriage and the paper was supposed to about your faith or gay marriage then the story changes. Free speech is there so you can go in the street and say what you want or print your own literature saying what you want to say. But you can not take a biology class and then read a paper on intelligent design. If he wants to go out and say what he wants in public that is fine, but he was not in public he was in a classroom with an agenda. And if that agenda is not being met the teacher has the right to tell his students to be quiet. How he did it and the words he used I agree are not the best choice, especially for a teacher. But the fact of the matter is, that is his class and he will teach it the way he wants. If you don't like that or want it tought a different way then go to a christian school. (Babel)|`|y1KcxJ7Oaa	I think it depends on what Lopez, the student, was reciting from the bible.  If he was reciting Leviticus, and exclaiming that all homosexuals should be put to death then the teacher was within his rights to stop the speech.  Current anti-terrorism laws are in place to protect all people, including homosexuals, from hate crimes and acts of terrorism such as was witnessed in Sodom and Gomorrah.  I'm sure the professor would have stopped Lopez if he was a Neo-Nazi citing the bible to promote racism and anti-Semitism. But this is a speech class, and the teacher's job is to educate all career public speakers on Speech form, even racists and homophobics. So the teacher was in error and the student, Lopez, should get a refund for the class.|`|jdRKZe18aa	A good example of WHAT exactly?  cuz no... it's a pretty POOR example of those who only want free speech if it AGREES with their own views....<br>  <br>  Pretty sad if ya ask me!|`|um9W8Dy8aa	How tolerant of dissent from their views these "liberals" are!<br>  I think that the professor is the facist<br>  <br>  but will Matteson even be disciplined?<br>  <br>  If such dangerously infantile behaviour were to be done   by one opposing same-sex"marriage" in this context ,he would have been quickly vilified and fired|`|dmCAiuMGaa	It's a great example of someone who hates people to express opposing opinions.<br>  <br>  (See also Secksay.)<br>  <br>  EDIT: It also begs the question, where is the ACLU to protect the student's free speech, and why didn't they complain about the professor's actions?|`|89MKzLl3aa	The professor was the one who made a jerk of himself.

Collectively, these logics are known as "paraconsistent" or "inconsistency-tolerant" logics.

PYIA2FCFaa	i drink almost every weekend lol.|`|VU4DLpnlaa	when most people talk about getting drunk they mean throwing up and fighting etc. there's nothing wrong with having a drink but when you get drunk it's dangerous, not only due to how stupid it makes you but because the reason you feel that way is cos your body can't pump out the poison fast enough, doing that every week is stupid. i stick to 1 glass of red every night and i'm fine. i used to be an alcoholic and before that i'd binge on weekend. which is where the problems come from.|`|EpqSDAGyaa	Why get drunk?

zZxX5PXBaa	I think the problem here is a tendency among Christians to underplay what it means to be 'carnally minded'.<br>  <br>  If you look at the wider context, in Romans 8 ..<br>  <br>   For to be carnally minded is death; but to be spiritually minded is life and peace.<br>  <br>   Because the carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.<br>  <br>  This is perhaps Paul's classic definition of the unbelieving heart or mind. It's that direct enmity against God which breaks out in violence against those who are made in his image, right from Genesis 4 onwards. It's the enmity which reveals itself in the constant desire of the Pharisees to kill Jesus. It reveals itself above all when, finally, human beings do get their hands on Christ ... they torture him to death.<br>  <br>  Most Christians distance themselves from this by saying something lilke 'I'm not violent, I've never killed or injured or tortured anyone' ... and this is self-deception. Essentially the same self-deception we find in non-Christians. In the American church, for instance, Christians seem to distance themselves from the behaviour of their nation in the wider world, from its massive military budget, from it's trampling on the sovereignty of nations around the world, from its support of brutal dictatorships and violent actions on the part of its allies, from its  torture programmes ... but the church is implicated in this, is called to be salt and light in a corrupt, violent, fallen world.<br>  <br>  Seen in that light, there is no way that the American church, for example, can possibly take carnality seriously.<br>  <br>  What it does instead is transfer it into the private realm of individual spirituality, or personal piety, and redefine it, referring it to things like sexual temptation, materialism.<br>  <br>  If you look at the wider context in Romans 8, you see that Paul is dividing the world into two fundamentally different, separate camps, those in whom Christ dwells by his Spirit, and those who still follow the ways of the corrupt world. If Christ truly indwells you, you cannot be carnally minded, not in the sense in which Paul discusses it. It's a physical impossibility. If you are carnally minded, then, it simply shows that whatever you profess, you don't belong to Christ.<br>  <br>  This is the reason why so many Christians outside the US, and many within it I might add, have come to the conclusion that the American church, and evangelicalism in particular, is apostate, is a false church led by false teachers. You have taken the gospel out of the world and placed into an artificial private realm, where its impact on the character of your society is irrelevant to you.<br>  <br>  Put simply, you can't belong to Christ and support torture, the killing of innocent Arabs to provide you with cheap oil, the invasion of other countries on lying pretexts, or the use of allies such as Israel to crush women and children in Gaza ... it simply doesn't compute.<br>  <br>  But facing that fact would be costly, so your teachers and preachers don't do it, and the few who do (Jack Nelson Pallmeyer would be an example) are scorned.<br>  <br>  Many religions outside of Christ take 'the sins of the flesh' seriously, and are strict on issues such as sexual morality, or attachment to material things. That sort of strictness actually has little or nothing to do with opposing carnality, it can in fact be utterly carnal. It is not a mark of belonging to Christ.<br>  <br>  Look at what your bible actually says, and focus your sights on the carnal mind which is enmity towards God, and consider how, according to the bible, that is characteristically evidenced. The bible is clear, carnality is characteristically evidenced in violence. And America is a nation steeped in it, and determined to export it to the whole world. Those who belong to Christ are doing something about that ... the rest is pure diversion.|`|AA11124121	if they are carnal in their hearts..they love things of this earth..not christian.|`|q6H2ru3waa	They are unstable in their ways, not serving God wholeheartedly.|`|N8wutNoLaa	"I can do whatever I like, Jesus will forgive me!"<br>  <br>  The attitude bothers me too.

dFBccLExaa	The best way to get into Wicca is to read read read read read and then read some more. Pick up books, flip through forums and websites, etc. The more knowledge you gain, the better off you'll be.   The best book I've found to start off with is "Wicca: A Guide for the Solitary Practitioner" by Scott Cunningham. Has a lot of useful info in it.   A general overview of the religion is that Wicca is a earth based religion- the earth plays a big role within the practice. It is usually polytheistic, and some of the followers of Wicca practice magick, but not all. It promotes duality and balance, and believes in the threefold rule and the wiccan rede. They're big on not harming others.   If you have any other questions, feel free to email me.|`|Tvc6Tmz5aa	I would suggest Wicca: A Guide for the Solitary Practitioner by Scott Cunningham. The book is a bit dated but still very down to Earth as far as explaining our faith and practices. There is a sample of a dedication ritual should you decide to take it a step further.  Animism is a philosophical, religious or spiritual idea that souls or spirits exist in humans, animals, plants or other entities.[3] Animism may also attribute souls to natural phenomena, geographic features, and metaphors in mythology. Religions which emphasize animism in this sense include Shinto, Hinduism and pagan faiths such as folk religions, Neopaganism, among countless others. Throughout European history, philosophers such as Plato, Aristotle, Thomas Acquinas, among others, contemplated the possibility that souls exist in animals, plants and people. The animist idea that souls exist in all mentioned forms of life is also a central concept in the various forms of Shamanism.

Since the actions of the serpent did not match any of the actions or personality of Jesus. <br>  <br>  Jesus had to be sinless; helping to get mankind kicked out of Eden, I suspect, would sort of eliminate the part about Jesus being without Sin.<br>  <br>  However, I can see how some could potentially make the argument that the serpent was really the “unappreciated good guy”.   For the serpent freed us from being “forced” to serve God.  Thus, in that respect, being our “savior” from the days we were “trapped” in Eden.  But Jesus, the serpent was not.<br>  <br>  Personally I would just assume not “lookup to” an entity that not only tells, lies and half-truths but ENJOYS telling the lies, half-truths, etc. simply for the joy of watching others fall (or simply to get what it wants).<br>  <br>  Call the serpent any name you like, but Jesus Christ Our Lord and Savior it was not.<br>  <br>  May Our Creator watch over you and your family.|`|3uaamLcGaa	There is one minute flaw with that hypothesis.<br>  <br>  Why would Jesus, who is one with God the Father and who knew no sin, tempt Eve to do something that was outside the will of God?|`|4KehaECbaa	Then he wouldnt have been Christ.|`|tXrtRFoNaa	here is the true story of Christ : Julius Ceaser was born around 30 bc his mom gave birth to him by C-section, once Ceaser rose to power on of his 12 senators, Brutus, betrayed him a tricked him to go to a special metting where he was stabbed to death : by way of word of mouth this story evolved into the story of Jesus.

Oh my, Suzie - I don't believe I'm answering this but I have certainly learned of something new today.loll & loll.<br>  <br>  My husband and I are laughing too much about this.<br>  <br>  Seriously - If that is the case we must all buy a rabbit's foot for luck'<br>  <br>  BUT - It can't be just any rabbit foot. <br>  <br>  Wikipedia defines the right rabbit foot to buy for luck. <br>  ~~~~<br>  First, not any foot from a rabbit will do: it is the left hind foot of a rabbit that is useful as a charm. <br>  Second, not any left hind foot of a rabbit will do; the rabbit must have been shot or otherwise captured in a cemetery. <br>  Third, at least according to some sources, not any left hind foot of a rabbit shot in a cemetery will do: the phase of the moon is also important. Some authorities say that the rabbit must be taken in the full moon, while others hold instead that the rabbit must be taken in the new moon. Some sources say instead that the rabbit must be taken on a Friday, or a rainy Friday, or Friday the 13th. Some sources say that the rabbit should be shot with a silver bullet.<br>  <br>  So - if the trolls buy their thing and we buy our lucky rabbit's foot - we will live here on answers - happily ever after.

He said that rampant meant " marked by a menacing wildness, extravagance of absence of restraint. ". Now, I think that I know what rabbit means. I ate one fried for breakfast last week. Out here, where I live, Cottontails really don't strike me as rampant. Now, Jackrabbits might come closer to being rampant in that sense and especially when a hungry coyote or dog flushes them out of the brush. When I consider that they might be sexually frustrated that just totally disqualifies all of the rabbits out here, both Cottontails and Jackrabbits, cause with all of the rabbits out here, up and down the roads and in the pastures and out in the fields at night, I really don't see how even one of them could claim to be sexually frustrated. In fact I think that all of them must be pretty happy, sexually speaking.

You might as well say 5+5=11.  It simply can't be true.<br>  <br>  This isn't meant to insult all Christians.

The ones who follow the example of Jesus without trotting out all that hellfire stuff (and there are a lot of them) are good people, because Jesus was a great person who is worth emulating.

Genesis 1:1 The earth is created before light and stars, birds and whales before reptiles and insects, and flowering plants before any animals.  From science, we know that the true order of events was just the opposite.<br>  <br>  2) “And God said, Let there be light” (Genesis 1:3) and “. . .And the evening and the morning were the first day” (Genesis 1 :5), versus “And God said, ‘Let there be light in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night....’ “And God made two lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also…  And the evening and morning were the fourth day” (Genesis 1 :14-19).  These violates two major facts.  Light cannot exist without a sun, and secondly, how can morning be distinguished from evening unless there is a sun and moon?  Christians try to claim that god is the light he is referring to yet, considering the context it is quite obvious that the light god is speaking of is the light emitted by the sun.  Just another feeble attempt at trying to rationalize such a MAJOR blunder.<br>  <br>  3) God spends one-sixth of his entire creative effort (the second day) working on a solid firmament (Genesis 1:6-8).  This strange structure, which God calls heaven, is intended to separate the higher waters from the lower waters.  This firmament, if it existed, would have been quite an obstacle to our space program.<br>  <br>  4) Plants are made on the third day (Genesis 1:11) before there was a sun to drive their photosynthetic processes (Genesis 1:14-19).<br>  <br>  5) “And God said, ‘Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind…  ‘And the evening and the morning were the third day” (Genesis 1:11-13), versus “And God said, ‘Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life…  And God created - great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly…  And the evening and the morning were the fifth day” (Genesis 1:20-23).  Genesis says that life existed first on the land as plants and later the seas teemed with living creatures.  Geological science can prove that the sea teemed with animals and vegetable life long before vegetation and life appeared on land.<br>  <br>  6) “And God said, ‘Let the water bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life, and fowl that may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven” (Genesis 1:20).  Birds did not emerge from water.<br>  <br>  7) "And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, the beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so.  And God made…every thing that creepth upon the earth after his kind…" (Genesis 1:24-25).  Science contends that reptiles were created long before mammals, not simultaneously.  While reptiles existed in the Carboniferous Age, mammals did not appear until the close of the Reptilian Age.<br>  <br>  8) “So God created man in his own image,...male and female created he them” (Genesis 1:27), and “the evening and the morning were the sixth day” (Genesis 1:31). If Adam was created on the 6th day, approximately 6,000 years ago (Bishop Usher’s calculations), then nobody lived before 4,000 B.C. Prehistoric men would be fictitious.  By tracing the genealogy of Jesus back 77 generations to Adam, the third chapter of Luke also supports belief in a very young earth.  If each man had lived approximately 100 years, then the world would be no more than 9,684 (7,700 + 1984) years old.  If each of Jesus’ ancestors had lived to be 1,000 years old (an age not even reached by Methuselah), the earth would still be only 78,984 (77,000 + 1984) years old, according to creationists.<br>  <br>  9) “And to every beast of the earth, and every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth wherein there is life, I have given every green herb for meat: and it was so” (Genesis 1:30).  Carnivorous beasts and fowl do not eat green herbs, nor were all animals originally herbivores. Simply consider tapeworms, vampire bats, mosquitoes, barracudas, tigers, etc.<br>  <br>  10) In Genesis 1, the entire creation takes 6 days (Genesis 1:31), at the end of which the earth and its living things are pretty much as they are today.  But we know from modern science that the universe (including the earth and life on earth) evolved slowly over billions of years.<br>  <br>  11) In Genesis 2:7 humans are created instantaneously from dust and breath, whereas they actually evolved over millions of years from simpler life forms.  Science can in fact trace back human evolution CONCLUSIVELY 3 .2 million years.<br>  <br>  12) God makes the animals (Genesis 2:18) and parades them before Adam to see if any would strike his fancy.  But none seem to have what it takes to please him.  After making the animals, God has Adam name them all.  The naming of several million species must have kept Adam busy for a while, why Adam would still have to be living for we haven’t even discovered nor named all the species.  Also consider the idea of every living creature being brought to the Middle East, that would have killed many animals due to climatic changes.<br>  <br>  13) God curses the serpent, making him crawl on his belly and eat dust (Genesis 3:14).  One wonders how he got around before -- by hopping on his tail, perhaps?  But snakes don’t eat dust, do they?<br>  <br>  14) “There were giants in the earth in those days.” Genesis 6:4 But there is no archaeological evidence for the existence of these giants.  Also there is a reference to the “Nephilim” being on the earth.  Which is a term used for half angel, half human.  Why is there no archaeological evidence for the existence of the Nephilim either?<br>  <br>  15) Noah is told to make an ark that is 450 feet long (Genesis 6:14-15).  The largest wooden ships ever built were just over 300 feet, and they required diagonal iron strapping for support.  Even so, they leaked so badly that they had to be pumped constantly.  Are we to believe that Noah, with no shipbuilding knowledge and no shipbuilding tradition to rely upon, was able to construct a wooden ship that was longer than any that has been built since?<br>  <br>  16) Whether by twos or by sevens, Noah takes male and female representatives from each species of “every thing that creepeth upon the earth” (Genesis 7:8).  Now this must have taken some time, along with expert knowledge of taxonomy, genetics, biogeography, and anatomy.  How did Noah manage to collect the endemic species from the New World, Australia, Polynesia, and other remote regions entirely unknown to him?  How, once he found them, did he transport them back to his Near Eastern home?  How could he tell the male and female beetles (there are more than 500,000 species) apart?  How did he know how to care for these new and unfamiliar animals?  How did he find the space on the ark?  How did he manage to find and care for the hundreds of thousands of parasitic species or the hundreds of thousands of plant species?  (Plants are ignored in the Genesis account, but the animals wouldn’t last long if the plants died in the flood.)  No, wait, don’t tell me, a miracle happened, millions of them.<br>  <br>  17) All of the animals boarded the ark “in the selfsame day” (Genesis 7:13-14).  Since there were several million species involved, they must have boarded at a rate of at least 100 per second.  How did poor Noah and his family make sure that the correct number of each species entered through the door and then get them all settled into their proper living quarters so efficiently?  I wish the airline companies could do as well!<br>  <br>  18) The flood covered the highest mountain tops (Mount Everest?) with fifteen cubits to spare (Genesis 7:20).  Where did all the water come from?  Where did it all go?  Why is there no evidence of such a massive flood in the geological record?<br>  <br>  19) When the animals left the ark (Genesis 8:19), what would they have eaten?  There would have been no plants after the ground had been submerged for nearly a year.  What would the carnivores have eaten?  Whatever prey they ate would have gone extinct.  And how did the New World primates or the Australian marsupials find there way back after the flood subsided?<br>  <br>  20) Noah kills the “clean beasts” and burns their dead bodies for God (Genesis 8:20).  According to Genesis 7:8 this would have caused the extinction of all “clean” animals since only two of each were taken onto the ark.  So why is it that we still have “clean” animals?<br>  <br>  21) God is filled with remorse for having drowned his creatures in the flood.  He even puts the rainbow in the sky so that whenever the animals see it they will remember God’s promise not to do it again (Genesis 9:13).  But rainbows are caused by the nature of light, the refractive index of water, and the shape of raindrops.  There were rainbows billions of years before humans existed.<br>  <br>  22) “The whole earth was of one language” (Genesis 11:1).  But this could not be true, since by this time (around 2400 BCE) there were already many languages, each unintelligible to the others.<br>  <br>  23) (Genesis. 11:4) According to the Tower of Babel story, the many human languages were created instantaneously by God (Genesis 11:9)  But actually the various languages evolved gradually over long periods of time.<br>  <br>  24) (Genesis 14:14) Abram goes into pursuit looking for his captive relative in the city of Dan.  The problem here is that the city of Dan did not exist until over 300 years after Moses died.  How is it that Abram could enter the city of Dan, when the city did not even exist?<br>  <br>  25) Jacob displays his (and God’s) knowledge of biology by having goats copulate while looking at streaked rods.  The result is streaked baby goats (Genesis 30:37).  The aut|`|uFAoq4idaa	The Bible is the truth, the life and the way to everlasting life.

There is no proof for or against the Bible because the entire point of life is to build faith on something you have no proof of, hence the definition of faith.  If anything in the Bible could be proved beyond the shadow of a doubt, then believing in God would require no faith and our existence would be pointless.  Build a personal relationship with God and allow Him to set forth a path before you.  Be open minded as you will rarely have a good idea of where God is leading you, trust me.  Finally, Lucifer will always place obstacles in the path God has set before you.

Clearly, a God that meddles in human affairs is NOT compatible with free will.<br>  <br>  But what about a cosmic God who just observes his creation unfold without meddling in it (or at least, without meddling with humans)?<br>  <br>  I can conceive of a God who knows what will happen because he can see the future.  In other words, this God is timeless.  In this case, he doesn't necessarily cause the future, he simply takes a peek at it.  <br>  <br>  With this scenario, the unfolding, inanimate, universe expands in conformance with physical causality (predictable) -- while us humans exercise free will (unpredictable) and harness physical causality for our own purposes (power our cities, probe space, communicate at light speed, kill each other, etc.).<br>  <br>  God would know, in advance, what the universe is doing at any moment because he made it happen that way.  But God only knows what human free agents will do in the future because he is timeless and can see it -- not because he caused or controlled our actions.  He's an observer, not a meddler.<br>  <br>  This notion is more compatible with pantheism than with theism or atheism.<br>  <br>  It's impossible to know if there's a cosmic God.

Illustration: God gives you air to breathe, you say I don't want it so you put a bag over your head and suffer. You caused the suffering by rejecting the goodness of God. God wanted to take away your suffering because he loves you, so he suffered for you. He doesn't "get off" on it. The end result is the goal. NO pain no gain.

fc711dee0348a3fa4c47b0371bd359d5aa	Good question.  A god could not have human emotions as god (the source of all that is) is of a much much higher vibration. All loving, all good, all perfect.  Even the most evolved man can learn to just be and to rise above ego and attachments.  And ego and attachments can only exist for earthly beings.  The Abrahamic god concept comes from humans before they knew any better.  We have accelerated in our spiritual understanding of things.|`|VRgq1NV6aa	anthropomorphization.|`|mjh8ziJaaa	WE have Godly emotion.|`|ATPPWOpWaa	God came first.  We have some godly emotions.

Since we are created in the image of God we actually reflect him not us reflecting him. So our emotions actually come from him.|`|zkrVc020aa	You got it backwards. God has emotions and he created us in his image. He gave us of his emotions.|`|acIZTSsYaa	There are a number of possibilities for this reason. In one hand, God said that we were all created in his own image, meaning that we created not as god but god-like creatures. On another hand people seem to believe that God dwells outside of our perspective plane. What this means is that God, while not human itself expresses his feelings into human emotion in order for us to be able to understand him better. An example: A dog owner stomps his foot on the ground in order to get a e from his animal. While to dog might no that its master is mad simple by studying human emotion, the dog will understand that it's master is mad by the unconditional response of the foot stomping. Personally, i don't believe in any form of God, Abrahamic or other. To me, the reason that God has any emotion at all is because "it" is created by man in the form of religion. Religion, no matter what the religion is, promotes a obediance through fear. Humanity is limited by the laws of nature and physics. When humanity experiances something it can't explain or at the time duplicate, superstion sets in and we create a God that will watch over us. Of course this will eventually contradict itself as humanity starts to differ in ethics and values. I had one lady say that she was a Christian and that "My god would never let a young child die of cancer or any other illness." This again is contradictory in itself as the bible is full of people who god inflicts with plauges and diseases. To summerize my answer, it all depends on your perspective of God. He may exist on a different plane of existance or we may be created directly in his own image. Then again he might not exist at all. It all depends on how you percieve the word God.|`|LVMpbm6aaa	The Islamic perception of God is very different the Christian one.The anthropomorphism of God and His bipolar limited depiction are points of disagreement.|`|E9chZY74aa	Turn your question around.

We Christians are constantly being victimized just because we are trying to save souls.|`|e5b4a22cbe6271d858c17e5d4b535dd7aa	No thankfully I don't sufferer from being a christian. It is a horrible disease. I use to have it but I was able to rid myself of the affliction. Do you need help getting rid of it yourself?|`|AA10954753	Since many christians believe that they must be persecuted, nobody is fighting the evil. It's not enough to pray !.

AA10105819	Regarding that last statement:<br>  "I am sure a homosexual couple could provide a loving home just a well as any single parent in society today... if not better."<br>  Dear, couples <period>, hetero or homo, could give a child a better home than a single person, hetero or homo. A tag team is always stronger than the lone warrior.<br>  <br>  As for the rest... EXACTLY!!! If they wanna preserve the sanctity of marriage, they should stop wasting time on other people's marriages and start focusing on preserving their own. If they wanna make laws, let's put divorce on the ballot, suggest that it be made illegal. Then let's see how many of them actually vote to remove one of their <own> civil rights. Most wouldn't.

And the divorce rate does affect marriage, but again, that 50% could be among those who only 'call' themselves Christian. Christ wants forgiveness and reconciliation. Not only from us to Him, but with each other. If people realized this and lived it, the divorce rate would be much lower. And if people recognized the sanctity of marriage, there would be less teen pregnancy, STDs, kids out of wedlock, and divorce.|`|MV6pc1omaa	Why are us straight atheists allowed to marry?

Shouldn't those who want to strengthen marriage encourage everyone to marry?|`|03rOCajTaa	Good one!!!!<br>  You have pointed out some interesting facts....<br>  They are just saying that b/c they are against that.  <br>  Interesting fact:Chatholics are aganist divorces<br>  hmmm.... if it was like the olden days...what do you think it would be like if nobody got a divorce<br>  more cheating?<br>  more black and blue brucing?|`|HlFzl1piaa	Okay, okay, I can't speak for the rest of society, but its okay for you to be gay, just stop looking for approval.<br>  <br>  Why do you care what every one else thinks.|`|6d10d96d77b1df1496e4b66f2f0098bcaa	Perhaps homophobic Christians feel that without sanctions against gay marraige, then there is nothing to keep their own homosexual desires repressed.|`|OywIJxobaa	I think the bottom-line is, Christians want gays to give gay-marriage another name instead of calling it "marriage" like Christians do.|`|3xlDwlkhaa	The religious issues regarding gays and marriage is that gays as such do not produce children. They may adopt children and might be very good parents, but they as a rule do not produce children.<br>  <br>  Why is this important?<br>  <br>  This is important because the strength of a religion is based on its numbers of believers. Children born into a particular religion are most likely to adhere to and support that religion and pass it on to their offspring as well. The more children a couple produces, the more believers that are added to the church roster.<br>  <br>  The issue is political and monetary rather than moral. In this way of thinking, marriage is defined as a child producing union. That is why there is a huge disconnect when people are required to consider gay marriage - it seems such a contradiction in terms.

KNV7oPr3aa	yes big difference sis, people are allowed to have there opinion's|`|YUq2kwxJaa	To me there is I guess it depends on your intention that is. You can say 'That person is nice' and have a good intention or you can say 'That person is nicer than the other person' where it seems like youre comparing two people to each other and seeing where one is lower (less worthy) than the other.<br>  <br>  I praise people but only because I think they deserve that praise and by praising them Im not putting anyone else down.<br>  <br>  I am not Allah (swt) to judge anyone but I am human to have an opinion about someone.|`|TXyFtQ9uaa	To Judge something there has to be some sort of reference point or criterion that one may obtain information and sum- up as to whether someone or something is right or wrong,it can thus be said that judgement is only as good as the evidence given and the character of one effecting judgement, it is then that an opinion is thus reached be it based on a just assessment of the facts or components in a given scenario that fair judgement is then effected, however distortion of or omission of the facts given any case will ultimately lead to poor judgement resulting in oppression against the defendant in any case. however baring in mind that the judge must be of good character or such an individual will only effect judgement in a manner best suiting their own ends.|`|6L4n6CFaaa	Yes, there is.<br>  To have an opinion about some one you are most likely informed about that subject. When judging some one you probably don't know the circumstances.<br>  <br>  I'll leave the judging to Allah (swt)|`|NlQhkgFCaa	I've always felt you should give people a fair chance before judging/forming an opinion about them|`|dt4BIWSMaa	Of course. But if that person you have an opinion about you really dislike him/her for good reason it isn't good to even speak ill of them then. Difference is they may have good about them that you don't know about and you may see their behaviour as bad, wrong, irritating whatever and that is opinion. But to judge them even when you see that it is outright wrong being imperfect yourself you don't want to intentionally put yourself in a situation where you are talking ill of them. It is best to make duaa for them and yourself for patience in dealing with them. People do tend to learn and grow as they go along in life.|`|coiGm7VKaa	yeah there is a difference<br>  <br>  when u judge someone, u cant really tell that person, and mostly u say it in a bad and hurtful way<br>  <br>  but when u are havin an opinion u can tell the person, and naturally, u say it in the nicest way possible|`|U5zcbHuZaa	Yes. There is also a difference between calling them for what they are and condemning them (judging them) as unredeemable.<br>  <br>  I'm in a situation right now where I am trying to explain to a friend that while the people she wants to cling to may indeed be redeemable, it is clear that they are not going to redeem right now and so she should go away from them for awhile (they are not healthy for her or for others, for that matter, they aren't even healthy for each other, they reinforce each other's faultiness) and come back later after some other events have transpired to see if they are making any movement yet toward redemption.

dz5Og81Qaa	I don't.<br>  <br>  The Bible is definitely NOT the Word of God. If God really wanted to write a book Jesus would have done it Himself and there would be no questions about it. It would also be a very different book.<br>  <br>  No matter how inspired the authors were or by what source, the information had to filter through their minds and personalities. The Bible was written by men immersed in an ancient patriarchal culture. They all had agendas, whether it was keeping the social order, unifying doctrine, eliminating heresy or gaining converts. For me, it's a pretty transparent piece of propaganda.<br>  <br>  What I do value in the Bible is the story of Christ's life and teachings. I think He knew how misinterpreted and manipulated words can become and therefore lived in a way that would allow us to follow in His footsteps regardless of what anyone wrote about Him.<br>  <br>  The links below objectively detail the origins of the Bible (1)<br>  as well as the inconsistencies and inaccuracies (2)|`|XN0cYCATaa	Because I believe it is the Truth, and if the If truth is relative, then the statement that truth is relative is an absolute truth and would be self defeating statement by proving that truth is not relative.  But, if truth is absolute, then the statement "truth is absolute" is true and not self defeating.  It is true that truth exists.  It is true that truth will not contradict itself as we have just seen.  In fact, it is absolutely true that you are reading this paper.<br>  <br>  If we can see that there is such a thing as truth in the world, then we could also see that there can be spiritual truth as well.  It is not absurd to believe in spiritual absolutes anymore than physical or logical absolutes.  Even the statement that all religions lead to God is a statement held to be a spiritual absolute by many people.  This simply demonstrates that people do believe in spiritual truth.  Why?  Because truth exists.  However, not all that is believed to be true actually is true.  Furthermore, all belief systems cannot be true since they often contradict each other in profound ways -- and truth is not self-contradictory.|`|206820c72192d15525008e6de3c12f85aa	Because it's 100% truth and directly from the mouth of God.<br>  In it contains the way to salvation..........through Jesus Christ alone.|`|mNyhRGowaa	I beleive in Jesus, He was the word and the word was good! and was made flesh so that through it we may be saved!|`|02sr7hNOaa	Because I've seen it.

Remember, you cannot take, or get out of ANYTHING.... more than what you put in!  If you are not getting enough out of your relationship.....perhaps you're just getting back what you put in ?|`|qegWdsNLaa	In terms of having "gone gay," I think the determinant of that is not whether you're unattracted to your husband (or any other man), but rather whether you're attracted to other women.  I mean, it could also easily be that you've just lost your interest in sex in general (or sex with other people).      Overall, though, it just sounds like you don't get along with your husband so well anymore, which is sad but doesn't necessarily mean that you're gay.      Genders aren't hive minds -- all men aren't alike, and all women aren't alike, so hoping for a woman's mind in a man's body makes little to no sense.  If you want someone who thinks about certain subjects that also interest you and can have a conversation about those subjects (which presumably do not include food, sex or going to the bathroom), then you just need to find such a person, and believe me, there are men like that and there are women like that just as there are women who pretty much just think about food sex and the bathroom (just as there are men).      Or maybe you just need to be on your own, at least for a while.  I'm not saying that to belittle you at all.  There are a lot of people who eventually find out that they are just happy living on their own.  Sometimes they have loving, romantic and even sexual relationships with people but just don't live with them (which I suppose allows them to avoid some of the baser elements of the human condition) and sometimes they just like being their own person entirely and maybe occasionally having a fling (or not) as it suits them but by and large charting their own course.  All of these are totally legitimate options.

He said to "Worship in Spirit." This is a mysterious kind of prayer that in all probability is more like meditation than praying for one another. It is a way to bring in the light, to remove the darkness. Click on my avatar for more details.    I mention this because "praying for one another" is more like "let my will be done," rather than "let thy will be done."    Let my will be done is not a good kind of prayer.

We've tried drinking them out in the past, but I never imagined this would work...|`|D9lMg7A2aa	First of all...you disregard that the mainstream of Western Philosophy, not to mention the OT and NT, say that the existence of God -- just the existence -- is provable. Here it is in the Catholic Catechism   " the Church, holds and teaches that God, the first principle and last end of all things, can be known with certainty from the created world by the natural light of human reason."    IF you thought the opposite, that you had proved with certainty the non-existence of God..you wouldn't even be posting, would you.      You are confused...you go from Christians...to God..to a list of gods...back to Christian...then to God.    I can be certain of the existence of the One God...as to WHO IS THAT ONE GOD, well that gets into revelation as we can't know anything unless God reveal it.     What the Wager says to you at your stage is that you must prosecute the search until you get an answer even if you do it until death. You obviously don't have an answer and you misconstrue all answers as non-rational and you conflate God and Jesus.|`|4807230affa1ab91b912bc7830a4b01baa	Pascal's Wager has no place in Christianity.

Hebrews 11:6  Now without faith it is impossible to please God, for whoever comes to him must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who diligently search for him.|`|O1QBA5XSaa	Not all of us believe that non-belief = damnation.

Even if I decided to worship God, even though I'm 100% positive in my mind that he does not exist, and let's say, hypothetically, that I was wrong all along and he DID exist...    Would God still allow me into heaven, even though I never truly had faith in him? Or would pretending to be a Christian be sufficient? I imagine it wouldn't be.     Does God really want people to pretend they believe in him just because his side seemed a little less risky? I thought he wanted, you know, people of genuine faith.|`|FhHklqkhaa	your question is based on the idea that they are honest and rational - many are not either of these things   I'd be surprised if you get many good answers from your target group|`|ATPPWOpWaa	Your question supposes in error that is by mans effort that we believe in god.  It is God that gives us faith and are drawn to Him.|`|tqQIcLb5aa	Maybe John-Henry Newman's similar saying will help.    If I lose the world and gain my soul I have lost nothing.  If I gain the world and lose my soul I have gained nothing.    The point is that you come into this world with nothing and after a frighteningly short time leave the world with nothing. Christ offers us life after death. If you live according to his law and it turns out that He didn't exist you'll still leave the world with nothing more or less than if you hadn't. But if He does then for so little you gain so much.    It is directed, I think, at agnostics to encourage them to live moral lives more than anything.|`|Yv58JZqHaa	You don't become dead certain that something is false overnight.  By the same token, you can't insantly develop absolute belief in something's existence.  We make decisions that strengthen or weaken our belief or disbelief in things like God; the decision to try to believe in God (or not) is indeed one of those.  Belief isn't an on/off switch, but a spectrum.    As for Pascal's Wager, I dislike it either way since it implies that desire for reward and/or fear of Hell are valid reasons to become a Christian; they are not.  Even if I believed in such a place as an eternal Hell, I would feel the same way.

Personally, I can honestly tell you that in asking the question "why are we here?", I have never come to the conclusion that a talking snake tricked two people - either both made of mud or else one of mud and the other of a rib (the text is unclear), and because of that a Cosmic Debt was established that must be paid by God coming down to earth, speaking some great lines of wisdom (some even related to the Eastern Philosophies which predated Him by at least 500 years) but then deciding the best way to inject this wisdom into the culture was by having the authorities nail Him to a cross, thereby giving up His life (or at least a weekend) in payment for this Cosmic Debt. Then, since He forgot to give some basic guidelines concerning the distribution of the wisdom, he showed up as a ghost to a fellow (which the companions either heard or didn't hear, saw or didn't see - the text is unclear) who had every reason to feel guilty about his own despicable persecution of a sect for their beliefs -leading eventually to a justification for the entire religion to be codified into an instrument for the persecution of many other people who hold differing beliefs. It would then therefore continue to exist today as a strict religious philosophy that somehow finds the words of it's savior only valid when convenient - ignoring absolute admonitions about divorce and re-marriage is a prime example - while tending to side with the ghost-seer because he can allow them to still persecute a minority like homosexuality. Topping all this nonsense off, I should then be led to believe that the world will end soon; and because of that paranoid knowledge I would not only be allowed to but be required to tell rumors and spread a load of fear-mongering gibberish because I'm going to disappear one day while driving my car.     I wouldn't believe a load of bullocks like this...but that's just me....|`|R534McNOaa	I Agree, some people just log-on to the question without an answer, sometimes as a "Joke" thing (which does lighten things up) and others are more mercenary for "Points" to their "Profile", rather than as a point of argument!

I, for instance, was raised in a Protestant home, and attended a Christian school from 5th grade until High School graduation. However, I deconverted from Christianity my Senior year.    I do not believe in God, but I am willing to bet that I know a great bit more about religion than you do.    Plus, do you know how many religious people I have encountered who did not know a d@mn thing about their religion, other than that they believed it... There are an awful lot of them.

Also some atheist are just a$$holes who want to interfere with your spiritual beliefs... they think that just because they think a certain way, then you should.  This is all generally speaking.

Matthew 7:2-5 declares, "For in the same way you judge others, you will be judged, and with the measure you use, it will be measured to you. Why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brother's eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye?

I've studied many religions. So why would I not answer if someone asks a question about religion just because I don't believe the same thing the asker does?|`|F32uPjAraa	I know a great deal about most religions. Probably much more than most closed minded religionists. It is because I have looked for answers, and in the process have learnt that all the worlds biggest religions began as cults. They are responsible for more death, sadness and poverty than any other organizations. For this reason I am a devout atheist. And besides that I have a right to answer any question on this site, on any topic. Get a life.  And another thing. I would like to see all religious teachings, all religious schools made illegal. If children want to learn about this rubbish, then let them wait until they are eighteen years old. Religious teaching is mind control and child abuse.

Not believing in your god, does not automatically mean we we know nothing about your religion.  Some atheists will have started as believers in your god, others will have read your holy text and other accounts.    I am of the opposite view to you, I really think you do need to know other people's viewpoints on all things.  If you refuse to listen to others and question your own belief - how can you say you've found the truth ?  Listen to atheists, christians, muslims, hindus, jews, etc and make an informed decision - it could strengthen your original views or it could lead you down a better path.|`|QVKWVValaa	I know a lot about religion. I used to be Christian. It was actually my increased knowledge about world religions that made me abandon them all together. Do you know there have been thousands of religions throughout history and all of them at one point or another have faded away into mythology? That was one of the biggest things that turned me away from religion.  In fact, I know a fair bit about several religions. I may believe all religions are false, but that doesn't invalidate my knowledge of them. Most religions I've studied have a terrible dark side to them that followers of that faith are not taught, or ignore all together. That is something I enjoy pointing out to followers of certain faiths who carry on about how their religion and god are so much better than other gods.  Also, many people try to find religious answers to the simplest questions. "How can God help me understand my homework better?" "What can I do to get God to help me tell my neighbour to mow his lawn?" "I can't find any thing to be happy about. How can I get God to help me?" Seriously, read through some of the stupid things people ask. All these questions have simple, real-life answers that any sensible person could figure out if they just used their heads instead of their faith.

Not asking why God did something; instead asking why people believe in religion at all.  Does it fulfill a need?  Is there a part of the brain that relates to this need?  I've seen recent studies of an area of the brain on the underside of the frontal lobes somewhere just above your back teeth in terms of general location, that seems to be the "God gland."  If this gland is active, you are religiously active.  If it isn't, your depth of need for religion is a toss-up that depends on your childhood environment.  Since the mechanism isn't well understood yet, I won't bother to give details.  Wish I still had the link.<br>  <br>  In any case, Marx offered the idea that religion was the opiate of the masses.  The problem these days is that the opiate-heads are not so quiet as they used to be.  The sheep are tired of being sheared by themselves.  They are trying to use more intense rhetoric on an increasingly indifferent audience.  Which somehow seems sad that they would waste all that energy when rebuilding the planet would be a better use of their time.

HVY2rqzfaa	Reading and paraphrasing notes (not just reading them, re-wording them seems to get them stuck in your head better).    Spread out your revision rather than leave it till the last minute. Take time out (not too much though) to do other things with friends or game or read or whatever floats your boat. Miserable minds tend not to co-operate.    Try not to obsess - a level of concern is good, but obsessing really doesn't help.    If there is something you don't understand ask for help. Ask now, so you can have it explained to you and you can understand it by the 15th.    not really sure what else to suggest...    Oh, yeah, as I always have to remind my son.    READ THE QUESTION, read it again and make sure you understand what they are asking of you before you rush into an answer. Even the most amazingly written answer will be wrong if you don't answer what was being asked of you.|`|ejbSFv0caa	The best tips I can give are drink plenty of water in the period of your revision.      I f you get thirsty you are already too dehydrated!    Also eat & sleep well.  All these will help you be at your mental peak.  What many people forget is that the revision only works if you are mentally up to revising.  So rest well and pace yourself for the exam itself.    btw good luck!|`|1cbe645c48452635e8fece5d24664bb8aa	well Asif, from my experience, I will try to give some useful tips. I don't know how you study because everyone has their own style. But I didn't study with any suggestion. I read the whole book. You will inshallah get all the subjective questions common, but I can't guarantee you about objective. Specially, in Bangla 2nd paper it really got us. Thanks to Allah, I managed to get A+ in that :D anyways, give much more time in objective, solve the objectives of board questions and "STAR" guide.   About subjective.......you'll get all common because every year the board makes the question even easier. So you have to concern yourself with the process of writing or how you are gonna present your answers on the papers.   Bangla : you know you have to give introduction, description and conclusion. just don't make any spelling mistake and write as much as you can.   English : I don't think you will need any advice in this subject. ^_^  Physics : while writing definition, give examples, unit and dimensions. Try to give some conclusion. don't just finish a question with the last line of the answer. You know what I mean. even one sentence would be enough.  Chemistry : not much different from Physics. just write the equation perfectly.  Biology : Figure, Figure and Figure. the most important thing. other things as same as above two.  Religion : try giving some verse from Quran and Hadith in Arabic. memorize some from the book which you can attach with any question.  Social Science : quite a disgusting subject, but don't worry S.S.C is the last for this stupid thing. in this subject OBJECTIVE is the most important. give figures with geography portion. You have to read this subject thoroughly.   Mathematics : You must be thinking why I gave this subject at last. Because you'll get the easiest question from this paper. Higher Math and General Math - easiest problems ever you'll get here.    the number of the subjects which have objectives, will depend on objectives. so read it finely. practice drawing figures and keep the swiftness of writing from the beginning. don't think you'll get time later.    Last but not the least - NEVER UNDERESTIMATE A SINGLE SUBJECT. IF YOU DO, YOU KNOW FOR SURE THAT YOU ARE GONNA GET A FAILURE IN THAT SUBJECT ( I mean not getting A+ :-P) so ALL THE VERY BEST WITH YOUR EXAM ^_^|`|AA11923447	Pay very close attention to what the instructors have been saying all this time. Did they emphasize a point more than once? Then it's likely going to be important.     Review all of your notes carefully. From a detailed review of the notes, it's not difficult to start seeing which points are likely to be important. Using those points, draft an exam for yourself. Pretend that you are the instructor, or the certifying board. From that body of material you've got in your notes, what do you think people should be walking away with? Write one (or better still, several) exams based on your own notes. Take those exams in essay format (multiple choice and other easy options are worthless, in terms of studying) until you're able to pass them in your sleep.    Flash cards can also be very helpful, as can simulating lectures from your own notes. Go to a empty classroom (most are empty in the early evening), find one with a blackboard, and start writing down notes on the board as if you're engaging in a lecture to a room full of students. What are the important points that those students should know? If they're important enough for you to write on the board, it's time to start memorizing them.|`|LjsRfaskaa	Exam tips lol. If you have not done the ground work study there is no amount of tips that will help you pass.     I do not like the way you turn your lazyness into our failure. It is your exam if you fail it is your fault.    I already have my Phd. in physics I do not need to prove anything to you.      Practicing Shaman... quantum physics rocks.|`|89MKzLl3aa	I am a certified teacher. What specifically do you need help with besides what I call " rehearse and review ."    Edit: Does your school have a website and a down-loadable study guide? Hopefully, you've been studying before "now". Team up with a student, and quiz one another. Be sure that you know the techniques in writing meaning how to construct an opening paragraph, how to organize the topic, and how to conclude. Sharpen your reading comprehension skills; there are many websites that offer practice and exam tips.    I have a few years of experience in Secondary Education, but mostly in Special Education in the areas of Severe Mental Retardation, but these are tips that any educator will tell you.|`|IqqaA2wIaa	my 6th grade teacher was great and he said dont change any answers that you already marked unless totally sure you goofed......spend some time studying what will be on the test....good luck|`|UH1ipgJmaa	Sit behind the smartest kid...........I think I have answered this question before or maybe the wine was too much.|`|XAlCd8Ebaa	When I was studying for the bar, the thing that actually helped me the most was the flash cards I made up.

You might write a poem about her. If you can take a photo of her offspring, you could frame it along with the poem. Then when people ask about it, you could explain how wonderful she was. Not only would she be honored, but people might learn from her to appreciate such creatures more. <br>  <br>  I'm very sorry that happened. Natural yes, but that doesn't keep it from being very sad.

mkT0PQ4Paa	Salam,  The giving of a dowry from the groom to the bride is one of the requirements for the marriage to be valid. If no dowry is given the marriage is not valid. It can be as little or as much as they agree upon (though the prophet -peace and blessings be upon him-did advise us to lower the amounts asked for for dowries to make getting married easier on men, so that they could easily complete half their deen). It can be one dollar or a million dollars...And part of it can be stipulated as being "To be given later when the groom is able to". Such as the dowry being stipulated as 1000 dollars, but the bride receiving like 50 upon the wedding day and the rest being left till later whenever the groom could manage it...|`|Izn1ye9Raa	Yes I recieved a $100 USD dowry (what we agreed on) the day after we got married because my husband forgot to give it to me that night.|`|zBqt99avaa	I'm not Muslim, but the man I'm marrying is, and I asked for a dowry :)    I asked for an engagement ring, and that he be willing to teach me whatever I wanted to know about Islam...He thinks it's a fair deal :D|`|AYs6iFlLaa	It is a requirement in Islam to give dowry. No marriage is valid without one. Yes, American Muslims give a dowry. I think that most don't give or expect the same as Muslims from Islamic countries. In America, I think it is more of a token than a financial disbursement. I was given money and other items but I know some sisters who requested things that were related to Islam like collections of Hadith or Fancy Qurans, also some simply accept a small token such as a ring or other jewelry.|`|niDOzrJraa	My sister got married last year and we are in Canada, originally from Pakistan.  My parents said they would pay for furnishing their new home and his parents gave my sister clothes and jewelry.  Im not so sure if thats really a  traditional dowry where the girl's family has to give soo much.    I just read an article in the paper where one Indian family's dowry for their daughter was over $50,000...thats just exuberant.|`|VVk0hHgpaa	My boyfriend and I are not bothering with engagement rings.

N53y9qohaa	Hello,<br>  <br>  You can accept communion so long as you have not committed a serious, aka mortal sin. As you surmise, there is not one day in our lives where we are really worthy to receive it.<br>  <br>  Now while I have your ear, I have heard some arguments that being worthy in taking communion meant that you have the service or mass in an appropriate gathering and do so with reverence. You do not have communion at a dance, bar, biker's party etc.<br>  <br>  Finally I used to go to confession frequently confessing a few habitual types of sins. The priest finally told me to come once a month or so, do not deny myself communion and that was sufficient. He obviously shared your point of view.<br>  <br>  Cheers,<br>  <br>  Michael Kelly|`|xZet9Dunaa	only if you commit a mortal sin venial is O.K.|`|3yNh5jO8aa	catholicism twists scripture....but i know that you shouldn't take communion if you have unconfessed sin in your life. meaning that you can't be continuing in teh same sin with no desire to change. if you do that and take communion, you are sinning.|`|MVT34FZsaa	Denial of God, the Holy Spirit of God
CGxQ9vSuaa	You know what, I totally agree with you.  Without the service industry in America specifically, nothing would get accomplished.  See in the U.S., service workers like those in waste management, food/grocery preparation and/or delivery, janitorial custodians and the like are not valued because they are seen as "less than" simply due to their current occupation.  What alot of people don't know is that many of these men & women have college degrees and are extremely hard-working; more so than your average cubical-punch-monkey.  I have a rule that I always follow-never insult someone making your food.  No explanation needed.|`|PvPPivLJaa	They're obviously hypocrites. Because, technically, the Bible states something about Don't Judge Lest You Be Judged and they pretty much go against what the Bible preaches by shooting their nose up at people because of their occupation, so how can they even call you out because of your beliefts.  In reality, they THINK they are Christians, but if the Gates of Heaven opened up this very minute, you'd see a whole lot wondering why they didn't get their ticket for entry.    So, really, you can't take them seriously.    I believe in God for sure, and I try everyday to be a non-judgmental person.|`|DmjSkZSTaa	Its funny when all Christians do is judge others with a different faith.

This quote does not provide proof that salvation is by grace alone, but shows the importance of having scriptural faith in the holy trinity to recieve grace.  This quote implies that it is a combination of faith and works that bring you salvation, and whoever says it doesn't take work to stay out of sin doesn't live in my world.  As far as the reference to feelings, the heart can lie.|`|RqFQgYBbaa	Yes. Jesus came to earth and died on a cross so that we could be saved and go to heaven. We need faith to get us through life. We need faith to believe the Jesus is. Grace will also help us!|`|7kJFmyxdaa	Grace which is "God's unmerited favor" is a free gift from God to everyone. Salvation comes as a result of accepting this gift which is given to you when you accept Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior. You can not get saved by simply going to church. You can not get saved by just reading the Bible. You can not get saved by attending weekly Bible study. You can only be saved by accepting Jesus Christ into your life. You have to confess that Jesus Christ was born, died and rose on the third day. This is the only way to be saved.

Especially if they're both virgins.  If they didn't masturbate then they get a short fuse.  Other than that, they get 'bragging rights', if they're in the company of people with similar beliefs.  If they're not with those people, then they get regret.  Especially if their partner becomes unattractive to them.  Its interesting to note:  Marriage as it exists today was unheard of in the times of the Old Testament.  A man would just go in a woman's tent and 'lie with her'.  After that, they were considered to be together, or married.          Unfortunately in today's world, remaining celibate until marriage does NOT guarantee a happy, successful marriage.  Personally, I wouldn't marry someone I hadn't lived with.  Thats when you really get to know them.  Hey, God loves you anyway.    Dont forget, there's always ear sex!    P.S.  I hear anal sex is really becoming quite popular in the Christian colleges.  They think they're still virgins.
4fTiCNiKaa	Interesting question my sister. Consider the following text's...<br>  <br>  Re 3:12 <br>  Him that overcometh will I make a pillar in the temple of my God, and he shall go no more out: and I will write upon him the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, which is new Jerusalem, which cometh down out of heaven from my God: and I will write upon him my new name. <br>  <br>  Re 21:2 <br>  And I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. <br>  <br>  From my understanding of heaven, and the New Jerusalem the difference is that heaven in this context is the location of God, whereas the New Jerusalem is where God actually dwells with His people. God is omnipresent. Therefore He is everywhere, at every time (past, present, and future). So heaven (in these text's it is the 3rd heaven [the first heaven is the Earths atmopher, and the second heaven in the universe]) is where the Fathers manifested presence is now. But He will come down and dwell with His people eternally in the new Jerusalem. <br>  <br>  God bless.<br>  <br>  Elder Greg<br>  ~SFECU~<br>  pray4revival|`|5c254ae6fd284e63adce0f1aa14dcfe9aa	Rev 21:2 And I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. <br>  <br>  Heaven is where ever God resides at...<br>  He will reside with us on Earth. The world will be cleansed by then.<br>  <br>  Joe 3:17 So shall ye know that I [am] the LORD your God dwelling in Zion, my holy mountain: then shall Jerusalem be holy, and there shall no strangers pass through her any more.|`|206820c72192d15525008e6de3c12f85aa	If we die before the return of Christ, we go to heaven to be with Him immediately (Absence from the body is presence with the Lord)<br>  <br>  In the end though, you're right Sandy......the New Jerusalem will descend from the air.....and that's where we will live for all eternity. This is spoken of in Revelation 22.<br>  <br>  This New Jerusalem will have walls that are 120 feet thick......about 1500 miles long in each direction (including up). It's amazing how the Scriptures even give us the specific measurements on this one.<br>  <br>  I cannot wait to go there! Maranatha, Jesus!|`|HQrqA2I1aa	Why do we need god to build a Utopia? DO you know how powerful humans are?

The pure creation that God created has never been lost. It lies before us, we just aren't looking with God's eyes. As we draw down into our consciousness this truth, the New Jerusalem written into the book of our innocence, the lamb, we see kindness overflowing. The Kingdom of Heaven never left, only our vision got distorted when we left God (and said he banished us from the Garden) and immediately felt guilt from leaving. That guilt put a veil over all creation. Forgiveness wipes it away.|`|dDMOJWxwaa	Rev 3:12<br>   12 Him that overcometh will I make a pillar in the temple of my God, and he shall go no more out: and I will write upon him the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, [which is] new Jerusalem, which cometh down out of heaven from my God: and [I will write upon him] my new name.<br>  Rev 21:2<br>   2 And I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. <br>  <br>  I think if I gave you information as I understand it about the Jerusalem's, you would not believe.  Heaven, by inheritance will be the earth. Revelation describes a city 644 miles square.  The one coming down out of heaven to the earth is Enoch's Jerusalem.  Enough said.|`|K3PR7Mivaa	I'm enjoying this question and plan on studying before going further with my answer. I did want to mention again the awesome work of the Lord in my life. Today my daughter had a field trip for her 1st grade class to see Disney on Ice and I was going as a helper but missed my ride, with another parent, and thought it best to go on by myself the 50 min drive. Well I had gone to a funeral Tuesday for a friend at church, whose father passed. Where the service revolved around heaven-going,rapture,being our home. Then wed night my great uncle whom I was close with suddenly died during complications with a  spontaneous open heart surgery and I had to go to his viewing this evening. Well back from my rabbit trail, I took the time alone driving today to spend with my Friend and Counselor Jesus, sharing with Him and praising with Him, telling Him I really just wanted to draw closer to him. After awhile I turned on the local christian station, and came across an old message of Oliver B Green I believe they said, and for 20 mins I heard Him speak on Heaven, New Jerusalem, about what is was and scriptures about it. It was very beautiful and interesting and I told myself I'd like to go into this study especially during this time that love ones are gone to heaven and some left are unsaved. Then I jumped on here real quick and see you've asked a question regarding this same topic. It is no coincidence, God is at work. Thank you for letting Him use you, pray for me, that I'll hear His voice and have wisdom and discernment in handling His will and message for me. Thank you for the answers above and your insight into this topic. God Bless you all and I'll see you there!<br>  <br>  God is so Good All the time and He's always on time|`|Sx6vlEUbaa	Revelation 21:2<br>  And I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.<br>  <br>  "coming down from God out of heaven"<br>  <br>  That does not indicate it IS heaven.<br>  <br>  "prepared as a bride"<br>  <br>  That does not indicate it IS a bride.<br>  <br>  Matthew 6:10<br>  Your kingdom come. Your will be done On earth as it is in heaven.<br>  <br>  Where?  On this Earth<br>  <br>  The first resurrection are those who are resurrected to rule and reign with Jesus where?  On this Earth.<br>  <br>  Psalm 115:16<br>  The heaven, even the heavens, are the LORD’s;But the EARTH He has given to the children of men.<br>  <br>  Blessed are the meek, <br>  For they shall inherit the earth.|`|TneDU9R3aa	----------------------------------------...<br>  51. His disciples said to him, "When will the rest for the dead take place, and when will the new world come?"<br>  <br>  He said to them, "What you are looking forward to has come, but you don't know it."  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  <br>  <br>  Being free from coveting is bringing the new Jerusalem within us. Jesus brought the word of God to the willing so to cause the dead within us to rest (exhumed our demons). The new Jerusalem, which means city of peace replaces the dead nature, for what is living. It is our bodies which become this city of peace; where the nature of God sits alone within the senate of our minds. Where two natures existed; they are now down to one nature. <br>  <br>  The disciples didn't even realize this about themselves, because the death they were asking about was the physical death of the body; rather than the death of the animal nature within the mind. Therefore unless your mind ascends above materialism in this lifetime, Truly what mind will be left for the Soul to use to achieve Resurrection?
IgztWp0uaa	Since I believe that most things happen for a reason, I just look at whatever is falling apart as an opportunity for a fresh start at whatever the issue is. Remember, that you are only responsible for those things that you have direct control over. You are not responsible for the actions or situations of others, only yourself.<br>  I always look at unhappiness as a signal to ourselves that something in your/my life is out of balance and not what it should be. That is when you need to communicate the most with the people around you. Sometimes they can see the situation more clearly than you can yourself. Also, you have to be honest with yourself about the reality of your life and what you need to do to make yourself happy and fulfilled. If you can define the problem, then you can work on finding the solution.<br>  Another word of advice, don't try to force what doesn't fit. Let things that are not right for you find themselves to the place they should be. Discord is the signal of an improper "fit".<br>  What I am trying to say is, the best way to get rid of that feeling is to actually deal with the situation to the best of your ability, then let the rest of it go, move on, what ever you want to call it.|`|FYQe54Akaa	Yep; you let the devil come into your mind; he'll try to lead you into darkness.|`|AA11124121	have new, positive experiences.|`|msv0hNgFaa	Sometimes I have!<br>  <br>  I've made mistakes.

Sometimes someone did something to me to make my life horrible, in that case I know it wasn't my fault. Other times I did something horribly wrong and there's no one to blame but myself.<br>  To get rid of the feeling I forgive whoever wronged me, and sometimes I need to stay away from them. Or if I did it, I try to fix it.  Each case is a little different though.

The command (or the judgement) is for none but Allaah. He has commanded that you worship none but Him (i.e. His Monotheism); that is the (true) straight religion, but most men know not”<br>  <br>  [Yoosuf 12:40] <br>  <br>  “The decision is only for Allaah”<br>  <br>  [al-An’aam 6:57]<br>  <br>  “And so judge (you O Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????) among them by what Allaah has revealed and follow not their vain desires, but beware of them lest they turn you (O Muhammad ??? ???? ???? ????) far away from some of that which Allaah has sent down to you. And if they turn away, then know that Allaah’s Will is to punish them for some sins of theirs. And truly, most of men are Faasiqoon (rebellious and disobedient to Allaah).<br>  <br>  50.

It's allah's way or no way.  Where does that allow for the people to make a decision?  allah made all the rules from sentences handed out for crimes to how to wipe yourself after using the restroom.  Where is the freedom?  Nowhere according to this verse:  <br>  <br>  quran 009.029 <br>  YUSUFALI: Fight those who believe not in Allah nor the Last Day, nor hold that forbidden which hath been forbidden by Allah and His Messenger, nor acknowledge the religion of Truth, (even if they are) of the People of the Book, until they pay the Jizya with willing submission, and feel themselves subdued. <br>  <br>  <br>  Jesus said render to Caesar what is Caesar's and to God what is God's.  He also said:<br>  <br>  John 18:36<br>  Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews: but now is my kingdom not from hence.<br>  <br>  He allowed for separation of Church and State.  That allows for the freedom to choose, which would allow a democracy to thrive.
AA10717341	She is technically be correct that both Valentine's day and Christmas have some roots in pagan religions. <br>  <br>  However, the majority of Seventh-day Adventists, like other Christians, appreciate the opportunity to commemorate the birth of our Savior, Jesus Christ. We do encourage the opportunity to serve others, to give more than receive, to give to those less fortunate and above and to share the good news of Jesus' birth, life, and sacrifice that we might be saved!  Personally, I gain a great blessing from Christmas music!<br>  <br>  As for Valentine's Day, while I believe that we should show those that we love -- that we love them year round, one day dedicated to celebrating a little romance is a good thing.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, your co-worker is a very, very conservative -- perhaps even fanatical) Seventh-day Adventist and is not representative of our faith.  (There are also some groups who have Seventh-day Adventist in their name, such as Shepherd's Rod and Branch Davidian, who are not really Adventists, but an offshoot that has basically left the Seventh-day Adventist faith.)  <br>  <br>  I hope this is helpful, and if you have any other questions, you would like to ask about our faith, please feel free to e-mail me.<br>  <br>  God Bless|`|N8wutNoLaa	she is right.<br>  most of todays holidays, INCLUDING christian ones, have pagan origins.|`|f10424ac1ac7b1791b4f665094823d61aa	You're happy with being a Pentecostal Christian, so I wouldn't worry too much about what this woman believes.<br>  <br>  Christmas Day may have overlaid other pagan rites held at that time of year, but it is the day Christians use to celebrate the birth of Christ and that is really all you need to know.<br>  <br>  Valentine's Day has nothing to do with Satan, and began when St Valentine (a Christian) married Roman soldiers against the will of their commander and was martyred on that date.<br>  <br>  I think you can work out for yourself whether fashion is the work of the devil.<br>  <br>  She is trying to convert you to her way of thinking.  Just write back and say that you are happy with your own beliefs.   7th Day Adventists are generally considered to be extremist in their views.|`|WQvqLnnhaa	She is pretty much correct.... Our Christmas traditions and the like are mixed with pagan festivals. We know Christ was not born in December.<br>  Im not trying to say our celebration of Christmas is pagan. But its origin has been blended. Nor am I trying to tell you not to celebrate the birth of our savior.|`|bK5MJCxhaa	Heh.  Welcome to my world.  It's not much fun having every move you make judged and damned, is it.<br>  <br>  <----atheist.|`|6b8e59fd2fd02ff0fc91538b71ecd4d8aa	Sounds like she's trying to control your way of thinking - so anyone attempting to control another is wrong.<br>  If you want to know what i really think: she's entitled to her own beliefs - but you don't have to listen - especially if she goes on about them all the time.<br>  Life's to short to be listening to other people's rubbish. <br>  Seventh day Adventists seem to be stuck in religious legalism - ''fashion is from the devil''  -  don't let that religious junk stick to you - Jesus set us free from all the legalism that bound us.<br>  <br>  Sorry if it sounds blunt - but if she wants to live like that it's her choice - it doesn't have to be yours.<br>  <br>  blessings     ; )<br>  ~~~~~~~<br>  <br>  I agree with Jill above.|`|ZasNwdXaaa	She is correct. The bible even calls those who do Xmas, heathens. Xmas and Easter are both linked to Nimrod. And in Revelation 2:15 we are told clearly that YHWH hates this. Trinity is in there as well. All pagan concepts brought over. Here is a video about Valentines day.<br>  <br>  video: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hLMOw2kYtVY" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hLMOw2kYt...</a><br>  <br>  Fashion, love of cars, wanting a bigger house, etc. All lust of the eyes and the flesh. Bible tells us such things are wrong.|`|fTbI4cnSaa	I think Seventh Day Adventists don't believe in celebrating any holidays at all, or birthdays, or anything else they can construe as idolatry. One girl in my junior high school had to leave the room when we said the Pledge of Allegiance because they're opposed to that. As a teenager she turned into what used to be called a juvenile delinquent, so I guess that taking all the joy out of life may not be the most dependable path to spiritual development. However, your friend is right that many of the holidays we celebrate, including Christmas and Easter, have pagan roots and are not strictly Christian.|`|AA11103493	She's right about Christmas in a way, the date chosen was chosen because there was a big pagan festival at that time and the Church was trying to force people to stop being pagan.  Maybe she says valentines day is satanic because it celebrates love, which these days often means sex.  But honestly, she sounds a bit like a nutter to me.|`|FwdBKodSaa	How can anyone on earth say that Christmas is a pagan festival while declaring himself a Christian when we know that Christmas is the feast of Christ's birth??? See, this is why the Adventists are considered a sect next to Jehovah's Witnesses, having nothing in common with Christianity.|`|YJVmL9Ubaa	She's right,christmas,halloween,easter,valenti... day are traced back to satanic origins,the fashion thing she's wrong about,but you do need to study up on the origins of your holidays.|`|mFGyonmTaa	Well, my conclusion is that she has no love life, no family or friends (other than you) with which to spend Christmas, and is fashionably challenged. Upper class indeed...
Iarvsn7yaa	Boloski!!!    HAHHA... I have the answer for you, and I deserve 10 points for this.    You are 100 % right that God asks Abraham to offer his only son Isaac as a sacrifice. Right?    But what does Abraham tell his servants when he takes isaac to be sacrificed???     He tells them something REALLY remarkable that answers your question:    He says to them ".. we (Isaac and I) will go up to the mountain and come down again".     Read it. Abraham KNEW 110% that God would not let anything bad happen to his son. This is really trusting in God all the way. That we should never doubt that He has anything bad in mind for us.|`|BfJP9j4Waa	Bible quoted first born child for sacrifice, and Prophet Ismail (Ishmael) was first born son to Prophet Abraham, not Prophet Ishaq or Isaac.  Later ignorants missinterpreted original Scripture and altered with racist mentality.|`|bb06GQ5Paa	So, did Abraham not like Isaac as much as Ishmael and so he took Isaac instead to be sacrificed?  Would I do it?  I honestly don't know.|`|1ce25e71aa4dd2eb1e82121617a06b87aa	Sacrifice of children at that time was fairly common, like today.    Hell, 1.5 million folks abort every year. What the hell is that?    Nothing has changed.|`|IqqaA2wIaa	no but obviously he trusted God...|`|XN0cYCATaa	That Test was meant for Abraham only, No were else in the Bible has God asked anyone else to take that test, so God wouldn't|`|b1233d2957b6685f6644485ce17a6f62aa	It seems odd to me that eating a piece of forbidden fruit condemned Adam to a lifetime of hard work, Eve to painful labor, and possible damnation for their offspring because it was such a terrible sin.     But Abraham's willingness to stab his child to death on command is considered "righteous".|`|y02PZj22aa	After many years of thinking through all the possible reasons why Abraham, a Godly man, would even consider killing one of his sons to appease God, I now believe that if Abraham did that, it's because he was unduly influenced by his non-Jewish neighbors.  Many other religions, particularly the nature-based ones, did believe that certain natural phenomena were the wrath of their angry gods being visited upon them and they needed blood sacrifices to calm down again.  Perhaps Abraham mistook that philosophy for a directive to himself; who knows?  At any rate, he did come to his senses.    The God I believe in, the one Jesus talked about, isn't out for blood, appeasement, violence, or any of that.  Jesus' God is a god of love who would like for us to live in peace and harmony, helping one another to the best of our ability.      I've wondered how people who claim to be adherents to Jesus' teachings can be so violent and experience blood lust.  I think Shirley Jackson targeted it correctly in The Lottery (even though she was writing about one city and the inhabitants therein).|`|ZhtToZOIaa	This has been cleared later God was just testing His Prophet and Abraham and his only son at that time passed that test.  God replaced Only son of Abraham, with a lamb for sacrifice and this became ritual tradition for Muslims according to Religion.  No need to sacrifice son.  To commemorate that trust of Prophet Abraham, Muslims sacrifice allowed animal each year, as part of Religious ritual.|`|TSCfQTw3aa	It was not God asking Abraham to 'murder' his son. God was testing Abraham's faith. To see if Abraham had enough faith to give back to God the one thing that Abraham loved more than anything. God, who is a merciful God, did not allow Abraham to follow through. God would never ask us to sacrifice on his behalf because no sacrifice is needed. God provided us an eternal sacrifice when he gave us his one and only Son, the one thing that meant more to him than anything else. God was not asking Abraham to act out violence, he was using Abraham to show us how much he loves us. To help us to understand the sacrifice he made for us.|`|bxYWJAYNaa	Yes, but part of the story is missing.  In the long version Isaac was possessed by the Devil, spewing green goo, and biting the heads off chickens. So when God asked for him to be sacrificed, Abraham thought it was all kosher, since the kid was a devil-brat.  And on the altar the devil realised what was about to happen, leapt out of the kid and into a nearby goat, which Isaac sacrificed instead. And they all lived happily ever after.    P.S. Like all good Christians I interpret the stories my own way by filling in the blanks.|`|hZjPYyFTaa	As always depends on how you interpret the story. Child sacrifice was rife among the Semitic peoples. Medieval to Modern scholars believe  that in that age, it was astounding that Abraham's God should have interposed to prevent the sacrifice, not that He should have asked for it.    The Christians then point out he would of been resurrected anyway.|`|iSU0O9W0aa	First of all let me clear one thing, according to Bible, God Almighty asked Abraham to sacrifice his only son, at that time Abraham has Ishmael only, Isaac born later.  Now come to your question.  Muslim / Christians or Jews do not need to sacrifice their son, since God Almighty replaced an animal fro sacrifice. Prophet Abraham and his son did as per God's will.

0yTM98Odaa	Mexicans who are solely of European Spanish decent are definitely white!  In Europe we call the Spanish white, we don't see them as a different race to us and if you go to Spain people range in colouring a lot!  One of my friends who is English and he is naturally tanned like the stereotypical Spanish but he is still white and not a different race.    White does not mean you have to be pale, with light hair etc.      However south Americans can be a mix of European Spanish, and the South American natives etc.|`|1O1ZyEhpaa	I do kind of get what you are saying but I would consider the baby to be biracial Mexican and White.

Where do you think they get their brown skin from? Just because they have white blood in them doesn't make them white any more than my having white blood in me makes me white.    The Mexicans who appear white may have more Spanish blood but they are not only Spanish, in fact most white Mexicans come from brown skinned parents. It's called a recessive gene and it happens in all mixed races that sometimes a child is born darker or lighter than the parents.|`|fia9gMHpaa	Yes that is true. I went to the post office and the list of fugitives had Mexicans under the White race.

Filipinos are Asian, even though they have a mixture of Spanish, Japanese, Chinese, Polynesian, etc.    Latinos isn't considered a race politically, but most people tend to see it that ways anyways, including Latinos themselves! I always hear as if there were a separation between the latinos and the "white man"... haha.|`|iad9mqaXaa	You've never seen a Mexican before?!

1CS2KR7Taa	What you describe at the beginning of your question is simply how society portrays different people, or people groups, so that is how we look at them. We have absolutely no freedom in that we are always brainwashed by the society we live in.<br>  What you say about purpose is a bit complicated, as we humans tend to complicate everything.<br>  Yes, there is an overriding purpose for all of us and in that there is absolutely no difference between people, countries, continents, races, etc.<br>  Unfortunately religions, or politicians cloud this picture and try to divide us, saying that one goal, or way of doing things is better than others.<br>  In truth our purpose is very simple: we have to find the way of uniting mankind into one single organism, based on unconditional giving and love. We do not need to confuse it with "higher entities" we cannot sense at the moment.<br>  It is enough to look at nature, where everything is in harmony, except humanity. We have to learn, that we are part of the system of nature as everything else, and we have to live by the laws of this system, otherwise we destroy it.<br>  We could take example from our own bodies, where in a healthy body the cells only work for the benefit and well being of the whole, while the way we behave at the moment resembles the cancer cells.<br>  So this is our purpose, to correct how we relate to each other. And it is the same for all of us from the President to the drug addict, and so on.<br>  I hope it answers your complex and interesting question.|`|Ll29odpHaa	everyone has purpose but not everyone fulfills their purpose|`|ki8kdpJPaa	Purpose has nothing to do with God, you create your own purpose.|`|3K51tgQWaa	Purpose for what?|`|667fbb3f5754a94cb0e93724d53755a5aa	We ALL matter.

We say they made their own choices.  While that is true, we need to realize that w/out Jesus, we could very well be in the same boat.|`|oxriDchOaa	I've been 3 of those 4 things, and I think "drunk on the street" was the most fun (being unborn was pretty awesome too).

fc61095727fe8a17ac058f0c1b8e3bf2aa	Obviously lots of people shop at Walmart and Walmart is laughing all the way to the bank. I do feel that many Obama supporters didnt understand how big businesses worked and resented that some people were earning very large paychecks as CEOs. They seemed to forget that these people may have taken the personal risk to start the company, employ others often at good wages and benefits, pay a lot in taxes (even with tax breaks) and give a lot to charity and the community.Yes some people did take advantage and did dishonest things but not all businesses.  I find that this is a common difference between Democrats and Republicans no matter who the candidate is.

dcWGYBfYaa	Native Americans have played a vital role in the economic conditions of the United States. For example, every year, Native American tribes contribute significantly to the overall energy production of the U.S. In 1997 alone Native Americans supplied 32 million tons of coal, 270 million mcf of gas, 15 million barrels of oil and 5.5 million tons of construction aggregate. In the same year tribal businesses contributed to the lumber industry by harvesting 650 million board feet of timber.     They have reforested more than 14,000 acres and completed forest improvements on an additional 66,625 acres of land. Native Americans also have made an impact on the fishery programs, and release more than 40 million young salmon and steelhead trout in the Pacific Northwest every year.    Tribal businesses have contributed to $10 billion in wage and salary income to the United States and created more than 300,000 jobs. This has generated more than $4-6 billion in federal tax revenue annually. The Native American art and craft industry generates more than $1 billion every year.     On the state and local government levels, tribal communities contribute $246 million in tax revenues annually, and the combined purchases of goods from reservations total $5.5 billion on an annual basis.     Tribal Business Contributions   http://www.socialworkers.org/diversity/n...  ========================    This is an example of how States benefits from casinos on Native American land.    Sault Ste. Marie, MI  Kewadin Casino brings a total economic output of $325.4 million annually to the Eastern Upper Peninsula     Other key statistics outlined in the report include:  ? $103.1 million gross annual wage impact for the region.  ? 3,001 annual total employment positions in the region.    Benefits from construction (4yr period)  ? $230.3 million in gross economic output   ? $74.6 million in gross earnings impact   ? 1,703 gross employment   http://www.saulttribe.com/index.php?opti...    The STATE set their revenue from the casinos. Here are two examples:    Fiscal effect on government:   Each tribe would pay tens of millions more to the state each year under their amended agreement. If voters approve all four propositions, the increased annual revenue to the state will be roughly $200 million in the next few years and may increase to the low to mid hundreds of millions of dollars in future years.     Indian Casino Agreements  http://www.easyvoter.org/0802/c67.html    The Pequots negotiated the first memorandum on January 13, 1993. It gave them the exclusive right to operate slot machines in return for a monthly contribution of 25% of gross slot machine revenue.     If the tribe's contribution fell below $100 million in any year, the rate would increase to 30% in order to reach a minimum $100 million.  http://www.cga.ct.gov/2001/rpt/olr/htm/2...  ================    Information from the "Marketing/Business Industry"    The Selig Center projects that Native American buying power will rise from $40.8 billion in 2002 to $57.3 billion by 2007.     Entrepreneurship is one of those factors considered to be a major force in behind the growth of Native American buying power.    Native American owned firms primarily in the areas of business services, personal services, and construction industries, outperformed all other groups in terms of receipts.     Marketing to Native Americans /American Indians / First Nation Demographics   http://www.culturalmarketingcommunicatio...  ----------------    The Native American market is a wealthy market, and a market that's grown faster than expected.     In the service, construction and retail sectors, Native American companies are growing faster than U.S. companies as a whole.     The $34 billion in revenue that Native American business owners generated in 1997 represents a 179% increase over 1992, the date of the last Economic Census. At the same time, the number of Native American firms increased by a staggering 84% to nearly 200,000, far outpacing the overall growth in U.S. firms, which grew at just 40%.    Discovering Native America  http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m4...  ---------------    Native Americans are the nation's second-wealthiest minority, behind Asians, reports Alison Stein Wellner in the August American Demographics magazine.    Between 1997 and 1999 the average median income of Native Americans was $30,784, compared to $48,614 for Asians and $26,608 for blacks, according to the U.S.     American Demographics magazine - income of Native Americans  http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0...  .|`|AAgX0SDcaa	My Cherokee ancestors were farmers and worked their butts off, tell me they did less good for society than the Chinese that came here 150 years ago. My daughter is working on a PhD in physics with the help of the Choctaw Nation, those scholarships weren't available during her grandfather's era. She most likely got her math and music abilities  from her Choctaw side, had a conversation at the university with a woman who was majoring in NA studies and knew of her father's ancestors history. Wish you could read the history of the Indian boarding schools and understand the terrible damage that living in those homes did to Natives and their society, both here in the US and Canada.

This includes African Americans, Native Americans, Hispanics and Asians. It appears that Asians take care of each other in the community, value hard work and education and indeed have done well. However, some other minority individuals have also succeeded. There are fewer Asians than some other minorities so its really hard to compare them with other minorities in general. You would have to look at the percentages of each and their education levels and incomes. The Census bureau has that information if you want exact stats.|`|702f83b079a03568e52b59e470049ba4aa	I would like to start off on the right foot and not say anything to offend you. But when you add Native Americans , they were here in the states first.  We took their land and so on and so on.  I believe that most people have made good towards society and they make things better and contribute to being the best they can.  Then there are some who don't want to contribute to being the best they can be not do they work well in society.

nN5zyFPVaa	Well for the "HATE" there are many different reasons todays society looks down at "Emos"  1) Now a days its actually become accepted and encouraged to hate on emos  2) Emo has become todays most stereotyped fashion (by this I mean every one thinks the same thing when they hear emo, sad, cutting, ect.). Of coarse all these traits are considered negative so it leaves that negative karma on the actual fashion.  3) Men in general Judge through courage, strength, and pride. Emo men tend to not show any of these characteristics, and are therefore considered  weak, and looked down upon. Adding more ill Karma.  - As for the "SCARED" I personally dont think there are many people "scared" I just think its all the negetive Karma that the fashion holds( 2&3). Many people pick up on that karma, through others, and naturally avoid it.   - I do just want to point out that I did not mean this to be rude or vulgar in ANY way =).   - You also proclaim your self to be Emo, but as long as your proud of it, eff every one else lol. You should already know your no alien. so enjoy your uniqueness Just dont put it on a pedestule. Sadly this is whats happening with todays Rappers..... and Metal Heads =(   *I just read all this....

My niece and her friends are "emo" Their makeup makes them look like a wild animal,  they cut things like "die" and "help" into their legs and run around telling people they're going to kill themself when they're clearly not.    It's not that I "hate" emos kids. If I were to hate them I would be giving them energy. I prefer to just sit back and wait until the kiddies move on to some other fashion statement.|`|CBNC40sDaa	There is no crime in showing your feelings.  However, it's a question of whether emotions are being displayed for the sake of unnecessary drama and trying to draw attention to yourself.|`|stBzl9Nfaa	Well, I don't hate you (emos), but my point is that life can't can't be taken that way.

Grow up.|`|QkRMZ42paa	Maybe some people don't understand other people's lifestyles,and feel like they should hate them or dislike them. They don't understand their characteristics.

Hope this helps.|`|VLsSuWD4aa	Being Emotional in your home is cool, everyone is Emo in their own privacy but not outside to the world...Its ok to be Emo but don't start crying and being emotional to everyone you meet.

71yXXY3eaa	Pluto, god of the underworld, ruled under the earth.  The riches of the earth were held by Pluto.  Bud he did not have a woman, and Jupiter, king of the gods, gave to him Proserpina, daughter of the goddess Ceres.  Ceres was the goddess of grain and fields.  Proserpina and her friends were walking in a field of Sicily.  Suddenly a chariot of Pluto out of the earth hastened to the girls and Prosperpina was taken away by Pluto.  Proserpina shouted against Pluto and she fought, but Proserpina was carried into the earth by chariot.  The mother of Prosperpina, goddess Ceres, held many concerns.  She was looking out for her daughter.  Without the help of the goddess, the fields were not growing.  Then Mercury, the messenger of the gods, hastened to Pluto.  The plan was: Proserpina reamins with Ceres for six months, and six months with Pluto.  When Proserpina is on land, there are many grains; when under the earth, there are not many grains.|`|a375l0D7aa	Pluto, god of the underworld, ruled under the earth.

The length of days and age of the earth are not the main things. Genesis does say that God created "kinds", and that would mean created living things fully developed.<br>  The theory of evolution says all living things evolved by small changes from a single-cell organism. That is really easy to prove if it is true or false. First, the fossil beds contain billions of fossils stretching over millions of years. The small change by small change fossils do not exist; new life forms appear fully formed without the small transitional links. So Darwinian evolution did not occur in the past.<br>  If small changes are cumulative, all life would blend together. There would be no fixed species; everything would be a transitional. It is obvious that this is not so. So it should be clear that the theory of evolution is false.|`|d2lvgxJhaa	Scientists, the really good ones, generally don't care about religious people only in that the more crazy religious people are stifling science education.

There's no doubt about that, but to say that we humans evolved from a primordial goo is foolish. I do not believe the create account in Genesis is 6 days in the sense that we count days. That would be confining God to our finite existence. The Bible says God created everything in 6 days and rested on the 7th. Nowhere else in the Bible do you see God creating anything else, so essentially, he is still resting. He is still in his 7th day. If that is true, what does that say about the length of the other 6 days? Pretty long, huh?|`|Ne9rXERpaa	Two problems with that...:<br>  <br>  1.) There's no actual evidence suggesting any sort of "god" or other creative entity behind evolution.<br>  <br>  2.) Once you really understand how evolution works, you realize that it doesn't NEED one; and that postulating some invisible deity behind it all is just adding an another unnecessary layer of complication to a very simple and streamlined process.

For example, prior to the introduction of the principles of evolution most people had no reason to doubt the claim that they came from Adam and Eve.|`|4sUek7ugaa	I'm  just reading Karen Armstrong's book on the Bible.  She says that the fact that the redactor included two versions of a creation story and bits of a third (the 'Yahweh fights a sea monster' one which is referred to here and there) is proof that they didn't take it literally, but understood it as a legend about their view of the world.<br>  <br>  In fact, many scholars believe that taking Genesis literally is something that happened only within the last couple of centuries and those before understood the stories as allegory that pointed to a deeper truth.|`|PjwWWMu4aa	Ah, good ol' theistic evolution.<br>  <br>  You're right, of course, that should really be enough for everyone to be happy.

In fact, we talk about domestic terrorism and point to the Oklahoma bomber and others who try to steal, kill, and destroy for the sake of their ideology.  <br>  <br>  Second, they don't always put "Muslim" in front of a person's name.  In fact, in England and France, when  a Jewish person is beat up by Muslim extremists, the papers and news almost never say what culture the perpetrators are from because of the extreme political correctness there is in those countries. <br>  <br>  Last, they didn't put "'Christian" in front of his name because although America is purported to be a "Christian" country and Gallup polls show that a majority of the people identify as Christians, most of the Christians in America are nominal (in name only).

She was the Goddess of prophecy, yet she would only give that gift to evil doers and made sure that no one would believe them.  She used it to punish.  <br>  <br>  Historically, Hera arrived on the scene just after the focus of the worlds religion switched from feminine dominated to masculine, it might have been one of the reasons that the Queen of the Gods was given so little respect.  Hera, unlike many of the other female Deities at the time, did not serve man, she did not play nice to those who disrespected women, and she wasn't very nice to women who served man.  Hera, was the representation of the old religions, by showing her in a bad light, it empowered the male dominated societies.|`|AA11142539	Hera was like the vindictive evil woman in the family of greek gods.

AA12158476	Yes, the economy sucks, but not its not hard to get a job. There are many fields in need of people. Healthcare is just one of many. There is still a need for nurses, nurse aids, physical therapist etc. The economy is going through a serious overhaul and there is no time frame as to when it will recover. Patience. You will get a job, just don't be picky about what you want. Not everyone gets their dream job right out of the gate.|`|1cYPOJkqaa	I know. I'm trying to get a weekend/summer job. My dad told me to just take whatever job I can get, I'll gain experience and it will look better for my cv next year.|`|PeQ40WcWaa	It is a ridiculous situation..... but also.... not everyone with experience can get a job at the moment.    This might sound trite, but please try to think about what you DO have going for you. If you are young, does that mean you still live at home? Or rent, and don't have a mortgage or a family? (i.e. serious commitments)? If so, it means that you are in a much more flexible position than some and could consider taking any job that was offered to you for the money, until the climate improves.    My boyfriend is 37 years old and has over 10 years experience in his sector. We used to live in London and his job was secure, well paid and he had a very good reputation in his industry. A year ago, we moved to another city and since then, he has been through 4 jobs.     He was recently unemployed for 4 months. Then found a job. 2 weeks before Christmas, they let him go because of pay cuts - no warnings or redunancy pay.    It is now the end of January and he is left with barely any jobs to apply for. He has a lifetime of experience, so lower paid jobs are not offered to him because he is 'over qualified'. Jobs at his level are hard to come by at the moment.    On top of this, he has a large mortgage to pay and many responsibilities. If he was 25, he could just up-sticks, move abroad, travel, take any job, anywhere, change career, etc. But this is not an option. The one time he had the guts to change his career, he wanted to join the RAF. Guess what? The maximum starting age is 36! So he can't even do that.    I know times are bad - but the younger you are, the better it is. I'm 24 and I can see this for myself! You have options - think outside the box and sit it out.

The consequence is, the higher the wage, the more experience the employer expects, and the more the employer has to shell out in wages, the fewer employees he can afford to hire.  It's simple economics.      The truth is that entry level, minimum wage jobs aren't intended to support families.  Getting married and having kids on a grocery bagger's or fast food counter person's wages and then demanding an increase because they can't make ends meet at the current level IS ridiculous, but our elected representatives don't care as long as raising the minimum wage gets them more votes.

rNBXHFlcaa	I speak both fluently, but I think they are both equally hard to speak.  Sometimes, the conjugations for English is hard, and sometimes I am not sure to use the correct word in Japanese.<br>  Writing, however, is probably harder for Japanese.  The only part harder about English in writing is the spelling, as one alphabet can be pronounced in different ways.  In Japanese, the "kana" are really simple, as they only make one sound. (besides a few exceptions)<br>  The difficult part of Japanese is the Kanji, since there's like millions of them.  No one can actually write every single one of them, since they're so numerous.  Also, Kanji can be pronounced in different ways, but it's not hard to memorize those, as both are basically the same meaning as the other one.<br>  So  in general, I believe Japanese would be difficult to learn, but if you actually lived in that country and got used to it, both are easy.|`|MMI8S60Vaa	well, japanese does not have as many different sounds. <br>  Also, the verbs do not have many conjugations (like 2)<br>  And, no plurals. <br>  BUT, you do have to learn the kana (which i easy) and kanji (which is deathly hard) to be able to write it in something other than just romaji. <br>  SO, it is probably about the same just speaking it, <br>  And harder if you wanna write it.|`|RXI8ImdIaa	I think any language is really hard to master.

FGcwxZz0aa	From a historical standpoint, in regards to the perpetual virginity of the virgin mother, no one believed that she had other children until the last two hundred years or so due to widespread mistranslation of Scripture and the non-scriptural practice of Sola Scriptura using improper hermeneutics.    When studying Scriptures as a body of work, in context pointing towards the atonement of humanity there is no other reasonable conclusion that one can come to other than the fact that St. Mary had no other children than Jesus. Also the historical and the Biblical accounts confirm that St. Mary was forever virgin. St. Joseph was not chosen as a husband in the normal sense but as the protector of St. Mary's virginity. He was a much older man, likely a widower, chosen by God for this purpose. Let us look at the verses in question....     (Mat 12:46 DRB) As he was yet speaking to the multitudes, behold his mother and his brethren stood without, seeking to speak to him.    (Mat 12:47 DRB) And one said unto him: Behold thy mother and thy brethren stand without, seeking thee.    (Mat 12:48 DRB) But he answering him that told him, said: Who is my mother, and who are my brethren?    (Mat 12:49 DRB) And stretching forth his hand towards his disciples, he said: Behold my mother and my brethren.    (Mat 12:50 DRB) For whosoever shall do the will of my Father, that is in heaven, he is my brother, and sister, and mother.    The Greek noun used here is adelphoi which means brother and it is spelled exactly the same way both times it occurs in these Scriptures. One should note also that there is no such thing in Koine Greek grammar as a familial form of adelphoi. Now it is important to note that the language used here is in itself a translation from Aramaic for adelphoi used in the familiar way. In Aramaic there is no word which would distinguish ones biological brothers from other relatives such as cousins or even step brothers or sisters. The more acceptable term in proper translation would probably be something like brethren instead of brother. When Christ spoke he also used the Aramaic equivalent to adelphoi in the Greek, in a non-familiar sense when he said the following in verse 50, he is my brother.    As you can see with proper exegesis there is nothing in these verses to support the theory that St. Mary was not forever virgin and that she had other children besides Jesus. Please note that in all of Scriptures, no one is specifically called a child of St. Mary other than Jesus.    Please note the following:    (Mat 1:20 DRB) But while he thought on these things, behold the Angel of the Lord appeared to him in his sleep, saying: Joseph, son of David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife, for that which is conceived in her, is of the Holy Ghost.    (Mat 1:21 DRB) And she shall bring forth a son: and thou shalt call his name Jesus. For he shall save his people from their sins.    (Mat 1:22 DRB) Now all this was done that it might be fulfilled which the Lord spoke by the prophet, saying:    (Mat 1:23 DRB) Behold a virgin shall be with child, and bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God with us.    St. Mary was a virgin when she conceived and was a virgin after giving birth.    (Luk 1:26 DRB) And in the sixth month, the angel Gabriel was sent from God into a city of Galilee, called Nazareth,    (Luk 1:27 DRB) To a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David: and the virgin's name was Mary.    (Luk 1:28 DRB) And the angel being come in, said unto her: Hail, full of grace, the Lord is with thee: blessed art thou among women.    (Luk 1:29 DRB) Who having heard, was troubled at his saying and thought with herself what manner of salutation this should be.    (Luk 1:30 DRB) And the angel said to her: Fear not, Mary, for thou hast found grace with God.    (Luk 1:31 DRB) Behold thou shalt conceive in thy womb and shalt bring forth a son: and thou shalt call his name Jesus.    (Luk 1:32 DRB) He shall be great and shall be called the Son of the Most High. And the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of David his father: and he shall reign in the house of Jacob for ever.    (Luk 1:33 DRB) And of his kingdom there shall be no end.    (Luk 1:34 DRB) And Mary said to the angel: How shall this be done, because I know not man?    (Luk 1:35 DRB) And the angel answering, said to her: The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the Most High shall overshadow thee. And therefore also the Holy which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God.    The verses preceding show that she intended to remain a virgin when she said to the angel Gabriel, I know not man. Please notice in the following verses in St. Johns account of the crucifixion of St. Mary being put into the care of St. John. If she had other children and especially other male children the Jewish tradition would be that she would have been cared for by them. Jesus knowing the hardship of a childless widow placed her in good hands with St. John.     (Joh 19:26 DRB) When Jesus therefore had seen his mother and the disciple standing whom he loved, he saith to his mother: Woman, behold thy son.    (Joh 19:27 DRB) After that, he saith to the disciple: Behold thy mother. And from that hour, the disciple took her to his own.    Last of all there is the difficulty of history and Sacred Tradition to overcome, which has always, without exception, called her the Blessed Virgin.     In Christ  Fr. Joseph|`|LjsRfaskaa	It is now accepted that the word 'virgin' actually translates as 'a young unmarried women', not someone who has not had a physical relationship.

That is part of the confusion for Catholics and non-Catholics alike. There are many long standing "traditions" that Catholic people believe that are not officially supported by the Church.    ADD: Many Protestants are also sometimes confused about which beliefs are canon and which are tradition.    The simple fact that much of religion is cultural, and different people from different cultures often interpret the same information in different ways has lead to the plethora of denominations.    That is why it is so hypocritical for one Christian denomination to criticize another over details.

You can't.  Remember two things, though  a) the bible did not exist for the first 300 years of Christianity.  None of the apostles had a bible - yet they were Christian and taught Christianity without it.  b) not everything that happened to all of the people in the bible is recorded.  In fact, not everything that happened to ANY people in the bible is recorded.  My point is:  there are histories of some of these people apart from the bible, and the bible is silent on these particular points regarding Mary.    SO, for a Protestant who follows the doctrine of "only Scripture", it seems odd that any Christian would make use of a non-Scriptural doctrine.  But, *all* Christians for the first 300 years of Christianity made use of non-Scriptural doctrines.  They made use of the doctrines that had been handed down to them by the apostles.  We can say with *certainty* that ALL of the early Christian doctrines practiced by the apostles were non-Scriptural, as the first gospels could not have been completed until at least a few months after the resurrection and ascension of Jesus.    SO, back to the specific issue:  the "ever virginity" of Mary is a doctrine that is seen even before the first bibles were put together.  The idea that Mary was NOT a virgin after Jesus' birth is a relatively recent one - a Protestant one.  Notice the first paragraph here - the Oriental Orthodox churches separated from the main Christian church in 451.  By that time, the universal Christian doctrine of an ever-virgin Mary already existed. (By "universal" I mean that *all* Christians accepted this doctrine at this time).  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perpetual_v...    The "immaculate conception" thing is much more recent, but it, too, has roots that predate the very first bibles.    SO, were these ancients - who had received the teachings handed down orally from the apostles themselves - wrong, or are the Protestant reformers of the 16th century wrong?  Who is more likely to have accurate information regarding this topic?    PERSONALLY, it doesn't matter to me.  However, the doctrine of "ever virgin" is certainly not contrary to Scripture.  The doctrine of "immaculate conception" does appear to me to be contrary to Scripture - but certainly believing such a thing will not cause anyone to lose their salvation.  It is clearly not a sin to believe that Mary's conception was immaculate!    Jim, http://www.bible-reviews.com/selector_rc...|`|AA10067344	None of those things are in the Bible.  They are all a part of the Catholic oral Tradition.    Edit:  In response to the poster "Free Stuff in 2012" a couple of answers down:  They most certainly are official teachings of the church.  In fact, Ineffabilis Deus and Munificentissimus Deus, which established the immaculate conception and assumption of Mary respectively, are two of only seven times the Church has invoked papal infallibility.|`|Q1XUe0PDaa	Who is the only person who can make God wash behind His ears.

That idea itself is unbiblical, and no Christian on earth ever heard of it until a few hundred years ago.

"WHATSOEVER you bind upon earth is bound in heraven" ... "the Holy Spirit will guide you into ALL TRUTH" ... "He who hears you hears Me".

I like many Protestants thought that the Christian faith started with the Bible.  Actually Christianity started with the life and Death of Christ which is about 300 years older than the first canonized Bible.    I am leaving you a link that explains the Catholic Belief about Mary,  When you understand it along with the history of the Bible and the Early Church, it really fits together perfectly.    One thing to note is that the great Protestant Reformers Calvin and Luther both believed in the Perpetual Virginity of Mary, so the heresy that Mary had other Children is really recent.    Most Mainstream Protestants even now believe in the immaculate conception.      If you look, Sola Scriptura is also not in the Bible.  Jesus left us his Church at Pentecost, (33 AD) along with the Holy Spirit.  The Church under the direction of the Holy Spirit gave us the Bible about the year 300.  If all Jesus wanted us to use was a book, he would have written one.    It was a study of the early Church and the beginning of the faith, the Sacraments that eventually (20 years later)  led me to the Catholic Church.

Yes, those are just a few!     And from my favorite pamplet, Consecrate Yourself To Mary: O Immaculata, Queen of Heaven and earth, refuge of sinners and our most loving Mother, God has willed to entrust the entire order of mercy to you.

The same sacrifice of Jesus did apply to her but before she was conceived so she did need a savior but her salvation was before she was conceived. This is why the angel of the Lord said to her "Hail Mary, full of grace" One that is born with sin is NOT full of grace eh?  The Virgin Mary is the new Ark of the Covenant and Joseph for sure knew what happened to the men that touched the old Ark---death and besides he had just been told whose child she was carrying---what makes you think he would even want to have relations after that---he fully understood what his role was at that point. He was to be a eunuch after the eunuchs in the story of Esther. Joseph was already a father by a previous marriage and so had other children who was called Jesus brothers and sisters. The Blessed Virgin Mary was assumed into Heaven by Jesus after her "death" or dormition ---her falling asleep. This is not so hard to understand. Several people in the Old Testament were raised into Heaven---why wouldn't he also raise his own Mother? Honor your Father AND your Mother. If you were God, how would you honor your Mother?---She is queen of Heaven and Earth. In the old days the queen was always the Mother. There were too many wives so in order to eliminate any problems between them the Mother was always made queen.   Doesn't Scripture say the Paracleet will lead you into the truth in all things?  How could some of the things that have come up since the Bible was written---Stem Cell Research, Cloning etc---how could these things have been written about in Scripture when they hadn't been thought about yet---it is the Holy Spirit that reveals things to us. So these things are Tradition and revelation.|`|R4RsQxJEaa	You Can't. This is unbiblical teachings, traditions of the Catholic Church.|`|k4WlqPK7aa	they believe she conceived the jesus w/o sex. this is obviously false and one of the tenants of christianity. this belief will land you in the hell if you subscribe to the teachings of the mohammed.|`|hiOeQZVsaa	You won't find them in Scripture, as Scripture is about the life of her Son, Jesus.    Catholics believe that only a woman totally free from sin would be chosen to give birth to God's Son.  The Church made up those rules about Mary.|`|AyPF2TFlaa	From Conception to Cross to Ascension (964-965)    Mary's role flows directly from Christ. She stood at the cross, consented to the immolation of her Son and then received the beloved disciple at Jesus' Words, Woman, behold your son" (Jn 19:26-27). After Jesus' Ascension, she aided the early Church by her prayers and implored the gift of the Spirit who had already overshadowed her in the Annunciation.  Being Assumed into Heaven (966)    Pope Pius XII declared Mary's Assumption. "When the course of her earthly life was finished, she was taken up body and soul into heavenly glory." The Assumption is Mary's unique participation in Christ's Resurrection and an anticipation of our resurrection. "In your Dormition you did not leave the world, O Mother of God, but were joined to the source of Life" (Byzantine Liturgy).  A Unique Member (967-968)    Mary adhered to the Father's will, to her Son's work and to the Spirit's promptings. She is a wholly unique member of the Church. By fully cooperating in the redemption "she is a mother to us in the order of grace" (Second Vatican Council).  Annunciation to Assumption (969-970)    This motherhood began by her consent at the Annunciation which she unwaveringly sustained at the cross. Her motherhood continues until the fulfillment of all the elect. She has never set aside this saving office of intercession and is invoked as Advocate, Helper, and Mediatrix. (Second Vatican Council).    Mary's function does not diminish Christ's unique mediation. As the priesthood of Christ is shared in various ways, so the unique mediation of the Redeemer has many cooperators.  Devotion to Mary (971)    Mary said that "all generations will call me blessed" (Lk 1:48). From ancient times the Church has honored her as "the Mother of God." The Church has special devotion to Mary which differs essentially from the adoration given to the Trinity. Her liturgical feasts and the rosary ("the epitome of the whole Gospel") express this devotion.  Mary - What We Will Be (972)    In Mary we can see what the Church will someday be when she arrives home after a long journey. In heaven, the Church is awaited by her Mother. In the meantime, Mary is the beginning of a Church to be perfected on earth and hope to God's people.|`|I0aosHnuaa	do the catholic cult understand that we know the disgusting pope is the richest man in the world while millions starve and suffer ... and all the time there is NO god ... a truly CRIMINAL situation..|`|qyoXSdPCaa	Catholicism asserts that Mary never sinned and, hence, was redeemed (saved) from the moment of her birth:     "By the grace of God Mary remained free of every personal sin her whole life long." Pg. 124,  493  "Espousing the divine will for salvation whole-heartedly, without a single sin to restrain her, she gave herself entirely to the person and to the work of her Son..." Pg. 124,  494     "Mary is the most excellent fruit of redemption (SC 103): from the first instant of her conception, she was totally preserved from the stain of original sin and she remained pure from all personal sin throughout her life." Pg. 128  508 (See also Pg. 191,  722)      If you are wondering if this doctrine is taught in God's Word, it isn't. The Catechism admits that it is another church tradition:     "Through the centuries the Church has become ever more aware that Mary, 'full of grace' through God, was redeemed from the moment of her conception." Pg. 123,  491     But the Bible identifies Jesus as the sinless One, not Mary:     "For he hath made him (Jesus) to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him." 2 Corinthians 5:21     Aside from the Lord Jesus, the Bible is quite clear that nobody else has ever been sinless:     "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;" Romans 3:23  "As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:" Romans 3:10     "They are all gone out of the way, they are together become unprofitable; there is none that doeth good, no, not one." Romans 3:12        Notice, none of these verses say "all have sinned, except Mary."     "But the scripture hath concluded all under sin..." Galatians 3:22     Mary knew she needed a Savior     In Luke's gospel, Mary herself admits that she was a sinner. Otherwise she would never have concluded that she needed a Saviour:     "And Mary said, My soul doth magnify the Lord, And my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour." Luke 1:46-47      Yet, the Catholic church demands that members worship Mary:     "The Church' s devotion to the Blessed Virgin is intrinsic to Christian worship." Pg. 253,  971     Did Jesus exalt Mary?     Here's how Jesus referred to His mother when Mary asked to see Him one day:     "Who is my mother? and who are my brethren? And he stretched forth his hand toward his disciples, and said, Behold my mother and my brethren!     For whosoever shall do the will of my Father which is in heaven, the same is my brother, and sister, and mother." Matthew 12:48-50     Jesus did not say, "Usher in this blessed woman."Rather, He replied that anyone who obeys God' s Word is equal with Mary. Jesus refused to exalt her.     When Others Exalted Mary     When a woman came to Jesus and attempted to exalt Mary, look how the Lord responded:     "... a certain woman of the company lifted up her voice, and said unto him, Blessed is the womb that bare thee, and the paps which thou hast sucked. But he said, Yea rather, blessed are they that hear the word of God, and keep it." Luke 11:27-28      Jesus announces that those who hear and obey the Word of God are blessed above Mary. Perhaps the Lord inserted these verses for those today who choose to ignore the Word of God so they can follow church traditions.         Jesus is robbed of glory and honor that He alone deserves. Rather than recognizing Him as the only sinless One, Catholicism contradicts Scripture and insists that Mary was also sinless. Why?     Was Mary sinless from birth? Catholic tradition wants you to believe she was, but God' s Word says she wasn' t. Who will you believe?     "For there is not a just man upon earth, that doeth good, and sinneth not." Ecclesiastes 7:20  "Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned:" Romans 5:12|`|b3835ed6ecba00bbca3e1188d38ea41caa	"Mary was conceived by her mother immaculately (free of original sin)"    Only this part has concrete scriptural support. Matthew 1:28 says: "The angel went to her and said, "Greetings, full of Grace! The Lord is with you." Catholics would argue that one can only be "full of Grace" if they are devoid of sin completely.     It should be noted that Protestant Bibles do not translate the Greek in this way, but rather as "highly favored". However, "full of grace" is a more accurate translation.|`|GMmmbLGRaa	The Catholic Church, vatican se and Pope are the anti-christ.|`|67e4501c0c56a505b86d4b14fc9a8330aa	"Mary was conceived by her mother immaculately (free of original sin), remained a virgin perpetually, and was assumed bodily into heaven."     These are not found in Scripture, but then the idea that Scripture is the sole basis for faith is also not in Scripture.

It never contained the fullness of the faith, and no one even claimed it did until around 1500.     Disbelieving perpetual virginity is likewise a new tradition. In fact, Luther, Calvin, and Zwingli all believed in it.    The immaculate conception and the bodily assumption are not explicit in scripture, though there are reasons to believe in them. The following link has good details on these and other issues.  http://www.catholic.com/library/mary_sai...|`|QyoZq1z2aa	First and foremost the brochure is wrong and was probably published by a protestant source as part of the continuing religious propaganda thrown out by both sides.  However the most venemous attacks you will see will be anti-catholic, as verbal tradition supporting the protestant separation from the Catholic Church 500 years ago is alive and well.  Most followers of religions are non-saved persons and are much like football team fans.  They have been indoctinated to pour their time and money into their favorite team, which in the case of religion is too often the one that will get them to heaven with the least amount of work.    It is the faithful you must seek counsel from and not the "religious".  There are a number of sights that offer Catholic bible study information, which details there beliefs pertaining to the Mother of God.  You even have some good answers prior to mine.  Remember that you are reading a Protestant Bible.  When Luther and his other followers were breaking away from the Catholic Church they threw out 7 books and parts of others from the Catholic Bible.  You probably have the King James, which is Protestant.  Good luck in your quest for rightousness my brother.|`|Aip88gMKaa	The VirginMary was repeatedly  prophesized in the Old Testament  straighforwardly and in language synonymous to a sinless virgin.

In most of the Scandinavian countries, the couples are unmarried but they are indeed stable.  It's an accepted part of their culture.    However, in the US, that model doesn't really seem to work.  In this country, marriage is still something that's valued and desired.  The system is set up to where married people have an advantage over unmarrieds. Not fair, but that's the way it is.     Statistically, in the US cohabiting couples have higher rates of poverty, and the likelihood of divorce once they marry is higher than those who don't live together before marriage. Yes, more couples are living together, but I think it's unrealistic to see people suddenly stop believing in marriage.  Sometimes some of the people who are part of those couples who claim that they don't 'believe' in marriage aren't always telling the truth.  Usually one wants marriage, the other doesn't but the one who wants marriage doesn't always want to break up the relationship because they figure half a loaf is better than none at all. They are afraid of being alone...and that is the truth they won't admit to anyone, not even themselves.|`|qCr1dNspaa	1. Religion--It all stems from there.

XN0cYCATaa	The Bible does not address this issue because it was not around at the time.  But, No, sex change operations are not okay.  God created people as male and female (Gen. 1:27).  People are ordained by God to be male or female because it is He who forms them in the womb:    Isaiah 44:2, "Thus says the Lord who made you and formed you from the womb, who will help you, Do not fear, O Jacob My servant; and you Jeshurun whom I have chosen."   Isaiah 44:24, "Thus says the Lord, your Redeemer, and the one who formed you from the womb, 'I, the Lord, am the maker of all things...'"        Therefore, to change the sex of a person through an operation is a violation of the natural birth sex that God has ordained for the person.  It also violates the distinction of those attributes which designate a male from a female.  Furthermore, if, for example, a male becomes a woman and has relations with a male, then this would be homosexuality another sin clearly forbidden by scripture.       If anything, this sexual identity dysfunction is due to sin in the world.  Transsexuals (those who have changed sexes) and claim to be Christian cannot appeal to the problem of  a "biological goof" due to sin in the world.  It is on account of sin and its effects, that such an issue of transsexualism even exists and an appeal to a sinful state should never excuse further sin.       Nevertheless, we are not to abandon the transsexual.  Even though it is sin, the transsexual is still a person in need of full redemption, love, grace, and kindness.  We do not convince someone to repent by condemning and accusing.  Rather, they need to see the love of Christ in us so that His presence might convict and convince them of their sin.|`|A01w1dHqaa	Sin is a lack of love. We can tell if we are lacking love by whether or not we are happy. If you think it will make you happier, well, we are really only happy when we give to others.|`|FpMS47sXaa	I do not believe so, no.    to live a life as someone you are not is, in my opinion, one of the greatest sins one can commit.|`|qCtbizzPaa	Nothing in the bible about that.

Give me a moment and I'll edit this answer with something you NEED to read.    edit: The following was written by an unknown author.  We didn't ask to born this way; God made us this way for his own reasons and we should not question why.  I believe transitioning allows us to better serve Him.  To the the article I found online:        ""The Gift"    Wouldn't it be refreshing to see transsexualism viewed as a positive good instead of a negative, or at best neutral, phenomenon? Some psychologists characterize it as a sexually motivated disorder; psychiatrists treat it as an aberration imprinted by upbringing. Transsexuals themselves see it as a curse.    But what if they're all wrong? What if these characterizations fail to describe what transsexualism really is? What if instead we try to look at transsexualism as a gift; and not just any gift, but a gift created by Almighty God Himself and deliberately bestowed by Him on certain chosen individuals to fulfill His divine plan. Zounds! Awesome! Radical! Yes, and frightening, too.      God reveals a vision of His gifts to us in all their wonderful diversity through Paul: "There are different gifts but the same Spirit; there are different ministries but the same Lord; there are different works but the same God who accomplishes all of them in everyone. To each one the manifestation of the Spirit is given for the common good...preaching, teaching, faith, healing, miracles, prophesy, recognizing spirits, tongues and the interpretation of tongues. All these are the manifestation of one and the same Spirit, who distributes different gifts to different people just as he chooses" (1 Cor 12:4-11).     What's that? You didn't see transsexualism in the list?  Paul does not pretend that this short list includes all of God's gifts to us. He itemizes more in Romans 12:6-8 and Jesus names others in the Beatitudes such as meekness, thirst for justice, peacemaking and the rest. Indeed there are many gifts - named and unnamed - given to us "for the common good".     So why not transsexualism? There is not one shred of evidence that this is not a divine gift. Of course when most people think of divine gifts they think of musical ability, artistic talent, intelligence, charisma, good health, etc., but that is obviously too narrow a view. In a very touching story Jesus showed even blindness could be a gift: "He saw a man who had been blind from birth. His disciples asked him, 'Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, for him to have been born blind?' 'Neither he nor his parents sinned, Jesus answered, 'he was born blind so that the works of God might be displayed in him'." (Jn 9:2-3) Then He gave the man sight.     Christians have always had difficulty comprehending how a loving, good, and merciful God could permit conditions that are contrary to their concept of good. Birth defects, arthritis, an untimely death, - all the frailties of human existence - seem cruel. Some ascribe these to sin while others become callous or turn against their God. Their faith is lacking and Jesus calls them blind: "If you were blind, you would not be guilty, but since you say, 'We see,' your guilt remains." (Jn 9:41)     Is it not possible that even these so called evils are also gifts of God? And perhaps not just gifts to those stricken, but to all of us - to give us an opportunity to show care and love for all our brothers and sisters. Consider the story of the Good Samaritan: Was not the victim an opportunity for the Levite, the priest, and the Samaritan to show love for another human being? But only the Samaritan saw the "gift" in the situation and helped the victim.     In the same way Christians and others often fail to comprehend how transsexuality could be God's blessing to certain chosen persons - for their benefit and the benefit of us all. Instead, some set themselves up as judges and condemn what their pride cannot accept. "You must love your neighbor as yourself; but as soon as you make distinctions between classes of people, you are committing sin", James warns them. Besides, "who are you to give a verdict on your neighbor?" (Jam 2:9, 4:12) Jesus Himself told Peter: "What God has made clean, you have no right to call profane." (Acts 11:9)     However, any gift may be used for good or evil. Everything God has created is good but its ultimate value depends on what we do with it. If we realize that it can no longer remain a mere aberration to be tolerated. Rather, it becomes a positive good - a calling or vocation. It is right and morally good to express it and morally wrong to suppress it.  See what power, what confidence, what affirmation we gain from accepting this as a gift! "If God is with us, who can stand against us?" (Rom 8:31) But wait! Before we charge off to conquer the world, take note: God's gifts do not come without strings. Remember the parable of the talents (Matt 25:14-30)?    Three servants were given gifts. Two dared to risk their gifts in investments and won a profit. The third suppressed his gift - and it was ripped from him and he was thrown out. If the two had risked and failed, would they have been punished? I think not. God does not allow us to be tested beyond our strength (1 Cor 10:16). The point is, the two acknowledged their gifts and accepted them. With faith in their master they tried and succeeded.     God's gifts are His investments in us and He expects a return on the investment. Paul's advice to Timothy applies equally to us: "You have in you a spiritual gift... do not let it lie unused" (1Tim4:14). The third servant did not use his gift and it was taken from him. The fig tree that did not bear fruit was ordered to be cut down (Lk 13:7-8). The Spirit who distributes these gifts "just as he chooses" gives some more gifts than others. Do not envy them; for the more they have been given, the more wil|`|mNyhRGowaa	no because you have not acted on it yet.  sorry I misread your question, you mean you haven't had surgery?|`|FhHklqkhaa	your soul feels you are the wrong gender so it can't be a sin|`|BZEN8QXbaa	Nope.. :)|`|bxYWJAYNaa	No, you are just very unlucky to have to face that sort of problem in life.

I became angry with them. When my  best friend came out of the closet, I realized that love isn't a sin and I reexamined myself, my beliefs.  So I'm bisexual.

46e820e9ba704c6776305bf6a1b991efaa	No.  There is only one true religion according to the Bible.  Any religion that teaches this doctrine is a false religion,  The Bible says that when you die you know nothing.  Ecc 9: 5,6. If you know nothing when you die, how can you be burned.  Also the Bible says that souls die, they hunger, get sick, thirst.  So we are a soul, we do not have a soul.  So there is nothing to burn after we die.  The Bible uses fire to symbolize complete destruction.  Not torture. God will soon destroy death and the grave.  Rev 20:14 says that death and hades (or the grave) are hurled into the lake of fire.  This is symbolic of complete destruction of death and the grave.  See Rev 21:4. This means that we will never die so no need for graves.  This all happens after the resurrection of the righteous and the unrighteous.  They will be resurrected to a judgement of a thousand years.  Not tortured.  Death is the payment for our sins.  Even those who do not accept God will be resurrected for another chance.  They will be judged not on what they do now, but what they do during the thousand year judgement.  The only ones who do not get resurrected are the ones that sin against the holy spirit such as Judas, Adam and Eve, Saul, the Jewish leaders that persecuted Jesus, etc. People who were destroyed by God will also not be resurrected such as the people of Sodom and Gomorrah, people who died during the flood.  That was their judgement.  Soon God will bring Armageddon and destroy evil people once and for all.  All those who survive this destruction will never have to die.  God does not make people worship him.  It is there free will to do so.  All those who do worship him have many blessings. But God is love.  He knows how religious leaders have actually pushed people away from Him.  All religions but one have actually been an enemy of God.|`|yHfsHp6naa	It sounds to me like you DO understand it.|`|gIitANOkaa	well yeah...|`|VYLEfiSTaa	The scriptures are in full harmony with what you and I and every other sane, reasonable person in the world shall concede to be the reasonable and proper character of our God. What is declared of our heavenly Father? That he is just, that he is wise, that he is loving, that he is powerful. All Christian people will acknowledge these attributes of the divine character. If this is so, can we find any sense of the word in which we could conceive of God as just and yet punishing a creature of His own hand to all eternity, no matter what the sin was? I am not an apologist for sin; I do not live in sin myself, and I never preach sin. .?.?. But I tell you that all these people around here that our brothers says are making the air blue with their blasphemies of God and the holy name of Jesus Christ are all people who have been taught this doctrine of eternal torment. And all the murderers, thieves and evil doers in the penitentiaries, were all taught this doctrine. .?.?. These are bad doctrines; they have been injuring the world this long time; they are not a part of the Lord’s teaching at all, and many of our dear brothers and Sisters have not gotten the smoke of the dark ages rubbed out of their eyes yet.|`|bxYWJAYNaa	Yes, that's right.<br>  <br>  The moral of that one is to live a life of sin, and satiate all your lusts to the extreme, and then repent and accept Christ on your death bed.<br>  <br>  There is no particular advantage to living a life of virtue.<br>  <br>  The only condition is that the repentance must be genuine.|`|CThuHfV3aa	Its so much more than just easy steps like that. You must repent (Feel completely guilty and want to change) for what you have done. Accepting Christ to not only to be your saviour but be your life is a major step. He will spiritually make you aware to what is right and wrong. He will change who you are into something He wants you to be. Something much better. Sounds corny but true. Good deeds can do nothing because God standards are much higher than ours. A sin is automatic punishment for death and damnation. It was adam's fault for original sin. It is like genetics. It passes down from one man to another. So were screwed either way. But God offers a way out, Accepting His son will not only give us eternal life but change the one we have now into something much more meaningful. I was atheist until 17 and I am only 18 now.

Epigenetics are related to every thing in your life. From places you go, what you drink, and what you eat, to how many times you scraped your knees or what medicines you have taken. Epigenetics are what turn parts of your DNA on and off, because obviously, not all parts of your DNA are active all the time, in every cell (for instance, parts of your DNA for growing toenails, are not active in your liver).     DNA in twins is the same through out their life, but their epigenetics change. New born twins will have the same epigenetics, by five, there are many differences, and by 13 you would never know that they were twins.  --  "Why do so many try to hide it"      Because society as a general whole looks down upon it.

3a72ae0c30ef90de390ceb62b46fb44aaa	Hope this helps:<br>  <br>  A wake is a ceremony associated with death. Traditionally, a wake takes place in the house of the deceased, with the body present; however, modern wakes are often performed at a funeral home.<br>  <br>  The English word "wake" originated from the ancient Indo-European root "wog" or "weg," meaning "to be active." This evolved into several meanings, including "growth" ("vegetable"), "to become or stay alert," and "watching or guarding." The third also evolved into the word "watch," and it is in this sense that people have a "wake" for someone who recently died"[1]. While the modern usage of the verb "wake" is to "become or stay alert", a "wake" for the dead harks back to the antiquated "watch or guard" sense. This is contrary to the urban legend that people at a wake are waiting in case the deceased should "wake up."[2]<br>  <br>  Departure customs such as 'emigrant wakes' were a marked feature in Ireland during the 19th Century.[3]|`|sMTVcfiVaa	I bet it's because it's a celebration of a person's life following in the wake of the funeral.

Other phrases were dead ringer - they would tie a string and bells to the persons toe so they could raise the alarm, so they would say that's a dead ringer for John  if they weren't quite dead.  I would guess that pull the other one it's got bells on is also from this.|`|i5FP4Vbraa	Because the Irish have big respect for the recently departed.  In some wakes, the body of the deceased is placed in a sitting position so that folk who knew him/her can come in and speak to their departed friend relative or even enemy.<br>  <br>  It's a Celtic thing really, probably best described as supporting the bodies of fallen hero's in battle and arranging them in such as manner that they form a memorial, with their swords, chariots etc.  This memorial to the fallen can then be seen by everyone passing that way while the bodies slowly rot away.<br>  <br>  The Irish have held on to a vast amount of their ancient culture and the reason for this is that they refuse to change that much and are not very fond of new ideas.<br>  <br>  Celtic<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfngXJMyoS4&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfngXJMyo...</a><br>  <br>  Being Irish or just plain Celtic, is a way of life in and out of time, thus departure from this time into the next is but a short part of the Celtic belief that life flows onward forever through time and into the next time beyond and so forth unto the beginning and that there is no end, ever.<br>  <br>  Look down into a dark pool and see your reflection.

And they called it a "wake" because they were making sure he wasn't awake.  THat wasn't the story excatly but pretty much.|`|akU8QQ83aa	I'm pretty sure its something to do with the fact that way way back people used to have parties with the dead body in the room.<br>  <br>  The idea was to make lots of noise etc and make sure that the person was really dead.

hoOU6HDbaa	To a certain extend, NO and YES.    No - He or she may look like an idiot and a hypocrite if it is too obvious. Like boastful or "over" dressed, which people might think they are "weird". Some try so hard that they act clumsy, look silly & make a fool of themselves. ( like Mr Bean)  LOL.     Yes - First impression is important though. Sometimes we got to impress people that are new to us. Like going for interviews, public speaking or dates.   Most of us are guilty of such in one way or another. I personally like people meeting me or come to my home to impress me. For instance, they try to dress their best & bring gifts. LOL! We are human and those are quite normal.  Yet at home or casual meeting family or friends, will be a put off, especially if they try very hard with impressive words & gestures.|`|M9LB94FHaa	no way|`|kjKuaPMbaa	no if your too cockey its a turn off|`|NKpZGdtraa	It's 50/50 because he's making the effort on trying to impress you but them he's not acting like himself|`|j1cyoB2gaa	you mean some one who comes off as conceited, arrogant, or really just , cocky....

A few go overboard doing this and that is certainly a turn off. so i must say, if a person is trying too hard to impress people, majority would not like him/her.|`|8j7FCEOraa	No, arrogance, cocki-ness, and conceitedness aren't turn ons.    A real woman can see threw the bullshit.|`|mHqVnPWJaa	no|`|wbkzpYhRaa	No, it's a turn off.|`|09zVUMBRaa	It depends on what he's doing to make himself impressive.

If I am interviewing you, then you should be pointing out the more impressive parts of your experience and past jobs so that I may see the good stuff.

Just be yourself.|`|QePbhS8Caa	Usually not, because they often go overboard and come off looking like buffoons. A little charm, a little effort on appearance, a little thought into actions is fine. Too much charm and you risk coming off like a used car salesman. Too much effort into your look and you might seem vain. If you over plan or plan too big, you can come off looking conceited or uptight. It's a fine line.    And you should not boast of accomplishments or brag about who you know.|`|EZdRYJXraa	No I don't like this kind of persons.

AA11048813	In the spirit world,if it exists, there is no age...|`|BiZlaQJnaa	When you die your soul either goes to Heaven or it goes to Hell. <br>  To go to Heaven you must get down on your knees and ask God to save your soul and repent of all your sins and believe that his son Jesus Christ died on the cross and spent three days in Hell and rose again. And believe it and read the Bible and pray and go to a good church.<br>  If you don't your soul will spend eternity in Hell with fire and pain and torture. Bible talks about a man who was so thirsty that on tiny drop of water would satisfy his thirst.<br>  But if you accept Jesus you get to live in paradise with no pain no sickness and no hurt.|`|AA10529303	Your spirit will be a form of energy, however, should you appear to someone on the earth plane you will be seen as what they remember you as.

I have also struggled with this one a bit but I think that I have it down. In heaven, which is where our spirits go when we die, we live on forever, for eternity. This means our spirits have really no age when we enter heaven. So, I think that when we go to heaven our spirits will just be, without age but rather significance to God. That is what I think on the subject.|`|RhDPB70Baa	No, it doesn't.  It doesn't stay old either.

People just use religion as an excuse for their real motivations.|`|b06d5f5c50bd7cf1d8a2a3aedfcc1c94aa	No men would thing up some other excuse to fight.

d0945a07b59dce3ca7393bc610216aa9aa	I think atheists comment more on the idea of heaven and hell because these are extremely popular concepts they deal with every day, from theists who view "God" as a spiteful and sadistic tyrant who allows "his children" to burn in hell eternally because they displease him.<br>  <br>  Most atheists don't accept the idea of a soul. Those who allow for the possibility of continued existence are more likely to consider reincarnation because it makes more sense than heaven/hell. Carl Sagan allowed for the possibility of reincarnation in his book "Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark," in which he gleefully debunked most paranormal beliefs (including organized religion). Sagan wrote: "At the time of writing there are three claims in the ESP field which, in my opinion, deserve serious study:... (3) that young children sometimes report the details of a previous life, which upon checking turn out to be accurate and which they could not have known about in any way other than reincarnation. I pick these claims ... as examples of contentions that might be true."|`|eBKJRmEgaa	Um, have you got that backwards?<br>  Most atheists DON'T believe in heaven or hell, in face I've never met one that does.

Why would you say that atheists believe in such childishness? Reincarnation is altogether a different animal.|`|ridu0Rtwaa	What an outrageously silly idea completely ignorant of what an atheist is!!<br>  <br>  ATHEIST -  someone who does not believe in a God – any God – not just the Christian one.  But that does not mean they do not hold strong moral or religious beliefs!  They can follow any religion that does not have a god and there are a lot of those!!<br>  <br>  Like BUDDHISM – Religious teaching from Buddha and his followers that by destroying greed, hatred and delusion (the cause of all suffering) man can attain perfect enlightenment!!<br>  <br>  But to believe in anything connected to a god such as your heaven and hell would mean they were not atheists but agnostics!!<br>  <br>  AGNOSTIC – Does not believe anything can be know about or proved about a god.  Thus they can still believe a god exists.  This description obviously fits a lot of Christians!!!<br>  <br>  Why are Christians so afraid of people who simply do not believe in any god?!!!! Surely it can only be because they are so afraid that atheist are right and they are wrong or it would not bother them!!!!!!|`|QC94lBXOaa	I don't know ANY atheist that believes in heaven or hell.|`|yHfsHp6naa	I've never met an atheist who believes in heaven or hell.|`|PjwWWMu4aa	I certainly don't.|`|Jsqlkb3caa	Can you please point me in the direction of an atheist that believes in heaven or hell?

c41f417a3060cfc6a7f3b78b167af409aa	i think that was extremely rude.  the professor was probably TRYING to ensure that no other classmates misheard/remembered incorrect information, however did not go about it the right way.     if you are really bothered by this, you should talk to your professor, but be polite, upfront, and professional about it.  it will show that you are assertive and you care about your reputation.  do not wait too long to do this.  if that is too much, then write an email.    sorry that happened to you.  it really sucks to be made to feel like an idiot like that...good luck|`|de947568c9e8173e12d8a9930bab48abaa	He's an asshole, abusing his position to be petty at your expense, just ignore him, remember, those who can, do and those who can't, teach.|`|WwXrTQgaaa	Yeah it was rude but honestly some of the professors I enjoyed most were rude and did things just like that.

6bd5dc5ab362e218189d7e6247b7a2f6aa	I am a former disability examiner for the social security administration's disability programs. I've also worked in representation. <br>  <br>  It typically takes about 4 months to get an answer on an initial disability claim, or disability application. If you get denied on your application, and seventy percent of all applicants do, then you should file for your first appeal, known as the request for reconsideration. <br>  <br>  A request for reconsideration can often take less time than the initial application. However, it can easily take just as long, so 3-4 months may be average.  If you get denied on the reconsideration (85% percent of all reconsideration appeals are denied), you should file the next appeal, which is a request for a disability.<br>  <br>  This is where the waiting really begins. It can take up to two years to get a hearing scheduled. So, all in all, for most claimants it can take about three years to get benefits. <br>  <br>  However, that should not stop someone from applying. Thirty percent of applicants will get approved at the disability application level, and fifteen percent of claimants will get approved at the reconsideration level. So it may not take as long as the worst case scenario indicates.<br>  <br>  The worst thing for anyone to do is to put off filing a claim when their condition is disabling.

I had a feeling you were going to post this...|`|bxYWJAYNaa	Actually that is not quite true.<br>  <br>  In the New Testament the Greek word pharmakeia is used.<br>  Pharmakeia has many meanings in ancient Greek, including poisoner, witch, and herbalist.<br>  <br>  In ancient pagan Athens, bad pharmakeia (i.e. witchcraft, use of the evil eye, and necromantic and cacodaemonic magics) was a criminal offence punishable by death.<br>  <br>  If you want to get an idea of what the ancient Greeks meant by witchcraft you can read the pagan books The Golden A.ss by Apuleius, The Biography of Apollonius of Tyana (a pagan prophet), and various Greek myths (esp. the myth of the witch pharmakeia Medea). It was witchcraft as we know it today. <br>  <br>  The ancients were extremely superstitious and believed people could summon evil spirits with magic to wreak harm. The same witches also concocted poisons, although they also superstitiously used spells to give them more potency.|`|hzMpdFFBaa	IN ancient times, use of what we call "magic" today was rampant--and was rampant in Judaism and, later, in Christianity.  What was thought of (or later called) "witchcraft" was a term applied to the magical or presumed threatening supernatural practices that other (people from other cultures or from a society's outsiders or demimonde) were thought to be practicing and not the magic and superstition that the accusers were practicing. So yes, blood sacrifice in the Jewish tradition wasn't considered black magic--but blood sacrifice or certain forms of healing that were practiced by other cultures were considered (by the early Hebrews) to be magic.  Some historians suggest that Jesus wasn't much liked by the Jewish authorities or the pagan Roman authorities because he practice magic--he was a healer and magical worker. That was considered sorcery even if the outcome was for good.
b7Lo5IAZaa	You know, I can kind of understand what you mean. Maybe. I've gone and have been endowed and in the past at certain points I would feel uncomfortable for reasons of feeling pressure. The standards you have to hold to get there, and how sacred it is. So while being there I would worry if I was doing things right. If I was reverent, humble enough and such. Simple doubts that would stop me from feeling the spirit and enjoying the opportunity. Then I just, I don't know, really researched what the temple is about. All of the blessings members are offered by going there. How it IS a place to get away from the world and feel the spirit, feel peace, and receive answers. So I started to go more for those things and looked at it more as a rewarding opportunity I was privileged to have and it's gotten a lot better. I love going there. I went tonight!|`|AA10637643	I've been to the temple many times, even for baptisms.<br>  <br>  What made you uncomfortable?  Why did you feel that way? <br>  <br>  When I received my endowment, I was also being sealed to my husband the same day.  We were both "first-timers".  I remember thinking how blessed I was to be able to attend the Lord's house.  Not just "anyone" can go... and I felt privileged.  I had waited for so long, it seemed more special to me.  I remember sitting in with the temple President's wife, she was talking about garments.  And she paused and looked at me and said, "I have seen many brides come through here.  I can see the love you have for your Heavenly Father in your countenance."  That meant so much to me.  The session was intersting and I learned much, the sealing was simple, beautiful and will now be everlasting.  The point is, a person need to be truly ready, and truly prepared, to understand the symbolic nature of the temple.  It is holy and sacred and wonderful.  I challenge you to stay worthy of a temple recommend.|`|2wUvFmrhaa	My ex husband and I were shocked.

The garments didn't even feel strange at all, it just felt right.|`|FyLfEPv0aa	Baptism of the dead just made sense to me.  The Christian alternative is that they are all sent to hell for being born in the wrong place or wrong time - I don't like that alternative.<br>  <br>  The endowment session is a bit deeper.  I read the entire Bible, Pearl of Great Price, Doctrine and Covenants before I went in addition to the Book of Mormon a few times.<br>  <br>  There wasn't anything hidden or odd, I'd read it all before - it was just presented in a way that I'd never seen before.<br>  <br>  Since I had no emotion of uneasiness I can't comment on how that would have felt, but I did have a mindset of preparation and would think that the vast majority of those who say they felt uneasy didn't prepare as they should have.  <br>  <br>  For me the entire ceremony was one clear and Beautiful symbol of Christ's atoning sacrifice; like reading scripture I understand more and more each time.|`|dDMOJWxwaa	I drank up the spirit.  I was expecting symbolism in the endowment, and it is like scripture, every time you go you learn something.<br>  <br>  Yes I have gone with the youth to baptisms and I can see dressing in whites and participating can be different for some.  But remember you are doing something they cannot do, you become a savior to them.  This is the ultimate in service.  Allow yourself to relax and take it in, I an sure you are nervous but there is no need to.<br>  <br>  You need the experience again, and discuss this with your Bishop.  Some people, to feel comfortable because they do not like new situation tend to panic slightly, blood pressure up.

LOL|`|AA11636949	I have to admit it, but going to the temple for the first time is a little intimidating. To walk into such a place, having been taught that it's Gods house is a little scary. The one thing that helps make it not so intimidating is to go often. You get familiar with the feeling that the temple has and you get comfortable doing the work that is performed there.

NO I thought not since it dose not exist!<br>  <br>  Perhaps you have been reading the Gospel of Sandra Tanner! Think? They like to spread this propaganda!<br>  <br>  Edit: Here is a little information on Jerald and Sandra Tanner:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.fairlds.org/apol/ai188.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.fairlds.org/apol/ai188.html</a><br>  <br>  Additional Edit: For the followers and readers of the Tanners, or those who would just like to know more of their writing techniques you will find this Interesting: Not only are they experts at "Out of context" quotes but more so the Use of Ellipses in quotes:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.fairlds.org/FAIR_Conferences/..." rel="nofollow">http://www.fairlds.org/FAIR_Conferences/...</a><br>  <br>  This reduces the writings to mere Propaganda which we already knew but this further indentifies and proves it very objectivley by unmasking the Techniques used to accomplish it! It is a very effective technique that works well with those who read the Tanner's and want to believe the quotes they use freely allthough dishonestly. They are tricked in to believing that they are accurately quoting LDS Mormon Apostles etc.<br>  <br>  Proud Vet|`|FyLfEPv0aa	This one is very easy.<br>  <br>  You see the term "other" is interpreted if you only read verse 8, and you've interpreted it as the restored gospel of Jesus Christ.<br>  <br>  However if you would continue and read 10 and 11 you will see that Paul states that "this" gospel is not taught of man but by revelation.  If "this" gospel is taught by revelation then the "other" gospel would be one that denies revelation.<br>  <br>  Also let's look at Paul, he was a devout pharisee converted by a vision - do you really think he's going to categorically sy all people converted by a vision are wrong - if so he'd be wrong and there would be no Paul.<br>  <br>  So to put it simply, you're issue is that you're reading this verse with blinders on and ignoring the verses around it.<br>  <br>  Ironically this verse supports our church and justifies the vision and revelation that initiated the restoration while destroying your premise that revelation cannot occur.<br>  <br>  This one is so easy to defend, you asked a question proving that you didn't read the entire chapter - read the chapter then you'll understand.|`|e1a7697c7943bcffd2fa613b82800630aa	Please go a little further.  I believe the rest of Galatians where Paul tells us what he is opposing.  It is religion from theologians without personal revelation.  His very next statement is almost exactly from the experience he shared in common with Joseph Smith.<br>  <br>  10 For do I now persuade men, or God? or do I seek to please men? for if I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ. <br>    11 But I certify you, brethren, that the gospel which was preached of me is not after man. <br>    12 For I neither received it aof man, neither was I taught it, but by the revelation of Jesus Christ.<br>  <br>  As to an angel.  This happens to be the exact method that the fullness of the gospel is promised not once but twice in Revelations.<br>  <br>  Revelation 10:7 But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he shall begin to sound, the mystery of God should be finished, as he hath declared to his servants the prophets. <br>    8 And the voice which I heard from heaven spake unto me again, and said, Go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the earth. <br>    9 And I went unto the angel, and said unto him, Give me the little book. And he said unto me, Take it, and eat it up; and it shall make thy belly bitter, but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey. <br>    10 And I took the little book out of the angel’s hand, and ate it up; and it was in my mouth sweet as honey: and as soon as I had eaten it, my belly was bitter. <br>    11 And he said unto me, Thou must prophesy again before many peoples, and nations, and tongues, and kings.<br>  <br>  Rev. 14: 6 And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people,|`|q5lreoiWaa	The Gospel of Joseph Smith - you mean Another testament of Jesus Christ Nice try no cigars!!!Please at least read the whole book of the Bible before you try to use it for defense.Galations is aimed at theologians preaching without revelation.|`|7d16b3b33c15681f9d53425cac12ac67aa	You're also missing one thing from your statement/question, it wasn't the angel that came first to Joseph Smith. It was God the Father and Jesus Christ. <br>  <br>  If you're thinking that these two personages were the Devil in disguise you'd also be wrong. <br>   <br>  JSH 1:15-16 <br>  <br>  15  After I had retired to the place where I had previously designed to go, having looked around me, and finding myself alone, I kneeled down and began to offer up the desires of my heart to God.  I had scarcely done so, when immediately I was seized upon by some power which entirely overcame me, and had such an astonishing influence over me as to bind my tongue so that I could not speak.  Thick darkness gathered around me, and it seemed to me for a time as if I were doomed to sudden destruction.<br>  <br>  16  But, exerting all my powers to call upon God to deliver me out of the power of this enemy which had seized upon me, and at the very moment when I was ready to sink into despair and abandon myself to destruction—not to an imaginary ruin, but to the power of some actual being from the unseen world, who had such marvelous power as I had never before felt in any being—just at this moment of great alarm, I saw a pillar of light exactly over my head, above the brightness of the sun, which descended gradually until it fell upon me.<br>  <br>  The Devil came before the manifestation of God the Father and His son. <br>  <br>  You're also forgetting the manner in when the angel came. <br>  <br>  JSH 1:29-30<br>  <br>  29  In consequence of these things, I often felt condemned for my weakness and imperfections; when, on the evening of the above-mentioned twenty-first of September, after I had retired to my bed for the night, I betook myself to prayer and supplication to Almighty God for forgiveness of all my sins and follies, and also for a manifestation to me, that I might know of my state and standing before him; for I had full confidence in obtaining a divine manifestation, as I previously had one.<br>  <br>  30  While I was thus in the act of calling upon God, I discovered a light appearing in my room, which continued to increase until the room was lighter than at noonday, when immediately a personage appeared at my bedside, standing in the air, for his feet did not touch the floor.<br>  <br>  In both of these times Joseph Smith called upon God, not upon the angel Moroni. This proves that the gospel Joseph Smith taught was a gospel given to him by God and not by any other.

Without this interest your money would effectively be devalued.  Consider the rate of inflation, Your council tax will increase this year by around 4%, your food bill by somewhere in the region of 15%, so the interest on your money means you will be able to buy goods to the same value as when you deposited the money. If is very very different to money earned by lending money and is not a profit for you it simply keeps you from losing out.|`|bZo5Z53Uaa	The same thing happened to me, I told the bank I was not going to take the money, hence I withdrawed my money (the one I saved)  and closed my account, they took the interest back.<br>  <br>  LOL @ Pink @ monies :)|`|SCkhQc2Caa	Yes , return it to bank or give it as charity and repent _ InshaAllaah there will be no harm upon you.<br>  ___________________________|`|QR5HbJQ0aa	Yes you should, but you won't get any good deeds for it.

FmazIF6Maa	I don't fully agree.    I think when we imagine our "authentic" self, what we really imagine is our "ideal" selves. And stepping into that image is often too difficult or too unrealistic to keep up with.    I'm largely a realist. I decided to stop thinking about my idea or what I thought I should be (obviously I never got there).     I started embracing some things about me that I once thought of as negative. Gave myself permission to be these things, as they weren't so terrible. For one thing, I stopped berating myself for not being so popular and exciting. I'm quiet, I like to read, I like deep converstations on what most popular people would consider boring things. I hate being a social butterfly. I stopped trying to be this; it just wasn't me. After I accepted that, I became more comfortable socially, and ended up with a larger social circle and closer friends.       What was destructive attitudes and behavior, I worked on, through neurolinguistic programming, meditation and positive affirmations and learning discipline.       Stopped making excuses for myself and leared to work with myself. For example, I used to be very, very messy. I found that it is unrealistic to think that I will actually keep my place clean the way my mother did. But, I like to be in a neat environment. So I learned that if I make things very, very convenient to take out and put away, and if I do it right away rather than let it pile up, I keep on top of things.       My advice:  Learn to accept who you are, not some unrealistic ideal vision of yourself. Forgive yourself for not being perfect, work on anything that really causes trouble, accept yourself and work with yourself AS YOU ARE rather than wht you wish you were.|`|lYQDCJgeaa	When you are totally in the moment, not thinking about past or future, you are your true self. Think of a time when you were so absorbed by the moment (not in a crisis, but when you were HAPPY in the moment) and remember what you were doing. That will give you a clue.    You can't "make something up." In fact, that is what most people do, and why they are NOT their authentic selves.    If your self-image is based on what others think of you, what others want for you or what you think would make others happy, then it is not who you are.    If making others happy is part of what makes you happy, then it should happen through you being yourself, not by you acting like someone else or doing things that go against your grain.    Being yourself should be effortless, and not require too much work.    Take time away from everyone else to meditate, and get in touch with your own true feelings.    This is not "selfish"--you can't give to anyone else what you have not found in yourself first.|`|R4RsQxJEaa	I think you need to look at your hopes and desires for yourself, your community and the world.

"How can I live for other people, and get satisfaction from it?"  That's a question worth answering.|`|T52vXXBJaa	This is a difficult thing because far too often we are bombarded with the idea that our self, our identity, is some tangible essence, something in and of itself. I argue that it is not. Just like consciousness, our sense of self - our identity - is an emergent quality. Just like stream of consciousness explains our thought process, stream of identity explains our sense of self. It is an ever-changing thing, an ephemeral product. Once we abandon our desire to cling to this idea that the self is permanent, we can step outside ourselves and see the intrinsic worth that we already possess. We also become free to define who we are ourselves, and to embrace the journey, to value the process because there is no end result; identity is but a stream.|`|FhHklqkhaa	your authentic self seems to be who you want to be plus the best that you could be  I think it means you need to visualise how you wanna be and then become that concept in action sand attitude|`|LjsRfaskaa	What are the things you do not like about yourself.

AA12079397	These are false beliefs. These are all spiritual matters. When many people believe a thing it starts to work. Most of the people don't know they are the creators of all these things. It is true that spirits talk to people through birds, animals and insects too. They like to convey some message to the people they like. For example, in India people believe that if a cat crosses before someone go to office or anywhere, it's a bad omen. At once they postpone their journey for 5 or 10 minutes and then proceed. Actually cat wants to convey a message that he or she may get into some trouble if starts now. It's really doing a very good thing. But what happens? People hates cats for the interruption. They are unable to realize the truth and hates the creature who helped them. This is really a great miserable thing.    In fact, animals, birds and insects don't know anything about these things.

jfcrxSSBaa	It sounds like they were trying to say Alea iacta est (also seen as alea jacta est), which is Latin for "The die is cast".     Actually quoted by Suetonius as iacta alea est, it is what Julius Caesar is reported to have said on January 10, 49 BC as he led his army across the River Rubicon in northern Italy. With this step, he entered Italy at the head of his army in defiance of the Roman Senate and began his long civil war against Pompey and the Optimates.  It would be "?? ??" [anerriphtho kybos] in Greek.    Today, it usually means that something has past the point of no return, or that something is inevitable to happen.

In this way you never have to worry about your sins or their repercussions.   But let's consider the implications.<br>  <br>  I'm going to make another assumption for the sake of argument and say that you are a good person.  So being a good person when you pass on you'll be welcome into heaven.  In heaven you'll be greeted by the likes of Nero, Vlad the Impaler, Genghis Khan, Nobunaga, Pol Pot, Hitler, Mussolini, etc. etc.  Doesn't that sound great and perfectly logical!<br>  <br>  Give me a break.  The very idea of those men (and I use the term loosely) making their way into heaven after all the evil and atrocities they've committed is practically blasphemous.  Yes the Lord will forgive all who ask of Him but I sincerely doubt that men as incredibly evil as the aforementioned would be so inclined to humble themselves before God.<br>  <br>  Hell exists because free will is a matter of choice.

But you are making it sound like someone is blindly leading a bad life,then surprised when they have to suffer the consequence. Not so. God shows gives us many chances in our life to better ourselves, it is up to us to take them. And what makes you think God is happy to send His children to hell?

9e71236ddd91a1ac14a12c704616491caa	It depends on the specific facts and circumstances of the case, and the applicable criminal laws of the relevant jurisdiction.  It should not be a per se rule that minors under 18 cannot be punished with life sentences.  What if a 17 year-old kills 35 people on a murder-spree?  What if he kills 200 people?  Should he get one year in juvie?  Should he be treated differently than someone who is 19 but committed the same crime?  That doesn't seem like justice to me.|`|bb06GQ5Paa	I thought you were referring to that little boy in Arizona who killed his dad and his roommate.  <br>  <br>  I don't know;that's a tough call to make.

Not necessarily put to death, but either life or all death row inmates should be guinea pigs instead of using animals for research.  Excusing children for their acts of violence especially murder is only sending the message that it is okay and you can do it again.    It takes a certain kind of person to actually be able to kill someone, so yes these people need to be removed away from society.    Many have chemical imbalances and do not get better.

BG7Wm3Bcaa	In the first years of the republic, when Cincinnatus was consul, there was a great struggle between the patricians and the plebeians.  The cause was debt, by which nearly all the plebs was oppressed.  The plebs sought help from the consuls, but did not receive it.  Finally the plebs seceded to the Sacred Mountain; the only hope for the patricians was in an agreement of the citizens, and they formed a plan.  They allowed the plebs to create their own magistrates, called tribunes.<br>  <br>  In that time, the senators wished for him to remain consul.  Cincinnatus said to the senators, "The plebs desired to elect the same tribunes again and again.  You were unwilling to grant this power to them.  Therefore, now you are not able to do that which you did not permit; I will not allow myself to be made consul again."  Another man was made consul.<br>  <br>  After a few years, the enemy surrounded the Roman army.  When this was announced, Cincinnatus was named dictator by the agreement of all.  Legates, sent by the senate, found him cultivating his fields across the Tiber.  Cincinnatus ordered his wife to bring him his toga.  Then, appropriately dressed, he proceeded to the city, he swiftly liberated the army, and he sent the enemy under the yoke.  He returned to his field, and put aside the dictatorship, accepted for six months, after the sixteenth day.<br>  <br>  (not entirely sure about the sixteenth day part...I'm not good with numerical expressions)|`|V5akMpDAaa	Cincinnatus First annis rei of the people Cincinnato magistrate magna dispute among patres and common it turns out.

B0gBjCa3aa	I think it all depends on if you were at the party or not.  If you were NOT there...you do nothing.  Sorry, but it is true.  It would be up to your new son-in-law to approach his father and tell him it was HIGHLY inappropriate to bad mouth his wife's side of the family and he owes your daughter an apology, preferrably a public one in front of that same group.  If your son-in-law doesn't do this on his own accord, he isn't the man your daughter thought he was.  And let's hope he doesn't take after HIS father.<br>  <br>  <br>  If you WERE present, I believe you should have said something at the time.  I would have stood up, said "That wasn't nearly as funny as you thought it would be.  In fact, it was rather insulting" and walked out.  He would have looked like an idiot.  <br>  <br>  If you WERE present and didn't address it at the time, phone the house and calmly talk to him.  Tell him that since you are all now family, you thought it best to be honest with him and let him know you were offended.  Don't give a bunch of reasons, just say that his comment offended your family.  Period.  The ball is in his court to apologize.<br>  <br>  <br>  I wouldn't expect much from this family.  A baby isn't a joke.  It is something to be celebrated and nurtured.  I can tell you from expereince that it isn't easy to be young and just married and pregnant to boot.  The ignorant comments from family didn't make it much easier on us.  It continues to this day...18 years later.  People telling us "Wow, we never thought you'd make it this far" while they are going through a divorce themselves...well, it makes us chuckle.|`|RoqxGbgRaa	ignore him for now.  if he continues to be a boar, nail him, and move on.  but don't hold a grudge.  one good time of putting him firmly in his place should make the point, and free him up to behave sensibly in your presence and to watch his step toward your daughter.|`|rJJhMQ37aa	Why should YOU have to address this?  Why not tell your son in law  to please inform his father that he owes both you and your daughter an apology?  His remark was rude, and crude, and it needs to be brought to his attention that you've both been insulted.|`|e2104bb6f4cd0597228a673340a9a643aa	You should not respond to it at all, unless you want to create a rift that may never be healed. It was crude and uncalled for, and the best thing you can is rise above it by ignoring it.<br>  <br>  Btw, why was your daughter trying to get pregnant before marriage? If it was with your blessing, you do deserve some criticism.|`|dPULl5hjaa	Tell that scumbag butt hole in private that he should keep his mouth shut if he doesn't have anything nice to say!  Also, you inform me you get insulted by his very rude comments!<br>  <br>  If he stills continues, tell him.......he will not be able to come over to your house in the future.<br>  <br>  Oh, where's the mother-in-law - when the father-in-law is using these foul comments?  She's not in the room?<br>  <br>  That father-in-law is a dirty old man!|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	Well why did she get preggers to begin with? because she likes to misuse the system!!! <br>  <br>  that man had a right to say it!|`|4a2eee5eefa1d6701c73d4bd94101010aa	Your daughter's new in-laws are real old fashion and still believe that a daughter's place is at her husband's home (whether he's there or not) and that it is the girl's job to keep her virginity until marriage (not the son's).  Your daughter should have retorted to her father-in-law's comment that her new husband's parents didn't teach him that he needs to keep his pants zipped until after marriage (it takes two to make a baby).  She married that family.  She's going to have to do her own fighting, which may include telling her husband that she has the right to visit her own family occasionally, even when he's out of town, without his parents acting like she's running away.<br>  <br>  You do not address the rudeness until it happens to you.  Your people know you and your daughter and know she was raised right and is a good girl.  It doesn't matter what the in-laws' people thing; the kids are now legally married so it makes absolutely no difference what went on before the vows.|`|V0287T2Vaa	Ideally your daughter AND her husband planned the pregnancy, because the way you write, it almost sounds like "my daugher planned a pregnancy and it worked because now she has a husband."  But whatever the sequence of events, his comment was incredibly rude.  Were you at the party, or did your daughter repeat the comment to you?  Either way, it should have been addressed that evening, to stop this stupidity right away.  Let your daughter and son in law handle him- she is the one who must maintain a relationship with him whereas you can pretend he doesn't exit.|`|Zbn8A7Geaa	You don't.  Your daughter or ideally her new husband should.  And immediately.  He wasn't insulting you, he was insulting your daughter.  And she or her husband needs to address the comment.  Your daughter is a grown, married woman now with a child on the way. She needs to learn to stand up for herself and fight her own battles.  And I hope that her husband is on her side about this as he should be.|`|AA11765580	Wow! That is terribly rude! Maybe if he makes a rude comment again you could address it in a firm way in front of everyone. Say something like "my daughter is married to your son and they are very much in love.  I'm happy she turned out the way I raised her, with self respect."  If he doesn't stop, try talking to him alone and tell him you find comments like that offensive. He may just be a moron and doesn't realize he's being rude.|`|oYSsVM0Aaa	While it is rude of him to say and inexcusable, I can understand him being upset that some girl tricked his son into getting her pregnant. He is probably just venting his frustration about that, after all he is a protective parents as well.<br>  That said, what he said at the party was vulgar and rude. I would talk to him straigh to his face.|`|cf6ad6a3adfe8d8e9ce6e9966f1a624caa	you  cant  prove  the  negative.  all he  has  to  point  out  is  that  you  werent  able  to  prevent her  behavior.  NO PARENT can  do  that with  adult  offspring.  just let  it  go. <br>  <br>  the  most  you  can  say  is  the  the  apple  doesnt  fall far  from  his  family  tree  either. his  sons  are just  as  worthless and  ignorant  as  their dad|`|AA11142539	I would probably say something about his father not teaching him how to keep his lips together.|`|AA11788494	I agree with the father in law.  However the man should have used protection since it was his penis too.|`|IB2V5t1Oaa	Oh Boy! That was totally uncalled for and shouldn't have been said whether it was in a joking way or not. He doesn't know you to disrespect you like that and since when are you to blame for her pregnancy? She did the deed and obviously was an adult (at least on paper) when she didn't use protection so she knew the consequences. *sigh*<br>  <br>  How should you respond? How about giving him the finger the next time you are fortunate (<--- sarcasm) to be in his presence. All jokes aside, you should tell him that his remark was rude privately so he knows that you don't appreciate his "sense of humor".|`|LvTIVjySaa	Tell your SIL that you don't appreciate the comment, and his Dad will not be welcome in your home until he makes an apology to your Daughter.  If you go stepping into the middle of it, you will only make your child an outlaw.  He probably meant it in a laughing manner, but he needs to know that it was unappreciated so he doesn't do it again.  If he doesn't apologize, you will be able to bar him from your home and you'll never need to deal with him again.|`|rpzHSaI9aa	What do you mean your daughter planned her pregnancy... do you mean without her husband wanting kids, like she told him she was on the pill or something?? If that is the case I can understand her father in law being upset but nonetheless his comment was rude and uncalled for.<br>  I wouldn't address it too much though... just say something about how since he doesn't know your family he really doesn't have the right to comment.|`|8umXlm1Jaa	Sounds like entrapment on her part.<br>  <br>  The police arent allowed to do it.............|`|mUdeM1Dqaa	Call him to the side and tell him you found his comment to be very offensive. Outline that your daughter is very mature and responsible and you worked hard to raise her. He is in no place to pass judgment on you. I bet you 100% if you confront him, he will be embarrassed (as long as he's sober). He probably will apologize, but if this is part of his personality, he will make comments again. Not about you, but people in general. It's the way he is. Looks like no one has given him a reality check yet, so he'll probably just continue until someone places his foot in his mouth for him.<br>  <br>  He may have made the comment more for shock value, rather than a personal jab. You're a good mother, train that bastard like the dog he is and keep him on a short leash.|`|r9AUdqDRaa	boy the guy has some nerves! if he has a problem with your daughter s pregnancy then maybe he should have taught his son 2 b carefull what he does with his..."tool"<br>  i ll tell u smthng my dad used to say for such occassions.... "our signature and our ... (u got it i guess) ...we gotta now where we put them!!!"" refering to men.....<br>  so maybe you should tell him that .... other than that if u wanna approach the matter more politely than his rude a s s did then let him know that that kind of behavior and way of speaking will not be tolerated and that it would be better to accept the facts and stop blaming you and the way u brought your daughter up as the choice (of a kid coming) was both your kids' and not only your daughter's ... i don t think that she rapped him!!! good luck with the idiot! and stay calm....

Otherwise how could one justly hold them accountable? Oh wait the bible doesn't preach accountability or justice. My fault.|`|WYk0zYdhaa	I suspect since they knew God on a much more intimate level than we do.  The bible shows that God spoke to them audibly and walked with them.   They were aware of the imago dei (created in the image of God).  However, the innocence was lost when they were able to willfully disobey God causing the permanent separation between God and man (the reason we needed Jesus to heal that gap and redeem us).|`|6Y3mW1a2aa	They never lived.|`|E82chX6raa	not much considering they ate from the tree of knowlege

iHLt9Juyaa	Hi there!<br>  Check out 1 Corinthians, chapter 12. It tells you about the gifts of the Holy Spirit. Verses 4- 6 says "there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit. There are differences of ministries but the same Lord, there are diversities of activities, but it is the same God who works all in all."  In verse 8, it reads "for to one is given the word of wisdom through the Spirit, to another the word of knowledge through the same Spirit."<br>  Hope that helps!<br>  God bless you.|`|FOzN3xwzaa	Sounds like word of knowledge, also discernment.  Those are two of the many gifts of the Holy Spirit.  The gifts of the Holy Spirit are listed in the Bible.   :)|`|WlSsUf7raa	I'm not christian but what you are saying seems to be not spiritually.

What happened to you is that now you are practicing more prayer time, devotion, etc. which is causing you to be more centered and in tune with the energy around you. Some will say this is a gift from God, others will say it is Universal. But no matter how you slice it, it happens to people who become in tune with the energy in them and around them. It is a natural part of the human condition, although untapped by many.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|OtKCAeQZaa	I hope that you have forgiven this girl and that you have gone to see her at the hospital for she is in need of a friend and you are that friend that she has right now. Yes you have a gift us it wisely to help others. When you know that some is feeling not right it is for a reason.

A  few  minutes  later  the  phone  rang  and  I  was  told  Dad  was  in  the  hospital.   Mom  said  the  same  thing  happened  to  her  the  day  her  sister  eloped.

These gifts, written about in Romans 12 and 1 Corinthians 12 are meant to be used in a local church capacity.<br>  The premonitions you speak about are perhaps your ability to read body language which authorities say can be read by many.

I would say you probably had a "feeling" about her mental state before and that night it helped you to feel the change... but... I do not discount that God could well have acted in this.... and... it may be for her and not for you... do you have any feeling of a call to reach out to her in forgiveness and concern... to maybe..gently... seek to be a friend and seek to lead her to seek to come to God??????? maybe that is the commission you have been given... in fact it is The Commission you have if you are of The True Church.... seek to fulfill The commission... you will receive the help God knows you need....
eadabfd91d77bd665bf5399add4d126aaa	Statistically, everyone alive today is a descendant of the pharaohs.  Conversely, anyone alive during the time of the pharaohs would be an ancestor of everyone living today, or else the ancestor of no one living today. The Most Recent Common Ancestor of anyone living today would have most probably lived in the 1st millenium BCE. Of course, proving such a bloodline would be another matter.  <br>  <br>  In the meanwhile, Burke's Peerage has traced the British Royal Family's bloodline back to Mohammad through their descent from the Arab (or Moorish) Kings of Seville.  Of course, tracing one's verifiable ancestry back to King Egbert (c. 775-839) is no mean feat as well. <br>  <br>  I probably shouldn't even mention any spurious references to the Merovingians and the Illuminati; however, there are plenty of them out there.|`|bda465ikaa	The queen's bloodline back to Egbert, the first king of England (38 generations) is considered as indisputable as any in existence. Egbert was born 1234 years ago. There is some reasonably reliable chronologies in the Anglo Saxon chronicles that go back another 300 years to the first Anglo Saxon invader who became king of Wessex (King Cerdic). That would be another 12 generations.<br>  ----------------<br>  Some relatively modern research suggests a bloodline back yet another 125 years to  Flavius Afranius Syagrius, a Roman proconsul. These are the oldest bloodlines in the European world.<br>  ============<br>  In China they have bloodlines over 80 generations long that go to Confucius. As far as I know these are the longest reliable bloodlines in the world. But confucius lived millena after the time of the pharoahs. <br>  -----------------<br>  There are mythical bloodlines that go back to the Adam. Some of them were widely circulated for centuries. A bloodline that goes back as far as the pharoahs would have to be mythological. There simply isn't any records that are that old.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Try reading Sir Walter Scott, "The Talisman". David is a big part of the story. David's brother is the ancestor of President Obama.<br>  <br>  EDIT #2: The lee-penny is from the Walter Scott book, "The Talisman".

She is actually a direct descendant of Scottish royalty, rather than English as most people think, and the ancient legend is that the Scots began when and Irish Prince married a daughter of the Pharoah, her name was Scotia, her father was furious and the couple travelled back to Ireland, and their desendants became the Scots, who eventually became Kings of Scotland, and later they became the British Royal family. Whether this is true or not is open to debate, but it is a good story anyway.|`|Iqp3ZUAlaa	Elizabeth II is not in any way related to the ancient Egyptians.She can trace her lineage back to King Egbert, who united England in 829.She can trace her lineage back to William I and Cerdic,founder of the House of Wessex.She can even trace her lineage to Vlad Tepes(Dracula).But she can't trace her lineage back to any of the pharoahs!|`|MbaP0u6iaa	Do not believe anything you read in the works of Sir Walter Scott.

It is a proven fact that the 13th colony of Rome was known as Britannia, modern day UK. During the final days of Rome, it has been said that "Little Augustus" fled to the island colony thus making him he first King of England, but that's just that, rumor nothing more. History also says little is known what ever happen to Augustus. At most Q E would be more closely related to Cleopatra. Given the stories are true, that is.<br>  <br>  Though, I do agree with Paco that the "Lee Penny" is a work of fiction, but here's something o think about......<br>  <br>  Like all great works of fiction, some is based on truth. The story of Dracula was loosely based on two very real people, Vlad Tepes and Elizabeth Bathory. Some say that the story Frankenstein was based from he man who was known as Johann Conrad Dippel, though controversial

Our mission is to float this "river" of life. All the branches (opportunities) eventually return to the river (our mission) and to the sea (God). Returning to the sea is predestined, but how we decide to float the river it is based on our own free will.|`|1d172da8266bc8049a171e749d536d67aa	What are you, 12?

It would be awful to have it be a "bargaining tool" and it would totally kill it for me. I've heard that it's like that with some couples and I really can't see why they do it.

LPO8RlVdaa	No. According to mythology, werewolves age normally in their human form, and can also be killed by a silver weapon in wolf form.|`|KuWLNfYbaa	No such thing,Don't believe your brother,he,s teasing you|`|GWB1R0jQaa	As a fictional species, it depends on which author you ask. In J.K. Rowling's book, werewolves are mortal. I haven't ever heard of stories were they were immortal - but you can look it up on this link;    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Werewolf|`|XmD61yBpaa	They're PRETEND they can be what you want them to be|`|KmH3AsbZaa	Werewolves are stated to be immortal in most stories. Yet you will find the odd fable where werewolves are mortal and be killed by any physical means its just a lot harder cause of their physical and mental prowess. It really just depends on the story your reading sometimes the author needs a mortal werewolf other times not so mortal.|`|s9ilTXJKaa	wolfs die|`|capCtdkeaa	they are 'imaginary' but in legends they were weak to silver, eg bullets|`|VWILDaYPaa	yeah they dont age|`|7ciw1aCXaa	No. They can be "killed". I don't think they are actually undead, although they tend to be classed as such.|`|c67a2f77ab7471bed4b2f279ff05e2e1aa	Werewolves are tosh, fiction, imagination, rubbish.  So are zombies, vampires, devils, hippogriffs, hydras, sirens, wyverns , three-headed dogs, centaurs, bogeymen, evil spirits and all the other monsters you can think of.   They were just invented by foolish adults to frighten children|`|fc49c21691e39a0333658afdb706dba3aa	Supposedly they are very resistant, so they do not age much and keep strong until they die. They heal very fast too, they have to, because of their savage nature.  What I know is they die eventually, very old yet healthy. A silver bullet can kill them, too. They are some of the toughest things around to kill or deal with. They grow around their improved senses and become very accustomed to their savage new nature. No regrets there.|`|LuIFkPfwaa	Immortal in that they can never, ever die, no.  Immortal as they won't die unless they are killed in some way, depends on the author of the book.  Some have them never age, some have really extended lives, but all have death from trauma (silver, decapitation, burning, etc).  I don't think any of the original myths mentioned old werewolves going off to die.|`|QqOUVukfaa	they are not immortal, they just age slower.  about 1yr to our 3/4.|`|SR3JF9Jiaa	In European folklore were-wolves were originally a class of witches who used a magic ointment or wolf skin belt from Satan to take on the form of a wolf for what ever dark reason they chose (usually running around eating people); these werewolves were as mortal as any other human being and could be killed like any other animal or person. Gradually this evolved to the point were it was believed that a werewolf could "infect" others by biting them and damning them to the service of evil.    As the belief was that all magic users - including werewolves - had to sign a compact with the Devil for their powers, people began to believe that religious artifacts had more power than mundane ones over them.  The most effective weapon against a werewolf was a gun because it kept the hunter out of harms way and bullets made of blessed silver became the ammo of choice as they were believed to kill without a fatal shot because the blessing would purge the satanic power from the victim and as they had not recanted their souls would be snatched by the Devil.      Once people stopped believing so widely in magic etc the folklore changed to only killing werewolves by silver bullets.|`|c77b996327401a827d6f388748da1db8aa	No they can be killed by silver bullets if memory serves|`|c6e9425d347c8a998a8a928912bf22e1aa	real werevolves - no;   shape-shifters - yes|`|3ea5199bfc214dd30a610b6a9a12f8e4aa	According to myth they are unless they are killed with silver through the heart...I couldn't find anywhere saying that they age normally, so in that sense they could be immortal.  But yes, you can kill them....was that a howl i just heard????|`|qx4F2SJmaa	Sure, Werewolves are immortal!    UNTIL that Silver Bullet takes them out.    Gotta love Underworld-

6M88k2mUaa	Wow dude, this is amazing...you are ME!  I'm also 22, in a very similar situation, minus the black thing.  You aren't making that money because you are doing it all wrong.  You are trying to work for the money...you gotta make the money work for you.  I started my own DJ business, advertised real hard, and every gig I made money, I'd put half of the money into the business.  Now I am paying for my college and rent and I only work maybe twice a week for about 5 hours each.  Those rich people out there, they don't work for someone else...they work for themselves, took an idea and made money work for them.  Maybe that is what you are going to have to do with the skills you have.  Think!|`|UD7d70awaa	Pray to God.|`|4QizPDQNaa	I don't know you personally, so I can't say exactly what you're doing wrong (if you're doing anything wrong at all). The main reason you can't get a job is because of the economy. Trust me--it's not just black people. Nobody's getting hired these days. Businesses are streamlining and letting go of current staff, so they're not in the market to hire. Plus, you aren't the only one trying to find a job, so you're competing with way more people then usual. Also, with your college  education and years of experience, some places you apply might think you're overqualified and more likely to expect higher pay than someone who never finished high school, for example. You may have already tried this, but go through a temp agency. They have the inside track on who's hiring. Full time work is hard to find, so I suggest you try for 2 part-time positions. Do you have friends/family/professors who know you're searching for a job? Ask them to be on the lookout. You're more likely to get hired through personal connections then just dropping in where they have no background info about you. If your school has a career counseling dept., set up an appt. with them--they probably have good resources and a sizable network of potential employers. Or get a job on campus if you can. Don't limit yourself to just tech or management work--see if you can make any of your other skills or interests work for you. I'm very sorry you're having such a hard time, and I'm sure it's frustrating, but don't give up on life! And try not to let that frustration show when you go out for interviews. Good luck and hopefully something will work out soon, okay!|`|e5ef29eae9dcd13732f1ecbdd1492c90aa	JUST PRAY TO GOD & TELL YOUR SELF THAT YOUR WORTH A LOT & TRY TO BE BETTER PERSON & STOP THINKING ON STUFF LIKE THAT,..

XxPhbwNfaa	You are right, it was a nice gesture.  She accepted the invitation, and showed up.  That means she basically appreciated the effort you made., or else she would have found some excuse not to come.      Give her the benefit of the doubt.  Perhaps she and her husband had a fight over the invitation, or something completely unrelated, or maybe her day was just too harried.  She should have made an effort to remain congenial at your house, yes, but you have no way of knowing why she acted the way she did.  It may have had nothing to do with you.|`|4a2eee5eefa1d6701c73d4bd94101010aa	You did the right thing, you just got a guest who was not grateful for being invited.  Chalk it off as one of those things.  If you get the chance to ask her alone, just say how you thought she might have been annoyed at you during dinner for something and if that is so, you'd like to know what it was that offended her so.  It might not have been you at all; she might have just had a big fight with her mother or the kids and misdirected her anger at you instead.|`|rThIVk2maa	That's a lot of nerve she has, to accept an invitation and the treat her host rudely. You are now free to never invite her over again and you were correct in assuming that dinner parties and such are to be reciprocated, that's how we pay back our hosts for their generosity, by having them over.    Just don't include her again, and decline if she invites you over.|`|NLMawA6Vaa	Well if you werent too close she probably felt very uncomfortable about it.but if she didnt want to go she could have made up any old excuse.  did you go to any of her inviations?  cuz if u didnt then probably she felt mad that you never went  and she did or sumthin.  idk people are just plain wierd! lol  dont worry about it   you will forget about it sooner or later.

Maybe the issue she was having had nothing to do with you. Maybe she accepted the invitation without asking her husband first, and he got upset because she didn't discuss it with him first. It could be a lot of different reasons. I would invite her and her family again in the future. If it happens again, then don't invite them anymore.|`|AA10620246	That wasn't too personal at all. The woman threw you a baby shower, and invited your family over for holidays. That is way more personal than a dinner invitation. Inviting the woman and her family over for dinner was a nice gesture, and is something people do all the time. If there was a problem, it was hers, not yours.|`|CIzrjrykaa	maybe its just her time of the month?|`|e248fbf4bda3b339c8800122c1551870aa	Being angry might just be in her personality and nothing personal against you.|`|de947568c9e8173e12d8a9930bab48abaa	Sounds like you need to remove this person from your life, she obviously has issues going on.|`|I5wje0J1aa	No. It's her choice if she doesn't want to go.|`|WwXrTQgaaa	You need to realize that there are many disturbed freaks out there.

One day some people came along and said very bad lying things about your friend. You know that the things they were saying were horrible and not the least bit true.  You would naturally speak up.    Well, people who speak up to tell the truth about their Creator, Almighty God, their best friend, are good, caring people. So it is natural that they will defend God's name.  He does not need anyone... but... a real true friend of God will speak up when others lyingly say every sort of wicked thing against him.     That's a true friend.

I don't have to defend Him. However, I do defend my faith, by pointing at His wisdom and the way that He created the world, in an act to try to welcome others to believe in Him as well. My God is a loving God who allows free-will- and this means that you are allowed to follow Him and believe Him- or not. He doesn't force people to believe- and doesn't force them to join Him in Heaven. He also doesn't send anyone to hell- that's just the natural direction everyone is going without His rescuing.     God isn't so weak that He can't survive people's attacks- He has survived a lot more than a few equally narrow-minded people who want to believe God is not who He is.     I stand up for my God and my beliefs, because I believe that He is worth my worship and praise and honor- and I stand up for Him the same way that I would stand up if someone attacked my family, or a good friend-  NOBODY talks trash about my family without getting a response from me- and the same way- My God is my Heavenly Father and my Friend- and my love and trust and honor of Him just compels me to stand up and make sure that He is presented and portrayed as He is- and not in a twisted way to make Him look like something that He is not.|`|OZrHGrmiaa	Defending my beliefs is my moral duty|`|2PmgYtsBaa	my biggest fear is a very muscular christian beating me up|`|FFw7fPjjaa	When Christians appear to be defending God, who in actuality needs no protection, what is really happening is that they are attempting to counter the attacks made against God so as to not shake or hinder the faith of others.|`|x8jBWIdmaa	Why not?

x7uRjwseaa	Nothing is wrong with you! Yes, you heard me right. Allah made you this way and he gave you an amazing ability to love people, even in the face of hate. Its a special love that most people do not understand. They can't understand it, because they haven't experienced it. Its like me being a man trying to understand what women go through during PMS. lol. So never doubt that, Allah made you just the way Allah wanted you to be. Even in the Quran Allah acknowledges that not every man is attracted to women.     "And say to the believing women that they cast down their looks and guard their private parts and do not display their ornaments except what appears thereof, and let them wear their head-coverings over their bosoms, and not display their ornaments except to their husbands or their fathers, or the fathers of their husbands, or their sons, ... or the male servants not having need (of women) ..." 24:31    The last part there mentions male servants not having need for women. That could include gay men!     Now my question for you, why do you feel like the two are incompatible? The Quran doesn't condemn homosexuality at all! There is no verse in the Quran that says that Allah hates homosexuals. If there is, could you please tell me where?     What Quran does condemn is sexual immorality and acts based on lust. The latter is the case in the story of Lut. Who condemns his people (straight men) for using travelers as sex objects, raping them for their own lusts and leaving their wives who they were married to! People tend to use this story to generalize a condemn all gay men. But really, is that scenario any thing similar to a same-sex relationship based on love, mutual respect and consent?     The Quran tells us what sexual immorality is. "And those who preserve their chastity, save with their spouses or those whom their right hands possess, for thus they are not blameworthy; But whoso seeketh more than that, those are they who are transgressors." (70:29-31)    From my understanding of that verse it is telling us that you commit sexual transgression if you engage in sexual activity with any one other than your spouse or whom your right hand possess. The thing is, the Quran doesn't forbid a man from marrying another man. There are so many verses about marriage in the Quran and none of them say that a man can't marry another man. It is generally accepted by scholars that, what is not explicitly forbidden in the Quran, then it is acceptable. So in my opinion, and a lot of others, you can marry a man if you're a man.    Secondly, people say that "those whom your right hand possess" only refers to women. I disagree, because the Quran refers to both sexes as "whom your right hands possess". Females in (4:25, 24:31) and males (33:55). So even then a man can have authority over another man and have sexual relations with him, with out transgressing against the rules set by Allah.     Lastly the Quran tells us that Allah has made perfect mates for us.     "And one of His signs is that He created mates for you from yourselves that you may find rest in them, and He put between you love and compassion; most surely there are signs in this for a people who reflect." (30:21) It doesn't say that only pairings of opposite genders were made. This verse can include same-sex couples! Because for a gay man a perfect mate can only be another man. Whom he can love and live in peace with.     So don't feel down on your self. Rather ask your self where such hatred is coming from. This negativity towards homosexuality is definitely not in the Quran. So where is it coming from? Is it based in a puritanical culture that has nothing to offer but shame and guilt for a gay man? Cultures like the one you referred to, where straight men use gay men to get off. And then after that bash the same gay man for being gay.    Best!|`|hfAsEiaZaa	umm...0_o    i dont know what to say,dawg.

Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls."  (Matthew 11:28-29)    "My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness."

He does not deny their existence either. He just asks of you to not act upon your homosexuality. You will never know how much girls mean to you, or how attracted you are to them, if you never even give them a chance.     I suggest you be patient, but if it's eating you out alive to a point where you can't handle it anymore, then it's up to you.    --So, you're saying that women are not good people? Your sexuality is something that you build up over time, it's not something that is ingrained in you. How will you know you will be miserable with a woman for the rest of your life if you NEVER even give it a chance?     You're willing to succumb to the men who can fulfill your sexual desires, but you won't even allow a woman the chance to make you happy. And, judging by the caps lock/yelling font "mode," I can understand you've made up your mind.    --Are you sure you've really "tried" before? Have you ever looked at a woman and not thought of a man, at the same time? That's not called "giving it a chance" or "trying." You will never find women to make you happy, if you turn all the positive impacts they contribute to your life as something short of happiness.

Whenever you address yourself, say "Homosexual" or "Sodomite". gay was in the past associated with being happy and jolly. So the first step is to drop that word. Those who say it's natural are a slave of the "western culture".    Second. Loose all your girl friends. The things that are most desirable in life are the ones we cannot get easily. You might find it useful.    Thirdly, never come close to a girl, who impersonates(dresses like) a man. And don't stay near a man who impersonates a Woman.    Ask yourself this question,"Am I doing something that even the animals of the jungle don't do."    I'm closely observing the western(particularly American) society and I find these to be the fundamental reasons for the great number of sodomites,    "Similar dressing, men with jewelry, co-education, free mixing of sexes, having girls as 'just friends'.     There is a very good reason these things are forbidden in Islam. Now you know why Islam prohibits such things. Curiosity for the opposite sex increases attraction, that's why we don't have this many homosexuals in the Muslim world.    edit: you probably didn't get the gist of the "dressing part". I'll give you an example. Here in the U.S. I was walking down the road, and I see this very slim figure, wearing tight jeans, having long shiny hair and a beautiful complexion, and I said to myself,"Wow! God, She's so beautiful." As the person got closer, I found that she was actually a HE (lol), that's when I realized what 'Same dressing' has done to this society. If I were in a country such as Saudi Arabia, or Pakistan. this would never have happened.    One final thing, If you say that you are "leaving Islam" then I'm sorry to inform you that you NEVER understood Islam in the first place. Saying "I'm leaving Islam" is like saying,"There's no such thing as God." I'm saying this because Islam is the perfect monotheism.|`|qCBWlmnMaa	You've actually got it backwards, you were created just like everyone else, and in your life have developed these homosexual desires.

Do not think about other people, we're always so quick to judge, I don't agree with homosexuality but I will never think that you are less of a person than me, I'll leave it to Allah to judge you.

W8VTpWmtaa	I think things are going to get crazier also but not as a direct result of Obama coming into office. They would be headed in the same direction if McCain had been elected. I voted for him as well because I preferred his propositions and generally liked him as a person and have faith in him to do his best for this country. There's always hope in my opinion for people willing to be optimistic instead of going around screaming that the world is falling apart. The news has always been filled with nothing but negativity, they have never shown anything positive because that's considered "boring" and people wouldn't watch it, so nothing new there. Although I really can't say where this country is headed currently, I personally still believe in it and hopefully things will improve. Until then there's not much to do but continue taking each day at a time.|`|Mq9GSSHhaa	If things get worse, I'm blaming you. You Obama voter, you.  But, yes, I believe the world has hope.

I believe that once everything hits the fan, unless it's some sort of nuclear war, humanity will adapt and prosper again.<br>  <br>  Polybius said that humanity goes through several stages with governments. He said that there are three true forms of government and six total, with the other three being corruptions of the initial three. It goes something like this:<br>  <br>  Things are a mess, everyone is a mob and acting crazy. One person consolidates power and establishes a monarchy, the monarchy goes through a few cycles and becomes more corrupt as it goes along and you have a dictatorship. Soon, the rich or the powerful overthrow the king and you have an aristocracy. This aristocracy is corrupted by the power it holds and becomes an oligarchy. The people overthrow the oligarchy and form a democracy and eventually the morals decay and everything is in chaos again. I believe that we are once again heading toward this sort of mob-rule mentality. We expect our leaders to solve all of our problems and the moral decay we are seeing today is eroding the basis of our society. The fact that we have a globalized economy complicates things even further. I believe we will see some things we would have never thought possible. Negative and positive. We are definitely at an interesting position in history.<br>  <br>  Let's just hope we make it past 2012 though.|`|aToY6JrPaa	Things were going to get crazier, no matter who was i office.

hKz8eUoBaa	The noble Qur'an enunciates the view that man is not completely a master of his fate; nor is he a puppet in the hands of blind destiny. It is a fact that Allah's sovereignty is all pervading and nothing falls outside its purview; which is to say that Allah knows everything and things happen according to His Will.<br>  <br>  The whole of creation i.e. all the things and beings in the universe are subject to the overriding power of Allah, and we humans can do nothing without Allah willing it to be so. <br>  <br>  Allah says in the noble Qur'an what gives the meaning of:<br>  <br>  <br>  *{He created everything for its destiny (or its measure) }* (Al-Furqan 25: 2)<br>  *{We created everything according to a measure or destiny.}* (Al-Qamar 54:9)<br>  <br>  In both the above verses "destiny" implies the latent capabilities of things.<br>  <br>  But this is not to say that Allah created a universe finished and complete, bound to the iron rules of nature. On the contrary, it means only that the creation of this universe was in accordance with the grand design of the Creator.<br>  <br>  Well-Designed and Well-Planned<br>  <br>  There is no element of chance in the creation of this universe. Everything is well-designed and well-planned. And Allah has a foreknowledge of everything that He created. But this does not imply that human beings have been completely deprived of the freedom of action.<br>  <br>  The foreknowledge of Allah is different from predestination. Otherwise, man will not have any freedom of will or action; and what is more, Allah Himself is then made to be inactive, as things happen according to what people call predestination. But the glorious Qur'an clearly says that Allah is constantly active in creation. Allah Almighty says what means:<br>  <br>  *{Allah. There is no god but He, the Living, the Self-subsisting, Supporter of all. No slumber can seize Him nor sleep. His are all things in the heavens and on earth. Who is there can intercede in His presence except as He permits? He knows what (appears to His creatures as) before or after or behind them. Nor shall they compass aught of His knowledge except as He wills. His Throne does extend over the heavens and the earth, and He feels no fatigue in guarding and preserving them. For He is the Most High, the Supreme (in glory).}* (Al-Baqarah 2: 255)<br>  We may understand Allah's knowledge to be a living creative activity, which includes His fore-knowledge of events to come. The future may be conceived as an open possibility that pre-exists to be realized. This means that destiny as conceived by Islam does not negate our freedom of choice and action.<br>  <br>  A Limited Freedom<br>  <br>  Out of a set of inherent possibilities, we can make a free choice of those actions that are in harmony with Allah's Will; if so, we earn our reward from Allah. Thus from the point of view of Islam, humanity is free (in a limited sense) for all practical purposes, and has no excuse for making the wrong choice in the name of fate.<br>  <br>  The Qur'anic view of humans is that they have a natural inclination to all that is good; but as we are given freedom of choice, we may choose evil against our natural tendency towards good. About divine guidance, Allah says what can be translated as:<br>  <br>  *{It is the truth from your Lord; wherefore let him who will, believe, and let him who will, disbelieve.}* (Al-Kahf 18: 29)<br>  Again we read:  <br>  <br>  *{Indeed Allah does not wrong the people at all, it is they wrong their own selves.}* (Yunus 10: 44)<br>  And:  <br>  <br>  *{There is no compulsion in religion. Surely the right way has become distinct from error. }* (Al-Baqarah 2: 256)<br>  The particular Qur'anic verses you have referred to in your question should be studied against the foregoing background.<br>   <br>  *{….. If some good befalls them, they say, "This is from Allah.; but if evil, they say, "This is from thee" (O Prophet). Say: "All things are from Allah." But what hath come to these people, that they fail to understand a single fact? Whatever good happens to thee is from God; and whatever evil befalls thee is from thyself…}* (An-Nisaa' 4:78-79)<br>   <br>  Good and Bad: From Allah's Will<br>   <br>  First, it is mentioned that all things are from Allah; and then it is stated that good happenings come from Allah and evil happenings come from humans.<br>   <br>  If we look for the correct interpretation of the verses above, we can see that there is no contradiction there. In fact, Allah Almighty is the ultimate source of all that is happening.<br>   <br>  Consequently, all good that comes to man and all evil that befalls him flow originally from Allah's will: that is, everything is from Allah. And when man uses his freewill and makes a wrong choice out of several available options, evil follows. And we should remember that evil is the absence of good; or its opposite that follows a wrong choice by man. Thus it is true that evil happenings come from man.<br>   <br>  It is also possible that what appears to be evil may very well turn out to be good in the end. In such cases evil is no more than a means of spiritual growth for man, and need not|`|o1rzGR8kaa	Some wun tell me Jimmy Swagert did, I should give money|`|GtazNrplaa	Well a long time ago in the opposite 13 dimension, there was a terrible space war going on between the members of the light savers of energy and the dark uses of energy. There were millions of space ships firing at each other with quantum atoms defuses.<br>  <br>  There was so much energy floating around it bounced up against the 12 dimension surface wall and punched a hole in it. This caused decompression of the vacuum  and everything was sucked out into the 12 dimension.

Many are not. Sometimes our plate has nothing but vegetables--twenty-four hours of celery, carrots, and squash. Apparently God knows we need some strength, and though the portion may be hard to swallow, isn't it for our own good? Most days, however, have a bit of it all. Vegetables, which are healthy but dull. Fruit, which tastes better and we enjoy. And even an Oreo, which does little for our nutrition, but a lot for our attitude.<br>  All are important and all are from God. <br>  <br>  The next time your plate has more broccoli than apple pie, remember who prepared the meal. And the next time your plate has a portion you find hard to swallow, talk to God about it. Jesus did. In the garden of Gethsemane his Father handed him a cup of suffering so sour, so vile, that Jesus handed it back to heaven. "My Father," he prayed, "if it is possible may this cup be taken from me. Yet not as I will, but as you will" (Matt. 26:39).<br>  <br>  Even Jesus was given a portion he found hard to swallow. But with God's help, he did.

(THE GENUINE ISLAM, Singapore, Vol. 1, No. 8, 1936) <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  He was by far the most remarkable man that ever set foot on this earth. He preached a religion, founded a state, built a nation, laid down a moral code, initiated numerous social and political reforms, established a powerful and dynamic society to practice and represent his teachings and completely revolutionized the worlds of human thought and behavior for all times to come. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.beautifulislam.net/intro/you_must_know_this_man.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.beautifulislam.net/intro/you_...</a>|`|HVY2rqzfaa	God, what happened to the spellchecker, was it asleep?<br>  <br>  You are free to believe as you see fit, but others should be free to express their opinions about your beliefs. <br>  <br>  I eat cheese, but if you don't like cheese, that's cool, I'll carry on eating it anyway... <br>  <br>  Why do you need my or anyone elses approval of your profit, does that make him any less cool in your eyes?

I do not believe there are many Muslims who can think of Allah without also thinking of Mohamed. Similarly, there are very few Christians who can think of God without thinking of Jesus. Perhaps that is why the Quran states that Islam is the last religion and that there will be no more prophets in the future.

People use it in different ways. Since it is merely a statement about the ability to know something some use it to mean they are uncommitted about whether or not any deity exists. It can be used in conjunction though with both the term theist or atheist. An agnostic theist would be saying that they know there is no way to prove or know for sure a god exists but they believe it anyway on faith. An agnostic atheist in the same way will say there is no way to prove or know for sure a god doesn't exist but in light of the lack of good evidence for them they don't believe that any do exist.|`|35388c245298f734c446f07410c4ec69aa	Atheism is the absence of belief in gods, agnosticism is uncertainty concerning the existence of gods.  Both have weak and strong variants, with strong atheism being the positive belief that there are no gods, and strong agnosticism being the positive belief that the existence of gods cannot be known.  Weak atheists are all agnostics of one form or another.|`|79529314dfb5ac7be366558924c3393baa	That depends on who you ask.<br>  <br>  By my own definitions, an atheist is someone who believes that God at least probably does not exist, while an agnostic is someone who is undecided as to whether or not God exists. However, a lot of people disagree with me; one common set of definitions fits with my definition of atheism but states that agnostics are those who are simply not certain one way or the other (which means you could have an 'agnostic atheist' or 'agnostic theist' which is impossible under my definitions), and then there is another set which takes THAT definition of agnosticism but has atheism as being certainty that God does not exist (thus making 'agnostic atheists' impossible again). Personally I think my own set of definitions is the most useful and comprehensive of those three, as it allows for both weak agnosticism and strong agnosticism as being distinct from weak atheism and weak theism, but I guess not everyone shares that view.|`|n55igpCUaa	Atheists do not believe in religion.<br>  Agnostics are not sure what to believe and don't care.|`|c9a1b864f1a97925067a5a7737860ac4aa	Agnosticism is the view that the existence of God is impossible to be known or proven. The word “agnostic” essential means “without knowledge.” Agnosticism is a more intellectually honest form of atheism. Atheism claims that God does not exist – an improvable position. Agnosticism argues that God’s existence cannot be proven or unproven – that it is impossible to know whether God exists. In this concept, agnosticism is correct. God’s existence cannot be empirically proven or disproven.|`|4d16b72ffa495ae128ab9f89679fc203aa	Atheist:  One who has no beliefs in gods.

There are many catogories of agnosticism but the commonality between them all is the idea that "we just can't know" for certain if there is a God or not. Some then use this to reject personal religion while others say that they may never know here on earth but maybe someday they will discover God in the afterlife.
d0f93ace5169bf1fc1696345cdb101c2aa	We have no teaching whatsoever.  To us, Jesus is essentially a non-entity, the same way Buddha would be to you (no disrespect to Buddhists meant, just an example).|`|hceNM6Uxaa	Not quite sure why you refer to things being 'spun'.  And uncertain why you think Jews would, as Jews, talk about an individual who is central to a totally different religion.  After all, I'm pretty certain Christians don't spend time considering Krishna, or the Sikh gurus, for example.  <br>  <br>  Jews playing any role in the death of the Christian messiah is a story from the Christian New Testament.  Even the pope now accepts that this is a calumny - one that has led to considerable persecution of Jews over the centuries.  But since the New Testament is not part of our scripture, the only time we even think about the death of Jesus is when Christians 'accuse' us of being complicit in the death of their messiah.  <br>  <br>  If anyone IS defensive, it just might be that questions about Jews being responsible for the death of Jesus are posted on here on a daily basis.  If you search, you'll find hundreds of answers already.  We are, to be frank, a bit fed up with it.  Constantly having to explain that we're not guilty for something that happened 2000 years ago and was poorly reported, something that has absolutely nothing to do with our own history, gets a little tiresome. I am truly glad you are curious, but I would request that you use your curiosity to search out existing answers and then perhaps you might wish to ask us something further - which we would be pleased to answer.|`|8I9uduIiaa	Well since we didn't kill him, why would our faith 'spin' or 'teach' anything about it...?<br>  <br>  Get your facts clear. Jesus was charged with SEDITION. That was a  crime only against ROME.<br>  <br>  Jesus was killed by crucifixion - a purely ROMAN method, and one banned in Judaism from the start.<br>  <br>  Jesus was killed along with 250,000 OTHER JEWS - many of them also leaders of small messianic sects. Again: they were a problem for ROME. Nothing to do with Judaism.<br>  <br>  The account in your bible is so inaccurate with regard to ALL aspects of Judaism and Jewish history, it would frankly be risible IF this deadly myth had not led to the deaths of countless Jews down through the ages.<br>  <br>  You might care to recall that your own scriptures state: the Jews were obsessive about adhering TO the Jewish religious laws. Yet, at the same time, you choose to believe that they also would have killed someone with a method FORBIDDEN in Judaism, at a 'trial' that VIOLATED every single Jewish law...?<br>  <br>  Oh, purleeease.....<br>  <br>  <br>  Note: the first answerer is NOT Jewish.

There is no Jewish NOR Roman record of him.  He didn't make much of a splash at the time if he existed at all.<br>  <br>  However, it has been an anti-semitic part of Christianity for not quite 2000 years to falsely blame Jews for Jesus's death - then kill Jews for it.  More recently two Pope's have apologized for starting this hate as have a number of other churches.  <br>  <br>  For one thing the story in NT blames Jews but has many many errors in logic of how Judaism operated at the time.  Also, the story can be read without blaming Jews.  Although Christianity can be done that way, it's taking time for it to move fully in that direction, however, doing so produces more consistency in IT'S OWN litergy.  For instance, it is the Romans who kill Jesus.  It is necessary that Jesus died in Christian theology so blame makes no sense.  "Jews" being blamed also makes no sense considering, I simply wasn't alive at the time.  The story also refers to a only few people, so we are talking bigotry to generalize past the moment of the story & those -specific - people.<br>  <br>  This interfaith site has more on the relationship between the two religions:<br>  <a href="http://www.jcrelations.net/en/?id=966" rel="nofollow">http://www.jcrelations.net/en/?id=966</a><br>  <br>  On the long history of Jews being killed for "killing Jesus" these sites will have more.

Jesus didn't do any of them. He did miracles which is a sign of not-the-messiah.<br>  <br>  - the Jewish messiah concept is a human being who does things like bring peace with the help of God. The Christ concept of being saved from sin by human or human-God sacrifice is totally alien to Judaism & to the Jewish messiah concept.<br>  <br>  - The OT is not the same as the Jewish Tanakh. It's quite similar, however there are small changes throughout that result in support for Christian theology. All those predictions go away when you use the Tanakh & the in-context Jewish understandings of them.<br>  <br>  - Judaism in general is very different than Christianity in many ways. While a Christ concept is central to Christianity, the focus on it when looking at Judaism pretty much misses most everything there is of importance in Judaism. Briefly, Tikkun Olam (focus on this world & repairing it), a steady dialog for over 4000 years of how to live THIS life morally based on Torah, a style of doing that dialog that isn't in Christianity but is central to being Jewish, a whole complicated list of wonderful religious days, a way of being just one religion amoung others where non-Jews too can have a place in the world to come.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps. This is the first question every Christian seems to ask us. If you do a search in YA you may find any number of posts with answers to this with more details.<br>  <br>  Here's a good starting point to learn about Judaism:<br>  <a href="http://www.jewfaq.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.jewfaq.org</a><br>  <a href="http://www.aish.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.aish.org</a> <br>  Written for jews to learn more about Judasim so gives a sense of how Judasm works (including that study style - the essays have that flow)<br>  <a href="http://www.whatjewsbelieve.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.whatjewsbelieve.org</a> <br>  Answers common Christian questions<br>  <a href="http://www.jcrelations.net/en/?id=966" rel="nofollow">http://www.jcrelations.net/en/?id=966</a> <br>  Cool interfaith site that gives a Christian view of Judaism by clerics<br>  <br>  The idea of "do unto others" was in Judaism before Jesus said it (the sage Hillel is famous for it & it's in Deut). So Jesus basically didn't bring anything morally that is new to Judaism, & left out some stuff. So, there's no need from that point of view to adopt him either.<br>  <br>  ====<br>  Here's the list:<br>  <br>  * The Sanhedrin will be re-established (Isaiah 1:26)<br>  * Once he is King, leaders of other nations will look to him for guidance.

I emailed with a Talmudic scholar about a Christian book on vague "Jesus"  references in Talmud, which as Aryeh said, Christian's required be removed.  She was clear, as was the Chrisitan scholar author, that they were NOT proof of Jesus since they were written in Talmud at a much later time than he's appearance & were written about Christians in general, not him.  There are other spots of even more vague unnamed references, that are not of the same time period or story details.<br>  <br>  <br>  BLAZER<br>  Not one Jewish person accused this asker of being anti-semitic (but that the idea has been over the centuries).  However, I will call someone anti-semitic -- YOU.  Read these answers & learn, because you have much to learn about what that means.|`|XQhrHiUcaa	It doesn't say anything.  There are a few cases in the Talmud that discuss certain unnamed individuals and the church required us to censor them, believing that they were of your god, but there is no proof that they meant him, although it is possible that some may have been aimed at him.<br>  <br>  There is a paragraph is Josephus that does mention him, however it appears that at least part of that paragraph was not written by Josephus but rather by a Christian and inserted in a manuscript.|`|VlfV7uiZaa	We cant begin to explore that question until we prove the guy actually existed.

It would be like asking what our tradition teaches about our role in the death of Zeus.<br>  <br>  All the best.|`|AA12245463	In the death of Christ?  Do you know what the word christ means?  It simply means anointed, as in anointed king, of which there have been many over the Millennia. The word messiah was translated to Greek as christ, and is still used today in English as messiah (anointed king).<br>  <br>  The role Jews (it's okay to call us Jews) played in the death of christ?  Which one?  King Cyrus of Persia is the first messiah mentioned in our Bible (TaNaKh).  He was considered to be a very great messiah having freed Israelites from exile in Babylon and allowing them to return to Israel.<br>  <br>  Now if you're referring to a god you call Jesus, then none of us could have played a role in your god's death.  Whatever happens to a god is obviously preordained or god could not be omnipotent.  Or perhaps your god is not omnipotent?  Did God send him here to suffer and die an excrutiatingly painful death, or not?<br>  <br>  Jews (it's okay to call us Jews) have followed MANY great leaders over the centuries believing them to be THE messiah that will usher in an era of universal peace on earth.  When that leader dies without having led us to peace on earth, we acknowledge that he could not have been THE messiah and move on with our lives.  No Jew will ever worship a human being -- the ultimate heresy!<br>  <br>  Judaism is not about life in the hereafter -- the human leader we await is the one who will bring about peace on earth in THIS lifetime.  The messiah will not arrive until WE (Jews) as a community are leading righteous lives.  We concentrate our efforts on our own community without imposing our laws and practices on others.<br>  <br>  Our every prayer is for peace (shalom).<br>  <br>  Shalom|`|7QtY1cSmaa	There is NO mention of Christ in the Old Testament or in any Jewish literature.<br>  <br>  Several other people have given this factual answer to a simple question and have got thumbs down, even though their answers are 100% correct and non-controversial.<br>  <br>  WHY??<br>  <br>  I see I've got one now!

4hsl2toNaa	Revelation brings out 144,000 being priests, kings, princes with Jesus in Heaven, ruling over the earth.   It also says they are chosen by Jehovah, not man.   Revelation 14:1-3.   Others give us undo credit.  Jehovah said it first and gave it a place in the book of Revelation.  <br>  <br>  Matthew 24:14 tells a different story.<br>  But he that has endured to the end is the one that will be saved. <br>  <br>  144,000 picked for heaven and an unnumbered amout will be saved, if they endure to the end, to live in Paradise Earth.<br>  <br>  Simple as pie.|`|AA11703455	No.<br>  <br>  The scriptures show 144,000 as being part of the Heavenly New Jerusalem. These serve as kings and priests. <br>  <br>  Kings and priests both need someone to serve.<br>  <br>  Revelation Chapter 20 shows all the dead in hades will be restored to life. Some estimate that there have been between 10 to 20 billion people that have lived and died over the stream of time. These will be part of those who benefit from these Kings and Priests. <br>  <br>  Plus  Revelation 7 shows a great crowd, which no one can number, surviving the great tribulation. How big that will be we will have to see 'after the great tribulation".<br>  <br>  The figure then is in the terms of Billions that can be listed as "saved".|`|tx4bRDrXaa	No not just 144,000 will be saved,and not just Jehovah's Wittnesses,There will be people resurrected from all religions by Jesus Christ and there will be a great multitude saved that no man can number.|`|AA10671142	Salvation is open to provision that Jehovah has made through Jesus Christ. But the bible says that only 144,000 will go to heaven to be with Christ Jesus. Read Revelation chapter 14 verses one and three|`|AA10024451	The answer is a firm NO. <br>  <br>  The Bible's teaching in Revelation 7 and Revelation 14, are that only 144,000 are "bought from the earth" and are taken to heaven to serve as "kings and priests" alongside Jesus Christ in the heavenly Kingdom. That does NOT state that only 144,000 are "saved", it simply addresses one of TWO hopes the Bible discusses for faithful and obedient mankind. <br>  <br>  Jesus Christ himself, as recorded in the gospels, talked about two groups of sheep that he would be the one shepherd over: the "little flock" and the "other sheep". The "little flock" is in reference to the humans that God has deemed worthy to be in that class of 144,000. It is so-called "little flock" because in relation to the remainder of faithful mankind (that has lived in times past and lives currently) it's a small number in relation to them. The "other sheep" are the much larger class of obedient humans that Christ will judge (with his god-given authority) as worthy of inheriting everlasting life right here on this earth......to live the life that God intended (and still intends) for his human creation to enjoy: everlasting life in paradise surroundins and in perfect health.<br>  <br>  So there will be much more than 144,000 that will be saved when the destruction of this Satanic system of things comes about. 144,000 are only part of the overall saved group.....the part that will be taken to heaven.|`|5qjxyb0jaa	Yes & no .<br>  That is not what they say . If you study up on it you may understand .<br>  What is saved to you ?<br>  <br>  They do not have to rewrite the bible , it is in any version of the bible you wish to quote .<br>  <br>  Ok I will go with No as several Jws have said but i still think this is a loaded question .<br>   Waiting for the trap to snap.|`|5aqYVyvAaa	Revelation 14:1-3  and Rev 7:4 says that only 144,000 will die and go to heaven. (Heaven does exist but only so many get to go.)<br>  Rev 5:10 talks about them serving as kings and preist in heaven (well they have to have someone to rule over)<br>  <br>  Rev 7:9 talks about a great crowd<br>  Acts 24:15 Jesus promised that there will be a resurrection. (This is what will happen to the rest of us who have died.)<br>  Ps 37:9-11 and Ps 37:29 talks about the righteous residing forever upon the earth<br>  <br>  We're not as crazy as some may think it's all in the Bible.<br>  Great kind and honest question.<br>  <br>  There are several more Bible references if you want them these are just a few.|`|oen1tuyTaa	Who really acres? If you don't agree you ain't going..<br>  They actually say that the remainder of us will just die, no afterlife, no hell, nothing..Sounds like the only bit of truth these loonies know.|`|DBg0yFSYaa	They believe 144000 will go to heaven. The remainder of the faithful will live forever on earth in paradise conditions.|`|AA10357803	yea because they can only cover so much space going door to door on foot .. i have a no soliciting sign...|`|dmTVbpcWaa	No they do Not. The Word Salvation seems to be misinterpreted  when it comes to bible. First off, if a Boat is sinking and people are crying for Help- it does not matter whether one is airlifted by a Helicopter or rescued by a Boat- the end result is that one is SAVED.<br>    In his Word God assures us that “there is going to be a resurrection of both the righteous and the unrighteous.” (Acts 24:15) The Scriptural testimony is that all those who have died and gone to Sheol or Hades, the common grave of dead mankind, will be raised. (Rev. 20:13) Obviously these ones will have an Opportunity to Gain Life everlasting.<br>   In his speech on the Sermon on the Mount Jesus Christ said much on this occasion related especially to the heavenly Kingdom. For example, he began with the words: “Happy are those conscious of their spiritual need, since the kingdom of the heavens belongs to them.” He said that the pure in heart would “see God” and that “the kingdom of the heavens” belongs to those “persecuted for righteousness’ sake.” (Matthew 5:3, 8,?10) These Obviously would be Persons " Worthy" of gaining Life in the Heavens.<br>  Jehovah’s Witnesses put their faith in the Kingdom of God. It is the “new heavens” that the apostle Peter wrote about: “There are new heavens and a new earth that we are awaiting according to his promise, and in these righteousness is to dwell.” (2?Peter 3:13) The “new earth” is the new human society that will be governed by the new heavens, God’s Kingdom. This is the arrangement God revealed in a vision to the apostle John, who wrote: “I saw a new heaven and a new earth; for the former heaven and the former earth had passed away .?.?. And [God] will wipe out every tear from their eyes, and death will be no more, neither will mourning nor outcry nor pain be anymore. The former things have passed away.”—Revelation 21:1,?4.<br>   The idea that all good people go to Heaven and Bad people to " hell" is unscriptural. The Scriptures above  show otherwise.<br>   Ultimately Salvation comes to both those who go to heaven & those who will have everlasting life on earth.|`|JZxZ8mKRaa	Part of the misconception comes from thinking that gaining life in heaven is a reward for doing good, and any other outcome constitutes being unrighteous or wicked.<br>  <br>  Those that are selected for heavenly life are chosen for a specific purpose, that is to be co-rulers with Christ, so the rest of RIGHTEOUS mankind can flourish with everlasting life in perfection here on earth.<br>  <br>  Both hopes require righteousness, loyalty, and faithfulness.<br>  <br>  Where that everlasting life is spent is Jehovah's choosing, whether it be in heaven OR on earth.

The bible also teaches that we are created in God's image and likeness. In Genesis Adam and Eve communed with God in Innocence.  They were not naked but were clothed in God's Glory. When they sinned they lost the covering of God's glory and found themselves naked!!! Isn't that interesting Sin and nakedness are found hand in hand... <br>  Jesus the Son of God left his grave cloths in the tomb. Yet I know he was not naked because when Mary first saw him she thought that he was the gardner.  I don't think that there were any naked gardeners in Jerusalem 2000 years ago. I think that it is possible that when a saved person dies that they are clothed in righteousness once again. Flesh and blood can not inherit God's kingdom, but I know that there is no nakedness there either...|`|iHDYncuXaa	Read the bible again. He did not take His clothes.

dcDY9pJeaa	I was just basically going to reference the Lemon 71 decision but its in your comments so,<br>  <br>  Zorach v. Clauson, 343 U.S. 306 (1952), was a case at the Supreme Court of the United States.<br>  <br>  Under 3210 of the New York Education Law and the regulations thereunder, New York City permits its public schools to release students during school hours, on written requests of their parents, so that they may leave the school buildings and grounds and go to religious centers for religious instruction or devotional exercises. The same section makes school attendance compulsory; students not released stay in the classrooms; and the churches report to the schools the names of children released from public schools who fail to report for religious instruction. The program involves neither religious instruction in public schools nor the expenditure of public funds. Held: This program does not violate the First Amendment, made applicable to the States by the Fourteenth Amendment. McCollum v. Board of Education, distinguished. Pp. 308-315.<br>  <br>  (a) By this system, New York has neither prohibited the "free exercise" of religion nor made a law "respecting an establishment of religion" within the meaning of the First Amendment. Pp. 310-315.<br>  <br>  (b) There is no evidence in the record in this case to support a conclusion that the system involves the use of coercion to get public school students into religious classrooms. Pp. 311-312.<br>  <br>  A widely quoted sentence from the decision is "We are a religious people whose institutions presuppose a Supreme Being."[1]<br>  <br>  Majority Douglas, joined by Vinson, Reed, Burton, Clark, Minton <br>  Dissent Black <br>  Dissent Frankfurter <br>  Dissent Jackson <br>  <br>  <br>  The justice listed here in the majority - Douglas - is pretty awesome.<br>  <br>  So I might print this out and read it later - cause Douglas is fascinating -  but I think your taking a quote and putting the quote up there and that's fine,  but the gist of what is being said is that students are able to leave public school to go to a church for church school - but that not all kids are required to do this.<br>  <br>  I guess my opinion on this decision is the kids right to religion needs to be respected,  and if the kids are enrolled in public school and meeting requirements to pass then I'm not opposed to them leaving.<br>  <br>  This leaves the secular curriculum in the public school alone.<br>  <br>  <br>  In short - way to go Douglas!|`|PAA4uWPuaa	I think it really goes to show that as the Justices change then you just see a bouncing back and forth of decisions. In that regard it will never really change it will just bounce back and forth.|`|5rIsBUKSaa	Oh...<br>  <br>  You said "R&S Normals"...<br>  <br>  That excludes ME.|`|mNyhRGowaa	The outward acceptance and promotion of tolerance toward homosexuality in public schools?|`|HOQp0gA7aa	I think it should be permissible to teach religion in public schools.  We just all need to agree that since Roman Catholicism is the largest religion on the planet, it will be the religion taught in our school system and adopted by the US Government as the officially sanctioned faith.  If all the religious people want rule by the majority, then that is the only decision that makes sense.  <br>  <br>  However, if we can't all come to a common consensus that Roman Catholicism is what should be practiced in our public school system, then perhaps we should maintain our status quo of not practicing any religion in our schools.  That was the intent of the original framers of the US Constitution when they enacted a separation between church and state.  The nations founders understood the dangers of allowing a majority religion to overrun every other faith, and placed safeguards to allow people to practice their faith as they wished without interference by the government.  <br>  <br>  I'm sure most people in this country would not like to have the government decide for them which religion their children will be taught.  Since no one can come to a universal consensus about which religious practices everyone finds acceptable, it is best to leave religious choice to the parents of the children.

It will crush all those kingdoms and bring them to an end, but it will itself endure forever. 45 This is the meaning of the vision of the rock cut out of a mountain, but not by human hands—a rock that broke the iron, the bronze, the clay, the silver and the gold to pieces.<br>        "The great God has shown the king what will take place in the future.

I will say that more than "religion" it was our values that were not the same. <br>  <br>  I personally don't care what religious denomination he is as long as he is christian but more than that ....his character is what I am marrying...not his religion.

If you caused someone to feel love and joy, you will feel their love and joy. But fire and burning and eternal damn nation of your soul or heaven? No. Those are not real. Those are religious myths.|`|4fc9aa87352e3e2f25ca35455cdfb596aa	I don't believe in heaven or hell really.

ORbFRn4oaa	There is STRICTLY "NO" racism in Islam. <br>  <br>  The "ONLY" criteria is "righteousness".<br>  <br>  As far as marriage is concerned, from a Quranic perspective, the Muslims can marry "ONLY" with the people of the book i.e. scriptures i.e. Muslims, Christians and Jews.<br>  <br>  Besides the three, they are NOT allowed to marry.|`|5ofS2qQYaa	if they are Only allowed to marry w/in their race, it's a close-minded culture they are following<br>  <br>  in ISLAM, muslims are to consider PIETY and devotion to Islam as the most important characteristic first<br>  <br>  but you know how sometimes people value man-made cultures over religion...*some people would be heartbroken if their children married interacially<br>  but it's racist, of course and NOT AT ALL a part of the ways of Islam<br>  <br>  Islam is a whole lot more rational and practical than some "cultures"<br>  <br>  :)<br>  <br>  Allah(swt) knows best|`|9BfI7N55aa	Prophet Muhammad have made it very clear .<br>  go read the the last sermon of the Holy Prophet Muhammad Peace Be Upon Him . <br>  He did mention  that nor an Arab has any priority on a non member .<br>  so every Muslim girl can marry any Muslim male . race doesn't matter .<br>  but you shall think about the consequences  of your marriage on your life .

FZaaKl0Haa	People need to learn about Islam and Juvegirl (whatever her name is) should stop pretending to be a Christian and admit she knows nothing about racism in Islam, lol.  Anyone ever hear of Nation of Islam, the most racist organization that ever existed?  How about Sahih Bukhari or the Quran?  <br>  <br>  Bukhari: V9B89N256 "Allah's Apostle said, 'You should listen to and obey your ruler even if he is a black African slave whose head looks like a raisin.'" <br>  <br>  Ishaq:243 "I heard the Apostle say: 'Whoever wants to see Satan should look at Nabtal!' He was a black man with long flowing hair, inflamed eyes, and dark ruddy cheeks.... Allah sent down concerning him: 'To those who annoy the Prophet there is a painful doom." [9:61] "Gabriel came to Muhammad and said, 'If a black man comes to you his heart is more gross than a donkey's.'" <br>  <br>  Qur'an 9:97 "The Arabs of the desert are the worst in unbelief and hypocrisy, and most fitted to be in ignorance of the command which Allah hath sent down to His Messenger."<br>  <br>  Tabari II:11 "Shem, the son of Noah was the father of the Arabs, the Persians, and the Greeks; Ham was the father of the Black Africans; and Japheth was the father of the Turks and of Gog and Magog who were cousins of the Turks. Noah prayed that the prophets and apostles would be descended from Shem and kings would be from Japheth. He prayed that the African's color would change so that their descendants would be slaves to the Arabs and Turks."|`|bMt7eRmKaa	There is absolutely no concept of racism in Islam.

But in application, I believe there is little to no difference between Christians and Muslims.<br>  <br>  I've known really racist people from both religions.  I was shocked to discover that Arabs look down at Arabs from other countries even.  <br>  <br>  But then I've known Christians and Muslims that would make no distinction at all between races/skin colour.<br>  <br>  So the deciding factor here is the the religion itself and only Islam says it straight out.|`|8FbJjRpwaa	No you wouldnt be asked what race you are i think.<br>  Mashallah sister<br>  I think we are less racist =) as we are supposed to respect others religions.<br>  But sister every race or religion has its bad people, so dont let a few of them put you off =)|`|KqiiT1WSaa	Shahadah<br>  <br>  There is definately no racism in the muslim world.<br>  <br>  Since you can be yellow, brown, black, or any other colour and muslim, you can be any colour and hold significant position within the muslim community.<br>  <br>  Take a look at Bilal (ra) who was a companion of the prophet Muhammed (saw). Bilal (ra) was also initially a black slave, who was set free. So from this stature he is one of the most respected companions and holds a high place and position within the hearts of the muslim, he was also the mu'athin (person who makes call to prayer) which is a VERY high position in the islamic world. Who else during those times and even after those times would allow different race of people to hold high place in their community, just because their beliefs are one, yet their colours were different.|`|H8WqMK1eaa	If a "Christian" is being racist, then they obviously haven't read their Bible.<br>  <br>  "There is neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, male nor female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus.

We will not know the value of a blessing till we miss something and we may not know we were missing something unless we get it.<br>  <br>  Some one  in the court of a Khaleefa (Harun Rasheed or someone, I am not sure exactly) of Muslim was asked. ‘O King’ if you were to reach a desert where you fail to find a single drop of water. What would you give in return at such a state for a glass of water? The wise king said 'Half of my kingdom'. Now, what about if the water that has gone inside of your body never comes out as urine. What would you give in return for a cure? The king said 'the other half of my kingdom'. <br>  The scholar was just reminding his kingdom is no worth a glass of water we drink everyday. Hence even the simplest of blessing is great if we think about what would happen to us if we were to miss them.  Still there are small and great in human eyes.

It is still considered a "delicate" subject.<br>  By jewish law at that time, and considering that Joseph did not marry Mary until after she was pregnant, that would have made Jesus illegitimate. He would not have been considered Joseph's first son, denied inheritance, and would not have even been allowed to attend Joseph's funeral, etc.<br>  So, yes, I believe he may have been considered illegitimate, but his actual treatment by other people in his life may have been tempered by how Joseph "recognized"  and treated him.<br>  I don't know why people have trouble thinking of Jesus as a person who experienced human problems and situations.

Muslims respect all prophets in general, but Jesus in particular, because he was one of the prophets who foretold the coming of Muhammad. Muslims, too, await the second coming of Jesus. They consider him one of the greatest of Allah's prophets to mankind. A Muslim does not refer to him simply as "Jesus," but normally adds the phrase "peace be upon him" as a sign of respect. <br>  <br>  No other religion in the world respects and dignifies Jesus as Islam does. The Quran confirms his virgin birth (a chapter of the Quran is entitled "Mary"), and Mary is considered to have been one of the purest women in all creation. The Quran describes Jesus' birth as follows: <br>  <br>   "Behold!' the Angel said, God has chosen you, and purified you, and chosen you above the women of all nations. Mary, God gives you good news of a word from Him, whose name shall be the Messiah, Jesus son of Mary, honored in this world and in the Hereafter, and one of those brought near to God. He shall speak to the people from his cradle and in maturity, and he shall be of the righteous. She said: "My Lord! How shall I have a son when no man has touched me?' He said: "Even so; God creates what He will. When He decrees a thing, He says to it, 'Be!' and it is." [Noble Quran 3:42-47] <br>  <br>  Muslims believe that Jesus was born immaculately, and through the same power which had brought Eve to life and Adam into being without a father or a mother. <br>  <br>   "Truly, the likeness of Jesus with God is as the likeness of Adam. He created him of dust, and then said to him, 'Be!' and he was." [Noble Quran 3:59] <br>  <br>  During his prophetic mission, Jesus performed many miracles. The Quran tells us that he said: <br>  <br>   "I have come to you with a sign from your Lord: I make for you out of clay, as it were, the figure of a bird, and breathe into it and it becomes a bird by God's leave. And I heal the blind, and the lepers, and I raise the dead by God's leave." [Noble Quran 3:49] <br>  <br>  Muhammad and Jesus, as well as the other prophets, were sent to confirm the belief in one God. This is referred to in the Quran where Jesus is reported as saying that he came: <br>  <br>   "To attest the law which was before me, and to make lawful to you part of what was forbidden you; I have come to you with a sign from your Lord, so fear God and obey me." <br>  [Noble Quran 3:50] <br>  <br>  Prophet Muhammad emphasized the importance of Jesus by saying: "Whoever believes there is no god but Allah, alone without partner, that Muhammad is His messenger, that Jesus is a servant and messenger of God, His word breathed into Mary and a spirit emanating from Him, and that Paradise and Hell are true, shall be received by God into Heaven.

Regardless, it does refer to Mary the wife of Clophas as the sister of Mary the mother of Jesus. <br>  <br>  We can cross Simon off the list because Mark 3:18 tells us he is a Canaanite, "And Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus, and Simon the Canaanite..."<br>  <br>  Jude, we are told in Jude 1:1, is the "servant of Jesus Christ and the brother of James."<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  "Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary and the brother of James and Joses and Judas and Simon, and are not his sisters here with us?"

I would strongly advise you to do some research for yourself.  Go to Google and look up a man named Dave Hunt, then see what he has to say about Freemasonry.

It′s a develish institution.|`|AQBow7Glaa	The short answer is that Freemasonry started out in English pubs in the 17th century as a box club or dinner club, like a lot of other clubs that existed at the time.  The founders made up a fanciful history for themselves (Temple of Solomon, Knights Templar) not expecting anybody to really take it seriously.  Then it caught on and spread all over the world, mainly because of British Army regimental lodges founding new lodges during the British Imperial era (that's how it got to Australia btw).<br>  <br>  They're a men's support society like the Rotary or the Elks club.  They have secret handshakes and code phrases like any fraternity, but the code of behavior encourages the members to be ethical, responsible and hard-working.  There have been a lot of conspiracy theories about Masons over the years, but 99% of it is sensationalized hokum.<br>  <br>  This info is from years of study of the Mason's own documents (I'm not a Mason, but they don't keep secrets the way they used to--you can find it all at any library).|`|y4XOe4kUaa	I too am a christian.

First of all, I commend you for having the intelligence, courage and consideration to keep an open mind and do a little research rather than just accepting the opinion of others. I am always amazed by the number of people who have an opinion about masonry even though they have never been masons. I am a master mason and I assure you that I would not be a part of any organization that worships satan. Nor would I be a part of anything that would harm my loved ones.<br>    Masonry for me is, simply put, a way for me to meet like minded individuals wherever I may be. In my travels in the US and Canada, I've met many masons and their families. Masonry is a great way for me to put something back into my community. You've heard of the shriners? Yeah, the guys that ride the little cars and wear the funny hats in the parades, and what about the Shrine circus? Why do you suppose they do that? Ever heard of the Shriners children hospital? Yep, same Shriners. Do you know what all Shriners have in common? They're all masons. <br>    Now, let me debunk one of the other answers I saw here. You DO NOT have to be invited to become a mason. Quiet the opposite in fact. If you want to become a mason YOU HAVE TO ASK TO JOIN. Hence the bumper stickers you see that say: "2B1ASK1" <br>   I hope I've been able to help you.

5f80f1f151b797b394930ab7261f6128aa	I'm going to repeat this one more time and maybe it will get through your denseness and obdurance.<br>  <br>  The afterlife is a fundamental of Jewish belief!<br>  <br>  The creation of man testifies to the eternal life of the soul. The Torah says, "And the Almighty formed the man of dust from the ground, and He blew into his nostrils the SOUL of life" (Genesis 2:7). On this verse, the Zohar states that "one who blows, blows from within himself," indicating that the soul is actually part of G-d's essence. Since G-d's essence is completely spiritual and non-physical, it is impossible that the soul should die. (The commentator Chizkuni says this why the verse calls it "soul of LIFE.")<br>  <br>  That's what King Solomon meant when he wrote, "The dust will return to the ground as it was, and the spirit will return to G-d who gave it." (Ecclesiastes 12:17)<br>  <br>  For anyone who believes in a just and caring G-d, the existence of an afterlife makes logical sense. Could it be this world is just a playground without consequences? Did Hitler get away with killing 6,000,000 Jews? No. There is obviously a place where good people receive reward and bad people get punished. (see Maimonides' 13 Principles of Faith) The question of "why do bad things happen to good people" has a lot to do with how we look at existence. The way we usually perceive things is like this: A "good life" means that I make a comfortable living, I enjoy good health, and then I die peacefully at age 80. That's a good life. Anything else is "bad."<br>  <br>  In a limited sense, that's true. But if we have a soul and there is such a thing as eternity, then that changes the picture entirely. Eighty years in the face of eternity is not such a big deal.<br>  <br>  From Judaism's perspective, our eternal soul is as real as our thumb. This is the world of doing, and the "world to come" is where we experience the eternal reality of whatever we've become. Do you think after being responsible for the torture and deaths of millions of people, that Hitler could really "end it all" by just swallowing some poison? No. Ultimate justice is found in another dimension.<br>  <br>  But the concept goes much deeper. From an eternal view, if the ultimate pleasure we're going after is transcendence - the eternal relationship with the Almighty Himself, then who would be luckier: Someone who lives an easy life with little connection to G-d, or someone who is born handicapped, and despite the challenges, develops a connection with G-d. Who would be "luckier" in terms of eternal existence? All I'm trying to point out is that the rules of life start to look different from the point of view of eternity, as opposed to just the 70 or 80 years we have on earth.<br>  <br>  So what is the afterlife exactly?<br>  <br>  When a person dies and goes to heaven, the judgment is not arbitrary and externally imposed. Rather, the soul is shown two videotapes. The first video is called "This is Your Life!" Every decision and every thought, all the good deeds, and the embarrassing things a person did in private is all replayed without any embellishments. It's fully bared for all to see. That's why the next world is called Olam HaEmet - "the World of Truth," because there we clearly recognize our personal strengths and shortcomings, and the true purpose of life. In short, Hell is not the Devil with a pitchfork stoking the fires.<br>  <br>  The second video depicts how a person's life "could have been..." if the right choices had been made, if the opportunities were seized, if the potential was actualized. This video - the pain of squandered potential - is much more difficult to bear. But at the same time it purifies the soul as well. The pain creates regret which removes the barriers and enables the soul to completely connect to G-d.<br>  <br>  Not all souls merit Gehenom. It is for people who have done good but need to be purified. A handful of people are too evil for Gehenom, and they are punished eternally. Pharaoh is one example.<br>  <br>  So what about "heaven?"<br>  <br>  Heaven is where the soul experiences the greatest possible pleasure - the feeling of closeness to G-d. Of course not all souls experience that to the same degree. It's like going to a symphony concert. Some tickets are front-row center; others are back in the bleachers. Where your seat is located is based on the merit of your good deeds - e.g. giving charity, caring for others, prayer.<br>  <br>  A second factor in heaven is your understanding of the environment. Just like at the concert, a person can have great seats but no appreciation of what's going on. If a person spends their lifetime elevating the soul and becoming sensitive to spiritual realities (through Torah study), then that will translate into unimaginable pleasure in heaven. On the other hand, if life was all about pizza and football, well, that can get pretty boring for eternity.<br>  <br>  The existence of the afterlife is not stated explicitly in the Torah itself, because as human beings we have to focus on our task in this world. Though awareness of an eternal rew|`|0yTM98Odaa	Through rational thinking obviously.  Their concepts of the afterlife vary and make a lot more sense than Christian views of afterlife! <br>  <br>  More like how can anyone believe in eternal damnation from a loving God?!|`|zPfgFXU5aa	Because you could be dead and burnt to ashes as the OT suggests happens to sinners and God's or other people's memory of you being shamefull and worthy of contempt would be what was everlasting.<br>  <br>  Adam was never warned of "eternal torture." Thousands upon thousands were born after Adam and they were never warned about being tortured either they were told that the penalty for sin was death, that they would not get eternal life but would be burnt to ashes in the fire.<br>   <br>  How could God be so thoughtless and not warn millions of people of an even worse fate than death they did not even know awaited them?  But the fact of the matter is that Adam was never warned, he was told the penalty would be death, not eternal torment. <br>   <br>  If it was otherwise would not God have warned them?<br>   <br>  <br>  Likewise Abraham never heard of "eternal torment." Moses, who brought the Creator's Law into the world was told that "the wages of sin is death," (destroyed in the fire). He was never ever warned about being roasted, toasted, and endlessly tortured for all eternity.<br>  <br>  Not a word came from the lips of  Isaac or Jacob about an endless hell. Likewise,  Joshua, the Judges of Israel and the Psalmists are silent on the matter. <br>  <br>  The prophets of Israel and Judah, though they say much of God's wrath, fail to teach anything about torments after death.|`|bgA9wLD0aa	KJV has been demonstrated to be inaccurate many times.  such as interpolating 'witch' for 'poisoner', shifting tense to claim some passages are prophetic, and cutting it up into chapters to isolate some passages from their context.<br>  <br>  also, only the first five books of the septuagint were translated by jews.  the rest were translated by christians.<br>  <br>  this is all clearly documented and accepted by everybody but obstinate fundies.<br>  <br>  so, jews can interpret it as they please, and if they say hell is a christian invention then, by god, it must be a christian invention.|`|s7pqFa1eaa	Clearly you are attempting to read into the verse something that it doesn't say.

If you are rich you are called to give much not just your ten percent.<br>  <br>  23Then Jesus said to his disciples, "I tell you the truth, it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven. 24Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God." <br>  <br>   25When the disciples heard this, they were greatly astonished and asked, "Who then can be saved?" <br>  <br>   26Jesus looked at them and said, "With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible."<br>  <br>  29And everyone who has left HOUSES or brothers or sisters or father or mother[f] or children or fields for my sake will receive a hundred times as much and will inherit eternal life. 30But many who are first will be last, and many who are last will be first.|`|WcuU7IZ7aa	I gotta say I think I'm just gonna stop reading these questions. Of course we see the corruption. Do you think we like it? Don't you think we get a little sick of having to explain ourselves and people like you assuming we are all the same? Why don't you try talk to Christians, not on this web site, and find out what they really know and what they are all about. I am a Christian and nothing you ever say or write is going to enlighten me or make me "wake up" because I am already awake. And nothing I ever say is going to wake you up because I don't think you need to wake up. I just think you need to stop worrying about other peopl's religion so much and focus on yourself.

Your broken arm will heal and you will be able to pick up with your baseball practises where you left off.<br>  <br>  Life is all about girls turning you down.   It's a valuable lesson to learn that it isn't the end of the world and that there are still other girls out there who won't turn you down.<br>  <br>  It's all part of growing up to learn how to deal with the disappointments in life.   It's something we all have to learn to do.|`|NaM4ZT64aa	1) You are only 13.  Therefore, you have never even *met* the girl of your dreams, let alone been turned down by her.  <br>  <br>  2) You are not going to play major league baseball.  <br>  <br>  No offense, but those a pretty lame reasons to give up on life.

You don't have the emotional capacity to do anything about it if you meet the girl of your dreams.<br>  <br>  Oh, yeah, and no afterlife by the way.  Nothing.  Kaput.  No baseball in heaven for you, I'm afraid.  You can play again if you just wait for your arm to heal, but not if you die.<br>  <br>  And give up on that "I need to be major league" **** right now.  That's American hollow, soulless materialism right there.  What you've done there is taken the inexplicable need Americans have to have a nicer house and car than their neighbor and turned that on baseball.<br>  <br>  That attitude never makes anyone happy.|`|Eo7KcX3Waa	If you are a Christian, then take your walk with the Lord serious...don't' go out there looking for a girl of your dream, start praying to God now for your wife, and He will bring your soul mate into your life in the perfect season, when you are ready for it...<br>  As far as baseball, there are many reasons why God does not want you to play this season, maybe He wants you to concentrate on Him and then next season, He will make you a star at this sport...<br>  "Seek ye first the Kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added unto you "|`|zezIM9B5aa	Oh honey, you are only 13. There will be plenty of girls out there and your preference of women will change over the years, too. Trust me. My uncle played in the minors and had a chance at playing in the majors. Until he busted his knee. He is now a judge in Florida and loves his life! So sometimes life gets us down, but we find out later that our disappointments happened for the best. Keep your chin up. You've got your whole life ahead of you. And pray. When you are feeling down and lost, simply pray and ask for guidance. This always helps me. Good luck.|`|8vAxlg2Daa	Wow! your 13 and already thinking about giving up your life, trust me don't give up, there are plenty of girls that you will meet, and think their the one.

Life is full of rejections and disappointments.  But it's also full of many wonderful things you will miss out on if you do give up on life.<br>  <br>  Your dreams also will change many, many times during your lifetime.

Things seem rough right now, but in a few weeks you'll wonder why you were so down. <br>  <br>  Your arm will be healed before the season starts. So what if you miss a few practices! It happens. If you're meant to be a baseball great, a few missed practices for a broken arm won't prevent you from excelling! <br>  <br>  And that girl of your dreams will be one of probably many. You will probably discover that she did you a favor because a better one will be coming along. <br>  <br>  Disappointment is sometimes part of life. Overcoming adversity makes you stronger and a little wiser; and it gives you empathy for others in similar and far worse situations. And trust me, there are far worse situations!|`|XwuZYLg1aa	Please take time to talk to a trusted adult in person -- a school counselor or religious leader perhaps.

You're only 13, there's still a lot of cool stuff out there especially once you're a legal adult.  <br>  <br>  If you're just saying you're giving up on Christianity, I'd argue this might be a good thing.  Religions try to indoctrinate people from birth, getting away from religion and trying things with a different perspective might help you see things in a different, healthier light.
c9fWiIlVaa	I'll tell you I've been in a similar situation. I've got siblings on my facebook and I've got to be extra careful of what I post otherwise it goes back to my Dad so I understand. It does happen and you've just got to talk to your parents and explain what happened. They should understand because you are a teenager and we say things out of anger and let our emotions get the better of us.|`|g54tGcRvaa	I'm a lot more careful about what I put on my social networking profiles now that I know my parents can see them.

Then accept whatever punishment goes along with it-you're likely to lose computer privileges for awhile.|`|f4ik0ScQaa	Sh*t happens.  If this is the worst thing that ever happens in your life then you'll be very lucky.<br>  Hopefully your parents will understand that you're a teenager and teenagers sometimes behave strangely and thus be forgiving.|`|Y3LPXeuEaa	There's no need for you to be afraid.  This really doesn't sound like a big deal.  If your parents ask about it, just explain why you were upset.  I think they'll understand.

This means that I don't feel the need to wash my hands right before eating, because it probably isn't that long since I last washed them. I also get very dry, sensitive skin, and if I washed my hands all the time they'd get really sore and itchy.<br>  <br>  If it's me cooking the food, I always wash my hands before and after, especially before and after touching raw meat.<br>  <br>  I'm always kind of suspicious of eating food someone has cooked in their house if I don't know them well, just in case they haven't washed their hands between using the toilet and cooking. But I'm okay with fast food places and restaurants because I used to work in fast food and I know how strict the rules are.|`|9dd2ac44728dd565acf459d4a4e730d0aa	I think you may be right. I can't bear to eat with unwashed hands, but perhaps others are less fussy. I'm usually too busy to take in those details.<br>  <br>  However, I have noticed that many apparently well educated people don't wash their hands after going to the lavatory. This really shocks me. There is no excuse for this.

And they neglect to wash their hands after they use the bathroom also. That is also why so many people get sick. Apparently some use hand sanitizers but according to scientists, hand sanitizers are creating more antibacterial resistant germs. It's just better to use plain soap and water they say, than to use hand sanitizers.|`|IhCfOMzTaa	i don't usually wash my hands before i eat because i was brought up in a home with a mum that sprays every surface with antiseptic cleaner. my dad believes the immune system is built up by contact with germs, and since my family is vegetarian we can't catch salmonella or ecoli or any meat-related diseases.|`|UUyWaMDGaa	Where i am now it is the norm and i make it a norm for me to do. <br>  <br>  But some people will not wash their hand even thou they know they are to.  <br>  <br>  What you can try is having a bottle of hand sanitizer near by at the next party and see if they will use it.

He speaks for no one but his own group. I would pity the the nurses who'd have to deal with him but Fred Phelps belongs in a mental institution.<br>  <br>  According to Phelps, just living in a country that tolerates gays is enough to bring God's wrath down upon you.

Since He is a spirit and doesn't have either male or female genitalia, I generally use the masculine pronoun out of pure conventionality.<br>  <br>  God is as much "She" as "He" and insofar as He is neither male nor female, "It" too.|`|LF4vun1maa	I think it's some kind of by proxy "I've got a huge penis" thing.<br>  <br>  Like how theists fantasize about how their god will destroy us all.

The real sin though is in committing adultery. While most think of adultery as cheating on a spouse, the church has a wide definition of the word, which includes lusting for someone.

JmZQXyyyaa	There is a story in the bible, and sorry I dont memorize passages, that explains a man who ha prophecy, but incites other people to follow him (which I suppose is a little like making money).  This is condemned in the bible.  So those who "predict" earthquakes are looking to incite.  Those seeking advice from a fortune teller are looking for information without God's.  True prophecy is declared, whether people listen or not.<br>  As to whether fortune tellers get their info from God, well, those with a gift could be getting their knowledge from God, but there are a lot of deceptive people out there.  In addition, there are those with a gift who exploit it and 'elaborate.'  Sylvia Browne makes me ill, as she may have a gift, but look what she has turned it into!  Nowdays, what prophet would be noted as such without standing in front of a crowd proclaiming, "I am a prophet, you should listen to me!"  And isn't that exactly what the bible puts down?|`|AA12346187	Fortune  tellers  do it for money    where prophets  just speak what God tells them.  fortune  tellers  are  normally in  contact with spirits  not God.|`|m1V5ws73aa	Good point.  If prophecy is considered improper (I wouldn't go so far as to say it's evil), then just putting the word Christian in front of it doesn't change anything, it's just hypocrisy.  I have no problem with Christianity as a faith, but I have seen too many so-called Christians use that word as an excuse and a justification to say and do things which are very un-Christian and which even harm others.  That's a human failing, not a Christian one.|`|mrzeXJ6Eaa	How do you know that fortune tellers are getting their info from sprits and that christians aren't.<br>  <br>  Good question. Here is the answer:<br>  Deuteronomy 18:19-22  If anyone does not listen to my words that the prophet speaks in my name, I myself will call him to account.  (20)  But a prophet who presumes to speak in my name anything I have not commanded him to say, or a prophet who speaks in the name of other gods, must be put to death."  (21)  You may say to yourselves, "How can we know when a message has not been spoken by the LORD?"  (22)  If what a prophet proclaims in the name of the LORD does not take place or come true, that is a message the LORD has not spoken. That prophet has spoken presumptuously. Do not be afraid of him.|`|F7y1BZ4Maa	You answered your own question--"a fortune teller MAY get their info from god,"<br>  <br>  A prophet ALWAYS gets information from God.|`|YIElevidaa	Most Christian religions believe god is more or less "done talking now." The bible has been written and so they are just waiting for revelations.|`|vJrrcPJGaa	its all a load of crap. Fortune tellers read ppl very well. They use a process of vague yet common ideologies to fool a person into believing what is being said is their future and many silly ppl go out of their way to make the so called future happen. On the otherhand christianity and prophecy is a narrative. It is a sort of fiction which tries to make human beings believe in a higher power to which faith will sub conciously make a human form boundaries so laws will be followed. If religion didnt exist mankind would find that the society would cease to exist cause each person would do wat suites and pleases them. The laws of society could not function without religion, so society has exaggerated religion as a safeguard to keeping a civilised society|`|aNgKR6CHaa	"prophetic" words are condoned all the time"<br>  That is quit an assumption..Like most assumptions,this one is false..<br>  Many prophets talked about many other things such as Resurrection,Paradise,etc.Fortune Tellers get their "Predictions" from the Devil whether you believe or not.The Bible said the Devil would act as "angel of light"...meaning he would pretend to be good but in reality he was evil.God cant work with both sides.You are either in the light or in the dark...U cant be iin both.As the bible Predicted in Mathew 24:24 there would "arouse fake prophets" in the last days.

In fact, we have been told in the Quran and hadith that actually the blame was more on Adam. <br>  <br>  And the story is different from the depiction in the bible, in that, although, they made a mistake and caused the anger of God, God taught them words of repentance. They then aked for forgiveness and were forgiven. <br>  <br>  What they learned was more of an original lesson (based on forgiveness) as opposed to an original sin..<br>  <br>  God then put them on earth and said that this will your dwelling place for a while. Meaning that we as humanity will be here until the day of judgement.|`|LZJPMl8raa	Because it was God's command to NOT eat the fruit. Also, once they ate the fruit, they knew what was right and wrong so God knew no one does good as it is our human nature to sin. <br>  <br>  That's why after eating the fruits, both Adam and Eve realized they were naked and had to cover themselves.|`|aPuj6xoHaa	She disobeyed God, that is why she was punished.  Knowledge is not bad, but to consider oneself equal to God, is wrong.|`|db7df25ea31227e5641d5c32d43c3bcdaa	nothing is wrong with knowledge<br>  <br>  it was a sin because God sid no do not eat from the tree<br>  <br>  Eve disobeyed and did what God told her not to do.|`|Ne9rXERpaa	Because people who seek knowledge ask annoying questions like, "So WHY do I need to put my money in the collection plate, again...?"|`|RuOTJLyvaa	The more knowledge we gain the less we need god...|`|SfqqhIfjaa	God wanted Eve to have complete faith in him, to accept that all things are because he made them be. Basically, when she ate of the tree of knowledge, she said "i don't trust you, I want to know for myself." God wants complete submission. In reality when this story was made people wanted the masses to accept this new religion freely and reject the old religion. They didn't want the people to compare the two. <br>       If you look at the religions that the God of Abraham replaced you will find references of a snake gods. In fact many religions including Hinduism use snakes as a form of idol. The God of Abraham specifically states that he will not abide in idol worship. The snake is put in the story of the garden of Eden as a representation of the evil religion that was being replaced. It's very common for the idol of one religion to become the bad guy, in terms of the new one.|`|TbO57owAaa	It was obedience.

The story of Adam and Eve was a direct attempt by an up and coming patriarchal society and religion to denounce women and make them "evil."  They felt the need to do this mostly because in the Pagan societies predating Christianity, women were complete equals both in society and in religion and were in lead roles in both as well.  And a patriarchal society (and religion) could not have women in such roles, hence the need to demonize women.|`|AA12193600	What's interesting is that if she had no knowledge of good and evil--then she didn't know eating of the tree was wrong--by definition.  Kind of makes your god a little on the capricious side doesn't it.  Kind of like slapping the crap out of an infant for touching something you left close to it.  If there is no knowledge of good and evil, then it is incumbent on the person who does know to keep things he doesn't want them in away from their ability to get to it.  I'd give the xtian god a big FAIL on that story--and also think he needs to be charged with ABUSE.|`|JTD3M8Ziaa	Because she was the first one to realize that religion is complete horseshit.|`|N8wutNoLaa	knowledge of good and evil, meaning from that point on, man was the god of their own universe.

They are both prophets or Messengers of Allah (God), and they were both sent to their respective peoples to deliver messages from Allah (God). When they do meet each other they will definitely wish each other well, kiss each other on the cheeks, and talk about their missions as well as the resistance (and difficulties they had) met from their respective peoples in trying to deliver the true messages from Allah (God).|`|bMt7eRmKaa	Muhammad (Peace be upon him) was a prophet as well as Jesus with the difference that Jesus belonged to a previous Era.

Not at all.

Catholics do not believe that we can work our way to heaven...however we do believe that we are to be living witnesses of his life.   This means that while Christ died for our sins...he did not want us to keep on sinning and becoming destructive and useless vessels.   We are to repent...turn away from our sinful nature and take on the nature of Christ...so that people will come to know Christ by our example.   Yes, this means as a living witness of Christ's love that I will feed the hungry, I will give to the poor, and I will love my enemies.   I am called to do this.   The word of God should be more than verses and scripture.   It should be lived out in our lives and as Christ said should be written on our hearts.   The word of God is just a book if you are not living what it contains.   This is what the Catholic faith believes.|`|D6yEjfciaa	the people who said that are already past that stage.they have already found grace, now what are they gonna do. can you have grace and then sit around and do nothing. no you can't. once you expierence grace all you can think about is working for the lord. and these people tell eachother hey why aren't you working don't you want to go to heaven. then the baby christians hear the older christians talking and then they go around saying you have to work to get to heaven.this is true for the christians who have been born again.catholics are born again but they don't call it being born again they call it living in grace|`|LF4vun1maa	Man... the bible is supposed to be so bloody important, but I don't think most of you faith-heads have actually read the thing.<br>  <br>  The part where Jesus uses his powers to blow up a fig tree for no real reason is my favorite part.  It's just so weird.<br>  <br>  At any rate... if you've bothered to read the Gospels Jesus wants people to do good works, and he makes himself pretty ******* clear about it.  This whole "Grace alone" business popped up many years later as a high-minded, supposedly righteous, reason to be utterly useless.|`|iAXmdQOEaa	By grace alone doesnt save us. We need to be baptized and follow a life in Christ. there are many verses in the scriptures that state this clearly.  <br>  <br>  Mark 16 v 16  He who believes and is baptized will be saved; but he who does not believe will be condemned.<br>  <br>  ACTS 2 V 38   Then Peter said to them, “Repent, and let every one of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins; and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.<br>  <br>  Romans  6 vs. 3-5:-<br>  "Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death? Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life. For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection".<br>  <br>  Acts 2 v 46   For they heard them speak with tongues and magnify God.Then Peter answered, <br>  47   “Can anyone forbid water, that these should not be baptized who have received the Holy Spirit just as we have?” <br>  48    And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord. Then they asked him to stay a few days.<br>  <br>  there are so many other verses too.   When the scriptures talk about grace and just believing in christ that you will be saved, they mean that Christ is the only way to salvation and believing in someone else is not good enough.|`|mNyhRGowaa	People will be people look at Israel how many wonders and signs God did for them and they still turned.

Justification is the beginning of our free response to God, that is our faith in Christ and our cooperation with the grace of the Holy Spirit.

You don't know every Catholic in the world, and you're a pretty poor psychic if you're trying to tell us what we believe and do.<br>  <br>  Walk into my very Christian Catholic home, and you will see reminders of Jesus Christ our Lord and Savior in every room -- from the crucifix that greets you when you walk in the door to the picture of Christ hanging on my bedroom wall. You will also find reminders of our loving Mother Mary in every room, as well.  <br>  <br>  The two things go together because Mary always points us to her Son. That's exactly what she did at the wedding feast at Cana when she told the servants, "Do whatever He tells you." That's exactly what she does now.<br>  <br>  Which is something you'd know if you'd ever stopped your Catholic bashing long enough to pay attention to what we've tried to tell you. If you aren't just another troll but are genuinely a "real" (sic) Christian, your brand of bigotry is causing great shame to our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. <br>  <br>  And please note the use of the word "our."

Your version of your religion is the only good one in the world, despite the fact that there are about 10,000 religions in the world, and many more denominations of Christianity.

Don't worry though, because they aren't bull headed enough to punish people for not believing in them.

THAT is the definition of a god of love.<br>  <br>  But to answer your question after chewing you out for being a self-righteous snob, I suppose you have absolutely NO pictures of anyone or anything but Jesus.

vHxauOyeaa	I actually have a theory but neither creationists or evolutionists like it probably. <br>  <br>  I have a vast understanding of science so hear me out... <br>  <br>  We are created of matter that has existed before us.<br>  Everything according to science was probably within a singularity, one smallest point with an incredible amount of energy, almost infinite. <br>  They use the big bang to symbolize what happened and so on the universe was formed and from that expansion it will return to a singularity eventually. <br>  <br>  As far as evolution goes, I feel like as we reproduce our offspring are more adapted due to our experience. Seen in missing Wisdom teeth and appendixes <br>  <br>  As far as creationism goes, well I'm not really sure, but science can't find the exact link between us and apes, so we might have adapted but possibly from a more similar design than apes. <br>  <br>  As far as past lives go, I don't necessarily believe in a heaven or hell because science would suggest that no energy may be created nor destroyed so the simplest explaination is that we disintegrate, the electricity in our brains (our soul or personality) will disperse through our bodies and decompose with the rest allowing us to become molecules that are in the air and the ground, trees and such and then animals including humans will ingest thereby helping move life along. <br>  <br>  More of a recycled use, no conscious being though unfortunately. <br>  <br>  Existence is just as we know it, we should not fear death because we will not know that we are dead. we should not fear our relatives pain because with all pain comes relief. <br>  <br>  The purpose of life is simply to live, try to be happy, struggle through the hard times simply because it gives you something of a basis of comparison. Respect our fellow humans and other animals and plants. Find love, have children to keep the race going, make a mark on society... <br>  These are all good things. <br>  We all go eventually, and hopefully we are remembered in a good light. <br>  <br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|AA10641825	Meaning, like pain and color and worry, exist only the brain.

Why do people target Jews, atheists, Muslims, gay people, etc...? There is no particular target on Christians. I have to say that as an atheist if someone could demonstrate some real evidence for the existence of a deity I would be willing to consider it. Many theists I know would never no matter how irrational their beliefs were shown to be change their position. People lash out when they perceive others are a threat and intolerant. Some Christians are very intolerant and wish to impose their religious views on others. This is threatening to those who want to live in a secular society. If we could all just agree to disagree and live and let live it might work better. The situation unfortunately, is not so.

Please show some and we can talk.|`|06aceb1d90d3755e9049c8a9a59210ddaa	You do realise that in the Western world, Christians are the majority and are in no way being oppressed, right?<br>  <br>  Christians aren't called closed minded or whatever for believing in God, it's fundimentalist Christians that either attempt to spread their religion or demonise others.  I agree that they don't represent the group as a whole, but they certainly don't help give you a good name.<br>  <br>  For example - the recent atheism bus campaign was a response to a Christian bus compaign that displayed an internet URL on the side of a bus that, when visited, said that all non-Christians would burn in Hell.  An atheist saw this and decided that the message featured in the atheist campaign would be more positive than telling non-Christians they were going to burn forever, and I agree.  Now we have more Christian campaigns that insult and ridicule atheists with such out of context quotations from the bible as "The fool says in his heart, there is no God" etc.  Does that really sound like benevolent Christians at work?|`|XqpRYh52aa	If you ask a vast majority of atheists if they are 100% certain that a god does not exist most will say no and that they don't dismiss the possibility outright.<br>  If you ask all Christians if they are 100% certain that their god exists,they will say yes without a doubt even though there is no evidence to show.<br>  Now,you tell me who is closed minded.|`|d5368f798fac0323fe025ec0d32f5be6aa	because something sooo popular just gets way more attention. Just like Barry Bonds, Arod, Obama, etc. Bible #1 selling book ever, #1 religion, etc... Just the way its gonna be. Athiests are the worst. Their stance on no god and how mean and funny they sound trying to convince you that your beliefs are wrong. Who cares, stay out of my business is what id say to them and ill stay out of yours.|`|tpX1apEIaa	Well, if someone ASKS you if you believe in God, and you answer yes, and the person says that you are an idiot, then definitely, that person is a paedophile and shouldn't be respected. In my humble opinion.|`|WZsP5Xcbaa	Men love the darkness and hate the light.  Jesus said the world would hate those who followed Him (addressed to His disciples) as it hated Him.  It is no different today.  To those who do not and will not believe our message, it is the smell of death.  To those who are being saved it is the aroma of life.  That is just the way it is.|`|XN0cYCATaa	It is because Christianity makes very high claims concerning Gods existence which challenges their atheism and pokes holes in their vacuum.  They like the vacuum.  They like having the universe with only one god in it:  themselves|`|79529314dfb5ac7be366558924c3393baa	>Why do people target Christianity?<br>  <br>  Because it's an absurd, irrational belief.<br>  <br>  >Most moderate Christians just stick to their religion and don't denounce atheists or those of other religions.<br>  <br>  Maybe so, but the problem extends farther than that. For example, in many western countries, churches are not required to pay any taxes; whether the people in those churches go around trying to convert/condemn others or not, this still has an economic effect on everyone else. Furthermore, there are many christians who may not go around to other adults in their community and try to convert/condemn them, but may still indoctrinate their children with their religious beliefs while the children are still too young to have developed a rational attitude of skepticism. And finally, the efforts by many christians (and, for that matter, other theists as well) to make their ridiculous religious beliefs considered acceptable and valid in their society tends to further overall an overall philosophy of irrationality and dogma, and also gives validation to the more extremist members of their religion. The negative effects of religions, christianity included, go well beyond merely a few individuals trying to directly push their religion on strangers on an individual basis.<br>  <br>  >It makes me wonder whether people are atheists because they truly don't believe (and just don't discuss it) or are trying to make a political statement by openly bashing it.<br>  <br>  Atheism is defined as the belief that God at least probably does not exist, and any TRUE atheist must hold this belief. As a true atheist myself, I concede that there are probably many people calling themselves atheists who don't actually reject the existence of God, however I doubt they're in the majority, and in any case I don't think it's a valid technique for theists to try to lump all atheists in that category for any reason whatsoever.<br>  <br>  >Why, when asked if they believe in God, are Christians called closed-minded, unintelligent, idiots?<br>  <br>  Because they believe that they are being watched over by a cosmic jewish zombie who was his own father and requires you to ceremonially eat his flesh while telepathically communicating with him so that he can purify something called a 'soul' which has never been detected in any way so that you can go to a place called 'Heaven' which has never been detected in any way either.<br>  <br>  See what I mean? When you put christianity in its most literal terms, it becomes fairly clear that we're talking about here is really no better than a fantasy story. Is there really any more basis for believing in the statements of the Bible as than believing in the statements of the Harry Potter books, or the Lord of the Rings, or the Narnia Series, or Star Wars, or any of those? Not much. People don't believe the statements of the Bible because it's the rational thing to do, they believe in the statements of the Bible because, despite it NOT being rational to do so, it remains highly comforting, and many people have a psychology such that to be comforted in the short term is more important to them than to believe that which it is most rational to believe. THIS is what we atheists refer to as close-mindedness, faith, dogma, whatever you like to call it, and it is one of the most terrible, harmful, anti-progressive things any human has ever come up with.|`|LF4vun1maa	It's not believing in god or not that marks people as closed-minded.  It's in the discussion as to why or why not that Christian announce themselves to have stopped thinking.<br>  <br>  Christians frequently claim nothing could ever shake their faith in their god.  They are proud of this.  *Nothing* could change their minds.  They literally boast that they are closed-minded.  On the other hand, If my understanding of things things turned out to be wrong, if the world was not what I thought it was, if something drastic changed, if some new information would come forward and change the equation, I am prepared to reconsider the existence of gods.<br>  <br>  I've seen Christians laugh off the concept they should understand evolution before they claim it is false, saying atheists don't understand creationists, then immediately refuse to explain their understanding of creationism, because atheists don't need to know it since they don't believe in it.  Understanding both sides of a question and making a descision based on it is literally an alien concept to the sort of Christian who shows up on Y!A to argue against atheism.<br>  <br>  It's not that believing in god makes you closed-minded.  It's that being closed-minded is how you believe in god.|`|P1Sl55Coaa	Exactly.  Their supposed disbelief has nothing to do with the evidence, it's a control thing.  In fact, God put the delusion in their heads.  Take a look at 1st Thess, 2:9-11.  God knows more about atheists than they think He does.  He actually predicted them, and allows them to not believe.  They attack christians because they can't hurt God, so hurting his children is the next best thing.  They hate the truth and prefer lies.  I just hope they come to their senses before it's too late.|`|hXecFLRyaa	I seems like it is cool to not believe. Especially with younger people. It's so Hollywood to want to look into the different "religions" like the one Madonna practices. It is a proven fact that unbelievers are not as educated as people who do believe. Christians are to pray for those people and not bash them.|`|NnzSeFhbaa	people target our religion because 1. they know its true 2. They are arrogant jerks that wont let us Christians have something close to us. 3. They just don't want other people to be happy because they are not happy 4. Christianity and Catholicism is already a HUGE part the world and people hate that for some reason. they hate it because since they believe there is no God, or hates God, Satan will come into there life and enforce these ideas such as hating God, not believing in Him, and not being happy|`|5LP8FyzAaa	Look, you can worship a walnut for all I care. That don't concern me. But what does concern me is the fact that Christianity tries to exalt its alleged authority over the whole of the earth. That includes me. And that is where I have serious issues with Christians. Basically, keep thy religion to thine self. And we'll all get along just fine.|`|98b7b423daceccfb5d1e38552d20dd75aa	Most moderate Christians just stick to their religion ....... really? is that what's happening when christians try to push their beliefs into the government that governs everyone? to really be open minded you must let others think and do for themselves.|`|Y3LPXeuEaa	It's not the moderate Christians who are drawing the fire.  Most people are fine with Christians who just stick to their own religion.  It's the fundamentalists and evangelists that upset people.|`|XzXpDPpfaa	I'm sorry?<br>  More like MOST Christians force religion on others and denounce anybody not of their faith.<br>  <br>  WE'RE close minded?<br>  I think perhaps you need to OPEN your eyes.|`|XBI9ekydaa	Accept Jesus or ROT IN HELL FOREVER!|`|STs2ouqRaa	Alright, most moderate Christians stick to their religion. I'll accept that. But how many actual "moderate" Christians are there in the whole span of the religion?<br>  <br>  My problem with Christians is that the majority of them that I've had contact with, or observed, have a lovely way of trying to force their religion down non-believers throats. I'm all for them believing what they want, but leave me, and my beliefs, alone. <br>  <br>  The reason I believe MOST Christians are close-minded, unintelligent idiots is because while they are forcing their beliefs on other people, most of the time, they don't even know exactly what it is they're subscribing to, or WHY they believe what they do. I don't mind having a debate or discussion about religion with someone who's educated enough about their beliefs to explain them to me. When you question a Christian's beliefs or debate something that they've said, the answer is usually something like "because the Bible says so." Yes, this is ignorant, and yes, you sound stupid. <br>  <br>  I'm not atheist. I'm not Christian. I'm not any religion really, but only because most organized religions that I come in contact with seem so seriously flawed that I can't possibly feel right about jumping in and joining their little cult. I'm very spiritual. I believe that nothing in this life is ever just coincidence and that there has to be some greater power guiding us along. But I don't call it God. Or Buddha, or anything else. I'm perfectly open to the suggestion that one religion might be THE religion and the right way to go, but before that happens, someone with an actual knowledge of what they believe, who can discuss it without bashing any other religion, or saying that they're wrong and all going to hell no matter how wonderful of a person they are, it's not going to happen. <br>  <br>  To jajajajamie: Thank you for being a tolerant Christian, and being respectful of other's beliefs. If there were more of you around people might not be having discussions like this at all. <br>  <br>  To DylanV: If atheists knew your religion was true, wouldn't they stop being atheists and be Christians? Also, who said atheists aren't happy? Or that they're mean? You may be right that they dislike Christianity and Catholicism because they're a huge part of the world. Nobody wants every government being taken over by a belief system that they don't subscribe to and subsequently having that religion stuffed down their throats not only with fundamentalists and evangelists but with laws governing their daily lives. <br>  <br>  To Kissthepilot: Atheists hate the truth? More like they hate YOUR truth. Just because the Bible says it's true does not make it so. If anything, a great number of non-believers love the truth far more than narrow-minded Christians or followers of any religion that refuse to believe any other explanation. The difference is that they're searching for the REAL truth, not the truth as a Christian or Catholic, Jew or Buddhist defines it.

bMt7eRmKaa	My friend, Your question has no direct relation with Hijjab. If some man no mater he is a Muslim or not, rapes a woman, he is liable for punishment in Islam. Hijjab makes no difference in this law. <br>  Hijjab is only due for women because it decreases likeliness of sexual attraction between men and women which results in illegal sexual relations.  If a man cannot see a woman, he wont develop such sexual attraction which can be developed in his mind after seeing that woman without Hijjab this Hijjab decreases chances of sexual offenses. <br>  I hope my answer was helpful for you.|`|Q4IguUL6aa	This was one of a couple of gang rapes from 2000-2002 in Sydney, Australia. The perpetrators were 4 brothers from a family who had just arrived from Pakistan. They said they had been brought up by their father to believe that women who didnt wear hijab were asking for sex etc.<br>  <br>  This is a parental issue not a religious one. The fault lies directly with the parents in teaching morals to their sons.|`|hAVZgBmjaa	Its nothing to do with Jilbab or the muslim.<br>  Jilbab is just a cloth not a symbol.<br>  Nowadays many muslims use it as a symbol of their true faith.<br>  Others just for following trends and fashion.<br>  <br>  If you ever read holy bible or the Middle East history, you will find that most women were using jilbab to protect their self from the environment.<br>  It was happen long time before Islam even born..|`|sw08ARSZaa	Can you cite a source please? I'd like to read the story.<br>  <br>  To answer your question though, this is why Islam isn't met with acceptance in the western world the same way Christianity and Judaism are. Islam is the same barbaric religion it was five-hundred years ago. The idea that a woman invites abuse or rape is pure cowardice on the part of the perpetrators. The courts in Sharia governed countries require that two women be present to testify against the testimony of one man.<br>  <br>  As for your 'private dancer' scenario. No, there is no argument for forced sex. It doesn't matter what the victim's behavior prior to the assault. If at any time she says 'No' and the other party doesn't stop, it's rape.|`|AA12346187	I am afraid that is the case  from a young age  muslim boys  are taught women are  for sex  and that  any girl not cider is free game.  in muslims  countries a woman  claiming rape is  imprisoned or stoned to death.  they have  no  rights  if they are out alone  they are to blame.|`|s7pqFa1eaa	Dude, your religion is all about male dominance and control. All humans should be free to make their own decisions as to how to live their lives and certainly how to dress. Islam has never been interested in democracy nor has Islam supported or even allowed it to flourish in the countries that it controls.<br>  <br>  Her profession or sexual proclivities should have no bearing on being raped.

Hijab or not, they are required to lower their gaze, not approach them, or touch them at all. That's like saying it's not the burglar's fault, 'cause the door was open. They're claim has no basis in Islam.|`|YIElevidaa	Interesting.<br>  <br>  It would also might mean the courts would morally condone the raping of women from the countries they visit that do not wear hijab even if they didn't legally condone it.|`|0lTNy27saa	The men must also honor their hijab, to lower there gaze and to have modest thoughts.  The men are in the wrong period.
