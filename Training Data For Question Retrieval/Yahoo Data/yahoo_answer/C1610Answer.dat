PIhHDThoaa	no there is no way of bus route from there and u r talking about this car ferry u will not find any such type of connection between them|`|cWuumdy7aa	There is no ferry between India and Pakistan karachi falls in pakistan and sea travel is not allowed between the two countries.|`|lLJuegK5aa	There is no safety of life of tourists in Pakistan and Afghanistan, especially in North East area. Avoid them by all means.<br>  Think of ordering and buying Indian Cars from their foreign distributors instead.<br>  Real cheaper will be Tata and Maruti (Suzuki) or Hyudai makes. Mahindra in 4x4. if buying in India,  ask about shipping cost by Cargo. Shipping may be expensive. What type of car are you looking for?<br>  first of all you will have to make your choice of make and model, because now a days all major international makers are competing with Tata in small and medium sized cars (and even BMW and Merc have plans but not to be sold cheap any way). <br>  They all have entered indian market because of very cheap labour and material that makes car manufactured at very low cost. though claimed aimed for indian consumers but with capicity to export back to mainland europe, eastern Europe, Middle east, Latin America and Africa.<br>  For you best look for sites of overseas importers. Best you inquire directly on Tata's, Mahindra's or Maruti's sites to find out appointed distributors and suppliers abroad. <br>  nearest to order, buy and drive could be in Netherlands.<br>  There are suppliers of Tata and Mahindra in England too. I have seen few Tata running even in Shetland Islands (which is closest to Burgen, Norway overnight ferry) were brought via Aberdeen, Scotland originally bought from England UK and driven to top.<br>  or cheapest in any eastern european country (bordering middle east), Dubai(UAE), Algeria or Iran; but would carry hassle to get visa and clearance papers to pass through all countries if your purchased car can not be insured from your home country. Looking for fun driving and travel exploration experience as well? then plan out a long vacation!!! otherwise bringing a car would turn out expensive.<br>  Good luck in your search.
7toznquyaa	The Coral Towers is one of the older towers.. more than 40 years old.   It was not built as part of Atlantis.  The rooms are similar to a holiday inn in the states.  Nothing luxurious.. but liveable. <br>  <br>  Don't worry about it.  You don't spend much time in your rooms.<br>  <br>  The better rooms are in the Royal Towers, Cove and The Reef Condo.
1Vih78dZaa	I'm 1.93 metres (6 feet 4 inches) tall and I live in the Abruzzo region of central Italy. (I was born in the States to parents of mixed northern European descent.)<br>  <br>  It's not at all common for me to encounter people my height here, but nor am I so freakishly tall that people on the street will stop and stare at me.<br>  <br>  Most of the older generation here (say, those over 60) are very small due to poor nutrition when they were children. Even people born in the 1960s and later when Italy was becoming more prosperous are not all that tall, which suggests to me that genetics plays a large part in how big Italians tend to be. However, I do occasionally see men who are perhaps 40 and younger who are as tall as me and rarely even a bit taller.<br>  <br>  It's not at all unusual for me to encounter women who are nearly as tall as me, but that's only due to the popularity of ridiculously high heels here! In fact, it's VERY rare to see women who are taller than 1.83 metres (6 feet).|`|hT8vbWiDaa	I'd say it is unusual in many countries. many people think that Italians are short but that is not very true. Even in the south - there are many tall basketball playing men AND women.|`|49CyGhefaa	Just like here in America, people are all different sizes. In northern Italy men tende to be on the taller side. In the southern regions of Italy, men are often shorter.<br>  <br>  Hope I was able to help. :)<br>  Clara|`|oB9i7IQIaa	Yes it is, the average is 175 to 185 cm

If you do go,check out Bahia Honda State Park (great beach & snorkeling). The Keys are chill, Key West has more to do when you're not on the beach.<br>  <br>  2-Fave beaches on the West(Gulf) coast:<br>  >Clearwater Beach & St.Pete Beach(good deals & gorgeous beaches & lots of great things to do).<br>  >Siesta Key(near Sarasota),cool snorkeling there at Crescent Beach/Point-of-Rocks. <br>   <br>  3-Also great, and you may find reasonable rooms: Daytona Beach, Ft. Lauderdale Beach, or Panama City.<br>  <br>  There are so many amazing beaches to visit in Florida! Do your homework, pack your sunscreen, and have a blast when you get here!<br>  <br>  ***Tips to save money; Ask the hotel when their off-season rates begin, this is a great money saver.<br>  Also, try booking on one of those name your price travel sites,we use those a lot and get unbelievable deals.

iCqfmRC3aa	Baby formula is covered on the TSA website shown below:<br>  <br>  "The following items are permitted to be carried aboard the aircraft:<br>  <br>  Passengers traveling with infants may bring baby formula.<br>  Prescription medicine that matches the passenger’s name.<br>  Essential non-prescription medicines such as insulin are permitted."<br>  <br>  The 3 oz rule is only for carry-on items.<br>  Put all your soaps, perfumes and the like in your checked baggage, but be careful, some times the holds (cargo areas) on airplanes are not pressurized and things can leak, so I'd put everything in Zip lock bags, so you don't get spillage inside your suitcase. <br>  <br>  Regrettably, the airlines do now charge for baggage, our bad economy  ...  This is from one of the websites shown below:<br>  <br>  Delta Airlines<br>  Delta now charges $15 USD for the first checked bag and $25 for a second. If traveling outside the U.S. you can check two bags free of charge. Checked bags must weigh less than 50 lbs. An extra bag that goes over the limits will involve a charge ranging from $90-$300 per bag.<br>  <br>  Most of the airlines are compatible with this, but be sure to check the one you are using because some are higher than a cats back.<br>  <br>  Baggage does get lost, make sure you have your name, address and maybe your bf phone number on it (I don't like women using their numbers for safety reasons) so it can find its way back if it is lost.  <br>  <br>  You will check your baggage at the ticket counter of the airline that shows on your ticket.  Just go up to the counter and give them the ticket and your photo ID.<br>  <br>  You'll be fine.  Tell the Flight attendant that you are flying for the first time and you are nervous. They will usually take good care of you.<br>  <br>  You'll do great, just keep thinking of your boyfriend waiting for you.|`|44ab537503b323dcb61fd2a3b8221f88aa	you will be able to check all of your purfumes, shampoos, baby lotions, ect., I don't think you'll need them in the plane. Most airlines don't charge to check luggage. You will get the tags to go on your stuff when you check in at the airport, same place as everyone else, regardless of the fact you bought the tickets online. I don't know about the baby formula, call the airline. There are thousands of flights daily without crashes, its a really rare occurance concidering the number of flights. Relax and don't freak yourself out. Remember to bring gum.|`|1bTYCUDkaa	You will be able to bring all of the shampoos and make-up, as long as they are in checked-baggage.  With the baby formula, you will be able to bring it as a carry-on.  TSA does permit this.  Luggage is generally $15 for each bag checked.  Carry-on bags are not priced.  To get your luggage tags, check in at the airport.  The agent will provide them to you.

oB9i7IQIaa	An inscription to be found on the wall to the right of the entrance door records the date in which building work on the Tower commenced. It reads: A.D. MCLXXIV. CAMPANILE HOC FUIT FUNDATUM MENSE AUGUSTI (in the month of August, A.D. 1174, this bell tower was founded). This evidence is confirmed in certain documents and in the contemporary chronicles of Bernardo Maragone, an eye-witness of the facts. Nowhere, however, is the name of the architect recorded. This has led to a long debate, still in progress today, regarding the identity of the architect of the building, who, being a personality of great education and importance, has been recognised in various individuals known to have worked in Piazza dei Miracoli in the twelfth century. An antique tradition founded by the Aretine historian Giorgio Vasari has tended to identify the architect of the Tower with Bonanno Pisano.|`|3fHZOobiaa	Wikipedia could be helpful:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaning_Tower_of_Pisa" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaning_Tow...</a><br>  <br>  P.S: the right spelling is "Pisa"<br>  <br>  Bye

You can also call American Airlines, and ask for a seat today.|`|ju4Zb4vOaa	i fly at least 8 times a year and most of the 8 flights iam in first class and when i reserved my seat i was in Business class.|`|AA11043094	Most of the time the seats are already reserved, however it is possible sometimes to get a better seat, I have done that by going very early
1UHDLGLlaa	I would recommend you look at this website:<br>  <a href="http://www.i-to-i.com/volunteer-trips/" rel="nofollow">http://www.i-to-i.com/volunteer-trips/</a><br>  A lot of the trips are quite affordable and you could practise your language skills, put something back in to a community, have a great time and get some experience.<br>  <br>  If not, maybe think where you want to be after university & get some experience.<br>  <br>  Or just earn lots of money so you will be sorted for uni =)<br>  <br>  Hope all goes well ;) Jasmineeeee x
7sIYGEnmaa	1. JULLIARD School of Music is a conservatory that gives performances for FREE on most days of the week. You can check their schedule on their website. I suggest going to an event that is hosted at PAUL HALL - it's a real concert hall and the whole experience is wonderful. <br>  2. Definitely go to the Metropolitan Museum - it's one of the best museums in the world. Collections range from ancient Egyptian to medieval. Price: no matter what the posters say, the price is voluntary. They "suggest" paying some $10, but you can give as little as one penny and no one will give you a dirty look because it's the law. <br>  3. Same goes with Museum of Natural History if you like staring at dinosaurs skeletons. <br>  4. Empire State Building has a free observation deck, I think. Find out where.|`|2uINYiMfaa	Metropolitan museum of art or any other public museum|`|X7Lzo0VUaa	Depends how much money do you plan on bringing? I think Museums are a good idea! Hint, Hint.|`|87CAVhs2aa	A walk through Central Park is as cheap as it gets. Just be sure not to miss out on Strawberry Fields. It's best in warm weather when all the flowers are arranged and sometimes there's people singing, it's a nice place to go because everyone there is happy and friendly.

The only way I can answer this question is if I assume. <br>  <br>  By Car:<br>  <br>  Since you said how long does it take to get to Florida and you posted this in the Miami section I will assume your coming from the nearest state Georgia and the city of Atlanta. It takes about 10 hours (663 miles) to get from Atlanta, Georgia to Miami, Florida but you can easily make it in less time if you really run the road. From Atlanta, Georgia to the border line of Florida is about 3 hours & 50 minutes (243 miles). From the border line of Georgia to Miami, Florida is about 6 hours & 15 minutes (420 miles).<br>  <br>  By Plane:<br>  <br>  By airplane it takes 2 hours to fly from Miami International Airport to Atlanta Hartsfield International Airport.<br>  <br>  By Bus:<br>  <br>  By Greyhound Bus it would take 16-17 hours to get from the station in Miami to the station in Atlanta.<br>  <br>  Everything above was assumed so don't kill me if that's not the answer your looking for.|`|VELnLnIKaa	from where duh lol|`|X6rFPI2laa	It depends on where you begin your trip and how you travel.

dpKntiZoaa	Well it is difficult as you don't mention if this is for a vacation, or for a school exchange or what exactly.<br>  <br>  I will answer assuming the latter.<br>  <br>  When staying with a family you normally have breakfast and the main meal laid on.  Of course you have a room and things like bed linen, towels etc are included so you don't have to bring anything.<br>  <br>  So think about the things you use that would miss e.g. hair straightner, cosmetics, slippers etc.<br>  <br>  For clothes, - it depends where in Europe you are going and when, as to what type of clothes you need to bring.  So that is impossible to answer given the lack of info.<br>  <br>  If you are going to a country where you don't speak the language fluently, then a phrasebook would be good as a backup.  <br>  <br>  Also bring something to keep you entertrained, e.g. your music or a book (because what you have at home might not be as easy to get in the host family), and there may be times when you want some space.<br>  <br>  Bring some photo's of your family and where you live.  You will spend time talking with them, and it is nice for them to see what you are talking about.<br>  <br>  Don't forget to bring a present for your host family (or family members if you want to do it for each).  A present which is regional to your area makes it more personal and a nice opening to conversation :0)  <br>  <br>  Last of all, and most importantly - don't forget to bring your sense of humour - essential for a trip like this :0)<br>  <br>  Have fun|`|f610fce787e6299e681ff222a3173ed5aa	I don't get it.

nF9DZ0sOaa	Well, it depends on your point of view...<br>  <br>  San Antonio is very large.  According to the 2007 population estimate, San Antonio is the 7th largest city in the US.  The population is mostly Hispanic, followed by anglo, then by all other races.  The culture is diverse.  The downtown area isn't large, but it is very crowded, usually due to the influx of tourists in the Riverwalk area.<br>  <br>  Shopping is about what you would expect in large cities.  San Antonio has a very good zoo, a terrific botanic garden, Sea World and Six Flags Fiesta Texas.  It isn't too far from the coast or from the Hill Country.  It has a collection of decent museums, and a really nice venue in the Majestic Theater for Broadway shows, symphony performances and the occasional ballet or other dance company.  It is known for it's old Spanish Missions, especially, of course, the Alamo.<br>  <br>  The crime rate is about what you would expect in a city of its size.  The scariest areas seem to be those surrounding the downtown area.  The further you get away from downtown, the lower the crime rate seems to be, with the north central area apparently having the lowest rate.  The education system certainly could be better, and San Antonio has the dubious honor of being one of the fattest cities in America, probably thanks(?) to all the really good Mexican food restaurants.  It also has a staggeringly high rate of teenage pregnancies.<br>  <br>  Texas overall seems to be suffering less from the current economic crises than the rest of the country, but who knows how long that will last?<br>  <br>  Do some internet research on San Antonio demographics, economics, etc. before making the decision to move there.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|pdLzqDl8aa	oh well i live 30 min from there!<br>  and its really really fun! there is the best mall called la cantera its amazing, and there is "the alamo" its really cool with history and stuff! its alot of fun there nice people! and its very nice! well the north part is! and then there is the palledium which is a awesome theater(:<br>  its really cool!

nF9DZ0sOaa	Being the 7th largest city in the US, San Antonio, like any other large cities, has its share of crime.  The areas with the lowest crime rates tend to be those on the north central side of town.  Anything close to downtown tends to have a significantly higher crime rate, with the exceptions of the Alamo Heights and Terrell Hills area.<br>  <br>  Try Googling "San Antonio crime rate" and see if can narrow it down even more.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|RWbjGT7Oaa	Northside, blondie...that's where you belong. safe, upscale, chi-chi<br>  in some places...AVOID the southside|`|ZYzLTZm6aa	no you got people like bruce bowen living there, look him up on youtube, he is a very dirty person|`|gnhl6hXYaa	hi[:<br>  well i live there and some people make it sound horrible.<br>  but yes it is pretty safe [:<br>  if you want a safe area move to the north side and some parts of the south side are good too! most of the bad stuff happens deep downtown and in the west side so yeahh.. not good areas.<br>  hope this helped a bit <br>  -andreaa<3|`|A6PS0jRfaa	really depends on what you are looking for.I personally live on the far NE side of town going near live oak/selma area.It's a good area,quiet and while there is some crime it's not terrible.San Antonio is almost broken off into small little cities of their own.There are some areas to avoid like the east side mlk blvd but really there are lots of good neighborhoods your best bet would be to contact an apt. finders and tell them your information and price range and what type of neighborhood you are looking for and they can pair you up.I like my side of town because I don't have to deal with a ton of crime and I am close to the grocery stores etc and feel safe in the area.

ZPxJNpMxaa	Whether or not it was pure racism or racism with an element of cultural preservation, in my view, is irrelevant, in fact one can debate and argue that racism is a component of culture and as such blame apartheid on only cultural preservation.<br>  <br>  The fact is that Apartheid was wrong as it deprived all non whites of a universally accepted basic human right, the right to be treated equally, the right to vote for a government of their choice.<br>  <br>  Furthermore Apartheid did not begin in 1948 when the Nationalists came into power, what they did was just to legislate the system of Apartheid that commenced as far back as the early settlers.<br>  <br>  Racism is a world phenomenon and has happened and still happens in various forms all over the world, by legislating Apartheid , the then Nationalist party drew the spotlight onto SA.<br>  <br>  You appear to know who you are, that is important, not what some may think of you purely because you are an Afrikaner, you get the good, the bad and the ugly in all groups and societies. The wise and mature know and understand this the ignorant do not.|`|mRulboA7aa	You must know that during that time the actual news of what was happening in places like Soweto were hidden from the general society.  The whole truth only came out during the TRC hearings afterward, and are still coming out today.  This is why it all seemed so peaceful to you.  Each morning, police departments literally threw away the reports of the previous night's killings and crime.  Luckily the news got out to the outside world through ANC members and conflict photographers.|`|53adca422c280d605197c5d02cab2b26aa	The are many ways to protect one's culture and the best way is to share your culture with other people let them know who you are and what you do.<br>  But you don't vilify, degrade and trash other cultures.<br>  People got murdered during apartheid.<br>  Here is a good example Ex-president Mbeki lost his brother, cousin and his only son.<br>  <br>  The truth is Apartheid was racism and it tried to impose its-self over other cultures it wanted to be the superior culture in South Africa.<br>  <br>  You obviously are looking at this whole thing from a biased view as a Boer you benefited from Apartheid.|`|AA11326712	Well said Tony and Heavy.<br>  <br>  There is racism all over the world.  South Africa′s problem was, partly because the laws were written down.  Other countries practise the same discrimination, yet get away with it, because it is not the law.  Even the present government in South Africa does a good imitation of apartheid in many aspects.<br>  <br>  But, one of the reasons why you perceived SA as an unviolent place when you were a child is because there was a competent police force with sufficient staff.|`|lDJWOEQSaa	Ayiza !

U have to agree that White South Africans are *Special* people indeed. <br>  <br>  Allow me to unveil the basic definition of apartheid to u: Apartheid is an oppresion of one race by another...<br>  ALL white South Africans happily participated in that system. Because for the Black man on the street, the effects of the sytem could not be felt all the way from the Union buildings IF that was not the case. The system was succesful because of ALL white people.<br>  There. Now u can down-rate me too, cos u *special* people only like hearing whats in your heads.|`|K8CGXTLQaa	Yes, I do think Apartheid had to do something with cultural preservation just like Black Economic Empowerment has to do with cultural preservation. Too bad though that most cultures are identified by a particular race. So essentially it becomes racial-cultural preservation. The whole thing is wack. Government should take a neutral standpoint when it comes to culture, race and religion. It should seek to fully empower all facets of society, otherwise we have an imbalance. But South Africa is still a racist nation. And South Africans are still disgruntled and pissed off at each other just like other Countries. But at least other countries have the balls and decency to change their policies to be uniracial. <br>  <br>  While I do think Apartheid was wrong, I think it is even worse to discriminate against Afrikaners. Apartheid was not supported by all Afrikaners and not only Afrikaners. Brits, Germans and yes even Jews were involved in the hate crimes. And even Blacks were involved. The attrocities go all round.<br>  <br>  Overall if we want to change South Africa we must change our Governments by showing them that we are fed up with their c r a p.

cK28Kl0Uaa	Check out all the normal things to do in LA/OrangeCounty.  Garden Grove is very close to Anaheim (disneyland), huntington beach, and long beach.|`|ac7e0f50f58632b431b5cf5de0564ffbaa	There are literally hundreds of things to do here in LA. Here is my list of “must sees”. Visit as many as you have time for.:<br>  <br>  Disneyland: The Happiest Place on Earth. Half a billion visitors can’t be wrong. #1 Destination. <br>  Universal Studios: A theme park that grew out of a studio tour. #2 Destination.<br>  Even if you don’t visit Disneyland or Universal Studios Tour, Downtown Disney District and Universal City Walk are very fun places to visit for shopping and eating. And they’re free to visit. <br>  <br>  Hollywood: Enjoy the Walk of Fame, Entertainment Museum, Chinese Theatre and more. You can see a lot for free. The Hollywood & Highland complex is AMAZING. It has lots of shops and restaurants, and the Kodak Theater (home of the Academy Awards). I also like the El Capitan theater, right across the street, where Disney shows their movies. And the Hollywood Bowl is a GREAT place to listen to concerts outdoors. <br>  <br>  Rodeo Drive, 90210: Packed with exclusive shops, full of gawkers. They all came to enjoy the excess. Free, unless you intend to buy something.<br>  <br>  Venice Beach: Los Angeles kitsch and over-the-top culture at its best. Here you'll find Muscle Beach, street performers and tacky shops galore. Fun, VERY interesting, but I avoid it after dark, when it gets a little TOO interesting for my taste. <br>  <br>  Santa Monica Beach and Pier: Great beach scene and a classic seaside amusement park, complete with antique carousel that has been in a lot of TV and movies. (The Sting and "Three's Company" come immediately to mind). After visiting the pier, you can ride a bike south a couple miles to Venice Beach.<br>  <br>  Santa Monica Third Street Promenade - Downtown Santa Monica's shopping promenade is often the scene of movie star-sightings. Just north of Santa Monica Pier.<br>  <br>  Sunset Boulevard: Perhaps one of the world's most famous streets, it began as a route between the stars' posh neighborhoods and the Hollywood studios. It runs from downtown to the ocean, passing through the "Sunset Strip" on its way. It makes for a fun drive. When you get to the ocean, stop at Gladstone's for Fish.<br>  <br>  Farmers Market and The Grove - A new shopping complex right next to a Los Angeles landmark, The Grove and Farmers Market coexist. Enjoy a movie or shopping, and then take the trolley to the Farmers Market for lunch or dinner. It is right next to CBS, so walk across the lot to see if they are taping "The Price is Right". You might even get in.<br>  <br>  TAAB: The Americana at Brand- The newly opened TAAB, developed by the same group that gave us The Grove, breathes new life into Glendale, and gives all those hip people in Eagle Rock and the eastern half of LA a great place to go. <br>  <br>  Griffith Park - Home of the Los Angeles Zoo, Griffith Park Observatory, Travel Town, the Greek Theatre, and Gene Autry Museum of Western Heritage.<br>  <br>  Getty Museum - The Getty's architecture is so beautiful that it keeps me fascinated. No matter whether you like their art or architecture better (or maybe you'll just enjoy the view), the Getty is sure to please. Free.<br>  <br>  Attend a TV taping - You can get free tickets at audiencesunlimited.com, tvtix.com, or see the booth at Universal City walk. It's very interesting to see a show being taped. The most popular, by far, is the Tonight show with Jay Leno. Check the NBC web site for all the details there.<br>  <br>  Places to eat:<br>  In-N-Out Burger: Multiple locations, best burger in LA, ask anyone.<br>  Pink’s Hot Dogs: 709 N. La Brea, just north of Melrose. You might even see a celebrity. Maybe.<br>  Tommy’s Chili Burgers: Look for the shack, an LA tradition. The original location is at Beverly & Rampart, a couple miles west of downtown.<br>  Canter’s Deli: 419 N. Fairfax, between Beverly & Melrose. Near CBS, you might spot a celebrity.<br>  Phillippe’s: 1001 N. Alameda. Great roast beef sandwiches. Near Union Station and Olvera Street. Watch the mustard, it’s hot.<br>  The Pantry: Corner of Figueroa and 9th, downtown. Huge portions, they never close, GREAT steak and eggs.<br>  <br>  Places to Stay:<br>  Since LA is so spread out, there is no single place that is close to EVERYTHING. Most people who come here tend to stay in Hollywood, Santa Monica, or Anaheim.<br>  In Hollywood, I recommend the Renaissance Hotel at Hollywood and Highland, the Best Western Sunset Plaza, or the Holiday Inn Walk of Fame. <br>  In Santa Monica, the Holiday Inn Santa Monica is close to the pier and reasonably priced.<br>  In Anaheim, I recommend the Howard Johnson (HoJo) Anaheim, and the Candy Cane Inn. <br>  <br>  Places to Shop:<br>  Third Street Promenade, Santa Monica<br>  The Grove, Los Angeles<br>  Americana @ Brand, Glendale<br>  Beverly Center, Los Angeles<br>  Citadel Outlets, Commerce<br>  Brea Mall, Brea<br>  The Block at Orange, Orange<br>  South Coast Plaza, Costa Mesa<br>  Fashion Island, Newport Beach<br>  Santee Alley, Los Angeles

(I dont understand how people can afford to do all their groceries at these stores...insane!)<br>  <br>  Food Basics/Price Chopper are probs the cheapest grocery stores but aren't likely to carry Ben&Jerry's...I usually get mine at No Frills of Galati...may also want to try Fortinos (still a few of those around). It's not cheap but HELLA cheaper than METRO! lol|`|IuV1eZ9Iaa	You're kidding right?

It's not that far from the Italian border and there are plenty of places to go to. Have a look at what colleges and universities there are in the area and look at any accommodation they may have to offer.

eAMbWkahaa	The reason you dont hear much about it in Japan is because unlike many other countries, Japan actually enforces Immigration laws.  It is illegal to be a temporary visitor/tourist and work around for money.<br>  If you want to do that you need a visa.<br>  <br>  Some people on this board just drive me insane with their incorrect answers please provide useful information please folks.<br>  <br>  You just need a proper visa to work. <br>  For example, if you are from the following countries:<br>      * Australia<br>      * Canada<br>      * Denmark<br>      * Germany<br>      * France<br>      * Ireland<br>      * Korea<br>      * New Zealand<br>      * United Kingdom <br>  And between the ages of 18-25 you can get a working holiday visa, that is valid for 6 months to one year (depending on what country you are from).  <br>  <br>  If you are not on that list or if you are too old, then you then usually need a full work visa, which usually entails having a job sponsor in Japan, and meeting immigration requirements for a work visa, which usually includes having a university bachelors degree.<br>  <br>  As for how easy is it for a white guy, well In this economy its hard for anyone to get a job, my friend is white, and he's been unemployed for a while now.  It's not about skin color, its about what you can do.  Don't speak fluent Japanese? well good luck because the green guy who can speak fluent japanese or the other white guy who can speak fluent japanese is going to get that job.|`|d1407e163bbaccc43424ce022aa254acaa	If you come on tourist visa, you are not allowed to work<br>  <a href="http://www.mofa.go.jp/j_info/visit/visa/03.html#a" rel="nofollow">http://www.mofa.go.jp/j_info/visit/visa/...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.tfemploy.go.jp/en/spec/spec_1a.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.tfemploy.go.jp/en/spec/spec_1...</a><br>  If you work anyway, you will be discovered and deported,and will not be permitted to visit Japan for a period of 5 years<br>  <a href="http://www2.aichi-rodo.go.jp/gaikokujin/en/pdf/Foreignworkersmustbeemployedappropriately-en.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www2.aichi-rodo.go.jp/gaikokujin/...</a><br>  It is not easy for Japanese to find work in their own country now.<br>  <a href="http://www.japantoday.com/category/business/view/2362-apply-for-five-jobs-at-municipal-government" rel="nofollow">http://www.japantoday.com/category/busin...</a>|`|Oi28Agu3aa	Yea, If you speak chinese.<br>  =D|`|XBzOV80Uaa	While its true you need a visa to work in japan, you still could have your own little english teaching thing set up.

You also need a work visa. To get the work visa you need a solid job offer.The employer sponsors the employee. It's currently not easy for a Japanese to get work in Japan.They are going through a very deep recession at this time. You might be able to find low paying work such as you mention, but when the police check your paper work, you would be arrested,deported,and not allowed back into the country for at least five years.They now finger print and take a photo of everyone who enters the country.Maybe Thailand ?|`|AA10662056	You can't work in Japan without proper working visa. <br>  <br>  If you come to Japan as a backpacker, you can't hand out flyer or run rickshaw.

CD1T7gaXaa	I suppose if you feel in your heart of hearts that you are British then you are. Personally I wouldn't place too much emphasis on labels and categories because ultimately that has a tendency to degrade someone's dignity. Be proud of your personal strong points and be someone you like. Whether someone thinks you're British or not is secondary.|`|FKxrJxbPaa	No.<br>  <br>  Despite holding British citizenship I wouldnt call you ethnically English/Welsh/Scot/Irish etc....ethnically you're Cameroonian. So because of that you've just changed from a Cameroonian British to a Cameroonian American. You're not culturally or ancestrally British in any way so I wouldnt call you British.<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  half my family lives in England and my father was born a british subject but I wouldnt call him English either since all of his ancestry is in the Caribbean. Despite the obvious connection to England, possibly even greater than yours he's still not British.<br>  <br>  I could MAYBE understand if you had actually grown up in Britain but you left when you were 6, you barely started primary school at that time. <br>  <br>  Also...you already talk like an American lol....Brits dont say "like 9 years" lmao.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  <br>  The island my family is from was, and still is a British colony and my family, unlike yours, has lived under direct British domination as her majesty's "subjects" for almost 300 years. Technically I could call myself british if I wanted to and am fully eligible for British citizenship if I want it but I dont feel an attatchment to England per se...not on a cultural level anyway. <br>  <br>  And yes I do consider myself to be African in a sense that that's my heritage in the purest sense, but for all intensive purposes I'm caribbean and ima leave it at that. I acknowledge myself as a member of the African Diaspora.<br>  <br>  The difference between me acknowledging that I am both an African and Caribbean, and you claiming British as an identity is that my story and family history stretches throughout the histories of Africa and the Caribbean. My family has lived in the West Indies under British rule for centuries and before that they were Africans. Being Caribbean and being African is a BIG part of my identity. <br>  <br>  Lets pretend for example you're family history is a book. In my case, the Caribbean would fill dozens and dozens of chapters, and Africa itself would go on indefinitely. <br>  <br>  In your case England would be a footnote. You left before you were 10 and you already sound and act like a fully assimilated part of American society. Yes, Britain is part of your identity and your history but I wouldnt jump to call you British just because you're a citizen who hasnt lived there for most of her life.<br>  <br>  <br>  But then again....if you feel British in your heart that's good enough for me. At the end of the day its your call, not mines. I already tossed off the chains of colonialism and dont feel a need to identify with Britain but if you're cool with it thats all that matters. Personally I like Black Brits but then again most of them are immigrants from the Caribbean anyways.|`|8auEgQf2aa	Your only British if what you call home is within Britain and you relate to the general British culture<br>  I consider myself British because me and my parents n grandparents were born here and my culture is British and Ive met people from my ancestral lands and I dont relate to them yet I acknowledge they are from my ancestral home so in a sense I am still African genetically but culturally I am British so identify as Black British|`|4f13e0de90f26d6c931fca1e03c59429aa	Interesting that you raise this question.<br>  <br>  I've met so many foreign born people who now possess a British passport and they say with a posh voice "I am British and I am proud" and they try to deny their heritage in their native country.<br>  <br>  A passport is a legal document but it is up to the individual I guess whether they want to renounce their past and heritage or not, or be embrace it.

You'll receive both of your boarding passes at the counter or kiosk and then go to your gate. When you arrive in Taipei, you'll only need to transit and clear security from the arrivals area to the departure area and find your gate. Besides clearing security there is no other check-in or formalities as you will already have your boarding pass, just go to your gate. Good luck.|`|eulMjLtPaa	If your airlines allow you to check in online you can print your boarding passes at the same time.

If not, you will.|`|AzKUBp2Jaa	sometimes you can printed your boarding pass online sometimes<br>  even 24 hours ahead of the flight then you can bring , id and passport<br>  to the security /passport control (it depends on the airport<br>  if you were leaving from a US airport you would go straight to the security check /screening area (where they would check your ID and "ticket or boarding pass" then go to the gate yiu still have to tell the airline you<br>  are there! (so they dont cancel your reservation)
SAAO0xXgaa	After Liu Bāng came into power, he re-centralised China based on Qín's model. He gradually replaced the original vassals, granting their lands to his relatives. Since the economy had been devastated by the war following the demise of the Qín Dynasty, he reduced taxes and corvée, developed agriculture and restricted spending. However, in response to what he saw as the decadence of Qín merchants, he restricted commerce by levying heavy taxes and legal restrictions on merchants. He also made peace with the Xiongnu. Under Gāozǔ's reign, Confucian thought gradually replaced Legalist thought; Confucian scholars were welcomed into his government, while the harsh Legalist laws were lessened. Emperor Gāozǔ's efforts laid a solid foundation for the over four-hundred-year reign of the Hàn Dynasty.Liú Bāng also devoted to subduing the unruly kings. He soon annexed most of the kingdoms and established principalities, with his sons and relatives as princes. By doing so he consolidated his new-born empire.

It is on the beach, has kitchenettes in some rooms, a huge pool, wireless internet, an onsite restaurant, Traders, which has great food, a manager's happy hour each evening, lovely grounds, is clean, the only thing is, the breakfast is not complimentary.  They often offer discounts that make them competitive with lesser hotels.<br>  <br>  For info. on hotels in Daytona, visit tripadvisor.com, type in Daytona Beach, and there will be tons of reviews on hotels, attractions and restaurants with little maps that show all the hotels and restaurants and how close they are to you.|`|XzLUA7ataa	We can offer a two bedroom apartment which we own in Daytona.  It is beach side and near the Desert Inn.  It rents for $100 a night, but the hotels are the only place where you'll find swimming pools and the internet service you desire.  I'd suggest the Holiday Inn or Hilton Inn.

Even if you moving to what I would consider a very safe area like Federal Hill, and go one or two many blocks in a certain direction, you may be in a not so nice area.  Best thing to do is check it out...

XLQ9wCUaaa	I love everything about the British. I think the UK is f**king awesome and I'm plotting to live there sometime. The history, the culture, the attitudes of the people, the music, it's just great. Plus where I went to London I couldn't believe all the different cultures that were mixed there - it was so different from NYC, which I always though was supposed to be the most culturally diverse place in the world.<br>  The only thing that got to me a bit was how cramped everything was, but I think it wasn't cramped; Europeans just know how to maximize space because there's less of it. Which is a good thing.<br>  Europeans and people in the UK also seem to be more environmentally conscious, and they also seem to be conscious of things like protecting the aesthetic beauty of a city/town with urban planning laws and the prevention of urban sprawl (which is an ugly problem in north america that nobody seems to care about). I also think Europeans protect unions and labor more than we do here in North America. <br>  Europeans/people from the UK also aren't so puritanical. Nobody is all hung up on morality or nudity there (which is foolishness anyways) and I find that refreshing. So yah, when can I move in? :)|`|rZWEFz4Qaa	their accents are the sh*tttttttttttt.<br>  i went to britain a few years ago when i was like twelve or something && most of the people were pretty nice.<br>  but the ones i met on the internet (like on youtube, check it out, they make these anti-american videos calling us stupid and generalizing us)<br>  those ones are rude.<br>  they think we're britains baby...<br>  but for the most part they're nice & they have the beatlesssss:)<br>  the scenery is beautiful there too.<br>  i went to london, and some other town in northern england and there were almost no bugs!<br>  you guys are freagin luckyyyy as hell!|`|JDvf6oIUaa	I went there once....my favorite things were that there are NO bugs there except bees and of course the british accents haha.

jLTDqVHsaa	I have been there.  Quite honestly, I wasn't a big fan.  I personally prefer the kind of art in the Metropolitan Museum, but again, that's personal preference.  You might love it.  I was around 21 when I visited, give or take a year.    What would be awesome is taking that place on rollerblades...|`|CvYq5wBhaa	I think I was 23 or 24 the first time I went to the Guggenheim. Even if you're not a fan of the artwork, the building itself is spectacular.|`|7Y2jmO7Taa	I have been there several times. The building will wow you with it's fantastic architecture, but the art....    The truth is, this museum has a very small permanent collection, and it's mission is to have numerous special exhibitions that take over the museum proper.     Some of these special exhibitions are fantastic! I saw a wonderful one on Chinese art a few years ago. But some are simply trying to bilk people out of the admission fee! Take the one on harley davidson motorcycles! Talk about commercial claptrap!!!!    It's a mixed bag with the Guggenheim, truthfully.

I'm beginning to feel a bit UNLUCKY, though, since all the tourists who come here to get the feel of "Twilight" are clogging up my favoritie restaurant (Bella Italia) with their demand for its mushroom ravioli--which, I take it, is what Edward and Bella ordered.  I can't even get in at all unless I'm willing to wait two hours! What a bummer that has become!

2XI0jDb1aa	There are lots of good restaurants. Island Prime is on the bay and has great food. Ruth Chris is on the water as well. If you're into seafood and a little more casual, Anthony's might be your ticket. <br>  <br>  Lots of bars and clubs in the Gaslamp.  Altitude in the Marriott is cool. You might also want to check out what's happening at 4th and B. Croce's is nice especially if you want some music. If you want swanky, try the Marine Room  in La Jolla.<br>  <br>  Depending on the time of year and weather, beaches might not be the best choice, but San Diego can have beach days any time of the year. Pacific Beach is probably the most fun, but Coronado is probably the nicest beach. Mission Beach has a small amusement park (Belmont Park) with a roller coaster called the Giant Dipper. That's a fun way to spend a few hours. Both Mission Beach and PB have lots of bars to occupy some of your time as well.<br>  <br>  If you're hear in the spring, you might want to try whale watching... The Birch Aquarium in La Jolla is a neat trip. For something different, you can take a tour of the Olympic Training Center in Chula Vista. If you golf, there are lots of great golf courses. Try a trip up to the Cabrillo monument. It's a view of the city that's hard to beat.<br>  <br>  If you'd like to hike and be by the ocean, Torrey Pines State Park is something you won't want to miss. Although the zoo is one of the best in the world, the zoo's Wild Animal Park in Escondido is the better choice. <br>  <br>  Whatever you decide to do, enjoy your trip!|`|o1wrdVwoaa	go to la jolla Cove It is gorgeous.|`|m2eHPeciaa	go to Gaslamp in SD... (Fifth Street) <br>  as far as beaches, anywhere North of Imprial Beach :)|`|cv2S4tsnaa	The boardwalk is nice, the zoo is the 2nd largest in the world, and the SeaWorld is great too!

OXxKTM6vaa	Magaluf also known as shagaluf speaks for itself.<br>  <br>  During may - september (peak season) every year thousands of teenagers head there for sun, sea and sambuca! The main thing to do there is party party party. If you're going during peak season, and you're young and looking for a wild holiday......I'd recommend Maguluf.........if you're not stay well away.<br>  <br>  Its a very good place BUT with the euro being so weak against the pound at the moment the prices out there will be roughly the same as here in england (im assuming you're from england) so please don't assume it'll be cheap - like alot of people do.<br>  <br>  What there is to do in Magaluf:<br>  <br>  - watersports<br>  - eat out (restaurants)<br>  - nightlife (hundreds of bars, pubs and clubs to choose from)<br>  - Beach/pool<br>  - excursions<br>  <br>  For me 1 week is definitely enough in Magaluf as I personally find Malia is much much better.|`|cSBZQfaIaa	yes i have.. is wonderful is party everywhere at least in august when i was there.. it`s not a quite place so don′t expect silence.. sometimes at night if you want to sleep it gets noisy too but it`s great, the beach in front of the hotel was beatiful with that hot mediterranean sea water..|`|fox5a3ePaa	Magaluf is fantastic.

SLFt8eHEaa	Lol, seeing as the UK is a developed, first world country very similar to the US this question is a little on the patronising side, but here goes...<br>  <br>  1. Yes it would be a good place to build a factory.  In fact there are already many, many factories in this country so it's obviously good enough for plenty of companies.<br>  <br>  2. As I said this is a modern first world country with a democratically elected government like in the US.  So yes, we have a very stable government.<br>  <br>  3. We have a free market economy (just like the US...).<br>  <br>  4. We're one of the G8 nations (aka the richest 8 nations in the world) so as you can imagine we're therefore on a par with the US.<br>  <br>  5. We have a population 60 million and an ever increasing immigrant population so yes, we have plenty of available workers (especially in the current recession).<br>  <br>  6. Again, being a first-world nation we have an extensive road and rail transport system (just like the US...) and as we're an island we have a large number of ports.|`|lgsz1Ttkaa	Yes the government is democratic and well organised and stable.<br>  In different parts the economic system is varied as in more derelict places such as wales lots of farming goes on and in other places it is very industrial.<br>  About the same because both countries have very low earning people and high earning people<br>  Yes especially at this time of the economical crisis because there is a raise in unemployment. <br>  lots of coastal areas and close to mainland europe also large airports. <br>  <br>  <br>  Downside is very expensive compared to america and larger tax.
IUyXLfdKaa	Because of the amount of effort that was put in for making it.<br>  It's the longest wall ever constructed over a long period of time and some of the portions are still surviving.|`|a6JZjRG1aa	it's a huge construction with many unique engineering solutions... <br>  the duration and the resources spent are huge as well...<br>  plus it's ancient and still works (even though the use is for attracting rather then keeping away nowadays)...|`|0eT9mNhdaa	Why are the pyramids so great?<br>  <br>  Why is the coloseum so great?|`|N2Xto1pFaa	I don't quite know about calling it art, but it's beautiful construction, especially considering the time period in which it was made (started in the 5th century BC, continued to be edited and rebuilt through the 1500s).

The indoor area was pumped so full of chlorine my eyes were red and burned constantly and there were too many young kids, the place was too full.  The floors were slimy and gross. The wave pool was too full to move around in.  The outdoor hot tubs were nice though.  We stayed in a 2 floor suite which was just ok - the walls were paper thin.  Hope this helps.
d01EV6npaa	definitly a good move! Portland is very cool  while maintaining a small town vibe. I love all of the beautiful wildlife there is to see here. ( i live there)  advice: be prepared for rain. it may not rain as much a seattle but it still is up there. still, its a great place to live and has great neighborhoods like vista, lake oswego, forest heights, and much more. It's an especially great place to settle down and start a family becuase the schools are great. portland has a cute green vibe and is earthy but still has a great city life. i hope you enjoy it as much as i do if you decide to move here!<br>  :D|`|30ad4662919fe0039d27aaea1639ebe5aa	I have a cousin who lives there.Would not that be kind of laid back compared to NY. And did they not get a lot of snow and rain. i have herd it is nice. If you don't mind these changes  I would go for it. Great seas,Great seafood|`|bQyIOB59aa	It's not a bad place to live. It's a lot crappier weather than SoCal, but probably better than NYC. There isn't as much to do in Portland, compared to either of those, but it's not like a cow-town or anything. It has it's cool points.<br>  <br>  The greatest plus would be that outdoor recreation is easier to access. Especially skiing, snowboarding, hiking, hunting and fishing -- they are all very close to Portland.<br>  <br>  Housing will likely be more affordable than either SD or NYC. It is not really fallen dramatically like some places, though. I have a friend in Las Vegas and the housing market there has really tanked.<br>  <br>  A lot of people move to the NW and like it, but it is slowly becoming more congested. The Portland area doesn't lend itself very well to the influx of people and the city planners are not big on expanding the roads and freeways, just trying to add to the commuter transit (light rail, busses) even though only like 5 percent of all commuters use those. When it snows, even an inch, the whole town goes ito a massive panic. Extended storms become major problems for most of the city.<br>  <br>  I have been to San Diego and if I could live there, I probably would instead of Oregon. It's a great area. I haven't been to NY, but from what I have read it seems pretty expensive.<br>  <br>  If you can deal with 4-5 months with a lot of gloomy weather and rain, it's not bad and I would recommend it.|`|fb17a4f3434f8253251d5408b1f1b4d8aa	There are a ton of people from NYC out here!<br>  So you will feel very welcome....I have even thought of starting a NYC- PDX  meetup group on the web so my NYC friends can all meet up for drinks and be NY for a day.  Good thing you have a job before coming out here. The population is going to reach 1.3 million more people in just a few years time. Cause this is the HIP place to be. People are<br>  moving faster than jobs are being made out here! West Coast attitude is a bit of adjustment as service here is uber friendly but the peeps move very slow<br>    Good luck! bring me a bagel and a pizza maker!|`|0qx4G0Apaa	I don't live in Portland, but I have spent alot of time up there. I can tell you for sure that Portland is one of the nicest cities that anyone can live in. The sky is gray and it rains for about 5 months in a row, but in the summer it is very nice. Very green, lots of water, many great restaurants. Alot of things to do no matter what you like to do.|`|l7rn9zE9aa	Hey I live there! You can move here too, I guess there enough room for both of us. Just don't move downtown is all I'm sayin, oh, and bring an umbrella.|`|d3d6ceaaad607500cc76ca79aa6d26c9aa	Be ready for a big shock coming from NYC. I have traveled there, (I live near Portland) and it is a world apart. <br>    You have heard all the good things about Portland from the magazines and other posters, so just to make sure you are aware of a few things, keep in mind:<br>     Lots of outdoor recreation - but except for skiing you wont be outdoors much from Nov - April. Reason = rain.<br>     Cheap public transit - but slow. (mostly buses)<br>     Plenty of micro-brews and coffee shops - but how much can you drink?<br>     Stodgy social scene - a few active groups but options are limited and things move slowly in general.<br>     Crowded roads, traffic jams, unemployment higher than the rest of the country, are the norm here. You'll notice a lot of younger people come here but don't always stay more than a year or two. The reason: lack of good paying jobs. <br>    Of course the pluses are the natural beauty and people are more laid back than back east or even in California. But for someone from New York, that may begin to bother you.<br>    Good luck.|`|nAFxMqfVaa	You seem to have received quite a variety of answers! <br>  <br>  Okay, here is the gist on Portland.<br>  <br>  I recently had to move back to San Francisco, where I am from, and am counting the days until I make my way back to Portland, Oregon. It is, in my opinion, the best city on the west coast. <br>  <br>  However, that's only my opinion, and we (obviously) are not the same person.<br>  <br>  Like anything it depends on what you're interested in. For example, I'm a 32 year old female who is creative and likes things a little ... different. As the motto says, "Keep Portland Weird", and what a fitting motto indeed. My hair is a mixture of pinks, blues and greens, and while it may cause more than one eyebrow to raise in other cities, it's barely even noticed in Portland. Everyone is a little punk rock in Portland. It's what makes the city so killer. <br>  <br>  For instance:<br>  <br>  Oregon has the most liberal free speech laws in the country, and because of this Portland boasts the most strip clubs per capita in the nation. The Bar Fly bus even does a tour of nudie bars, complete with discounted entry fees and lap dances. <br>  <br>  Portland has more micro-breweries than anywhere else in the nation. <br>  <br>  Portland has more bike commuters in the country (we're bicycle friendly here!)<br>  <br>  Portland has the largest independent book store in the world, Powell's Books (the best place on earth). <br>  <br>  According to a recent NY-Times article, Portland is the most affordable city on the west coast by a large margin (over 100k!).<br>  <br>  If you're into outdoor sports you won't be disappointed either, as snowboarding, rock climbing, surfing, skateboarding, cycling and more are either right outside your door, or a close drive away. <br>  <br>  However, all of this being said, the move from NY to PDX will likely come with a few speed bumps. A friend of mine made the same move and likened it to "hitting a wall" as far as his personal life goes. Not for lack of people, but for lack of the same sort of "City that Never Sleeps" lifestyle. Portland rocks, but it's still small. Keep that in mind. <br>  <br>  One more thing: it's best to be open minded, queer friendly and art hungry when moving to Portland. It's a creative city with like-minded individuals and they locals would like to keep it that way. <br>  <br>  <br>  I hope this helps, and remember to try Stumptown coffee when you finally make it to the Great Northwest--it's to die for!

Consider buying tickets as soon as possible (they're not on sale yet, but check back over the next few weeks):    http://tampabay.rays.mlb.com/schedule/in...    One thing that's good to know is that Tropicana Field is an indoor stadium, so rain won't be an issue.    After that, the playoffs begin.  Eight of the 30 MLB teams will compete.  The Rays and the Florida Marlins may or may not make the playoffs.  If they do, ticket prices rise dramatically.  You won't know who's in the playoffs until late September, or even that final weekend of the regular season!

Your chances of getting in will depend on all the usual college entrance criteria and who writes your letter of recommendation. There is a hugh need for women in the engineering field.  So if your mention your passion for engineering, it will give you a foot in the door.

There may be the rare private (individual) land owner who would let you cut down trees on their land - but you would need their permission. <br>  <br>  You would not be able to cut down trees on public land - including conservation estate and reserve land.  Even if you are tramping/camping in a national park, for instance, you are not supposed to cut down trees for firewood - only use what has already broken off or fallen down (and, at this time of year, you need to be aware of the fire hazard, anyway).<br>  <br>  There would be civil and potentially criminal consequences if you chopped down a tree without permission - wilful damage, for example.|`|f610fce787e6299e681ff222a3173ed5aa	No way.

AA12339318	I have lived here all my life, and, including all the places I've visited and heard about, it is the one place I'd rather live.<br>  <br>  The weather is fairly mild, most of the year, with temps that don't go over the hundred degree mark or under the freezing mark more than a few days out of the year.  Snow is almost unheard of and, on the rare days in a decade where it might, never sticks to the ground, except in the surrounding mountains.  In fact, the nearest DEPENDABLE Winter snow conditions are at least three hours drive to the East, in the Sierra Nevada Mountains. (Bear Valley, Heavenly Valley, Incline, etc.)<br>  <br>  It's a BIG city, with just under a million residents, but very spread out along most of the Santa Clara Valley.  I'd say that the city is about twenty miles wide and about thirty miles long.  Several major shopping malls nearby and dozens of significant sized strip malls.  In other words, it can be a shopper's paradise.  Multiplex movie theaters all over the place, clubs, parks, schools and on and on.<br>  <br>  About an hour South of San Francisco, and as little as a half hour's drive over the hill to the beach at Santa Cruz, with it's boardwalk rides and games, and surfing spots.<br>  <br>  No question that your parents are making a good decision, but, not much you can do about finishing off your high school.  The good thing is that, depending on what school you might be going to, the education is great and most people are good folks with all kinds of varied interests.  Good community college system, with about a half dozen nearby and amazing four year colleges and Universities within easy reach including San Jose State Unversity, University of Santa Clara, Stanford University, Unversity of California in Santa Cruz, etc.<br>  <br>  Welcome, to you and yours to the Capital of Silicon Valley.|`|a172ded814c17e4957eba16acd8888d7aa	i lived here all my life <br>  it does have it's pros's and con's <br>  it can be very expensive, congestive <br>  you have your mean and good people <br>  the high schools are very good <br>  the weather is Beautiful|`|6Gfz125Paa	It's a great place.

I can wait my turn in the waiting room as I am not the only one who needs to get in. If my situation gets bad, I can get in pretty quickly and so can anyone else.<br>  This bit about waiting years to see specialists is something I have never ever personally experienced. Like emergency rooms, patients are triaged on a needs basis.

I have presented with chest pains to a full waiting room and was seen first.  I have also presented with major joint pain (knee) in an empty waiting room and was told that I may have to wait a long time.  The major problem with health care in Ottawa is that at the hospitals you had better understand French because a lot of the staff in the hospital speak French first.  Also there is a French ONLY hospital in the east end of town don't even think of going there if you speak English.<br>  <br>  People with lots of money seem to think that if we go to a private system that things will be better.  It will but only for those with the money the rest of us will be left to rot.

The bathroom is public for at most 15 rooms, usually no more than 8. The showers are private though, it's not one huge room with shower heads.
AA10478980	As others have suggested, hotels here in Key West are very expensive, especially in tourist season.  Look into the B & B's and you may find something less pricey.  Everything is more expensive here in KW.<br>  <br>  As for attractions, do the Old Town Trolley tour to get you started.  It is an hour and a half, fully narrated, and will give you lots of ideas about what else you want to see and do, so do that early in your visit.  Do the trolley, not the train.  The trolley is a much better deal.<br>  <br>  Check out the sunset or star gazing tours on a couple of the schooners at the waterfront.  I did the Western Union (name of the schooner) star gazing tour last week, and it was impressive.  An astronomer conducts the evening.<br>  <br>  Visit Mallory Square at sunset for the sunset celebrations.  It can be fun.  Lots of different street entertainers and concessions.<br>  <br>  If you like churches visit St. Paul's Episcopal Church (corner of Duval and Eaton) at noon for the free noon day pipe organ concert.  It is very moving.  And the stained glass windows in that church are wonderful.<br>  <br>  Consider the glass bottomed boat tour.  Many people rave about it.  You'll see it advertised at the waterfront.<br>  <br>  A couple of suggestions for restaurants - Blue Heaven (especially for breakfast), El Sibonay (not sure of the spelling) for the paella (you have to order 45 minutes before you want to eat) and sangria, Louie's Back Yard (reservations required), and if you like desserts try the dessert shop called Better Than Sex - expensive but very good (reservations also required).<br>  <br>  Walk Duval Street for the many bars, restaurants, and shops.  Visit Kermit's on Greene St. for key lime pie.<br>  <br>  Enjoy Key West.|`|222fefcab240bbc8185b3c5e80f3a75faa	I've stayed in Key West about 4-5 times.  Hyatt, bed and breakfasts...etc.  But, I think the best place for the price--was La Concha Inn.  That was for our wedding.  <a href="http://www.laconchakeywest.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.laconchakeywest.com/</a><br>  I thought the pricing was reasonable.  The hotel is nice.  There was live music in the bar.  There's a rooftop bar.  I would stay there again.|`|AA12069058	To be honest many of the hotels on or near Duval St are overpriced. Depending on when your vacation is, if you have time to book ahead look into a bed and breakfast. Many have your own private cottage, breakfast every morning, and some even have a personal mini pool for the two of you. They are also very reasonable. Much less than a hotel in that area.

s6ekS4IQaa	I didn't watch much of that but wasn't it cancelled? I kind of liked it!|`|e7478813ada64290f8f2aac212f84685aa	Apparently it wasn't making enough money or having enough viewers which is unfortunate because I loved it and it ended with a real cliffhanger|`|XQDDttvEaa	The show's last episode was aired in Jan. or Feb of 08. However, I read somewhere that TNT is talking about picking it up from where it left off.|`|cnMk2jWAaa	I don't know what happened either, but I loved that show!|`|XD6as6d9aa	I loved that show. Mainly because some things were so over the top. I love it how even cell phone camera footage can be so clear you can see a person's reflection off of a car or something. The show ended when DeLinda felt something wrong with her baby and found blood. I think the show jumped the shark when DeLinda got pregnant. Once that happened, everything was "the baby needs this" or "the baby needs that." Her actually job as the restaurant manager wasn't an important story line anymore. I actually liked Cooper in the last season but didn't like Piper's character.|`|rUvaitfLaa	What sucks is that show was Part 1 of 2!  SO they left everyone hanging.  Danny and Delinda were to get married and Mike and Piper announced that they are married, and I'm sure we were gonna find out the rest in part 2, but to no avail, NBC gave it the heave ho and left all the viewers wondering :(|`|AA10240904	Yes, and it was cut short due to viewership.  And it was not realistic about Las Vegas so locals were not supportive of the show  People who pay the bills, advertisers, want people to see their product so a show gets cancelled
l9c2Uw5baa	noooo polish mafia!|`|HltUWMgOaa	Omerta<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omert%C3%A0" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omert%C3%A0</a>|`|d1f4428d3bd66886014cedd35e30d605aa	Polish Mafia<br>  <br>  are they saying "yes we do good job for you boss, cheap cheap"
AA11375099	All hotels in town offer great rates because of low occupancy.  So, you will get a good price so the next question is location, location, location.<br>  <br>  I enjoy the Sheraton Hotel because they just opened up their new tower, and their health club is 24 hours and it also is brand new.  It is on 6th ave just a block south of Nordstroms, Pacific Place, and next to The Cheesecake Factory and just 6 blocks from the Market.<br>  <br>  So, great price, great location, new rooms, and new health club. <br>  <br>  What more could you want?|`|uKWcgLLoaa	I just heard on CNN today that the best way to get information on specific hotels in specific cities is to go to traveladvisor.com. It features write-ups from real people who have already "been there, done that" so that you don't make the wrong choice. I'd give it a try.|`|pgFD4n1Caa	Actually the website is www.tripadvisor.com and I agree it is the best way to find hotel rooms anywhere in the world. <br>  Why do you want downtown? Hotels down here are expensive and trust me, wil kick you out if you are too noisy. My suggestion would be to go to an Embassy Suites in Lynnwood. They have a fun pool - huge room to sleep all of your friends and perfect for your set up!  The hotels downtown are overall catering to the business set.|`|94a35c89cad76d7f41e298b8c841e4f5aa	I'd stay at the Sheraton, and if you want a spa day, go to Gene Juarez spa which is just a block or two away (and it's GREAT).
c363eaa290dc8e495be336637b3b338faa	I took my first Carnival cruise this year. Free drinks include orange juice, milk and chocolate milk at breakfast, with coffee, tea, water and lemon aid available always. You're gonna love it! Have fun.<br>  <br>  Edit: Canned Coca-Cola products go for $2 per can or a beverage card can be purchased in advance. They are not free.|`|ifgzHzA3aa	Water (which I hear is better than bottled), coffee, tea, juice and lemonade are all included.  I've also heard that fruit punch is no longer offered.  But, just drinking water and juice, you'll be set.|`|EJpiaCMQaa	Non alcoholic drinks, such as teas, water, colas, are included in the price of the cruise, along with all meals.  All alcoholic beverages you have to pay for.  It can get quite expensive drinking alcohol on a cruise.  You will, however, have to pay for any drinks, non-alcoholic and alcoholic, when you get off the ship and go into your port town.|`|Dghr9r3vaa	Lemonade, fruit punch, iced tea, coffee, and water are all included in the price. Being you don't drink much soda you should be all set. It's an awesome time you are going to have a lot of fun!|`|mKCFz2d1aa	yes
AA11310817	Are you SURE the rooms are $359 each?<br>  Because most (99.99999%) of the time the price shown on the sites, whether it be the cruise line's site, or the vacation sites (priceline, orbitz, travelocity, hotwire, etc.) list the price Per Person!!!!<br>  They might have rooms that fit 4 people in one, but that is not the majority of the rooms, and they are limited.<br>  So, look again,. cause I'm almost certain $359 is the price per person, in a 2 person room.<br>  I could be wrong, but it won't hurt you to check. <br>  You'll also have to add taxes and port fees, and that might be a couple hundred dollars more...|`|093c633e155de952249b95398f169e87aa	for all my cruise information and bookings i use www.vacationstogo.com i find there website very good to find information and great prices, especially last minute deals. also i find their experienced staff very helpful when i call them. im sure if you call them they will explain the prices to you, and give you a better price than you have been quoted|`|Sbo3IqLlaa	go to the carnival website:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.carnival.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.carnival.com</a><br>  <br>  If you go to cruise search, then you should be able to find the exact cruise you were looking at, and it should tell you about the pricing and everything, hope this helps.
7toznquyaa	Call Atlantis customer service, They use to be available online for up to 30 days.  You can find the 800 number on the website.|`|hvjWpq2naa	usually you have to ask for the photos/pay for them before you leave.|`|dOlpuEpraa	Sorry, but your photos are long gone...<br>  Once they take your picture (which they do to many tourists) you have to go and collect them BEFORE you leave. If you don't then they are discarded....better luck next time.

T3b1Mq3saa	<a href="http://www.deluxehairsalon.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.deluxehairsalon.com/</a> in Center City|`|VEi3R0craa	I am puerto rican with very curly hair and I go to the Dominican shop on front and Allegheny in Philadelphia.  They are the truth.  It's called Belisemo's its the first shop on your left hand side as soon as you cross Allegheny.  For 30 dollars they wash, deep condition, blow dry, trim and press with the bumpers.  Yes all that.  My hair is almost to the middle of my back and that's all they charge.  My daughters is a little less because she has a short bob she does not like long hair.  But they are great and really into hair care.
