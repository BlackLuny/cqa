Will I lose everything I have on there?	i just got a 1st generation itouch and already synced it with my itunes library on my computer. i'm about to update the software version to 2.2 and pay $10, but i'm not sure if i should do that yet becuz my grandparents are going to take it to china. so what would they have to do so that all the files on the itouch will still be on there when they sync it to itunes on their own computer? and will the software version stay the same or will they have to pay another $10?      i opened itunes help and it said something about if you connect it to another computer then it will ask you if you want to transfer purchases or something, and also something about authorizing the computer...?   and when the itouch is brought to china, it's going to stay there, it's not gonna come back and sync with my computer or anything

I use Duracell rechargable batteries in it.       When I put fully-charged batteries in it, with two mintues, they'll be almost empty. I thought it was just that the batteries I had were old, so I bought new ones, but the new ones are doing the same thing.      So what's wrong with it? Do I just have a lot of bad batteries, or is something wrong with the camera?

(ive got one of the original silver DS', say what you like i just dont like DS  lites... and my DS  has never failed me!)       i just have 2 questions:   1. do you think its worth getting? (if you dont know, it has camera, music player, and DS shop so internet as well if you download it.)   its just that one of the reasons i didnt like the lite was because it was too small, and the DSi is going to be 12% smaller! and looked a bit tacky (it looked like it was made out of plastic from the pound shop!!) i also didnt really like the colours.    do you think i should wait until a decent colour comes out? (ie the metallic silver 1)       2. how much is it? (in british pounds please) and is it worth spending that much money on it?       (3. how much do pre- owned DS  games sell for? i have about 10 games i never go on anymore, so would a shop give me anything for them, and how much?)      thanks alot guys!!!!!!   clo   xx

So also, on a side note, what game do you reckon i should buy if you dont think I will like Okami? (I like strategy, simulation or complex shooters and 3rd person action games , although I've never tried a first-person for the Wii).      Sorry For The Length.

20090220121059AA3YxQM	Consumer Electronics;Cameras	Copying pictures from camera to computer?	When I plug my camera into my computer I choose to use Picasa, but Picasa does this thing where it copies the pictures from the camera, but all that does is make the pictures go from a thumbnail to a full size for me to view. I can pick from those to import onto my computer. The problem is I'm creating a surprise for my mom and we use the same computer, I don't want her seeing these images. I want to put them on the computer, transfer to my ipod touch, then delete from the computer. Does "copying" leave information on the computer, or is it gone when I remove my camera? How can I remove pictures I import from my computer? Can I still keep it on my touch? Also, can I do this with videos, or does it have to be on the computer as well? I would appreciate any help answering any of these questions, thanks a lot!

20090220121227AA86Ufr	Consumer Electronics;Cell Phones & Plans	Advice needed.. I need to Cancel Contract with T-Mobile contract says 12 Months, but T-Mobile say it is 18 !?	Help.. Please.      I upgraded my phone last year through phones4u, this meant agreeing to another contract which I was told was 12 months, and is clearly stated on the contract.      The contract ends on 1st April 2009 , as stated on the rear of the contract T-mobile require 30 Days Notice.      I rang T-mobile the other day to confirm this and was told that I am in an 18 month contract and could not cancel until October, which will cost me another ￡120 for a network which is useless in the Gloucestershire area.      To cut a long and tedious story short, I have been sent between T-Mobile and Phones4u and have not been able to resolve the matter, T-mobile say that because they did not fill out the contract, then I have to take up the issue with Phones4u, Phones4u staff at first agreed that it is a twelve month contract, but then changed their mind after ringing T-Mobile, they are now saying that because my original contract was for eighteen months back in 2006, then the upgrade contract is also for 18 months, although at the time I was told by phones4u that it was for 12 months and the contract that I signed clearly states this fact.      Where do I go from here, should I just cancel the agreement as stated on the contract and cancel the direct debit, or do they have any legal right to hold me to the agreement they say I have ?, I don't want to cause any credit issues for myself, but I am not going to be bullied into paying another 6 months charges which I did not agree too.      I have the contract in front of me in black and white and it clearly states twice that the minimum term is twelve months, if this means nothing then what is the point of having the contract in the first place?      Please Help, Thanks

20090220150938AAe7sX9	Consumer Electronics;TVs	New 120Hz TV seems to have lag when playing games, will HDMI 1.3 cable prevent this?	I've gotten one of those new 120Hz Tvs and whenever I turn on the 120Hz Automotion Plus, the display is immediately enhanced dramatically and I love how cool it looks. Though since I'm a hardcore gamer, I notice the smaller things, and one of those is the lag between my inputs onto the controller and the output of the TV. I'm playing Resistance 2, press the X button, I see that I jumped until about 1 or 2 seconds after I hit the X button and it's really bugging me because every second counts in an online shooter. I'm using a standard HDMI cable, will one of those 1.3 HDMI cables prevent this?

My warranty has expired, but someone told me that if I tell an Xbox rep I have the Three red rings of death, they will send me a shipping box and swap my xbox for a fixed one without even checking. Do they do this (and if they don't, what would happen if I was caught)? If not, is there anyway to get the rings? Someone told me to leave it on for a long time until I get the RRoD. Does this work, and would it jack up my electric bill?

The cheapest I've come across for purchasing a new one is around ￡45 plus p&p. I already have a brand new canon power supply model CA-570. I was wondering wether I could use this power supply instead of forking out for a new one. The dc out put on the CA-570 is 8.4v @ 2.0 amp. If this is possible does anyone know where I could buy an adapter to change the 3mm round pin powertip on the CA-570 to the one used on the CA-590E, alternatively just the power tip and I could cut off the tip and attach the new one. The socket on the FS100 is similar to a mini usb but not identicle.   TIA .

20090220150847AA9Q6Eo	Consumer Electronics;Cameras	Would you agree with this on the Rebel XSi, D60 & K200D?	According to CNET:      D60: Despite modest improvements in performance and a couple of new features, Nikon's D60 fails to impress and costs more than some competing models.       Rebel XSi (EOS 450D): It doesn't stand out for its feature set or design, but the Canon EOS 450D delivers on performance and photo quality.      K200D: Pentax's K200D entry-level SLR gives a lot of bang for the buck and has better performance than last year's model. Despite low noise and pleasingly detailed images, technically inaccurate colors keep it from capturing the gold medal for image quality.      My notes:   - D60 is in-the-middle on price, so I wouldn't mind getting it... but photo quality, noise... when blown up? Is the quality good, or mediocre? And inaccurate colours?   - K200D apparently has quite some noise at 800 and upwards (ISO)... and is the colour wrong, like the D60?   - EOS 450D/RebelXSi... seems to be perfect. Only thing is, it's about four hundred bucks more.      Which do you recommend, etc...
