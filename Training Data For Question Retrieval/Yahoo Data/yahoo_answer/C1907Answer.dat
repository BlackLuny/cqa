My suggestion is to go to their store and investigate for yourself before kindly giving me the best answer|`|V5xHaIAcaa	You are asking a question that only has one answer,  especially with the information you have provided    The "for sure" answer, it will require a complete re-build.    Good luck|`|eTLG23N4aa	Since you didn't give us much detail about anything, my crystal ball says you should try to repair your operating system by loading your Windows CD/DvD and if it's XP, choose to repair installation on the second prompt after you restart your computer and has loaded files. You might have to hit F2 or delete to get into the Bios and set your boot device order to CD/DvD drive first and hard drive second within the first few seconds of turning your computer on. If that doesn't work you must have a hardware problem. I would start with Memory or hard drive.|`|cVwcX9amaa	oh...the BSOD (the Blue Screen of Death)...lol    well sorry, not a PC wiz here so sorry~|`|dOMzkQIraa	A BSOD (Blue Screen Of Death) as it is known is usually caused by bad drivers or bad hardware.

Without knowing what the bluescreen says I can't tell you what..|`|f9f27Cmhaa	There should be a bunch more details on that blue screen - the driver file name, etc.  You'll need to write down all this information to have a shot at troubleshooting this.  The trick is managing to remember/write down which driver is causing the problem, since the screen usually flashes by so fast.  Once you have that, I have usually been able to get a solution to my problem by googling the full error message.  Generally this has been a driver problem for me.|`|Iy0jPSJjaa	Could be a problem with device drivers, hardware or software.

UV8bN0Giaa	You can't go wrong and I personally recommend Dell! There are hidden long-run costs that one does not initially see when you purchase a Notebook PC other than Dell, HP or IBM and later encounter difficulties or attempt buying replacement parts like a battery, or say a keyboard etc.    Also if you're buying for college then I do NOT recommend a Notebook PC bigger than 15.4" bec we have 3 DELLs incl a larger 17" Notebook PC and the larger ones are nice but much too heavy to lug around campus as well as too big for lecture hall desks in college...     I mentioned we own 3 Dell Notebook PCs and why I recommend DELL, HP or IBM for those living in the United States is that those 3 particular PC Notebook manufacturers literally supply all the business Notebook PCs to the major corporations and Government so replacement parts are readily available esp on EBAY at even a more reasonable price than the manufacturer website. Thus in the long run, being able to get the exact replacement part extends the life on your investment.    FYI my 1st Notebook PC was Gateway bec I couldn't afford Dell at the time and what a mistake is was when I needed to purchase a new Notebook battery     Note if you are looking for DELL bargains, then visit their DELL OUTLET site...    http://www.dell.com/outlet    Hope Above Info Helps!|`|h84TXiuraa	don't get a macbook because the speakers are a big disappointment.

Go into the tools menu and find 'manage add-ons'    disable the add-ons one by one until you know which one is causing your IE to crash. then enable the others and it'll be fixed.     By the way, you may possibly notice a whole bunch of add-ons that you don't need, especially from unverified or dubious looking sources - disable them (worst case scenario you just enable it again if webpages don't seem to load properly).

vA7f1Mknaa	For basic users RAR and ZIP are the same thing. They just compress folders to either make sending something easier or to make the contents smaller.    ZIP is standard with windows, RAR is commercial and requires and extra program. WinRAR does it best, and actually doesn't stop working after the trial period is over so I suggest getting that.    RAR does have some distinct advantages over ZIP, though, other than slightly better compression. The biggest advantage of RAR is that you can break up a file into multiple RARs to be able to upload and send it more easily. For instance, if you wanted to email a 100 MB movie file sending 100 MB at once is probably more than most email clients can handle. With RAR you can break it up into as many parts as you want, each part name something along the lines of "***.part  .rar" so you can send even large files through regular email (even though it might take a whole lot.)    The only real disadvantage of RAR is that its harder to view the contents inside without extracting them. If you have a ZIP file of a folder of pictures you can go and look through the pictures as if they were in a regular folder without extracting them, they just won't show thumbnails. With RAR each file would be on its own so you wouldn't be able to just enter the RAR and flip through the pictures in a program like you would with a zip.|`|NvDrejgdaa	Just to add to the answer(s)     Winzip and 7-zip support 256-bit AES encryption while WinRAR still only seems to support 128-bit AES (according to the website)     7-Zip also supports file splitting, no ads,     WinRAR and 7-zip support multi-threading not so sure about the Winzip.   Hope that helps.|`|CsIvy5MAaa	RAR files are generally better compressed, and if using protected files, they're generally harder to "crack" then .zips.|`|ye1tS9a2aa	rar files are bigger|`|HBK9aIhxaa	Zip is more common, and is built into Windows OS    Rar is used by the WinRar app, but has the distinct advantage of being able to be divided into a number of smaller pieces of any specified size (an example being if your file is bigger than your USB pen drive, you can break it down into pieces that will fit, although you will have to transfer the pieces one-by-one). Password protection is more secure also.|`|AA12336121	ZIP is more widely compatible "out of the box".    RAR uses different compression- it gets files much smaller than zip can, it has better encryption support. Downside is you need to install software to read it. 7-zip is free, WinRAR is commercial.    RAR is really better for sending large files online- less upload/downloading time and more robust password protection if it is something private.    Hope this helps!|`|YVE64dJUaa	ZIP and RAR are both compressed file formats    essentially they are two sides of the same coin in that they are both diffeent file formats that achiee the same goal to reduce the size of a file to make it easier to transport mainly over the internet etc...    rar is less used now as its compression ratio is less and so zip is able to compress the data more and make the size if the file less also when decompressing the file zips type of archive structure makes it quicker|`|CKE9oLlZaa	7-zip is the best in most ways except it doesn't create certain formats but on the up side it can create self-extracting, cross-platform, archives    http://www.download.com/7-Zip/3000-2250_...    check out wikipedia for lists, comparisons, abilities and overall usefulness  start by searching for 'data compression' then click the 'see also' links for the easy to compare lists|`|xRMh4uhlaa	ZIP is just like a store  RAR compresses the files into the RAR|`|dOMzkQIraa	The compression algorithm is different.    It's been said that rar compresses slightly better..|`|pOaS9P38aa	The ZIP file format is a data compression and archive format. A ZIP file contains one or more files that have been compressed to reduce file size, or stored as-is. The process of compressing the document(s) into a zip file is also known as deep-packing. The ZIP file format permits a number of compression algorithms    RAR is a proprietary archive file format that supports data compression, error recovery, and file spanning. It was developed by a Russian software engineer, Eugene Roshal (hence the name RAR: Roshal ARchive), and is currently licensed by win.rar GmbH.

They aren't both running at the same time.

9c6ebc182576660d8156612bb4465a10aa	Here are some suggestions on what you can do (sorry i don't know of any good tutorials on this matter):    1. Use the Exposure Dialog Box  - Click on Layers > New Adjustment Layer > Exposure. Move the exposure slider to the left.    2. Use Levels  - Click on Layers > New Adjustment Layer > Levels. Select the white slider (the one on the right) immediately below the histogram (the little graph chart) and slide it slowly to the left, you should see the image darken    3. Use Brightness/Contrast  - Click on Layers > New Adjustment Layer > Brightness/Contrast. Move the Brightness slider to the left.    4 . Use Shadows/Highlights  - Duplicate your image to a new layer (Layer > Duplicate Layer) and select the new layer.  - Click on Image > Adjustment > Shadow/Highlights try working just with the Highlights slider, to make the lighter areas of the image darker.  The reason for duplicating the layer is that this process is destructive (as all the others are non-destructive) and by duplicating the layer you can still have your original for future use.    To find out what works better for your picture and what you will be more comfortable using , the only way is to use trial and error. If after your are done, you are not happy with the results, don't save the file, just start over (you can revert it by hitting F12 on your keyboard). You may also find that you will need to use a combination of these to achieve the results you want.|`|AA10570173	Although I can't see the photo, I can tell you that if a picture is badly overexposed (lots of areas look too bright or white) there isn't a lot you can do. It may not sound like it makes a lot of sense, but when you overexpose a shot, all those light areas are essentially white pixels and there is no information in them, so you don't have anything to work with. An underexposed image, on the other hand, can often be fixed, because there is enough information in those darker areas (although completely black may be as bad as white).    Sorry if this wasn't much help.
AA12336121	It's illegal to download copyrighted material through limewire without the consent of the copyright holder.     Stealing is a different sense of the word. Yes, it's illegal, but when you "steal" a couch, or a cd, you steal a physical item and deprive the rightful owner the right to sell it. When you download an MP3, you don't take one away from the copyright holder.    This ignores right/wrong.

UV8bN0Giaa	You can't go wrong and I personally recommend Dell! There are hidden long-run costs that one does not initially see when you purchase a Notebook PC other than Dell, HP or IBM and later encounter difficulties or attempt buying replacement parts like a battery, or say a keyboard etc.    Also if you're buying for college then I do NOT recommend a Notebook PC bigger than 15.4" bec we have 3 DELLs incl a larger 17" Notebook PC and the larger ones are nice but much too heavy to lug around campus as well as too big for lecture hall desks in college...     I mentioned we own 3 Dell Notebook PCs and why I recommend DELL, HP or IBM for those living in the United States is that those 3 particular PC Notebook manufacturers literally supply all the business Notebook PCs to the major corporations and Government so replacement parts are readily available esp on EBAY at even a more reasonable price than the manufacturer website. Thus in the long run, being able to get the exact replacement part extends the life on your investment.    FYI my 1st Notebook PC was Gateway bec I couldn't afford Dell at the time and what a mistake is was when I needed to purchase a new Notebook battery     Note if you are looking for DELL bargains, then visit their DELL OUTLET site...    http://www.dell.com/outlet    Hope Above Info Helps!|`|laofAjTAaa	look at some of the IBM's or Acers is you need something durable - just make sure the specs are around dual core processor, at least 2gb or ram and 160gb plus hard drive - a dedicated memory type graphics card is a must if your into graphics or gaming|`|iQNXZ1zdaa	Depends.

I learned almost all I know about computers by repairing laptops in College that were riddled with spyware, viruses, and rootkits - some so infected that they needed to be completely wiped and reinstalled (and of course, no one had the original disks, so they ended up using the computer lab for the rest of their years at college).    Of course, if you are well versed in PC security, and know what to download and what not to download, check out HPs business line - they have some excellent, well priced notebooks.

AA10570173	The difference is one is the full version that doesn't require any previous versions. Pagemaker was a very popular page layout design program developed by Aldus. Adobe bought Aldus years ago to acquire Pagemaker. They stopped supporting and upgraded Pagemaker when they developed InDesign. So in order to be able to use that $200 version, you would need to have a copy of Pagemaker already installed, and the serial number for that copy of PageMaker, or you will not be able to install and register that version of InDesign.|`|AA10453678	for the second one,  you'll probably need a pagemaker license or registration number in order to get the good price. it's what the call a competitive upgrade.

Open My Computer  Right-click on C:  Click Properties  Click Tools, select Error Check (check all and fix), when finished click defrag & run.  4. Click Start, Run ipconfig -renew (type ipconfig space renew)  5. Restart. Right-click on Taskbar, click Toolbars, select Quick Launch to restore    All these things should be done regularly. The more frequently they are run, the less time they take.  -Note: Games and videos are mostly graphics. Graphics create large files. If these suggestions don't help, you might need more memory.    Last, if you haven't cleaned your registry in a while. This is necessary. Your registry holds all the information regarding updates, installs, un-installs etc. Each one of those events produces a key. That key needs your PC's resources and free space.

g0mYq2Oiaa	The computers use Exclusive OR.  So:    6 = 00000110  4 = 00000100      00000110 (6) XOR 00000100 (4) = 00000010 (2)    XOR means that, you compare the bits in the same position in each byte.  If they are both 0, the result is 0.  If they are both 1, the result is 0.  If just one is 1, the result is 1.    btw, computers can't do just addition, in fact they can't do addition at all.

Computers run on a math system that works using functional powers of 2.    When they started naming them they figured that 1024 was close enough to 1000 to be called "kilobyte." When they came up with that term decades ago that was about as high as they thought they would go when it came to memory. When the started getting even more memory into computer chips they realized that going by the metric system would be wrong since they weren't going on factors of 10, but powers of 2 when it came to memory so they instead opted for a new naming system, Mega, Giga, Terra, Peta, etc.

qxR6BysNaa	The opacity CSS setting is not valid for all browsers.  It's the CSS standard, but not everyone supports it.  For full support, try:    div.outter  {  filter:alpha(opacity=50);  -moz-opacity:0.5;  -khtml-opacity: 0.5;  opacity: 0.5;  }    div.outter div  {  filter:alpha(opacity=100);  -moz-opacity:1.0;  -khtml-opacity: 1.0;  opacity: 1.0;  }    Also: bear in mind that you're going to get the combined effects of both if you try to make the opacity of the inner 'div' 0.  I know you're making it fully opaque, so it shouldn't be a problem, but just FYI.    If you put a piece of red glass on top of a sheet of paper with writing on it, it'll be partially opaque/transparent.  You'll see the text bleed through, but it'll be red.  Let's think of this as your first 'div' (the 'outter' one).    Then put a clear piece of glass on top of that.  Well, that clear piece of glass is fully transparent (not opaque at all), but you're still going to get the red bleeding through from the red glass underneath it.  This is your second 'div'.    There's a LOT of fancy legwork involved in clipping out the portion of the first 'div' so that a transparent inner 'div' does not bleed it through.  It's been done with jQuery, to my knowledge, but it's an enormous pain.    Final thought: make sure you've set the inner 'div' to have some kind of background color, even if it's white (or otherwise matches your layout), or it will be fully opaque with a transparent background -- which doesn't do you any good.  Example:      Hi!  What's up?  Back again      (Using styles defined above.)|`|DTnUWwzxaa	Transparency is like the Harry Potter cloak of invisibility.  Anything contained within is affected.  You can add additional invisibility cloaks to make things within even more transparent, but you can't make something more visible.    I'm not sure what you mean by CSS without images, but your best bet would be to use a transparent PNG background image on the outer div instead of using actual transparency.  It generally depends on what you're trying to accomplish, but if you have a basic 50% white transparent overlay under a picture or text, for example, it would work just fine.  You call it from your CSS just like any background image.  Unfortunately you also have to use a CSS filter behind IE conditional comments to make the PNG transparent in IE6.  Any links or form elements on top of a transparent PNG should be tested, and if they don't work you will want to experiment with relative positioning on those elements.      Failing that, and for a different particular type of design (for example, the divs are a predetermined width and height, you can change your HTML so that they are not nested.      Instead of :  a   you would have :  a    Set the width and height in the css and use relative positioning on the .wrap div, and absolute positioning on the .inner div with the left at 0 and top at 0.  that will position the inner div on top of the outer div, using the wrap div as the reference point.  This technique has a lot of extra markup, so I don't really recommend it.

YNEpBN5saa	It depends entirely on what you want the page to contain.    I would say 10 to 20000 perhaps. As someone once said, "The devil is in the details".    The question is, does the required page need to be like this?  http://www.ebuyer.com/  or like this?  http://www.hubbe.net/example3.html  or something completely different?    Your question is a bit like saying "How much does a car cost?"    I am heavily into programming and could create a very complicated page listing items from a database for example. You could login and insert, update, delete, select items etc.    Or you could want a pretty page which is static and never changes.    The page could have Flash animations.    The page could just be a page of text.    The page could call Web services from every country in the world to supply temperature readings to the page.    Or you could want a page which contains all of these things.

a3C6DeNeaa	Some of the better commercial 2D animation programs such as Digicel Flipbook, Toon Boom, TVPaint, TAB, and PAP, have Student or Express versions that are fairly inexpensive. However, you might be disappointed by how crippled these stripped down programs are compared to their more expensive Pro versions. But if you look hard enough you should be able to find them cracked online (rapidshare, bittorrent). There are some free alternatives.    If you're doing old school drawn on paper frame by frame stuff or stop-motion or 2D, I'd suggest MonkeyJam. It's free.    http://www.giantscreamingrobotmonkeys.co...      If you're on a Mac, use Pencil(there's PC and Linux versions as well).    http://www.les-stooges.org/pascal/pencil...      If you want to do Flash animation like the stuff on Newgrounds.com, either break down and buy Adobe Flash or you can try Creatoon which is free. It's not Flash, but it also does symbol oriented   animation.    http://www.creatoon.com/index.php

ergyzs8Saa	Hiya,    You need to right click on the cell.  Go to formatting  and choose somthing like Text, or Accountancy.    That way it will keep it just the way you want it to.    Cheers,  Calvin's Network Web Host|`|15017428de404442efe6fff34a4dd6edaa	That is because 00014546 IS 14546, numerically!

Same problem if you used Access, you would have to format as textl.|`|HYk5jhnqaa	You have to place a ' before your number  Or format your cells as "Text"|`|uD1SWxdmaa	Right click on any given cell and select Format Cells. In the number tab, select "text". I know that seems a little odd. The default is General and even if you choose Number, the leading 0 will disappear after you exit the cell. The only way to keep the leading 0 is to format it as text.     Keep in mind, if you format a cell as text, you probably won't be able to do any calculations with the numbers. So it depends on what your purpose is as to how to format it.     Also it's nice to know that you can highlight an entire column, or row, or blocks and right click on the highlighted area. Then format the cells the way you want it and it will change all of them to the new format.|`|AA11737313	Do not format as text, unless it is text...

Firstly, use a '000000 in one cell, and the number in the adjacent cell e.g. 14546. The use the Concatenate(cell1, cell 2) and that will place leading zeros in front of the number and will work as a number. If you then use calculations you will need to concatenate the result with '00000 again.

xLgdhxxdaa	The speed of the wireless router is really not relevant since all wireless routers, even 802.11b (old standard), is 11 mbps (Megabites per second). Most internet connections are far below this speed so your connection to the internet is the real limiting factor.    Netflix streaming is available at 3 different levels. Basic which is 500 kb/sec or 0.5 mbps, Good 1 mbps, and High which is 1.6 - 2.2+ mbps.      Poor reception however can significantly slow down your connection speed and therefore is also a factor. When the signal level drops below a certain level, the router and network card attempt to renegotiate at a slower speed to reestablish signal. Make sure your computer is close enough to your router with little interference to make sure you are getting the best possible speed from your router.|`|KnMpfK5Qaa	Its not your router that controls your your internets speed, if netflix says your internet speed is too slow you need to upgrade your internet connection though your isp.|`|83vhCGW1aa	Contrary to what some said, router speed does usually matter.

All of these programs have a timeline where one can insert pics, vids, and music; thus, you will the be able to add in all the effects like fade etc.    It takes practice and some learning, but it's not too hard.|`|vg3Tj90Naa	windows movie maker

If you had a lot of viruses your computer probably wouldn't be working, what you've probably got are cookies, which aren't harmful. It's pretty easy to remove them manually but give CCleaner a try, it will delete internet history and general junk as well.

This is partially due to the fact that about 25% of the ISP's have not implemented correct security, and 'Cross Site Request Forgeries' can be made.  These forged sites even have forged 'Certificates' of the now cracked MD5 hash breed.  To reveal if a DNS has possibly hacked hash security, use Firefox with this add-on:  http://codefromthe70s.org/sslblacklist.a...  It only advises if the condition exists, but at least it's something.  Also, get current Certificates from Microsoft:  With Internet Explorer, go to Microsoft Updates, then select the 'Custom' button (not the 'Express').

No  Example:   superclass obj = new superclass();  subclass obj2 = new subclass();  obj = obj2; // making superclass reference subclass  Why not subclass to superclass  :   Consider scenario ->   Animal => super class  Dog => sub class  Cat => another sub class  now both dog and cat belong to animal class  But dog is not the only animal that exists.  As it is also apparent from its sibling class Cat.  That's a more general way to understand the concept.  In technical terms :  As the variable type determines what methods you can use "on" it, a variable of a subclass type can hence expose more operations available than the superclass has implemented.  That's why a variable of a subclass type can't reference an instance of a  superclass.|`|75nbESJUaa	hmmm... if u mean java, no. java is single-inheritance. We must specifically call the super.getMethod() or super.numOfUnits if super does in fact have a different description from subclass.    Super can never call subclass.

tIDNEwdMaa	Possible virus damage:  Microsoft has released a patch to address a critical remote-code-execution vulnerability in Microsoft Internet Explorer. The MS08-078 bulletin (Microsoft Internet Pointer Reference Memory Corruption Vulnerability) addresses the vulnerability for Microsoft Internet Explorer versions 5.01, 6, 7, and 8 Beta 2 running on Windows 2000 SP4, XP SP3, Server 2003 SP1, Vista SP1 and certain Server 2008 configurations.

You can do this using:    |`|3nXO9cM8aa	  function inverse($x) {      if (!$x) {          throw new Exception('Division by zero.');      }      else return 1/$x;  }    try {      echo inverse(5) . "\n";      echo inverse(0) .

IF the code works on another PC with PHP on a localhost, then just reinstall php on your machine.    I have worked with PHP, Apache and MySQL for a few years now, and if you'd like more help, just email me @ rjf1986@yahoo.co.uk    you can send me the code that you are running that makes your PHP crash, and if it works for me, then you can just re-install PHP on your machine.    alternatively, if you don't have much experience, i can send you detailed instructions on how to install PHP dependin on the operating system you use!    good luck

De6n2MaIaa	i use online converters to change file types for fanvids.  http://www.mediaconverter.org is your best bet for converting files.
Ev6WQRmzaa	Yeah if you Google them you can usually find out more about them    For example:  I just Googled 2vcard and it seems to be a "script to convert an addressbook to the popular VCARD file format."    Then I Googled "vcard file format" and it appears to be "a file format standard for electronic business cards."      So 2vcard doesn't seem to be something I'd really need, but maybe you'll find it useful.|`|AaoclPYCaa	Google them.

I use Firefox for every-day browsing and website development, but I also check my sites in Opera (among other browsers I have to be compatible with).|`|zLFALc8caa	To be honest, I haven't used Opera, but I have used Firefox and Google Chrome.  Firefox is a great browser with easy to use features, but I would choose Chrome as my favorite browser to use.  I really like the look and design of Chrome.  When you first start it up, there is a preview of your most visited sites, and all you have to do is click on one and you're on your way.  I find it even easier to use than Firefox and Explorer.

lJZ6D9dTaa	There is no such thing as fast dialup. 56Kb is as fast as it gets.     Dial-Up = 56Kb (If you are lucky)    DSL = 1500Kb (1.5Mb) - 5000Kb (5Mb)    Cable = 4000Kb (4Mb) - 20000Kb (20Mb)|`|oUjuw66uaa	no, there is no SUPER_FAST dial-up. Some services claim they can boost speed up to 7X but that really doesn't amount to much (and is actually mostly smoke and mirrors...)   Dial-up is typically max 56 kbps, true high speed (Cable DSL etc) is measured in MBps|`|wf8rKR9Zaa	I recommend buying a good wifi card with an external antenna and using a neighbors internet for free or see if a neighbor would be willing to split the cost and share the service.    or if you have a cell phone with 3G or EDGE capability then you can add internet service to your cell plan and use your phone as a dongle. This would probably be the cheapest way, but using EDGE would be slow.    DSL is about 17 times faster than full speed dialup.  The modern internet is almost unusable at dialup speeds and EDGE speeds for that matter.|`|uhZcuBzUaa	Find the best cable internet deal you can. Call your phone company, ask them to beat it. (or visa versa)    Cable internet from my company had a $13.95/month deal. My phone company matched it for $1 more and a faster speed.    Some companies offer really slow DSL (768k down / 368k up) for a lower price.    You could also go in with a neighbor's connection - maybe by offering to pay half of his internet connection cost in exchange for a spot on his wireless network (that one depends on your neighbor and his ISP's terms of service agreement).
KAsVj3C0aa	Download Google Earth, but you will have to cache the areas you want to view and your cache can become filled up.   http://www.gearthblog.com/blog/archives/...    http://earth.google.com/    Google Gears can do this with Google Maps, but I don't think any developers have implemented this yet.     You could also try mapping software that comes on a CD or DVD.
xMqgB2GDaa	Your system will recognize it, your operating system will not. You need the 64-bit OS. 32-bit programs AND operating systems cannot address more than 4GB of memory space. Most programs you have are going to be 32-bit. So even if you upgraded to 8GB, you would not see that much performance improvement.    The 64-bit OS can recognize far more than 16GB, but your slots likely do not support more than 2GB (each) for a total of 8GB. There are distinctions between what your software supports and what your hardware supports.     You would have to reformat with the 64-bit version of windows to support more than 4GB. Personally, I have the 64-bit version and 4GB of RAM, and have 4 slots (2 unused), and have little desire to spend $40 to upgrade it, because there won't be that much of a performance increase.|`|eTLG23N4aa	There are several theories and debates about how much memory computers and operating systems will recognize and use. I did a little testing myself . I have found the XP 32 bit will recognize 3.2 -3.5 megs of ram.  Vista 32 bit home basic and home premium will recognize 4 gigs maximum.  With XP and Vista 64 it will recognize 8 gigs and Vista Ultimate 64 bit will recognize 16 + gigs of memory.    There are many configurations of motherboards, operating systems, and memory that could throw my limited testing down the tube though.|`|AA10670145	The Dell reps are correct.  Vista 32 will not recognize more than 4 gigs of RAM.  Vista Ultimate 64 bit will recognize 8 gigs.  32 bit operating systems max out at 4.|`|Z2rxLctiaa	Don,t upgrade!|`|YEAH6xrEaa	you hav 32 bit Vista right?  so your system cant go over the 4gb limit even though you have 4 ram slots..   32 bit systems only recognize 3.5gb of RAM or less actually..  dont add another 2gb ram to your system you'll just wasting your money

lOZq7htXaa	Java (or Javascript) is a programing language used on many, MANY websites and is needed to display those pages correctly. You can indeed turn it off or not install it, etc. but you will not be able to see a lot of the lay-out looks, animations and several other key features of many popular websites. You internet browser makes use of this and many other "plug-ins" such as Flash or Quicktime - so the browser acts as a "shell" for these applications in a way.  So should you have it? Yes. Do you HAVE to have it? No. But it's recommended.|`|VtnwtXtFaa	java is usually used as an app for games like pogo.com bases there whole site on java...but there is alot more to java than just games...u dont need it but is helpful to have|`|EY5RXxYNaa	Basically, Java and JavaScript (JS) are entirely different. If the question is about Java and not JS then,    Java is a technology for software development targetting various paltforms. All Java based programs require a virtual machine (execution engine) for running on an operating system platform. This virtual machine is called Java Virtual Machine (JVM) or the Java Runtime Engine (JRE). It consists of all the basic requirements for making Java applications run error free on the target machine.    Hence, it is advisable to have a latest version of JRE installed on our machine so as to make every Java app run without any hassles.    The JRE can be downloaded from the website of its vendor Sun Microsystems (http://sun.java.com).|`|K1prVAsjaa	Java is a premier programming technology, created and distributed for free by Sun Microsystems.    It is an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) language that can be used to create Windows GUI (Graphical User Interface) applications (such as games, business systems, etc.), mini-programs called Applets that run a GUI in a browser, or web-based server-side applications that manage the browser interaction with web-based apps like shopping carts or web-based business systems.    If you don't have it on your computer, and you need it for any reason, you will be prompted to download it. You can download the latest yourself from Sun's web site (java.sun.com), mostly developers do that so they can write programs.    Do you have to have it? Depends on whether you need it or not. You'll know if you need it.    BTW, it does not tend to clean up well behind itself when it updates, so if you download an update you will want to uninstall the older versions manually from your PC's Control Panel. Obsolete versions of anything have potential security issues.|`|GuBnmZ8naa	java is a programming language.    You need to enable javascript in your browser to properly view and use some websites.  Its very safe, but pretty much nothing is completely safe.  You don't need it, unless you need to access a website that uses it.

tJkQf0Jaaa	yes, lower CAS is better, but as you go from ddr to ddr2 to ddr3 the timings will go up higher. look on newegg's site to see comparisons between the memory latencies, youll see what i mean.|`|xMqgB2GDaa	Lower latency is better. Latency is the number of clock cycles it takes for the Cas to refresh. More cycles=longer time before grabbing more info. But this only counts when comparing apples to apples (meaning one speed to a stick with the same speed). Many people will overclock their RAM at a higher frequency, but need to loosen the Cas latencies a little higher to do so. This is typically more beneficial than a slower speed with a lower latency.
UF1obD42aa	Definitely go with the vacuum.  The handheld hose attachment, or a handheld vac like a Dirt Devil WITHOUT the brush attachment.  You don't want anything beating against your computer, you just want the suction.  You don't want to use compressed air from the outside, because you're just going to end up blowing junk into your computer, where it could cause more problems.  Opening up the computer and using compressed air to blow dust out is a good idea, but you're still going to want a vacuum handy to suck up the dust you're blowing around so that it doesn't just settle right back down on the computer.

46OYLEXWaa	it depends on your connection speed and also the file size you're uploading... the smaller the file the faster you can upload and complete processing...    It is recommended that you upload wmv file format... good quality and smaller size.. so faster upload... and also faster processing.    Using windows movie maker -- you have to save it into the proper file format, that is wmv file (use the "save movie file" on the menu at the top left) before upload..      --for best editing....    use windows movie maker (included in your windows machine)... it can help you make beautiful slideshow or video clip(e.g. mixing your songs with pictures/video/etc).... then save it as video file such as wmv file format... finally upload.    or .. Just get those clips you want , save & convert them, and then mix/match with pix/sound/etc using windows movie maker to create new masterpieces....    this will help you.... Use 'zillatube'. This is the easiest (and also the fastest) way.    Zillatube produces mpg/mp3 formats from youtube that are compatible with windows movie maker(or media player), and more.    It is very easy to download and convert videos. Then edit those converted mp3/mpg videos with windows movie maker... save your file as wmv and then upload.    It works very well....just google search for "zillatube"    =============================???|`|PiZvv0tlaa	1st reason: you might have very slow internet.  2nd reason: maybe your video is big size.

KLOe9vDFaa	Hi! Don't worry, you will be able to recover the data. It shouldn't matter at all which OS you had/have on either computer. Most important would be what type of connection the HDD has, likely IDE or SATA. You can tell by looking at the HDD connectors, if you see lots of gold pins then it is IDE:    http://www.computerhope.com/pictures/hdd...    Your new computer will almost certainly have SATA and you will not necessarily have an IDE connection available on your motherboard. Although, you can just open the machine and check. If you do, then great, just plug it in and let Windows mount the drive.    If you really don't want to fiddle about inside, you can purchase (under 10) a small device that will allow you to connect this via USB, regardless of whether your drive is IDE or SATA. This is what you need:    http://www.smcdirect.com/detail.asp?id=1...    I have never shopped on this site and can't credit or discredit it. The displayed product is what you are looking for though.    Let us know how you get along or if something isn't clear.|`|WQ0DzpByaa	Set the jumpers up as a slave drive and hook it up to the second connector on the ribbon cable your new computer's hard drive is on.  You don't have to get anything off of it.  It's already on your new computer as a second hard drive.  The case for the hard drive should have the jumper setting illustrated somewhere.  The jumpers are the the little plastic things on the pins beside your data cable connection to the hard drive.|`|lJZ6D9dTaa	You can connect it to your new pc and access all of your data (not encrpted by windows) while running in Vista.

IApsG1f1aa	For top of the line Hollywood productions companies do not use typical PCs instead they use specially designed workstations that cast upwards of $10K.     If you are looking for something to make good quality films from home you should get a Mac because they are much better than windows based PC for creating videos. You can pick up a decent one for as low as $1,500. The software you want is Adobe Premier which costs about $900. Keep in mind that this is a very complicated program designed for professional use and the learning curve is such that you will probably want to take a class on it rather than try and figure it out yourself. Most community colleges offer a video editing class that will run about $200.     If you want something a off a little less quality but much easier to use I would look into Sony Vegas.     Both Vegas and Premier do include audio editing components however if you plan on doing lots of Audio rendering and manipulation I would recommend getting a specialized Audio editing program. I use Sound Forge however several of my friends use Creative's Cakewalk program and love it as well.     Good Luck,|`|Dt1MCKdraa	mmm good one well i use apple mac computer and i love how easy it is to make movies and music in ilife 09 this type of computer cost me just over 1000 but its not really the computer its just the applications they use to make a good movie|`|eoqTXCGxaa	There's heaps.

Many run Linux, and a farm would cost hundreds of thousands excluding internal software development costs and installation. A personal workstation would be used for things like color editing or splicing clips, and they could be a Mac Pro, a PC workstation, or historically, a Sun or SGI. Prices would range from 5,000-20,000, but used to go as high as 100-150,000$ in 2008 dollars.  Something not so professional will work for indie movie production. Any fast quadcore with lots of RAM should suffice.|`|gDksphD0aa	Most use a Mac
GuBnmZ8naa	Your ISP probably doesn't assign you a static ip.  If you want the server to be able to be accessed outside of you local network, you will need to either pay them more to assign you a static IP or set up DNS.    If its just needs to work on your local network, google something like "setting static IP in ".  Set it to the highest value your router assigns so that you don't have to assign static IPs on every machine in your network to avoid IP address conflicts.

79fa22b0bfcb741ebea37f6761d4896aaa	well I never used an IDE harddrive in an enclosure before. But slave is usually for when there is another hard drive in an IDE ribbon. But since there is only one hard drive on the usb enclosure, I would assume setting it to master (or single if available).    Mind you that now a days most hard drives are sata, which has no need for master/slave settings and rarely needs any jumper settings.|`|kQt4ub3Daa	Since a USB drive cannot serve as a primary partition drive, it would be the controller select option, or if not available - slave.       I highly suggest doing the initial setup for the drive as a full-blooded secondary in the case btw. The power limitations for a drive through USB are very bad for reliability in those situations, and the jumper for the drive will be properly set when you put it back into the external case.                         Good Luck!.|`|0Sl5kmToaa	see your main board map to how|`|4jGKYLRRaa	It shouldn't matter, but I'd set it for master. The more important issues are whether the controller can recognize the drive size and whether or not the drive drive is one of the Western Digital drives that required a jumper for single drive configuration. I'd identify the drive first and check the drive maker's site for information.
BPrZm0Tfaa	If you still need to use an array, you'll need to make use of the Redim Preserve key words in order to handle this.    I also am not sure why a loop would be needed in the event that a single number is generated when the button is clicked.    When using Redim preserve, you're changing the size of the array while still preserving its contents.    For Example  Redim Preserver myArray(3)    If you're using VB .NET I recommend using an ArrayList or a Typed List (available in 2005 and above).    dim myArrayList as new ArrayList    myArrayList.add(number)    OR    Dim MyIntList as New List(Of Integer)    MyIntList.Add(anInteger)      Good luck    Based on your additional details, I still think your best bet is to use a Strongly typed (List(Of Integer))    If you need to make sure that it's unique, when you use your random number generator, check to make sure that number doesn't exist in your list by using the Contains Method.    If myList.Contains(randomNumber) then  'Generate a new Number  Else  'Add the number to the list    MyList.Add(randomNumber)  End If    I'd avoid arrays since you have to continually reallocate memory and that's really the old way of doing things.  If you can't use a typed list, use an ArrayList object.  That will work exactly the same way as the typed list, but there isn't type checking automatically in place. You'll just need to be sure you cast properly when pulling the data from the ArrayList as to not cause an exception to occur.

qMwjrQbOaa	I assume the cabling is a hub-and-spoke topology.     If you don't have proper tools to check, you can connect two PCs peer-to-peer, to check the topology.     Find the hub-end (patch panel) and connect your router, provided your routher has enough ports avaible, else connect through a swithch or hub.     Connect the back-bone of the router to ISP via modem.    If this is too technical to you, you will have to call a network technician. It's just a half an hour work, if the cabling not hacked.    Good Luck!|`|yHI6rfeUaa	The network plugs in the wall must come together at a common location, probably in the basement or in the same room as is the fuse box.  Your mission is to find this location where all the network lines come together.    Think of the cords in the wall as a long patch cord terminated with a RJ45 socket.      You connect a straight CAT5 patch cable to the wall plug and to the pc you wish to connect.    At the place where all the wall cords come together you will note these are terminated either at a patch panel which provides RJ45 sockets or by an RJ45 jack (looks like the end of a patch cable).      You will need a network switch.  Connect the network switch to the RJ 45 patch panel via short CAT5 patch cords or if there is no patch panel, plug the RJ45 jacks into the network switch.  Connect the network switch to a gateway router's LAN port.  Connect the DSL feed to the gateway router's WAN port and you are in business.    You do not need to plug all network wall plugs into the network switch; you need to plug in only those you wish to use (e.g. if you need 1 of the sockets in bedroom 1 connected, you do not need to connect the second socket in bedroom 1 to the network switch, etc.  This will reduce the size of the network switch.  I suspect you have about 16 or more network ports around the house.  If this is the case you would need a larger network switch which costs more; however if you plan to operate only 5 LAN devices (pcs, printers, etc) you would need a network switch that has 6 ports which is less expensive.|`|ONHx5wkJaa	1. plug  your router and your computer with CAT5 cable to the wall  2. from your computer try to ping your router       if success ping then start connect to the internet.      but if it fail find out where is the hub/switch.     but i don't think  previous owner forget to pull out hub/switch and bring it with him.

Sure, they are one of the bigger ones, but once you get in, they have you locked and you cannot transfer your domain to anyone else without having to jump through hoops.  Theyll lure you in with a cheap start off, but after that, youll be paying through the nose.  My clients often find this out the hard way, especially when they dont listen to me.    I recommend going with http://www.directnic.com/      They are reasonable in pricing and their customer service is top notch.  I have never had any problems with them and Ive been using them for more than 4 years.

They will get you the free email, free forwarding, free locking and ability to host anywhere and free transfer away if you need.    Also the Free SSL is not provided with your domain. That is something that is attached to your hosting account. So that is never included with domains.    --------------------------------------...

Just log into your account unlock it (click the unlock button) and you can transfer it away if you want. They dont have any "hoops" to jump thru.

WS95be3Raa	Advantage - total code reuse. No need to worry about the types that will be used.    Disadvantage - usage of lots of data types will result in a very large code, increasing the size of your program.
v8W02iwGaa	Well if you had a DVI port on the laptop you could use a DVI to HDMI cable (i got mine for 15 dollars on amazon) since both standards are digital while VGA is analog. HDMI will support the 480p, 720p, and 1080p resolutions and it looks quite better than vga (I use it for my desktop to a samsung). The tv probably has a has a PC (or VGA) input so you could use a vga cable for this.   For resolution, VGA supports alot of resolutions but may not be exactly the same resolutions as televisions but do support very close resolutions that would work just as well.

NO.    my norton anti virus subscription just ran out - THIS THE SAME AS NO ANTI-VIRUS.|`|dkpIjt5jaa	Surfing the Net without Anti-virus is like jumping between skyscrapers without a net, you might get lucky a couple of times and then you take a dive and end up splattered all over the sidewalk.    Here is my suggestions:    Install a FREE solution until you get your Norton back, you can even keep this free solution after this by having Norton in active mode and this free one in passive (manual) mode as you should not use more than one Antivirus on active mode ( they will declare war on each other ), one Firewall (no options there as war between them will shut down your communication system if you have more than one), one good cleaner, two or three Anti spyware/Malware (they each detect something that the others have not seen) and an Email scanner (if your Virus scanner does not come with one) but have at least one of each (for security).     There is no excuse to leave yourself wide open.      Here are suggestions (and warnings) for free Anti-Virus scanners:    Stay away from AVG ( I have found it more defective than helpful ), it may be free but it has hiccups like the two errors that made the news recently on CNET, the first time it said that Zone Alarm (a firewall) was a virus and the second time, it advised to remove a key component of Windows causing those who did to lose their Windows system (they had to issue apologies publicly for this one).    Instead use Avira: http://www.download.com/Avira-AntiVir-Pe... along with an Email scanner ( http://www.spamdel.com/ OR http://www.glenn.delahoy.com/software/fi... )      Anti-Malware/Spyware suggestions:    Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware: http://www.download.com/Malwarebytes-Ant... is a good choice and has gotten many people out of jams if you keep it updated.     Spybot: http://www.download.com/Spybot-Search-am... is also a good choice if you use it regularly and keep it updated.      Cleaner suggestion:     Glary Utilities: http://www.glaryutilities.com/gu.html to remove junk files or remnants of installs (there is always some).|`|g4ubbgmqaa	you have protection just no up date's|`|fvj7AwKEaa	yeah you can safely browse the internet without antivirus   even though it is not recommended, you can do it  if you only go to sites that you know for a fact are not     vulnerable    i surfed the web for about 6 and half months with no anti   and didn't get a virus or anything like that    if you want to be safe      go to download.com   and download an antivrus for free                    with no added programs|`|Ba5cfwuQaa	No it is not...

DjGEJfaPaa	Pro Tools is professional software - so yes it is very complex. If you want something free check out Audacity or WavePad, but if you want something a little more advanced check out Adobe Audition, Fruity Loops or Sony Acid Music Studio. If you have a MAC - GarageBand is pretty cool software.    Audacity is free, open source software for recording and editing sounds. It is available for Mac OS X, Microsoft Windows, GNU/Linux, and other operating systems.|`|VtnwtXtFaa	i use sony acid pro and sound forge to record....both very user friendly but can be expensive...but they have tons of plugins u can get...email me for details;)|`|7xmv2698aa	If you're looking to spend a little money (about $65), Acoustica Mixcraft is a great choice. It's user-friendly and has lots of options and, like GarageBand, it has loops. And if you want to try it out, there is a 14-day trial of it. Id recommend at least looking at it because it's an easy and fun program with options for midi-input and other forms of input.    http://www.acoustica.com/mixcraft/    Their website says it all, easy, fun, and it works with ACID and GarageBand loops. Definitely take a look.|`|S0dBuepAaa	I know you think pro tools is too difficult to use but it really isn't.  It's worth taking the time to learn to use it.

Worth having a look at before you spend the same money on something that's not much easier to use and has way less features.    Good Luck

That system is a waste of money unless you are going to be running the most graphic intensive games on extremely high resolutions.    This is what I would recommend, it totals $750. This is less than half of what you have up there and it will do the EXACT same thing on WoW and Warhammer.

Thats a very powerful PC.    Price is also very good for a pre-built.  Who are you getting it from?    None of the 3 upgrades sound like a good deal to me.  4GB is plenty of ram, 1.5TB is plenty of storage space (but back up important files on something else, because raid 0 has twice the failure rate of a single HD (its faster tho).  I'm not even sure the GTX is an upgrade.    edit: check out these benchmarks to see if the 280 gtx is a good deal for you.  It wins most of the time, but the 4850 cf wins sometimes.

This rogue is advertised by the Vundo Trojan and is replacing the Antivirus 2009 rogue program that Vundo has been aggressively advertising. If you are infected with the Vundo Trojan you will see a large amount of pop-ups stating that your computer is infected and that you should install Antivirus 360 in order to protect yourself. If you click on the ad, Antivirus 360 will be downloaded to your computer and you will be prompted to install it.    Here is a video of how to remove the virus.  The link is below.    If that doesn't work, there are many other related videos on the side, that use different methods.|`|2RsFn8jdaa	To un-install 'antivirus 360', follow the procedure given below    1.

IuCT3TjGaa	This problem can mean many things, odds are the problem is with the operating system itself. I'm going to give you some instruction of some things I would do if I was working on this computer.   Questions you should consider:   Do you get any error messages? If so contact Microsoft with the error message.   Is you computer under warranty? If so, it's best to let a technician handle the problem. Note: Sometimes they will reformat or replace your hard drive. You could loose all data so it would be a good idea to backup first.   Re-pare Steps:   1) Restart Windows in Safe Mode. As you computer is restarting, hold down F8 and once the menu appears, select Safe Mode using the arrow key and selecting by pressing enter. Note: If windows does not boot in safe mode then seek help from a train technician, the problem may be too complex to go into decision in the message.   2) Consider a system restore. You will loose all data and changes you have made to your computer after the restore date. Open system restore by clicking on the start menu and selecting help and support. System restore should be one of the options assuming you have system restore turned on. (It's windows default so you should.) Select a restore date prior to the problem occurrence. Restore your PC. If you do not want to do a system restore then skip this step.   3) Update any and all ad-ware, spy-ware, and most importantly, Registry Cleaner programs that are running on you computer.   Use the tool:   http://toptenantispywareviews.com/Clean_... [if you do not have one]    http://toptenantispywareviews.com [if you do not have one]    4) Run a virus scan, then spy-ware scan, followed by ad-ware.   5) Your problem should be resolved by now. Restart your computer and see if it works, if not then restart in safe mode again (step 1).   6) If all else fells you can reformat your hard drive by reinstalling windows. You can do this by inserting the windows disk or system restore disk that came with your computer. Follow the instructions given by the manufacturer. WARNING: This will wipe the hard drive of all data, it will be like you just got your computer. You will loose all software and everything.

10af4993fcb827d6fabb27f05cba2be5aa	Many times when a router is not working properly it has to do with the MODEM that the router is connected into.  What MODEM do you have, there are many out there that are NATed modems, meaning they issue private IP's when you connect. If that is the case, you have to setup the modem first (either into bridge mode to by pass the NAT or to use another set of Local IP's for the local system.)    So please tell us, what modem and model and what router and model so we can help you get this working!  There are many notes on the dlink site about the issue.

(Suspect a local type of hack, even in-house???)  Next, Yahoo has folded to the idol/Gods of Advertising conglomerates NAI, which provide 'targeted advertising', which alone is not a major issue (except invasion of privacy) but I'm wondering: How secure is their inserted ads & methods of achieving them.

Your passphrase method, if you can't remember them, sounds solid.    Try an 'outbound' security test & monitoring method for locking down your system.  Good luck...    PS:  About 25% of ISP's are configured to use improperly secured NS/DNS (Name Server/Domain Name Server), which could allow a hacker to create false website 'credentials', which you may be re-directed to & may look authentic, but are in fact 'spoofed';  with further spoofed links, log-in's, or any number of things the hacker wants to incorporate.

Some lists are randomized (if chosen by the person) and they change everytime that page is open. When searching for new friends, you can choose to search by location closest to you, people who recently logged in (by time), or by specific characteristics such as gender, age, or school attended.    We started a business account for myspace and looked around to related businesses in the neighborhood and invited many of those people. We also searched by location to get the most people near our business.     Each myspace account is linked in with an email address that can't be changed. You can add new email, but the original is set so it would be difficult to get an old account for thta purpose too.     Make a new one and search around through friend lists, your target age groups, and locations. You will be surprised at how many invites you get through word of mouth too.

However a laser printer is fast!    If you are going to be doing a lot of home publishing and need versatility to do photo's, heavy stock paper varios sizes and finishes take a look at an HP Officejet Pro - K5400.  The cartridges are very reasonably prices and rated to do about 600 pages a piece (there are 4).  You can get compatibles for less than half price which brings your running cost below most laser printers.    However if you do have your heart set on laser, cheaper isn't better.   To get a good laser printer you will want to start out with realizing that a laser printer has 4 toners (budget for at least $100 a piece) and often a drum, image transfer belt, maintenance kit or waste toner tank which will need to be changed and comes at a cost of about $200 (generally).  If one part is beyond its usage date or workload, your printer will not work.    I use an HP 2550dtn and I hate it.  The running cost for printing about 50 pages per day is about $300/month.  The cartridges are rated for 4000 pages, and I maybe get 900.    At home I use an HP officejet PRO K8600 - the wide format version of the ink jet printer I recommended.   It is fantastic.  It is fast, the ink is dirt cheap, (I use compatibles) the only sting is that after about 10000 pages I need to replace a $100 print head. (the machine has 2).    Look at the officejet pro K5400.  It is a great printer. Relatively inexpensive to buy and sooo very cheap to run.    To put it into perspective, an XL cartridge (88XL black) will print just as many pages as a Black Q6000A cartridge for entry level HP Colour laser jets.    The 88XL costs $40 from HP, compatible for $20.  The Q6000A costs $110 from HP, $60 compatible.|`|Og3vKQeWaa	if you get a laser printer, don't try putting photo paper in it, or you will kill your printer!|`|KNFr79wGaa	If you are printing quite a bit of color, you definitely need a laser.  The average cost of printing on an inkjet printer is about 14-25 cents per page.  A laser printers average cost is about 4-10 cents per page.  A laser printer is quite capable of printing on heavy cardstock, you just need to make sure you buy one that has a manual feed tray and a rear exit tray-this is to ensure a straight paper path.  Most laser printers have both.  Don't just look at HP color laserjets, also take a look at Kyocera color laser printers and Minolta.  The Kyocera C5015 or the new C5200 has the cheapest cost per page and does not have a bunch of parts to replace like drums, transfer belts, etc.  These parts are not designed to be replaced until you reach 200,000 total prints.  All the HP color laserjets do have these other parts that need to be changed at a lower page count than Kyocera, therefore making your cost per page higher.  The toner cartridges for the Kyocera can be picked up for about $50.00 each.  If you are only printing full bleed pictures, yes, you are not going to get the 5,000 or 7,000 copies a manufacturer says that the cartridge should get.  The industry standard is 5% coverage per page.  A full bleed color picture is probably more like 95% coverage.

7XzzmwYaaa	What kind of editor are you using?    [followup] Ah! Good for you - there's only one way to generate 100% perfect code :)    In that case, you'll need some sort of programmatic solution. You can use PHP to do this, though you should be aware of security risks if you decide to get fancy with parameters. You'll also need to ensure you have PHP available on your web server (most hosting accounts do).    In the file that includes the template, wherever you want to include the template:      In the file template.php, simply put the HTML you'd like to use. You do not need to use any more PHP code in the template file - even an echo statement. PHP passes anything not in  tags directly through to the browser.

You need to connect your Broadband Modem into your Router.    You then need connect all computers (devices that you want to connect to the internet) into your Router.    If you have any wireless device/computers you should purchase a "Wireless Router"    Best brands: Netgear, Linksys, Belkin, Dlink|`|8QPzbBujaa	It doesnt matter what computers you have, if you are connecting more than one computer to the internet it is far easier with a router. The best router out there that I have used (and I have used a few) is the Netgear D834g most internet providers give them out for free but if not you can pick them up at any electrical store - curry's, argos, pc world etc etc. You do need to check them though as there are two types. One type is for cable customers such as virgin, and the other is for standard telephone line customers such as bt etc. They all come with a straight forward installation disk and your internet provider should be able to provide you with any additional settings you may need. The router will be best connected to the computer that already has the internet on.|`|wf8rKR9Zaa	are you using dial up? or DSL?  if you have DSL, you should connect the DSL modem to the router and then connect all your computers through the router.

If you are using dial up, I suggest looking at your cable provider or Verizon for internet service.|`|7fd15b7507af7da3c6ae3fb710bbdd1aaa	If you'd like to use a router, all you need to do is plug it in and plug your modem into it using an Ethernet cable.    From there, you can either plug your computers into the router using Ethernet cables or you can access the Internet with Wi-Fi, if your computers have it.    Good luck and I hope I helped you!|`|qMwjrQbOaa	I assume your router is configured by default.    Remove the Ethernet cable from your old computer, and plug in to the router's backbone port.    Use two cross-over CAT5 cables with RJ45 connectors, connect from router ports to your new and old computers' via network cards.    In both computers,   right-click 'My Computer' > 'Computer Name' Tab > 'Change..' > select 'Workgroup'    In both computers,  Control Panel > Network Connections > right-click network connection > properties > Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) > properties > select Obtain an IP address automatically    Restart both computers, router and modem. Both computers can access internet.    Your internet bandwidth will be shared between your two computers.    Note: If you're not planning to buy a router, you can simply use one of the computers as the router. It's very simple with windows XP (Home-Office-Network).|`|ONHx5wkJaa	you need Router because now you have to share a DSL connection    two difference room  and no wire : so you have to buy Wireless Router    and check that two computer can use wireless connection.     but for security reason looking for Router that has firewall feature  like DoS|`|mQ7ZAFd6aa	Well here's how it normally work. you connect your internet connection to the wan port of the router then you connect the computers to any of the available ports and that should be it.     Now the trick is how does the internet come in. usually a cable or phon cord connects to a small box that's the modem. since you said phone company I'm assuming you have dsl. so that bos is a dsl modem. you should just have to connect the dls modem to the wan port on the router.    If you are one of those rare cases where the modem doesn't work unless you enter some pppoe or pppoa info than your gonna need to setup that ppp info into the router that will be the hard part. you will need to contact the phone guys for that info and read the instruction on the router to input that info.

KLOe9vDFaa	Hi! Restart the computer and enter safe mode (press F8 as the DOS window disappears and the transition to the Windows graphic appears). LET US KNOW IF YOU CANNOT ENTER SAFE MODE :)    When Windows has booted (hopefully the error did not appear) in safe mode, go to Start-->Run-->msconfig-->Enter. Select the 'Startup' tab and uncheck everything of unimportance. Apply and OK, then restart the machine, allowing it to boot normally.    If the error does not appear, then progress has been made. Again go to Start-->Run-->msconfig-->Enter and select the 'Startup' tab. Via a process of elimination and a few reboots, you will be able to determine which one is the problem. Then, repair the installation of the problem program, or failing that, completely uninstall it and install again.    Let us know how you get along.|`|26k0aOHJaa	Did it show you that when you where turning on your computer or when you tried to use an application?  If it was when you were turning on your computer than you need to get a disk with a copy of your operating system on it.  A disk like that usually comes with your computer when you buy it, but if you didn't get 1 or you lost it then you can probably go to Best Buy and get 1.  Boot your computer using the files on the disk.  Get your important files (ex. work stuff, personal stuff, music, etc.) together and put them on a flash drive or a cd.  Then reinstall your operating system and then when that is done installing just put your stuff from your cd/ flash drive back onto your computer and you should be good.

I've had three accounts with them since 2007 for my sales people who often use wireless connections while traveling. My concern is similar to yours, making sure the local host cannot see my private data. It works well and customer service is good. Since they use OpenVPN I know the software is bullet proof and does what is claimed.

It may still show up in your network list, so unless you're headed back there, you may want to 'Remove' it from the list.  A couple of things to remember about your WiFi lapper:  Using Public 'Hotspots'  can be trouble if you don't use extra precautions.  Because 'open' networks have no encryption between your unit and the router, everything you send or receive is in plain text.  Meaning that a hacker, with a commonly available application, can intercept and log all of your traffic 'packets'; and with the right software, can run brute force programs that crack passwords.  So the best advice is: do not visit sites that are private, or require 'log-in', or credit cards, banks, etc.  The only secure method to use, over a 'hotspot' is a VPN.     You need to make a few adjustments to your system:  Control Panel> Network Connections> right click 'wireless Connections'> Properties> Wireless Networks tab> Advanced button> here check 'connect to Access Points Only' (this will restrict access to only those networks that go to the internet) & uncheck 'Automatic switch to non-prefered networks' (this will prevent 'jumping' to 'ad hoc' networks, stronger signal networks or others, before you have a chance to examine them and make an intelligent decision for security, etc.)  That should help suppress those non-desired networks from showing up.|`|oORln0WIaa	Nope, The signal only stretches so far away.

7vh5fOeRaa	Yes, certainly!    All a computer needs from a router is an IP address.  Other than that, the computer does its thing and the router does its thing.  The two don't really interact with each other, other than to exchange data packets as they travel from your home network to the Internet.    The Linksys router will easily hand out a DHCP IP address to your Vista PC... so you're good to go!  Just don't install the setup software (you don't need it... its just more garbage to clutter your computer); instead, navigate directly to the router's internal web page (usually 192.168.1.1, but check your manual to be sure) and set up from there.

So if you don't put any hotlinking rules in your /home folder, but you put it in your /home/video folder, the rules in the video folder will take precedence.    Anyhow, the below link says "for images" but you can put the video extensions instead of images.    I don't think you can only allow the flash video player- you can only allow a domain or subdomain of yours, and you can prohibit blank referrers (visiting link manually, and some software like older versions of Norton have blank referrers).

I use Nero alot & have never had this happen.  Are you using Nero Vision to burn your dvd's?  It may be the quality of disk you're using (Sony & Verbatim are good quality) & DVD+R is better to use.  It could also be that your burner is starting to go.  Try cleaning the lens & dusting with compressed air, but it could be that the laser is going out of alignment & Nero can't complete the burn.  It's not uncommon.  Look at Nero's burn log for errors, you find it in C:\Documents and Settings\Owner\Application Data\Ahead\NeroHistoryLog    Hope this helps.|`|pj5xtMACaa	Get WinFF (www.biggmatt.com/winff) and convert the file to .VOB  Then burn that to DVD using Nero|`|uD1SWxdmaa	PLAYING--  Most dvd players will not play avi files. The avi files will need to be converted to dvd compatable mpeg2, then authored to the proper dvd file structure.    As long as you have a compatible player (DivX) and your AVI's are also DivX (and sometimes XviD) you would simply burn them as DATA. There can be problems though as not all AVI's are encoded the same.  Goto Divx.com to get the drivers.    This is my advice too. IMO, the DVD players with Divx capability and a USB port eventually pay for themselves by eliminating the need to burn DVDs at all. I would recommend the Philips DVP5982 player as it has a USB and can therefore play AVI files from a hard drive or USB flash drive. Plus, the upscaling feature of the drive works well on an HDTV.    BURNING & CONVERTING --  Actually Nero can make a VCD or SVCD from a 700MB CD that will play in a DVD player. You can try that to see if it works.    If Nero still gives you problems, try IMGBURN, it is a great free program that burns ISO images and will also burn Video_TS folders (VOB files) to DVDs. I use it in Vista x64 and it is perfect.    Also,  Other software -- (see full details below)  TMPGEnc  DVD Flick   DivxToDvd  dvdSanta  The Film Machine  DIKO  VirtualDub    I have found an exceedingly useful AVI-to-MPEG converter called TMPGEnc. Look for it at http://www.tmpgenc.net/  it is extremely useful for making VCDs from AVI files. Basically, a VCD file will work when dealing with MPEG files......so rather than let the CD burning program handle the encoding (which usually takes a very long time), TMPGEnc is relatively quick compared to the former CD burner program mentioned. Give it a whirl; Ive been using it for over a year and it gets the job done well.    You can also try - DVD Flick it is a free program which converts avi and burns the videos to a dvd if you don't want to buy a divx DVD player. It's very good.     Here is a guide that takes you step by step with DivxToDvd  www.dvd-guides.com/content/view/98/59/    For a 1-click AVI-to-DVD dvdSanta does a fast, good quality job, and is only $20.    Try another all-in-one program like The Film Machine, or DIKO (bothfree).     Any problems or errors you can try:  If you really care about doing this, get VirtualDub, I like VirtualDub MPEG2. Open the AVI in VDub (it may complain about bad audio, click OK), go to Video and click "Error Mode", then select "Conceal errors and resume decoding at next keyframe". Then scan for bad frames. When done, make sure under "Audio", that "Source Audio" is checked. Then make sure under "Video" that "Direct Stream Copy" is checked. Then under "File" save the AVI. You'll have a new AVI with CBR audio (VDub and many encoders hate VBR AVIs), a good header and masked frames. Still no guarantee it'll work, but I've made many bad files usable that way.    -- Good Luck

RZQnxoF1aa	This problem can mean many things, odds are the problem is with the operating system itself. I'm going to give you some instruction of some things I would do if I was working on this computer.   Questions you should consider:   Do you get any error messages? If so contact Microsoft with the error message.   Is you computer under warranty? If so, it's best to let a technician handle the problem. Note: Sometimes they will reformat or replace your hard drive. You could loose all data so it would be a good idea to backup first.   Re-pare Steps:   1) Restart Windows in Safe Mode. As you computer is restarting, hold down F8 and once the menu appears, select Safe Mode using the arrow key and selecting by pressing enter. Note: If windows does not boot in safe mode then seek help from a train technician, the problem may be too complex to go into decision in the message.   2) Consider a system restore. You will loose all data and changes you have made to your computer after the restore date. Open system restore by clicking on the start menu and selecting help and support. System restore should be one of the options assuming you have system restore turned on. (It's windows default so you should.) Select a restore date prior to the problem occurrence. Restore your PC. If you do not want to do a system restore then skip this step.   3) Update any and all ad-ware, spy-ware, and most importantly, Registry Cleaner programs that are running on you computer.   Use the tool:   http://toptenantispywareviews.com/Clean_... [if you do not have one]    http://toptenantispywareviews.com [if you do not have one]    4) Run a virus scan, then spy-ware scan, followed by ad-ware.   5) Your problem should be resolved by now. Restart your computer and see if it works, if not then restart in safe mode again (step 1).   6) If all else fells you can reformat your hard drive by reinstalling windows. You can do this by inserting the windows disk or system restore disk that came with your computer. Follow the instructions given by the manufacturer. WARNING: This will wipe the hard drive of all data, it will be like you just got your computer. You will loose all software and everything.

On the first one the hard drive failed and on the second there is an issue with the motherboard where it cannot accept 2 sticks of RAM with out crashing... And they sent the laptop that has the failed hard drive back and got their money back, and I bought the second off of my parents for $200. I then spent $70 replacing the hard drive to an 80GB and $20 boosting the RAM up to 1GB so I'm in about $300 into the laptop, and it works now. Now that it works it is a fine machine. It is certainly nothing special, since it is an older computer it is certainly slower than a new computer but it does everything I need it to very well. (The computer that my parents bought for $300 is identical to the one displayed in the link, except it is a drab gray, so I spraypainted it black lol)    Its pink, which I personally think is really cool. It has OpenOffice, which is like Microsoft Word, but its free. You will not be able to play games on it. The top scratches pretty easily, unfortunately. I doubt the paint color on top is high quality, but it should look nice at least as long as you take care of it. You cannot really upgrade anything but the Hard Drive and the RAM. The hard drive is really really small. You know the 32 GB iPod Touch? The iPod touch actually has more storage space than the computer. So keep that in mind. The 512 MB RAM is actually just average, so thats not bad at all. It has volume controls that are next to the power button, so thats kinda nice. The speakers don't go all that loud though, you'll have to crank them up all the way so you can hear them in a room that has any noise at all.     If you understand all of that, and you still want to get it, go ahead. But be careful with it, make sure there is a warranty!!! so if it fails you can get your money back. And just play nice with it if you decide to go for it. And the entire machine is not pink, just the top of the lid.    My laptop was absolutely identical to the one you want to buy, then I upgraded it. These laptops may or may not have issues, so make sure that you get a warranty.|`|TMWF2apFaa	its ok....nothing great.    The hard drive is kinda small (30GB) so dont expect to be able to store alot of games, videos or programs on it.    And it has 512MB RAM so dont expect to do much multitasking. It will handle most programs but only one at a time. But the RAM is upgradeable to 2GB at least so that is something you could always upgrade later on.    I would ask for a few more pictures...of the bottom and sides to make sure no major scratches or dents in it. It looks to be in decent shape though.

7bf62358ee706efffb78c25a9c7d5a00aa	Torrents, per se, have no effect - they're just files.  Downloading copyrighted content is illegal and a violation of copyright, so you WOULD incur liability.  And downloading copyrighted music and video files without paying for them usually incurs the risk of downloading viruses, since the people who are ripping those files usually have viruses on their computer from the files they've downloaded.    You should be aware of how many people come here to Yahoo, begging for information on fixing their computers after they've been hit with so many viruses that all the advice they get from computer stores is "buy a new computer".    Also, most internet providers will now send you a warning if they catch you downloading copyrighted material.  If you do it after the warning they'll terminate your internet account.    All in all, downloading copyrighted files via torrent isn't such a great idea.  Downloading files that are legal to download, whether by torrent, FTP or any other protocol, is usually okay.|`|14d0ad3dfdb4dd36a9f896b96a702e69aa	Bit torrent and other file sharing sites being used to get (free) music and videos  can be total disaster for your Windows machine.  Because they use multiple 'peer contributors' to feed bits & parts of a requested file (music, movies, etc.) back to you, there can never be any kind of certainty about the status of the sender's file.  Whatever they have =  you get: malevolent or not.      Once downloaded to your machine, all bets are off about it's safety to open, transfer, use or re-send; and size of a file has little bearing on what it may or may not contain; scanned or otherwise.    To get an idea of how prolific and devastating this can be just look at the number of 'Yahoo Answers> Security' requests for help about virus/spyware.  Most of these Yahoo users are younger & more likely to be using the trendy socializing sites and peer-2-peer services (Limewire, etc.).  Hackers know this and target efforts to infect machines by these sources (aka 'vector').       Once infected, a long cleaning , endless aggravation & malware prevention steps will not guarantee immunity from a re-infection, because virus crafters constantly change the names, file properties, footprint & signature, source vectors or anything possible to propagate their garbage.  Use @ your own peril...|`|g3U8788Zaa	Always scan your torrent before opening and you should be ok.|`|48e9baf113e4951f779199c900a19f63aa	A torrent is a type of file and therefore has no effect on the computer. It's just a file.  What happens is that people put viruses or corrupt files into these torrents and that's what causes problems. It's no different than downloading an MP3 from Limewire, for example, you can get a virus like that too.  Torrents are generally used for movies and tv shows, so if your ISP monitors your downloads, you can get in trouble. I know my ISP has a 3 strike warning system before they shut your internet off completely.  By the way, downloading an MP3 for free is just as illegal.|`|ke6zUtbQaa	besides answers will ban u froming asking questions if u keep asking about them but there awesome. Use firefox its scan the file before utorrent opens it a minor check against viruses  most of the files are zipped and u can scan it before u open it.  Ive probably got 20 gb worth of random assortment and ive only encountered one virus and it was a suppose to be a ebook. Technically transmitting copyright info is illegal but the organization that is responsible for suing people released a press release that the are no longer going to be pressing charges. Plus the chances of you getting caught are slim. I recommend pirates bay, isohunt and torrentpond. a search for alot of torrent    hope that helps   youll prblly need various other program to open the zips fyi

Wow ... given all the people having issues with them on those links I guess Macs aren't perfection on earth after all.    regards,  Philip T  **********    ******  LOL .... easy there, Steve ... it was merely an observation with just a little light hearted humor. No need to get defensive....it ain't like I offended someone's sister .... PCs & Macs are just metal boxes.|`|tIDNEwdMaa	Philip is correct that Macs are not perfect.  Only a fool would say that they are.  But why would he dis Macs for being less than perfect when Windows is so much farther from that illusive bulls-eye?    Oh well.  Such is Windows worship.  Now on to my answer:    Hold down Option, Command, P, and R immediately after the start up tone.  Hold them until you hear four more tones.    If that does not fix it, then insert the OS DVD, and hold C during boot to make the eMac boot from the disc.  Install the OS making SURE that you select the option to preserve user settings.  Before installation, Disc Utility will run to check and repair the startup disc.    If this does not fix it, you may have a hardware problem.

If you are set to mirror data on a second hard drive they both have to be the same model, or at least  partition sizes to let the system start.       When finished fixing this problem, re-partition and rreformat the new hard drive again, since it will have some "low=level" actions performed on it while it was RAID-Striped as a mirror instead of a continuous drive.

Kt5p7nO1aa	Your Automatic Updates are configured using a local or domain policy.     If it is not part of a domain then run "gpedit.msc" at the command prompt.  Modify the settings in Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > Windows Components > Windows Update.    If the server is in a domain then you will need to locate the server in Active Directory Users and Computers.  Once you know where it is use Group Policy Management Console to find out which policies apply to the server.  Then go to the same place in Computer Configuration and change settings as you like.

R7b150Iyaa	Rev pretty much nailed it.  If you CC someone in an email correspondence, it means that they should be aware of the email's content but it is not addressed directly to them and they do not need to act on it.      Example: if you are giving a project to 3 different subordinates, you are sending it to all of them in the To line.  If, however, you are sending it to the 3 subordinates and want your boss to be aware that you are giving the project to these 3 people, you would send it to the subordinates and CC the boss.    Hope this answers your question!|`|AA10375835	The "To:" field is for the people to whom you are sending it, and the "CC" field is for the people whom you wish to know about it but who do not need to act on it.

For instance, yahoo answers page appears to have different frames (If you've built a website you know what I'm talking about.) and each frame acts like its on page.  So in order to use the pad to scroll the page, you would need to click in the shaded area to actually scroll (this is not the case but for example.).  So just make sure you click somewhere on the page if it isn't working, and if it still doesn't try a different area on the page.

Yes, you should be worried because there are all sorts of strangers out there (and some of them are pretty strange) but if the site has good policies and is effective at policing out the abusers, they can be okay.    Just be cautious about what you say and who you talk to.  Never post private details of your life.  Never provide identifying information (where you live, how old you are, etc).

NBH4Kzrgaa	as of right now games get capped by the CPU.... like when you compare two really good cards such as the 4870X2 and the 295 you will see in some benchies that they both have the same max FPS....this is because the CPU cant keep up, although it dosnt really matter since this is usually like 200 FPS+ so its not something to worry about.....|`|d7ad08b207b33f53609b7f36506e5efdaa	The most common scenario for subar gaming performance is the GPU-bound system.  Especially because so many major manufacturers put systems into retail chain stores with Quad-Core CPUs and integrated graphics or crap like GeForce 8400gs cards.    You can be CPU bound if you've got very high-end graphics cards, but this is a far less common occurence, since most people who go out of their way to purchase a GTX 295 or Radeon 4870X2 have some clue about CPUs.  They wouldn't pair a $500 top-of-the-line graphics card with a $50 Athlon 4800+ processor.    The old rule of thumb still applies- spend about 50% more on your GPU than your CPU for optimal performance.   The difference between a $100 CPU and $150 CPU is minimal- for graphics cards, you're jumping a whole tier.    For the highest-end graphics cards- yes, you'll see benefits moving from the Core 2 Duos & entry-level Core 2 Quads in the $175 range, to more powerful processors.    But for most people whose budgets are midrange (between $100 and $300 for their graphics cards) they get a bigger boost from upgrading to a more powerful GPU or adding a second card in SLI/Crossfire.|`|mQ7ZAFd6aa	basically they working together. the video card is for the graphics ofcourse but all it does is graphics well unless you have a nvidia card 9000 or higher cause it have the phsyx chip too so it does both physics and graphics but the CPU is running verything else it's doing the math so if you have alot of thing happening at once you need a fast CPU to do the math for it and the graphics card to do the graphics.|`|ChBK5Lv9aa	PC gaming really depends on your GPU the most. If you have an E5200 and  a GTX 285, then you will be able to play Crysis on high settings. But, if you were to have a Q9550 at 3Ghz, and a 9600GT, then you would only be able to get medium settings if you were lucky. Your GPU is what you should put more money into.|`|vbmLkmzpaa	PC Gaming kind of runs hand in hand on both. However, if you have a graphics card that lacks power then your CPU will be compensated of its ability to truly shine because your GPU would be bottlenecking, vice versa if you have an awesome GPU but a run down CPU.    Best thing to do is make sure both are top notch, like make sure your CPU has enough frequencies for your GPU to unleash all its rendering demons!|`|XlyLakYAaa	They are both important, though I would argue the CPU is more important as the CPU handles most aspects of the game, not just the rendering of frames.  If you have a high-end GPU and a low-end CPU, your CPU will limit your framte rate, but the opposite is also true: a high-end CPU with a lown-end GPU would produce a poor framerate as well.

However, if it accepts your code then that would be a completely legal use of the software/license key.  One way you can check without having to wipe out your existing installation (if that's something you're concerned with) is to just insert the cd into your cd rom drive and choose the install/upgrade option from the cd.  It should ask for your key before restarting the computer to begin installation.|`|kCkm3Asraa	No you can't because the Windows XP disk is tagged to the code for that disk.

Your   body will end up being out of shape and you'll lose the energy   level that you currently have.

With a mind   that is focused, and with a positive belief system in place you   will improve the quality of your life and achieve your goals.

fQqAWGTgaa	Partitioning and formatting drives, copying files... these are basics. These are things that every geek should know... LONG before they think they are 1337 enough to run a dual boot system with a beta RC.  Not that this is all that advanced.    However... did you know there are a BUTTLOAD of free partitioning tools over at http://www.majorgeeks.com?    I'd use Partition Magic personally though.  But yeah... use a tool.  Use partitioning software.  Follow the directions in that piece of software to add a partition to an existing drive.    However, if you don't have at least 200gb unused on that drive... forget about making a 200gb partition without "deleating" any files (LOL).  I'm not sure why you believe you need 200gb to test install an OS though.... 50 should be more than enough for the OS and installed softwarre to check it out and such.|`|cJ4EGdwWaa	Partition magic is great for this.

Check inside of your PC and look at the slots that are empty,     PCI  PCI-e  PCI-E x16     are the most common, you can get a graphics card for your standards around 50-120$ for a cheap part in games.
AA11703028	hi mate                autorun issues are nothing new and was pretty common in windows xp,and not suprisingly its appeared in windows vista                however these problems are pretty easy to fix and the first solution would be to insert your disk,then go to "computer" and then right click the dvdrw with your game disk in and then select "autoplay"               in most cases this will autorun your disk and the games splash screen will appear,however in some rare cases this still wont autorun your dvdrw drive and disks                 you can then go to http://www.mydigitallife.info/2008/01/15... download a utility called "CleanHandlers" which can fix autorun problems in windows vista                  there is a specific utility from microsoft called "Autoplay Repair Wizard"( http://www.microsoft.com/Downloads/detai... however this only works with windows xp and 2000,and has not been tested or authorised for use in windows vista                  note: allthough autorun problems are largely system software issues its allways best to keep your dvdrw drives clean by running a disk cleaner through it each fortnight /month                 it takes around 2 minutes but can add a couple of years to the drives life ,also check your disks for dust before inserting them,you will be suprised how many pc,s i have fixed that were covered in dust from bad maintenence                  any problems let me know                            good luck mate !

The more capacity you install in a computer, the more room it has to store data.  As memory is faster than a hard drive, more essential data blocks can be stored in the memory as opposed to the computer having to go to the hard drive.<br>  <br>  Think of memory size in a computer as the size of your desk.  The more you can place on it, the more you have immediate access to with just the reach of your arm.  The hard drive is like the local library.  If your desk isn't large enough to hold the stuff you use the most and use repeatedly, you constantly have to drive yourself to the library to look it up, then bring it back.  This is called "swapping" or using your hard drive as virtual memory.|`|RE4AaDQBaa	Absolutely! If you make that much of a change, you will probably feel like you changed out the processor also.

Additionally, you should GET RID OF AOL. You don't need it, it's crap, and most of the rest of us refer to it as "A-O-Hell".   AOL is basically the lowest common denominator of ISP/Portals.

See what u think<br>  <br>  import java.util.Calendar;<br>  <br>  <br>  public class AlarmTime {<br>  <br>      AlarmTime() {<br>          time(4); // seconds, 3600 sec in hour<br>      }<br>  <br>      public static void main(String[] args) {<br>          new AlarmTime();<br>  <br>      }<br>  <br>      void time(int seconds) {<br>  <br>          Calendar c1 = Calendar.getInstance();<br>          long zeit = (c1.getTimeInMillis());<br>          long secInMillis = seconds * 1000;<br>          long zeit2 = zeit; // zeit is German for time<br>          try {<br>              while ((zeit + secInMillis) >= zeit2) {<br>                  Thread.sleep(1000);<br>                  System.out.println("second "+ seconds);<br>                  seconds--;<br>                  Calendar c2 = Calendar.getInstance();<br>                  zeit2 = c2.getTimeInMillis();<br>                  try {<br>                      if (seconds == 0) {<br>                          Thread.sleep(1000);<br>                          System.out.println("WAKE UP");<br>                      }<br>                  } catch (InterruptedException exception) {<br>                      System.out.println(" In Exeption");<br>                  }<br>              }<br>          } catch (InterruptedException exception) {<br>              System.out.println(" In Ex");<br>          }<br>      }<br>  }<br>  <br>  // edit------------------<br>  actually, lengthy discussions about why a Win Box won't precisely deliver milliSecs depending upon the CPU the reason why System.nanoTime() was added to java. Calendar.method is a number of type Long. That is how I see it. And Calendar has methods.<br>  <br>  System.currentTimeMillis() is the same as -- long x = 1; <br>  <br>  But, it takes a thread, if you want a unit of time. I've been down this road.|`|xWEYZWjZaa	Do not use Date. Use System.currentTimeMillis().<br>  Next , do not test for ==60 , test if time has expired.<br>  So:<br>  ...<br>  long endTime=System.currentTimeMillis () + 60 * 60 * 1000;<br>  while (!done){<br>    if (System.currentTimeMillis()>=endTime) {<br>      // this is reached when 60 minutes passes, do break;<br>   }<br>  }
dkpIjt5jaa	First get rid of the weird as this is probably Malware, deeply rooting itself in your system (some even hide in your router's firmware). Virus scanners and the Restore Point Utility are not good things to use against such invasion for this reason alone.    Get the programs I listed from another computer (Internet Caf, Public Library or friend's computer) onto a USB stick as Malware blocks you from downloading protection. A word of caution, be sure to read all programs help files completely before using them. If you still cannot use MBAM,  rename it Alteregobytes to confuse the Malware (but be sure to keep the .exe extension on it) and use it as alternative for part A of the following solution.     Trying MBAM alone is not enough as you need a COMPLETE solution, here is one (use programs in the order stated):     A) Download MBAM (MalwareBytes' Anti-Malware): http://www.download.com/Malwarebytes-Ant... - Install the application and make sure a checkmark is placed next to Update Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware and Launch Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware, then click Finish ( If an update is found, it will download and install the latest version ).    Once the program has loaded, select "Perform Quick Scan", then click Scan ( The scan may take some time,so please be patient ). When the scan is complete, click OK, then Show Results to view the results. Make sure that everything is checked, and click Remove Selected ( When disinfection is completed, a log will open in Notepad and you may be prompted to Restart ).      B) Try the tricks and free programs I use: 1) Flush accumulated junk in browsers. Browsers keep information about your activities and you should delete it.     Method One (now): In Internet Explorer (IE), click the Tools menu, then Delete Browsing History and in the box, click the Delete all button (bottom left) and Yes.  In Firefox (FF), go to tools, clear private data, make sure all boxes are checked and then click on the clear private data now button.    Method Two (Normal use: Every 14 days - Heavy use: Every 7 days): In IE, click the Tools menu, Delete Browsing History and in the box that opens, do these: a) click the button near Temporary Internet Files, click Yes and wait for the box that opens to close.   b) click the button near History, click Yes and wait for the box that opens to close and finally, click the close button (bottom right) to finish.    In FF, Go to tools, clear private data and uncheck all except Browsing History, Cache and Authenticated Sessions boxes then click on the clear private data now button.    Note: Close browser when done to clear cookies still in memory.  For other browsers or versions of the programs, check help files for guidance on doing cleanup.    2) Turn off the restore point utility ( Guide for XP: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310405 and Vista: http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows... )    3) Use this free cleaner: http://www.glaryutilities.com/gu.html to remove junk and remnants files.    4) put order in your HD with a "Disk defragmenter".    5) Turn restore point utility back on. (see part 2)    6) Do not use Google/Yahoo toolbars (spyware).    7) Persisting problem after this, get Avira: http://www.download.com/Avira-AntiVir-Pe... plus an Email scanner ( http://www.spamdel.com/ OR http://www.glenn.delahoy.com/software/fi... ) but get rid of AVG free (it is CRAP).    8) If the problem is very stubborn and you have a router, visit its web site and check for firmware that is more recent than your version. If FOUND, download and install, if NOT, use the router's reset switch, both methods return it to factory settings. "WARNING": Gather router install CDs, guides, passwords before doing this as you will need to do all connections again.      By doing so, you are on your way to being well protected BUT never relax your guard !|`|g4ubbgmqaa	Avira.com or a complete security suite free from Comodo.com the makers of Comodo firewall|`|bFi2UC07aa	you have to have the following installed on your computer to ensure it is safe.

Usually free stuff is the type of stuff you would regret.|`|4MYWPD9Yaa	Reinstall Windows and stop relying on "antivirus" software to protect your computer from malware infections.    Good security requires a multi-layered approach, and the least important layer by far is running some kind of anti-malware program (in fact, if you take care of all the other layers, you don't even need an anti-malware program using up extra resources).    In order of importance:    1. Create and use almost exclusively a limited user account instead of the default administrator account Windows sets you up with    2. Read up on social engineering and how to avoid it    3. Don't download illegal copies of software, music, or movies    4. Set Windows updates to install automatically    5. Make regular backups. If possible, back up your entire installation (using Norton Ghost or Acronis True Image)|`|UntSb3E9aa	norton antivirus 2009

They are one of the few manufacturers left who actual include those still. Find those disks and you will be set. Just boot up your computer with them in and it should just work for you.    If you cannot find your disks, your best hope is that there is a recovery drive on your computer. It will appear right next to your C drive in the my computer window. If you do not have one of those, you are pretty SOL.    Last best chance would be to call up Toshiba and hope they still have some recovery disks in their archive. If they do, they will charge you, but you will be able to restore your computer. If they don't, you are left with the last, and final option.    Go buy a new operating system. That is right, you will have to drop a couple hundred dollars and go out and purchase a new operating system to install on your computer.    Those are your options. I hope you find those disks.|`|jO3kC1jFaa	i have the e notebook its f10 but be sure to press it repeditally  rate me best please

4MYWPD9Yaa	Antivirus is a scam anyway.    Loads of Windows users (yes, right here on Yahoo! Answers) think if they run antivirus and antispyware and have a firewall that that means they're protected.    Then they run Windows as administrator (just about the dumbest thing you can do from a security standpoint), use a weak password (dictionary word), download pirated music / movies / software from Limewire, and open email attachments they weren't expecting.    Computer security is just like any security in life. You don't carry all your money in cash on you and give it to anyone (unless you're a philanthropist). You put it in the bank and pull it only when needed. You make sure a valet is actually a valet before handing your keys over to her. So why wouldn't you try to vet the trustworthiness of software you install? Why wouldn't you want to separate your personal data from your system files? Why wouldn't you make regular backups of your family photos?    Be smart. These antivirus companies may not be making viruses to sell their products, but they have certainly created the climate of fear that makes people think their products are actually worth running.|`|14d0ad3dfdb4dd36a9f896b96a702e69aa	In a perfect world this would of course never happen...but watch a news channel for 10 minutes and see the crazy greed; rampant over the world and it doesn't seem out of the realm of possibilities.|`|fB0gmEioaa	I doubt it they would all be sued if this were true.|`|8YVo2Wogaa	No. I think there are enough people making viruses and trojans and worms without the anti-virus companies needing to make their own.

Many companies do hire ex hackers to be security experts again though while possible unlikely.

75nbESJUaa	Oftentime it is because of an endless loop. And / or it can be fragmented memory. Fragmemory is code that should have been garbage collected and the memory reallocated for reuse.<br>  <br>  It has also been my experience if I had a weak power supply unit -- but that was the mouse cursor would just freeze. That was detective work: recalling I had added RAM and a hot video card, not to mention another PCI expansion card, plus I could not duplicate the non-response on another computer.<br>  <br>  If you haven't added hardware, and this is a packaged box software causing this, try running a memory test on RAM.

The easiest way would be to use a program that records what appears on your screen.  With programs such as this you can record everything that appears on you monitor, or just certain parts of you monitor.  The program is called ManyCam.  Install it, then open up the video you want and create a box in many cam over the little video box on that website and hit record on many cam then start playing the video on that site.  When the videos through playing stop manycam from recording and save your file in the highest resolution possible.  Done.  But pain in the butt.  It'll work.

School's are legally bound by the federal Children's Internet Protection Act to block proxies and the like.    Schools have to take this seriously to get certain technology funding.    All the proxies you try should be blocked by your school. That is because most schools use content blocking software. It blocks proxies 98% of the time because of their content (that they are a proxy), not because of the web address.  Also there are admins like me securing the system, adding any the system may miss (listed on proxy lists and even here) by adding them to the DNS blacklist.     You are very very unlikely to find one that works and even then it will only work for a short time until they know you are using it.

Macs can get viruses - there just aren't as many of them out there targeting macs are there are targeting PCs.    To answer your core question, the odds are that it was just a prank.  Modern hackers want access to your computer for economic gain.  That means they want to be able to continue to exploit their hack.  They are not going to tell you that they got in.    That said, there are still a few vandal-hackers out there who will advertise.  You should probably update your anti-virus definitions and run a full scan on your computer.  Run your anti-spyware scan too.  It will probably come back clean but it never hurts to check.    You should also go back to the question and report it as abuse.  That kind of behavior is inexcusable on Yahoo.

QZR6gl96aa	I don't know much about net beans but you only need the command prompt to compile and run java.    When you try to use the javac command if the command prompt says:  "'javac' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file."  then the command prompt does not know where javac.exe is.    To tell it where it is you can right-click on "my computer", click "properties", click "advanced", click "environment variables".    In "System Variables" click the variable "path" then click "edit".    If there is no ; at the end of the variable value add one. Then add the address of the folder that contains your javac.exe file. On my computer i added ";C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_11\bin" without the quotation marks.

fmT3ochSaa	With many routers when you click to save settings it actually restarts the router. This is why it goes to a blank page and while it is rebooting you can not get to the page. When  you press save settings I would recommend waiting for 3-5 minutes then try accessing the page. That should be plenty of time for the router to reboot.    If that isn't working I would think it is a hardware issue with the router and you may need to look at either a warranty or other replacement option.

XlyLakYAaa	The powerpoint probably opened up in Powerpoint VIEWER instead of the full version of Powerpoint (for some reason).  Open the full version of Powerpoint, then load the presentation you were working on.    On a side note, you did buy the full version of Office, right?  It's not the one that came pre-installed on the computer?  Because if it was pre-installed, that was only a trial and you'd need to buy the full version at the store.
kmjfyXHwaa	RAM stands for Random Access Memory.  They are Memory Modules that clip into slots on a computers motherboard.  They provide memory for your computer to run applications and processes.  they don't save data so when you close a program the process stops the memory gets dumped freeing space for new processes.  if you have too many programs running the memory may get full and your PC will slow down.  Most new PCs these days run anywhere fro 2 gigs to 4 gigs of RAM.

Reading a book will only confuse you.   .   1st thing if you have a computer you can go to control panel, from my computer. Then you click on getting started with windows under system and mainence then click on view computer details. And if you dont own a computer you can do this at any store before you buy the computer if its on. Check it, the high the number the better.    Ram also has speeds. So if you buy a computer that has like a 1.93 gb of ram, it going to be a hell of lot slower than a computer 2.2 gigs of ram. But on the details when they tell you about it, both may say 2 gigs of ram. You have to look deeper at clock speed. The higher the better. And most computers come now with a dual processor. dual core runs faster than core dou. Right now you can barely find a computer without 3 gigs in it. If it is, its on clearance.     As far as intel or anthlon (different companies who put their name on it) who really cares, ive heard different things about both of them. And if you are trying to replace ram. And if you dont know what you are doing, let somebody install it for. its a ripoff, but you can mess alot of crap up by playing Know it all and cheap *** on your computer.

dkpIjt5jaa	This is Malware, deeply rooting itself in your system (some even hide in your router's firmware). Virus scanners and the Restore Point Utility are not good things to use against such invasion for this reason alone.    Get the programs I listed from another computer (Internet Caf, Public Library or friend's computer) onto a USB stick as Malware blocks you from downloading protection. A word of caution, be sure to read all programs help files completely before using them. If you still cannot use MBAM,  rename it Alteregobytes to confuse the Malware (but be sure to keep the .exe extension on it) and use it as alternative for part A of the following solution.     Trying MBAM alone is not enough as you need a COMPLETE solution, here is one (use programs in the order stated):     A) Download MBAM (MalwareBytes' Anti-Malware): http://www.download.com/Malwarebytes-Ant... - Install the application and make sure a checkmark is placed next to Update Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware and Launch Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware, then click Finish ( If an update is found, it will download and install the latest version ).    Once the program has loaded, select "Perform Quick Scan", then click Scan ( The scan may take some time,so please be patient ). When the scan is complete, click OK, then Show Results to view the results. Make sure that everything is checked, and click Remove Selected ( When disinfection is completed, a log will open in Notepad and you may be prompted to Restart ).      B) Try the tricks and free programs I use: 1) Flush accumulated junk in browsers. Browsers keep information about your activities and you should delete it.     Method One (now): In Internet Explorer (IE), click the Tools menu, then Delete Browsing History and in the box, click the Delete all button (bottom left) and Yes.  In Firefox (FF), go to tools, clear private data, make sure all boxes are checked and then click on the clear private data now button.    Method Two (Normal use: Every 14 days - Heavy use: Every 7 days): In IE, click the Tools menu, Delete Browsing History and in the box that opens, do these: a) click the button near Temporary Internet Files, click Yes and wait for the box that opens to close.   b) click the button near History, click Yes and wait for the box that opens to close and finally, click the close button (bottom right) to finish.    In FF, Go to tools, clear private data and uncheck all except Browsing History, Cache and Authenticated Sessions boxes then click on the clear private data now button.    Note: Close browser when done to clear cookies still in memory.  For other browsers or versions of the programs, check help files for guidance on doing cleanup.    2) Turn off the restore point utility ( Guide for XP: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310405 and Vista: http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows... )    3) Use this free cleaner: http://www.glaryutilities.com/gu.html to remove junk and remnants files.    4) put order in your HD with a "Disk defragmenter".    5) Turn restore point utility back on. (see part 2)    6) Do not use Google/Yahoo toolbars (spyware).    7) Persisting problem after this, get Avira: http://www.download.com/Avira-AntiVir-Pe... plus an Email scanner ( http://www.spamdel.com/ OR http://www.glenn.delahoy.com/software/fi... ).  Already have a scanner, make sure your virus database is updated BUT stay away from (or get rid of) AVG free (CRAP).    8) If the problem is very stubborn and you have a router, visit its web site and check for firmware that is more recent than your version. If FOUND, download and install, if NOT, use the router's reset switch, both methods return it to factory settings. "WARNING": Gather router install CDs, guides, passwords before doing this as you will need to do all connections again.

If thats too much for you, ground yourself, and staying grounded blow the dust off the electronics and wipe it up from the case with a damp rag or whatever.     How much time you should spend cleaning your case depends on how bad you want to avoid buying new parts and how dirty it actually is in there.

If you can, swap the video cards with another machine with AGP 8x video and see if the problem continues on either machine.

Anova is part of the VBA Analysis Toolpak, which is written in VBA. But Microsoft removed VBA from Mac Excel 2008, so the VBA Analysis Toolpak won't run in it.    Microsoft's perfectly ridiculous official solution is to run ANOVA in Mac Excel 2004, then when done, save the workbook and open it in Mac Excel 2008.    On the bright side, Microsoft has announced that the next version of Mac Excel will once again have VBA. I don't know when that version will be released, though.      To try to do ANOVA on Mac without buying Mac Excel 2004 or paying for anything else, I would suggest looking at Macropod Software's KoalaCalc 4.3.1. It says it does ANOVA, and it is freeware:    http://www.macropodsoftware.com/koalacal...    However, I personally don't know anything about ANOVA, so I don't really know that KoalaCalc's ANOVA will help you.      Good luck!    Greg

hyzP0uJWaa	You can start making your Web pages without a Web host, or Dreamweaver for that matter--Dreamweaver just makes it ALOT easier. This means creating Web pages cost nothing!    You only need a Web host when you are ready for the world to view your Web pages. But you have to create them first!    To create Web pages, you need to know the language of the Web: XHTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc. And that cost nothing. You can create a Web page in as little as two seconds at no cost in Notepad. And the best part is, knowing XHTML gives you full creative freedom over designing your web page: You aren't stuck with the limitations of a template. Besides, you still need to know XHTML even for Dreamweaver CS3 so you won't get lost if you ever need to edit your code directly.    For now, get an XHTML document started. Open up Notepad, Word, or Dreamweaver CS3. Paste this into a blank document :              Untitled Document              All of the content you want viewed must be placed within the body element of the document; meaning, between the  and tags.

Here is a whole list of block level elements you can create:  http://www.missingmethods.com/Programing...    And a whole list of inline elements you can create:  http://www.missingmethods.com/Programing...    After you've created your first web page (XHTML document), you'll want to preview it in a web browser (Firefox or Internet Explorer).    To do this, save the XHTML document under "My Documents" in a folder called firstWebSite.    Name the XHTML document firstPage.html (or name it anything you want with the .html attached to the end).    Go to your browser menu and choose File > Open and find firstPage.html.    (These steps are animated here:http://startwebdev.com/webdevX/XHTML/XHT...    If you want the world to view your web pages, you'll need to get a web host.

I would recommend you use Access.  Depending on how many records you may eventually get to some problems with limitation of Access.      You may need a local developer/software company that can help create this for you.  You'll need someone to do all the data entry as well.  Don't forget you have to take into concerns about Privacy information.  Storing it electronically will open concerns and potential legal issues - especially if your database is stolen.|`|56Bg4GKKaa	You could use Python or Visual Basic. Either way you probably have no chance of making the program.|`|9eUeQid9aa	try using visual basic 6.0 portable its very good when you know how to use it|`|BPrZm0Tfaa	I definitely recommend using Access.    If the capabilities in Access as far as data entry and querying isn't capable enough, I then recommend making use of Visual Basic .NET  Express 2008 with an Access database as the backend.    If you need some more database functionality, you can even use SQL Server Express 2008 as the database backend.    All these products (except Access which you have to pay for) can be downloaded from Microsoft for free at http://www.microsoft.com/express    They also have some great tutorials out there to get you started.

Then use OnClientClick events with ASP.Net controls to update that variable anytime a control is used (activity) by changing it to the current time + 5 minutes again (resetting the page's expiration).|`|cd01db4a2dd21c9e7bddba53c7ba97f6aa	You can use a session and a database to store the data.

WS95be3Raa	const before the function is part of the return type.    const after the function means that it will not change the object that it operates on.    Let's say we have a constant object of type Cat.    const Cat c;    Cat has 2 methods - grow() and getName().    grow() changes the attributes of the object (like size). getName() just returns the name of the cat.    How can compiler know which methods are valid to be called by a constant object? You have to tell it.    Because grow() changes the object, it is not const and cannot be declared to be that (compile-time error).    getName() doesn't change anything, so you have to declare it to be const.    Now, if you try to call grow on a const object, you will get a compile-time error. You can call getName() without any problems.    Of course, you might forget to declare getName() as const. Compiler will not complain. However, if you try to call that method by a constant object (which should seem to be a valid thing to do), compiler will give you an error. Always declare your functions to be const, unless you're changing the object!|`|AA11113174	I think this means a constant will be returned.  const int value()     and this means the function will change no values in the object  int value() const

WQC1EDGdaa	With the advent of internet and wireless technologies, real-time remote monitoring and control is becoming an essential need for meeting highly dynamic business objectives. At the same time, web-enabled platforms are required to perform remote monitoring with efficiently and effectively. Recent progresses on e-manufacturing applications address the needs for better integration between factory floor and enterprise systems. This paper presents a web-enabled platform which focuses on web-enabled intelligence to enable products and systems to achieve near-zero-downtime performance through device-to-business (D2B) platform. The proposed web-enabled platform can effectively minimize the massive information bottleneck that exists between plant floor and information systems. Case studies are presented to determine how effectively web-enabled industrial system can be used in factory floor as well as business decision-making. Manufacturers and users will benefit from the increased equipment and process performance with the effective implementation of the developed web-enable platform.|`|67bbf6d48ed9c198da5c65a9e28ee6ebaa	Do your home work yourself....|`|jrMUfeQqaa	U should do ur university work urself|`|hwiu7TCYaa	Thats not very specific, the title of your question itself dosn't even make any sense.

99d982daf0c2b0d82a4675478155a500aa	If you want a domain name to point to a website on your computer then you will need:  1) A Web Server  2) A domain name (which costs).  Without a domain name the website can be accessed directly by the IP address of your laptop.    You would have to register the domain name and have it point to your laptop for the DNS.    Somethings to consider:  1) Your laptop will have to be always on for the site to be available  2) You have to know how to secure your laptop so that your system won't be vulnerable (after all you are now allowing the world access to it)  3) You need to be able to configure your web server.  4) The speed and availability of the site will be dependent upon your internet connection.  While it may be small your ISP has to know you are doing this and many ISPs have their contracts written so that it violates their terms if you do this.  5) You can get a domain (www.godaddy.com) and a reliable webhost (www.livin4.com) for less than $20/yr and all the aforementioned issues will be handled by them.

If your provider blocks port 80 (the http port), you'll have to put the server on another port - 81 or 8000 or 8080 or ...) and use port redirection so that people don't have to type in http://yourname.com:8000/ to get to the server.    Whichever port you use, if you use a router, or your modem does address translation, you'll have to forward that port to the server.    (As far as securing your computer, you can pick up a cheap used computer for $100 or so.  You could even run Linux from a CD on it, so the only thing people could hack was the site itself [and if that's backed up, it's a couple of minutes to restore the last backup].)

Such as the registry is not as complicated, and they use a better means of organization than windows does. But, windows is used for people who need to test out applciations, programs, ext. that apple does not use. <br>  <br>  Macs are for students because they rarely get viruses, they don't allow backdoor entrances to their information for hackers and various other things. They also make it so all your music/photos/videos/are all stored in a different location than your documents. Applications are then stored somewhere else for easy access. <br>  <br>  Windows is mainly for a cheap computer, a designer, or a person who doesn't care and just wants to surf the web.

14d0ad3dfdb4dd36a9f896b96a702e69aa	This is actually a browser issue, not avira...  You could try a couple of things:  Strange as it sounds, your systems' time must be synchronized to the actual time.  (Your old, outdated cert's don't match the current cert's).  Right click the system tray time clock> Adjust time & Date> Internet time> Update now. (Make sure your system is set to 'Automatic Synchronize...' while you're here)    Another possible fix:  With Internet Explorer, go to Microsoft Updates, then select the 'Custom' button (not the 'Express').  That will tell you all specific updates for your computer (hardware & software) and in this case the certificate updates.    Note that some Certificates having MD-5 'hash' authentication method, may have been hacked, so it's important to have your system's time & root certificates up-to-date, otherwise a 'Cross Site Request Forgery' hack is possible.  Use Firefox, with this add on to notify you when any site uses this broken certificate:    http://codefromthe70s.org/sslblacklist.a...

qxR6BysNaa	Not exactly, but close enough.    If a system requirements page lists single-core requirements for a game and you have a dual-core processor that is at least half as fast, you should be able to run it fine.  This is not always true, but especially for newer titles that are optimized for multiple cores, it should be sufficient to say it's "about the same".    ---------------------------------    Update:    That requirement for the BluRay drive is for video decoding, which is a highly parallel process.  All other factors the same, a CPU with more cores at a lower clock frequency should outperform a single-core CPU with a higher clock frequency during video encoding/decoding.  You will be just fine with that CPU.|`|fCOq04lNaa	Yes if the game is multithreaded(can use two or more cores), otherwise no. You have 2 2.6GHz cores and you can't just add them up into a 5.2GHz processor.    The 3.2Ghz probably refers to a Pentium 4(usually does) But you should be able to run the game depending on your processor. If you have a Core 2 or Athlon X2 then you're fine as they can easily beat a Pentium 4 clock to clock because of higher instructions per cycle. If you have a Pentium D then maybe not. Still check out the System Requirement lab.  http://www.systemrequirementslab.com/ref...|`|DSOJvIhtaa	No sorry, if it were we'd be paying much much more $$ for them. Dual core processors big attraction is their ability to run mutliple tasks/programs. So when you have 3 different instant messengers, email, web browsing, and spreadsheets open for work, it can handle those programs 'better' than a single processor that has to prioritize between the different programs.|`|WQYnjPqgaa	Of course it would, if anything it'd be better because it can run 2x as many threads as a normal processor. The main reason processor manufacturers moved from big single to smaller dual core anyway is more for power efficiency really. The software should run alright as long as you don't whack the processor-hungry bits up as its quite a way off the minimum and a game I have that says 450MHz minimum runs sort of on 368.|`|v4FZs5WIaa	first of all, there is no such thing as a 5.2 GHZ single core processor,   single core processors are now obsolete (by intel)  and therefore the highest speed single core processor was a 3.8GHZ and that was the Pentium 4    your best bet would be a duo core or a quad core|`|4YmB7q5jaa	there is no such thing as a 5.2 GHZ single core processor

waDKbT61aa	I googled and there seemed to be a lot of different options which you could go for.    http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&cli...    You could probably get a few free trials or maybe even find some freeware which would help you get started.    As for Tutorials, again, Google is your friend and so is Youtube.    Good Luck.
3zGxlguhaa	It depends on what you plan on using it for. If you just plan on using it to save music/pictures, it should be sufficient. If you plan on storing massive amounts of videos, then you might run into a problem.|`|bxlYleZkaa	Depens what you want to do. For wordprocesing it would be great. for flight sim or similar it would be adequate.|`|YVE64dJUaa	For general use its plenty of storage    But if you play a lot of the latest games that require a large amount of storage space then your hard drive will soon become full same goes for if you plan on storing a lot of music and video content    If you plan on having a large amount of these types of files then consider a second hard drive    I have a laptop with 200GB Hard drive (biggest available at the time) and now have an external hard drive that is 750GB bought from a Tesco store near to me for just under 80 so i have nearly 1TB (1000GB) of storage, although it is near 900GB when you factor in space for vista and formatting    I rememer when 4GB was considered HUGE and floppy disks were the norm for transporting data before CDs and USB flash drives came along LOL XD|`|48e9baf113e4951f779199c900a19f63aa	Hard drives are funny. Bigger sizes are super expensive when they come out, then they drop in price severely shortly after. It's almost cheaper right now to buy a 500GB hard drive as many online stores put them on sale (TB hds are the thing now). Check out newegg.com, that may be a good choice for you.  I dunno. Our comps at work have 150gb hds... but they're also like 3 years old.|`|1y1c5QWHaa	A 160GB hard drive should work great; unless you plan on storing HUGE amounts of data.    -??T? ???? ???T? ???!!!
BpUTyfDxaa	If you have an ISR(Integrated Service Router) you can. There should be a couple ethernet ports on the router. All you need is an ethernet cable.|`|cBT6Qrbhaa	No you cannot hook it directly to your pc unless you have 2 nic cards. 1 for internet and 1 for xbox live.  Your best bet is to get a switch or router and connect the xbox to the switch/router, your xbox will then be on the same network and can communicate with your pc.|`|d7yPFYG3aa	yes u can
NFuRjsQjaa	Go to my computer, go to the hard drive and right click. Select properties. There is a button that says disk clean up. Try it and see if that works for you.|`|CL45UJrYaa	Its actually storage not memory, memory refers to RAM. Looks like you are going to need to delete some big files or uninstall programs that take up alot of storage. Or you could invest in an external hard drive for more storage so you can keep all your files|`|rZfI9KZDaa	you can got to best buy or sumthing and buy memory for your computer
uuDloQnCaa	How to remove Fake Software, Pop-Ups, Spyware, Trojans and Viruses:    Download, install, update and scan your computer with both Malwarebytes and SuperantiSpyware, delete what ever they find, if this fails to completely remove the virus/spyware download then update Avast and run a boot scan (click schedule boot-time scan and restart your PC), all the software below is free and safe to use.    Malwarebytes: http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php    SuperantiSpyware: http://www.superantispyware.com/    Avast Anti-Virus: http://www.avast.com/eng/avast_4_home.ht...    To protect your PC in the future you'll need to install anti-virus software and a firewall, id recommend using Avast and Comodo Pro firewall both are very effective and completely free, you should also switch to Firefox 3 if you are browsing with IE as its much safer and a lot easier to use. (links on my profile)|`|7SJ3cY48aa	I would recommend AVG.  http://free.avg.com/    Also if your computer is running slow not because of the virus then I would recommend CCleaner.   http://www.ccleaner.com/download    Good Luck :)|`|XVpq4tOQaa	There is no Free Antivirus that can clean it completely up, if you already have that many viruses and you dont want to pay for anything, you should reformat your computer and clean it out and buy some antivirus to prevent the problems.|`|em62J0Zzaa	I have used  different ones with success.  AVG http://free.avg.com/download-avg-anti-vi...  Avast http://www.avast.com/eng/avast_4_home.ht...  The basic one for personal use is free.|`|1dGG9POgaa	Nothing.... Nothing is good that is free. period.|`|2cbe438831626a8578cce99607331d2aaa	i would have to recommend spyware terminator, for the virus, and its most likely that the virus is not causing the computer to slow down, so i also suggest using advanced windows care home edition
HBAMQJPLaa	Strange.  I activated mine 30 or more times over a few years. and not once was it refused.    Are you activating it on the same computer it came on or was first installed on?  If not that is the problem.|`|7cUDstdjaa	Go online to Microsoft and search for online help and you can either email or open a live chat
RWnsxyVOaa	The 9800 GT is a better card than a Radeon HD 2600 by a significant margin.|`|a2B4xP8Oaa	The 2600 is pretty low tech but the 9800 is really good.|`|hUUWlLeBaa	the 9800 is the better card but for what you are going to spend on it you can get a decent 4850...    http://www.newegg.com/Product/ProductLis...
ld5J5zO7aa	Usually the screen make/model will be on a sticker on the backside of the monitor.  It should also include a serial number and if it's a Dell, a Service Tag Number.
PPIcNdAfaa	Simple.    When you receive a computer virus, the virus will alter Windows, making something "not work right". When your body is encountered with a foreign material not meant to be there, it can cause your body, and your brain, to stop responded correctly.    Example: A virus from porn can crash your copy of windows, just like how inhalants can kill your brain cells.|`|BsKMjal8aa	who said that human brains are like the computers we use today?    computers  can do the things that we can do, only it does very fast.    computers follow a set of given instructions corresponding to different conditions and gives the output    and all these set of instructions arre given by human( programmer)        VIRUSES changes these codes in un usual way and causes error
a4c3cef99f4c9797cc2ecd10fb33384baa	As you probably know, you can add a movie clip to the over, up and click instances of a button.  This means that you can add animation to the movie clip, and it will only play in the instance that you set it in.    As for putting it in your site, just add the  html code, make sure to leave enough space for it, and you're set.  Feel free to email me if this isn't good enough, as I happen to be quite experienced in this field.
8Yd3UO0Baa	Maybe because every type of computer malware is often referred to as a 'virus' when a virus is actually a specific type of malware, not that common these days, even on Windows pc's. So, people think that if they have an av program that's all they need when the reality is that other forms of malware are more common and more dangerous. Most av programs now aim to protect against malware in general but even the 'best' - whatever program that may be - can't be relied upon to detect 100% of malware. In particular, AntiVir free and AVG free are a bit lacking in spyware protection.    Generally, av programs (and anti-spyware programs) rely upon malware signatures (or definitions), issued *after* the malware has been released. If people don't have the latest signatures / definitions, they're vulnerable. Many people don't keep their av up-to-date.     Also, most malware now gets on via vulnerabilities in third-party programs such as Apple QuickTime, Adobe Flash player, etc, and the av programs don't *always* detect this. So *all* programs have to be kept up-to-date with the latest security patches. Use Secunia PSI ;)    Because av programs rely upon virus definitions released after the new virus has been released, there's always people who get caught by 'zero-day' attacks, i.e. they are the first to get the malware, ahead of the av companies releasing an update for it. Some av programs use heuristics to watch for suspicious behaviour but this isn't 100% foolproof.    For the reason above, some people don't use av programs but use HIPS programs instead. In theory, these are much more secure but in practice they still aren't 100% guaranteed to stop infections and, for most people, aren't as easy to use as traditional av programs. However, experienced users who use a HIPS program probably won't be on Yahoo Answers asking for help, they'll know what to do ;)    Don't think that, because you have an av program, you're safe.  Don't think that, because you own a Mac, you're safe.  You ain't.|`|sG7E4vDgaa	Antivirus programs don't catch everything.  There is always an index case for a new virus.|`|7U9UAtTSaa	Because they are dumbos|`|TLTgTaucaa	It's a mystery|`|42ed0b617069464e77343114e09c7994aa	It's not that simple, they might have but the software they using might be crap or they are visiting bad porn sites.|`|AA11324576	i use mcafee. its a real drag waiting 30 minutes for it to finish its daily update. i'd sooner get my bank details swiped than wait 30 mins every day|`|1dGG9POgaa	Because they are not that smart. They think they wont assaulted by a virus or a hacker. But the the truth is, everything you do can have a small or big virus on it pretty much. if you don't have protection you will also be hacked on average of 50 times a night. People need norton.|`|aeBHwIC8aa	people just cant be asked to buy 1 if they cant buy 1 they probably dont know they have 1 already|`|b6Ms8bMhaa	Most of them probably do but forget to update their software on a regular basis. Software that is not routinely updated will not stop new forms of malicious software and anti-virus programs cannot detect viruses they are not familiar with.|`|de0sc3GTaa	I know some people who do not have an anti-virus installed in their computers, but these computers are not connected to Internet.    Having an anti-virus is a must indeed, but more importantly is to make sure it is up to date, cause any anti-virus program being out of date is rather useless.    It is also important that this program has a built in spyware/malware scanner, otherwise it's also a must to have one installed and kept up to date.    One other useful program to have is an backup archive image creating software like Norton Ghost or Acronis True image, this lets you create an image archive of your computer data, so in case something goes wrong, you can restore your computer to the initial state it was when you created the archive.    Much more efficient than the system restore function built in Win XP and Vista, cause these can also get infected with viruses, so you end up restoring the viruses over and over.

lFMRLQa7aa	thats just how it is a 5gb usb only rly are about 3.7 its how its made it cant be more exat to 1gb and not go over so they rather keep em smaller then bigger then 1gb|`|ZPBPwEQBaa	that is just haw it is some space is reserved for the system and there is no way around it.|`|J4v5xNg2aa	It's formatting. The manufacturer uses some of the device's own memory for formatting reasons, how it holds and organizes files. Everything does this, usb memory stick to mp3 players. Everything has to be formatted, therefore some memory is lost.
2KfQYXaiaa	989 MB is very small for most distros.  However DSL (Damn Small Linux) should install fine.  However I would not recommend DSL for a beginner.|`|1NBe2Jo7aa	No, I think that you need at least a 3gb partition, and even with this, it won't run very well. I run opensuse on a 6gb partition, and it isn't too fast. Also, I think that ubuntu requires more space.

And its free. http://neosmart.net/dl.php?id=1    EasyBCD uses the Vista bootloader (BCD) and allows you to add custom boot entries. At one point I had Vista SP1, Windows 7, Mac OS X hackintosh, and Ubuntu all on the same system, EasyBCD made it rather easy to setup. Everything you need to know should be fairly easy to find in the Neosmart  forums. Good luck!|`|7bf62358ee706efffb78c25a9c7d5a00aa	Don't feel bad - it's so common that someone wrote it up:    http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t...

vOMuBuw4aa	They have to be .avi format.  See if you can get a converter|`|3LHsCLVFaa	The files being imported to MM must be avi or wmv. Files going to youtube must be in the form youtube accepts. The files from mm must be published or all you have is a project. All this info is on the youtube site and in the youtube forums|`|Dc8ZVP6yaa	Ok.   First off windows movie maker will not import quicktime files.   It will need to be avi. or wmv. before you can put it on windows movie maker.   You could also consider converting the files using a video convertor. search "free video convertor"  on google.  Now once your .avi or .wav is on windows movie maker. just click on "save to my computer"   wait for it to process then upload it to youtube.|`|30GBdziuaa	for the second question, you have to save it to your computer first.|`|l01yTPHWaa	It might be the wrong file.
AA10586732	there are sites like megavideo.com that give you site points and start paying you when you have an incredible amount of points...but there are no sites that just start paying you off the bat.
XPJGzzx0aa	As correctly stated by others, it is two cores each running at 2GHz.  If the software was written specifically to take advantage of multi-core processors, then you might see speeds comparable with a 4GHz processor, but almost no software can yet achieve this, so your dual core 2GHz processor is not in real terms as fast as a single core 4GHz processor.    As multi-core processors become the norm, more software will take advantage of them and speeds will increase accordingly.|`|mQ7ZAFd6aa	no it means you have 2 processors that run at 2GHZ. so when one is busy doing something on your computer the other can kick in to help it out or work on something else all together.|`|ZPBPwEQBaa	its complicated i would add them up and cut it in a 25%. i have a q6600 and i checked my system requirements here  http://www.systemrequirementslab.com/ref...  and it said that it ran at 4.68ghz. its like sli you wont get a 100% jump you will get about 80% or so.|`|3LHsCLVFaa	Nope it is 2 pipes at 2 gig|`|CL45UJrYaa	It means a total of 4 GHz|`|PPIcNdAfaa	It means you have two cores which can run at 2GHz each. It's not nessicarily as powerful as 4GHz becuase two cores cannot handle a program "together". Don't get me wrong, that's a very powerful processor.|`|wC7QqFDlaa	it means when u use a software if the software designed to work with 1 CPU then u use 2.0 and if ur software(game anything) desinged more CPU then that will use ur second Core then thats sth like 4GHz then  1 more thing 1 core 2 due 2.0GHz is better than 1* 4Ghz

Also, Gaming on a mac isn't easy.|`|7ysfW2XOaa	oh this isn't a gaming computer at all. most laptops in the 700$ range will top this desktop. 1 gigabyte of ram is barely enough to run vista. 2.1GHZ is too little of a clock speed, and the X1600 came out like 6 or 7 years ago. It is outdated. I would recomend you find somthing else, or even better build your own.|`|3zLRA1JBaa	Hi Jessica,    depends on the game you want to play.  That gfx card is OLD, and the ram is very low.  This wouldn't be good for anything hardcore at all.  Look at the review of it from 2006 (A dogs age).  What is your budget?
FKzZTtw2aa	its safe. the location is for tax. the phone, is to verify correct address, they wont call you. and you can redeem more cards as you need more money for downloads.|`|8vWwX8SXaa	Unless you have spyware (such as a keylogger which other ppl can see) on your comp, this is prettyy safe, trust itunes...

Then dont forget to keep your system clean.. dont install a bunch of programs..|`|wiJz0FYLaa	Both good hardware and software and software are equally important as one is useless without the other. Eg. even the most powerful video card in the world is useless if the driver support for it is poor.    Lots of RAM, a fast CPU, fast hard drive are all necessary. It's also important to keep the hard drive well defragmented so that it does not become a performance bottleneck. Something like Diskeeper 2009 ( http://www.diskeeper.com ) will help to keep it in peak condition. Remember, the hard drive is already many orders of magnitude slower than the CPU and RAM, so any further slowdown due to fragmentation is bad.    Virus scans are necessary but need to be done only maybe once a week as long as you have good real-time protection from an anti-virus utility.    Good drivers are another very important aspect of performance. Driver improvement for the video card can net 5-10% performance gains sometimes.|`|pUUyYz4gaa	In this order with Winidows....

46OYLEXWaa	anything that is fun...especially video with some comedy.  Comedy clips always get high views.    or anything you like doing.. e.g. funny slideshow showing really funny pictures of like Jim Carrey,  making cute and funny animals slides, etc...    also...    --for best editing....    use windows movie maker (included in your windows machine)... it can help you make beautiful slideshow or video clip(e.g. mixing your songs with pictures/video/lyric/etc).... then save it as video file such as wmv file format... finally upload.    or .. Just get those clips you want , save & convert them, and then mix/match with pix/sound/etc using windows movie maker to create new masterpieces....    this will help you.... Use 'zillatube'. This is the easiest (and also the fastest) way.    Zillatube produces mpg/mp3 formats from youtube that are compatible with windows movie maker(or media player), and more.    It is very easy to download and convert videos. Then edit those converted mp3/mpg videos with windows movie maker... save your file as wmv and then upload.

17EV9uuLaa	The Public folder is a convenient way to share files that are stored on your computer. You can share files in this folder with other people using the same computer and with people using other computers on the same network. Any file or folder you put in the Public folder is automatically shared with the people who have access to your Public folder. You can also share files by sharing them directly from any folder on your computer without copying or moving them to the Public folder. This method gives you more control over who you share files with on your network. It allows you to select people on an individual basis and set the level of sharing permissions for each person.The Public folder contains no files until you or other people using your computer add files to it.
Y7jhIybzaa	I've always liked the Scanner api for this. You could try something along the lines of    File file = new File(pathOnLocalDisk);  Scanner scanner = new Scanner(file);    then you can try something like   String lineOne, lineTwo, lineThreel  if(scanner.hasNext())  lineOne = scanner.nextLine()    if(scanner.hasNext())  lineTwo = scanner.nextLine()    if(scanner.hasNext())  lineThree = scanner.nextLine()    OR    String [] strings = new String[];  int count=0;  while(scanner.hasNext()){  strings[count] = scanner.next();  count++;  }    I have provided the links to the File and Scanner API below    Edit: changed next() to nextLine(), if you are interested in using something other than a line break as your delimeter between the interest rates you can look into the useDelimiter(Pattern pattern) method on Scanner    2nd Question:  If you mean get that particular line of the file I suggest reading the file once at the beginning of the program as file I/O is fairly slow. Store all of the lines of the file in a global array or List of Strings in the class and when you want to access line x you could have a method somewhat along the lines of    public List fileInputList;    public String getInputLine(int lineNumber){  if(fileInputList == null){      rereadFile();  }  if(lineNumber >= fileInputList.size())  return "";    return fileInputList.get(lineNumber);  }|`|FbjRnvdAaa	i am assuming each line of your text file has only one floating point number( interest rate usually are not whole numbers ).     so just give the ( zero-indexed) line you want to the following function and get back the float you need.    don't forget to change the text file name to what you have and also to import the following :  import java.io.*;  import java.util.Scanner;    feel free to add as much as error checking code you want to this, if you need to.    public float getInterestRateFromLine(int line)  {    File file = new File("data.txt");    String lineStr="";       try {           Scanner sc = new Scanner(file);           for ( int i = 0; i            {           lineStr = sc.nextLine();            }              } catch (FileNotFoundException e) {           e.printStackTrace();       }       return Float.parseFloat(lineStr);  }

aqJhF71Raa	There is a way to do it in internet explorer, but it will not work in Firefox. I am not sure if there is an equivalent solution in FF.    You can use CSS to change the writing mode and orientation of the text.       verticaltext {  writing-mode: tb-rl;  filter: flipv fliph;  }      To use this in a div, you would have:  Your Vertical Text    This changes the writing mode to be top to bottom, right to left. This means text will be written from the top to the bottom. New lines will go from right to left. Then a filter is applied to flip the text horizontally and vertically to achieve the look you want.    If you remove the filter, then your text will be on the far right of the screen but still vertical (and facing the other way).

Mainframes have proprietary OSes with good and bad points; Multics particularly comes to mind, but in a neutral way (it was the superior ancestor of UNIX).  I can't say that there's any OS that I hated.    Some of the just-barely operating systems of early microcomputers were frustrating, especially after having used real operating systems on larger computers.  CP/M comes to mind.  In contrast, some time-sharing systems were very cool, like RSTS/E and the aforementioned Multics.    Mac operating systems are friendly but opaque.

Malwarebytes: http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php    SuperantiSpyware: http://www.superantispyware.com/    Avast Anti-Virus: http://www.avast.com/eng/avast_4_home.ht...    To protect your PC in the future you'll need to install anti-virus software and a firewall, id recommend using Avast and Comodo Pro firewall both are very effective and completely free, you should also switch to Firefox 3 if you are browsing with IE as its much safer and a lot easier to use. (links on my profile)|`|dkpIjt5jaa	This is Malware, stuff that hides well, deeply rooting itself in your system. Anti-virus scanners and the Restore Point Utility are not a good thing to use against such invasion for this reason.    Download the programs I listed from another computer (Internet Caf, Public Library or friend's computer) onto a USB stick as this malware may block you from downloading the protection. If you still cannot use MBAM,  rename it Alteregobytes to confuse the Malware (but be sure to keep the .exe extension on it) and use it as an alternative for solution A.      Here are solutions (use them in the order stated): A) Download MBAM (MalwareBytes' Anti-Malware): http://www.download.com/Malwarebytes-Ant... - Install the application and make sure a checkmark is placed next to Update Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware and Launch Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware, then click Finish ( If an update is found, it will download and install the latest version ).    Once the program has loaded, select "Perform Quick Scan", then click Scan ( The scan may take some time,so please be patient ). When the scan is complete, click OK, then Show Results to view the results.    Make sure that everything is checked, and click Remove Selected ( When disinfection is completed, a log will open in Notepad and you may be prompted to Restart - The log is automatically saved and can be viewed by clicking the Logs tab in MBAM ).    B) Try the tricks and free programs I use: 1) Flush every single possible accumulated junk in ALL browsers. As you explore the web, browsers stores information about your browsing. You should delete that information from time to time.     Method One (now):   In Internet Explorer, click the Tools menu, then Delete Browsing History and in the box, click the Delete all button (bottom left) and Yes.  In Firefox, go to tools, clear private data, make sure all boxes are checked and then click on the clear private data now button.    Method Two (in the future - about every two weeks for normal use of the internet - every week for heavy use):    In Internet Explorer, click the Tools menu, then click Delete Browsing History and in the box that opens, do the following steps (in order)  a) click the button near Temporary Internet Files, click Yes and wait for the box that opens to close.  b) click the button near History, click Yes and wait for the box that opens to close.  Finally, click the close button (bottom right) to finish.    In Firefox, Go to tools, clear private data and uncheck all except Browsing History, Cache and Authenticated Sessions boxes and then click on the clear private data now button.      Note: You should close your browser when you're done to clear cookies that are still in memory.  For older versions of the programs or for other browsers, check help files for guidance on doing the cleanup.    2) Turn off the restore point utility ( here is a guide for XP: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310405 and an article for Vista: http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows... )    3) Install this free cleaner: http://www.glaryutilities.com/gu.html to remove junk and remnants files (there are always some) and use it in "Windows safe mode" (for a better cleanup).    4) put order in your drive with a "Disk defragmenter".    5) Turn restore point utility back on. ( see part 3 )    6) After this, if you don't have an anti-virus scanner, use Avira: http://www.download.com/Avira-AntiVir-Pe... along with an Email scanner ( http://www.spamdel.com/ OR http://www.glenn.delahoy.com/software/fi... ) and if you have a GOOD one, make sure your virus database is updated.    ( A word of caution, be sure to read all help files completely so that you can apply fixes right the first time ! )    With this, you are on your way to being well protected BUT never relax your guard !    P.S.: Stay away from AVG free and Google/Yahoo toolbars (spyware themselves)|`|mQ7ZAFd6aa	boot to safe mode and install malware byte. it's a free malware program that will get rid of that.    then run your antivirus.    then if your antivirus has the ability run a boot time scan which will scan the computer before it loads windows which keeps windows from blocking the antivirus.

I have been in the Computer business for several years and I recommend a "suite " of programs to keep your computer Virus, Ad-ware, and Spy-ware free along with fully optimized.  First, I recommend AVG Anti-virus.  AVG is made by AVG Technologies (formerly Grisoft) and is a great product.  It automates a lot for the functions other products make you perform manually.  Next, is Spybot Search and destroy which can detect and remove a multitude of spy-ware files and modules from your computer. Spybot also can clean program and Web-usage tracks from your system, which is especially useful if you share your computer.  AD Aware is the third program that I recommend to get rid of pop up Ads and programs like you are experiencing now.  And finally, I recommend Advanced Systemcare to help maintain everything else.  Advanced SystemCare Free is a comprehensive PC care utility that takes a one-click approach to help protect, repair, and optimize your computer. It provides an all-in-one and super convenient solution for PC maintenance and protection. All work will be done with 1 click and 1 minute. Besides keeping you compute operating well, the really great thing about all of these products are that they are free.  You can get each one a downloads.com by simply putting the name in the search bar.    Good Luck|`|b7jQ1UWvaa	If the "Virus thingy" you are referring to is a series of annoying bubbles that pop up from the System Tray (the area by your clock) chances are you have the "Antivirus 2009" malware/virus.  This thing is a scam that sneaks it's way onto your computer, scares you into using their virus removal tool, and wants you to give them your Credit Card info....they will charge you $100 dollars by the way.    This virus will hijack a number of things, Internet Explorer, Firefox, your Desktop, Task Manager, and searching critera via google, yahoo, or any search engine.  This makes it impossible to download free antivirus tools like Avast, Malware Bytes, or search for any way to fix the virus.  You may need to use another computer to download some removal tools, put them on a usb thumb drive, and transfer them to infected computer.    To fix it, install Avast Free Home Edition on the infected computer.  http://www.avast.com/eng/avast_4_home.ht...  Make sure you select the option for Startup scan, then restart the computer.  This will erradicate the virus before windows can start.  Make sure you select the option for Delete all infected files when it asks you...including the file Frmwrk.exe (it will bring up a special delete request about that file...delete it!)  This startup scan will take about 30 minutes.  After Windows starts back up, the virus should be cleared.  If you want to make sure you've gotten everything cleared, download and install Malware Bytes, and let it scan your computer as well.    After you are satisfied that the virus is gone, use Add/Remove Programs to uninstall both Avast and MalwareBytes, as they both tend to be resource hogs, and don't need to be installed on your computer.    In the future, when browsing on websites, watch out for messages that pop up and say "Would you like to download and try Antivirus 2008/2009"  If you click on Yes, No, or even the close button, it will download and infect your computer.  The only resolve to this is to CTRL+ALT+DEL to open task manager, select any open Internet Explorer program in the Application Tab, and hit the End Process button.    Good Luck|`|hlneO1iGaa	You have to reboot everything. Scan it. Clean it. Heal it.|`|d04aQIlYaa	Well you could try getting some anti viruses checking your computer regularly.

Run both of those and see if they help get rid of the virus and popups.  If you are familiar with Safe Mode, I would run them while in Safe Mode, otherwise just in Windows should be ok too.

HOq5Urn1aa	I agree completely with you. When you spend a lot of money getting a computer or laptop, why then protect it with a free anti virus.  Does not make sense to me.  I tested several internet security programs over the last 12 months.  Before I started testing internet security programs, I had Trend Micro Internet Security on my computer. My license expired and I wanted to try another one. I tried to uninstall Trend Micro for hours, but at the end I had to format my computer and reinstall Windows.  I tested 5 and came up with this top 3.    3rd place Kaspersky Internet Security 2009  2nd place Bitdefender Total Security 2009  1st place and in my opinion the best is   ESET Smart Security. It did find at least 10 % more infections than all the others.  http://www.eset.com/smartsecurity/  I never install an antivirus program but always internet security programs. ESET NOD32 anti virus is one of the best and is part of ESET Smart Security.  Those 2 reasons made me purchase ESET.  No regrets.|`|4MYWPD9Yaa	Good security requires a multi-layered approach, and the least important layer by far is running some kind of anti-malware program (in fact, if you take care of all the other layers, you don't even need an anti-malware program using up extra resources).    In order of importance:    1. Create and use almost exclusively a limited user account instead of the default administrator account Windows sets you up with    2. Read up on social engineering and how to avoid it    3. Don't download illegal copies of software, music, or movies    4. Set Windows updates to install automatically    5. Make regular backups. If possible, back up your entire installation (using Norton Ghost or Acronis True Image)|`|14d0ad3dfdb4dd36a9f896b96a702e69aa	Securing Windows operating systems from Internet assault is not a single application, or even a suite.   It's layers of protection, user habits, threat landscape awareness, system configuration, real time protection, and more.    All-in-one suites (CareOne, McAfee, or Norton) give users 'feel good' security, and lull them into complacency, which often has very bad results.     Look through some of the suggested freeware here,   http://www.snapfiles.com/Freeware/securi...  study up, and pick some of the frontline, real-time defenses.  Create a restore point after each install, then run the system to verify that application's 'friendliness' with your system before adding other applications.  Make selections based on your skill level & system's other configurations...an application you can't work with is of little use.  Generally speaking: as a system's convenience, interactiveness, flexibility & complexity increase: security decreases.    Sorry, but using Windows requires you to become a security expert, it's that simple.  Something they don't tell you when you buy this system...|`|GYij4N13aa	NOD 32 is best one, IMO. Another is Kaspersky. Another I am starting to like is Norton Gaming Edition Antivirus. They finally made a program that's not resource hog!

It should be alright after you have charged it for a few hours. Just be sure not to let it happen again.|`|ULxadpFmaa	NO. they actually consume much more power when not in use because its connected to the internet but its not constantly loading so basically yeah your battery is screwed, if its on ITS ON AND IT WONT TURN ITSELF OFF.|`|np9CdiaNaa	if anything its better that your going to run the battery down all the way if u dnt do that all the time the battery it has has like a sort of memory nd will not charge up completely, just make sure when u charge it it charges fully

cBT6Qrbhaa	if your printer is hooked up to a computer on your network it can be shared out for the network.  The printer does not have to be wireless.  Once you connect the printer to the computer share the printer out    Now make all pcs and wireless clients on the same workgroup so they can communicate.  Now when you connect wirelessly you should be able to go to My network Places and browse for shared printer.  you can also add it from the printer prompt by using the path to the shared printer:  \\COMPUTER1\HP_PRINTER|`|lDGlWZpNaa	Yes you can. Obviously both laptops are connected to the same access point or wireless router. On the laptop downstairs (if windows xp) hit    you going to share your printer from this laptop so right click on your printer and hit  there bubble in  and give it any name you want on share name.    To add the printer to the second laptop and so on you gotta make sure that all the laptops and computer are running on the same Workgroup. You can see this by right clicking  on the desktop go to  and go on the tab  there you will see Full computer name and "workgroup". Most cases its already in Workgroup or MSHOME. depends. Whatever is there for the laptop with the printer has to be on the other laptop as well. You can change it if it is not in the same workgroup by clickin on the button change in the same tab location  when this is set you can add the printer to the laptop wireless.    wireless add printer     -    -  on the left pane under " Printer Tasks" click on  Welcome to the add printer wizard will come up hit next and click on the bubble "A network printer, or a printer attached to another computer. hit next Now "Browse for a printer" Find the computer name of the laptop downstairs double click on it and it should show the name of the printer you gave when you shared it hit next and it will give you a warning ot some type of mssg but continue and your set =)|`|dILqe7nBaa	you said your printer was not wireless|`|bxlYleZkaa	You can get a plug in receiver for your printer which will enable you to print wirelessly from any nominated pc's or laptops withing range, provided of course that they are wireless enabled. I have one at home which will runs two separate printers and works from anywhere within the house and some parts outside too..

4QmgVhS5aa	Everyone knows that Windows computers can sometimes slow down over time. While not an exhaustive list of solutions to problems, this collection presents some ways to speed up a computer.    1. De-Fragmenting  Over time, the data on your hard drive gets scattered. Defragmenting your hard drive puts your data back into sequential order, making it easier for Windows to access it. As a result, the performance of your computer will improve.   a) Right click of C Disk.   b) Click properties.   c) Click tools tab.   d) Click "Defragment now".   e) Click Defragment.    2. Uninstall Unneeded Programs  Removing programs that you no longer use can free up space on your computer and speed up your system's performance. However, you need to uninstall the programs properly to see much improvement; deleting them is not enough.    3. Stop Programs from starting on Windows boot  One way you can speed up your computer is to prevent programs from launching themselves at start-up. Not only do the unwanted programs delay the start of Windows, they also continue to slow down your computer since they use system resources.   a) Open your Start menu.   b) Click Run   c) In the command screen type "msconfig.exe"   d) In the "system configuration utility", click either "service" or "startup" tab   e) Uncheck all programs that you are no longer using.   f) Click "OK"    4. Check for Spyware and Adware  Spyware is software that allows companies to monitor what websites you visit or even access your computer. Adware is software that displays advertisements. Both use system resources and slow your computer down. Detecting and removing the programs will improve system performance.  Get the best one from: http://toptenantispywareviews.com to scan your pc    5. Clean your Registry  Microsoft Registry Problems = Slow Computer!

If you can take a look at your board and see if there are 2 more in there. Read it more closely it says it support 4 banks using 2 x184 pin unbuffered dimm.    They used big words to make it sound like more than there were.|`|4r904UJWaa	This mobo (motherboard) has only got 2 dimm slots.   Dimm slots are where your RAM goes.  The other 2 White slots are for cards.   These are for a video or an audio card etc.  If you know the manufacturer of the board then you should go to their website and check out the specs for the board and some where along the way you will see a map of what is what and where on that particular mobo|`|JCdBSULraa	There are only two slots.  The description right beside the picture states:      ?   2 DIMMs w/ DDR400 upto 2GB|`|0S344Tefaa	Actually, it will depend on the motherboard model. The old model has 4 RAM slot. Desktop computer is quite different from laptop because it has different slot of RAM.|`|ZPBPwEQBaa	the green slots are memory when it said 4 it means you can have 4gb total two slots two 2gb ram sticks . the white are pci slots.

FO81o4Q6aa	Yes you can do that. Ignore what you are told otherwise.    Take a look at the osx86 project ( http://www.osx86project.org ) which is about running OS X on standard PC hardware. The other term you want to read on is 'Hackintosh'    I tried it myself, a little tricky at times but it basically works.    Also, this is my 666'th post. How appropriate!|`|zpDpQogWaa	No, Osx is developed to work with apple hardware only. The only way would be through a series of a cracks and hacks, that would more than likely damage your machine. Then if you could even get it running, the likeliness is it would be very unstable anyway.|`|bZRhT2HFaa	No you can't.   Even though OS X runs on the same chips as a PC, either the chip, board, or both are modified to Run OS X. A standard PC comp will not run OS X. It will run the Darwin kernel, but not the rest of what is in OS X.  Plus OS X is a 64 bit OS, unless your board would work with it, an old board wouldn't, then it will not work properly.
Y7jhIybzaa	You would have to look into JNI or OLE support for your application. First off this is a very hard thing to do in java because you are running inside the java virtual machine and to access another java application you may have to look into hooking your application into it's virtual machine. Not only that in most operating systems applications run with their own memory sandbox the OS usually does not let other applications to access their memory so doing this kind of thing can quickly become a programming nightmare.    If you absolutely have to do this kind of thing you are much better off in C or C++ because it is closer to what the OS is running in the case of linux and windows and it is much easier to hook into the OS libraries in C or C++ than in java using JNI.|`|Qm2apU5Qaa	I don't quite understand your question, but you can create a text file with a list of running processes by issuing a windows shell command through java's Runtime object.|`|696ef6ca84fa9734c2fd200c2761fbe4aa	That's a begining hackers question!
8bEts7uPaa	You already have one of the best environments -- your browser. If you use Firefox, you can get the Firebug extension, which will supply you with a Javascript console to try out various commands, etc.    Requiring a little more expertise to install, you can use command-line interpreters for Javascript. Spidermonkey is one:    http://www.mozilla.org/js/spidermonkey/    Or Rhino, which needs Java:    http://www.mozilla.org/rhino/    Perhaps, however, you really want to know what text editor works well with Javascript? Most will work well for you, if you use windows you may want to try Notepad++ or Scite:    http://notepad-plus.sourceforge.net  http://www.scintilla.org/SciTE.html    If you are used to another programmer's editor, such as Vim, ( http://vim.org ), most likely it will work fine. Since Javascript is such a common language, the syntax highlighting and code completion features will just work.    For a full-blown IDE (Integrated Development Environment, like Visual Studio), you could try Aptana:    http://www.aptana.com/    I suspect it will be overkill for what you want to do, but I could be wrong.    I know you said you already have a book, but more documentation wouldn't hurt. Doug Crockford is brilliant when it comes to Javascript. He has several articles you may find helpful:    http://javascript.crockford.com/    Hope this is helpful!|`|99d982daf0c2b0d82a4675478155a500aa	I do not know what you are trying to accomplish.  Javascript is used for web development.    Visual Studio Express comes in two flavors.  One for windows applications and one for web applications.    There is no limitation in Visual Studio Express for JavaScript.  However; unless you are doing web development learning JavaScript won't have any benefit for you.    You will not be using C++ for web development.  You might use Visual Basic if you are doing ASP.NET development.    If you have any further questions or if you think I misunderstood the question, then don't hesitate to send me an email: irishtek@yahoo.com|`|AA10330482	Javascript is an interpreted language - you don't really need a full-blown environment, just a text editor.  I find Notepad++ to be the best free all-around coder's text editor:    http://notepad-plus.sourceforge.net/uk/s...    If you want a full-blown IDE, Eclipse (free java-based IDE from Eclipse.org, very nice overall but sometimes really slow) has a few Javascript plugins that should work fine, here's the first one from a google search:    http://www.myeclipseide.com/module-htmlp...

If its an output stream try stream.println();
9TKZeLHTaa	I'm no expert at Object-Oriented PHP, but this looks like function references. $user and $auth look like object instances. session_begin() and setup() are functions defined in a class that $user is an instance of.    Whenever you're trying to access something in a class, you use ->. Here, 3 different functions are accessed ($user->session_begin(), $auth->acl(), $user->setup()), and the $data variable defined in $user is accessed ($user->data).|`|9ec59ec05692aadbf6887d31e881524baa	$user is a pointer to an object of the class which has the functions session_begin, acl and setup. So this is how you invoke a member function when you have a reference to the object thorough a pointer.

If it's free' It's free for a reason. Free AV's have security holes or they wouldn't be free. The hard part is learning what is good and what's not so good. Do a search here on answers and you will find what i am about to tell you is the truth.Trend micro' AVG' AVAST are the most popular among youngsters here. But truth is there 3 of the sorriest AV's out there. What you need is the right programs to start with. Not 10 dozen. What i use is Defender Pro powered by Kaspersky. It's the best AV you will get. It doesn't use a bunch of memory. By the time you download a firewall' anti spy' Antivirus' Anti mal ware. You can download one program and have it all. Then all you need is something to back it up. Like spyware blaster. Uses almost no memory and runs quietly in the back round. Down load super anti spy ware and set it to run when you want it to. That way you only have one program running. Your AV. Don't worry about systems idle process. When the computer is idle it should read between 98 and 99%. That's normal. If systems idle process is registering less than that then there is a program that is running and using memory. Spy ware doctor will use a good bit of memory. So will web root. Me' I would get rid of all of them and download a Kaspersky product like Defender Pro 15 in 1 then back it up like i said above. If your running a older computer with 256mb of memory or less Kaspersky's Defender will work better because of it's low memory usage. It's the best out there at 98% detection rate and a 97% protection rate. Hard to beat. There are other programs out there to keep your machine clean. CCleaner is good. It will keep old temp files and unused registry keys from building up and slowing down your system. Glary utility's is also very good to help you keep your machine free of clutter. Also there is a better defrag tool out there to. It's called Defraggler.  It is a much better tool than the one that came with your windows install. All these can be found at file hippo.com. My machine is almost 2 years old and it still runs like it did new. You can message me if you need any help. I been doing this a long time.

zmPuqU0zaa	Yes that's very easy to do. You could just create a gender column and a title column in the one table and fill in male or female. Then use a combo box to hold this data.    Create a text box with the control source of =me!comboboxname.column(1)    Basically you are referring to the column of the combo box which contains the gender.    So when you select Mr from your combo box your gender will be filled into the text box.....    For FREE Access ebook and videos click here  http://access-databases.com/ebook
PPIcNdAfaa	Oh yes, this is easily done. Find your Windows XP boot CD and pop it in.     Go to your computer's BIOS and change your PC's boot order to CD then Hard Drive (anything else stays in order). Restart your pc and the boot CD will start up. Choose to install windows.    It should take you to the Partition Manager, and ask about your partitions. Find the biggest one, it should say something like "30485MB". Notice: It could be much higher, or lower, but odds are it'll be higher.     Delete that partition, usually with the L key if I remember correctly, but it'll tell you specifically.    Then create a new partition over the one you just deleted. This will reinstall Windows XP.     BACK UP ANY IMPORTANT FILES!    Now, I should be dead on, but do a little bit more research AKA google searching to confirm the process.

Winxp is hard to find in stores.....and you would need the full version not the upgrade because most stores have the upgrade but not the full version, another problem you might have is if you have more then 4GB of ram, i believe xp will only reconize the 4GB any higher will be a waste, also you may have to go through and download all the drivers for some of the hardware, and lastly if it is a new computer....by switching to xp you void the manf. warrenty.    anyways....if you cant find it in stores usually online stores like tigerdirect.com or newegg.com would have winxp for sale to buy|`|mQ7ZAFd6aa	Looks like another dissatisfied customer of vista.     You will need to get your own windows xp installation cd and license key to do it. or  download a pirated version which may not work correctly but you will have to risk going to jail or being fined around $25.000 or $250.000 for having it.    Well assuming you have the disc and key in question. you should try to get all the windows xp drivers you can get before doing the install to make sure all your hardware will work with it. at the very least you wanna have the network drivers this way you can get back online and find the drivers for the rest of the hardware on your machine.|`|cBT6Qrbhaa	if applications not running is your only issue why not try running vmware server to virtualize an XP machine.

If you upgraded to Vista you can format your hard drive and delete the primary partition, then reinstall Windows XP with the XP CD.

Asus Rampage Formula Intel X48 (Socket 775) PCI-Express DDR2 Motherboard|`|AA11703028	hi mate            the Intel Core 2 Duo 8500 processor supports the popular socket lga775 and there you have one of the most popular motherboards around,however with so many mobo,s to choose from you need to ensure you get the correct one           a excellent example is the MSI G31M3-F iG31( http://www.aria.co.uk/Products/Component... and allthough this is only 28.69 exc. VAT its a compact and stable motherboard with all the nessecary features           these include a pci-express x16 graphics interface and 2 x 32bit pci slots ,also theres 2 x dimms supporting ddr2 memory with a maximum capacity of 4gb            connection wise theres 8 x usb ports and a Realtek RTL8111C gigabit network adapter,plus theres also 4 sata ports and a single ide(pata) socket for optical drives ect           on the whole the MSI G31M3-F iG31 has everyhting you need and nothing more and in some instances that can be just the ticket,especially if your a novice pc builder            however if your looking for something a bit more up-market then the MSI P7N SLI PLATINUM 750I ( http://www.aria.co.uk/Products/Component... is a excellent and well constructed mobo            with the avid gamer in mind msi have fitted this with 3 x pci-express x16 slots for sli ,and with 4 x dimms supporting up to 8gb of ddr2 ram this has power written all over it           other features include 2 x pci slots,2 x ide ports and 4 x sata ports for massive connectivity options,and with gigabit local area network port this motherboard is one worth considering           the final motherboard i will recommend is the Gigabyte GA-EP43-DS3L iP43( http://www.aria.co.uk/Products/Component...           this has similar features to the other two such as support for both ide and sata and ddr2 memory support with a maximum installable memory capacity of 8gb            however theres a massive 12 x usb ports on this motherboard which makes this ideal for people with more peripherals than normal,since its allways better using a usb port directly than via a usb hub(daisy chanined)            i hope this helps                 good luck mate !|`|33E6UDx5aa	Hey, you have the same CPU as me. Now you can get the best for about 200 which is the X48, as seen in this link.    http://www.overclockers.co.uk/showproduc...    But that's expensive and isn't really necessary .    Here is the one I'm going to be getting, and pretty much anyone with an E8400/E8500 will recommend the same. P5Q-Deluxe.    http://www.overclockers.co.uk/showproduc...    This motherboard and an E8500/Q6600 were made for each other, over clocking is very easy and the speeds you can achieve is immense.. 4GHz is definitely doable!    Also note, it's a Crossfire mobo, so you can't use SLI on it. But SLI & CF themselves are not worth it, by the time you get 2 good cards there's usually 1 single card released that's better.    Get this motherbaord and a F7P(Freezer 7 Pro) CPU cooler.  http://www.overclockers.co.uk/showproduc...    Trust me now, you won't regret it.    Now the problem with other boards mentioned are the chipsets Nfore, which is Nvidia's chipset, these are not nearly as good as the Intel chipset.. Intel chipset/Intel CPU ;)    I currently have an Nfore mobo, and it's got it's bugs I know(random bsods for no reason, and I'm not the only one who has trobule with Nforce schipsets), my mobo is currently a P5N-D.. I now regret buying it, if you don't want to overclock well it's not that bad. And it has 2 PCI-E slots for SLI.    So, my advice.  P5Q-Deluxe & F7P Cooler. I promise you won't regret it!     Or,    http://www.overclockers.co.uk/showproduc...    Also great:)    P.s: Do not get an MSI anything, they are the manufacture that isn't known for reliability. Search google "MSI motherboard problems" I got over 4 million hits, now that says something... compared to Asus 1.2 million:) the statistics speak for themselves. Never get MSI.|`|ZPBPwEQBaa	asus 750i  http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/...  great mb

kzkv6iKnaa	You've got to apply these rules to some element of your form.  Right now they're just hanging there.    For example, maybe you can put all your content in a big div with an id of "allContent" or something.  Then you can apply your css to that div:     allContent {    margin-top: 0 %;     margin-right: 30%;    margin-bottom: 0%;    margin-left: 30%;  }    Note that margins are ignored by inline tags (like span.)  If you want to apply margins to an element, it needs to be a block-level element (like  or ) or it needs to have its display set to block.

hdTJ5Lpnaa	use a sstunnel or privoxy.  m|`|mHWsuqjZaa	freeproxys.net i believe that one should work. it does at my school atleast|`|T17pbHVJaa	None should work.    School's are legally bound by the federal Children's Internet Protection Act to block proxies and the like.    Schools have to take this seriously to get certain technology funding.    All the proxies you try should be blocked by your school. That is because most schools use content blocking software. It blocks proxies 98% of the time because of their content (that they are a proxy), not because of the web address.  Also there are admins like me securing the system, adding any the system may miss (listed on proxy lists and even here) by adding them to the DNS blacklist.     You are very very unlikely to find one that works and even then it will only work for a short time until they know you are using it.    Your risking your computer rights/detention/suspension by trying to bypass their security.

Maybe one tiny piece fell off a board, but to figure out which one would be nearly impossible. You could try bringing it for repair, but I think they might take a look and give up in a situation like that.     Listen to any sounds your comp makes when it attempts to turn on, allot of computers have sound codes (bleeps) that tell you what the problem may be. Some comps also have light indicators that blink a certain way to let you know the problem. this could help but because it fell it may be broken in several different ways.    Look at all the components inside and determine if anything looks cracked or dented, sometimes it's hard to tell if a green board is cracked also in some cases they can crack on one side and look fine on the other.    good luck on getting it running again|`|41wnWIZyaa	you could have broken your hard-drive

10af4993fcb827d6fabb27f05cba2be5aa	With a wired router, the only way someone can "HACK" is through the internet or from one of the wired ports!  Blocking "Anonymous Internet requests" keeps those on the internet from getting into your system! So yes you want to block that!  As for someone using one of the hardwired connections, you have full control!      I suspect you have a virus or a trojan on your system that is allowing someone to use your computer as a "remote" connection. This can be done these days.    Run a couple of good scans to see.  Malware bytes http://www.download.com/Malwarebytes-Ant...  is a very good tester for malware.  Trend Micros Housecall checks for viruses and malware  http://housecall.trendmicro.com    Both are free. I suggest you run them, see what they tell you about your system!
hwRZ7DY7aa	At first I suggest that you use a vector graphics program like Illustrator or Flash (Corel also works although I don't use it) that way what you produce will be fully scalable without that diminishing its quality.  Try the link below to learn more about the curves although practice makes best.     When saving in general make sure you save as an .ai or .eps or .cdr or .fla format (depending on the program you use, eps is the most common and can be opened by all programs so I recommend it) this way your logo will maintain its vector form.  When saving for the web save normally as .gif or .jpg at a 72 dpi resolution.    For offset printing: make sure you are using the CMYK color scheme  For the web: make sure you are using the RGB color scheme (more info on the link below)    some graphic design advice: keep it simple and clean with a few colors, the most successful logos are simple and use 1-2 colors, make variations in black and white and use different backgrounds. When you are done print a huge one and a tiny one and 5-6 sizes in between. Make sure that what you have created is clear and presentable in any size.    good luck|`|Mqgj1bqzaa	Set your image DPI to 300 and the dimensions very large (2000 x 2000 for example).  For better curves check out the custom shapes available to you or create new curves with a round paintbrush and then use a round eraser tool to remove the parts you don't want.

zorYTX59aa	I see questions very similar to yours every few days on Y!A  now, so I did a whole lot of googling, searching and reading,  going over dozens and dozens of websites, only to discover  that there's no definitive answer out there.     The only semblance of a part solution which kind of worked  for a few people would require you to either:  1 -- mess around with your registry (which I would be totally   deadset against because that could really screw things up);   2 -- download some strange "utility" (which I'd be even more  against, because that kind of stuff is what probably created  your problem in the first place).    Thus, my first piece of advice to you: shutdown then reboot.  If that doesn't work, this is what I advise many other people  when YouTube gets slow, stuck or weird: clear your "cache"  of all its "Temporary Internet Files". While you're doing that,  you should also clear your "History" and your "Cookies", in   order to make your computer "fresh". My famous triple-cure  seemingly resolves many people's YouTube problems, thus  why not yours:    Internet Explorer 6:   Tools  Internet Options    Delete Cookies  OK   Delete Files  OK   Clear History  Yes    OK    Internet Explorer 7:   Tools  Internet Options  Delete...   Delete files  Yes   Delete cookies  OK   Delete history  OK   Close (browsing history window)   OK    Mozilla Firefox   Tools  Clear Private Data  [x] Browsing History  [x] Download History  [x] Saved Form and Search History  [x] Cache  [x] Cookies   Clear Private Data Now    If that doesn't do the trick, here are some other suggestions:    ? If you've got "Google Web Accelerator" or anything similar,  uninstall it immediately. GWA destroys YouTube.    ? Long videos require both "Flash" and "Shockwave" to play  properly. Shockwave includes Flash, but not vice versa.    ? Depending on which version of Flash that you've got, every  brand new session begins with the volume is set to zero, by  default. Maybe the only thing you need to do is scroll up the   volume of the video player.    ? Who knows why it works, but sometimes things go better  when you change the web URL from "www.youtube.com" to  just "youtube.com", or you could even try "ca.youtube.com".    ? A few people found success by closing their web browser,   then restarting it. A couple others simply rebooted, and one   person said that everything magically started working again  just like that on the following day -- with no effort on his part.    If you're able to find the "cause" and the "cure", I would very  much appreciate it if you could click on my avatar and write   to me, so that I can include it in my future Yahoo! Answers.  (Thus far, one apparent cause seems to be if you download  music from "Torrents".)    I wish you good luck and hope that a part of my answer will  do the trick for you.

RZQnxoF1aa	Windows freezes or stops responding frequently.  This issue could be caused by any of the below possibilities.   1. Software related issue.   2. Driver related issue.   3. Operating system related issue.   4. Heat related issue.   5. Hardware issue.   6. Serious issue with Windows   7. Hardware failure.        An easy way to determine if your computer is in this situation is by pressing the Num Lock button on the keyboard and watching the Num Lock led to see if it turns off and/or on.  If you're able to get the light to turn off an on, press CTRL + ALT + DEL and attempt to end task the program.  Software related issue    A computer locking up or freezing is often is caused by a software related issue. If you're encountering lockups when the computer is opening a particular program, make sure you have all the latest updates for that program.   Update your registry cleaner tool, scan you pc.  Use the tool: http://downloadlk.com/themosteffectivere... [if you do not have one]  Driver related issue   A computer lock up can also be caused by drivers. For example, if there is an issue that exists with your video drivers a computer could lock up while playing a game or displaying any other type of video. Make sure you have the latest drivers for all major devices in your computer (video, sound, modem, and network). Operating system related issue   Make sure your operating system has all of the latest updates installed on it.   Heat related issue   If the computer processor is getting too hot it can cause the computer to freeze. If you have heard any abnormal noises coming from your computer recently such as a high squealing, this could indicate a fan may be failing in your computer.|`|ffqsWfZtaa	Its a feature, not a bug - Honest guv    If you press shift key 5 times it will try to turn sticky keys on for you.

FBQZ06vraa	First, dont worry.  None of the characters print.      The dots certainly are a nuisance, but those strange ? symbols are really your friends. They show exactly where each paragraph ends. Since all paragraph formatting (tabs, indents, margins, line spacing, before and after paragraph spacing, ...) is attached to them, accidentally deleting one can cause mysterious reformatting problems. I've found it's nice to know where they are.    If you still want to get rid of everything, do this:    In versions of Word prior to Word 2007 (Vista):    1. Click the ? button on the Formatting toolbar.    In Word 2007:    1. Click the ? button in the Paragraph section of the Home tab.    But if you want to turn off just the other characters, here's how:    In Word versions prior to Word 2007 (Vista):    1. Click the Tools->Options menu item.  2. Click the View tab.  3. Under Formatting Marks, select ONLY Paragraph Marks and deselect all others.  4. Click OK.    In Word 2007, do this:    1. Click the Office Button.  2. Click the Word Options button.  3. On the left side of the dialog box, click Display.  4. Under Always Show These Formatting Marks On The Screen, put a check mark next to Paragraph Marks.  5. Make sure all the other entries in this section are unchecked.  6. Click OK.

If so, check to make sure it is enabled.    If you don't see it there, check to see if the connection to the drive is bad, or if the drive itself is bad...    believe you need to do some registry editing to remove the upper and lower filters for the cd drive.  You can try Doug Knox's fix found here http://www.dougknox.com/xp/scripts_desc/...  Or you can manually edit the registry.

Note You may also see an UpperFilters.bak registry entry. You do not have to remove that entry. Click UpperFilters only.  "      If you see the UpperFilters registry entry in the details pane of Registry Editor, go to step 6.  "      If you do not see the UpperFilters registry entry, you still might have to remove the LowerFilters registry entry. To do this, go to "Step 3: Delete the LowerFilters registry entry."  6.      On the Edit menu, click Delete.  7.      Click Yes when you receive the following message:  Are you sure you want to delete this value?  The UpperFilters registry entry is removed.  Step 3: Delete the LowerFilters registry entry  1.      In the details pane of Registry Editor, on the right side, click LowerFilters.    Note You might see a LowerFilters.bak registry entry. You do not have to remove that entry. Click LowerFilters only.    If you do not see the LowerFilters registry entry, unfortunately this content is unable to help you any more.

Usually, Dell sells refurbished/new replacement parts online. This time, I couldn't find any straight from Dell (probably because you have an older laptop), but you'll be able to find some if you use Ebay.com. Search "Inspiron 1501 LCD screen" For example: http://cgi.ebay.com/New-DELL-Inspiron-15...    Its easy and pretty safe to replace the screen yourself - you just need to be careful, follow the instructions, and make sure you don't lose any screws!! Have your parents/friends/siblings help you if you want. Dell provides service manuals for all of their computers.  Replacing the Screen on Inspiron 1501:  http://support.dell.com/support/edocs/sy...    Or you can send it in to the shop and have someone replace it for you. They do essentially the same thing: buy a new screen, take it apart, pop it in, and charge you for it. However, since your laptop is a bit old, I don't know if people are still willing to repair it (since the parts aren't as easy to get).

33E6UDx5aa	Ccleaner cleans up useless stuff on your computer, like temporary files etc etc.    Disk defrag does something different. It rearranges fragments on your hard drive so they can be accessed faster, thus, increases the speed of which things are loaded on the drive.    Here's an example,say you wanted to load a program.    The drive has to search for the files on your hard drive, here is a table to try show you how it works.    This is how it's layed out using the hard drive as 1-10 slots(will be alot more in the drive this is just an example), when you install something on your hard drive it takes up the first slot it comes across, So... say the program(Firefox for example) you want to install has 4 files in it, but you have other stuff on your hard drive, that's been installed/uninstalled over the past few weeks.     They also took up spots on your hard drive. But sometimes when a program is uninstalled fragments will still remain on the hard drive, taking up slots.    note: the program you want to install takes up 4 slots, for now we'll just name the program Firefox.    But you also has 2 other programs installed on this same drive... for example we will say, Itunes & MSN messenger.    1:Itunes - File1  2:Itunes - File2  3:Itunes - File3  4:Itunes - File4  5:MSN-File1  6:MSN-File2  7:MSN-File3  8:MSN-File4  9:MSN-File5  10:MSN-File6    That's what your drive looks like with these installed.    Now, you want to install Firefox, but you have already uninstalled MSN and Itunes, but for some reason some of the files still got left on the hard drive.    Here is a table of what your drive looks like after you uninstalled Itunes & MSN.    1:Itunes - File1  2:  3:Itunes - File3  4:  5:MSN-File1  6:MSN-File2  7:  8:  9:MSN-File5  10:    So, your drive gets scanned to see which slots are free to install the 4 files that firefox has.    It sees that slots 2,4,7,8,10(5 in total) are free. but since Firefox has 4 files it will use the first 4 slots, 2,4,7,8.     1:Itunes - File1  2:Firefox-File  3:Itunes - File3  4:Firefox-File2  5:MSN-File1  6:MSN-File2  7:Firefox-File3  8:Firefox-File4  9:MSN-File5  10:  This is what the dirve looks like after installing Firefox.    As you can see, some of the files are not beside eachother, and there's another program file separating them.    When you load a program your drive cycles around to load the files. So it goes to load Firefox... it does 1 cycle to and find a file in slot number 2, it checks slots 3 for another file.. but remnants of Itunes have filled this slot. So it gets 1 file in 1 cycle... but it need all the 4 files to load the program, so the drive goes to cycle again; finds another file in slot 4, but MSN has a file still left in slot 5. So it has to do another cycle.    It finds slot 7 has the 3rd file it needs, but it checks slot 8, and finds the last file needed for firefox to load. So it took 3 cycles to load up this program.    Now what a defrag does, is remove the fragments of old things you have installed, like MSN & Itunes. And rearranges the files on your hard drive to be beside each other. So it would put all the firefox files together taking up the first 4 Slots, so when you go to load the program it only takes 1 cycle of your drive to load firefox.     Less cycles=faster loading.    I know this might seem confusing and it's a long answer, but that's the best way I can describe a defrag and how it works.|`|kVGdqXKQaa	ccleaner gets rid of old files that not being used by the computer no more. And cleans your computer for cookies temporary internet files and etc.    Disk Defrag organize your files by catagorey so when you run  certain files or run a program it will reduce the time wait.     For example say if you had a file called cat and that file spreaded to different parts of your hard drive. The disk will  rotate once to collect the (c) then twice to collect the (a) then third time to collect the (t). The more that the disk rotate to collect the necesary Information  for the files you trying to run the more the Wait time.  Disk Defrag organize the files to reduce the wait time by puting files in one section
ZLI8Ogdlaa	It basically does the same thing. It cleans your drives. Except Disk defragging moves files in order to conserve space.|`|7bf62358ee706efffb78c25a9c7d5a00aa	As you delete and add files to the drive, they get fragmented.  (If you delete 3 1 cluster files located on different areas of the disk, then save a 3 cluster file, it gets saved in those 3 scattered clusters.  Defragging puts files into contiguous pieces.    If you delete the files for a program, the program is gone, but all its registry entries are still there.  CCleaner mainly cleans out entries in the registry that refer to the programs that are no longer on the drive.|`|bLuFKxQNaa	CCleaner is a diskcleanup program that helps you get rid of junk and stuff like temp files that use up HDD space.     A disk defragmenter puts the fragmented files back together contiguously speeding up data access and making the PC run faster. IMO the best defragmenter is Diskeeper. It defrags well even if you have only about 5% free space. One of the limitations of the Windows defragger is that it needs atleast 15% free space to defrag.

That can be caused by spilling liquid on the keyboard or tapping too hard on the keys or touchpad.  Under the keyboard there are wires inside a little box that instructs all the keys what to do.  The wires if they get jumbled up or misplaced would stop the keys from working.  The best thing to do is consult an engineer who will put a new keyboard on your laptop.

ELovXY9Paa	yes, the 9200 would be fine.  any 9 series card can handle the relatively low requirements of those games.  You might even be better off with a cheaper one, like an 8600, because if you're only a casual gamer, your processor is probably not top-of-the-line, and your (relatively) slow processor will bottleneck the performance of the 9200 anyway.    I followed your link, and I see that it's a laptop.  Yes, that setup will do just fine.  You could even run COD4 if you wanted, and it wouldn't be a problem.
A0uqbBTiaa	Installing Linux will not void the warranty on the PS3, it has been developed to allow installation as a dual boot system.  It's not hard to do either.    http://www.playstation.com/ps3-openplatf...    LogMeIn does not have a product for Linux though    https://logmeinsupport.com/kblive/crm/se...    You can, however, use a PSP to access your PS3 remotely.    http://blog.us.playstation.com/2008/12/3...|`|mQ7ZAFd6aa	currently no. but if you have a psp and a playstation game in your ps3 your psp can connect to it and play that playstation game|`|AVDTZ63Oaa	The short answer is no.. not really. The built in Operating system, (Sony Xross MediaBar version 2.53) is not capable of this sort of thing "out of the box"    The longer answer is.. well the PS3 is a computer, and frankly it's a pretty good one, sort of a souped up old schoole Mac chip in there. you COULD go though the process of installing a Linux in your ps3 and then setting rdc on the Linux install, but you'd be dealing with a silly little desktop computer system which just happens to be running on a ps3. You wouldn't be able to play ps3 games remotely or anything...|`|9TKZeLHTaa	um... I think you can install Linux on a ps3 and then you'd be able to remote access it. however, I have never done this and I have no idea if you'd ever be able to use your ps3 ever again.    Here's how I think you would do it:  http://www.popularmechanics.com/technolo...    I wouldn't try it unless you're an expert. And oh, this will void your ps3's warranty, so if you screw up the ps3 is gone. And even if it does work, I don't even know if you can install LogMeIn on it. And even if you CAN install LogMeIn, I don't know if you'd be able to access the gaming part of your ps3.    **RESPONSE TO POST BELOW:  I know installing Linux wouldn't void the warranty, but what they show here: http://www.popularmechanics.com/technolo...   would definitely void the warranty.
Oc8hxB5Laa	Right-click on the "My Documents" folder on your desktop, click on Properties. Change the Target to D:\ or a folder on D:, such as D:\My Documents. You may have to manually copy your files over, but this makes it so that files saved to "My Documents" will be saved to your D: drive.    This will only change your "My Documents" folder. If you want the files on your Desktop to also be saved to D:\, do the following:    1. Click on Start -> Run...  2. Type regedit, click OK.  3. Browse to \HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\ Microsoft\ Windows\CurrentVersion\ Explorer\ Shell Folders  4. Find the entry called "Desktop" and double-click on it.  5. Change the address inside to a folder on D:, such as D:\Desktop. Make sure that this folder already exists.    BTW, having multiple partitions is useless if your goal is to prevent virus infections, but it is very useful for making sure your files are saved in case the operating system fails and you need to reinstall.|`|DSOJvIhtaa	Whatever program you have running (MS Word, Excel) all have a default save directly that you can change to your D: drive. You'll also have to be aware that most programs will try to save things to your C: drive by default so you'll have to be watching when you're saving.  The bigger question is have you thought about how you're going to create the D: drive? That can present a whole list of other problem. We'll look forward to that question later.|`|3LHsCLVFaa	Use "save as" instead of save. This allows you to tell it what drive. In this case partition.

ATM i run solaris 10 with apache mysql php and perl installed to compile and run certain tools ;)  good luck|`|9TKZeLHTaa	Here's how you do it:  1) Install Apache on your computer.  2) Install MySQL and Perl support onto Apache (I think it comes with it)  3) Install MySQL onto your computer in order to make a database.  4) Visit the loopback address, localhost (http://127.0.0.1)    IF YOU WANT YOUR WEBSITE TO BE ACCESSIBLE FROM THE OUTSIDE:    4) Open a port on your router to your computer (I think it's usually port 80).  5) Find out your external IP address at http://www.whatismyip.com/  6) Enter your external IP address into your web browser. If you get a page, your computer is now a web server.

pI4fF4n8aa	Go for an HP. Get the fastest processor and the most memory you can afford (the processor being more important for pictures). Also look into getting a bigger hard drive too if you plan to store lots of pictures.|`|aXC7elejaa	Go on newegg.com. You can go price certain parts around and make wish lists of parts you like.    For what you're doing, a lot of photo editing and word processing, you could just get a dual core processor. Maybe like an AMD Athlon x64 3.1 dual core processor. It'll run you about $80. No real use having a quad core computer if 1.)you're not a huge gamer and 2.) you're not running a 64bit OS.  Maybe a micro ATX motherboard that can handle at least 4 gigs only because having a 32 bit OS is limited to 4 gigs (some only read around 3 gigs). I would suggest a 1TB hard drive, that's about $100+. 4 gigs of ram, around $40-$60. A dvd burner $20, computer case, $50-$200. A good power source. I would suggest an Antec rated at least  500 watt, $60 or so. A card reader, $20-$50. Now for a video card, look to spending over $200++ on a nice 512mb or more card. I figure since you're using graphic intense programs, no use slacking off on a video card. Just throwing prices around. Have fun on newegg. I did.

DWBN7wDbaa	No it's not illegal to download/upload music. There is no law saying that you can't use P2P software. It's just what you do with the copyrighted material.    I really suggest not using Limewire anymore. It has a lot of spyware built into the program itself which infects your computer. And the network has a lot of fake files, and it has many viruses.    WinMX has no spyware, no fake files, and is fast and easy to use.    It even blocks the RIAA/MPAA from getting on the network, so you can't possibly be caught downloading/uploading.    http://www.patchwinmx.com    It even forwards ports for you so you don't have to do it yourself.|`|WtwpzZXiaa	no .. unless your sharing copyrighted file then yes|`|7bf62358ee706efffb78c25a9c7d5a00aa	Mary, sharing consists of 2 parts, giving AND taking.    Besides, the copyright violation isn't giving or taking, it's *having*.    Kelsey, the current "punishment" is that your provider turns off your internet access - permanently.  And blacklists you, so no other provider will give you an account.  Not too terrible - if you never want internet access again.|`|7oC5tO9kaa	No limewire is a legal program it is what you use limewire to do that is illegal|`|2YSKXb8Aaa	Mary could not be more wrong.

You can change the IP from network connection icon but even then it has to be the CORRECT IP, you can't just make one up.  Changing to just any IP won't work.    DHCP makes obtaining an IP automatic thus the reason is it used.    You can use a remote PROXY service to get a different IP.

2SSA9e9Naa	First, edit file series does not do what you want it to do. It is used to fill a set of cells based on a beginning value. It won't restrict data entry.    To solve your problem you'll need to use weekday and if in cell D6.    Weekday will give you the day of week for B2+60 - weekday for today, wednesday is 4. Using that information and if you can then figure out how to adjust your data to give you a non-weekend, basically anything where weekday doesn't return 1 (sunday) or 7 (saturday).    Hope that helps.    You may want to use a series of cells to actually do this work, or nested ifs.|`|MxculX2Daa	Does it have to be +60?  This does not divide evenly by 7.  If you chose +56 or +63 then it would always be the same day of the week as the day you entered it.|`|SrfLbfwMaa	You will need to decide whether you go to the next Monday or to the previous Friday if the 60 days after that date is Sat or Sun    There is a weekly calendar here that might help you to figure out the exact formula you want  http://www.file1.net/project.asp?id=87  try also this Yearly/Monthly calendar  http://www.file1.net/project.asp?id=63  and this  http://www.file1.net/project.asp?id=75    If none of those helped you, contact me here to solve it for you, i have more than 12 years with Excel now    After all, VBAXLMan is here to feed your Excel needs

2arZOZWgaa	I use my TV as a second monitor to watch the movies and TV shows that I have downloaded. I have the TV plugged into my computer with a DVI to HDMI cable (I have a Vizio LCD and the type of cable you will need depends on the quality of your TV and the outputs on your video card). As for sound, I use a normal RCA cable.    I would suggest: Right click on desktop > Properties > Setting. This will allow you to label your TV as a second monitor. You will have to click a box that says "extend my windows desktop on to this monitor.) All of that assuming you are using windows. Then, I open up whatever i want to watch in it's media player, drag it over to the TV with the mouse and full screen it.    I would be willing to answer questions if you consider this route.
2SSA9e9Naa	Typically systems that come preinstalled will often have the software installation files on it in addition to the software being installed.    If you are curious to find out where it is all taken try this:    Right click on c:\program files and bring up properties. It'll show you the total space by all files there.    Do the same for c:\document and Settings and c:\windows.    My system has a c:\i386 which is actually the installation disks for XP.    So, if you do that you'll begin to figure out where the space has gone.    It's called software bloat :)|`|48e9baf113e4951f779199c900a19f63aa	HP tends to load up their comps with useless programs.

2arZOZWgaa	From personal experience, I will not get another Thermaltake water cooling system. My first build was completed with the Thermaltake Bigwater 760is and I get temperatures that I could of achieved with normal air cooling.      I joined a very popular forum, xtreme systems, and got hounded when I told them I got Thermaltake.    After putting together the system, I saw just how easy it was and decided I would never buy another kit again. I suggest you do the same. Buy individual pieces for your sake and your poor CPU's sake as well.    First link: experienced water coolers more than willing to offer further advice    Second link: exceptional high quality water cooling pieces (though there are many other sources)|`|af3a28b07826dce8ecfc28a5eaa91e13aa	If it's the right size and the thermal paste is sticky enough to hold it, then it should be ok.

IuCT3TjGaa	This problem can mean many things, odds are the problem is with the operating system itself. I'm going to give you some instruction of some things I would do if I was working on this computer.   Questions you should consider:   Do you get any error messages? If so contact Microsoft with the error message.   Is you computer under warranty? If so, it's best to let a technician handle the problem. Note: Sometimes they will reformat or replace your hard drive. You could loose all data so it would be a good idea to backup first.   Re-pare Steps:   1) Restart Windows in Safe Mode. As you computer is restarting, hold down F8 and once the menu appears, select Safe Mode using the arrow key and selecting by pressing enter. Note: If windows does not boot in safe mode then seek help from a train technician, the problem may be too complex to go into decision in the message.   2) Consider a system restore. You will loose all data and changes you have made to your computer after the restore date. Open system restore by clicking on the start menu and selecting help and support. System restore should be one of the options assuming you have system restore turned on. (It's windows default so you should.) Select a restore date prior to the problem occurrence. Restore your PC. If you do not want to do a system restore then skip this step.   3) Update any and all ad-ware, spy-ware, and most importantly, Registry Cleaner programs that are running on you computer.   Use the tool:   http://toptenantispywareviews.com/Clean_... [if you do not have one]    http://toptenantispywareviews.com [if you do not have one]    4) Run a virus scan, then spy-ware scan, followed by ad-ware.   5) Your problem should be resolved by now. Restart your computer and see if it works, if not then restart in safe mode again (step 1).   6) If all else fells you can reformat your hard drive by reinstalling windows. You can do this by inserting the windows disk or system restore disk that came with your computer. Follow the instructions given by the manufacturer. WARNING: This will wipe the hard drive of all data, it will be like you just got your computer. You will loose all software and everything.   I hope this helped.

MQngKAJCaa	Try taking it to an Apple store. After you tell them it's broken, yada yada, if they can't repair it, they'll offer you a new one. You may then be able to negotiate upgrading to an aluminum Macbook, but it'll cost you some if they allow it.|`|AA12370001	you can try and sell it and buy a new one.  If the macbook is broken then they will replace it with the same model, not a new one.  If they find out that you broke it on purpose they won't replace it.  Check your service contract.|`|CkBGJsB8aa	You probably cannot trade it in, but whenever you buy a mac product, it comes with a warranty, so if it was only 2 months old, then they can fix it    I like black more than aluminum
qRx3ynKdaa	OpenOffice defaults to showing black letters on white paper on a gray background.    Of course you cant just get the background to disappear. With what would replace it, a hole in your screen?    Setting View  Zoom...  will cause the main page to always size so that it slightly overlaps the left and white edges of the OpenOffice.org Writer windows. Therefore the right and left gray edges will no longer show. But spacing above and below the indvidual pages will still show.    Or you can use one of the other Zoom settings, and change your window size to currently hide the gray on left and right.    Selecting View  Web Web layout will remove all gray borders, as will show the text as it would appear on the web in HTML, where there are no page ends, and where wrapping depends on how wide the viewer has made his or her browser window. (However, OpenOffice.org is still actually calculating page breaks according to the current page size and margins, as you can see by shifting back to View  Print Layout.    You can change the gray color to white if you want through Tools  Options,,,  OpenOffice.org  Appearance  Application Background. Change it to white if you wish, but the lines delimiting the edge of the page will still show.    Or are you talking about the thing gray line that delimits the marginal portion of the page from the text portion? View  Text Boundaries will toggle this off and on. To have it always toggled off in a new document, go to Tools  Options...  OpenOffice.org  Appearance and uncheck Text Boundaries.    Then save your document as your default Writer template. Then any future document you create will come up the same as that saved template|`|pwkeo7tTaa	What gray borders are you talking about?    Take a print screen  http://www.photobucket.com    Try going to View > Zoom and select "Optimal"
