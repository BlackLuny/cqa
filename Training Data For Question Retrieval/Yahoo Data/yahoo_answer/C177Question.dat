20090203145832AAArghN	Pregnancy & Parenting;Grade-Schooler	Bubble baths with son?	My son is 8 years old. He is a good kid and I think I am a good Mom, but my sister is telling me otherwise.  On Saturday nights me and my son have a tradition of taking whirlpool baths together. We always have fun and sometimes we have bubble baths. Sometimes he gets erections in the bath, but he never has been embarrassed of it until Saturday.  He got one in the bath and he kept trying to push it down. I asked him why he was and he told me he was "sick of it happening all of the time". I told him it was completely natural and he should be proud of his penis and he didn't seemed as embarrassed anymore. Today I told my sister what happened and she told me that I shouldn't have said that and I was being a bad parent for being naked in the tub with him. Is that true? I never do anything bad to him. Did I say the right thing? Should I stop being naked with him? AAARGGH I don't know what to do!

I keep hearing about women who didn't really ever get Braxton Hicks and had to be induced. What about those who have had them regularly for weeks, did you have to be induced?       I'm 38 1/2 weeks and my doctor wants to induce me at the end of next week, no medical reason for it, but they said if I didnt agree to it they wouldn't deliver the baby (kind of late to find a new doctor) and I was just wondering if you think the baby will come in time?    90% effaced 2cm dilated and Braxton Hicks constantly for months - and getting stronger each day.

20090203150930AAn0BtM	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	I am so insecure dont know what to do.....?	Hi there guys      Sorry this is gonna be a long one and i will try to make as much sense as possible.      Right to start i am 17 weeks pregnant and my husband is away in Canada with the army for 3 months back on the 31st of March.      When i found out i was pregnant we decided to get married due to security for the baby etc etc, well we had only been married 3 weeks before he went to Canada and prior to that had been together 5 months.      I have never had trust issue's with any of my partners and i have never felt insecure but i cant shake the insecurities off right now, the other day me and my husband were on msn chatting and on web cam to each other, i noticed he went to sit next to some other guy, later to find out that the guy was on webcam to the cleaner on the site (this guys been trying to get laid by her since he went there) out there and watching her have her boobs etc etc out i could see my husband was looking at something every now and then but i didn't take any notice until the next day he had mentioned what this girl was doing i then put 2 and 2 together and asked him outright were you watching that girl flaunt herself? his response was yes! i started to get very upset and said how would he like it if i was watching men do things like that, i got no comment and he started to get really bolshy with me for saying how upset i was about him doing it least of all when he was online talking to me.      The trust was never a 100% as we had been together a short while and trust is something that builds over time, my husband has been pestering me to do sexual things over the cam for him and i told him i don't feel comfortable doing them and he has made me feel utterly guilty about not doing it, i feel awful that i cannot satisfy his needs and am so scared as i am not doing anything that his frustration and the temptations will get too much for him.      I want to trust him a 100% but i just cant everyday im thinking perhaps hes doing the same thing as the other guy on the webcam etc etc, he says that he married me and he is 110% faithful but i feel after him checking out some trashy downgrading lass over the cam has sent my trust tumbling.      I am being treated for prenatal depression at the moment and the one person i could do with no worries about is my biggest.      I am probably overreacting but i just cannot get past the insecurities of him being away from me, i love him dearly and i know he really loves me but i am not sure how strong he actually is. I am so scared that he will do something out there with another women i have never felt like this before and don't know why i am now, i have sent him a email explaining how upset i am (have not had a reply) but i think he will hate me for being truthful with him about what he did and how much it upset me, he did say that the girl was making a fool of herself but he would say that wouldn't he? and he said he only looked coz all the other lads were too but there not married and not got a baby on the way. I don't think he realises how much this has sent my trust downhill and i was building it up.      I don't know where to go from here, i don't want him upset because he knows i cannot trust him 100% but then i cant handle the pressure of this on my shoulders.      Does anyone have any advice. I could do with some kind words i feel so alone without him here and with the insecurities i am a mess.      I hope this makes sense.      I have put this in pregnancy because im pregnant and know my hormones may have a part to with the prenatl depression etc etc.

20090203151429AAHVcaW	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	How should a 15 year old be treated?	Im 15 and i live with my dad and his wife. they have 2 daughters. My step-mom and i dont agree on anything, we constantly bicker about everything, and its emotional draining. i dont feel comfortable at his house because of her. one of my sisters is 2 days younger than i am. so we have a constant comparison. ive gotten to the piont where its REALLY uncomfortable.  both dad and his wife have control issues. they have to control every aspect. One example is texting. for christmas i got texting back, i went with my mom a couple days, and i sent 2,000 texts. they set a guidline of 100 texts a day.  i went over then they block the whole thing, but only let me text at lunch. but other times of the day its blocked.    another thing is laundry, i cant do laundry at my dads, only at my moms. because my step-mom said i couldnt.    no phone when i get home, they dont let me go to friends houses.  its gotten to the point where i dont know what to do, i dont talk here anymore, or volenteer any information on my days, im always away from them.  i think i would honestly be in foster care then be here and i told that to them too.    does anybody have any step-by-step planes to get out of this hell house?    how do other people parent thier teenagers?

20090203153030AANFwDm	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Weird Question About Weight and Fertility?	Ok, so according to BMI calculators, I'm "overweight"/almost obese because my BMI is 28.6. I am 4'10 and weigh 137 pounds. Since I'm TTC, I know my weight plays into my fertility. But here's my question.      Almost all my weight is on my lower half [hips, thighs, butt] and I have a flat/small stomach [basically, an hourglass figure]. Everyone knows that having more weight in your torso is very unhealthy, whereas being bottom-heavy like myself is somewhat healthier.      Does that fact that I'm bottom-heavy still affect my fertility negatively or does it apply to women who have more weight on their torsos or more weight all over their body?       I'm sorry if this question sounds confusing lol. Thank you in advance for answers.

I don't want to force her because she'll cry like crazy. I also don't want her to not get enough. Of course I give her formula throughout the day too. What do you think?

20090203155214AAV6YVS	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	Would you like a public service announcement?	Ok, I am sick and tired of seeing the illiteracy on here. This is America for the most part! Even then the Brits that come on here use better english and the Canadians.      Brake- The thing used the stop the car. "I slammed on the brakes when the car in front of me stalled."   Break- " There was a break in my bone after getting kicked during the soccer game."      You're- You and are. "You're under arrest because your grammar sucks"   Your- You(personal) "Your face is ugly, I am sorry about that."      Where- "Barnes and Nobles is where you can buy a grammar book."   Were- "You were saying?"   Wear- "Are you really going to wear that?"      Loose- "His pants are too loose and sagging, he looks like an idiot."   Lose- "I am going to lose my mind at the thought of how many idiots there really are."      Their- "Their house was small and fugly."   There- "There is the boat, look it's sinking."   They're- They and Are. "They're on the sinking boat, someone wave bye."      Bye- "Bye, see you soon."   By- "By the way, you suck."      Knew- " I knew you were as stupid as you looked."   New- "Yes, my jeans are new, they make my asss ook nice too.   No- "No, you can't touch my nice looking asss"      Too- "Can I go too?   Two- "You have the IQ of a two year old, don't you?

Plain- " There was grain growing on the plains and it was blowing in the wind."   Plane- " I love plane rides."      Piece- " I'll have a piece of pie."   Peace- " Yay, peace and quiet."      Meat- "Steak is a wonderful meat."   Meet- "When I meet a person with horrible grammar, I run."         Now, I understand there is internet lingo.       Like- "Skool sucked today dude I wish I didn't have to be there.    But there is a huge difference when it comes out like this   "Skool sucked today dude I wish I didn't have too be their.

20090203154935AAmi54z	Pregnancy & Parenting;Baby Names	Baby Boy Name Opinions?	Ok I know I have asked opinions on boy names before... but i still haven't found one lol. I planned on naming my son Aiden Joseph Green but i am finding the name to be quite popular. I love the name. Also i like Hunter Joseph Green. If i could get your opinions and maybe some other names that would be great :)  but the middle name has to be Joseph and the last name is Green. Thanx ;)
20090203154753AARBr3k	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	What should I do about my husband and my newborn?	Ok  Im really wanting some opinions. We have a one month old baby and I really wish my husband was a little more involved but I don't know if Im being selfish. Ok he does one night feeding but I always hear him complain and get aggervated with the baby when he cries. I wish if he says he is going to do it that he don't feel obligated to do that he would want to do it with out complaining. I don't really know if I would be considered a stay at home mom because I go to night school full time and I sell avon I added it up and I make as much money as if I was working 10hrs a week which is about  as much as I could probably fit in with school, the baby, and house cleaning. I do wish I had just 30mins to an hour by myself. But he always makes it seem like a chore if I ask him to hold him he always wants time to himself but when he is around he sings to him changes some diapers and only if I ask he holds him but he always wants me  right by his side though he has him I can't go nowhere or he's ready to give him back. I read a lot of past questions that were similiar and they said men like the toddler stage. I think they need to bond a little better because at night the baby crys and crys when he has him. The baby don't do that with me. So then he says that the baby don't like him,I tell him he would if you spent more time with him. He works 6 hours at fed ex and 5 at a different job but he just started that one so now he has even less time. So what is your opinion on the situiation because I don't know sometimes I feel selfish then other times I think I didnot do this by myself.

But, when she has a chance, she always has to tell the others anything that is embarrassing about me, since we are spending a lot of time together.
20090203154821AArc0hi	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	How can I help bring on labor?	My due date has already passed and I'm so ready to have this baby already. This is my 3rd pregnancy and I thought I would've already had her by now. My doctor already said if I didn't go into labor myself I will have to get induced in 5 days. I've heard of things that will help bring on labor but I've already tried and nothing seems to work. I've tried walking, sex and nothing happens. I've heard of a tea that you can drink but I'm not sure what kind. I know it'll be worth all the waiting when she finally gets here but I'm getting impatient and uncomfortable.

20090203153245AArGP6b	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Feed on demand or waking my 5 week old to feed?  ?	I am a first time mom and my five week old little guy can sleep for four to five hours during the day (wish he could do that at night, but he only goes for two to three at night).  The pediatrician stated my baby is healthy, but needs to be woken up to feed every two to three hours to be fed.  I would like to feed him on demand, but do get worried when he goes for five hours without waking up thus i wake and feed him.  My son is not underweight nor does he have any medical concerns.  In fact, my breastfed child probably weighs almost 13 lbs now--he was 11.3 lbs at his two week check up--which is when the doctor told me to feed him every two to three hours.  Doc is not concerned with his size, in case anyone is wondering.         What has been your experience with feeding on demand vs. waking up a newborn?  How are you feeding your child?
20090203153212AA9K3UD	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Just started breast feeding again...?	My daughter is 8 weeks old, and I have been pumping for the last 6 weeks, and supplimenting formula. However, we are on our last bottle of formula, and I have begun breastfeeding again, like 3-4 times/day, and I am trying to breastfeed as much as possible. However, I am still supplimenting because she is still hungry after she feeds, when I am pumping I am only getting 1.5ounces out of each breast, every 3 hours. However, when feeding from a bottle my daughter is eating 6-9 ounces per feeding *lil chub! :)       Is there any way to get my milk supply up so I can try breastfeeding her??      I work 3 days a week, and my husband is home with her during those 3 days, so I still need to pump, and I want to try freezing/storing some breastmilk, because when I go back to school next summer my baby girl will be in daycare hence needing milk. I don't want her having formula anymore, I got discouraged after a couple weeks of breastfeeding.. :( so now I want to try breastfeeding as much as possible (I guess I missed the bonding).       Anyways, tips on getting milk supply up? I feed every 3.5 hours, and pump in between feedings.      Also, other than prenatal vitamins, can I take other vitamins like Vitamin C tabletts, or other vitamins? I have a horrible immune system and keep getting sick and I dont want to get my daugther sick!      Thank you soooooo much! I'm so happy she didn't get nipple confusion with the bottle, she takes to the breast like she has been breastfeeding all along! :)

20090203154642AAifO3m	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Do you think its right to have a baby if you cannot afford costs before its born or after?	This is an unplanned pregnancy,  We were having safe protected sex.      Now no one I know just has sex when they want to make a baby, so im sorry if sounds cheeky but i dont want to hear you shouldnt be having sex then.       If all a person can afford is food and rent money and no other spending on anything else, and is struggling to afford doctors appointments and scans, getting a place to stay, so therefore to meet the basic needs is it right to bring a child into the world.   Im not asking for people to say go ahead have an abortion, but im asking what is the right thing to do, would it be getting help from organisations, support groups, family.   adoption is not an option. What would be the best thing to do in this situation?I have worked more thinking of money i will need to save and things but it is not good at all
20090203153115AAiMH2T	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Honest opinions please - strange symptoms?	Some background: My cycles have varied in length since I stopped taking the pill. I had a 28 day cycle, followed by a 35 day cycle and am now on day 30. Yesterday I had a little blood on the tp (sorry if tmi, but need some advice) and today had blood on the tp with some cm twice today). I feel miserable with aches and some bloating and cramping and bbs have been sore for about a week. I am so tired and have monster headaches. Could this be implantation bleeding or is AF just teasing me? If I average out the cycles, I would be about two to three days early.   I don't want to test, but really am looking for opinions on the implantation bleeding. Has anyone had it? What was it like? Were there also typical period symptoms like the cramping, etc? Please share. And yes, we have been ttc for a few months.

Ok I recently found out my girlfriend was about 5 1/2 weeks pregnant, she had an ultrasound that confirmed the fetus and a heart beat. she was scheduled to have a follow up about a week and a half later (today) as I was waiting, for about 30- 45 minutes my girlfriend comes out with a sad face, i knew something was wrong. we went out side and she told me that the baby haddent grown and they couldnt find the heart beat.  now We have to wait a day to go get another ultra sound to confirm maybe there was no mistake. Its a note that my gf said the lady who gave her an ultra sound was apparently in training, so that gives me hope that things are ok but with the no growth, my hopes are fading . So is there possibilities the baby dosent grow from about week 6-8  and no heart beat could be found? thanks

How people act like condoms are magic and they solve all problems.                  HPV is caused by skin to skin contact and it can cause genital warts are cancer. 4,100 died from it last here and 20 million have it. Many don't know it until months laters. That alone made aware of the danger of being sexually active these days. So is anyone else saving themselves? It's the right choice.
20090203155535AAKpxub	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	If finally wants to see his girls!?	Most of ou know my story but for those of you that dont here it goes..   Im 15..and the father is 17..we had sex once..i got pregnant..he denied our daughters..his mother KNOWS he is the father..      Kay..so i talk to his mom often  ..and she has somehow gotten him to believe the girls are his (which they defiantly are)..   His mother said he wants to see them..    But my only issue is that last time we even saw each other..(i was about 6 months pregnant) we got in this huge fight..and the cops ended up being called..(not a physical fight..a verbal one)   and hes a pot head..so im not to comfortable with him being around our daughters...   and i absolutely dont want to be around him..       Should i get his mom (who has already seen her granddaughters) to stay with him while he sees them?      Any advice?
20090203160320AAMqXvv	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Have you ever had this??	Had 2 positive OPK's (ovulation tests)?    I tested positive on friday at 1pm and today Tuesday at 8pm.  Why is that???      ps they were definitely positive as result line was much darker than control line.   I am not on any medication either, nor do i have pcos.  Why would this happen, this is my first month of using them, first opk was friday when i tested positive.
20090203162944AALqzkp	Pregnancy & Parenting;Other - Pregnancy & Parenting	Do you think I might be pregnant?	So I am not good at keeping track of my period and all that good stuff. My husband and I have been married for 2 years and I have gotten to the point where I am ready to have kids but he would still like to wait another year. So anyways, I normally have a full 7 days of my period but this month I had only 3 or 4 and they were all pretty light. Very abnormal for me. I am on birth control so even more my periods are pretty normal all the time. So this one weird period has me thrown off guard. The past 2 days my back has been hurting as well as my stomache. Am I just being paranoid?

20090203162558AAF9XEF	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	This is driving me nuts! Please help?	A little long, but hang with me.      So my period is 10 days late. Right now I am bleeding very light. It's either pink or reddish brown. It's certainly not enough to fill up a pad or tampon - sorry if TMI. Anyway, this has been going on for three days now.      I have had cramping, but it's very light and not at all something I would experience or expect on my period. I have had a lot of symptoms of early pregnancy, yet I took a pregnancy test again just this morning and it came back negative.       My period is generally very regular; 31 days usually. I keep track of my cycles on a calendar. I don't have too much stress in my life right now. I mean there are some things that can be hard to deal with and are sort of complicated, but it isn't anything new. There was one time in the last six months that my period was late - but I was going to school and working at the same time; things were pretty crazy.       I don't feel like anything is wrong or alarming me enough to go to the doctor right away - so please don't go suggesting that right now or give me crap about not wanting to go. It costs money and right now I am tight on cash. I would just like to get opinions on what you think could be going on.       I am sexually active, but my boyfriend lives in a different city and its been two weeks since I saw him. Is it possible that I am pregnant and it's just not showing up yet?      Thanks for your help.

(I don't really like her but she is friends with my other friends). We haven't got invitations yet but she has told us about it. She says our parents are also invited.      Details:   - Her mother is really strange (swears alot has heaps of tattoos and and peircings), she is the type of person that would pressure us into drinking. I don't like her and niether does my mum   - I am not sure if my parents would let me go   - If I do go I am not taking my parents (niether are my friends)   - I don't want to go and get drunk like she wants everyone to.   - If I don't tell my parents that people will be drinking, they might find out when I get picked up.      Questions:   - Do I go?   - Do I drink?   - What do I tell my parents?   - What do I say to not be pressured into drinking if i go?

We were careless and ended up with second child. He is still not bonded with the baby like he should be. Well a couple nights ago, the condom broke, i took the morning after pill. He decided to tell me tonight, that if the pill doesn't work and i end up pregnant, he wants a divorce because he can't handle having a third child. I am just at a loss, i have no idea what to think, i am just completely at a loss.      (repost-wanted more responses from different people)      Sorry, i am just so stressed, i have no idea what to do. I don't know what to think, I don't know if he needs support from me because he is just stressed or if he really is just a jerk, I don't know.

20090203155808AAF1eml	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	How do I hide that I feel really sad from everyone or do I really need to get help?	I try so hard sometimes to be the normal 13 year old girl my parents expect me to be. I can get though the days usually without to much pain, but night is so much harder there is no one there that I have to play strong for and I fall apart whenever I'm alone. Sometimes I leave class if it gets to bad and go and cry in the bathroom if no one else is there so that I feel a bit better. I have 2 best friends who I would talk to about it but you see I don't want to hurt them to much, they are sisters and soon their mom is going to have them all move out of state. I've spent 2 summers at their house and I don't know if I can live each day without looking forward to seeing them both on the weekend. It will hurt either of them if they know how much this will hurt me they have known me since almost 1st grade and they are like family. They are going to move closer to thier family it will be a good move for them. In 2 years my other sister goes off to coledge and I'm left her in this house with my parents. My whole world revolves around my best friends and my sisters so now it's colapsing. It has been this way for sience the start of school. I don't really have many friends who like being with me at my school. I'm the girl eveyone knows for skipping though the halls and comforting everyone who I can. So what do I do when I find it so hard to be who I've always been? I don't know if can bear it. But, it will hurt my parents if thier youngest girl is hurt. Nobody knows how I cry all alone at least 3 or 4 times a week... what can I do to stop it before it's to late and I have to tell someone?

I had a 28 day cycle, followed by a 35 day cycle and am now on day 30. Yesterday I had a little blood on the tp (sorry if tmi, but need some advice) and today had blood on the tp with some cm twice today). I feel miserable with aches and some bloating and cramping and bbs have been sore for about a week. I am so tired and have monster headaches. Could this be implantation bleeding or is AF just teasing me? If I average out the cycles, I would be about two to three days early.   I don't want to test, but really am looking for opinions on the implantation bleeding. Has anyone had it? What was it like? Were there also typical period symptoms like the cramping, etc? Please share. And yes, we have been ttc for a few months.

20090203160831AAFibVH	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Is it wrong to ask your child to try food?	My gf and I are kinda arguing about how we grew up. We are planning on getting married sometime and having children. I say that I would like my children to try everything (food wise) whether they think it looks "nasty" or not. I thought liver and onions looked aweful, but my mom asked me to at least try a small bite, I did and I LOVE LIVER AND ONIONS!!! Growing up my family didnt have a lot of money, so it was eat or dont eat at all. My gf on the other hand grew up with a good amount of money and could pick and choose. If they were having Liver and onions and she thought it was gross, she could make a hamburger. I want to eat and do things as a family. Is it really that bad to ask your child to try something even if he/she doesnt think it looks good? or is that force feeding your child (according to my gf)? Any advice how to handle this??

20090225070126AAoxQPM	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Should I Throw Her a Baby Shower?	My husband and I have been married for nearly 3 years, trying for a baby the whole time, and just this past Sunday found out that we are finally pregnant after 3 rounds of Clomid and a long time of stressing about it and one miscarriage.  My best friend Mary married my husband's cousin this past fall, and found out that on their first month trying, are already pregnant and due in October.  (We'll be due the very end of October or mid-November).      So, I've know that Mary is pregnant for nearly a month now, and I am still having difficulty determining whether or not I should offer to throw her a baby shower.         Why I'm against it:   Money is tight.  Really tight.  How can I afford to have 10-20 people over for a party where I'd need to supply food and drinks?   Previous to knowing our own news: I was jealous that it wasn't me.  Not so much a factor anymore.   Now that she's family, isn't it rude for me to throw it, since family throwing a shower is like asking for gifts?  Except I still consider her friend before family, so this argument in my mind isn't very strong.   My husband hates having parties, and he would have to help set up for it, given my own condition.   What if I have a miscarriage between now and then?  Wouldn't that make it that much harder to throw a baby shower for her?       Why I'm for it:   She's my friend; my best friend.   Selfish reasoning - so she will throw me one.   I love throwing parties.  And given the time of year, it would likely be over the summer, so we could have it outside and not be so crammed into our tiny house.   I could keep the foods really simple, just beverages and cookies or something...       What are your thoughts on this?  I've thought about asking my husband's aunt (Mary's mother-in-law) for help in throwing it - asking her to chipping in money and things, but I tried that with Mary's sister-in-law's baby shower and got completely tossed out of the process.  She loves planning parties too, and takes me out of the picture.  Not what I want.  Plus, she really is family.  No arguments about it.  But Mary doesn't really have any other friends in this area, where all the rest of our family lives, so it's not like there is someone else to share the expenses with...        Any advice or suggestions are welcome!  Thanks!
20090225065858AAzjFvq	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	18 month old baby going to nursery?	Hello. My 18 month old just started nursery. He went for everyday from 8am to 11.30. Since I couldn't drive him to tots' group once a week I thought I would just get him into the kindergarten so that he could have friends to play with all the time. The first day he cried when I left but he stopped right after a teacher held him. Each day was getting better. I thought by a week he would really love to go to nursery but when I just got to the gate he would start screaming and he still cried when the teacher took him in. He stopped a bit later I could see and he was playing well. But I still couldn't help wondering if it was a bad idea to take him to nursery this early. Would it affect him for the future? How much longer should I expect him to be happy to go to nursery? I am so confused please help!!!

I usually have a cycle that lasts 25-28 days. My question is my doctor has booked my in for an ultrasound on Sat 14th March and I will be 6 weeks and 3 days pregnant, is this to early to have an ultrasound, will the doctor see the heart beat or should I be prepared that it might be too early and not panic. I am confused because technically the baby would only be 4 weeks not 6 because of the two weeks between LMP and Ovulation, which makes me think that this ultrasound will be to early to see anything..

My mom thought it would mean a great deal to her mother (my greatgrandfather's daughter) if she named me after him, so she did. Lonnie is typically an old-fashioned boy's name, but I mean, I guess there's the actress Loni Anderson....I go by Loni as a nickname a lot, since people found out it's my first name. It's even become a joke for people to say to me in the halls "Mow Your Loni". Ahaahaha.      I don't know. I just wanted to hear some opinions.

So now my son is 9 months old and my fiance and I planned on getting married in Sept!... Well, we just found out I was pregnant AGAIN. On top of that, we just got a puppy. So now I am 6 weeks pregnant, have a 9 month old, a fiance that I SHOULD be married to and a puppy. I still have my full time job and so does my fiance but I have No idea what I am going to do. I feel like a complete failure and my family is going to look down on me more than I can even start to explain. My aunts, uncles, cousins, sisters... They are all smart, are in school for big things and then there is me. I feel like I have no where to turn. I am going to be too Busy to do anything even closely related to school. What do I do? I feel like a mess. Don't get me wrong... I love my life. My family is my World, I would die for them.

With my first pregnancy I had my first appt at 8 weeks and had the ultrasound the same day. We live in a different area now so I am wondering if this is the usual- having the ultrasound at the first visit or if it could be at a later time, too?
20090304180851AA9amGC	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	What should I do? I dont know what to do anymore.?	My husband is a great father. We have a two year old together, we are planning on buying a property, and nothing is going our way, everyone wants to simply make money off of us and noone seems to be telling the truth when it comes to loans and properties. I am a stay at home mom and I go to school full time, the property and loans are all on me to figure out, on top of that I have my son and school. My husband doesn't understand that its hard, and he gets mad when something doesn't go his way. He takes it out on our son or on me, not physically but simply by getting frustrated with everything. I don't know how to make this right anymore. I have tried talking to him but its not working, I am just so frustrated. I am behind on homework and I can't take care of my son like I use to because all of the stress. I am taking antidepressants because of this. I can't seem to get a hold of my self, and I just want to give up, and leave and come back when this is all over. I can't do it.

20090304175721AAf2idJ	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	When do you think baby will come?	I know there's no way to know, but I'm just curious what you think based on your experiences. Just for fun. :)      I'm 36 weeks 1 day pregnant with my second child. I am 1cm dilated, 25% effaced, and the baby is "quite low" in my pelvis. (They didn't tell me a station.) I'm very excited that he's dropped. My daughter never dropped because she was posterior (sunny-side up) and I ended up going into labor at 41 weeks, and having a very long, difficult labor that ended in a c-section because she couldn't fit through my pelvis facing the way she was. I'm hoping for a vbac this time, which means he has to be in the right position. The fact that he's dropped is giving me hope. :)      Anyway, based on your experiences, when do you think I might go into labor?

In the beginning I will use these during the day so we don't have puddles on the floor but can still feel wet unlike pull-ups.  For night I need liners or doublers.  This is where my knowledge ends.  The lady making these on ebay doesn't make the doubler/liners.  What do I need to buy?  I will say that currently we have to use Huggies Overnights so he doesn't leak.  He is a heavy wetter.  So where do I look and what do I buy?  She said hemp or microfleece will keep him the driest.  Anyone have any experience with these?

20090304180909AAsoEA8	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Night weaning our co sleeping baby....questions...help!?	We are night weaning our 8 month old co sleeping baby.....he has slept with us since birth but he has become very restless and also I have become a zombie during the day with the frequent nursing, sometimes every 15 minutes-1 hour he is up!  So, this past week, we have been GENTLY night weaning him (thanks to everyone who gave me ways to do this last week on Yahoo Answers).  He fusses and cries (with me there) but I have been going longer and longer stretches with him not taking the boob in order to get back to sleep.  He is slowly getting used to being rocked or pat, instead of nursing to fall asleep.  It has been ONE WEEK.  He still is waking up like habit every 30 min-1 hour, so it has been EXHAUSTING...but I am keeping with it so that eventually he will learn to self soothe without the boob and will begin to not wake up so much.      My question is this: for those of you that have night weaned successfully, how long will this take?  How long can I expect him to continue to wake up every hour?  I thought that once he no longer expects the boob at night, that he would eventually not be wanting to wake up anymore for it?  I don't mind 1-2 or even 3X waking up but 10 times a night is impossible for my hubby and I.  So, I am hoping this will all end soon.....are we looking at weeks or months of the frequent wake ups or will he start to get it soon?  I am sooooo tired but am willing to continue this process if there is hope around the corner.  Please help.

20090304175942AAbYUw8	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Early pregnancy symptoms?	Okay this is not an "Am i pregnant question" so please no rude answers.         My first pregnancy was a surprise, and all i really remember about having early preg symptoms were sore boobs. Husband & I are TTC our second.       Today i was in wal-mart with my daughter & mom, and got really faint feeling. Assuming i was just hungery, the 3 of us went to grab a bite to eat, and i STILL felt faint. Eventually the faint wore off for a few hours then i came home and soon after felt faint AGAIN.  I decided to run to the store for a test, i got it and took it as soon as i came home only to get a negative test. Soon after that i started cooking dinner and got faint feeling again. I kind of thought it would be too soon to test today because my AF isnt due until friday. my boobs are a little sore right now, but its just mainly the right one. Maybe i just tested too soon? Could the faintness be early pregnancy symptom? Im planning to test sunday morning if AF is here by then...

20090304180716AA0HkVA	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Question about becoming a parent?	I'm open to the idea of adoption (I was adopted) my wife not so much...What now?      Sorry this is so long      I asked a similar question in the adoption section the other day.      Okay I was adopted when I was young by my grandparents. My mom was not capable of caring for a child (infact she never grew up) and my dad well he had his own demons.      Both my parents died sadly 6 months apart from each other just as I was really getting to know them (they were in and out of my life my whole life)      I keep telling my wife if it turns out we can't have a biological child of our own I am fine with adoption. And that way we don't spend all that money on fertility treatments and if they fail well then we would still have the money to adopt.      My wife however isn't too fond of the idea of adoption. She grew up with her mom and was adopted by her stepdad and she hated that. Her mom wouldn't let her dad see her (she said he needed to grow up) well now she does know her father. She says growing up she wishes she had her mom and her dad.      She says she wants our child. Our biological child. She doesn't even want to consider the idea of adoption. Every time I bring it up she changes the subject.      I understand she wants our child, the child that we make. But she doesn't even want to consider the what ifs.      How can I show her the benefits of adoption?      How can I get her to think about adopting?      If we never have kids yes I'll be sad but I knew going in she was iffy on even wanting kids so I should atleast be happy that she is willing and wants to have a baby. I love her unconditionally either way. But I would like to have a kid one day, either ours biologically or ours through adoption.      How to get her to warm up to the idea? Hopefully we will be able to concieve our own child because I know she wants nothing more than to have our baby.         ________________________________      I wanted to mention one of my grandparents didn't want to adopt me. My grandfather was against it completely but he warmed up to me pretty quick and the day he died he said I was the best choice he ever made      I know my wife would come around eventually if she would just open up to the idea.      She is just so convinced that it will happen for us. She doesn't want to think about the what ifs      I can live without kids but I just want to do whats best for her. And I know she wants to be a mom      I mean I went into the relationship and this marraige knowing that we may never have kids. When we met she didn't want kids at all. So I am glad she atleast wants a baby. If I can't give her that I atleast want her to be able to be a mom since that is what she claims to want.         I just want to have a plan if we can't get pregnant. I hope we can.      How do I convince her not to close off the idea of adoption altogether?

I had my son 5 months ago, so I'm not sure if it could just be old blood, or if I am just having a light light period. We use condoms, but I still have a feeling I may be. My question is, has anyone else had this instead of their period before after having a baby? Is this normal, or do you think it may be implantation bleeding??
20090304175845AAv45S8	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Confused...Please help!?	First of all I am on birth control and I also use a condom EVERYtime.  I didn't get my period the week I was supposed to (feb 22-28).  I have all of my usual PMS symptoms just no period.  Also I took a pregnancy test on feb 28 (the last day of the week i was supposed to have my period) and it came back negative.  However, I still haven't had my cycle yet.  My pill says it is common to miss a period or have a late period during the first few months of starting the pill however, i have been on BC in general for a year and this particular pill for about 6 months.  So my question...Pregnant or Not?

I have severe post partum depression and I'm taking herbs to help. I still have a hard time with anger, irritation and sadness. My son is almost a year old and I have slammed a few doors in front of him, and I have screamed, and I have made him cry by that.       I love him more than life itself and would never harm him physical but I did scream a few times and made him so upset he cried more. Is he traumatized??? Because I love him and I don't want him to be affected by this. I cant help the depression and even with meds I still feel upset a bit.      What do you think? Is he scarred for life because of my depression? No one helps me with him, just me and him and its very hard for me to do alone all the time.

20090304182328AAjyc5Z	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Mirena IUD?? Or is it something else?	Okay, so me and my girlfriend have been dating for almost 2 years, and we've been having sex for over a year and a half. She just recently got off birthcontrol, and her doctor recommended her to get this thing, that I can only find as under what she described as Mirena IUD. A white hook like thing. She got off birthcontrol, and went to the doctor and had this put in. We had sex, and she had her period that month. We have continued having sex and her period should be coming sometime this week. But I'm a little worried. I'm not 100% sure how this thing works, and I'm not sure if she will be protected from getting pregnant..but If her doctor recommended it, and its supposibly 99.9% effective, then I'm trying not to worry. Other than the fact, she has had lower abdominal pain, almost nonstop all the time, bad headaches, feeling nasueas alot..mostly at night she says. And to me that looks like pregnancy symptoms..but this products website says that it can cause all those things...she even has some mood changes as far as i can see..Should i be able to trust this product? Is there other products like it that arent as reliable that she might have gotten from her doctor? Help please :]

20090304182817AAXltqm	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Feeling alone during pregnancy? husband and bars?	Am I overreacting?      I'm almost 5 months pregnant and already feel really alone.   DH has been a party-er all his life.    Worked at bars, strip clubs, everything under the sun.   He has one lovely daughter who we split time with her mother.   But, even though he knows it hurts me, he goes out to bars and gets drunk. Not just drunk, passes out in his car drunk. Sometimes he doesn't come home until past 5.   I sit here alone, at home, by myself. He knows it upsets me, he sees it in my eyes. And every time he does it, he says he won't ever do it again. But the next time he's out, it's the exact same thing.      I just want to know if I'm over-reacting and shouldn't feel this way, or if I'm justified?      I just feel like since he's already got his weekends filled for other reasons, he should be spending his time more wisely and not spending our already limited income. Not to mention that I feel he should be supporting me while I feel like a blimp with backpains. Do I not compare? Does he just want to see the size 2, non blimpy girls?      Am I wrong?

20090304184209AA2SBL1	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	How would you react to this situation?	Usually my husband takes me to all of my appointments. But, I have an ultrasound that the doctor insisted on me getting THIS week. The only time that they could get me in was Friday at 3pm. My husband works 3pm-midnight. So, he can't take me. He can't even take time off because they have been laying ppl off like crazy at his job, and he doesn't want to seem like a weak link to the company. So, I had to ask my mother. She agreed yesterday. But, then she called me today and told me that she bought me some cloths because she doesn't want to be embarrassed by how I look at the ultrasound. First of all, we're not poor and I don't dress badly. I only have three pairs of maternity pants, which embarrasses her and she thinks that I should cover up my baby bump WAY more.. she thinks basically I should drench myself in fabric and be embraced that I am not a twig or thinner. She also told me that she's demanding that I go get fitted for a different bra because I'm "all over the place" and it's embarrassing to be seen with me.      First of all, I'm 29 weeks pregnant. Second of all, I'm only 5ft 2inch.... I'm a small person for such a big baby. My husband is 6ft one and it's clear that the child will take after him. One of the reasons that I have to have this ultrasound in the first place is that I'm carrying two times that fluids in utero than expected and they think that I may be furhter along than my original due date stated.       I already have major image issues and self esteem issues due to pregnancy. I don't like being larger. But, I try not to put myself down ro dwell on it because when I do I stop eating again. So, I try to tell myself that being short means that  you show more.       But, why is being pregnant emberasing. Why should I have to have cloths that she bought me to go to an ultrasound.       Why do I feel so tremendously hurt right now. Maybe I'm being hormonal. I don't know.But, I'm angry and hurt all at the same time. I don't know how to respond to this situation. I wish I could just tell her where to shuve her cloths and take myself to the appointment.. but my husband will be taking our only car to work.. so I can't take myself. :( Until we get our other car worked on next week. *sigh* What should I do???

20090304185049AA90lO9	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	My Obstetrician appointment today left me paranoid!!?	Hey, I'm 24 weeks & 4 days & had my first obstetrician appointment today.  The medical student that was with me 1st told me where the baby's head is & where his feet would be & then I realized that when I feel the baby kick it's always on the lower left hand side which would be the baby's arms I would assume & that I don't always feel the legs which she said would be curled up on the right hand side, now I'm paranoid that because I have never felt any strong kicks on that side that there is something wrong with the baby's legs!!  I can even see when he kicks me on the outside, it's really clear. I remember on the ultrasound (when I was almost 20 weeks) that he wasn't moving his legs very much (not like my daughter, who was very active at that time) but everything can't back good on this ultrasound... the doctor said it was perfect!  So is the baby's position always like that or do they flip around a lot?  Could he have been the opposite way at some point?  Do u think I am I being too paranoid or should I go back to my family doctor??  I don't see the OB for another 6 weeks!        Thanks

I am 39 weeks and up until 2 weeks ago the heartbeat was always found about an inch below my bellybutton and slightly to the left, now it can only be found about 2 inches above my bellybutton dead center?!?!? At my 33 week ultrasound she was head down. Just wondering if anyone has ever had a similar experience? My doctor says it doesn't mean she turned breech. I was dialated to 3 on Monday and 50% effaced, he also won't let me go over my due date because of previous health problems. I would hate to go in and end up with a emergency c-section because she is indeed breech. is there anyway I could request an ultrasound this late or will they do one once I go into labor to make sure the baby is in fact head down?

20090304185516AATOnmh	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Is this his baby...or is she lying?	Okay...I met my boyfriend on September 15th. We have been together ever since. Earlier this week his ex-girlfriend randomly sends him a letter including an ultrasound. According to him they haven't had sex since before labor day...she told me they had sex the weekend before we met (so like the 12th or 13th)...i want to believe my boyfriend but do not know. The ultrasound says her DATE OF CONCEPTION is October 1st and she is due July 8th (which is 40 weeks later exactly)...she had the ultrasound at 21 weeks and 2 days along. This is her second baby and will be a cesarion. She also says she doesnt know the sex of the baby?!?!      So my question is...by this time can the doctors date of conception be off by two weeks...is this baby his? He says it's not his because they haven't had sex since Labor Day weekend...but she insists its his. She admits that she was sexually active with someone else in October but she says she was already pregnant (ewww by the way).       If the doctor suggests the date of conception is October 1st...and he gives her a due date 40 weeks away in July...isnt it more likey that the baby was conceived later than the first instead of beforehand??      Please help! Ive read sooo much information on the subject but cant get it straight in my head!

20090304202547AAVRdJI	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Abortion, does this make you mad or what?	I just heard on the news about a girl in Miami FL who had went in for an abortion and was given the drugs. She sat in the waiting room so long that she had her baby on the chair. Then the doctor came in and knocked the baby on the floor, picked it up and put in a bio hazard waste bag and threw it away. That baby deserves a proper burial. I hope this opens up a lot of people's eyes on what the doctors think about the babies they are killing.
20090304190437AAXygNq	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	My step son and I are in a power struggle any ideas how to stop it?	so My wife and I got married back in august since then there has been this massive power struggle between him and I he his 9 and I feel plain and simple there shouldn't be one I'm the adult plain and simple. His parents were never together I mean when he was like 6 months but besides that they have been split up so it's not like the divorce is a recent thing. My wife is sick and tired of us arguing which for some reason primarily only happens when she is around. the big thing is when ever I tell him to do something or else he looses something I get a you can't do that you don't have the power I don't have to listen to you only mom can take things away from me. Like tonight we told him to go to bed about 20 times in half an hour his bed time is 9 he didn't go to bed until about 9:30 at the end I told him that if we had to tell him one more time he was going to loose his ipod which got him in the you can't do that only mom can which she ofcourse responded with if we have to tell you again you looses it and he responds with well he can't take it away only you can and he continued to stay up so I said go to bed and give me your ipod you were warned which followed several minutes of no you can't do that and I didn't get it until I told him I would take it away for a week if I had to tell him again. I'm sick and tired of this and so is my wife the problem is my wife NEVER disciplined him till I came along so he is used to getting his way and my wife doesn't allow me to enforce things the way they should be because he's her mother and I'm only his step father I don't have a say. can any one offer any advice on how to end a power struggle with out me being able to fully enforce rules?

Anyways, course I have complained about my family problems on here before and people have told me that it is abuse and stuff. But I honestly think it is just punishment for being a little punk. Of course I am a bad kid at times and sometimes I do hate my family, and all that other stuff, but is it just something in the USA that is illegal or what? Because I don't feel the need to call the cops about getting hit with a hanger or whatever. Though I do get pissed at times when that happens. But my Asian parents are very bi tchy, so yeah... Too lazy to explain. Not just my parents, but my older brother too. *Sigh* Everything is a mess -__-"      Just wanna hear what you all got

20090304210527AAbam9A	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	What to do when someone buys your baby diapers you can't use?	I have a dilemma. This really nice lady who is a friend of my MIL buys packs of diapers for my son periodically. I really appreciate the gesture, but the ones she bought, he can't use. He has a really chubby tummy and needs the kind with stretchy sides and he leaks through most diapers. The only diapers I've found (so far) that works for him are Huggies and Pampers. I feel really bad that the last couple of packs she bought I haven't been able to use. I donated them to a daycare center so they didn't go to waste. I don't know what to say about this without seeming ungrateful. So how do I say, thanks, but they don't work for him, without seeming rude?

20090304190406AA7LzAt	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	35wks & My hips go numb when I sit certain ways?	Hey! I am almost 35 weeks pregnant and when I sit 'indian style', with my legs bent to the side, with my legs in any position other than down, my hips go numb?!      This didn't happen with my first pregnancy and I've never read anything saying that it might happen. Has this or is this happening to anyone else?      Obviously when I notice my hips are numb, I switch positions. And then in the process of going 'unnumb' they kind of feel really hot and it honestly hurts just a little.      I go to the doc next week, so please no suggestions of me doing that UNLESS you honestly  think there is some medical emergency going on. I have a 2 year old and I'm an Army wife and my husband is in IRAQ. I don't really have the option to just go to the doc randomly.      So, thank you in advance for all the lovely, helpful answers! 10pts tomorrow evening!

20090304205353AAA6nPB	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Does your baby choose the worse times to be cranky?	I have had the absolute worst day ever. I got woken at 7 with a text message from the hubby saying he was leaving work and someone was driving him to the er. He had a HORRIBLE inner ear infection. The baby and I met him up there so I could take him home. They gave him percocet and a shot of morphine. I had SO many things to do today including 5 loads of laundry, a sink full of dishes, and about 6 errands to run. So I take my hubby home and his infection is sooo bad that he can barely walk straight, so of course I can't leave Piper with him..so I take her with me to run the errands. She screamed just about the whole 2 hours we were out. We get home and I realize I left bags in the buggy in the parking lot because I was so frustrated and in a hurry to get her home. So I feed her, put her in her swing and run to the store only to have to RE BUY the stuff. I get back home and she's still not napping...So I try and wash bottles and dishes, but she's whiney. Anyway, she only napped about half an hour all day. Then I gave her a bath, and she was eating and ALMOST out for the night..and she throws up really bad. So bad that it covers her and me and we both need baths...So we take the second baths, she eats a little more, and I put her in her bed where I have to sit holding her paci in her mouth til she falls asleep..which normally takes about 10 minutes, but took 45 tonight. She was sleepy and rubbing her eyes but kept kicking and jerking to keep herself awake. Ugh. If she hadn't went to sleep when she did my husband would have been woken up to maniacal laugher and me pulling my hair out while sitting in the corner rocking back and forth. She chose today to be a cranky butt when I had NO help and SO much to do. Oh the joys of mother hood.      My question after my little rant...Do your babies choose the WORST days to be little stinkers, or does Piper just have it in for me?

20090304200537AAIPArE	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Why am I so baby crazy?	My husband and I are putting our house up for sale. We need a bigger home to start a family. Hopefully will be trying later on this year. However, all I can think about is babies. I've been like this for over a year. I make my husband go with me to look at baby clothes, car seats and strollers. Everytime I see a baby in public, I go up and say hi to it. If I get a good vibe from the mom or dad, I ask the baby's name and how many months old it is. My husband and I already have names picked out and we're not even trying til later this year. Also, is it normal to start having meternal instincts before pregnancy? I just turned 29, could this have anything to do with why I've gone so nuts?

For example, if you were "supposed" to ovulate on the 22, and you had sex on the 25th or 26th and it was unprotected and he ejaculated in you and you had gotten pregnant?

20090304200208AAnjdKp	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	PUPPPS [Help.?] It's Driving Me Mad.?	I'm only 6 1/2 weeks pregnant and I woke up with "hives" all over me in random places. They're around my elbows,my stomach,legs, etc. Anyways I went to the doctor today and he said it was PUPPPS [not my obgyn but primary doctor]. I did some looking up online because all I have is tylenol and benadryl. This is so painful and annoying. I looked up PUPPPS and it says that the earliest it's been found is at 20 weeks. I guess I'm a little confused? Has anyone ever seen this at this early into pregnancy? Also on top of the hives my fingers,feet and toes are swollen. Not horribly but I can't get my rings off for the life of me which started out being almost to big for my fingers. Also does PUPPPS cause muscle/joint pains.? My arms are throbbing and feel like I've torn every muscle in them as goes the same for my legs and feet I couldn't even walk before I started taking tylenol.
20090304200301AAoGh9I	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Does anyone else one year old not sleep through the night?	My son is a few weeks past one and he still will not sleep through the night. Every night he is guaranteed to wake up at least once, sometimes twice. We've tried letting him cry but if you ever tried this with Lucas, you will find that you will give in long before he does. I'm just wondering if any other moms are going through this, or have gone through this, when will it get better?   My daughter was never like this. At 3 or 4 months, my daughter slept 10 or 12 hours (lucky, I know) but I think when Lucas was around 3 or 4 months and started to sleep through the night, I think he just said the hell with it. Let's make mom and dad's life miserable at night!

20090304203054AAyuqXA	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Why does it seem like my milk supply is less at night?	I am exclusively breastfeeding and I often feel like I have less of a supply in the evening (630-930).  I feel less let downs than I do in the middle of the day, he seems to swallow less and he takes both breasts equally before he is done.  During the day he takes the first one for 15 minutes or so, and then the second for a few more.  Just wondering if anyone knows why, or how to assist.  He often acts more frustrated at night during feedings as well.  By the end he is satisfied, but gets worked up during.  When I pump during the day after he gets his one bottle a day (gearing up for day care) I get at least 5 oz and up to 7.  BTW, he is 2.5 months old.  Any advice is appreciated.

Today I talked to my former best friend who moved away 2 or 3 years ago for the first time in like a year and half on AIM. He told me how my former and his current friend Ryan said "I changed." We where talking and hes still the same Matt who plays MMORPGS and love to draw, ride his bike, etc.       We where just asking each other questions, and hes learned that I now smoke pot, skateboard seriously, don't game no more like I used too, and have a totally new group of friends. To him I'm not even the same person anymore.       I was just wondering why I changed but him and my other former friends are still the exact same. Was the change a good or bad thing?   One more thing is that I don't feel if he moved back we could be friends because we grown so much apart.      I am 15 and half and he is 14 and a half if that helps any. =/

When she went to do it, it felt like a knife cutting me open down there and she really couldn't get it in, so she took it back out.  She let me go pee in a cup instead.  Well, later on this afternoon while out to dinner with my husband, I went to use the bathroom and when I peed, it hurt (like the pain I had when she tried to insert the catheter) and there was blood on the tissue when I wiped.  I called and talked to the nurse and she just told me if it hasn't stopped by tomorrow, to call back.  Is this normal at all?

20090304185615AA961Hx	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Is this normal? I am cramping all the time?	I am 8 weeks along and having mild cramps most all the time. They are low in my stomach, right above my pubic area. They are pretty mild most of the time, but last week I had a few that were pretty bad so I went to the doctor and got an ultrasound and he said everything was perfect. No spotting or anything either, I check several times a day. When I asked the doctor what the cramping was he just shrugged and said " you have other things in there besides your uterus." Is it normal to have some slight cramping this early? It seems to early for the round ligament pain. I did not have this before I got pregnant, so I really don't think it is something else. Has anyone else experienced this? This is my first baby after 2 years TTC and we got here with the help of fertility pills, so I am a little over protective.

20090304203506AAPenUs	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Pregnant, gaining weight, or what?	The last time I had my period was Jan.4th. I spotted a little in Feb. but there was never a flow. On occasion I get dizzy and have headaches. Sometimes I am nauseous. My breast are also sore sometimes, but not all the time. They seem to have gotten bigger. My stomach sometimes feels like it is getting tight (kind of hard to explain), my pants are also starting to fit tighter. I took a test in Feb. and there was a very faint positive line I took another one and it was negative. Do you think that I could be pregnant or am I just gaining weight or something else?

I have been on the pill for almost a year so don't really know what my natural cycle is like. I am now off the pill and want to know if I am at my most fertile time at the moment.      My last period started on the 20th of feb. and lasted around 5 days.      The last few days, my breasts have got a bit bigger. My skin has broken out with pimples, but I haven't got much CM like I usually have and I thought that was present when you are at your most fertile time.       Do you think now is my most fertile time? When do you think it would be?

We already have a 3 year old son.  Last Wednesday I had a shot of HCG and then last Friday I had an IUI.  I have been feeling really nauseous so my husband told me to take a pregnancy test.  I did and it was a positive the first line was lighter than the control line but there was definately 2 lines.  My husband got really excited but I told him that it may be a false positive.  Does anyone know how long a HCG shot lasts in your body.  I really want the test to be acurate but I am not going to get my hopes up just to get let down.  Thanks in advance

20090304190122AArcJVO	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	My daughter has separation anxiety?	My daughter is seven months old and lately she has become very clingy toward me, not wanting anyone else. I know that at this stage in her little life she has started to experience separation anxiety. I am a stay at home mom, so in my day to day life trying to do the dishes or vacuum or just run upstairs to throw some laundry in the laundry basket has now been accompanied by her crying and even when I come back down the stairs so she knows I'm there and I hold her and comfort her until she calms down. I can't put her back down without her dissolving into fits of tears and crawling after me crying as I walk into the kitchen or have to go to the bathroom. Is there anything that I can do to help her? Am I doing something wrong or have I done what I can? I just moved and at first I thought maybe her problem was she just isn't accustomed to the new place, but after a week she was fine and had no problems. We have been here for almost a month and she just started this behavior very recently. I just need a little advice.I can't keep putting off the house. I give her load and loads of attention, but she just goes to pieces over nothing.

20090304195955AAx6sRx	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Baby Fundraiser Help Please!?	Okay here is the thing. I want to start a fundraiser at my school to help the maternity women that live in a place called the Lighthouse. My thought was that I would hold it at school. I would talk to my StuCo and see if we could hand out 2 baby bottles to every homeroom.          Each homeroom will need to fill the bottles to the top with change. Once they fill the 2, I will provide more bottles. The homeroom with the most bottles filled at the end of the week will win a pizza party. I am going to talk to a local pizza place to see if they will donate pizza.           Once all the money is collected, I will take it to the lighthouse OR buy an expensive thing on their wish list. My dad will take a picture of the lighthouse home and i will try to get it into our school paper. It will include the fact that the pizza place helped us so that they get some publicity.             My question is, 1) is it a good idea? 2) what can make it better? and 3) I wanted to see if I could get other little competitions going to. Like maybe an assembly where the teachers compete in a baby related contest or another idea was that there could be a drawing. Like kids could pay 1.00 to put there names on a binkie and three binkies will be drawn each day of that week. Those are only ideas. Please help me think of other ways I could sponsor it throughout the week. Thanks so much!!!

20090304205158AAKCcJE	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Is it true that you cannot spoil a baby under 9 months?	My baby just turned 7 months old on march 3, and she still wont let me sit her down in her high chair, swing, bouncer, car seat or floor for more than 5 seconds before she starts screaming at the top of her lungs.  I really would like some suggestions on how to get over this.  It has been going on since she was 2 days old.  And just letting her sit there and cry for a while does'n't t work she just gets louder and louder and I dont want anyone to call the police on me.

20090304222024AAsmHAB	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	When in labor/giving birth, do the doctors shave you?	Yes, this is a serious question. I know a few generations back the doctors were obsessed with shaving the woman for the sake of "cleanliness" and to be more clean about it. But then, maybe 20 or so years ago, they were more focused on being "natural" about it - or not shaving. So, what do they do now? Is it up to the woman to shave, or do the doctors shave them anyway?

20090304085645AA52miB	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Tiny bit a spotting 11 dpo : TMI?	Yesterday made 11 dpo and I noticed when I wiped a very small amount of pinkish discharge mixed with creamy CM. I used a sterile q-tip of see if it was in fact coming from my cervix and not somewhere else, and it was. I though AF was coming early b/c I have given up hope of conceiving this month. But today, nothing... no pink, just white CM.  Could this be implantation bleeding? Or just random spotting.       All answers welcome, thanks in advance!
