Cl6KbcAGaa	If you are having this much trouble then take it to your local bike shop for help and a minimum charge for assembly. I am wondering since you say the mfg. website is not up yet" exactly what brand of "bike" you bought? If it is a childs bike being a bolt on wheel then just bend the fork outward to get it to fit and you will need another pair of hands to do this....otherwise take this thing back to the dept store you purchased it at and get that $ back. If you have purchased this bike for someone that is under 8yrs old then you will be fine, as it is likely a utility bike anyway aka: Throw-away bike. If youre having this much trouble with the front wheel then I hope you got thru the rear one ok???|`|JSGLKnA4aa	did you take the lock nuts off the front axle first? is the fork bent? take bak 2 where u got from an xchg or buy from real bike shop.|`|DOVbF4Piaa	Run the nuts out to the end of the axle with the washers.  Most of the time you have to spread the forks slightly to get the wheel in, that is normal.  Make sure you have the pedals on the right side, the one on the left will have left handed threads.  Make sure you put a dab of grease on the threads before you install them. This is a very good web site for any other questions you may have.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://bicycletutor.com/" rel="nofollow">http://bicycletutor.com/</a>|`|J9OUW7JRaa	super glue and duct tape!

ceebuRIIaa	what i do is use q tips|`|74Z162zmaa	Firstly, get a pot or something that the bearings will fit in and soak them in nail polish remover for 1 hour or so, then spin them dry. Fix the wheels back to the trucks and apply a tiny bit of spray grease (not much). DO NOT USE WD40 OR SIMILAR PRODUCTS!! it dries out the bearings. That is how to properly clean and grease bearings, hope i helped you

Dm507AxYaa	Hi! I'm so happy that your giving skating a try!<br>  <br>     Well, to answer your first question, since those boots are in the beginning skater category, there is virtually no break in time. This means that the boots are already pretty soft, so  it won't be painful at all while "breaking them in". <br>  <br>     I got the Blue Ribbon and had no issues except for them being a little stiff. To solve that problem just put on your blade covers and walk around the house in them. It "breaks them in" and you get used to the feeling. The first time you skate in them it will feel pretty awkward but after that it is fine. <br>  <br>      For lessons, make sure you wear a pair of sweatpants, long sleeved shirt, and a light sweatshirt. If you get cold easy you can wear a pair of tights under the pants and a heavier sweater. layers are also a great thing for skating because you can take them on and off how you please.<br>  <br>      When you first start lessons, you learn how to fall without hurting yourself or others, how to march, maybe stop and that's about it. If you find that the beginner class is too easy tell your teacher and they'll move you up a level.<br>  <br>     Good luck with skating, I love it and I bet you will too!|`|0yJyfpxQaa	the reason the hurt in the beging is they dont have the shap of your foot . so blow dry them son there are soft and put your feet in them tie the aces t=and walk around blow drying them will make them soft andwhen the cool they will cool in to your foot shape. <br>  <br>  answer mine: <br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AmIv5.gZv6qMD9ze3gQ8p7_sy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090304153956AAVUwZI">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|akA3oJx6aa	When you buy skates at your rink's pro shop they would usually offer free services to bake it, so it's warm and easier to mold to your foot. Don't try to wear ankle patches or anything to prevent blisters because that will get in the way of the correct molding. You always get blisters when you break them in, or things like skating in the wrong socks.<br>  <br>  You can't really make it easier or take short cuts in breaking in skates because it is probably the most important thing you do with a pair of skates. However, when you get blisters, just take care of them and put bandaids on, which won't affect the breaking in of the skates. Also, wear the correct socks and you won't get as many blisters.<br>  <br>  You may get blade guards and just wear them, walk around the house with them on, sit and watch TV with them on, there are many ways. Don't ever go guard-less on any surface besides the ice and the special floor designed for blades at skating rinks. However, the best way is to still skate in them, the walking around the house stuff is just for extra. Walking and stroking on ice are different.<br>  <br>  When your first start, they may teach you how to fall, and they will teach you how to stroke, do swizzles, half swizzles, stop, and more basic things. It will take a while before they start teaching you how to skate backwards.<br>  <br>  They won't actually teach you to fall over, but how to fall correctly, because if you fall some wacky way you are likely to be injured.<br>  <br>  Your coach at the rink can provide more information. Good luck, I hope this helps!|`|lnRMmSeyaa	who told you that?, they dont know what they are talking bout!, your skates arent a very high up brand so they shouldnt be very bad to break in at all, it will be alittle stiff to skate in and your ankle bones might be kind of sore when your done, but its not a "painful" experience, if you really want them to not be stiff at all i suggest getting them molded to your feet, that way you wont have to skate in them so straight, they will already be shaped to fit your foot, walking around in them and bending your knees alot will def. help also<br>  <br>  when staking for the first time in them just go slow, stroke around and just bend your knees, it will take about 2 monthes until you feel completely comfortable with them, but dont worry you'll be fine!<br>  <br>  <br>  figure skater of 6 years <3|`|h1dTg5C1aa	Just skate in them. They will break in to how you skate in them. Don't walk around in them to try and break them down it will only make them crease in places you don't want them to. Just skate and bend your knees. It wont take long to break in since you have a beginner boot.<br>  <br>  Work hard in your lessons and success will follow. <br>  <br>  Good Luck!!|`|GpdYgi4Zaa	I have bought a pair of skates..cant remember the name and they are not in this house there in kansas with my sister in law. shes a huge hockey fan so she got into ice skating and I bought a pair cause I could use them here in hawaii cause we have a place called ice palace.<br>  anyways..what the guy told me at the store when I bought them is they are supposed to be tight. but after like 20 hours of using them they will feel better. u usually have to warm them up after you buy them.|`|IsQckOXraa	I don't really think you'll go through major pain breaking in White Ribbon, since they are sort of a begginner boot and have some give in them already. <br>  If you got them online then go to your local skate shop and ask them to "heat- mold" the boot to your foot, that will help with the breaking-in process.<br>  After that they should be fine, and ready to skate in after 12 hours.<br>  If your have any more discomfort then you can purchase bunga pads to put on your feet.<br>  or put the hard walking gaurds on them and you can walk around with them on at your house.<br>  but don't go to extremes with trying to break them in since they aren't really a very stiff leather boot.<br>  for lessons, just go into it with an open- mind and be prepared to fall, if you're very new to skate they'll teach you the proper way to fall and get up, some stroking, and how to march. <br>  have fun skating!<br>  :)
IKot6k4Zaa	Personally,I like to skate,even though i don't get to very often,but still I find it very,liberating and it just gives me a free feeling.I don't know why,but it just does.<br>  Then I fall....<br>  bahahahahaaaa(:|`|2lakZBgiaa	its fun, and its a hobby, just like saying, why do people bird watch? or play tennis? its a fun way to hang out with your friends, and stay active and have fun. also, it could be the key to your success in life. like ryan sheckler, p rod, corey duffel, andrew reynolds.

5ab664e6b90f5ee64b2c8f30ff6a253daa	Mr. Hockey you are wrong. I think the wings did the good thing by not changing the roster. who would u add in goalie??? there is nobody and they dnt need anyone. osgood is a veteran he knows how to turn it around ei. last night. plus conks has been playing good as well. the wings have soo much depth they didnt need to make a trade. i think the biggest loser today was definitly one of two teams. Those teams are listed below with descriptions:<br>  <br>  Minnesota: First of all locking up backstrom good for them. great goalie and definitly worth it. but what else did they do? they are close to the 8th spot in the West and Gaborik is out until the playoffs which will have no meaning if they dnt get there. They are 28th in the league for scoring and needed to adress that issue. The needed to add a scorer to their forwards to give them that extra goal they need. Granted there defense is good but what happens if they cant score? their defense cant do it all!!<br>  <br>  nashville: They needed some scoring forward as well. they are 25th in  the league in scoring and also are dealing with some serious injuries. They needed to make a deal to get a scorer in there as well becasue they too are on that fine edge for 8th place in the west.<br>  <br>  imo those two teams were the biggest losers today and im pretty sure you can kiss there 8th seed goodbye because of it|`|ULw1777caa	The Pens were not losers by far.  Learn the game.  They have picked up their play of late, kept their core intact and got Guerin for basically nothing.  <br>  <br>  Leafs for sure.  Flyers didn't help themselves.  Overall, pretty bad.|`|e49064124148a09ea71e47cc14257a0aaa	The teams that didn't make any moves and the Pittsburgh Penguins. If they expect Bill Guerin to be the savior in Pittsburgh, Mario Lemieux has alot to learn. They are still in the playoff race but this deal is certainly no Marian Hossa addition of last year.|`|6vzpHTqQaa	Colorado Avalanche<br>  <br>  Traded Jordan Leopold to Calgary for a crappy defenseman and a pick.  Of course, if that draft pick turns out to be a gold mine, then maybe it isn't such a bad move.<br>  <br>  And, of course, the New York Islanders.  Bill Guerin dealt to Pittsburgh.<br>  <br>  My top answer though is Colorado.  Leopold is a good defenseman (Guerin's getting up there in age, anyway).|`|2PlJEJzQaa	Panthers<br>  <br>  Lets be serious here how far will they go into the playoffs? not likely past the first round if they do go on to make it...<br>  <br>  They could have traded Bouwmeester for some serious depth and future<br>  <br>  (i heard rumors of Flyers willing to give Lupul and Jones and a 1st draft pick) <br>  <br>  I think they should have traded him because he wont be returning to them next year as he will search for a serious contender as a FA<br>  <br>  <br>  I also agree with the Pittsburg comment...come on Guerin? no way|`|naZQqrNeaa	Like in a prior answer:<br>  <br>  The biggest losers are the Kings....they need help, but did absolutely NOTHING to improve or at lease change their situation.<br>  <br>  Edit:  Oops....spoke too soon, I didn't see the Williams deal.|`|d4JaNWrsaa	BLACKHAWKS!!<br>  <br>  They need a vertern forward like Rechi and they didnt get ANYONE!<br>  They better pick-up Gary Roberts or they will not succed in playoffs!|`|A9cE0Niaaa	I'm disappointed that the flyers got rid of scottie upshall and sent him to the coyotes for yet another agitator in daniel carcilo who is a minus 13 and only has 10 points meanwhile upshall is a really good player who is fast and can score even though he is having a little bit of a down season plus he has been hurt a couple times. Also why would the Islanders let Guerin go to a team in the same division as them that rarely happens at all.|`|QSShHlRiaa	Detroit By far<br>  they mad NO trades and <br>  personally i think that they should have pciked up another goalie<br>  incase Osgood cant step up to the plate.|`|F16cmjtMaa	Sens.. the only made one trade... they needed to definately make some BIG changes!
ZbNXVQu7aa	They have as good a shot as any other playoff contender, but I don't see it happening.<br>  <br>  As for who those other contenders are, here's a (very premature) list:<br>  <br>  AL Central - White Sox, Indians, Tigers, Twins<br>  AL East - Red Sox (they're my AL representative this year), Yankees, Rays<br>  AL West - LAA, A's<br>  NL East - Marlins (they're about due for another Wild Card and World Series), Mets, Phillies (I have them repeating this year)<br>  NL West - Dodgers<br>  <br>  The reason why I left the NL Central out of my list of "other contenders" is because the Cubs are the only team in the division in contention for the World Series.|`|WaaFCtuOaa	They can but their history says otherwise, sorry, but the as good as Cubs can be, they find a way to lose in play offs|`|VwccuEFHaa	i think the pirates have a better chance of winning than the cubs.|`|yk4S7uuraa	...the Mets!!|`|1a18a7a889b915031fe2a7c2d1631d62aa	On paper they should win their division without breaking a sweat. Once they accomplish that and get back into the playoffs they should start to try to win a playoff game first. I have been a Cub fan my whole life and have experienced all of the let downs in the last 30 years. Do they have a team that can win it all? Yes. Will this team be able to overcome all that goes with being the Chicago Cubs? That remains to be seen. If they come together and get past all of the talk of choking and the Billy Goat and curses then they will win it all. If they get tight like the last couple of years then they will experience the same result of the last 101 years: failure.|`|CuFmkAyDaa	Cubs will have another disappointing year like the past 100 years.

0SYM7diNaa	Rampage by KO, somebody needs to put Jardine in his place, I wish the Iceman would have but we all know how that ended. Rampage is a dominant striker and if he doesn't leave that leg out there for Jardine to tenderize, then he should have this fight won. <br>  <br>  Carwin: Im going with the underdog on this one. Don't get me wrong Gonzaga is an amazing competitor, but i have the feeling both fighters are gonna want to stand and bang. If this happens lights out for Gonzaga due to the fact Carwin packs a freakish amount of power behind them punches. And as somebody else already said Gonzaga is more likely to get gassed quicker, and if Carwin can mount it is all over. So Carwin by TKO<br>  <br>  Brown: Gonna be a good stand up fight, but i think Brown will be able to pick him apart. Brown by decision<br>  <br>  Hamill: Im not familiar with Munoz, but Im gonna go with hamill anyways. Hamill has heart along with alot of skill and power to go along with it. Possibly end up in a ground and pound situation. Hamill by TKO<br>  <br>  Maynard: Im hoping Maynard has been working on his striking as far as posture and whatnot cuz as far as wrestling you just cant ask for more from this guy. Im going with Maynard by submission.|`|dDas43FZaa	Technically, that's half the card.<br>  Rampage KO in 2nd<br>  Gonzaga unanimous decision<br>  Matt Brown submission 3rd<br>  Hammil split decision<br>  Maynard TKO 1st|`|qcS20U9eaa	Jardine<br>  Gonzaga<br>  Brown<br>  Munoz<br>  Miller?

Sell has got more power for his size.  Plus, he's better at BJJ if the fight goes to the ground.<br>  <br>  Hamill: he's more well-rounded and is a physical beast.  Munoz has a lot of potential, but he's never been in there with guys like Bisping and Franklin.<br>  <br>  Maynard: he'll do his normal blanket routine.|`|4gwSrPhfaa	Keith Jardine wins by split desicion, if he dose not get KO'ed in the first 3 min, i think Rampage might win the first round, but then jardine will win the last 2, Jardine has trickey striking he will come at angles, and he throws a **** load of leg kicks, and we all know jackson is horrible at stoping those, so once jardine gets going after the first this fight will be his <br>  <br>  Gonzaga will either submit or get the fight stopped by strikes in the late mins of round 2, i think that Carwin is a threat to most heavyweights but i think that if Gonzaga comes with his head half way screwed on right he should win this fight, both guys have KO power, both are big, however Carwin has good wrestling but his wrestling will not be able to stop Gonzaga's submissions for long <br>  <br>  Pete sell is the bigger fighter, i would not say that his striking is better then browns, but his jj might be, so i am going to say that Matt Brown will win by unanimous desicion <br>  <br>  Matt Hamill by TKO in the first round <br>  <br>  Ok , i really am not even 50% sure about this one but i think that Jim Miller will win by desicion , i mean Maynard beat Frankie Edgar who beat Miller but that was at the start of millers career, and miller seems to be the fighter with more experience who goes to finish the fight so i am leaning for him to win|`|AA11461754	Jackson(by knock out)<br>  Gonzago (by knockout or submission)<br>  Brown (by decision)<br>  Hamill(by TKO)<br>  Maynard(by decision)|`|Tdkx7fZpaa	Jackson via KO<br>  Gonzaga via Submission<br>  Sell via Decision <br>  Hamill via TKO<br>  Maynard via Decision|`|0OWduJaWaa	Keith Jardine by Decision.<br>  <br>  Gabriel Gonzaga by KO.<br>  <br>  Matt Brown by Decision.<br>  <br>  Matt Hamill by TKO.<br>  <br>  Gray Maynard by decision.|`|oeQVK0cmaa	Jardine via Split Decision<br>  Carwin via KO rnd 1<br>  Matt Brown via TKO rnd 1<br>  Matt Hamill via TKO rnd 2<br>  Gray Maynard via Unanimous Decision|`|zJC18FtAaa	Jardine by Knockout <br>  Gonzaga<br>  Brown<br>  Munoz <br>  Maynard|`|bnYGcFmDaa	rampage jackson- he came out really good in i think it was ufc 94  and he wants a title shot so he will win<br>  <br>  DONT KNOW THE OTHER GUYS, JUST WATCH THE BIG FIGHTS|`|3q8LkLLDaa	i want jardine but rampage will win heis better pretty much in everything
Ir7JA6IUaa	I've never skied Whitetail, but I've been to Liberty four times so far.  I just got back from there about 20 minutes ago actually. For beginners, it makes zero difference which one you go to.  They are so close together, I'd just go to the one that's the shortest drive, as they are owned by the same folks, they beginner programs are exactly the same.  I can't say which one is more picturesque, but from the top of Liberty you can see Three Mile Island, so it's a great view.  <br>  <br>  White tail has a few more trails than Liberty, but for a newbie skier, this makes no difference, as you'll probably stay on the beginner slope anyway.  The only thing I've really heard about Whitetail is that they have less ice, but as they are so close together, I really don't know why or how one could have better snow, as it's all machine made anyway.  <br>  <br>  So, pick one, and go have some fun!  Just remember to concentrate first on learning to turn, NOT going fast down the hill.|`|k1C70y8raa	I think that Whitetail is better, i have raced there and the beginner slope looked nice.

IWM1khX7aa	I would try to keep Cesc Fabregas but only if he's happy enough at Arsenal. He's young and he will be the next best center midfielder with the performance and leadership he has, so any team would want to keep him.  Arsene Wegner made Arsenal better, but he could have made them the best team on earth.  He had his chances and I don't think he's that good either.  The 6+5 rule takes place in 2010, and you can't have a manager who keeps on buying French players when Arsenal needs 5 more English starters (Theo Walcott counts as a starter, in my terms).  But I think both of them will leave after this season, in my opinion.|`|4BppP7Mkaa	Arsene Wenger no doubt.|`|ptP0E0Y2aa	Wenger No Doubt,

7In4FOVPaa	There is no exact way to answer this because there are alot of things you need to know about, you as a goalie, your coach, your age, the list goes on. I remember when i played goalie at the bantam level there where 2 goalies on the team, and i played every other game, but your coach might think it better to play you both half games, so if you want more ice time i say stay on the same team, but if you want a new experience try out for the other team.<br>  <br>  Good Luck.<br>  <br>  <br>  3 2 1 Hes Gone.|`|InIhFMLsaa	you are going to be on the bench beacuse you suck hahaha|`|HGohCuQgaa	For the most part if the team is competitive you will battle for a starting job like in the NHL, so whoever is better will start and play almost every game.  If the other goalie is already on the team chances are you'll spend at least the first half the season sitting the bench.  If it's not competitive then you will end up splitting the games in half.

S0u3HKzhaa	I agree,actually I kind of wanted to see Randy Orton vs Edge at Wrestlemania but I knew they weren't going to drop the McMahon Orton feud.But yeah I'd like to see two heels have a match.It something that we don't see often and the two heels would most likely not have feuded before so it would be a good new match.Instead of what we have seen time and time again Orton and Triple H have been going at it since Evolution and then had a feud in 2006 with the DX vs Rated RKO.And John Cena and Edge we have seen over and over too.(Although not complain about ether I'm actually interested in the feuds).But I would like to see a heel vs. Heel match.Well mostly because my three favourite current wrestlers are heel so I'd like to see them feud.But with the wwe aiming toward kids and the kids honestly hating the heels with a passion would not amuse them so chances of us seeing that at a PPV are slim to none.Although I would really like to see a heel vs. heel feud.Actually the match's I find very boring a lot of the times are face vs face and they have had no history together as heel vs. face.|`|QYWV4nehaa	Well as of now that may be what you are going to get. As of now it is Big Show vs Edge for the title. Even though I am not his biggest fan, I want Cena to face Edge instead. <br>  <br>  But I think it would be cool to have a heel vs heel match at Wrestlemania. But not a World title match. How about a smaller match so the fans would have someone to cheer for.|`|L3MkAG6Qaa	No. Heel VS. Heel doesn't work.<br>  <br>  But does that mean it wouldn't be interesting? No. I sure would like to see Edge VS. Jericho or Edge VS. Orton, but still, like I said, it doesn't work.|`|IgDCjui5aa	I would like to see one like edge vs christhan but that will never happen because the wwe creative team is so boring and have no creativity. the best they come up with is big show vs edge. i liked wwe when the rock was still here|`|vuyrIfiuaa	It would be interesting because of the characters egos involved. They would have to be super heels eg Randy Orton and Edge with fan bases in order to provoke reactions from the fans.|`|Q1MI6L96aa	All I want is a clean finish in a 60 minute dance and the story line ends at WM, instead of carrying over to RAW the next night and continuing on. If this is one way of getting a conclusion to things...then I'm all for it.|`|Xkm4PstOaa	That would be extremely interesting.  While I like the HHH/Orton & the Edge/Cena/Big Show storyline...I would love to see Rated RKO (Orton & Edge) duke it out for the title!  <br>  I don't think I've ever seen them in a feud with each other.  I would really like that...<br>  <br>  Heel v. Heel (I believe) has never happened.  So, yeah....that is something that I would like to see!

BAurzDXtaa	Vince has always said and done the most ridiculous things ever.

No way in hell you can turn one of those Knockouts into a model, lol<br>  <br>  Plus WWE actually HAS an exciting heavyweight division, so they don't have to lean on the Divas.<br>  <br>  EDIT: And for the guy trashing Maryse, she's great on commentary.<br>  <br>  Also, Velvet Sky is the ONLY nice looking Knockout.

First off she can't talk and has no mic skills, the wrestling was painful at best to watch. <br>  <br>  The TNA Knockouts put on really good matches, if you get the chance give them a shot to see the difference. And maybe not all of the knockouts could be models or in playboy, but i think most could, in fact there is a rumor about them talking about going into playboy soon.|`|Xkm4PstOaa	Okay, before anything, I want to say this...<br>  <br>  I've recently started watching TNA wrestling; and I gotta say....the TNA Knockout Division....not that impressive.  I don't know why people keep saying they are leagues above the WWE Divas.  That's just ridiculous...and I don't agree one bit!<br>  <br>  Okay...now to answer your question.<br>  <br>  Simple....Vince McMahon has proved, his entire life, that's he can be a complete douchebag!  The man can be a genius...he's helped market and highlight some of the best wrestlers EVER!  But, as of late, he's hasn't been able to showcase proper womans wrestling.  I don't see why he just can't look at the superstars and divas in the same aspect.  Hire the wrestlers because they are good wrestlers Vinny...don't hire just because of looks!  Because it's gonna become really old...sooner or later!

c2666c20df7b27c2859938d7ac3b140daa	You can do it, no problem.<br>  <br>  A short answer but they are the best arn't they?<br>  <br>  <br>  Ill put a bit longer answer as well.<br>  <br>  You can walk 10km in 2 1/2 hours normally so getting around the route in a quicker time than that I would say is managing to run or jog round it. Of course it depends how much quicker you want to be and what speed you would be happy to have completed the route doing.<br>  <br>  You have 2 months to do some training and get used to running. If you go out running every other night this week that's a good start. Plan a route that is about 2 to 2 1/2 miles long and run around it. Or at least run around it until you need to walk and then walk to recover until you can run again and then run a bit more. This 2 1/2 miles should take about 30 minutes to get round. Have a day resting (your legs might hurt a bit if you haven't run much before - this is normal), then do the same again but try to run a little more and walk a little less.<br>  <br>  Keep working at managing to run the whole route. 3 weeks should see you getting most of the way round I think. Then you can add some distance to your runs, over the next couple of weeks (weeks 4, 5 and 6) increase the distance to say 4 miles (3 miles week 4, 3 1/2 week 5 and 4 miles week 5). Week 7 just do the same as week 6 and week 8 - the one before your 10km run you need to recover from the training and give yourself the best chance of completing the run. Do a normal training session on the monday - even add a little distance if you want to give you confidence that you can do the race, then cut down the distance on wednesday -perhaps 2 miles. Rest the rest of the week, then race day you should be OK to go.<br>  <br>  Ask again nearer the time for advice on the 10km run - things like eating and drinking for the race.<br>  <br>  <br>  What the training I am suggesting should do is to get your muscles used to running - that's the first 3 weeks. Then when you can run OK you add some distance to give you some stamina to get round the course. Not quite going to race distance because the event will help you go the extra distance.<br>  <br>  Before I go a couple of other pointers. Make sure you go out on your first couple of runs at an easy pace - don't go out running fast because that will tire you out too much.<br>  <br>  Second point is that the hardest point of a training run is leaving your front door - get past the end of the street and you are in your stride and its easier|`|58e37d517ee1c00376f7fddeaa71cf1faa	Check out<br>  <a href="http://www.runnersworld.com/cda/smartcoach/0,7148,s6-238-277-278-0-0-0-0,00.html?starf=&lrdy=0&slen=16&trainstart=ds1236611355906&startf=checkforward&hour=0&mins=0&secs=0&rlen=fivk&rdst=fivk&mpwe=11&diff=mod" rel="nofollow">http://www.runnersworld.com/cda/smartcoa...</a><br>  <br>  It'll help you design a program based upon how far you want to go, how much experience you have and the time til the race.|`|JhfG5RUaaa	If you want to know the truth, no I do not think it is possible.

vuxef3O4aa	the first time you run, just keep running until your mind gives up. that means when your running or jogging long distance, your side will hurt, tell yourself in your mind to keep going until you reach a certain point or street corner. when you get to that point, that is your distance point, cut that in half, so you can jog home. start doing it two times a week then move on to three times a week.<br>  <br>  because your a women I recommend that you, power walk two times a week.

21J0IIZbaa	Robinson and Howard was planned to be in the dunk contest finals before the contest started. Based on Robinson's finals dunk, he deserved to win the contest. The problem is that Robinson should of not made it to the finals. The Finals should of been Rudy v. Dwight. Robinson's first dunk was the same as Smith but with one bounce. Then Robinson's second dunk with Chandler was one of the worst dunk in contest history.<br>  <br>  Both of Rudy's dunks was great.  The first dunk he hurt himself with the Martin jersey.  The second dunk was the best of the contest.  One hand floating under the backboard.  Smith's first dunk was good but his second was bad.  He should of tried the original second dunk again.<br>  <br>  Next year suggestions: James, N.

F3VjJAdiaa	Shawn has it on this one, they are actually somewhat at odds with each other, Booker T and his charity show are losing wrestlers to McMahon and the WWE. <br>  <br>  I guess WWE fears charity work.|`|InX5Pfl5aa	Well first where the hell did you hear that non sense?<br>  <br>  Second no Vince doesn't Jeff Jarret and Dixie Carter own TNA.|`|c4f45cb3208d42f175407510ca9d9c07aa	Booker T is not working with Vince on anything.    Booker T created a charity for kids, and to promote it was going to do a event with big stars in Houston (where booker lives).   WWE got wind of it and they got the stars that Booker T had already bought plane tickets for and got them to go to Wrestlemania instead.

KLjfQjVEaa	Because they don't have cameras set up at every Spring Training park.  It's not worth the investment for them to install all the necessary equipment for it since they only play there for 4 weeks.  It would be great but they can only go with what they have, but I enjoy listening to the radio option for games.<br>  <br>  They do have a few games listed but not many.|`|CuFmkAyDaa	Because no one cares about Spring Training.  Even players say that they don't like Spring Training because it's pointless and there's a high chance of them getting hurt.|`|wkpLvAntaa	Good question.  I guess simply because they do not want to hire the staff.  Also, there is not local broadcasting during Spring Training, therefore, it would be difficult for them to do it.|`|vUGKu877aa	same as austin a

March to October? or September to February?  easy choice.<br>  6 - Baseball is better in person than on TV.  Football is better on TV than in person.<br>  5 - Stats.  Baseball stats are huge, and infinitely more interesting, and more analyzed than football stats.<br>  4 - Each ballpark has some unique features. Every gridiron is exactly, boringly, the same.<br>  3 - Tie-breaker rules never decides whether or not team makes the playoffs.  Ties are broken by playing each other.<br>  2 - You can't run out the clock in baseball.  You have to get that last out, or score that last run to win the game.<br>  1 - Beauty - From the asthetics of the diamond, to the literature, and movies, more beautiful art has come from baseball than all other sports combined.<br>  <br>  Here's some more;<br>  <a href="http://www.baseball-in-bayern.de/inc/print.bbsv?id=203" rel="nofollow">http://www.baseball-in-bayern.de/inc/pri...</a>|`|3Iyu7hrcaa	What's the subject though?<br>  <br>  Baseball vs Football.  <br>  But what are you arguing?

eELS8zSRaa	Well with your endurance training you should be doing a slower heart rate, but not as low as 132-141. You should focus on long mile runs. I got up to 10-12 miles everyday last summer, but then I got ill so I couldn't continue.<br>  <br>  Mine was up in the 160's at times
AA11312653	There are so many wonderful places to camp in Florida that it's hard to know where to begin! Our Florida state parks system is one of the best in the nation and our great state park campgrounds are a big part of that.<br>  <br>  If you are car campers and want to be near a city, try Payne's Prairie near Gainesville or Tomoka near Daytona. Or go to Collier-Seminole, near Marco Island/Naples, and you can make a canoe tour of the Everglades one day and go ocean kayaking from Isle of Capri the next day.<br>  <br>  How do you feel about primitive camping? Caya Costa can be reached only by ferry boat. There are cabins, but no electicity or running water on the island. Kissimmee Prairie has over 100 miles of horse/bicycle trails and is probably the best spot in Florida for stargazing and bird watching because it is very isolated. Goldhead Branch has some of the finest day hiking with trails along the river.<br>  <br>  If you want more information, Google up Florida State Parks and look at some maps and photos, read about the various parks. Feel free to eMail me.|`|mMFJrPbvaa	What part of florida are you in? What kind of camping are you talking about, hiking in with your gear or camping out of your car in a campsite?  <br>  <br>  Look into the Everglades if you are in South Central Fl, Ocala National Forest is real nice thats about an hour or so out of Orlando, Fort Desoto has pretty nice/private car camping sites and the beach is a short walk away, Withalacochee River State Park is really nice too it has both car camping sites and smaller sites that you can hike into a short way- no more than a couple of miles.  If I had to choose one I`d go with the Everglades or Ocala- both are primitive camp sites that you hike into and the further in the park you go th eless people you will see.|`|tZPOSvHQaa	Have fun here you go.<br>  <a href="http://www.floridacamping.com/campgrounds/results.php?location=ca-cb&City_Area=Cocoa%20Beach%20Area" rel="nofollow">http://www.floridacamping.com/campground...</a><br>  <br>  find one close to you <br>  <br>  don't forget to brush up on survival skills<br>  <a href="http://www.bcadventure.com/adventure/wilderness/survival/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.bcadventure.com/adventure/wil...</a><br>  <br>  I hope you all keep in touch I wish i had friends like this|`|kfgfwWBtaa	There are loads of campgrounds here in Florida!<br>  <br>  Stephen Foster Memorial State Park- White Springs, Florida.<br>  <br>  Suwannee River State Park- I forgot where it is located, but it is really pretty :D

I am not an Arsenal fan one bit, but I can tell you now that he is class because he can pass the ball and keep the ball - nearly all you need for a box to box midfielder.

rseD4OG2aa	I'm kind of mixed about it. On the one hand I thought he was a decent wrestler and I don't like to see anyone lose their job, but on the other side The Boggeyman was hardly entertaining. He was out with an injury for a really long time and the fans kind of forgot about him. <br>  His gimmick got really stale and repetitive. I mean, there is only so many times you can cheer when a guy shoves worms down someone's throat. To me The Bogeyman hasn't ever been able to settle into a workable place with WWE. Even when he was back on Smackdown he never really seemed to fit in right. On ECW his matches didn't really mean anything and played little part in the overall storylines.

AiEGi0Zqaa	As much as I believe former Buffalo Bills WR Andre Reed deserves to go in, I'll have to give the distinction of "best hall-eligible player not in the hall" to former Broncos, Browns, and Raiders defensive end Lyle Alzado.<br>  <br>  Alzado was a beast of a lineman who played most of his career in the era before sacks were an official stat (he played '71-'85; sacks became a stat in '82) and so does not have proper career numbers to justify his effectiveness. Unofficially, he is credited with a career total of 112.5 sacks, which would have placed him among the top 5 at the time of his retirement (that total currently ranks 16th). Stats aside, the PRINCIPAL reason that Alazado does not get hall recognition is that he was an admitted steroid user. In fact, it can be argued that he was the first high profile professional athlete to admit to such. He purportedly used them throughout his career (he started in college) and as such, his numbers and accomplishments are permanently tarnished. <br>  <br>  Outside of him, I would say that the greatest HoF omission that I can think of is Buffalo Bills WR Andre Reed who ranks in the top 10 in every significant receiving category. I would also throw former Eagles and Vikings WR Cris Carter's name into the mix, but he'll most likely be inducted in next year's class (he ranks 2nd or 3rd in most career receiving categories).|`|bIbyAkHPaa	Joe Ferguson.

rNmekxLcaa	I doubt it. I'd like to see him big again just because I'm an aussie.

He is 28 years old, and will never be ranked more than 50 in the world again. He will keep going the way hes playing, and will eventually retire due to an "injury."<br>  His times been, and its gone now. <br>  And to be honest, I'm glad!|`|75ZMWlnnaa	hewitt just does not have enough (or any) weapons to hurt the top players, he will challenge them at times, but he will not win (i thought he would win against roddick at memphis, but he just could not get it done, even though he was up a set...).<br>  <br>  so if he cant beat roddick, then he can forget about scoring wins over the top 4 guys.<br>  <br>  hewitt was successful in his younger days because his game style was that of a counter-puncher. he relied solely on his speed to track down seemingly impossible shots, but as he has gotten older,. he has lost that footspeed. nowadays, he gets easily overpowered and espcially his serve is his Achilles heel.<br>  <br>  i will be very surprised if hewitt manages to get back in the top 40 by the end of this year. but at least he has won 2 grand slams, got to world no.1, won 2 YEC, before federer just went on his domination tour.|`|N9pKl35Xaa	I hate Hewitt as much as i like him. Great Aussie represents our country well but his abit of a c*cky bastard! I think his days are over really. He may pull the few upsets and shockers but other than that i think he'll stay where he is in the rankings. No doubt he can put up a fight, but compare his games with guys like Verdasco, Murray (although i hate Murray), Djokovic etc and he really hasnt got much to his name!<br>  But in saying that, i wish him all the best in his years to come, but i just dont see him having what it takes to be up there with the big guns.|`|M0kD9UFeaa	I seriously doubt it, he's pretty useless lately.|`|Z2gIo6HKaa	as much as i hate him i love watching his games but where he stands in ranks i dont care|`|Bv3Dm11paa	He's lucky to have scored his hot wife!|`|9d06cffec852de9a7554521403313f02aa	I honestly haven't seen him much recently, but knowing how passionate he is, I imagine once he starts moving up the rankings it'll only fuel the fire and he'll have that much more motivation to kick *** every time he steps on the court...so I don't doubt it.

dVk9vpmbaa	both speed work and long runs are important. The distance of the long runs are a lot more important then the pace. The point of long runs are to get more mileage and to let your legs recover from a race or speed work. they are sometimes called LSD (long slow distance) runs <br>  <br>  Long is also relative to each person and what they are used to. If you have never run more then 4 miles don't go out and do an 8-10 mile run. As a freshman in high school a long run was about 4 miles. It was more like 5-7 miles in 10th and 11th grade. As a senior, my long runs were 7-10 miles. now in college a long run is about 10 miles with some as long as 16.|`|PcyTdRA7aa	yes about twice a week, but the speed work is more essential.  they shouldn't be fast paced, though...they should be moderate pace. my pr is a 5:39 mile! i love track! good luck!|`|FHQZz8dNaa	yes yes and yes. I have been in track for two years. We do spedd drills one to two times a week. As well as long distance(approx. 3.6 miles) three times a week. I actuall JUST RAN A MILE IN MY TRACK MEET YESTERDAY!!!!!!!!!!!! I am JV, and not to fast, but I didn't come in last, my avrage time is usually 8 minute mile. Yesterday I got it in 7: 44. I think the long distance runs at practice helped, it taught me how to pace, and not die in the middle lol. <br>  GOOD LUCK, IT WAS A HARD RUN THOUGH, AS YOU RUN IN THE MILE YOUR PACE WILL QUICKEN, THE LAST TIME AROUND THE TRACK SPPPPRRRRIIIINNNNTTT LIKE YOU HAVE NEVER SPRINTED BEFORE!!!!!!|`|WST15Sm5aa	Yes, because although you need the speed work to get faster, you need the longer runs to increase your endurance so that you can run faster for a longer period of time.

4kdlE54Paa	Hollister Girl - To answer your question directed to Bevo, all the regulars of the football section have been getting VNs like a MF.  Haters and trolls have been reporting our questions just because they do not like us.  That is why you do not see many of the regulars anymore because there are immature people abusing Y!A.  Most of us don't want to get our accounts suspended so we have been blocking anyone we don't know or do not know enough.  Nothing personal.  We are just actively trying to find the trolls and prevent our accounts from suspension.  That was the reason why I originally wanted to retire because I had people reporting my legitimate answers for no apparent reason.  It is quite sad really.  It is not a popularity contest in here.

AiEGi0Zqaa	No. The Lions' failings are the result of decade-after-decade of mismanagement. In the early 1980s, the Lions had Billy Simms at HB and they failed to build a team around him. The same thing was repeated a few years later with Barry Sanders. Through their own lowliness, the Lions have even managed to acquire many great defensive players over the years, only to have them ruined by the poor handling of player personnel by various GMs and team presidents, all while the owners idly collected a profit (easy to do when you don't put money into the team; Ford Field excluded).|`|bIbyAkHPaa	Absolutely! His is the only viable curse in sports. How else can you explain Billy Sims' freak injury while he was on his way to leading the Lions to Super Bowl glory?<br>  <br>  Then there was the strange retirement of Barry Sanders. Scary stuff!|`|paIUgtLRaa	I don't know if I believe in a curse per se. I don't know if Bobby Layne cursed the Lions. I don't know the circumstances of which he left the team, but the fact that they have only had one playoff win since 1957 is of some eyebrow raising.<br>  <br>  True, the Lions and fumbled and bumbled away their chances, whether it was the front office, coaching, or the owner, but maybe that is apart of the curse...if there is one.|`|JqA5x1qiaa	ARRRGGGHHH CURRRSEEEEEEEEE<br>  <br>  ARRRGGGHHH BOBBYYYYY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

zmDopvd4aa	Well there will probably be more younger fans in attendence and since both guys are both fan favourites and on top of the fact they are wrestling on the grandest stage of them all in there own hometown I would say Undertaker as younger fans see him as cooler and his streak is unparelell but on the other hand young fans may not know that The Undertaker actually lives in Texas so they will cheer HBK but I will go out on a limb as it is 50/50 and say The Undertaker<br>  <br>  It's just a gut feeling but both will be guarenteed to get the biggest receptions of thier careers when the first note to thier theme music hits|`|qh9EOXKOaa	I think most of the fans will be cheering for the Undertaker but the one I will be cheering for is Shawn Michaels because I heard online somewhere(don't remember where) that this match was going to be a career threatening match and if Shawn Michaels leaves I will be extremely mad and I may not watch WWE anymore!!!!|`|ko9Zy9k7aa	I think more fans will cheer for Undertaker. Cos he's very popular has a strong fan base, loads of people love him. And even if you don't really like him, you still kinda feel happy bout his streak, and like if it ended it would just be shocking. Although I think HBK will still have a lot of fans behind him.

URO3gDXcaa	this is horse racing.
FUoKu13Daa	When you look at stats, team record and the contribution to their team that each of these players bring to the table then the mvp award is LBJ no question,  <br>  <br>  LBJ leads his team in scoring, assists, rebounds and steals.  so he is doing much more for his team than Wade or kobe,<br>  <br>  and when you look at the combine stats his stats are slightly better than Wades because of the rebound difference, Wade has a few % point lead in scoring and assists but LBJ rebound is almost 2 more per game than Wade. and Kobe rebounds and assists are much lower than LBJ.<br>  <br>  But when you put the team record into account then the Cavs have the second best record in the whole league and have the some amount of losses than the Lakers do, so if they both won all their game then they would have the same record but the Lakers would have the tie breaker thought because they beat the Cavs twice this year.<br>  <br>  So basically when you put record, stats, what you mean to the team success then I think the MVP order should be <br>  <br>  #1  LBJ <br>  #2 Wade<br>  and close #3 Kobe <br>  honorable mention  Dwight Howard<br>  <br>  The only reason I put Wade at 2 is the Heat might be the 4th seed but his stats are mvp type of stats and yes you are right when you say LBJ stats were better last year and did not get the award but I think with his stats and team doing pretty good compare to last year and if you took Wade off that team they would be back in the lottery,<br>  <br>  as far as Kobe, he still might be the best of all of these athletes but I truly believe the Lakers would still be a playoff team without him and if you took Wade and LBJ off of their team then the Heat and the Cavs are lottery teams.<br>  <br>  My opinion|`|13XU8cCKaa	True.  The Heat this year are like the Cavs last year.  I gotta give it to LeBron.  He has better stats than Kobe and Kobe's team is only one game ahead of LeBrons.|`|2db7f31f8de2a63df2848a630426eea7aa	I defended LeBron James last year, so not being a hypocrite, I'll defend Dwyane Wade this year.|`|vzH7f7V5aa	LeBron.|`|2972f919bb971e541701418e09d5d8c5aa	it's going to LeBron, the NBA's golden boy.<br>  <br>  it's voted on by coaches and media. and if the media has been spouting man-love for one person all season, it's James. <br>  <br>  statistics have always played a smaller part in the award than the story. <br>  <br>  that's why guys like Dirk won the award with inferior stats, just because the Mavs had such a good turnaround, while a year earlier, Chauncey Billups was snuffed for the MVP, even though the Pistons steam rolled every team in the league and had the best record. BUT, they didn't have the story to go with it.<br>  <br>  LeBron, all the way. Kobe has put up great numbers, but it's the same story as last year.|`|xRPjgGs1aa	Dwyane Wade look at his stats this year he is averaging more then LeBron in points, assists, steals, and blocks. He is the one that should be M.V.P.|`|jiBMFeihaa	Kobe Bryant. The Lakers have lost Andrew Bynum and their defense is crippling, and he is keeping them up! The same thing said about Lebron.|`|M8nKPtDiaa	It should be LeBron. He has the stats, the team, and he's the face of the NBA.|`|EKF2HdZKaa	Lebron has the edge on all stats and his team is only behind by a few games<br>  I would give the MVP to lebron|`|IZ1ZZHyCaa	DIRK NOWITZKI.....|`|C4mzZwiWaa	kobe this year, lebron next yr guarantee.|`|aUGM3ju6aa	Dwyane Wade and I don't care if Lebron didn't get it last year. I'm not the one who elects MVPs, the NBA does...Since Lebron didn't get it last season doesn't mean  I agree with it..So you should ask the NBA, "Why should Wade"?|`|qOWJQ7hRaa	Its tough to say. Lakers lost 2 straight road games, Cavs went 3-1 on their road trip. Espn.com already put Lebron back to the first spot, after Kobe climbed to the first last week but dropped again. I think Lebron already won it, because Cavs has easier games for the rest of the season as Lakers got bunch of tough road games this month after 2 straight stupid losses.

AA12243350	from what I can see, it is a 12 gauge pump action shotgun with an adjustable stock. As long as it has a barrel over 18" and it measures 26" overall, and you are over 18, not a criminal or prohibited from owning a firearm, and live in a state that allows it....Yes, you can own it.<br>  shoot safe|`|SPleGlS1aa	It is a Short Barrel Shotgun and transfers on an ATF Form 4 with a $200 tax.  You also have to live in a state that allows them, most do.<br>  <br>  Here is the form you use: <a href="http://www.atf.gov/forms/pdfs/f53204.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.atf.gov/forms/pdfs/f53204.pdf</a><br>  <br>  Edit: it is NOT an AOW.  An AOW cannot ever have had a shoulder stock installed on it.  Since this shotgun clearly has a shoulder stock installed it is an SBS, not an AOW|`|f3f63c87e27f64c3e9f1679c165409b8aa	Sorry, I didn't check out the gun, but I can tell you that a person can own ANY gun they wish if they have a license for it, rght?  They wouldn't give you license to own it if it were illegal for you to own it would they?|`|O3Yx21WMaa	To short of a barrel - don't think so.|`|Z1BtUmC2aa	It looks to me that the barrell falls short of the 16" required and it would be considered a class 3 weapon. It is legal to own depending on which state you live in, but would require a $200 tax stamp, along with paperwork and fingerprinting that would have to be completed at your local police department.<br>  If it is a registered class 3 weapon then the price tag would most likely be way more than what it is worth in my opinion.|`|fXTcFuUjaa	that is a mossberg 500 3 shot with the serbu kit, as someone stated it is considered an aow any other weapon- it is a $5.00 tax stamp, In some states it is legal- Like my own state IN but it is a lot of b.s. to go through with the BATF|`|dvgj6q6xaa	Since that appears to be 12ga. I believe it is legal unless the barrel is less than 16 inches or overall length is less than 26 in.|`|jlajkhcBaa	yep<br>  <br>  i'm sure that's considered an aow (any other weapon),<br>  <br>  and it only has like, a 5 dollar tax fee|`|mFa5ZDtcaa	Not without special permit. I can tell the barrel too short.|`|yaq7oaH6aa	That's a 'sawed-off shotgun'.<br>  You need a special permit to own one.<br>  You can get it, but it's an expensive hasle.
xQFWjFyZaa	NO NO NO!<br>  <br>  Seriously dude, he's trying to screw you over. Posada might not be 100% healthy, and even if he was, Soto is much better. Bobby Abreu blows compared to Carl Crawford! <br>  <br>  I can't believe I'm explaining this! Hell no!|`|AA49cfdraa	Not a good trade for you.  Soto is a lot better the Jorge, he'll give you more RBIs, HR's and higher AVG.  And I think Crawford is over rated as a fantasy player, his only advantage is steals.  Abreau will give you higher power numbers and comparable average.

nQlwiHfLaa	John, I've taken the position you've outlined from jump-off.<br>  <br>  The guy had never been suspended and all he did was make a bad joke. Crude? Yes. Out of line? Perhaps. Worthy of a career-ender? Hell no!<br>  <br>  In a league where drug offense, alcohol abuse and excessive on-ice violence is met with debate, discourse and opportunities for rehabilitation, how can a guy be banished by one and all for being colorful and unpopular? Screw that!<br>  <br>  Sean Avery IS a genius, at least compared to the NHL marketing group. He understands the need for anti-heroes to balance out the manufactured, lily-white image of a Sidney Crosby. It gives the league marketing edge, dimension and a bite.<br>  <br>  I'm also perfectly fine with his return NY. Any of his Ranger teammates that don't like it, can lump it (footnote to the Croz) because they had 60 games to do something on their own and they FAILED. <br>  <br>  I love Chris Drury, but he hasn't shown the ability to inspire his charge this season. They look flat, confused and disinterested. Whether that was on Renney or the players, I think that in the absence of any passion, let Avery be the team's lightning rod again. <br>  <br>  Whatever else happens, things will not be boring at MSG for the next month...or more.|`|O5Q4GP59aa	He IS a genius because for whenever Rangers next play Flames, the number of viewers is going to be more than those of all superbowl games and president inaugaarations combined.|`|AA11674745	I may be wrong, but you are the first person to place Sean Avery and the word "genius" in the same sentence.<br>  <br>  Personally, I found nothing offensive with his "sloppy seconds" comment. But I understand that the Dallas Stars are in the business of selling tickets and were trying to protect their interests when they suspended him, and eventually moved him.<br>  <br>  As far as players are concerned, I wish they'd all shut up and do what they are grossly overpaid to do. The press makes too much out of the daily affairs of sports teams and I only care about one thing - CHAMPIONSHIPS.|`|rD0ATcX5aa	I agreed with the NHLs actions towards Sean Avery. I've said it before, it is not that he was caught saying something unawares on his private time away from the ice, but that he intentionally went on camera, and made derogatory remarks about other players, which the NHL considered to be an embarrassment. They were well within their rights, and had enough of his behaviour.<br>  <br>  The NHL wants player celebrities to be famous for their ability to play hockey (Crosby and Ovechkin); not their ability to offend others on camera, to make prejudiced comments (about the French); having poor sportsmanship rules named after them (his actions towards Brodeur) or racist remarks (at Iginla) to name only a few moments of Averys history...<br>  <br>  Prejudiced morons are not a "rare breed"; they are sadly all too common...|`|538d6b5db0aba1de26b3ce3538e543f7aa	100% agree...i dont understand y people take his antics so seriously...i personally find it entertaining. Every time theres an interview with Avery, my eyes and ears will be glued to the TV waiting to hear what interesting comments Avery has for that day. Most who hate him, just dont want to see their favorite team deal with Avery's antics.|`|qcDHyhdtaa	Avery is an idiot, but Bettman is a bigger idiot. Sidney Crosby can donkey punch people and doesn't even get in trouble, yet Avery opens his mouth and gets anger management classes and booted off his team.<br>  <br>  Thanks!|`|79uzTFl7aa	Doesn't matter.  He's a fourth liner on Broadway.  Gets him closer to that Marie Claire assistant gofer job he really wants.|`|fPHjh4Jsaa	Avery is an idiot|`|0Nyry3rZaa	Avery reminds me of gay.|`|ZRG18vnQaa	Sure the kid has skills but that don't stop him from being a scumbag and a world class Idiot|`|MnMkgAscaa	Avery is a *****|`|uFIGSbQfaa	Your Joking right <br>  <br>  Flyers #1|`|hMo9z0TSaa	Hes not smart for what he said. He does have skills though. That's why the Rangers picked him up.<br>  <br>  “I’m just here to help these guys win,” Avery simply stated. “I’ve been here before and I am back again, and I am thankful to be back and thankful for the opportunity. I am just going to make the most of it, play as hard as I can and help these guys win games.” <br>  <br>  I think he wont be the same guy he was before he went to anger classes.|`|Vmc0mJdFaa	No Sean Avery is an idoit. He is a disgusting. i actually heard his team would put a chair outside the door and he would sit there instead of with his team b/c they couldn't stand him and he couldn't stand them. He would have his iPod. I don't hate him, but I don't like him.  :)|`|eTHEgWq0aa	Avery is an idiot. He almost washed away his own career for talking dumb s**t and now he's playing for one of the best teams in the league. It was just luck, and i hope he hardly gets played because he's a big d*****bag. <br>  <br>  In the next five years, he'll be the one asking you 'paper or plastic'|`|MEa1Z7G8aa	Sean Avery gets himself into a lot of trouble most of the time. But he is still a decent goal scorer. All we need is to have someone to smack him on the head and make him play normally. If his head wasn't up his ***, he would be a very talented player|`|c69svim5aa	Only Flyer fans will think that. NO! He is mentally insane!<br>  Same with Ovechkin. There is just something wrong with their brains that make them so crazy!<br>  <br>  LETS GO PENS!|`|e5LUghiAaa	Just goes to prove that  *** can play Hockey<br>  Love him or hate him he is good at what he does. he reminds me of a bigger Keith Acton only bigger and more Feminine|`|Jy9KNgSDaa	I thought the whole avery deal was a sham by the rangers to keep him without the cap hit... send him to a place where you know you have an owner  that does not mind paying LOTS  of money to see some one not play in hicks ( if you don't know what i am talking about think A Rod) then let sean go there and say something or do something that will make hicks pull him then get him back for half the price... <br>  <br>  I know... i think too much but whos to say i am not right... i would do this! <br>  <br>  also did sean say something that was not true???? yes and no look up the Definition some time.... i am sure she had to have showered once or twice... so it is technically untrue.... atho she was his ex<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  dracs i like your new hat...|`|suojKPfPaa	All I can say, is that it should be quite the entertainment, watching the coach who thinks Avery shouldn't even be in the Nhl anymore, try to keep him on track and in line. I'm dying to see what happens the first time Avery finds himself slipping out of his 'newly reformed behavior' and back into the a*s we all know him as.. This new coach of theirs, seems like he isn't willing to take sh*t from anyone, especially Avery.<br>  <br>  ..And what are you talking about, 'the balls to stand up and fight for what they believe in?' Sorry, but have you ever seen Avery out on the ice?..In most instances, he is the first one to back down and have the refs come in and break it up.|`|HJuOSvmdaa	One thing struck me in your answer--<br>  "It's that rare breed of young men who have the balls to stand and fight for what they believe in."<br>  <br>  Fighting for what he believes in?  Pissing people off and calling his ex's bad names?  Yeah, what a bad ***.  You're acting like he's Karl Marx or Julius Ceasar or some shi t.|`|XKsRrY2uaa	no im a genius

ubGNtkHQaa	They should draft a linebacker, preferably Rey Maualuga. He is perfect for San Diego. He can play by Merrimen, Phillips and soon replace Cooper. If not they should draft Brian Cushing, a OLB that could put pressure on the quarterback. When Merrimen went out San Diego's total defense dropped from 5th to 22nd. I would draft Cushing if I were them. I don't think they need to trade up in the second round. I think trading the pick to New England to get Hester was a mistake. IN the later rounds they need to draft O-line and D-Line|`|Ar5VHDiBaa	Ryan Leaf or Eli Manning|`|sAHTMuAeaa	Does it really matter?<br>  <br>  I mean come on...<br>  <br>  it's the Chargers.<br>  <br>  Who sucks worse than the Chargers?<br>  <br>  No one.<br>  <br>  Let me summarize:<br>  <br>  The Chargers suck.

Y4mz8BShaa	50, yes.<br>  75, you're pushing it.<br>  100, No.<br>  <br>  Since you don't have a great a vibration on semi automatic, you won't be shaking the rifle when you fire. A minute difference, but present.<br>  <br>  The Galaxy has a better hop-up unit, but the barrel on it doesn't do much in terms of accuracy. It's meant for tight CQB and a side arm. Great accuracy for what it is, though. Better than JG's.<br>  <br>  Echo 1's MP5A4. Same thing + metal bushings, full stock - mock suppressor.<br>  <a href="http://www.airsoftretreat.com/reviews/showproduct.php?product=189&cat=74" rel="nofollow">http://www.airsoftretreat.com/reviews/sh...</a><br>  <br>  The Galaxy MP5K PDW.<br>  <a href="http://www.airsoftforum.com/board/Echo-1-Mp5a4-t92870.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.airsoftforum.com/board/Echo-1...</a><br>  <br>  EDIT: Barrel length isn't too important in airsoft, but it matters. With a good tightbore and hop-up, and airsoft MP5 variant, can be quite accurate, yes. But stock with .20's, I wouldn't be too confident.|`|vMZCED9jaa	I would go for the JG (or better echo1) mp5 (original, not VA, TF, or MS) I had it, but the only problem is the safety sometimes doesn't work;it clicks back into semi. From Airsoft Reports, they say its the most accurate Echo1 on the line( of coarse, this video is somewhat old, and is only comparing the e1 G36 and the m4) Which can hit to about 150 feet.|`|NfnVMaIfaa	The MP5 isn't very accurate all it is, is an enlarged 9mm pistol that has automatic capabilities and a stock if you were thinking about having this as your secondary weapon I would just forget about the MP5 and get a sawed-off shotgun.  But this is the best MP5 in the series. never get one that has a fixed stock! this one here that you are looking at has a collapsable stock, that is want you want, when going to buy a MP5 airsoft gun.|`|vgZPMvmEaa	Sorry, Dmitri, but I actually own this gun, and yes, I think you could definitely hit a 1 foot target at 75 feet. If you are patient enough and using .25s, I think 100 is possible. It could be that I am overestimating, but I have found that the JG Mp5SD6 is very accurate, especially for how short the barrel is.

When I play football, the last thing I want to hear is a person cheering for me when she doesn't know why she's even cheering for. In my opinion cheerleaders only get that a Touchdown is good and a defensive player hitting one of the teams offensive player is bad.<br>  <br>  Sure you cheerleaders are cute, but it's not that you wear any clothing that makes you cute. But I really don't see why we need cheerleaders. Sorry.|`|7WrGHYqeaa	Not all cheerleaders are "hot" but mainly because they wear short skirts and do flexible things..lol hope that helped.|`|LmFVTUkHaa	99% of them have a great body,And there hot,pro ones im talking about|`|63PdLNMQaa	because they are flexible..bend in many ways hahaha|`|AOA8TJraaa	Maybe ur ugly we think there hot cuz well they're hot!!|`|VL0YFZr7aa	they DONT....ya'll are just easyyy!|`|MxHRjPFHaa	show mw a photo and i will let you know...thxs|`|a4soGEksaa	cuz the way they dreesss nd have huge tittiess!!
ubGNtkHQaa	Excessive Celebration...need i to explain?|`|6AvvxvAqaa	i would let all plays be reviewable (challenged)...I remember in 07 when cleveland lost to arizona when winslow caught and td and would have clearly had two ft in but was pushed out and the ref called him out...since this is a judgement call it can not be reviewed...wouldn't you be able to make a better judgement if you saw the replay and multiple angles...GO SKINS in 09!!!|`|c4b596d15eac948f611f72b6a99f85a0aa	Going to be a bit more extreme and say ban 1-pt conversions and force teams to go for 2.<br>  <br>  Anyone can kick a 20-yard FG. Make the team punch it in from a couple yards out.|`|mTSOJKlyaa	i agree, with above, celebrations as long as they are not blatantly long or dangerous to equipment or obscene or anything should be allowed.|`|0xm2Dd1gaa	Either excessive celebration, or using the ball as a prop, both of them are retarded.|`|HvDTEsBRaa	excessive celebration. you can't even spike the damn ball anymore. football is not the same....|`|daRDQE9maa	This isn't doing away with but last year they changed the facemasking rule. Used to it used to be you grab it with no twist.. 5 yard penalty, you grab it and twist.. 15 ... now its a 15 yard penalty no matter what... I think it's dumb to just make it 15 no matter what becuz befor a player would put his hand on it and stop and just settle for the 5 yarder now they are just going to think darn its already there and its a 15 no matter what i think more players are going to get hurt becuz of this rule change...|`|0dbwA1dVaa	Excessive celebration (including using the ball as a prop & all of that stuff), because celebrating isn't hurting anyone if it isn't obscene/racist/etc. - AND it varies with referee, so does it matter?<br>  <br>  I agree with you about roughing the kicker, depending on the situation. Sometimes a dude just can't stop running after the ball has been kicked. He accidently slams into the dude, so what? (I also feel the same way about roughing the passer... no kicker/quarterback should be treated different than anyone else out there getting thrown to the ground.)|`|5gKGtSriaa	I agree on the excessive celebration rule, because if T.O does a Usian Bolt thing he gets a stupid penalty and everyone hates him. Plus it varies by which ref you've got. Some let it go, besides the players should be able to do that stuff, most celebrations are really cool that get a penalty.<br>  <br>  Also i'd take out the whole pass interference, cause when I was a corner that happened sometimes, but it also puts an advantage for the WR.|`|AiEGi0Zqaa	Holding.<br>  So many teams do it on every play without it being called, they might as well just can the whole thing anyway. It only seems to be called regularly when the game is in its most intense moments, as if the refs are directing a stage play.|`|AOA8TJraaa	Excessive Celebration, let the poor guys celebrate man! Especially in the playoffs or the Super Bowl. But I wouldn't allow anything racist/obscene or anything like that.|`|Szf3UEVNaa	I would Ban when the ball is kicked off the catcher if he is close enough can go out of bowns with one foot and then catch the ball. it would be considered as an out kick.|`|vUGKu877aa	Excessive Celebration|`|j7i0zPpWaa	Roughing the passer, if he is out there he should get leveled too|`|oAOUAVVAaa	The illegal contact rule.

wBGjks5uaa	NO, if you're in the NBA you most likely would have taken 1 year of college, or you could of tried out for the team. But playing in the NBA takes up a LOT of your time. Players train from early in the morning usually till like 4:00 pm or 5:00 pm, or even later.|`|piZ4xDBqaa	Some players do go to college during the NBA season, though not many.  Naturally they can't take a full course load, but one or two classes gives them something to do during all the travel and down time during the NBA season.<br>  <br>  I remember in particular reading an interview with Bruce Bowen of the Spurs where he discussed why he was going back to college.

Just a couple of weeks before preseason starts.<br>  <br>  2)  He has not requested reinstatement.<br>  <br>  3)  Roger Goodell has not said that he would reinstate him and is likely to carry on the suspension for at least a year from today mostly to avoid media drama with PETA.<br>  <br>  4)  He is not just suspended because he killed dogs.  He funded and comanaged an illegal gambling ring.  The Personal Conduct Policies of the NFL state that a player is not allowed to participate in any form of gambling and first time offenders risk lifetime banishment.  Does anyone remember what happened to Pete Rose (MLB)?<br>  <br>  5)  There is not a team out there willing to take on the PR nightmare that follows when picking up Michael Vick.  Never follow the media hype.  They are just trying to sell news.  49ers, Vikings, etc have been rumored to be possible suitors, but they have already publicly announced that the media is hyping rumors.<br>  <br>  6)  The Falcons still own the rights to Michael Vick and are still obligated to his contract.  If he was traded, the new team would have to assume that big contract.  No team even wants to touch that contract.<br>  <br>  7)  We do not even know how conditioned he is anymore considering he has been stripped of the sport for 2 years.  I suspect he will have definitely lost a step or 2.<br>  <br>  Before Michael Vick could even be considered, 1 and 2 have to be overcome.<br>  <br>  Thumbs up to those who agree.|`|sqfjfR3iaa	In his backyard, too many people would picket any team that picked him up right now. Try the 2010-2011 season.
D776XEYMaa	Before you look at my answer, go to this guy's site:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://launchexhaust.blogspot.com/2007/01/how-to-pull-2k-test.html" rel="nofollow">http://launchexhaust.blogspot.com/2007/0...</a><br>  <br>  It was really helpful to me when I was struggling to get my splits down.<br>  <br>  This is how I lay out MY race strategy:<br>  <br>  2000-1800: I take a power 20 and then lengthen out. A lot of people take a power 10 or power 15, but I take 20 to get my splits nice and low. It helps you mentally to see your splits down so much. A lot of people do something called a "negative split" where they start their lengthen and go almost TOO slow. For example: if your target split is 1:53, negative splitting involves you lengthen out to 1:54/55. I've never found it to work, but you're welcome to it.<br>  <br>  1800-1300: This is a powerful part of the race that blows by. It might seem easy at this point, but it's important to keep your split consistent and don't listen to the part of your brain that wants you to stop. Endure. Work harder. Don't be sporadic in your splits. Don't take random, powerful strokes. Consistency is your friend.<br>  <br>  1300-1000: This could be the hardest part of the race (in my opinion). That's why it's important for you to keep mentally strong. Most coaches say that "the race is won in the middle". This holds very true. Don't give in and give up (because this is where it usually happens). Start grunting if you need to. Get as much oxygen in as possible. Focus on good technique (it will only make you faster). And try not to think pessimistically.<br>  <br>  1000-800: Here's the middle of the race. You're done half. You could do a half more. This is where I would always take a power ten, lengthen ten, and another power ten. This helped me a LOT novice year. My coach always told me to "kick the middle of the race behind you". When you're at 800, it's both a great feeling and a horrible feeling. Great because you're in the triple digits. Horrible because you hurt so much. Don't pay attention to the hurt and just think about the sweet glory of achieving your goal split and falling on the floor soon after.<br>  <br>  800-400: Alright. You're almost done. Think about it: almost done. You've only got 4-3 minutes to go. What can you do for 4-3 minutes. You can't give up now. Stay strong. Consistency. Take a power 10 at the 500 and you're already at 400 meters to go. It hurts right now: I know it does. You're sweating. You feel like throwing up. KEEP GOING.<br>  <br>  400-THE END: This is the part most coaches look at. You cannot give up at this part. At the 250: SPRINT. Don't worry about what your coaches say about rushing your slide. I want you to do everything to get your splits down for the last 25 strokes of your race. This is where you drain all your energy. Keep technique. Keep breathing. And just go hard.<br>  <br>  At the end, you should be the most uncomfortable human on the planet. You should feel like you're coming out of a shower from hell. You should be swearing to the gods how awful you feel (it's not really hurt, but uncomfort). I remember at the end of my 2ks, my body was so out of control that when I tried to take a gulp of water, my body would throw it back out. I suggest you take a few paddle strokes (don't worry: your screen will keep your information). DON'T LAY DOWN (it only makes it worse). I know it's tempting, though!<br>  <br>  Just bear in mind that this is a very mental test. You could always do more. Always. But, whatever test you do, always go in with a plan: game plan, goal split, and goal time. Don't just "do whatever". You will fail. Drink lots of water beforehand and eat normally the night before (don't carb up). Eat at least an hour before the test to help you digest and use the energy acquired (I always eat an uncrustable... don't do a full coarse meal).<br>  <br>  Bear in mind that a 4k and 6k are totally different. Come back when you want help with those, but in the spring, you'll probably keep to 2ks.<br>  <br>  Good luck in your rowing endeavors!

Try drinking a standard serving, 8oz or so, of an electrolyte solution (not going to plug any orange colored liquid that allowed the Florida Gators to stage a great football come back) about a half hour before you start running the distances that are in excess of 20 minutes of solid hard running.
1yOdrYiHaa	haha I'm wondering what kind of people are you to waste your time bashing someone on the internet, let me make it clear La Park is a better user than you <br>  <br>  WA : Yes!|`|0Dm3WEMcaa	If i want to share my opinion on Christian or Batista i will, i have never claimed what i say about them to be anything other than a personal opinion. I answer questions about these wrestlers with exactly how i feel about them, ask a question about Chris Jericho and i will tell you he is one of the best wrestlers in history who is a better mic worker than The Rock and has the technical ability of any great wrestler. If the question is about Christian why would i meniton a wrestler i like instead, that isn't answering the question. I actually like Christian but i personally believe the over hype he gets is beyond belief and he hasn't done anything of note since his return but I do find it funny you judge my life on my opinions of certain wrestlers. Like i have said all i do is answer the questions asked by others, i don't go out of my way to bash wrestlers nor do i pander to other users by saying i agree with them when i don't. If you don't like my opinions on Christian or Batista or Chris Jericho or LA Park that's fine, i'm mature enough to know not everyone will like me or my views but i do show others who don't agree respect, just because i think it doesn't make me right.

Xf9DrYgOaa	Hi Taylor!<br>   <br>  <br>      I have cheered pretty much all my life and have back based tumbled and flown. In order to become flexible the first thing you must do is be prepared to endure pain. Cheerleading is a sport where you use a lot of muscles that your body doesnt use everyday. Therefore how you do stretches is very important because it is very easy to pull something such as your hip flexer or hamstring and such. First I would advise doing a simple straddle on the floor with a chair in front off you. hold onto the legs on the chair and pull your body down make your back is straight and that your breathing at all times. Breathing is key in stretching because when you go back to the same position your body will be able to stretch even further. you can also straddle the wall flexing your feet and bending your knees and with one hand in front of you and one hand in back of your push yourself into the wall. This good for side splits heel stretches kicks and bow and aeros.hold every stretch for 30secs . going into splits is also good and keep your up and lean your body over your front leg and point your toes. THIS WILL HURT YOU MUST DO THIS EVERYDAY! start with that so far....<br>  <br>  Backhand springs take a lot of strength many cheerleaders now a days can do backhandsprings but they do them incorrectly. Your legs should never open and your arch is very important to gain upper body strength do push ups and do handstands agains the wall and snap your legs down together as quickly as you can when this becomes easy this helps for position and running tumbling passes. even your going to want to do a running back handspring backhand tuck and your snap is very important for going into the next tumbling pass. However always do this with a spot when learning and do this on a gym floor.<br>  Good Luck

vpZJ6rZzaa	Uhm.. Im not random btw lool|`|cf4d6d60fab75efc136a4d66dd5c03b4aa	I dont really like the idea of penalty.|`|VpiYSQVnaa	lol i know...i guess they saw the word porn in stefy's question and had to open it <br>  <br>  FQ:<br>  well a penalty is an advantage so either way i'll take it, but i'll feel alittle uneasy about it if it's clear they don't deserve it, but then again, i think of all the times they have ridiculous calls go against them and i feel better lol...afterall, it's the ref that makes these decisions not the team itself.|`|oNR7il8baa	I think it's sometimes funny. <br>  <br>  FQ- Honestly, I'm like "that wasn't a penalty, Oh Well lets score it!"<br>  Just because it happens to us too where the other team gets penalties undeserved|`|ZWyKCsqBaa	Who doesn't hate that<br>  FQ- I could care less, as long as we get one and score it.|`|r00JN6v1aa	how is it related to football?
AA12370193	Everton didn't even win today.<br>  <br>  And O'neill was STUPID for giving up in UEFA to try and fight to stay in 4th spot. They aren't even Champions League quality anyway.|`|FFE9Qztzaa	HAHA ^^ There is your  "best answer", mate.<br>  <br>  NOoo!<br>  Come on villa! wake up! Remain in the 4th spot. You deserve it! :))|`|S0XArokKaa	Gooners! I cant believed city won. Arsenal are the come back kings,|`|96e3aa0cb1e4c4ec1e3d9d8ecff90f48aa	yes its Everton to watch out for <br>  <br>  lmao @omg isti|`|e197cb3f4211de6521dcc6f8afc0358caa	In my opinion, they should have focused on the UEFA Cup. That was a trophy they had the potential to win.<br>  <br>  The manager made a decision to get Villa the money that comes with the Champions League instead of netting a prestigious trophy. It's backfiring on him.|`|Vjan4Vq2aa	Looking at it now, Villa's going to come in fifth. I'll be disappointed, because I wanted someone else from England to go to Champions League. Also, they got to watch out for Everton too.|`|tfotPdeZaa	Ha Ha Ha :) More like look out Arsenal! Here comes Everton!|`|x4QambMNaa	Dont Worry About Arsenal<br>  <br>  This Team Cant Go Passing You In The 4th Spot|`|rzPMzoxzaa	They haven,t stopped sliding yet.Luckiest team of the season.|`|7Tw7s6HSaa	I know, i'm happy it's down to 3 points, still a lot of work to be done though|`|3638ecbacff09303c04d9f60a89e841baa	Watch out Everton????? am I mistaken in thinking they drew with blackburn... watch out nobody Arsenal will finish in the top four without a shadow of a doubt.
zcyTx4NZaa	I'm guessing their number one focus now is getting him signed.<br>  <br>  With the Panthers being in a playoff spot (as of today) becoming a seller on deadline day and trading your marquee player sends a bad message to your team: We (management), depsite you being in the playoff picture, don't have faith in you and believe you won't be there at seasons end.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, Florida doesn't have the money/market to go shopping and try and make a push for a deep run, if they had made a deal to bring someone in and then still missed the playoffs despite that, they'd be in some bad financial troubles come next season and then there would be no way they could sign Bouwmeester and would lose him for nothing.<br>  <br>  So their big move, was no move, and it was the right move in my opinion.|`|79uzTFl7aa	Oh well...they will lose him to Free agency and get nothing.|`|NEw2JLmVaa	I think they could of gotten better with the supposed deal of lupul carle and a 1st for JayBo and they would of made the playoffs probably and still gotten sumthing out of the him<br>  <br>  Id of probably have kept Olli but its been good for you guys so good luck<br>  GO HABS!!!!|`|AA11674745	As a Flyers fan, I'm glad it didn't materialize. If it had meant moving Dan Briere to Miami - I might be saying otherwise, but as it is, Jaybo belongs with the Panthers in order to make a good playoff run.<br>  <br>  Also, it wouldn't help teams in the southern states if all the star players get gobbled up at the trade deadline by the northern teams.<br>  <br>  Good luck to the Panthers this year - as long as the Flyers don't have to pay for it.

9d06cffec852de9a7554521403313f02aa	Shaq in his prime would have his way with dwight, but, then again, Lebron would make Bird look like the worst defender in the history of the game.  Jordan and Kobe would be pretty evenly matched (with a very slight edge to Jordan), as would Abdul-Jabbar and Garnett.  Paul would be too quick for Magic, but Magic is tall and long enough to throw lobs down low over Paul.  I think Old school would play inside-out, trying to get the ball to Shaq every play and free up Bird and Jordan on the perimeter, while new school would pick & roll or slash and dish.  I think the deal breaker though, would be New School's superior defense and coverage of the passing lanes...attempting  to disrupt every attempt to get the ball down to Shaq, pester him if he does get the ball, and then use their quickness to get back into their sets when he kicks it back out.  New School gets the W.  I'd hope it'd end in a Kobe over Jordan buzzer-beater, but I don't think it'd be that close.  It'd probably be something like 130-120.|`|V48H3aWQaa	Kareem is a center, so this line up wouldn't work. You will need to throw in Charles Barkley, Karl Malone, etc. <br>  <br>  The only match-up problem I see is Chris Paul and Magic. Neither would be able to guard the other.<br>  <br>  Old school would win.|`|9oD5AnHfaa	Magic would destroy Paul<br>  Jordan....just because he the greatest ever<br>  Bird when he was hot, but I'd put money on Lebron<br>  Garnett, he goes to hard and wouldn't be stopped<br>  Howard, he beat Shaq just last night|`|v3u9vgGRaa	Old school plays with more teamwork and common sense. cps could beat Magic but kobe could not beat jordon, lebron couldn't stop bird, kareem would beat out garnett, and shaq would dominate howard|`|Mo201H1Maa	old school will sh*t all over new school...<br>  although i would take someone else at PF, other than kareem... probably bill russell|`|WZsW9Jfhaa	old school because talent was better then|`|c3tADklmaa	Old School will school em.|`|tzrLDbHWaa	Old school, easily.  They would actually play team ball.  No offense to new school,  but with the exception of CP3, I see everyone else wanting to be the star and taking too many shots.|`|NG6eeCfuaa	Easy question. Old school. Fundamentals. Passing/team defense/free throws. Offense is based upon moving without the ball, as opposed to isolation. No disrespect to the "new school", however, they don't know the fundamentals of the game. Cheers.|`|UMVWQiYJaa	Old school|`|zLBDmcsnaa	*OLD SCHOOL!  = ]]]<br>  nuff said|`|5FypDafWaa	old school
wcgkX4lVaa	Hah, I seriously think that the WWE staff is giving him a hard time. Yes, he's new, but they never really gave him a real chance. Just because he didn't receive a huge pop when he debuted, doesn't mean he couldn't grow on people. So I'm pretty sure they'll either send him to FCW or release him, and I think they'll do this pretty soon.|`|ZpH2PFF9aa	Kizarny will be Wwe champ at Backlash!|`|dgXKvb7haa	Kizarny will nizzot wrizzle agizzan!|`|310m2T4Daa	Well, maybe maybe not.. its pretty much just fire him on smackdown, or.. just send him to ECW and he'll start wrestling more there.<br>  <br>  I think its stupid how he got all those promos.. i mean, if he's not going to wrestle, why even give him a commercial deal?|`|ULSUqmeZaa	He has been doing some dark matches. I'm sure he will wrestle on TV again.
El7C2JsMaa	I believe it was Man Utd a few seasons back!<br>  <br>  I agree with your point, getting a CL place is only half the battle, its not so much about how well they do in the CL its about getting there again the following season and every season after that otherwise it will just be pointless as nothing would have changed!<br>  Just look at Everton when they got into the CL, they went out in the qualifying stages and then had such a shocking season domestically that they were no-where near a CL spot for the next season allowing Liverpool to reclaim their 4th spot. They won't get any real financial benefits by getting into the CL once, they need to be qualifying season after season so they can compete in the transfer market to build a bigger squad which will allow them to challenge domestically and in Europe which they weren't able to do this season!|`|7Tw7s6HSaa	Lmao - It was Man Utd|`|cf4d6d60fab75efc136a4d66dd5c03b4aa	It was United. I guess Spurs need to sack the glory hunter manager and bring a decent one, on paper it is the beat after top four and even has good depth. i agree with Villa case.|`|96e3aa0cb1e4c4ec1e3d9d8ecff90f48aa	Everton broke into top 4 a few seasons ago , ok so we did not do well in C L but we have stayed up in the top 6 we have not got as much money as the top 4 but we are trying very hard , i think all credit has got to go to David Moyes for this he has got our team working for each other and given us a great team spirit|`|0s8uOZHCaa	I wouldn't say Arsenal are playing crap, against Sunderland and Fulham Arsenal had so many chances to get them a few goals. They were just unlucky, against West Brom though they bagged most of the chances they had.|`|gpNIG15eaa	Man United was the last English club to finish at the bottom of a Champions League group that they could've topped easily,had they treated the 2005 Champions League more seriously.
FFE9Qztzaa	I was impressed, and I realize that he should of never left Tottenham in the first place. He has his own form there and plays an important role for them. He did great. 1 goal and multiple assists.<br>  <br>  I wish he wouldve done that for us.. lol|`|SIKuOevVaa	I'd say big deal, it was only against Middlesbrough... but then, look what those guys did to Liverpool on Saturday.<br>  <br>  I managed to catch a glimpse of it while watching Arsenal clown its way to a hideous nil-nil against Fulham.  However, that's in the past, as Arsenal remembered how to beat a lousy team yesterday, and Liverpool beat the Dirty Monkey Mackems, while Villa got shocked by Man City today.  Looks like the Big Four will remain such.|`|569220f4bb3c501027a6a6fe7ba2bb28aa	Very impressive, but it's always been that way at Spurs for him.<br>  Which is why he should never have left them in the first place.<br>  If he was still with Liverpool he would still be trying for goals. Not scoring any.|`|CrWcnQx7aa	if he played like that for most of the time in a liverpool shirt, the guy might not left to spurs and we would probably still at the top....|`|El7C2JsMaa	ha! if only Rafa wasn't so short sighted and stubborn, eh?|`|OYYYNCyCaa	you don't think Liverpool fans will answer this<br>  <br>  <br>  AWESOME -- bad luck Rafa could not see past the bench

uS8hK7Zhaa	He's cool in my book. I like his promos, mic skill, and his character. He's a pretty charismatic person too|`|Lv89kHKpaa	He's getting better. If you watch his match on Smackdown against the big show, he did a few more moves than his usual moveset. He is good on the mic, and cares about the business|`|8XZZKSj7aa	I like him.

He loves his fans, and he respects other wrestlers in the back. he also donates a lot of time to charity and make a wish foundation.|`|4tvI9WYjaa	he is overated undertaker wanna be  holds more tittles every second crys to vince <br>  go a head and give me thubs down you know im right only people that thumbs me down is cena fans|`|VBfhoqS3aa	He always gets up like superman.|`|AA11482019	Cena sucks

tvuhGTD9aa	Doubt it. If the rain delay was long enough, it's pretty standard to change pitchers. The risk is if the previous pitcher has "cooled down", it is preferred to let him begin his rest cycle rather than re-warm and maybe get injured.<br>  <br>  Might be overcautious, but this is how things are Done in baseball.|`|QIlhmWwBaa	Nah i doubt it after long rain delays its pretty normal to see teams change pitchers because of them not pitching for longs periods of times|`|HRr6FUjFaa	352423346353453v
xlYjkEIhaa	Tomlinson wants to stay a Charger and the Chargers want Tomlinson to stay in town, so i dont think he is going anywhere anytime soon, the guy is just way to good|`|dmrpFGxcaa	Franchising sproles pretty much spelled the end for LT.  There is no way you can have two top paid RB's on their team.  LT is on the downside of his career evident by his numbers last year.  Any team that trades for him shouldnt give up much because he will be done in just a couple years.  A 1st is way too much to give up for him. I would say a 3rd and maybe a backup player would be about right for him|`|EEZnaoXEaa	The Chargers would be crazy to trade Tomlinson although he has joined the over 30 RB club Tomlinson still has atleast 4 more years in him. If San Diego would draft a compliment to him like Moreno, Wells or McCoy I think Tomlinson could reemerge as a top back in a two RB system.|`|pKJhvdz1aa	Hell no<br>  HE IS Staying<br>  the chargers want him to stay and so does he<br>  i think that Tomlinson will come out next season doing much better <br>  he will come back great and show us that he aint givin up yet|`|5gKGtSriaa	Nope.

aX8nee8gaa	As a high school coach I see this all the time. Kids know they can't play, so they want to have clubs that will make others think they can play. They think that tour level clubs make tour level  players. We all know the reality is quite different. If he struggles to break 100 regularly, then it doesn't really matter. But in no way would I advise someone to spend that much money on golf clubs when he clearly is not any good yet. He can expect to hit those irons shorter, lower and more crooked than most clubs. If that's what he wants, then fine. <br>  If he really wants to improve, then he needs to become a solid ball striker, not a great one, with an outstanding short game. Most kids just want to hit it and never learn how to put it in the hole.|`|sBrummATaa	no too hard to hit. maybe the 80s shooter but not the 100s shooter|`|kGuJmQzSaa	those are great irons, but as was already stated are very hard to hit. If you're looking for forgiveness you don't want to go with the tour pro series. If you consistently play between the 80's and 90's and want the best out there, I'd suggest the callaway X22's. If you are normally in the low to mid eighties and are willing to work hard to get into the 70's, get the tour pros. Once again, great iron but little forgiveness.|`|n42I1Fusaa	First off, never listen too a guy who eats ****. Your buddy is ignorant and wishes he was better than he really is. TP stands for tour pro therefore are extremely hard to hit for someone at his skill level. These clubs will raise the numbers on his score card due to the low playability level of the clubs. The regular r7's are a better bet or the Taylormade Burners.|`|THYOQ2nmaa	hm,TaylorMade R7 TP Iron Set  is good,you should agree what he choose|`|Ijjl5RRiaa	Yep, the r7 irons are awesome, they have a huge sweet spot, great for average to below average golfers.|`|nD77wL5raa	You are wrong. Those are great iron's for him. You are just jealous.
gUMucKOkaa	You don't say the size or type of your league. Assuming a standard roto league, you have a good infield, weak outfield and need another closer or two. You know that Putz is setting up for Krod, not closing at this point.<br>  <br>  You can get rid of Irod and use Suppan and Wolf to drop if you find better players.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|868namC6aa	GET HANLEY RAMIREZ!!!!<br>  <br>  I don't know about you but i would trade Reyes for Hanley
NRs72Afxaa	Well TNA aren't billionares yet. <br>  <br>  Do I think the Knocouts deserve the same pay as the MEM? Yes.|`|agIiai2paa	Yes. Male wrestlers are used more than women.<br>  <br>  Male wrestlers have more invested by companies to potentially become the star of the company.<br>  Brutus Magnus could likely become a big superstar and be a regular main eventer. TNA would pay him more money to prevent him to sign with WWE.<br>  Women pretty much have been always used as to draw in male viewers as eye candy. There are not plans right now to make Awesome Kong the face of the company or to be used in main events.|`|e0W6d9TPaa	I would agree that Brutus Magnus shouldn't make more than Awesome Kong. Awesome Kong is the crown of the Knockout's division (I said crown, not crown jewel - that would be Taylor Wilde). I don't think they should be paid equally though because the Konckout's division isn't as aged as the X-Division, the heavyweight division, or the tag team division. Those have been around for 7 years. The Knockouts are still pretty fresh. <br>  <br>  The Nielsen ratings system also said WCW beat WWE for over a year. A company like that should still be around, don't you think? I'm just saying...|`|iWcTmuhAaa	I will agree with you only on these conditions,<br>  <br>  1-. They should start giving variety of matches like Ultimate-X, Ladder matches, First Blood matches, Elevation X e.t.c.<br>  <br>  2-. Women should do hardcore matches, use chairs, thumb tags, tables, baseball bats. Make each other cut, burn and bleed in the ring like male wrestlers.<br>  <br>  if they do it, then surely they should be paid equally.<br>  otherwise not.|`|0995361f63352aa29be48152b1a3db15aa	yeah men are better|`|HSTN3iPDaa	NO!!!!!|`|QY4Hy00qaa	No I do not think it is fair the women do the same thing that the men do and sometimes better.
KyShUk8kaa	Good list. I also thought of Denny Neagle who had a few very good years in Atlanta including a 20 win season. And as far as memorable, how can you forget about John Rocker. He had a couple good years in 98 and 99, and was quite a character. There was also Galaraaga even though he only played one season in the 90s it was a 44 homer campaign. Also, Fred McGriff had some very solid season. Finally, Andruw Jones.

Vkbgr94xaa	3-4.<br>  <br>  NT is the key and Stroud would be perfect in the 3-4.  But they could mix  in some 4-3 too.  It doesn't always have to be 1 or the other.|`|FZ8axozWaa	They should probably look into changing into a 4-3.  The secondary is looking strong for next year, and Posluzny is s solid linebacker in the middle.|`|htdI7Th5aa	well they should totally change it becuase 3-4 is so much better than 4-3|`|opOJPp9uaa	The 3-4 scheme is the best alignment to deploy the feared zone blitz from. If the Bills have the personnel for it, they should consider it. The only way the 4-3 works is if you can get a consistant pass rush from you down 4 linemen, ie the Dallas Cowboys of the '90's.

Ronaldo was the best player last season. But Zidane achieved his fame through many years of success. Zidane was consistently at his best every season. For Messi to be held at the same level, he has to perform at his best for many more years. And frankly, I think he will.

Its a shame Portugal might never win a world cup unless Cristiano Ronaldo becomes Spanish :-)...Lionel Messi, on the hand, has a very bright future ahead of him. He scored a goal today against Mallorca ;)...maradona style :P|`|5w2CJehZaa	You can't really say if Messi would be better than Zidane because you just can't compare such a talented, speedy forward with a tactical, smart playing midfielder. Its not right. Both of them are amazing in their positions, and as time goes by, Messi will become one of the greatest players alive. All the Argentinians will forget about Hernan Crespo, it'll be Messi all day every day.|`|iYsGaDbFaa	Zidane is a football legend and Messi is amazingly talented and still very young. At this moment, Messi is the best player in the world. I dont know if Messi is better than Zidane, each player had and will have his time to shine.

Messi is well on his way to becoming a legend just like Zidane!|`|kWL0WDRnaa	Messi is a great player and he is still no where near his full potential. He could end up one of the all-time greats. That said, Zidane was a three time world player of the year. Only Ronaldo (the brazilian, not that fairy from portugal) has accomplished that. And he won a world cup and euro with france. Messi has a long way to go, but he has a chance to be as good or better than Zidane. At least i think so|`|ZWyKCsqBaa	Well Messi is pretty young.

Like you said he does score in bunches, he did pretty well when he played he for the Pistons. <br>  <br>  I can tell that he's worked hard on his outside shooting, because he's never even been close to shooting 43% on threes. Thing is that now makes more dangerous I already know Flips can take it to the hole, but now you have respect that outside shot too.|`|AA10937834	when he was on the pistons i met the team and all of them were cool besides flip. flip was just rude compared to the rest of them. but besides his personality he is an ok player.|`|5FypDafWaa	me|`|C4mzZwiWaa	ME!|`|xRPjgGs1aa	I do

9d06cffec852de9a7554521403313f02aa	the Iverson trade was just a bad deal...I don't really know what people see in Dumars, honestly; someone who drafts Darko with the second pick in perhaps the strongest draft class of all time doesn't garner much respect from me.<br>  <br>  I certainly don't think that Iverson will be entirely unwanted, he can still score with the best of them as long as he's in an offense that gives him the green light on doing so.  However, I think he'll probably have to settle for a $5 million exception deal.  I don't see him winding up anywhere that could afford to pay him more than that.  No serious contenders will be below the cap, and Iverson, having won an MVP and multiple scoring titles, seems to genuinely care about winning a championship.  Also, a team like the Thunder would presumably be more concerned with developing their young players and conserving cap space.<br>  <br>  I think Orlando would be a pretty good fit, as Nelson isn't a point guard that needs to have the ball in his hands at all times, and the team could use another slasher to open up the court for Hedu, Lewis, and Reddick on the wings.  If that were to happen, that team would be pretty scary. Yet, I get the sense that they might be more concerned with chemistry issues than other teams, since they'll probably be a contender next year whether or not they make a serious move.<br>  <br>  Houston could also be a good fit if McGrady's surgery doesn't work out, as they could use some more offensive firepower and another ballhandler to run the pick & roll offense.<br>  <br>  I think Toronto is probably his most likely desitination.  Calderon doesn't seem like the type of guy that would be that upset about having to share the ball with Iverson, and Bosh would love to have somebody to take some pressure off of him offensively, especially down the stretch of games.  Also, I think the Raptors will be looking for a big deal to turn them into a contender and try to convince Bosh to stick around in the summer of '10.  If they choose to sign him (and potentially Marion, as well, who's a free agent this summer) to a one-year contract, they can always just let him and Bosh go if it doesn't work out and start rebuilding.|`|uhbrSW6Paa	Iverson is gettin old. I wouldn't say that his career is over though. I think that if the pistons keep this winning streak going and make it deep in the playoffs without using Allen that much, they would see it as a sign and release/trade him. I know that if the Pistons DO want a trade, teams would not hesitate to pick him up. I mean come on, hes not like Latrell Spreewell or any thing.

What you think?|`|wp6qFB9Qaa	AI is one of those players who needs to be the whole team to be effective. By that I meant that he needs to do everything in offense coz let's face it he's not a good spot up shooter or not a great 3 point shooter. He's just a slasher, so he needs to be the superstar and not the all star of the team... He might need an All- Star but he needs to take the remote of the whole team...|`|mff1vstNaa	His future seems pretty bleak. I mean, not many teams want him anymore and the Pistons is using him to clear cap space. He'll still have talent for years to come, but it'll be hard trying to find a team willing to pay his large salary, especially when teams are clearing cap space for 2010. I doubt he will retire, but look for him on the free agent's limbo next season.|`|13XU8cCKaa	They should keep him for veteran leadership off the bench.  Iverson had no chemistry as the starter and with Iverson off the bench they could be deadly next year.|`|yt05KPhBaa	A scorer who doesn't play great defense should be on the warriors, mavericks, suns.....|`|qOWJQ7hRaa	If he wants to win a championship, he might want to play 4 or 5 or more years, since he is 33 right now.|`|408da6bb55ad956c4a3f27375faa6ee5aa	i think if the pistons win the championship, then they r gonna sign him again. i agree if u put iverson in the starting lineup, the pistons r not getting anywhere cuz he doesent fit with their offence and basically ruins their whole offence. if iverson gives up his ego nd comes of the bench, then the pistons will become deadly. the bench of the pistons doesn't score alot but has great defenders. if u put iverson in the bench, the other 4 players feed of him nd the team becomes great.|`|Nuj1eScCaa	Oh no way he's retiring. It's not that Iverson is a bad player he just doesn't fit this detroit team. I'm sure as soon as free agent signing period begins he will have plenty of options.<br>  <br>  Most teams though that are content with their backcourt will be reluctant to sign him because of chemistry reasons. Most title contenders will probably not try to land Iverson. However teams building will definitely look at him, like New York or Golden State.|`|piZ4xDBqaa	It depends on Iverson.  His ego is going to have to accept the fact that he's not going to get a max deal.  If he wants to play for a team that has a chance to win it all, he'll probably have to come off the bench.  But if the Celtics are willing to take on Marbury, then anything is possible.|`|Ry4Jc96Aaa	no, he just doesn't fit with the pistons at all. and joe dumar just got him so they could trade him by the 2010 season for a good player/ and if you look at iverson play, hes good so his career being over isn't an opition. <br>  <br>  and if you want to bring that 3 game win streak they had a i belive 8 game win streak with iverson and without rip!|`|ni4YME93aa	Iverson certainly has the talent and skills to play more, but he's hard to fit into a system.  Put him on a bottom feeder team (say the Thunder) and he could be putting up great stats.  But as a competitor, I seriously doubt Iverson will retire.|`|Tgy7n4HLaa	I think it is I mean if the Pistons were to release him I don't think any team would sign him just for the simple fact that ever team he goes to he makes worse. I think AI should just retire.|`|6yoQhXsOaa	NO! He still has a lot in him!!|`|C4mzZwiWaa	HELL TO THE NO!!!

Also, if you are talking about franchise history, then you definitely have to take consideration of 5 SB wins.<br>  <br>  The 49ers look geared to start making a comeback.  Discipline under Mike Singletary has showed a considerable difference when he took over as the interim coach in 2008.  The talent is there and he is bringing the fire to these players.<br>  <br>  Al Davis is driving the franchise to the ground and has been the cancer to the team's development signing the wrong players for the type of team the HC wants to run.  He does not let the HC do their job.  He expects the HC to make the players he picks up work in the HC's offense or defense.  Even the players have openly showed displeasure on the team.

m5FyTeYgaa	Wow, you have strong opinions.<br>  <br>  1) I don't call it a sport. I call it harvesting food for my family.<br>  <br>  2) Life is cruel. We're born, we live, we die. Happens to every living thing. The deer is going to starve to death, die of disease, or be harvested by a hunter. Easy choice.<br>  <br>  3) Each state hires biologists trained to determine the maximum carrying capacity of the area. Hunting seasons, and limits are based on these capacities. Sometimes they also look at car accidents and damage to crops or shrubs. If you've only seen deer twice, I doubt you were looking.<br>  <br>  4) The idea is to harvest the animal in a humane way. That is why rifles are used, and not knives or spears. The deer lives a natural existence until harvested. Do yourself a favor and research the slaughtering of cows and chickens. See who is actually being cruel. Hunters don't want the game to suffer. We strive for quick kills.<br>  <br>  I know you already have your mind made up, but these are my answers to the points you made in your question.|`|GrwWH5XJaa	Because Americans are the only people who hunts on a full tummy.|`|QrjuueMCaa	Why arent bunny-huggers extinct yet?- and the whole granola-munching, double-latte sipping, Hummer driving, bleandin-heart 'thing' is making me ill.

Do you ever get up north?  I live in Bemidji, and for you to say they aren't overpopulated is ignorant and unimformed.  Have you ever shot a deer?  Didn't think so.  Bet you've never been to a slaughterhouse either.  If you had, you'd either quit eating meat or start shooting deer.  It's much more humane.|`|Dm1L9OQlaa	I'm a licensed concealed handgun owner. Not that its special to be one really but before the all your flaming commences I 'm just clarifying my position on guns in general.  <br>  <br>  As for the guys question about calling hunting a sport - eh. I dont really do it. Sports are suppose to be difficult. Shooting seems to easy to be called a sport to me. Frankly it doesn't take much skill to shoot a gun or a high powered bow. You point the end at something and move your index finger a tiny bit and bang. That reeeeeally doesnt take that much skill. Or maybe I just find it so easy that I personally do not think it takes skill. I guess I could be that great (hehe) I suppose others not so great might find it pretty difficult to point AND pull a trigger. <br>  I know - I know what your thinking (minus the expletives). What do you mean no skill? You have to aim at a target that is moving so its hard. yes you have to aim and to aim in front if something moving in a direction and that might seem complicated for some people - I guess. frankly most people are actually not shooting at a MOVING target but rather a stationary one that is munching on grass or feed. Gimme a break - moving target ya right. I guess if it hears you set down you beer can to pick up your gun it might be moving.<br>   If someone was shooting at say... flies and did it successfully and yes I'll even count those big *** horse flies then that I would have to admit would take some skill. But a deer come on now its not like they are small and hard to see. they are not camouflaged and they arent wearing armor. They aren't even waving a gun back  - although I would find that amusing if deer could shoot back. Then maybe I'd call it a sport, of sorts. Of course my big foam finger would be rooting for the deer hahahaha<br>  <br>  Sure sure every hunter wants to say it is difficult cause they want to feel proud like they accomplished something but lets be honest  - really honest -  if it took that much skill why are so many people able to do it and do it successfully oh and usually while being half drunk. <br>  <br>  I'm just keeping it real. I learned a long time ago not to take things on the internet so seriously. So lighten up on the guy. He is entitled to his opinion - it does take all kinds to keep society balanced after all.<br>  <br>  BTW if a person were trying to tackle an alert deer (not sleeping or at a feeder - feeders are totally BS cheating) anywaaaay trying to tackle an alert deer barehanded (that also means no ropes of anykind), just man on deer, 1 on 1 - no ganging up or using vehicles or cheating as such then ok I would call that a sport.|`|0Pkup44haa	If deer hunting was outlawed, it wouldn't take long for them to overpopulate. Then there wouldn't be enough food for the deer, and large numbers would die from starvation. Starving to death for days is a LOT worse than getting shot and to die in a few minutes. The reason you haven't seen too many deer is because the hunters are doing a good job keeping the population under control. It bugs me when euphorians don't know anything about hunting ans ask stupid questions about how cruel it is and all that.<br>  <br>  Oh, I live in Minnesota.|`|AA10441869	Any thing that takes skill and training can be thought of as a sport. I disagree with you and your opinion of the deer population. In many urban areas the deer herds have bloomed to the levels of becoming a problem. It includes lack of habitat, starvation, disease, deaths on the road ways. It is more cruel to have removed the deers natural predator and increased it population to the point of starvation. It in not cruel to kill with skill and quickness  rather than to have an animal starve to death.|`|gWsZVg3Eaa	adophius your a dumb ****** and hunting does take a lot of skill and to me it not only is a sport it is a way of life and where i live the deer are extremely over populated i see like 30 a day on  average|`|sVVXeVqHaa	most likely because if involves some sort of skill.|`|xDIpP9pTaa	i agree that it is cruel, but its a sport because it involves some skill. consider this: do you think that shooting at a target is a sport? if so, its mainly the same thing, but its a living thing that moves and can be more complicated. if you dont, well, it takes a while to get used to shooting a gun, and takes practice to get really good at it. so, the same thing right? in other sports you need to practice and stuff so its similar.

oqQjnpfGaa	GOOD TRADE! <br>  <br>  I think this trade will be good given that DG and CM are very risky players.  Also, they could be really frustrating players to own because of their lingering injuries. Lastly, DG (as good as he is) might actually shut it down for the year if the Pacers don't have a chance for the playoffs.  My guess is that DG will come back next week and play fine, but I still think they are both very risky players to own. <br>  <br>  For most nights, Ron Artest and Al Harrington will be more reliable players for you.  Right now, Artest is playing solid in Houston and Al Harrington will usually give you a double-double since he is one of the go-to-guys for the Knicks.  However, do expect some inconsistency from Harrington.|`|pX2ZraBVaa	if you can get them to do this trade then by certainly i think is a good idea<br>  <br>  i agree with you that the 2 u offer are definitely not gonna be up to par especially with injuries and whatnot....with maggette is better to trade him not before coming off the bench becomes a problem for him or injuries affect his season<br>  <br>  artest since coming from injuries has been amazing.....with mcgrady gone is going to be yao and artest alll the way and i dotn see how they can rely on yao for critical situations<br>  <br>  harrington for some reason has been understated this season....he plays great minutes can shoot 3s and points....considering krptonate's ankle injuries this guys going to be the go to guy for ny|`|i9eAnKsBaa	great trade

fUDlbOP0aa	the wasr and century arms are the same rifle. its a wasr 10 or 2 rifle imported by century arms. If you're looking for one of those try lanworldinc.com be aware of an extremely long wait, I ordered mine back in Nov 16 2008 and still waiting. Its cheap (affordable) though, at $437 each, unlike all the other places in the nation which has AK47 rifles at around $1000 or $750. It is California legal. I recommend the monsterman grip than locked magazine. at least then you can still have some fun with it. <br>  <br>  Local gunshows in southern California has several AK47 and similar rifles, starts at around $999 to $1299. Made in the USA by firing line or similar company, are high quality AK rifles very different from the AK47 rifles from interstate or century arms. They are also that much more expensive and mostly sport only poly furniture. I rented one and fired a polymer firing line AK47 rifle, I'm surprised at the high quality and accuracy of the rifle. The booth was set up from coldwarshooters I think. <br>  <br>  most AK/AR California legal stores:<br>  calguns.net <br>  <a href="http://www.calguns.net/Sponsors.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.calguns.net/Sponsors.html</a><br>  there are several stores here you can order or browse for an AK rifle you'd like to have. Generally around $1000 price tags.|`|8cWXhZGjaa	If your loaded with cash and into AK's I would recommend the Arsenal SLR-107CR that thing is tough like all AKs and is almost as accurate as an M-16. It's light weight and comes with a folding stock and universal accessory mounting. I own one and absolutely love it!<br>  <a href="http://www.gunbroker.com/Auction/ViewItem.asp?Item=123730982" rel="nofollow">http://www.gunbroker.com/Auction/ViewIte...</a>|`|K39KUpHeaa	dd's ranch in NY has some and they sell to CA by leaving out the mag and un-installing the grip before shipping for 600 which is about 80 higher than lanworldinc also gun broker always has some listed and can be shipped the same way, make sure the muzzle break is permanently attached and a mag lock installed and no folding stock before installing any pistol grip. I bought my dad one from entreprise arms last year and it was an inter ordinance one converted to CA legal with pistol grip and with crappy lead ammo my dad is shooting 4inch grops at 100 yards with a trijicon ACOG mounted to it. but they charge 1000 or more now for those and they dont seem to know what there doing. Try ar15.com's ak47 forum.|`|jJ4kf2xkaa	I own a Romanian AK and have to say its a great shooter. I have heard of mixed reviews off of WASR AKs. My AK gets 1" to 1.5"groups at 100 yds. I paid $375 for mine in 1999. I don't think I would pay more than $550 for an AK today. My advice - A gun is only as good as its shooter for accuracy. I would get one of the lower priced AK's and practice, practice, practice.
br1kwegaaa	Nope.  The RPI is always calculated based on current records, not date-of-game records.

LmnaF4gHaa	I would NOT advise ankle weights, because unless your entire body is in great physical condition it can cause knee and back pain.  You need to strengthen your legs, specifically your quads, glutes and calfs (in that order).  If you dont want to work out with weights, you can do squat jumps, lunges (or jump lunges), and calf raises.  You can also get a box and do box jumps.  Jump on top of the box, then immediately jump off, then jump again right after you land, making sure you have good posture and making sure your knees bend to at least 90 degrees on every landing.  These type of exercises are known as plyometrics, and you need to be sure to have good form when you do them, so do some more research.|`|Cv1FhPJmaa	lunges lunges lunges!! bby girl lunges strengthin yo legs and bout the weights your to young to be jumpin wit those your muscles will nnot understand but to start you could wear weights wen your at schoo wlkn in them helps a lot!!|`|t3Zuec0taa	Practice jumping with ankle-weights, or a heavy backpack, when spiking. Over time, your legs will strengthen and you'll be able to jump higher.

SpqYjlVpaa	Ebay is a good place to find current market value, but you need to look at completed auctions, not auctions that are still running.

AA10160841	I think everyone gets nervous this time of year!  I really hope that my team doesn't make any major moves.  I'm a Pens fan, so I really hope that Max Talbot, Jordan Stall, or Sergei Gonchar don't get traded because they are great players with a lot of personality and talent.  I really hate the trades.  There have been some really stupid ones in the past...like getting rid of Colby Armstrong, Ryan Malone, Mark Recci, and the biggest one- Jaomir Jagr.  But as far as your team goes, the Rangers seem to be having a good year.  I highly doubt that any of your key players will get traded.  If you have a player that hasn't been playing well lately, with a lot of gusto, there is a slight possibility they might make a trade, or if your team is weak in a certain area (defense or offense-wise.)  But seeing as they are doing well, the chances aren't as high that there will be many trades in the Rangers future.|`|0Umym3h9aa	The Rangers are in playoff contention so they probably won't make any major moves.

Y3KMLdjWaa	Being this is new to you and you'll be racing in one of the beginner classes, just go out and have fun. I've competed in mtn bike racing for a long time and very few of those in the beginner class race on light weight XC race bikes, most are on hardtails or full susp. bikes with 4~6" of travel. If you enjoy racing get that lightweight race bike for next year.|`|Cl6KbcAGaa	Sure you can but dont expect to be up front with this much weight unless you are a powerhouse on the pedals. You are moving too much weight as compared to others that will likely have bikes in the 23-under 30 lb range and I can assure you that there are absolutely NO CHANGES to this bike that will make a difference for $100 you would need to multiply that # by 200% to make any real difference but by then you would have a better bike made of carbon fiber anyway. I am not sure what you mean by only 12 ever made but if you are talking about this bike then I wouldnt be too certain about that. It wasnt produced in huge #s but there were certainly more than 12 made. You could make some changes for right at $1000 or so but that would be a minimum # to make any difference and that would be a new wheelset only: Mavic Crossmax SLX 2008 would be your best bet.|`|S4qLj0CCaa	yea your bike is normal for an xc race just try to lockout your rear suspension if you have this feture on your bike.<br>   and if you have the special haro with the travel adjustment front fork adjust the travel to around 100mm of travel so you have better controll at tighter corners.

Vw0ry8Ylaa	For a good website on knots, see:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.netknots.com/html/fishing_knots.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.netknots.com/html/fishing_kno...</a><br>  <br>  You'll quickly find that you only need a few knots -- you don't need to know them all. Learn what you need then learn as you go. It's a good idea to have a little cheater book or note card with you, because when you start out, you'll forget some crucial step in a knot and you'll wonder why it keeps slipping. I have a little book of knots that I keep in my vest.<br>  <br>  Regarding tackle and pole setup, it sort of depends on the kind of fishing you'll do. Spincasting? Fly fishing? Bait fishing? Set up really varies from pole to pole, water to water, and fish to fish. Browse here for some good basic info on a variety of fishing:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.takemefishing.org/fishing/fishopedia/how-to-fish" rel="nofollow">http://www.takemefishing.org/fishing/fis...</a><br>  <br>  Then, when taking your boy out to fish, remember a couple things.<br>  <br>  First, it's very important that you find out where to fish and what to fish with in your area. Then outfit yourself accordingly and maybe sneak away for a recon trip before you take your kid. If you just head out for some water and drop any ole thing in the water, you'll be skunked and frustrated, and your boy's newfound interest in fishing may suffer by it. Go to your local sporting goods stores or fly shops and beg for tips, get a fishing proclamation while you're there, and talk to local anglers. Good info is as important or moreso than good gear. <br>  <br>  Next, you should not plan on doing any productive fishing yourself. Make it about your boy, at least until he is up to speed. Sure, take along your outfit and fish with him, but plan on spending most of your time untangling, unfowling, retackling, and talking him through the trip. When fishing with young kids, bait fishing is usually your best bet, even though it's distasteful to some. Depending on where you are, there may be a fish hatchery or fish farm -- if the kid is very young, you might consider that route. <br>  <br>  Also, I'd say over equip yourself -- take more lures and gear than you think you'll need. With both you and your boy lacking somewhat in experience, you will likely lose or break some gear, and you'll need more line than you'll think possible. Take a couple extra rods, even, if you can.<br>  <br>  Finally, don't rely on the fish for fun. Manage the boy's expectations. It's called "fishing," not "catching," and there's a reason for that. You may not (I should say probably won't) catch any fish on your first trip, but if you take along some lunch, go swimming or hiking, camp out, or whatever, there will be more to remember than just vainly watch your line for a tug.<br>  <br>  Good luck -- fishing with your son will take you to some of the most frustrating and the most rewarding days you'll spend with him. Savor both! Watching him learn and progress to a point where he can rig up and find fish on his own will almost immobilize you with pride.|`|DNwq3m5yaa	It's great you're going fishing with your son. Here is a link to a good site that should help you get started.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.takemefishing.org/fishing/fishopedia/how-to-fish" rel="nofollow">http://www.takemefishing.org/fishing/fis...</a><br>  <br>  If your son is younger, you may want to use a bobber with some live bait like worms or minnows.  All he will have to do is focus on the bobber and set the hook.  If he's older, he could use a small spinner bait like a rooster tail that bass love.  Just cast it out and retrieve it at a quick and steady speed so that the blades spin.  This can be more fun for him since the casting and retrieving will give him something to do.  When a fish bites, he'll know it too.  <br>  <br>  Good luck on your fishing trip and have fun.|`|RxTIzsyhaa	This here link should give ya' all you'll need to know bout' startin' the sport of fishin' again, with the exception of catchin' the fish itself;).

First thing you do is make and loop. Then wrap that loop around your finger. Then you take the tip of the loop and insert it through the loop. Do it twice for 2 hooks. I have provided a previous answer of mine below if you plan to do some freshwater fishing.I would buy pretied hooks and bass sinker weights. Tie the weight on the end like you would when you tie you shoe but do it twice. To tie on the hooks insert the head of the hook into your ganglion loop and back into the loop at the end of your hook line.Pull afterwards .I will get back to you soon , there more I got to tell you about. Here is a book where I learn to tie all my knots and rigs <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Field-Stream-Baits-Rigs-Handbook/dp/1592282350/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1236210252&sr=8-2." rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Field-Stream-Baits...</a> When you hook your baits make sure you expose the barb so youll hook them easier and make sure it looks natural. Just to let you know dont be afraid of asking a angler for help. I learned flyfishing by asking a stranger angler. Of course if they look untrustworthy/dangerous then I probably would not ask them<br>  <br>  For trout I would recommend a medium-light action rod and reel and preferably a spinner reel. Since it is a lake I would recommend bait and lures as your primarily means to get those trout. I would use 4lb-8lb monofilament line , #10-18 salmon egg hook, #8-18 baitholder hook, egg weights, split shot weights, and regular basscaster weights. The size of the weights must be from 1/8-1/16oz. Make sure you bring a variety of sizes and weights. For bait grasshoppers, worms, and crayfish should work. Lures I would recommend any spoon or spinner of your liking. I personally use Kastmaster, South Bend Spoons, and joes flies. For the spinning lure use that in any condition besides swift water currents. Basically you tie the lure at the end of your line and some split shot weights above if necessary.Cast it out there and reel in a variety of speeds and motions. As for the spoons it works well in any condition but excels at swift movign currents. But I do recommend in bringing it along because it covers the bottom of the pond better than a spinner.Just as the spinner tie the lure at the bottom of your line and use weights if necessary. For bait fishing for trout the ganglion and powerbait rigs work best. <a href="http://irvinelake.net/irv/viewtopic.php?..." rel="nofollow">http://irvinelake.net/irv/viewtopic.php?...</a><br>  The link provided is the powerbait rig. Basically you just cast it out and wait or you can reel in slowly if you want too.<br>  <br>  The next thing is looking for the right conditions and structures. Any river, creek , or body of water that flows in are good places where to fish next too. Deeper pools are perfect places. Calmer water is a good place. Rocks, logs, and dropoffs are good places to fish at.<br>  <br>  For catfish it is the same concept but you need a thick fishing rod and strong reel. I would recommend 20lb-60lb line and any weights that is heavy enough to get it out there. You can use the ganglion or the modified powerbait rig. Basically you have a eggsinker on top, swivel, and then hook on the bottom. I would use baitholder or octopus hooks about the size of a half dollar at least. For bait mackeral, shrimp, liver, and crayfish work well. As with trout look for those stuctures<br>  <br>  For the bluegill fish in rocky areas and weeded areas. I would use worms and they will go for it. A basic ganglion rig would do.<br>  <br>  Youcan also use marshmellows and salmon eggs for trout. If you are not doing good in an area move every15-60minutes. Fish in the morning and at late afternoon-dusk for trout. For catfish anytime but at sunset to late morning are their primary feeding time. Try to scout the lakes and the area. If you see alot of grasshoppers crayfish then that is probably what you want to use.

I would not trade those memories for anything. I am sure things will go great on your trip..maybe try packing a lunch..eating and doing a little fishing..and just have a good time..I hope the trip goes well..best wishes

lECmz3SEaa	For trout I would recommend a medium-light action rod and reel and preferably a spinner reel. Since it is a lake I would recommend bait and lures as your primarily means to get those trout. I would use 4lb-8lb monofilament line , #10-18 salmon egg hook, #8-18 baitholder hook, egg weights, split shot weights, and regular basscaster weights. The size of the weights must be from 1/8-1/16oz. Make sure you bring a variety of sizes and weights. For bait grasshoppers, worms, and crayfish should work. Lures I would recommend any spoon or spinner of your liking. I personally use Kastmaster, South Bend Spoons, and joes flies. For the spinning lure use that in any condition besides swift water currents. Basically you tie the lure at the end of your line and some split shot weights above if necessary.Cast it out there and reel in a variety of speeds and motions. As for the spoons it works well in any condition but excels at swift movign currents. But I do recommend in bringing it along because it covers the bottom of the pond better than a spinner.Just as the spinner tie the lure at the bottom of your line and use weights if necessary. For bait fishing for trout the ganglion and powerbait rigs work best. <a href="http://irvinelake.net/irv/viewtopic.php?..." rel="nofollow">http://irvinelake.net/irv/viewtopic.php?...</a><br>  The link provided is the powerbait rig. Basically you just cast it out and wait or you can reel in slowly if you want too.<br>  <br>  The next thing is looking for the right conditions and structures. Any river, creek , or body of water that flows in are good places where to fish next too. Deeper pools are perfect places. Calmer water is a good place. Rocks, logs, and dropoffs are good places to fish at.<br>  <br>  For catfish it is the same concept but you need a thick fishing rod and strong reel. I would recommend 20lb-60lb line and any weights that is heavy enough to get it out there. You can use the ganglion or the modified powerbait rig. Basically you have a eggsinker on top, swivel, and then hook on the bottom. I would use baitholder or octopus hooks about the size of a half dollar at least. For bait mackeral, shrimp, liver, and crayfish work well. As with trout look for those stuctures<br>  <br>  For the bluegill fish in rocky areas and weeded areas. I would use worms and they will go for it. A basic ganglion rig would do.<br>  <br>  Youcan also use marshmellows and salmon eggs for trout. If you are not doing good in an area move every15-60minutes. Fish in the morning and at late afternoon-dusk for trout. For catfish anytime but at sunset to late morning are their primary feeding time. Try to scout the lakes and the area. If you see alot of grasshoppers crayfish then that is probably what you want to use. Last but not least enjoy and relax|`|qXQa06bAaa	Depends what you're using for bait........<br>  If you're using spinners like these things:<br>  <a href="http://www.panthermartin.com/Lures/Spinners.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.panthermartin.com/Lures/Spinn...</a><br>  Then you cast them at a likely looking fish holding spot, then reel them in like you do with bass fishing.<br>  <br>  If you're using baits such as Worms / Sweetcorn / Berkley Powerbait, etc with a float (bobber) or legered (with a weight / sinker)... cast it at a likely looking fish holding spot (anywhere they can use as shelter / ambush food).... then wait for about 5 - 15mins (or until you get a bite)..... though sometimes it may help to very gently tweak the line back towards you every 3 - 7mins or so.|`|KJWxqQHiaa	One of my fishing buddies, and me went to fish for trout today. We tried MANY different lures, such as ...<br>  <br>  Rooster tails, Floating minnows, shallow diving crankbaits, and beetle spins.<br>  <br>  One lure worked, it was a lure that looks like the Rat-L-Trap which is made by Cotton Cordell, called the Super Spot. It was a miniature sized version, which i am not able to find online. It came from Wal-Mart, though.<br>  In a firetiger/bleeding perch pattern we (he) managed to land one trout, a 10 incher. Hey, nothing else worked.<br>  <br>  Hope i helped ya out.|`|933YqFLNaa	Been fishing for them for decades - if you don't fly fish then the next best thing is....<br>  <br>  Berkley Power Bait or Uncle Josh's dough baits but beware color is everything. One color may work today and catch nothing tomorrow. My favorites are...in order    yellow-corn or yellow-meal colored, next is chartruse or white & chartruse, FL orange and last is FL Pink. Roll the bait into a ball just large enough to cover the hook(s).<br>  <br>  Fished as follows...<br>  <br>  size 14 or 16 treble hook  >>>>  14-20 "  4# or 6# leader >>> size 14 barrel swivel >>>  1/8 oz egg sinker or 1/4oz sinker...then you cast out and wait - I usually don't keep the line tight I leave some slack in it, then I watch - when they take the bait the line will go out - then I set the hook. If it's windy I don't leave much slack in the line.<br>  <br>  In a river or stream I use night crawlers or worms with a size 12 / 14 hook with just enough weight (or no weight) split shot sinkers.<br>  <br>  If you're really confident you can use 2# line instead of 4 or 6 !!<br>  <br>    If you aren't going to keep the trout DON'T use a treble hook use a regular hook with the barb cut off.  <br>  <br>  ** NEVER use CORN it kills trout because they can't poop it out - it is a very painful and useless death. ***|`|WeDGX0onaa	Ah trout are very fun and easy to catch. Usually what 3 methods I use which work well is one I use a 3-way swivel about a foot or two above the bottom and use orange power bait which you can find at fishing stores. Another way I use to catch them is use a carolina rig (if you don't know what that is look at google images) and use a blown up worm which means you put air in the worm to make it float, I usually put the worm a foot above the ground. Another way to catch trout is put power bait ( which floats ) on the hook with a worm which will also makes the worm float, the trout can almost never pass up on this. When I say to make the worm float I don't mean make the worm sit on top of the water, I mean make it float up from the bottom of the lake. Sorry if I made this sound complicated, it's really not. Hope I helped ya|`|vv0v03SHaa	here is a nice article on catching trout. all realy depends on how you plan to fish. The article covers a lot.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.associatedcontent.com/article/995688/how_to_catch_brown_trout.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.associatedcontent.com/article...</a>|`|k2AXx3C2aa	For live or dead bait, check to see what the trout has in the area to naturally eat, they will most likely eat whats more "natural" to there habitat as far as live/dead bait. Atleast that's what I've read can't remember where otherwise I'd give props. Never used live or dead bait so wouldn't be able to tell you a casting technique or such.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, I use spinners for artificial bait for trout here in Texas on the guadalupe river (canyon lake discharge) so far caught one that was 22inches ( a local showed me a really decent "fishing hole"). Apparently trout are attracted to "shiny" objects. As far as casting technique, I just casted slightly up river and slowly reeled in.<br>  Any small to medium size spinners  should work, I also heard that depending on the color of the water (murky/clear) whether or not to use gold or silver colored spinners never really had a chance to test it though.<br>  <br>  Tip: Also if you have a hard time getting your spinner out far enough a guy at Ace hardware was telling me to try to attach a bobber and a small weight with the spinner in tow sounded like a mess to me though.|`|JSzd77C0aa	I'd suggest try to fish for them.

This is the deal with your shirt...<br>  <br>  Both teams in the Super Bowl make thousands of printed shirts before the game is played.  At the end of the Super Bowl, which ever team has won has the privilege to show off and celebrate by wearing their shirts, the losing team needs to find out how to get rid of their worthless merchandise (worthless because there is no 2nd place in the Super Bowl).  This is where Kenya, Africa comes into the picture.

dQeiokHRaa	Personally, I've never used a Brine before, since you can't buy them where I live. There are a few things to consider when buying a stick though:<br>  1. What position you play. Depending on where you play, the weight of your stick will vary. Backs want a heavier stick, while halves want a mid-weight and forwards want a light-weight stick. If you don't know what position you'll be playing, a mid-weight will be fine.<br>  2. What you want your stick to be made out of. If it's your first time and you're just playing socially, a wooden stick is the way to go for juniors. I don't rate them particularly, since there is no power in them. Composites (made with fiberglass among other things) are great, because much of the power is generated simply by performing the task correctly. If you hit a ball with a wooden stick and then with a composite, the ball hit by the composite will have much more power behind it. These are especially great because they allow you to focus on technique rather than power.<br>  2. The stick is weighted properly. To make sure your stick is weighted properly, make a fist around the stick, where the tape ends, and hold the stick flat horizontally. The head of the stick (where the curve is) should tip the stick forward slightly.<br>  3. The head size. Maxi refers to the size of the head, and is the head size that is most commonly sold in general stores. If you want a different size head, you usually have to go to a specialist hockey store or get one made specifically. Maxi's are the most common head, and work well on all size sticks and for all positions.<br>  4. The height. The stick should reach roughly between your hip and belly button. If you're on the taller side, it can be hard to find sticks above 37.5 inches in most general sports stores. Going to a proper field hockey store will provide you with a greater height range, as long with a better quality of sticks, so you're best bet is to buy one from a proper store.<br>  5. Personal preference. Personally, I use a Mazon ProForce 1000. Mines about an inch shorter than standard guidelines, but that's my personal preference and that's what I feel most comfortable with. So really, it all comes down to what you like and what you can afford.|`|axxQzOCHaa	I know nothing about field hockey, but I used to have a Brine lacrosse stick and it was pretty good.

If you are a good pitcher that is a plus because good pitchers are hard to find. find someone who can play catch with you to start out with. then have them hit fly balls to you. the more you do this the better you will get. if you can catch the ball well, maybe you could try out for the first baseman's position as well at pitcher. the field is easy to remember. standing on home plate, the field on your right side would be right field, the field on your left side, would be of course left field and the one in the middle is the center field. don't worry about the signs. each team makes up their own signs and everyone has to learns them. it sounds like fun, i have always enjoyed playing and watching. good luck to you..play ball|`|4ZJBzrK3aa	The one way to become a good softball player is PRACTISE!

ceebuRIIaa	the best place to buy is probally the local skate shop if you don't have one try these online skate stores ccs.com or skateamerica.com the best deck depends on how you do stuff are you vert or street or do you do lots of big jumps but the ones i think are good are 1.planb strong 2.element beginner board 3.mystery good pop 4.darkstar. light 5.girl good flip|`|InX5Pfl5aa	Well your local skate shop is always the best place to buy at.<br>  <br>  The best deck depends on you.<br>  <br>  My favorite is probably Darkstar Amour Light Or Birdhouse.<br>  <br>  Both are easy to Pop and Land on.<br>  <br>  Both are also very hard to break =D.|`|SCs2inCsaa	Best place to buy is at local shops. <br>  <br>  You can buy MiniLogo Completes for cheaper.

310m2T4Daa	They will probably have a diva win both of them and it will become the Undisputed Women's Champion|`|tuwHboNnaa	Yeah i agree. The divas title is pretty pointless to be honest, as there is only a hand full of divas that are worthy of holding a title in the WWE. As for the tag titles well there is only like 3 or 4 proper tag teams in the WWE, so there  is no need for two sets of belts. They should merge both and have the titles as cross branded.|`|yL9sgWpZaa	I think its better two different titles. So both shows can have one female champion.|`|qwdh7N6saa	not really.|`|fmUGHvgHaa	nop|`|sqfjfR3iaa	No, I like the idea that divas can werestle on Raw and Smackdown and win Championships on each show. If we had only one champion, she would have to defend her title on both shows. Why should she have to wrestle at House Shows, Television Tapings and Live Events for both brands every week.

Best matches feud wise I think are Triple H vs Randy Orton and Jeff Hardy vs Matt Hardy. Randy Orton attacked the Mcmahons, including Triple H's wife Stephanie, so thats how that started. Orton also won the Royal Rumble. Also at Royal Rumble, Matt Hardy backstabbed his brother Jeff and cost him the WWE championship. I wouldnt be surprised if we see Edge vs John Cena at 'Mania as well|`|wum4X78maa	Well WWE is still a great hobby so I would reccomend that you do get back into it. Well WrestleMania 25 is shaping up to become subparb. It will be Shawn Michaels vs. The Undertaker for the Takers' streak. Jeff Hardy vs. Matt Hardy in a Grudge Match. The Money in the Bank ladder match with 3 competitors confirmed CM Punk,Kane, and Mark Henry. It will be Randy Orton vs. Triple H for the WWE Championship also a Grudge match and a good one too I feel sorry that you haven't seen RAW the last 3 weeks. And it will either be Edge vs. Big Show for the World Heavyweight Championship although I wouldn't be surprised if they threw John Cena in it and made it a Triple Threat Match. So in my opinion last years might trump this years but I could be wrong.|`|PXlrpUsLaa	1st answer is right<br>  EXCEPT<br>  its Edge vs Big Show for the WHC<br>  <br>  but it probley will be Cena in it|`|310m2T4Daa	Look on www.wwe.com and look on the raw/smackdown rebounds and sooner or later you'll get some ecw one's in there.
lc6pOD3vaa	thats coool. im goin to the magic game in boston on sunday. i like the magic and jj is nasty. i wicked want to get his auto too along with supaman and lewis. alright now to how to get his autograph. i have celtics season tickets and i get inside the arena 2 hours b4 the game. usually ther are a couple players shooting around and i sit next to where the players go in to the lockeroom and just wait till after ther done to ask them. jj should sign he seems nice so i think he will. im geting it on a card. im stoked good luck getting it.|`|Tgy7n4HLaa	He'll sign it but you have to be at the arena at least an hour and a half before the game starts because he will be shooting around. So you stand by the tunnel and he will sign it after he is done shooting around and when he is done he will sign autographs. That's how I got mine.
SPleGlS1aa	This depends entirely on where you live.  In most states in the U.S. you just sell them as you would any other property.  A few states require you to sell them through a licensed dealer (California for one) or sell only to a person who has a license to own a gun (New York City for example).  Foreign countries also have different rules.|`|yaq7oaH6aa	Sympathy for your loss.<br>  As Executor of the Estate, or a private party, Federally, <br>  you are free to sell any firearms that you possess, <br>  but not as a business.<br>  State Laws on transfers vary. Few States require the registry <br>  of long guns.<br>  (If you live in N.Y.C., just case them and drive them upstate <br>  and sell them to avoid hassles.)<br>  If they're that old, and in good shape, they possibly have <br>  'collector' value.<br>  As Executor it might be your responsibility to get an appraisal, <br>  (under 'conservation and collection of assets'),<br>  but first look for the Make/Model of each at www.GunAuction.com <br>  to get an idea if it's worthwhile.<br>  (There might be a chance to protect some assets from the taxes <br>  here if they have value and are distributed as 'personnal possessions'.)<br>  If they've been in the family for three generations, you might <br>  consider passing them on as heirlooms.|`|fcc5487b88b4303d263e3ddb1df9a865aa	most generally you can sell them without worry or paperwork involved,even though this is legal i would make each buyer put each gun in their name(for your own safety,if they arent pre 68 guns,pre 1968 guns didnt have to have serial numbers so those would be good to go without paperwork and transfer)if you sell a gun to a nut job that isnt supposed to have one you can get in bad trouble if he does something stupid with it(if somehow it can be traced back to you as the seller)-go with the buyer and make him transfer it into his/her name at your local ffl dealer(usually any gun shop but some people have a small buisness and an ffl so they can put it in the new persons name thru the atf) and as someone mentioned,get them appraised first so your not getting bottom dollar for the firearms(it would suck if you sold a gun for $300 and it turned out to be worth $10,000  ya know)|`|UrNVuFx6aa	The others have already covered most of it, but I would like to add one thing: Before you start selling them be sure you get each appraised so you don't sell them for less than their value. A good gun shop or antique firearms dealer should be able to give you the fair market value and may be able to give you a little history on each. Sometimes the history can make the gun more valuable. Who knows, your Dad may have a gun that was owned by someone important before he bought it.|`|bgxYKsGiaa	check your local laws but most places you can just sell them|`|f3f63c87e27f64c3e9f1679c165409b8aa	Really depends on your state.  In most of them however, No.

pUus16BYaa	Each team has a second round pick. They are traded often to get other players for those teams that are thinking of the future instead of right now. So 30 teams about 10 rounds or so a year, so a lot of kids get drafted.|`|O5Q4GP59aa	It's not the second pick overall; it's the second ROUND pick.|`|x9GODf8eaa	You are a little confused here. I will explain it.<br>  <br>  Each round consists of 30 picks. If no trades happened, then each team would have 1 pick each round. So basically, there are 30 first round picks, 30 second round picks, 30 third round picks, etc out there being traded around or kept.|`|e0jIVJSUaa	Each team is given one pick per round per draft.  They can trade the rights to their pick to another team.  Before the draft takes place, each team's pick is assigned a number, regardless of who now possesses it.  Thus, whoever possesses the NY Islander's 1st round 2009 draft pick (and it's not necessarily the NY Islanders) will likely (but not assuredly) get the first pick this year.|`|FZRWMc3Baa	Each team gets a pick in each round of the draft.  Obviously that's before they start trading them in desperation to add THE piece of the puzzle that they hope will put them over the top.
GERlmBIUaa	He was an excellent player look at his accomplishments as a player: Wilkens placed second to Wilt Chamberlain in the 1967-1968 MVP balloting. Wilkens was a nine-time NBA All-Star, and was named the 1971 NBA All-Star Game MVP in 1971. He led the league in assists in the 1969-70 season, and at the time of his retirement, Wilkens was the NBA's second all-time leading playmaker, behind only Oscar Robertson... best answer plz<br>  <br>  BQ: It's a great state but may not be the best...|`|JD5NQxeNaa	Lenny Wilkens is a NBA Hall of Fame player and was the 2nd best player in the NBA after Wilt in his domination years. Took and won the Sonics to an NBA title (their only 1 as a franchise). He had great court vision and was an adept passer and scorer. Finished 2nd to Wilt in MVP voting 3 times and once to Russell and was a 9x NBA All-star. If I was you I would consider that a compliment.<br>  <br>  And, no Indiana is not the best state for basketball.

TMnaUQKhaa	Yes, Korolev is a talented player but he depends too much on his power, so unfortunately it was a VERY windy day on the final and he couldnt make the shots he used too.<br>  On the other hand Mardy Fish played a great game, his serve was very reliable which helped him, and his experience in finals helped him a lot too. Korolev has never been in a final, and he had 3 set points but couldnt convert the points so he ended up losing in straight sets!<br>  <br>  Mardy Fish isnt really considered the king of Delray he only has a lot of fans because he's american, and he was the first top seeded player in the tournament to win in the final. He's never won this title before, to be considered to king. Last year Blake had a chance to become the first top seeded player to win but he lost to a qualifier, Kei Nishikori.<br>  <br>  Hope that explains it a bit :)|`|Y31Ci8vlaa	No.

You shouldn't be holding your breath when swimming. You should breathe when you need one so that you can keep swimming and exercising your body.  When you do this, you can be sure being breathless is because you are exercising hard.  Another trick is to check your pulse.  At your age, your pulse should be 160 or more per minute.

rv6zl5t3aa	As usual, this is aboot the biggest deal the B's will do, along with the Montador deal. Nothing like picking up a 41yr old at the deadline as your "big splash". And as I figured, the Pronger thing was not gonna happen, but we did get another Duck defenseman.....OOOOOHHH, I'm so excited and I just can't hide it.<br>  <br>  Thoughts are, the Bruins NEVER make a big deal to help them win a cup. Jacobs is to cheap and won't allow it. One bad free agent signing (Kevin Stevens) and the owner gets scared.<br>  <br>  BTW Guerin is heading to the Pens, I would have rather him than Recchi if I wanted an old man on the team.|`|jwPf5rsiaa	I think he'll do what is asked of him in Boston. No questions asked. The Bruins have a wack of young talent and Recchi might be the guy to get them through a nerve racking playoff run.<br>   JMO|`|a9f693c71e4b465afcc9a6b377b02694aa	Great fit.  Recchi is an extremely good player for a 41 yr old.  He has a lot of experience having won the cup a couple of times, and he's a great guy in the dressing room.<br>  <br>  Unlike a lot of people his age, he can still produce points (45 points in 62 games is a 60 point pace).  <br>  <br>  Same with Montador, a great dressing room presence who can keep players loose.  <br>  <br>  Between these two additions, I think the Bruins have done a great job of stabilizing themselves for the remainder of the season.  Both players have experienced the Stanley Cup final and can bring the playoff experience with them.<br>  <br>  Does Matt Recchi join the Bruins as a scout?  He seems to follow his older brother around.|`|SnTuaKcJaa	Take him! He gave nothing to the Lightning team.
zFTSg47waa	Well, if you do your fair share of practicing, you should know at least a few shooting exercises. What kind of stuff are you practicing now?<br>  <br>  Really, the quickest way to improve your game is to identify a weakness and work on it. It may be pattern play, positioning, using english, controlling draw/follow, banks, kicks, the list goes on. There are a few online resources that have drills for a number of these skills. There are also some good books that do too (Phil Capelle and Robert Byrne come to mind right away, but there are plenty of others).|`|75GcSkF6aa	depends on what skill level you are at now<br>  <br>  if you are just beginning, <br>  <br>  first you want a  way to improve on shooting straight longer shots and practicing your follow through<br>  <br>  a good tip for that is to, instead of pulling the stick up or back after striking the cue ball, is to leave the stick out there, evenkeeping it moving it forward in the dirction you hit the ball. Doing that helps you hit straighter  and used to a good follow through if practiced enough. <br>  <br>  Don't try and kill the ball, Pool is about 1% hitting the ball hard, and  99% ball control<br>  <br>  there are a lot of tips out there, but many depend on your skill level|`|OmKtUijpaa	what i always did was to just sit around and practice my english and maybe some bank shots. Just set one ball out on the table and shoot it in. or put another ball out as an obstacle and try to shoot around it.|`|rGWiOVDIaa	Seems like when I play someone who's good I play better. More accurate, harder shots, better ball placement, higher percent of balls sunk per shot. But when I play my friends who are not so good then I do horribly. Less aim mostly. So I guess that idea is to keep yourself challenged. If you are a high level try joining a league just to keep things up. At one of the main pool hall's I go to they have trick classes and beginner to high level classes. Just seeing other peoples style can do allot. Knowing your opponent helps. Like I know my sweetie (we meet playing in a league :D) can do bank shot's but can't do cut shots. So I try to block him that way.<br>  <br>  Happy playing :D<br>  Beth

smcDn76jaa	I would love to see that. There are so many tag team combinations I want to see in the WWE, that will never happen. They would improve the tag team division if they were allowed to compete regularly like Miz and Morrison do. It's not like Benjamin and Haas have been doing anything lately so they should tag team. Plus with the other possible good teams *cough* Kofi and Bourne *cough* then the division really would be a million times better.<br>  <br>  WQ- I believe I have already answered that question.|`|hkAcgIMbaa	It would be a great idea to bring them back together because at the moment WWE smackdown tag team division is **** and with Haas and Benjamin there would be some great matches in tag team for e.g Benjamin and Haas vs The Colons vs Morrison and Miz TLC Match it would be an amazing match. But as good as that sounds there pushing Benjamin to have a long us title reign and are pushing him up to the top I reckon.|`|sqfjfR3iaa	Yes, I asked Charlie Haas that very question at a WWE Fan Fest Event in Orlando, Florida last year wrestlemania XXIV Week and he said never say never. He said he and Shelton keep in touch. they were great as Team Angle and The World's Greatest Tag Team.|`|bySKI0ATaa	definately and to make it even better, kurt angle return, team angle return!|`|g4cYFVrmaa	Yes, but only if they pushed them.|`|ZbNXVQu7aa	Before I answer whether I would like to see it or not, I'm going to list the things I do NOT want to see after the team has been reunited.<br>  <br>  1. Charlie Haas being a "wigger" (that pretty much made their second run a joke that wasn't even funny)<br>  2. WGTT impersonating legendary tag teams (they've done enough as a team to deserve legitimate storylines, and perhaps a few more title reigns as well)<br>  3. Shelton Benjamin keeping his hair blonde (it reminds me of Dennis Rodman, and it doesn't fit the team)<br>  <br>  As long as the WWE "creative team" doesn't make any of those mistakes, a reunion of the World's Greatest Tag Team could truly be special, which would make it a good idea that I would like to see come to fruition.|`|Q1MI6L96aa	If the company wants to kick-start the dead-end in the tag team division, it wouldn't hurt. Benjamin is a non-title match jobber and the company seems dumbfounded on what to do with him...and he is perhaps the finest athlete in WWE.|`|1z7M3Tntaa	Yeah the tag team division needs some new life to it  I completely agree|`|oAjbBLDpaa	Yea, I think it would be the best move in both their careers since they are almost certainly not going to the main event with their current status in the WWE. They are both amazingly underrated considering their technical abilities.<br>  <br>  Their old tag team had great chemistry and would love to see it again, a match with Miz and Morrison or Carlito and Primo would be great and could develop into a good feud.|`|4tvI9WYjaa	yeah i want them to get back since th split up which really suck and left a big hole in the tag team division<br>  i would really like to see Shelton Benjamin and charlie Haas vs john Morrison and the miz how great off a match that be ?<br>   sheltn benjamin and charlie hass was probably the best tag team since kane and the undertaker and the hardy boys and the miz and john morrison is the best current tag team on the roster i really think the worlds greatest tag team should reunit and give the miz and john morrison compitione. <br>  also paul london should never got released he should come back and team with brin kendrick and now that be hell off tag team division <br>  <br>  wq  hell yeah shelton benjamin is great in singles but he is not really getting the push he needs. and plus charlie hass is not really dong to well on raw tag team is where   he should be|`|NXktxy8jaa	Yes! Even though they were not a fan favorite Tag Team, they sure did have the talent. They are both very gifted WWE Athletes that have a lot of potential in them and they deserve another Tag Team Reign if not a singles Title Reign! Charlie Haas has The Martial Arts Background and Shelton Benjamin can simply just "wow" the crowd with his amazing In-Ring Skills. The Tag Team Division is horrible these days but with Benjamin and Haas put back as a Tag Team on Raw Or even Smackdown, they can possibly bring it back to its Former Amazing Matches and Moments. Miz And Morrison would be a great opponent for them and it would make a great feud.<br>  <br>  WQ: Yes, Like I Said Above!|`|S0u3HKzhaa	Yeah definitely.They were a great Tag-Team.I think they did better as a tag-team then they do in their solo careers.I think the wwe should use them as a tag-team again because really they aren't doing anything productive with Haas he is just really not doing anything at all.And Shelton is US Champion but really they aren't using him right at all.Unless they push him toward the main event I say team him with Haas again.They make a better tag-team.They did put on great shows together.Very entertaining.I'd like to see a change in the tag-team division.And I think Charlie Haas and Shelton Benjamin reforming the World's Greatest Tag-Team again would be an interesting flow to things.

CttL3LmBaa	Soap. Water.  A bunch of soft cleaning rags.<br>  <br>  Here is where you can do harm with:  degreasers and orange solvents.  Fist off,  if it has orange solvent [D-LIMONENE; orange distillate; citrus terpene; cyclohexene, 1-methyl-4-(1-methylethenyl)] it is a more powerful degreaser than mineral spirits or paint thinner.  Degreasers have the ability to harm some finishes.  If you have stickers on your road wheels, they can attack the glue that holds them on.  Great if you are intentionally removing them, bad if you like the look.  Also, liberal application of them can attack the glue (if you have glue down type) of your rim tape by entering into your rim through the spoke hole gap around the nipple.  Orange solvent WILL over time attack rubber.  "Oops there goes my inner tube, and wow what is all this gunk on my rim tape?"<br>  <br>  When I clean my bike I do so with as little cleaning agent as possible.  You can get a lot of cleaning done with hot water and microfiber towels.  I can make a cassette sparkle with a dry microfiber towel and an old hacksaw blade to drape the towel over to clean between the gears - even on the spacing of a 10 speed cassette. <br>  <br>  If you have an investment in your bicycle do not clean it with anything you can't put on your own body is my rule of thumb.  My 3 year old Bianchi is cleaner today with thousands of miles on it than the day I brought it home from the bike shop new.|`|xxq5JAM6aa	Commercial degreaser should be just fine. Spray the whole thing down, wait a few minutes, wash off. Wipe down with a towel. <br>  <br>  Avoid any heavy spray at the wheel hubs and bottom bracket(where the cranks attach.) Don't want moisture inside the bearings.<br>  <br>  As for the chain, spray it with the degreaser, let it sit a few minutes while you brush it with a toothbrush. Wash off. Wipe down with a towel and let it dry well for a few hours. Apply lube length of chain, light motor oil will do, spin it a few times, and then wipe real well with a cloth to remove all excess oil. Run the chain thru the cloth while spinning it. Chain cleaning is best done with the bike turned upside down.|`|Cl6KbcAGaa	First and foremost NEVER use WD-40 on a chain or anyother part of a bicycle! Always use bicycle specific cleaners and degreasers and you will have no regrets ....ever! See here for a listing of some common use cleaners: <a href="http://www.performancebike.com/shop/sub_cat.cfm?subcategory_id=4205" rel="nofollow">http://www.performancebike.com/shop/sub_...</a> and here for some lubes/ grease: <a href="http://www.performancebike.com/shop/sub_cat.cfm?subcategory_id=4213" rel="nofollow">http://www.performancebike.com/shop/sub_...</a> You can use any of these purchased from just about anywhere they are sold and you will be fine! There are some Commercial products that you should avoid and degreasers too as they are too caustic and will harm painted surfaces and I would avoid them unless you are familiar with them or have tested them on something similar to the paint on your bike ....stay with what is safest and you will be fine!|`|7qRFw5fjaa	You really shouldn't need to use a degreaser.  Just a hose with a little water pressure will normally be enough to clean the dirt.  If you have hard to get clean areas, use some spray oil like Wd40 or silicone type oil and lubricant.  Stay away from the ones designed to penetrate rust as they are usually hard on the paint.  You can use car wax on your painted parts for extra shine and protection, and chrome or stainless steel cleaner for the shiny stuff.   I love my Bianchi!|`|DOVbF4Piaa	I just use the normal auto wash products in a bucket of water. Start at the top of the bike seat/handlebars and work your way down.  I usually rinse the bike down and then use a soapy rag to clean the dirt and rinse again.  Don't spray water directly on the bearings on the wheel and cranks.  Leave the chain and sprockets for last and use an old rag to clean.  You can use a tooth brush on the chain and be sure to wipe it dry, then apply a good chain oil.  Wipe the bike down with a clean rag.  Use a lite oil on the derailleur pivots and cables.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://bicycletutor.com/chain-lubrication/" rel="nofollow">http://bicycletutor.com/chain-lubricatio...</a><br>  <a href="http://bicycletutor.com/lubricants/" rel="nofollow">http://bicycletutor.com/lubricants/</a>|`|JSGLKnA4aa	simple green degreaser is good. orange peelz is another. don't use jet spray wash at a car wash it blasts water into bearings past seals. old tooth brushes work well you can get them into small places. green brilo pads for rims, tires. use less water more lather( foamy bubbles). sunlight or joy dish soap works great. use nail file or cross cut file to clean-up brake pads. wax frame/fork etc. relube all pivot points, chain and cables. everyonce in a while pull seat post & stem recoat with grease also. never use wd-40 on anything it contains water.|`|GYer3LV2aa	I always use dish soap a rag and for any chrome or shiny parts I use after washing aluminum foil and a bit of water to make things sparkle just fold the foil in a square dip it in the water and rub away till you are happy with the way it looks hope this helps a light coating of wax never hurts

If you do it at 10-12 mph it will take you up to 10 hours.  If that is ok with you (the amount of time) then go for it in the summer when you have the daylight.  Most riders of centuries average over 15 mph for the ride.  Remember, saying it will take 10 hours doesn't include stopping time.  On a 120 mile ride you will need at least 3 and maybe 4 stops.  If you stop for only 15 minutes per stop that adds an hour to your ride.  There are many, many long fully supported tours out there.  Find one near you and join in.

AA11621193	Bruins have the momentum right now being back at home and coming off a 6-1 win the other night to Florida then a 6-0 beat down(literally) of Anaheim. I also believe this is a statement game for the B's to prove that they rightfully deserve to be the #1 team in the East. <br>  <br>  I think it will be a hard fought game on both sides but if the B's can contain Green, Ovechkin and Semin than they should be ok. <br>  <br>  My guess is 3-2 Bruins.|`|lYnkvRASaa	J-O oT is bad for you, they both get points.<br>  <br>  Game is in Boston so I will give boston a slight edge.

The B's won in OT last time, but I think we'll edge them out.  It'll be a hell of a game seeing as it's the top 2 teams in the East.  Mike Green scored in the last 2 vs. the Bruins, and he scored last night vs. the Thrashers.  Kozlov's back from his groin injury, and he looked good with Ovechkin and Backstrom on the first line.  Hopefully Theo will be on his game since he got a day off from Neuvirth.<br>  <br>  Close game, fersher. Caps win it.|`|WPCATkoYaa	That is sucha good game and im not sure who will come out on top but im sure it will be close. im gunna guess that the bruins will win. They are really good this year!
D1beU6MPaa	Hi CF,<br>  Sam betting is actually an automated machine that lets you place a wager on a horse or race by simply touching the screen and following directions. Very much like when you run your ATM, or Debit card through a machine to pay for a purchase. The principal is the same, you are just placing your wager through the machine instead of going to the betting windows where you place your wager with a human person. Hope this explains it for you. Good luck|`|tzrLDbHWaa	Pretty much what Vicki said.

Kzhu4bkMaa	Yeah, generally the J.V. plays matches and tournaments against other J.V. teams, although if one of the lower players on varsity does not make the cut to go to a varsity tournament, they are often switched to the J.V. team temporarily for a tournament.  Also, some schools are too small, or don't have enough interest in tennis, so there is just a varsity team, even if the players are not varsity caliber.|`|WueuxAGuaa	Well usually there are challenge matches.  If you don't make varsity, then yes, JV still plays other schools.  However, you may have some games with varsity but you may be playing different schools.I played jv last year and had a blast, but this year I am on varsity.  One other difference is that instead of playing best of three you usually only play a set.  Hope this helps, have fun!!!|`|45af3ac17a36be4a268304e64be8c50caa	well at my high school the j.v. does not get to play other school's varsity players the coach sets up different games, some for varsity, and some for the j.v.|`|EW61kcudaa	yep you dont have finals and league winners and stuff but you do play against other schools|`|g3xlAZreaa	yea FOOLISH MORTAL|`|kuRJIgcaaa	Yes, you do play games against other schools. At my school, JV tennis players couldn't compete in sectionals so they had no chance of going to the state competition(which was the biggest competition and is televised). Also you can't get a varsity letter if your on JV. But everyone plays conference matches against other schools.
uwx7etCXaa	Whenever you play the same person for over a period of time, you do become predictable of their game.  You tend to know where their backhands are going, their flat shots, their overall game is predictable.  Even though serves are a bit hard to predict because of the variety of strength on each serve, with lots of playing time against one person, you can kind of predict it.  That is an awesome talent you have there, good luck with your games.|`|EWCQ4XDKaa	No you have a secret power. You should join the Justice League. We need people with powers like yours.|`|vxMJwivPaa	Mathematically? It probably is but it would not be the kind of math you could do mentally. It would involve how hard it's hit, how fast it goes, the angle it was hit at, blah, blah, blah.<br>  <br>  But like in your head common sense kind of thing? Of course.<br>  The more you play the more experience you get and the more you know about how it will be hit and how far and fast and hard it will go.<br>  Especially if it's for one of your team mates- you have seen her play a multitude of times before so you are more aware of her game.<br>  It's just something that you pick up the more you play the game.<br>  It usually means you are very focused which is very good. :)<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!<br>  :]|`|dmGbXwq9aa	yes but that happens in all things, like stepping over a high curb, you see the distance, anticipate the speed of your foot, and what kind of side it is[square, rounded, just a scrap], seeing the ball is just in reverse|`|976d29535eb417416a2e21ba6bfa5288aa	Nooooo, Not at all!<br>  Now that Roger Federer seems gone, you are the new genius to the game!<br>  p.s.

YwEFJWR7aa	I'm not a Met fan but i say Beltran your wasting Reyes by batting him 3rd<br>  1. SS Jose Reyes<br>  2. RF Ryan Church<br>  3. CF Carlos Beltran<br>  4. 3B David Wright<br>  5. 1B Carlos Delgado<br>  6. LF Fernando Tatis<br>  7. C Brian Schinder<br>  8. 2B Luis Castilo<br>  9. P Pitcher in game|`|wApoUG2baa	Wright or Beltran.  Reyes belongs at one and no lower than two.<br>  <br>  Just as another point: If you read that lineup card that jerry had yesterday, you had two lead-off hitters: Castillo, obviously, and Reyes after the pitcher's spot.  I mean, after you get through the lineup once, the lead-off guy really does become the guy after the pitcher, strategically, anyway.  Clearly, he's trying things in spring training that he's not gonna do in the season (like the pitcher batting second) so I think this Castillo leading off/Reyes batting 3rd thing is one of those trying in ST but not in the regular season things.<br>  <br>  For me personally, the mets lineup should look like this:<br>  1. Reyes<br>  2. Church/Murphy (whoever is playing better)<br>  3. Wright<br>  4. Delgado<br>  5. Beltran<br>  6. Church/Murphy (the other one)<br>  7. Scheinder/random catcher<br>  8. pitcher's slot<br>  9. Castillo<br>  <br>  Castillo becomes a second lead-off hitter, he can utilize the whole bunting for a base-hit thing, and when he's cold, he'll get less at-bats.  Even when he's going good, I like him there cause he can really turn over the line-up.|`|ZatADRPXaa	1 - Reyes<br>  2 - Beltran<br>  3 - Wright<br>  4 - Delgado<br>  5 - Church<br>  6 - Murphy<br>  7 - Schneider<br>  8 - Castillo|`|YRRXtVXeaa	carlos beltran!|`|NbNoQFZVaa	This is my ideal lineup for the Mets 1-8<br>  <br>  1. Jose Reyes<br>  2. Daniel Murphy<br>  3. David Wright<br>  4. Carlos Delgado<br>  5. Carlos Beltran<br>  6. Ryan Church<br>  7. Brian Schneider<br>  8. Luis Castillo<br>  <br>  Reyes may not be an ideal lead off man(doesn't walk enough or see enough pitches) but when he gets on base he changes the way a pitcher works.<br>  <br>  Murphy showed patience at the plate in his limited duty last year and should fit well in the two hole. Plus having a lefty batter is supposed to help runners steal bases because most catchers are righty throwers.<br>  <br>  Wright is the best hitter on the Mets and the best hitter on any team should bat third to maximize both plate appearances and rbi chances.<br>  <br>  Delgado is a classic cleanup hitter.<br>  <br>  Beltran can hit anywhere from 2-5 so he gets shuffled into the 5 spot here.<br>  <br>  Church is a capable hitter with some pop so he hits above the catcher and light hitting second baseman.<br>  <br>  Schneider isn't an offensive force but can hit it out occasionally. The only thing that keeps him from hitting 8th is......<br>  <br>  Castillo takes so many pitches and usually makes contact so he is ideal to hit ahead of a pitcher.|`|hv8ytdaoaa	Carlos Beltran|`|qurshau6aa	David Wright|`|nDzenpkwaa	David Wright should bat 3rd or 5th.  If he bats third Beltran should bat 4th and Delgado 5th.  If he bats 5th it should be Church batting 3rd Beltran, Wright then Delgado...<br>  <br>  And yes, there is no way, Jose Reyes doesn't bat lead off. I'd like to see him have 70 steals this year...|`|AA11621193	The batting order in my opinion should go..<br>  <br>  Castillo<br>  Reyes<br>  Wright<br>  Beltran<br>  Delgado<br>  Murphy<br>  <br>  then whoever

But you never know, you just have to wait and find out.<br>  <br>  <br>  But I think he is one of the best heels in the company, I love his storyline, he walks around and does what ever he wants without any permission.<br>  <br>  And him and Triple H fued is going really good since they were former teams in evolution, and after what Randy Orton did to the Mc.Mahon family, there has to be a lot of heat between them two.<br>  I cant wait for the match between them.|`|ynyfN7bBaa	Look, The Rock didn't turn his back on wrestling. He just took the higher paying job. The Rock will be a WWE Hall Of Famer one day, no doubt about it. Austin, they would have inducted him if he didn't all those special appearances and special referee matches. WWE even stated that they will induct The Rock but at a later date.<br>  <br>  And yes. Orton is becoming the biggest heel ever in WWE.|`|WT5jdIkxaa	The Rock will be eventually, Stone Cold was around long before the Rock was and they just happened to be around at the same time for a while as well.|`|GQWGLSexaa	i'm speechless|`|nF36n2pKaa	*..lol*<br>  Honestly Rock dose not need to be in hall of fame..he clearly has had much more high profiled jobs than any 'wrestler' outside the ring...He was in WWE for about 6-8 years. If you dont give all your blood and soul to the industry, you wont get recognised till your decrepid or dead.<br>  Besides all I said, the Hall Of Fame is still relativley new..so plently of time really.<br>  Or just to throw a spanner in the works...maybe the WWE couldnt have two major stars inducted in the same night??|`|H3ZBXHXyaa	As far as if The Rock will be in the hall of fame, I won't even dignify that question with an answer.<br>  <br>  As far as Orton, he is the best heel and best wrestler in the WWE today period. And if things keep going liek they are for him he could certainly be the greatest heel of all time.|`|lt8FZ6q1aa	Stone Cold was extremely good at his peak. His mic skills, the wrestling and his overall dedication and the love for WWE and wrestling is marginally more than the Rock. The Rock is good too no doubt and he will have his chance.|`|1RhedCiyaa	Its Stone Cold's Year and because its his year (thats why in texas) they dont want to put rock in because they dont want them to share the spotlight Rock will be in next year|`|JeACGbWNaa	Because 'Thats the bottom line, coz Stone Cold said so.'|`|Xkm4PstOaa	Stone Cold didn't chose to leave the WWE.  Unfortunately his nagging injuries  forced him to retire.  I'm sure if he was perfectly healthy he would still be in the ring stomping mudholes in eveyones @$$E$!!<br>  <br>  The Rock left by choice.  Hence, not being inducted into the Hall of Fame.  At least for now...  Vince McMahon tends to hold grudges; so I won't be surprised if "The RocK"...oops...I mean Duane Johnson never gets inducted.<br>  <br>  WQ:  Randy Orton is just good at what he doest, period!  I won't be surprised if he establishes himself as the best heel ever.|`|iWcTmuhAaa	The Rock left WWE for Hollywood.<br>  <br>  Stone Cold to joined the Hollywood but he also keep appearing in WWE and keep giving his best possible contribution towards the business.

However in the women trophy got her name represent the trophy, venus rosewater dish... that is cool!!!!|`|uWYlumvsaa	I'm agreeing, Wimbledon's Singles Winner trophies are the best of all the grand slam trophies. Unlike the others, this trophy's in gold, and it has this really prestigious look to it, which is fit for some of the greatest champions to have ever held it. Wimbledon will always be the GS that stands out more than any other.

0da6ab3c6b462dc6d34ee0177bdc0459aa	Seriously i know exactly what you mean. Basically its all about how you eat, and how you train.  Before sparring you should not train hard on the mitts.  Keep warming up with jump ropes and shadow boxing.  Then when your muscle is warm then spar.  After sparring you can finish your intensive training.    <br>  <br>  When your in a sparring match adrenaline also boots you up, in that case either you get stronger or weaker(loosing focus)  this is all about comfortably and traning in the ring.  How many sparring matches have you done already?|`|nCMUA50Raa	its normal but there is ways to fix it. eating foods that are alive and give you energy will help. diet  is probably the main thing. but you did not provide enough information to determine a way to fix this.|`|tM0VnOVRaa	oh man, this could be serious, mildly serious or not serious at all.

ejgXFY5naa	He should have entered the draft. He is embrassing the college athletes. Show the NFL what you have to offer. But he will probaly be a better player now.|`|jwm0kQvNaa	Why?  He has the right to do as he pleases... maybe he just likes the college atmosphere.  The same could be said for Bradford, McCoy, Leinart and Quinn, among others.  <br>  <br>  Some players were lied to by their agents about the 2010 draft being the start of a rookie cap year, but that was unfounded- it still needs to be brought to the NFLPA and voted in as part of the CBA for that to happen, so some kids scrambled to get in, to "get theirs" while they could.  The ones with REAL game, it doesn't matter.<br>  <br>  I personally don't think he needs to "work on" anything.  If someone is going to draft Michael Vick as high as they did, I'm sure he'll be OK- and he has far less character issues.   I also applaud him for getting his degree first, just like that kid from Florida St. going to Oxford, bypassing the NFL for a year.|`|c4b596d15eac948f611f72b6a99f85a0aa	Not a fan of Tebow but the answer would still be NO.<br>  <br>  He needs to develop as a passer if he wants a hope of playing in the NFL.|`|BFCdEAOBaa	Absolutely YES, Tebow has been red hot every year in what most experts call the roughest toughest conference in college football....the SEC. Can you image what will happen to his stock and the millions he can kiss goodbye if he has a season ending injury this year? I'm all for getting that degree and the glamour of being the big man on campus, but when tens of millions of dollars are on the table it should have been a no brainer. Pro teams are masters at down playing and under paying, even heisman winners if they sustain an injury before the draft. But I'll admit, he sure is fun to watch on Saturdays!|`|acaAycEXaa	No. He won't make it in the NFL. He is a hero in Florida (and in the ESPN studio).<br>  <br>  He should get out of Gawdawful Gainsville before one of their famous serial killers gets him!|`|HX6eNw6daa	Im not a Tebow Fan But I am a U of Florida Fan.

Chelsea, Liverpool and United all have at least one world class forward player.<br>  <br>  Edit @ Marky: I really don't think those players you mentioned are world class. Maybe we have different definitions on what world class means, but I think of it as a tag given only to the absolute elite of football players. A group of perhaps 15 - 20 individuals. The likes of Zidane, Ronaldinho, Kaka, Vieira, Gerrard, Messi, Henry, Ronaldo, Torres, Buffon and Casillas in their prime.

They have good people Van Persie and Adebayor, but people like Bendtner and Eduardo aren't as good as other Big Four strikers. I like the attacking midfielders though (Arshavin, Nasri), and you forgot to mention Carlos Vela.<br>  Personally, I think Man U have the best attacking force. They have three good strikers-Rooney, Tevez, Berbatov- Ronaldo, who plays like a striker and more, youngsters like Nani and Welbeck, as well as veteran Paul Scholes. Coming in at a close second would be Chelsea, who have two good strikers- Anelka and Drogba- some good attacking midfielders- Lampard and Ballack- and some wingers- Quaresma and Joe Cole (injured).|`|IWM1khX7aa	Arsenal (9):<br>  ST Adebayor<br>  ST Bendtner <br>  ST Vela<br>  ST Eduardo<br>  CF Van Persie<br>  CF Arshavin<br>  RW Walcott<br>  CAM Nasri<br>  CAM Rosicky <br>  <br>  Chelsea (10):<br>  ST Drogba<br>  ST Anelka<br>  ST Kalou<br>  ST Di Santo<br>  RW Quaresma<br>  RW Cole<br>  CAM Lampard<br>  CAM Ballack<br>  CAM Deco<br>  LM Malouda<br>  <br>  Liverpool (6):<br>  ST Fernando Torres<br>  ST Kuyt<br>  ST N'gog<br>  LW Babel<br>  CAM Benayoun<br>  LM Riera<br>  <br>  Manchester United (11):<br>  ST Berbatov<br>  ST Welbeck<br>  CF Rooney<br>  CF Tevez<br>  LW Nani<br>  RW Ronaldo<br>  CAM Scholes<br>  CAM Anderson<br>  LM Giggs<br>  LM Tosic<br>  RM Park<br>  <br>  1.

lrJN4M49aa	You use that 13th pick on the best available o lineman (hopefully Eugene Monroe from VA). If we get any of the top three O linemen in the draft they are all projected to be impact starters. Throw in Stephon Heyer and last years third round pick Chad Rhinehart, and rumors are that redskins have money for one more big free agent pickup and former skin O lineman Derrick Dockery (released by the bills) is interested in coming back. This would be the infusion of youth on the O line that we need. JC deserves one more chance if you look at his numbers he isn't an awful quarterback throw in the fact that he had some many different systems has afforded him another year to see what he can do.  Jim Zorn is known for his quarterback molding so give him a chance plus none of the quarterback in this draft are worth a thirteen pick. If JC doesn't pan out I say we try to make a run at Colt McCoy next year|`|yuGhmhGuaa	They will say after the draft"We spent all this money on has beens and the Giants are still better than us."|`|0fc4be2c7fe0b3251308b8c4479f2d3baa	Offensive Line.  Get a starter in free agency, draft a couple O linemen in an O linemen heavy draft.  <br>  <br>  Need consistency in coaching.  You can't look like world beaters and have NFL MVP contenders for the first half of the season and then get beat down in the second half.  Inconsistent coaching, inconsistent playcalling, and inconsistent philosophy.  Other than that, the Skins will be fun to root for or root against, on their way to an 8-8 season.|`|7265d27fc13e89f482c384391b4a5007aa	I see them trading down to get a couple second rounders. They won't have much money to sign the number 13 pick though most of that money for hall and haynesworth is probably bonus money and money that doesn't count towards the cap. I see them drafting a OL most likely a T and they still need to get younger at DE.|`|fKco44yxaa	Draft? They had 8 million cap space before spending 150 million on two players....<br>  <br>  Thats more needed!!<br>  <br>  And they can do anything they want in the draft now...they are sorted :P<br>  But a WR is a must in a draft like this...and some more Oline players...+ a few more players to sure up the O.<br>  <br>  A back up runningback incase Portis goes down again could also be useful|`|pxPn3ISnaa	Anything that helps their offense. Maybe a good O-lineman or something. We have enough wide recievers in my opinion.|`|kXPmr9oDaa	o-line or a new qb. cambell sucks|`|oEOIk3nfaa	Well for the most part, I agree with what's been said here before me. Although I'll throw out that we need a future QB. I'm not sure I can stay on the Campbell bandwagon for much longer. Well anyway, we have the 13th pick.... Depending on what we have in-front of us, we may want to trade down. We have to think value, and the best value I can see that fits our needs is Michael Crabtree and Andre Smith. They're both gambles, yes, but they're both the best at their positions--and they're positions we need. I'm not so sure how high I am on Devin Thomas/Malcom Kelly. They haven't given me an ounce of reasoning that they can help in the slightest this upcoming season.<br>  <br>  For QB. Take Vick.<br>  <br>  Edit: Expect a flurry of releases.<br>  <br>  2nd Edit: What'd I say? There goes Springs.

nRBC4E5saa	Many Chinese martial arts have a form of grappling, be it locks or felling techniques.  Shuai Jiao is a Chinese form of wrestling, although it does have some jacket-based techniques.  Chin Na, which is more a skill set than a martial art, is the joint locking of CMA.  I believe Eagle Claw and Mantis are the most well-known, but just about every CMA system has some sort of joint locking techniques.  I've noticed, and have been told by others, that Wing Chun and bareknuckle pugilism resemble one another in many ways.  Just thought I'd throw that out there since we're on the subject of it.<br>  <br>  Korean Hapkido and the various forms of Japanese Jujitsu will also have locks and throws.  Some are clothing-dependent, some are not.<br>  <br>  Backhold wrestling is a form of British wrestling that utilizes throws from the over-under clinch, but I'm not sure I'd recommend persuing it because a) instruction on it is very difficult to find and b) I can't imagine backhold has anything that Greco-Roman does not.<br>  <br>  Um... there's always Sumo wrestling...<br>  <br>  With the popularity of Filipino martial arts has come information on Dumog, or Filipino wrestling.  It can easily be used in conjunction with striking.  Paul Vunak has a DVD on the subject.<br>  <br>  There's also "European Jujitsu" for lack of a better term.  Complete forms of self-defense, including throws, arm breaks, and strikes were taught from the middle ages through modern times.<br>  <br>  Really, if you're only looking for upper-body throws and holds, what you have listed will be your bread-and-butter material.  Hip throws, "flying mares" (shoulder throws), front chanceries (headlocks), maybe the odd shoulder lock or two.  I would suggest maybe Irimi-Nage from Aikido to round things out, but adding in lower-body work would expand your arsenal in a very positive way.|`|Y26eOD9Caa	I've been doing some research into old school boxing myself lately.  It seems that a natural compliment to it would be old fashioned catch wrestling, known today as Pro wrestling.  The matches on tv are rigged, but those holds and throws are real, and they work.  And let's not forget, in the old days, those fights were real.  I'd suggest ordering some manuals on catch wrestling to pair with your bareknuckle boxing. Once you are proficient, you would be hard to beat in a straight up fight.|`|MaFw69ePaa	the chinese style of shuai chiao/shuai jiao is the ancestor of japanese jiu-jitsu and undoubtedly one of the most versatile styles of grappling there is. the only good place for online techniques i kno of is <a href="http://flashmavi.com" rel="nofollow">http://flashmavi.com</a> and don't forget about the ole trusty google|`|sJrnFCrgaa	Most Jujitsu schools train both with and without Gi's.

ZKikquiOaa	You need to start competing, only then you would know how good you are.  Start attending local tournaments, then regional, then national.  You need to be in the top 3 at the national level before you can go to the Olympics.|`|S0KbFkCPaa	Make sure that your overhand shots, underhand shots, and drop winner shots have perfect technique. Use muscle building exercises for better lob shots, and also play some eye-exercise games to improve RT--reaction time, of course.|`|ZbpaRKkUaa	For girls fitness is the key because they play long rallies and hand strength and shoulder strength is necessary. Watch a lot of it on the T.V you could pick up pointers from there. I did. Try the jump smash. Girls don't do that. Also go for down the line shots.|`|jHUksr5Daa	all i have to say to you is that keep up the good work... show off your skills to your coaches and wish they recommend you to some more Professional coaches and take you to the olympics
F3VjJAdiaa	It is an interesting way of going about it. WWE would never do this, they are too scared for some reason. Take Boogeyman for example, they will never talk about him again or act like he ever existed.|`|dgXKvb7haa	It is really stupid that they do that.That is exactly why TNA is a third-rate company with second-rate wrestlers and fifth-rate storylines!|`|aCyqB2bAaa	Thats kind of cool, i guess. LOL I mean i dont even like TNA, Vince Mcmahon should just buy TNA because more people watch WWE or I wish it was WWF.
j80YlFY1aa	I haven't understood why so many are suddenly counting the Rockets out once T-Mac went down, especially considering that so many believe he i overrated.  They still have a lot of good players and two legit stars in Yao and Artest.  Artest no longer has to play second fiddle to McGrady nor does Battier have to play second fiddle to Artest, and that helps the team. I think they can make a run in the playoffs and considering T-Mac's luck, the year the Rockets finally break through would be the year he is out. <br>  <br>  With all that said this also could very well be the Rockets annual "getting our hopes up only to screw it up" run.|`|xQgciq09aa	If not, then neither are the Cavs or the Mavs.<br>  <br>  Artest is healthy, and more than able to fill the role T-Mac used to have on this team, plus he is a better one on one defender.|`|jn7hxEA7aa	Absolutely...they look a way better team with out him.  With him in the game they dont move the ball around its get it to TMac and thats it.  When he is out of the game they create so much more movement.  Player and ball movement and they get in a nice rhythm.  Waaayyyyyy  better with out him.|`|75GcSkF6aa	PEOPLE............STOP MENTIONING TMAC WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE ROCKETS<br>  <br>  TMAC ROCKET CAREER = OVER<br>  <br>  <br>  In Yao we trust<br>  <br>  They can only get better from here. The young PG's still have room to improve. Everybody on the team hustles and plays hard every possession. Not more you can ask.<br>  <br>  I still think they are a second tier team, which is better than what they started the season at.|`|oMYGtqubaa	They looked GOOD last night....   and honestly...  T-MAC is the A-ROD of basketball.    <br>  <br>  One of those guys who can light up "box score"... but when it comes down to making big plays in the clutch and taking his team to the nextl level...   I don't know if he's got it in him.|`|BTZ4vFKJaa	no way. cavs just didnt play good last night. t mac is only shooting 39 percent. either the celtics or lakers r going to win it.|`|WLXFAeSnaa	They seem to be playing better without him|`|2VVU7gNfaa	Sure looked like it last night.  They played rock solid D and didn't seem to miss any of McGrady's game otherwise.  <br>  <br>  T-Mac wasn't right all year, so it's not like they lost the same T-Mac as they would have 2-3 years ago anyway.  It may turn out that T-Mac playing hurt was more of a liability to the Rockets than an asset and him bailing to have knee surgery may actually have improved the Rockets as a team.|`|3eDsHCTVaa	first of all, everyone in that organization is getting paid big $$$, regardless of whether they are for real or not. it does not matter what we think of them as long as they are secure in knowing they will be getting paychecks, regardless of win/loss record.<br>  second, T-mac is another Anfernee Hardaway never reaching his true potential.<br>  third, we can presume to cheer for and hope it is influencial as a mass population towards a winning season and post.......so yea, i think they're for real!!|`|gfe5o4IZaa	im not a rockets fan but there really good<br>  <br>  i think they have a chance winning Champs this year <br>  <br>  Because When Yao gets double team he passes it outside and to his teammates and they get the shot in..|`|kmebjETwaa	They are real lucky. Cleveland didn't get any calls and Yao's 28 was a bunch of bull$h!tt.|`|F05yVezraa	No they cant be, because they dont got T-MAC because he is out for da season|`|xRPjgGs1aa	Yeah

c4f45cb3208d42f175407510ca9d9c07aa	There has been some buzz that Taker is wanting to retire, but last I heard the earliest would be next year.   The reason for this match in particular is mainly since it is the 25th anniversary of wrestlemania.   Plus a "Mr Wrestlemania" vs. "The Streak" match would be great for fans|`|SGEwvrBFaa	They both are perhaps the Greatest legends of Wrestlemania of all time. Mr.Wrestlemania vs the streak...We;ve been waiting for this match for ages.

'Taker is undefeated (16-0) at Wrestlemania and HBK is Mr. Wrestlemania.  This match is going to be the best match of the night hands down.|`|dbc3503ab379d3f8b3803c2488ab5e36aa	Cause its the 25th WM and wanna continue to bore us with guys like HBK and The Undertaker. I rather see two young mid carders end the careers of two veterans that should have been retired<br>  <br>  I would have done this<br>  <br>  HBK vs Morrison and Undertaker vs Kozlov|`|Wf8PbTraaa	the hype is that its (IMO) the two greatest wwe superstars of all time finally facing each other again after 11+ years.<br>  <br>  the last time these guys wrestled one on one was in january 1998 just a few months after the first hell in a cell.<br>  <br>  plus its WM. i think everybody knows Taker is gonna win its just a matter of seeing how great the match is gonna be. and lets face it this is the main event. the title matches are gonna suck (IMO)<br>  <br>  hhh vs randy orton.....haven't we seen that about 10 times in the past year and a half?<br>  and the SD main event will probably be edge/big show/cena.....i have nothing to say about that except that may be the worst title match @ WM in recent memory. edge is gonna have to earn his paycheck cuz hes gonna have to carry that match.|`|cIHhxtRJaa	yeah there have been rumors that Taker will lose at this years wrestlemania where they're in texas and i read before that HBK rarely or has never lost in texas. But i know that the taker losing thing isnt true because they want him to lose against a young wrestler such as Ted Dibiase instead of an already established guy.|`|LSXdwRDUaa	Because it was humored HBK might retire  not Undertaker.<br>  But undertaker will win.and be undefeated at 20-0 then will retire.|`|ZpH2PFF9aa	i like seeing 2 babyface guys go at at

iM9V27dDaa	I LOVE lacrosse!! You need to think about your breathing and make sure that you are breathing deeply and evenly throughout the whole run. The dizzyness may not have been related to the running at all and could just be that you were breathing too much and too shallow. <br>  You should do some training on your own to improve your lung capacity as this will really help you with lacrosse.<br>  I hope this helps and have fun with lacrosse!|`|WST15Sm5aa	Try to breathe faster while running, but not too fast that you feel more dizzy. You may wanna practice running sprints on your own also, so that if you make the team you don't look like a non athletic person.|`|dP7FqCW1aa	Remember that one important thing to do is to drink plenty of water throuhout the day, it's not enough if you just fill up before practice begins because one: it won't help and two, it'll jut make you go to the bathroom.  Try to eat healthy too maybe try to eat some sort of snack an hour before practice so you'll have energy to work out and like how other have said, try to breath deeply.|`|AA11414296	Running, from my experience, is all mental willpower. Whatever you're thinking, do the opposite. If you thinking you can't do it, you gotta prove yourself wrong.|`|xEA5YRlzaa	you need to remember to breathe more deeply and slowly.<br>  you may not have realized it but you were probably hyperventilating.  You should try taking deep, full, slow breaths while you run, and try to concentrate on it.

That HOF'er wud say that he is ashamed that he is father of (either cody or orton whoever ). Then after getting beat up from Jericho Legacy come and laugh on HOF'er's condition and tell people that they what they are doin and thay dont need anyone to tell them its wrong wherther it is their father.<br>  <br>  This wud add more heat and will creat more hype for the match of Jericho and HOF'er and Orton/ HHH.|`|Wf8PbTraaa	one of two things would happen.<br>  <br>  1---> legacy would do nothing...just act like it never happend. or<br>  <br>  2---> legacy would give jericho props for doing it.<br>  <br>  legacy and jericho are all heels so the odds of seeing them wrestle against each other is not likely.|`|yl86ZQ6Daa	I would like to see that cos Orton and Rhodes would go nuts at him...

abnqs0jQaa	A couple of the other responses are making broad assumptions that don't necessarily apply to what you are asking.<br>  <br>  As a rule of thumb, the running will make you have lean legs. The football reference is ridiculous, that has nothing to do with what you are doing. Going 5 mph for 80 minutes per day is a great start, but if you really want your legs to be more slender and lean, you'll have to do more than a jog. The jog helps the cardio aspect, and everyone could use that. To really burn fat and build lean muscles, your workouts should become more strenuous.<br>  <br>  Perhaps instead of 2 40 minute jogs at a slower pace, you try one 45-50 run at a faster pace. Once you start burning some fat with a more intense workout is when you will start to see more slender legs. By more intense, I don't mean a sprint workout, but you should increase your speed, and then add in some other workouts with time, where you do intervals as a faster pace while still running between them. There is tons of advice on this topic in resolved questions, and I'm sure you can develop the lanky, lean muscles that we distance runners have.<br>  <br>  Also, please eat more than 800-1000 calories per day. The reccommended daily allowance is 2000-2500 and if you are partaking in strenuoous exercise it should increase some. This is not to say over-indulge yourself, but an increase in healthy foods would be acceptible.<br>  <br>  Best of luck!|`|RTHWQvkzaa	I am no expert, but I don't think you can be guarateed to become skinnier. Everyone's body works differently. You will gain some weight if you are gaining muscle.<br>  <br>  It also depends on how much you run. Sounds like you are doing well!<br>  <br>  I think it will take a while before you notice any obvious changes. (I may be wrong)  But I think you will start to feel better- and you will be able to get things done faster. Your body won't get tired for longer periods of time than before.|`|WST15Sm5aa	Uhhhhh, if you are running that often, you REALLLLLYYYY need to be eating more calories than that. I need around 2000 and I am an 8th grade runner. Your legs will not get skinnier, they will gain muscle, but the fat in your legs will go away. Some people just have naturally skinny legs, and some don't, cuz of genetics.|`|7wFSTmwfaa	ummmm no. runners have powerful, muscular legs. not necersarily skinny.<br>  <br>  and football makes u lose weight all over. take it from me. my dad lost 11 lbs. the first day of high school training.<br>  <br>  i seriuosly doubt ur legs will b noticiably skinner. ive been running a mile everyday for months and they look the same.....but muscular, not smaller.|`|umt2xVxKaa	you arent qoinq to qet skinnier yu may even qain weight because yu are qaining muscle.|`|PcyTdRA7aa	i'm a cross country runner, but if you run you build muscle, not make yourself skinnier.  you will get a flatter stomach, but that's about it|`|8GYfMzc0aa	Well i dont have a routine.<br>  But your legs would get a bit skinnier. <br>  but more muscely..|`|iM9V27dDaa	800 to 1000 calories?? A normal person should be eating at least double that but with all the running you do you should be eating 2500 at least. You may not get skinny legs you will just build up more muscle.

HkMhWvtgaa	I'm a big believer in trusting your negative instincts.  This trip has very little of an "up" side.  5 days can feel like an eternity with people you don't like and who don't like you, and the situation could even get dangerous.<br>  <br>  There are plenty of opportunities to go camping.  Why not get together a group of your own friends and spend a weekend at a state park?  If your group enjoys that short, relatively easy trip, then you can try something more demanding later.|`|WpqwaqcQaa	camping is not fair weather, it's people at their most raw.<br>  <br>  I'd not go <br>  <br>  especially since your so far from home, if you hated it, you'd have a hard time just leaving.|`|3W18HDxxaa	stay home|`|p2CJ8zNEaa	I would not go on this trip. 2000 miles is a long way to go for a trip your not sure about.|`|4GeKyXnmaa	Follow your instincts, I personally wouldn't go.

Also, you listed several reasons why not to go and only one "potential" reason to go. This trip does not sound as though you will be surrounded by people you will have fun with. I say make a list of the pros and cons to this trip and find out for yourself which out weights the other. Good luck with your decision. ;)|`|uISTGAoLaa	I agree with some of the others.  If your gut tells you not to go, you should probably listen.  2000 miles and 5 days is a long way and a long time to be with people you don't like or can't get along with.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, like another person said, bring along another good friend or two of your own as a back up if you decide to go, that way you won't feel alone and miserable.<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.familytentdeals.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.familytentdeals.com</a>|`|syLRV6m9aa	I agree with most of the others especially the 2 before me that stated the "trap" part.

Someone you know you'll get along with if the group doesn't warm up to you, but someone also good natured enough that he'll at least try to get along with this girl and her friends. Then at least you have someone to go hiking or fishing or whatever with instead of going alone or sitting off to the side while everyone else is having a good time together. <br>  <br>  It could be a blast, and it would be a shame to miss out on it. On the other hand, 2000 miles from home and feeling like an outsider would just suck.<br>  <br>  What is the longest time you've spent with this girl? At least a couple days in a row? Did you get along okay then? If not, or if you haven't even spent two days in a row with this girl, you should maybe reconsider this trip and perhaps plan something shorter much closer to your area for some point after her trip is over. <br>  <br>  I hope this helps!

y8b86tTEaa	Sorry, there is no way to sharpen the knife without a sharpener.<br>  It'd help if you stated your budget and better yet what knife/steel your sog is. Most of the sogs are AUS-8 steel, around 58HRC. Which isn't that hard to sharpen. On the other hand I've had SOGS made out of BG-42 steel, at 62HRC. Considerably harder to sharpen.<br>  <br>  Sandpaper on the mouspad works very well. You'll get very nice convex edge and it's very beginner friendly. Coarse sandpaper lasts 1-2 knives depending on the edge state and finer sandpaper will last you 4-5 blades per sheet. Plus coarser sandpaper acts like fine one as it gets worn. <br>  That's the cheapest sharpening method and most effective too.<br>  <br>  <br>  Stropping on a leather is not sharpening. It's just realigning the rolled/deformed edge, and removing burr if it exists, but stropping does increase useful edge lifespan at least twice when done regularly, so I'd highly recommend doing it before using a knife, every time. Just a few passes on the leather and you'll be amazed how much longer the edge will stay sharp. It actually feels sharper after stropping, even though the leather is not sharpening anything, too soft to remove any metal.<br>  For more on stropping - <a href="http://zknives.com/knives/sharpening/lstrops.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://zknives.com/knives/sharpening/lst...</a><br>  <br>  Contrary to the popular belief, butcher steels(grooved steel rod) ARE NOT sharpeners. Their primary goal is do realign deformed and rolled edge, exactly as with stropping, just steel is faster but less effective. However, stay away from the grooved steel. It does more damage to the fine edge than good. if you want to steel, get the smooth steel. <br>  <br>  Using Chromium Oxide powder (CrO) loaded leather will make your edge considerably sharper, if you do it right. But, in the end when the knife is dull, you need at least one simple Arkansas stone, coarse/fine or something like that. <br>  <br>  Fine side will be for regular sharpening, how often really depends on your needs, and coarse is for very rare occasions when the edge is severely worn or damaged.<br>  <br>  Whetstones cut significantly faster compared to dry stuff. And don't use oil, many sharpeners recommend using oil on them, but you will end up with shaved metal particles floating in oil scratching your edge/blade. <br>  Water works much better.<br>  <br>  Either way stay away from electric sharpeners, 99% chance that you will damage the edge and heat treatment using those.<br>  <br>  Belt grinders work fast, I have a cheapo 40$, but requires considerable skill, it's real easy to burn the edge on it.<br>  <br>  P.S. 99.99% of factory made knives come with the edges that are a) very thick, b) too coarse. That includes kitchen, combat, field, utility, folding and whatever else types.|`|AA12034449	a good old fashioned whetstone cant be much more than $10 or $20 bucks down at Ace Hardware these days.<br>  <br>  If you have a serrated edge they make some ceramic rods that will hone thos up.|`|vea6mqPZaa	A leather strap or belt.<br>  <br>  Go to ace hardware, a lot of them will have a sharpener you can use in the store to sharpen it.|`|TPZwmQK9aa	Absoutely not!

U5l7LZ3kaa	I guarantee if you are running steadily and you ran the 5:45 before you started training, you will get the 5:30 mile.

Our new head coach john harbough, was a DC before he came here, plus ray leis calls some of the plays (ray has officialy re-signed with the ravens for a long term deal), second, Bart Scott IS a good player, but he was a little overrated jUst because of the fact that the ravens defense is so good, but we do have a good backup(jameel mcclain) and we are planning to get a first round lb. Last jim leonhard, he was one of my favorite ravenslast year, but when you. Think about it, he was only playing cause our starter(landry) was injured. Landry is a better saftey but I admit leonhard is good and won the titans game for us. Jason brown is a center, he didn't do that much but he will be a loss, *** for chris mcalister, AMAZING player in my opinion, but we played the final 13 games of the season without him, and he has been injured for more than half of the past two Seasons. The ravens are a good team, I'm expecting a 10-6 season, you can also expect to see us draft a good wr, and flacco to make great of progress. They also have an easy schedule next year.<br>  <br>  <br>  The ravens will definetly be contenders next year!!<br>  <br>  Go ravens!!!!!!!!|`|MxHRjPFHaa	they should be fine alot of washed up bodies...as a bronco fan I hated to see foxworth leave the team...you'll be fine..you still have the draft|`|nlIpKw8Paa	decent 9-7 they lost alot.|`|gYRfWcleaa	I don't know but I think they should have tried much harder to get Bart Scott and Jim Leonhard. I can't believe we lost them! I think it has to do with Ray Lewis jerking the Ravens around for money because they are waiting around to see what Rays going to do before they spend any money. <br>  I usually have a lot of confidence in Ozzie but this year I don't know what he is doing!
iNcdGwmiaa	That guy, Owned^^^^^^^^^^ up there^^^^^^^ is stupid<br>  <br>  Read the question! Owned!<br>  <br>  Anyway, yes, I agree. It will be Lakers and Spurs in the WCF.<br>  <br>  Nice summaries, btw|`|u8GHTJEEaa	I agree wholeheartedly. The Lakers and Spurs have combined to represent the Western Conference in every NBA Finals since 1999, except for 2006. This year won't be any different and since it's and odd year, it's the Spurs turn. Silver and Black in 6 or 7.|`|vzH7f7V5aa	Agree. Spurs sweep Lakers 4-0.|`|WLXFAeSnaa	Agree. That would be so awesome to see!|`|C4mzZwiWaa	cavs vs lakers<br>  <br>  lakers in 7|`|2Xx0Cm2Caa	AGREE!|`|xRPjgGs1aa	Agree|`|8c150d798507c1b0ae472762150207b6aa	What up Laker Man,<br>  <br>  It is true in this past decade that the Lakers and Spurs have pretty much dominated the Western Conference.<br>  <br>  i think the Lakers have been the class of the West all year followed by really a group of teams which have been up and down.  The Spurs have probably been the 2nd most consistent team - especially with the number of injuries that they have had to battle-- but actually the team that scares me the most in the West right now is the Utah Jazz- they play the Lakers tough and as the Cetlics exposed a little bit last year- are one of the more physical teams in the West.  They took us to 6 games last year- with Carlos Boozer having a bad series- and Okur seems to have stepped up his game.  The Jazz can give any team a tough time- and i think they can beat the Spurs in a 7 game series.<br>  <br>  Anthony E.M. - i don't see any way that the Mavs can beat the Lakers in a 7 game series.  Just like Phoenix and Denver (they can have great games but over a 7 game series- defense wins- and so just don't see that man but respect your right to that opinion). <br>  <br>  Nickster|`|v77SnunOaa	History dont lie|`|JD5NQxeNaa	Disagree, Spurs will be there and most likely win the NBA Finals. But, the Lakers will get shocked in the 1st Round against the Dallas Mavericks in 5. Dirk will go postal.<br>  <br>  It will be Spurs and Jazz in a rematch of the 1998 and 2007 NBA WCF Finals. Rockets, Nuggets, Hornets, and even the Suns and Mavericks have an outside shot at the Spurs cause it is the playoffs and anything can happen. But, I have an inkling of a Mavs over Lakers upset and have a certain feeling Spurs will make WCF.|`|KdhNCnEjaa	I think there are no guarantees on either team making it, with Utah, Denver, and Portland all being legitimate threats, then Phoenix and Dallas have the depth to make a run.

Beth is amazingly strong but not to much to do her main moves on a ultra heavyweight like Awesome Kong.|`|1z7M3Tntaa	"Kong is just fat" sigh, has anyone wacthed her in the ring as amazing Kong? Anyone? Probably only a few ok.

uS8hK7Zhaa	I honestly can't answer that. I just answer questions and move on. I don't take things on here too seriously<br>  <br>  BQ: A lot of the ones I encounter are pretty rude. They hardly ever answer the questions with intelligent answers. I guess they stopped trying so hard since they already are TC<br>  <br>  WQ: Maryse!!!|`|0Dm3WEMcaa	You're complaining about the same thing you did in your BQ... but i do agree i don't care what people think of me, i ask and answer about wrestling unless i want to insult a troll which does sometimes happen.<br>  <br>  BQ: yes because a TC badge is pretty meaningless, you can get one in a week or two if you really want. It's not a statement about the users Quality just the quantity of there best answers and points gained. <br>  <br>  WQ: Maryse, i think Melina is a sloppy worker.|`|4tvI9WYjaa	is just kids <br>  bq yes and no i know some are rude but others deserve it they know lot off wrestling.<br>  <br>  melina she has the look but maryse has the wrestling skills|`|zmDopvd4aa	BQ: There have been a few but every other TC is really nice and friendly to me and I be friendly back<br>  <br>  WQ: Melina she is flexible which makes her moves and matches occasionally interesting and she is a great womens wrestler as she is womens champion and Maryse is Divas Champion which is somewhat respectable but it has almost no prestige yet and the womens title has been around many years and is the ultimate price in womens wrestling in my opinion so whoever holds it is the best diva in that moment in time that the WWE has to offer to us the fans|`|oAjbBLDpaa	They want to compete to become the best in the section, they fail to realize that this website is not for that, it is for learning and teaching of knowledge that one has too receive and share.<br>  <br>  BQ: No, it's not just you. Idiots take the TC badge to their head and start to think they are better than everyone else because they got it, it doesn't mean anything since I got mine when I had only been here for two weeks.<br>  <br>  WQ: Melina. Maryse has improved plenty but I still think Melina has a bit of an edge over her.|`|4c479c9c27bebd404d7ba657763fe54faa	I just wanna give my best in helping people and give my best in answering Q's. I really don't care if people notice me or not, you know, I answer and answer but try not to offend in any way<br>  <br>  BQ - A TC badge is a target for trolls and haters, it's become a joke that badge<br>  <br>  WQ - Melina. Better wrestler, IMO|`|smcDn76jaa	Just ignore those people. <br>  <br>  BQ: I don't know what you're talking about I think some of the other TCs are pretty nice. I can't speak for them however, but I'll have you know I answer to the best of my abilities, and I'm not rude. Of course I just got this badge and I might change(JK).<br>  <br>  WQ- Melina. She has more talent, but Maryse is rapidly improving.

XeGvBJLjaa	They are light weight, come with hand sanitizer and a small amount of toilet paper, and secure. I usually pack a few of these for Shasta instead of the USFS-issued packout bags. After use I do still prefer to put them in a trash compactor bag for the hike out though.
JXJQTgULaa	Yes there are cheer leading squads for older women. they are a little bit more rare, but they are out there (there is one at my gym). You should check with local cheer leading places and ask around to see if there is a place near where you live. It will be fun. I do cheer leading right now, and it is a blast.<br>  <br>  Good luck, I hope you find a fun hobby to do.<br>  Ps. if you can't find one, I would recommend tennis because that is a GREAT sport, that you can play at any age.

hQj1s1Maaa	I'm a huge Lakers fan & Kobe fan as well, but he'll do good to get 3 mvp's (2more).  The league has been craving Lebron to be mvp for 4 years now & he's finally good enough to deserve one, so he will get a couple that could just as easily go to Kobe.  I think 2 more titles, for 5 total.|`|xRPjgGs1aa	1 MVP trophies and 1 Championship trophy|`|Wh7SEJMZaa	I say 1more maby 2 more mvps with 1 more championship|`|FUoKu13Daa	well give me the thumb down now,<br>  <br>  You really think Kobe is going to get 5 more MVPs?  or is this is what you are hoping for <br>  <br>  In either case Their is no way he will get 5 more leagues MVPs.  First of all their is too many good younger player like Wade and LBJ and Howard that will get the award this year and in the coming year, not to say Kobe will not get the award again but you are basically saying he will dominate the league basically in the next 5 years.<br>  <br>  in any case you are entitle to your opinion but realistically I think he will get the league mvp  award 1 or 2 more times before he retires.  <br>  <br>  as far as Championships I am saying 2 if they win it this year and if they do not then I would say 1 more.|`|H8u7gMAYaa	He needs to get atleast 1 more before he retires.
v77SnunOaa	he was not too old. Robert Parish is too old. he is was in the best shape of his life but Phil would not take him back out of fear he would smash Kobe bryants face in!

IMPvzBk1aa	Try Purina Equine Senior complete feed.  It is very easily digested, completely balanced nutrition, prevents colic, and puts weight on.  My hard keeper  22 year old Arab gelding does very well on it.  He gets free choice hay 24/7 and the senior twice a day, 5 lbs total.  He is 15.3 hh and in good weight.  In winter I add a cup of stabilized rice bran for the extra fat, since he is out 24/7 with a run in in very cold weather (-40 F at worst) and never blanketed.  He is never sick, and holds weight even in the coldest weather.

It is mac and pc compatible.  It is expandable (microSD card), uses USB, and it's waterproof.  Most of the Garmin handhelds are compatible with the geocaching.com site, where you would get most of your info.  That said, I now use a 3g iPhone for my geocaching.  I'm sure some traditionalist wouldn't approve, but it takes all the hassle out of geocaching.  As long as you have a cellular signal, you can get info on nearby geocaches.  There's an inexpensive app for the iPhone put out by geocaching.com that works nicely.  Maps can be pulled up quickly (both street maps and satellite maps), no preloading necessary.  And the gps in the phone is quite accurate, more so than what I experienced with my Garmin. For a first timer if you can swing the iPhone, go for it.  If not, find a USB compatible Garmin on craigslist.  It should set you back $75.|`|pWnvpLyCaa	Start with something inexpensive until you decide if you want to continue or not.  Check out craigslist, e-bay, etc for a used unit and play around with it.  If you're enjoying it and want to continue, then move up to something with mapping, routing, electronic compass, etc. and go for it.  My suggestion remains (I've posted this a number of times) the Garmin 60CSx.  I've used lot's of GPS units, and this is still tops for caching.|`|KkZE2NDYaa	I have a Garmin and it has programs built in for that but the basic map it came loaded with wasn't much. After I outlayed the money for the basic unit I discovered I really needed more detailed maps. Mine is an etrex Venture HC. The software for garmin is made by Mapsource and these types of softwares are not interchangeable. Magellan takes something different. etc. I bought topo map for the entire US and it wasn't cheap either. I think you might want to step up to the ones that have interchangeable memory cards, But mine works fine after I added the new maps. Just something to consider. I really like the Mapsource topo map and discovered it comes in handy for a lot of other things. The program is about 1gig and the ventureHC holds about 24k. Enough for about half the state of Ohio for example. But less area in places where there is more info, like Rocky Mtns. The mapsource also interacts with google earth so when I find something on the map I can switch to google earth and it goes right there. that's cool. But the hand held unit doesn't do that, just in my PC. I hope this helps, because I learned this stuff the hard way. All said and done, I'm not a geocache guy or a gadget guy, but I have really come to like my GPS.

Of course I have removed the stock and replaced with a TAPCO T6 stock, ground off the bayonet lug, modified the bolt to accommodate installing and removing the TAPCO 20 rnd magazines without having to have the bolt locked opened.

Generally $350 to $700 for the SKS. Actually everything is up- all AR15 and AK47 type variants, including nearly every alternative to the AK47/SKS like the Saiga 223, Saiga 7.62x39 and Mini 30.

XLXncQu9aa	That is a possibility.  It all depends on if they can keep their offense together.  Signing Kurt Warner was the right step in the direction for the Cardinals as it stands now.  But if they don't sign Boldin then they lose a key part of their offense which means they will have to sign another WR to take his place.  I think the 49'ers and the Rams will play tough this coming season.  Even though the NFC west is a terrible and weak division don't rule out the 49'ers.  Remember the defense of the Cardinals has to get better if they want a realistic shot at making the playoffs and winning their division.  So there are many variables to be considered.  Can they win?  Yes.  They did it this season.  But if they can depends on their competition, whether they keep Boldin or not, and if their defense plays better.|`|HMv6jvUCaa	I think the 49ers are going to take it from them|`|c17x6L4baa	One more time.  Boldin is contracted for two more years.  They will not LOSE him to another team.  They may trade him to improve a position they need help in.<br>  <br>  Way to early to think about the season because of how unsettled the situation is.  I think that when the dust settles, they will be in good position for a run.   But, right now they have about 40 players under contract.  Well under 1/2 of their FA signed.  Some visiting FA who could improve the team. <br>  <br>  Then do something to keep Boldin happier for his last two contracted years, or trade him to fill a position they need more help at than receiver.  Only three #2 receivers in the league finished ahead of Breaston.   Edgerin to deal with in some way.  At least the coaching line-up has been settled.|`|2JBRMFg1aa	Personally, I think this comes down to Matt Hasselbeck.<br>  If he stays fit and forms a good bond with T.J. - it`ll be hard to stop them.<br>  Losing Antonio Smith, and possibly losing Boldin are also major factors in this|`|153nXPCTaa	Their Defense is terrible. Which will eventually catch-up to them. Last year their offense was just so good that it made up for that. If Boldin leaves or Warner or Fitzgerald go down i think they would be terrible.|`|HNE7dJQiaa	Im not gunna say will, but theres a good chance.

I'd recommend the A-5 over the X7, simply because it's more or less the same but cheaper (with a less milsim look & different barrel threads).

A gun is no good if you can't use it effectively when you have too<br>  <br>  2.  Reliability.  If you don't get a feel for the gun, how to handle and use it properly, you may never find any bugs or problems with the gun before it may be too late.  Shoot it and test it out.  After a few hundred rounds, you will have your answer.  Also refer to number 1 after about 500 rounds.  You may find that it is better.  <br>  <br>  Show off guns?  Why get a gun to show when you can have one to shoot or carry.

hoZnJVXXaa	1 - Most carbon arrows before cutting are 32"<br>  2 - Easton and Carbon Express are different all are different....  .210" maybe<br>  3 - No threads.  Knock end has a point that you glue a knock on, the other end has a bare shaft with the Inner Diameter exposed.  You insert - get this, an insert that you then thread the tips in.  There are different TPI and diameter, depending on shaft size.<br>  4 - weight is depending on your arrow length.  Bow manufactures recommend a certain weight for the bow.  The arrow is what absorbs all that power when you release the string.  That is why when you dry fire a bow ( shooting with no arrow) you risk damaging the bow limbs.

Unless there is some other reason to require graphite such as arthritis or something stick with graphite in your driver only. Graphite is needed in those extra length big headed drivers to keep the weight down and it's not required in the shorter hybrids.|`|kGuJmQzSaa	shaft all depends on swing speed. I wouldn't go with steel because you can get the same strength nowadays in a graphite, but i would suggest stiff graphite if your swing speed is above average. . . . If you are a slower swinger who is all about contact, then you should go with a flex graphite shaft. Steel is great for irons, but the only way i'd suggest it for hybrids is if you like a heavy feel on your downswing. Specifically, you should check out Adam's graphite hybrids.|`|kTHIZPy5aa	Cold temps can cause minuscule cracks within graphite shafts so if you play in any cold weather buy steel shafts.

A midfielder, he is the current captain of the German national team, and plays club football for Chelsea in the English Premier League. In all the teams he has played in, he has always possessed the number 13 shirtBallack agreed to join Chelsea on a free transfer on 15 May 2006.[4] During his last season as a Bayern player there were rumours of interest from Manchester United, Real Madrid, Inter Milan and A.C. Milan,[5] but Ballack instead chose to go to Stamford Bridge. Shortly after arriving at Chelsea, Ballack stated that he hoped to end his career at Stamford Bridge.<br>  <br>  Ballack's debut for Chelsea came on Monday 31 July 2006, during a practice match at UCLA's intramural football pitch. Chelsea presented him to the media the following day where the club also gave him his favoured number 13 shirt, worn throughout his career. Upon doing so, William Gallas who previously wore the number 13 shirt for Chelsea was given the number 3 shirt. This move created animosity between Gallas and the club as Gallas felt that he was underappreciated.[6] On 27 August 2006, Ballack earned his English League debut for Chelsea against Blackburn Rovers, and his UEFA Champions League debut for Chelsea against Werder Bremen.<br>  <br>  Ballack scored his first goal for Chelsea on 21 September 2006 in the latter match against Werder Bremen. He received his first straight red card of his career in Chelsea's 1-0 win over Liverpool on 17 September 2006, after being judged to have stamped on Mohamed Sissoko's leg. Ballack scored his first goal in the English League on 21 October 2006 against Portsmouth at home with a header. His first FA Cup goal came in the 109th minute in a match against Blackburn Rovers on 15 April 2007. This goal resulted in Chelsea progressing into the FA Cup final. He scored eight goals in all competitions for the club in the 2006–07 season, including a free-kick against Everton at Goodison Park, as well as a half-volley against FC Porto which sent Chelsea through to the quarterfinals of the UEFA Champions League.<br>  <br>  On 28 April 2007, Chelsea released a statement on their official website, informing fans that Ballack had undergone ankle surgery in Munich. As a result of the surgery, Ballack did not play in the FA Cup Final against Manchester United, which Chelsea won 1–0 through Didier Drogba's extra time goal. This was Ballack's second trophy this season, his first being the Carling Cup.<br>  <br>  Chelsea left Ballack out of their Champions League squad for the 2007–08 group stage as they realised that his injury would prevent him from playing any useful part and preferred to select the fully fit Steve Sidwell. The German international had an ankle operation in the summer and Chelsea could not take the risk of him not regaining full fitness before the end of the Group Stage. Thus, Ballack could not play in the Champions League before the knockout stages began in February.[7] The club was only able to select 23 out of a possible 25 players for their Champions League squad due to the new UEFA regulations on 'association-trained players' and 'club-trained players'. Due to this regulation Chelsea were also unable to select young player Scott Sinclair and could only pick 23 players as their only 'club-trained player' was John Terry. For this reason it was deemed unwise to gamble on Ballack being fit at some point.[8]<br>  <br>  He was absent for eight months with an ankle injury, during which he feared that his football career might be in danger of ending as he was getting older. He made his return to the side in Chelsea's 2–0 Carling Cup win over Liverpool on 19 December. Ballack tallied an assist late in the game to striker Andriy Shevchenko. On 26 December, Ballack made his league return in a thrilling game against Aston Villa which ended 4–4. He came on for Frank Lampard in the 26th minute after the latter had picked up a thigh injury. In first-half stoppage time, he won a penalty after being brought down in the box by Zat Knight which Andriy Shevchenko converted. In the 88th minute, with the scores tied at 3–3, Ballack stepped up to take a free-kick which he buried into the bottom left corner of the goal, but the match ended in a 4–4 draw.<br>  <br>  Ballack captained the Chelsea team in the absence of captain John Terry, vice captain Frank Lampard in a 2–1 win over Newcastle on 29 December 2007. Ballack then played his 50th game in a Chelsea shirt in a 2–1 win against Fulham in which he scored the winning goal for Chelsea. He also scored the only goal that won the match for Chelsea against Reading to extend the blues' winning streak to a record of 9. And, on 5 March, he scored again, this time against Olympiacos CFP in the UEFA Champions League Round of 16 in a 3-0 win.<br>  <br>  With Chelsea's progress to the 2007–2008 Champions League Quarter-Finals, Michael Ballack is the only player to have reached the Champions League Quarter-Finals with four different clubs. He scored the winning goal in the 2-0 win|`|sQdQJp06aa	He plays for Chelsea  FC In the English Premier League.

Cleveland's best bet would be to draft a RB, Lewis is getting older he will be 30 at the start of this season and everybody knows when RBs hit 30 they start going down hill fast. The Offensive Line is one of the best in the league and built for running the ball. Moreno, Wells, and McCoy are good but not Top 5 pick material but they won't be available in the second round. I would draft Wells and let him be the back up for Lewis. Wells is 6'1" 235 lbs. real big for a RB and for his size is quick, agile, and fast. If he doesn't get injured he could be an every down back I don't think Moreno or McCoy can be every down backs in the NFL they would be more suited for a passing type offense|`|vz2Bedmyaa	either one, you wont beat the steelers.|`|JH9IMMDtaa	JENKINS!!!!!!!!!!

Black powder firearms give you more of a push than a smack like a modern rifle.<br>  To load a Springfield 1861; cock hammer to the half cock position, pull a paper cartridge from cartridge box, bite the twisted end off and pour the powder in the muzzle, remove the remaining paper from minnie ball an insert it in the muzzle and push it down with your thumb, remove ram rod and firmly seat the ball on top of powder charge, replace ram rod under barrel, remove cap from cap box and place on nipple, cock hammer to the full cock position, aim and fire.  The cap sends a jet of fire into the chamber that ignites the powder charge.  The musket kicks back and your target  is obscrued from view by the cloud of smoke for a second or two until it disapates or the wind clears it.  Then you start all over again.

F2OQVXRtaa	Contrary to Ben's "sage-like" opinion on the matter (nice job, man), Sage could carry the team by not making major mistakes (that's all this team needs right now).  <br>  <br>  The west-coast offense benefits with a high completion percentage QB. Sage has averaged 62% in his career with 64-69% in the last three seasons. He's done that with most defenses playing pass coverage (because, really, did Houston have a run game?). Compare that with T-Jacks 58% (at best) and you get part of the picture. Add to this the fact that Sage has been sacked only 16 times in 32 games over the past three years (compared with T-Jack's 41 times in 25 games) and you get another part of the picture. To be completely honest, I don't know if Sage is a better game-manager than Gus but he seems a better option than T-Jack in most areas. And Sage is 7 years younger than Gus. So, he's younger and more mobile than Gus (who was sacked 40 times in the last 19 games) with the same completion percentage (aka: good game management). Definitely better completion percentage than T-Jack. The Vikings will not get Cassell (bad blood with Belichick), McNabb (Eagles aren't that dumb), nor do they want Garcia (older than Gus, questions of durability, etc). If you know a better QB out there that the Vikings can get please let me know...but considering they just need someone to NOT screw up--Sage is a decent choice. <br>  <br>  Let's not forget, people, Trent Dilfer has a Superbowl ring (and we all know why)!  Will Sage carry the team with explosive plays and pro-bowl heroics?...nah.  Will he carry the team by not messing up.  Could be!|`|2VVU7gNfaa	LMAO!<br>  <br>  Sage Rosenfels is the best QB the Vikings could come up with?  Really?

Culpepper had a great year with the Vikings and had an undefeated season until they got to the playoffs and blew it.  Rosenfels has never and will never see an undefeated season.  He makes just as much interceptions as T. Jackson.  I still think that Michael Vick is the only choice that the Vikings have to win a Superbowl.  They have been building up the Defense and the Offensive line has always been the best in the league, bar none.  The one other position they need to fill is a wide receiver that can get open and catch the passes Vick can deliver for this team.|`|daRDQE9maa	No, I don't believe that Sage can take the vikings to the super bowl. I don't think that he is consistent enough. In order for him to be the one to take them to the super bowl they will have to rely on a strong running attack of Adrian Peterson and the running game. It's possible for him to anythings possible I just don't see it happening.|`|DSJOxz0Qaa	Short answer...no.  The guy may have posted big numbers with Andre Johnson, but his turnover numbers were very high as well.  Right now he is the perfect example of a hot and cold quarterback.  With less talent at wide-out than he had in Houston and a new playbook to learn I would expect more mistakes than he is already known to make per start (and his TD/TO ratio is not that great now).|`|B8sJEBxTaa	Can Sage beat the Colts?

Nash<br>  <br>  Obviously, Jackson needs to be on the SF list.<br>  <br>  And finally, Kevin Martin should be a few notches higher on the SG list.<br>  <br>  <br>  But overall, nice list.

1z7M3Tntaa	Kelly no doubt <br>  <br>  WQ: Absolutely Bourne but I honestly think Kofi should be replaced with Low Ki I wanna see what he can do in that kindof macth, plus it would be a greta place for a debut. But Vince probably doesn't think highly of Low ki to do that.|`|khU8m4gxaa	I believe Kelly is the more athletic of the 2 and a better wrestler, but I'm not expecting any classics out of either one anytime soon.<br>  <br>  Evan Bourne would be a great addition, but it's hard to imagine they'd put 2 ECW guys in it. Maybe Bourne will defeat Mark Henry for his spot since Henry is not a realistic competitor for this type of match. Kofi was taken out of the chamber, so it's possible they add him here, but I don't see it happening. <br>  <br>  A unification of the Womens & Divas belts are possible I suppose. There really isn't a need for both. Cena I expect will be in a triple threat with Big Show & Edge. Kozlov may not be on the card at all. Mysterio could be in the MITB, or in a specialty match with Knox again.|`|Xkm4PstOaa	Kelly Kelly is bad and Maria is horrible... does that answer your question?  If I had to chose one; Kelly Kelly is the "better" of the two.<br>  <br>  WQ: I would really like to see Evan Bourne in the match, that would really put MITB over the edge for me.  I would like Kofi to be in it as well, but I won't mind the match without him either.<br>  <br>  WQ2:  For the Divas I've heard that it could be Melina v. Maryse; and, somehow, Trish Stratus v. Michelle McCool (just a rumor of course).<br>  <br>  John Cena, I'm sure, will be entered in the Edge/Big Show match.<br>  <br>  Not sure about Rey or Kozlov.  Sorry...|`|4tvI9WYjaa	maria kelly kelly is a wanna be diva she can't wrestle if her live depends on it.<br>  i think yeah that be great also get rid off mark henry and put john morrison in as well make it more exciting and mr kennedyto take the last spot !<br>  john cena is expected to  face hogan<br>   i think melina vs mayse ?<br>  rey mysterio could also have a rematch to get in the money in the bank or have raw vs smackdown match|`|U6tE9LhJaa	Kelly Kelly<br>  <br>  WQ: Yes, they are 2 of the most exciting wrestlers in WWE|`|EJMtFvq4aa	kelly kelly <br>  marias the worst wrestler ever if they say maria is better they are crazy<br>  <br>  WQ: Yeah they got all these big non high flying guys in it they would make it more exciting<br>  <br>  Something with Maryse.melina, and michelle mccool cause she attacked melina at last nights smackdown tapings<br>  <br>  John Cena might face Hulk Hogan i heard, Kozlov is too boring to be in the car, and rey mysterio no idea yet maybe mike knox?|`|PXlrpUsLaa	Kelly<br>  <br>  WQ: no, John Morrison, and Evan Bourne...and there is 5 spots left<br>  so Kennedy,Morrison,Bourne,Kozlov, and saddly Kingston<br>  <br>  i hate Kofi,Kozlov, and Bourne with a passion|`|rgQ2zUkxaa	kelly is a much better wrestler but marai is getting better|`|QLyBuwAAaa	Kelly Kelly|`|qwdh7N6saa	kelly kelly<br>  And yes I think kofi kingston and evan bourne should get the last two place they derves it.|`|gr6bcnztaa	Chuck Norris|`|gXHxf2G9aa	I think Kelly Kelly has the better wrestling skills to be honest.  She has improve alot over the last few months and has victories over Victoria and Beth Phoenix to her credit.  Maria is talented but doesn't seem to be able to hold her own in some matches and gets easily "confused" in matches.  She seems to let her feelings get in the way in some of her matches.<br>  <br>  I hope so cause Evan Bourne has proven himself time and time again.  Also Kofi Kingston deserves a spot in the MITB after what happened to him at No Way Out in the Elimination Chamber match.
r8rykCkGaa	Easier to run on an empty stomach, but you'll probably get hunger pains and lose strength because of such a long run.  Better if you eat at least an hour before you run (otherwise you get cramps) and eat some protein and carbohydrates, because they will be with you longer and help to give you the strength for a long run.|`|u4liwDhAaa	Have fun on your run!

And bring a granola bar/jelly beans with you for energy. If you don't eat anything, you will run out of energy and flop on your run.|`|T6PzMyPBaa	eat something like porridge or a banana.<br>  and take some food with you.<br>  nothing extremely heavy though just something that will keep you going like a cereal bar<br>  if you're a runner you should know that|`|NK6AtTWBaa	Empty stomach. All the food you eat will move around in your stomach and you will throw it all back up.  Eat before you go to bed and that should give you enough energy to<br>  Complete tue run.

He says that he accepts Shawn's challenge. <br>  <br>  * A Shawn Michaels video package is shown.<br>  <br>  * Matt Hardy vs. Jeff Hardy tonight with the winner getting a spot in the Money in the Bank ladder match at WrestleMania.<br>  <br>  * Jeff Hardy goes to Vickie's office. He said he won't fight Matt but he will qualify for the Money in the Bank ladder match.<br>  <br>  * Matt Hardy comes out to the ring and cuts a promo. He talks about how Jeff won't fight him but says once they both qualify, he'll finally get his hands on him. He's drawing a lot of heel heat.<br>  <br>  * MVP b. Matt Hardy to qualify for the Money in the Bank ladder match at WrestleMania 25.<br>  - MVP builds up a solid offense early on. Matt counters and attempts to connect with Twist of Fate. MVP reverses it to get the win via pinfall. <br>  <br>  * Jeff Hardy vs. Shelton Benjamin is announced for tonight.<br>  <br>  * R-Truth b. Chavo Guerrero<br>  - Good back and forth match. R-Truth gets the win via pinfall.<br>  <br>  * The Big Show & Edge contract signing is up next.<br>  <br>  * Vickie starts the segment in the ring. Edge comes out without the World Heavyweight Championship belt and asks Vickie about what is going on with her and Big Show. Big Show comes out... They sign the contract. Big Show then cuts a promo saying that Edge is not a good champion and Vickie agrees. John Cena comes out and interrupts. Cena cleans house hitting Big Show with a low blow and throwing Edge into the ring post then hitting him with a table. Cena whispers something in Vickie's ear and leaves. Vickie leaves the ring in tears.<br>  <br>  * Maryse b. Eve in a non-title match<br>  - Michelle McCool joins Tazz & Jim Ross on commentary. Lots of boring chants started throughout the match. After the match, Melina comes out and is attacked by Michelle. <br>  <br>  * Shelton Benjamin b. Jeff Hardy in a Money in the Bank ladder match qualifier<br>  - Shelton gets the win after Matt Hardy comes out and hits him disqualifying Jeff. <br>  <br>  * Triple H vs. Umaga<br>  - Triple H starts out at a strong pace, but Umaga eventually gains control. Power shifts back and forth. According to several of our correspondents it appears as if Umaga tweaked his leg as the referee held up the "x" signal. Legacy comes out of the crowd and attacks Triple H. Randy Orton keeps teasing the punt. He stands over Triple H as this week's SmackDown goes off the air.|`|sqfjfR3iaa	Because it would completely disrupt the WWE Schedule of doing the Live events and Television Tapings at the beginning of the week and doing House shows the rest of the week.

l3AZzVfMaa	If they release a creative character like Boogeyman then they should really release that boring character (if you want to call him a character) Big Show!|`|eXZ5O8vdaa	WWE is permanently thrash now, unless they make WM 25 very brilliant and entertaining, I mean look how fast they are releasing the superstar's with some talent, Vince pisses the hell out of me all the time. Yeah, we all could stand another 7 months or so of Triple H as champion and him burying Randy Orton? NO NO NO NO! AND NOOOOO!!! The Boogeyman haven't made a long while here even before years because of his injury if I'm correct. They released too much young superstars.<br>  <br>       I like WWE still just that it hurts you and it lives with you at the same time like a disease.

9rCHDz9Maa	I am 25 and in good shape (I workout 4 times a week) My dad taught me to play baseball pretty much since birth. I have never missed a season since I started playing tee ball.  With that said I am not a pro always wanted to but I had other dreams as well.  Last year I was clocked at 88mph but that was one pitch I am consistently around the mid 80's area.|`|xIfvXy4waa	I would guess 35, and it's wicked accurate.

My brother, some friends, and I were all thoroughly embarassed.  We got smoked by high school age kids, and we all played ball when we were younger, I was even a pitcher.  We all threw in the low 70's that night.  the HS kids were throwing in the high 70's to high 80's.|`|zdQgOzYXaa	I bet if we get a some highschoolers answering, we will get a bunch of high 80's low 90's....<br>  <br>  <br>  I bet I could at least hit 45. But then again, I haven't thrown a ball in over 10 years...maybe 50!|`|sitkfn5Maa	i have been clocked and i said i dont want to know so i dont know but its up there past 80 but lower than 93. so in between 80-93 mph.|`|eac78f41a64d286478c23785cf30be23aa	To use an old baseball joke, they'd be able to clock my "fastball" with a sun dial...which is why I've been wearing a necktie for more of my life than I wore spikes...|`|rzc1oLktaa	Probaly 79-81 Mph.|`|414b7351b200219e50b4bef935b60195aa	45 mph, and it's pretty dead-on.|`|c03a1e29209b69a15065f8edab5c54daaa	High 70's, around 78.

Get it while you can.|`|XNpnK4vpaa	Thanks for sharing another expensive way to dress-up a Ruger 10/22.
khU8m4gxaa	I've always preferred more realistic characters. I understand the appeal of the cartoonish guys, kids like that kind of thing, but Boogeyman particularly was a terrible in-ring worker. Add to the fact that he is over 40 and injury prone. It made sense to let him go. He was fired once before until Booker T went to bat for him & they brought him back. He wasn't over anymore & his worm gimmick had run its course.|`|fmUGHvgHaa	thanks a lot|`|310m2T4Daa	"Cartoonish Character"????????? WTF!!!!!<br>  <br>  BOOOGGGEEYYYMMMAANNN!!! NNOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO|`|UWJinEbIaa	I guess now they can have the ultimate dream match of Boogeyman vs  Gronda in AAA.|`|U6tE9LhJaa	again<br>  <br>  bq: No, because they want PG gimmick not like Stone Cold beer drinkin, middle finger flippin syle|`|gNeFtZdBaa	WWE SUX<br>  BOGEYMAN ROCKS

uzNm9KtYaa	I will NEVER forget a spot where the Lady in my life and I camped out for a few days.  It was beautiful, and in late September, we had it ALL to ourselves....choosing from more than 50 campsites....settling for one right at the lip of the falls.  The spot?  Manitou Falls.  The occasion?  Our honeymoon in 1980!  It was beautiful.  It is STILL unforgettable.  (So is she!)  Look for it on the map north of Duluth, MN along the North Shore Drive.  In the fall of the year, people come from all over the globe to see how beautiful the fall colors are.  Been there and done that!  I can HIGHLY recommend it to you.  Go for it.|`|lTeXIjpOaa	you can camp in the national forest, i would ask the forest service about where would be a good spot, there are a lot of animals near superior, wolves, coyotes, bears, snakes, etc. so be careful where you keep your food, and keep your tent zipped up|`|4r16YB35aa	There is a highway along the lake so you can drive along.  I found a good camp site in a state forest near a state park.  I think it was along Hyw 1.  You can camp in all national forests away from campsites if you are 100 yards from the road.  Otherwise you need to pay.  The whole area is great hiking and canoeing go for it.|`|4GeKyXnmaa	You might need a permit, but there are plenty of areas you can camp. Watch out, they have got a wolf attack there like two years ago.
73nTYgdraa	You DON'T want to do any dive/shoot techniques on him since you have light years to his legs and you have to bend your back a lot!!!<br>  <br>  Having long arms and a good reach is BS, that won't get you anywhere unless you are boxing or MMA fighting. So how to take him down? as one of the previous posters said; use Osotogari and Ouchigari. Go for leg sweeps and take downs using your legs and your long reach with your legs.<br>  <br>  My instructors always tell the tall guys i'm sparring against to sweep me down and go with their leg reach. His legs are a lot closer to mine, making it a lot easier.<br>  So any take down involving you taking him down with your legs would work on him, unless he's good at defending.|`|AA10482044	A .38 caliber.<br>  If you believe that he is stronger and he's not just all bluff he will win.  Tall has the psychological advantage as long as you aren't ungainly but you need technique and or belief/know you are right, too win.|`|zLUQJxJkaa	I'm also very tall. I find it's much harder to take down or go to the ground with someone shorter.. my weight distribution is far greater than his and my center of gravity is much higher. <br>  I use standup fighting to keep him away, if he comes in I can move easily and pick him apart from my distance.|`|LnJjS8BRaa	Leg sweeps are your best bet as has been said. Be care you don't "reach" for the sweep though; maintain a solid balance because both of those techniques are easily countered in a mirrored fashion. Even if they don't go for the same technique to put you down they can still capitalize on your weak balance.<br>  <br>  Ask your teacher to work with you on some options. You'll get a much better picture seeing it. Good luck.|`|KkkugCJ0aa	osotogari<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.judoinfo.com/quiz0297_3.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.judoinfo.com/quiz0297_3.htm</a><br>  <br>  or ouchi gari<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.judoinfo.com/images/nauta/ouchigari.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.judoinfo.com/images/nauta/ouc...</a>|`|4832a00e449f384a9f045b8ca0b7b4cfaa	A weapon of any sort or take a defense training class!  Since,learning about something is one thing,but actually learning about it by doing it is totally different!|`|OrM5Xrnoaa	Use your log arms to your advantage. A single leg take down or a double leg take down would be your best options.|`|AA10698309	How about a roundhouse to the head? Knock him out.

First, if it was to take place just before the bodybuilder's competion then Chuck has no problem kicking the living tar out of him.  Bodybuilders are huge but they have restricted and slow movement due to their size.  Before competion they dehydrate themselfs so they will have better musscle appearance.  <br>  <br>  Almost any pro bodybuilder would lose to chuck.|`|KUUfGugFaa	1) chuck is a martial artist.<br>  2) most body builders are not that strong just big. if you train for hypertrophy then strength is second to growth.<br>  3) if you said a strong man or a 18 stone cage fighter i would probably have said no.|`|dmX3zwbHaa	Body builders train for the 'looks' those muscle are not functional + they are slow as hell and have no technic as any other human that don't train in martial arts.|`|KbxPl1oYaa	Spinning back kick.

KNTofuxMaa	There are a few staple questions in this section...<br>  <br>  What position should I play?<br>  Who will win the Super Bowl?<br>  Is Tom Brady the best ever?<br>  and<br>  Where will Michael Vick play?<br>  <br>  Welcome to the off season in the football section.|`|sPiwb8Hraa	I didn't believe myself that he would ever be allowed to return to the NFL, but based on media reports he will be. So that is where all the questions are coming from.|`|lrJN4M49aa	Suspended means just that indefinitely means the commissioner hasn't put a time frame on it. By I agree whats up with all the Vick questions. To many crackpots with no real life. The man did a crime, he is going to do his time. Then he should be allowed to go back to work. and for you people thinking know team will take him are on crack. He hasn't finished his sentence yet and teams are already expressing interest in him.|`|mTSOJKlyaa	i disagree i think it is probable that he comes back in plays, how good he will be or his role is up for debate.<br>  <br>  <br>  when you use all caps like that it makes you look like an ignorant child, and is hard to take your seriously.|`|AA10776364	Indefinitely simply means there was no time frame, meaning the suspension can be lifted at anytime.  He did an aweful thing, but he also served his time, and he deserves a second chance.|`|UgnMjtYDaa	You are a "player hater". vick can come play for my favorite team any day.|`|7B9KEqCnaa	indefinitely does not mean forever.  He  is suspended till the commissioner feels like he wants to let him back into the league.  at the longest its going to be suspended for a year.  at the shortest it will be a 4-6 weeks into the season.  Its going to be up to the individual teams to decide if he is worth the public relation nightmare.|`|YN8Rbjogaa	Matt, Chris Henry is an idiot, i"ll give you that, but was not convicted of felony animal cruelty charges, and did not serve prison time for his actions. Vick, I hope, NEVER gets another shot at the NFL! These guys have all the talent in the world, and they think that they are untouchable! Unfortunately, there will probably be some clueless owner willing to give the felon another chance!|`|oEOIk3nfaa	I don't think that's right. Chris Henry plays for the Bengals year after year. I think with that being said, Vick will have no problem finding a job in the NFL, and I for one wouldn't mind him on the Redskins.|`|zFNOaDAYaa	Not true. He could be cleared to play as early as June.|`|jLOCqhckaa	Actually allot of teams have there eye on him.|`|YRRXtVXeaa	I AM AFRAID MY FRIEND, THAT HE WILL!! FOR HOUSTON TEXANS!!

ozVqauMXaa	I am in exactly the same dilemna as you are, and I'm honestly not sure who to take either.  The more I look at it, the more conservative I tend to lean...Pujols.  He's almost a guarantee to put up mvp numbers, while there is a small amount of risk with Hanley and Arod.  Maybe the best method would be to just keeping an eye on each in spring training, and go with your gut.|`|vkT7xRuxaa	Pujols is the best hitter in baseball. hanley ramirez is a little overrated in my book, but he might do a lot better due to the move up. Go with Pujols. He is solid all the way.|`|dSpABqSPaa	Pujols. Best player in the game and will make a run for his 3rd MVP this year. I went with Pujols in my league and I'm very happy.|`|wo9ibxfXaa	adam everett|`|RDxBhQa1aa	if you take a-roid then you must have be drunk. There is absolutely no depth in the SS position. There are 3 really good shortstops and the rest are horrible trust me. Jeter sucks hes on downside. Peralta sucks too and drew sucks. TAKE HANLEY. Screw marlins lineup look what he has done already in the lineup. For 1B you can take adrian gonzalez 4th round and you'd still be fine.|`|F65Km3Coaa	take han ram
I1w0HfQbaa	Yes, I would say his opinion is highly respected in the sport of boxing. I liked his commentary for the Tyson-Douglas fight on the ESPN Tyson DVD set. He made a good argument that Aaron Snowell and Jay Bright, Tyson's cornermen at the time, had no clue as to what they were doing. They were supposed to bring in an enswell to reduce the bruising a fighter takes usually around his eyes and they brought in a plastic glove filled with water to reduce the swelling around Tyson's eyes in between rounds of the fight! It was hilarious! <br>  <br>  His analysis of the Holmes-Cooney fight was spot-on. He felt Cooney won only a few rounds because Holmes after scoring a knockdown in the second round was trying too hard to load up on punches so Cooney was able to win a few rounds. He pointed out there were fighters during Cooney's time--specifically he mentions Renaldo Snipes and Trevor Berbick--who wanted a fight with Cooney. So he gives some information that we do not know about.|`|XwQxKwRcaa	I suppose in general you are probably right. <br>  <br>  I personally prefer Larry Merchant. I always felt like Sugar was pushing something, like a book or Boxing Illustrated, all of the time.<br>  <br>  <br>  As an aside, I wonder what would have happened if Gerry Cooney fought Mike Weaver in 1982 for the WBA Heavyweight title.|`|4432bf9b709422220cc7a44ccbf8f500aa	Bert Sugar is truly a throwback to how sports reporters used to be.  He has forgotten more about boxing than I could ever dream of learning. . .but he's not smug about it.  I talk with him every few months, and every June at the HOF Inductions. . . and he's always friendly and cordial.  <br>  <br>  Are his opinions the most respected, though. . . that's a tough one.  There are those who think Bert tries to be too much of a character.  Others think he's just a bit too opinionated.  I disagree with both of those perceptions.  I think he's a goldmine of boxing knowledge, and his writing is considered pretty much gospel.  <br>  <br>  When the great Hank Kaplan was still around, I'd have said that he and Bert were "neck and neck" in the world of boxing historians.  Unfortunately, with Hank's passing last year, Bert is really part of a dying breed of boxing personalities. . . one that I wish younger broadcasters would emulate just a bit more.|`|4d7b908cfe24bf3f1177a5cca13feb22aa	Time for The Fudd to get some well-earned thumbs down.  While I suppose BRS's opinions are the most respected, I believe that to be from from his "Hat and Cigar" gimmick and making his eyes bulge out with every sylable when he says "Jack DEMP-SEY".<br>  <br>  If you and I had the time to study boxing history, we'd be every bit as respected as BRS.  However, I believe that the guys that have actually been in the ring taking those horrific beatings are the ones that are the true experts.  It's like book knowledge versus real-world knowledge.  All the studying in the world can't equal what it must be like to take a punch from a trained, professional heavyweight boxer.  As much as I'd like to know, there's no way I'll ever talk a heavy into hitting me.<br>  <br>  Bert Randolph Sugar went up to Larry Holmes to tell The Easton Assassin that he rated him as the 9th greatest off all time.  As if BRS's positive opinion is something Larry Holmes craves.  I guess BRS expected Larry to say "Thank you massah", but Larry said right back to him, (paraphrasing) "You crazy, that's 8 too low".  <br>  <br>  Seriously, tho...Does BRS really think his opinion is something that a guy like Larry Holmes should value?  Holmes found validation in his career when he got the decision over Mercer.  It's my view that BRS has an inflated view of himself.|`|kqP7GwOcaa	Yes, Bert has been around boxing for a long time, and his opinions are very respected.  That said ElmerFuddstein has a point, Bert's a bit of a side show.  Historical opinions have a place, but those who were actually in the ring have a better perspective than the fans.  Bert, for all his intellect, is just a fan with an opinion.|`|BNqbOfBsaa	I would have to say no. He seems to idolize some of these guys a little too much. I do respect the guys opinion though but he also a little full of himself. He seems like an old Kellerman to me.|`|IJfUZeBUaa	Absolutely. Bert is a Friend of mine and before you and I arrived on the Yahoo scene there was a guy by the name of "Santana D" that personally knew Bert and they would sit and chat for hours upon hours talking about fights that took place and never took place. Their combined knowledge of the sport was truly out of this world. <br>    Santana D was the absolute best here in this forum and he said "Burt, who is a friend of mine has more knowledge of this great sport of mine than any person alive today" with that said, Bert is the man, nobody comes close now "Santana D" was right up there.|`|8Sw8rJgtaa	Bert is ok,he tells a good story and has a good knowledge of history.He is entertaining but can have his facts mixed up sometimes and can confuse myth with fact.Kellerman sucks the big one,likes all the overhyped fighters.Teddy Atlas is great at teaching the fight game to the viewer like Gil Clancy was.They really break down the fight game and know what they are talking about.Al Bernstein is also a very good analyst.|`|5db8a4d79ef1c9ff462987bc954ba65baa	I say yes.  He has a great knowledge of the history of the sport and if he seems to lack respect for the modern day boxer,I think that may be due to the status of boxing today.  Everyone used to know who the Heavyweight Champion of the World was.  Now, I think even sports fans would have a a hard time naming him, or them.|`|ElH6jMEXaa	He's a little too much like a folktale historian and doesn't lend enough credence to the abilities of more modern boxers.<br>  <br>  I like Steve Farhood for sort of written commentary, Freddie Roach, Roy Jones, Brian Kenney, Bernard Hopkins, and a host of others are usually pretty good with accurate takes on fights, fighters and the sport in general.|`|pR0pJNJkaa	I would say yes because he has been around so long and has a historic perspective that has looked at different eras personally. I like him better than Larry Merchant. Max Kellerman is next really good one coming up.<br>  I miss Roy Jones as an HBO analyst. His was always very accurate in his assessments.|`|acaAycEXaa	Somewhat, but not nearly as much as Ray Arcel was. He was the ultimate boxing guru.|`|Fx2lB9LYaa	i like bert sugar he gets to the point no bull crap he has said many of times vlad klitsko puts him to sleep when he fights|`|d61511600922f016b452fc8b39ab7408aa	He's been around the sport for so long I would talk his option on most of the things he says about Boxing.|`|cyqGJZNOaa	In a historical sense, I would think so. In terms of modernity, I would go to other people for my information. The only time I ever see Bert get face time is on discussions of boxing's history. And with the hat and cigar props, you can't take this guy too serious.<br>  <br>  In terms of opinions on the actual sport, I'm a huge fan of Teddy Atlas. He really points out the subtleties and strategies that a "regular' fan could never see. Also, in a general context including commentating, history, and criticism, I think no one can beat Kellerman.<br>  <br>  Oh wow, I can't people I almost forgot someone...of Youtube fame. "The Islander" on his youtube show "Boxinginfo" Really smart guy with a critical eye and great ability to judge talent. Go check him out if you haven't.|`|TaF8aalpaa	Respected: Probably so.  I think Teddy Atlas has the best eye for what's happening in the ring and what a fighter & corner should do to win the fight.  His ability to control Tyson vs. what happened to Tyson without Atlas is proof-positive that he has the goods.  I also like the blatant honesty of Max Kellerman.  Lennox Lewis & Emmanuel Steward say some things that make me wonder how either of them entered boxing's elite as fighter & trainer.
K2Sl8tnNaa	Yes, I would say that Shaquille O'neal is a good role model. Let me tell you why. Shaq is a father. He has a family and takes very good care of them. He also loves the game and the other players surrounding him. I would look up to him!|`|9d06cffec852de9a7554521403313f02aa	I don't think it matters all that much whether or not he's a nice or admirable guy off the court...when kids grow up watching a player they care most about what they do on the court, and I don't believe that Shaq is a good role model in that respect.  Not that he's not a good player, he's one of the most dominant forces the game has ever seen.  But 99% of the players that watch him while growing up will not grow up to be 7'1" and 350 pounds...so if they admire what he does on the basketball court and try to incorporate it into their own game, it probably won't do much for them.  They'd be much better off admiring and trying to model their game after a fundamentally sound player like a kobe, cp3, pierce, or nash.|`|Zb1fCvWPaa	i dont think so cause when shaq gets annoyed he becomes extremely inappropriate and disrespectful but sometimes maybe its just in the moment and in the heat of the game and o ya *** shaq kobe doesnt taste ur *** ***** lol he tasting kobes now especially when kobe wins bak to bak mvps|`|Tgy7n4HLaa	He's a funny guy but sometimes he crosses the line so I wouldn't look up to him as a role model.|`|SvjbAiN2aa	ya i think so he seems like if he saw kids playing basketball he would stop by and play with them|`|fZ38PPgSaa	somewhat|`|C4mzZwiWaa	yea he is.|`|12cYuQ5haa	no, rap about kobe|`|c3tADklmaa	He is, but I don't think kissing other people in the head can be as great as others.|`|ZdNSSm0waa	Yes<br>  <br>  As a 12 year old kid (yes, I'm 12), I can honestly say that shaq has influenced me in many ways. On the court, in class, etc.|`|0fb4ce4da0f3875154ab271a088412fcaa	Shaquille O'Neal is overall a pretty good guy. I don't know if you mean a good role model on the court or off the court but he can be both at times. Shaquille O'Neal has his faults and his bad times, but he can be a funny and admirable guy sometimes. Hes an off and on guy but isn't somebody to really look up too. Hes a good player and has been around the league but I don't think a role model is what he is compared to Tim Duncan who is always a good guy. Really, he has his off and on times. At one time he was my role model but hes not the greatest role model and hes not a bad one.|`|uwx7etCXaa	Are you kidding me with that question?  Of course he is a good role model.  Because of him, the NBA had to correct a few wrongs in the league.  <br>  <br>  1. Basketball rims and structures: when he started playing, he would play HARD and break the backboards.<br>  <br>  2. Hack-a-Shaq Rule: the name says it all.  Teams around the league are using the strategy and no matter who they are fouling, it's still called the Hack-a-Shaq.<br>  <br>  The Lakers 3-peated with his help and the Heat also won with his help.  He works and plays hard.  We can't draw conclusions about his personal life with the stories in the media, we only hear the bad things.  So overall, he is a great role model.|`|piZ4xDBqaa	He's not a BAD guy.  He's got a few faults, could use a better work ethic, but all in all he's a pretty decent guy.  I'd rather have my kid grow up emulating Tim Duncan or Steve Nash, but if he wanted to be just like Shaq, I wouldn't stay up nights wondering where I'd gone wrong as a parent.|`|13XU8cCKaa	I can't!
yk4S7uuraa	The MRI was cancelled, and today they said he's targetting pitching the opener in Cincinnati on April 6.|`|lVGHhDn1aa	First off, I'm no Mets fan, but I wouldn't be too worried about Santana's current health problems as long as the Mets handle it right. If they listen to Johan and start him opening day, it'd pretty much show they have no idea what they're doing. A baseball season is a 162 game marathon, not a sprint. With a improved bullpen and a typical Johan down the stretch the Mets should win their division by default. Rushing him into the season would risk aggravating, what is as of right now, benign health problems that can be solved with simply some time.|`|DpAkYZaqaa	Santana's MRI was canceled, because it felt better. He's been through 46 pitches today. He feels he'll make opening day|`|ZyfYh4vdaa	they canceled his MRI and he threw a bullpen session to (46 pitches) and he said their was no pain. he wants pitch opening day|`|iT8CNh6paa	what? they said he felt fine after a 30+ pitch session and is shooting for an opening day position|`|kGXU1Dotaa	You would think they would send him for an MRI better safe then sorry.
lVGHhDn1aa	Yankees, hands down. The '86 Mets squad was great, but the '98 Yankees are one, if not the greatest, team of all time. One would be hard pressed to find a team with a better combination of talent and chemistry, especially among the lineup and position players. The '86 Mets might have the better rotation with Ron Darling, Sid Fernandez and a young Doc Gooden, but it's hard to argue with 114 wins and only one playoff loss.|`|B46t8gkLaa	i say 86 mets. strawberry and gooden bringing down the house.|`|64885351338a3018fbec0b632730aea5aa	the 1969 mets wow what a team|`|iT8CNh6paa	the 98 yankees were one of the greatast teams in the history of mlb, but so were the 86 Mets, but i give it to the 98 yankees, they won 125 games!!|`|ubGNtkHQaa	1998 Yankees. As we saw, the '86 mets were really lucky.|`|n4dnIrBlaa	I think the Mets. Both lineups were beyond great but the Mets pitching was unbelievable. The team ERA was that of an ace. It was 2.99 and they had a league leading 28 shut outs, that's unbelievable. Pitching wins championships and those were both championship teams. That's how I see it, it would be great to see.|`|yk4S7uuraa	As a Mets' fan, I have to stick with my team. I will say the Mets would win the Series in 7 games; and if Posada would play the role of Bill Buckner, it'll be a perfect series.<br>  <br>  ...that's my take!<br>  <br>  I still have a "stone in the tubes" over that pitch he called from Clemens the night Roger laid out Mike Piazza in Yankee Stadium.|`|zdQgOzYXaa	Probably the 98 Yankees. All of the 86 Mets are really getting up in years and have been away from the game for a long time. Some of the 98 Yankees are still playing.|`|kGXU1Dotaa	The yankees won 125 games that yr no way the met's would of beat us.but i'm not taking anything away from the 86 Mets they were a great team but the yanks were better.

xHwnTjJqaa	The first thing you need to do is make sure you're eating right. I know I sound like a broken record, but it can't be stressed enough in our culture. NO soda, unless it's organic, and even with that only once a week. NO fast food, bring a healthy snack if you'll be out and about. Eat plenty of fruits and veggies, make a fruit and fat free yogurt in the morning, and at another meal if possible. Watch what you eat at school, bring a lunch! Your friends may thing you're crazy with drastic changes in your diet, but they won't once you drop a bunch of weight! After you've began the eating thing, start juggling the ball, every chance you get! Then start running, begin with walking, and work your way up to jogging 45 min, then running, then running for 90 min. Go online and watch videos teaching how to do some awsome feints and tricks, learn them! <br>  Pretty soon you'll feel, look, and be a much healtheir, and fitter soccer player!!!<br>  Good luck!|`|m0QaQZhLaa	Ok the most important thing besides conditioning is ball control. You need to be touching a ball daily, no exceptions. Juggle during your free time. If you have a good wall outside, get a ball and pass it off the wall at angles so you have to change directions and run to get it. Try to one touch it back and keep everything moving. And of course, play the game any chance you get. Just remember, ball control is key. Coaches love it.|`|JRqTrv3Qaa	okay, continue to push yourself and make sure you keep hydrated. my coach says to always push. fight for the one extra step. it may hurt, but give out all the strength in you. Get a soccer ball and start working on your dribbling with the ball. first start out with passing it in between your legs and toe touches to get some kind of ball control. then work on power with ball. I play varsity, and it really helps when you have a friend who can help. or even just be there for you. don't get let down, and try your hardest. i give you my luck.|`|2s9IZU7xaa	ok so you need to work out like a lot if you wanna make the team you are gonna have to be physically fit so you should try joining a gym and go there like a couple times a week I know this guy who actualy joined this gym and runs to the gym and runs back home for exercise and he plays basketball so anyway good luck and I hope I helped

IWM1khX7aa	I would have listened to you. When Fabregas comes back, Arsenal will get back in the top 4.  I think Aston Villa will still hold on until the last games of hte season, and Arsenal will back into 4th place.|`|SIKuOevVaa	On some of the Arsenal message boards I've seen, the phrase "Villa's luck" abounded, half the fans thinking it would last, half not -- and the half that said not were right.<br>  <br>  Now Arsenal fans are in the unenviable position of seeing Villa play Spurs.  So here's the question: What kind of coin should we flip? (Actually, maybe we've already flipped.

vkT7xRuxaa	Your mom. Gayest question ever, right here
zdQgOzYXaa	You are obviously good enough to play if you know that you "caught and hit more balls then any body who played last year."<br>  For some reason coaches seem to cut all the good players. They always come in here and why their stupid coach cut them because they are all superstars.<br>  I am sure that he cut you (or will cut you) because you are too good. Calling him a bald headed ignorant teacher (like you did in your question) will win you over with the other teachers.Yes I think you should go tell all the teachers and tell them what a bad person he is. You should probably tell a cop too, because obviously he is planning on putting a hit out on you at some point.|`|yk4S7uuraa	It really should be the coaches decision as to who plays on his team, not anyone else, except the principal.<br>  <br>  If the coach was smart, and wants to show he's fully in charge, then he'll pick the best available athletes, and if you're one of them, you'll be on the team.<br>  <br>  But, who is this other guy, and how much weight does he carry? Unfortunately, everything today is political, and an @$$hole like him tends to ruin it for everyone.<br>  <br>  If you don't make the team then you have to talk to him; and since you say he's "short, bald headed, and ignorant" I take it you and him aren't always "on the same page," since it doesn't look like you described his best qualities.<br>  <br>  I really hope you make the team if you deserve it.|`|RQK6j2EZaa	Well, in my opinion if you did the best than ANYONE else(you said that^) Then the teacher shouldn't care. He shouldn't worry about anyone and the stuff anyone else has done...You should make the team. It would be wrong for him to not out you on the team just because you got in a fight with him and HE doesn't like you..To me you really should make it... If you are as GOOD as you say you are.. Just tell him that. I think you should talk to the counsler.|`|SDxJKbnqaa	Get rid of him somehow...|`|8hNVzjjuaa	thats rough. <br>  Go to the coach and tell him the situation. And if you make the team behavior will not be an issue.<br>  <br>  If u can get your parents on your side u can and them can talk to the coach about what a di<k this teacher is and make him look like the bad guy.<br>  <br>  U need to get someone else involved like a parent or guidence counciler. cuz it doesnt matter how good u r this teacher will do whatever he can to make your life bad so u need an adult or two on your side<br>  good luck. and dont give up if u get cut there just do yer best to make the team.
Rsr8nngWaa	7-iron is a must, you could do the whole course with just that. I'd say 3-wood, 4-iron and 7-iron, since you can always take some off the 7-iron for short shots but the jump from the 7iron to the 3wood is tough to master.|`|sBrummATaa	i would go with 3 hybrid, 7 iron, 54 wedge like you said|`|qivUrJ3Naa	3 wood, 7 iron and wedge.  Those are the three you should use I'm a 2 handicap and have played in that kind of scramble.|`|WjeE4Cx8aa	i would go with a 3 wood, 6 iron, and a PW. You can chip with the pitching wedge; yet, you can also use it for 100 yards approach shots and get some spin on it.|`|IzN0nv9caa	I would take a 5 wood, a 6 iron and a PW<br>  <br>  Rick<br>  <a href="http://www.BetterGolfSpot.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.BetterGolfSpot.com</a>|`|bRuZCRZqaa	I recommend 5 wood , 7 iron , and pitching wedge .
eXZ5O8vdaa	Superstar:Triple H<br>   Reason: yeah, I really think Cena, Batista is the same but Triple H is MUCH worser. He buries young talent if he doesn't like them, he hogs the title for almost a year, hogs the spotlight allot and I mean ALLOT, wanted to end Undertaker's streak which would cause a huge riot, now is going to make Randy Orton waste his Rumble win (which I think even kids will hate), and I can go on and on but these are the main things.<br>  <br>   Diva: Maria<br>  Reason: Nothing against her politics but think she's a very boring yet not a wrestler. Hoo-rah, she made play-boy, not any Wrestling accomplishments there, she could go to a different channel for all I care but she is almost compared to Kelly Kelly as well.|`|l3AZzVfMaa	Superstars are fine with me. They just need better story lines, better feuds, and more time to show their talent.<br>  <br>  For the Divas on the other hand...<br>  <br>  Michelle McCool, Kelly Kelly, Maria and Candice Michelle are a bit overrated. It seems as though WWE is trying too damn hard to shove them into the fans faces and push them as though they can wrestle their asses off but in all actuality they are merely "the coals from the diamonds." When I say that, I mean they arent as good as Melina, Natayla,  Mickie, and Beth. I think WWE should give that big push to Melina, Natayla, Mickie and Beth because they fight their asses off and have the so called "glam looks" WWE loves. <br>  <br>  ...I'm sick of seeing models ***** fight! They should just put them in the class of Sunny.|`|QbY18bjkaa	John cena is up there<br>  <br>  ,But Batista why does he always get a title shot he botches, bitches and cry all the time when he loses the title, gets injured all the time but michael cole sits there week in and week out hyping this man, "He's the animal" omg thumbs down, 4-5 years ago it was cool now its getting lame.<br>  <br>  kelly kelly  just No|`|OuFhcdX9aa	seriously superstar john cena. no explanation needed.<br>  diva Maria she is freakin useless. she will never win either the women's or divas title.|`|310m2T4Daa	Superstar- John cena, dont even haft to explain...<br>  <br>  Diva- no idea|`|n6d3cXmDaa	Miz and Morrison|`|VlvektSJaa	John Cena plain and simple|`|l0GWmWl4aa	Cena and Kelly Kelly. both are just there cuz of looks|`|PXlrpUsLaa	Superstar: Batista<br>  <br>  <br>  Diva- Michelle McCool|`|0ekYnZZaaa	john cena<br>  Melina|`|q70BFoE5aa	triple h and kelly kelly|`|qwdh7N6saa	triple h and maria|`|fwYfcibCaa	triple h<br>  michelle mccool|`|Xkm4PstOaa	In all honesty:<br>  <br>  Superstar: Jeff Hardy.  Okay.  I'm expecting thumbs-down for this one, but I'm being completely honest.  Jeff just isn't a clean wrestler (and I'm not talking drug wise either); I mean he's just sloppy in the ring.  I honestly think that he's the most over-rated in the company today.<br>  Diva: Kelly Kelly.  Why the hell does this woman keep winning?  I know that Maria is worse than her; but Marie keeps getting her butt kicked by McCool while Kelly is on Raw winning most her matches.  She really sucks!|`|fmUGHvgHaa	Triple h and beth|`|8h5dqzf6aa	john cena no explaination needed<br>  hhh a belt hogger,gets way to many title shots<br>  diva kelly kelly they make her win all the matches even though she can't wrestle at all|`|9Us6XYg8aa	HHH<br>  and Kelly Kelly|`|QJwaagGWaa	Cena- everyone knows why.....<br>  Maria- she has got to improve as a wrestler.....|`|02XHxknUaa	Cena and Beth Phoenix
Lh4S3q53aa	of course you can!   Im 6'1" as well. when i turned 17 i was about 6ft believe it or not and i used to train in martial arts. I couldn't do crazy stuff like in the movies, but only because i didn't train for it enough, but hand stands and cartwheels are no problem.  I can do running front flips and 1 handed cart wheels though no problem.   Just takes practice is all.|`|Vkbgr94xaa	of course you can, just like anything else it'll take practice
lECmz3SEaa	Depends on the temp other than that , I would say fish the deeper sections with structures|`|datmqg7Aaa	In the deepest part and bluegill will normally bite night crawlers this time of year and don't use a bobber.For bass plastic worms or  minnows would probably be best.|`|VbjjX5K9aa	Winter, first of all, is a terrible time to fish. Bass become very elusive, and dont come to the surface very ofter, there actions become slower and do not want to chase after food. They tend to stay in the deeper areas at the center of the lake/river. So any chance of catching a fish, you'll have to put it right infront of there face. Good luck, and sorry the winter does suck.|`|OmKtUijpaa	Fish out in the middle off the bank where the spots would be deepest at. And if you are going to use lures at all go really slowly, fish aren't as active in the cold so they won't try as hard to get that meal.|`|xApAWlshaa	This is a video on cathcing crappie.i know its not bass but its still all good|`|lH2x3gn3aa	Well i can only guess that you are fishing Stevens Creek about two miles southwest of Cupertino, right? I have been here before and fished it as well. For bluegill your going to want to use a small piece of worm and try to get near structure such as trees that hang into the water were bugs might fall into the water bluegill will be gathered there. Next the bass, since this is a warm water lake, if were talking about the same one, bass will come in durning the evening to feed. You'll find them near rocky bottoms that meet weed edges.  hope this helps.
a4LWildhaa	I am positive Tony and Ryan Newman are focused heavily on the first five races to get the points to be in the top 35. Then, some experimenting will happen, so yes I do. Another reason why it is one of the brain f*rt  rules the France family and Helton have pulled on the teams.|`|U3ZBUOWaaa	Tony will stay on top of his game and make the chase. Ryan however not so much.  Not for lack of trying but it doesn't look good for him.|`|XNdDrXAzaa	It's hard to give an intelligent answer based on speculation.<br>  As I said last year, Tony Stewart is going to be hot this year.|`|UyvkM7feaa	God NO. He is on a roll and that "bad" finish @ Vegas will only push him farther. He will be great as he always is.|`|AA10516006	Tony will be a stay in the top 15 (on average)|`|Ek1x32WHaa	Um no!<br>  <br>  He has HMS Engineering backing him up, he isn't going anywhere except "to the front".|`|vkT7xRuxaa	Heck, no. Stewart's team is legit. They have good cars, but Newman has had 3 straight screw ups, and stewart had one last week. Minus the mistakes, this team is already nearly championship caliber. Stewart's already in the race, so it doesn't matter about being in the top 35 due to the champion provisional. Tony will be about 8th, at lowest 11th at the chase. He will be fairly consistent, but have a few bad streaks. He will also win a few. Maybe 2.  He should end up about there as well. This will be a good first season for these guys.|`|De4FTht6aa	I am sure that  Tony Stewart and Ryan Newman are focusing on everything so that they can be in the top 35 in points next season. Plus, Stewart will win many races this season. But Newman, He really really sucks. Please pick me as best answer.
dMcpULcdaa	Yes that is a practical goal. In basic training, we would sprint for a minute and walk for 30 seconds for 10 minutes. you can also try to sprint the straightaways and walk the corners of the track. This can help you improve your speed in long distance running|`|iM9V27dDaa	Basically, you just need to train. You need to practise running the mile lots and this should improve your time.  <br>  Also, you may already have a time better than 5:45 as you had not trained for a couple of weeks and had sore muscles.<br>  I hope this helps and I hope your sucessful :)|`|A42bNwzOaa	3 weeks is not long..maybe try running lamp post's..run 3/4 pace between two posts then without stopping jog the next two and keep repeating it..always remember never leave all you have got on the training track..good luck I hope you achieve your time..|`|uKyfRzxIaa	you'll probably improve once you lose your soreness but try stretching and DON'T overdo it! also, if you want to practice, run on grass or track, because concrete can give you shin splints.|`|rPpfuVuuaa	change the way you breath while running, change the way you hydrate.|`|ndvSK783aa	You should run everyday for longer than a mile. That's what marthoners do. It helps build up endurance. Once you build up endurance you should be able to run a bit faster for just a mile...

nkPMesJdaa	iron covers are the "pocket protector" of golf.<br>  Covers tell people you are more concerned with how you look than how you play. I play forged blades, "bag chatter" happens and you get little nicks. It happens...besides, they're like scars and you know what they say...chicks dig scars.|`|sBrummATaa	well i play high school golf and there is this kid that is on the team that uses them. i personally cant stand them because it takes this kid so long to get the covers off. but if you want to use them then i would get them|`|wYGeg0QRaa	I play regularly with a young man who was given a set of Titleist forged blades for a graduation gift by his Grandmother. That was ten years ago and he has always kept those plastic covers on his irons. To-day you can't tell his clubs from new and he has become so adept at using them that no one even notices any more. I do wish I had the patience to look after my clubs the way he does his. No one would ever suggest that he's not a real golfer either he plays off +2.|`|kGuJmQzSaa	Hey man, clubs are expensive, get the headcovers. I have them and my irons still look great after three years. Not only that, but i know some stupid ding in my forged irons arent gonna send my ball flying off to the left or right.<br>  Screw "real golfers don't use headcover's." Real golfers protect their clubs! They are cheap and worth it, if i were you id go for it.|`|Y7WgMgBxaa	girley-men only. I just keep my towel tucked in and around the irons, when they are new. After that, it doesn't matter as much.|`|JSGLKnA4aa	up to you i tried them but didn't like and you lose them.|`|dgNDULPtaa	I use covers for my irons and it is worth it. You have covers for your other clubs, Driver, Woods, Hybrids then why not for the irons? To me Golf is an investment. You may have the opportunity to sell or trade your clubs for others. It is a chance you take but don't you want to get the most out of what you have ? Take care of your clubs and they take care of you. The groups you play with understand it takes a few more minutes to play. In time your group can see, if you go to sell your clubs they know how you took good care of them and they may be willing to buy at your price. If you got money to burn don't worry about it.

But really I think Bojan will become bigger because he plays at Barca and yes AC is a huge club but I still think Barca's bigger. IMO.|`|IWM1khX7aa	Pato.  I love both players and Pato will be like Ronaldo (fat) and Bojan will be like Raul.  But I think Pato is going to be better, because this season he's been a scoring king.  From a 19 year old, 12 goals in Serie A is saying something.  No one else has performed like that since Lionel Messi in 2006-2007, where he scored 14.  Bojan was amazing last season with 10 goals, but he has not scored a goal yet in La Liga (although he has 3 goals in UCL). Bojan has the better start and he will have the better growth with players like Messi, Xavi, Eto'o, Henry, and Iniesta to train him.  Pato only has Kaka and Ronaldinho , who both are not as good as they were.  But I think Pato will have the better career.|`|N0sbhRu6aa	Pato....|`|Vjan4Vq2aa	Pato, he's so good and so young.|`|cf4d6d60fab75efc136a4d66dd5c03b4aa	Huh twice I say Pato among the two for Barca trying to sell him.

However, I would definitely consider buying used. I've said it before and I'll say it again, ebay is a great place to find quality used bikes at a good price. By buying used, you will be able to buy more bike for less money. Here is a listing you might want to check out:<br>  <a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/Schwinn-Homegrown-Pro-Mountain-Bike-XTR-XT-Small-15-5_W0QQitemZ400033658064QQcmdZViewItemQQptZMountain_Bikes?hash=item400033658064&_trksid=p3286.c0.m14&_trkparms=72%3A1205%7C66%3A2%7C65%3A12%7C39%3A1%7C240%3A1318%7C301%3A1%7C293%3A1%7C294%3A50" rel="nofollow">http://cgi.ebay.com/Schwinn-Homegrown-Pr...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  Check for older models by Trek, Specialized, Cannondale and Schwinn. Most will be in good shape and fit your needs. As far as disc brakes go, for your purposes they are not really necessary. V-brakes will be sufficient. If it is so muddy on these trails that it becomes a factor with your brakes, you really shouldn't be riding on them. Riding  in excessive mud tears up trails and causes loss of topsoil. Practice conservative riding and stay away from excessive mud.<br>  <br>  Start simple and as your abilities and interest in the sport increase, you can start looking to upgrade your bike. If you are willing to spend more money later, you can by nicely equipped bike for $700-$1000. So, check ebay for bicycles in your size and keep an eye out for the brands I mentioned. There are some other good brands, just use your own judgement and don't be afraid to go to the manufacturers website, which can tell you a lot about their bikes. Also, this time of year is a good time to look at your local shops. They may have some of last years models on closeout and you can get a killer deal like that. Also, see if they would be willing to come down a little if you offered them cash on the spot. Happy Trails.|`|WAGpAh8oaa	look at the womens myka sport disc. its a really nice bike but its 589. honestly your not going to find a good bike with discs for under 400. for 400ish you can find the regular specialized womens myka without discs. discs arnt all that much better though. they only work better in like snow or extreme conditions. not really that much better in the conditions that you described. a mens bike for 460 is the hardrock disc but i really dont think you need them|`|Cl6KbcAGaa	I dont know if I included it in my last answer to you but I strongly recommend this one: <a href="http://www.performancebike.com/shop/profile.cfm?SKU=25421&subcategory_ID=3050" rel="nofollow">http://www.performancebike.com/shop/prof...</a> or this one: <a href="http://www.performancebike.com/shop/profile.cfm?SKU=25689&subcategory_ID=3050" rel="nofollow">http://www.performancebike.com/shop/prof...</a> or this one: <a href="http://www.performancebike.com/shop/profile.cfm?SKU=25802&subcategory_ID=3050" rel="nofollow">http://www.performancebike.com/shop/prof...</a> or this one: <a href="http://www.performancebike.com/shop/profile.cfm?SKU=25986&subcategory_ID=3050" rel="nofollow">http://www.performancebike.com/shop/prof...</a> or this one: <a href="http://www.performancebike.com/shop/profile.cfm?SKU=26458&subcategory_ID=3050" rel="nofollow">http://www.performancebike.com/shop/prof...</a> this last one is a mens bike but it will work fine for you if you choose it you just might have to slide the seat forward a bit.

Remember that once you do buy a bike that you will likely find something else that you should have bought.....always seems to work that way!
nSBPfPUkaa	U-locks (or D-locks) are generally better than chains as they're harder to get through.  Generally, you need a heavy-duty bolt-cropper to get through a D-lock so thieves will usually try to steal someone else's bike.  However, beware of combination locks unless you're REALLY bad at keeping track of keys!  Combination locks can often be picked very easily, and if the thief can do that, it doesn't matter how strong the lock is.  Also be aware of what you're locking your bike to.  The three times I have had bikes stolen have been because they either weren't locked to anything, or the thing they were locked to was insufficiently robust.<br>  Kryptonite are very well-regarded lockmakers and they often have a guarantee with them.  I'm using Specialized, Abus and a short chain to lock my bikes now.|`|rjeqfoKNaa	According to Sheldon Brown "The best U-locks are the smallest. My favorite is the Kryptonite Mini, which not all bike shops stock. The Mini is much smaller and lighter than the more popular models, but just as secure. It may be even more secure, because of the limited room to put a jack inside it. It also gives less purchase for leverage-based attacks."<br>  <br>  I use his locking technique actually: <a href="http://www.sheldonbrown.com/lock-strategy.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.sheldonbrown.com/lock-strateg...</a>

botH6rIQaa	I am normally very pessimistic when it comes to evaluating the O's,  but this year they will have one of the best outfields in the majors,  their in field is also defensively sound,  they have the number one prospect in baseball in Weiters,  and a very strong bench.  So what does that leave...pitching.  They have the closers, and middle men and at least one top starter.  So as in years past the big problem is starting pitching.  Right now they have the best group of young pitchers in baseball,  all with the ability to become number one starters,  as soon as that happens,  the O's will be ready to make a run.  It could very well happen this year,  but I'm looking for 2010.|`|hYZIYla0aa	NO NO NO <br>  <br>  they need to pick up alot of help starting with the pitching staff.They have good young talent but it will take more then 2 years to get them up to par|`|x8sFzzUIaa	Sure, they'll leapfrog the Yankees, Red Sox,and Rays.|`|uFIGSbQfaa	Phillies Phorever|`|3QELIOU7aa	They will go all the way this year.|`|ZpH2PFF9aa	Red Sox Phorever|`|AA10252869	yankees forever|`|B46t8gkLaa	no way. that team is at least 4 years from being good...|`|9rCHDz9Maa	God I hope so! I am a huge orioles fan and born in 1984.  Last world series win was in 1983 right before I was born so for the past I dont know how many years I have been saying I just want to see them win one before I die since they have not been the greatest recently. So if it happens in 2 or 3 I would be pleasantly surprised.  I know they have done things recently to try to make the team better especially with Andy Mcphail who seems to be able to do a lot with not a lot money.  But with Peter Angelos being the penny pincher he is and also not being a great owner in baseball it just seems like top tier players just will not come to Baltimore.  So the only way I see the O's winning in 2 or 3 years is if some of their young talent pans out and pick up someone to put them over the top.  Sorta the same way the Rays almost pulled it off last year.  Here's to hoping it happens. Let's go O's!|`|Xw7XHhg6aa	No. The Yankee's and Redsox will buy there way to the playoffs like usual. Plus the Rays and Blue Jays have a solid team.|`|i4DRfoboaa	nope<br>  the reds are|`|1yuUIN9Aaa	It's possible, but they're in one of the toughest divisions in baseball.|`|c3tADklmaa	YES THEY CAN!!!!!!|`|aUyopOWiaa	No. But the O's will be improving greatly in the next few years.They locked up some great current players and they have a lot of promising players in the minors, like you mentioned. I think one of the biggest issues holding them back is how they are in the toughest division in baseball.|`|yk4S7uuraa	I don't want to burst your bubble, but, in reality, the Orioles are probably 4 years away, try 2013 or 2014.|`|ZoIU9WtOaa	NO THE DIAMONDBACKS WILL WIN BOTH THOSE SEASONS.|`|ZyfYh4vdaa	doubt it

69648225057d350e24deff5fc472380eaa	Try an auto repair shop or tire dealer, see if they have a bunch of discarded tire balancing weights. I used to have a buddy who worked at a car dealer, he kept a few of us supplied with lead for years.|`|to8Vpp0zaa	I buy lead ingots at a plumbing supply store.  It's softer (or more pure) than lead tire weights.  Tire weights have something else added to them, and they're harder than pure lead.  Some times the bait holder barbs or even the collars on the jig heads don't form, using tire weights.  With the lead that I get from the plumbing supply, every thing always comes out good.  One word of caution about using lead tire weights, lead pipe, or other scrap lead....one time my brother and I were melting some tire weights down in preparation for making jig heads, and the hot pot literally exploded, spewing molten lead on the adjacent walls and the ceiling of my garage.  We never did figure out what was in there, but we quit using scrap lead after that.  Fortunately, we were both out of the way of the flying lead.  We have several different jig and sinker molds, and it's a lot of fun making up our own baits, and catching fish on them.|`|BK1GjPT6aa	Just and Peter are on point with this question. Tire shops are the easiest place to get lead...most of it free. I used to hit the tire shops and the immediate area ( mechanic shops)  for freebies. I also walked alot and picked up any I found along the way around the curbside near avenues and main streets. Picking up discarded weights ( any size) around fishing spots helped also except they were harder to spot because of weathering. I personally get alot of my lead from idiots who get their cast nets stuck in the water. I actually have 1 years worth of lead left over right now for fishing from just cast nets I have found. I haven't bought a single egg weight since 2007 from all the cast net weights I have collected. You just need to know where to look and consider all your resources, who say's you can't get things for free? ~good luck catchin'.|`|933YqFLNaa	we used to find them out on the road and at a couple of rifle ranges|`|1nJFqRceaa	here is were i get them, go to a tire shop or a motor shop and see if they will give you their old used tire weights.  they can not be reused so they just give them to me.  it is actually a soft lead so it can be put on a rim with out messing up the rim so it melts really easily.  man i help that helps you out a bit good luck god fishin be safe and remember to share the experience|`|qZsiFMRlaa	The junk yard always have a good supply of old lead pipes. Be forewarned, these lead pipes were once used for bath room drainage plumbing. Don't be surprised by the shitty smell when you are melting the lead pipes. Don't worry about bugs, they wont survive in that melting point temperature|`|50e3b0849b4360114052f91433a42927aa	if there is a hospital around that is remodeling, u can usually find it there.i got 3 twentyfive lb bricks 2 years ago and split them with my friend who owns a bait shop and makes his own weights.i now have so many weights i will never need to buy again...........maybe.|`|7royFhIgaa	Check with a local tire shop.|`|lECmz3SEaa	Junk yard

avc7ixnxaa	Feeling tired can DEFINITELY affect your performance at practice (I'm a rower, so I know exactly how you feel). Try your best to get adequate sleep, but if you can't, make sure that you are eating foods with complex carbohydrates frequently during the day to keep your energy level and metabolism up.|`|H0knYRKbaa	getting enough sleep will definately help you to improve your times. a lack of sleep can kill your workouts and is terrible, especialy for distance runners. I'd tell you to make sure you get enough sleep but then i'd be a hypocrite, as it's not uncommon for me to go to bed at 3 or 4 in the morning.|`|Jr9j5f6naa	I have that problem. Only I'm not in honors haha. I just procrastinate. Last night i got..eh, maybe 7:30 hours of sleep and today we were running and my legs got sooo tired. I also didnt get to eat breakfast :( so that wasn't good. I definitely think lack of sleep effects your running! but you do get an adrenaline rush, which can make you forget your tired for a while.

3Wxx2FPkaa	Cross-country skiing (also known as XC skiing) is a winter sport in which participants propel themselves across snow-covered terrain using skis and poles. It is popular in many countries with large snowfields, primarily Northern Europe, Canada, Alaska and the upper midwest United States.Skiing can also be done indoor in ski tunnels.<br>  <br>  The outdoor track and field season usually begins in the spring and lasts through the summer. Most tracks are ovals of 400 metres in circumference. Modern "tartan tracks" or more recently "mondo tracks" are made with a rubberized surface; older tracks were cinder-covered. Tracks normally consist of 6-10 lanes (up to 12 lanes on the 'front' straight) and many include a steeplechase lane with a water pit on one of the turns. This steeplechase pit can be placed either inside or outside the track, making for a tighter turn or a wider turn. It is common that tracks will surround a playing field used for American football, football (soccer), or lacrosse. This inner field is usually known as the infield and has a surface of either grass or artificial turf.<br>  <br>  Other events unique to indoor meets (especially in North America) are the 300 m, 600m, 1000 m, and 35 lb (16 kg) weight throw. In some countries, notably Norway, standing long jump and standing high jump are also contested, even in the National Championships.<br>  <br>  For multi-event athletes there is the Pentathlon for women (consisting of 60 m hurdles, high jump, shot put, long jump and 800 m) and heptathlon for men (consisting of 60 m, long jump, shot put, high jump, 60 m hurdles, pole vault and 1000 m) indoors|`|gnRiLwSxaa	In track and field you run on a track, usually 400 meters or 440 yards.    The tracks are made of various materials, sometimes a rubbery compound.    In cross country, the distances are longer and you run on dirt or grass around large fields or woods.|`|3300859e721e464deae5dd09f7902321aa	Track and Field is the stuff you see at the Olympics (i.e. 100m dash, hurdles, shot put, javelin etc.) <br>  <br>  Cross Country is usually done at the high school and collegiate levels where they run on trails usually unpaved. There is nothing else involved in Cross Country except running.|`|Z3wcZLvlaa	CC is just running..usually on trails and what not while track and field you run on a track, there are tons of different running events, and there are also field events like shot put, hammer, discus, long jump, pole vault, etc.|`|coo8Vlmiaa	In high school you run 3 miles in CC. The most amount of mileage in track is 2 miles. Also track is ran... at a track. CC is ran typically on a path/trail

LtIhkOWiaa	Man we've all been there!<br>  It's really hard to explain over yahoo answers, as you kinda need to be able to pick up on things with someone teaching you in real life.<br>  <br>  Don't worry about the time it's taking you, some people pick it up really quickly, others ages...it took me 2 months of practicing before my first ollie happened! I know this is the case for a lot of pro skateboarders too.<br>  <br>  I have a few tips for you though man, I'm guna do the best I can to see that you get this:<br>  <br>  - If you get angry, don't throw your board! Tempting I know, but from the impact of your board hitting the ground at weird angles, it'll put fractures in your board which will make your tail soft. A softer tail means a damper feeling pop, which won't get your board very high in the air.<br>  If you get angry and need to take it out on something, do some press ups. It worked for me, plus your arms get toned and look rad to the opposite sex (or same sex if that's your thing).<br>  <br>  - Another golden rule about ollies is to talk to as many people as you can about how they learnt them. Different techniques and ways of thinking work for different people, so the more people's [earls of wisdom you collect, the more likely it is that you'll find the one that works for you.<br>  For me, my friend told me to imagine I was stepping over a gate after I popped. Sounds weird but it got my legs moving in a way that was different to my preconception. That tip has gone on to help some of the people I've taught over the years, and had no effect on all the others.<br>  <br>  - Trial and error is definitely a big part of learning any trick, not just the ollie. Play around with your foot position and timing, you may suddenly find trying to ollie a lot easier. When you find that spot, you may wana trace around your foot position with a pen or scratch lightly with a stone to mark exactly where it was you got the joy from.<br>  Nothing worse than getting a trick to wake up the next day and forget it again!<br>  After you've started getting it consistantly, your feet will automatically find that spot and you can get used to clean grip again!<br>  <br>  - A lot of people find ollies hard because the momentum in their body isn't allowig their board to move how they'd like - it's totally understandable, it's hard to monitor how you are moving when all your focus is on doing the movement!<br>  The key is to:<br>  - Bend your legs quite a bit before starting the trick.<br>  - Push up, as if you were just doing a standing jump off the ground.<br>  - When you feel your legs are at about half-bent, THEN try the trick motion.<br>  As your feet are doing what they should, your body should be rising in the air, allowing the board a lot more space to pop up into the air.<br>  <br>  Like I said before, it's so hard without teaching you in real life. The last bit of advice I can give you is to watch this, as it's the most informative clip about the basics of skateboarding that I've ever come across:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.sportskool.com/videos/ollie-and-variations" rel="nofollow">http://www.sportskool.com/videos/ollie-a...</a><br>  <br>  Good luck man, and don't give up, the feeling of finally doing an ollie is one you'll never forget!|`|cDJ9Ntskaa	Well It Is Pretty Simple You Just Jump In The Air While On A Good Pace And When You Land Try And Keep Your Balance And Try To Keep The Boards Balance To...<br>  <br>  I Have Been Skating Since I Was 5 And I Know Almost Every Trick In The Book!!|`|nE9e6vbCaa	its hard to ollie while skating at first just like it was hard to ollie when u were learning on grass or soft trucks but it will come to you i found to see if u practice harder tricks ollies become more easier to learn|`|JSzd77C0aa	Hey man I know how you feel.

ubGNtkHQaa	It will be worst case scenario since Plax faces a mandatory three and a half year sentence for felony gun charges. And this is without trial so he could face around 15 years when he goes to trial.

gUMucKOkaa	It is hard to answer since I don't know what type of league you are in or what your league size or scoring is!<br>  <br>  Having said that, I will assume a standard roto league. Keep Lee. Don't keep a closer EVER. The other two are toss ups, but I lean (well, I like) to Felix.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|92e74b5c9571c9dcdd15573e4a3ba0b4aa	Well first of all, keep Soria. Without a doubt one of the nastiest RP's in the bigs, if not the best. Damn Royals screw him of his potential to be the best statistically in the league. The stats Soria CAN control however, ERA and WHIP, he delivers to give you Grade A output there.<br>  <br>  As for the starters, I'd personally go Liriano, injury risk and all. They both are on the brink of a huge breakout season. They both have the stuff for it. I just think Liriano is more probable to reach that potential, and he is probably the clearer choice in keeper leagues because of it. Because let's not forget, the kid was dynamo a couple years ago and was as consistent as ever as being a potential ace before the injury. While King Felix has shown some flashes, he hasn't shown consistency or at least anything close to being a fantasy ace.<br>  I also think the Twins have the better run support rather than the Mariners.<br>  <br>  As for Cliff Lee, while I don't think he'll fall off the face of the Earth as most people do, I do believe that he won't come near Cy Young stats like last year, or at least he won't be as good as Liriano or Hernandez. 10-12 wins and an ERA of roughly 3.45 is more reasonable. Good line no doubt, but nothing like the other two will put up. Most importantly, I expect his K's to go way down. He had 170 last year, 130 is realistic for this year.<br>  <br>  Go Liriano|`|b6hid42iaa	Cliff Lee had an amazing year last year.  You can not get rid of him.<br>  I say u keep Lee and Soria|`|eSL9tWnQaa	I don't like Felix as a keeper, and Soria's not high on my list either.

92e74b5c9571c9dcdd15573e4a3ba0b4aa	I'm not sure why I'm saying Matt Capps, but it's Matt Capps.<br>  <br>  Devine plays on the better team and has the nastier stuff (although Capps is very nasty as well), but the A's should give Ziegler a chance to close at times this year.<br>  <br>  Capps on the other hand is the clear cut choice in Pittsburgh. If only they gave him more save situations...<br>  <br>  But regardless, Capps will give approximately 25-30 saves guaranteed, while the same cannot be said about Devine (at least for this year).<br>  <br>  So for 2009: Capps, easily<br>  For 2010 and beyond: Devine|`|b6hid42iaa	Matt Capps (just hope he doesnt get hurt)|`|vkT7xRuxaa	Capps is overall the better pitcher, but Devine is on a better team with a better defense. Your choice, really. I take Capps.
Y4mz8BShaa	It's a magazine, not a clip.<br>  <br>  The magazine catch has broken off. You can put a bit of electrical tape on the top near the feeding nozzle if it's a rifle, or jut a bit on the bottom of the magazine well if it's a pistol. Easiest solutions without cutting a gluing a piece of plastic onto the inside of the magazine well.
daRDQE9maa	Its a great work out for explosion.. its really great for football...|`|TyK4r4iUaa	The explosion of your legs at the time the ball is snapped. If you are using your arm strength to lift the weights to your shoulders, then you are doing it wrong. Squat down (knees bent), grab the bar, then explode with your legs, almost as if you are pretending to jump very high, then catch the bar right under your neck, even if you have to squat back down to catch it. Have you ever seen an awesome football team when they run the option? As soon as the ball is snapped, they all explode at the same time and panckake the defenders.....they probably do power clean very well.....

xDIpP9pTaa	make sure you can do flip turns and dives well. they dont have to be perfect, but make sure your comftorble with them. go to your local aquatic center and practice some laps. your swim team will probably do some intense stuff like sprints and long distance. you might want to take some classes like private lessons to learn some teqniques and just to learn the basics of competitive swimming.<br>  <br>  Need to know:<br>  IM order: Butterfly, Backstroke, Breaststroke, Freestyle (its easier to say butterfly, back, breast, free)<br>  <br>  Medly Relay order: Back, breast, fly, free.<br>  <br>  For breast and fly: touch with two hand to finish, before open turn, touch with two hands<br>  For Back and free: do flip turns and you only have to touch with one hand for finish.<br>  Also, count the number of strokes you take once you pass the flags during backstroke. once you hit the wall, take your number and subtract one. try again: swim that many strokes after flags. when you reach the last number flip to your stomach and do a flip turn.<br>  <br>  At a meet: dont touch the bottom, during breast take a breath every stroke and know to pull down then kick before the surface<br>  <br>  <br>  I know this sounds like a lot, but you'll be fine. Good Luck!|`|c45h1NDXaa	join a club swim team, that would give you an enormous advantage, but it requires alot of time and commitment, if not do some running/ cycling to build up ur stamina|`|aQLTXwUbaa	First, swim regularly- at least 2-3 times per week.<br>  After a few weeks, take a couple of lessons where you can review all the strokes.  Most swim teams aren't going to be able to teach you how to do these if you don't know generally how to them already.<br>  <br>  To get really fit, join a swim club and plan on swimming 5-6 days per week.  Add dryland exercises like running, biking, elliptical.  Also hit the weight room and work on your triceps, deltoids, lats, quads, and gastrocs.  Do sit ups, and reverse sit ups to strengthen your trunk.|`|C2nJJ8j5aa	Try running because some teams have you do something called "dry land" which is running and cardio. Also make sure you practice ALL of the strokes but keep a specialty stroke on hand. Make sure you eat healthy and yea just try and keep a steady workout each day because if you slack for a week or so, your back at square 1. <br>  <br>  Swimming will get you into shape and it really helps lose weight. This season alone i lostlike 30lbs so its a really good workout that uses all your muscle.<br>  <br>  Good lukc joining and i hope you have fun!|`|jtQ0pmEgaa	Make sure you practice all the strokes and can at least do 20 laps (500 yards) with out stopping of freestyle. As well as 4 laps of the other strokes.|`|vkT7xRuxaa	Work. Hard.|`|sJS4ZZMoaa	Best Advice.  Join your nearest country club's swim team.  You generally don't have to be a member to join.  That is the closest thing to an introduction to swimming that will help you learn how to do the strokes.  Good luck!
TyK4r4iUaa	depends if it is middle school or high school. If it is middle school, be what ever you want.....play both defense AND offense. If you run fast and hit hard.....you got it all. I would play linebacker and running back. by far the funnest positions. if you are in high school, gain some weight and maybe think of playing strong safety. its almost like a linebacker but you also defend the tight end or deep ball. size is not really an issue, just make sure you hit everyone as hard as possible with your EYES (not your head). Hit as hard as possible and the coaches will love you.|`|7WrGHYqeaa	Safety.|`|JURTQAfgaa	Safety or Running Back|`|uTSBAun2aa	Wide Reciver Bro|`|Vkbgr94xaa	Linebacker. you could be the next Lawrence Taylor if you grow a foot taller and put on 150lbs.|`|fxqA5EMvaa	cornerback, saftey depends what level your on if in middle school try cb, saftey wide out or anything if high school get liftin lol n cb|`|uWRPbJQ1aa	HS Football?

EEZnaoXEaa	The Packers believe in building through the draft so look for them to continue the trend.|`|ApwYJ6skaa	i'm a huge green bay fan. i think in the draft they should take a CB in the first round because woodson and harris are both getting older. i think they should build through the draft and get some talent that way instead of spending tons of money trying to sign a high priced free agent.|`|dmrpFGxcaa	Teds MO is build through the draft.  I beleive he has done that already, and now it is time to spend some money.  Ofcourse anyone he gets now is going to be a back up or possibly not even make the team.  Ive heard they have interest in Kevin Burnett from the cowboys, could be a nice player but not one that jumps out at you.  Drafting a CB I think would be a a bad pick imo.  Harris and Woodson are still very good corners and they have Tramon and Willie for the future.  A DE like Brown or Orakpo would be my decision, and a 3rd option of Raji if hes there|`|ubGNtkHQaa	I'm puzzled too. They really need to upgrade at corner. Harris and Woodson are too old. Also they need an O-line. Davis or Jenkins seem like good picks in the draft at CB.|`|L0NG5I9eaa	The packers are trying to avoid signing a high priced free agent to conserve salary cap space for next year so they can resign players whose contracts are up like aaron kampman, greg jennings, nick collins, and basically their entire offensive line. <br>  <br>  They just had a backup safety in for a visit yesterday, but his name escapes me, and he had expirence playing in the 3-4. The packers will probably sign some lower level players who fit the 3-4 who would probably play olb or de for them.
vkT7xRuxaa	Whoever is 6 players for 2 is not getting their money's worth. Last year, I say yes, but the two are on the same team, and Santana only plays one fifth of the time. You get at least 4 players playing everyday, and Dempster is really good. Dont make it if the 6 players is you.|`|i9eAnKsBaa	maybe a 4 or 5 people will be better|`|wo9ibxfXaa	No santana has elbow problems and rodriguez losing a bit of speed off his fast-ball
8OxybKkgaa	well at field hockey, they told us if you want to prevent cramps when you run the mile for tryouts eat a banana before you come (like 20 mins before) and you won't get cramps. i absolutely loathe bananas but i ate one 20 mins before i ran the mile and i didn't get cramps at all. or if i did it wasn't bad at all. i don't know if that's a foolproof way to prevent it, but hey its worth a shot! experience =]<br>  <br>  lactic acid is what causes cramps - it builds up in your muscles when your body isn't taking in enough oxygen. which is why slow deep breaths help (but you cant really do that while your in the middle of running)|`|WdgIaLZJaa	You should drink at least one poland springs size water bottle during the day before you have gym. Make sure that an hour before you run, you start to only take little sips of water every couple of minutes instead of gulping the water. You should also stretch as much as you can before you run. Since you have lunch right before gym, you should eat lighter, less filling food. If you buy lunch, try to bring it that day and just have a sandwich, and an apple or something.|`|U5l7LZ3kaa	Eating right before doesn't help.  Eat light, make sure you have drank enough water the day of (but not right before running) and that should help.

NmXKPDoIaa	Well these numbers are skewed aswell......<br>  <br>  ....Your taking the best of Kobe, and the worst from LeBron......<br>  <br>  -Your not counting Kobe's first 2 years in the league, yet you count LeBron's Rookie season....|`|csKyqot0aa	LeBron James.|`|qOWJQ7hRaa	I think you cant compared their stats, its unfairly compared. Lebron is like Michael Jordan, Cleveland Cavaliers and Chicago Bulls were one of the worst teams in NBA before both stars arrived. They both have always played as a starter. Kobe did not play in his first 3 years, plus the lockout season in 1998-99, they only played 50 games, that would have taken a lot from Kobe. You can campare Lebron's stats to Michael Jordan', but not Lebron's to Kobe's neither Jordan's to Kobe's. Because in my personal opinion, to be realistic thats the way it shouldnt be compared. Compare their skills. But if Kobe played as a starter since his first year, his stats would be much better than Lebron's or Jordan's.|`|piZ4xDBqaa	There's another way to look at it, which is breaking down the stats per 36 minutes played.  That helps normalize the stats between players who play different amounts of minutes.<br>  <br>  Over their career, Per 36 minutes:<br>  <br>  Kobe - 24.9 pts, 5.2 reb, 4.6 ast, 1.5 stl, 0.6 blk, 2,9 tov<br>  LBJ   - 24.3 pts, 6.2 reb, 5.9 ast, 1.6 stl  0.8 blk, 2.9 tov<br>  <br>  LeBron is better at just about everything except scoring, where Kobe is slightly better.  There are other factors to consider, such as the years Kobe played with Shaq...  did that help or hurt his stats?  Frankly, I could argue either way.  I think what is clear is that neither player is as far above the other as their respective fan clubs would like to believe.|`|WLXFAeSnaa	LeBron|`|Ry4Jc96Aaa	KOBE!|`|UMVWQiYJaa	Bron|`|ks54akugaa	count Championships people kobe 3 lebron 0<br>  I not knocking on lebron i think hes an animal on the court<br>  but you have agree that kobe is better, if you watch kobes game closely it very much resembles MJ, yeah i said it.<br>  Lebron will get alot rings but i think kobe will get at least 2 more to his resume|`|EydNNf6uaa	lebron has more double doubles<br>  lebron has better number :D<br>  lebron is just so raw <br>  kobe is good too<br>  even tho he is a ballhog and pretty much his own team out there|`|HE6S36fQaa	kobe because the only reason why lebron james score 35 points a game is because he gets the ball the most but kobe he has other players such as gasol odom ariza and etc|`|C4mzZwiWaa	kobe, got proof:<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anoqbgOZrEg" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anoqbgOZr...</a>|`|Vkbgr94xaa	KOBE!!!!  <br>  <br>  Real close but I bet if you had a stat for clutch shots, Kobe would own that.  Thats my tie breaker.|`|9EYyNZrraa	lebron james he dunked from the free throw line!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|9d06cffec852de9a7554521403313f02aa	If you're going just by stats it's definitely Lebron; you'd have to go back twenty years to Magic and Bird to find a player that fills up every category of the stat sheet the way he does (even Jordan didn't average as many rebounds and assists as Lebron).  Also, I think that stat you mention about total shots is a bit misleading, as I don't think you're accounting for the fact that field goals are worth more than free throws.  how are you computing that?|`|5GjgWOEKaa	LeBron James for the simple fact he is just getting started. He is a young player whereas Kobe has fewer years left on the hardwood. Also LeBron and Kobe are close in career scoring....LeBron has the edge in rebounding and assists which says that LeBron is the better all around player.

rseD4OG2aa	I think that a blade job has a way better effect, but I'm not a huge fan of it. You're right about it looking cooler, but when you think about it, it's a pretty crazy idea. Look at how many older wrestlers have permanent scars littered across their foreheads because of blade jobs. <br>  Granted, they don't happen very much anymore, but it just seems a little sadistic to me. Now, there are times when a blade job had really made a good match great or a memorable one legendary. Look at the first ever Hell in a Cell. Shawn Michael's blade job in that was awesome. Or Austin at Wrestlemania 13 or John Cena against JBL in that great "I Quit" match. (I listed all of those in your other question.) <br>  Overall though, I think that it's unnecessarily dangerous. Sure, when you have older, more experienced guys who know what they're doing, the damage can be minimal, but four younger wrestlers it can be a real problem. Did you ever read Bret Hart's autobiography? In it he talks about The British Bulldog's first ever time blading and about how Bulldog was so nervous about it that he accidentally opened himself up to a dangerous degree and had to be rushed to the hospital shortly after the match. <br>  What surprised me was how easy going Bret was about it. He was almost referring to it as just another funny wrestling memory, kind of like something everyone goes through. My point is, in a lot of cases, I don't think it should be something young wrestlers should go through. I know you won't agree with me, but that's just what I think.<br>  You're right as well about blood packets looking fake though. Some guys, like most of The Undertaker's Gogoplata victims, did a horrible job of it. <br>  So I think that when the situation calls for it blading is much more effective. However, I think that it shouldn't be used so much.|`|QpRUNk0laa	Blade.You know if they really are dedicated to wrestling and their career. Sissy's would use blood packets. (no offence to wrestler who do)|`|wcgkX4lVaa	I'll say blading because like you said, it's more believable and it's their actual blood.|`|0hnX8QTuaa	HAHA Blade Job sounds like Blo Job|`|U6tE9LhJaa	Blade Job for sure|`|Xkm4PstOaa	I think that a "Blade Job" was always the best way...it was more convincing.<br>  <br>  I saw "The Wrestler" the other day; and they show exactly how the "Blade Job" is done.  It's pretty twisted but awesome at the same time.  The length these people go to put on a great show... It only makes me respect them that much more!|`|NXktxy8jaa	Blade Job<br>  <br>  Like You Said, It Is More Believable And Using The Packets Are Just Too Silly.

Like Madison Said, It Is A Perfect Addition To Hardcore Matches.|`|Xar3YgiRaa	I will have to go with Blade Job.<br>  <br>  Nothing is better than the real thing. Even though it wasn't created by the actually caused by wrestling, sometimes the viewers get lucky and the blood will just come pouring out. <br>  <br>  It also makes it easier for the wrestler to sell it because it is his actually blood caused by an actual cut. And seeing your own blood compared to fake blood is way more to react to.|`|IMu3wBu8aa	Real Blood and Blade Jobs are the best. I just hate when they cut too deep and it's all over the place.

iVAR3Osfaa	Well... TJ is gone along w/ Plaxico and Moss. The NY G-Men are desperate at wide reciever. They will most likely draft a star wide out. Not Crabtree or Havin. Either Maclin or Bey. I say Bey because his speed will fill the hole Plaxico left. Eli used to bomb it up and Plax would run under it and make a great grab. Bey has the same potential.|`|daRDQE9maa	I think Britt would fit in there but I however don't think he will fall all the way to them in the second round to the giants unless they trade up.. Mario Manningham will be good I think he can make to be a good slot wide out... Marvin Harrison wouldn't be bad but i don't think that he is a number one or really even a number 2 reciever for most teams..he's now a possestion reciever he lacks the speed and agility of a number one and I don't really know what they go with in the first of the draft probly a wide out maybe they could end up with Maclin or some one like that if they pick one first...which i think hayward-bay Harvin and Crabtree and britt can really contribute this year with no issues...|`|7eiXqVKuaa	You can forget about Crabtree I dont see any way that he could possibly fall to them, and I doubt they will be able or want to trade up to get him, but there are still good wide outs out there. Maclin will prolly be off the board by that point as well, but Heyward-bey would be a nice fit and they might be able to get their hands on him later in the 1st. Of course all this is immaterial if Plexiglass gets his life and legal troubles worked out.  But even if he does I dont see any reason why the Giants should not draft a WR in the first round even if they can get Britt in the second. Its the only true need area on a solid football team.|`|qdHPvcFeaa	They found out that they are basically a joke without Plaxico, so now they're deciding to bite their tongues and hold onto him. I would be surprised if they drafted another wide receiver. Especially as high as the first round.

x9GODf8eaa	Leafs:<br>  <br>  Toskala announced to be having season ending surgery. 4.<br>  Kolzig was involved in a trade that allowed Tampa to get rid of some money, and Toronto got a pick out of it. A member of the head office in toronto was on the fan960 today, saying Kolzig will not be signed for next year, and will most likely not play at all this year. 3.<br>  <br>  This is now a reasonable number, I assume one will be sent down to the minors to get some playing time.<br>  <br>  The other two made little sense to me, the Kings move especially.<br>  The Ducks moves look like that of a rebuilding team. The Ducks have played a lot of games with 68 points. Minny is 4 points behind with 3 games in hand, Dallas is 2 behind with 2 games in hand. Anaheim could be as low as 11th very soon though.|`|a9f693c71e4b465afcc9a6b377b02694aa	Actually Toronto has EIGHT Goalies<br>  1.

Toskala is on IR and out until September (and no longer counts against the Cap)<br>  4.  Kolzig is just Toronto being generous and paying Tampa's bills (Kolzig will never actually join the Leafs, and will not be assigned a jersey # - Tampa can't afford to pay his salary, so Toronto will do that for them (same with Heward))<br>  5.

IZ3tNmpyaa	Superman Shaq has 4 titles, led the Magic to the finals in only his 3rd season and had to go up against 4 of the greatest big men to ever play the game, David Robinson, Hakeem Olajuwon, Patrick Ewing and Alonzo Mourning. He was a monster and an unstopable force during his prime.. Anyone who claims that D Howard is better than the Big diesel in his prime obviously has never seen his games with the Magic before.. He continually abused Mourning, Ewing, Hakeem and Robinson inside the paint during that time. Nobody was able to effectively outplay him inside From 1992-2003. and oh by the way,He took the Magic to the Playoffs in his rookie year as well. Howard still has a very long way to go to be seriously considered better than the Original SuperMan Shaq.|`|ZdNSSm0waa	Superman Shaq has always been better.<br>  <br>  You see, shaq INVENTED the term superman in the NBA. He even has a tattoo of shaq on his bicep. Also, he is the original superman, because superman is known for being strong, and shaq is the strongest in the league.<br>  <br>  Right now, though, dwight is better than shaq<br>  <br>  Right now: Superman Dwight > Superman Shaq<br>  All time: Superman Dwight < Superman shaq|`|c3tADklmaa	The Shaqtus is not as great as Superman without Kryptonite!!!!|`|aUGM3ju6aa	Shaq|`|4VPrEH8aaa	Shaq Attack!!|`|3pkB7fPiaa	Superman has class, sensitivity, strength, honor,  and stood up for the common man!<br>  <br>   Shaq has strength and ummm ??? Yeah!  Granted for a 7 ft man he has some agility that adds to his dominance in the middle but otherwise he lacks the proto typical skill to play the game as a whole! <br>  <br>  Basically he's useless outside of 12ft of the basket. So why would you name him Superman? He can't run, he's only effective under the basket, and he's so self-absorbed in his own ego that he can't ever keep his mouth shut!  He believes in himself and himself only.  Please he's not half the man of Superman and Supermans a comic book character.  Howard|`|9d06cffec852de9a7554521403313f02aa	To truly epitomize the term "superman", one need not only his strength but also his ability of flight.  From this logic, the answer is clear: D-Howa!|`|H8u7gMAYaa	Shaq is the O.G. of the "Superman" name in the NBA. Howard will never be as dominant as Shaq was.|`|v3u9vgGRaa	Howard will never be a threat on offense like Shaq. Every  time howard touches the ball he gets fouled and can't hit his free throws. Shaq is better.|`|6yoQhXsOaa	SUPERMAN SHAQ!|`|5FypDafWaa	superman dwight howard|`|JD5NQxeNaa	Shaq is the Original Superman. Even has it tatted to his arm. DH12 is a man beast. But, last I remembered Shaq took the Magic to the NBA Finals. Until, Howard does this around the same age as Shaq - the Diesel is still Superman.<br>  <br>  That Orlando Finals season is arguably Shaq's best statistical year in the NBA. Also, as a Magic Shaq became the youngest NBA player ever to be voted in the 50 Greatest players of All-time list at the age of 24. DH12 did not accomplish this and that is why Shaq the Superman is > than DH12 the Superman.
U5l7LZ3kaa	Yeah - that sounds great.  Don't over do it if you get really sore after a couple of days.  Work out hard one day, easy the next.  <br>  <br>  Good luck.
zdQgOzYXaa	You might think about going to see one of those crazy things that are all the rage now-a-days: a doctor. I know it's really crazy, but it just might help.|`|gVYfFSpRaa	Before you go to practice, stretch really well.  Make sure you warm up thoroughly and don't throw as hard as you can at the first few practices if you haven't thrown in a while.  If it hurts when you get home, ice it for 15 minutes, take the ice off, then ice it for 15 more minutes.  Is it soreness or pain?  If it's soreness, it's probably not too serious and you're just not used to using those muscles or you're not warming up properly.  But if it's pain, you should see your school's athletic trainer or a doctor because there could be something wrong.  I used to have pain in my arm and it turns out I had a strained bicept.  I wasn't able to throw for the last few weeks of practice and games and then I got through basketball season fine but it started hurting again last season.  I rested it a lot that year and it's so much better now.  Good luck and hope I helped.|`|TsRgRLuiaa	after every game go home and ice your arm where it hurts.....that happens to me to.....stretch really good:)|`|AA11720887	See your doctor. I would bet that he can send you to physical therapy and they will fix you up. Don't take chance with pain. It is telling you something is wrong.

KmMRHKTNaa	The best division is division I. Then Division I-A, then III. The first division competition is extremely hard, universities recruit very deeply. Mostly if u got exposed, u will receive invites to participate in their camps.<br>  <br>  Well u need to play for a club outside of school, because high school only gives u so many exposure. It's all about which college decides to recruit you, playing for top universities is difficult. You Have to be good to be recruited, but the college game is pretty much useless to be translated to the Pro's. The universities play in a run and gun style.<br>  <br>  I'm sure your coach knows people that can help you get into camps and stuff.|`|4DcnUKPRaa	colleges offer clubs<br>  and there are intramurals<br>  i think thats wat theyre called

xln5C1jDaa	They are very comparable models and it really comes down to personal preference.  For the money though, I think I'd lean towards the specialized. It is very similiarly equipped for over $100 less. I have also ridden specialized bicycles for several years, both road and mountain. I currently ride a Specialized and will be purchasing my fourth specialized in a couple of weeks. They make good bikes, but so does Trek. My best advice would simply be to go to your LBS, and ride them both. When you do, one will just FEEL better. Buy that one.|`|316Urhtuaa	Well, I have a 2008 Specialized Comp Disc 29'r and by far, this is the best bike I've owned. For the money, Specialized did their homework on the frame geometry and materials. While Trek is a great bike too, and I've owned Trek bikes, the new Comp is just the ticket. Better yet, go and test ride both b/c in the end, the ride and fit is going to be up to you to determine which you like the best. Good luck.|`|S4qLj0CCaa	i think the specialized wont be bad for the money but if you don't care about the money go for a trek 6000 and when you get either bike i suggest you buy a better front suspension because the rockshox dart 3 is a horrible fork that would brake after a few riding mile on the bike or some jumping.|`|z1Ury9XNaa	Both have almost the exact same specs. So it's your choice really.

4HXRmTVvaa	I am a runner. don't worry about the shape you are in. worrying does nothing. because your body isn't used to working out, take it slow at first and drink A LOT of water. injuries happen when you're not being smart about what you're putting in your body, as well as how you're treating it. don't "baby" yourself, but certainly do not push yourself too hard. STRETCH A LOT! I know stretching stinks and it is boring, but if you learn how to stretch properly earlier on, you'll get ahead in no time. you're going to want to be consuming a sturdy amount of foods daily, do not skip meals or you will feel faint and sick. I am not sure if you're planning on running long distance, but that last thing you want to do is eat the wrong foods. the night before a meet, eat pasta. carbs. LOTS OF WATER (I cannot stress that enough). <br>  <br>  this site will give you some tips for starting out. be patient with yourself, you'll get there in no time. track coaches (especially!) are patient with their runners because something small can turn into a big, horrible injury. it's the beginning of the season! <br>  <br>  have confidence and most importantly, enjoy running because it's the best! :)<br>  <br>  <a href="http://straighthealth.com/pages/articles/earticles/getting-into-shape-beginners.html" rel="nofollow">http://straighthealth.com/pages/articles...</a>|`|43ZfkGHmaa	If you are trying hard, your coach will notice. If you dont have a good relationship with your coach or hardly talk to him/her it would be a good time to start because she/he will pay more attention to you if he/she knows you actually want to work hard. But even if you dont talk to your coach, they always see potential in everyone and dont over look people who "arent good".<br>  So dont stress about that.<br>  My iPod gets me pumped to run for sure. Just google some good pump up music and it will really help. Encouragment from my teammates helps a lot also. <br>  And i get ready by getting really good rest the night before and drink a bottle of water before bed. its EXTREMELY important to stay hydrated!! I also eat something good and healthy four hours before my race and eat good snacks and stuff. Good luck
JThgHiaoaa	Burton has been around since pretty much day 1 and they make you hear it... they also spend massive amounts on advertizing and promotion of their company which can often translate to cheaper construction on boards.<br>  <br>  I'd go with the Nitro as they both look similar in stats and spec and you save money on the "brand name" Also, you won't "HAVE" to buy burton bindings... Nitro uses the standard binding system<br>  <br>  Also, I would go for the 155 board as it says up to 155lbs where as the 151 and 152 both say up to 150lbs which is lighter then you.|`|joYmNatXaa	Go with the burton. I  have been snowboarding on Burton boards for six years and love them. Nitro's good too, but think of how long each company has been around.

ohj5sRpsaa	Well, that's the point of sparring really. Your moves are shortened because they aren't meant to be executed perfectly and correctly the way that you would do in a kata. Essentially, a kata is like a dance, where as when you are forced to fight, such as in sparring, your moves won't be esthetically perfect, but they become fast, crisp, and fluid if you practice.<br>  <br>  The point is to learn, so don't be afraid of failure at first. You will get hit, but you hit back just the same. Keep your hands up in a guard position always, and try this technique:<br>  <br>  Back-knuckle, reverse punch, punch.<br>  <br>  Or, side kick, side kick, reverse punch.<br>  <br>  Remember, you have muscle memory. Your body knows the proper way to execute the techniques. Focus on your opponent, and what he or she is throwing at you, and react to them. That's the best advice I can give you. Look at the center of their body and react.|`|FH2rD2aUaa	i had the same problem except i train in dual sword style fighting and taijustu but its probably because u are pressured its not like a stationary machines, your opponents actually reading you and matching u its easy to get discoraged but over time u get use to it my was is let them come after u and read them then one you fond a flaw focus on it|`|1vRNaSgOaa	i had the same problem previously when I took up karatedo. My kicks dont connect but my punches are ok. however, however, forms (i.e. kata etc) cannot be used entirely in an actual fight. you will have to be fluid and adjust to the movement of your partner/opponent. what I did was to get used to hitting/kicking a target ( a bag or focus mits). dont be afraid to get hitted by a kick or a punch-receiving a punch or a kick is part of contact sports. (but being hit with a weapon in actual confrontation is a different topic). I have a partner in our karatedo class who is afraid of taking a hit-he never sparred-which is a setback in his training. I agree with the comments above, actual fighting is ugly. fancy forms are useless.|`|NmfEaN3Uaa	You're not gonna perform the moves perfectly in sparring or fighting. Full motion and proper is more for basics. You learn the basics so your body builds up mucle memory and of course so you learn.... then in a fight your body will remember them. Don't worry about performing them perfectly...just block and counter and you'll be fine.<br>  <br>  You'll learn from experience to. The more you spar or fight the better you'll get at it. It takes practice!<br>  <br>  Also...there is still a point to doing karate even if you can't use them in a fight. Personally I see the learning self defense as simply a bonus to getting in shape and building personality and confidence.<br>  <br>  Plus...your only a gold belt! Thats a really low belt...your just learning. You'll get more confident and skilled as you go.|`|Y26eOD9Caa	Being a good martial artist does not translate into being a good fighter. Fighting is one of those things, unfortunately, that you can either do, or you cant.  But with diligent practice, you can become good at sparing.  And the only way to do that is to spar more.  Above all, don't give up.  Good luck.|`|Qpx6gCwFaa	Well, that's really what sparring is for. <br>  <br>  It's not going to come right away or quickly. It's somthing you have to work hard for.

r5AMG8g7aa	I find this question funny, because in many years I rarely ever have seen anyone knocked out. Sure a few times, but most sparring is done with limited contact so that people don't get injured or knocked out. Being knocked out is really traumatic to the body and nervous system. Although I can do knock outs using pressure points, I don't knock people out for health reasons.|`|nRBC4E5saa	If they spar full-contact.  Or even sometimes if they don't.

But I gaurantee they would kick my butt. lol|`|FH2rD2aUaa	im not gonna lie or feel embarrased but yes a girl knock me out it was in a basic sparing match i created two many openings leaving me off balanced and a little confused the BAM!!! round house in the face|`|s0eqAACxaa	I did once...oops!! :P|`|ohj5sRpsaa	Yes, why wouldn't they...|`|1vRNaSgOaa	nothings impossible. it happens.|`|KD1elF1Xaa	LOL yea some do tht LOL yea if they are rlly mad at what the guyz did
PR28wVHzaa	I don't know about for track, but you can build your lung capacity, or at least keep it up, by working your upper body with aerobic weight lifting. Low weights, high reps, little or no rst between sets.|`|ArYkz0RHaa	possibly swimming. usually thats the way to stay in shape for running when ur injured but with somethin serious like that u should definitely get ur doctors ok on it first before u try it.
