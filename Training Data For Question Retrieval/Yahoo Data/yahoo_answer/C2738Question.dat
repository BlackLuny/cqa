Re asking for more thoughts and opinions.....Thanks      Ok I have always wanted a Rottie or German Shepherd but i cant have one cause Home owners insurance they said would go up.....I called our home owners insurance and it would go up if i had a rottie or german shepherd or chow chow or pit........so ya that sucks.....Im sure they would say the same with a doberman so what would be a good breed that would keep my kids and home safe not a drewler lol, but also not real high energy.....I want a dog that will be good with my kids, and keep them safe but when its time to just chill then cool. Want it to be a med. size to large size dog....breed.........any ideas???? Thanks

20090226193342AA0iObT	Pets;Dogs	There are darker reddish brown oval bugs on the head/ears of my dog, what are they?	When I was combing my dog I found that there were black specs, like dirt on the out side of my dogs ears. She  has been  itching a lot and her head was always tilted to the side and one of her eyes was damaged because of excessive scratching. When I went to  comb them out they came off but a closer look showed that there were reddish brown oval-like bugs on her.  We went to wash them off and they drowned pretty easily and the water turned blood red. We went to a vet with out the dog and he said that it was fleas but it is not fleas. We thought it might be mites but  we are not sure, currently we have put flea and tick stuff on her and we are taking her to a groomer this week , any suggestions or answers would be wonderful   ~thanks
20090226193812AA7qHeu	Pets;Fish	Dumb Angel FIsh (shakes head)?	So I got these angels in a community tank that paired off and look where they lay the eggs.  http://i659.photobucket.com/albums/uu313...       Don't they know all the fry are gonna get sucked into the filter as soon as they become belly whompers. I have about 8 breeding slates in that tank and they lay the eggs on the filter intake. I just thought that was funny, figured I would share it with you. Never had a pair lay eggs on the filter intake before.       Taking bets on how many of the fry make it to the tank bottom, closest to the actual number gets the 10 points. Should be about another day or so before they hatch.

20090226193707AAZaWyJ	Pets;Reptiles	Bearded dragon water.?	Im getting a bearded dragon soon, on the hot side of the terrarium i have the big heat lamp and on the cool side i have a smaller heat lamp, on the hot side i also have a peice of shale rock for him to bask on, and on the cool side i have a few plants including some lettus, and a waterfall i made out of a small aquarium filter (brand new filter, never used before) i took the filter out of the system so it does nothing to the water but make the waterfall, i want him to be able to drink the water in the pond, so i was wondering, do they drink regular chlorinated tap water or do i need to do something to the tap water first before giving it to him?

20090226193726AAC8soS	Pets;Horses	Is there a way to build a horses top line without having to work them?	This horse I'm bringing back to work has a very poor topline. It is part of his conformation, and since he was injured and lost all his muscle is is just super ugly to look at!!        He is very hard to work with because he is calm and lazy then BAM suddenly he has huge powerfull bucks or rears. So I'm not going to risk walking him on trails or anything like that until he is fully back to work and doesn't have all that extra energy.        So can the topline be built up at all without riding or longing exercises?

20090226195226AAF8Jz0	Pets;Dogs	To get or not get a 2nd dog?	Ok- so the darn Sarah McLachlan commercials are really tugging on my heartstrings!   We had 2 big dogs - a german shepherd, who lived to be 13 (put her down last January) and a lab mix who was 11 - had to have him put down 2 months after the shepherd (bone cancer).  I honestly didn't expect to EVER want dogs again after going through that, but of course once the sadness wore off, we rescued a Fox Terrier from the pound.   He is such a joy and my grandson (4 years) and him are best buddies - they both have enough energy to keep each other running all day long!  The past couple of weeks (thanks to those sad-eyed dogs on that commercial!!) I've been thinking of getting another dog.  I'd like another smaller one, but I know my hub would want a big one - I just dont want to deal with the landmine poops and food bills of a larger breed again.  It would of course be another rescue dog.  Things are just fine the way they are around here - this one is housebroken, trained fairly well and is starting to calm down a bit, yet I keep thinking we need another dog! Am I nuts???   I just can't stand the thought of innocent dogs being put down, and our yard and home are big enough for another dog so that's not the problem...(sorry for rambling!!!)  I guess I just need to be convinced one way or the other - anyone else in the same situation??  ACK!!!
20090226195001AAOpmud	Pets;Horses	How much should I expect to spend?	On an Arabian broodmare with a great pedigree? The mare doesn't have to be broken, just suited and proven a great mother with a respectable pedigree that can produce great lineage foals. How much should a good one be on average?      Also, how much would a great Arabian stallion cost? One that has a great pedigree also and has done some showing whether it be in stallion futurities or in actual shows. One who produces great foals, not just average ones.      I have no clue about the broodmare, but would assume the stallion should be anywhere from $15-$30,000. Am I correct? Or off?      Thanks!      By the way, this isn't for now. It's for the future when I plan on owning my own Arabian breeding farm. I need to finish college first (becoming an equine vet/chiro) and plan on doing an internship program at Al-Marah Arabians. So don't slam me saying I'm a backyard breeder or I should know. Thanks again!

20090226194515AAUdJKi	Pets;Dogs	English Bulldog Puppies for adoption?	I'll get straight to the point.      There are three english bulldog puppies at the pound 12 weeks and they have been marked for being put down.  There's nothing wrong with them, I've seen them myself and the vet at the pound said they are in perfect health, no one around just likes English Bulldogs.  (I love all dogs.)      I am heavily considering adopting them, they will most certainly get a ton of attention from me.  (I work out of my home, they will hardly be left alone.)      The environment they will live in:      4 room apartment (pet allowed), lots of pillows everywhere (For some reason I just have lots of pillows).  The living room has two couches and a recliner, and a mounted wall TV.  The bedroom is just several mattresses stacked on top of each other.  I keep the place relatively clean, just very cluttered with things like pillows and blankets.  If they want to (a question I would like answered if dogs sleep in the same bed usually) they would be allowed to sleep with me, I just need to make arrangements for that.      I've got a room that really isn't used that I can also set up, it is so far going to be used for feeding and dog toy storage,etc.      The rooms themself are actually *pretty* big, so they won't be too confined.  I just really don't see them getting outside ALOT, like I'll take them walking probably at least once a day, the rest would be playing inside.      I have a ton of money for vet bills, etc.  My job pays quite well, plus lets me stay home with them.      Are English Bulldogs good for this lifestyle?

She eats a high quality indoor cat food.(purena pro plan), and canned 1nce a week(same brand) She sheds like crazy for as long as I have had her.(4 years) she also always has had dandruff. Her ears always have ear wax. last year she used to scratch her ears to the point that she would cut them with her nails. this year i clean them every day, so she hasn't cut herself.  She is not a friendly cat, but allows only me around her, and hides when any one comes over. occasionally she will bite or scratch me when im petting her. I have attempted to bathe her once, but clawed me very bad as soon as water touched her. I have tried to take her to the vet, but they have never been able to put a hand on her because she always tries to attack them. They refuse to see her.

20090226195525AABP2zT	Pets;Rodents	Do you think my hamster is going to die? :(?	Abu ("Hammy") has had a couple of eye problems over the past few months, and we've just used some sterile baby medicine to wipe it off. But it came back a couple of days ago and hasn't gone away. Now Abu is sleeping on the bottom of his cage instead of in the wheel, where he usually sleeps. He's not running around much and it's quite possible that he has wet tail. I checked everywhere in his bedding, and it's all clean and dry.    So now he's cuddled up in a ball in the corner. I've given him his favorite treats and some fluff. He grabbed the treats as soon as I put them in his cage and started slowly eating them. He's moving the fluff around for a nice bed and ripping it apart with his teeth, but he's doing it very slowly. And you can feel every one of his little hammy bones. :( :( he's always been pretty chubby, so this was new to me and happened over about three days.       Do you think my hammy is going to die, or does he stand a good chance of recovery? He's about two and a half years old now, so I know it might be his time to go...but could I make him more comfortable? Should I take him to the vet? (I don't want to sound selfish, but it's not easy to find a hammy vet around here. It'll be about a four hour drive, and I'm not sure that it's good for him to be bounced around like that.)

We picked some up, and they actually liked me. They went back in their shell and hid for every other kid Heh!   So my parents are STILL deciding if I can get guinea pigs or not. So meanwhile- can I keep a wild snail as a pet? I'm pretty sure they'll say okay, and if they do, then what should I do, then? I can't find any more snails where I live anymore for some reason. They're all dead! They're just empty shells.      Do I put them in a cardboard box with airholes or something? (lol- yes, I know, a moist place, preferably a fish tank.

I put toys in his crate when i leave so he has something to do but i guess it doesn't seem to work. iv tried leaving him out of his crate but he ALWAYS finds something of mine to chew up even with LOTS of toys around the house so sadly until then hes staying in the crate.

It took her a while to finally swallow the thing, but she eventually did. I can sort of see a dark bump in her stomach, and I was wondering if this was just normal for a leo? Should she not be eating this size of cricket, or is it fine, since I think she's done it once before this (I put a big one in there, and the other one didn't wasn't interested in any food, so I think the little one ate it) and she seems to be fine?

20090226195915AApMGhD	Pets;Dogs	How much does veterinary surgery cost?	I recently found out that my 9 month old puppy(she is 20 lbs) has a problem with her front left paw that is going to require surgery.  The vet said that her growth plate closed and needs to be surgically reopened.  I was wondering if anyone could tell me--the approximate cost of the procedure?  rehabilitation/recovery requirements and time?  and if anyone has gone through this with a pet before?   Please any information you may have would be greatly appreciated!  Please keep my pup in your prayers.

If we adopt a dog and don't like it's original name, can we call it by a new name and expect it to recognize it easily?  Will the dog eventually forget its old name and respond to a new name or do dogs respond to any name you call it?  A lot of people seem to call their dog by a name and also a nickname or just "puppy" and it seems to respond.

They love people and act like they are princesses. Like my one cat, when shes in my room and she sees my hamster cage she wont even go at it. And sometimes, when she does because you know lots of cats are curious, I'll push her back gently and she'll go right back on the bed and sleep because she knows that means no. What are your cat or cats personalitys like? Oh, and I love animals so you could also mention your dog, bird, or whatever animal you have. My dogs are the best ever. Adorable, VERY smart, loyal, and everything above. I just got my dwarf hamster about almost 2 months ago. She looks like the size of cotton ball and is the smallest, most soft animal I've ever held. She loves to play and never bites like I've heard most people say they do but my hamster, nope, never bites and loves people!

He beats up on the cat, he bites all the time and sometimes aims for the face. Sometimes I know it's playing, and sometimes I'm not so sure.  He can be nice and when he's not in a rowdy mood he just wants to sit or lay down near me.  He's a yellow lab, which are supposed to be gentle and nice.  I don't think I'll get rid of him but I need a way to settle him down and get him to behave.

I've talked to a specialist and she said as long as symptoms don't worsen, then he should be fine.   *he's got material (cleaned 2 to 3 times a week) for bedding, switched from carefresh. he only sneezes when he's in my clothes, when he's outside, and when there's a strong smell, like when i'm doing the dishes. no runny nose and the sneezes seem to be only sniffs.

20090225122935AAMnw9p	Pets;Dogs	Is this normal, about a Chihuahua who just had puppies?	My Chihuahua Gabbie had babies last night, 3 of them. Everything went well, had a vet on stand-by just in case. The babies are healthy and nursing and Gabbie has eaten a bit and drank a lot of water.    My question is, she keeps whining very loudly if I go into the room, where her puppies are and then I leave. She follows me and whines like she wants me or something. I don't understand. She has NEVER been like that. She's always been kind of like the loner.   Is she just whining because she wants attention and want's me to be in there with her?? I'm thinking that's what it is, because it's only when I leave the room does she chase after me and whine.    I'm waiting on the vet to call me back right now, but I thought I'd go ahead and post this question.    Thanks.

Although the wife is from the west coast, Anyways, they have 2 dogs and 1 cat. When ever the dogs to something wrong, the first couple of warnings is mostly from the wife is yelling at the pets. However, if they and usually one of the dogs still does not listen and acts up like eating the cat food, the wife gets up, gets a wide belt and starts beating the dog on the stomach...over and over again. The dog cries in pain and fear. One time the dog ran away from her with his tail between his legs and she got him back into the other room ans started beating him again. She then picked up the dog from the back of the neck where the fat is and put him downstairs, it almost looked like she threw him down stairs. The husband is alot better, but I have seen him pick the Dog up and throw him across the room as well. After this happens, she sits back down like nothing happened at all and this was justified. Now granted a dog shouldnt eat another pet's food, but the dog does NOT deserve to be beaten!      Now I have been Always very kind to dogs and animals, I grew up with a dog, and couldn't do training with mine bc I did not like the trainer hitting my dog on the nose. When I am there, I get sick to my stomach and I want to do something, but I want to do something discreetly and without confrontation. Please help....      We reside in the State of NY.

I have a female Pomeranian Shih Tzu mix and a male purebred Shih Tzu.  My female was in heat about  2 weeks ago.  It seemed to be a very short heat cycle and it was her first cycle because she’s only a year. Well my male shih tzu has always tried to hump her and she refused but just near the end of her  very short cycle she finally allowed him to do so. They locked on February 8th and then they locked again the very next day! It’s been 2 weeks since the mating occurred. My female dog has been looking like she’s putting on weight and her nipples are bigger and there is a lump underneath them. I’ve been calling the vet and doing as much research as possible about pregnancy and dogs because I plan to have a career in the veterinarian field. I’m just a little confused about her being pregnant or experiencing a false pregnancy. It’s only been 2 weeks. Is it too soon for signs like bigger nipples, sleeping a lot, laziness, and slightly bigger belly? Please answer this and tell me what you guys think. Thank you so much!!                  ^^^^^ alot of poeple have been saying im a mean person and dumb person because my animals bred together. well it wasnt a planned pregnancy. dogs and dogs not humans. they dont always know whats best for them. there is no way i would ever hurt my dogs or harm her puppies. i know shes a little too young but im not an animal killer im not getting them aborted i love my dogs very much. and i dont think her pups are going to be abanded or neglected there for family members not for people in the paper. ive bought from people in the paper thats where the dad and mom are from i know the problems that come along with that and im gonna make sure her pups are safe and loved with people i know and trust.         thank you very much!!!

20090225123124AARPplV	Pets;Cats	What is going on with my cat?	Okay so my cat has been really gasy lately. She had worms a while ago(almost a month) and has been dewormed. She has this smell to her like she has an infection of some sort. She started bleeding from the bottom hole on her hind end. She's 2 1/2 years old and she's not fixed(I know I know....she's getting fixed as soon as we can get her done). She's been in heat before but she's never bled like this. She has gained weight since her last heat cycle but only like 7 pounds and she's know about 3 pounds over weight. What is going on? Is this normal or should the vet be visited. Also she has not done her usual howling like she does when she's in heat.

Hello:      Recently two of my mbunas, an Acei white tail, and a PS saulosi spitted their fry, as usual i separate the fry and place them in a small breeding tank like the one in the link inside my 55 gallon tank (which i use only for breeding purposes):       http://source-www.petco.com/assets/produ...       I keep them there until they can join the bigger fry. But this time the saulosi fry started to die one or two each day, they would go nuts swiming fast fast and then stopping and simply dying. What amazes me the most is that no white tail fry had died so far! and i feed them well, i watch that all of them eat.      I checked and double checked the water and there is no traces of amonia or nitrates, all the other fry is doing ok and i dont suffer any losses. Help pls?

20090226214830AA4gZaX	Pets;Dogs	Dog Bite Treatment Question...?	My mother decided to keep a stray pitbull few weeks ago and despite seeing what she is capable of INSISTS on keeping her, I tried to give her away twice b/f the worst could happen but my my mother was VERY angry with me and intervened. Anyways, she's an awful pet dirty, very destructive and my Rott (mix) can't stand her b/c she has NO manners and isn't trained at all and often does things to annoy her like sit on her or keep licking her ears or smack her with her tail. Anyways, they do NOT get along. Last week they got in a really really BAD fight. I had to help break it up b/c the Pit would NOT let go of my Rott and was clenched down on her gnashing her teeth w/ head shaking (there was blood). After we struggled to get them aparts...My Rott has two open wounds on her front leg, they're not closing they're   about the size of quarter and half dollar coins. They look pink and fleshy. I was PISSED when it happened   b/c my mother knows I can't really afford to vet her for serious matters right now. We know NOTHING about the stray pit. I know   I should take her (My Rott) to the vet, but 1. My Rott is a shelter pet that I adopted I'm scared of having her taken away. 2. Even   though I can't stand her AT ALL I don't want to have my mother's pit put down (although they are ILLEGAL   in my county state). What can I do to prevent infection? And about how much will it cost if I do take her to the vet?   The wounds don't look infected but I don't want them to get infected and don't like their fleshy/meaty appearance....

20090226215359AAmGyep	Pets;Dogs	Playing or fighting?   What are my dogs doing?	Here is a video       http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bW-qwkT2f...          I asked a question the other day about my dogs and it seems like everything escalates into a fight.    Well this is mild compared to usual and I think they are just playing....but I also got in and broke it up before it could become something.         this started when my poodle first got sick. And he is sick a lot. He has stomach issues....most likely pancreatitis but we are still looking into this. It seems when he has a flair up he is the worse....but he didn't start acting this way until he got sick he loved her until that....he even gets mean with us from time to time during a flair up      I figured I should probably let you know      Its seems our poodle is the instigator.....he is more high strung too.      Our JRT mix is laid back and go with the flow.....she normally ignores him but he gets persistant and she does nip at his feet when he starts at her.....he normally corners her but I get involved way before that now.      I always thought our poodle out of the two was more dominant but maybe is our JRT mix and maybe he is challenging her?      Or maybe they just don't get along?      My poodle is very posessive of his toys.....of course when we brought our JRT mix in (Sasha) Well Sasha within an hour ripped up every single on of Zackies (our poodle) toys. So he is very possessive of his toys now.      Our poodle doesn't like much attention unless its when he wants it.....and it seems the only time he wants it is when our Jrt mix is getting attention......now our JRT mix is a glory hound and an attention hog so if our poodle is getting attention she tends (being as big as she is) to just knock him out of the way......and we are working on that as well      when it gets out of hand and it hasn't been stopped quick enough he pins her down in the corner and continues to growl and nip at her and once seperated for a good 20 minutes after that she will keep her head down and act like she has been beaten or something....      Is this really play or is my poodle just being a jerk      It all starts off as play I think....but then it escalates to growling and jumping at each other...it usually starts by one or the other nipping the other ones back leg.      Our JRT mix will nip at our poodles feet but he will actually bite at her....but he doesn't leave any marks......he did bite her once and it left a mark on her shoulder.      And then I get on to them and I seperate them and after awhile they are the best of friends again....but this is happening all too often.      Normally our poodle will start it....he will go up to our JRT mix and start humping her or nipping at her.....and she will walk away and he just gets more persistent.      Our JRT mix will not bite our poodle though....she just wont so that is good. She is bigger and stronger than our poodle.      By the end of the day they are all happy, cuddly, and nuzzly or they are sitting at seperate ends of the apartment....depends on if they've made up. and depends on the day.         They both can get pretty jealous at times.      What is causing this?      Are the fighting?      Are they just playing rough?

20090226213325AAdSOu2	Pets;Dogs	My 2 y old used to sometimes pee on the floor when walking without noticing until he was done, but not now. Wh?	do you think that was?      He is now 3 years old. He is a Bichon Frise.  When I first adopted him, he was 2 years old. He used to drink water and eat his food and then when he'd walk away from the bowls he would pee on the floor a little but not notice until he was done, then he would act very ashamed.  After a few months he never did this anymore.  He also used to sometimes pee bloody urine but never does anymore.  I let him sleep over at his old owners house a few times  right after I adopted him and he would always come back peeing blood the next day. I took him to the vet but the blood would stop so she couldn't do anything. Now he never does. I feed him grain-free food. They fed him food with brown rice, it was premium, good stuff, Merrick's, but I wonder why this all stopped after I had him for a few months, could it have been the rice in the kibble that was causing problems in his urinary tract? What do you think? (my vet has no idea, but then she recommends purina.. ew)
20090226212331AAQ9YFB	Pets;Dogs	Best least expensive kibble, could you name some? I want super premium and human grade?	I'm fostering 2 dogs and the rescue organization gives really crappy stuff.

He's now capable of walk and trot, and we have worked on his ground manners in the past so he knows how to listen to my signals and body language etc.   Thanks heaps!

20090226202523AAGm9aW	Pets;Cats	Really deep and infected cat wound!?? Your thoughts?	well i already took action on it, but my cat has this really deep wound/hole right where her tail and butt connect,aprx. 1/2 inch deep,and wide(it looks like someone shot her). and when we discovered it it was infected really bad (a bunch of white stuff and pus was coming out of it). so we figured it has been there for maybe a couple days.  my family and i took action and got out as much of the infection as we could using peroxide, alcohol, soap & water, and first aid kit supplies   ): poor thing was in so much pain. we finished her up by taping a bandage on her, hopefully it'll stay on. the wound looks as if it'll need sewing(how??) and if we do that, we're going to need to knock her out(how??) or something because there's absolutely no way she will stay still. hopefully it wont become so bad to the point that she'll die.  we love our cat but we dont have the money to take her to a vet. what to do??      your thoughts,suggestions,directions, anything will help      please and thank you<3

They test all there dogs, provide health certificates, show there dogs all that good stuff. They are actually one of the best WGSD breeders around. Anyway i love there dogs, puppies and all. But i am clueless on this- ok well its 800$ for a pet quality WGS. Its 1,200.00$ for show quality and breeding rights. I get the breeding rights and that you can show them because there show quality i am not that stupid. But i want to know the difference of pet quality to Show quality? Are they better? Prettier? etc. I am just curious i have made me decision already thank you. Also it would be GREAT if you could provide a picture of a pet quality WGS and a Show quality WGS thank you.

I was thinking of changing the type of hackamore my horse has, but i don't know much about them and i wanted to hear some opinions. He originally came with a mechanical hackamore due to head tossing. Last summer he got into a habit of bolting and i switched to a bridle when he started ignoring the hackamore. We were back to a hackamore but i've recently just been riding with a halter. I just don't like how the mechanical hackamore fits and i don't like the look of it, or its fit.        Your opinions?

I had him in there but it was too late. The doors closed and it rode up to floor 12 and I couldn't get it to stop. The elevator is sometimes tempermental. My dog was pulled up to the top of the elevator and then his leash snapped. It is the most traumatic experience I have ever had being a animal lover and have had dogs all of my life. How do you get over something like that?       He's fine now, and got checked at the vet just incase. I think just very stressed and traumatized.
20090226212831AAlkQtM	Pets;Dogs	Chicken or Lamb dog food?	I have a Shepherd who is 18 months old. He is always itchy through out the winter months and some what in the spring/summer/fall months. He also has a hard time keeping weight on...the vet told me to try Science Diet...as much as I hate the food...i have already had him on it...he didnt even like it.      Here is a list I tried...he either has no hard stools or doesnt like the food.      Nutro, Wellness, Orijen, Dog Chow, Merrick and Nutrience.       I have tried RAW...but he still constantly scratches on it...and still stinks. So there is no point in keeping him on it      I have decided to put him on kirklands food. Should I go with the Chicken Formula or Lamb? The puppy formula they have is only available in chicken and I don't want to mix the formulas together as that will screw with his system. So Chicken or Lamb..please include reasons as to why you chose that formula...so I can base my judgment on that...Thanks...

I noticed that the cat fish suddenly disappeared from the tank one day. I cleaned the tank and searched for him but found no trace of him. Where did he go??? About two days later the black moor started to change color and died the next morning. Everyone I've asked said he must of ate the catfish or that the catfish jumped out the tank. I looked but did not find any sign of his body around the tank. The only other things in the tank were the filter, a cave mountain ornament (which I've checked inside and out), and rocks at the bottom. I also don't see how either gold fish could have eaten the catfish since their both not that big.

I read that is your fish swims up and down against the glass it is trying to get bubbles to breathe, but I have 3 air pumps in my tank. At the back of my 20 gallon tank, i have some air coming out against the wall, but only half of the stick works, then at the front on opposite sides i have an oyster that opens up to release air, and then i also have a small stone that puts up air. I have 2 dalmation mollies, 2 platies, one guppy [i had two but one died today for unknown reasons...anyone know why that might have happened? he wasn't really moving much for the past couple of days, and he liked staying up near the surface of the water] oh, and i have 4 baby fry, maybe 6. those were born about a week ago. my fish doesn't go up against the glass as much as it did, but it still does, and some of my fish just go up and stay at the surface for the water for like a half hour. should i be worried? oh, and my water got pretty cloudy water since the babies came in. my guess that the basteria is just trying to keep up with a sudden change in the bio load. oh, and that guppy that died was only in my tank since saturday. i feed them all brine shrimp, because they seem to eat it more than they did those flakes... i know i have to clean out my rocks soon, because those flakes are still at the bottom of the tank, but not very many...i am really new to fishing, so any advice and help would be GREATLY appreciated. thanks a bunch!

Ive offered him fuzzies and hoppers, hes about 18 inches long from nose to tail.  5 or so days ago his eyes got misty and his skin has been loking like he is going to shed.  Its alot looser, I think hes lost weight since I got him.  Hes used the bathroom (number 2) only once.  His eyes are no longer misty gray starting today but he hasnt really shed, but the skin looks more and more like it wants to come off.  He spends ALOT of time not moving much.  Its a small tank so the temp differential isnt normally large, usually about 78 on the one side and 85 on the other.  The humidity was about 30-40% but since his eyes turned misty Ive been misting his cage, gave him a bigger water bowl (that he never wuld go in, though he used to go in the smaller one) and Ive even tried soaking him.  Anyone know if this sounds like a problem?  Please let me know if you need more information

20090226212447AAgQrEF	Pets;Dogs	My dog became TERRIFIED of the floor, HELP!?	I need help here. My dog is a Doberman. She grew up in my house and shes been a very good dog, but shes developed a problem and i dont know how. Ive had her for 2 years and that is her age. Recently shes become petrified of the hardwood floor in my house. This makes for problems because she needs to cross it in order to go outside to pee. She is so scared that when shes on it her backlegs shake and she ends up slipping and freaking out so bad she hurries to the kitchen which is tile and more slick than the hardwood but she doesnt mind the tile. I dont see why shes scared all of a sudden. We used to play on the hardwood and shes run through it to go outside and she would jump up to catch things thrown, ALL while on the hardwood floor. Now she tries to avoid it. It is so hard to get her to go outside anymore and i just dont know what to do. She loves the living room and thats where she spends most of her time since she was born. So what can i do to make her favorite spot her favorite again? It just doesnt make sence. Shes even fine when i take her on frozen lakes and i can guarantee thats more slick than the hardwood.

The landlord lives in the upper floor of the house, my friend in the lower part. Per the lease, my friend is responsible for the small backyard her porch opens onto. She's allowed to have a dog, and up til now, she just let it out into the backyard to relieve itself and cleaned up accordingly. Now, the landlord claims that she has the right to "revoke the privilege" to use the backyard for the dog's business and wants my friend to walk her dog in the unlit, unmarked woods behind the property. The lease is totally on my friend's side....but does the landlord have any possible right to do this? She's in Connecticut, btw.

My mom loved Poodles, and we even a member of the Poodle Club (dog shows and everything, lol), but I never really knew for sure if they could be funny about one person in the family or not.  IMO, a dog should be a family dog, close with everyone.  If not Standards, what breed would you recommend?

I was curious though to if they considered my neighbors dogs around our home in their own yard which is divided by fences to be part of  their pack?  This goes for any dog.  For example if your dog is an outside dog and your neighbors dog is an outside dog and they are separated by a chain-link fence do they consider each other a pack? Even though they spend a large amount of time near one another, yet separated?  Also, what if your dog lets say meets at a dog park with 1 or 2 of the same dogs weekly do they consider those dogs to be part of their pack?  I'm just curious and would appreciate people opinion on this.

20090225124411AA5eMVx	Pets;Rodents	Getting rats and needing answers?	I am in college and we are allowed to house small animals in our dorms.  My roommate and I were planning on getting rats.  I have had pet rats before, but a while ago.  We were planning on getting two females so they could have someone to play with while we are in class.  I've already looked at cages that are safe and large enough for two rats.  I have also worked out transportation details to and from school during breaks and understand that they cannot be left with someone else for extended periods of time.  I am definitely willing to take on the responsibility.      Where is the best place to get them?  There is a pet store close to the college that breeds their own rats, but uses them mostly as feed.  Is this a safe place to buy them?  They are cheap here, about $3, which is really good for my college budget.  I had considered buying rats from local breeders, but they are much more expensive and if that is the case, we may only get one rat.      Also, when we get the rats, should we quarantine them?  There is a girl in our dorm who has a rat and I would feel horrible if we ended up killing it.  How would we go about doing something like that effectively?      Thanks!

When we first got him the vet told me to moisten them with a warm cloth, then put A&D on it. It helped a lot and the little pieces would pull right off. But then a day or two later they'd start again. Now that he's a little older he hates me touching his ears, so its not so easy to spend the ten minutes rubbing the cream in. I don't know what to do for him. I'm actually thinking about taking him to a groomer and having them shaved off, so maybe the hair can start to grow normally. Any suggestions? They're kinda hard to explain, but i hope some one understands what i mean.

20090225124226AAdK5gR	Pets;Cats	Need advice on fighting kittens?	So I have two kittens - both about 5 months old. They just met each other last night and I'm wondering if they are going to get along? I thought b/c they were kittens they would immediately like each other (lol, naive I know). I always had dogs and my pups loved everything at first sight. Once I had a problem with one of my senior dogs being mean to a pup, but about a month later they were inseparable.       Any who, they are both hissing and swatting at each other. If they're not swatting then the little girl is running away. Which is funny b/c she is the more aggressive out of the two. I've tried playing with both at the same time and it stops the hissing sometimes but when I'm not home I have no idea what they are doing, lol. So when I get home today should I assume they will be all buddy-buddy or still on sneak attack? Is the hissing and swatting playing and I'm just crazy?  LOL  It just doesn't seem like it b/c I know the little girl is really scared and the boy constantly follows her around (which is actually cute).       Does anyone have some advice on how to help them adjust to each other?? I figured if I just left them to it maybe in a few days they would start enjoying each other.
