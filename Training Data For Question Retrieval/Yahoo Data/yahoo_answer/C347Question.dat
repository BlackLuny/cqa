20090129083344AA763o8	Entertainment & Music;Music;Blues	Music Theory - Tonality - Chord Progressions?	I read in many places that modern music is written in I-IV-V chord progressions.  I have no idea what this means.  I'm just not seeing chords [arpeggios] in any of my fake books.  I can't even see them in twelve chord blues scales.  I understand that in the key of C in the Ionian mode, the I chord would be C E G, the IV chord would be F A C, and the V chord would be G B D.  I also understand that in the Ionian mode I ii  iii IV V vi vii would be used.  The lower cased roman numerals indicate that the first step between the root note and the second note is a three step interval out of a twelve step octave.  That would make ii = D F A, iii = E G B, vi = A C E, vii = B D F.  I understand that these would generally be minor chords in lower case with the exception of vii which would be diminished.  The upper case roman numerals indicate four steps between the root note and the next not, meaning a major chord.  Now these are all triads.  I understand that most people regard chords as every other note in a diatonic scale, triad or not.  Diatonic scale would mean seven tones picked out of a twelve tone octave.  I understand that a chord is named after it's root note, which is the lowest tone in the chord.  The first inversion of C E G would be E G C, and the second inversion would be G C E.        OK, that's what I know.  What I want to know is how to write music.  In almost all the melody patters I read in my fake books the successive notes are one step apart, not the two steps apart like in a chord [or arpeggio].  I'm not seeing I-IV-V chord progressions or any other chord progressions in any music I read.  Not in the bars or between the bars.  I'd like to write a simple melody.  How would I go about doing that?  Use I-IV-V as an example so I can see what people mean when they say that this progression is the basis for most modern music?  An internet citation would be nice!  How would I improvise using chord progressions?  That is to say, how would I choose which notes to play in a I-IV-V chord progression?

Ah, you're too meek ---      beautiful, unspoiled:      thus I'm so sad, I suffer---      and so happy, it hurts.         I want to hurt you      and destroy myself      What you would think      if you knew how I felt.         Would you simply smile,      not saying a word?      Even curses from your mouth      would be as beautiful as pearls.         I place my left hand on your      face as though we were to kiss.      Then I suddenly shove my thumb      deep into your eyesocket.      Abruptly, decisively,      like drilling a hole.         And what would it feel like?      Like jelly?      Trembling with ecstasy, I obscenely      mix it around and around: I must      taste the warmth of your blood.         How would you scream?      Would you shriek "It hurts!      It hurts!" as cinnabar-red tears      stream from your crushed eye?         You can't know the maddening      hunger I've felt in the midst of      our kisses, so many of them      I've lost count.         As though drinking in your cries,      I bring my hopes to fruition:      biting your tongue, shredding it,      biting at your lips as if tasting      your lipstick.         Oh, what euphoric heights I would      reach, having my desires fulfilled      like a greedy, gluttonous cur.         I longed, too, for your cherry-tinted      cheeks, tasty enough to bewitch my      tongue.      I would surely be healed,      and would cry like a child.         And how is your tender ear?      It brushes against my cheek;      I want it to creep up to my lips so      I can sink my teeth into its flesh.         Your left ear, always hearing words      whispered sweet as pie ---      I want it to hear my true feelings.      I never lied, no...      but I did have my secrets.         Ah, but what must you think of me?      Do you hate me? Are you afraid?      As though inviting you to the agony      at the play's end; if you wish, you      could destroy me --- I wouldn't care.         As you wish, you may destroy me      --- I wouldn't care."

There were three women competing in the recent Breast Stroke division of an English Channel swim, a brunette, a redhead and a blonde.    It was a fierce race with the brunette and the redhead exchanging the lead across the long stretch of water. As they stroked closer and closer to the shores of France, the blonde fell further behind.      Finally, the brunette came in first, with the redhead a close second. Everyone cheered and the two women congratulated each other on such a fine race. But the blonde swimmer was still nowhere to be seen.      Much, much  later, the blonde woman finally reached shore completely exhausted.       After being revived with blankets and coffee, she agreed to speak to the eager press.      "Can you please tell us what caused you to finish so far behind the other racers in today's race?" the first reporter asked.      The blonde shook her head, then remarked, "I don't want to complain, but I think those other two girls used their arms!"

20090129090429AAlunIf	Entertainment & Music;Movies	Title of a movie? About a music box?	It was made either in the 80's or 90's.      The main characters were an old lady, parents and a little girl. The movie starts out with the parents packing oxes because they're moving in with the old lady. The old lady lives in an old huge house in a small suburb.       While cleaning out the attic they find an old music box which plays a familiar tune. The music box had a huge significance in things. Towards the end of the film the Dad goes to the cemetery (to visit someone? I can't remember). The movie ends when the Old Lady dies.      I'm sorry I can't remember anymore details. It used to always play on TV and it was one of my favorite movies.

20090129091119AAaYVCb	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	Post-It Confetti all over my boss?	Last week was my boss' birthday. I spent 3 whole days at work cutting up all the office post-its with a pair of scissors. I had enough to fill up an entire gallon.       On his birthday I sneaked up behind him and dumped the entire gallon all over him (I made sure to swish it all through the air so they were flying around for a nice effect).       They went in his hair and eyes and mouth and clothes, in his bag, in his desk drawers, and even went into his computer. I guess the problems started when they went into the computer. The next day the computer started making strange noises and overheating, then a cloud of something came out the back, and the computer stopped working altogether. IT cannot fix it.      Now my company wants to garnish my wages to pay for the computer and they want me to clean up the mess (the cleaning people got mad when they saw it and refused to clean it up, WTH???) They are also saying that I wasted company time because I spent 3 days cutting up Post-Its instead of actually working & they want to take away 3 of my vacation days.      They have no right to do this to me!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I personally feel that this is my boss' fault, since he is my supervisor & he was clearly not supervising me at all. What can I do?

My supervisor seems so unimpressed with my work and my colleagues seem to be performing so much better than me . In addition to this my supervisor seems so unwilling to give me a help or teach me about the work . I find this so unfair .       The problem is that my contract with that company ends next week . They haven't said if they will renew my contract or not .. Even if I hate this job so much , I can't stay jobless . I need to find a new job before quitting this one . I have applied to so many jobs but got no job offer yet.      I feel so lost and would just love to find a job where I can be happy . I don't know if this is ever gonna happen .

20090129121031AAmuAm2	Entertainment & Music;Movies	I'm having trouble remembering the name of this movie, could you help?	I saw this movie probably 3 years ago. I'm not sure of the name, and I would really like to see it again.      It would probably be categorized under horror.      I only remember bits and pieces of it, sorry.      Here is what I remember:   I believe these people are at a party of some sort.    There are somewhere around 5 girls, and they end up each in separate rooms and different floors in a building. They must have been drunk or drugged because they don't know what is going on. They wake up with a metal cage like thing over their head. They feel around for a key on the floor and eventually unlock it.      A man, guy, boy? comes over a loud speaker I believe and says something to the effect of "This is a game, only one of you will make it out alive....5 levels, 5 girls" or something along those lines.       I'm not sure of the ending, but I'm pretty sure part way through two girls meet up and try and help one another. Every hour or something that guy comes on the loud speaker again and says that one has died. I want to say the two girls who met up saw a camera or something also.      Does anyone have any idea what movie this is? It might have been on Lifetime. I watched it with a friend and I have no idea what channel, or if it was on DVD or anything.

I know Jay has done it, and he has done everything except create a dance, yet when you ask most he has not sold out. Has Wayne sold out? The name of his company is Cash Money, which at least to me indicates he is in this for the money.

20090128092829AAc42fQ	Entertainment & Music;Music;R&B & Soul	What was know as Black music, now hip hop and rap, what happened?	How could you go from a Earth wind and fire, Marvin Gaye, Al Green, Barry white, Stevie wonder,etc, real artist, real bands to this? I mean Rock still has bands, it has change and branched out. Country is still country but has see some changes. But R&B is dead for the most part, The face of the black expression has been replaced by ghetto. And not all of us live in one. I mean you could be a poet, and express threw a music form called rap and that's okay. But so called Black music has changed from an art form with artist who wrote their own stuff, and play their own instruments, to a promotional gimmick.    You have classic rock, but classic R&B is called old school, which sounds disrespectful in it's self. I mean what is this generation going to call it's classics, are you going to sit your grand kids on your knee and play for them "whops there it is" are "who let the dogs out"? Or some song about a Ho?   Sampling and remakes, and some woman who can dance and sing and don't know the difference between a B flat and a C. If I'm just old fashion and not with the new style, I guess so. But if S---- D--- was in style I'd guess everyone would do that too. It's not an art form it's just entertainment. We have made ignorance fashionable.   Some body,convince me that I'm wrong in the way I see things.

20090225112911AABLyCd	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	Are these acai berry ads driving anyone else nuts?	I'm a frequent Internet user and I have never seen an ad campaign as comprehensive and omnipresent as these "I lost 25 pounds of stomach fat by following this simple golden rule", "as seen on Oprah and Rachael Ray", etc.  At least half the sites I visit (mostly news sites) have these ads on them.  Every time I ask a question on Yahoo Answers in the Diet and Fitness section, regardless of the topic, at least two people send me links to the same "mariasdietblog" sites.  Now I'm starting to get spam e-mails (I rarely get spam anymore) pitching the same stupid fad diet.      Acai berries are no healthier than cheaper, more common fruit.  The "one simple rule" claim is an outright lie...click on the link and it will advertise a colon cleansing, the aforementioned berries, and a subscription to some website offering diet advice.        Is anyone else sick to death of these stupid ads, and with ridiculous fad diet ads in general??      P.S. I'm going to be really amused if my mention of "acai berry" and "weight loss" sparks another few bots sending me ads disguised as friendly answers to this question.

Anyone else thinks he sounds like Marilyn Monroe - you know the airy, seductive, whispery talk? I was watching Caruso in NYPD Blue and he talked normal. He has a very nice voice, very sexy, so I don't know why he doesn't talk like he normally talks and not this whispery way. I saw a recept ep. of Miami where he was shouting instructions to Calleigh with choppers overhead and he sounded really good. Anyone else think/wonder this?

20090129115704AAHeaY0	Entertainment & Music;Television;Soap Operas	DAYS: Horton family tree (long)?	There are questions about who is related to who so I thought I'd try to clear up some of the questions.  The answers are based on my memory as well as articles at Wikipedia and the nbc site for the show.    TOM HORTON, the patriarch of the HORTON family.  Husband of ALICE HORTON (nee Grayson).  TOM was the Chief of Staff at Salem University Hospital for years.  TOM & ALICE have five children:    1-TOMMY-married KITTY, one daughter, SANDY.  TOMMY served in the Korean War and was wounded.  He had facial plastic surgery and found his way back to Salem but had amnesia.  He used the name Dr. MARK BROOKS until family members put the pieces together and realized that he was really TOMMY HORTON.  The character has been off the canvas and somewhere in the hospital for years.    2-ADDIE HORTON, married Ben Olson and had two children: daughter, JULIE and son, Steven.  JULIE, a troubled teenager, has a son, DAVID BANNING and a grandson, SCOTT BANNING.  SCOTT's mother was Trish Clayton.  Addie and her second husband, DOUG WILLIAMS, have a daughter, HOPE ALICE WILLIAMS.  After Addie's death, JULIE and DOUG married and raised HOPE together.   HOPE later married BO BRADY (her second husband) and they have three children together: SHAWN DOUGLAS BRADY, ZACH (deceased) and CIARRA.  HOPE has also befriended her step-daughter, CHELSEA, (whose mother is BILLIE REED, daughter of KATE ROBERTS) whom she considers her daugher.  Nothing is known of JULIE's brother, STEVEN, except that he is somewhere in Europe.    3-MICKEY-an attorney, first husband of LAURA HORTON, a psychiatrist.  Raised "son" MIKE HORTON as his son and it wasn't until Mike was a teenager did they find out that MIKE was really MICKEY's brother, BILL's son.  Married MAGGIE SIMMONS; Adopted MELISSA ANDERSON; adopted SARAH HORTON (Sarah's parents are Mickey's wife, Maggie & Neil Anderson);     4-BILL HORTON-after an affair with his brother's wife, LAURA, she became pregnant but never acknowledge that BILL was the baby's father.  After MICKEY married MAGGIE, BILL and LAURA married and had daughter JENNIFER.  LAURA was a patient at a mental institution for years.  MIKE later became a doctor and was involved with a string of women including Janice Barnes (who had also been involved with his father), ROBIN MYERS, with whom he had a son, JEREMY HORTON, and CARRIE BRADY.  Mike took over as Chief of Staff at the hospital when his grandfather, Tom Horton, died.  BILL & LAURA's daughter, JENNIFER, married JACK DEVEREUX and had two children: ABIGAIL AND JJ (Jack, Jr.)  JENNIFER and JACK are currently on assignment in London, England with their son, JJ.  Daughter ABIGAIL stayed behind in Salem.    5-MARIE-after an affair with ALEX MARSHALL, she had daughter, ANJELICA, but put her up for adopted.  MARIE entered the convent after discovering the man she was in love with was her brother, TOMMY.  He's had facial plastic surgery and amnesia and was going under the assuemd name, Dr. MARK BROOKS.      **I've forgotten a lot of information so I'll give you the website so you can read the information for yourself.

20090225114242AA7NlDe	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	I would really love some advice if anyone would be able to?	I would be so grateful i just have this situation and im not sure what i should do. I have known for a while that my boyfriend has a close female friend she calls him all the time and she sees him everyday at uni. It has always made me feel uneasy and tongiht after a lot of talking he confirmed to me what i always feared, he is in love with her. to hear it finally confirmed out loud is breaking my heart. i know him enough to believe that he has and never will cheat on me but it breaks my heart that he doesnt love me anymore. He says that he could never cope without having me around but i don't know if i can cope much longer i feel as though i literally am gonna be sick 99% of the time. He is also manic depressive i am scared to leave him totally because i am always afraid he will hurt himself as he has a tendency to do.and i dont want to see him sad, i dont want to leave him unless i know he is happy but it is killing me slowly. What would you guys do if u were me? I don't know what to do :(      Is there anyone who has had the same thing happen to them? What did you do when it happened to you?

20090128092031AAXmSg3	Entertainment & Music;Horoscopes	The Scorpio Man - Is this a normal behavior?	I have had an email/phone relationship with a Scorpio man for the last 4-5 years.  It has been completely platonic, with no real expectations of a relationship because of our locations in the US.  Recently, I had the opportunity to meet him in person, which was a completely random act - and we both hit if off incredibly well.  I know that it is the Scorpio nature to 'say what he means'.  He was completely taken by me and I with him, and by the end of our trip he was asking when I would be back to visit him since his profession minimizes the opportunity for travel.  I told him I would come see him in a couple of weeks, and he was agreeable to that.  He also mentioned that I was 'it' for him and I agreed that the feeling was mutual.  When I left all was good and I heard from him like I knew I should, and within a couple of days he fell sick.  I understand what he is going through because lol I think I gave him the flu I was just getting over :) anyway, it's been like a week, and while I know that Scorpios don't show weakness, could this be the reason that I barely hear from him now?  Does he see him being sick as a sign of weakness, and is holding off on talking with me until he is 100%?  I plan to go out to see him in like 10 days, and he won't even give me a response on if the trip we planned is going to work on his schedule.  He will text me at least once a day with no real answers, just telling me how miserable he is (poor baby) and once with he misses me too (in response to my text).  I would hate to go see him and he not even be available?  Should I give it a couple of more days, or should I just wait to hear from him?

Well remember the first episode of Alex Mack(The Accident) the girls agreed not to tell their parents about what had happened to Alex and they would keep it a secret,well the secret lasted a very very long time,I think they didn't do the right thing cause as Alex's dad George told Alex in the last episode of Alex Mack,he had enough information about GC-161 and Annie didn't have enough information and he could have stopped Ms.Atron a long time ago,but I LOVED every episode of the show,when I was little this was THE SHOW to watch if you were bord and had nothing to do,I wish God could give me powers like Alex,click here to watch episodes of the show,    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmu1nuyhJ...

20090128104559AADc4yU	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	Is this a good joke to tell anyone who is involved in politics?	"This year, taxpayers will receive an Economic Stimulus Payment. This is a very exciting new program that I will explain using the Q and A format:      Q. What is an Economic  Stimulus Payment?   A. It is money that the federal government will  send to taxpayers.      Q. Where will the government get this  money?   A. From taxpayers.      Q. So the government is  giving me back my own money?   A. Only a smidgen.      Q. What  is the purpose of this payment?   A. The plan is that you will use the money to purchase a high-definition TV Set, thus stimulating the economy.      Q. But isn't that stimulating the economy of China ?   A. Shut up.      Below is some helpful advice on how to best help the US economy by spending your stimulus check wisely:      If you spend that money at Wal-Mart, all the money will go to China.      If you spend it on gasoline it will go to the Arabs.   If you purchase a computer it will go to  India .   If you purchase fruit and vegetables it will go to Mexico, Honduras, and Guatemala (unless you buy organic).   If you buy a car it will go to Japan .   If you purchase useless crap it will go to Taiwan .   If you pay your credit cards off, it will go to bank management bonuses and they will hide it  offshore.  Same with stock investment.      Instead, you can keep the money in America by spending it at yard sales, going to a baseball game, or spending it on prostitutes, beer and wine (domestic ONLY), or tattoos, since those are the only American businesses still operating in the US.

"you know its true"? or is that too plain?)    then goes back to the chorus again...  so any tips, ideas or just ideas of what you consider romance... i am not yet satisfied with what i have made, i need more words to point out how "fairy tale", peaceable, romantic this girl is, although not un realistic, naieve, or gullable ya know.. please girls give me what your thoughts on romance is.. i hope i am not being too confusing with my question here.     also if you want to hear a sample of the song im making i can send a sample in a email if you want, but thats your choice, i know how some people are a little paranoid and safe, so i dont want to pry its only if you would like... thanks again all.
20090128102443AATvXEv	Entertainment & Music;Movies	Milk ... did you like the movie?	I didn't.      Of course Sean Penn's acting was outstanding as always. However, I thought the movie was extremely boring. It was only about Milk's campaign, and little about him as a person. It only touched on how his devotion to the campaign affected his relationships. I felt the movie was more about the Gay Rights Movement, rather than Harvey Milk himself, his mind and who he really was.    Secondly, I thought it really focused on gay men only. Rarely did we see a lesbian. There is one lesbian, but we never see her with a woman or anyway 'lesbian'     Thirdly, not all gay men are fairies. Alot of the acting was very over-camp.     Also, I wouldn't say Milk was 'assasinated' as the poster claims, he was mudered at work in my opinion, being shot by a co-worker is not assasination.       Other than that, is was okay. Anyone else got a view?
20090128095858AAdOrFT	Entertainment & Music;Television;Reality Television	DOI: Can anyone please tell me why Jessica Taylor is described as a "pop princess" and "singing sensation"?	I can well understand why Kylie Minogue is called a Pop Princess  - she's EARNED the title after a couple of decades in the business, mostly at the top. But Jessica Taylor? And please enlighten me as to how JT's suddenly become a "singing sensation"? Where are all the chart hits, then? Have I missed something? I'm not being nasty - I think she's a lovely girl and pretty good on the ice - just curious!

20090128113622AAQw6r0	Entertainment & Music;Celebrities	Why do people hate the Jonas Brothers so much?!?	I really want honest answers, not immature responses "because they're stupid" or "they're ugly."         And i would really like if you read this before you throw out your opinions:      - They did NOT start out as a Disney Band, they were signed to Colombia Records and decided to leave it.      - They are GOOD GUYS, with morals, values, and respect.      - They ALL play instruments, including guitar, piano, drums, tambourine, keyboard, and they all sing.      - OBVIOUSLY they have good music, or they wouldn't be up for a GRAMMY.      - OBVIOUSLY they're gorgeous or they wouldn't have won the teen choice award for Teen Hottie.       - They absolutely LOVE their fans, they just released a whole website (fanfamilyexperience.com) specifically to interact with their fans more.      - They've done concerts with all the Biggies of country, Brad Paisly, Tim McGraw, Faith Hill, etc.      - They met with Elvis Costello, and he loved them.         So, whats there left to "hate"? i'm just really curious. thanks.

If you are interested then answer this and email me if you want. We will arrange a day to make a quick interview. I also need suggestions and advice of where to find band members or advice for making a band, then feel free to answer this and let me know. Thank you.

Place: Sankt Ingbert  Latitude: 4916'48.19"N  Longitude: 7 7'4.19"E    Recently, we met up with a gemologist and he suggested my husband to wear a Hessonite (Gomedh) stone for greater health and prosperity. The gemologist gave us a Gomedh stone and blessed the stone.  The stone is not completely clear but does not have any particle inclusions.    Can an enlightened person throw some light on this. I just want to be very sure before I get this stone framed in ring for him to wear.    Thanks a lot.

20090128111406AA3ijAb	Entertainment & Music;Music;Other - Music	Audio Engineering : How do you add space to your overall mix ? to avoid that "in your face" feeling...?	I've been producing house music for a while now. and I also engineer my own tracks. I'm not entirely sure if what I'm talking about is stereo separation or just reverb applied during mastering.      But, I've been trying to figure out how to "push the mix back" so that it's not "in your face"...I've noticed particularly drums tend to be right in your face. so what i'm trying to do essentially is sink them in the mix and get a sense of space... if that makes any sense. p.s. Nothing's clashing everything's been EQ'd. So frequency wise everything has it's own place in the mix.      I've tried busing all my drums (Kick, percs hats etc) to one track and inserting a reverb plugin directly on that track.. no decay, no predelay, max diffusion and messed about with the high/low cut settings in an attempt to get a dry roomy effect and i also cut back on the dry signal a bit (vs. the wet/processed signal). but obviously that doesn't give me the results I'm looking for..      If you grab a pair of headphones and listen to Dennis Ferrer - 'Touch the sky' you might understand what I'm trying to get at. I realise the bongos/congas in that song have reverb applied to em but the mix as a whole sounds a little "pushed back" and spacious.      I'm sorry for the lengthy nature of the question..it's just that this thing's been bothering me for a long time now. Any suggestions no matter how "radical" are very much welcome at this point..lol..

We all know that Sonny, being Roman Catholic, is gonna be respectful of the Church (even if he doesn't wanna be).  And being an Italian mobster - and having the sentiments of protecting helpless women and children - will NOT whack a nun, LOL!  Even if it takes everything out of him!      I think he'll try to grab her and slam her against the church walls ... but he'll likely end up putting his FIST through the wall first!  Then he'll stalk out in disgust, swearing up and down he'll prove that she's faking.      He'll probably torment her for a good part of her life ... but if she plays it cool and sticks by her vows, he'll decide to move on ... eventually!      By the way ... what kind of a nun do you think Claudia will make?  What kind of a novice will she be ... will the Mother Superior see her as a troublemaker and try to kick her out?      And ... what will the separate reactions of Lulu, Carly, Kate, Johnny, Anthony, Trevor, Jason and Olivia be?

20090128123017AAFlR77	Entertainment & Music;Music;Other - Music	How can we handle this...?	My brother's band practices in our garage and they are usually in there from noon to 4.. sometimes a little bit later on the days of their shows. Most of the people in our neighborhood love to hear the music and think it's a great way for them to be spending their time...Yet there are a few old grumpy people that walk over to the house to yell at them for the "loud horrible noise" (My brother's band is awesome reggae/rock... not horrible noise!). It's not like they're playing really late at night or purposely trying to disturb people! I don't think there is a specific noise ordinance in our community.. we haven't had any complaints from the owners... But just in case the old couples try to do something about it or come to the house again to complain straight to us... what can we do about it? Is there anything we can say or do to get them off of our backs?
