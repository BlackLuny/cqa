So is there a specific career.. I would say no.. But I could be wrong. But if you are interested in the area of body language, psychology is where you should begin :)|`|AJeaWX8Paa	It's called microexpressions.  Based on what I've seen from Lie to Me, they got the idea right, but it's a lot harder than they make it look.  The expressions that they are talking about (the ones that are involuntary but betray one's true emotions) are usually too small and brief for an untrained observer to notice them consciously.  There has been evidence that suggests that the information in these microexpressions can be processed in a subconscious manner.  That is, people can tell when someone is lying but might not be able to explain exactly why they can tell.  It is something you can get better at, with extensive training.  Most of the research on this, however, has used cameras and slow-motion to see the microexpressions.  They aren't as obvious as the actors on the show make them out to be.

38IZfJqiaa	My wife has had a miscarriage and has carried one baby to term with no problems. I don't believe a dream about having one means that you did, but its possible. Your visit to an OB/GYN is the smart move, and he will be able to give you good advice and tell you what is going on with your body. I hope everything turns out ok for you, having a baby is a wonderful experience.

I know you may not be a believer in such, but it could work, I promise.  If you think it's psychological, I recommend seeking help from a professional. It my be schizophrenia.     Good luck, sweetheart.|`|RvmYqQtRaa	Have you ever seen "A beautiful mind" the man has to ask other people if the people he sees are real. It's most likely never going to end so if you can deal with ignoring them I would. However if you're set on not taking your medication you should at least take it when you feel annoyed or threatened by the voices. If voices ever tell you to commit suicide seek medical help immediately. If you know how perhaps you can also train yourself to eliminate the voices all together over time. Ruling out all extreme cases like demon possession I'd say you have some form of delusional mental illness. There may be no effective treatments available for you. So hang in there try talking to people more it will help you stay focused on reality. Fear nothing for your courage will see you through.|`|03b08a5d9ac92bf7e49cf04e0fc3b46daa	This is scary.

There is much over-medication in such treatments as for your type of hallucination.    There is a good resource, conservative re medication.  Give them a call, M-F, business hours, 1-800-232-6459.  http://www.focusonthefamily.com is their website url.  Ask for Counseling dept.  They will talk with you at that time, or make a phone appointment.  In either case, it will be a one-time conversation, with resources.  One of the resources will be a list/phone numbers of local counselors, who are conservative in terms of prescribing medications.  Be sure to mention this as a concern.    In the meantime, 1-800-525-Love 24/7 is a good, also licensed, counseling line.  Hearing negative or misleading voices is simply not worthwhile.  You might find a simple nightly prayer to God to guide, protect, heal, and teach you, during sleep and during the day, to be helpful.  Visualing a bright golden white light around you may help.  Keeping positive energy, asking Jesus to heal the cause of the "voices" problem, is good.  Be patient.  It is likely you will be given, via the first 800 number, some good local counselors' numbers.  As you are 13, you will probably need your parents' help in "interviewing" one or more of the counselors.  Let them know you don't appreciate "side effects" of drugs, see what their attitudes are.    Good fortune.  Hearing voices may be a temporary "phase," and it may be possible for you to regard the harshness with mild laughter, as the voices while scary/dramatic aren't really part of what's real and good.  Maybe simply ignoring the voices is a good tactic, but imo the best course is the http://www.focusonthefamily.com 1-800-232-6459 number.    "Emotions," Marilyn C. Barrick, Ph.D., and  "The Great Divorce," C. S. Lewis, are good books.|`|Amf1wtJmaa	You need to talk to your parents or your school's guidance councilor.  Hearing voices is not normal.

It is not your fault you are experiencing these things. I have this same type of problem close to me right now. If medication helps you then you need to take it to lead a normal life. It is nothing to be ashamed of and no one needs to know unless you want them to. If you ignore the problem it will consume you and terrible things could come to pass. If you are a religious person pray for strength. This is not something you want to battle alone.

Everyone has done stupid things. Sometimes I remember back at a particularly embarrassing or stupid thing I have done and it stops me in my tracks - but then I realize that I am a completely different person than I was in the past.     The way I am now is because of the lessons learned from doing stupid things in the past. Think of them as stepping stones on the path of your life.    Wow, that was sort of poetic, eh?|`|334dd93143062e48e77411739250ef2eaa	well, you are only here once so why punish yourself? I have done many stupid things in my life.

If in doubt, google Gibbs reflective cycle and fill it in with each incident you have problems with and you will learn allot about yourself|`|mcRNcxtjaa	If your stupid things affected someone else then I'd approach them about it and tell them how you feel now.

All your past experiences are a part of you. Sometimes we learn from the past, sometimes and most times we have to pay a price for what we choose, but it all depends on what you want and where you want to be. If in the past you have done stupid things to other people that have hurt them then you need to apologise. If the stupid things where wrong choices then you should learn. If your mind just keeps replaying old memories to drag you down, it is enough to just be conscious that your mind is doing this. Tune in to the present.|`|FES3yJGOaa	Run into a wall at full speed for best results.|`|XCpuUalOaa	Don't worry, I've done some pretty bad things, and regretted them so badly.

In time you'll learn to forgive yourself, I know I did. You need to accept the things you've done, and move on with your life. Know that what you did was wrong, but tell yourself  not to o it again, but ne happy that you've learned through making a mistake. Hope I helped.|`|MPBRAgMIaa	How to Forgive and Forget;   Every time you find yourself starting to think about the past, you need to change your thought patterns, otherwise you are just committing what you have done to memory.  Try these techniques;  when you find yourself thinking about the past, pause the thought (imagine pressing the STOP button on a camcorder)   Then change your thought to a more positive line; for example "I AM GLAD THAT THE PERSON I AM NOW WOULDNT MAKE THE SAME MISTAKES"   now recall the thought, from the new perspective of the person you are now, who has learnt from their mistake and that accepts every human has used bad judgement when younger and has regrets.  Feel proud that you have been able to build on this negative event and grow into a better person for it. (now press the EDIT button to change the thought, and imagine that the negative thoughts of what you did are being erased.  Then committ the above postive view to memory, by imagining yourself pressing the CONTINUE AND RECORD buttons to permanently change the thoughts).      Each time you think about the past, repeat these steps and thought processes.    This will work because at the moment, everytime you think of the past, you are remembering all the negative emotions you felt and feel about it as well as remembering what you actually did.  The process of remembering means that you are replaying it over and over in your mind, therefore committing it to your memory, in the same way as you would when revising for an exam.      By following the steps above you can recreate your memories so that eventually when you think of the past, you automatically recall, the positive thoughts of how far you have come since then, and so replacing the negative thoughts you are currently experiencing!    I hope this works for you, there are loads of self help books about that you can refer to.  Your local library can usually source any book you want , if they dont stock it they can usually order it for you free of charge.  You want self help books that specifically use CBT.

1Iw5Lomqaa	What you are describing are all signs of depression/and or anxiety.  However, it doesn't sound serious and much of it can be written off as a personality quirks.  There is nothing wrong with taking long walks, even if it takes you nowhere.  In fact it is healthy.  It can relieve stress, depression, and exercise is healthy, and that includes just walking.  Many people are not expressive.  The fact that you don't respond with a certain face to news really doesn't say much other than the fact that you don't emote.  Isolation, though, is not healthy and could be a sign of stress, depression, or anxiety.  Or even a combination of the three.  Feeling suddenly angry about something minor is common.  However, once again, this can be a sign of building stress, anxiety, and or depression.  The depression just adds to my point though doesn't prove it.  Try exercising more and see if your symptoms don't improve as it is effective in treating all 3 problems.  If things  don't improve or get worse, I would suggest you see a doctor.|`|5c47af8bffbd3c35498c08737caa396faa	definitely doesn't sound like schizophrenia.

It sounds like to me you have a very mild case of depression- process your anger it is coming from somewhere- ppl in general are annoying.

Everyone there was so self-deprecating and blaimed their drinking on a "disease." One is required to admit that one is powerless and "insane" and only God can grant them a daily reprieve...Everyone there just gets really depressed.    I quit drinking on my own. The vast majority of people that get sober do so on their own!    There is hope for your Dad. Get him in a non- 12 step program. If he goes to AA, he will just put AA ahead of his family (They are told to do that) and blaim everything on his "disease."

It is very likely that he won't admit to others and himself that he hs a drinking problem, bat ut is also very likely that he feels bad about himself.  Others nagging will make him feel unloved and unappreciated and it will make things worse.  What I would suggest is, that you ( and your family) tell him - and show him that you love him, respect him and care about him. Make him aware what he is doing to his health and that you worry about him. It may take time  -  be  p a t i e n t.  This is a tricky situation, because you'll have to see everything from his point of view - even though you might think differently.  - he will be ready for outside help (apart from various organizations you can also opt  for a one-to-one support with a phsychologist)  In situations like these it is difficult for family members to help, because you get too emotionally involved. Your greatest help is to be supportive.

8ohAAwrEaa	WOW!  A real question!  One not based on hate!    Talk to her a lot and ask her how she's doing.  You'll also want to talk to her parents.  If they don't know, they NEED to!  You may feel like you're betraying her, but they need to know.    She may have a chemical/hormonal imbalance that's causing this, which can be corrected.  She may just not feel loved, she may just be faking.  No matter what though, her parents should know.    She'll need constant support no matter what and she'll need you to keep your mouth shut from peers.  Other classmates & such should not know about it if at all possible.      Find a suicide helpline & call them, ask for advise.  Then, give her the number for the hotline as well.    You should also make sure your parents know about this as well, that way if you need to take a phone call late at night or leave the house to support, they'll understand why and you won't get into fights about it.|`|8cLV2OPYaa	She is either faking it for attention, OR she is seriously emotionally damaged and has probably been abused.

You may do more harm than good if you force your way into that situation thinking you are going to be some kind of hero.

Suicidal people sometimes just need someone to talk to them, and not necessarily about the way they're feeling.   Someone who was once suicidal told me that the best thing to do would be just to call them, or go over to their house. Usually telling them things like, "God's here for you" or "You'll make it through" doesn't help, because they've probably already thought about that.   You should probably also call a Counselor, or ask your friend to see one. Suicide isn't a joke, and it shouldn't be taken lightly.

mCAWxobNaa	Excellent question.  The simplest way to sum it up would be to say that modern Feminists are highly egocentric and have delegated themselves as the ultimate arbiters of a human being's value.  As such, they use shaming language and pejorative terms like "anti-feminist" to suggest that you are inferior (again it is my interpretation that modern Feminism is predicated on the hatred of men and a sense of Supremacy.  To suggest that my interpretation is wrong is evidence for this very Supremacy).    We define ourselves by what we believe in more than by what we oppose or disagree with.  For example, I wouldn't concern myself with a Nazi calling me an anti-Nazi as a measure of shaming language, nor would I be concerned if a colony of human pathogens choose to call me an anti-HIVist.  This is shaming language consistent with one's sense of superiority.    The other issue is that modern Feminists choose to argue that the likes of A. Dworkin, G. Greer, C. MacKinnon, etc. aren't influential, when in fact, they are extremely influential in steering the ship.    I don't put much stock in what modern Feminists say or call me.  I examine their deeds for myself and find that those in positions of influence are bullies and do not belong in positions of political or academic influence.    Independent, critical thought trumps any label that can be assigned to you.  For this reason, never seek approval from a modern Feminist for your thinking since in their minds they are always right and if you disagree with them, then you are wrong.  Don't let yourself be defined by members of a cult of hatred.|`|wkjncmHTaa	You can be what you like.

You are against feminism.    You oppose a pacifist movement that fights for gender equality with misinformation and outright falsehoods. And you think you're an anti-bully? Really? Tell that to the women trying to seek shelter from abusive ex-husbands in a woman's shelter that is about to close down from underfunding. Tell that to the girl who was raped when she seeks an abortion and is referred to a front "clinic" of evangelicals that bully her with lies. Tell that to the the tens of thousands of women in this country who are the victims of rapes that will never ever see justice.    You want peace? Maybe you should look at exactly what you're demonizing here. Or who you are listening to. You're listening to people that would turn such women out on the streets, those that excuse the men who murder their ex-wives (there was a question on this board just today with that message).    You're an anti-feminist. Deal with it. If you don't like it, change it.|`|cWxwHMQWaa	You can be, just don't expect for people to really care much what you're called, they'll have their own spin fro who you are and what you believe in anyhow.    I've had a few tell me in emails that I shouldn't call myself a feminists because yaddayadda BS. Some were saying it because they think I make myself sound bad, since they think feminism is worthless or even something that should be 'overthrown', others say I'm an insult to "true" feminists.    I tell them all they can suck my balls. But I tend to say it more nicely, because I'm a nice girl, mostly haha =o)    In real life, I very rarely see much like this, never about feminism, and I'm much more bothered by that, so it's much harder to just have a "Let them say whatever they want to" attitude about it. Luckily, it's still rare to be face to face with them and in a strange way worse though, because they hide their evil well.    In a queer way, I wish it were more like it is here where people just put it all out there, it'd seem to make it easier to deal with, at least then many more would have to face these 'bullies' then instead of saying they don't exist.    I'm distracted and lost my train of thought, but if I see another trolley soon I'll hop on it haha =o)    Over all, I agree with what you're saying was my point. I should stick to yes or no answers instead of doing essays o_O|`|IwUpusQiaa	nobody said you have to be anything you don't want to be :D|`|1d3NreHbaa	You don't have to be either, im neither as-well, and like you im very much anti-bullies, and anti-discrimination.|`|MhzlKnrWaa	When I tell people Im an ex-feminist, some look stricken, while others smile. Many go on to confide that they too are members of the same club.    I dont know how big this club is, frankly, because the word feminist is so widely misunderstood.    Many people think a feminist is someone who believes women should have equal opportunities with men, and whats wrong with that?    But, in fact, the term feminist comes with some very bleak baggage. And as Jan. 22 draws near, its time to tell it like it is.    Today feminism goes hand in hand with abortion, but it was not always so. Early feminists in the 1920s, like Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton, strove to get women the right to vote and to improve womens overall stance in society.    But they would have been horrified to peer into the future and see the bloody agenda that later feminists adopted.    You see, the early suffragettes believed that abortion was a terrible crime, not just against children but mothers as well. Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton and others never saw abortion as a solution to unwanted pregnancies.    On the contrary, they deplored abortion as a sign that society had failed women in desperate situations.    When a woman found herself abandoned and pregnant, the early feminists did not suggest that she end the pregnancy. Instead, they did what organizations like Birthright are doing today.    They worked hard to help women keep their babies, and instead of abortion, they offered the women emotional and financial support.    Since the legalization of abortion on Jan. 22, 1973, however, the desperate losers in the feminist revolution have been women and children. For one thing, about 40 million children in our country never had a chance to be born.    And for every tiny beating heart that was stopped in the womb, there are countless broken-hearted mothers who dont go a day without regretting what they did.    On Jan. 22, the Catholic Church has declared a day of Mass, fasting and prayer to restore what once was unquestioned in our country: the right to life.    It seems blatantly obvious that everyone deserves the chance to live, but language is powerful, and contemporary secular feminists have mastered its use. Over time, they have linked abortion with the rather harmless-sounding word choice.    However, this unsettling belief that destruction of life is simply one choice among others clashes with everything the early feminists championed..    In fact, early feminists saw abortion for what it really is: a death, a tragedy and a moral nightmare.    Susan B. Anthony published a newspaper called Revolution, where she didnt mince words about abortion, calling it child murder and infanticide.    Elizabeth Cady Stanton, the mother of seven, deplored abortion because it turned the unborn child into a womans property, to be disposed of at will.    Women themselves, she said, had been treated as mens property. So it made no sense for women to commit the same injustice against their children.    Turning people into property, of course, is the essence of slavery, and the early suffragettes also worked hard to overturn laws permitting this terrible injustice.    How ironic that todays pro-abortion feminists dehumanize the baby in the womb, just as slave-owners once did to slaves. The baby is not seen as a human being who deserves a chance to live but instead becomes a mere clump of cells, a piece of property that a woman can destroy.    Fortunately, the legacy of the early, anti-abortion feminists is kept alive today by a group called Feminists for Life.    On its Web site (www.feministsforlife.org), you can read about Dorothy Day, born in 1897 and the founder of the Catholic Worker Movement. In her younger years, Day had an abortion because her boyfriend wanted nothing to do with the child.    Years later, she had a major change of heart and converted to Catholicism. Day devoted the rest of her life to resisting war, the death penalty, racism, anti-Semitismand abortion.    Were living in an age of genocide, she wrote. Not only war and the extermination of the Jews but the whole program of abortion.    In my younger years, I believed that feminism was a benign movement encouraging women to pursue their dreams. Over time, however, I have discovered the tragic truth: There is one pursuit that todays pro-abortion feminists roundly discourage women from embracing.    It is the very beautiful and thoroughly feminine desire to cherish and protect children.    Fortunately, there are many people who believe in a womans inherent, God-given dignity, which also is present in her unborn child. Like the early feminists, they are aware of a truth inscribed on the human heart:    The empowerment of women can never be linked to the deaths of children.    On Jan. 22, lets pray that our society will once again embrace the values of the early suffragettes.    They dearly wanted women to attain their dreams but not by|`|hR1wc0taaa	I think bullies only get the power that others grant them.  most times they back down when confronted  there are some bully pulpits that can't be unsanctioned, such as Fox News.

Imagine no struggles with shame, not a single one in your whole life, no matter what kind of selfish, lazy, harmful, or immoral action you had taken. <br>  <br>  And pretend that the concept of responsibility is unknown to you, except as a burden others seem to accept without question, like gullible fools. <br>  <br>  Now add to this strange fantasy the ability to conceal from other people that your psychological makeup is radically different from theirs. Since everyone simply assumes that conscience is universal among human beings, hiding the fact that you are conscience-free is nearly effortless. <br>  <br>  You are not held back from any of your desires by guilt or shame, and you are never confronted by others for your cold-bloodedness. The ice water in your veins is so bizarre, so completely outside of their personal experience, that they seldom even guess at your condition.<br>  <br>  In other words, you are completely free of internal restraints, and your unhampered liberty to do just as you please, with no pangs of conscience, is conveniently invisible to the world. <br>  <br>  You can do anything at all, and still your strange advantage over the majority of people, who are kept in line by their consciences will most likely remain undiscovered.<br>  <br>  How will you live your life? <br>  <br>  What will you do with your huge and secret advantage, and with the corresponding handicap of other people (conscience)? <br>  <br>  The answer will depend largely on just what your desires happen to be, because people are not all the same. Even the profoundly unscrupulous are not all the same. Some people - whether they have a conscience or not - favor the ease of inertia, while others are filled with dreams and wild ambitions. Some human beings are brilliant and talented, some are dull-witted, and most, conscience or not, are somewhere in between. There are violent people and nonviolent ones, individuals who are motivated by blood lust and those who have no such appetites. [...]<br>  <br>  Provided you are not forcibly stopped, you can do anything at all. <br>  <br>  If you are born at the right time, with some access to family fortune, and you have a special talent for whipping up other people's hatred and sense of deprivation, you can arrange to kill large numbers of unsuspecting people. With enough money, you can accomplish this from far away, and you can sit back safely and watch in satisfaction.

The high-profile disorders classed as schizophrenia occur in only about 1 percent of [the population] - a mere quarter of the rate of antisocial personality - and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention say that the rate of colon cancer in the United States, considered "alarmingly high," is about 40 per 100,000 - one hundred times lower than the rate of antisocial personality. <br>  <br>  The high incidence of sociopathy in human society has a profound effect on the rest of us who must live on this planet, too, even those of us who have not been clinically traumatized. The individuals who constitute this 4 percent drain our relationships, our bank accounts, our accomplishments, our self-esteem, our very peace on earth. <br>  <br>  Yet surprisingly, many people know nothing about this disorder, or if they do, they think only in terms of violent psychopathy - murderers, serial killers, mass murderers - people who have conspicuously broken the law many times over, and who, if caught, will be imprisoned, maybe even put to death by our legal system. <br>  <br>  We are not commonly aware of, nor do we usually identify, the larger number of nonviolent sociopaths among us, people who often are not blatant lawbreakers, and against whom our formal legal system provides little defense.<br>  <br>  Most of us would not imagine any correspondence between conceiving an ethnic genocide and, say, guiltlessly lying to one's boss about a coworker. But the psychological correspondence is not only there; it is chilling. Simple and profound, the link is the absence of the inner mechanism that beats up on us, emotionally speaking, when we make a choice we view as immoral, unethical, neglectful, or selfish. <br>  <br>  Most of us feel mildly guilty if we eat the last piece of cake in the kitchen, let alone what we would feel if we intentionally and methodically set about to hurt another person. <br>  <br>  Those who have no conscience at all are a group unto themselves, whether they be homicidal tyrants or merely ruthless social snipers.<br>  <br>  The presence or absence of conscience is a deep human division, arguably more significant than intelligence, race, or even gender. <br>  <br>  What differentiates a sociopath who lives off the labors of others from one who occasionally robs convenience stores, or from one who is a contemporary robber baron - or what makes the difference betwen an ordinary bully and a sociopathic murderer - is nothing more than social status, drive, intellect, blood lust, or simple opportunity. <br>  <br>  What distinguishes all of these people from the rest of us is an utterly empty hole in the psyche, where there should be the most evolved of all humanizing functions.|`|6adde512f01e638a497d98402aa0eb44aa	those who are not 'NORMAL' people-ofcourse 'HARMFUL' to all-knowing reason,violent ways of making obident and civilised -someone 'unruly',naming alternatives as pathology|`|9bd543996ceabc5fb1ab88e55cf2aa85aa	Well, hell yes.

As simple as that my friend. However true form of government dates back to when the Pharoahs ruled and used the G-D method meaning they were gods, and you worshipped them and then they had animals to reference to themselves, like the jackel, or the Lion. etc., but Rome came and the ever so intelligent Julius Caesar who basically gave us the Senate or the republic, that governed in a group for others, because the population was so large they made communities and everyone had a leader of their community. Independence is okay but not if you have so many independents, they must form groups and then they must have leaders, just like a wolf pack. or birds, even insects have order, watch the ants or the bees? The form of government that we have presently is failing because it is too densely populated and therefore too far removed from the governing powers that now they set themselves up for a fall just like Rome, Rome fell because of that very reason too much territory and no hands on. Once you lose the faith of the people you lose your empire. Police in latin means to clean, Pretorians were the Police in Rome and they were there to keep order and collect the taxes. The same as now but bigger. Smaller governments are not working either because they have been limited in their growth and certainly need to progress.

It doesn't necessarily matter but it is fun to know how smart you are. there are lots of tests online.|`|a36d727d37ee2bae913b89eb329e5062aa	A measure of intelligence level. Originally defined as 100 times the mental age devided by the chronological age. It now represents a persons performance relative to his peers. Higher I.Q means that individual has got better abilities in reasoning, judging, learning, abstract thinking etc only and does not mean defenitely successfull as I.Q speaks only at individual level. He may or may not relate well with his peers to make his life successful at a social level.<br>  There are a lot of standardised Intelligence tests available in the internet to finds one's own I.Q level.|`|c489a15d5df02a70ff9c16aea55740c9aa	is is a tool used to measure general intelligence. new light shed upon this says that their are many different intelligences, linguistic, musical, analytical ,creative, social adeptness, intra and inrterpersonal are all considered intelligence facets. to me this means everyone has intelligence in at least one area.|`|AA10504019	Just remember Einstein only had a 10 th grade education.|`|43c387a942194282d53428a4b26ec25aaa	Einstein was a college professor...he took physics at university. He had far more than a '10th grade' education.<br>  <br>  -.-<br>  <br>  IQ stands for intelligence quotient. The average score is 100, and it essentially tells you how well you score on a test filled with difficult questions compared to the rest of the population. 85 is far below average, 115 is far above average. 130 would qualify you for mensa, and 145 is a pretty rare score.<br>  <br>  Why does it matter? That's in debate. Some say it doesn't matter. Some say it does. The statistical data says it does matter, and that IQ is a good predictor of what you are capable of achieving in life. IQ correlates with school achievement, income, how good a citizen you are, ect. High IQ parents also tend to breed smart children!<br>  <br>  IQ is considered about 75% genetic by adulthood, and 25% is effected by environmental factors. IQ does have it's limitations though; it's better at telling someone how dumb they are than how smart they are. IQ tests are VERY VERY accurate at low range, and can identify what an individual is capable of with remarkable accuracy for IQ's between 50 and 115. After 115 however, things become a bit wish-washy; IQ doesn't seem to matter that much anymore. Actually, some suggest that after 130 IQ is meaningless, because there are no current correlations for IQ's above 135-140. They just don't seem to mean anything other than you're doing a bit better on the test.<br>  <br>  In order to find out what your IQ, you have to take a test. For the most accurate results, you'd have to see a psychologist. You can take two fairly accurate tests online, though.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/testthenation/iq/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bbc.co.uk/testthenation/iq/</a> created by a psychologist for BBC to mimic the stanford-binet IQ test.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.iqtest.dk/main.swf" rel="nofollow">http://www.iqtest.dk/main.swf</a> created by mensa denmark to mimic the Ravens APM IQ test.

Your 3rd month must have been wild because he was "only good at 1 thing (sex)".

r2j5kf9Eaa	No you're not mental or crazy; at least there is no indication of it from what you have written.  Social anxiety, doing stupid things, and thinking you look stupid are all normal, especially for teenagers.  Unfortunately, these things do not completely go away as you get older, but they do go away for the most part.  Your inability to control your daydreams sounds like it might be related your ADHD, e.g., if your daydreams intrude on your ability to pay attention in class.  This might be an indication that your drug dose is too low, or ironically it could also mean that your dose is too high.  Alternately, it might mean that your current medication is not the ideal one for you.  Call your psychiatrist and explain this symptom.  She might be able to change your prescription without a visit or suggest some mental exercises, e.g., meditation, that may serve as an adjunct to your medication.|`|AA11616170	Sounds like you have the creativity to be a writer.

Do you think feminists also have secret handshakes?|`|SawySuLRaa	Feminism is the belief in the right of women to have political, social, and economic equality with men. It is a discourse that involves various movements, theories, and philosophies which are concerned with the issue of gender difference, advocate equality for women, and campaign for women's rights and interests.[1][2][3][4][5] According to some, the history of feminism can be divided into three waves.[4][6] The first wave was in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the second was in the 1960s and 1970s and the third extends from the 1990s to the present.[7] Feminist theory emerged from these feminist movements.[8][9] It is manifest in a variety of disciplines such as feminist geography, feminist history and feminist literary criticism.    Feminism has altered predominant perspectives in a wide range of areas within Western society, ranging from culture to law. Feminist activists have campaigned for women's legal rights (rights of contract, property rights, voting rights); for women's right to bodily integrity and autonomy, for abortion rights, and for reproductive rights (including access to contraception and quality prenatal care); for protection from domestic violence, sexual harassment and rape;[10][1] for workplace rights, including maternity leave and equal pay; and against other forms of discrimination.[11][12][13]    During much of its history, most feminist movements and theories had leaders who were predominantly middle-class white women from Western Europe and North America.[14][15][16] However, at least since Sojourner Truth's 1851 speech to American feminists, women of other races have proposed alternative feminisms.[15] This trend accelerated in the 1960s with the Civil Rights movement in the United States and the collapse of European colonialism in Africa, the Caribbean, parts of Latin America and Southeast Asia. Since that time, women in former European colonies and the Third World have proposed "Post-colonial" and "Third World" feminisms.[16] Some Postcolonial feminists, such as Chandra Talpade Mohanty, are critical of Western feminism for being ethnocentric.[17] Black feminists, such as Angela Davis and Alice Walker, share this view.[14]    Since the 1980s, standpoint feminists have argued that feminism should examine how women's experience of inequality relates to that of racism, homophobia, classism and colonization.[15][18] In the late 1980s and 1990s postmodern feminists argued that gender roles are socially constructed,[19][20][21] and that it is impossible to generalize women's experiences across cultures and histories.|`|NhMfGXmxaa	Funny, I've seen more men, and particularly anti-feminist men here, use that one.

From experience, I never really use it in an aggressive or violent way. And, I tend to mix it up with the : and the =. Both relatively meaning the same thing, and both virtually harmless.     It could mean frustration, but, I doubt it.

xvLaAGx6aa	My sister has it.  Look at the roots:  bi--two.  Two different moods: up and down.  Happy and sad.  One minute, you're laughing and Happy, and having a lot of fun.  And then one little thing can tick you off, and you're just so down low that nothing will ever get better.  Of course it will.  But when you're low, it feels like you're under water. the "blue water" as some books I've read describes it.  And you can't get your head up (you get up, eventually, though.)  But, don't worry.  It's easily managable if you get on medication and stick to it.  Talk to a doctor (:  good luck!|`|AB1xk3OBaa	its a mental disorder and u probably don't have it and even if u did ur mom isnt the one who needs 2 diagnose it.

In the depressed phase you will sleep a lot and display other characteristics of unipolar depression. In the manic phase you will be elated, irritable, hyper social, and hyper sexual.|`|5mtDxigSaa	Yeah you're mom shouldn't diagnose it that's not right. It's a condition in which you have fluctuating mood swings, you're happy one minute and sad the next. you love somebody one minute then you hate them the next. But this is common in young folk, especially if you're young and possibly hitting puberty. I'm in my early twenties and I feel these things sometimes. Bipolar cases are usually more serious and will fluctuate from days to weeks and months at a time. Don't go jumping to conclusions just yet and tell your mom you don't appreciate her diagnosing you because it makes you feel uneasy and interferes with stuff.|`|wyXCRGv6aa	it's means you quickly change moods, unpredictably.|`|7LBddVjHaa	it means that you're like happy,but an hour later you're pissed as heck|`|MhJbmrFraa	Uhm... Your mom shouldn't be diagnosing you unless she has a degree in Psychology...  She should send you to a trained professional if she honestly believes you are Bipolar; it's serious business.|`|ja3iuqNoaa	It is severe ups and downs, but it is way more than just mood swings.  Your mom probably said that because you have mood swings, which is a normal part of being a teenager.  Bipolar disorder is more than that.  People will often have periods of extremely high moods, called mania, where it is like euphoria, and then they will slip into depression.  Mania can include speaking very rapidly and having lots of energy.    The problem with your mom saying you have bipolar disorder is that she probably isn't aware of all the symptoms and their severity.  She may not have meant it, and she was probably just describing mood swings that are annoying but all adolescents have.|`|SHjebtmAaa	Bipolar disorder, , is a brain disorder that causes unusual shifts in a persons mood, energy, and ability to function. Different from the normal ups and downs that everyone goes through, the symptoms of bipolar disorder are severe. They can result in damaged relationships, poor job or school performance, and even suicide. But there is good news: bipolar disorder can be treated, and people with this illness can lead full and productive lives.    About 5.7 million American adults or about 2.6 percent of the population age 18 and older in any given year,1 have bipolar disorder. Bipolar disorder typically develops in late adolescence or early adulthood. However, some people have their first symptoms during childhood, and some develop them late in life. It is often not recognized as an illness, and people may suffer for years before it is properly diagnosed and treated. Like diabetes or heart disease, bipolar disorder is a long-term illness that must be carefully managed throughout a persons life.      I personally suffer from severe bipolar disorder,and throughout my teen years my mom would let the docters put me on meds because she thought there was something wrong. For me, the drugs didnt work though, it just sent me from an energy filled person to someone who had trouble caring about anything. I remember one morning i woke up, and started wishing I wouldnt wake up again. Gee the doc's forgot to mention the pills could cause suisidal thoughts -.- Well, turns out those pills made me deppress, and so to conteract that, they didnt take me off the pills, but instead stuck me on happy pills. (Anti-deppressents) That was bad. I ended up in a mental institution for two weeks, because the mix of pill completely screwed around with my body.  Its been about three years since then, I took myself off the pills, and started working on controlling it myself. Pills ****** me up pretty bad though, so if your mom is trying to get you diagnosed or something, and if it does end up happening, try to avoid prescibed medicine. Theres only about a 50/50 chance of it working. Theres also a 50/50 chance of the doctor guessing right. Mine medicated me up after only seeing me ONCE!      Well goodluck!!!
YUU6DS3haa	yes, im afraid of anything that bleeds for 10 days and doesnt die|`|9BvmHGiJaa	hell no!!!!    besides when she is on her period, then its really disgusting "down there"|`|6H1ie8WXaa	Would you care to explain how a woman somehow knows what a man feels about the bodies of women?    Truth be told, I'm avoiding pornography and sex altogether because I'm simply trying to save myself up for the woman I marry. It may come out as fear, but actually it's simply self-respect and respect for the woman I wish to marry.|`|BVL85SAqaa	i'm a guy and i have no problems with the woman body...... but it does intimidate me.|`|oVeGMNsLaa	I don't know if I agree with Knapp's statements about motherhood, but I do think that, for some men, there IS indeed a fear of the female body, albeit one that is thoroughly subconscious.  I mean, all we have to do is look back at myths of vagina dentata and men's anxiety about how to please a woman, as if the vagina and vulva is something incredibly complex and unappealingly mysterious.  I'd also add in there that many men might fear the power that women have to hide their arousal (unlike a man who is completely vulnerable with an erection), and being able to "stick it to her" is a way to conquer that and turn his embarrassment and vulnerability into power.  Not to mention many men's fears that they cannot satisfy her (the dreaded "was she faking it?"), and that fuels a lot of rage sometimes.    But once again, this is hardly true for all men.  But for some, I do believe that these feelings are part of subconscious fears.|`|ErkGf5ujaa	There are  many men as well telling about  womb envy.    Actually all realities of this world prove that..Of course many men defensively deny,and push it to subconcious (to make it only bigger) .Why else men lose even reasoning out of their  hunger for proving(!)women are "less" and so they are "more"? How come they need this that much?It comes to that fact.  Wherever male creativity on average is further away from us women's average total,  (eg.middle east)there suppression of women is even more "needed".lol|`|sfn6SpbCaa	I completely disagree. A women's body is an element of beauty. It's featured in many famous art pieces.

Never listen to irresponsible people. They'll lead you to trouble.|`|oWVTb7vlaa	no i don't agree.    men aren't afraid of a womans body!!  we love it.    this was written by a woman.

They're pretty.|`|fDGPbwdsaa	Sounds like a woman who thinks she understands men's minds - when in reality, she clearly demonstrates an absolute lack of understanding anything (and perhaps, everything) about men.      At a guess, I'd say she (the author) has feminist leanings....|`|u1vEj8DYaa	Yes of course.  What they fear they burn as witches:    "The myth of the vagina dentata, or vagina with teeth, derives from primitive masculine dreads of the "mysteries" of women and sexual union. It evokes castration anxiety, whereby the man fears loss of the penis during intercourse, and more generally it relates to fears of weakness, impotence, or annihilation by incorporation (connected to unconscious notions of "returning to the womb").     -- Stories of the vagina dentata persist in aboriginal myths and legends (Egyptian, Indo-European, Greek, Native American, African), as well as in contemporary narratives, such as vulgar sexist jokes.  -- Sublimated expressions of this dread underlie stories of post-coital loss of strength, such as the biblical story of Samson and Delilah, or the deep social resonance of the recent (1993) Lorena and John Wayne Bobbitt incident in America.   -- Many narratives of "hero vs. monster" also rely on the myth: for instance, Oedipus and the Sphinx, whose mythic structure underlies Benchley's novel, Jaws.   -- Some cultural surgical practices, such as clitoridectomies and other female genital mutilations (including modern episiotomies), also relate to the myth. These practices physically inscribe an assertion of masculine domination that implies a dread of feminine powers.     From a contemporary, feminist, psychoanalytic perspective, Elizabeth Grosz writes:   "The fantasy of the vagina dentata, of the non-human status of woman as android, vampire or animal, the identification of female sexuality as voracious, insatiable, enigmatic, invisible and unknowable, cold, calculating, instrumental, castrator/decapitator of the male, dissimulatress or fake, predatory, engulfing mother, preying on male weakness, are all consequences of the ways in which male orgasm has functioned as the measure and representative of all sexualities and all modes of erotic encounter."|`|6qPTQDdZaa	Get away from me, woman!  Your body terrifes me!    No, this woman has no idea what she's talking about.|`|w9cicy0Daa	I'd have to read the rest just to be sure, but from the quote it looks like pseudo-psychological claptrap. Unfortunately, men are mostly moved by a woman's body in a sexual way and it is rarely out of fear.    The part about a woman's body being seen as sinful within certain religions is already documented and I'd agree that that has been the case.|`|SawySuLRaa	I happen to like a woman's body. It does not scare me at all.|`|iFvGsqxcaa	Freud had it all wrong. Women don't have penis envy, men have vagina envy.
t2R3mEMoaa	I think he has some fear of being found anything but normal and there is much more to this than meets the eye, obviously.

His aggravation over all this just serves to mean he has much he would rather keep hid. Not good!|`|OFCCgLdKaa	Things like:    "Does it make you angry when people tell you what to do?"

It should include an evaluation of drug & alcohol use, or possible personality disorder. His wife must have concerns about him. It would probably be an in-depth interview & possibly some questionnaires to substantiate or rule-out a diagnosis. The fact that he's quite aggravated about this speaks volumes. Don't know about postponement. It doesn't take too many hours (depending upon who's doing the evaluating & what they determine). Putting it off, may not be in his best interests.
qktzCVvMaa	You could be subconsciously worried about your Dad. Think about his daily life and try to figure out if there's anything reasonable to worry about.     Or maybe you don't feel like you spend enough time with him or something. If that's the case, maybe you could hang out with him a little. Go out to dinner and have a good talk. Just doing that every once in awhile might calm your nerves if you really are nervous about him.|`|gxSDSpUkaa	i always have dreams of my mom dying you are just scared for your dad.|`|l8yfpyy1aa	Could it be that you feel you're not completely living up to your Dad's values and expectations, and are feeling a bit anxious about that?|`|5cCIDpGfaa	I have weird dreams too.   In the past year I have had 2 dreams about John Lennon.  In the first one he was trying to kill me.  In the second one I saw him in starbucks and he was going to buy me a new cell phone.    I have come to the conclusion that it means I'm crazy.
IIsByPj6aa	I was pretty ashamed of my bipolar before I got it under control, too.  I'm a really rapid cycling bipolar, so I'd have manic and depressive episodes very close together, when it got to be so bad with my schizophrenia and regular severe clinical depression that I would literally bounce between rock bottom and the ultimate high within the span of a few hours.  But I'm on medication now, lithium, etc, and while the side effects aren't ideal, it helps my mood stay a lot more stable.    You shouldn't be embarrassed, though. Your friend needs to be less close-minded and less of a jerk.  Kids have called me crazy my entire life, maybe I'm used to it, but I always interpreted it as "interesting" or "wild", maybe too free-spirited and unhampered and that was something they couldn't understand? I don't know, I always thought "crazy" was a compliment.  But when related to my mental illness... things are different.  I had to acknowledge that I was in fact mentally ill before I could move on and come to be okay with myself again.  You shouldn't be ashamed of who you are... you should be ashamed of those who can't accept you for who you are.|`|VssY6xUaaa	You don't have to be ashamed of anything but I tell you, it's hard to interact with the people around you. Since you can't do anything about your condition, I suggest you find a close friend who can understand what you're going through. People who won't think you're cracked up when your mood shifts. Who cares what society thinks, anyway? They don't know what it's like to be bipolar.|`|oFV48JbGaa	What you just described does not sound like Bipolar disorder. A bipolar person does not go through "OCD phases". They go through phases of mania or hypo/hypermania. It does not usually make a person violent either.
MWC2MXlUaa	Therapy is stupid. They dont know anything. I would suggest trying to forget about what ever is making you depressed. I know it is really hard to because I have also been depressed lately. Kind of an off and on thing for 2 years :(  You can also try talking to someone who has been through what you are going through if you know anyone. I hope this helps. I am very sorry. I know how you feel. It will get better. Dont worry.|`|IlNDHC3raa	I'm depressed while i'm AT school. I take after my father, who was also a quiet guy. I just sit in class and don't talk to anybody. I have a few close friends and it seems (expecially in recent years) that I need them WAYY more then they need me. But we make eachother laugh and it doesn't seem pathetic, but it really is. to me.    And i crush on alot of girls that i know I will never get. Makes me feel stupid. I'm just not good at making conversation with people that don't share my interests. my friends and i have helarius conversations, but they're always about TV or Videogames.     The only time i get to be myself is when I come home from school. I think the ammount of people in my school just pressures me to try my hardest to fit in.    My mom is at work, so I walk into my house and scream, maybe start singing my favorite songs outloud. I used to be depressed, but I learned how to deal with it. how to chill out. i've been alone soo long and I see the future being brighter.    me and you and every-other answerer here are crazy. but we THINK. other people just do stuff. We're smart, they're stupid. We'll get over sh-t.|`|szkrumAJaa	Exercise.  I jump on the treadmill when I'm feeling down.|`|eTwTcw1Waa	Need more info why you are depressed.

oFV48JbGaa	What does your weather preference have to do with your mental condition...?|`|LKY38BNsaa	No-    Some people just prefer rain or snow to sunshine. It doesn't indicate anything is wrong in your mind. And I agree with you on the sound of rain and the solace of the snow, I also prefer the weather that most people don't.|`|V9oAV58Faa	Aw, I haven't heard any guys say this at all so you're deffinently one of a kind.  But NO!  I don't think you have a mental problem at all, you just stand out from the crowd and think in your own way.  :)  I like it.  I love snow and rain too but I also love spring and summer.  It's just your opinion!    To me, a mental illness would be saying the bed is a monster out to eat you.  Lol :D    Hope I helped!|`|26W0Fb2Uaa	yahhh the rain is pretty peaceful.  and it's nice to get some alone time every once in a while, esp when ur in pretty scenery(:  and no-   you don't have a mental problem.(:|`|UbuTj8g6aa	Im sure youve noticed the shift in your energy in the mountains, surrounded by trees or near moving water. Even being out in the after rain air, or after a thunderstorm, you feel the difference.    Its the negative ions that give you that feel good feeling. Negative ions are created in nature as air molecules are exposed to sunlight, moving air and water. They increase the flow of oxygen to the brain, resulting in higher alertness, decreased drowsiness and more mental energy.    Waves crashing against the shore, a stunning waterfall, an intense lightning storm. I enjoy the negative ion's from these sources. LOL, this is not a mental condition.... Enjoy this gift!!!!!!!

8adc459fdcf3e877c72d7d7c3485f1d5aa	This dream is not from God or from Satan. This dream is simply saying that you want to talk to/start a relationship with a certain person but you feel like it is inappropriate and that there might be negative consequences. Whether or not it really is inappropriate or if there will be negative consequences is something only you can decide. You should try to pray/meditate about it.|`|HVmzxZZuaa	that is a message from satan. if you talk to her bad things will come into your life|`|s8C6AfLxaa	I think it's your way of idealizing this girl, and making up excuses for not speaking to her.    Think: I take it you do, or have gone to church services...is this common behavior for church?  Usually, there are more people than two, sitting in one pew (rhymed, ha!).  And, you can't just go up and speak to someone, whenever you want to.  There's a sermon-which you're not supposed to interrupt-and other things, like communion, which have a sacredness to them.  I also, never heard of anyone getting a choke-hold from the back, during a church service!    I doubt very much that God, or Satan, is speaking to you, but that you're telling yourself that this girl would never speak to you, or go out with you...maybe because she's too "holy" and idealized in your mind, or simply not good enough for you.  But, look where you put yourself-in a church, with the girl, and at least one rival, where the behavior is more common to a bar or club, than to a real church.  So, I think your first guess is right.  You're holding back on speaking to this girl because of your insecurities. (remember:  You came up with this alternative yourself).  So, go and talk to this girl-the worst that can happen is that you'll end up as you are now-without the girl-but at least you'll know that you tried!|`|0ABb938aaa	god thats obvious. Neither god or satan are real, you are just worried.|`|KoTex1Zuaa	My daddy's a preacher, and I kinda asked him in a hypothetical kind of way. he thinks that it is not a sign from satan. He started joking around and said "Maybe God does not want him flirting in church."
N4ZLMXekaa	A premonition is usually a dream, but not all dreams are premonitions.  A dream I think is self explainitory. It is just the mind going through subconcious thoughts while you are sleeping.  A premonition is when you have a vision of the future or what is going to happen to you or someone else.|`|VssY6xUaaa	A premonition is seeing future events while dreams can be misleading. Dreams don't necessarily show the future or whatever. It just shows you things that are in your head while you're sleeping.

It could be away of your body telling you that you just need a short break like maybe if you and your husband could just get away for the weekend not really go anywhere far away but maybe just to a hotel and stay and have some time to yourselves. It is a good thing that you are aware of it though. Good Luck!

t2R3mEMoaa	I'm not sure if each state or province has different mandates or not. Here in my province of N.B.Canada, foster adult care implies a severe mental and/or physical handicap and depending on your home care facilities you would only take one person. If you have opened a health care facility then you can have up to 15. It is not considered a foster home. If you have a group home then it implies children, usually children/teens in which you have several skilled people on staff. A lay person would imply they are the same. Hope this helps.........also the funding for each is different.

If the responses are followed by aversive consequences, associations to the situation become weaker.     The puzzle box experiments were motivated in part by Thorndike's dislike for statements that animals made use of extraordinary faculties such as insight in their problem solving.    Thorndike meant to distinguish clearly whether or not cats escaping from puzzle boxes were using insight. Thorndike's instruments in answering this question were 'learning curves' revealed by plotting the time it took for an animal to escape the box each time it was in the box.     He reasoned that if the animals were showing 'insight,' then their time to escape would suddenly drop to a negligible period, which would also be shown in the learning curve as an abrupt drop; while animals using a more ordinary method of trial and error would show gradual curves. His finding was that cats consistently showed gradual learning.    Thorndike interpreted the findings in terms of associations. He asserted that the connection between the box and the motions the cat used to escape was 'strengthened' by each escape.     Thorndike specified three conditions that maximizes learning:  * The law of effect stated that the likely recurrence of a response is generally governed by its consequence or effect generally in the form of reward or punishment.  * The law of recency stated that the most recent response is likely to govern the recurrence.  * The law of exercise stated that stimulus-response associations are strengthened through repetition."|`|PLBdaOMaaa	It came from a cat who didn't blink.|`|9vMNFxI3aa	nopers|`|VGHY0pUtaa	You heard it from someone thats struck a cat with a hammer.|`|19f5e6c60fba6ac553230548de86e0b1aa	ONE OF THOSE STUPID T SHIRT PHRASES|`|GAswoUXoaa	This phrase is a quote from George Carlin, who is a comedian.

cTvP6j7Haa	Sorry to inform you, but only YOU can interpret your dreams.  Thus, anything that anybody says is complete conjecture.  Driving without being able to can mean:  1 want to drive.  2 able to drive. 3 take control. 4 not being in control 5 running away from somebody or thing. Not being able to stop:  6 no control.  7 not wanting to go to school, 8 school not the destination. 9. scared of the law.  10 happy you broke the law.  11 Not knowing if you broke the law.  According to K.I.S.S. book on dreams the most important part is - How did you feel?  What was the significance of the car, the school, the not stopping, of the dream?  Was the car a car, or was it you, was it a parent, a teacher?  The same questions for the brakes and the stop sign.  And then the same for the second dream.  Keep a dream journal. The dream on top of the left hand page, and your notes with dates and time underneath it.  Within a few months, you'll be the best dream interpreter in your school.

Yet on your own you cannot stop. You are not getting the full benefits of being in school, because you do not take the time to be present in your classes.    Anakin Skywalker - being raped by a fantasy figure denotes that you spend too much time in fantasies and not enough time tending to your real life affairs. Again this is a sign of not enough supervision. You are being robbed of your opportunities, literally being screwed. Having his son denote the future consequences of this pattern of life.

XxQbaVtFaa	To see a spider in your dream, indicates that you are feeling like an outsider in some situation. Or that you may want to keep your distance and  stay away from an alluring and tempting situation.  The spider is also symbolic of feminine power. Alternatively, a spider may refer to a powerful force protecting you against  your self-destructive behavior. If you kill a spider, it symbolizes misfortune and general bad luck.    Eight stands for power of authority, success, karma, material gains, regeneration, and wealth. When the number eight appears in your dream, trust your instincts and intuition.    Seven signifies mental perfection, healing, completion, music and attainment of high spirituality. Additionally, you are unique and eccentric    Three signifies life, vitality, inner strength, completion, imagination, creativity, energy, and self-exploration. Three stands for trilogy as in the past, present, and future or father, mother, and child, etc.      To see blood in your dream, represents life, love, and passion as well as disappointments. If you see the word "blood" written in your dream, then it may refer to some situation in your life that is permanent and cannot be changed. If something else is written in blood, then it represents the energy you have put into a project. You have invested so much effort into something that you are not willing to give it up.      hope that helps :D
mU2eMSi3aa	The sevens represent a sequence and the eight is obviously out of sequence and is accentuated by the blood and being lower.  Eight is in the future of seven so it is something in the future that is disharmonious to the rest of your life.  Sevens in a row may be luck or harmony.  Red is a sensual color and might have to do with something sexual especially since it is against pure white signifying purity.  A pure or first sexual encounter maybe.  A lot of things are out of harmony in the dream, the spider acting odd and the chimes also so it is something that you don't see as being proper or you are afraid might change you.  Bells are heralding the event but in a way that might signify a dark path.  The spider is symbolizes your needing to understand the numbers and the significance in you life.  You are taxing yourself trying to figure it out and the spider pants because it is dire and no web mean transition.  The black and yellow represent the balance that may be disturbed.|`|Ot06v8yvaa	it sounds like a story, not a dream|`|KoTex1Zuaa	Don't worry.

A lot of people weren't around then so they can't grasp how serious this matter is.  People are losing their homes (roof over their heads), their jobs (the unemployment rate is over 8% and each month 50,000 or more people are losing their jobs), stores are going under and closing down but some are going into Chapter 11.  Banks are needing to be bailed out because they are failing.  Credit card use is the highest and if not curbed we'll be in a worse mess than now.  President Obama says the worst is yet to come, and it will take a long time to get out of this mess and so far he's doing a stimulus plan that will be for twelve years.  We assume it will take ten years to get out of this mess at least.  The plans to attempt to solve this aren't pat answers and may turn what we have from a recession to a depression.  Read up on wikipedia about the 10 year downturn called "The Great Depression".  When so many people are hurting they can't help others or they protect what they have so as to have what their own family needs to survive.|`|x114YWtPaa	Yes, I do believe the economy is THAT bad.  Here are my reasons for thinking this.    1. The US owes trillions of dollars to other nations-China, Japan, EU, Russia, and India--they own T-bills (bonds).  Can we pay them back?    2. The Federal Reserve prints money.  It doesn't keep track of how much it prints.  This money goes into the economy and it acts like someone's pouring water into a container--the container overflows (inflation) devaluing the currency.  Inflation is the increase in the money supply.  Steady increases in prices are the result of inflation.  This devalues the currency (the dollar).  The means you and I cannot afford to buy products and services because they become more expensive.  What happens when a hyper-inflationary period kicks in?  Social and political unrest.  Please read about Weimar Germany in the early 1920's.    3. There have already been financial collapses in Iceland, Greece, Spain, and Britain.    4. Several states (CA, OH, MI, KY, etc.) can no longer fund their unemployment programs.  This means people applying for unemployment compensation in those and other states cannot get the funds to assist them while they look for employment.    5. We are in a deflationary cycle.  This means the money supply has contracted, making the value of the dollar greater and as a result prices have decreased making it easier for people to buy more products/services at less cost.  This is the market correcting itself for the intervention of government created bubbles of the 1990's (high-tech, dotcom bubbles, housing bubble, etc.)    6. American intervention in other nations internal affairs.  This has been consistent for the last 60 years or so.  How much money has been spent in wars, covert actions, maintaining bases and troops overseas?    7. Unemployment is increasing at an unbelievable rate.  Companies are lying off not hundreds, but thousands of people at a time.  This hasn't been seen since the Great Depression.    8. The US government wants to throw money at the problem.  No matter how "careful" it trys to be to "get it to the right people," there is no way that it will help in the long term.  If one looks at government policy during the 1930's, the Depression got worse, not better.|`|5Snex2peaa	YEAH!    Have you been watching the statistics on job losses?  What happens when their unemployment runs out?|`|Y4on1sIIaa	No it's worse.    We have overextended ourselves debt-wise, by having years of low interest rates and high inflation.  The average household savings rate has gone negative in the last year.  The debt-based economy we live in is coming crashing down...  Because there is no TRUST.  Capitalism and freedom require a certain level of trust in other people that we have tapped dry in an effort to enrich the wealthy through corporatism (corporatism is NOT capitalism).  No amount of government subsidization or bailout or "stimulus" can restore trust, because the government is trying to maintain the status quo, which means keeping the untrustworthy rich people (untrustworthy because they are the ones that made the poor decisions) rich.  The only way to restore trust is to let everything unwind, and allow new, competent, management to buy out the rotten management.    All of this will be replaced with either socialism, fascism or, godwilling, a sustainable savings-based capitalism.     The only saving grace for now is that the other countries of the world seem to be equally stupid as us, and are getting dragged down, too.  If they decide to decouple, we will be royally screwed.

oFV48JbGaa	You should realize that there is absolutely nothing wrong with you...The people who are making fun of you are immature and mean spirited. Also realize that no matter how bad you feel, it won't change how others act, so you might as well be happy with yourself.    Nothing is wrong with your body type by the way. Most tall people are ectomorphs (naturally skinny frame) anyways.|`|oYSDEWrfaa	First I would like to apologize for having to go through such unpleasant experiences with your "friends" or acquaintances.     I think it is important you know that most of us got teased or made fun of in one way or another growing up. Many people internalize it and have issues because of it. Often times we use others interactions with us and what others think about us to critique our own selves and the thoughts we have about ourselves. Because of this I feel it is extremely important to start looking at your own view of yourself so that you can believe in yourself and have confidence in yourself enough so that what you are experiencing doesn't affect you to the point of depression. All that matters is how you feel about yourself, start recognizing all the wonderful qualities about you and understand that what others think doesn't really matter. (I know this isn't easy)    By working on your self esteem and realizing that true beauty lies within, you can rise above the negativity and not let this bring you down. This is within your control. People say that "sticks and stones may break your bones but words don't hurt you".   The truth is I think that that saying is a bunch of crap. Some crap talker himself who doesn't want you to hold HIM accountable for the words HE say's probably wrote it. Because it is a lot harder to have self control and watch what comes out of your mouth. It's especially hard to stay true to proper morals, values, and ethics when it seems your under attack by some gossiper... and your not suppose to let it bother you because words don't hurt.     Growing up I'd rather be hit than have someone i care about or consider a friend make fun of me or be verbally abusive. I was quiet as well. I never got too angry even though it hurt me because I realized that those people who were most often making fun were doing so because they THEMSELVES felt insecure. Someone might argue they do it because they can... well that still doesn't make it right.    Regardless you can't control others in that situation but what you can do specifically in that situation is this:    A few tactics you might find yourself able to do. to combat the teasing in the actual moment and possibly make it stop.    1. Crack a joke about yourself even if its a single sentence. I started making fun of myself before anyone else could. I would say hi "im mute girl" nice to meet you quietly but loud enough for them to get the joke. Hahahaha.... by doing this i beat the teasers to the punch line i made fun of myself before they could and people laughed and the teasers no longer were the center of attention. Believe it or not they want attention that's why they do it... poor them.     2. Ignore: no matter how bad it hurts if people notice they get a reaction from you they continue to do it. It's like reinforcement. You can try ignoring them. (this is assuming you have tried to talk to them and tell them how what they say makes you feel and that hasn't worked). Sometimes they might continue on or do it a little more when you first stop reacting but if they get no benefit from it eventually it will subside.     3. Make a joke from their joke. Sometimes I would take their joke and make it even funnier by exaggerating it. I would make it so extreme their joke would look stupid. Let me see an example could be if someone made if someone said I don't look like my brothers or sisters where did I come from i might respond that i always wondered if i was adopted someone lied to me growing up.     4. Make fun of their joke, i was skinny but tall and for some freak reason kids would say i was fat... I would say things like... yes ok we all know your fat joke it's getting old can't you come up with a new one your boring me... or i would say ok sure im fat but I can lose weight too bad there is nothing you can do about your face. I know that was mean but hey they stopped...and it felt good to stick up for myself. Sometimes you just have to stick up for yourself to make them stop. I am not sure what types of people you are dealing with and this tactic is not the first thing i suggest but it is an option.     As far as the Survivor comment that one is unacceptable and it is only a matter of time before someone else speaks up. Everyone who is human should be offended and that is nothing to joke about.    Lastly, try to remember this something my father once told me. He said that at the end of our lives our bodies go away, everyone's body deteriorates in time but the eyes are the windows to the soul and that is what the people closest will see is your face and your eyes. You can't change the look in your eyes so as long as you do your best to be a good person you will remain beautiful inside and out that my friend can't be bought. Everything physical is superficial you are unique there is only ONE you and that is very important to realize because for that matter you are priceless.     I highly suggest reading, writing and taking up recreational|`|UZxeBrxQaa	"To thine own self be true."    Quit trying to please everyone, quit worrying about what other people think.

When they call you names agree, they will lose interest when they think it doesn't bother you.     If they continue, let them, you can't change the way they think, you just have to deal with it. I myself am pale, and quiet, I too am called names, but I just agree with them, and continue my day because I know that I'm more mature than they ever will be.    As for being quite, there is nothing wrong with it, I am the same way, I don't talk a lot for fear of saying something stupid, and because social interaction tires me. Google "Introvert" and read a little bit about them. There's probably a lot more I could tell you but I'm a little scatter brained at the moment, If you need to talk to someone just email me I'd be more than happy to talk to you.
GAswoUXoaa	Embedded deeply in your brain is some experience or thought compulsion that subconsciously comes to mind causing your body to react that way.    You need to ask yourself whether there have been any previous experiences that could cause you to feel this way.

You could search girl, or any other term you think applies to this dream. It's easier for you to determine, because you know exactly what the dream was like and therefore you can figure out any symbols that showed up.  Since it's the girl you like, that just means she's on your subconscious. Maybe this is a sign that you should take the time to make a move and talk to her if you aren't that close, or get to know her even better if you are already friends.

sX9Ilrpxaa	There are some really cool examples of humans adapted to different environments over time by developing different body sizes and shapes. There are some biological "rules" about evolution of shape in geographically widespread species that apply even to humans.    Bergmann's rule states that populations in the warmer parts of the climate range will be smaller-bodied than those in the colder parts of the range.  This is because and increase in size decreases the ratio of surface area to mass. In humans, this relationship is reflected in an increase in the breadth of the trunk.      Allen's rule states that populations living in warm regions will have longer extremities than those living in cold regions for the same reason--it increases their surface area and allows them to dissipate heat more quickly.      This website shows these relationships very well in picture form: http://anthro.palomar.edu/adapt/adapt_2....    Gloger's Rule states that dark pigments increase in populations living in warm and humid habitats.  This is because darker pigments protect from harmful UV rays in tropical areas, and lighter pigments allow for more vitamin D absorption in areas with limited sunlight.     When humans evolved in hot, sunny Africa, they were probably all slender, long-limbed, and dark-skinned (for an example of this phenotype, look at elite Kenyan distance runners... they have the perfect body shape for dissipating unwanted heat quickly). As populations gradually moved away from the equator and into different environments, they began to adapt for better survival.  Scandinavian people are very fair, to absorb the maximum amount of vitamin D (which is essential for your bones) in an area that has little sunlight for much of the year.  Inuits have ideal bodies to survive exposure to extreme cold--they have broad chests and relatively shorter limbs that limit their exposed surface area and thus hold in heat.    However, these rules only work for "native" populations of an area.  An African American's skin isn't dark because he or she needs that protection while living in Michigan, but because his or her ancestors came from Africa where it was needed.  Theses changes take place over thousands of years, and now our modern technology makes much of this unnecessary. With central heating, air conditioning, and sunblock, humans of any shape, size, or color can easily live in any part of the world without disadvantage based on their phenotype.|`|MbRygPqTaa	In my crazy opinion: Adaptations are just Mutations that worked. So to answer your question: There are many variations (or possible mutations) in our genes that we might consider useless or even bad for us. But if some sort of catastrophe happened, maybe super exposure to gamma rays or something, Then when our world is upside down to us, those rare traits might enable a few to survive and that's all you need. But if that same gene pool got hit again, since they had less variation their odds for surviving would decrease.   Or if an ice age came, i bet having hair in your face and every surface of your body might come in handy...  Did you see "hitchhikers guide to the galaxy"? so their explanation is the improbability rule in which the least likely thing to happen is the most probable to happen LOL  I think our world is like that in reality, but we have figured out a way that makes sense to us. am i insane?? :p|`|b129300daffeed1de97214c3e169f039aa	the answer may lay with the darwins evolution theory and survival of the fittest. since organisms have traits which vary over time those who have the best traits suited to the environment will survive and grow. if there was no variation, a disease or environmental change could kill an entire population easily. for example, some people have a residual fat gene which is a sign that previously humans had to deal with extremely cold environments.  there's also something called acclimations, which is pretty much a temporary genetic and physical change to an environment e.g. sweating more if you and your ancestors lived in the dessert.

You really can't be aware of what is going on in your subconscious, hence the name. However, you can learn to do what is called lucid dreaming. You start by recording all of your dreams into a diary every morning after you wake up. This helps dream recall. Also you can do things like reality checks, which make sure you are actually awake. For example, in dreams numbers are often disorted and out of shape. The theory is that if you look at a (digital) clock every hour and ask yourself if you are dreaming, it will be pounded into your subconscious. Then when you are dreaming you will check the clock and be able to tell if you are dreaming or not. This is only one example of a reality check, there are several. I'm not sure if this is the type of response you wanted to hear but that is how you can learn to control your dreams. You can read more about it online, it is very fascinating!

It shows the man is mature enough to be a man.|`|DIFdkwnlaa	are you kidding dude?  these days you tell a chick a joke and she sues you for sexual harassment.  you don't even have to tell it to her.  just let her be within earshot while you're telling a joke to some other dudes and she'll still sue you.  dudes can't do anything around chicks these days.|`|Ao5aSAWiaa	Men should watch what they say because some women can take words the wrong way, but in all, speak to whoever and just be moral.|`|LR48Rtv2aa	Man or woman, I am not comfortable with those I do not know to joke around with me.    Men talking to women in public isn't the problem.  Some men tend to come off a little too aggressive and foward, which could be uncomfortable for anyone.
fEEbx6XTaa	Yes, because I'm quiet and I smile and nod a lot people confide in me. It's fun and interesting. Within 2 days I had a girl telling me her life story. Boys have told me their secret fantasies. People don't really hold things back with me. It's awesome.|`|u6btDDWZaa	To answer your question, sometimes I listen if the topic is interesting to me, if not then, no I don't listen good.|`|eaae12c8744194b4051dee1eb83100fdaa	No, I am trying to improve.|`|ZOFM0g9haa	Yeah I guess so, people tend to tell me about their personal lives, like when working for example, they'll start telling me all this stuff. I guess I have that "trusted brand" face :D
LKY38BNsaa	Yes and No    It was judgemental in a way, but you were just saying what you felt so you shouldnt have to feel bad about it. Go ahead and say "what do you care", because it is your opinion and you have the right to defend it.|`|32b1eb3e26bb881d2726f73d58196d72aa	Well, it seems that you seriously felt that and you said what you felt. So stick to it, and don't over think it. It is their problem if they thought you are too judgmental. If you think you may be, I will have to be a bigger situation to make you realize if you are truly judgmental. Don't worry it was just a music video. = )
a297uH97aa	how long was your holiday? if It was a few weeks well you might be anxious about returning back to work.  Anticipating a load of back logged work, any changes that may have taken place in your absence, new co-workers, missed coffee room banter etc... all this can make you anxious internally in the subconscious whether you realize it or not it will make it difficult to relax completely.  Try having a bath (if your female), read a few pages of a fav book, get your lunch packed and ready, your clothes all pressed and cleaned, things ready to go for when you walk out the door in the morning.  Perhaps by prepping your morning the night before it will relieve a little of the first day back to work morning rush out the door.  Give it a shot!|`|WPsfvhNAaa	This always works for me.  Ok i shut my self in my room and breath through my nose and let air completely fill my lungs and stomach, and then i just let it out and then i just stay in my room alone and quite, it always works on me after i get really stressed out. Hope this helps|`|agpCn6Kaaa	It very well could be the fact that you're anxious about going back to work tomorrow.  That's why most people hate Mondays so much, because the weekend is over and it's back to the grind.|`|q5TchS9jaa	You need to get laid. that should help you relax.
ydPpDXnXaa	Your question is quite a good one- it is definitely possible to have stronger telepathy between two people who spend so much time together. One reason is because the thoughts and feelings in one person's aura or energy field will naturally leak into the other person who spends a lot of time with them. So it's like you become like them and them like you. What looks like mind reading is really you thinking his thoughts because you're feeling what it's like to be him.|`|xPeIvywdaa	sure if you are soul mates|`|SuqYuobdaa	definitely possible

mU2eMSi3aa	Different might be good.  Who really wants to be like everyone else?|`|agpCn6Kaaa	I'm the same way, I think very differently than others, and I always felt like the oddball...but a dear friend once told me that I wasn't strange at all, that my point of view was unique and refreshing...so why change?  (People who change to please others are not truly changing who they are...they're just squashing who they really are and adapting to fit in).|`|UZxeBrxQaa	Trust me, you are not alone.    There are those of us who take the path less traveled, and are the richer for it.  Be yourself.  You may find that being different can be very attractive to some people.|`|oFV48JbGaa	Everybody feels like an outsider at some point. I assume you're in highschool. The highschool years can be rough and students who don't fit into the norm are usually left feeling much like you are right now. Don't worry about it, there's nothing wrong with avoiding harmful substances or taking care of your own body. There are many other people like you out there.|`|p0D4dxEqaa	You sound like me.   All my life I have felt different from most others. I realize that we are all inherently different, but with me....I am way different.    I don't feed into the social norms of this country. I don't follow when I can lead, and I never deviate from my set of morals.    People tend to flock together when they believe and do the same things.    From what you said, I think you are an "old soul" with an intelligent head on your shoulders...........you will go far in this life and others know this......actually they are jealous of you.    ALWAYS....be you.    :)|`|VuGPufs4aa	drinking smoking no drugs very smart . celibacy you will get over that. people will always disagree.and as for people  they  change from moment to moment and if for no other reason just to suit the moment. in this society today  people have absolutely no integrity dont turn your back to anyone .|`|040e4dcd3cea07b8f7b81fad7376600aaa	Trust me...

He lived with five other guys, but at any given time there would be one or two random guys that would stay there for the week. In order to see each other I would have to come over in the early morning between our two jobs and classes. It was that, or we couldnt see each other during the week. He started sleeping out on the couch because his roommate that shared a room with him started a graveyard shift and needed his sleep. One morning, before the sun came up, I had just let myself in to his apartment, and saw that his alarm clock was by the couch so that he wouldnt sleep through class. He hadnt been expecting me so I carefully walked through the pitch black apartment trying not to trip over anything. I wanted to surprise him with a wake up kiss, so I knelt down and started to kiss him. It was turning quite passionate when all of the sudden he went completely rigid. I sat up to see what was wrong and it wasnt my fiance at all. It was some random guy who had just happened to stay overnight. I thought I was going to die! All I could pathetically say was, Sorry, I thought you were my fiance. His reply Well, after he stopped laughing and could finally take a breath said Its all good.    http://www.yourembarrassingmoments.com  http://www.yourembarrassingmoments.com/s...|`|rp372bcYaa	LOL    Thats pretty funny    When i was 16 i was at a swim meet, and they only had porter potties to use.

I turned around, and who would it be but the biggest lineman on their team. He trucked me so bad I had to get taken out of the game. Needless to say, we lost after that.|`|B9pMjUXraa	No I have went on this ride a million times and had not cried but I dont know why but this particular time I did do you know what ride thats was...Its was the ride swings around and around in the air OMG now thats embarrassment I was like 13-15 im 19 now OMG my family was so embarssed...proabably shouldnt have told this one LOL but thanks for my two points!!!!!
b4752e984bf2707701387025a836d107aa	Of course, the way you can be content and confident in yourself is to worry less, appreciate what you already have and finally, love your friends and family as much as they love you. Well yeah, there are a lot of things that add up to how you can be content and confident in yourself - I just listed some easy ways.    What is your favourite hobby? Who do you like talking to? What do you enjoy listening to? Where's your favourite place? If you keep doing things you like, then life wouldn't be so dead for you. Why do things that you don't have a passion for? Hope you don't drop school though, because education is a passport to everything.    Have you though about the 'other keys' to happiness by the way? You don't have to always look at the first key to happiness. In my opinion, I believe being grateful and appreciate everything you have is absolutely the first key to happiness. At the same time, you'd feel confident and very thankful for what you have.|`|5EFHyGVbaa	I recommend you check out this social networking community called LetsReflect.com. There are people there going through situations similar to yours. They are great for advice and encouragement.     The process of Self Reflection has truly changed my life.heres my profile. http://www.letsreflect.com/profile.php?u...     The trick is staying positive and surrounding yourself with positive people. You are capable of great things! I believe in you. Best of luck.|`|K1wNA5r3aa	First of all, this might sound strange since I have no idea what you look like but trust me when I say, you're beautiful. Girls just don't hear that enough. They're told they have to be stick figures with perfect features but that's not realistic.    Think about it this way. Do you really think the opinions of your peers will make a real impact on the important things in life? People can talk trash all they want but it's very unlikely it will determine if you get a good job, get into a good school, have a family, etc.    Everyone has good qualities. Every day, write down one of your good qualities in a journal. Keep it and look back on it. Have a positive outlook on things. There is always a silver lining.    Go get a new haircut, a manicure or a hot new outfit. Or heck, all 3. Sometimes just treating yourself to something nice will give you a big boost.
ToILKl6waa	When talking in a group, don't think of it as a group. Think of it as your usual one on one conversations, just happening all at once. Don't let yourself worry about silly things - if you are comfortable talking to just one person, you should have no trouble with more than one at a time. They're all people, just like you and a group should not change the way you see or act towards them.     PS: Introverts win against all else!

The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning; but the heart of fools is in the house of mirth.    It is better for a man to hear the rebuke of the wise than to hear the song of fools."

You ccan learn to relate to other people, understand other people better.   I highly value experience--I think our experiences help shape us into who we are. The experiences that you have, and how you react to them, they help shape you into who you are, preferably a better person.
ad7ae5e8f17688d3566fad454e8fc09baa	This sounds like anxiety to me. If you're ok with it, don't worry about it. If you're worried about it, see your doctor or a psychiatrist and they can put you on anti-anxiety meds. I have the same problem and meds work for me!;
ZOXoPgJbaa	A. Frictionally.    If you just enter the market you are frictionally unemployed. also if you leave one job to go into the other you are frictionally employed.  structurally unemployed is if your job becomes obselete    cyclically unemployed is if you are a snowboard instructor and its summer time.

But if that were the case, yeah I suppose the metal would be worth more than the value of the currency itself.|`|sTSBk9jhaa	If there us hyper inflation the worth of the metal of the money will be greater than the money worth itself.

ENFRJnWeaa	First off i wanted to say im sorry for your hardships.  Take it from someone who suffered a lot in the past and hurt a lot people i should have never hurt!     I hope i can help with some advice that i have mediated on a lot in the past few years....    first thing ALWAYS have FAITH, a man without faith is a man that will lead himself to his doom...please trust in the Lord and ask for guidance    Sort yourself together, often people are soooo worried about their problems that they do stupid things, the drink, they think at drugs will help them avoid problem but that only leads to making things worst!    DO NOT COMMIT TO DRUGS    take your losses as an opportunity to make yourself stronger, we can always learn from our mistakes....    a sidenote, everyone says that it is okay to make mistakes, that is perfectly find, but it is as important to LEARN from them!     dont make a mistake to do day and say that tomoro you will correct it,    CORRECT IT TODAY    find what you like in life, find something that will inspire you, bring joy, and passion back in your life    remember theres always a light at the end of the tunnel, if there is no light it is not the end!    and it is not the end for you my friend you have a great life waiting for you!! just believe and strive to achieve    the road will be tuff to climb but we can all do this!!    theres a little verse that i always refer to in the Bible when i am down and i think theres no hope in doing anything    "What is impossible for men, is possible with GOD"      thats why i said in the beginning believe and have faith!! everything happens for a reason and he knows it    Best of luck to you!! =]|`|b919231cdc9dcf8edee5a210e4d7a40faa	Spiritual and physical problems exist so that we can overcome them and become stronger than we ever were before. It's important that we learn from our missteps to prevent us from making the same mistake twice. I was in a bad car accident a few years ago and when I woke up from the coma with a memory condition, no balance and seeing double I felt as if the paramedics had no right to bring me back to life. Looking back I feel foolish for not being thankful for what I had, anything should have looked good after seven days of darkness but instead of looking at what I had in front of me I looked back to what I had before the accident. Suicide is never a solution to any problem, it's a way out of a life that a person has forsaken, please don't turn down the most precious gift of all. Keep your head up and count your blessings and not your problems my friend.    Bob Dylan said that his father once told him that "in this world a man can be so lost that even his own father will turn his back on him, but God will never turn his back on you." Take everything one step at a time, start by being thankful for this life you've been given and take comfort in the simple things. Shoot me a message if you want to brother.|`|qL3dGTXDaa	You declare that enough is enough, and get yourself into some support group so that there will be structure for you to put your life back together. Besides, what you are dealing with is nothing compared to most people in the world, including right here at home.|`|K1wNA5r3aa	I'd have to know a little more about you to tell you what's going on. If you have a pastor or someone you admire spiritually, it would really help to talk to them. If you're not already, get involved with a church. A lot of churches have different outreach programs you can join and you will be surprised at how good helping somebody else will make you feel. I don't believe this is payment for your sins. We all go through rough spots like this. But never give up. Continue to pray and reach out. I'll pray for you too. Feel free to email me if you need someone to talk to.
WnMoKasqaa	The reason substances such as Marijuana, DMT, LSD, Peyote, and Psilocybin Mushrooms are illegal is because the government would likely gain only marginal profits if it were to sell such products is because for the most part many of these substances are easy to produce at home (Marijuana, Peyote, and Psilocybin can all be grown at home, indoors/outdoors). Their is the exception of LSD and DMT, which do require time and equipment if they're attempted to be produced at home.     Alcohol and tobacco give the US government huge profits each year, up to $18.7 billion for alcohol and $7.7 billion for tobacco. Since very large profits are made off of these products, the U.S. would have no incentive to stop their production.    At least Salvia is still legal (I wonder how long that will last though...)|`|EmgiGg17aa	Easy.  The government does not have control on it (for taxation purposes)  They got to get their rightful share of tax money.     Besides that, it is illegal to kill yourself(or maim yourself, or cripple).  They do not want you to be a vegetable on society.  The government can't get tax money from a vegetable.  You will cost them.|`|oFV48JbGaa	Even a psychoactive substance such as marijuana can cause underlying mental illness to manifest themselves. The most notable one is schizophrenia.    For many people, hallucinogens and other mind altering substances are near harmless. However, for many other people, it cause cause a great deal of damage and psychological problems.

mU2eMSi3aa	This is really good and you should share the love and happiness with the rest of your family.  Often they for some reason are blocked from accepting the dreams so they can't have the same contact that you do.  Don't worry about not being able to remember much from the dreams this usually comes with the gift of contact with the dead because some memories might influence our lives in a way that we are not ready for yet.  Enjoy them while you can and be happy that you had them but don't attach yourself too much to them because they will come and go and sometimes for a long time in between.  Be happy to know that you have that link and cherish it.      Also don't worry about others not having the dreams.  I for a long time did not have contact with those who passed and I was jealous of my family who had seen loved ones after they died.  Eventually I reached a point on my spiritual path were I could accept it and so I was granted contact also.  Sometimes it just takes a while.

Ask God to help heal, teach, and guide you while your body rests at night.  Beyond clearer dreams, in which one's awareness is more "there," are also further states of clarity, which may not be accessible to outer waking consciousness.

Sorry for your loss.|`|QTWGaT6gaa	Maybe it is his way of telling you not to be sad because he is happy where he is now.|`|VK5woom4aa	Everyone handles death differently. The subconscious mind allows to you feel through your dreams. This could be a way of your mind saying you are getting stronger so you don't need to focus as much on his death. It is nice to have these dreams every once in a while to remember those memories but if you constantly had them, you would miss those times even more.

IJC6NRuCaa	Totally happens to me. Deja voo! haha the same EXACT thing! its crazy!    A theory i heard before is that sometimes the let hemisphere and right hemisphere aremilliseconds apart in recieving the information provided by your senses, so lets say you see a guy standing on the corner, the left hemisphere instantly gets the image and process it, but nano seconds later the right hemisphere finally gets the scene, causing the feeling that "Happened before" and it hasnt, but your brain thinks it did, just miliseconds before.|`|9iIPjUG2aa	it happened to me all the time, don't worrying about it. some say its just that you're too stressed out so u have these weird sights. i dunno, i personally like it, i love how i can zone out sometimes....lucky lucky|`|RWgjnwl9aa	Deja Vu  happens when our minds sort of jump ahead before the actual  scene is played out I've read it's as fast as a blink of an eye I get  these sometimes I think most people do  it's really a wild & freaky feeling though|`|380b53c18cfb9588bad18dd0f231a984aa	"The Strange Life of Ivan Osokin," P.

AS8V9rAFaa	I am no expert but I learned about them in psych 101 last quarter... They are subjective personality tests used by a therapist or psychiatrist or whatever to gain insight into the patient's personality or psyche or whatever you want to call it    Rorschach inkblot test: ambiguous "inkblot" shapes. the patient says what the shape appears to be to them and then the person administrating the test interprets the answers    Thematic Apperception Test: A picture, more specifically some kind of "freeze-frame" kind of image, usually of one or more people, my professor showed us a lot of different examples. The patient describes what they think is going on in the scene. Since the picture is usually pretty ambiguous they could be interpreted in a bunch of different ways by different people    Both of these depend on how the person interprets what they see. the test administrator gains insight into ways of thinking, perception, assumptions, etc|`|MuodApG7aa	Rorschach was invented in the 1920's before TV, and people still believed in spacemen from outer space.    It's nothing other than people who call themselves professionals to pretend they know something others doesn't know. Like interpreting dreams.    Psychology has never moved forward because of these pseudoscience inventions and that is the reason the best they can do is treat depression.     It uses vague, exaggerated and untestable claims and is protected from testing by other experts. IOW, Psychobabble.     It is much easier to ask the patient if the wall ever talks to them, and eliminate all the silly Rorschach testing. IOW, if you don't have a clue about the patient in about 15 minutes, you will not have a clue using the Rorschach test.    Anyway, those inkblots only depict grotesque and monstrous perverted sexual acts that is not natural and not something someone should be exposed to except for torture, to find out if they are planning a terrorist act.     The TAT test just depict grotesque and monstrous perverted sexual acts and is really a turn-on if you're wearing a scuba suit... but most won't let you take the test while wearing one.    I would say on a scale of 1 to 10 the characteristics of both tests to be a 5... give or take a couple.    So JoAnna... why do you hate your mother?    Is it one of an gender identity disorder, naming you both a boy and a girl?    But I say, go ahead and take the test... it probably will give you a lot of insight into yourself and they might give you chlordiazepoxide, which is what we all want anyway, right?

I think it is like men with breasts...men don't have them so they want to touch ours.  Women will never have a shaved head so they want to touch yours.|`|AA11411121	Because it looks cute...|`|AA12035896	Because it's not often we get a shaved head to rub.  Usually it's covered with hair.  And the skin is so soft.|`|9375a7878d52ba7f132dc2c02a243040aa	Women by nature are more affectionate. Although some of the answers go back to sexual conotations, I do not believe that is the case. It is just a nice feel and you cannot mess up your hair. It is just simply of expression of their affection or liking towards you.|`|AA12285971	i hate bold or shaved heads...i need to have some thick but short hair!
