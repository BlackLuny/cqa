AA10655250	Yes, the enacted major reforms to the country but, were unable to keep control of their colony which proved to be unprofitable.    Socially, the Germans believed that the Tutsi were of a superior race because they were taller, had more "eloquent" personalities, many readily converted to Roman Catholicism, and their people originally came from the Horn of Africa which was considered "more European" than the origination sites of the Hutus.     Politically, the borders of the colony were established in 1890.  London and Berlin concluded the Heligoland-Zanzibar Treaty, a deal that gave Heligoland to Germany, and defined the limits of German East Africa but,the exact borders remained ill-defined until 1910.    Economically, commerce and growth started in earnest under German direction. Two million coffee trees were planted and rubber trees grew on 200,000 acres (80,000 hectares ), along with large cotton plantations.     To bring these agricultural products to market, beginning in 1888, the Usambara Railway, or Northern Railroad, was built from Tanga to Moshi. Harbor facilities were built or improved with electrical cranes, with rail access and warehouses. Wharves were remodeled at Tanga, Bagamoyo and Lindi. Despite all these efforts, German East Africa never achieved a profit for the German Empire and needed to be subsidized by the Berlin treasury.    See the links below for additional information.  Hope this helps.

i0ypGmlQaa	Yes. It is absolutely the same probability.    For a simple example, what is the probability of flipping a coin and getting the set of results (H=heads, T=tails) of:    HHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH    That's 20 flips, so the chances are (1/2)^20    That's not very likely, because 20 heads in a row is extremely rare. HOWEVER it is just as rare as the case:    HTHTTHTHHTHTHHTHTHTT    Why? Because that's 20 flips, and at each flip, the chances of matching this outcome are 1/2, meaning again the probability is (1/2)^20.    However, you can describe different kind of coin-flip outcomes. For example, the chances of getting 10 heads is better than the chances of getting 20 heads, because while each sequence has the same probability, there are MANY sequences that give you 10 heads -- there's only one with 20 heads (the "all heads" sequence).    Similarly, while the specific combination 01 02 03 04 05 06 is just as likely as 04 08 12 24 37 41, one "seems" more random than the other because it is more likely that the numbers are not consecutive. Of the 50C6 possible outcomes, only 44 of them have all six numbers consecutive. Thus you expect to hardly ever see a consecutive set of numbers picked.    BUT that doesn't change the fact that a SINGLE outcome like 01 02 03 04 05 06 is the same probability as any other SINGLE outcome. Only the fact that a particular "type" of outcome is more likely (on the whole) than another "type" -- if the one type is more common than the other.    To MathMan:    That's an interesting idea, however, it is not actually winning (or even advantageous) strategy. Why? Because as soon as more than one person uses your strategy, it becomes more likely to fail! How to pick a unique (or if not unique, less frequently picked) number (or combination of numbers) has no possible advantageous strategy, because such a strategy would be self-defeating (and hence self-contradictory).|`|hHVMrnK3aa	Here is another aspect to the question:    First, in terms of likelihood of being the winning numbers,  "all numbers are created equal" (as long as the drawing process is  fair and random).    So 1 2 3 4 5 6 is just as likely or unlikely as any other set of 6 numbers.    But, in fact, there is an advantage to choosing such numbers.    The reason is this:  the likelihood of their being the winning numbers is equal,  but the likelihood that someone else picked them is not !    The secondary reason is what you state: they "seem less   random" and people shy away from picking them.    Therefore, if you do pick those numbers, and you do happen to win,  it is less likely that you will have to split the jackpot with others.    That makes your expected prize bigger, even though it doesn't  improve your chances of winning.    All that said, the best strategy with the lottery is not to play,  because the chances are you will simply lose your money,  no matter which numbers you choose.|`|wBbasieQaa	Yes. In any fair lottery the chances of any given sequence are identical to the chances of any other given sequence.

Let its mass be M. and V be its volume.   Law of floatation tells us  Weight, therefore mass, too of wooden block = Weight therefore mass too of water displaced. So we have   M = (12-X)x10^-3xAx1000; V = 12x10^-3xA, As we know M = Vxdensity  or M = (12-x)A = 12xAx10^-3x900 or (12-x)/12 = 0.9 or  1 - x/12 = 0.9 or x/12 = 0.1 or x = 1.2 mm    Similarly when 5 mm layer of oil is spread, let y mm be the distance of the top of cube from the top surface of liquid.

Sounds like bullshit.  See if you can track down the reference.    The Leake reference isn't a journal article--it's a newspaper article with a broken link.  Newspaper writers tend to sensationalize and to not know what they're talking about.  They'll take an entanglement effect or a group velocity effect and interpret that as something moving faster than light.  This guy's other articles in the last week include one on why women have more orgasms with rich men.  That says it all I think.    --V, the links you put up are prime examples of sensationalism--trying to play up an experimental result by claiming it's groundbreaking or controversial.  It isn't.  Scythian's links are good--the effect is just a group velocity that travels faster than c.  It can't carry information.

I think it may be possible.    The human mind seems to thirst for knowledge and it is completely satisfied once it believes it has finally found the answer it's been looking for.    It may also explain why the mind is unwilling to expand on or reject the truths it believed it discovered, be it from religion or science or tradition.|`|DRVSCxKpaa	Personally, I can never understand the 'conflict' between religion and science.  Science is based on prediction and testing; religion is based on faith.  There is no conflict between the two; except that the controversy has been exacerbated by religious fundamentalists on one side and science reactionaries on the other.

tDvyf3Q5aa	check this one:   Ln(6x)/x dx     let m = x therefore:  dm = (1/2x) dx or:  2m dm = dx    now rewriting it using m:   Ln(6x)/x dx =   2m * Ln(6m2) / m dm =    Ln(6m2) dm     as far as I remember we have equations like:  Ln xy = Ln x + Ln y  Ln x^y = y * Ln x     so we can write Ln(6m2) as Ln(6) + 2Ln(m) . back to the integral:   Ln(6m2) dm =   (Ln(6) + 2Ln(m)) dm =   Ln(6) * m +  2Ln(m) dm     also we know:   Ln(x) dx = xLn(x) -x    thus the final answer would be:  Ln(6) * m +  2Ln(m) dm =  Ln(6) * m + 2*(mLn(m) -m) =  Ln(6) * x + 2*(xLn(x) -x)     all you need to do is to put limits, 0 and 6. though I am not sure all my assumptions are correct, so please double check yourself.

AA10927246	Here's my answer (the only one possible):  3,816,547,290    Double-check:  3 / 1 = 3  38 / 2 = 19  381 / 3 = 127  3816 / 4 = 954  38165 / 5 = 7633  381654 / 6 = 63609  3816547 / 7 = 545221  38165472 / 8 = 4770684  381654729 / 9 = 42406081  3816547290 / 10 = 381654729    Our final goal is a number of the form ABCDEFGHIJ where A is divisible by 1, AB is divisible by 2, etc. all the way up to 10.    We know that ABCDEFGHIJ must be a multiple of 10, so J must be 0.  We know that ABCDE must be a multiple of 5, so E must be 5.    AB, ABCD, ABCDEF, ABCDEFGH are multiples of 2, 4, 6 and 8 respectively. Thus their last digits (B, D, F and H) must be even. That leaves 1, 3, 7 and 9 for A, C, G and I.    ABCD is a multiple of 4, so CD must be a multiple of 4. Given that C is odd, the possible values are {12, 16, 32, 36, 72, 76, 92 and 96}. That means D must be 2 or 6.    Similarly ABCDEFGH is a multiple of 8 (and therefore 4). Using similar logic, GH will be in {12, 16, 32, 36, 72, 76, 92 and 96}. Therefore H must be 2 or 6.    Because 2 and 6 are accounted for, B and F must be 4 and 8. That means FGH will be {412, 416, 432, 436, 472, 476, 492, 496, 812, 816, 832, 836, 872, 876, 892 or 896}.    But FGH needs to be a multiple of 8 as well as a multiple of 4. The only multiples of 8 are {416, 472, 496, 816, 872 or 896}    ABC is a multiple of 3 so its digits must add to be a multiple of 3. Possible choices are {147, 183, 189, 381, 387, 741, 783, 789, 981, 987}    ABCDEF is a multiple of 6 and therefore also a multiple of 3. Given that ABC already adds to a multiple of 3, we only need to check DEF. E is 5. Possible choices for DEF are {258, 654}    Putting things together we have a couple possible patterns:  A-4-C-2-5-8-G-6-I-0  or  A-8-C-6-5-4-G-2-I-0    That reduces the set of choices for FGH to {472, 816, 896}    So the 3 possible patterns are now:  A-4-C-2-5-8-1-6-I-0  A-4-C-2-5-8-9-6-I-0  A-8-C-6-5-4-7-2-I-0    Looking at our set of possible values for ABC we have {147, 183, 189, 381, 387, 741, 783, 789, 981, 987}. If B = 4, then ABC is either {147 or 741}. That eliminates the first string. If B = 8, all the values using 7 are eliminated.    So now we have:    {147 or 741}  1-4-7-2-5-8-9-6-I-0  7-4-1-2-5-8-9-6-I-0    {183, 189, 381, 981}  1-8-3-6-5-4-7-2-I-0  1-8-9-6-5-4-7-2-I-0  3-8-1-6-5-4-7-2-I-0  9-8-1-6-5-4-7-2-I-0    Okay there are 6 sequences to check to see if ABCDEFG is a multiple of 7.  1472589 / 7 = 210369.857142...  7412589 / 7 = 1058941.285714...  1836547 / 7 = 262363.857142...  1896547 / 7 = 270935.285714...  3816547 / 7 = 545221  9816547 / 7 = 1402363.857142...    As you can see only one is evenly divisable by 7.   3816547    That's part of this pattern:  3-8-1-6-5-4-7-2-I-0    I is 9. Obviously the nine digits (1 to 9) add up to 45, so ABCDEFGHI will be a multiple of nine regardless.

MAruysqiaa	The answer is undeniably no.      If a planet the size of the proposed Planet X existed, it would be easily visible with even small amateur telescopes.  So, you may hear or read a lot about Nibiru or whatever, but just ask those people one question.  What is the RA/Dec of the planet tonight?  Or tomorrow.  Or 2012.  Or whenever.  No one has an answer.  This isn't something that the government can cover up.  Just go and buy a telescope and  CCD camera.  You can survey the sky yourself, and you'll find no missing planet of that size and orbit.      Furthermore, if the Planet X exists and will make a near-miss or collide with Earth in 2012, then it MUST BE VISIBLE NOW!  Think about it.  If it is currently outside the orbit of Pluto, then it will take FAR longer than 3 years to get here.  For instance, it takes Pluto 248 years to orbit the Sun one time.  Even Jupiter takes 11 years.  Now, I know the planet could be on a very elliptical orbit, but even a comet is visible at the distance of Saturn, and comets are tiny and nearly completely black (low albedos).  But a massive planet (say the mass of Pluto) should easily be seen (I mean we can see Pluto, right?) Incidentally, Pluto was found with a 24", an instrument that would cost you now-adays a few thousand dollars.      So again, if a rogue body the size of Pluto or larger were out there, we'd have seen it by now.  Not to mention, if a body that large existed, we'd have detected the gravitational effects.  Lastly, these effects (viewing it and gravitational) are not something that any goverment with any amount of money can cover up.  Mostly, because anyone, ANYONE, with a 8-24" telescope could verify it.|`|UAYzLyN4aa	If there were such a planet, then the orbits of the outer planets would still be perturbed from its most recent visit. Do not discount the effects of such - remember that tiny little Pluto was discovered due to discrepancies in the observed orbits of Neptune and Uranus.     In addition, accepted theories about solar system formation don't seem to allow for such a possibility. There just isn't any reason for large objects to form orbits other than nearly-circular.|`|jcwLY9DOaa	ok ive been doing a lot of looking a round about this myself and from what ive found is that the ppl that believe in Nibiru or planet x are the ones that seem to know its out there and that the government is keeping it a secret because it is suppose to hit us or pass near us and mess up the world but i havent found any thing like NASA saying its true.|`|XBpfbjCiaa	No|`|AA10253095	Well it is alleged that there might be a Planet X that orbits the solar system in an 800 year cycle but it has never been proved or disproved.|`|jSPj3S6faa	I don't have an answer for this and thus it can be my question also.  I do not need to believe in such a thing.  I just wonder if such a thing could be.  After all, comets do this kind of thing.  What would prevent an extremely large object from doing this?  We do not care if there really is one.  We do not care if such a thing could not form in the early solar system.  Could such a thing maintain such an orbit?  Is it that there is an upper limit to the size of a astronomical body adhering to such a wild orbit?

If you are asking the same questions in the same manner with the same sample size, then yes, higher confidence levels are more informative. However, a poll with a sample size of 5000 demographically chosen for diversity and a confidence level of 90% may offer more information than a poll of 5000 randomly or selectively chosen with a 99% confidence level.( For example, a presidential poll on Republicannation.com would probably have given a 99% confidence level that McCain would win with at least 53% of the vote, so confidence levels should only be used as a comparison between polls done in the same way with the same sample sizes)|`|02D9xaDdaa	First off, let me preface by saying did you take a few minutes to just think about the question.

vEqUqlliaa	Its Kyoto protocol and not kyopo protocol.     The Kyoto Protocol is an international agreement linked to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The major feature of the Kyoto Protocol is that it sets binding targets for 37 industrialized countries and the European community for reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions .These amount to an average of five per cent against 1990 levels over the five-year period 2008-2012.    The major distinction between the Protocol and the Convention is that while the Convention encouraged industrialised countries to stabilize GHG emissions, the Protocol commits them to do so.    Recognizing that developed countries are principally responsible for the current high levels of GHG emissions in the atmosphere as a result of more than 150 years of industrial activity, the Protocol places a heavier burden on developed nations under the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities.    The Kyoto Protocol was adopted in Kyoto, Japan, on 11 December 1997 and entered into force on 16 February 2005. 184 Parties of the Convention have ratified its Protocol to date. The detailed rules for the implementation of the Protocol were adopted at COP 7 in Marrakesh in 2001, and are called the Marrakesh Accords.

JwPu0XbIaa	Here's how I learned to do dimensional conversion problems.  If you understand this method, you will be able to do any dimensional conversion.    First we find out how many seconds there are in a week.  We do this by starting with 1 week, then multiplying by 1 repeatedly.  Multiplying by 1 doesn't change a quantity, so we can do it as many times as we like, and still be assured of having the same thing we started with.    Now, we're not really multiplying by plain old "1", but rather by something which is equivalent to 1.  For example, we know that 2/2 = 1, and 0.3/0.3 = 1.  In other words, we know that dividing a quantity by itself gives us 1 (unless that quantity was zero).    That means we can do things like this:  (60 seconds) / (1 minute) = 1  (1 minute) / (60 seconds) = 1  (1 day) / (24 hours) = 1  (24 hours) / (1 day) = 1  and so on.    So, we start with our initial value of 1 week, then we multiply by 1 repeatedly:    (1 week) * (7 days / 1 week) * (24 hours / 1 day) * (60 minutes / 1 hour) * (60 seconds / 1 minute)    If you look closely, you'll see that we have units of "weeks" in both the numerator and denominator of the terms, so those units cancel each other out.  And notice how I chose to multiply by (7 days / 1 week), and not by (1 week / 7 days).  Both choice are equally valid, but only the first choice allows me to cancel the units of "weeks".    If you understand how to choose between those two options, then the rest is easy:    Days, hours, and minutes also cancel this way, and we are left with:    (1) * (7/1) * (24/1) * (60/1) * (60 seconds / 1)    The units of "seconds" didn't cancel, because they are only in the numerator, not in the denominator.  Multiplying everything out, we obtain the answer: 604800 seconds    If the message repeats every 57 seconds, we can find the number of times it was repeated by dividing 1 week by the time per message cycle:    604800 seconds / 57 seconds = 10610.526    The message cycle completed 10610 times, and part of another cycle began.|`|cviAC50daa	Hey, a good question indeed....!    See, the message repeats every 57 secs. so, in  a day, it occurs (24 hrs. x 60 mins. x 60 secs.) / (57 secs.) = 1515.79 times.  So, in week, i.e. in 7 days, it occurs (7 x 1515.79) = 10610.53 times..  Thus, it repeats 10611 times (approx.) a week !    Thanx..Good Luck ..!|`|6bca9f7fb5c095a46621e8ac664fc41faa	1W(7days/W)(24 hrs/day)(60sec/hr)(1 time/57sec) = 10610 times  --------  Ideas: In dimensional analysis, you 'add' chains to convert units from one to the other.|`|hWsNrDNUaa	7 days in a week, 24 hrs in a day, 60 minutes in an hr, 60 seconds in a minute  60 x 60 = 3600 seconds in an hr   3600 x 24 = 86400 seconds in a day   86400 x 7 = 604800 seconds in a week  604800/57 = 10610.53 times => 10610 times, can't round up because the message there wasn't enough time for the message to fully appear again.

There are 60 seconds per min, 60 min per hour, 24 hours per day, 7 days a week. So just use those, starting with your 57 seconds tidbit, and you'll be fine. And don't forget to cancel out your units. Here's how it goes:    57 sec * 60 sec/min * 60 min/h * 24 h/day * 7 days/week = 34473600 times that sign flashes. Wow.|`|KY3o5T5Daa	First we have to count no. of seconds in a week.  In a minute there are 60 secs.  So, in an hour there are 60*60 secs. That is 3600.  So in a day there are 3600*24 secs. That is 86400.  So in a week there are 86400*7 secs. That is 604800 secs.  Dividing it by 57 we get, 10610.526.  But messages displayed cannot be in decimals.  So 10610 is possible as it is the nearest whole number to it.   Answer-10610.

Also since it is gives the magnitude of charge flowing per unit time it has nothing to do with the direction. If you still have any doubts you can check it from H.C. Verma's Concepts of Physics for +1.     But if you are not satisfied with above description in that case only you can write your answer as:           * In DC current is scalar           * In AC current is vector    -mohit|`|WlssmGzRaa	Electric Current is neither a Scalar Quantity nor a Vector Quantity    To be a vector, the quantity must have two important properties     >> It must have a specific Direction and    >> It must obey the Triangle law of Addition of Vectors.    Though Electric Current has a specific direction, it does not follow the triangle law of addition.  You don't add two currents by resolving them into components and do all that stuff...  you just add them by simple arithmetic rules.  That means that current does not follow the basic laws of Vectors so it is not a Vector, but it is not a scalar either because it has a direction.    Such Quantities which have Direction but do not follow the triangle law of addition are Known as Tensor Quantities.    Hence Electric current is a Tensor Quantity.

92f97d29e3d55f3219cc25dfabd347c7aa	This is a classic problem in elementary gravitational mechanics.  If you ignore air resistace, the force of gravity inside the planet is linear (like a spring), so the dropped object goes into simple harmonic motion.  It falls from one side clear to the other and back again.    In reality, air will slow down the falling object so that it won't get anywhere near the other side of the earth.    GL--you've never actually worked out the problem apparently.  The force is linear.  What you said about the effect of mass "outside" of you is correct.  So the mass "inside" you goes like r^3.  Meanwhile, Newon's law of gravitation gives you a 1/r^2.  So the final result is a linear restoring force, just like a spring.|`|gOEzo2gSaa	no, it would not. Because you need to think of what gravity is: something being pulled to the center of the earth, not necessarily "down" or "in the direction dropped"  So, it would go to the center of the earth and stop, and after that who knows.  Maybe it would "explode" and be pulled into a million pieces. This would be because everything is pulling on everything else, for example, i have gravitational pull on people around me, but the only thing stopping you two from slamming right into each other is the gravity of the earth (because lets face it, earth has a lot of gravity and mass)  so when there is zero gravity at the center, whats to stop it then?  In any case, it would go to the center, stop, and then what else, i don't know.|`|84b72cbc29fc6680caaddb02a5146f02aa	Bekki's right. If the only force you consider is gravity, then the object would fall and accelerate towards the center and then continue through the other way decelerating. When it exited, it would "fall" again and oscillate through the globe.|`|V4oqAHDqaa	Bekki is right.    When the object, mass m, is at distance r from the centre (pretending that the density of the earth is uniform; call it D)    Attracting mass = Dr^3    Attracting force = -Gm1m2/r^2 = -Gm*Dr^3/r^2 = -GmDr    Acceleration = -GDr     Mathematically, the problem is exactly like a body on a spring, or the swing of a pendulum with small amplitude.    But even without that, thinking about conservation of energy would show that the movement of the particle up from the centre must be the mirror image of what happened when it fell down towards the centre, so it would re-emerge at the far end, take one look around it, and go straight down again like a groundhog.
uPVnqbE8aa	Yes, Ants have eyes.  But, even though, don't need them when in their nests deep underground.  Their antennae have incredibly high sense organs on them which they use to smell, feel, and find their way around.  Even if they "were" blind, they'd be fine.  Most all insects have eyes, some better than others, but they have them nevertheless.  They have two compound eyes of many facets, with four other simple eyes which differentiate light from dark.  In the Praying Mantis, the two large compound eyes are to the side and help with their binocular vision to judge distance so they can better grab their prey.  Their simple eyes are between the compound eyes and look like little jewels crowning their foreheads.|`|b9c206476271de6c0a321ebe042eb7f6aa	> do ants have eyes?  Most do.

The typical arrangement for an insect in the adult stage is two compound eyes, and three ocelli - which are like simple eyes on the forehead, mostly used to help orient the insect during flight.    Not all species of ants have all of them.  The worker ants of many species do not have the ocelli, and there are some species that are totally blind - no eyes at all (although this is more common in termites than ants).    The insects are a very diverse group, and while most have eyes, not all do.    There are also differences between larval and adult insects.  Many species have only simple eyes as larvae - detecting little more than light and dark, and only get true eyes as adults.|`|o53n3PVbaa	yeah they do|`|AA10950898	Ants have two eyes and most other insects have 2 eyes also.|`|AA12318686	I guess all insects have eyes.

I0XEVeUxaa	CO2 in the blood actually is required for you to breathe.  There are chemoreceptors in the carotid artery that are sensitive to the amount of dissolved CO2 in the blood, and they stimulate the respiratory center in the pons of the brain to initiate inhalation.  So that is ONE reason.    Another is that the blood is buffered by the equilibrium between CO2 in dissolved in the blood and bicarbonate.  The CO2 in blood is also in equilibrium with CO2 in the gas phase in the alveoli of the lungs.  Blowing off too much CO2 can make the blood alkaline (respiratory alkalosis), whereas retaining too much might make it acidic (respiratory acidosis).    CO2 is detectable using infrared absorption, so machines that measure it are essentilly infrared spectrometers.  Another sort of CO2 trap for measuring it is shown and illustrated on the web page below.    CO2 makes up 4% of exhaled air  (sometimes expressed as millimeters of mercury [mm Hg]...if 1 atmosphere = 760 mm Hg at sea level, this is 0.04 * 760 mm Hg = 30 mm Hg).  In normal air (that is, inhaled air), CO2 is 1/100 of that value (about 0.030-0.40%, or 0.3 mm Hg).  So the CO2 coming out of our blood raises the level of CO2 about 100 times compared to inhaled air.

Here are some rules :    Rule 1 :     Read the the problem through until you understand it     Rule 2:     Find out what the problem is asking you to solve for    Rule 3:     Write down what is given , like variables terms, equation and write down what your sloving for ( I give you a example below)     Rule 4:     Set up you problem     Rule 5:     Rearrange the equation or formula if necessary ( write down step by step; what operation your using to solve the problem. ) if you have to arrange it from the orignal equation .    Rule 6:     Write down step by step; what operation your using to solve the problem -this will make it easier to back track and trouble shoot what you did wrong; if the results don't work out.    Rule 7 :      WATCH THE SIGNS ON THE NUMBERS OR VARIABLE - (I use Caps to make this very import point because a lot people - me include - make this mistake)       Also don't worry about negative signs ( Just work the problem through. It will work out, Okay - A lot people worry about this too much )     Rule 8:     When you finally get your answer, Prove your answer by writing "Proof:" and repeat rule 3 through 7 ( see the example below )     Rule 9:     If answers on the proof equal each other than move on to the next problem if not; back track and find where you made your error and correct it. Than redo the problem and  the proof with the corrected result or value      Rule 10:     when you got extra time; check the problem again      example :     John need a square  box to hold 200 cubic inches of water (remember that V= s^3 ; s is in inches) . How big should the side of the box be?     1. Follow rule   1     Rule 2 :     Given     V= s ^ 3 , V= 200 inches, and where sloving for s     Rule 3 through 7:     V = s^3 - orginal equation     200 = s^3 - subsittution     cuberoot (200) = cube root (s ^ 3) - using the inverse of a cube to remove the cube to slove for s     5.848036 = s ( solving the cube root and I rounded it to 6 decimal place for the numberic part )     s = 5.848036 inches - Rearranged the problem and add the unit     Rule 8:    Proof :     Prove that s^3 = V when s = 5.848036 inches and V= 200cubic inches is true for the equation V= s^3     Rule 2     Given:     V= s^3, s = 5.848036 , V= 200;  Where trying to see if they equal each other        Rule 3 though 7:       V= s^3 - orginal equation     200 = 5.848036 ^ 3 - subutition     200 = 200 - multiplication     200 = 200 - it equal and it check       do rule   9 & 10     of course don't write the rules down but do write down what you did like the above example shows you     It's a lot of writting but your sure to catch your errors  with this method     I hope this helps

XD  The correct answer is A  The light reaction breaks down water molecules producing oxygen and hydrogen, the hydrogen go down an electron transport chain. This creates ATP in the process, this is part of Photosystem TWO (P680). Then the electrons move to Photosystem ONE (P700), to another electron chain, after being stimulated by light energy. This creates more ATP and finally the Hydrogen attaches to NADP+ To create NADPH.  This NADPH is then used in the carbon fixation to create what will later in a complicated process, creates Sugar~!  Calvin Cycle consists of these steps:  1) CO2 combines with 5 carbons to produce a 6 carbon molecule.  2) This 6 carbon molecule breaks down, to create 2 PGA molecules (3 carbons each).  3) The PGA along with ATP and an H+ from NADPH (of light reaction) forms PGAL  4) 2PGAL combine to form your sugar molecule.

I0XEVeUxaa	Chromatography is the science and/or practice of exploiting differences in both the CHEMICAL and PHYSICAL properties of component substances (chemicals/molecules) in a MIXTURE such that you achieve a separation of them between two PHASES.  The one phase is the MOBILE phase, which FLOWS past a STATIONARY phase.  The stationary phase must retains its physical and chemical characteristics within the mobile phase (that is, not be altered, such as by dissolution, in the mobile phase).  Within the MOBILE phase you MUST dissolve (solubilize) the mixture of components you wish to separate.  Suppose you have a two-component mixture:  C1 and C2.  Both are dissolved in the mobile phase.  You have a stationary phase in which C1 has a greater affinity or binding ability than C2.  As the mobile phase flows at a constant rate, C1 will bind or adhere to the stationary phase more than C2.  As such its movement in the mobile phase willl be retarded.  C2 will ELUTE first from the column or container which contains the stationary phase.   There are many variations of how this works.   In fact, C1 may bind without having its movement slowed at all.  In this case the mobile phase chemical composition must be changed or altered to ELUTE component C1.    In gas-liquid chromatography, the mobile phase is actually a gas and the stationary phase is a liquid (usually some chemical that is solid at room temperature but becomes a liquid or gel in a hot oven.  In HPLC, the mobile phase is a liquid (mixtures of aqueous and organic solvents) and the stationary phase a solid.  Paper chromatography is probably one of the oldest...here the stationary phase is (high quality filter) paper and it is spotted on one end with a mixture, then placed in a usually aqueous mobile phase (so as not to dip the spotted samples within it!) which ascends by capillary action up the paper within a developing tank (whose vapors are equilibrated for some time in the mobile phase) and which usually separates the components in the spotted sample based on their differences with the affinity of the paper.  Thin-layer chromatography (TLC) does the same setup but uses a different material, with very small particles.  Note that the smaller the particles of the stationary phase, the higher the resolution of the bands or spots (i.e. the better the quality of  the separation between components)    There are many types of chromatography:  some separate components on the basis of their affinity to water (hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity).  Others separate based on their status as ions or polarized molecules (ion-exchange).

a01a4c7fa42d359ddf53eaa686c7f84faa	Since there are 39.37 inches in one meter, and 12 inches per foot, then there are (39.37 in/m)/(12 in/ft)  [(39.37)/12][(in/m)/(in/ft)]  3.281 ft/m.  Don't let the units baffle you.  Units behave the same way as fractions when they are divided.  To find the number of cubic meters in one cubic foot, we take the reciprocal of the result above and cube it:    cubic meters per cubic foot  [1/(3.281 ft/m)]3  [1/(3.281)3] m3/ft3  0.0283 m3/ft3.    To find the number of cubic feet per cubic meter, we use the result 3.281 ft/m and cube it to get this:    (3.281 ft/m)3  35.320 ft3/m3    To convert the flow from cubic meters per second to cubic feet per second, since there are approximately 35.320 cubic feet per cubic meter, we just multiply that figure by 4.235 m3/s to get this:    35.314 ft3/m3 x 4.235 m3/s  (35.314 x 4.235)(ft3/m3 x m3/s)  149.555 ft3/s.|`|KY3o5T5Daa	Crap.|`|0LsRbK2iaa	wow this is math i hate math cause its soooo complicated

SvmZlLdaaa	No. In order for two different species to be able to interbreed, they must be closely related - usually within the same genus, and at least within the same family. This means that they shared an ancestor with each other more recently than with other animals, and thus share much of the same genetic material. Beyond family level, two species cease to share enough genetic material for the egg and sperm to 'recognise' each other, and chickens and cattle are not only different families but different orders and classes. A chicken's sperm would simply not be able to fertilise a cow's egg, or a bull's sperm fertilise a chicken egg.|`|TMB4d3FAaa	With gene splicing.  They have already spliced human genes into some tomatoes to increase the shelf life and hardiness.  A danger they down play is the pathogenic transfer possibilities.  Swine flu that killed millions of people world wide was one such transfer.  The pigs ate a sick bird.  The pig got sick and then transferred it to humans.  In Aids/HIV the monkey disease was somehow transmitted to humans.  Look at the problem its created. Look how panicky they are about the new bird flu strain.  Most diseases are host specific. However, by gene splicing we give them a bridge to another host.  "Mad Cow" is our newest plague.  Instead of disposing of the sick animals they ground them up and fed them into the food chain.  The offending prion can withstand temperatures of over 800F.  In the USA, we are getting Elk and deer who were fed to grow bigger trophy racks that are now sick with a form of "Mad Cow".

I0XEVeUxaa	Enzymes are polypeptide (protein) catalysts, which by defintion are not supposed to be changed at all by the products or reactants at the completion of the reaction.  During catalysis, they may assume an intermediate condition where they are chemically or physically altered, but again at the completion of the reaction, they must be unaltered if they remain active.    Not all enzymes survive their reactions however.   Mono-oxygenases typically form free radicals as part of the reaction, and these are unstable by nature.  Often the reactant or product within the active site of the enzyme becomes irreversibly coupled (covalently bonded) to the enzyme, rendering the enzyme inactive with loss of the formation of product too (although the loss of the enzyme is the more significant event).  Such enzymes may only go as few as 10 or 100 catalytic cycles.|`|p6tWjnZiaa	No a major point of enzymology is that they do not change.  They are the same as when they entered the reaction.|`|bqoEOO8Waa	No they dont change. the definition of enzymes: Enzymes are biological catalysts that alter the speed of a reaction and remains unchanged at the end of the reaction.

D0znfBeXaa	When a function depends on x and x -> a, then substitute x = a   calculating limit. In this case as f(x) = 3, g(x) = -1 we don't have x  in the expressions of functions and there is nowhere to put x = a.    Then calculation of the limit is trivial - just plug their values under   the limit and calculate it:    lim cubed root(g(x))[f(x)+3] = cubed root(-1) *[3 + 3] = -1 * 6 = -6  x-> a

Do you remember the universal translator?    There is no words, no physical sounds on the higher planes of existence (where ghosts... "stick around"), there is so called "non-verbal communication" (NVC) - feelings, emotions, images etc. Our mind is working as such universal translator, because as physical beings here on Earth we're using our vocal speech to communicate, we're not used to communicate with NVC, therefore our mind is translating NVC communication into the language we speak during most of the time.    That's why most people can't communicate with spirits, their minds are overloaded with physical reality, and that's why a lot of all these channellings or psychic communications are often mistaken, our universal translator isn't perfect :P.    Summarizing, if your native language is english, ghosts will "speak" in english, if your native language is german, ghosts will speak german - and vice versa.|`|UplpiqdCaa	nooooooo they don't  i was watching this one episode of GHI and Barry stated that not all ghosts knew english and that's why they started to "attempt" to speak in the language of that country and they have gotten some pretty cool results from speaking both English and the native language.|`|joe2auNVaa	Good Question!!|`|3c51ba3982b4a0fa984f838020963690aa	Yeah, I noticed that as well.

And when they're elsewhere, they always make attempts to speak the language. Even if they are speaking English and the spirits don't know the language, it doesn't mean they won't respond in their own native tongue saying something else. They've had spirits speaking in other languages on EVPs before.

So we have one side of the equation and all the tools necessary to find the other side. 4 o'clock is 9 less then twice the number. The punctuation of this is atrocious; it completely perverts the syntax. This is the most accurate reconstruction I can see: 4 o'clock is 9 less. Then double the number.    Step by step we have the following: 4 o'clock is 9 less. Substitute "9 less" in for "4 o'clock" in the earlier problem and you get "9 less the sum of a number and three." 9 less therefore is the sum of a number (which we know to be 1:00) and three." 9 less = 4. That means that the operator "less" must be equivalent to "minus 5."    The final question is simplicity itself: twice the number (which, remember, is still 1:00) is 2:00.                    4 (x + 3) = 2x - 9|`|9sf8mnP3aa	4(x + 3) = 2x - 9|`|IOKilPsFaa	4 ( x+3 ) = 2x - 9          i hope this is right....|`|shCn6F95aa	-10.5|`|YiDD3TOgaa	4(3+x)=2x-9  12+4x=2x-9  21=-2x  x=-10.5    By the way, it's spelled "than."

V4oqAHDqaa	Another perceptive question about fundamentals.    Every wave carries energy.  Energy has mass, as discussed earlier.  So any kind of wave must lose a certain fraction of its energy when moving upwards in a gravitational field.    For sound waves, this has no practical significance, because you run out of atmosphere, and sound can't travel in a vacuum.    For lightwaves, which (as you probably know) come in quanta of energy called photons,  the loss of energy shows itself as a decrease in frequency, since for any quantum    E = Planck's constant x frequency    (Of course, light can't lose energy by slowing down, since the speed of light is a constant of nature)    This effect is too small to see even around massive stars, because the shift is small compared with the width of the spectral lines that we can observe.  But it has actually been measured, using the extremely sharp gamma rays emitted by some nuclei in the process of decay (see Pound-Rebka Experiment in Wikipedia).    A sufficiently powerful gravitational field creates a black hole, from which light cannot escape.  Presumably the frequency would fall to zero.    I don't understand gravitational waves, or how they interact with a gravitational field.  I'm not sure anyone does.  The present form of the field description comes from relativity theory, while the wave description comes from quantum mechanics, and no one has yet come up with a decent way of joining the two kinds of theory together for gravity.    Hope this helps.|`|D5QgyGbXaa	Waves don't do any escaping, as there is nothing that is moving.  A wave is a change in intensity or phase or density.  For example, a sound wave is a pattern of alternating lower and higher density of air that moves.  The pattern moves at the speed of sound.  The air that carries the wave doesn't move, it stays in place.  The same holds true for light, radio, and gravity waves|`|YiDD3TOgaa	Every type does, as is evident with singularities. There is nothing (that we know of) that can escape a black hole, which indicates that everything needs an escape velocity to escape gravity.|`|ps0tupqAaa	The escape velocity depends on the mass that you are trying to escape from.  For Earth, this is about 11km/sec.  For the sun, the escape velocity is much higher since it is much bigger.  When we talk about waves, we are normally talking about electromagnetic waves.  They travel a a very stead 299,792,458 m/s.  This velocity is capable of escaping from all masses except a black hole.

There are two types of charge: positive and negative, quantized in units of elementary charge, e. Protons carry a charge of +1, electrons carry a charge of -1, and neutrons, which carry no electric charge, are said to have charge 0. Charged particles can interact with and generate electromagnetic fields. This interaction between charge and field gives rise to the electromagnetic force, one of the four fundamental forces and the force responsible for keeping electrons bound in orbital shells around the atomic nucleus|`|77cb033374598e8c10938763c9fe03f7aa	It contains charges but the result is neutral.|`|5al0K3N0aa	Sorry to be picky about the above, but charge is not quantized in units of e.

xXOnjDNOaa	Transcription always goes from the 3' end of the DNA to the 5' end. The enzymes only work one way (barring proofreading ability and such).    Edit:    Well strictly speaking, if you just saw a picture it would be difficult (if not impossible) to tell, since the 3' and 5' is a reference to where a bond on the sugar is located.  In this case the easiest way to tell would be to watch how the protein was being formed and know that it's going from 3' to 5'    Edit  2:     Your book is correct, the RNA runs anti-parallel to the DNA molecule, so when you go 3' to 5' on one you go 5' to 3' on the other.|`|bqoEOO8Waa	The new strand ( in this case the RNA ) can only be formed from the 5' to 3' end, so the enzymes must always move from the 3'end of the existing strand.
xXOnjDNOaa	Membranes are made up on interesting molecules called surfactants that have a hydrophobic end and a hydrophillic end.  The idea is that these molecules can make structures that are stable in water (the exposed hydrophillic ends) but do not completely degrade (the self-attraction of the hydrophobic ends holds the membrane structure).  It's an interesting compromise between having something that is totally dissolved (like salt) or not dissolved at all (like kerosene).  You may want to look up the topic of lipid bilayers, and perhaps micelles.  In fact, it's this duality that makes soap useful for what it does, it can surround oils that water normally can't dissolve, then allow them to be picked up by the water phase.

6IxKdGyyaa	X= 16.    The way you get there is first you add up everything on the left side.  -3 + 14 = 11.    Now you start to figure out the right side.    Since there's a -5 floating around there, you can just add 5 to both sides of the equation to take the -5 out of there.  So on the left side, if you add 5, you get 16.  11+5=16.  On the right side of the equation, the 5 cancels out because -5 + 5 = 0.    So now you have 16 on the left side, and 12x - 11x on the right side, or 16 = 12x - 11x.    So what's 12x-11x?  ...  It's 1X, or just 'X'.    So that's your answer... 16 = X  ... You just must figure out both sides of the equation to solve for X.    -----------    To write: 'The product of 7 and the sum of a number and -6' as a variable expression you must just translate the words into symbols.    The answer is 7(-6 + X).    You get to that by known that 'product' means multiplication is taking place.  So 7 is being multiplied by something.  And the 'something' that it's being multiplied by is 'the sum of a number and -6'.    'a number' in this situation means X.  Sum means addition.    So, X is being added to '-6' which can be written as '-6+X' or as 'X-6'.    Because of the order of operations... you must put -6+X in parenthesis so that it is being expressed that you are multiplying the entire sum (X-6) by 7.  Otherwise it would be written like 7X-6 which is incorrect.    After the parenthesis are added, the phrase is being correctly expressed.  7(-6+X)  or 7(X-6).

I had a pretend fire, that I started with two sticks and I roasted pretend marshmallows on it.  I was even once molested by a pretend scoutmaster.  (is anyone reading this?  no?  thought not). Boy scouts can tell what time it is by looking at the Sun, and at this skill I did not need to pretend... I was good at it, but in reality, the damn timezone wouldn't keep up with the Sun.

Well, its the rule of IUPAC nomenclature ...so..    According to the IUPAC, an ionic compound's common name is written using two words. The name of the cation comes first (when using the Stock system) with the oxidation number written in parenthesis, followed by the name of the anion. For example, Fe2(SO4)3 is named as iron(III) sulfate. If the Classical naming system is being used, some ionic compounds have special "old" names, such as ferric (iron(III)), ferrous (iron(II)), cupric (copper(II)), and cuprous (copper(I)).    Thanx..Good Luck !!
D0znfBeXaa	103.  Ok, the first thing we need to do is to get rid of the square roots in the numerator. So lets multiply numerator and denominator by conjugate expression.  (in limits everywhere x->0)    Numerator  ((1+tanx) - (1+sinx)) ((1+tanx) + (1+sinx))=    =[(1+tanx)]2 - [(1+sinx)]2 = 1+tanx  (1+sinx)    = 1+tanx  1  sinx = tanx  sinx = sinx/cosx  -    - sinx = (sinx  sinxcosx)/cosx    Denominator  [((1+tanx) + (1+sinx)]x3    Next    lim (sinx  sinxcosx)/[((1+tanx) + (1+sinx)]x3cosx    As the conjugate expression is nonzero when   x ->0 we can calculate its value:    (1+tan0) + (1+sin0) = 1 + 1 = 2 and   also cos0 = 1.    Then the limit becomes:    lim (sinx  sinxcosx)/(2*x3*1) =    = 0.5 lim sinx(1  cosx)/ x3 =     =0.5 lim [sinx/x]*[(1-cosx)/x2]    Applying known limit lim sinx/x = 1, as x->0 we obtain  0.5 lim [(1-cosx)/x2]    Now you can apply lHopitals rule or rearrange it once more   1-cosx = 2sin2(x/2) :    0.5 lim [2sin2(x/2)]/x2 = 0.5*2*lim [(sin0.5x)/x]2 =     = lim [(0.5*sin0.5x)/0.5x]2 = 0.52 = 0.25 = ?.

857dd340c6485b24b0e9307b6080c7eaaa	I'd say infinite.  We have 23 pairs of chromosomes.   When gametes (ovules, sperm) are produced, by a process called meiosis, this number is cut in half: each daughter cell receives one copy of each pair, in any combination possible (2^23); when fertilization occurs, this number doubles, as any ovule can combine with any sperm cell and each has been originated by meiosis.  Also, during meiosis, before the number of chromosomes is cut in half, the two chromosomes of each pair can exchange bits of DNA, more or less randomly, wich increases the variability to unimaginable numbers.    But if this is not enough, you still have mutations, that happen all the time for a million reasons, you have extra-nuclear DNA to consider (mitochondrial DNA, etc) and epigenetics - heritable conditions that are not defined by the DNA sequence.|`|43b3fc46f5e0746407f46b876475c618aa	The number of potential combinations of human genetics is staggeringly enormous.

6ju7JLb2aa	Find the discriminant my friend.  This holds the key to all your questions!!     Given a quadtatic ax^2 + bx + c, compute b^2-4ac (this is the discriminant).  So for the first problem, a = -2, b = 1, c = 3  So the discriminant is 1^2 - 4(-2)(3) = 1 - (-24) = 1 + 24 = 25    Then if the discriminant is:  ~positive, then you get 2 points in common with the x-axis  ~zero, then you get 1 point in common with the x-axis  ~negative, then you get no points in common with the x-axis    Then if you got one point in common (discr = 0), the vertex is on the axis.  Otherwise, it will be above or below.  You can determine which one by knowing whethere a parabola opens "up" or "down".  If the leading coefficient, which we already called "a", is positive, it opnes up, and if a is negative, it opens down.    For example since the first problem has a negative "a", it opens down, and since it touches the x-axis twice, it MUST have its vertex above the axis, otherwise it would never touch.

Since a is negative it will look like an upside down u. The vertex is at the point (1/4, 25/8) or above the x-axis, it will have 2 points on the x-axis. So the correct answer is C.    Question 2:The vertex is at (2, 0) so it is sitting on the x-axis. So it has only one point in common. So A is the correct answer.|`|m78Z4GEPaa	y = -2x^2 + x + 3    Since the co-efficient of the term in x^2 is negative, the curve is a maximum curve, that is, it makes a cap or dome shape.

Answer = C    y= 3x^2 -12x + 12    Since the co-efficient of the term in x^2 is positive, the curve is a minimun curve, that is, it makes a cup shape.  At x-axis, y = 0  3x^2 -12x + 12 = 0  Dividing by 3  x^2 - 4x + 4 = 0  (x-2)^2 = 0  Since the 2 factors(roots) are equal, the x-axis is tangential to the curve, hence touches the curve at only 1 point at its vertex.

oEor85Uqaa	Sub-atomic particles cannot be 'visualised' in any real sense! These particles have properties like charm and strangeness, colour and spin - but none of these aspects correspond to anything 'real' in the classical sense.    The objects themselves are both wave and particles! How difficult is that to visualise!    In fact, it would have been better if the quantum physicists who chose the word 'spin' to describe the property you are asking about, had instead chosen some other word like spin-ness.    The concept behind spin is purely one of quantised property. It is a property that happens to correspond roughly to angular momentum at classical level, but at quantum level it is just another quantised property of the system that can be predicted using the Schrodienger equation.    Best not to get sucked too far into the idea that spin means something one can relate to at the classical level.|`|43b3fc46f5e0746407f46b876475c618aa	Spin does not make any intuitive sense in a classical sense. You can imagine spin as an intrisic property of the particle (like spinning about its axis) but this is not exactly true. It does however relate to some other properties in the way a axial spin would, so it is decent visualization but is not accurate.  Spin makes a whole lot of no sense when you look at it classically and even if you are willing to do the mathermatics(very hard) its still hard to explain outside of this is what the equations predict.|`|uDRfzKDFaa	Follow the link|`|zKLKyQshaa	The only logical way of viewing that spin is that it needs to spin around twice to come back to its starting point.

My suggestion ... don't try to visualize the physical system, instead, try to visualize the math that describes the physical system, you'll find that better.    Remember what Richard Feynman said ...    "I think it is safe to say that no one understands quantum mechanics. ... Do not keep saying to yourself, if you can possibly avoid it, `But how can it be like that?', because you will get `down the drain' into a blind alley from which nobody has yet escaped.

The only thing you can do, is simplify this.    sqrt(x/5) * sqrt(-20/x)     The first thing you would do is multiply the radicands.    sqrt(20x/5x)    Now notice that the Xs cancel, so you are left with    sqrt(20/5) which is just sqrt(4)    And the square root of 4 is just 2, the answer to the problem is  2 or -2|`|4BdO0FNSaa	multiply the two radicals together and we find sqrt(20x/5x)    sqrt(-x/5) * sqrt(-20/x) = sqrt[(-x/5)*(-20/x)] = sqrt(20x/5x)    the x cancels out and we have sqrt(20/5) = sqrt(4) = 2|`|T4251abGaa	ok, all you need to do is to multiply the insides of the radicals together, then take teh square root of that product.  you'll get:    sqrt((-x/5)(-20/x)) :    =sqrt((-x)(-20)/(5x))    =sqrt(20x/5x) simplifying this, we can divide a 5 out of both top and bottom as well as an x.

31f743411a42c3a8de21b1c9c1b15871aa	Hi,    To divide a problem like this, divide or reduce the coefficients. then for each variable , subtract the top exponent minus the bottom exponent. All of these results are initially in the numerator. If there is a negative exponent, that variable moves to the bottom and the exponent switches to a positive exponent.    So 50/10 is 5.  On the variable "p", 9 - 1 = 8  On the variable "q", 5 - 2 = 3  So this simplifies to 5p^8q^3     I hope this helps!! :-)|`|aG3si631aa	47|`|ae2c4569c4799153d7f205b6a61c7436aa	5p^8q^3.

Q6cwP28oaa	"takes 7 minutes and 30 seconds to go between the two mile markers": so boat travels one mile or 5280 (feet in a mile), in a total of 450 seconds.    this is 5280ft/450sec=11.73ft/sec or 42,240ft per hour.  (11.73x60secs/min = 704ft/min  x 60min/hr = 42,240ft/hr)    So the speed of the boat is 42,240 feet traveled in one hour divided by the feet in a mile so: 42,240/5280 = 8 miles per hour.    "boat burns about five gallons per hour at cruising speed"    Needs to travel from mile 156.6 to mile 132.6 = 24miles = 3hr trip time    so it would take 5gals/hr times 3hrs = 15 gallons of gas but the boat holds 12 gallons apprx so you would not make it without stopping.    If he buys gas at the boat repair shop he will need to go  from mile 156.6 to 140.3 = 16.3miles/8mph =2.0375hrs (122.25mins) 2.0375hrs x 5gph  =10.1875gals used up to that point. BUT HE MUST ARRIVE BY 5PM.      He needs a total of 15gals so will need to go from mile 140.3 to 132.6 = 7.7miles/8mph will take .9625hr x 5gals/hr so he  needs 4.8125 gallons to make it home.  So if he buys at least 3 gallons he will have enough gas and he has money  $20-$6.30=$13.70-8.25=$5.45 left which would buy $5.45/1.109 =4.9 gallons.    So he needs to leave 2.0375hrs (122.25mins) or 2hrs 2minutes and 15 seconds before 5pm which is by 257pm and 45 seconds.    Since there is less than an hour to home from the repair shop he will easily make it before 752pm.

Currently we're spending less on SETI than it takes to run a single McDonald's franchise.  As i'd rather have a SETI program than yet another McDonald's, I'm done.    Most of SETI has been done without dedicated telescopes.  Most of it has been done with a piggy back instrument on an existing telescope, and the SETI program does not participate in where the scope points.  This is quite cost effective.  Some follow up is done with dedicated scope time, but in small amounts.  This is also cost effective.    The Allen array is being built.  But it is also expected to perform other astronomy work, not just SETI.  The only dedicated SETI program i'm aware of is optical SETI.  The 72" scope was purpose built, and because of the peculiar needs of SETI, it was much cheaper than a general purpose SETI instrument.

King without you saying anything about it.    "And so even though we face the difficulties of today and tomorrow, I still have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream.    I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal."    I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia, the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood.    I have a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi, a state sweltering with the heat of injustice, sweltering with the heat of oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice.    I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.    I have a dream today!"    - ML King, Jr, 28 August 1963    PS... nibiru is no more real than the tooth fairy.|`|LF2t9DPZaa	Neither of them actually exist.|`|3Yg4AFOTaa	All I know about this planet is it's size.

GtVrV9iyaa	Dipole-dipole forces are caused by the attraction of polar molecules to each other, and increase the strength of bonds in a substance. When a substance reaches boiling point, these bonds all must be broken in order for the substance to reach a gaseous state.    In short, dipole-dipole forces have the effect of increasing a substance's boiling point due to increasing the amount of energy required to break all its bonds.|`|sCehoTIsaa	Dipole-dipole intermolecular forces are stronger than typical van der waals. thus the bond is harder to break, thus a higher boiling point. Hydrogen bonding is even stronger than Dipole-dipole thus even higher boiling points e.g. water.|`|0K1znuHlaa	dipole forces are created when molecules have partial charges,like water for example has its hydrogen atoms partially positive and the oxygen partially negative. an H2O molecule will bond with other H2O molecules to cancel out the tiny partial charges. this weak bonds between the molecules will make it harder for the liquid to boil.    the weaker the the dipole forces, the lower the boiling point.  the stronger the dipole forces the higher the boiling point.    water for example has stronger dipole forces than alcohol, thus the alcohol will boil quicker than water.

In other words:  t1 = t - 1 (t1 is earlier 1 hours then t)  t2 = t + 1 (t2 is later 1 hours then t)  t = t2 -1 (substitue from t2 = t + 1)  t1 = t -1  t1 = t2 -1 -1  so t1 = t2 -2    S1 = S2  v1 * t1 = v2 * t2  15 * (t2-2) = 10 * t2  15* t2  - 30 = 10 * t2  5 * t2 = 30  t2 = 6  S2 = v2 * t2  S2 = 10 * 6  S2 = 60 miles  since S1 = S2 = S it means that Julio must travel for 60 miles (DISTANCE = 60 miles).  To get on time t must be t2 -1 = 6-1 = 5 hours  so the speed to arrive on time = 60/5 = 12 miles/hours|`|O6wwDtrmaa	10 miles per hour = 1 hour late  15 miles per hour = 1 hour early      10 + 15 = 25    25 / 2 = 12.5 mph    You take the average of both of the times to work out the time he will get there on time.|`|UyyJnrBLaa	actually it should hav been 12.5 mph bcoz the addition n subtraction of 2.5 miles(distance) results julio 2 go or b quick or late by 1 hour respectively
AA11824362	None. Mankind is not a carbon sink, much less one of the biggest carbon sinks. Even using your logic, "turning trees into paper or natural rubber into tires", mankind does nothing to reduce atmospheric carbon-based gases (methane, carbon dioxide, etc.). Plants are probably the biggest carbon sink; they use sunlight energy to convert carbon dioxide and water into plant tissues (hydrocarbons) and oxygen.
cHhEC9fpaa	You need to know both the atomic mass and the atomic number of the nuclei involved.     U238 has an atomic number of 92  Pb206 has an atomic number of 82    Now you can apply conservation of mass and charge.     In going from mass 238 to 206 the mass changes by 32. Each alpha particle (2n + 2p) has a mass of four (the mass of the betas can be ignored). So that means we must have 8 alphas.     The atomic number gives the nuclear charge which changed by 10. The charge on an alpha is +2 so the nucleus must emit (2x8 - 10) = 6 beta particles, which are negatively charged electrons.    You also asked about other questions. Generally if the atomic mass and number of the initial state is (A1, Z1) and the final state is (A2, Z2) and n(alpha) is the number of alphas, and n(beta)  is the number of betas solution is found by solving    Conservation of mass:   A1 = A2 + 4 n(alpha)  Conservation of charge: Z1 = Z2 + 2n(alpha) - n(beta).       Some decay chains involve the emission of a positron or electron capture from an inner shell electron. This simple rule breaks down in these cases.|`|t9iWZmmQaa	You need to find an illustration of the decay chain from U-238 to Pb-206. There is probably one in the text book you refer to. Its a long chain but you can count the number of particles emitted at each stage.

Hq6nSl1Qaa	If you don't need to recover the calcium carbonate, then add acid.  It will convert the CaCO3 to carbon dioxide, leaving calcium ions, salt, sand, and water.  The sand will settle out, leaving calcium ions, salt, and water.  Calcium can be precipitated out after removing the salt by adding high concentration sodium hydroxide, precipitating calcium hydroxide.  Then you have salt and water.  Evaporate the water to retreive the salt.|`|8R2aDPXOaa	filter calcium carbonate and sand then evaporate water to get salt.  pour hydrochloric acid on mixture of calcium carbonate and sand and filter sand. then ....|`|qzY2tRTeaa	Seperate Sand and Salt    Needed:      Salt   Sand   Water   A cooking vessel   A stove or hot plate   Experiment:  Measure equal amounts of salt and sand and then mix them thoroughly. Place the mixture in a pan and add water. Heat the water until all the salt dissolves. Allow the sand to settle to the bottom of the pan and then pour off the salty water. Remove the sand from the pan and put the salty water back in. Boil the water away, leaving only salt in the bottom of the pan.   Explanation:  The sand does not dissolve in the water as the salt does. The salt does not boil away as the water does. Will this work with a mixture of sugar and sand? What about sugar and salt?

K6QlFoo0aa	In mathematics, a metric space is a set where a notion of distance (called a metric) between elements of the set is defined.    For example, the real number line is a metric space.  The distance between any two points is what is called a metric.    The plane is also a metric space.  The metric is the distance between two points.    But those are extremely "nice" metric spaces.  You could define a metric space as a set with three elements, a,b, and c.  The metric could be:    measure from a to b is five  measure from b to c is six  measure from a to c is ten    That's a highly theoretical metric space and you would have to define open and closed subsets.  The open sets, not including the null space and the entire metric space, could be {a,b} and {b,c}.  Then {a}and {b} closed and {c} and {a,c} could be neither open nor closed.  I can't imagine any real use for this metric space, but it it a metric space. :)

oXPDFw4daa	There are many wide-band radios available.    The problem is one of signal propagation.  Basically, commercial radio tends to be a line-of-sight application - in order to receive the signal, it should be possible to draw a straight line between the transmitting antenna and the receiving antenna.  If that line intersects the earth, there are problems.      In some instances, depending on atmospheric conditions and the frequency of transmission, it is possible for signals to bounce off of layers in the atmosphere.  Amateur radio operators (hams) routinely use the atmospheric bounce phenomenon to communicate with their counterparts around the world.  However, the frequencies of their transmissions are higher and are more amenable to bouncing than are the lower frequencies used by commercial broadcasters.    Interestingly, there is a related problem associated with military communications with underwater submarines.  It turns out that lower frequency signals propagate better through water, so submarine communications employ frequencies that are below those of commercial broadcasters.|`|kOsJ63KFaa	I don't see how that could be done with the "line of sight" problem.

AA10927246	In mathematics the repeating decimal 0.999 denotes a real number equal to one. In other words: the notations 0.999 and 1 actually represent the same real number. This equality has long been accepted by professional mathematicians and taught in textbooks.    You've just provided a proof of that yourself (assuming you meant for those to be infinitely repeating decimals):  1/3 = 0.333333...  2/3 = 0.666666...  3/3 = 0.999999... = 1    You can also see it with this sequence of fractions:  1/9 = 0.111111...  2/9 = 0.222222...  3/9 = 0.333333... = 1/3  4/9 = 0.444444...  5/9 = 0.555555...  6/9 = 0.666666... = 2/3  7/9 = 0.777777...  8/9 = 0.888888...  9/9 = 0.999999... = 1    And here's another common proof:  x = 0.999999...  10x = 9.999999...    Subtracting the two:  9.999999...  0.999999...  ----------------  9    10x - x = 9  9x = 9  x = 9/9  x = 1    For anyone that is saying that 0.999999... is "close" to one, they are mistaken.  It is *exactly* 1.  There's no rounding or approximating involved.    That being said, there obviously is a tendency for students, even those well versed in math concepts to "feel" like there is a mistake in saying that 0.999999... is equal to 1.

MLN2tJuyaa	With every measure you do there is an associated error. Perhaps a pipette set at 1000l only takes 950l. However, if you do that eight times to measure out 8 ml the error is multiplied by 8 (in this case 8 X 50l). The question is what is the error associated with each piece of equipment? Does using the measuring cylinder have a lower error because you only measure the amount once (therefore only have one lot of measurement error).  I personally would assume that measuring the amount in one go has the lowest associated error and therefore I would use the measuring cylinder.|`|EO5cXgLFaa	Use the the 10 ML graduated cylinder. The pipettes are never quite that accurate. Also, as you are measuring out 8 times with a 1 ML pipette you will have less consistency and will be less accurate than you would be by measuring just once with the 10 ML graduated cylinder.
S8H5yYcoaa	The trick here is to pay attention to the forces on the object.  Discounting air resistance, which I imagine you're not required to deal with, there are no horizontal forces on the object: the y-velocity Vy will be constant.  In fact, the object after launch is in free fall: the only force at all on it is gravity, at 9.8m/s^2 downard.    So Vy(t) = Vy(0) for all t, and Vx(t) = Vx(0) - 9.8t  We integrate to find y(t) = y(0) + Vy(0)x and x(t) = x(0) + Vx(0)t - (9.8/2)t^2.    Assume y(0) = 0 = x(0), as you're looking at horizontal/vertical distance from when you started.  You can break down your initial speed into vertical and horizontal components by considering them to be sides of a right triangle, of which 50 is the hypoteneuse and the angle between that and Vx(0) is 36.9: then Vx(0) = 50cos(36.9) and Vy(0) = 50sin(36.9).    Speed is similarly found through treating horizontal and vertical velocities as sides of a right triangle, the absolutely value of the hypoteneuse being speed: |v(t)| = sqrt(Vx(t)^2 + Vy(t)^2).    Now will all these values calculated, we can plug in for actual times t to fill in your table:    x(t) = x(0) + Vx(0)t - (9.8/2)t^2 = 0 + 50cos(36.9)t - 4.9t^2  x(0) = 0; x(1) = 50cos(36.9)-4.9; x(2) = 2*50cos(36.9) - 4.9*4; x(3) = 3*50cos(36.9) - 4.9*9; x(4) = 4*50cos(36.9) - 4.9*16; x(5) = 5*50cos(36.9) - 4.9*25; x(6) = 6*50cos(36.9) - 4.9*36.  You can of course approximate these various values with a calculator.    As you're asking for help starting, and this is somewhat tedious to write out, I think I'll leave you with this for now.  But if you find you're still stuck on how to work through the rest of the table, feel free to update your question - I'll keep checking back.

D5ShDa5naa	The conservation law for momentum says that the total momentum of a closed system of objectsmeaning one that isn't acted upon by any outside forceis constant. In practice, this means that no matter what happens inside the system, its initial momentum will always equal its final momentum.    In your fighter plane example, you can say the closed system is the fighter and its bullets. When the bullets are still in the fighter's gun, the whole group is part of the same combined mass and all its parts have the same velocity and acceleration. When the plane fires, the bullet's speed increasesso if momentum is conserved, the plane must slow down.    The system's initial momentum is mass * velocity = (mass_plane + mass_bullet) * velocity, and its final speed is (mass_plane * velocity_plane) + (mass_bullet * velocity_bullet):    mass_plane+bullet * v_system = mass_plane * v_plane + mass_bullet * v_bullet    The law is useful because you'll often know that either the initial or final velocity of some component of the system is zero, which means the m_component * v_component term disappears and you can solve for one of the terms you're missing.

Because ice is 8/9 the density of water, only a small proportion of the ice is above the water, the vast majority is below. Similarly continental crust is largely composed of felsic rocks like granite (density 2.7) floating on mantle, composed of mafic rocks, with a specific gravity of 2.9 to 3.1.     Where there is greater volume and weight of crust as a result of mountains, there is greater crustal compensation at depth.

XPObDMnyaa	"There are a number of theories that can possibly explain this phenomenon, although it may be a combination of effects each playing a role.    Firstly, we have evaporation. Some of the hot water could be lost through evaporation meaning that there is less to freeze and it can therefore freeze faster than the cooler water.    Next we have the possibility that the heated water is somehow changed in its properties. Hot water can hold less dissolved gas than cold (think how much gas bubbles out of water just before it boils) and the presence of this gas could be lowering the effective freezing temperature of the cold water. Or the loss of the gas in the warmer water could allow convection currents to be set up more easily.    If the cooler water supercools while the warmer doesn't, it could take longer to become a solid explaining the Mpemba effect.    Despite several experiments showing the Mpemba effect does exist, it will only work under certain conditions. All my attempts so far have been unsuccessful but this doesn't mean the effect doesn't exist. Different temperatures, starting temperatures and volumes of water will make a difference to the experiment. Why not try it yourself?"|`|6cwUjRjjaa	I don't believe so. My reasoning: in order to freeze something, you must slow down the movement of molecules (the slower something is moving, the colder it is). Therefore the cold water, as it's molecules are already moving slower than hot water, should freeze faster. However, I don't truly know, this is simply my best guess.

YDgDdadHaa	No, they do not.    Chromosomes, by definition are tightly wound and scaffolded DNA with protein structures (think "spider webs").

YDgDdadHaa	Yes, they are.    Proteins are constantly being made and degraded by the cell, kind of like "low tides" and "high tides". Almost all genes are regulated, to control how fast (or slow) proteins can be made.    Essentially all proteins are made and destroyed this way. In fact, when this balance is out of control, then we run into natural diseases, like diabetes, alzheimers, and cancer. These kinds of diseases happen because we make too much or too little of certain proteins.|`|CYtMRC4eaa	It depends on what kind of cell it is, and what kind of protein/enzyme it is.

CYtMRC4eaa	1. Two amino acids are joined by a dehydration synthesis into a dipeptide by removing a molecule of water.  It's not easy to do without a drawing, but if the two amino acids are next to each other with the carboxyl end of one next to th amino end of the other, the -OH of the carboxyl group and the H- of the amino group are removed to form a water molecule.  This leaves the Carbon of the carboxyl and the Nitrogen of the amino with open bonds.  They join to form a peptide bond, C-N.    As for the  polypeptide, I believe the amino acids to be:  X-gly-met-cys-ser-cys-his-pro-arg-cys.  Unfortunately, this is a chain of 10, not 9 as stated in the problem, counting amino acid X.  I did it by observing the sequence of amino acids that overlap.|`|YDgDdadHaa	A.  H2NCHRCOOH (where R is the side group) is a general structure for an amino acid. When you add:    H2NCHRCOOH + H2NCHRCOOH, the hydrogen from the amine side of one amino acid and the oxygen and hydrogen from the carboxilic acid of the other amino acid condense to form an amide bond and releases water. You can show this with any amino acid pair. See the link for an example:    http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/co...    B.  This isn't really a biology question, it's more of a logic puzzle. Since you (should) know that peptides form linear molecules, it's just a matter of looking at what fragments are necessary and which fragments are redundant. Fragmentation doesn't occur at the same place all the time. For example:    pro - arg - cys      is redundant, because it's just the last part of  ser - cys - his - *pro - arg - cys*      got it?    X - gly - met - cys      is redundant, because it's just the first part of  *X - gly - met - cys* - ser - cys          got it?    his - pro - arg - cys     is redundant, because again, it's just the last part of     ser - cys - *his - pro - arg - cys*        got it?    If X is the first amino acid, then the linear chain must start with X"    X - gly - met - cys - *ser - cys* + *ser - cys* - his - pro - arg - cys  (but the "ser - sys" part is redundant!)    The final oligopeptide is:   X - gly - met - cys - ser - cys - his - pro - arg - cys

In order of priority, you'd have to create oxygen first--followed by CO2, followed by nitrogen, water vapor and other trace gases. Nitrogen is the LAST element to surround yourself with because it snuffs out oxygen.    Craters are incredibly useful since you can fill them up with water, phytoplankton and iron sulfate to make OXYGEN and CCNs (cloud condensation nuclei). Through photosynthesis, phytoplankton release DMS, dimethyl sulfide, that's converted to sulfate aerosols in the atmosphere. Water vapor clings to CCN's and dust to form CLOUDS.  Ashes from burnt newspapers or coal ashes can serve as dust.    To protect your atmosphere from dissipating into space, a "global" magnetic field has to be in place. A MAGNETIC FIELD will block out cosmic rays and also protect any water from being photo-dissociated by solar uv, a process which strips hydrogen from water molecules while the solar wind blows it off into space. An ATMOSPHERE on the other hand, will block out gamma, uv and x-rays. Superconducting Rings and dynamos create magnetic fields. Geodynamos are built on planets which spin on their axis to take advantage of the rotational effect (Coriolis effect), while Superconducting Rings are built on moons which are tidally locked (do not spin but merely revolve about the parent planet). Excavation using Super Pulsed Fiber Lasers makes it incredibly more efficient than conventional drilling.      You'll need a Superconducting Magnet that meets these specifications: variable ramping up from 2 to 14 Tesla; quench recovery; ability to sustain a "persistent current" indefinitely; backup and failure protection; 24/7 monitoring system. On Earth, the magnetic field on the SURFACE is only 0.5 gauss, while near the core, it's approximately 100,000 gauss, or 10 Tesla. That's because magnetic flux varies as the Inverse CUBE of the distance, R. Use a magnetometer to measure the magnetic field.    A Samarium Cobalt magnet of 1 to 2 Tesla, imbedded 5' under a compressed dome (like a tennis dome) will protect about 50 inhabitants from cosmic rays (local magnetic fields).   Elongated bar magnets strapped onto spacesuits will create a cosmic "umbrella", deflecting cosmic rays while you walk and work (mobile magnetic fields).    CO2 can be introduced in various ways. It can be chemically released by aiming a laser at some of the dry ice caps on the moon. It can be outgassed by drilling holes into the ground and adding some sodium (Na) and water to create natural hot springs/geysers.    Then it's just a matter of planting grass and tress and bringing up a bunch of furry creatures (squirrels, hamsters, lorises, lemurs, weasels, etc.) to "bioform" the planet since all creatures which respire aerobically, give off WATER VAPOR, METHANE and CO2. All 3 are potent greenhouse gases which can build a rich and thick atmosphere over time, it'll also even out the temperature extremes. Just make sure you have a silo filled with a well formulated pet food which dispenses the pellets when they push a lever. You'll also need to install a water dispenser and salt licks. (Do not bring up mice for obvious reasons). Eventually farm animals, pets and more humans can be brought up, leading to an explosive growth of the atmosphere.    Perch a Tesla coil atop a mountain or build a Tesla coil tower to attract LIGHTNING.    NITROGEN: Animal droppings will enrich the topsoil and the urine will decompose into nitrogenous products like ammonia. Watering the ground and letting natural weathering processes such as heating and cooling of rocks will cause rocks to expand and contract, creating a sediment/topsoil. Compost piles from veggie scraps and animal droppings will generate tons of Methane gas which will warm up the atmosphere. Planting beans--and there are hundreds of varieties of them--will fix nitrogen.    WATER VAPOR and CO2: All COMBUSTION processes will yield water vapor and CO2, such as burning wood, methane, hay, propane, butane, etc. Campfires, cooking, baking and simmering soup are all combustion processes. Any activity such as working, running, dancing, sports, etc. will also generate water vapor and CO2 since these are the 2 primary byproducts of AEROBIC RESPIRATION. Water is a supreme temperature regulator due to its heat transfer capabilities.  Build a FISCHER TROPSCH reactor to make propane.    To sum it up, the more you COOK, EAT, and the more ACTIVE you are, the richer and thicker the atmosphere will be, so it's a beautiful thing.

9ECwMzZXaa	An electrical transformer is something that converts an electric current from one voltage to another.    The transformer is based on two principles: firstly, that an electric current can produce a magnetic field (electromagnetism) and secondly that a changing magnetic field within a coil of wire induces a voltage across the ends of the coil (electromagnetic induction). Changing the current in the primary coil changes the magnitude of the applied magnetic field. The changing magnetic flux extends to the secondary coil where a voltage is induced across its ends.    A simplified transformer design is shown HERE: http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/co... . A current passing through the primary coil creates a magnetic field. The primary and secondary coils are wrapped around a core of very high magnetic permeability, such as iron; this ensures that most of the magnetic field lines produced by the primary current are within the iron and pass through the secondary coil as well as the primary coil.|`|kOsJ63KFaa	To change from one voltage to another. Either step up or down. Only works for Alternating Current. The voltage change is done by induced current windings.

r2j5kf9Eaa	I never heard of ginkgo trees changing gender.  I'm no expert, by any means, but I know a little about those foul trees.  From what I understand they are bizarre little dudes.  I heard they have sex like humans, i.e., with motile sperm!?!  (Well, not *exactly* like humans, ya' know.)  Anyway, for the sake of argument let's assume that these trees cannot change gender.  If that's the case, I would guess that the trees planted in your neighborhood were immature.  I heard that they can take many years before they start to produce sperm.  If the males in the area were not producing sperm, then the female ovules wouldn't get fertilized.  Or maybe the female trees were not mature enough themselves to produce babies?  I'm not sure,  but I do know that young trees don't produce fruit, that it's common for them to go many years before they start producing fruit, and that it's nearly impossible to discriminate male from female trees on casual observation.  Or, maybe they mutated....
ossCVxPqaa	There are some strange problems with the wording of this problem: Are you actualy saying that Phenolphthalein turns pink in solutions which contain 1*10^*5 M OH- ? You actually say phenol, which is C6H5OH and which has a slightly acidic nature. I will assume that you mean phenolphthalein.    You find that 0.15ml of Ca(OH)2 solution are sufficient to provide this concentration of OH- ions and complete the colour change.  Question: How many moles of Ca(OH)2 are in the 3 drops?   Dissociation of Ca(OH)2    Ca(OH)2 ? Ca 2+  +  2OH-  2mol of OH- come from 1 mol Ca(OH)2   Therefore 1.0*10^-5 moles OH- must come from:   1.0*10^-5/2 = 5.0*10^-6moles of Ca(OH)2 present in the 3 drops    Molar mass Ca(OH)2 = 74.09 g/mol  You want: 5.0*10^-6moles of Ca(OH)2 = 74.09*5.0*10^-6   = 3.704*10^-4 grams Ca(OH)2 in the 3 drops.    I hope that I have read and interpreted your question correctly. I am still not surebut I trust that I am.   I ask you to consider that you are adding 3 drops or 0.15ml of solution. Do you really believe that it is possible for this minimal volume of solution to contain 8.4391 grams of Ca(OH)2? as you have calculated. Obviously not. So you must conclude that you are working incorrectly.

If you have two stations, I think you could figure out two spots of where the earthquake might be, but not be sure unless you had confirmation. However, with three stations, you can triangulate, and figure out exactly where the center of the earthquake was.|`|TL1Jkqunaa	Yes.  The third point of the triangulation is the epicenter.  It will not be Asa'sccurate as 3 or more stations but it can be pretty accurate.    Both stations draw rings based on the time of the wave arrival.   The rings will intersect twice.  One intersection will be obviously wrong, the other right.  A third station makes it unnecessary to use judgment, a policy always to be avoided, I guess.

pvtq3kjLaa	Q 1                        ~ SEXUAL VS. ASEXUAL ~       Why are most organisms sexual? The question of why most species reproduce sexually and others reproduce asexually has stymied biologists for years (particularly since asexual reproduction has many advantages including producing more offspring.) The question is answered in part in this weeks Science Magazine, published on Friday, October 19.  Studies by scientists at the University of California, Santa Barbara show that sexual reproduction wins out, in an evolutionary sense, over asexual reproduction in a major study that included 34 experiments with the common fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster.     Specifically, they discovered that the rate of progressive evolution (the accumulation of beneficial mutations) is faster in populations that reproduce sexually.    "However, there is a high cost associated with producing males," said William R. Rice, first author and professor of biology at the UC, Santa Barbara. "Just do the math and you will see. And yet, look out the window and almost every organism you see reproduces sexually."    The math is simple: with four asexual adults (females) you get eight offspring, but with two males and two females you get only four offspring. In other words, the asexual population grows twice as fast as the sexually reproducing one.     The second part of the mathematical advantage is that the asexual adult female is able to put all of her genes into the next generation, whereas with sexual reproduction, each individual is responsible for only half of the genetic information in the offspring.     "Its a dosage cost," said Rice. "My son only has half of my genes; the other half are from his mother. Only half of my genome is getting into the population. However, if I were an asexual female, my offspring would carry all of my genome. I would put twice as many genes into the next generation. With asexual reproduction you get two times as many offspring and two times as many genes into the population."    There is a broad assumption in this scenario that males do not help with the care and feeding of offspring, although in a small proportion of species they do help: people, wolves, foxes and most songbirds. In these species it is possible to produce more offspring because of the help of the male.    One hypothesis has been that the process of natural selection is more powerful when you mix genes in each generation. The UCSB scientists created populations that mixed genes and populations that didnt.    For the fruit fly experiments, Rice and Adam K. Chippindale (a post-doctoral fellow soon to be on the faculty at Queens University in Canada), used genetic tools to manipulate the fruit fly so that half were normal flies and half were asexual, and reproduced asexually (a situation that occurs in nature in several species, such as certain lizards and insects). "We created 17 populations that mixed genes and 17 that didnt," said Rice. "In other words, we had populations that were sexual and populations that were asexual."    They followed a mutation at a gene that coded for eye color, specifically for red eyes versus white. They found that this beneficial red eye mutation began to accumulate in both the sexual and asexual populations, but not as much or as fast in the asexual populations.    The researchers found that the efficiency of natural selection is higher because the "signal to background noise ratio of natural selection is higher in the sexual populations." This means that in evolutionary terms the sexually reproducing populations are the winners on average.    "Almost every life form is sexual, but according to theory asexual populations should win out," explained Rice. "We knew there must be a big countervailing reason that asexual reproduction loses out to sexual reproduction."    Rice and Chippindale knew that they needed a significant number of experiments in order to discover the average tendency. "Otherwise, it is like looking at whether or not wearing seat belts helps," said Rice. "You cant look at only one accident from which to draw conclusions, you need large numbers to show the average."    In the experiments, conducted over a year and a half, the researchers were able to track individual mutations over time. They found that with sexual reproduction, the gene for red eye color rose rapidly toward "fixation" or establishment in the population. The proportion of the red eye color gets higher and higher over time until it is fixed at 100 percent. With the asexual populations the mutation began to accumulate, but eventually stopped in most cases.    "We knew that there were advantages to sexual diversity, but it was not clear why," said Rice. "Now we have evidence that the rate of progressive evolution (the accumulation of beneficial mutations) is faster in sexual populations. We simulated that and saw that the sexual population gets the good gene faster. This is the first time that this has been consistent|`|CYtMRC4eaa	An advantage of sexual reproduction is the resulting genetic recombination to give variation in the offspring.  A disadvantage is that you have to find a mate.  In asexual reproduction, it's the opposite.    Advantages of internal fertilization: the fetus is protected and receives  nutrition from the mother as it develops.    A gamete is a sex cell (spore, sperm, egg, pollen) and is haploid;  a zygote is a diploid cell formed by the fusion of 2 sex cells.

Power is generated from a power plant in turbines  2. Power is sent to a transmission substation  3. Power is sent through high voltage wires to a power substation  4. Power is sent from a power substation through power lines connected by power poles to a transformer drum out the front of your house. There should usually be a wire connecting the power pole to the front of your house.

Conservation of mass  2. Conservation of charge    These are universal.    The general procedure is     1. write out CORRECTLY all the molecules on both sides without worrying about coefficients.  The molecule must exist chemically.  If the molecule/atom is an ion, write its correct charge.  The ion or molecule MUST exist in nature.    2. Suppose you have atom X in molecule XY on one side of the equation, and on the other side it is X2Z, that is 2 atoms of X complexed with atom Z.  Automatically you must write 2 XY on the other side of the equation, because mass must be conserved, and X2Z is the only way that this can exist.    3. By writing 2 XY, you know check the other side of the equation for Y, and you must write at least 2 Y either as part of a complex (like 2 WY) or just as Y itself.  Sometimes you get into tricky situations:  for example on one side you have X2Z and the other side you have X3Y.  So you need to find the least common mulitiple, which is 6.  Thus  you would write 3 X2Z + ....   2 X3Y + .... as coefficients, because you have 6 atoms of X on both sides now    4. When balancing charge, make sure you have the correct charge form!!!  This creates problems.  For example, X2Z[2-] means X2Z exists as a -2 ion.  X3Y[1-] is my notation that X3Y is a -1 ion (normally these are superscripts).  Take oxidation of silver by potassium ferricyanide:    Ag (s) + K3Fe(CN)6 ==>  Ag[1+] + 3 K[1+] + Fe[2+] + 6 CN[1-]    On the reactants side, I have all molecules showing no (zero) charge.  The potassium ferricyanide (which has an Fe atom with a 3+ charge) is a salt which will dissolve in solution.  The reaction will essentially be an oxidation of silver (from Ag[0] to Ag[1+]) and the dissolution of ferricyanide salt.  Now if the reactants have zero charge, then the products side must have zero charge:  there are three K[1+] ions, so charge = 3*(+1), one Ag +1 ion, so charge = 3*(+1) +1*(+1) = +4, one Fe[2+] ion, so charge = 3*(+1) +1*(+1) +1*(+2) = +6 and six cyanide ions all -1 charge, so charge = 3*(+1) + 1*(+1) + 1*(+2) - 6*(-1) = 0.  And the mass balances too.

AA11513203	No.      This is one of the most persistent of LIES spread by Creationists.   They will repeat this like a mantra but they will never be able to point to *anything* Darwin wrote that backs up this claim.    The LIE is based on two things:    1. Deliberately *misquoted* passages from Darwin's works.  The most common tactic you will find in *MANY* Creationist sources is to quote from Chapter 6, where Darwin anticipates objections or "difficulties" of the theory,   Darwin's method is to (A) describe the "difficulty", and then immediately (B) provide a response to it.   But the Creationist quotes will give (A) but leave out (B), making it sound like Darwin was "admitting doubts" about his own theory.   This is incredibly dishonest, and quite easy to expose (just by checking the original text, since Darwin's works are all searchable online) ... which makes this tactic especially baffling as it does nothing but make the Creationists look like dishonest liars.    This tactic of carefully finding selective partial quotes, and just providing enough to make it sound like the author was saying the *opposite* of what he actually said, is so common among Creationists that the tactic has been given a name ... "quote mining."  (Google it for lots of examples.)    Here is an article I wrote in my Yahoo blog:  "The dishonesty of quote mining ... did Darwin have doubts?"  http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-5zRy63c3e...    2. The infamous "Lady Hope" story.   Lady Hope was an evangelist who claims to have visited Darwin on his deathbed and "converted" him.   Not one other person (including Darwin's very religious wife, no a single person from Darwin's family) confirms that Lady Hope was anywhere *near* Darwin on his deathbed, much less her story about this deathbed conversion.   But the story is inflated by Creationists even beyond what Lady Hope described ... and is now described as Darwin "recanting" his scientific theory on his deathbed.   The Creationists will announce this with great authority despite *ZERO* evidence, and despite the fact that it contradicts everything Darwin ever wrote, said, jotted in a letter to closest friends, family, or colleagues, or scribbled on a napkin.   All of Darwin's life work means nothing to them compared to a complete exaggeration of an uncorroborated story that is most likely false.    http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/hope.htm...

AA11015110	May 29, 2000 -- Unfortunately, there's not much you can do to prevent this problem -- though there are ways you can ease its effects. It's a fact: Being at a high elevation is stressful to your body. The concentration of oxygen is 21% at both sea level and at higher altitudes, but the decreasing air pressure at higher elevations means you get significantly fewer oxygen molecules per breath once you go over about 8,000 feet.     Before your trip, make an effort to hit the gym more often, or do a few extra laps at the track. This can minimize the dizziness, fatigue, shortness of breath, nausea, and headaches that signal altitude sickness. Fitness at sea level doesn't guarantee an easier time when you're 2 miles high. But being in good shape makes it more likely that your lungs will be able to cope with the challenges of the high life.     There are also ways to ease the body's transition to higher altitudes once your trip begins. If you're going higher than 8,000 feet, take it slow. When you arrive, try to let your body acclimate for a day or two. When hiking up to 15,000 feet or more, spread out your ascent over a period of two or three days to give your body more time to adapt. And once on your trip, watch what you eat and drink. You'll want your respiratory system operating at full capacity, so avoid alcohol and any drugs that might interfere with your breathing, such as sleeping medications.     If your symptoms are severe, a prescription drug called Diamox may help. It works by stimulating your breathing, so that you take faster and deeper breaths.

8664edffff2916ab7ff25535b8629d09aa	The biggest difference is thier biochemical pathway for carbon fixation in the Calvin cycle. Many tropical plants are known as C4 plants. Most other plants are C3.    In C4 carbon fixation is one of three methods, along with C3 and CAM photosynthesis, used by land plants to "fix" carbon dioxide (binding the gaseous molecules to dissolved compounds inside the plant) for sugar production through photosynthesis. C4 fixation is an improvement over the simpler and more ancient C3 carbon fixation strategy used by most plants. Both methods overcome the tendency of rubisco (the first enzyme in the Calvin cycle) to photorespire, or waste energy by using oxygen to break down carbon compounds to CO2. This is important because at higher temperatures the reaction is more efficent. There is greater water use efficiency, less sensitivity to higher temperatures,better high temperature yields etc. These advantages are all related to the        properties of the enzyme ribisco, and gas diffusion of O2 at high temps.|`|2a1b0ac5de5df696d448f866e1e107baaa	First they are completley different plants, even if some look similar.

AA12195034	Grey hair is caused by death of the melanin (color)-producing cells in the hair follicle. It is more noticeable in dark hair than light. Since most Indian people are dark haired, it can be seen in children, whereas in a largely light-haired population, it would not be seen. Greying can happen at any age, though it is more likely as one ages.(1)    All people do not have poor eyesight (or it wouldn't be considered poor, it would be considered normal), though there are genetic, environmental and nutritional factors that can make the numbers greater in one area than another. Many of those who do have poor eyesight, have had it since birth.     It is unlikely to be noticed in a young child who is otherwise healthy, as they can't tell you what they can or cannot see. As they learn to talk, they don't mention any problem, because they don't know that everybody's eyesight isn't like theirs.     If you are seeing an increased incidence of poor eyesight, perhaps it is due to better medical care and eyesight screening. Certainly it could be something that is causing children to have poor eyesight more often than in the past, but it's more likely that it's just being picked up earlier.    I think that if you were able to find the information from an unbiased source, you'd learn that these two things have always happened in young children, and aren't just starting to happen now.

Look around you and you will see that everyone has their own job. Cells are the same. They all have their own job, and are therefore specialised.  In the human body there is not one cell , but many different types of cells . Cells are specialised (differentiated) and arranged to work together to make a fully-functioning human, for example: nerve cell, white blood and red blood cells, liver cells, the cones and rods in retinal cells, etc. The problem with specialised (differentiated) cells is that they have only limited potential to divide and replace themselves.    This is where the amazing work on stem cells comes into the picture.  Stem cells are unspecialised dividing cells. They divide to give further stem cells (self renew) but they can also mature into more specialised cells such as muscle, cartilage, pancreas, nerves or blood. Stem cells give rise to all the tissues of the body during development and allow for growth and repair in the adult organism. Within a tissue, they divide to replace damaged cells and provide new cells for growth of the tissue.|`|1a3721094b04a8dd2df26754deb88ae2aa	In biology it is a cell in the body, plant or animal that has a specific job to do.

However, as cloning research and methods improve, concerns of safety and reliability will no longer be an issue. Other arguments against cloning come from various religious orders (believing cloning violate's God's will or the natural order of life), and a general discomfort some have with the idea of "meddling" with the creation and basic function of life. This unease often manifests itself in contemporary novels, movies, and popular culture, much like numerous other scientific discoveries and inventions before. Various fictional scenarios portray clones being unhappy, soulless, or unable to integrate into society. Furthermore, clones are often depicted not as unique individuals but as "spare parts," providing organs for the clone's original (or any non-clone that requires replacement organs). Needless to say, cloning is a poignant and important topic, reflected by its frequent discussion and debate among politicians, scientists, the media, religions, and the general public.    One of the continuing obstacles in the attempt to clone extinct species is the need for nearly perfect DNA. Cloning from a single specimen could not create a viable breeding population in sexually reproducing animals. Furthermore, even if males and females were cloned, the question would remain open if they would be viable at all in the absence of parents that could teach or show them natural behavior. Essentially, if cloning an extinct species succeeded  it must be considered that cloning still is an experimental technology that succeeds only by chance  it is far more likely than not that any resulting animals, even if they were healthy, would be little more than curios or museum pieces.    Cloning endangered species is a highly ideological issue. Many conservation biologists and environmentalists vehemently oppose cloning endagnered species  not because they think it won't work but because they think it may deter donations to help preserve natural habitat and wild animal populations. The "rule-of-thumb" in animal conservation is that, if it is still feasible to conserve habitat and viable wild populations, breeding in captivity should not be undertaken in isolation.

Gravitation is one of the four fundamental interactions in nature, the other three being the electromagnetic force, the weak nuclear force, and the strong nuclear force. Gravitation is the weakest of these interactions, but acts over great distances and is always attractive. In classical mechanics, gravitation arises out of the force of gravity (which is often used as a synonym for gravitation). In general relativity, gravitation arises out of spacetime being curved by the presence of mass, and is not a force. In quantum gravity theories, either the graviton is the postulated carrier of the gravitational force[1], or time-space itself is envisioned as discrete in nature, or both.    The gravitational attraction of the earth endows objects with weight and causes them to fall to the ground when dropped (the earth also moves toward the object, but only by an infinitesimal amount). Moreover, gravitation is the reason for the very existence of the earth, the sun, and other celestial bodies; without it matter would not have coalesced into these bodies and life as we know it would not exist. Gravitation is also responsible for keeping the earth and the other planets in their orbits around the sun, the moon in its orbit around the earth, for the formation of tides, and for various other natural phenomena that we observe.    CONSERVATION OF MOMENTUM:--    In classical mechanics, momentum (pl. momenta; SI unit kg m/s) is the product of the mass and velocity of an object.In general the momentum of an object can be conceptually thought of as the tendency for an object to continue to move in its direction of travel. As such, it is a natural consequence of Newton's first law.    Momentum is a conserved quantity, meaning that the total momentum of any closed system cannot be changed.    The principle of conservation of momentum states that the total amount of momentum of all the things in the universe will never change. One of the consequences of this is that the center of mass of any system of objects will always continue with the same velocity unless acted on by a force outside the system.    Conservation of momentum is a consequence of the homogeneity of space.    In an isolated system (one where external forces are absent) the total momentum will be constant: this is implied by Newton's first law of motion. Newton's third law of motion, the law of reciprocal actions, which dictates that the forces acting between systems are equal in magnitude, but opposite in sign, is due to the conservation of momentum.    Since momentum is a vector quantity it has direction. Thus, when a gun is fired, although overall movement has increased compared to before the shot was fired, the momentum of the bullet in one direction is equal in magnitude, but opposite in sign, to the momentum of the gun in the other direction. These then sum to zero which is equal to the zero momentum that was present before either the gun or the bullet was moving.

AA11397626	First of all, what country are you coming from?  The chances of getting a scholarship depend on the country a lot.  What country do you plan to study in?    Find the Embassy for the country you want to study for, in your own country.  If you visit there, they will be able to give you information concerning scholarships.  You are in luck in that scholarships are much easier when you are going to graduate school -- and you already have your first degree so you will be a graduate student.  Plus, you are studying chemistry and that has good chances.      To study in an English-speaking country, you will need to take the TOEFL exam.  Before you take any of the academic (more expensive) exams, you should get the score testing your English.  Your grammar has to be very good to gain a score high enough for the university graduate schools!      The Embassies will have scholarships (maybe) for graduate students based on your performance as an undergraduate, but you also will need to take the SAT.  This exam will help universities to evaluate your knowledge (before matriculation) and it will help you very much in earning possible scholarships.      To know about which scholarships are possible, you will need to contact the individual universities.

It is highly pressurized so therefore the arteries walls need to be able to be constructed in a fashion where it supports the pressure.|`|222f05fa8d8e2bcc9ab57957286cb5f7aa	Arteries receive blood directly from the heart.

This is a good overview of the concept of blood pressure.    Pressure is defined as force per unit area and is measured in pascals [Pa = N/m2]. The term pressure is used when describing fluids (gases or liquids). If a fluid is at rest, pressure is transmitted equally to all its parts and, at any one point, is the same in all directions. This fact was discovered by the French scientist Blaise Pascal. Pressure plays an important role in our health, as for example blood pressure in the human circulatory system. Blood pressure is the pressure that is exerted by blood against the walls of the arteries as it travels through the body. When the volume of blood pumped through the arteries or the pressure that the blood puts against the walls of the arteries increases, the delicate tissues in the artery walls wear thin and may tear. Fat and cholestrol deposits further obstruct blood flow, narrowing the arteries, and thereby accelerating damage by raising blood pressure even more. Elevated blood pressure speeds up the progress of atherosclerosis, and wears out the coronary arteries faster than normal. High blood pressure may cause heart failure, kidney failure, and strokes.    As blood travels through the arterial system, the heart contracts and relaxes. When blood pressure is measured, two values are given. The first, called the systolic pressure, refers to the pressure on the arterial walls when the heart contracts and the second, called the diastolic pressure, is the measure of the pressure when the heart relaxes. For adults normal blood pressure is less than 19 kPa systolic, and 12 kPa diastolic. Blood pressure above this value is considered unhealthy and should be treated.|`|ba8352c09966de1df5646d3d21ffc09baa	mainly because they have high blood pressure- pulsate- difficult to be healed.....

This irritates nerves in the region (sphenopalatine ganglia), causing them to spasm. These nerves cause the blood vessels in the brain to dilate. When vessels in the brain dilate, a common effect is an acute headache. It is a stabbing or aching type of pain that usually recedes after 10-20 seconds after its onset, but sometimes 30-60 seconds, and can persist for up to 5 minutes in rare cases. The pain is usually located in the midfrontal area, but can be unilateral in the temporal, frontal, or retro-orbital region.|`|712864b2faa58f6306942814d16bd2dfaa	To make it go away quickly, turn your tongue upside down and press against the roof of your mouth.|`|AA11709942	Simply put, Brainfreeze occurs when the Slurpee (or anything cold) touches the roof of your mouth, the collection of nerves in the roof of your mouth (called the spheno-palantine ganglion) go into a spasm (a spasm is like a cramp).

AA10859748	It has to do with reaction rates. Bromide is strange in many ways.   Chlorine free radical addition is endothermic and the Chloride hydrogen bond is strong. Iodine free radical addition is also exothermic because the iodine carbon bond is very weak. Bromide hydrogen and bromide carbone bonds are jus the right values to be exothermic and so add a different way.|`|fa43b422d059c903be0677e89ce35d35aa	The reason that hydrogen bromide adds in an anti-Markovnikov fashion in the presence of organic peroxides is simply a question of reaction rates. The free radical mechanism is much faster than the alternative electrophilic addition mechanism.    Both mechanisms happen, but most of the product is the one from the free radical mechanism because that is working faster.    With the other hydrogen halides, the opposite is true.    Hydrogen fluoride    The hydrogen-fluorine bond is so strong that fluorine radicals aren't formed in the initiation step.    Hydrogen chloride    With hydrogen chloride, the second half of the propagation stage is very slow. If you do a bond enthalpy sum, you will find that the following reaction is endothermic.  This is due to the relatively high hydrogen-chlorine bond strength    Hydrogen iodide    In this case, the first step of the propagation stage turns out to be endothermic and this slows the reaction down. Not enough energy is released when the weak carbon-iodine bond is formed.    In the case of hydrogen bromide, both steps of the propagation stage are exothermic.

How about something straightforward the like the optimal temperature for yeast growth? You'd have a series of temperatures (say 5, 20, 35, 50, 65, 80 degrees centigrade) and in each temperature, take a given amount of yeast (maybe 10 grams dry weight from a packet for making bread?) and put it in a given volume of nutritive medium (maybe into 5 ml of sugar water). The tough part on that would be measuring growth... I'd be inclined to try to measure carbon dioxide production, but I'm not sure how you want to do that. You could do it by looking at the change in gas volume in your sealed containers, but you'll need to talk to your teacher about that because I don't know what equipment you have available. Or, you could measure the change in turbidity of the nutritive medium by using a spectrophotometer, if you have one of those. Anyway, once you find a proxy for growth of yeast, you then would compare the growths across the temperature ranges.    Remembre though that you'd need to have maybe 4-5 variates in each temperature class! That is to say, 5 things growing at 5 degrees, 5 things growing at 20 degrees, etc...    good luck|`|8b2eda5565be3fd2a3201b8174ae5e62aa	For biology, genetics of plants would be a good project.|`|58dfa7f06d30f2cfad6415591abac5f6aa	You could also see where in your school bacteria grows the most.

However, you can also divide:    x ^ 3 + px ^ 2 - qx + 30 / x - 2 = x ^ 2 + (p-2)x + (-q + 2p - 4)  x ^ 3 -  2x ^ 2  -----------------        (p-2)x ^ 2 - qx        (p-2)x ^ 2 - (2p-4)x        -------------------------                        (-q + 2p - 4)x + 30                        (-q + 2p - 4)x + -2q + 4p - 8                        ------------------------------------                                                 30 + 2q - 4p + 8    So now you know that, since there is no remainder:    30 + 2q - 4p + 8 = 0  2q - 4p = -38  2p - q = 19    Now you do the second division:    x ^ 3 + px ^ 2 - qx + 30 / x - 3 = x ^ 2 + (p-3)x + (-qx + 3p - 9)  x ^ 3 -  3x ^ 2  -----------------        (p-3)x ^ 2 - qx        (p-3)x ^ 2 - (3p-9)x       --------------------------                        (-qx + 3p - 9)x + 30                        (-qx + 3p - 9)x + (-3q + 9p - 27)                        ----------------------------------------...                                                   30 + 3q - 9p + 27    So now you now that:    30 + 3q - 9p + 27 = 0  3q - 9p = - 57  q - 3p = -19    Combining the two equations you have:    2p - q = 19  q - 3p = -19    q = 2p - 19  (2p - 19) - 3p = -19  p = 0    2(0) - q = -19  q = -19    So now you know that p is 0 and q is -19.

The object can be such things as a variable, a vector, a function, etc. For example, the coefficient of 9x2 is 9. In some cases, the objects and the coefficients are indexed in the same way, leading to expressions such as       where an is the coefficient of the variable xn for each n = 1, 2, 3,     In a polynomial P(x) of one variable x, the coefficient of xk can be indexed by k, giving the convention that for example       For the largest k where ak  0, ak is called the leading coefficient of P because most often, polynomials are written from the largest power of x, downward (i.e. x5 + x4 + x2 ...).      In linear algebra, the leading coefficient of a row in a matrix is the first nonzero entry in that row. So, for example, given       1 is the leading coefficient of the first row, 2 is the leading coefficient of the second row, 4 is the leading coefficient of the third row, and the last row does not have a leading coefficient.      Important coefficients in mathematics include the binomial coefficients, coefficients in the statement of the binomial theorem, which can be partially found with Pascal's triangle.          The extinction coefficient or molar absorbance coefficient of a protein is needed for determining its concentration through measurement by absorbance spectroscopy using the Beer-Lambert relation [Eq. 1]:      A = e  c  l    where e is the extinction coefficient (cm -1 M -1), A is the absorbance at 280 nm, c is the concentration (M) and l is the cell length (cm).  A protein's extinction coefficient is calculated by the following equation [Eq. 2]:        e 280nm[M-1 cm-1] = 5500  n Trp + 1490  n Tyr + 125  n Cys / 2    where n is the number of Tryptophan, Tyrosine and Cysteine residues and their average molar absorbances at 280 nm in native conditions are 5500, 1490 and 125 M-1 cm-1 respectively. (Pace, et al. (1995). Protein Science, 4, 2411.)    Assumptions for this calculation:     Protein does not contain a tightly bound ligand or prosthetic group that absorbs between 250 nm and 300 nm.   This method works best for globular proteins with at least one Tryptophan residue and an average distribution of buried and exposed aromatic residues.   Disulfide bonds typically occur only in secreted proteins while for cytosolic proteins, the number of disulfide bonds is assumed to be zero. For cytosolic proteins, only the Tryptophan and Tyrosine residues were used in calculating the extinction coefficient to account for the lack of disulfide bonds.   This calculation assumes that 280 nm absorbance values for Tryptophan, Tyrosine and Cysteine do not differ significantly in the native versus denatured form of the protein. In practice, however, these values can differ due to red shift of the differing environments of the native and denatured forms of the protein. For a more accurate empirical calculation of e 280nm, use the Edelhoch equation below [Eq. 3]:     e nat = e den  (A nat / A den)    where A nat and A den are the measured absorbances of the native and denatured forms of the protein at identical concentrations, and e den is calculated using [Eq. 2] above replacing the native absorbance values with the 280 nm absorbance values for Tryptophan, Tyrosine, and Cysteine model compounds in denaturing conditions, 5690, 1280, and 120 M-1 cm-1 respectively.

For example, in the expression 4x2 + 2xy  x, the coefficient of x2 is 4 (because 4x2 means 4  x2), the coefficient of xy is 2, and the coefficient of x is 1 (because 1  x = x). In general algebraic expressions, coefficients are represented by letters that may stand for numbers. For example, in the equation ax2 + bx + c = 0, a, b, and c are coefficients, which can represent any number.
f08f0168f6412f5f63d72b31d9d787efaa	aerobic respiration:  Cellular respiration is the process in which the chemical bonds of energy-rich molecules such as glucose are converted into energy usable for life processes. Oxidation of organic materialin a bonfire, for exampleis an exothermic reaction that releases a large amount of energy rather quickly. The equation for the oxidation of glucose is:                C6H12O6 + 6O2  6CO2 + 6H2O + Energy released (2830 kJ mol?1)    In a fire there is a massive uncontrolled release of energy as light and heat. Cellular respiration is the same process but it occurs in gradual steps that result in the conversion of the energy stored in glucose to usable chemical energy in the form of ATP. ATP is known as the universal currency because when the phosphoanhydride bonds in ATP are hydrolyzed in an exergonic reaction, the energy yield is 30kJ per mole under standard conditions. Waste products (CO2 + H2O) are released through exhaled air, sweat and urine.

It is the preferred method of pyruvate breakdown from glycolysis and requires that pyruvate enter the mitochondrion to be fully oxidized by the Krebs cycle. The product of this process is energy in the form of ATP (Adenosine Triphosphate), by substrate-level phosphorylation, NADH and FADH2. The reducing potential of NADH and FADH2 is converted to more ATP via an electron transport chain with oxygen as the "terminal electron acceptor". Most of the ATP produced by cellular respiration is by oxidative phosphorylation, ATP molecules are made due to the chemiosmotic potential driving ATP synthase. Respiration is the process by which cells obtain energy when oxygen is present in the cell.    Theoretically, 36 ATP molecules can be made per glucose during cellular respiration, however, such conditions are generally not realized due to such losses as the cost of moving pyruvate into mitochondria. Aerobic metabolism is more efficient than anaerobic metabolism. They share the initial pathway of glycolysis but aerobic metabolism continues with the Krebs cycle and oxidative phosphorylation. The post glycolytic reactions take place in the mitochondria in eukaryotic cells, and in the cytoplasm in prokaryotic cells.  [edit]    Glycolysis        Main article: Glycolysis    Glycolysis is a metabolic pathway that is found in the cytoplasm of cells in all living organisms and does not require oxygen. The process converts one molecule of glucose into two molecules of pyruvate, and makes energy in the form of two net molecules of ATP. Four molecules of ATP per glucose are actually produced but two are consumed for the preparatory phase. The initial phosphorylation of glucose is required to destabilize the molecule for cleavage into two triose sugars. During the pay-off phase of glycolysis four phosphate groups are transferred to ADP by substrate-level phosphorylation to make four ATP and two NADH are produced when the triose sugars are oxidized. Glycolysis takes place in the cytoplasm of the cell. The overall reaction can be expressed this way:        Glucose + 2 ATP + 2 NAD+ + 2 Pi + 4 ADP  2 pyruvate + 2 ADP + 2 NADH + 4 ATP + 2 H2O + 4 H+    [edit]    Oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate        Main article: Oxidative decarboxylation    Produces acetyl-CoA from pyruvate inside the mitochondrial matrix. This oxidation reaction also releases carbon dioxide as a product. In the process one molecule of NADH is formed per pyruvate oxidized.  [edit]    Krebs cycle/Citric Acid cycle        Main article: Citric acid cycle    When oxygen is present, acetyl-CoA enters the citric acid cycle inside the mitochondrial matrix, and gets oxidised to CO2 while at the same time reducing NAD to NADH. NADH can be used by the electron transport chain to create further ATP as part of oxidative phosphorylation. To fully oxidize the equivalent of one glucose molecule two acetyl-CoA must be metabolized by the Krebs cycle. Two waste products, H2O and CO2 are created during this cycle.  [edit]    Oxidative phosphorylation        Main articles: Oxidative phosphorylation, Electron transport chain, Electrochemical gradient, and ATP synthase    In eukaryotes, oxidative phosphorylation occurs in the mitochondrial cristae. It comprises of the electron transport chain that establishes a proton gradient (chemiosmotic potential) across the inner membrane by oxidizing the NADH produced from the Krebs cycle. ATP is synthesised by the ATP synthase enzyme when the chemiosmotic gradient is used to drive the phosphorylation of ADP.  [edit]    Theoretical yields    The yields in the table below are for one glucose and molecule being fully oxidised to carbon dioxide. It is assumed that all the reduced coenzymes are oxidised by the electron transport chain and used for oxidative phosphorylation.  Step coenzyme yield ATP yield Source of ATP  Glycolysis preparatory phase -2 Phosphorylation of glucose and fructose 6-phosphate uses two ATP from the cytoplasm.  Glycolysis pay-off phase 4 Substrate-level phosphorylation  2 NADH 4 Oxidative phosphorylation. Only 2 ATP per NADH since the coenzyme must feed into the electron transport chain from the cytoplasm rather than the mitochondrial matrix.

The variation in pH between teas is going to be relatively small, probably completely dependent on the brand, and unlikely to correlate significantly with taste in my opinion.  I personally believe tea pH values will probably be closer to 5 or potentially even lower since most teas are composed almost exclusively of compounds containing carboxylic acids, which typically have pKas of 3-5.    Honestly, since the pH will likely vary by brand, length of brewing, method of brewing (boiling water, hot but not boiling water, etc.), the numbers won't mean much.  If all you have access to is pH paper which is at best only accurate to +/- 1 pH unit then you have not been given the tools to study this problem.  I would therefore be honest and say that within the error range of the sampling method, all teas are approximately the same pH, and that therefore the pH is not likely to be the primary determinant of the taste.  That is a scientifically accurate statement that represents a higher-order thinking than "here are some numbers I don't know what they mean."    In case you've got no idea what I'm blabbering about, it's like saying "measure the height of people and the reason for the variation in their typing speed."  And then you only get a ruler that can measure feet, not even inches.

OK, as to your question. pH paper is not sensitive enough to detect the differences between types of tea. You need a pH meter since the differences are probably less than a half pH point. I would guess tea has a pH of 5 to 6. Decaffeinated tea will have a lower pH since caffeine is basic.

In the 12th week of the pregnancy the fingers and toes begin to separate and become individual fingers and toes and bones begin to harden. Your toes must not have separated properly during this stage in the pregnancy.

Some genes dominate, and are expressed; others recede and are not expressed (but they are still there)    Webbing between toes must be a recessive trait. Each parent carried an allele of the gene (their genotype = UNWEBBED/webbed) so neither expressed the gene, their phenotype was seperated toes. But when they had a kid, he/she inherited the genotype webbed/webbed, with the phenotype (the expression of the gene) as webbed toes.     The recessive genes can be passed for indefinite hundreds of generations without being lost, or expressed until it meets another copy of itself.    ;-)|`|AA12184011	webbed toes is a recessive trait (ww).

Es por los gases de la atmsfera.|`|b85062ba34b9112388515a212fbc0d29aa	Las manifestaciones de color del cielo se deben fundamentalmente a la interaccin de la luz del sol con la atmsfera. La luz del sol es blanca, tambin llamada policromtica (la suma de todos los colores del arco iris), y la atmsfera contiene una cierta cantidad de humedad, normalmente peque?a, as como partculas de polvo y ceniza.    Cuando un rayo de luz atraviesa un material, su direccin de propagacin se desva un cierto ngulo, que depende del tipo de material atravesado.    Los materiales transparentes se suelen caracterizar por un parmetro que se llama "ndice de refraccin", y su valor depende del color de la luz que atraviesa el material.    As, al atravesar un material, cada color contenido en un haz de luz blanca se desviar un ngulo diferente, dando lugar a la conocida separacin de la luz en varios colores detrs de un prisma.         Cada color contenido en la luz blanca se caracteriza por un nmero que se llama "longitud de onda". La desviacin de los colores de la luz es mxima para los azules (con longitud de onda menor), es decir, son los colores que ms cambian su direccin con respecto al rayo blanco inicial, y es mnima para los amarillos y los rojos (con longitud de onda mayor), que casi no son desviados.       Los rayos azules, una vez desviados, vuelven a chocar con otras partculas del aire, variando de nuevo su trayectoria. Realizan por tanto un recorrido en zigzag a travs de la atmsfera, hasta llegar a nosotros. Es por eso que cuando llegan a nuestros ojos parece que llegan de todos los lugares del cielo. Los rayos amarillos no aparecen casi desviados y sta es la razn de que el sol nos parezca amarillo.      Cuando el sol est muy bajo en el cielo sus rayos pasan a travs de un gran espesor de aire y los rayos de luz interactuarn ms veces con las partculas de la atmsfera. Los azules y los violetas son esparcidos hacia los lados con mayor fuerza que lo son los amarillos y los rojos, que continan propagndose en la lnea de visin del sol, formando esas magnficas puestas de sol en la Tierra.         interaccin entre la luz y las partculas de peque?o tama?o    En general, cuando una onda electromagntica (como es la luz del sol) incide sobre un tomo aislado o una molcula peque?a, interacciona con una nube de electrones enlazados, comunicando energa al tomo. Esto hace que el nivel ms bajo de energa del tomo (su estado base o natural) se ponga en vibracin.    Estos electrones oscilantes no permanecen en este estado mucho tiempo, sino que regresan a su estado base rerradiando una cierta parte de la energa que absorbieron inicialmente.    Esto significa que si la luz incidente es blanca, compuesta por ondas de diferente longitud de onda (diferente color), la luz reemitida contendr mayor cantidad de colores con longitud de onda peque?a (azules y violetas) que con longitud de onda grande (amarillos y rojos). Llegamos por tanto a la misma conclusin, cuando la luz choca con estas particulas de peque?o tama?o, reenvian las ondas azules y violetas y son estas las que vemos.   Interaccin entre la luz y las partculas de gran tama?o.     Para ser llamadas partculas "grandes", deben tener tama?o mayor que la longitud de onda de la luz. El comportamiento de las partculas grandes de la atmsfera en este caso es como si fueran un espejo, sin preferencia por ninguna componente de color de la luz blanca incidente.    Este tipo de interaccin ocurre con las nubes del cielo, que estn compuestas por gotas de agua incoloras de gran tama?o. Estas gotas reflejan como un espejo la luz blanca policromtica que incide sobre ellas sin alterar sus color. Por eso las nubes aparecen tan blancas en el cielo.|`|303c66fe6c479d8392bc44cfc53c3c33aa	porque no es rojo|`|b4c5c3d0bb5f151c30e9713b5bc5cf2baa	no es azul lo que pasa es que nos han inculcado tanto que es azul que no los creemos adems nuestra retina lo ve de ese modo por que nuestro sistema central perifrico se lo trasmite a nuestro cerebro y este lo ve de esa manera|`|748bff0d57f7471be13cc412abb0ab61aa	POR EL OXIGENO QUE HAY EN EL AIRE, SI HOBIERA OXIGENO EN MARTE SE VERIA TAMBIEN AZUL.

The environment in the nucleus differs in many ways from that of the cytoplasm. To separate these two environments from each other the nucleus is enclosed by a double membrane, and the only connection to the surrounding cytoplasm is through channels called the nuclear pore complex (NPC).  When it is time for the mRNA to leave the nucleus, the mRNA is believed to be "tagged" by proteins which serve as export signals, directing the mRNA to the nuclear pore complex that the mRNA is to leave. The mRNA and it's bound export proteins then attaches to export receptors and the whole complex (RNA, export signal proteins and export receptors) is translocated through the nuclear pore complex.

The DNA of some organisms, most notably of the PBS1 phage, have Uracil (U) instead of T.[3]    Each strand of DNA is a covalently linked chain of nucleotides, with alternating sugar (deoxyribose)-phosphates forming the "backbone" for the nucleobases ("bases"). The negatively-charged phosphate groups between each deoxyribose make DNA an acid in solution and allow DNA molecules of different sizes to be separated by electrophoresis. Because DNA strands are composed of these nucleotide subunits, they are polymers. The major difference between DNA and RNA is the sugar, 2-deoxyribose in DNA and ribose in RNA.|`|3fcf578970658d49e1e79f4a180973a4aa	urbal essence

E' il tuo cuore che sceglie qual' il dio che t'appartiene.|`|e391fb8a8d2ecae5948178433a49bca9aa	questa e una domanda alla quale milioni di persone cercano di rispondere da millenni,se otterrai una risposta fammelo sapere....|`|755cdf97b8aab120883b38d2f9e31d5aaa	Anche se qualche volta sarei portato a pensare diversamente, sono fondamentalmente credente.

Quindi non esiste,  un'invenzione della nostra immaginazione (Feuerbach)|`|6c3b23675eaedfbfc338ab7fcc7c3d1eaa	dio.....e noi cosa siamo..prima non dovremo capire cosa siamo noi per poi poter chiederci se esiste un'entit di forza maggiore??'ciao|`|91aa1ad5250c597969e806e4f775fd58aa	la risposta piu sostenibile alla creazione dell'uomo non  dio. Come se io ti dicessi che sono stata io perch ho dei poteri magici..dio  stato inventato come sono state inventate le fiabe e le storielle..i bambini chiedono come nascono i bambini e gli si dice che li porta la cicogna..gli adulti si chiedono come  stato creato l'universo, e si rispondono che  stato dio..dio ha creato tutto, dio fa il bene (ma non il male!! quelli siamo noi eh!) dio ci ha dato le belleze di questo mondo, dio ci ha messi al mondo per vedere come si comportavamo, e se ci comportavamo bene allora avevamo il premio del paradiso!! ma che bello eh? ma perch dovete trovare x forza un senso alla vita? vivere per andare in un posto migliore? NO!!NO CAXXO si vive e basta!!!! perch vorreste qualcosa di piu? esistere dovrebbe essere abbastanza. Essere, provare emozioni, vivere la vita che sia facile o complicata. continuo a ripetere, voi dite che dio ha creato tutto, ma lui?? si  fatto da solo?? ma come  possibile?? nessuno si fa dal nulla..e cos' il nulla? sono cose a cui non si puo rispondere allora ci inventiamo che  stato un essere superiore. Sono cose che non potremmo sapere mai quindi rassegnatevi..se ci credete bene, vorr dire che io andro' all'inferno e voi ve la godrete in paradiso a cantare felici con gli angioletti ad adulare dio, che alla fine vuole solo questo,  tanto buono si, ma pretende che noi tutti abbiamo fede, che crediamo in lui, preghiamo ecc.. che poi mi chiedo..tutti sti credenti..perch non aspettano il matrimonio x fare sesso?? Dio vuole cosi no? attenti andate all'inferno!! No aspetta..vai dal prete che tanto ti assolve.. ma chi l'ha deciso che i preti possono assolvere i peccati?? l'ha detto dio? nn credo proprio.. dio ha detto di andare in chiesa? neanche.. ma la gente ci va lo stesso..a "trovarlo", la chiesa sarebbe la sua casa..ma nn  onniscente? le chiese sono state fatte molto dopo dell'epoca di "gesu'" e prima erano solo dei luoghi segreti in cui la gente andava a pregare, senno' li uccidevano..ora  diventato un luogo da frequentare quasi obbligatoriamente..il prete ti fa.. "vai in chiesa"? no? "10 ave maria 3 padre nostro" io..nn capisco..vabb cmq adesso vado a letto, sia perch mi starete infamando, sia xke non so se siete arrivati a leggere fino a sto punto, sia perch la mia micia mi sta aspettando (dorme in fondo al mio letto ^_^) buonanotte a tutti gente io ho detto quello che pensavo scusatemi se vi ho offesi in qualche modo...ciao ciao|`|753ae2b5d14ea7e3c98b9918d9409b28aa	Dio esiste!!!!!   lui ke ha fatto tutto!!!!

Winner...se non era per gli scienziati credevamo ancora che la terra non fosse rotonda, che il sole girasse intorno ad essa, che l'evoluzione non fosse mai esistita...loro cercano prove concrete degli avvenimenti che avvengono nel mondo, ci non significa che non credano in Dio.|`|071e2266f77153a13299a24dc29e54abaa	bhoooo
