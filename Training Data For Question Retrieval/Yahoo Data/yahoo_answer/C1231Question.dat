Now, equation 1 implies that P is inversely proportional to R, but the second eqn shows that P is directly proportional to R...how is it possible?...wat does it actually mean...?   pls help!!!...

Ok, I again started to have math anxiety way before I even start the semester (it starts on August and I don't know why Im getting these anxiety attacks) and want to know if anyone else has had this problem. I usually fear math basically because I do have fear of success and failure at the same time. My biggest weakness in math is anything higher than basic, so stuff like pre-algebra and above will give me problems. My friend says "its easy" but if thats the case why am I having problems? I don't want to deal with special ed versions of math anymore, I just want to face the challenge right then and there. Anyone been through this? Please help!       Rules:   1)Describe your math anxiety if you have one.   2)Tell me how you dealt with it.   3)And did your methods succeeded.        You don't have to write a novel about it, just let me know.

You may assume that all 26 letters in the alphabet, of which 5 are vowels and 21 are consonants, are used for each of the random choices.   (i) Find the probability that the random letters on the plate are MSD, appearing in that order. [2]   (ii) Find the probability that the letters are M, S, D in any order.

On the side wall is a speically designed target on an 80 x 80 cm board. The target had three concentric circles with radii 8cm, 16cm, and 24cm. Each customer is given one dart to throw at the board. They win a free super-supreme pizza if they hit the inner circle, a medium pizza if they hit the middle area and a thick shake for the area in the outer circle. If they miss the circles, they pay full price for their order. (anyone who misses the board is allowed a rethrow.)      a) Find the probability that:   i) Jill wins a super supreme   ii) Peter wins a thick shake   iii) Hannah wins a prize   iv) Alison pays full price   b) If each customer is allowed two throws (and possibly can win two prizes), find the probablity that:   i) Petro wins two prizes   ii) Janus wins one prize   iii) Leigh fails to win at all   iv) Scotty wins at least one prize      Thanks so much!

20090221055133AA2PMzk	Science & Mathematics;Astronomy & Space	Orange object/light low on horizon about 10pm Friday night?	Anybody know what this was or saw it? I'm in Stoke On Trent UK and it was in the western area.  At first I thought it could have been a star or planet as there were some stars visible where it wasn't cloudy.  But then I noticed how cloudy it was where this orange light was and thought it couldn't have been a star or planet as it couldn't penetrate through that much thick cloud.  Looked perhaps abit bigger than Venus can look when its shining brightly but this was an orangey colour.  Thinking it was a UFO.  It just disappeared later (didn't see it go but it was there one minute and gone the next).   There was no noise like a helicopter noise or anything and both me and my Mum saw it for about 15 mins ish.  It stayed dead still in the sky the whole time I saw it and at one point I thought it had got abit brighter.

Project Idea   I need to design and build a bridge that is able of carrying a class textbook. The bridge must be   able to carry a text book for at least 10 seconds. Expect text book weights of 0.5 kg, 1   kg, 1.5 kg, 2 kg, etc. The goal is to have a bridge that can carry the heaviest book for   the longest time, yet has a low weight and a small size.   Project Rules   ? Materials are limited to A4 blank copy white paper, scotch-tape, and staples.   ? The bridge must fit into a box of size: Height (8 inch) x Width (10 inch) x Length   (15 inch).   ? The book must be at least 6 inch above the bottom of the bridge.   ? The bridge can not be taped or attached to the ground.   ? You are not allowed to paint the bridge.   ? You are not allowed to use any type of glue.   ? You are only allowed to use blank A4 white copy paper

Things are again hotting up with regard to international collaboration between Russia, the U.S., Europe and possibly China, jointly funding a mission to mars (just as the author Mr Ben Bova envisaged). I don't wish to start a debate on the physical principle of actually getting there, my question is purely of a moral nature. My question is simply this;    Assuming each participating nation had at least one guaranteed representative (male or female) on board, I just wondered if anyone could come up with a strategy in deciding which Astronaut, Cosmonaut or Taikonaut would have the legendary honour of taking the first historic steps on the planet, and what language would be spoken in the equally legendary speech at that defining moment, a' la Neil Armstrong's historical "One small step for man" speech.    It's a serious question guys, as I believe it has serious political ramifications if, and when, humankind make that incredible, (though I believe inevitable) journey.

20090203095830AAsope9	Science & Mathematics;Astronomy & Space	. Suppose the Earths axis had no tilt. Would we still have seasons?	i think no,,,, but im not too sure...because Precession does not change the amount of the axis tilt, thus does not have any affect on the seasons. But because the solstices and equinoxes correspond to points in the Earths orbit that depend in the direction the earths axis points in space, their position in the orbit gradually shift with the cycle of precession.  As a result the constellations associated with the solstices and equinoxes gradually change. This all kind of confuses me?    thanks for your help.
