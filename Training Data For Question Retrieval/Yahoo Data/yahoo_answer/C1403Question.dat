20071117212147AAceVJC	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	?Las mujeres tienden a ser mas masoquistas que los hombres?	Por lo que me he dado cuenta existen mas mujeres masoquistas que hombres, me refiero a que hay mas mujeres a las que les gusta sufrir, recibir desprecios y ser maltratadas por su pareja o por la persona de que están enamoradas.      Yo he visto que hay muchas chicas que se enamoran de alguien que las utiliza, las enga?a, las despecia, las hace sentir celos, y las trata mal, y sin embargo, allí siguen ellas con tal de conquistarlo o de conservar su amor.      Los hombres en cambio es menos común que acepten ser plato de segunda mesa, que acepten infidelidades, desprecios y malos tratos por el amor.      Bueno, eso creo yo desde mi punto de vista de hombre, aunque puede ser que si hallan hombres así, pero que por pena no lo reconozcan, así que esta pregunta va dirigida sobre todo a las mujeres:    ?Crees que lo que he dicho es correcto?   ?Crees que el masoquismo es mas común entre las mujeres?   ?Acaso alguna ves tu te has topado con un hombre masoquista que te aguante todo?.

El poder de compra argentino es el mejor de la región                                            Según informe del FMI, la Argentina continúa a la cabeza de la paridad de compra en relación al PBI per cápita, por encima de Chile y Brasil                                                               En tanto, el FMI, en su informe semestral sobre Perspectiva Económica Mundial, difundido a mediados de abril, destacó que Argentina será el país con mayor crecimiento de la región durante este a?o, 7,5 por ciento.      Así, según las proyecciones del organismo, el Producto Interno Bruto (PIB) per cápita por poder de paridad de compra de Argentina será de 17.062 dólares, superior al de Chile, que se estimó en 13.804, y al de Brasil, previsto en 9.531 dólares.      Este PIB por poder de compra se consigue comparando el producto total con la cantidad de habitantes de cada país, eliminando la distorsión del tipo de cambio y neutralizando el problema de las disparidades entre las monedas de cada país.    En ese aspecto, el director gerente del Fondo Monetario Internacional (FMI), Rodrigo Rato, dijo que América Latina está en una buena situación, en medio de un periodo de sostenido crecimiento económico, pero también avisó que la tasa de pobreza es "inaceptablemente alta" en la mayoría de la región.      Por ello, expresó que "la región está disfrutando de un sólido crecimiento y baja inflación" y que la institución espera que el crecimiento económico real "esté ligeramente por debajo del cinco por ciento en el 2007 y alrededor del cuatro por ciento en el 2008".

I usually try to keep mine in check but only because I have difficulty timing it on my period with precision.      "Girlish psycho drama" is when a woman picks up on all of these subtle nuances all at once and takes them all the wrong way, in the worst possible way. When she overanalyzes things, reads too much into things and gets upset over nothing, knowing that it is nothing but still feeling upset and annoyed just the same.

He WAS friends with me and my sister.. but he moved because he got into a fight with his brother, and we haven't heard from him since.   Okay so to my dream, he was there, and he was hanging out with me and he looked so skinny, i mean this boy was skinny already, but in my dream he looked skinnier, and he looked sad too, so we were siting on these bleachers at my apartments where he used to live, and the sun was shining and i saw that his eyes were a different color, they were blue.. so i got up and i saw a dead butterfly those colorful ones, it was big. Then i saw a dead Caterpillar, and then all of the sudden it came alive again. Then my sister got home, and he told her he had always liked her (in real life it looked like he did) and so they kissed and he was happy again..       What does that mean?? and like right now i was on youtube listening to music and that one song "how to save a life" came up and i was watching it, and then i saw the butterfly and it looked like the one in my dream..and so did the caterpillar, like the same thing happened with the butterfly in my dream. So does that mean anything? i might not but i don't know, im that type of person that thinks a lot about something.   THANKS A LOT!

20090309070003AApWDsZ	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	What are some psychological causes of rape fantasies? Biological, social, philosophical, causes too.   I belie?	What are some psychological causes of rape fantasies? Biological, social, philosophical, causes too.       I believe the sociobiology theories which say that the rape=mindset is hardwired into men, because it was an evolutionarily affective strategy for early tribes.   I've been aroused by girls in pain or humilation since I was a child, and started moving towards rape fantasies when I was around 10. I read a lot of rape fantasy porn, comics, stories, pictures movies etc on the internet. And its the only stimulation that can get me aroused. I also am stimulated by real accounts of rape and fantasize about girls I know. Just seeing women hurt or in pain arouses me. I know the suffering rape causes women, which is exactly what turns me on. I don't mean to offend anyone or sound misogynist, these are just the FANTASIES that I'm aroused by.      Just to be clear those are just my FANTASIES. And don't affect my real-world interaction with women, and I would never really hurt anyone.      I'm just curious on what you think the psychological causes are, and whether this is healthy. If it is unhealthy is there anything I can do to remove them?

20090309093853AAL01O6	Social Science;Psychology	What would be your advice to me?	Well I've always been the shy/quiet type. And that has really affected my social health in school and in life in general. Everytime I am in a situation where I have to work with a group of people, I end up awkwardly being the one who's by myself, an outsider, the person who laughs at jokes, smiles at people, but never gets any direct interest from them. This is puzzling because I've always been a nice person. But when I am faced in situations where I meet new people, nobody ever shows any real interest in getting to know me any better. For example, they won't ask my number or anything (as they would do others)      People are impersonal with me. I started college 3 years ago. I didn't really make any close friends, but only a few acquaintances. I would cry in my dorm room very often (getting involved in activities on campus didn't help me to bond wih anyone either).       Even today (3 years later), I still have this problem. I'm a junior now (at the same college). My situation has not changed. I find that I am more active around campus. I've started going to the sports events and I joined an organization, but nothing has changed. I still find that I'm by myself all day every day. On the weekends I hang out with my old friends (the ones Ive been knowing forever). But as far as getting new people to take interest in me, it's still a challenge.      It's especially difficult nowadays because I'm at the age where I'm ready to start dating. I have never been in a relationship before. And of course, Im a healthy adult woman, it's only natural to crave some sort of male companionship. But because of everything I've mentioned above, I have a sort of distorted view that I might be alone forever because nobody really takes interest in me.      What do you think I should do? Am I that horrible of a person? I really want to start having fun before my youth is over!

20090309094917AAQe5yh	Social Science;Psychology	From a purely psychological point of view, is it a good dissertation idea to use the "Twilight" books as an?	example of controlling, abusive relationships?        It bothers me to think how many (easily influenced) teenage girls think that sort of relationship is normal and romantic.  I'd love to say Stephanie Meyer intentionally wrote a satyr, but somehow I doubt that's true.      Obviously, I'm not the only one to think this.  A quick Google search on the topic brings up this site.  http://sparrow.beyondtherift.com/blog/?p...       I'm curious about what psychologically-minded people have to say on this topic.  (I, for one, am sick of all the gushing, teenager hype - especially in the "Polls & Surveys" and "Books & Authors" sections.)
20090309102204AAZMFR8	Social Science;Psychology	What is the difference between optical illusion and synesthesia?	For example, I associate pink with green against white.      At school there are whiteboards and if there is anything green against the whiteboard (say a green podium), I see pink floating around.      It's the same with green mahjong tiles against a white table.          How do I know if it's an optical illusion or a type of synesthesia? I'm not saying I have synesthesia, but how can one tell?      We are all born synesthetes but for most of us the extra neural connections are pruned away.

20090309095743AAArYST	Social Science;Psychology	Do I have to do this or am I just damaging my mind?	DO NOT answer this question, unless you are going to be mature and serious about it.  NO INSULTS!  Thank you.   --------------------------------------...      I am a very sensitive person.  My greatest weakness is reading about or seeing someone frightened, suffering and in pain in movies or whatever.      I wanna be able to see on TV/Youtube and read about really intense stuff like that without feeling so overwhelmed with fear, stress and intense sadness for the other person (fiction or non-fiction).      I'm a lot more of a cartoon person and am not a fan of horror movies (except George Romero's zombie movies).  So, I recently began to watch a few horror movies and stuff on Youtube, believing that if I could get myself used to reading and watching horrific suffering and stuff, it would make me desensitized to it and it would no longer hurt me.        However, I have found the EXACT OPPOSITE is happening to me right now.  Instead of getting used to it, the more I view the contents I personally find disturbing, the WORSE I feel.  My stress levels have gone sky-high, I feel like I'm going to break down into tears, I'm scared and feel full of hatred and disgust at myself.  I can't even watch the Saw movies because of the horrific way the people are being hurt, but I really wanna be able to watch those movies.      Will I ever be able to kill my compassion and sensitivity or is repetitive viewing of the disturbing content simply damaging my mind?      Do I HAVE to do this?!  Would it make me mentally stronger if I carried on or just damage me?

20090309103749AA6iTcJ	Social Science;Psychology	What would you do if you were me?	First of all this will be long so please no harassments, judgements and accusations.      Second of all I have a rare disease that prevented me from reaching puberty until age 23. I see an endocrinologist and he put me on birth control pills to produce and maintain estrogen.      I want to go to a missions college and a friend of mine is helping me imrpove a lot in one year so I can be able to go and she said to befriend her husband so he can be a refrence too.      Remember when I said I just reached puberty last summer? I'm 24 now and I am a horny son of a gun.  Now please keep in mind I would NEVER get involved with a married man and I am against adultery.  I live in a small town where every guy is married.  This couple is 40.  I'd date single guys 24-40.      Now I don't see that dream of going to a missions college come true because now I'm romantically attracted to my friend's husband.  So I'm running away from him, temptation and my church and going somewhere else.  I want to go to a missions college but with my raging hormones I can't deal with it and I never act on it but still!  The last guy(who moved away) I was first sexually attracted to, everytime he was around I wanted to tear off his clothes and devour him(he was single but now has a girlfriend).      What would you do if you were me?  Would you ditch the missions dream and move to a big city and meet single people?  Or what?      The husband and wife know because they'll know why I am running.  She said I can't keep running everytime I run into a godly guy I'm attracted to.  Well yeah I do if he's married!

20090309113741AArIvsJ	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	What do you think this dream meant? Should we be friends again?	Last night I had a dream about one of my friends (or ex-friend). Since high school started, she became popular and we kinda drifted apart which really bummed me out (actually, I lost a lot of friends, but losing her hurt the most). Anyway, back to my dream.  My current friends and I hang out at this stair case by one of the buildings at school, this is where the dream started. I walked up and saw my ex friend and another friend (who is mutual between us). I said hi to the mutual friend (she'll be S) then I said hi to my ex friend (she'll be Y), but Y just looked at me and turned her back to me. Then S and Y left. Y came back to get something and then she told me something. I didn't heard what she said, but it was probably something I did that made her stop being friends with me. Then she left and I ran after her and I ended up on the other side of the building, and then I ended up in the really big, nice house that apparently was her house (she isn't rich in real life). Then I walked into her room and it was really huge (she had two walk in closets with really nice clothes and she he a second floor in her room). It looked like a roomcthat would be on Cribs. Anyway, I saw two friend and I asked them where Y was and they just looked at me like "what are you doing here?", so I asked my best friend (who doesn't even like Y) where she was and she told me Y was on the ecnd floor. Just as I was about to go up the stairs, Y and someone else fame down. I ran to her, gave her a big hug (which she returned) and I started crying and told her I'm sorry, told her I miss her, and she said that its okay and we can be friends again. Then I left, and there was a bunch of her friends coming I guess it was for her sweet sixteen.      So yeah, sorry I think I made it a little confusng hah.   She was one of my best friend (along with another girl, K). Thy are still friends, and I talk to K sometimes, buri really miss being friends with both of them

20090309104244AAu7Gwe	Social Science;Psychology	Men are so cryptic sometimes.  Can you read over this email and help me figure out what he meant by this?	Okay, some back story.  Really good friends, best friends, in an awkward phase.  He has said he likes me before but has gotten very weird recently.  Here is an email I sent to him after he confessed to me that he feels like I don't give a sh** about him:         "you have a HUGE, HUGE impact on me.  more than anyone else i know.  i don't usually give a crap about what anybody thinks about me or anything else, but i am always taking into consideration what you would think about something.  your opinion matters to me more than my own sometimes.  you have the ability to make or break my day, shatter or mend my heart even with just a few words (or no words at all).  i don't think you realize that, and how would you?  i hide it so well because i don't like feeling so vulnerable.  i glanced over some of the things i've written on that site from the past because i forget what stuff i put in there, and a lot of things i wrote in there are directly about you or inspired by you. i'm sure you could easily figure it out.  anyway, my point is that the things you say and do really affect me, for better or worse, and i don't think that that would be the case if you were just a "puppy dog" to me.  it just sucks that you don't think i care, because in reality, i care so much that it hurts.  that's all."      Here was his response:      "To be honest, I don't really know how to respond to   these emails. I'm not upset with you, I don't want to   quit talking to you. You've got a lot of shields up,   and knowing where you've been in life, it is probably   necessary. When you say it is out of shyness, that may   be. However, it comes across as a protection   mechanism. If things don't work out, or someone   rejects you... then **** it, because they never really   knew you anyway. Along the same lines, you stroke my   ego as having some God-like influence on you and I   usually buy it. I think thats just what you do when   you fear losing someone. I'm not going anywhere, but I   need to be able to step back and realize that I'm not   a special flower. I've accepted you for who you are,   so lets just move forward.    You are very good at keeping people out and those you   let in, you know how to stroke their egos enough that   they'll stay around. I would hate getting an email   like this from you, its way easier to live in my own   mind. Understand that I'm not saying any of this to be   mean or hurtful. I'm just giving you my perspective,   and as you said... thats all it is. It is completely   possible that I am wrong."      We have always had a very close, affectionate friendship and he made no secret of telling me how much he liked me.  Now, after a silly little argument he is a completely different person to me.  Please help me understand what he is getting at in this email.

20090309103558AAfbWCi	Social Science;Psychology	What should I do?  (very long...complicated situation)?	I'm in my mid-twenties and the only reason that I still live with my mother is because I love her and SHE wants me there. I have fantasized about moving out several times and I have the financial resources to do so, but each time, I envision her screaming, crying, and wiping me out of her life. I even gave up chances to go to Harvard and Juilliard for her (seriously). I would miss her so much if she wiped me out of her life. Mom says that she HAS to wipe her children out of her life when they move out because she simply cannot trust anyone who has lived elsewhere without her supervision. (I've seen it happen with older siblings). She wants to pay for everything, although I force her to take my money to help with bills because I don't like to live off of someone else.      Still, she always showers me with cash, but she is very controlling. I have tried refusing her money (to gain freedom), but it does not work.      She will not let me shave, trim my split ends, etc. and she must know where I am at all times. I once was fifteen minutes late and she called the police...even though she had just talked to me twenty minutes ago. (It takes forty minutes to get home and it was during rush hour!)      I am now preparing to go to school two hours away for my doctorate degree. This means that the school will be paying for most of my expenses with scholarships and sometimes I will sleep and eat at the dorm instead of her house.   However, every time that I make the drive to the school to visit the admissions office, she finds some bizarre reason to get mad at me. For instance, once she got mad on the day that I was driving to the school for a test because I tried to make sure that everyone would get a chance to have a "family prayer". It was absurd for her to get upset over this because we have been doing this since I was five years old. She said that she is the only one who is allowed to organize the family prayer...although a few months before, she said that she wished that I would be more responsible and take charge of the prayer. Several things have happened like this... she tells me to do something and gets mad when I do it!       I have never drank alcohol or smoked, or even dated. In fact, I have never kissed a boy or held hands... so she has no reason to think that my decisions are "bad".  Any thing that she did not think of or say is a "bad" decision.   She has accused me of things and when I tell her the truth, that I didn't do them, she calls me "sassy", a "liar" and "possessed" and she threatens to put me out of the house with my furniture on the street if I don't confess to her "crime". (It's quite strange that she doesn't want me to move out, but would get a kick out of putting me out unexpectedly...????)   I have been called names such as "Demon" and "Possessed by the Devil", "Used by the Devil" and everything else for not doing exactly what she says...even when I know better. Every thing is controlled. She watches what I eat and goes overboard to make sure that I eat what she wants me to eat. She will literally sit across from me at 11:00 p.m. just to watch me eat and make comments about everything that I choose to eat or not eat.      I am basically a straight-A student, I was a Summa C_m Laude graduate and a valedictorian. In about three years, I will have completed the coursework required to be a professor. Most moms would be proud of me but she compliments me very little and mostly finds ways to point out "faults" - mostly of which are accusations and sometimes tries to come up with reasons that I should postpone finishing my degree and work in a local establishment so that I can spend time with her. She always complains about me not spending enough time with her when I spend every minute that I'm not doing homework with her. (I'm the one who's being neglected because I get NO time to myself).      My sister is in her thirties and she lives there (for the same reasons) and she is absolutely terrified of living on her own. She has been so pampered and brainwashed my Mom that she has no concept of living on her own. Any time that she does anything on her own, she is yelled at. I think that my sister is "cracking up" now because she hides things, sneaks around town, and lies quite often. She also is beginning to think that everyone is talking about her and that everyone is hiding things, etc. I think that the only way that my sister has found to rebel against the control is through deception.      I do not want to go crazy but I don't want to be wiped out of my mother's life.  What should I do?

20090309091858AARvX3z	Social Science;Psychology	Very bizarre/awkward situation with a guy... please help me understand what this means?	Okay, this is a little long but I promise 10 points to a well-thought out answer as soon as Yahoo lets me, and I will answer a question of yours in return.   I have been best friends with this guy for 10 years now. We have always liked eachother as much more than friends, but due to location/timing we never were in a "real" relationship. We are extremely comfortable with eachother and we tell eachother everything, but all of a sudden he's been very strange and I have no idea what's going on.      It started a few weeks ago with an argument. It was my fault- I was in a bad mood, and I was on medication that made me even moodier. He was talking about this girl at work who likes him and was explaining all the mind games she plays. I was annoyed that he was talking about a girl for 2 hours straight, so I said mean/angry things until he finally hung up on me.       I immediately apologized the next day, and didn't hear from him for a few days (understandable). When he finally did get in touch with me, we ended up having a very weird conversation. He explained that after I freaked out on him, he wasn't sure if "this was what he wanted". He confessed a TON of things to me about our friendship/relationship that I had no idea about. He said things such as, he feels like he is being manipulated by me, I'm hard to rationalize with, he's not happy with the state of our friendship, etc. He basically laid out on the line all the things he was unhappy about between us. He wasn't mean about it, just very, very firm. He asked for me to work on my flaws, and said that he would work on his part of the friendship.      I later sent him an email letting him know how much he really meant to me, and promising to do better by showing it. I told him that he had a huge effect on me whether he realized it or not. His response- HE DOESNT BELIEVE ME. He said that he thinks I view him as a puppy dog and that I tell him I love him only to stroke his ego so that he'll stick around. He also said he thinks I pretend that he has an influence on me because that's what I do when I'm scared of losing someone. He kept saying over and over that he doesn't want to quit talking to me and that he's not "going anywhere", but that he needs to be able to step back and realize that he's nothing special to me.       I texted him last night and told him I felt really confused/humiliated that he refused to believe how I felt about him, and that I was going to back off and give him his space. His response- "I do care about you. Maybe a little time is a good think, but I do hope it isn't forever". I replied saying it probably would be for the best.      What does this guy want from me??? I don't understand? And why does he REFUSE to believe my feelings for him? I am so hurt that he took my most sincere words and threw them back in my face like they were nothing. We have known each other for so long and suddenly it's like I don't know who he is at all. PLEASE GIVE ME SOME INSIGHT!      By the way, we are both over 25, so this is not a pre-teen thing.

I believe the sociobiology theories which say that the rape=mindset is hardwired into men, because it was an evolutionarily affective strategy for early tribes.   I've been aroused by girls in pain or humilation since I was a child, and started moving towards rape fantasies when I was around 10. I read a lot of rape fantasy porn, comics, stories, pictures movies etc on the internet. And its the only stimulation that can get me aroused. I also am stimulated by real accounts of rape and fantasize about girls I know. Just seeing women hurt or in pain arouses me. I know the suffering rape causes women, which is exactly what turns me on. I don't mean to offend anyone or sound misogynist, these are just the FANTASIES that I'm aroused by.      Just to be clear those are just my FANTASIES. And don't affect my real-world interaction with women, and I would never really hurt anyone.      I'm just curious on what you think the psychological causes are, and whether this is healthy. If it is unhealthy is there anything I can do to remove them?
20090309140726AAslST5	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	Non-Feminist Ladies, What are the minimum requirements for a man to be considered "educated"?	I often see ladies who indicate that one of the more critical things they look for in a potential mate is that he be educated.      What, specifically, does this mean?  What level of formal schooling is sufficient for a lady to consider a man educated?  Which universities are regarded as the top five in terms of bachelor's degrees?  If a man attended a very prestigious academic institution but was NOT a starting footballer, how bad is this?  If a man attended a far more prestigious graduate school than the undergraduate institution, will this compensate for the deficiency?      Please discuss group feelings about this matter rather than your personal opinion—not that it's unimportant, but rather that it's more helpful to obtain information that can be generalized with greater validity.

I can understand why it would be bad to define yourself by your job if you despise it, and are only there to earn a living. But if your career is something you genuinely love and would keep doing even if you didn't have to, does it still count?

Ok, my husband insists that since everyone goes to the first bathroom stall in a public bathroom, you should always go in the second one because it's used less, and therefore cleaner.   For me, it seems obvious that everyone thinks that, and so everyone goes into the second bathroom stall thinking "ew, I wouldn't go in the first, everyone goes in there."  So I always go in the first one, and it's almost always cleaner!!   Thoughts?  Opinions?  Your own habits?

20090309143330AA7l9Aq	Social Science;Psychology	So, I think I have the opposite of social anxiety?	Well, I used to be the only girl in may all-guy group of friends, right?  Okay, so, I made this new friend, cause I have friends that are girls outside of my "guy group," and now that this new friend is hanging out with hey "guy group," everyone is paying more attention to her.      Because of that, it's making me not want to hang out with them as much when she's around.  I get the symptoms of social anxiety, but it's only around her.  I know the easiest thing to do is to not hang around with her...but it's hard when her boyfriend is one of my good friends >.<;;      So, to my understanding, Social Anxiety is fear of being social, or being in big groups...I LOVE being in big groups, it's when I'm happiest...but when she's around, I feel so little!      Help ;__;

Myself during a REM cycle, and woken up at the end explaining the dream (with pictures)      It would be split screen, filmed in 'night mode'   THe left would be me sleeping. The right would be me reading the dream out of my dream journal (I know that the dream will correspond with the REM because I will have my cousin wake me up after I start to go into a NREM cycle.       How does that sound?      It isn't supposed to be a 'movie theater' film, or in a Sundance film festival. It is supposed to shot how dreams are in the eyes of the beholder. There shall be no plot. It is Un Chien Andalou meets Andy Warhol's Bl0w J0b      You almost always remember a dream you are awoken from, so there is no problem there.      As for the synchronization, it will not be perfect. But it is kind of the meaning, that it is all in my head and you can not make the physical and mental link if you are on the outside looking in.

20090309115408AA8KLz9	Social Science;Psychology	Can a pyschiatrist be fired?	I'm working on a script for my class.  To make a long story short, the main characters (a young female patient and a middle aged court appointed psychatrist) have developed a very close relationship, almost like father/daughter.  The female patient reminds the psychiatrist of his dead daughter.       Here's my problem:  in my head, his wife, who thinks that he shouldn't get close to this girl, is going to sort of snitch on him at his job and tell them that he's developed an unhealthy relationship with his patient.  The girl ends up getting reassigned to another pyschiatrist.        My question is whether or not this is plausible.  Can a psychiatrist be moved froma patient, or a patient reassigned to another pyschiatrist?  I'm searching the internet for stuff about it and my professor's wife (who is a counselor) is igging my emails...

I don't remember it exactly.. but I had it a few days ago and someone else asked what their dream meant so I thought I would ask.      All I remember is:   Apparently he and some other cast members were at my grandmother's house with me. I took his phone and started looking through his texts and saw he had a lot from this girl he has a crush on [she's 2 yrs younger; rly does have somewhat of a crush but just got out of a relationship] and some from a girl named mandy or something like that and some from me. it looked like the mandy girl liked him [i was thinking (in my dream) it looked like it] and opened one and under her name it said "interested" so in my dream i kinda half panic.. idk almost jealous.. then tried to find some from hannah then everything got blurry.. then i was thinking about looking under my name to see if there was anything.. then i woke up. so.. is there anything to it? also... everybody thinks i like him.. like they say i get all bubbly and smile whenever i get texts from him.. and idk like it's a complicated emotion... idk if i do or not. plus he's a year younger than me.

20090309115506AAgZYEs	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	What does my dream mean?	Recently, I had a baby cousin come into my family. She was born barely a day before my birthday. The day before she was born, I had a strange dream.      A friend and I were in a camp on a volcano-type mountain. We were prisoners, and being mistreated (like in the Holocaust).  It was an all-girls camp, and we were made to work hard. My friend and I stood by each other, giving up things we owned so that we could stay together. We stayed there for many months, and our captors took us on a train. The captors would take a prisoner off each time we stopped and would lead them out into the forest and come back without the prisoner. It was like they were trying to separate all th prisoners in my camp. We were in a line. I remember it was almost my turn to leave. I looked outside, and we were in the mountains. I turned to my friend, and told her "just come and find me. We are in the mountains. We will always find each other in the mountains." The captors then took me off the train and into a bright light, when I woke up.       I realized in the dream that my friend was my new little cousin. She even looks the same as my friend in my dream, just younger. Even as she has aged, she looks the same.      What does my dream mean?       It may also help to know that the mountains where we were reminded me of the Appalachian mountains, where my ancestors have lived for several generations.
