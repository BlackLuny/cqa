If the question still exists, the only way you can delete other people's answers is to report any that violate the YA Community Guidelines.  If other users have also reported them, Y!A will delete them.    If you're talking about your answers to other peoples' questions, you can only delete them while the question is still open.  Once a question is in 'voting' or has had a best answer chosen it and all of its answers belong to Y!A and can't be deleted.    :o)|`|ZlNFOgO7aa	If you are talking about deleting the answers people gave you on the question you have deleted, then they will be gone.

It costs you 2 points for each answer you delete.

[2] If you mean your FANS, then you can remove them all by disabling the FANS option on your "Edit my Profile Info" page.    [3] You are able to view and answer questions of your blocked users.    [4] Instead of blocking everyone, why don't you make your Questions & Answers and your Network on your profile as PRIVATE (hidden) so as to avoid trolls attacks?

2f739e8b2a5530e501bad3e76a9cb2f7aa	Actually, the policy has not changed that I am aware of. It has always been the case that there were TWO levels of suspension. One was from YA only and the email account stayed intact. The OTHER was total termination of all Yahoo accounts. I've seen people mentioning this dual-level as far back as when I first started on the site.    Supposedly, the difference was due to the type of violations that triggered the suspension/termination. If the violations were against the TOS (Terms of Service) or were especially egregious in the CG area, that would trigger the termination of the email account as well.    I know that several people have had their YA account suspensions overturned and their email accounts reopened as a result, but after a year, I would assume that it is extremely unlikely -- and all the content would be gone, since Yahoo states that it deletes all content on 'inactive' accounts after 4 months.

AA11408911	Hello Mac park Melting,    The have been several comments made regarding the use of HTML coding within Yahoo! Answers. At present the official word from Yahoo! Answers staff is that HTML is not supported as they felt it would make Yahoo! Answers feel too much like a forum as opposed to a knowledge sharing community, smilies and text formatting are not supported for the same reason.     HTML can also be used for malicious practice, for example to post hidden applications such as viruses within links, to embed images and videos onto websites and bad programming within Yahoo! Answers could allow for unauthorised access via HTML use. Quite simply not allowing HTML also helps to keep the site safe.     All the best  Chrs

5fb39523f75c15b623115ea5cd8f29eeaa	The top contributor badge is not permanent and can be removed at any time. Your 10% best answers and/or participation per category have probably reduced. To get back the top contributor badge back just answer more questions in your category/s to try to improve your best answer rate and you could get it back in 2-3 weeks or so.  For more information read the blog below.  http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-d8pH0dcoR...|`|AA11510511	You need to maintain your contribution to Y/A.

suPD7c3gaa	Since we, as members, are moderators of this site, we are expect to report obvious violations.  If members don't report when they should, then we are to blame.  You don't say you've made any reports, so there's really no point, other than to go back click that "Report" button.  If that person is not only being offensive, but is also not answering the questions, then each and every one of those answers is a violation.  It's up to us as members to be responsible.|`|9BL6LFJ9aa	As zynr points out this is our site insofar as Yahoo has given us the role of moderators.

eb4a10b7d0c7b16ef422f23a98ba67beaa	"A "Top Contributor" is a member of the Yahoo Answers community who has shown that they are knowledgeable in a certain category. Each user can be a top contributor in a maximum three categories.  You earn it or lose it depending on your recent participation in a certain section.  The more positively you contribute, the more chance there is that you will get a TC badge. Just like featured users or category leaders, it's another way to give credit to community members."    The TC badge is awarded on the number of questions answered and best answers received by the user in a particular week, in a particular category.    It is rumoured that you need at least a 10 percent best answers in your chosen category to get a TC badge although the actual percentage and the number of answers is Yahoo's secret.   All you see and read on the subject is speculation, rumour, assumption and guesswork.    A user who is on the leader board may or may not have a TC badge, the criteria is measured on weekly participation in a particular category (number of answers and % of best answers in the category).    The easiest way to get a TC badge is to concentrate on one category where many questions are asked and hope to get some best answers.    The Polls and Surveys and Jokes and Riddles categories do not have Top Contributors.    If you have contributed enough to meet Yahoo's criteria, the orange badge will appear below your avatar on Monday morning.    It can disappear just as easily on Monday morning, if you don't keep answering questions in your chosen category.|`|luWaQVOfaa	A Top Contributor is someone in the Answers community who, through their participation on Answers, has shown that they are knowledgeable in a particular category. Each Answers user can be a Top Contributor in up to three categories.     Badges come and go on Monday mornings. Yahoo keeps the formula secret, and it's subject to change at any moment. It probably also varies from category to category. Experienced users have formed guesses, but they're just GUESSES.    You probably need around:    ? 30-50 answers per week in the category.  ? At least 20 ''best answers'' in the category within the last 3 weeks.  ? 200 or more total points per week (including all answers, Best Answers, votes, and "thumbs up") in the category.  ? At least a 10% best answers in your chosen category.    If your level of participation falls, you will likely lose your badge. Concentrate on participating regularly and giving high-quality answers in just a few categories to earn or keep a badge.    Good luck.|`|fZmvWv7qaa	It means that besides giving answers and opinions, you personally go to other member's homes and help out with the chores.|`|5fb39523f75c15b623115ea5cd8f29eeaa	Top contributor is someone who is knowledgeable in up to three categories. the exact formula is kept secret by yahoo but the common theory is that you need a minimum of 10 percent best answers in each particular category and is said to be reviewed weekly. the top contributor badge is not permanent and can be removed at any time. See the link for a more detailed  explanation.   http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-d8pH0dcoR...|`|owjDBCc7aa	by answering more and more question and securing more and more best answers you will move from leval to leval|`|p3mLEnyFaa	you have to send an application to Yahoo answers by post.

HOWEVER..... you should know that even when you clear history in Firefox it does NOT remove the recent URLs from the drop down address bar.  There are 2 ways to do this:    1.  Clear them one at a time (pick and choose which ones you want to delete).  Highlight the address and then click SHIFT + DEL.  This will delete that address from the dropdown list.    2. Turn off the setting that keeps addresses in the drop down all together.  This is more of an advanced task and should only be done if you are confident in your technical abilities:    1. In the Address Bar, enter about:config  2. Search for the preference browser.urlbar.maxRichResults.  3. Double-click the browser.urlbar.maxRichResults preference and enter a value of -1.  4.

Click their name link in the emails, and click BLOCK USER on their profile. This (usually) will prevent them from emailing you further.    THEN, do as Stephen K says -- forward the emails to the staff and let them take care of it. The other links offered to you are for YAHOO emails (the direct kind), not the Yahoo Answers emails.|`|8yE2sYGeaa	send the offending email to the staff (y_answrs_team@yahoo.com)|`|2payLxhxaa	Just hit the report button. On the other hand, I would say that unless you are overly sensitive and are really offended open your mind a bit and allow people to be a bit sarcastic and laugh about it. Everyone on here is too easily offended much of the time and want to report someone just because they don't agree with their answer.
2BEMSGPdaa	as someone who does a lot of blogging I learned Yahoo stuff don't  always work. What you can do is click save  and after it shows on the blog you can go back to edit and correct it if necessary..|`|7u77AiBjaa	"Preview" means only that you are viewing the display of the content - what it would look like if you saved it. You must actually click the "Save" button for something to save on your 360 space. Generally, I avoid using the "Preview" function because I'd rather spend my waiting time saving, then going back and editing if I need to do so.    As for being re-directed to your Blog Settings page, that is a common 360 glitch. Just click the "Back" button on your browser until you get to a proper page and try again.     However, these are my recommendations on how to handle blog posting in general, which will save you some frustration:  1) Create and save blogs in an external program before posting it in 360. The best program to use is Notepad. It does not add extra code to documents. So, type your text in Notepad (comes standard in Windows computers in the Accessories folder) and put  between paragraphs, click the "View HTML Source" box of your blog entry's toolbar, and paste instead. Then, uncheck the "View HTML Source" box and add extra formatting via the blog's toolbar.    It is not advisable to copy and paste content directly from a full-featured word processing program like Microsoft Word or e-mails.    2) I write short blogs directly into 360, format them, then click the "View HTML Source" box when I'm done. I copy the HTML version of the blog and paste it in a Notepad document to save.       Only after doing one of the above, do I try posting a blog in 360 because often the blog will not post.    Also, you can try posting at a different time of the day, as sometimes I find timing matters when it comes to adding content to 360.       NOTE: The Y!360 team is no longer addressing bug reports, as it prepares to migrate parts of 360 to a universal profile system (UPS). This transition was announced in October 2007 and the UPS actually started in a rudimentary beta form on October 16, 2008. The Y!360 part of the system hasn't been transferred over fully yet.   - See blogs at http://blog.360.yahoo.com/product_360 for more details. The 360 team blog is also accessible via the "Yahoo! 360 News" link in the upper right corner of your 360 space. You can post complaints on their blog, but don't expect a personal response.   - See http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-4D4zxsg6f... for more information on 360 glitches.   - See the links in these blog entries for more details on Yahoo's overall direction and UPS: http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-4D4zxsg6f... , http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-4D4zxsg6f... , and http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-4D4zxsg6f... .

All levels can pick a best answer to questions they ask and can vote for best answer on others' undecided questions.  Once you hit level 2 & get the ability to 'rate', the only difference in the levels is the daily limits on questions, answers, comments, votes, etc.    Levels 2 and up can 'rate' the answers of other Y!A users.  Rating = giving Thumbs Up & Down to express your opinion of other peoples' answers. No points are involved (unless a best answer has TUs, then they get 1 point for each TU up to 50) in rating, and thumbs do not determine the Best Answer selection.    Hints:     answer your limit of questions each day (2 points each)  get an answer selected as best answer (10 points each)  pick a best answer for your question (3 points)  vote your limit of unresolved questions each day (1 point each)  you also get a point a day for signing in    each question costs 5 points, so ask sparingly    :o)     http://answers.yahoo.co m/info/scoring_system;_ylt=Aplad92Pq_Flp...|`|Khzi78ciaa	Well to get level 2 you should have 250 points.

7u77AiBjaa	You can EMBED or LINK TO a video in your 360 blog.    Embedding takes additional steps because of a site-wide glitch involving flash-based objects in the blog (i.e. videos, photo slideshows, music players, and various other widgets). This problem started in September 2008. On some old entries, clicking the "Comment" link or going the entry's "Permanent Link" will allow you to see some objects. So, the instructions here: http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/360/blo... , no longer work as stated. Also, Javascript does not work in Yahoo! 360.    Fortunately, some 360 users have come up with a few ways for you to embed videos outside of the normal help instructions:    1) A simple deletion of parts of the YouTube video embed code works. See http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-4D4zxsg6f... for details.    2) See http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-4D4zxsg6f... and http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-4D4zxsg6f... for details on how to convert code for YouTube and Google videos using MY360MI conversion tools. They recently added a tool for Yahoo! Video as well.    3) Create an account on myYearbook.com (http://myYearbook.com ), go to the video section of the site (also located in the bottom center of your profile page), search for the video (or upload the code for one), and use the converted embed code from that site in the "View HTML Source" version of your 360 blog entry. See http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-4D4zxsg6f... for details.      NOTE: The Y!360 team is no longer addressing bug reports, as it prepares to migrate parts of 360 to a universal profile system (UPS). This transition was announced in October 2007 and the UPS actually started in a rudimentary beta form on October 16, 2008. The Y!360 part of the system hasn't been transferred over fully yet.   - See blogs at http://blog.360.yahoo.com/product_360 for more details. The 360 team blog is also accessible via the "Yahoo! 360 News" link in the upper right corner of your 360 space. You can post complaints on their blog, but don't expect a personal response.   - See http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-4D4zxsg6f... for more information on 360 glitches.  - See the links in these blog entries for more details on Yahoo's overall direction and UPS: http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-4D4zxsg6f... , http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-4D4zxsg6f... , and http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-4D4zxsg6f... .|`|645f18865ac05bd21df6fca545da961daa	Yahoo!

iOhhFiCJaa	Same problem here, plus very slow loading at first plus seveeral instances of Error 5.  Wonder if Yaho being sold has anything to do with it.
9VaWal2Daa	Okay first of all, The Dude, is wrong.   Violations CAN be appealed, and yahoo has answered EVERY Last appeal form I have filled out, often favorably.  If you are being targeted by trolls,  Yahoo can see that, and usually restores your deleted answer or question, IFFFFFF there was NOTHING wrong with it.   Like Dude said.......some people hit "report" merely because they disagree with you, or you made them look like a chump or something, which is not hard to do on Politics.  I agree with him there too.   Republicans have no skin in general.  They sure know how to dish it out, but my GOD, they sure can't take it.     R&S also gets feisty.....and I'm told that the PETS category, is actually quite VICIOUS-      I have NO IDEA, what that's all about .....never go there,  but alot of people say that.     As for points subtracted......you might have gotten a violation, but you also lose points for asking questions.  If you got a  violation, you should have gotten an email as well, telling you why.     If you think the reason was bogus.....appeal, and explain yourself CALMLY and intelligently......and they WILL review it.     I get them overturned on a regular basis .   It actually builds UP my credit, when I get them overturned, because I am reporting ACCURATELY, not falsely , like they are.     It's all in the guidelines which many people here never seem to have read.     False reporting damages the reporter, not the person they are trying to report.|`|9BL6LFJ9aa	I just looked at your questions, They are almost all chatting in Yahoos terms.

So some questions may not post for hours  or may get violated by staff. Delayed questions will be off the front page, so get very few answers.    If you are posting questions with links in them, this can delay the question posting or even cause it to not post. To get around this, post the question without the link first, then return to the question and use the PENCIL under it to put the link in the additional details section.

Click options (top right) on your mail page>mail options>pop and forwarding>  Set up or edit pop & forwarding>type in the address you want to forward to and  click save.   * Incoming mail server (POP3): pop.mail.yahoo.co.uk    Use SSL, port: 995   * Outgoing mail server (SMTP): smpt.mail.yahoo.co.uk    Use SSL, port: 465.    Note: In order to be able to send emails from outlook and others through/to yahoo (pop3) you need to pay for a yahoo mail plus account. @ 11.99 per year.|`|X4O7W1Vvaa	That happens when your main network connection has been locked out or died.
AA11223636	You need to provide a lot more information than that, if you want a real answer.|`|9BL6LFJ9aa	Yahoo is still having some problems at the moment. Suggested cures range from Update Adobe Flash Player and Java script to clear IE7 cache, cookies, and browsing history. Different things seem to work for different people. It's causing attachments to not show, 999 errors where it won't let you do a particular action and some people cannot send receive delete or move mail. It's not just Vista either it's happening to some of us on XP. If all else fails go back to classic mail via this link.  http://us.mg1.mail.yahoo.com/dc/optout?s... click yes when asked do you want to opt out. Hope this helps.

Without the correct verification information,You will not be able to obtain a new password. If there were a easy fix it would be open to abuse from hackers...Sorry.|`|QU37MZi7aa	once you had forgotten the password and cannot provide the full info of that account, then you won't be able to retrieve it anymore. your only option is to use third programs to crack the password of that account and this can only be possible if the PW of that account is very weak. there are plenty of program crackers on the net for free, though not safe to use also.

fv2GAAdPaa	As the first answer said put it in the family section, you will get good responses.    =]|`|gIszhbQNaa	The Family section, under the Family & Relationship category, would be a perfect choice.|`|2f739e8b2a5530e501bad3e76a9cb2f7aa	Using your gas, without paying for it, is taking something from you. Would you expect them to take your clothes and not return them? Or go into your garden and remove your crops without paying for them? While your parents offer is EXTREMELY generous, I can see why your friends would be uncomfortable about accepting it. I would be. I might use the gas -- but I would insist on paying for it.    Oh, and Family & Relationships under Friends would be good, or even psychology.

aee448de98ace1d5f73cd00e3967350caa	They are testing a new layout of the homepage by putting a cookie on your system that automatically redirects you.     If you want to keep the old layout, you need to block cookies from yahoo.com. In Internet Explorer 7, click Tools, Internet Options, Privacy tab, Sites. In the address of website box, type yahoo.com then click Block. You can unblock it later by clicking the remove button. The only problem with this is that you cannot log into any yahoo services(like yahoo answers) when the cookies are blocked. Also, look for the Feedback link at the bottom of the page and tell yahoo that you don't like the new layout and you don't want to have to use this workaround.
AA11307940	Right now it's another Yahoo glitch, until they get it fixed you should put them in folders for safe keeping. This is happening to many others at this time. Yahoo is aware of it and has no explanation or answer as how to fix it.
