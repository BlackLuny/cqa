Ok so, every time I turn on the tv or read a newspaper all I see the economic crisis repeated over and over and I just don't get it. I mean who invented the money the first place? Well the humans did right? So then why can't the governments just print more money and get the economy back on track? For me this all seems so silly and I wonder why are we humans this silly? Also, the same can be done for the countries that struggle like underdevelped countries. The governments of those countries could create more money. That way there's no need for donations and charities. Because of money, some people have to live without food and proper shelter or none at all. What have we humans become? Please note that this is all just my opinion and I am not angry at anybody. So I would appreciate if you could give your view on this invention of money issue and why there's need for such issue?   Thanks in advance!

20090219171414AAbL3kP	Social Science;Psychology	Is it possible for your personality to change?	I personally do not think it's possible for your personality to change. I don't mean you stay the same throughout your whole life; What I mean to say is that the basics of your personality are the same. For an example, if you were a mischievous trouble-maker when you were younger, you are probably still fun loving and spontaneous now. It's just more subdued. Or if you used to be very quiet and now you're more talkative, that's not exactly a change in personality. It's a change in how you express yourself. You're allowed to have your own opinions, by the way. Feel free to try to change my mind with the answer to my question of whether or not it's possible for your personality to change!

I feel like bad things follow me around.There has been many instances that I have almost died or someone else has.two fires- both which I was in the house during,and one of which burnt down my house. I had and instance where I had to jump out of a car while rolling downhill into the road-and I would have died if I didnt jump out.I almost was shot at.I also have daily choking instances.   Also I have family issues. An abusive brother who has once choked me so hard I fainted and then threw up, and a mentally unstable mom who has an addiction to facebook- and now she saw my father write he was in a 'dark place' at the moment and she took it as some huge insult and now they are probably getting a divorce b/c my dad said he doesnt know how long he could deal with her.My mom seriously has a mental disorder- she stands there and sways her head,lifts her eyebrows up and down,and mumbles to herself,and also has some odd beliefs.My family is so frustrating.   And with the kid my age I feel like such an outcast- Im more mature and see past there drama and pressures, but I feel really lonely.All the friends I used to be really close to have just drifted away.Ive also had some bad experiences brought on by friends, and now I have trust issues and have gotten shyer.I feel like Im now unable to make friends b/c Im not necessarily weird but Im not normal either.Its like the normal kids I used to be friends with called me weird and the weird friends I hung out with called me too normal.I also hate the kids at my school- they seem so foolish   And in school my grades are slipping and this is the first year Ive been this disorganized and also the first year that in some classes I cant even find myself to focus.Ive been extremely tired even though I get enough sleep.I also have been skipping breakfast and lunch mostly b/c I dont have time to eat breakfast in the mornings and I just dont like lunch food.I have been wasting a lot of time. I used to be eager to do things and now I dont feel like doing the most simple things.   I dont know how I got this way- I mean Im smart, I have talents,Im also attractive.I just dont know how to keep strong anymore my life just feels like its falling to pieces and dont even make me mention financial problems- being middle class in a snobby rich neighborhood isnt easy.

20090219181136AAVwPIz	Social Science;Sociology	How to deal with a friend who constantly criticizes me?	I have a new friend on my study abroad trip (we're both americans) who likes hanging out with me and keeps asking to do things with me, but he always criticizes me. For example, I showed him some of my favorite songs by a danish band. He listens to it for 4 seconds and is like, "I don't like it. It's too conventional."       We're cooking together. I don't have a lot of cooking experience but I do have some. He was making me nervous because I was afraid I'd make a mistake and then be criticized. So i wasn't performing at my top level. He's like, "I can see why you always do microwave meals."      Also while we were cooking, I said I wish I'd brought my camera so that we could document the moment. He's like, "why would you want to take pictures of food? Bored people do that." I replied sarcastically thanking him for calling me bored, and he said "you ARE bored. Taking pictures of food." (he went on but I'll spare the rest of it).       Then when we were shopping and I wanted to buy one of my favorite fruit smoothie drinks, he said that was an extravagance and that the drinks were trash (they're 100% fruit by the way). He also kept criticizing me for eating microwave meals.       He said to me in an accusing tone, "You should have taken a Danish language course LAST semester." (This is my second semester here and his first). I didn't have enough information to take such a course last semester. I didn't know which courses were available and didn't know I would be returning for a second semester, etc. The only reason he's taking one is because I told him about it.       When I was waiting to cross a busy street, he ran across. When I finally crossed, he said, "you got to just RUN. You have to learn how to navigate in a big city." I've been navigating this city for a whole semester before he came!      I have helped him to get adjusted here in so many ways, and yet all he does is criticize me. Everything I do is wrong, "conventional" and just not right. He also complains to me about how dissatisfied he is with his experience abroad.       I don't understand why he keeps wanting to spend time with me yet I can't share anything that I like with him because he's bound to say something critical about it. it's a pity because despite that, we have connected and it's easy to talk to him. That constant criticism is what's making it so hard to enjoy being his friend. I know he's had major issues earlier in his life (involving therapists, dysfunctional family, etc) and I sympathize, but it's really starting to take a toll on me.      How should I deal with this? Should I confront him straight up about it? Or should I just ignore the criticism and play deaf?

20090219175821AAUxd7a	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	Feminists, why, for the most part, do you claim to strive for equality,?	yet only want equality where it benefits your particular needs the most, without considering the wants and desires of other women?      I thought the feminist movement was supposed to be about equal opportunity for all women. Today, I read an answer along these lines. Now, I'm not quoting verbatim, because I can't remember exactly where I saw this, but just give me the benefit of the doubt that I speak the truth.      A woman said that women should strive to be more than housewives, implying that a woman could not possibly want to be a housewife and that such a job is beneath women. It seems to be a common theory, not just this user's beliefs only but also among the majority of feminists I've encountered.      Now, if feminism is truly about equal opportunity (and not a sexist attempt at placing women on a pedistool, as is my theory), then why would statements like this be made by a feminist? Surely if you truly desire equal opportunities, you would not look down upon women who actually want to perform menial tasks and fit the description of a 1950's subservient woman.      I asked this question yesterday, but I'd like to hear more opinions on the matter. So if you already answered, you don't have to again.

20090219184608AAC7oTA	Social Science;Psychology	How do I stop being angry at her?	I seem to always go through stages with my one friend.  It usually starts with her yakking.  She tells everyone EVERY inane detail of her life.  I'm around her a lot, so I hear the same stories all day and for days at a time, until she's told everyone everything.  It drives me crazy.  If I don't have interesting things to say, I try not to bore people with meaningless details.  Then, when I do have something important to talk about, (like today) I get cut off, so she can tell someone else one of her stories...again.  I've never said anything, but she has noticed my behavior has changed lately, thinking she knows why, but is wrong.  Would you want to hear a play-by-play of someones trip to the tanning salon everyday?!
20090219180128AAZVOrY	Social Science;Psychology	Depression is destroying my life.?	Were to begin?   I was basically locked in my room until Kindergarten.   I was abused and neglected as a child.   I was Raped in gradeschool.    I had no friends, and was always beaten up by my peers as a youth.   Most of my Middleschool experience was sitting with my head on my desk being horridly depressed.   I've contemplated Suicide seriously since 4th grade.   I fell in love in highschool with the one person who cared about me.   They Died...   I failed most of my classes because I was so depressed I couldn't do the work.    I tried to hang myself, and failed.   All I can think about when I go to bed is ways to kill myself, wich keeps me up all night.   I have no money. I'm going through my final years of Highschool,   I'm probably never make it in Collage.   Now the only friend I have (A washed up druggie...) is leaving.      I can barley move my depression is killing me.     Everyone I know is totally oblivious.   I just want to leave... But I can't. ...
20090219180139AAft0yu	Social Science;Psychology	Do I Dissociate my Identity?	I don't have DID.      I don't have the amnesia of DID, I remember all the details of my life.      My problem is I think I'm internally someone else.  It started when I was young, around 5 or 6, and I started to 'like' certain things.  I used to like certain characters out of movies or storybooks or games-whatever kids liked and I used to take their personalities with me to school. In 2nd grade I remember filling in my name as 'Tommy' from the rugrats, and getting reprimanded for it.      It evolved into what I have now.        Now it's much more serious.  I know I'm Emily but I don't want to be Emily.  I secretly pretend I'm an actor I'm in love with.  His name is Valentino, he loves to gamble, loves the 'Vegas' life.  I change my personality when I think of him.  I become more outgoing and clever, more charming and funny.  Of course I'm still Emily, but I'm Val as well.      I live out this fantasy online.  In the chatrooms I'm a part of I can actually be Val.  I spend a huge hunk of my life online because of it.  It saddens me.  I can aspire to be anything I want except the life-loving, cigar-smoking gambling 30 yr old man I really wish I was.        I guess it was just the imaginary friend thing gone wrong.  Sometimes I pretend I'm in Val's company and he's my lover.  Around people, we tend to 'fuse' together and become a self.  This sounds weird, I know.      Around the age this started, I wasn't Miss Popularity and I was abused at home by the mom.  She dressed me funny.  Kids treated me funny as a result of it.  Actually they treated me horrible.  But I'm not getting into that, it's not important.      Little by little, I'm noticing Val or whoever is my 'lover' this year, is taking the credit for my little personal glories throughout the day.  Val is the athlete.  Val is the charming one.  Emily is the lazy, shy one.  Val's awesome.  Emily's not.  And worse, I use Val as a shield sometimes, and when he screws up or makes an *** of himself, I feel hopeless.        And I couldnt even begin to start a relationship.  I cant decide to be Val or Emily.  Val would be the charming wit master every man should be.  Emily would just be Emily.  Of course, I am a straight female, and a straight female acting bold and boisterous like a male wouldnt blow over well with other males. I don't like Emily.  Even though she's pretty and nice and generally cool, she still sickens me.  I've always disliked myself.        Do I have a form of DID?      Thank you.

20090219183341AAjz3oD	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	Shouldn't I have the right to remove my father's name from my name?	I'm a Brazilian woman living in the US for 2 decades, as an American citizen I was able to change my name as I pleased and thus removed my absent father's last name at the first chance I got.  However, I recently found out that I had no right to remove his name in the eyes of the Brazilian law, it seems a woman in Brazil has only two options,  keep her paternal name forever, or she may remove it , and this is a one shot deal, upon marriage when she must then adopt her husband's name.   Isn't this insane?      I now have two different names and I'm fighting in court in Brazil to rectify that.      Any thoughts?

20090220174512AAtm2Tv	Social Science;Other - Social Science	For anyone who likes to read about dreams?	I had this creepyass dream. It was weird. It was like I was looking down upon what happened after I died. Half of the time, it was like I was floating and looking down at the scene. The other half of the time, I was there, but no one saw me. Like I tried to reach out and touch my mom, and I went right through her. Anyway... The first thing I saw was like this news broadcast. There was this brunette newscaster woman and I think it was sort of a lucid dream, because I remember thinking "what the hell am I doing?" And I was floating. I remember it perfectly. It started out like talking about a girl who killed herself and I was thinking "wow... how sad" then she said my name and this is the part I remember perfectly. She said something like this: 'Ali, just thirteen years old, was found dead hanging in her closet after she reportedly hung herself, taking 20+ pills. Her family and friends said she was happy, she got good grades (this part isn't right, I'm currently failing all of my classes) had lots of friends, and seemed pretty healthy. But when they found deep cuts on her upper leg...' then she trailed off. There was purple mist and I was at school. I saw all of my friends, sitting around talking about it. Bre started crying so I went over and I was like "I'm okay!" but she kept crying and no one could see me or hear me, same with everyone else. Then Patric and Chris started fighting and it faded out again... And I was at the school cafeteria and these preppy girls that I hate were talking about it, too. They were laughing and Shelby (head b****) was like "yeah, she scared me, I'm glad she's gone!" and it faded out again. It was the news broadcast again and it was the same woman and she was talking about how I always wore black, so people started blaming it on emo and then she was like "but when they spoke with friends and family, they all said she called emo bullshit, and denied being emo, instead claiming to be goth." then my friend Emma was on there explaining how I had always called emo gay, lame, conforming bullshit saying it was the new preppy (which IS what I say)   and once again, it faded, I thought I was about to wake up but then I saw my mom in our living room crying and I tried to comfort her but it was like I wasn't there... and then I woke up.       If you bothered to actually read any of that, my dreams aren't usually like that. They're usually not that clear, and they're usually pretty scattered and silly. What do you think this could mean? I'll admit, I am a little obsessed with death, and I do cut (I'm trying to stop) I know it sounds obvious, but what does this dream mean? Like I said, this dream was not only disturbing, but special since I NEVER dream like that. What does it mean? I shouldn't kill myself? The preps would be happy if I died? My friends love me? I knew all that.... WTF?!
20090220221018AAAJ4Cv	Social Science;Economics	Do you really believe this is the worst economy since the Great Depression?	I travel about 50% of the time for work. Today, I was in Jacksonville, FL. My team decided to drop into Applebee's for lunch. I had a hard time finding a parking spot, The place was PACKED! These were middle class people not looking to score on the McDonald's $1 menu to save money.      Also, the 4 planes I was on this week were all full as were all of the bars and restaurants in the airports. Before I left, I was at Wal Mart and it too was PACKED with long lines.      I understand that people are loosing their jobs and some industries are having problems but honestly, many Americans over extended themselves with credit cards and mortgages they couldn't afford. I know I had a bunch of maxed out credit cards that have since been paid off and I just don't take advantage of bad credit card offers anymore.       I guess my question is do you believe the economic "catastrophe" that the president is pitching if we don't spend trillions of dollars that we'll need to borrow or are most people just regrouping and being smarter about what they spend on? Less spending on $5 coffees will hurt some baristas but.....that's the market.
20090220224624AAfoFh8	Social Science;Economics	How does rebuilding roads and infrastructure help stimulate the economy or  create worth while jobs?	I'm serious about this.  I just don't see how better roads will help.  It's not as is if they were a notable cause for the recession in the first place.

20090220224729AAEk6Z0	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	Sex dream about my best friend (whos a guy)?	I keep having these sex dreams about this guy who's my bff. We used to go out, but then we broke up. and we were never having sex or even making out when we were together. and the sex in the dream feels really good, not like the empty sex you feel in some dreams.      what does this mean? cause i don't love him anymore, but we're still really good friends. and i need to know if i should tell him, because he's against sex in any form (he thinks its gross and he says that he'lll never have it) and if i tell him he'll think im a perv and wont be friends with me anymore.      help? plz?
20090220224733AARM2kR	Social Science;Psychology	I feel so depressed and I don't even know why.?	I feel so ungrateful and  just... wrong.   I can't even explain it.    I have a nice roof over my head, I live very fortunate wealth when lots of people are starving, my parents are happy never fight, living together happily for about 30 years, my siblings are perfect, gone to perfect colleges and all I see around me is stability and peace. There is no chaos. But I feel so empty, I can't even explain it.
20090220225400AAqijQu	Social Science;Psychology	Why so much sadness and...?	today I just got so depressed about life. I actually broke down at work.

20090220225914AA4WQ6c	Social Science;Psychology	What is better? Big picture, or detail by detail thinking?	This is a bit of an issue, as people seem to be either one or the other. I'm a big picture guy.      in favor of big picture thinking:   it gives the reason, purpose, which reinforce why a task is done   can lead to deriving of details where they may not be known      in favor of detailed thinking:   helps with accuracy. Big picture people can loose accuracy since they don't pay attention to details.   helps with large systems and names      well?
20090220225816AAdXQCs	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	I had a dream involving stillbirth?	I'm currently a student in college, I don't have a boyfriend, I've never been pregnant but last night, I had a dream that I had a baby and I was very very happy, but then the doctors told me that the baby was a stillbirth, so the dream ended with me holding my child in my arms, knowing that it died.      What could this mean? All I can relate is that I really like children and would love to have a big family... but I mean, I'm still in school and I don't have plans to get married anytime soon.      Any ideas?
20090220230256AAEBrNX	Social Science;Psychology	Is this something to think or I am over thinking?	At my workplace there is a girl who works with me in my team. I proposed her 8-9 months back and she said NO. I am fine with this and we are still friends and we work together. We respect each other and we have nothing else in our minds except friendship. But after that, I have developed obsessive thinking about everything related with her. I analyze each and every single thing which happened between us like speaking, writing, working, walking etc. For example: Yesterday she finished her work and was going back to home. When she passed by my side I said to her "see you, have a nice weekend" and then she went. I am thinking since yesterday whether I have done correct or not since she was just passing by and I said to her goodbye. She probably had no intention to say goodbye to me. I am also thinking that what will she think of what I have done because she hasn't said anything to me and I said goodbye to her in the first place.   Am I thinking too much about saying goodbye to her (and this is nothing to think of) or this is really something to think about? If I am thinking too much, please tell me how to get rid of my over-thinking habit. Thanks.
20090221003539AA2HibL	Social Science;Psychology	How can I feel comfortable having sex again?	I am 20 years old and have been with my boyfriend for the past year and a half.       Before I met him I had a very unhealthy sex life. I used drugs and was locked in a turbulent 3 year relationship. I cheated on my ex with his best friend at the time for the last 4 months of the relationship. He would emotionally abuse me as well as physically abuse me when we would get really drunk and high (which was every single day we spent together).       When I was 15, right before I got together with my ex, a close friend raped me. Up until recently, I always thought it was my fault and never really dealt with it.       I met my current boyfriend through my ex's best friend (they are both musicians) and have since left that life-style and all of the people in it behind. I have not drank alcohol or touch any substances for 1 year and six months and am happy to say that I will never again need to use in my life.      I feel like I found my soul mate concerning my current boyfriend. I do not feel tied down by him at all, he makes me feel like I can accomplish anything I set my mind to, and he supports me like no other.       For the first year or so, our sex life was better than it has ever been in my entire life. I had never connected with someone so deeply on an emotional level.      For the last 5 or 6 months, I have been having real problems having sex. Every time he comes onto me, I start to panic, and at first he thought he was doing something wrong. It made him feel rejected.      He now realizes that there's a problem going on. We do have sex, about 2-4 times a week, however before we do I go through this ritual of rejecting him and saying I don't want to do anything. Every time he says he wants to touch me, or says something sexual to me, I can't help but get nervous and say something to the effect of "ew, no." It is so predictable to the point where I don't have to say anything after he does somethingl, he'll literally reject himself saying "i know...you don't want to."      It isn't putting a wedge between our relationship just yet because we are a strong couple and plan to marry each other, but it is so frustrating for the both of us.       Unfortunately, I don't have the insurance coverage nor the extra cash to see a therapist about this just yet...      Does any one have any suggestions on how I can over come this fear of intimacy or something to help us overcome this together?      Thank you in advance

20090221003628AAtqpVd	Social Science;Psychology	Is there such thing as a mental illness where you think people have done things to you they haven't even done?	Basically, all my life my mother has told us others have done/said bad things and don't want to know her or us.  Now, as adults we have found this all to be untrue, and have got in touch with the relatives themselves, and found they did no such thing.      These days, my mother constantly says these kinds of things about me and my sister, to each other and to others.  We have apparently said and done hurtful and cruel things to her on a consistent basis.  None of these things are even close to what the actual thing done and said really was.      My question is, is there a mental illness where it is possible to really believe we did say and do those things?  Or is she knowingly making up these lies deliberately to slander us?  If I can answer this question I will be able to seek the right help.      Please no silly or unhelpful answers.

So, this guy asked if we could be a couple, I told him no because I didn't want to be in a relationship and just wanted to be friends. Last weekend, we went to the movies, as friends (we both payed for our own tickets) and he gave me this teddy bear, I didn't want to be rude so I took it and said thank you. While we were waiting outside it was freezing, and he put his arm around me and kinda cuddled up to me. I didn't stop him because I was cold and it was keeping me warm. Yesterday he asked again if we could be a couple and I gave him the same answer. Now he's angry with me, saying I was leading him on.      I don't understand how though, I told him I didn't want to be with him.
20090221010630AApRbHI	Social Science;Psychology	How can I stop caring about what other people think of me?	I am that typical yes guy who doesn't like to offend or upset people. I always worry about what people think of me and think they are judging me or that they dislike me and it gives me this really hollow empty feeling. I feel totally paranoid sometimes, so much so I can't even speak and I get really nervous about saying the right things so often I just avoid people totally just so I don't have to go through the pain. I am constantly thinking people are judging me even when it is just having a conversation. I dread going into work because I find it hard to interact with people. To compensate I get really drunk at the weekend just to forget my worries and then end up getting depression on top of it all because of the after effect of alcohol, on monday mornings I feel so crappy I don't even speak to anyone unless I have to. I am pretty messed up yeah! Anyone got any tips of getting out of this mental mess?

20090221003358AA5CepU	Social Science;Psychology	When love and hate collide.....?	Like is it possible to love someone and hate them at the same time? I mean I love my sons father. But he hurt me really bad, he moved in with another woman while I was pregnant, he played so many mind games with me. He has been tellin me he loves me and wants me back but it will be a while before he moves out of his girlfriends house. So I asked him last night who is heart really belonged to and he told me he couldnt answer that. Obviously it doesnt really belong to me, it belongs to her. Our son is 2 months old now and he took our son for the first time last night cuz I had to work and he was gonna babysit, and soon as we parted ways he bacame a complete d*ck to me and wouldnt even tell me how he was doing when I asked. Like I am so tired of his games and being hurt, but I love him, and not only becuz he is my sons father, there are other reasons too. But I told him today that I was done, that he needed to stay with his other family (she has 2 kids that arent his, but none by him). I'm just so hurt. What do I do? I am really almost to that point where I litterally get sick to my stomach when I even think about him or see him. I have to deal with him for the next 18 years, but I almost want to hate him. How do I deal with this?
20090220230342AAeJvwP	Social Science;Sociology	I have a few questions on the science of attraction?(between people)?	now from what I know to opposites attract each other....so when you give off you pheromone, and when you smell another persons pheromone...depending if you find the "scent" in that pheromone is different from yours you will be attracted to that person.Am i right. well I'm thinking that person has got to be attracted to you  if you find their scent(pheromone) opposite of yours.then theirs should be opposite of yours. right?........i hope this question is not confusing..here's another way to look at it (simplified)      your pheromone is +   theirs is -   so    +-=connection   so that must mean   -+=connection

20090220232455AAMb3wf	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	I've been having STRANGE dreams! Can someone please give me an interpretation?	A week ago, I had a dream that I was walking at night by myself...in the old street where I used to live. However, I stopped by this house and saw the moon was inside!!       Why would I dream of a moon being inside a house? In addition, the sky was really HIGH UP....usually the clouds make the sky seem lower. But in my dream, the sky was way up high.       WHAT DOES MY DREAM MEAN?

20090221004416AAcZ2gO	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	Detailed nightmare/dream needs interpreting!?	I had a dream about a week ago.  It first began in the house that I am currently living in.  I noticed that in the bathroom and the toilet, along the bottom of the tiled walls there were random holes throughout.  It looked as though someone had just kicked holes in the walls, but for some reason it look as though natural light was shining through even though the holes did not go through to outside.  They were only holes into other rooms, so this didn't make much sense.        Due to this damage we had to stay elsewhere while repairs were being done, which again doesn't make sense because we have another bathroom but I didn't think of this in the dream.  I owned another house which happened to be a mansion, which again is odd considering we only thought of this mansion as a "weekend" house rather than our regular house. I remember talking to my mum in my dream and she was offering for my partner and I to stay with them while repairs were being done, as I was quite upset about having to stay in this overwhelmingly big mansion.  Nevertheless I said no thank you, as the repairs would only take a week or so but I was still quite nervous about having to stay there.      I then remember hearing bulls and cows outside making a lot of noise.  I opened the back door to see that the mansion was on a acreage.  There was a paddock blocked off but the animals outside were going crazy and running around making alot of noise.  My dog quickly ran past my legs to outside, and I started to get upset as I thought he would get trampled by one of these bulls but luckily he soon came inside and was okay.  Off in the distance I could see a old farm house, and I thought to myself gee that place looks spooky.      At some point I went out the front of the house, I think to collect the mail.  It was daylight but the road leading up to the house was made of dirt, and it was lined with big pine trees which made the area look a bit darker.  I heard a car coming up the road and looked up.  It was a sedan and there was a male sitting in it.  As he drove past he turned his head to look at me, he then smiled as his eyes turned red and continued to drive.  I thought to myself at this point he must be a demon.       I went back inside to soon be interupted by some old farmer from the spooky house who just waltzed in our back door with a shotgun.  I didn't feel threatened by him, but then he came up to me holding a white towel with 5 red spots on it.  He then said I held this over them when I shot them in the head.  For some reason I knew that it was people that he had shot and the five red spots meant 5 people were dead, (which again doesn't make sense as guns tend to blow holes into things but I guess it is a dream so the laws of reality don't apply). At this point I woke up.      Anyone with any ideas about what this dream means please put it forward as I am open to any suggestions! :)
20090220231651AAXf86l	Social Science;Psychology	Is it depression, or am I just a psycho?	My whole life, I've been in bad circumstances. Maybe not horrible or anything but unsavory most of the time. Now I'm 26, and for the first time in my life, I don't have ANYTHING to be sad about. I have a great relationship, a beautiful child, finances are not eating me alive, our home is wonderful, I have NOTHING to be upset about.       Yet, time and again I find something wrong. This hurts, that hurts, this sucks, that sucks, I get angry and pick fights. I hate it. I try so hard to be thankful and happy, but all my old baggage or attitude crops up and ruins our days time and again.      Does ANYONE have this problem? It's screwing up everything on a daily basis for me and I'm starting to get desperate.

20090221012450AA2QsJp	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	Need help figuring out my dream..?	I had a dream last night, where I was "infected" by a virus, similar to the "zombie" ones you see in movies, and everyone else who was infected by it did become a zombie, but a few people including me got infected yet became animals. like... werewolves! in a way. We didnt know, we just would ..convert..?   And later in my dream I was trying to escape and ended up in an airport where I couldnt board my flight, even after this lady helped me out some way. From the airport I ended up in a market, my vision became blurred my feelings I could feel in real life where overwhelming and where in a way choking me and suffocating me even as I was dreaming, and then I lost my vision in my dream and lost all senses as if I had blacked out.   As soon as I regained conciousness and opened my eyes, my vision still blurred I was laying on the floor of a market, in an aisle, and all I remember was "I made a mess of the Gel section", haha, but the weirdest thing was that, I "Knew" I had become a lion and I could in a way Roar and become it whenever I wanted to but I couldnt see myself when I was doing it or have control, and EVERYONE mostly the people who had also become animals, where following me, and I was their "leader".    After that all I know was that cops where after me, and I couldnt get on my plane because the guy at the counter didnt like me!      Ah! its stressin me out I really want atleast a little clue or something on what that dream meant its like.. burned into my brain, and I cant shake that feeling I had when I had became a lion as funny as it may sound.   Ever since that dream I feel like powerful and unstoppable and this like...weird feeling I cant get rid of!      Please help me out!!

I ask this as many men with older children marry young girls in second marriages, often with the mother being younger than her step child.
