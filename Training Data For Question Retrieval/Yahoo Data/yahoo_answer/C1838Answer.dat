CjtfNi5aaa	If you want a good free 3d program then BLENDER is what you're looking for. I've been using it for years, and it's surprised me many times with what it's capable of doing.<br>  <br>  Blender is a modelling, animating and rendering program. You can customize your windows and it has many hotkeys that will save you plenty of work time once you get used to it. The armature system is great too. It also has a game engine with which you can make your own games.<br>  <br>  I'm not sure how long a "good" render would take on your machine. It always depends on how many lights and polygons are involved, and whether you use YafRay or Blender's internal renderer. You should also consider getting a graphics card. It won't help with the rendering (I don't think), but it will speed up your 3D interface like nobody's business.<br>  <br>  On the website you'll find many beginner, intermediate and advanced tutorials that will help you get on your way quickly.<br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.blender.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.blender.org</a>

nHSZ0Spbaa	OK, but what is that?  Give us a clue.|`|dILqe7nBaa	what is your question or your problem|`|qb9V9syNaa	your question makes absolutely no sense!!  I cant help if I cant understand what you are asking for.
XmnVJxzaaa	Okay, I'm not sure what you are asking, so I will give a few possible answers (the most sensible ones) to your question.  - Yes, you can add a hard drive to your HP Pavillion A6620F.  - The type of hard drive you would buy would be a SATA/300 type hard drive. Any reputable store, online or in your neighbourhood, would know what those numbers mean and point you in the right direction. You can buy any capacity hard drive (200 GB, 1.5 TB) and it will work with your system.  - If you are asking how it is done, I put a link in sources to a YouTube video showing how to add a hard drive to a system*. Luckily, the video even uses an HP computer, meaning the steps may be exactly as they are in your system.  - If your asking steps to take to swap one hard drive for another: 1: Back up all your data. 2) Shut down your system and physically install the new hard drive. 3) Turn your system on and use Windows Disk Management** to format and partition the drive. DO NOT ASSIGN A DRIVE LETTER. 4) Install drive copying software (Acronis True Image or Norton Ghost) on your main hard drive. 5) Follow the instructions that come with the software to COPY DRIVE (which makes an exact copy of the first hard drive on the new hard drive). When you are asked by the disk copying software to assign a drive letter, DO NOT ASSIGN A DRIVE LETTER. 6) Once the drive copying software has finished, shut down your system and remove the old hard drive. 7) When you restart your system, all should be well. Your old data and all your settings from your old hard drive should be on the new hard drive. If anything is missing, reinstall it from the back up you made.  I hope these may have answered your question. Add more details if I missed anything. Or, email me.  Good luck!
ba7d04794a2a889588ceecef53b5a40faa	Sorry, but a drive that suddenly is unrecognized by the system means it probably died. If you're using an internal drive as a back up, remember it runs just as much as your "C" drive so it's just as apt to fail. For secure backup of important files use an external that powers down when not in use. Or an online storage place.   There are computer places that can pull your files off a dead drive, but it's pricey.|`|8279d0a907ccc5fff04ebdb6ed176b32aa	sometimes they give up and if that has happened all may be lost i also have 4 hard drive and i save my important data on two different drives to protect myself from this happening|`|YVXuLLKVaa	it broke.  swap drives   make sure you let the bios recognize the change.  then reboot.  if your e: drive is unrecognized but f: drive is OK, swap E and F.

meqrA9ZZaa	Yes, it is plenty. And no, it will not dramatically change your computer. The processor is 'dated and the graphics chip is down the drain.    It really surprises me that you can even get Call of Duty 4 running on that, it can't be much of a pleasant experience.    As for slowness during normal desktop work, you have probably got a lot of unneeded processes running. Try going to Start -> run and type msconfig, swich to the tab "Startup". All of the items on that list each make your computer a bit slower, and chances are that you don't need any of them, tick 'em off and you should see some improvement.    As for game performance, you could get for instance a Radeon HD 4670 for approx. 100$, it would make an incredible difference.    Edit: About the noise, can't say for shure, but it could be fan related. Generally it is a good idea to vacuum clean a computer once in a while, open the case and you will find a ton of foreign stuff clogging fans and heatsinks.

If your hearing any clicks, chatter, or lazer gun sounds (think 80's sci-fi movies) then I'd back up your data and send in your hard drive for an RMA asap.  Other than your fans, and cd-rom drive, there are no other moving parts in your pc to make noise.    Everyone is also under the assumption that RAM makes the PC faster.  Yes it does help out a lot, but your still limited to how fast your hard drives can read data.  Upgrade to a WD raptor hard drive with a 10,000k RPM and you'll get much better results.|`|BhNP2P8Xaa	You'll see an improvement. Going from 512 mb to 2.5 GB is going to speed things up noticeably.    Play with that for a while, and later on you can get two more 1 GB sticks and make it a 4 GB machine.

I personally have 4 gigs that I upgraded to. but your processor has a lot to do with this also... how fast your processor can, well, process information is a huge part of how fast your computer is...    If you really want to see a difference you should get a better processor.    I think they are making quad core processors now.. those are super fast. expensive though...    I have a dual core, and it's ok! I also use windows Vista, which sucks up the ram... takes about a gig of ram just to run it.     anyway, hope this helps!|`|SEcM9EDZaa	A minimum of 512 RAM is needed for any version of XP to run well and even more if Media Center is involved (1 Gig Ram). If you plan to keep a fair amount of media files (photos, music, video, movies etc.) then more is better for both RAM and your hard drive.For extra storage of movie files or photos, a USB Storage drive (aka Flash or Thumb drive) is an excellent and inexpensive way to keep your HD level down. 512mb-2 gigs run from $30-$70.  A lot of minimal desktops are running only 256 and installing XP Home (smaller than Pro) . Previously they claimed 128 was enough and had tons of machines being returned for complaints of non-functionality so they upped it to 256).  Note: XP defrag operation won't finish if too much of the hard drive is used up (not free) so keep an eye on that. Good Luck!

LFWWPgpQaa	No it will not work, a modem will not create an internet connection and share it, that is what a router does.  You could use a computer as the gateway as the above poster mentioned but to do this you will need two network cards in the PC, one for the modem and one to connect to the network to share it.  That PC would need to be on for anyone else to access the internet and it is a pain to setup.    Modems need to be connected to a router to work, or you PC which can perform the routing part.    If you want all your machines to access the internet directly you need a router conencted to the switch, you can get a router than you plug your modem into or a router with a built in modem (built in is the easier to setup).|`|T7Apky52aa	Yes that should do the trick. If you're trying to share an internet connection you can either plug your internet in to the router and let it share it or dedicate one computer to be the gateway and then let the rest feed off that one.    It's probably easiest to just use the router as the gateway. That's what I do at work and I'm running an Apache web server internally that way without a problem.    Hope that helps!

4MYWPD9Yaa	Well, malware isn't designed to be easy to remove. In fact, the malware creators probably test it out with "antivirus" software first to make sure nothing can remove it completely.    You can try MalwareBytes. That seems to work for a bunch of people.    Really, though, the only way to be sure it's gone is to reinstall Windows.    Once you do that, get some real security.    Good security requires a multi-layered approach, and the least important layer by far is running some kind of anti-malware program (in fact, if you take care of all the other layers, you don't even need an anti-malware program using up extra resources).    In order of importance:    1. Create and use almost exclusively a limited user account instead of the default administrator account Windows sets you up with    2. Read up on social engineering and how to avoid it    3. Don't download illegal copies of software, music, or movies    4. Set Windows updates to install automatically    5. Make regular backups.

If the buffer is empty, read the next record.    Alternatively, you can try free format read, this will skip blank record to get to the next available number; but it is more computationally intensive (and Fortran is all about numerical efficiency)
AA11314954	The problem is that your class is managing pointers and you have not written a proper copy constructor function.  The default one from the compiler is doing the wrong thing.    Your function:  int operator>(const ObjectName left, const ObjectName right)  Is taking the parameters by value.  That means new objects are created on the stack for the function call and then destroyed.  It is the destruction of these temporary objects that is causing you problems.    These temporary objects are copy constructed from the originals.  That means the means the data members are simply copied.  If you are using pointers, this is bad.  Now you have two pointers to the same memory hence you get a double delete.    I'm assuming that ObjectName has a member something like  char * info;  and your destructor says  delete info;    You need to make a copy constructor.  Something like this:  ObjectName::ObjectName(ObjectName const & other)  {  ----info = new char[other.size];  ----strncpy(info, other.info, other.size);  // etc.  }    This way, when you pass by value the temporary objects are properly constructed and destroyed.    To avoid all the string copying, you can pass by reference.  By using a reference, no temporary object is created.    You would declare your comparison function as:  int operator>(const ObjectName & left, const ObjectName & right)    Now there is no temporary copy.    Also, operator > returns bool, not +- 1.  Return 'true' or non-zero if left > right.  Otherwise return 'false' or 0.    The comparison operators are different than strcmp.|`|pXzvu866aa	Are you sure the objects in your ObjectName array are being destroyed, or are you seeing execution of the destructors of temporary ObjectName objects created by operator> ?    Try changing the signature of operator> to this:    int operator>(const ObjectName &left, const ObjectName &right);

PQJyaFDXaa	You have one of the following problems:  1) Your hard drive has gone bad.  You need a new hard drive, and to reload your operating system from the original recovery CDs after it is replaced.  If you don't have recovery CDs, contact Gateway.    2) Your hard drive has gone glitchy, and you lost random data.  Unfortunately, the random data included parts of your operating system.  In that case, it would be safest to replace the hard drive as per  1 above, but you also have the option of reformatting and reusing the same drive for a while.  Reformatting should eliminate the bad sectors (for now), but it could happen again.    3) Someone deleted or corrupted your operating system.  This could be a malicious program, or just a little child playing with your computer.  I just had to recover the computer I'm typing from because my wife was letting my 2-year-old push the shiny power button on/off/on/off/on/off until my OS was corrupted.  In this case, you can reformat and reinstall with no worries about the state of the hard drive.    The underlying cause in all cases is that the computer appears to mount your hard drive, is having problems, and can't find enough of the operating system to work properly.    If you're still covered under Gateway support, you should call them.  They may pay for the hard drive if it's under warranty.  The recovery CDs may be free even if warranty has expired (not sure of Gateway's policy, but it's true for some manufacturers.)

d98d8bfb68b616f97b22344613a67cebaa	Movie maker has two audio tracks. The first is the audio from the imported video and the second is the background narration track that you can add.  You can only add a single audio track at a time with the imported audio from the captured video    An easy work around is to produce a video with your background music or narration added (In high resoultion on the PC).   Then start a new project and import this newly produced movie. The audio with your background music is then present in the video audio.      You can now add additional sounds or narration into the second Audio/music track.   This will allow you to precisely locate your sound effects in the movie.    You then produce the movie a second time and you will now have a second movie with multiple audio tracks mixed together. This second movie production can now be produced in a lower resolution for the media you expect to play it on.

If you've got hashes in Java, I'd look at using those as in Perl they're much more flexible than arrays.    Hope that helps!

However, in the near future a product from Microsoft called Silverlight will be released. (It's in Alpha now.)  Once this is available I would venture that this will become the best way to program an online game.  <br>  <br>  The features that Silverlight brings to the table will be substantial.  It can create a similar experience that Flash does now but with the added ability to integrate with the .Net Framework.  That means it can do what Flash does plus be integrated with languages such as C#, VB.Net and even your formentioned C++.  <br>  <br>  As for #2, I'm not sure where you could go specifically, I think it depends on what technology you want to use.  If you are thinking flash, go to some forums that flash developers hang out in, they will be able to point you in the right direction.  If you want silverlight or a .Net Solution www.asp.net, www.silverlight.com or Aspalliance.com (or other developer sites).

It's way to advanced for someone who doesn't understand programming or have never seen Perl. The Intermediate book and Advanced book are pretty good though. I also highly recommend the Perl Best Practices book (again O'Reilly) This book shows you the most accepted way to skin a cat (as in Perl there a zillion ways to do things, this book says which one is BEST). Also I have SAMS, How to teach yourself Perl in 21 day book. While impossible to do in 21 days, it's a great reference becuase it really breaks things down into easy to understand pieces. I would stay away from Perl By Example (Quigley). Also the best bet is to get all these books at once and get a Safari Online book subscrption. Link listed below:|`|MOLdVJWJaa	Oreilly has a very good book. More than that, there is tonnes of material including on perl including free online books/ebooks and examples. Just google for it.|`|pwkhyXtCaa	Oreilly's Camel book is good one for beginners and Cookbook if good one if you know basics of perl.<br>  and you can get some online documents in www.perl.org and www.perl.com.

58xNabrXaa	With a €700 budget you might be slightly hard-pressed to get everything you want but I’ve outlined a few necessities under different headings:<br>  <br>  PROCESSOR<br>  From time to time, you hear "Pentium III" and "Pentium IV" etc. This is the processor speed and “Centrino Dual-Core” is currently the fastest processor available. When investing in your computer, a dual core with a minimum of 2 GHz should be included.               <br>  <br>  MEMORY<br>  Random Access Memory: The more RAM, the faster your computer will perform. Windows XP requires a minimum of 256 MB RAM. To allow for future developments, a minimum of 1 GB should be included in the system.<br>  <br>  Hard Drive: The hard drive is a non-volatile form of memory where system, program, and data files are stored. It is measured in gigabytes (GB; 1 GB=1,000 megabytes). It may be a wise idea to sacrifice access speed for a larger memory. <br>  <br>  NETWORKING<br>  The majority of computers come with a built-in network interface card (NIC). One of these cards is necessary for connecting the computer to the Internet through Cable or DSL. Wireless connections may be available at your college. If the PC does not have built-in wireless networking, you will need to have installed a Wireless Networking Card. Many brands of wireless networking cards are compatible with the wireless network.<br>  <br>  PORTS<br>  It is essential that the amounts and types of ports in a PC be analysed before considering purchasing the system. <br>  Multiple USB ports will be an essential requirement for connecting printers and other essential devices. Most students find memory sticks invaluable and to use them, a USB port must be present. Of course, if interested in a desktop system, it would not be difficult to invest in a USB hub but in the case of a laptop, such devices can be a hindrance when used in limited space as they tend to dangle loosely on a lead.<br>  <br>  Firewire ports are widely used for downloading video from digital camcorders to the computer. Though perhaps not a necessity, they support high-speed transfers and can be useful if you do happen to make regular use of a digital camcorder.<br>  <br>  BATTERY<br>  Though a lengthy battery-life may initially seem very important, since you cannot exceed your €700 budget, the amount of memory which the system has takes priority. If there are various wireless-connection “hot-spot” areas in your college, a mains connection should also be available so a very long battery life may not be necessary.<br>  <br>  LAPTOP ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES<br>  Some people choose to purchase a laptop instead of a desktop PC. Advantages of a laptop computer include the fact that they are designed to be highly mobile and therefore are generally unaffected by space limitations. Unfortunately, this mobility is inadvertently one of the largest disadvantages presented by the laptop: in a large university, their compact size attracts thieves. Just so you know, laptops are available with an even larger variety of screen widths (10” to 20”)<br>  <br>  SOFTWARE<br>  Being in NUI Galway, it is most likely that along with the Windows XP/Vista operating system, you will have need of the following software:<br>  ·Microsoft Office (Powerpoint, Frontpage, Word etc.)<br>  ·Microsoft Visual Basic 2006<br>  ·Microsoft Internet Explorer<br>  ·Microsoft Outlook<br>  ·Windows Media Player<br>  <br>  A “Student Edition” of Microsoft Office is currently available for the price of €150<br>  <br>  Hope this helps! :)|`|2387e754731fab94417cc622af4a55a9aa	This notebook right here would be good:(if you want vista)<br>  <a href="http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=2968185&CatId=17" rel="nofollow">http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/...</a><br>  <br>  And heres a good xp notebook:<br>  <a href="http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=2913225&CatId=17" rel="nofollow">http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/...</a>|`|oBLQnkC2aa	make sure to get one with a large hard drive. good for your music and presentations and stuff. go with a cheaper model, like i did, ive got a gateway mx3230

07TvvktDaa	The best way for this is to have an initial idea first on why your computer runs very slow. Because you are familiar with the Task Manager, it's better to start from there. Open the task manager window. Select the "Processes" tab. You will be shown the list of all program processes running in your computer. Look at the "CPU" column. This column shows the percentage value that every running program process contributes to the overall CPU load (which you said was 98%). If you add all of the numbers together in this column, the total will equal 98%. Now look for the highest number in this column and click to highlight it (this is the process that uses the most CPU resource). Then look at its name in the leftmost column (which is an ".exe" file). The next thing is to identify which installed program this ".exe" file belongs to. You can do this in one of two ways. In the first way, you can google the internet by typing the exact filename (which looks like xxxxxx.exe) in your internet browser's search bar. From there, you will know which software product uses such file. Then you can uninstall that software product from your system, then monitor from the Task Manager again. If everything is ok, then you can re-install the software product back. The second way is to look for the ".exe" file in your hard drive. You can do a file search from your Windows Explorer window, and search your whole drive for that specific filename. From there, you can see which directory and program that file belongs to. Then you can unistall that program. Then monitor using the Task Manager again. If everything is ok, you can re-install the program back.|`|DjGEJfaPaa	This is most likely due to Malware (computer viruses, worms, trojan horses, spyware, dishonest adware, and other malicious and unwanted software).

Most programs use InstallShield.|`|uX05dLDwaa	There is actually a lot more to your question than you think.  The true answer is, "It depends".<br>  <br>  Install Shield is a product that software uses to make it easier to install.  Install Shield in-and-of itself is perfectly safe.  However, if a malware program is using Install Shield to install, then it becomes dangerous.<br>  <br>  So, if install sheild is just popping up and you have done nothing that should try installing software, then there is a good chance that you are being attacked by some sort of Malware.<br>  <br>  If you are installing software intentionally, then there is no problem with Install Shield.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps.

The only thing I've been able to find on no beeps is a power supply failure.  Which could make sense; it could be failing as the hard drive is trying to draw more power to spin up as well as read & write.<br>  <br>  Next time you're inside the case, make sure that everything's seated properly, and that all the connections are tight.  Also, take a look at the power supply, as well as the connectors leading off from it to the different components.  Good luck!|`|D4AQhtCJaa	when you remove the memory it will beep continuously.

uX05dLDwaa	IMHO, too much is never enough.  Get the best CPU you can buy, but if your strictly looking for a performance boost, the CPU won't get you the most bang for the buck.  Add more memory.  The one thing that is certain is that you will never have too much memory.  Put as much in as your PC will hold.  If you still need more performance then look at upgrading the processor.<br>  <br>  With that said, yes, the AMD Turion is a good processor and I highly recommend them.|`|AA10343626	Not sure why you want to upgrade the CPU?

It can't be true at all that registry cleaners degrade the system performance.|`|9669328c4e15ac9e02e85263a3a9aeb1aa	Yes, your computer will run better if you occasionally clean your Windows system registry. But first, let's define exactly what the registry is. The registry is a database in which Windows keeps track of relationships between hardware and software. It stores all the settings and options for the operating system, hardware, software, users, and preferences of the PC. The registry manages your system start up options, and keeps track of all software that's installed.<br>  <br>  Prior to the introduction of the Registry in Windows 95, each software package had it's own INI files to store configuration settings. These files tended to be scattered all over the hard drive, which made them difficult to keep track of. The centralized registry does consolidate all that information, but it has its own problems. Since it is a single point of failure, damage to the Registry can render a Windows system unbootable, and in extreme cases can only be fixed by reinstalling the operating system. (That's why backups are important!)<br>  <br>  I have never heard anything about registry cleaners degrading the systems performance.  You don't have to use them everyday or anything like that just occasionally.|`|SkTDanjhaa	If done properly, cleaning your registry will improve the speed of your computer's performance, however if you don't know what you're doing, You can cause so much damage to it that it will not boot up.<br>  <br>  I use CCleaner to get rid of obsolete registry files for me, Then I can't get rid of essential stuff.

wGjvx0Z9aa	You can put any song you can think of on myspace. The only thing is you DO have to sign up for an account in two different websites.  It sucks, but you only have to do it once and only sign in w/ password and stuff if you want to modify/delete the songs.  <br>  <br>  If you download the song in mp3 format on your computer, you can go to a music file uploading site, such as ripway.com (the accounts are free) and upload the song you want. Next, after uploading it, go to your files list on ripway and it should display a url underneath it. <br>  <br>  Go to myflashfetish.com (you may have to sign up for that too, but it's free anyways) and select an mp3 flash player from their list of different styles. Next, it'll tell you to fill in the playlist entries with a url and a song name. Type the name in yourself and copy/paste the url from the ripway song file to the myflashfetish playlist. Once you have the song(s) for your playlist, click create and it'll give you the code for you to paste in your profile editor. Complex sounding, but it's actually pretty easy! Hope this helps!! =)|`|AA10555856	what you could do is upload the song to an outside server like yahoo geocities, and embed the file on your profile, with a code in your about me section|`|GmDeBxqJaa	You can use The Music Hutch <a href="http://www.themusichutch.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.themusichutch.com/</a> to upload and search music and then copy the embed code into your myspace profile.

Podes poner un modulo de memoria ram mas, o para que reiniciar o comprar una memoria si se puede configurar! =D. De la memoria que tenes vos, vas a sumarle el 50% mas. ejemplo, si tenes 512 de memoria, de memoria virtual tendrias que tener 768 MG. Entendes? Bueno a todo esto. Vas a hacerle un click con el boton derecho sobre el icono mi pc, seleccionar propiedades. Vas a la solapa opciones avanzadas, en el apartado rendimiento, seleccionas configuracion, en el nuevo cuadro de dialogo vas a opciones avanzadas y abajo de todo en memoria virtual, seleccionas cambiar y en tama?o inicial colocas el resultado que te dio y en tama?o maximo, tiene que estar el doble del resultado!. La numero de la memoria virtual no es fija, es dependiendo de la cantidad de memoria ram que tengas. Sino trata de bajar el consumo de la memoria RAM. En menu inicio, ejecutar, escribi msconfig. En la ultima solapa vas a ver los programas que se cargan al inicio.  Trata de poner los menos posibles asi no consumis tanta memoria ram al principio, asi tenes memoria. Espero que te haya servido|`|4M2oLonHaa	La memoria virtual es una porcion de disco duro que la PC usa cuando la memoria RAM es demasiado baja para la aplicacion que estas usando, en estos momentos no recuerdo como se aumenta...espero que te haya servido de algo mi explicacion. <br>  <br>  ??Exitos!!|`|RLwXwqCPaa	Significa que diste uso a todo tu ram y estas ocupando ahora la memoria virtual, esto debido algun programa o programas que estas corriendo a la vez.

Te daras cuenta cuando la memoria virtual se empezo a usar, todo funcionara mas lento. Para solucionar esto, embes de reiniciar como dicen todo, es entrar a Ctrl + Alt + supr y en la parte de rendimiento si tienes Windows Xp, alli te fijas en la parte de abajo cuanto Ram esta usado, y si esta usado mas del que tienes ya sabes que se esta usando memoria virtual. Para no reiniciar entra a procesos y ahi dice todo lo que se esta ejecutando y cuanta memoria ocupa cada apliccion. Fijate que es lo que ocupa mas y cerralo, pero CUIDADO hay muchas cosas alli que son del sistema, no las cierre. Si reconoces lo que es y es un programa tuyo puede cerrarlo, sino, mejor no tocarlo. <br>  Hay programas como el Ares que cuando lo dejo toda la noche al otro dia ocupa como 250 o 300 mb de la ram, cosa rara, lo ciero y lo vuelvo a abrir y listo. Esa es la solucion cuando no tienes ganas de reiniciar, y no estoy diciendo que reiniciar sea mejor que hacer esto.<br>  <br>  Por curiosidad si quieres saber donde regular la cantidad de memoria virtual que tienes entra a Panel de contros - Sistema y de la pesta?a opciones avanzadas elegi configuracion, el primero. ahi lo puedes cambiar pero no recomiendo que lo hagas.

Esta memoria, se utiliza únicamente para procesos especiales que utiliza la maquina... Esto hace que siempre se mantengan en linea estos procesos, ya que el finalizar de estos procesos, puede provocar un problema en la pc. <br>  Estos procesos no ocupan toda la memoria virtual, entonces deja un %60 libre. Estos son aprovechados si llegara a faltar memoria RAM, que es la otra memoria que sirve para los demás procesos... Si se llegara a agotar toda la memoria, es imposible el comenzar un proceso nuevo, y de este modo te aparece el aviso en tu computadora...|`|e07a28c297461ea87727b58ebdc5a4c1aa	solo reiniciala y listo!!!!!

Remove all firewalls and anti-virus on your computer, as more than one of them causes unwanted conflicts on your computer. Note: It is perfectly fine to have more than one anti-spyware. To remove “Windows Firewall”, click Start>Control Panel>Security Center>Windows Firewall>Off (not recommended) Note: Don’t worry about that, these steps will relieve you of that worry. Now that’s done, remove your ant-virus by clicking Start>Control Panel>Add or Remove Programs. (Wait for the list to be populated by all your programs on your computer.) Look for your anti-virus, then click “remove” after that follow the uninstall wizard to remove your anti-virus. Note: If you had a different firewall than “Windows Firewall” then just follow the way to remove your anti-virus, except look for your firewall instead of the anti-virus. (Make sure that the “Windows Firewall” is off also).<br>  Security Programs: <br>  ______________________________________...<br>  <br>  1.)

(This ensures that all or most of the programs have been properly installed on your computer). After restarting your computer twice, update every single program, this is to be done as much as possible. Now that you have updated all the programs reboot into “Safe Mode” (This will make a nice, deep, clean scan on your computer with your new programs)-Turn off your computer>Turn on your computer>immediately hold on “F8”. This brings you to the menu to go to “Safe Mode”. Use your arrow keys and select “Safe Mode” Then log in. Congratulations, you have logged into “Safe Mode” Now that you are in “Safe Mode” (Run a full scan on every program when told to.) Run a FULL SCAN on AVG anti-spyware, AVG anti-virus, and AVG anti-rootkit at the same time. After these programs have finished, delete all found infections. Now run a FULL SCAN<br>  on A-Squared Free, AdAware 2007 Free, and Spybot Search&Destroy at the same time so nothing can slip through. Note: There is not a Full Scan option on Spybot Search&Detstroy. If these programs have found anything, simply delete whatever they have found. Finally run a FULL SCAN with Windows Defender. It’s kind of hard to find out how to do a full scan on Windows Defender, so here’s how. On the top you can see “scan”, then right next to it, is a diagonal line, right next to that is an arrow, click on it and choose full scan. Windows should not find anything by now so if it hasn’t, congratulations your computer has been disinfected of viruses, spyware, and much more, but we are not done yet. Its time to clean up, so now run each of the clean up & tune up programs one by one! They should find some stuff so if they do then simply fix the problems by clicking fix or repair. Note: “Fix” or “Repair” are the options of most of the clean up & tune up programs. Congratulations your computer has been cleaned, disinfected, and tuned up.

jAuFXHYgaa	Busca alguna buena fotografía de alguien con pelo largo (como quieres ponerselo a la persona de pelo corto) en google images y bajala a tu compu, luego abres la foto en photoshop y clonas el cabello, es decir, le borras todo menos el cabello y copias el cabello y lo pones en un layer encima de la foto de la persona con cabello corto.. vas borrando lo que no quieras y ya.

Go into the control panel (Click "start" then "Control Panel" on Windows XP). Then double click on "System", click the "Hardware" tab & then the device manager button. This will bring up a list of all the hardware (Things like your sound card). It'll probably show some of your items with question marks beside them including your sound card.

Agora, se ela nao iniciar pelo CD, vc vai ter q entrar no setup e procurar a fun??o Sequence Boot, ai vc coloca o CD como o primeiro e o HD como o segundo, pode colocar tambem o Floopy Disc como primeiro e CD e HD como segundo e terceiro tambem, sem problemas.<br>  3 - A formata??o é feita durante o processo de instala??o do Windows, escolha a formata??o NTFS normal, nao a rapida, pois essa é mais demorada, mas é melhor.<br>  4 - A configura??o do setup nao tem nada a ver com a formata??o.<br>  <br>  Espero ter te ajudado...<br>  <br>  Um Abra?o.

a540129ea63766743cab1ecbd0266224aa	1.Wifi generally stands for wireless connections. There are public Wifis often referred to as “Wifi hot spots” offered sometimes by ISPs, airports, hotels, or some cafés for instance (as Sturbucks). Sometimes connection can require monthly subscription, one time fee or buying let say donut in café – most of the time it is free. If connection is not free it generally requires “password” to connect. Besides because lots of people use laptops at homes they often set they home connections to be wireless. Home connection can be set as opened or encrypted. Encrypted connection requires key (sort of password). Open connection can be connected by anyone. Open connections in most cases are set by people simply unaware of intricacies of networking, which don’t understand that doing so allows anybody with wireless device in range to use their Internet, while sometimes network is set as open purposefully either by someone who doesn’t mind sharing their bandwidth or hope to lure unaware people in order to steal their passwords or hack them (to prevent last: use firewall, block shares in PC, always use SSL connections (https) when logging to your internet accounts). As you can see answer to your question will depend.<br>  2.Passwords to router and key to encrypted wireless connection are two different things. Router password allows changing router and network settings, including setting wireless key for instance. Wireless Key is a password required to connect to network when connection is encrypted. Without last one it is not possible to use connection. Without first one it is not possible to administrate it.<br>  3.Generally any websites, even it is possible that some hot spot providers might lock some internet addresses making it not possible to connect to them<br>  4.YES – if you referring to wireless key. Wireless key is something which you can set in your router (if you referring to your own (or someone’s LOL) connection) – if you know router’s password.  Notably also wireless router passwords are often not changed by people from a defaults, which allows anyone within range to manipulate routers settings.<br>  <br>  If you live in big city, while walking through streets, your iTouch almost always will show many open wifi’s in range. I don’t think there is any law which prohibits using it even if its someone’s home connection (there is always assumption that owner of Wifi simply allows using it’s Internet), however make sure that you use SSL connection when logging to Yahoo through Safari for instance (or someone might sniff and steal your Yahoo user name and password)

You plug it into a USB port, and then what should happen is in a couple of seconds there will be a small window asking how you want to access the device. You double click "Open Folder to View Files."  Either that, or go to my computer and notice that there's a new drive letter (i.e. G: or E: or something)<br>  <br>  Then you, in the folder that has your music, select copy on all of the songs you want and you paste it into your jump drive.|`|RLwXwqCPaa	hi there<br>  <br>  1) put your jump drive on the usb port<br>  2) drag you music to the drive<br>  <br>  <br>  have a nice day|`|L11MJeKdaa	In Windows: <br>  When you plug your usb drive in it should come up with plug and play.

Cy3jse9Maa	Unfortunately it will bring it back to the point of purchase when you first used your laptop.  However....If you back up your system with system restore it will roll your computer back to a specified date of your choice.  So when you rollback, just pick the date you first installed XP, or any checkpoint thereafter.   Vista is nice to use in my opinion.  If you had it installed, you should explore it a bit.  Kudos.|`|MZfhZTypaa	Yes, it should.|`|GqLMdJGDaa	look there are 3 possibilities to bring vista back and m sure u ll be succeded . <br>  First ...there's a software with name EASYBCD ie easy boot cd which requires framework 3 . Offcourse the vista would ve installed on drive C: and u ve installed XP on another drive . So add the windows Vista  (put name) and add to the List which already ve Windows XP or vice-versa and locate the destination to drive C for both the OS on using this software<br>  <br>  Secondly if u ve Vista bootable DVD then simply boot it as a first booting device . when it ll asked u to INSTAL NOW there ll be an option of repair at bottom left side on same window. simply click repair and it ll show u the installed vista on drive C. just simply click next and there ll be the list of options . U ve to choose 1st option ie. Startup repair. It ll bring vista back to u by repairing boot partition.<br>  <br>  Thirdly, recovery disk ........! but i ve never tried it...coz each tym i used repair startup (SECOND way) to get back on Vista and there i insert the Windows XP option as a dual OS using EasyBCD (FIRST way). <br>  <br>  U must tried it...its really helpfull|`|JYhrfpSEaa	yupp or try system restore that will be a lot easier.|`|QbrWP3liaa	Yes it will, it will restore the laptop to exactly how you bought it.

AdCpei8uaa	It sounds like you have some messed up programs or a virus of some kind. You should get a virus scanner, there are some you can get for free, like lavasoft adaware, but it's probably better to invest in a more up-to-date one. If you can't install anything, first try pressing ctrl-alt-del and ending all programs which you don't know what they are. If EVERYTHING else fails, as a last resort, backup whatever files you need onto CD's and format your hard disk. Only do this if you have your windows or mac (or whatever OS you have) installation disk.

These three steps constitute the data processing cycle.<br>  <br>  1. INPUT=In this steps the initial data, or input data, are prepared in some convenient form of processing. The form will defend on the processing machine.<br>  <br>  For example, when electromechanical devises are used.<br>  <br>  <br>  2.

JZeNB1F7aa	interesting answers so far, unless the date keeps reverting to a much earlier date (often the1st of Jan 2000) then your CMOS battery on the mainboard is not your problem.<br>  Your System Restore (SR) is unlikely to go back more than a few weeks and only save the Registry information, the programs still have to be whole or the SR will have no effect.<br>  Your Recovery CD's will take the system back to the state when you first bought it, without any of your personal data or settings<br>  It does sound more like a Hard Drive issue. If you open My computer, right click on the C: drive how much free space is there? Windows needs around 10% free space to work properly, you stated a 120Gb HD so if it is one partition then you need around 12Gb. Obviously more than one partition means smaller free space required, just work out 10% and if you have more that is one possible problem eliminated. If you don't have 10% then move files (uninstall programs or delete files) from the C: partition until you do. <br>  Free space not a problem, go here and download this - <a href="http://www.tuneup-software.co.uk/download/" rel="nofollow">http://www.tuneup-software.co.uk/downloa...</a> it is a 30 day trial version but fully functional.

If you go to control panel, under system (in the classic view), go to the hardware tab, open the hardware manager.  Look and see what it says about the audio devices.

When it says that it doesn't support the file format, it means that the video was compressed with a codec that Microsoft hasn't bothered to build into Photo Gallery.  Apparently if the correct updates become available for the software it will let you know when you start it - then you will have to download them.  There are certain ones that Microsoft is likely never to support, so personally I would advise you to use something like VLC (www.videolan.org) to watch videos.<br>  <br>  With regards to the audio, it sounds like your drivers got uninstalled.  You can probably try fix it using the device manager.  I think you can get to it by typing "devmgmt.msc" (without the quotes) into the search box in the start menu.  Look in the list of items that appears for anything that might indicate your audio hardware - take note especially if it has a small yellow icon on it to indicate something is wrong.  Double click on the item when you find it, click Driver at the top of window that comes up.  Choose Update Driver (again, I don't know Vista well, so things might be slightly different.  Hopefully you'll be able to find this).  From there, you should be able to just follow the instructions.<br>  <br>  Good luck.

I have successfully managed to get rid of it using the Malicious Software Removal Tool from Microsoft. In the meantime do not click on those popups if you can help it, close any that do open up & do not do any internet shopping or banking until it is fixed. Another option is to back up all of your important files (only the ones that you are sure you know about!) and then do a full reinstall of windows. Make sure that you install an antivirus program as soon as possible & keep it updated. It's worth noting that this particular trojan does not affect firefox users (or any browser other than Internet Explorer) to the same extent so it's a good idea to use Firfox or Opera rather than IE.<br>  Also when you do come to the point where you can copy all your important documents back check them for virus's before you do!<br>  <br>  Good (& free) antivirus programs that you may consider using is AVG free, Avast! home edition, or Avira.

cd0b8a606b8fa881ab509aa821fea79baa	I believe it works like this.  Quick erase technically does not erase data, but it erases the data's location so that your CD player doesn't know it exists.  Complete erase actually goes in and clears out the data from the disk.<br>  <br>  Think of it like this.  You are going to France and the only way you can get around is by using a map.  You follow the map to go wherever you want.  In quick erase, there is a restaurant that exists in France but it is not noted in the map.  Therefore you have no knowledge that it exists and do not go in there.  In complete erase, the restaurant building is demolished so you cannot go in anyway.  In either case, you never reach the restaurant and have no knowledge of it.|`|AA12350891	As with most applications that erase data from computer media, they can do it in two ways.<br>  <br>  - The first is to simply get rid of the File Allocation Table information (or its equivalent) and remove the sector headers from the media. This way the media looks like nothing is on it. this is the 'Quick' method.<br>  <br>  - The 'Complete' method does the above operation, but then also writes random data over the entire media surface. This writes over all data contained on the media so that it cannot be recovered by any means.<br>  <br>  In fact, the 'complete' method really does not work fully unless the data is written over many times. So, the best of these programs will write over each area of the media several times to make sure all data is really gone.

The computer company wants to advertise the best possible product, and it is true that if you deleted your operating system and all your preset programs and languages, you would probably have a 160 GB hard drive. <br>  <br>  The RAM advertised on the box may have been worded to make you think that is what it contained, but (This is just a guess) It may represent the total possible RAM you could have if you upgraded your computer.|`|46b2a8615a21f0175f4fa75d9a98fcfbaa	Ok, this is a little complicated.

If so, you shouldn't start having real issues until you have less than 10% free capacity, so that's not your problem.  You can try cleaning up and defragging the drive, which will help performance some, but again, that's not your main issue.<br>  How much RAM do you have?  If it's less than 512, buy more (more is always better).  That will boost performance more than anything.  <br>  The error message you're getting can be caused by too few resources, but not usually.  More likely that you have a problem with your operating system, or the program itself.  I would check event viewer for errors, do a registry clean, and reinstall the program that keeps failing.  If it's multiple programs, run task manager in the background, focused on the performance tab, and see what resources are being consumed prior to failure.    (Some antivirus programs are notorious for stealing resources... you might check to see if that's the culprit.  Try AVG for free if it is.)  If RAM is insufficient, get more RAM or check for memory leaks.  If processor pegs out at 100% for an extended period, get a bigger processor.  Check the processes tab to see which programs are using RAM/processor.  <br>  If all else fails, reinstall windows.

Also you will probably need a new power supply if you get a newer card.|`|RasOixh6aa	You should be able too, as long as you have a PCI-E slot.

5LHuCYY9aa	Microsoft has online tutorials to perform this types of tasks, you can follow this link: <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/306524" rel="nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/306524</a> and it will explain how to burn files into CDs.<br>  <br>  These would be the content of the support article (Hope this helps):<br>  <br>  SUMMARY<br>  If your computer is equipped with a compact disc (CD) recorder, you can back up files or folders to a compact disc-recordable (CD-R) or a compact disc-rewritable (CD-RW). This article describes how to back up files or folders to a CD-R or a CD-RW.<br>  <br>  <br>  Back to the top<br>  Copy files and folders to a CD<br>  To copy files and folders to a CD:<br>  1. Insert a blank writable CD into the CD recorder.<br>  2. Double-click My Computer, and then click the files or folders that you want to copy to the CD. To select more than one file, hold down the CTRL key while you click the files you want.<br>  3. Click any of the following options:<br>  ? Copy this file<br>  ? Copy this folder<br>  ? Copy the selected items<br>  4. In the Copy Items dialog box, click the CD recording drive, and then click Copy.<br>  5. In My Computer, double-click the CD recording drive.<br>  <br>  Windows displays a temporary area where the files are held before they are copied to the CD. Check that the files and folders that you intend to copy to the CD are displayed under Files Ready to Be Written to the CD.<br>  6. Under CD Writing Tasks, click Write to CD.<br>  7. After the CD Writing Wizard starts, follow the instructions in the wizard.<br>  8. When the process is finished, the wizard displays a check box for you to choose to create another CD like the one you just made. If you want to create multiple copies of the same CD, click Yes, write these files to another CD and insert another blank, writable CD into the CD recorder. Follow the instructions in the wizard. NOTE: After you copy files or folders to the CD, it is useful to view the CD to confirm that the files are copied.<br>  <br>  Back to the top<br>  Delete CD recorder temporary files<br>  To delete files and folders from the CD recorder temporary storage area:<br>  1. Double-click My Computer, and then double-click the CD recording drive.<br>  <br>  Windows displays a temporary storage area where files are held before they are copied to the CD. Files or folders located in the temporary storage area are listed under Files Ready to Be Written to the CD.<br>  2. Under CD Writing Tasks, click Delete temporary files.<br>  <br>  Windows deletes the files and folders from the temporary storage area and moves them to the Recycle Bin. NOTE: When you delete the contents of the temporary storage area, you make this area available for another set of files and folders that you want to copy to the CD. The files are not deleted from their original location on your computer or from the CD.<br>  <br>  Back to the top<br>  Troubleshooting<br>  ? Older CD recorders may not create (or "burn") CD-RW discs. To resolve this issue, use the CD recorder to back up information to CD-R discs.<br>  ? You can erase and use CD-RW discs again, but the discs may not play in other devices (such as audio CD players). To resolve this issue, use the CD recorder to back up information on CD-R discs. These discs can be written only once, but they play in most CD players and CD-ROM drives.<br>  ? CD recording may fail intermittently. To resolve this issue, use any of the following methods:<br>  ? Defragment your hard disk regularly. To start Disk Defragmenter, click Start, point to All Programs, point to Accessories, point to System Tools, and then click Disk Defragmenter.<br>  ? Check your hard disk for errors regularly. You can use the Error-checking tool to check for file system errors and bad sectors on your hard disk:<br>  1. Double-click My Computer, and then click the local disk that you want to check.<br>  2. On the File menu, click Properties.<br>  3. Click the Tools tab, and then click Check Now in the Error-checking section.<br>  4. In the Check disk options section, click to select the Scan for and attempt recovery of bad sectors check box.<br>  ? Be sure to free up enough hard disk space for the files you want to burn to CD. You can use Disk Cleanup to free up space on your hard disk. To open Disk Cleanup, click Start, point to All Programs, point to Accessories, point to System Tools, and then click Disk Cleanup.<br>  ? Before you start the recording process, close all other programs (such as screen savers and anti-virus software), and avoid starting programs that may interrupt the recording process. |`|5fc4cd48f8bc7b5cd9ad2dc538a9523faa	open your burn programme and select data disc <br>  add your programme properly in a zip folder<br>  then click the burn button|`|b217c37cf583bbd373500c267afbc847aa	First of all you need a Disc burner (most modern PC's should already have a DVD or CD burner).

If the PC has a DVD or CD writer then you may want to consider copying all your important files onto CDR's/DVDR's for safe keeping & simply doing factory reset. (In other words wiping the hard drive & starting over!). Then only install the programs that you need INCLUDING an Anti-virus program such as AVG. Doing all that will speed your computer up no end!<br>  <br>  Oh & building one isn't that expensive either here's one I built earlier from budget parts:<br>  <br>  Case: ￡11 ($22)<br>  Motherboard: ￡55 ($110)<br>  CPU (AMD Athlon x2 4600+): ￡45 ($90)<br>  2 GB memory: ￡22 ($44)<br>  360Gb Hard Drive: ￡35 ($70)<br>  DVD Writer ￡0 from my old PC<br>  PSU 500W ￡12 ($24)<br>  Thermal Grease: ￡5<br>  Windows XP: ￡0 ($0) used the same copy from my now defunct PC<br>  <br>  Total cost: ￡185 (around $360)<br>  <br>  When you build one you don't need to buy all the parts in one go so your (or even you!) could buy the parts over the next few months then build a PC that will be ten times as fast as the one you have!

Install only one, but you can get AVG, Avast! or AntiVir for free. <br>  <br>  You also need anti-spyware. No single anti-spyware application is perfect so I recommend using at least 2 different programs. Spybot Search & Destroy is one of the best. I also recommend SUPERAntiSpyware. Other free anti-spyware programs would be Adaware, AVG Anti-spyware (formally Ewido), A-squared, Spyware Terminator and SpywareBlaster.<br>  <br>  Running these programs in Safe Mode (tap F8 as the computer boots up and choose to boot to safe mode) can be more effective.<br>  <br>  I strongly recommend using FireFox, it's a far better and safer alternative to Internet Explorer. If you add-on McAfee SiteAdvisor, it will warn you of potentially harmful sites.

It not a job for the novice. Generally, it is not a good idea to upgrade the CPU on a laptop as the speed increase is not worth the expense of changing the chip.

AA11703028	hi mate<br>             the specifications of the hardware you are buying are pretty decent and with windows 7 just around the corner the 4gb of memory and the quad core cpu should be able to handle the next windows os<br>           and the radeon 3870 is a pretty decent graphics card,its 775mhz core clock is excellent and the 1gb of gddr4 memory running at 1125mhz(2250mhz ddr effective) ensures there will be minimal lag when playing games<br>          and the inclusion of the excellent de-coding features and avivo with the 3xxx and 4xxx series of radeon cards means this is also a excellent multimedia card aswell<br>          as for the games ,well the majority of todays games are still playable with direct x 9 cards so a direct x 10.1 card like the HD3870 should be capable of playing games for the next few years at least<br>           and even so,the reason many guys buy a pc is so they can upgrade as soon as the latest graphic card or cpu is released<br>            however if you do what i do and wait 2 or 3 years so the price of the hardware has dramatically reduced and you make a massive saving,for example i recently bought a geforce 7900gs,which on release was nigh on ￡225 however last month i purchased it for ￡49,a saving of ￡175<br>          the only hardware that dosent reduce in price is memory,the older it is the more expensive,for example ddr memory is far more expensive than the ddr2 memory,you can get a 1gb ddr2 module for ￡10 however the same size in ddr is around ￡30<br>           so in reflection the above specs should be fine and keep you going for the next few years at least,however try to avoid overclocking especially within the warranty period of the hardware as it voids the warranty<br>           any problems let me know<br>                      good luck mate !|`|B20bhtioaa	A year ago I bought a core 2 duo E6600 (2.4Ghz)<br>  Overclocked it to 2.7Ghz and at the time, this was a great spec!

b217c37cf583bbd373500c267afbc847aa	Try re-installing the drivers for the graphics card. Make sure you use the latest drivers available from Nvidia too! Just because they were the latest then, does not mean they are the latest now!<br>  <br>  You may also want to consider checking to see if the card requires extra power from the PSU.

JZeNB1F7aa	lots of holes like headphone sockets are your sound ports.<br>  If these are up near the back plate with the VGA or PS2 mouse ports etc then you have on board sound. So no card but a chip.<br>  If the "holes" are in one of the add on slots that run along the side of the case near the bottom then you have a sound card|`|b217c37cf583bbd373500c267afbc847aa	Look at the back, you see those three holes that look like earphone sockets? Well that means you have a sound card (or at least a sound chipset on the motherboard).<br>  <br>  So that'll be a yes then!|`|WeZcSZvKaa	Simplest thing to do is to go into the Control Panel > Sounds & Audio > Sounds > If they are all greyed out then you have no sound card.|`|XlyLakYAaa	First of all, "got" is past tense.  You could've gotten a sound card years ago, but that doesn't mean anything now, does it?  I assume you mean "how do I know if I HAVE a sound card or not"<br>  <br>  Anyway, almost all computers nowadays have a sound card.  Most are built into the motherboards.  Unless you have a really old computer (over a decade old) or have a removable sound card that you took out yourself, then you have a sound card.
ZSxLCrM0aa	Dell builds their computers as cheap as possible, therefore their power supplies are only designed to power the computer as it was initially built. The voltage of your power supply isn't the determining factor, rather the wattage. You can try new card, and it will most likely work as long as the new card has the same requirements as the old one. Good luck.|`|b217c37cf583bbd373500c267afbc847aa	Yes though I wouldn't bother with it, there are far better cards out there for the money now.<br>  <br>  The only thing I'd look at is the power supply, you want one that produces at least 500Watts (note WATTS not VOLTS) of power!
QxLcW0Flaa	I had the 6200 with 256 mb ddr.  I would suggest trying to get a pci card that has about 512 mb of ddr memory.  Its sometimes hard to find standard PCI-bus cards with that memory.

hvw0UXmhaa	Not exactly. The motherboard is the determining factor for whether your sound and video are built-in or not. Any machine from a large manufacturer (Dell, Gateway, HP, etc.) will have sound and video, but that doesn't necessarily mean that they are built-in. Sound and video cards can actually be peripheral add-on cards that physically plug into your motherboard through the use of specialized slots, or they can be the built-in variety which means they are physically soldered onto the motherboard itself from the motherboard manufacturer. The pros of having built-in components are cost (they generally cost less) and the opening of expansion slots for other add-on use (like if you added a firewire card or a separate hard drive controller). The cons are generally significantly reduced sound and video quality over their expansion slot cousins, and if sound/video ceases to work you'll have to replace the entire motherboard instead of that single component if the expansion slots are already full.|`|Yu7vBUkOaa	No. It's rare to find a computer without a sound card (or on-board sound) these days, but they aren't essential. A desktop wouldn't be a desktop without a way to connect it to a monitor, so it will always include with a video card or a motherboard with integrated video.|`|YVE64dJUaa	yes (unless specified)<br>  <br>  every computer sold for domestic use will have a sound card either integrated on the motherboard or as a separate card for more high end usage, same goes for a graphics card most low end or cheaper medium computers will have an integrated graphics card fine for general use but not for games they may have a separate card and if this card is a decent one and fairly powerful then it will play the latest games albeit you will also need a decent processor (1.6Ghz dual core at least) and a decent amount of RAM (at least 1GB - 2GB recommended)<br>  <br>  some computers are sold without these components for you to choose for yourself but this is becoming less common<br>  <br>  hope this helps|`|OYtMXYdjaa	No not everyone does, Tho most you buy in a store will. Reason they are cheaper. If you buy a high quality computer you will pay loads of cash for it but chances are it will have a separate video card and sound card. This also would happen if you built your own by buying the parts you wanted.<br>  <br>  But you will need a video card in order to see anything on your screen.<br>  <br>  As Always<br>  Play The Game Your Way<br>  Laterz <br>  <br>  Richie of <a href="http://www.online-games-your-way.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.online-games-your-way.com</a>|`|ItLN7fCBaa	Perhaps most have these both integrated these days.

KNppmXiXaa	The three areas to upgrade for your system:<br>  <br>  Memory - 2GB or higher (preferably 3 GB for gaming)<br>  Video Card - the GeForce 7600 GT is a decent card but a little old for some of the newer games.  I'd get the memory upgrade before this, but it would definitely get an upgrade soon.<br>  Hard disk - 80 GB is fairly small for gaming but if you only do a few games, you can get away with a small disk.<br>  <br>  The CPU is adequate for most games.  It is dual core and fairly efficient (I have the same CPU in my system with a GeForce 8600 GT and play games fairly well).  The motherboard is decent so unless you plan to upgrade your CPU (which I wouldn't do at this time), you shouldn't need to touch it.|`|FTmKRDwLaa	I would recommend that if possible change your CPU to a dual core with at least 2.2ghz per core, a 250gb hardrive and 3gb ram.

This & the RAM are two essential upgrades & will improve the performance of your pc no-end. You don't mention how powerful your PSU is so I would also advise that you buy yourself at least a 500W PSU. <br>  <br>  As for RAM, 1Gb is fine for running XP, Vista really needs at least 2Gb just to run properly!  As for gaming, anything more than that would be a bonus, the motherboard itself can handle up to 16Gb so your only real limitation i sthe operating system itself. If you have the 32bit version of either Xp or Vista, then the Maximum RAM that it will recognise is 3.5Gb. 64bit versions of either will not limit how much RAM you can put in your computer so you can literally use 16Gb of memory if required. Most (if not all) current games will run quite happily with 1 or 2 Gb on Xp, they will require more if you run Vista however. <br>  <br>  The processor itself is a bit of a weak point now too, the X2 processor was a fine & powerful beast when it first came out, newer ones still are. Yours however, is a little on the slow side now.

There simply is now excuse when you can buy a generic 500W power supply for less than ￡20 these days!|`|HqNiRRHlaa	Don't buy it if you don't already know the answer to your question<br>  <br>  <br>  I REALLY HOPE THIS HELPED. REALLY!!!!!!|`|QxLcW0Flaa	Most of what these guys are saying is true.  The 9500GT will need a big power supply to run the processor it has and as well as the fan to keep it cool.  Without the extra 50 watts the fan might not run properly.  However, and I am not saying you try this, I ran a pretty hefty graphics card asking for 350 Watts and all I had was 300 and it worked fine.  <br>  Most video cards now come with a saftey feature that will start beeping like all get out telling you turn off your PC i'm overheating.  Trust me you will know when that sucker goes off.  No your motherboard won't die from using a smaller power supply it just might not turn on until you disconnect the card.  Yes in a few cases cards can get messed up but for the most part you get that safety warning.  So really its up to you dude.<br>  <br>  I suggest you get a better power supply just so you don't have anything mess up.|`|GU7XqQCRaa	then you need a bigger power supply. it will work with the one you have but it will not have the correct power going to it, and possibly cause your power supply or motherboard to go out, or both|`|yHI6rfeUaa	It matters greatly.  Overloading a power supply burns things out and oftentimes it takes circuit boards with it.<br>  <br>  If you need 350 watts I would be sure to have at least 400 watt power supply if not more.

These files tell the computer or laptop how to operate the software installed on the system. If any of these files get messed up, the computer is not sure what to do and this will really slow down the computer. The other scenario is where you download other software, screensavers, pictures, videos, or even music, and this will somehow change the settings on a registry file. When this happens, the original program that needs that file now has the wrong instructions in it. So, it will cause the computer to run slow, or in a worse case, crash.<br>  <br>  You can speed up your computer with a thorough analysis and repair of your registry.

I wonder how many people have used a pirated copy of Photoshop and how many purchased a real copy.  I have clients that have used pirated copies of software as a try before they buy concept.  I have had so many CD's ruined or stolen over the years and I would like the go ahead to download them and use them as I wish.  I bought them but have nothing to show for it.  The problem is that GREED can't let the internet run it's natural course.  FREEDOM OF INFORMATION.  The amount of pirated games would be hard to calculate.  I wonder how often people ask WoW creators if piracy is an issue?  I look at DRM as shrink wrap, I hate it, it is a deterrent to purchase a product in my opinion.<br>  <br>  "The duplication of a program is like memorizing scripture, what you code becomes part of the knowledge base.

Piracy killed most of them and stopped the development of games for those computers or at least significantly reduced it. You can try as you may to justify it but if I write a programme or a song or whatever I want to be paid for it. How can you justify stealing it, forget piracy that's a word, if you take a programme I have written you are a thief. Don't wrap it up it's theft.

Comments are thrown about like "The industry lose ￡3 billion per year from software piracy" but that's taking into account all the people who have pirated software and then making the assumption that if they couldn't get the pirated software they would buy the original. But if a 16 year old is using a pirated copy of Adobe Creative Suite 4 then chances are if he couldn't get that software he wouldn't have the several thousand pounds it takes to buy it so therefore wouldn't buy it. The irony being that once that 16 year old has learnt the software and goes to work he will encourage his work to purchase CS4 as he already knows how to use it. Thus, the pirated copy has generated a sale.<br>  <br>  The biggest problem with answering that question is that both the pirates and the software industry have a vested interest in forcing the answer to fit their ideologies. Until someone truly independent can look at the figures no one will really know.|`|6IVv79cOaa	In my opinion, Software piracy is a very real threat to the industry, but only because they include draconian DRM (Digital Rights Management) that can cripple people's computers and treats their customers as criminals. <br>  <br>  The sad thing is, this DRM encourages even more people to pirate as they don't want to be treated as a criminal, and instead download the software without the DRM included - which will have been cracked by the pirates - to ensure that their computers function properly. Prime examples include SecuROM that limits the installation to FIVE installs, then you have to buy a new license in order to use it again.

After that you'll realise why It's necessary!<br>  <br>  Thermal grease speeds up the heat exchange between the processor and the heat sync. This means that the processor stays cool improving  both system reliability and increasing the lifespan of the processor!|`|XVMxuADtaa	Yes.<br>  <br>  The grease acts to fill the micro valleys in the CPU and cooler surface and aid heat transfer away from the CPU circuit.<br>  <br>  I have read of cases where applying too little grease results in temperatures 20 to 30 C above expected so imagine how much hotter an untreated CPU/Cooler interface would be....<br>  <br>  I think its the difference between a reliable and unreliable system!<br>  |`|r1ts6AxBaa	Generally CPU coolers come with a tube of grease or pre-applied grease. You can purchase a separate tube just in case.<br>  The reason that thermal grease is necessary is that the contact surface between the CPU and cooler is filled with minuscule indents and bumps that need to be filled in order for efficient thermal transfer from the CPU to the cooler. <br>  Otherwise your CPU will overheat and not work at full capacity or blow in worst cases.|`|ujMbWJa8aa	Yes it will make a huge difference in fact you could burn out the processor if you dont have it

It's also outdated.<br>  <br>  3 As you only got the computer yesterday I can safely assume it's running Windows Vista? 1024Mb of RAM is barely sufficient to run Vista alone, let alone games on top of that!<br>  <br>  My advice to you would be to upgrade the memory & ditch the graphics card. Upgrade to at least 2Gb (2048MB) of DDR2 memory & upgrade the graphics card to an 8600GT at the very least (A 9600GT would be better)! You will then see vastly improved performance across the board. I would also ditch the Celeron too, but it can wait a few months.|`|ulIBrNa9aa	youtube if used to much can slow down you computer try cutting that down and use it only 3 times a week you can also help by downloading a virus proctor such as<br>  TREND MICRO Anti Virus plus Anti Spyware|`|94c40bde02316088e15fc2e62e4f27c4aa	I think the main reason for slow computers is not enough ram (random access memory. While 1 GB (1024 MB) is enough for normal use, some games eat up quite a bit of the memory. It loads into memory, all the graphic and stuff it will need to perform the game, and not leaving enough to run the computer.  I'm not familiar with WoW, but you might check the specs on how much ram it requires. If you add ram, go for another GB.<br>  <br>  The other thing that slow computers is too many programs loaded into "start-up", but since it is a new cpu, I doubt it.<br>  <br>  Could be a virus.  Get a virus program right away, or if you have MS Vista, make sure Defender is set upto ward off viruses.

b217c37cf583bbd373500c267afbc847aa	I'm afraid that looking at your computer specs that it isn't compatible with that card. This is because the GeForce 8500GT card is PCI-e based & your motherboard only has an AGP graphics port & PCI slots (not PCI-e). That said, all is not lost, it is still possible to upgrade your graphics card to one that is fairly up to date. <br>  <br>  For example, you can get a GeForce 8400GS for the PCI slot & that would be the most modern card, however, it will still be outperformed by the last of the AGP based cards. The best nVidia you could hope for would be the 7600GS/GT or (if you can find one) the 7800GS. You should make sure & get one with at least 256Mb of RAM but go for one with 512Mb if you can afford it. Unfortunately I don't know any Philippine websites but I've provided a couple of links below to give you an idea of what you may want to look for.<br>  <br>  You may also want to consider adding another 512Mb of RAM too as that will also provide you with a significant performace boost, as will changing the processor for a P4.

If you are a heavy graphics user, opt for a more powerful graphics card. You might want to run the System Disk Defragmentor Utility. Go to 'Start' -> 'All Programs' -> 'Accessories' -> 'System Tools' -> 'Disk Defragmentator'. This processs will take several hours. Also, consider lowering screen resolution when a higher screen resolution is not needed. High screen resolutions put gratuitous strain on the graphics card. Delete all temporary Internet files and cookies because they take up a lot of space on the computer. If not, You can restrict the file size allocated to the storage of the above mentioned. Simply go to 'Internet Options' and under the 'General' tab, in the 'Browsing History' section, click on 'Settings', and then make necessary changes. You can also speed up your computer by deleting System Boot-up processes. Go to 'Start' -> 'Run', then type in 'msconfig'. You can then make the necessary changes. Another way to speed up your computer is the hit the Ctrl-Alt-Delete key combination which will take you to the Task Manager. Under the 'Processes' tab, you can delete unwanted background processes which will slow down your computer, or place priorities on programs by right-clicking it and clicking on 'Set Priority' and finally selecting the appropriate priority. Perform regular spyware scans on your computer to remove spyware, for they could really slow down the computer. There are many programs available free on the Internet which removes spyware. A simple search on the Internet yields many results. I suppose you can follow Dan's suggestion by installing a Linux OS on your computer. I reckon it does not need to run as many system configurations and miscellanous programs in background as do Windows OS.|`|AA11774071	what is the current configuration of ur pc, also what is the nature of use. based on these only one can decide how to increase the speed|`|b3a05853f1e43767d186f309889b9b5baa	I will suppose some things in the beginning.<br>  1. Your operating system is Windows (possibly XP)<br>  2. You are not a computer savvy.<br>  3. You are not able to install a Linux operating system on your own.<br>  <br>  Warning: Follow these steps at your own risk. If unsure, ask a specialist (and no, a specialist is not the guy who sold you the pc).<br>  <br>  So, first thing is to reduce the number of programs running that you do not need. You must remove the programs from startup. Push the start button, then from the menu choose Run.<br>  There write msconfig and hit enter. You'll have to select the last tab (startup) and go through that list. There will be some programs that you will need to leave checked, but others like yahoo messenger or adobe speed startup or quick time or any non-system program should be removed.<br>  Another thing that you can do is to defragment your harddrives. Start button -> Programs -> Accessories -> System Tools -> Disk Defragmenter. This will take a lot (depending on the size of your hard disk). There are also other tools, more performant than this one, like O&O Defragment (my personal recommandation). <br>  Use Add Remove programs to uninstall software. Do not just hit 'Del' on the program's folder. Use a registry cleaning tool. RegCleaner is excellent, but not enough. Use CCleaner for extra system cleaning. <br>  Until now, I adviced you on software posibilities. You could also buy some more RAM memory. Be careful with the timings (ask a specialist to help you with this).<br>  You could also buy a better processor. Or a better video card. Or a hard disk that has at least 8 megabytes of cache and 7200 RPMs. <br>  You should be more specific in your question, there are a lot of things you can do to make your PC 'fly'.<br>  Another thing could be installing a different operating system that will 'treat' your hardware better and will know how to take advantage of its full power. Do I hear a 'Linux' here? Oh yeah, baby. Give Kubuntu / Ubuntu Linux a try.

Be cautious and go up slowly though. If you jump too high you proc will overheat and burn up. Go slowly and monitor your temps. You should also use something of a burn-in test to monitor your temp at full load. It'll do you no good if your proc runs okay in temps at idle or minor loads but overheats at a full load.<br>  <br>  Also if you put your heatsink on your proc, check to see what the highest proc it recommends and that will tell you a little about what you can do too. I have an AMD Athlon XP 2700+ 2.083GHz and I have it overclocked to a 2800+ at 2.15GHz and even though my heatsink and fan are rated for a 3400+, my proc still runs around 65°c at full load. So make sure you check your temps.|`|f1952689a0efdd54cf421dd093a8bfcbaa	overclocking the cpu has 2 possibilities. either increase the front side bus frequency or increase the multiplier.<br>  processor speed=front side bus * multiplier<br>  eg: 133mhz * 17 = 2.26ghz<br>  this is normally done without increasing the voltage yet. only when the speed is no longer stable is the voltage increased to make it stable at a higher speed.<br>  increasing voltage also lowers the lifespan of the processor and too high voltage is damaging to it.<br>  the changes are done in the bios. if it ever becomes unstable, remove the battery on the motherboard for a min to reset it.

But let's assume you're meaning you have the physical items in place and you're wanting to configure the software. I would go through the installation CD that came with your router. That'll help you get the settings in the router and should even help you with the wireless adapter. Some are different than others so to say there is one specific way to set it up would be inaccurate. If you can't figure it out from the CD just do some searching on how to set it up based on your brands.

977ce410f6ee394cfeaad0de96015ef5aa	Hi, of course both the hard drives can be used. However it depends weather the system bord on your system supports it or not. We would hve to check the system spesifications to check what is best supported by your system. Then go a head buy the new hard drive and attach it.<br>  :-)|`|AA10923152	yes you can use both hard drives. the best way to utilize them is to make a smaller partition on one of them say 8 or 10gb for just your operating system. Install most of your programs on that drive except for large ones like games. Make a new partition on that same drive or another a different drive and install your games and other stuff there and also use that for storage. That way when you format again you wont have to worry about backing up your data since you'll only lose your OS.|`|06d692f342d982d0f8c4cd4a9da66746aa	You can connect two hard drives with no degradation in performance.  The limitation is in what type of HD controller your computer has.  Typically, IDE controlled drives are smaller than other drives, but if you are only looking for 80 MB, then just be sure you buy one that is compatible with your existing controller card.<br>  <br>  You may partition the new drive, if you wish, but I would recommend leaving your OS, paging files, etc. on the 40MB drive and using the larger drive for your active applications and data.<br>  <br>  Making a small (8-10 GB) partition is really only valuable if you are using much larger drives.|`|69e87d6ef24773acb84dfa7efe013f35aa	mentor are good reasonably good price on of my old PCs  has 48MB of ram and on windows me this one am typing to you now is Fujitsu Siemens with ATI RadonX1300 and 2 gig RAM fast huh!!!|`|AA11217337	Alright, as you may or may not know, A Microsoft OS takes up 256MB of Memory just for the OS. If you want you system to run "faster" then go with 512 or higher. About your Hard Drive (HD), you can split your HD's if you have enough cables and ports on your motherboard. If not just buy a bigger HD usually 120GB or Higher. Make Sure if you have a crappy Dell, they use their own parts and you must use theirs.

You can also reformat the whole drive also, as that will fix the problem.

People will say that Mac sux and that Windows is for "real people" but this is just their ignorance. It's also worth noting that the major upgrades/additions to Vista are simply copies of things that us Mac users have had for years.

I would recommend MSI. buy a built-in sound card too! you don't want to spend money on sound cards (if you're not making music on your computer).<br>  <br>  MEMORY: buy single-sided memory (good for high speed access and future upgrades.). For best performance, buy two identical memories. (if you want to have a 1gb system memory, buy 2x512mb). 2x512mb is better than 1x1gb.<br>  <br>  VIDEO CARD: depends on your CPU, if you use AMD, use ATI. if Intel, use NVidia. <br>  <br>  HARDDISK: I would recommend Maxtor<br>  <br>  DRIVE: DVD+/-RW RAM. Buy Buffalo! I've tried others, but this would be the best so far. (don't buy plextor).<br>  <br>  MONITOR: don't buy lesser  than 19'inch! You could get urself a Dell.. it's cheap.<br>  <br>  KEYBOARD/MOUSE: Logitech.<br>  <br>  CASING: Take the best looking of them all!<br>  <br>  I think that's all of it..

This will not restore your IE history or any personalised information and is actually potentially dangerous advice as it will roll back system files, device drivers etc to your previous settings, and could cause recently installed devices or programs not to work correctly.

Check the Microsoft link below "System Restore does not affect your personal data files (such as Microsoft Word documents, browsing history, drawings, favorites, or email) "<br>  <br>  Did you really mean "site feed"? As in an XML/RSS feed or similar? Your IE history only records addresses of webpages you have visited (not the content of those pages) and if it only goes back to Jan 1st, you're out of luck I'm afraid. You may have luck using auto-fill. If you know the first couple of letters of the website address, try typing it in, and autofill might give you the rest.<br>  To increase the length of time history is keep for - in IE, go to Tools, Internet options, general tab.

Your mtherboard will not support DDR RAM.800 Watt power supply is good & so is your hard disk. Buy a 5.1 GHz speaker. No need to go for 6.1 or 7.1 speaker|`|6sI8ss1Haa	personally I think going with a quad core processor at this point is overkill, there are only a couple games/apps that even support multi-core processors.  You would be best off going with a dual-core for now and upgrading to quad-core down the road when the prices drop. The Intel Core 2 Duo E6600 for $310 would be a good bet.  Also, if you aren't planning on overclocking, the stock fan/heatsink that comes with the processor would be plenty to keep it cool so you wouldn't need the Ultra ChillTec either. You would also be better served with atleast 2+ gigs of ram.|`|3DYk5Jgcaa	Looks good, two things I would up if possible: 1 gig of RAM is probably not going to cut it even with a powerful graphics card.  2 gigs at min and 4 if you want to go hard core.

You can just reinstall it back only files that made with the programs.<br>  <br>  What you can do is gather all documents and things you need to back-up and store it in external storage, such as external HDD or USB flash drive. You can just drag and drop it there. If all documents are not so big, let say less than 2gig then just use the USB flash drive. If bigger than that then buy a external HDD or if you have CD or DVD burner just burn it to the disk. Many options, just see what you have and what you can afford.|`|4e510286e92ccd593995a42da61afde8aa	using a dvd rewriter<br>  do you have nero ,there is a back up tool with nero.|`|AbFNyUPcaa	It depends how much you need to back up, and what hardware you have available. My first choice would be a second hard drive or a few very large removable flash drives.<br>  <br>  If you have to back up less than 4.5GB and you have a DVD writer, then burn it to DVD. Make sure to validate the disk and probably burn two copies for safety's sake.<br>  <br>  If it's more than that then you could split it across a number of DVDs or get hold of an external hard drive. If it's <1GB and you have a fast internet connection, you could try emailing it to yourself and downloading it from your inbox after the format.<br>  <br>  The key is to *organise*. You need to figure our exactly what you want to keep and get it sorted into a folder structure so that you can easily 'unpack' all the data after the format. I would, personally, get it all in one folder and zip the folder up using winzip or 7-zip to help compress it down.<br>  <br>  If the data is really important, then be sure to back it up to at least 2 different places.|`|AA10923152	so much of this depends on how your system is setup. If you have another drive then just copy your files onto that drive. If you're wanting all of your programs to stay installed. Well you're kind of out of luck on that. If you dont' have other drives or partitions then you probably need to just burn your files to a CD or DVD and then when you redo your PC, make a smaller drive for just your operating system and programs you're going to installs, for win XP I would make it 15Gb. Then make another partition of the rest of your HD and store your files on there so if you ever have to restore again you dont' have to worry about backing up files.

0tBEpMotaa	Yes, absolutely.  Though you may not get all the features.  For example, the older G4 Mac Mini, the one that I happen to have,  doesn't support the Core Image technology in OS X Tiger, but it still works.  I just don't get that extra boost in the graphics.  Each new version of OS X may require higher specs on a piece of hardware, and the Mac Mini, not being upgradable in certain areas, may not run every feature, but it will certainly work.|`|7b0de6ccc35e17bb626de5575353ae41aa	We don't yet know, the specs havn't been announced. When Tiger came out official support for G3 processors was dropped so it wouldn't be a huge surprise if support for G4 processors was dropped this time round which is bad news for me.<br>  But as I said no one outside of apple and their developer community know for sure yet.

The program that is running and has viewable display in use where the mouse clicks determines what happens next.  The fact that an interrupt has been generated is transmitted to the program if it's not something that the operating system (like Windows) will handle alone (for instance, if you click on a program that's in the background, but you didn't click on a button or other active part of the display, the window on which you click simply comes to the foreground).

Most DVDs for sale are 8 gb disks.  The ones for the home computer market are 4.7 gb, but with dual layer burnable disks, it's the same size as a movie DVD.  If you want to make a direct copy, you'll need appropriate software and a dual layer DVD burner.  However, I've found some programs that compress a movie down to 4.7 gb.

8vJFQUz8aa	You can usually find out what is causing lockups on your computer by reading the event viewer. Click on Start>Run.<br>  Type in eventvwr.msc and press enter. Browse through the Application and System logs and look for Errors, read the log file and see if there are any entries related to the programs you are running at the time of the lockups. If you find an entry related to the programs,  click on the link to the internet to see if there are any reported fixes for your problem. You should also be running antivirus/spy/ad programs on your computer to keep  these miscreants off of your computer especially since you are using p2p software. It is well known that these are pathways for virus' and ad/spyware. I hope this helps.|`|AA12350891	OK, what you describe sounds like one of three posibilities:<br>  <br>  - Since you said that your earlier system was doing the same thing, I would bet that you are plugged into a Surge Supressor for your main power. If so, get rid of the supressor and plug straight into the wall (at least your computer itself). Most of these units will actually cause the problem they are made to stop, when they get older (or new ones if they are cheap).<br>  <br>  - Memory could be the problem, but only if you are using the same modules as in your Win98 system. Run Memtest86 to test your installed RAM (<a href="http://memtest86.com)." rel="nofollow">http://memtest86.com).</a><br>  <br>  - Replace your power supply. If your Win98 system was in the same chassis as you have now and your power supply is more than a few years old, it can cause this problem (you mentioned this problem being around 1-2 years).

If not, and there is no autonumber field then you really have no way of knowing what was the most recently added user id.

n4WqP3Kaaa	maybe its in another language. Well if you are not expecting an email from that person just delete it. no harm done.|`|M9iO7Q0Eaa	That is a very, very, very common "spam" message. Spammers put all of these crazy symbols in e-mail subject lines, title headings and name fields; in an attempt to confuse the software that companies use to block such spam. The problem is...a lot of companies' software looks for words and phrases that are simple and typical. So if it's complicated and the spammer inserts all of these symbols into it...the system can miss it and it slips on by the filters and right into the inbox (instead of the bulk or 'junk mail' folders). It's spam...if you're using Yahoo e-mail, just check off the box next to it and hit the 'spam' button to have it reported.<br>  <br>  Another tactic that spammers are using nowadays is putting all kinds of simple words together to make the spam blocker software think it's a story. I've seen nonsense words arranged in paragraph form. I've seen pictures in e-mail containing the spam message within the pictures...also nonsense words arranged to confuse the spam fighting software. It's all a big race each day for companies to try to get rid of all of this junk floating around by the millions and billions of e-mails per day.|`|6a9Yvrdgaa	No, it's not a virus. It's spam, which can't hurt anything if you open it, because spam is just unsolicited email. You can either check mark the box beside it & hit the " spam " above, and that will report it. But, if you are like me & would like to find out where it came from, it's easy & harmless. In fact , yahoo gives you the tools to do it. Open the email ><br>  go down to the very bottom of the page & look for the words " FULL HEADERS ". click on that, and the info that comes up will have the " IP ADDRESS " of the sender.

So, you have a friend grab <a href="http://pclinuxos.com" rel="nofollow">http://pclinuxos.com</a> and burn it to CDrom.  Then, you run it, live, and switch,                     make the hard drive permission to write so you can create a folder, dl the drivers for windows, and then access them when you reboot to the windows install.<br>  <br>  Careful, as, when you learn how efficient Linux runs (upto 50X faster!), and that it comes with 5500 FREE applications, and performs automatic drive maintenance, you'll install it, and never go back!

I'd recommend requesting a new recovery disc or find the old one if you still have it hidden somewhere. The registration number for XP would be different than the one on your laptop. You could end up with Windows claiming the Windows is pirated, because you should only have one computer (i.e. motherboard) for each registration number. Getting your ethernet to connect should be top priority. If you go to Window's update after getting your ethernet driver from the manufacturer's website (burn it to a disc or something to get it from your laptop to your desktop), it may have all the drivers you need for the rest. Just go to the site, select Custom, and then Hardware, Optional. If you have a separate video card then you need to go to the manufacturer's site and get it.

But this require your laptop / computer to have a wireless card or wireless device. ( if you have a centrino processor you are ok)<br>  <br>  The router connects multiple machines to the internet, meaning you can share the internet with more than one machine.<br>  <br>  Good router brands: Linksys and D-Link (~$30-50)<br>  <br>  The only problem with routers is that you are going to have to set it up properly, it can be complicated at first and has many options.<br>  <br>  If you are going to broadcast wireless, i suggest you eventually place a password on your connection with the highest available security (WPA is better than WEP). This way random people can't abuse your internet.<br>  <br>  The wireless card allows you to connect to the router, these are fairly common these days already INSIDE the laptops.<br>  if you dont have one, you must purchase one that would fit to your laptop. there are USB, PCMIA and newer ports availble; make sure you purchase the correct wireless card.

Esso diventerà rosso: cliccaci su e potrai scrivere il testo della pagina in questione. Faccio un esempio: se devo creare la voce "Divina Commedia", vado su "Dante", aggiungo (se non c'è già) il link alla pagina "Divina Commedia", ci clicco sopra e compare la schermata di modifica della pagina "Divina Commedia".<br>  2) Inserisci il nome della pagina da creare nella casella "Cerca" e dai l'invio. Nella pagina "Ricerca" che comparirà, sarà scritto: "La pagina "Tal dei Tali" non esiste. è possibile crearla ora". Facendo clic su "crearla ora" potrai scrivere il testo della nuova voce.<br>  3) Si può anche andare nella barra degli indirizzi e scrivere, dopo /wiki/ il nome della pagina da creare (p. es., /wiki/Carlo_Magno), ma questo è più difficile quando l'intestazione contiene caratteri con accenti e segni d'interpunzione.<br>  <br>  Per le immagini, cerca su Wikipedia se ci sono foto che fanno al caso tuo, sennò devi caricarle, e per questo bisogna essere registrati (clicca su "Carica un file" nella barra laterale).

Software at the manufacturer's include the OS and a whole bunch of trial versions from software companies that offered them a cut if you bought into it.  They use a lot of real state. Be careful with those, if you use them and the trial period ends, you will not have any access to anything you've created with those programs until you put down some money for the license.|`|IsP6e3Kuaa	When a company sells a hard drive they market the 'capacity' as 1GB = 1,000,000 bytes. The problem with this is that the computer measures the capacity as 1GB = 1,024,000 bytes.<br>  So the box says 160GB but the 'real usage' of the drive is the 127GB (there is also slight overhead that the operating system takes away when formatting the drive).|`|FDznY1k0aa	Could be a couple things. If your drive is clean, with nothing else installed, then the problem is more than likely in the bios of your motherboard. The BIOS may not allow any drive larger than 128G. If that is the case, then look for a bios flash update from the manufacturer's website.|`|IFtV7g2Zaa	Is this a new computer?<br>  <br>  There are a couple of things going on.  Many new computers have a hidden partition which stores information for recovering your computer in the event of a hard crash.  Manufacturers are notorious for confiscating 10 to 40Gb of your hard drive for this.<br>  <br>  Second, your hard drive isn't actually as big as the marketing folks would have you believe.  Besides the fact that they lied about the size, they probably rounded the final calculation up to the nearest multiple of 10.  In other words, a 156Gb drive is sold as a 160Gb drive.<br>  <br>  Somewhere on the box the system (or drive) came in, is a statement like 1Mb = 1,000,000 bytes.  In the world of computers, this just isn't so.  1Mb is 1,048,576 bytes.  The practice was started many years ago, when the difference wasn't really noticeable, when 1 kilobyte was 1024 bytes and was marketed as 1000 bytes.  The 1.44Mb floppies actually held only 1.34Mb.  Hardly a difference worth worrying about.<br>  <br>  But today, we're dealing with gigabytes.  And the difference is more noticeable.  Something that is, in reality, only 127Gb, would be marketed as 137Gb, and probably rounded up to 140Gb.<br>  <br>  Go to the control panel, open the Administrative tools applet, and select Computer Management.  Then on the left side, select Disk Management.  You should see Disk 0, and the CD drive and any removable drives that are attached.  Look at Disk 0.  The graphical representation of the partitions will show you whether there is a hidden partition and its actual size.  Also, where it says Disk 0, below that you will find an indicator of the actual hard drive size, including all partitions.<br>  <br>  Edit: One note of caution.  Do not make any changes in the disk management applet, unless you know what you are doing.  Improper changes can cause your computer to not boot anymore.  Familiarize yourself with what you are looking at, and know exactly what the consequences of your actions will be, BEFORE you make any changes.|`|n4aSIOEBaa	Companies market their products using the rounder decimal value instead of the binary system, hence the reason you have a discrepancy.

nwwnEpl1aa	First off, a "bus", or "data bus" is a geek word for a data or power connection inside a computer.<br>  <br>  The basic architecture of a computer has:<br>  <br>  A CPU (Central Processing Unit) or "processor" (e.g. Intel Pentium, Intel Core Duo, PowerPC G5).<br>  <br>  A "northbridge", "Memory Controller Hub" or "System Controller" which typically links to the fast components such as RAM and graphics card.<br>  <br>  A "southbridge" or "I/O Controller", which typically links to the slower components such as Hard Drives, Optical Drives, PCl, USB, Bios (on a Windows PC), etc.<br>  <br>  The FSB of "Front Side Bus" is the connection between the CPU and the Northbridge. As such, it determines how quickly the computer processor, ram and graphics card can communicate, and as such is one of the elements that determines the real world performance of a computer.<br>  <br>  The 800MHz portion is an indication of the speed of the FSB. A hertz is a measurement of frequency in a second (i.e. how many cycles per second). Therefore, a MHz (or megahertz) one million cycles per second. In turn, 800MHz is 800 million cycles per second.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps.|`|jVWK4Vyuaa	FSB = front side bus|`|DzP6DB2zaa	Correct to everybody who as answered this question That also makes this prossesor a prety good one at that stick with it.|`|4e70613829a7b6d7f0627c5b421c5a49aa	800MHZ front side bus|`|6sI8ss1Haa	the front side bus is the path data takes to and from the processor to various components on the motherboard.
