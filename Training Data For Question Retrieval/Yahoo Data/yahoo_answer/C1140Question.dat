20070612160636AAAN40v	Beauty & Style;Skin & Body;Other - Skin & Body	Which works better& longer for removing leg hair: "Nair" or "Veet"?	I have sensitive skin and I've heard that Nair and Veet both now make products for sensitive skin.      But, I want something that won't leave my skin bumpy/red/irritated.      AND, obviously I want something that will leave my legs feeling smooth as long as possible.  When I shave I can feel stubble coming back up the next day!  Eek!      I know about waxing but its way too expensive for me.      Anyway, as hair-removing creams/gels/etc. go, which is better?      AND: what about NADS?  Can you get it at a drugstore/grocery store?  Or do you have to order it on TV?   Is it the best?      Thanks!

Empezare por contarles que gracias a Dios habia tenido un muy buen físico, aunque mi alimentación se encuentra dentro de los parámetros normales, mi actividad deportiva es alta,  mi constitucion genetica también me ha ayuda enormemente.   Desde hace algunos meses me remitieron al gym para fortalecimiento de musculos, pero desde hace aproximadamente mes o mes y medio se han incrementado mis medidas, pero lo preocupante ocurre en mi cintura, dentro de poco no se si tendré. He descartado posibilidades como la del embarazo, y otras enfermedades.       Quizas mi error fue que cuando lo note no le preste atención, pero ahora si me estoy preocupando por que algunos de mis pantalones favoritos ya no me cierran, y para colmo ahora algunos de mis amigos  y mi novio hablan de mujeres con supercuerpazos, me van a acomplejar.       Por favor le pido ayuda a quienes conozcan de metodos (ejercicios específicos, medicamentos...) para manejar mi problema. Reciban un abrazo enorme desde Colombia.

I'm in high school, and I plan to go into the veterinary field. To show my promise and dedication to fulfill this, I want to get a small tattoo of a paw print on my wrist. I like this design, but wouldn't want it to be this big, maybe a quarter to half the size of this:  http://i52.photobucket.com/albums/g36/ma...       It would probably be either purple, (like the animal rescue site paw print), black, grey, or brown.       My question is, how long would a tat this size take? I have a needle phobia so this would also be a chance to face my fear. I don't have any tattoos currently, this one would be my first (and last)! I know the consequences of tattoos, and that I might regret getting it. I'm a person with strong moral values and would not be doing this to rebel or to fit in, I just want to show my love for animals and the promise I've made to myself and family. After all, there is always tattoo removal...

20090227021917AANW1bd	Beauty & Style;Skin & Body;Other - Skin & Body	Why do people call bigger women curvy?	I can't understand it. I always read about celebrities losing their curves because they have lost weight or if they carry a bit of weight they call them curvy. It's like curves are associated with being bigger. It annoys me because fat and curves are not the same thing. For example, Halle Berry is very thin and she has curves. The same goes for Charlize Theron and Jessica Alba. No matter how much weight these woman lose (even if they become anorexic) they will still be curvy because they all have an hourglass figure. Having a curvy figure has nothing to do with weight it's because of bone structure! There are definitely bigger women that are curvy, however they have to have the bone structure to be truly curvy, not just bulging fat deposits.       Anyway, I want to know if you think having a curvy figure is because of bone structure or weight?

20080930074318AAp3zk4	Beauty & Style;Hair	Ok so I've booked in to have X-Tenso done on my hair tomorrow, is this a good idea?	It's going to cost ￡60 for just half my head - the whole head would cost ￡110. The underneath of my hair is pretty sleek so I thought I'd just get the top half done. It's curly, but frizzy, especially at the back. It can look nice if I've just washed it and I twist it with conditioner to define the curls. Or it looks nice if I straighten it. It takes ages to do this though, and it's such a pain in the morning to deal with my massive bouffant hair. Has anyone else had X-Tenso and what did it do? I don't really want dead straight hair, I just want more relaxed, smoother hair.

20090305084150AAr2iBq	Beauty & Style;Hair	Level 7 copper red hair to level 9ish golden blonde - much damage in the process?	A long time ago I had dyed my hair black and I double process bleached to get all the black out and cut it super short to start over fresh.  It was disgustingly damaged being platinum blonde from black but it needed to be done.  I dyed the still existing porous, damaged hair level 7 red brown (added purple so it would stick to the hair) then level 7 copper red til the bleach grew out.  I am naturally a level 7 neutral brown.  Now I have short level 7 copper red hair with some purple that was in it before and almost all of the old bleach-black hair disaster has grown out.  I want to go level 9 golden blonde with cool highlights.  Can I do this if my hair has been dyed copper/red, at one time purple?  I figure I can because it's only a few shades lighter.  I just want your opinions before I screw up and have another year of growing it out again.
