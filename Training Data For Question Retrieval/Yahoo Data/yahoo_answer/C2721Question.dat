20090307102345AAu8oU0	Pets;Dogs	What should I do about my dog?	I have a two year old black lab who never used to play with a ball. Suddenly, she started being a real retriever but has become aggressive towards other dogs when the ball is around. Other times, she will randomly go at a dog (usually a small one), for no reason. She is mostly aggressive on a leash but it has been becoming worse and worse. What should we do? Because we don't want to have an aggressive dog.

20090307102925AAYWzKF	Pets;Dogs	I don't know......all but one thing is good.?	Ok, so I have done a lot of research on what my next breed will be. I have found that a Pap will be excellent for me....except for there's one problem. I'm used to medium sized dogs, and downsizing to a toy breed will be really different for me. I'll be able to adjust, but it will be different.      The size is the only thing about the Papillon that I don't really like. I won't be getting one for at least another year...so, do you think I should get one? They match my requirements for a dog, except for their size....

20090307102829AAiXYDv	Pets;Dogs	What to do about a semi-aggressive dog?? PLEASE HELP?	have three dogs ( well they are all family dogs because i am 13) one is mine and they other two are my dads and grandmas. My dog hubble is about 4 years and she has a sister named smokey who is also 4. My other dog who is much bigger then them is sen-chi. Anyway smokey attacked hubble and there was an horrible fight in which both of the dog had to be separated by animal control and taken to the vet. Hubble had more damage then smokey but they both got hurt pretty badly. Now they are all separated from each other (including sen-chi) and have to be kept in kennels most of the day. Now i am very worried that my dog Hubble will never be able to be around other dogs again. Hubble is a Black Lab mix and weighs about 48 pounds. She has always been overly playful with other dogs. She has been to the dog park many times as well as being around other dogs. She was fine with all of the other dogs ( except her over playfulness, extreme sniffing,running around a lot taking other dogs toys sometimes etc..) I really want to fix her problem but i don't know where to start. My family are going to go to an animal behaviorist after the dogs go to the vet to get there stitches taken out ( from fighting each other) . I want to know something that i could do now to help her and also what an animal behaviorist might tell me. Please help me i don't know what to do.   They are all spayed and neutered and part of the reason they are aggressive is because they used to spend a lot of time in the yard together.   Smokey can be over protective of my grandma and hubble can become jealous easily.

20090505144531AAjc2n0	Pets;Cats	I have a question about my cat?	I recently adopted a beautiful 2 year old Maine Coon cat from the Humane Society. It's my first pet in probably 4 years and my first cat since I was a teenager. I feel like an overprotective "mom". But I am worried about her. I've noticed she hasn't been drinking her water these last couple days. I mean sure maybe she is when I'm not looking. But I'm with her nearly all day. She hangs out on my sun porch a lot, sleeping in the sun. I'm worried that she'll dehydrate. So far she seems like her normal silly and playful self. She's still eating, playing and running around. But I don't see her drinking and she seems to be urinating less. I've not scooped as much out of her litter box. Am I right to be worried or am I making too much of this?

20060810124515AATLPm3	Pets;Dogs	Shih Tzu puppy having issues after being spayed...?	My mom has a 6 month old female Shih Tzu that was just spayed on Monday.  The first problem started yesterday when the puppy was crying when she was trying to have a bowel movement.  My mom looked and the puppy's anal area was swollen so my mom called the vet.  The vet said to give her some laxitive to help.  My mom bought the laxitive they suggested (not sure of the name but it is actually for cats).  The puppy is still crying when she poops and only a little bit is coming out at a time.      The other problem is that the puppy is itching like crazy.  So much that she can't walk around.  Everytime she gets up she just falls back on the ground to itch some more.  The vet said it is food allergies but that doesn't seem to make sense because the puppy is hardly eating anything.      Does anyone have any experience with this?  We don't know what to do for this poor girl and the vet is not helping any!

So her breath have been smelling bad recently i couldn't realize why, I mean I don't brush her teeth as much as I should, but I do at least 2 in 2 weeks. And I have this breath spray that cleans her mouth as well as deorderizes it.       This is even worse so when whe was panting right in front of my face, that is how i saw it, but it's not just rotton, it craked in the middle, so like the tooth is split in half, I mean she doesn't seem to have a problem with it, she eats, and chews her bones and plays all the same.       So my question is what are the Vets going to do you think? How can I prevent this from happening to my others dogs except brushing it regularly.

20061024131744AAsZ5Ut	Pets;Dogs	How do we give our dog more freedom outside his crate?	My husband and I adopted a puppy 6 weeks ago.  He's now about 8 months old and is a lab/pit mix.  He's a great dog with a charming personality and has fit in great in our household.      The problem is that we crate him while we are at work, then again while we are asleep - about 6-7 hours at a time.  He is crated during the day 4 times per week and at night 7 times per week.  I feel like this is too much time in the crate and is not fair to the little guy.      When he's not crated and we're not in the room, he tears stuff up.  He's already going to training class, but that's more like sit and stay and come commands.  We have a fenced-in yard, but is it okay to leave the dog outside for 6-7 hours?  We've tried that, but he's really wild when we get home (jumping and chewing on me).  He's not mean or aggressive, but he's a lot more calm if he's been in the crate.        How can we give him more freedom and still save our belongings?

Now, the four stripe damsel who has been there since the very beginning has never had a problem with other fish, until I put in this saddled puffer. He's tiny, and will grow some more, but about the same size as the damsel. The damsel keeps lunging at it around the face and upper torso, looks like possibly trying to nibble it. Now, I know I just introduced them, but should this behavior continue much longer? If so, should I seperate the damsel for awhile?

20090227135625AAEfMrF	Pets;Dogs	Excess skin around my dog's nails?	I believe it was last month when I was trimming my dog's nails and I noticed that there is a lot of excess skin around my dog's nails. I mean not A LOT, but enough that it folds over and creates a pocket with the nail, and I can pull it down to reveal the real base of the nail. The pocket here traps a ton of dirt, and moisture. So I clean it out every weekend, when I do his nails, but whenever I pull them back they it smells like yeast and sometimes it is inflamed. He never chews at his feet though, or walks funny, but I can tell it must be uncomfortable when they are inflamed. Is this something common that I have just never heard of, or is it a mutation that I am just going to have to keep up with on maintenence? All of his back nails have this extra skin, so I'm pretty sure it is not swollen skin - I think this is how he has always been.

20081009084722AAkTcI4	Pets;Cats	Ok - do cats actually hump things? My roommate is convinced she saw him humping - I don't believe her!?	I have a two year old, neutered, male cat.  I've seen him make himself a bed on top of a stuffed  animal (clawing at it like a blanket to make it comfortable) but never seriously humping it.  My roommate said that she saw him doing this the other day.  Then a couple of days ago I found my stuffed animal had been taken off my bed and dragged into my cats "room" (it's his play room) - neither myself nor my roommate moved it there - HE DID!      What is he doing? He is fixed and has been for awhile. I don't get it.

During the day they are kept behind an electric fence, but for the last couple of hours of daylight I usually let them out to wander about before bedtime.   I have spotted a stoat in the garden a couple of times this week.  We do have wild rabbits, rats and mice so he's probably well fed.  However, I am wary of letting the hens out in case it goes for them.    Any advice would be gratefully received.

20081009105512AAqWyid	Pets;Dogs	How do I tell which of my 4 dogs is the alpha of their "pack"?	When is comes to my partner and I we are the Alphas in our family pack, but when it comes down to our 4 dogs how do i tell who is the alpha?!       Lilly- APBT (3 years old)- very strong and protective of myself and my partner, nurtures our younger dogs and plays with the puppies and snaps at them when they hurt her. (50lbs spayed female)      Stevie- (JRT 2 years) Stevie is on top of it all, she makes sure things go her way! It is HER toy, HER momma, and HER everything. Although she does cower when the other dogs try to growl at her. (9lb spayed female)      BEEP ( mutt 5lbs 1 year) Beep is a HUGE package in a little body, She will bite and snap at any of our dogs when they get to close to something- like her toy or her mom, but on the other hand she licks the other dogs eyes and cleans their ears and checks on them if they whine or bark. (being spayed after a round of antibiotics next week- female)      Alex- (50lbs Great Dane, 16 weeks old) Alex is rough, but he doesn't know that he is a big boy, He chews on the other dogs heads, steals their toys and gets in their face. Oh and he has started to hump my APBT. (he will not be fixed until he is 10-12 months old).      So those are my kids. My partner thinks Beep is alpha- i don't think there is one. what do you think?

They hiss at each other and I'm scared they might scratch each other's eyes out, or something. My cats are really friendly if you're nice to them and all, and they play with my little dog all the time, all three cats are girls, also.

20070726204826AAiT0gw	Pets;Dogs	What Should I So?	I have two dogs- an American Eskimo Spitz named Bubbles and a Palmeranian/Shitzu named Rags. Rags unrelentengly uses the couch as her own personal toilet. We have tried everything to keep her from doing it and everything to keep her off the furniture. We've bought stuff that's suppost to make dogs stay away from it and everything imaginable. If you don't take her out often enough or if you don't catch her, she will do "it" on the couch.      How can I keep Bubbles from running away? We've had her for sometime now (at least 2 years), but given the oppurtunity she runs like the wind and she is near impossible to catch. She only runs where we take her for walks and she is scared of the woods. We have to keep leashes on both dogs (Rags will run away with her if given the chance) 24/7 to keep them from getting away. Is this just what her breed does or does she not like the house or the family? She comes back, but rolls in something nasty-smelling and comes into the yard when she tires.

I got em mid January and my rat Megavolt will run away from me every time i get near her, but she will run all over my body if I'm just sitting still. She will take treats from my hand but will bite me if I try to touch her. Not painful, just the "don't mess with me" nibbles. When I do actually pick her up her main goal is to get the hell away from me. I've never hurt her and let her out for at least an hour every day. I've got a big open room I let my 2 rats run around and play in while I just lay there and do work.  She will run all over me so I know she knows my scent by now but I still seem to scare the hell outta her. I've treated both rats the same since I got em and the cooler one is actually hanging out in my lap right now. Whats wrong with the other?

20081013105907AAnygss	Pets;Dogs	Puppy is really itchy and won't stop scratching?! ?	I have a 6 month old Pomeranian that is suddenly extremely itchy and always scratches. I feel so bad for the poor thing. The thing is, he is on flea medication, so that's ruled out. I feed Innova dry Puppy and he hasn't had problems with it. His shampoo also mosturizes as it cleans, so I doubt it's dry skin. It may be, however, since he loves to swim and jumps in the pool at least twice a week (when we let him in the backyard, it's the first thing he does). Any ideas? We just had burglars break into our home and steal near $10,000 so it's hard for me to take him to the vet if it isn't very serious and if there's an at home cure.      I heard apple cider vinegar helps, is this true?

20090307100648AAG09u0	Pets;Rodents	My dwarf hamsters seem to be ticking alot ETC.?	3 Weeks ago i bought 2 male dwarf hamsters. At the start they were squeeking and squabling alot but that has changed and they do not do that at all now. The grey one is called sweep, his very fast and energetic, he wont take no messing about and he loves to use the wheel. The cream one is called hermann, he loves to sleep and eat. He is very calm and gentle and does not exercise much. One thing i noticed is they are always making a ticking noise no matter if they are in or out the cage (they are not fighting because they do it when they are seperate. I dont know if they are ill or what but both of them do it. Also when i put my hand in the cage the grey one chases after me and trys to bite me, but when his out the cage his fine. But the cream one does not do this. Is the grey one protecting his buddy? Also what does it mean when the hamsters ears are up or down?      Thanks alot for the help :)

20090307104228AA6XxOL	Pets;Fish	Why does my things in my fish tank keep going black?	I have bought a new fish tank about 6 months ago which came with all the bits needed. ie filter, plants, toys and light. The filter lasted for about 3 months before this started to happen. I have cleaned it out, cleaning all the things inside it and also bought new filter parts for inside the filter, but over the last 2 months or so it seems to start going black a couple of days after I have cleaned it. The filter seems to be working as I can see the stream of water coming out so how do I fix this.

I have an American Staffordshire (about 60lbs) and a pit mix (50lbs).  They rode out here with me, but it was very hard on all of us! My AmStaff, Bostin, gets very carsick and I had to constantly feed him Dramamine and I felt bad "drugging" him.  Dixie has hip displaysia and the 4 day trip is hard on her.         I am wondering!  Has anyone ever flown large dogs on a plane, in the cargo space down below??  Is this safe?  I would absolutely lose it if something happenend to them.  I am just trying to do what is easiest on them. Would it be better just to drive?   I could really save the wear and tear on my car.  I have looked into shipping my car and just flying with them back.  What do you all think...good idea, or no?

20090307105852AAIiPnH	Pets;Dogs	My Doberman and my Boyfriend's pitbull keep fighting! How to stop this?	I brought my 2 year old male Doberman over to my boyfriend's house, where he owns a 2 1/2 year old male pitbull. For the most part, the pitbull is super mellow and sleeps a lot of the day. However, he is a bit spoiled and does things like: refuses to give up his toys, won't sit (even for treats), nips, barks (when he wants attention), etc...      My dobie is trained (because we've gone through training) and will sit, go to bed, heel, etc.. he's pretty obedient in the sense that he'll do whatever you tell him to because he isn't spoiled. However, his downfall is that he's super hyper and can be unruly. For instance, when he meets a new person or dog, he'll get wild and run around, jump, and lick.      The problem is: When my Dobie first met the pitbull, they wrestled (which I'm used to, since I know that dogs like to wrestle). My Dobie keeps running up to him and trying to mount him (or at least that's what it looks like), and the pitbull keeps running up to my Dobie and tries to bite his neck and ears HARD. Essentially, one keeps bothering the other, and they keep wrestling, biting, nipping, etc...      After I break up the fights, they keep running back to eachother and doing the same thing.       When I let them out into the backyard with one another, they play and don't fight (they'll even dig together), and then something happens, and they start again. Also, everytime one pees on something, the other pees on it too!       When I put the two dogs to bed, my Doberman went up to the Pitbull and "bathed" him, by cleaning his ears. I thought this meant that my Dobie was choosing to be submissive, but then when they woke up from their nap, the pitbull ran up to my dog and bit him, and they started wrestling again.      I notice that even though my dog wrestles and sometimes nips back, sometimes my dog tries to walk away from the pitbull, but the pitbull will keep biting.      I don't THINK my dog is being aggressive, since I've never seen my dog act aggressively, but I can't tell if the pitbull is being aggressive. There is a little bit of growling involved, teeth baring, and barking. I'm not crazy; I know that dogs wrestle, but after about 10 minutes of the pitbull trying to bite my dogs ears (which I do NOT want to get tattered and bloody), I begin to think they're actually going to get hurt!      What should I do to get them to give it a rest???      Note: Every time the dogs walk up to each other and start getting rowdy, my boyfriend FREAKS out. I think he thinks my Dobie is going to hurt his pitbull, but I think it's the other way around!

I've studied them for a year now and know a LOT but I don't have any experience whatsoever with actually owning them. I want any advice you can give me and that would be great. What dog shampoo do you use? How old should they be when you start training them? (I started two days after I got her :) hope that's not too soon) I've had a dog before but he's a grumpy old mutt. She is a purebred Australian Shepherd (both her parents have papers) I want to eventually breed her (but that's a long, long, long, LONG ways away) And...yeah. I think that I can't do this on my own so experienced owners please help me out here. I know that a lot of people have owned them previously any and I mean ANY information you have is perfect and would help so much. Just your experience with owning one or what they are like when they are puppies or when they grow up or what to watch for. Great things, bad habits. Everything, I need a lot of help. Thanks so much. :P       P.S. Okay we live in the mountains where there are thousands of free range cows and boars and horses. Any advice? because I've heard that they...well...heard.

20090307105732AAPOHT9	Pets;Other - Pets	New baby mice, looking for some advice?	I have a pet mouse, first of all, who is a year old (his name is Sammich Mousey/ Mr. Mousey..yes, kinda corny and weird)   Anyways, I got two new pet mice (both boys!) that are very small (1/4 the size of my older mouse) but obviously weaned. They have a seperate cage (the older one didnt like them) and they have a running wheel (they're too little to use it, though..)      But, they're both very skittish and one even bit me! The other one is very sweet but Loves to run around and such. I have cats and dogs so I need to keep them from getting loose. Plus they're in my room and could easily hide in the heating vent or a shoe or something and go missing. How can I tame them down (hopefully without getting bit again..) and, if its even possible, introduce them SLOWLY to my older mouse?      Also, I need some name ideas. Something ORIGINAL (and easy to pronounce) or something you dont hear often (meaning not :squeaky, mousey, mr. whisker, ect)

20090307111702AAyxdll	Pets;Other - Pets	Starting a Dog Kennel?	Hi There!      I would like to start a dog boarding operation   somewhere in California.  This would be located   in the country.      Are there counties which have no zoning and no   licensing?  In other words, are there counties   where you can operate completely unregulated?      I know many people board dogs and cats without   the proper licenses.  But that is not my goal.   Rather, I would like to board animals in a county   where there is no regulation at all.      Many thanks!   Ron

I'm not asking for this info because I intend to breed, I'm just trying to find out all I can about dogs. Thanks.      When will a female dog first come into season?   On what grounds should a female dog not be bred from?         Much thanks again!    ~~~
20090307112013AAPr4lu	Pets;Dogs	What about the actual breeding? I have a lot of questions ;\?	Now, before I start, do NOT hound on me about contributing to the overpopulation of hopeless dogs and blah blah blah. I'm not asking for this info because I intend to breed, I'm just trying to find out all I can about dogs. Thanks.      On what days should a female dog be bred?   What is a studmaster and when should they be used?   On what attributes should a stud be selected?   What health testing should a dam and the sire have prior to  breeding?   How old should a dog be before he is used as a stud?   What are the responsibilities of a stud dog owner?   What are important contract items to have in a breeding contract?   On what ground should a dog be neutered?   What diseases can a dog get while being bred?   When should a dog be allowed near an in-season dam?   How does the breeding actually take place?   Does there need to be a tie for breeding to have taken place?   What is AI and when should it be conducted?   Who should conduct the AI and what specific precautions should be taken?   Why is the stud dog turned during a breeding?   How many times should a female dog be bred?   Can a litter have more than one father?   Where must a female dog be kept when she is in season?      Much thanks again!    ~~~
