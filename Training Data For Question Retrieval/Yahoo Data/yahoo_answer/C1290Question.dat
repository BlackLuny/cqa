The plane doesn't have an engine, or a motor, it can only be thrown and it has to glide, it cannot be a projectile. The plane can be any size, and weight, shape, and length.      Also the plane can be made out of any material. I also have to distributed pennies anywhere on the plane, or we can put the in a bag and hang it on it, how ever we want.      So my question is...What should I use to build it, what should it look like, the measurements, and where should I put the pennies on it. I would love if it doesn't cost me little to no money.      The teacher is grading on how far it goes and how much Weight it can carry or be placed on it.      Any information would be awesome, or input.      Thanks Much!
20090309120755AAmIzg9	Science & Mathematics;Engineering	Inertial propulsion drive?	ok, so again im at work and bored. so out of bordom i stood up and started spinning my chair. However a curious thing happened as i speed up and slowed down my chair with my hand the inertia of the back rest would move the chair forward a considerable amount and since it slowed down on coming back due to friction it did not come back so to speak.      if this method were applied in space where there is no resistance a weighted wheel with a sliding weight could provide thrust in virtually any direction by controlling the speeding up and down of the wheels rotation and the placement of the sliding weight.      obviously this would have enormous benefits such as no necessary fuel. all you need is electrical power witch we would have no problem of harnessing from the sun. obviously this would not be applicable in getting us from the surface of the earth into space but once in space this could be an enormous advantage.      and there absolutly no reason as to why this should not work. the friction of the wheels on the carpet of my chair is not enough to say that the object would rebound when the wheel comes spinning back. and eve so moving the weight on the wheel toward the center as the wheel comes back from its spin would cancel this out so the object will only feel a one way push in the indicated direction. im surprised the application has not been discussed previously as i have seen no mention of such a drive previously.      Again i don't want to see people saying that this will not work because of action and reaction that the wheel would go back to its original place after a complete revolution because this can be avoided by speeding up and slowing down the wheel at precise moments during its rotation as well as sliding the weight from the edge to the center of the wheel. im doing this right now with my work chair. the question is why hasn't this been done be for?

If they were digging a little part of it and letting the rain help digging the whole that would take a long time . If they were still using wells would they machines to build the well?

My original plan was to go to medical school but now I don't really think I want to become a doctor.  I was looking at some other career paths and the one that stood out is biomedical engineering.  My question is would it be a good idea to stick with majoring in Biochem and then get my masters in Biomedical engineering, or would it be a better idea to switch my major to Bioengineering? I am not sure if grad school would look down at the fact that I am not an engineer major.  I am a second semester sophmore student, so is it too late to switch?  Thanks for your help.
20090309221851AAJmwZV	Science & Mathematics;Chemistry	What mass of Al would be needed to react with 75ml of 2molL-1 HCL?	Hey, I have a question which I'm really struggling on, I'm fine with everything else but this.       So, you have the following equation.      2AL + 6HCL ------> 2Al(OH)3 + 3H2      So, back to the title question, i know that you need a third of the aluminium, so how do you work the ml factor into that?
