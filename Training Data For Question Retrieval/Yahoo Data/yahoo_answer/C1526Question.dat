20090310023931AAHFsd1	Society & Culture;Mythology & Folklore	Have you ever just suddenly woke up and felt strange about it?	Like last night, well actually it was morning, I went to sleep around 6 AM and not too long after I fell asleep (I'd say five minutes maybe) I had just suddenly woke up and it was weird because I just felt strange, like something had woke me up. Not like pysically, but in a way just "telling me" to wake up. I can't explain it. Anyway yeah, I just felt weird, like there was something there with me, watching me and I had heard my dog growling for a couple seconds and it stopped. I can't explain how I really felt, it just felt eerie. I'm not saying it was definitely a ghost or anything, but it was just weird.

I am 17 yr old lad, in the middle of last summer, I saw mum talking to the woman next door, who she has been friends with for along time. Anyway to cut story shorter, the woman went back in and few minutes later she came out and gave mum carrier bag with something in it.       Mum brought the bag in and then put in old chest of drawers under stairs in our house.   Little while later mum went out and I looked in bag, and I found that it contained woman’s daughter who was 15 at the time 5 bikinis that I had seen her wearing.      I told girl about it and since then we have been seeing each other and I have been taking bikinis whichever one she wanted out of house so she could wear at local pool.      But now there is a problem because she wants to go swimming Thursday and when I went to get the bikini I saw.      All 5 bikinis have these triangle tops and the strings that hold them together are missing, 2 bikinis have side tying pants that had strings that could be pulled out they are also gone.   The other 3 bikinis the bottoms have the legs sewed closed.      I think mum has found out about it and put stop to me helping girl to wear the bikinis. Do you think I am right about this and what do you think in general about it.

OH! also, could u please try to answer every question? you don't have to sound smart or anything, this survey is entirely opinion based.) =D      here are the questions:      1. Do you consider yourself to be a person who's faith is a major part of your life?      2. Does the sabbath interact with any other part parts of the religion? (so, does it clash with mass times or something like that) Parts of the religion may include: Doctrinal, Emotional, Narrative, Social, Ethical, Material. (sorry if this doesn't make sense)      3.  How do your religious beliefs affect the impact that the Sabbath has on your life? (so, do you ever question this practice? Why / why not?)      4. Does the sabbath have a purpose? Do you feel that this practice is successful in achieving its purpose?      5.  Are there any parts of the sabbath that that have a stronger impact on you as a worshipper? is this impact a positive or a negative one?      6. Does the ritual clash with any other parts of your life? e.g. your social, work or family life? Does this make your life easier or harder?      7. What do you think life would be like (for you) without the sabbath? would it be better or worse?      8. Do you work during the sabbath? if yes, what are you restricted from doing at work? does this affect you or any other employees in any way? would you say that your life at work is made easier or harder because of these rules? why?   If no, there are (i think) 39 rules to follow during the sabbath, yes? which would you say is the hardest to follow? How are you and /or your family affected by these rules?      9. would you say that the sabbath is a major part of your life? why? / why not?      10. So, In general, would you say that the sabbath affects you in a positive or a negative way? (if you think both, could you please pick which side you would say if u HAD to chose one? it 's just easier for me to  form a hypothesis that way.      THANK YOU!!!    =DD (<-- hehe, double chin =p)

It is to the best of my knowledge that King Saul in the Old Testament will not be in heaven.  Yet, King David will be.  Now for my question.  King David's crime on a badness scale was far worse than what King Saul did.  Yet, King Saul didn't have the heart that David did concerning his sin.  Does this go to prove that God isn't interested in the size of your sins, but He is interested in the hearts and minds of the sinners?  Thoughts please!

20090310044936AATb4ok	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Matthew 10:11-16 . What are these scriptures trying to teach?	Matthew 10:11-16...... 11"Whatever town or village you enter, search for some worthy person there and stay at his house until you leave. 12As you enter the home, give it your greeting. 13If the home is deserving, let your peace rest on it; if it is not, let your peace return to you. 14If anyone will not welcome you or listen to your words, shake the dust off your feet when you leave that home or town. 15I tell you the truth, it will be more bearable for Sodom and Gomorrah on the day of judgment than for that town. 16I am sending you out like sheep among wolves. Therefore be as shrewd as snakes and as innocent as doves.      Would I be correct in thinking this scripture is saying , if we talk about the good news of Gods kingdom & people do not listen or are rude , we should not get upset , just keep on going ?   Have I missed the point ?   Can you explain by adding relevant scriptures or comment ?

20090310045423AABJRuN	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Senior Citizens	How well do you handle a crisis?	Are you the one that others come to for advice, or do they avoid telling you something that may upset you?   Do you find yourself more influenced by stressful situations as you age, or do you refuse to let things get you worked up?   I've known people who seem to find it difficult to relax, they are always anxious...and others who will face a major crisis saying "this too shall pass".   There are some things, like a visit to the dentist, that will make my stomach churn.  It aggravates me just to think about it.  But in times of a serious emergency, I can suddenly handle the task at hand, everything from medical emergencies to someone with a serious problem that needs to be sorted out.
20090310043459AATzsr1	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Other - Cultures & Groups	Question for Australians, do you think there will be a second apology?	Last year, Kevin Rudd apologized on behalf of past Australian governments for removing Aboriginal children from their parents. Many of these kids were being abused, as they are today.      So my question to you is this: do you think that in 50 years time, our government will be apologizing again for LEAVING the Aboriginal children to be sexually abused, deprived of education, nutrition, and medical care within their communities? Because the Government now seems too scared to do anything about it.

We both have realized that without each other we could not be on our own. We chose to leave our family homes because his father was a raging alcoholic and my mother is mentally abusive, was physically abusive when i was younger. i work full time as a receptionist at 11/hr my boyfriend makes 13/hr as a cook we have a roommate to help with the bills but we are not saving any money. which is really scary. I want a better life for me and i know that i am the only person who can give myself that, i feel emotionally exhausted because there have been a lot of major tragedies that happened earlier in my life. I don't know were to begin and who to turn to, i don't even know what i want to do as a career, but being able to financially support myself independently is my #1 priority. I went to school to be an esthetician but my state doesn't have a lot of full time opportunity for the job and that is why i am stuck in a reception job still paying a school loan. I did get my diploma but i didn't take a SAT because my parents convinced me that it wouldn't do me any good since i am not that smart. I am so depressed i need to pick myself up badly....... any help or direction would be appreciated

20090310052817AAd3oF9	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Why are so many Christians against the idea of evolution?	I am a Christian and I pay little or no attention to the book of Genesis. I think it is fairly obvious that evolution is real. Even though it is far from totally understood I think that modern science is on the right track. Though I believe that God has briefly revealed himself to mankind, the story of Adam and Eve has absolutely no bearing on my faith whatsoever.      Its my view that a few misinterpretations in the bible do not not negate its overall relevance, but some Christians seem to act as those if you don't take the entire bible literally you are some sort of heretic.        I think that if more Christians would take this approach they would find much more success in the modern world.      What say you?

In English most nouns are neuter and most are pluralized with the addition of "s".  I remember that French also has a straightforward way of pluralizing.      So, why is German so complex in this regard?  How did all the gender rules emerge in the first place?  How did all the rules for making plurals come about?

Okay I am not trying to be difficult like I said I am just a seeker with lots of questions that most christians and the bible cannot answer. Why is it any more unreasonable to believe there is a goddess and god than to believe there is one God in Three male personalities.?      Could the creator be a Goddess? Is it possible that the Goddess was dormant knowing nothing then awoke and became aware of herself then desired to be so she exploded causing the big bang and thus creation and creating the god separate from herself then she descended to the earth and created all that is.Why is that any more unbelievable than the Christian version of God and creation. I do not know if I got the story 100 percent correct but a pagan told me this view of creation explaining how the goddess and god and us came into being. Look I am trying to see things how Christians see them but I cannot blindly accept that without explanation of my questions. I am told to just blindly believe without questioning. To accept what Christians say without proof.
20090310042010AAKP30R	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Religious question.Who created God?	I have been browsing the questions and one made the argument I have seen many times. the fact of evolution raises the question who gave creatures the ability to evolve? The big bang what blew up and who caused it? Well Who created God? If everything has a creator who created God. How did God come to be. The bible says God has always been is not sufficient answer because if God has already been then the earth and the Universe could have always been. It is no more unbelievable then God has always been.      Okay I attend church and am not really an atheist but I do question the things I am taught. I don't accept teachings blindly. Yes, I stay in trouble with the pastor, he wishes I would leave.

20090225085120AAyfpaj	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Which bible is referred to when people say it is perfect and inerrant?	I'm just curious about this, because I see so many answers here that say the bible is perfect, inerrant, and that every word is literally correct and true.  Which version of the bible are they referring to?  Here are a few to choose from:   New American Standard version   GOD'S WORD Translation   King James Version   American King James Version   American Standard Version   Douay-Rheims Bible   Darby Bible Translation   English Revised Version   Webster's Bible Translation   World English Bible   Young's Literal Translation   Joseph Smith's Inspired Version   New World Translation (Jehovah's Witnesses)   The Jerusalem Bible   The New Jerusalem Bible   The Revised Standard Version Catholic Edition      (and those are just a *few* of the English-language versions -- there are thousands more in both English and other languages)      See, my problem is that none of those different English versions agree on things.  They all use different words -- so how can every word be literally true?  They have different meanings for many "important" bible verses -- so which one is inerrant?      It's all so confusing...

20090309155322AAlYRNp	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Question About Jesus' Divinity & Christianity?	I am a non-denominational Christian, and for a long time I have been studying the issue of "Is Jesus God, the Son of God, the Messiah, etc."      One thing I have noticed is that this is a "HOT" issue, and some Christians say you must believe that "JESUS IS GOD" in order to be called a Christian.      My question is this: Why can't we just stick exclusively to the bible, and say Jesus was the son of God, and the messiah, and leave it at that???      Jesus never says, "I am God" nor did he say, "You Must Believe I am God." Never is that a big deal. I know some who think Jesus is God will point to some verses in John, etc. But that still doesn't say Jesus is God, and could be interepreted other ways.      So why can't there be more unity? Why can't we just stick with the bible only and not speculate about whether he was/is God??      All the bible says is we have to believe in Jesus, not that we have to believe Jesus is God.      What are your thoughts??

20090309154931AAKykg6	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Do you think the "atheists hate God" argument is a little TOO crazy?	When I see someone saying that atheists "hate God" it gets me to thinking that the speaker is absorbed in a mindset that I am probably better off not even fully knowing about.      Or sometimes it's phrased as "you just hate God that's your problem."   Oh my.   Again, they are somewhere I am glad not to be, where that is.      I can see the "why not just try to believe" argument(the road to Hell is paved with good intentions) but to accuse non-theists of "hating God" is a part of this site's open secret that those who say that are so wrong, and so abusive, that all we are ever going to do is go our separate ways and secretly know that we all know it shoots down the God-argument altogether.        I do not hate God or people who claim to believe in a God. What I hate is they way theocracy and religious absolutism harms human life and creates war and other irrationalities.

20090225090859AAqkA6q	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	Would you get with the opposite gender for a million dollars?	I've often heard the question posed to hetrosexual guys, about getting with another guy for a certain amount of money. Often times, the answer is no. I personally believe that if the question was "would you let a guy... " rather than "would you suck a guy's... " that more people would admit to it. And then there may actually be people who would never do things for money period.       Anyway, I wonder if gay men would have the same or similar response of "hell no, not ever" if the question was posed to them of getting with a woman for a million dollars?      I'm catagorial bi (I'm sure there is another word for it, but I don't know it), meaning that I have a desire for women and enjoy them sexually, but can't and/or won't become emotionally attached. I'm sure some would consider me a whore- someone who only wants someone else for sex. So, it would be no problem for me to be sexual with the same gender and I wouldn't need someone to offer me a million dollars to do it. But, for someone who absolutely has no sexual interest in their opposite gender, I dunno. Would you do it?       This is a question for fun, by the way. No offense is intended to anyone. I know how sensitive some folks can get.. :-)

It seems as though most girls will say personality matters, but if someone who is taller, muscular, and more handsome comes along they grab their attention right away.  This is based on personal experiences not only with me, but my friends also.  I am on the shorter and skinnier side so this might be a problem for me in the future if all girls are this shallow.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Coach Marcus Borden used to bow his head and drop to one knee when his football team prayed. But the Supreme Court on Monday ended the practice when it refused to hear the high school coach's appeal of a school district ban on employees joining a student-led prayer.      The decision on the case from New Jersey could add another restriction on prayer in schools, advocates said.      "We've become so politically correct in terms of how we deal with religion that it's being pretty severely limited in schools right now, and individuals suffer," said John W. Whitehead, president of The Rutherford Institute, a civil liberties organization that focuses on First Amendment and religious freedom issues.       http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/arti...

So this is simply a question of right or wrong:      For those who believe in pro life under all and any circumstance; If a woman finds she has an ectopic pregnancy (where the cells implant outside of the uterus) is it morally wrong to take the steps that are taken by medical professionals.  Because a fetus can not sustain outside of the uterus, and internal bleeding could kill the mother, it is necessary to either give medication to terminate, or surgically remove said (hopefully zygote if caught early enough)  So if neither baby or mother could survive, is it right to take those steps?  What are your thoughts?

20090309161813AAO4jSN	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Has the US Republican Party’s use of religion to win elections changed American religion itself?	The US Republican Party hasn’t always been like this; I just learned, thanks to all the wise people out there in Yahoo! Answers land, that religious people used to vote Democrat. What are now ‘red states’ used to be ‘blue states’ and vice versa. But some time, maybe during the second half of the 20th century, the roles and the colors were swapped. With this change, there also came a change in the way religion was used to get people to vote for a particular political party. For whatever reason, the Republican Party was selected by those in society with influence over hordes of religious conservatives who will vote the way their church tells them to.       It seems to me like a deal was struck between the religious alpha males and the Republican Party. The religious alpha males went to the Republican Party and said, “Ok, we can get you into to power if you promise to restrict abortion rights, make life difficult for gays and do what you can to stop evolution being taught in the classroom; do we have a deal?” The Republican Party, greedy for power, said, “Deal!” But with this deal and with this mixing of politics and religion, a new beast has emerged; a beast that is neither religion nor politics but a repulsive combination of the two. This beast is the US Republican Party of the modern era. The face of Bill O’Reilly and the voice of Rush Limbaugh are the latest representatives of the beast and it dangles political puppets like Sarah Palin and Bobby Jindall on strings.      Sorry, I got a bit carried away there; but do you think this has what’s happened? Do you think that the US Republican Party and US religion both died some time in the second half of the 20th century and their corpses were reanimated and combined into a new beast?

John 3:16 says that "For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life." - NIV        Excuse me if i'm wrong, but if you exist in eternal torments for doing wrong, then you are Living, right? But according to the scripture life is a reward only of those who believe and show faith in Jesus. So, then. The punishment for not believing in him is to "perish" and cannot be hellfire, since that would mean living forever. Does this logic sound reasonable to anyone else?

So if you wanted to pick me up, wouldn't you pretend to be interested in Jesus just to get to know me better? But if a man was witnessing to you on the streets, you probably know he is really just witnessing to you, a man, on the streets. Doubtful you would think he was coming on to you. So in generality, among strangers, do you think it best for women to witness to women, and men to men. Obviously there are always exceptions. But does the sex difference get in the way? Or is it a viable tool?

Hes one of those people who 'should' be christian.      His reasoning is basically 'There's no proof of Jesus'      And I said ' Jesus WAS a real person, i mean asides from the bible there are historical documents about him'      He was a bit shocked to hear that (especially from me, who constantly makes jokes about his religion) and He  seemed to 'reconsider'      So anyway, what could i do to make him regain his faith? I knowbelievingg in a higher power is nonsense, but i think he would be better of. You know, whats the point of christmas is there no Santa to bring you prezzies?

I'm fairly new to Scientology and my ex boyfriend has been a Scientologist all his life.    Recently we ran into problems that cannot be resolved between us even though I had tried. Now it has come down to him withholding my books so I cannot be on course. He is also on course and I think it is only fair that his course be put on hold until I can be back on course as he is my block.    I know I can write him up for being out of ethics but I don't want to get him into trouble. I just want my books back.     First I talked to a woman from Flag, she was helping but became friends with my ex and due to his extreme lies about me to everyone she will no longer be in comm with me. Now I am talking with a man who for the past month, maybe longer has been claiming to be getting my books. He has given excuses and I have given a solution to each. He claims he cannot get in comm with my ex, so I gave him three numbers where he can easily get my ex's phone number to get in comm.    What can be done?    Thank You for answering! :)

20090309161457AAqG1xc	Society & Culture;Etiquette	How should I deal with this situation....he has a girlfriend....but? (Please serious answers - I need HELP)?	I met this guy at work today. First day. We were both trainees so we were in training class together all day. We had to do a meet and greet with someone in the class he and I automatically turned to each other. When we talked we automatically clicked. We had so much in common. Come lunch time, I got into the lunch room first and sat down by myself. He walked over and sat down with me. We had lunch together, talked, and found we had even more in common. We then went outside to a break area and talked. We had so much incredible chemistry and we would just look at each other and smile and giggle. It was too perfect. Then he got a text on his phone. He then said "Uhhh" and looked kinda aggravated and I said "Girlfriend?" and he said "yea". He told me they'd been together 3 months, and that they're a really lovey dovey couple, that it annoys people. I didn't understand why he would act so interested in me, making me believe he'd ask me out any second, when he had a girlfriend. But, break time was just about over so we went inside. Come to our second break, I went outside first and sat down. He talked to one group of people for a minute or two, then came over and sat down with me. He got out his phone and showed me a picture of an ultrasound. I asked him what it was, and he said his girlfriend just sent him that. I asked him if it was his, and he said that he got with her right after she broke up with her boyfriend, and that they've been together 3 months and she just recently found out she was pregnant, so they're not sure who's it is. I asked what they were gonna do, and he said he wasn't sure. The thing is, he continued to look at me that same way he did when I didn't know he had a girlfriend. He'd just look at me with those eyes like he was falling for me, and he would just stare into my eyes for about 5 seconds and smile. It was so obvious to me that we had amazing chemistry, almost like a love at first sight connection, just completely unreal unlike anything I've ever experienced. He and I talked and tomorrow we're gonna bring music we want to share with each other during break. I'm just not sure how to react to this situation, if I should still flirt, if I should say something, or what. What do you suggest. I'm at a total loss here. No clue what to do.   It's just everytime he got the oppurtunity, he'd walk next to me, sit next to me, talk to me, smile at me, stare at me, and he completely knocked me off my feet. We flirted like crazy and instantly connected. I want to say something, but don't want to cross the line and offend his girlfriend.

If all the lesbians were popping out babies left and right and all the gay guys were spreading their seed in countless women's gardens? The whole world would look like Tokyo or Mumbai. Is that what you biggots and conservative fascists want? You want us to be so overpopulated that every country has to enforce a child quota like China? You want the world to be so overpopulated that we have to exterminate hundreds of billions of infants every day so that we won't run out of resources? I don't get how you can bash homosexuality with one hand and be pro life with the other. Homosexuality helps control the population so we don't have to have every street in the world flooding with infant blood.
20090227145255AAEO5mf	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	The in-laws FRIENDS (not your typical question)-I will answer you Qs since mine is long.?	So, I'm lucky that for ONCE in my life I can say that I love my partners parents. They are AWESOME people. However, I can't stand all of their friends. They are just so nosy and the women are bitchy etc.      His parents are from South America and hang out with all South Americans. They all have parties at each others house and go out amongst each other all the time. They are very social.      The one thing is...his Mom doesn't know how to stop being friends with people she truly doesnt like..it's like she is too easygoing. Like one of her friends came over and said in front of my man " Oh, weren't you supposed to go out with my daughter?"..this broad is always staring me up and down too. His mom just clenched her teeth and shot us a nervous grin. But yet, she still can't decline hanging out with this woman.       THen she has another friend that is 33. She lives three streets down from his Mom. She has two kids..but she is prettier and younger..however she still possesses that bitchy HS attitude and "speaks her mind" at anyones expense. She is self righteous..and lately she thinks she can start talking to me condescendingly. She does little things that don't stand out..but are degrading..." Here do you wanna hold my purse?"... Etc. We were all at an amusement park and I said gosh I burnt and she said " That's because you're so white". That was the first time I EVER met her and the FIRST words out of her mouth. I was thinking..ok yeah, I'm white..but who the hell do you think you are? She is the type of woman who also giggles and likes it when guys look at her and if I want to go somewhere quickly she acts like I am retarded and rushing..she tries to talk down to me like it annoys her that I'm not going her pace. (We worked together and I am telling her tonight that I'm not able to continue working there).      How do you deal with this? It's like she knows she can say whatever she wants because if  I open my mouth..then it's gonna create drama for the whole family.. I love my parent in laws..but I can't stand all of their nosy and gossipy friends. Their friends are used to kind of getting over on my parent in laws bc they are so nice..but then it's like they think they can throw me in that category..like wtf???? I'm not gonna be talked down to..but I also don't want it to seem like I am starting a big drama circle..and believe me..these people and DRAMA (not the parents the friends)      Thanks for reading. I will answer your questions as well if you can give advice.

I just read an article about finding more Earth like planets throughout the Universe. Now I am just doing a what if. If you learned of Intelligent life outside of our own world,  would this change your current belief of the Book of Genesis?      This is a question aimed at those who are Christian and do believe. Athiests and Non-believers need not reply. Those of a different faith are welcome to reply though. I would find it interesting how your own beliefs would be affected as well.

20090227145445AAQuYzV	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	Anyone know any songs about falling in love with someone innocent/misunderstood?	Alright, I need songs I can listen to, ones I can relate with. Here's my situation. See if you know any songs that sound like this.         I hate love type things, so no mushy love song type crap. But I'm in love with this boy who is very misunderstood. I seem to be the only one who sees wh he truly is. He's very shy, and innocent and very much like a little boy. He's lonely and I'm kind of the older girl type that wants to break through his shell and save him from people's evil ways.      He's had a bad childhood, and is very isolated. I want to rescue him. I've never really seen guys before. I'm usually the kind of girl who lets a guy take me out and never see them again so it's so weird I've actually fallen in love.      My personality is like the girl in the click 5 song- JUST THE GIRL.   Mysterious, kind of cruel towards men, but the kind of boy like him always seems to fall for because she's too much to handle. I put that in there so no one requests a song about a sweet, girl next door type and a guy like that.         If nothing comes to mind a cool love songs, with non-cliche lyrics will work too.

20090227150554AA6Y0RA	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	How does one distinguish illusion from truth in this world, we all have a questioning, an unfinished puzzle..?	So, we can all just wonder about death, but the fact is, not even if someone tells us they saw Jesus, or had a near death experience, we are still left with doubt... If God is real, he's probably too busy watching watching the other billions of people on the planet than to appear to me, but then again, he's everywhere right? Nah, I don't think I believe in god... Who knows, though what if there were other intelligent lifeforms in the universe more evolved than ourselves, would we view them as gods? And where will worship ultimately lead us but into slavery... Even if you didn't worship a "god", you could still be their friend, or not if you didn't choose to, but what kind of being would demand worship? By demanding this, this being would create a rebellious spirit among us and cause us to be curious of other possibilities... It seems the only way for us to be happy is to be more free, not just religion wise, but also how we live our lives... Like how we have ridiculous laws in place, but they don't stop people, they make them either afraid or rebellious, two negatives don't make a positive... I have never seen a third eye vision either, or had any of that stuff, but for what it's worth, once I am sure I have heard something ghostly, like a laughing and/or screaming inside my head after having four dreams in a row about what is commonly called a banshee, not that anyone died that I know of but it certainly gave me the sense that there's more to the world than meets the eye. I don't expect you to believe this, as long as you have doubt, and a wise person doubts often, you will keep searching. If religious peoples faith was very strong, they wouldn't be asking questions about god, unless it was to do with scripture and reference to the bible.

20090227145336AAT9pXD	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	I'm in love with a straight girl...?	I love her so much it hurts. It's been about seven months, and I can't get her out of my head. I know I think about her at least once every day. The problem is she's straight. I know this because she's said it on more than one occasion [not in reference to me or anything]. I respect this about her, so I don't tell her that I like her that way, but I do show affection for her and I'd do anything for her without hesitation. Usually when I get crushes on straight girls or gay guys, it fades over time because they don't reciprocate that feeling. However, this hasn't faded over time and I don't think I can get over it. I think she might just be saying she's straight because she's Christian, but that's not likely. I guess my question is the generic: What should I do? I want her so badly, but it'll never happen, and I can't just get over it.

Negatives = scrutinizing some of your moves, trying to challenge what you say for accuracy, expecting you to do good in school as well and expecting you to spend some time with her (see her at least 5 times a week).      2. Spanish Girl (Puerto Rican) with Black hair, brown eyes, pale skin, nice butt, short (about 5"2 lets say), plans on going to college, intelligent and is willing to help you in some school work.   Negatives = New York attitude (the I am better than everyone else attitude), is conceited, gets violent at times, has a ghetto demeanor and hangs out some people who can get her and you in trouble with the law.      What do you choose?      Also I am actually experimenting something with this question, I will reveal on additional details what I am experimenting when I get some answers.

NOTHING      I'm Poor (i have nothing, and I am unloading trucks at grocery store named Kroger for a job right now) and I don't see any sign of this "White Privilege" thing i hear people talking about on the news. I'm still waiting for it though.      : (

20090227145814AAAQRYx	Society & Culture;Holidays;Valentine's Day	My boyfriend barley acknowledged me on valentines day?	Ive never cared for this "holiday" considering ive never had anyone to share it with. i finally did and thought it would be the greatest day..but it was actually worst than when i spent it alone. my boyfriend of 10 months didnt do anything for me on valentines. and it was our very first valentines together. i dont really care about gifts or flowers but its really just the thought that counts..you know? a simple home made card would have made me soo happy. we spent the friday before valentines together because i worked on sat and he went to go volunteer. i got him a whole bunch of stuff that reminded me of him. i spent most of thursday walking around picking things out for him because i wanted to and enjoyed it. and on the day of valentines he barley even texted me. i was working and i texted him 'happy valentines' and he finally texted me the same thing back. which made me really sad..cuz i had to say it first. its just the little things. i thought maybe that monday he would surprise me or something since he didnt have work or school..but he didnt. so i confronted him about it and told him how it made me really sad. i started crying and he kinda just sat there with a sad look on his face and said sorry. he says hes really busy with school work volunteering. but im busy with life too. i just dont know what to do. its stupid that this is such a big deal to me but i cant help but get really sad when i think about it. am i making too big of a deal out of this? what should i do?

What do you think about it? its the jail system, they cant afford having emty cells because that will leave many investers broke, thats why they keep inventing dumb new laws, its just one big buisness, for examples i saw a show on some stupid laws i dont know if there enforced but like i think its in virgina its illegal to go to school with onion breath all this is a form of modern day slavery,, And when an inmate is offered wether to work for a lil pay or sit all day in a cell that is basiccly slavery paying some one like 25 cents an hour thats slave labor,, and remember the inmate labor was started right after the civil war when they got rid of slavery, so this is the new way and its been under wraps

Ok, so my 16 year old brother's being skipping a lot of school recently and taking drugs, drinking too much etc. It's all a bit scary.      Yesterday my mum said he was going to tell her what was wrong, what had happened, but then he chickened out at the last minute and decided not to tell. But today he did tell her.      I told her not to tell me, because I would be upset if she told him something like that about me. But I'm worried and I want to know what's wrong. She said "It will have to come out in the open anyway" and that I would find out sooner or later, and "It's not a bad thing".      The only thing I can think of is that he's gay, but he seems really straight to me...

As I mentioned, we try to be kind neighbors to everyone, but my husband and I can't even sit outside and have a cup of coffee without this neighbor spotting us and here he comes. In his mind, he is the only one who has anything to say, he monopolizes every conversation. We don't have money to put up a fix all the way around our place. Any suggestions? He doesn't have many friends because he is so annoying to everyone. What would you do? If we are building something or working, he comments on how he would do it would work so much better.

20090227145612AA96WU7	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Science explains the "hows" but not the "whys", should that means then that reliance on science for truth is?	not sufficient?      People go about thinking that they have figured out everything about the world already or figured out a lot just because they understood the mechanism of how the world operates, but they never come about to question themselves of "Why?" It operates the way it does. Science does not answer such questions, but it leaves a space for eternal curiosity unreached by science, and philosophy cannot but reach an assumption with no experimental confirmation.      When people in the past used this form of thinking, when they used to give out questions in a form of "Why?", they always ended up attributing the causes of phenomenas to a divine being or supernatural causes, and I assume that it should be the case even now. "Why?" holds in itself an element of something unknown and will always be so. You may know about evolution, but you may not know why evolution occurred, that is an example.        Then why reject God for science, when one cannot even answer the question "Why?".

An irate Jehovah's Witness asked this when answering a question today. I thought this was such a good question, I've taken the liberty of asking it myself and trust the JW concerned will take that as a compliment (which it is intended to be - it's one of the best questions I've seen a JW ask in years.)      I know a good answer to it myself, but I'd like to give you the pleasure of pointing out why Christian people need to know the origins and track-record of their denomination, as to whether they are solidly based on 1st century Christian belief or the enthusiasms of individuals pursuing their own religious hobby-horses. Anyone aware of Protestant obsession with working out the date for Jesus' return in the 19th century will be well placed to answer this question. So would anyone aware of who was mainly behind a new JW doctrine on blood that appeared in the late 1940s. But even if you know nothing about that, yet are alert to the dangers of keeping followers' eyes fixed on the future in order to distract them from mistakes in the past, please add your contribution. All JWs deserve a good answer to this important question.

20090309120830AAxbMnF	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	I have some questions for Christians. Christians, can you refute/explain them one by one?	1) Why did Tertullian say Jesus was born in the 41st year of Augustus but Jerome says the 42nd?    Tertullian, who was an Early Church Father and apologist, contradicts Jerome by writing that Jesus was born in the 41st year of Augustus, the exact year you would arrive at if you moved approximately thirty years ahead of 29 AD, where you would arrive at 1 BC: seven years before the taxation and census, and at least one, if not three years, after the death of Herod the Great. But then he goes on to say that he suffered in the 15th year of Tiberius! This would mean that he didn’t have a three-year ministry as the Gospel of John states, but less than twelve months.      2) Why didn’t Theophilus mention anyone of the 1st century named Jesus?   Theophilus never mentioned anyone of the 1st century called Jesus.   In book II:2, he doesn’t say that the gospels were divinely inspired.   Justin didn’t know Paul’s teachings; not even his first writing, which the Church says is 1 Corinthians. He never says that we’re going to be resurrected because Jesus was.   Nothing of the sort is found in his writings at all.      3) Eusebius: writings of the Therapeuts were the gospels?   that the ancient writings of the Therapeuts were the Gospels.      He said that Mark, after writing the gospel, founded churches in Alexandria, and that Philo came upon these people and was so impressed by the way they lived that he decided to write about them.   In chapter 17, Eusebius makes the point that Philo had become acquainted with Peter while he was preaching in Rome. And this is the teaching of the history books that Eusebius wrote; that Peter and Paul both went to Rome and founded the Christian Church there.      Philo met Peter in Rome and states that it was some years after that time that Philo decided to write this book (The contemplative Life) which was about the early Christians in Egypt.       Church History of Eusebius, Book II Chapter 17:      1  It is also said that Philo in the reign of Claudius became acquainted at Rome with Peter, who was then preaching there. Nor is this indeed improbable, for the work of which we have spoken, and which was composed by him some years later, clearly contains those rules of the Church which are even to this day observed among us.      4) Why did Irenaeus say Papias was a hearer of the Apostle John when it was just John the Presbyter?   Irenaeus talks of Papias being a hearer of John, though Papias never said he heard or knew John. It turns out that the John he did know was not the apostle John. It was something called John the presbyter.      Why would the Holy Spirit inspire Irenaeus to lie?      5) Why did Irenaeus say the Church was founded in Rome when 1st epistles was apparently written to Christians already there?   Irenaeus stated that the Catholic Church was founded at Rome by Peter and Paul, and we know, just by reading the epistle to the Romans, that Paul did not found the Church at Rome because he is writing to a group of Christians that are already at the Church in Rome and, in the 1st Epistles, he says that he hopes to visit them and wants to go and help them become established, but he was always prevented from going, and if we trust what we read in the Book of Acts, he lived his life in Rome in chains because he wanted his case to be heard by Caesar Nero.      6)    How could Mark have remembered everything Peter relayed to him except the virgin birth, resurrection and ascension? Forgot, or wasn’t decided by God.   The Gospel of Mark says nothing about the virgin birth, the resurrection or the ascension of Jesus.   1 Peter says that Jesus was resurrected, yet Papias said that Mark was careful not to leave out any of Peter's teachings. This is the man Irenaeus and Eusebius used to testify who wrote the gospels.   This is what he says in regards to the Gospel of Mark:      Mark, having become Peter’s interpreter, wrote down accurately whatever he remembered of what was said or done by the Lord, however not in order.      So he’s writing from memory what Peter said. He’s not writing in exact order.    He’s trying to remember everything that Peter said because he took special care not to omit everything. If this is true, then let’s look at Mark’s gospel: we find no virgin birth, no appearances after his resurrection, and no ascension into heaven.      8) Why didn’t Josephus know of the Septuagint?   Although we’re told that he was probably very well educated, for some reason Josephus, writing his Antiquities of approximately 94 of the Current Era (the latter part of the 1st century), doesn’t know anything about the Septuagint, and this is after the destruction of Jerusalem in 70 AD.      In the preface to his book Antiquities of the Jews, he states that this is one of the reasons why he is writing this particular book. He is urging people to do this because people are not only curious about this war that his people had with the Romans, but were very interested in the history that had led up to this and they wanted to know the

20090309171427AAJDP5z	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Other - Cultures & Groups	Question for American Indians?	Because I'm black/native, 50/50, half-n-half, breed, whatever little cute term you wanna call me, am I (and people like me) more prone to religious stereotypes than people of predominately black or predominately native ancestry?      Case in point-Because I'm of African descent, people automatically assume that I'm supposed to be this liberal type who gets "happy" and runs around the church at the drop of a dime praising Jesus. Because I'm of Native descent, people automatically assumed that I'm supposed to be, as one individual stated, "worshiping fire, piercing my chest, and smoking peyote and marijuana out a piece pipe." I swear....      Hell, I am constantly berated, and I don't even think I was raised in a household which most natives would consider to be the "bad" form of Christianity. I was raised in a BAPTIST household. When I attend church, the choir may sing "Follow the Drinking Gourd"....and I seriously doubt that's a song Europeans sang to my indigenous ancestors. That song was a code that slaves devised for themselves when they were traveling to the north for freedom. If any modern whites sing "FtGG," I would be very shocked indeed."  My black ancestors were involuntarily dragged from Africa and African tribal religions were STRIPPED. That too is religious genocide.      Sadly enough, I think I get more criticism from natives than blacks. I've had to reiterate the point time and time again that just because my deceased grandparents were traditional and my parents are Christian, I am not inherently, spiritually pure.

20090309171427AAv9f6n	Society & Culture;Etiquette	When asked, "You alright?", what do you reply?	I've recently moved to the UK from California, and people here seem to ask "You ok?" or "You alright?" indifferently as if they don't really care, and it feels so awkward because I don't know what they expect for an answer. From experience, it seems like if reply with "Yes" or "I'm fine, and you?" or "Yes, how are you?" they don't say anything back. Help the native-English speaking foreigner fit in this (cold) English society, no offence. Thanks a million!

There's no avoiding duality, but to transcend it one must see that both halves are by necessity part of each other and together are another thing entirely.

20090309171056AAp2FPA	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	Why do people think that Gays and Lesbians shouldn't be parents?	If anything, I think that Gays and Lesbians would make better parents simply because when they have children, they make the conscious choice that they're at a place in their lives where they are ready for the responsibility of parenthood. When Gays and Lesbians have children, they are ready. There's no chance of being "knocked up" and stuck with a child they were never ready for. Straight people can have unexpected pregnancies. Gays and Lesbians don't. Children of Gays and Lesbians also are far less likely to be raised as prejudiced bigots.

I refer to the numerous accounts of hearing the voice of God or actually seeing him, like in a near death experience. My friend’s boyfriend saw an angel on the altar of our parish, one Sunday. There have been saints that received heavenly visions. In the Old Testament, the patriarchs and prophets had conversations with God and angels.

20090309172557AAKTub6	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Should churches be taxed? How can you be so sure that they are not just using you?	Churches should not be taxed on the contributions they make to the city in feeding the homeless, day care, etc. But what about the other costs associated with using non-taxable donations for the payroll of its staff?!      Consider that a married pastor couple that runs a local church in my SMALL (pop. +/- 35,000) town have turned their eyesore next to the freeway into a $16,000,000 legacy.       They pay themsevles and their "partner" pastor couple their diluted subjective concept of a "fair" income of $45,000 each. They also have 6 office workers at the church who earn about $20,000 each. Just there we are at $300,000 of tax free donations that go to support their (seemingly modest if you were a member) lifestyle and excellent retirement!      I know the responce of many of you will be that your own church is not like that...If you were a member of this church you would say the same exact thing because they all seem (not to be an elitist) to have modest homes, modest cars, old outdated clothes, absolutely no jewelry, and bad haircuts while in reality they each have bank accounts large enough (7 figures per couple!!) to be proud of.       In this case if you assume that each of their 175 +/- members makes a pre-tax weekly income of $350 and they tithe 10% ($35) thats a weekly income of 6125+/- or a yearly income of $288000 tax free. How is any of this going towards (this is what they say it goes to WITH "PROOF") chairty?!      How can you be so sure that your churches are not being run like this?! How can you be so sure that they are not just using you for the wonderful income, the ability to control your life, and the lifelong position of respect and authority of its followers?       I know another responce will be that you know this can't happen because you get such a wonderful feeling there and around the people. Remember that Hitler used religion, fear, and hatred hand in hand with the feeling people got being lost in the masses and being dictated to at his rallies...      Churches should be taxed on its income that is not DIRECTLY proven to be benefiting the community. How do you know that your church leaders (devout, loving, and learned they may be) are laughing all the way to the bank?       http://www.infidels.org/library/historic...

Yahoo answers told me my response was a hate crime.      Since when was telling the world that there are unfair discipline practices in schools towards African Americans a hate crime?

20090309113024AA2ZD9a	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	Why does it seem criminals especially really bad ones get more rights then victims?	Why does it seem like criminals especially violent & repeater ones get more rights then their victims. A rape victim at best sees her attack her go to jail a place he's likely been before. A murder gets 3 meals & shelter for the rest of his life while the victims family lose the victim & who knows what things the victim could have done if given a chance. A guy killed then beheaded & later ate some random stranger on a bus in canada & yet the victims family loses their son who maybe someday would have married had a family of his own who knows maybe even cure cancer but the system let the killer go to a mental ward for easy care & who could get out pretty much any time after a yearly review unlike the victim who couldnt come back from being killed especially after being cut up & eatten. What happened to an eye for an eye. A woman burned & blinded by acid for going to school is called names even by the west because she wants the attacker to be blinded with acid. If you rob you should lose a hand or have to return the property & pay the court & victim a fair value of restitution in order to get out of it or jail. Doing that would help make everyone feel justified while still being civil & fare. They use to put people like pirates & other lesser criminals in cages outside so they could die of many causes one of which being eatten & attacked by birds but we can't do that do murderers or serial rapest or child molestors. Rape victims & molestation victims don't just get better in 20 years even if by some miracle their attacker gets that long which they don't. A rapist or molestor might get 5 -10 years even if they did it before but the victim suffers for life & in so many different ways especially if the victim was young. A burgler sued someone he broke into because he cut his hand on their window & another sued & got a like a million dollars from his victim because he was trapped accidently in the garage for a weekend & ate dog food. How is that fair even if nothing was taken?

20090309123629AA2SCtn	Society & Culture;Etiquette	Do you think this is really rude?	First of all my sister cut me off 4 years ago because i refused to comply with her ever demand, she had one of her daughter in laws leave me a message reading off all the horrible things i have done like not calling her husband for his 51st bday. She told me never to call them again. So i didnt, i also didnt contact me sister, with the common sense that she was behind the call. Well my sister, my brother, my 3 nephews have not contacted me since that message at all,      One of my other nephews wives was calling me and talking but she made believe she knew nothing about what was happening. I thought maybe shes trying to make amends, but this went on for 2 years, where she calls , asks personal questions and thats it, when i asked to speak to my nephew she says hes not there.... Also she has been verbally abusive to my daughter in the past and basically threw me out of her house when i visited for one day..      For the past 2 years shes been leaving messages, i dont respond, she continues to leave them, about once every two months.   Is this really rude and harrassment at this point?      In her last message she says "gee i havent heard from you in so long"   its very phoney, shes called about 20 times, i dont respond, she knows my own flesh and blood cut me off so why would i talk to her?   Shes just going to ask personal questions and make believe she knows nothing

Can you find any mistakes?      Charles I: an absolute King.   When James I died, Charles I came to the throne. He was in the tradition of absolute monarchs in which the king made and administered lows without the parliament authorization. The situation become unsustainable. The wealth of the nation was not in nobility’s hands, but in landed gentry’s and professional people’s ones, they were the new middle class. There were also a conflict since the Elizabethan Age, between Catholics and Protestants. In Charles’ first parliament there were 100 lords in the upper house and 500 in the Commons, three-quartes  of whom were Puritans. The parliament had the control of finance. In the 1628, with the petition of right Charles’ power was limitated, and the king could not imposed taxes without the parliament authorization. When Charles asks money to the parliament, this refuse to gave him it and so Charles abolished parliament. But in 1640 Charles called the parliament to control a religious rebellion in Scotland, it was called short parliament, because he lasted only three weeks. After he called again the parliament, called long parliament, in which there was Oliver Cromwell.

For example: I want to do really well at school like most others, yet I see people who aren't exactly nice but, yet they do better. It feels like it ignores some natural unwritten law in which the good do well and the bad well, only in their eyes do well.      Secondly: I really fancy this girl, if we were to go out I would treat her like she were a princess, but yet, my intentions are prue and we still aren't going out, instead there are complications!!!!      I'm in no way unreligious  I just want to understand God. I see bullies having fun tormenting people in lessons and yet there is so litte justice, why would God do this? am I doing something wrong or missing something?      Soz for many questions :)

I believe they are:      Abraham - If God tells you to do something you know is wrong, do it anyway.      Job - If your life is filled with suffering and sorrow, you must continue to praise God anyway, and you shouldn't care what happens to you in this life (the only one you definitively know you'll ever have) anyway.

I admire people whose faith is strong, they are lucky if that gives them peace. And I do believe in God, because there are so many things out there that science cannot explain away.......I just don't think the evolution of just ONE species could have been so quick and drastic when all other creatures have barely changed at all in the same time frame..........however, organized religion.........so many people of so many different faiths, all believing they are the one true religion, all doing things in the name of their religion, it just does not seem fair or right.
