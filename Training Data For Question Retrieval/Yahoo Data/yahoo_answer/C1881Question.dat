20090307102630AAFQ4xO	Computers & Internet;Programming & Design	CSS Rules Question in DWCS3?	I understand that by attaching a CSS style sheet to the index page of my web site, i can then go on to add that style to all other pages linked to my index page without having to start re-designing each page thereafter.      Assuming that i want my second page structure and layout (not content) to be exactly the same as my index page, what would be the benefit of doing this as opposed to re-saving the index page as a different name and then just tweeking it slightly to produce my new second page?      Firstly, would i be right to think that less CSS/HTML coding would be involved and that my web site would load quicker onto a browser?      Secondly, i know that i could just go into the style sheet and change all the colours and font sizes etc at the click of a few buttons, and then 'hey presto' i've got a new looking site. But what would be the other benefits?      Thanks all! I really appreicate your answers!

20060817211252AAAmD0k	Computers & Internet;Programming & Design	FLash/Actionscript/E-card?	Folks,       I am a new beginner with Adobe's Flash.       The first project I am going to wrok on is to generate a simple e-card. The kind of e-card for a person to input data and bind the input data together with website's content. Subsquently, send the card to another person via internet.       From what I understand the only way for the Flash to take the input from the end-user for generating e-card is to load the user's data at run-time. In another word, I need to call the "LoadVariables" or "LoadMovie" (actionscript) to load the user's input.       Am I on  the right track? Or is there any other better way or alternative approach to do the same thing?        Many thanks

As u know the hollidays r comeing up and they're having money problems.They stay in a small apartment where the rent is extreamly high plus the gas and electric too and are behind on the bills.They're not asking for help so i thought that i'd do it for them.I help them when i'm able to with the electric, and the gas isn't even on, i think that if they could get help when Christmas comes with clothes and toys for the kids (1 girl 10 and three boys 4,6,8) That it would of course make the kids Christmas like it should be for all children.So if any1 can give me info on where to go get help in sacramento i'd greatly appretiate it.

20070706191003AAlkrDl	Computers & Internet;Security	I noticed a tool bar that I didn't add to my computer, I know it's spyware/adware..How do I get rid of it?	Okay so I noticed a toolbar has been added to my computer, it seems to have appeared out of no where, I didn't put it on here, and I didn't download anything that would have put it on here, I know it's spyware/adware because the pop ups are from the same company orwhatever, it's called "Security Toolbar"...I know it's fake because of all of the spelling errors in the pop ups...Anyways, How do I get rid of it? I get the pop ups about every four minutes, it's extremely annoying, I have 9 pop ups right now...Oh yes, Some one suggested that I try SuperAntiSpyware, Works great, but I have to run it every day, sometimes twice because these pop ups are adding crap. I've tryed going into add and remove programs, but it's not there, I've tryed going into tools, but it can't be deleted that way either, it hides and then comes back when I open the page again...This thing is driving me nuts

20070715183530AAKmJCt	Computers & Internet;Software	Why does my computer shut off?	My parents did somthing to my computer so it shuts off atomatically every night at 10:30.

So i would just like to know how to disable this so my computer won't turn off. If you need anymore details about my computer you can email me at xbox_gotham@yahoo.com. Thanks for the help.

20081103191743AAtYzza	Computers & Internet;Other - Computers	Could someone explain (from a technical view) how email works ?	I am taking a networking class and my dad asked me a question about email i wasnt really sure how to answer.      I told him that my guess is just like hooking two computers up on other ends of a major business.       you want to send a document (in this case a email) to Mr Johnson in Research. Well chances are your on seperate servers but same network.      so your document gets a receiver IP address (Hotmail, yahoo mail, GMail) and then it goes to the server with that IP address seciton.      it then sends the document out across the server in search of the particular IP address (Johnson@hotmail.com) and then its receieved.      but how much more is it to that then just being across the building. The Internet must have 100000000 of servers it has to search first for Hotmail

I've search the internet for data recovery software, however, the price tag doesn't make things any easier. I don't want to be cheap or anything, I'll pay the money...but I'm wondering is there a freeware or open source program out there that will do everything that the retail data recovery program can do?   For example: there's a program called GetDataBack that will restore my files...but is there a free program that will do all GetDataBack (or equivalent) can do?   I'm just curious..   Thanks :)

Is it possible to use a program like the VMware Player on a Mac (with OS X Panther) to load an image of WindowsXP inside of a window? If so, can someone point me in the right direction? If this is actually possible I would also need a program that I could use to create a image of my WindowsXP machine.  The goal would be to store the WinXP image on an external hard drive that I would carry with me since I understand it would be quite large.      Please not that I'm not talking about the new intel mac's here and can't install WindowsXP in a dual boot setup. At the same time, I'm not looking for a emulator that runs programs made for Windows. I want to run the entire operating system off a external hard drive from within OSX.      I was able to use VMware on my Windows PC to load a Linux image inside of a window so I figure this might just be possible?      Any help would be appreciated, thanks!

20081026113922AA1y78h	Computers & Internet;Security	Is this normal?... I'm suspicious... Possible virus?	Hi there... I have just found a folder in my computer files (in the same window as my 'Documents', 'Pictures', 'Downloads', etc folders).  The folder was called {924b7121-fd22-485b-adb2-ac19e7f5d6b5} (including wobbly brackets...      The weird thing is that when I tried to click on it an alert came up telling me      "You don't currently have permission to access to this folder.   Click continue to get access to this folder."      The language of that ( "don't" and "get access" ) seems to me a little bit unrealistic for something official... especially as when I click continue I get the dark screen asking me if I want to allow something called "Edit Security", supposedly a Windows thing, to access my computer.      Am I beng paranoid or could something be amiss?   I haven't given the thing permision yet because I don't trust it.   Does anyone know what it might be and if it is okay?      Thanks   -Stu

I have an assignment using arrays and hashes with PERL.      Here are some of the requirements needed for the homework:   1. User input needs to enter a 3 digit number   2. then each integer entered represents a variable which needs to match an array.   For each integer has a particular position -- this integer will be outputted and the repeat operator will repeat that integer.      Here is an overview on how would it look like:   Enter a four-digit number:1234      Congratulations,   The number, $number, repeated $repeat_number -- This shows the first integer from the four digit string.      The number, $number, repeated $repeat_number -- This shows the second integer from the four digit string.      The number, $number, repeated $repeat_number -- This shows the 3rd integer from the four digit string.      The number, $number, repeated $repeat_number -- This shows the 4rth integer from the four digit string.

20081101211848AAqf54n	Computers & Internet;Internet;Other - Internet	Is there a service that will buy domain names that are approaching expiration?	there is a domain name that is going to run out in the near future and I know that there are a few other people who have their eye on the same domain name... I was wondering if there is a service out there that will keep an eye on that domain name and will aggressively go after the purchase of it once it expires under it's current owner.      I happen to know that the current owner will not be renewing it because they are unfortunately no longer on this planet if you know what I mean. the site essentially has gone un-updated and could benefit from being revived...       I should also mention... the name of the site is not trademarked. the url is not a trademark either.

When she clicks hyperlinks in her e-mail it brings up a dialog box pointing to her My Documents folder.

When I type something, then go back in the middle of the text, to insert something else, it erases the text I already typed and puts the new text over it. How do I make it so I can go back to the middle of a paragraph and type more, without everything previously typed in that paragraph, disappearing?      I used to know, but I'm tired and I've never been one with Word.      THANK YOU(:

Someone please advise me one which doesnt block applications like utorrent or email downloads but rather viruses free that works or for purchase.

20090307104709AA40Swo	Computers & Internet;Internet;Google	My website and Google search problem?	Hi folks,      I'm lucky enough that my website shows up second in a Google search, but for some reason although the description is what I want it to be, the title (the link you click on to go to the site) has some random phrase like "architectural company".      I used an architect template for my site, so it's obviously coded in somewhere, but I'm been all over the web pages and they're all labelled properly.  I imagine it's something to do with my index .html file, but I can't find this problem.      Can anyone help?  My website is www.spinninglizard.co.uk.  The search term is "Spinning Lizard".  If anyone wants to look at the html file itself please let me know and I'll e-mail it.  Thanks!

20090307103015AAjjLZF	Computers & Internet;Computer Networking	You are configuring a network that will include wireless device support.?	The network design calls for 150 devices, 100 of which will be wireless devices. You need to allow for a potential 10% growth. The majority of the devices receive their TCP/IP configuration information automatically. The wired and wireless devices should all be part of the same network segment.   You decide to bring in three high-speed Internet lines to provide connectivity for both wired and wireless devices. You plan to install three WAPs that also act as routers and include NAT functionality to support both wireless clients and wired Internet access. DHCP service support is built into the WAPs and enabled by default. DHCP provides all general IP configuration parameters for clients leasing addresses. The WAPs support configurable private Class C addresses for intranet addresses. You can change the address range, but not the Class C address network address.   Answer the following questions related to wireless network configuration and interaction between wired and wireless networking.   1. What will act as the TCP/IP default gateway for wireless clients in this configuration?      2. What will act as the TCP/IP default gateway for wired clients in this configuration?      3. WAPs receive Internet IP addressing parameters from the Internet Service Provider (ISP) through DHCP. What are the concerns when configuring local IP address information for the WAPs?      4. The network will have 10 wired servers that require static IP addresses. What guidelines should you consider when assigning IP address and subnet information?      5. For servers that need Internet access, what should you use as the default gateway?      6. How can you find values to use for Internet DNS servers?      7. Each WAP has four RJ-45 connectors for wired clients. How can you configure the network to support the necessary number of wired clients?      8. How can you prevent DHCP on the three WAPs from trying to assign duplicate addresses?

It's like about 5% of the screen you can't see.      Could this be because I'm trying to use the old NES technology with a new flat screen tv?

20090307112027AAT4TAI	Computers & Internet;Programming & Design	How do you write the code for this type of java program?	1)  Use the charAt method to get the first character in firstName and store it in a variable called firstInitial (you will need to declare any variables that you use).   2)  Print out the user's first initial   3)  Use the toUpperCase method to change the fullName to all capitals and store it back into the fullName variable   4)  Add a line that prints out the value of fullName and how many characters (including the space) are in the string stored in fullName (use the method length to obtain that information).   5)  Compile, debug, and run.  The new output added on after the output from the previous tasks should have your initials and your full name in all capital letters.

20090307111749AAa1yv5	Computers & Internet;Other - Computers	Internet/Computer problem?	I've been having this problem for a long time, but I've just recently gotten sick of it.      Because of what I do during my free time and other more important matters, I spend a lot of my computer time downloading large files such as program set-ups, thus requiring me to leave the computer on for long durations of time      However, starting from about a month ago, whenever I leave my computer on for 7-10 hours, if I tried going on the internet, the window would not open. So I try restarting or turning off my computer. So I click restart/turn off on my start menu, and I wait. And wait for 30 or so minutes, but it still does not turn off, so I end up turning off via force reset or the switch on the back of my case.         Has anyone else had this problem? Can someone explain to me what might be happening? And if possible, can some tell me a way to fix this?

20090307111006AAsNHE9	Computers & Internet;Security	Something is eating all my RAM, have no idea what, tried everything...?	Alright, since last thursday something has been eating up all my laptop's RAM even though I'm not doing anything. Vista boots perfectly fine but 5 min after everyhing has started, antivirus, firewall etc, (almost all vista services are disabled exept core ones) my RAM usage starts to climb fast until it reaches 1024/1024. At this point, vista is frozen but after about 30 seconds, RAM usage starts to fall until it reaches my normal usage of 550-600/1024, Vista is unfrozen. After some observation, this on and off with the RAM, cycles every 30-40 minutes. Sometimes randomly. This started a couple of days ago, tried System Restore but won't go far enough, before the problem started. Uninstalled everything I have installed for the last few weeks but the problem still persists. I remember turning off the UAC about last week, maybe it's one of those Time Bomb Virus thingys that just sits there, then suddenly installs itself when an opportunity presents itself. Scanned my PC with a couple of antiviruses, antispywares, rootkits, etc, nothing was found, the problem still persists. What can be causing this? Anything that can point me to the right direction is appreciated. Thanks for readin anyways!

The applet says that more mafia members = more strength in fights, but people online keep saying that the more mafia members you have, the less your strength will be, since it shares your stuff among mafia members.      I'm a lvl11 Fearless...and I certainly wish I went for mogul...but seriously: which is it? Or is it that at the lower levels, it makes less sense to recruit lots of mafia members?      Also: exactly what factors go into determining how much damage you do in fights? Is it the equipment and weapons you buy? Or the attack of your character in the profile screen?      Lol...I got stuck on Mafia Wars...      ==
