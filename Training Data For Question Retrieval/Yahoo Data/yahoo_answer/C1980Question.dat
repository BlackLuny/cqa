But my question is.. how?? how did he get my text messages word by word? how did he have someone tap into my cellphone and get those messages? FYI.. my boyfriend was never near my phone for those 2 days so he didnt "see" the messages.. I hadnt seen him at all the whole weekend.  Im asking this because we recently broke up and I have a really bad feeling he is going to do it again.. just because he cant get over me and probably wants to know if im talking to anyone.  Also, I am going to change my phone number soon (although I dont want to ive had the same # for years) but Id still like to know if anyone can tell me how he did this? and if I can find out how? or if he will do it again.. he's crazy, stalker, psychotic ex that if I change my # he will just get it again, and if I put a restraining order, he will make my life even worse.. im tellin ya..this guy is CRAZY.
