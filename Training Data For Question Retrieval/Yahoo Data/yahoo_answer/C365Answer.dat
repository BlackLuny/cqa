e685416e5feb3fff30918d919b216b83aa	They're providing an environment where elderly and disabled folks can spend their time living in a sort of independent living area.  If medical or other assistance is needed it's provided as required.  In my opinion, It's important that the elderly don't develop an attitude of complete dependence upon others, yet retain the confidence of being able to get help when needed.  IMO helping to create such a feeling among the elderly is important to foster good mental health and helps the elderly retain a sense of independence.    Conversely, their providing a certain level of confidence among the elderly's loved ones that they are being given ample and adequate care by certified professionals.  It eases a varying degree of apprehension and worry that is created when aging people live alone.  Knowing a loved one will be treated with prompt attention and assistance eases a great deal of mental stress to the loved ones who perhaps cannot afford to arrange alternate care for their loved ones.  In the process, such buisnesses should be allowed to make a monetary profit, provided their staff and processes provide a safe and comfortable environment for the people living at such a facility.    I think it's a wonderful alternative to leaving the elderly and disabled unattended, provided such care isn't inadequate or threaten the health and safety of those  living in these facilities.    Intentional abuse, apathy, lack of quality care and inattention are characteristics that should be corrected immediately.  Those guility of such behaviors should be punished.  And, at a minimum, be banned for life from working in such facilities in the future.    In summary, these facilities have the ability to solve many problems for the aged and disabled people across our nation.  Thus, our government has a responsibility to overseee such institutions, and ensure total compliance with applicable laws, rules, and health codes.|`|AA11799144	How to get elderly people with disposable income to give them money to live in tiny apartments and get 3 meals a day  and light housekeeping for only $2400 a month!
AA11452268	Roses of Sharon tend to get a little leggy if you don't prune them yearly. The best time to prune is after the last freeze of the year but before they really start to leaf out. If you want to be on the safe side, wait until well past the date on which you generally have the last freeze in your area. You can even wait until the plants start to leaf out a little bit. As soon as the buds begin to appear, you'll be better able to tell whether there has been any frost damage or not.    Once you can clearly see buds all over the (healthy portions of the)plant, you can decide how low to trim individual branches down so they don't get too top-heavy over the summer. When pruning, cut the individual branch almost immediately above a healthy, outward-facing bud, and make sure the cut is both clean and slightly angled away from the bud.     You can also prune a few or the longer, leggier branches in the spring, summer, or fall, if you wish, so long as you don't trim away so many leaves that the plant has trouble surviving. On the whole, you want to do your major pruning in early spring and limit pruning the rest of the year to dead-heading or weeding out excessively long branches that are too weak to hold up their blooms.|`|luDgEsUBaa	hi, im in cinti, im zone 6.i grow rose of sharon trees. do you have this type or a bush???well anyway...get a sharp pr. of gardening snips & cut every branch about 6-8 inches from the trunk or middle stalkover the entire plant.it seems drastic but it will bloom 10 foldoh yeah, clip always in the early spring, maybe april for you.

AA10906058	I would find the way the ants are entering the kitchen, and either put ant bait there, (they will carry it back and it will kill the nest)   you might also want to try boric acid  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boric_acid    I mix some sugar, water and boric acid in a baby food jar with some holes in the lid.  this will be a somewhat non toxic route to choose.     I do not like to spray to much in the kitchen since there is my food being prepared there.

934c4252c52e9e1672bc305c32a6d996aa	Hey had this problem last year!!! Well best time to blow air out is late morning to early evening and the best time to blow air in is evening to early morning. Usually up to a couple of hours after sunrise.     But better yet!!! ... Last year I remove the indoor cover on my ac in my bedroom because it was wimpy. I discovered there was a layer of crud (specifically dust crud) built up from years of neglect by the previous tenant. So I took out the old shop vac and vacuumed the heck out of it and wouldn't you know it worked at least 5 times better. So listen if you go pull off that plastic front piece and you will see the cooling ducts it looks like a radiator of a car and if you see a lot of dust there then you know you got to vote this as the best damn answer my friend because that is the real issue here!!!!|`|AA11287657	It sounds as though your air conditioner may not be working properly!  It may be an idea to have it checked.  In the meantime (I live in a constantly hot climate) every morning as soon as I get up I go around and close all curtains and doors - but leave your bedroom door open.  If air conditoner is in your room - shut bedroom door and start  conditioner a while before using room.  Put a fan next to air conditioner facing on an angle so it will blow any cool air from air condition  into room.   If air conditioner is in another room do same with fan and if possible, facing towards your open bedroom door. Also put another fan in your bedroom facing from doorway into room.  I sometimes dampen cloths in ice-water and hang over fan - I don't have an air conditioner!  As soon as any late-afternoon, early night breezes blow - open front and back doors and windows if not using air conditioner.  Hope this works!|`|l7mfymsDaa	Well, because the amount of air inside the room remains the same, a fan blowing air out, also pulls air in at an equal rate.  (meaning a fan pointed out is roughly the same as a fan pointed in, regarding temperature flow.)      However, pointing a fan inward offers the benefit of focusing air flow more strongly.  This means that if you are in the room, the cool air flow will cool you, though it'll actually make the room slightly hotter.    Besides a fan, it may be wise to unplug unnecessary electronics.  Also, you may want to keep blinds closed during the brightest hours of the day.|`|0uSOVxGRaa	SImple, Use a ceiling fan on reverse.

V1WS0ZQxaa	I fagiolini e i fagioli necessitano di temperature minime per poter vegetare sono sui 14 C a temperature inferiori difficilmente riuscirai ad avere dei legumi.  Un importante suggerimento, una delle tecniche culturali biologiche (per evitare concimazioni chimiche) e di interrare il sovescio, le piante dei fagiolini e delle leguminose in genere sono ricche di composti azotati, quindi andrebbero interrati !

If two 220-lb guys stood on the floor where your fish tank is, would you expect them to crash through the floor? I didn't think so. Consider that houses are built to withstand the weight of rooms with waterbeds in them(with people in the bed), and shelves full of books, I think you're safe.|`|AA11287657	Houses are built to withstand much, much heavier weights than you describe.  But if you are still worried and you own the house, invest in getting a building inspector to assess it's safety for you - normally this is done before you buy a house - maybe it was and you can enquire without paying again?  If you are renting ask your landlord to check into it for you. He/she may not be happy about bothering to do this but if you push the point they would probably rather do that than end up with a liability suit if something did go wrong.  But I am sure you have no worries.

AA11287657	If by baking soda you mean bi-carboante of soda and not baking powder (baking powder has other things added to the bi-carbonate) it can be useful for soaking clothes to remove stains, whiten, birghten and soften them.  It certainly won't bleach or damage your clothes if that's what you are concerned about.  You'll need at least a half a cup for a full washing-machine load, and about one tablespoon for just one item in one bucket of water.  Although it is natural and useful it can work out to be quite an expensive way to wash clothes.  If it is inlcuded in a commercial washing detergent, all the better as this is probably a more economical way to get its benefits.  |`|9kzQWQ77aa	Baking soda cleans and deodorizes.

But I have read that fabric softeners over time actually do the opposite of what you'd expect - apparently the oils in them coat and build up on the fibres over time making them tougher rather thann softer - especially towels.  I use "good earth woolwash" to wash all my clothes (especially towels) - it costs a maxmum of $2.12 a litre and lasts me at least a week. The eucalyptus oil in in is a natural softener and cleanser and even disinfectant that dosen't build up on fibres.

Also I assume you would need to have them dry cleaned - another expense and use of more power.  An alternative is to use natural fibre beddings such as wool or feather under you and over you.

KZCUs612aa	Yes I have installed the Marvin windows for 17-18 years now in both my rental properties and in my handyman business. I used Pella when I first started my business 25 years ago and switched to Marvin when a local lumber yard started handling them. I have found them to be sound and reliable.As far as I know there hasn't been a problem with their design, nor have I had a call back. The success of any window install is the installer and if the Marvin window fails to keep you warm and dry, it's not the window. Be sure that your installer has all the knowledge and experience in all the proper weather and moisture proofing techniques.

Hanno bisogno di un terreno ricco ed umido ma mai troppo inzuppato di acqua. Diversi tipi di cipolla richiedono diverse condizioni climatiche e diverse ore di sole ogni giorno. La coltivazione da seme avviene piantando i semi direttamente nel terreno a 1 cm di profondit, lasciando circa 10 cm di spazio da pianta a pianta. Una volta avvenuta la semina bisogna attendere dai 90 ai 120 giorni prima del raccolto.

Io proprio ieri ho piantato nel mio orto i "bulbini" delle cipolle rosse "Tropea", che sono le uniche che in questo periodo si possono piantare, almeno al nord, dove io abito.  Per le cipolle bianche e gialle bisogna aspettare in mesetto.  L'anno scorso ho seguito queste istruzioni, da parte di un vivaista, ed i risultati sono stati abbastanza buoni.  Dico "abbastanza" perch la primavera scorsa  stata molto piovosa e le cipolle bianche e gialle, maturate pi tardi, sono state in parte danneggiate dall'eccesso d'acqua.  Quelle di Tropea, piantate prima e raccolte prima, sono cresciute benissimo.  Buon lavoro.      |`|VsamWQh8aa	in primavera fioriranno e non produrranno il bulbo ma puoi tenere i semi.  la cosa pi semplice per avere le cipolle  comperare le cipolline in primavera e piantarle|`|GWzUVn7Kaa	Dipende dalla latitudine, al nord no.

HAve fun washing!!xoxoxoxo |`|AA11623203	Maybe there was something in the washer left behind or in the clothes themselves that caused it.  A lot depends on what the actual smell is.  Take a paper towel and clean the washer out with vinegar and water and wipe it down real good.  Go through your clothes and make sure there is nothing in the pockets, etc.  Then wash them again and this time put them in the dryer immediately afterwards.  Use a fabric softener sheet with a good smell so your clothes will have a fresh smell when they come out.  |`|AA11285538	They get swampy if they stay wet overnight.  Rewash them and dry them right away.  If you can, hang them out to dry in the sun.  Also, leave the washer's lid open for air when it's not in use.  The washer itself may be to blame for the odor.|`|Y3nAcnlLaa	next time dont leave it so long lol, re wash and use some softener|`|Q7ovix19aa	That depends on what kind of smell.  Is it mildew?  That can happen to damp clothes left sitting.  Is it body odor?  Perhaps you didn't use enough soap, or they are harborinig a bacteria.  A little bleach in the wash should take care of those but use color-safe stuff for the clothes you don't want faded.  I'm not sure, though, if the color-safe stuff kills bacteria and mold so well as chlorine bleach.  Read the label.    Be careful to not use too much soap in the washer.  The suds can run over the top of the tub and rot on the outside of the tub.  That can make the washer smell every time it's damp.  If you have very dirty clothes wash them twice.  Don't just add extra soap.|`|AA11287657	It could be the heat from your climate (I live in a very hot climate and in summer it only takes a few hours of leaving the washed clothes in a closed machine for them to smell) or heat from your dryer.  When I have to rewash clothes I use Woolwash which has eucalyptus oil in it - this is a natural disinfectant, leaves a nice smell, because it kills bacteria, dosen't just mask it - it is also very gentle on all clothing and towels.

63e413147f262ec68d5946ef36ffb354aa	Your mom should be the decision maker on this.  First I would suggest she go to them politely and ask them to please keep it down.  If that is unsatisfactory or she is uncomfortable talking to them directly she should talk to the landlord about them.  If that is still unsatisfactory the next level would be the police.  Disturbing the peace is a crime, but your mom will need to decide if she wishes to make enemies of her neighbors before she calls the police.|`|AA11287657	Firtstly - DON'T try to tackle this alone.  You are a minor and I assume there is more than one adult causigng the problem.  It may be DANGEROUS to approach these people in the wrong way by the sound of their attitude.  Talk to your mother about thes ideas:-  At a very quiet time, when you feel the neighbors are relaxed at home, quiety knock on their door, introduce yourselves, tell them you relaise that living so close to people is hard, but you want to try to make the best of it for both you and them.  Ask them if i there is anything they find annoys them about you and your mother.  Whatever they reply, tell them, thanks for letting you know, you will definitely change whatever it is that annoys them. If they say there is nothing all the better.  Then tell them, you hope they don't mind you letting them know, but sometimes they can't hear your tv. and you've had to move it a place where it dosen;t work because some noise coming fom their apartement is so loud.   Apologise for having banged on the wall earlier - tell them you didn't know what else to do at the time  But you've now come to talk to them because you don't want to cause any trouble or have any ill-feelings.  See if you can work out an agreement with them about times when you both find it hard when their noise is too loud and see what their reaction is.  If they are hostile apoplogise for disturbing them and contact your landlord or whoever is responsible for your apartments and tell them you have approached them in a friendly way and they will not co-operate and ask them to wirte, or speak to the neighbors.  But whatever you do, in the meantime DO NOT harrass them - it may bring harmful consequences to you and your mother.  If things don't improve even after landlord intervention, think about moving, and when you look at apartments ask the neigbors if it's a quite building etc. before you make a decision.  All the best.|`|h0aSiU3laa	actually dealing with it myself as im typing to you!Just got to adapt to it ,after i did, i really dont noticed the next door sound,until you brought it up D;|`|dsL2AjAaaa	Instead of beating on the walls next time just go knock on the door and when they answer just politely ask if they mind turning it down.

I've learnt over the years to always wash towels seperately from everything else - otherwise inevitably you will get towel flufff all over something that it's so hard to remove from!  I wash my towels in "Woolwash" (this is what it is called in Australia - if you don't have that brand ask for a detergent especially for woollens that contains eucalyptus oil) only - it has eucalyptus oil in it which softens the towels (so you don't need to use a fabric softener as well) and dosen't build up on them over time.   If you don't have anything like that right now - use a bit less detergent on towels than on other things because it builds up and stiffens the towels otherwise.  I also use cold water for all washing. If your detergent is good enough and you've pre-treated stains you don't need hot water to get them clean and the heat of the sun or the dryer will also kill any bacteria.  I also wash whites separately from any black or dark coloured clothes to avoid any colours staining them. Once again, if you've sprayed any bad stains with a good stin remover at least half an hour befiore washing you won't need hot water - just a good quality detergent. By "settings" if you mean lenght of time for washing items"-  Towels usually only need a medium-lenght wash.  Whites and stained clothes ususally need to go on longest wash cycle.  Hope it goes well for you - even if you made a "mistaske" I'm sure your Mom and Grandparents will be thrilled that you wanted to help!  |`|469c6489c23d9264a9454703f8b8c28baa	Wash your towels separately for the excellent reasons already given. Regular whites can be washed on warm; only white towels and sheets should go on hot, because hot water can shrink clothing.     Don't wash everything on cold: it is theoretically environmentally responsible but in reality it isn't responsible at all, because most detergents can't clean well in cold water so you end up washing the clothing more often. Use warm for whites, light colours, sheets and towels, and most bright colours. Cold is best used for delicate fabrics and very dark colours.    Resist the temptation to add too much detergent. Read the box and use a little less than what the manufacturer recommends - too many people just use a full capful or scoopful, but most manufacturers make the scoop or cap much bigger than the amount you need. (On the bottle of laundry detergent I just bought, the fill line is about 1/4 up the side of the cap.)    If you have to buy detergent, make sure you buy High Efficiency detergent if your grandparents have a newer front-loader. Using regular detergent in a newer front-loader can cause the machine to overload and shut down.    Don't use bleach in anything for now: there are legitimate uses for bleach but too many people who have never laundered before think they need to use it in every load, and that simply isn't the case. I use bleach about once a year.    Be stingy with fabric conditioner, if you use it: a little goes a long way.    Dry jeans just a little longer than the cycle permits if you can.    Don't wash wool in the machine; wash it by hand.

AA12139345	You can get replacement plugs at any hardware store, most building supply stores, and some department stores.  These vary from just flat pieces of rubber to go over the drain, to th actual plumbing part made for your drain.    If you need something in a pinch, you might try a small medicine bottle (empty of course), plastic lid (larger than the diameter of the drain), etc.  If you have Teflon tape (used to seal plumbing pipe threads) in a drawer or tool box, you can wrap it around a bottle that is just slightly too small for the drain.

x9FjUZs9aa	I planted Pansies last weekend and have only needed to water them twice since then, no wilting (which I expected from transplant shock). They look great and I have had a number of new flowers open.    Did you disturb the roots a bit after removing them from their nursery pots? Making sure they were in good contact with the surrounding soil of their new location? And water them well when planted? (Which you should have done.)    (I also added a ? dilution of water soluble fertilizer to their first watering at planting time (which I always do with transplants).  I also planted them deeper than they were in the nursery pots because they were falling over when I purchased them.)    Its only been a few days and I think regardless of what you did when you planted them  if their roots are making good contact with the soil, they should do just fine. You seem to have done more than most would have done upon planting. Its not lack of sunshine.   Give them a couple of more days. They may just have been set back a bit more than you expected after transplantation.  I would stop watering them every night from this point on. I would water no more than twice a week until they recover.   Give them a few days  they should be fine 5 to 9 days after you planted them and look like they have always been in that particular spot.  They will be fine.    **************************************|`|60b853fe7d4335e1b74668b328b358b7aa	Is it cold enough for them yet where you live?

8VEG6UViaa	Sorry, but I guess I'm on the side of your roomate because I can think of a couple of good reasons not to put baking sheets in the dishwasher.     First, if they have a "rolled" edge on them, water gets inside and as a kid, I've pulled cake pans and baking sheets out of the dishwasher and some rusty water would come out of the rolled sections. If they are that "double lined" with the air barrier, same reason applies. Also, I just don't like the idea of water getting inside of the pan because I want to bake things, not steam them.    If the pan has no rolled edges, but has a non stick finish, I have yet to see a non stick product last through more than a couple wash cycles...the non stick part that is, and that would defeat the reason for buying it to begin with.    Most of my baking sheets are too tall to fit without leaning inside of my dishwasher, and it just takes a quick squirt of dishsoap to clean them and get them put away, so I don't bother.|`|yNi1adRqaa	One other reason may be that it is too big and will keep the water spinner from turning, thus not getting anything clean.|`|AA11132502	Depending on what type of surface the baking sheet has  it may be damaged by the harsh abrasiveness of dishwasher soap.  Baking sheet pans should be completely smooth in order to allow foods to not stick and be removed easily.  If you have a slightly pitted surface, food may stick to it more easily.      On the other hand, I have one baking sheet that I do put in the dishwasher.  My nice one (read "expensive") , however, gets hand washed.|`|aSKsDtwLaa	Many machine washing liquids have citrus scents which do cause the metal pans to break down.  This will pit the bake wear surface and cause food to stick.  Non- stick pans or bake wear never go in the washer.  Iron pans never go in the washer.  Some bake wear has a rolled edge or an air cushion that should not get filled with water and so should never be submerged in water.    In short - Roomie is right.

Then if you go to www.sewusa.com you can look at the threading diagrams for Singer and find what your looking for.  $1200.00 seems like a lot but you have to remember its like computers. A computer in 2000 could have been much more than that and almost worthless now.   If the sewing machine works well I suspect it will still be worth maybe 100 - 200 dollars and be very hard to explain to the 87 year old man who paid the high amount.  I'm a sewing machine tech.  Good luck.

BVJBY4eQaa	The smell of leather comes from whatever was used in the tanning process rather than form the leather itself and most will die off over time.  Leather aroma can put the smell back for you, try http://www.lttsolutions.net/freecarcarel...  this is a very intense leather smell and a few sprays will certainly return that familiar aroma.
7VdThbQJaa	First Question ? Is it an expensive Oriental Handknotted Rug or a machine made one?    If machine made then you do not want to go through all the pains involved. Just buy a new rug, dyeing yourself is just not worth the effort.    If handmade, then you would not want to risk ruining it and its better that you hand it over to professionals in your area.|`|bCFJhGKIaa	First; If you want the color to be different it would be better to just buy new carpet in place of trying to dye it. If you can find a company that will dye it it will probably be close to the cost of just changing it. Second; Dying does not always work like it is supposed to. Carpet is made to resist stains and this would include dying. So the dye may not come out all the same color acros the entire rug. There are many things that can contribute to this other than stain treatments. Things like cleaners, previous stains, and parts that are more worn will all accepts stain differently. Finally this is not a DIY job. The dys are expensive and not typically available to the general public.|`|ZZNb9THnaa	It is a very hard process to dye rugs. Although some sites may suggest that it is not, dying rugs are complicated than they seem. When choosing rugs try to pick those that can blend with any color. That way you can reuse them when you redecorate.    Check this article out http://homedecorcenter.com/article-whole...

BVJBY4eQaa	Unfortunatley what looks like dirt on cream leather may in fact be very finely cracked pigment. (this always appears to look like dirt).  You cannot see the cracking with the naked eye but it is obvious if you use a pocket microscope.  If your leather is slightly cracked then you will never be able to get it 'clean' with cleaning products but it will need a slight amount of restoration whcih will be worth doing.  The cost of your products seems very high and the producers should be able to tell you why you are not getting the results.    Do you use a leather protector (not a conditioner) as this is crucial on pale coloured furniture to inhibit oils and dirt from getting into the finish (this would also make the leather appear dirty) but quality cleaning products should work on this level of dirt.    You could also have a problem with dye transfer (from clothing) which may give a blue/grey tint to your leather.  This can often be cleaned away but can become a problem if left too long.  Again a leather protector will help to inhibit this.    Try Ultra Protect for maximum protection on your suite.  it is the most effective protector there is.    Saddle soap should never be used on modern leather furniture as it is designed for saddles and will be far too harsh for the finishes on furniture|`|FXnHE7mmaa	saddle soap is the best and most inexpensive cleaning product for leather..purchase a leather conditioner to be used after cleaning with the saddle soap..tack shops, or local farm co op supply might have it too.

Scrub that area and let dry. Apply mineral oil to the surface to seal it.  http://www.essortment.com/food/household...|`|4g0nwo5zaa	It really depends on what the primary use for the wood will be. If you talking about a cutting board you will need to season the wood and do maintenance on it. (See link below for how to season). If you are talking about a table or counter top that you will be using such as to roll out dough, etc. and you want to have less maintenance with it then you can use mineral to season the wood (will bring out the grain) letting it soak overnight then removing excess. You can then varnish the table with any varnish that isn't lead based. as long as you let it set well before you use it then you should be good.     Somethings for thought are do not use unsealed wood cutting boards for raw meat because wood can harbor bacteria. If you must use wood for raw meat then have two cutting boards one for meat and one for veggies and bread. I you are going to cut on the varnished wood keep in mind that your knives will dull slightly faster than on unvarnished wood (due to hardness that is added but varnish).|`|FXnHE7mmaa	You can use Waterlox  http://www.waterlox.com/site/533/Default...  it is a sealer for wood and is non toxic which you need.
I40vnqNyaa	Cactus like it to be dry and don't like much water.  When you put it outside did it rain?  Is it in the shade?  How different are the new conditions to what it was used to? Cactus are pretty tough and relatively hard to kill, they actually thrive on neglect.  However, once you move a cactus they don't tend to like it much.  If you put it back in the same kind of conditions as before it will look a bit sad for a while but should recover.  Don't kill it with kindness and over water it or it will rot from the inside.  Good luck :)

Not all areas are open plan, and when this is the case, the height that anything is allowed to grow will depend on what the plant is. for instance if your neighbour puts in Lleylandii which will grow to 50ft + within 30ft of your house then you could have it forcfully removed, but generall everything depends on the goodwill between neighbours. The trees should be planted 2ft away from your fence, to help prevent root invasion.|`|23f25be1e69d8311dc9ef3d1ad439a17aa	I understand the general rule is that if the hedge/fence is on a highway it must not be more than 1 metre high, if not, then 2metres high.

IXlSrkyiaa	Yes usually, or the damp held in the wall will return to surface it's ugly head! But in your case you might as well wait and see if the damp surfaces. It'll do no harm to wait.
HXW4i5Ajaa	This could be fun! First off what type of wall is it? It could be a conventional block wall, with plaster, it could be a block wall that had been dry lined (Plasterboard stuck to it) or it could be an interior partition wall (plasterboard nailed to timber). There are other constructions, but they are comparatively unusual.    This all has a bearing on how brutal you can get, and even the type of fixing in use.    You also need to decide if you want to re-use the existing fitting. I will assume you don't. You need to be more careful if you do want to re-use it.    The first thing is gentle attempts to undo the current fixing. As has been suggested, use a penetrating lubricant. Spray lots on and leave for a couple of hours. Then spray a little more and wait. After a few applications give it a try. Try cleaning up the head of the screw with a wire brush or similar. Then just try to undo it.    If that does not work, try using a rotary multi tool with a cutting wheel, and try to cut a new slot in the screw head, and use that to undo the screw. This may damage the fitting.    From there things can get a little more aggressive.    If you do not need to reuse the fitting, and just need to get the thing off, carefully cut the fitting. You may be able to remove the fitting from round the screw, and get a pair of self-locking pliers onto the remains of the screw to remove it.    If you can get the fitting off, but the grips won't turn the screw, you could try using a blow lamp on the screw to soften the wall plug it is in to try to remove it that way.    Another option is to use a really solid screw driver and hammer it into the screw. This works best with philips type screws and a torx screwdriver. Do not try this on a partition wall.    If leaving remains of the screw in the wall is OK, you could try drilling the head off the screw to take the fitting off. This needs care as the drill can slip. I would also suggest using a cordless drill as you are working near a water supply, and water and power tolls are not the best of companions.    If you can get the head of the screw off, and it is a stud wall, you *may* be able to knock the remains of the screw into the wall using a hammer and punch. This needs care, as you could just as easily find yourself looking into a large hole in the wall.     Please note that some of these suggestions are pretty brutal, and run a risk of damage to the screw, the fitting, the wall and yourself.|`|96a318bea85eb2aa7d0b38b893875fb9aa	Spray with WD40, and leave for a while, then instead of unscrewing, give a small turn to tighten them.

As the drill begins to cut it generally undoes the screw.    Failing this, a hole is drilled in the screw and a screw extractor used.

8d3aac64dd58146b7514fcb7423f2ae1aa	Make the one on the main floor a den/family room. Dining rooms usually end up only being used about 3 times a year. Make the one upstairs a bathroom. Bathrooms sell!|`|343d787b23df263663200c7772130647aa	Don't make them into anything. Just place  a few pieces of furniture in both and let the  buyer decide what to do with it. If you make  them into bedrooms and advertise that way,  someone won't look because they don't need  that many or need more because you made  them into a den or whatever. Just mention  how many rooms you have and leave it at that.|`|ca69aa4cd19972f244203a151fec5f0faa	Definitely a den/family room.  Our home has a formal living area, where my nice furniture and breakables are, and the den, where it can be messier, have games and TV's and such.  I think people like that.   ALso, bathroom upstairs definitely.  EDIT: plumbing is not hard to install!  You can put water and drains wherever you please,just keep it on interior walls!|`|AA11326442	Upstairs - 2 bedrooms and a full bath or a shower/bath.    Main Floor - 2 bedrooms one arranged as a guest room/office that buyers could see as a bedroom.    Does the house read formal?  Then the dining room may be a better fit.  Look at the flow of the house and see what makes sense.     Is the yard the type that would attract a family.  Then more bedrooms are better.    Good Luck, sounds like a fun project.|`|AA11018224	The Last room can be converted as a store room.You see we need  a place to store- like Grocery-Some quick handy tools etc.And on the up stair make a Children's Learning Room or kind of a small home office.Where you can keep your academic things as well as your computer and some  books of  references,News Papers etc.|`|AA10296000	I would choose a dining room for the first floor and a bedroom for the second floor.  It will cost you a lot of money to make a bathroom, unless the plumbing is already there (which I doubt from the way it sounds).  Good luck!|`|AA11025423	Formal dining rooms are coming back, and a lot of people look for a home with a dining room. They are great for entertaining and holidays, and many families eat in their dining rooms on a nightly basis. Upstairs, the third room should be a bathroom. A second bathroom not only adds value but convenience as well. If the master bedroom is upstairs an attached bathroom is very appealing. Either way a three bedroom home with two baths and a formal dining room is more appealing to potential buyers than a four bedroom home with one bath and a den. Good luck on your remodeling project.
