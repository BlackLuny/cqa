20090225023954AASMFxd	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	How could anyone call a working mother "neglectful'?	i have a 17 m/o daughter and one on the way. both my husband and i work full time and have great jobs. he works days and i work nights so we only need a sitter for about an hour each work day (4 days a week) just to cover the time that i am commuting to work and waiting for my husband to get off.       my babysitter recently told me she doesnt want to watch my daughter anymore because she thinks that since i work full time i am "neglecting my daughter". this just sickens me. being a SAHM is something that not everyone can pull off. our bills (mortgage, all the normal things like cars, food, utilities, insurance, and the cost of a child and one on the way) require that we both work and both my husband and i take excellent care of our daugther... i see working as providing for my child, instead of leaving the burden just on my husband who would in turn have to work 2 jobs if i ever quit mine..       do any of you see a working mom as a ''neglectful mom''      mind you, this girl that refused to watch my daugther is a sahm that has never worked a day in her life and sits home all day and spends her husbands money buying clothes online.. doesnt know the value of a dollar and never will.. her husband brings in over 3k a month and she still collects food stamps and medicaid because she lied on the applications, saying they were both unemployed. i think this is more irresponsible than both parents working full time could EVER be.
20090225024110AAm56f8	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	What do you make of this? have been ttc for 5 months now!?	I have been off the pill for a year and my partner and I have been trying to conceive. My periods are regular 30 days and they last for about 5 days. Last month I got 3 days of a brownish discharge then it went away for a day and then I got a small bleed for 2 days and that was it. I asked the doctor about this and she said that women get strange periods from time to time and it was normal but I have never ever had this before. Cud this be something else? Could I be pregnant? I don't want to take a pregnancy test and be disappointed by a negative result so should I just wait and see if I get my next period or not?      Advice welcome and baby dust for everyone ttc xx

20090225024435AAw73wP	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Could I be Pregnant and Still have a Negative Test Result?	The last week and a half, for the first time ever, I haven't been able to keep my eyes open when my husband and I have sat down to watch the news after dinner, which we've always done. I've had to go to bed and not even noticed when he's come upstairs. THEN I'll have ten hours of sleep and still fall asleep on the sofa in the day. My boobs are sore and my nipples are tingling, I've been so moody that I've bitten the poor guy's head off every day!! Getting up in the night to go for a pee, headaches no end, stomach cramps, back ache, and I never get any symptoms before I have a period so that all felt very off to me. I did however get my period (albeit extremely light and shorter than normal) However, when my mum fell pregnant with my younger brother and I she continued having periods until she was 6 months gone. So, I went out about an hour ago and brought a test.... which was negative. What's going on?! Has anybody else felt the same? Is there something that might be making me ill that carries similar symptoms that I'm getting confused?? Any help or advice would be much appriciated.

Also because the contractions aren't that strong would it be safe to wait 5 hours because i have a doctor's appointment then and i know that they don't admit you into the hospital unless you're having active labor.

20090225030654AAlRAWU	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	Developmentally delayed? Please help :)?	I have worked at this place (childcare centre) for 2 years and I have the 3-4 year olds (some are 2, these are the children who go to school in 2011)      I am concerned about one boy in the group. Here is the info...      - 2 years, 8 months   - Lack on attention span   - Seems to like music activities and cars   - Throws toys and thinks its funny   - Comes from an Arabic background, apparently there is minimal speech in Arabic, as well as English.   - Baby talks, e.g beep beep, baba, mama. These are pretty much the only words we have heard from him in the time he has been here (6 months)   - Likes to bottom shuffle   - Seems to be off with the fairies eg. You say something to him and its 'eh?'      Don't get me wrong, he is a beautiful boy but I'm concerned. My children in my group are at different levels, but not like this.      We had his sister at the centre last year and while her attention span was short, she seemed to be developmentally fine. But I'm concerned about him. I am going to talk to my supervisor about it. But what are your thoughts on this?      Thanks :)

I ovulated with the help of clomid over the weekend, since then I have had mild cramping in my abdomen.  However, yesterday I had to have a loop diathermy to my cervix for an abnormal smear, so can't tell if the cramps are because of that or due to the clomid.      Since yesterday afternoon I have had a terrible back pain, it hurts if I move suddenly and feels like period pain.  Is this due to the diathermy or because of post-ovulation?

I knew that these series of conference calls would be uncomfortable, but in this last one, the other family member got down-right ugly in attacking me and crossed the line by yelling, constant interruptions, etc.  This person is really important to me, and I do want to try and resolve some our "issues",  but aftert this past phone call causing so much stress for me due to the attacking nature, I wonder if I should hold out until after this baby is born to continue these conference call meetings.  My question is...Do I have a valid concern about this extreme stress affecting this unborn baby/my own health at this time in my pregnancy?  The stress level has caused insomnia, lots of intense crying (past the "normal" pregnancy crying), my entire body shaking, and I wouldn't even know what my current blood pressure is.  Thank you for any feedback!

Johnny doesn't like drinking milk throughout the day - he only wants juice (no water either)... But he DOES like Chocolate Milk.        So is Chocolate milk terrible to give him maybe like once a day?        Sorry if this is a dumb question, lol
20090225035637AAFRCyQ	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	How many hours should a 9 month old sleep at night?	and how long is considered sleeping through the night? Usually Jacob will wake once for a bottle.... he doesn't have a set pattern, just whenever he wants to really..he goes to bed at 8 PM (which works well for us... we will not chane it to earlier.. we can't) and gets up between 5-6 AM. Last night he did not get up at all until 5:15 AM so got about 9 hours sleep.       So how long should a 9 month old be sleeping at night, how many hours are sleeping though the night at this age and do you think Daylight Savings time will make him sleep later?

My mum and my fiance were present at my son's birth, my mum was amazing, I can't ever imagine giving birth without her by my side to rub my back, but she's recently learned that her breast cancer has come back and it's spread to her bones and her lungs, she's not having chemo and the doctors have said that any treatment that they do is to prolong her life rather than curing the cancer. Me and my partner were gona wait a few more years before having another baby (his decision not mine) but the thought fo giving birth without my mum terrifies me to the point of not wanting to have another baby. Just wondered if anyone had had their mum's at the first birth but unfortunatly couldn't with the second or if you have not had anymore kids because your mum wasn't aourn anymore? Thanks Xx

20090225050152AASLqEF	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Can I hurt my baby by sitting him up?	My son is only 11 weeks old but he's always had great head control and has been sitting on my lap facing out with his head against my chest since about week 4. On monday I thought Id try to see if he could sit aided and he sat on the sofa very happily with his bum on the seat and his back against the back of the sofa. He's so strong that I thought Id try unaided... so I sat him on the floor and let my hands move away slightly... and he sat there for a second before balance got the better of him and he started to fall to one side (I only had to move my hands a fraction to stop him, don't worry!). When he sat he kind of hunched a bit almost like he was balancing his upper body on his chubby belly! Will it hurt him to practice this with him? He seems comfortable enough.

20090225051942AA21Orp	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Was this an implantation bleed?	I am usually good at taking my contraceptive pill micronor however with a busy thursday last week (19th feb) I forgot. My period was on the 5th feb and is not due again until the 5th march.... the day I forgot the pill (thursday) was 14 days after my period which is my most fertile time of the month! On Sunday night I realised that I was bleeding, only slightly pink and not fast at all... spotting? This must have stopped over night but returned again on monday night and tuesday morning, but I have had nothing since. It is definately not my period as I have had no pains, plus it wasn't due for another 2 weeks. Could this have been implantation bleeding and mean I could be pregnant? If so should I stop taking my pill and use condoms until my period is due and if it doesn't come take a test? I am really confused, only mature answers please.

HI parents,      i know about babies' growth spurt, and i also know it slows down after 1 year of age.    me posting this question here is just a bit of concern....haha...(first time mum!)      right, my girl is 17 months old, i just checked on her red book yesterday and found out that her height 81-82cm sits on a 75th of ranking among 100 babies.    when she was 12 months old, she was on the top, and all those months before she reached 1.    I know all of you would say there's nothing wrong and i know it's fine.   but i just kind of "don't" like to see such a big drop if you know what i mean?   she only grew 2centimetres in the last 5 months after her first birthday.      so any parents would share any ideas?   i thought she's gonna be a tall girly before as she used to always be on the top since birth, yet now the ranking suddenly dropped to 75th, but now i am not sure?      by the way, she's healthy, just hasn't put on any weight since 1 year old, and grew 2cms.       thankss

20090225034203AA0dPJJ	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Can't get my stubborn baby to sleep!!?	Ok, so here it is.  My son is almost 5 months and does not sleep through the night at all.  He began to sleep better at night for a little while, but just recently has been waking up in the middle of the night refusing to go to sleep.  He is on a bedtime routine, and my husband and I keep it pretty constant maybe a little earlier on nights he seems too tired.  He usually does well about falling asleep at bedtime, but sometimes wakes up about once or twice between 9-11 and we give him his pacifier and he falls back to sleep.  He then wakes up about 12 and eats a bottle, and that's where it has been falling apart.  Then he seems to not sleep well, he wakes either every hour or stays up for a few hours.  He sometimes won't completely fall back to sleep until 7 in the morning.     Tonight he had his bath like normal, but after his bath he did not want to eat his bottle, he just wanted to sleep.  So we laid him down, and he fell asleep for about an hour.  I tried feeding him his bottle then, he still did not really want it.  He finally fell back to sleep and woke again in another hour, this time he ate his bottle, and fell back to sleep...for an hour! He woke up at 930, 1030, 1130, 1200, 1230, 100, and 130 and has been up since (it is 230 now)   Now I have not done the CIO method really with him, any attempts I have made he is too stubborn.  One night I tried and he seriously did not give up for a few hours! (of course i went in and checked on him frequently, reassuring him that Mommy's here, but that made him cry more rather than calm him) but tonight I had enough and decided I was just going to do it. It's been an hour so far.   He does use a pacifier and I don't know how to break him of it, everywhere I have read says that he needs to self-soothe.  He was a NICU baby, and was intubated for 2 wks, and afterwards given a pacifier, so I do not know how to break him from it so he can self-soothe.     He also co-sleeps but I am trying to get him to sleep in his own crib recently (and its not really making a difference where he is for the night wakings) When we first brought him home I was so paranoid that any little sound he made I woke up so I finally just put him in bed with us so I could be a little more at ease.  We actually made him his own bed type thing with my pregnancy pillow, so he basically sleeps like a king and does not sleep so well flat on his back.  (He actually sleeps best on his side)    I know these are bad things but I don't know how to break them.     And how do I go about this CIO method...I'm not sure I know exactly what to do...I feel terrible letting him cry but tonight, I seriously am at my breaking point! I'm feeling beyond irritable, and depressed, I came out here and cried while he cried because I just want him to sleep at night so I can sleep!!    Also I think he might be teething and am not sure if that might be the reason for these recent constant awakenings?!   How do I go about CIO?   How do I do it with such a stubborn baby???   How do I break him of the pacifier??   How do I get him in his own crib??? (and I have tried the t-shirt thing doesnt work with him)      PLEASE HELP ME! THANKS!!

Shimmering in the stomach - is that normal????   i also feel bloated and also had spotting when i was meant to be on my period.   Food tastes are different - porridge tasted metally. Stomach is tender but firm. Needing the toilet a lot but that can mean anything. I have taken 2 tests - one before my period was due and one after. Both were negative. I am going to take another one at the weekend but could I really be pregnant after 2 negatives????

There was two little dots where the positive line should be but I do not think that counts. Does it?? I think I am hanging onto false hope and making my period late. So I hope AF comes on her merry way and I can go through this emotional roller coaster all over again next month.

20090225070848AA5HFi5	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	At what height/weight do you switch to a booster seat?	The car seat my son is in goes up to like 45 inches and 45 pounds or something ( I don't have the exact measurements in front of me), but I am just curious as to when kids can safely go in to booster seats?  My son will be 3 at the end of April and we will discuss this with the doctor then, but I was just curious?  I don't think he is ready yet, but am hoping that he will be in another 6 months because my daughter is only 12 months 4 days younger than him, so soon she will be ready for the car seat he is in.  If it is not safe though for him to go to the next seat, we will obviously buy a second car seat that size, but I was hoping financially to not have to.  He is currently 39 inches and 35 pounds.

My question relates to experiences and thoughts and if they would make changes in the way its been approached at any point in time. Being in a very open adoption I just want to have an idea on what works and what doesn't for people.

20090225071611AA1C5HI	Pregnancy & Parenting;Grade-Schooler	How to handle a re-admittance meeting with the Principal and teacher?	My 12 year old son was recently suspended from school for 3 days. He spent 2 days at home and the 3rd day on "in school" suspension in the office. I have a meeting tomorrow with his teacher, the Principal and the school social worker and I am not sure how to handle it.      My son was suspended for swearing at his teacher. I agree that he should be suspended as this behaviour was unacceptable. However, his teacher truly is a big part of the problem. She yells and screams at the students constantly. She is insulting and humiliates the kids with comments like "are you retarded?" or "you are just a bad person, why don't you go home?", "What's wrong with your brain, are you stupid?".   While my son was suspended I received 6 phone calls from other parents in the school offering their support and sharing their stories of difficulties with this teacher.   My problem lies in the fact that I don't want to come across as one of those parents who blames the teacher for everything and thinks that my kid can do no wrong. He was in the wrong. But I also feel that he was very provoked and that the teacher encourages and ramps up the confrontation level with her students rather than trying to defuse situations.    Any advice on going into this meeting? I just want my son to have a more productive learning environment and not pick a fight with the teacher. He is dealing with consequences at home as well as his suspension so it's not like he is getting away with his bad behaviour.    This teacher really is problematic. She receives personal cell phone calls several times a day during class. She displays a strong racial bias towards her students. She screams constantly. She belittles the kids.    What to do?

I am TTC my second baby since last April. I had 2 miscarriages in 2008.      I gave myself over 3 months after my last miscarriage for my body to get back to normal and am now TTC again.      I ovulated this month on 12th Feb (I had positive ovulation tests and a temperature shift)   My period was due yesterday and when I woke up I thought it had arrived as there was red blood. But all I had yesterday was a little red spotting and then it stopped.      Today is the same, just some spotting this morning which has stopped again.      My temperature is still up, well above my coverline.   I did a pregnancy test today. which was negative.      Should I count this bleeding as my period? If it is my period then why is my temp still up (it usually falls the day my period arrives)      What are the reasons that spotting can occur for a few days for a period arrives? I've never had this before!      Any suggestions/ virtual hugs much appreciated!

I had an ultrasound scan 4 weeks ago, as the doctors thought it was ectopic, but they said I was too early for them to really see anything.  All they could see was a couple of shadows which they suspected to be sacs and some fluid that they didn't know what it was.  It should now make me about 8 weeks, although I'm measuring for a lot bigger than 8 weeks, I have a nice bump, so cute!  Anyway..   Last time I had unprotected sex was the beginning of November, I had a period in November.  I'm normally on for about 5 days and it's very heavy, the period I had in December I was on for 2 - 3 days, very light and a strange red colour, I've not had a period since then.  How can I be 8 weeks pregnant if the last time I had sex was a lot longer before then?  Are these scans accurate?  Surely if I was further on they'd have seen a bit more of something and told me?  I'm so confused.

My sister in law has a 6 wk old baby and she sleeps long nights... but there is a debate whether she should sleep on a flat lying bed in the crib.... or slightly upright.. (a towel is sometimes folded underneath to make it a little higher under her head) the reason for this is if she would happen to spit up, it would be easier to come out in this position  and it wouldn't get clogged in her nose or throat at night..      also, she sleeps on her tummy.. she sleeps like this for a good 7 to 8 hrs at night... if she sleeps on her back she wakes up every few hrs..       what is the correct way for an infant to sleep?

20090225060829AAtN2Gu	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Do any of you mommys remember...?	Hi, I'm 37 weeks and 2 days pregnant with #2 today and might I add that I'm very uncomfortable and I don't know how much more of this I can take. With our first baby I was induced at 39 weeks and 5 days but ironically ended up going into labor that same day. They induced me because at my 36 week checkup, I had been dilated to 3cm and stayed that way for 2 weeks. This time I'm in a different state and they're not checking me until next Monday (at 38 weeks), which I think is ridiculous lol. Anyway I have three questions:      I know everyone is different, but I'm just curious to know if you remember how many cm you were dilated at your 38 week checkup?      How many cm do you have to be dilated for them to admit you?      Also something totally unrelated, do you remember how many weeks you were sore after having baby if you delivered vaginally? I forget.      Thanks!!      -mommy to a 12 month old and 37w2d pregnant with #2-

When I applied for and accepted the job, I was not pregnant, but found out I was pregnant about three weeks before my start date. I told them at Christmas that I was pregnant. This job is permanent, meaning I have full benefits including mat leave top-up. I get 55% of my salary paid by the government as unemployment insurance for 50 weeks and I get topped up by my employer to 93% of my salary for 8 months. I can also continue my benefits for the year and am guaranteed a job when i return.      Here's the thing - I hate this job and am not planning on returning to work after this baby. I officially told them last week that I am starting my mat leave on april 9th. My manager was actually dumb enough to ask me if I was planning on coming back! As if i would tell him I'm not coming back, duh! Anyway, í don't legally have to tell them whether or not I'm returning until a month before I'm due back to work, which is next March.      If it was you in this situation, would you have been honest and told your boss you are not coming back? or would you lie?      I'm not going to change my mind, just curious what other people would do.

I'm doing a presentation on motor development of children, i.e how they learn to walk, their fine motor development, etc. I read in my book that they often struggle to walk because their bodies are changing so rapidly. This may sounds like a stupid question but I don;t have any children and so I don;t know how their bodies develop. I was wondering if anyone could tell me some of the changes their bodies go through? I'm thinking of children aged 0-3 years. I know that the head changes in proportion and the curvature of the spine changes, but that's all I can find in my notes, and I struggled to find anything on the internet. Any help welcome.
20090225051530AAahiPo	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Could she be pregnant? Has anyone experienced this?	Ok my friend had unprotected intercourse the December 24th. She wasnt feeling very well and took a HP test on January 3rd that came out negative, She had a period the 6th, but it wasn't exactly normal. things escaladed and more symptoms that mimicked pregnancy symptoms came about and She took another test on January 19th and 24th both were negative, a very light period that was actually more like spotting a whole lot came around February 5th couple with the abnormal period she was still feeling very neuseaous, tired, irritable/emotional as she had been feeling all of January, She took another test on February 8th that was also a negative. Is there any way she could still be pregnant after all those negatives? She's still feeling very very tired, but she sleeps a lot and takes naps almost every day, having terrible moodswings, still feels a little sick on and off she's been feeling like this since the begining of January and the moodswing shave just been escalading. I'm trying to get her to go to the doctors but it's like pulling teeth because it isnt exactly convient for her( the office her insurance covers is an hour away). Has anyone experienced something like this or known some on that was in this siuation and been pregnant or do any of you have any suggestions at what else it migjt be?

20090225050327AAse3jk	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	My girlfriend's pregnant.?	I know that in florida You don't need parental consent, Only parental notice (She's 17, a Minor.) How does that notice procedure work? Does it take parental signature? Phone call?... Becuase her parents for SURE would not allow the abortion, And if notice means a signature, They could be notified and never sign it.    Don't try to send us bullshit about other routes other than abortion. We're ******* teenagers with unsupportive parents, Not to mention the horrible economy and our small/expensive town.   So tell us how to get an abortion , Or risk having our kid who's unloved/adopted grow up to become (a t a higher rate) a criminal who murders your kid becuase They had parents that couldn't financially or emotionally support them.   Only serious responses please , She wants an abortion. So don't try to convince us of the adoption route. Prenatal care is expensive. She says getting fat is disgusting. Were just "Young stupid teenagers" We know, We've heard it all before. Just answers please.         (this is a repost in the right section)   22 hours ago - 1 week left to answer.    Additional Details   Actually, There are ways around it. Such as abortion. I just wanted to know about the whole Parental notice thing.      And You should read "freakonomics" Studies/statistics show that babies in which couldn't have been aborted (due to abortion being illegal) grow up to become a higher statistic of crime.      I didn't know Yahoo was so ******* political. Yahoo answers is so ******* pro-life. There's a Parenting&pregnancy-Pregnancy section, But no Parenting&pregnancy- Unwanted pregnancy section. I'm just trying to look for help, as my girlfriend and I are very much in love. And If her abusive ******* parents were to find out that she was pregnant, I wouldn't be able to see her again/ Even be able to support her through her pregnancy. If we both WERE able to live on our own, I actually wouldn't mind Being a dad and supporting OUR kid. It's just the fact that I'm not at a financial standpoint to raise it, And She tells me she wouldn't be able to emotionally handle pregnancy without me around   22 hours ago      In addition, I wouldn't feel any guilt if she were to abort the child. I plan on having children with this girl sometime in the future, Just not now. I don't beilieve the fetus (Especially at this stage) to be "living" so, I wouldn't feel any guilt. That's getting a little more into my opinion ,And off topic. But just saying, Both of us wouldn't mind abortion. Of course last night I was about to kill myself and she told me She wouldn't be able to have an abortion if what was inside of her was the only thing left of me. So basically, We're going through a really ******* rough time, And We're SURE we want an abortion.   22 hours ago      Dee, I live in FT.Walton beach florida.      Everything on that list is much too far away.      Anything closer?   possibly pensacola?/destin?

20090225055825AAJvO3z	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	I am approximately 5-6 DPO and I have a question?	As probably many of you know my story of TTC for 5 months now unsuccessfully. Though this month was a little different since this was the fist month I noticed sharp needle like pains in my left ovary on the 19th and had a very thin stretchy cervical mucus on the 20th. Had intercourse almost every day right after my period which was Feb. 8. Yesterday I had a slight heartburn and today I was very little nauseous and my vagina is very very dry. Anyone had similar symptoms and ended up being pregnant? I will be testing on the 2nd of March I guess if I can wait that long of course... Please share with me if you know anything about the above. I know that implantation does not occur after 6-12 days for the symptoms to occur but I know people who just felt they were pregnant and yes one more important thing, I do not have my usual premenstrual cramps in my lower abdomen for the first time in my life, could this also be a sign? Cause I always have them one week prior to AF...Please help with some experience or stories cause the 2WW is HORRIBLE lol.

Yesterday morning (9DPO) I tested again and was is a line again and this time it was more visible and I could see it quite easily holding it at book reading distance.

20090225061631AAQ83jv	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	6 week old baby boy, still jaundiced?	I am very concerned for my baby boy, who initially had high bilirubin levels and had to be put in the phototherapy 4 days after he was born, and now he is 6 weeks old, his skin looks fine, but the whites of his eyes were still a little yellow so the doctor checked his bilirubin again, and it was still relatively high, at 8. (at 2 weeks of age, his level was 11.9)     He also has thrush (yeast) in his mouth that I am giving him nystatin for. I am worried about why he still has high BR levels, and what could happen, what I should do (the doctor said to keep breastfeeding) what could be the underlying reason, how long it takes to cause major problems like brain damage etc...    Please help with any advice!

Hi      Just wondering if it is too soon for me to test with First Response Early Result Gold Digital Read or EPT Certainty?  Today is CD24.  My period tends to fluctuate from 28-30 days cycles. I took one yesterday and today with FMU and NEG. Is it just too soon? My breasts are a little sore, nipples hurt a little. No areola changes. Should i see some kind of symptoms if i am? CM today seems wet, kind of tacky but kind of lotiony.  Almost more warm and wet then usual.  the some bottom part of my cervix feels hard but the very tip is still kind of soft. it almost feels like it may be come hard pretty soon.    I have been suffering from gas and lower back pain.  ocassionally it feels wierd along my sides by my ribs, like a strained muscle. Ive been getting lower abdominal cramps everyday since i did my insemination on CD 11 & 12. I have also experience nausea over the past 8-9 days and slight vomitting last week. I occassionally feel myself get a little wet in my panties, when the cm is coming down. which isnt my normal, im normally pretty dry.  Ive also been bloated.       I am wondering what all of this could be about...i really hope this works. i always appreciate the time u take to answer...      Baby dust to all

I have tried only letting him peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, but he sneeks up to the fridge and eats what he wants anyways. I was thinking maybe a essay on the word respect and what it means to him, but not sure how long to make it.  We just built a new house and last night I went into his room and there are pencil marks on his wall and dirt marks on the wall near the ceiling. I explained to him that this house costs us alot of money and he needs to take care of things and stop destroying everything, he said that he understood, and I thought that he did. About an hour later he is throwing a soccer ball at the walls!!!!  I am at my edge with him, I do not know what else to do.

My problem is this. DD has been teething for what seems like the past month and in the past two days she has all but refused her bottle which is strange for her. I have tried warming them up, chilling them off... you name it I have tried it! So I am sitting here wondering is it because of the teething pain and if so what else can I do for her.

But she is still having plenty of wet diapers so dehydration is not of top concern my concern is in regards to her discomfort! Thanks for any suggestions in advance!

20090225060407AAMjYJk	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Is Plan B suppose to make your first period after taking it, Lighter then usual?	I had Protected sex(used condom). Im not on Birth control. When he ejaculated into the condom and went to pull out, the condom got stuck. Now this has NEVER happened to me before and i feel so ignorant in saying i never thought it could happen. So the next thing to do obviously was fish it out per say. I finally got a hold of it and when i took it out there was nothing in the condom, everything that should have been in it was in me or all over me. So this was saturday, i got home sunday stupidly didnt think anything of it until later that night when i was talking to one of my friends, she got me so scared to the point i was trying to say i cant get prego, i looked up on an ovulation calander and the day me and him had sex was the day on the calender i was most fertile. So at this point im bugging out, so monday i went to the pharmacy and got plan b, took it the way it says to, mind u i took it in the last 24 hours instead of the first. So after all that i got my period on time, but im not leaving as much as i normally do on my pad, but when i wipe i have a good amount on the toilet paper(sorry for being blunt) I have cramps. But the way mybody usually wrks, is i get cramps right as im getting my period and then thats it on the cramps. But this period, i have cramps the second day of my period and im basically wearing a panty liner which i could NEVER pull off on a regular period. So With the whole story can someone tell me, is plan b suppose to make ur first period after taking it lighter? Sorry for all the info but im nervouse i could still be prego... Btw i had a previous pregnancy but misscarried about a year ago. could this make my chances more high of the pill not working? I feel so stupid but its because im nervous    Thank you

20090202102934AARtsEy	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	How do you stop your toddler from climbing all over everything?	Here's the issue - He loves turning my tv off and on.  So I've put his chair that he hates in front of the tv (the tv is on a stand so it doesn't block the screen).  Now all of a sudden, he's figured out that he can climb up on the chair and get to the power button.  I've turned the chair around and he just climbs up over the arms of the chair and gets to the power button.       I keep telling him no... I've moved him away to a different toy... I don't know what else to do, he always goes back to that chair/tv.      Any suggestions?      (He's 15 months)
20090225063313AAbyfAk	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	I asked this yesterday and got only 1 good answer.?	My 17 year old nephew has been in state care for about 10 years now.   He and his mother have been staying with us about 1 weekend a month. This is in preparation for us to assume custody. We do not have access to his records so we don't know the full extent of his issues. My wife and I have agreed that he should not be alone with my 7 year old daughter. My wife keeps forgetting when he's here so I am constantly having to check him so to speak. He is not allowed to use any objects such as tool that he can use as weapons. I only have so much time to supervise him and he and my daughter seem drawn to each other. I need some kind of a game plan to keep him supervised if the state thinks he's ready. I really don't feel comfortable with him around my daughter but he is family and I believe my home is better then foster care if or when it comes down to it. The state has already told us they will give us training and fill us in on his history after they decide he's ready to be released. Any suggestions will be welcomed.

My sister just also found out that she is expecting her first and is around 11 weeks or so. My Mom is making THE BIGGEST deal out of not being called Grandma, her name is Lisa and she wants to be called LeLe, she says we will respect her wishes and only call her this. I am so shocked, I would have never seen this as an issue to deal with, the babies aren't even here yet!!! And LeLe???? That is so silly. I told her to consider GiGi or Gammie or something along these lines and she literally started screaming at me that she will be respected and hung up the phone. I have so many things Im enjoying right now- feeling baby move all the time and such- that I am really annoyed at this. Anyway what do you think and do you think we should just let her have it? It seems that's with this and many many other comments from her she's not excited about being a grandma at all, and more like its an inconvenience for her. Please Help!!!!

So my son get's off the bus today and his lip was 3 times the size it was when he left this morning, blood all over his shirt and now with a lose tooth. I said what happened he said it was an accident and some other kid head butted him, now that I can understand they're boys and they play hard. BUT why wasn't I contacted? not that he needed to go to the emergency room, but it should have been just to let you know he has a fat lip. My friends son got a tiny little scratch and they called her now with as much blood as there is on his shirt and as fat as his lip is then that's far more worse than a scratch. Same thing happened with my cousins son he bumped his head and they said just to let you know. My son told me the teacher only made him sit down and put a paper towel on the desk, I asked did you get ice and he said no, if he had ice his lip wouldn't be so swollen and painful.       Now should I go into the school tomorrow and talk to the teacher and ask how come she didn't let me know this happened. I'm not going to flip out or anything but I am going to let her know that I am upset because I leave him in her care and trust her with his safety. What would you do?      BTW he is in Kindergarten

Well the one group was doing a presination on fetus rights and when the fetus is a "human". Well I raised my hand and said that I think that baby is a "human" when it has its first heart beat because that is when it is alive and breathing. Well then the one person from the group went on to tell me that you don't hear the heart beat until the second trimsester or something. I though it was WAY before that, I thought that at a few weeks after you concieve the baby has a heartbeat. I would not have said that if I would have know you don't hear a heart beat until you are like 3 - 6 months along. PS. I am 16 and I don't really know how I feel about when a fetus is a "human" concidering I have never had a baby and when I do have a baby that might change the way I feel...

She moves her head and arms constantly causing some discomfort.      I went on a brisk walk yesterday and had the light spotting at night. This morning there was a light pink color when I wiped.       I call the doctor all the time. I called and went in last week because I thought the baby wasn't moving. They hooked me up to a machine and monitored the heartbeat and movement both of which were great.

She decided to take another Tuesday morning (Equate) and it was negative...being that I read that tests with +/- windows have been inaccurate and detect higher hcg levels I told her don't worry...but Wednesday morning she tested with First Response again and it was also negative...what is going on? Is she pregnant or not?      P.S. She also had what seemed to be a shorter lighter period at January 2-5 which was 4 days instead of her normal 7-8. But ovulation kit said she ovulated on the 17th or 18th of December, so could this period or blood been implantation?

20090202103528AAd1mcN	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Egg implanting..cramps and TTC?	I have been having some cramps off and on for the past 2 days know. I am currently only at 5DPO but I am cramping and have like a pressure feeling in the lower abdominal area (around the ovary area and in between). Could this be the egg trying to implant? I got pregnant back in october but lost it 11/16/08 at 4 1/2 weeks and I had this feeling then as well but I don't want to get too excited. We have been TTC for 16 months and went and seen a fertility specialist last monday but we are going to continue to try until april or may on our own. This is our first month TTC since I lost the last baby. So do you think this sounds pretty good that the egg could be trying to implant? Serious answers only....thanks in advanced!
20090203144941AAvuJmj	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	What are my chances of being pregnant if...?	I had sex on the 19th, 20th, and 22nd of January. It was unprotected (he pulled out). I stopped taking birth control 2 or 3 months ago so I'm not sure when my next period is due. Since I was on birth control pillls I know that I was on a 28 day cycle but I'm not sure if that will change since I am no longer on birth control. My last period was about January 4th. I haven't gotten my period yet this month. What are my odds of being pregnant and is it too soon to take a pregnancy test? (just a side note, I have been with my boyfriend for 2 years so it wouldn't be a horrible thing if I was pregnant). I had cramps about a week ago for a week and I only have little cramps now if I am sitting down. Any insight would be great. Thank you!

20090203142456AAkubnG	Pregnancy & Parenting;Other - Pregnancy & Parenting	Spotting then early and short period- pregnant?	Hi All,   I was wondering if someone can help me out. I have a bicornuate uterus I have had an unusual month in my menstrual cycle.   A little history- I was on birth control for 9 years and went off in Feb of 08. (So I have been off for about a year). Sense then my cycle has been about 30-31 days and periods lasting about 5 days with 2 heavy days and 3 light days.    My last regular period was Dec 30th. I had unprotected sex Jan 23/24th. 4 days later I had spotting (Jan 27th). I have never had spotting before my expected period. It was there and then gone just as soon as it came. I thought it was implantation bleeding because then it was nothing. 2 days later I thought I got my period but it lasted for about 2 days and that’s it. Also this period came early… or at least I thought it was early. Having a bicornuate uterus how likely could this happen if I was pregnant? Could I be pregnant?

20090203143338AAO8F09	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Baby waking every 3 -4 hours at night. Help?	My baby is 9 months old and for the last 3 months he has been waking every 2 - 4 hours for a bottle, I have him on solids (he eats 3 times per day) plus has numerous bottles (between 3 - per day and then 2 - 3 at night) - so he is having over 1200g per day - more than enough for a baby at this age). At times he just wakes and goes back to sleep but there is ALWAYS 2 - 3 bottles at night.       I have tried to put him to sleep later, he lays in his cot for hours as he gets overtired and then I am awake until after 12 trying to get him to sleep..        I have tried giving him baby rice before he goes to bed and he still wakes.      I know there is people out there who say he is a baby, feed him, I do but I am totally exhausted.  I also try to sleep in the afternoon when he sleeps, but sometimes it takes me up to 4 hours trying to get him to sleep and by then I am over tired and I can't sleep.  And please don't tell me that he is a baby and this is what they do, if you can't give any real advise then please don't bother wasting your time.      My health nurse said that nutritionally, he does not need the night bottles but I can't seem to get him out of them.        Any advice would be much appreciated.       I was also wondering when he should grow out of this, has your baby had this same problem and if so, when does it stop ?      Thanx.

First my period started on the 12th of Jan. and ended on the 17th. The flow was normal and nothing seemed unusual. Around the 27th I started to have very strong soreness in my breasts. I have tried to do a bit of research but cant seem to find the answers. My husbands mother who is a nurse said it can happen because of caffeine however I don't think I have consumed any more or less caffeine then usual. My husband and I are not TTC but are not on birth control and practice sex on a regular basis. I read that it can happen to some women during ovulation however this is not normal to me. If this was the case how long does it typically last? I am now 9 days before period with still very sore breast. They are so sore to the touch that I cannot even lay on them without feeling pain. Also the last two days I have been having flu like symptoms such as fatigue and sore neck and just my entire head hurting. I am really stumped for answers so besides waiting it out to take a pregnancy test.. are their any other reasons to match up with my symptoms? Thanks so much for all your help in advance!

20090203145647AAwZ4li	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	What do you think of donor insemination?	I have recently found out that I cannot father a child naturally because of a problem with my Y chromosome, which occurred before birth and will likely not be curable in my reproductive lifetime (I am 40). My only option is donor insemination.  At first I was repulsed by the idea, but after some hard and serious grieving and a chat with my (excellent) urologist, I have come around to accept this option. My wife, who first proposed the idea, is now making a 180, saying that the kids end up confused and hating the p's, that it's like having sex w/ another man and a lot of other negatives.  She looks for donor horror stories on the Internet.    Please don't suggest adoption.  That road is not for everyone.
20090225063145AAvhc4j	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Is there a way to know if a man has only boy sperm or only girl sperm?	I have read that the man is the one who determines the gender of the baby.  Well, in my husbands family, only boys are born.  He came from a family of just boys, his older brother only had boys, we only have boys, etc.  However, my husband's father had 4 half-sisters (same father).  So, it would appear that both genders are in the family lineage, if my husband's grandfather fathered girls as well as boys.        But, I guess back to my actual question - is there a medical way to test sperm to see if it only contains "boy sperm" or what the ratio of boy-to-girl sperm is?

Although I was super hungry last week (you couldn't keep a hamburger from me LOL. I've also been very moody and emotional. I'm angry at everyone, agitated and I've been wanting to cry over stupid stuff. I also spotted last week but I figured it was from the UTI. I also am super sleepy but I keep waking up every hour and my lower back is killing me but I know UTI's can do that. I know it's too early to take a test because I have a week before my period is supposed to start.. I did an ovulation calculator (numerous ones) and my most fertile days were the times we "got it on like rabbits." Our only "safe protection" is pulling out. Could this all be from the UTI?

20090203143015AAtQN6S	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	I have trouble pronouncing my l's?	i'm 13 years old, going on 14, but i can't pronounce my l's! it's really embarrassing (I know i'm not a toddler but a lot of people who specialized in speech answer here)  I don't even know why i can't. whenever i try to say something with an l, it usually comes out sounding like a w. like, i love you sounds like "i wuv you", or, if i manage it, the "i" sounds weird, and love sounds like "rlove". i can only get the words sometimes when i speak them very slowly  Really sounds like "reawy" most of the time or "realwy" or "reawly", and when i try to say something with an l in the front, like the word "long", it kind of sounds like "uuuhlong" and the l sound doesent come out. it's kind of like in akon's song "Right Now (na na na), when he says love, you can't really hear the "l".  also, i used jenny's wonder how to, but i really am not sure about the hard bump or ridge behind my front teeth.  What should i do? it's not like i'm 6 and will grow out of it, do i need speech therapy, or do i have a speech impediment? it's only for l's.  or is it not that serious? (i prefer not getting therapy b/c it's expensive, and i doubt my parents would allow it)  and, how long wil it take?
20090203143838AAFeMHi	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	Going from 2 naps to 1: should it be in the afternoon?	My 17-month old son is a very good napper generally, and for many months has been taking a 1.5 to 2-hour nap at 10am and another nap of the same length at 2:30 or 3.  Lately he's been having a hard time going down for the afternoon nap, so I'm thinking that it's probably about time for him to consolidate to only one nap a day.        He sleeps fine at night, usually 9-10 hours or so.  He's always had a pretty consistent schedule.  I don't wait for him to act tired to put him down for a nap; I put him down when it's "time" and he usually nods right off.  Same thing at night.       If the morning nap is still going well and the afternoon one is the one with the problem, should I start making efforts to move the morning nap later and later so that it eventually is around 1pm or so and the 2nd nap is dropped?  Or would it be better to just keep the morning nap and drop the afternoon one? That second option could make for some really crabby evenings.       I know I can find out what works best for my son by trial and error, but I'm hoping there are some moms out there who have already learned from a similar situation and have some good advice for me.

20090225063916AAIGRqb	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Pregnancy Symptoms THIS early on?	My husband and I TTC our 2nd child on 2/19.  My last period was January 29th.  I am due for my period this weekend.  Probably 3/1 or so.  I ovulate later than usual, usually around day 20.  The day of and after we TTC, I was very crampy so I believe I was ovulating.  The past 2 days I felt a stretchy pull on my uterus that felt very familiar. I do not feel it today though.  I also woke up this am feeling a little sick to my stomach...but only very slightly.  I was still able to eat.        It's only been 6 days since we TTC.  Could my mind just be playing tricks on me because I want this to be true?  Or can symptoms present THIS early??  When can i take a pregnancy test since I'm such a late ovulator?
20090225063951AAqmnVO	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	How can I not feel so isolated?	I have 11 week old twins and I can't leave the house with them. The girl contracted bacterial meningitis at 6 weeks and I've had the infectious disease doctors tell me not to take her out of the house for several more months for her safety and everyone elses (except to go to the doctor). There are only 2 people willing to come over and help me, my brother and my brother in law, but not every day. I've lived here for 3 years but haven't made any friends in my neighborhood as I am the only woman who isn't the same religion as everyone else. They're nice, but just not interested in being real friends. I only get out for small time periods and then it's to run errands and quickly come back to relieve my brother who is intimidated by the fragile state of the twin who was sick. They both have reflux and get meds 3 times a day. Between the screaming from the reflux and the constant health issues, I feel like I'm going to go crazy. I can't take them to the park or join a group. Nobody wants to come over and my husband works long hours. He is a big help though when he's here and he's my best friend so I think that's why I haven't gone totally nuts. I'm also on meds for depression, but circumstances make it hard. Is there something I'm not doing? Even if you don't have an answer for me, some kind words would be nice, I feel so alone. Thank you.

20090203144302AA8Mkxe	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Stretch & Sweep or was it an internal?	Im 38 weeks pregnent with my first & went to the OB yesterday for a check up. I've had a really good pregnancy with no complications or pain - I've felt fantastic this whole time.   The OB I have (and hospital) is very PRO c-sections .... Im afraid that I may end up with one for the ob's "convenience"?      The internal exam I had yesterday at 8am was apparently to check my pelvis shape, how much the baby has dropped & if Im starting to ripen.       It was very uncomfortable/painful and I bled afterwards & had cramping until I fell asleep last night.    Was this an routine internal examination or a stretch & sweep??      As it was, my ob wants to induce me early or get a CS at 39/40 weeks ... I didnt understand her reasons because she was being 'vague', but she thinks Im going to have a long & difficult labour because the baby hasnt dropped yet (in all honesty, my belly is not that big and I dont think its a very big baby?) My ob says the baby is average for my size??       Can anyone shed some light on what is going on here?? Love to hear your thoughts & your experiences?

Her boyfriend does all of the following:      - Tells her that he won't go to school if they break up because the only goes to see her.   - That he'll kill himself if she breaks up with him.   - Hates when other guys text her or call her. He won't allow her to have guy friends.   - He calls her a pig, in a non-joking way.   - He tells her he hates how she dresses, saying she shouldn't wear low shirts, when she shows no boob what-so-ever.   - He always wants to be with her and because of that she gets isolated from her friends.   - He texts her constantly wanting to know who she's with and where she is. If she doesn't answer, he texts one of her friends or "Facebook chats" them.   - He gets her in trouble all the time because he comes over when she says no.   - He is forcing her to have sex, but she doesn't think she's ready.   - On Friday, he slapped her across the face after she tapped him on the leg.   - She was trying to open my locker but she was struggling so he shoved her and called her a stupid b****.      [I realized that she fit these after reading the February issue of Seventeen Magazine.]      Am I wrong, or is this perfect signs of abuse?      I showed her the magazine article and she said that she's thought of breaking up with him several times before but she's afraid he'll kill himself or hurt someone else.      She's my best friend and I'm really scared for her. I hear her complain about him more than I hear her say good things.      I don't know how to help..so can someone help me help her?

20090203150943AAlIygK	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Would it be selfish for an American man to hire a surrogate mother to have a daughter, no legal mother?	Would it be selfish for an American man to hire a surrogate mother in Ukraine to have a daughter, which has no legal mother, but a legal father?  It is only fun being a father if he has full custody of his daughter and can never be ordered to pay court child support to the mother as in Belgium.        He is afraid that if he gets an American woman pregnant, he has to pay court ordered child support, because she only wants his money.  American woman use man as sperm donors and a pay check.  If man are guaranteed 50/50 custody and no child support to the mother by law things will be different.

I booked a doctors appointment on the tuesday to talk about   my options. I had just though about abortion and that was it i feel a   little bit selfish now.   Im a 17 year old going to college in september to study child care and education hopefully moving onto uni in 2 years. Having a baby will make my plans all disappear.   My other half who i have been with for 3 years and 2months is going into the army in 2-3 months and i don't want to be the person who makes him stay when he is really looking forward to it.   Im not sure what to do atm i have got an appointment on monday the 9th for a scan do see excatly how far gone i am and to talk more. I do think im going to choose aboption because i can't see any other option adoption is not an option in my head because my sister is due on mothers day and she is giving her baby up for adoptin due to not in mental state to bring uo a child.      Im not sure of im making the right decision am i being selfish? Sorry to al those who are trying for a baby i don't want you to hate my because my other sister hates me because she has been trying for 7 months (she married) and i can't imagine how she feels.

Is this possible, because I really want a baby and Im afraid the spermicide will mutate my semen and I wont be able to get another girl pregnant ever. Im also worried that my girlfriend will get suspicious, and I cant tell her I swallowed a condom, because I don't want her know what I really do for a living. This is such a catastrophe!

20090203145904AAgurJj	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	I'm pregnant,I changed my belly ring to a pregnancy one but its still irritated, should I just take it out?	I am 22 weeks pregnant with my first child, I have had my belly button pierced for about 6 years now. About a month ago my belly button started stretching and got irritated, I got one of the pregnancy piercing rings for it that is very flexible and I thought it would solve my problem. However I have had it in for several weeks now and it is still irritated. It is red and hurts. I am taking care of it as if it was a new piercing because it feels like one but it is not getting any better.       I feel like taking it out but I am concerned that if I do, if there is any infection in there the hole will close up with the infection still inside. There is a very, very small amount of white "pus" that comes out about every other day or so, it is red and hurts.       My question is can I just take it out and continue caring for it like an open wound or should I leave it in and continue caring for it as such?       I plan on talking to my piercer about it but I wont be able to make it in there for a little while and I was wondering if anyone has had a similar experience and could share some advise. Thanks in advance.
20090203145853AAC0iO3	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Want to know if i'm pregnant...will skipping my last active birth control pill make my period start early?	I missed 2 pills mid cycle and my husband and I had sex every day that week...i've been having several symptoms and have taken a couple tests (out of pure anxiousness) but my period isn't due until about 3 or 4 days from now. I purposefully skipped my last active pill today in hopes that it will cause my period (if i will indeed get my period) to come earlier and put to rest any question that i may be pregnant! Does anyone know if this will work or will i get my period on the normal day? help please!

20090203150317AA4zvbW	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Why won't my 11 mo. old baby nurse to sleep anymore?  I hate having to let her cry it out!?	My eleven month old baby will not nurse before she goes to bed, or naps, anymore!!!  That used to be how I soothed her to sleep...now she won't nurse before bed, and she won't let me just rock her (she arches her back and cries), and she is too big for a baby swing...I would really like another option, instead of letting her cry it out, but I really don't see any...She is also allergic to dairy, and I really don't want her on a soy based formula...plus, when she gets in these moods, she doesn't want anything to drink...what is going on??  Is she just on a nursing strike, or do you think she is slowly weaning herself?  She will sometimes still nurse when she wakes up, or during the day, but NEVER before bedtime or naptime anymore!  I sometimes feel like such a bad mom for letting her cry it out, but what else can I do???  I just wish she would still nurse so I could put her to sleep like I used to!  :(    :(    :(
20090203053035AAJEecF	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Period like but pregnant?	Hello, I know this was asked many times but I still need to know! I was supposed to have my periods on 02/02/09 and I got them on 01/28/09 almost a week early (I've been regular for over 5 years, always 28 days). They were different, no cramping, not as heavy and I usually have pimples this month not one...We are trying for a baby and for the past 2 weeks I've been feeling nauseous, bloated, hungry....you name it I have it. I took 2 PT that came out negative but I feel pregnant. Could it just be my brain playing tricks on me since I want to be pregnant? I have a daughter but I didn't have any symptoms when I was pregnant with her so I can't compare. Should I go for a blood test or wait.... Oh and I keep burping which is really embarrasing!!! Don't know what to think. Thanks.
