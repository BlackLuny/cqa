I've grown about tired of the redneck, conservative south and am looking for a change.      I'm also considering Boston and Seattle, so if anyone has lived in either or all three of these cities your input would be appreciated!      1.) Which are the best neighborhoods? By best, I mean a walk, or short commute to great restaurants, bars and a grocery store.      2.) How is the nightlife? I’m not into cheesy clubs, I prefer bars, dives, hole in the wall type places.       3.) How is the public transportation?      4.) What are some must see and must eat places for a first time visitor?       Thank you!

20090131160112AAWfAlm	Travel;United Kingdom;Other - United Kingdom	How can anyone be happy living in the UK?	I cant leave because i have two children with a British citizen. They were born in the US, but i still cant just go home unless i want to abandon my kids. No woman in her right mind would leave her children.       Screens on windows and bathroom plugs. No screens on my windows, which promote bugs and spiders in my house, which also promote disease. Great and people wonder why others joke about the UK being a third world country. Okay well I'll deal I think. Something I can maybe take care of later in life (I Pray!) And add to that, that the cleaners aren't strong enough and antibacterial soap seems to be something never heard of but in one store. And wonder why people get food poisoning. And there are huge outbreaks.          I go in to the doctor with pain and history of cancer, and ovary cysts to be put on a waiting list of 6 weeks to get an ultrasound! I'm sorry I don't care what the excuses are God forbid I ever get pregnant here! I could have been with a child for all they know and it could of been atopic pregnancy! They didn't test for that till I freakin went to the hospital and even when the doctor asked me if there was a possibly I replied "anytime you have sex there is a possibly" because there is no birth control that is 100%. There is nothing I can accept and adapt to health wise!!!!! I don't care if the healthcare is free here. It is in the states too and I don't get treated that badly! Plus the fact women don't douche and this country doesn't even make any without going to a doctor. PLUS they don't have women go to the OBGYN every year to check it out and make sure all is well. IE no cancer ECT. And it's no wonder every older woman I run into has had a hysterectomy! Just as you are to go to a dentist every 6 months you should go to an OBGYN at least once a year. I about fainted when his mother told me she had never been to one after having Paul until the time she discovered something that had to have her womb removed. How sick is that??! And I told her that too!      Prejudices. I never knew the UK hated American's. And it shows too, I run into it all the time. I'm very near the point of faking the accent just so I won't be treated like crap!      No power plugs in my bathroom I won't accept. And should I ever own a house here in my own right I will put a power outlet in my bathroom. Why, because it's the brightest room in the house. And where   should makeup be applied? Yep in the bathroom. And that's also where hair should be done. I know the excuses of why there isn't one in there in the UK but I also know why there should be one, and the should be ones outweigh the not. And nothing anyone can say will make me not want to have a plug where one should be. Even if I die by it, I will stand by a plug in the bathroom. Not having one is the stupidest thing I have ever heard of.      he system doesn't work for you, you work for it. I find that the system doesn't work for you here you work for the system. So all the people that are working for the system are you and me.. the people not getting paid by the system. Calling up checking to make sure they do the job. In essence we do the managers job. Sorry but if I'm not being paid I don't want to do it. I have my own life to live and run I can't keep checking someone else is doing his or her job. Why they let this go on I have no idea. They should speak to the managers and let them know how you have to keep checking on people all the time. I however don't plan to keep chasing people up. I don't care how important it is. As I said I won't do someone else's job. I guess they had and have to do this ever since you can remember. Why should I accept and adapt to something that unacceptable? What I just typed up is being someone else's slave. Why should you do a job someone else is being paid for? If you’re not paid and it's not your job it's either charity or slavery and perhaps you see why I want my freedom in the USA back than to live here. Harsh but true.      Housing. I have to explain USA housing 1st so you can get an idea of   what the hell I'm talking about. USA house. Basement, 1st level, 2nd level and attic equals 4 levels. In this 4 level house you have a dinning room, kitchen, wash room, bathroom, living room, master bedroom, bedroom 1, bedroom2, and bedroom3. And a front porch (not enclosed unless lucky) and sometimes another bedroom and maybe a den. All these rooms are nice size. Nothing so small that the only thing you can fit into it is a bed and a dresser. Also in the USA houses come with closets. To not have them is something that would of only happened in the 1800's if not the 1700's. A house as I stated in a good neighborhood with central air would cost you 120,000. With a garage, and large backyard.      UK housing has one level maybe two. That's it. And on top of that you have to be attached to someone. You would have a miniature kitchen, bedroom, bathroom, living room, MAYBE a dining room, 2nd bedroom. And even then the cost wouldn't be as cheap as

20090131164826AAytoZC	Travel;Travel (General);Other - Destinations	Where do I go from here? Any ideas?	I am 48. I've been taking care of three kids, parents with Alzheimer's, depression and a painful back--bulging disc. I am going crazy and need to do SOMETHING with my life! Something for me. So--I got on anti-depressants--they are doing their job. I'm in a better frame of mind and they also help with the pain in my back. My dad passed away a couple months ago and my mom's new Alzheimer's meds are doing great. 16 yr old is still giving me grays--but, hey--he's 16. That's his job.      Details about me--I've travelled extensively, I've had over 70 jobs (yes, sometimes 2 or 3 at a time) since 15--most between ages of 15-30. They were learning experiences. Had a college journalism scholarship, left after first semester to travel. I had my own restaurant. Last two jobs were as a barista at the airport and four years as a weekly columnist for the newspaper. I'm good at many things and a very fast learner. IQ is around 140-but that means jack if you don't expand upon it. I can write, draw, do interior design, sell, speak in front of large groups, teach, know most all crafts, cake decorating, most computer applications, makeup artist, organizer, fund-raiser, and many other things I can't think of at the moment. All this yet I can't figure out what I want to do. I feel like a frumpy, fat, old woman. Last couple years has sorta taken the wind out of me. Any ideas?    Oh and BTW   Never been fired from a job. I have different resumes depending on what job I would want. If it was in the food industry-I used those type jobs, etc. With the exception of one job--I've gotten every job I ever interviewed for...

I've done some research on both cities, and am leaning toward QC at the moment, but am not sure if that would bore her or if there would be attractions geared toward youth as well. Any ideas?

Hey, I'm going to New York in two weeks time, and i'll be staying there for a week. I'm traveling there from England with my school. I know it's going to be very cold, but I have no idea what clothes to take with me. I've brought jumpers and new coats/scarves etc. Is there anything you think is essential for me to take?       Also, i'm going to be walking for hours around the city, so what shoes do you think I should take? Things like UGG's will get ruined if it snows won't they?      So yeah; all you New Yorkers, what do you wear on a day-to-day basis?      Thanks in advance!

20090131163822AA1SvbW	Travel;Air Travel	Is it possible to get free flights for good causes? fundraising?	me and a friend of mine are off to South America (Chile) for a couple of months this summer. we will be working in a community school and also in vineyards just outside Santiago. The primary reason we are going is to collect data for our dissertations for our degrees, as well as to work with the local communities. we will be trying to highlight successes and failures within fair trade, working with top exporters of fruit in the country as well as the local growers and pickers. unfortunately being students we are lacking funds and are fundraising to provide the children with enough materials to go to school and to provide the community with goods they may need. this brings us to the question of whether it is possible to be given free flights from big name airlines or any sponsorship?      thanks for your time, and any fundraising ides would also be greatly appreciated!
