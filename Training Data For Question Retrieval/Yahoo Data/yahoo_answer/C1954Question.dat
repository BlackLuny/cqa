My Ipod has all of my songs on it. I am wondering if I can copy those files from my ipod to the computer?  It seems to me that when you hook up to sync, it goes from what the computer has in it and then puts that in your I pod, not vise versa and  that would delete my whole I pod if that is the case.  Obviously I don't want to loose what I do have.  Can someone give me some info or a clue .  Thanks

20090219231623AA00tO3	Consumer Electronics;Games & Gear;PlayStation	Is Playstation Home safe?	I recently downloaded Playstation Home to try out and was astonished by the number of perverts who immediately ambushed my female avatar. I'm aware that I can report bad behavior or use a male avatar, but I wanted to know how safe Playstation Home is overall? Are other users able to find out your real name, email address, or other personal information that could be used to identify you? I know it sounds a little paranoid, but it's really disturbing when a pack of male avatars crowds around you and they all have the same questions: "how old r u?" "what's ur name?" "where u from?" "u have pics?" "u have mic?" "u have cam?"  The other day I saw a male avatar asking these questions to a female avatar who said she was 15. Frankly, some of the people on here give me the creeps and I don't see myself using this program much in the future, but I wanted to make sure that these creeps will never be able to find me.

I work for at&t Customer Service, and i've never knew there so many disorderly and crazy people in this world.      Customers throw a fit and throw there and attempt to throw there weight around, until they figure it..its not going to get them anywhere.   Some customers also feel that they should be exempt from all the other 80 million customers, they want rules of there own.      For some reason customers call in and feel that at&t supervisor are rich, yea rich like limo,plane,tux wearing, sky scrapper with there office, no!!!!!!!!!! the supervisors only make 70 cents more than a regular agent.      They've been watching CNN for way to long to believe that there actually speaking to "Cooperate Manager" yea cooperate, with the jets and big bank accounts, when in reality there only speaking to someone who's on the other side telling the agent things to have to stop from speaking with the customer.      Supervisors hate to speak to customers and not its not there pleasure, they'll tell the agent, tell the customer im not here.      About Government fees and taxes, they feel that a at&t supervisor can override the FTC and FCC, this doesn't even make sense.   Bassically they whine about every little thing and thinks that a supervisor can help them and think there speaking to a big supervisor and most of the times supervisors give the calls to pretend supervisors.

20090203114615AAQH2UA	Consumer Electronics;Cell Phones & Plans	Wireless or Pre-Paid plan for me?	Hi everybody!      I'm thinking about getting  a cellphone, but I can't decide on whether to get a 1 year contract phone or a pre-paid phone. I'm thinking of going with verizon. (ATT just sucks!)      But I was wondering if for me if it will be cheaper getting a pre-paid plan or a 1 year contract.      The cheapest contract is $39.99 per month for 450 minutes which is not bad. I don't care that much about texting as I will only want it for phone calls. I expect to use it 4 - 5 days a week and talk  40 minutes plus per day.      What are your suggestions?

20090203113808AAFcY4O	Consumer Electronics;Cell Phones & Plans	At&t says we can't buy the iPhone 3G at full price, but Apple says anyone can.  Is this true?	We are currently At&t customers, and have decided to buy the new iPhone 3G's.  We aren't eligible for an upgrade, so we know we will have to pay full price.  We purchased the refurbished versions through the At&t Premier store, but they were on backorder for 1-2 weeks, so we decided to go into a local store instead.  Upon arrive at the local store, the orginally told us that we couldn't get the iPhones without an upgrade or new account even if we paid full price, after looking up our account they changed their story and said we could get them but would have to turn in our old phones.  So we went back home and got the boxes and accessories and returned the next day.  Once we returned, they started going through the process of returning them..    When the At&t representative scanned the phone boxes, he said he couldn't find a record in the system of purchasing the phones.  This is because we originally went through the Walmart Online cell service to get the phones at a discount.  He then proceeded to tell us we couldn't return the phones without a receipt, which we no longer had.  So we left, figuring we would never be able to get iPhones until 2010 when we would be eligible for an upgrade, but then got the idea to call the nearest Apple store.     The representative at Apple told us that anyone with an At&t wireless account can purchase the iPhone at full price if not eligible for the discounted upgrade, and was highly suprised that At&t wouldn't do it for us, they told us to come in and they would be happy to let us purchase iPhones and would activate them right there in the store, and that we could leave with working new iPhones.    What is going on?!  Has this happened to anyone else?

My mom insists that she tried to text me and she got a message back saying my phone doesn't accept texts...apparently other people have been trying to text me for the last few weeks...obviously I didn't get them. When they finally got in touch with me, they asked me why I was ignoring all their texts. I asked them if they got the same message my mom got, and they told me they never got a message back from my phone saying anything along the lines of me not having text.       Did my mom get the text because we have the same service (sprint) and no one else got the message because they have a different service than me? Just trying to get to the bottom of this since it's starting a stupid argument and I want my mom to realize she isn't ALWAYS right...

I know the 2 lenses above are totally different,but I bought my Canon 40d with a 17-85 lens and was considering selling it and replacing it with the new 18-200 as the main everyday lens.   The reason I am asking for your views is after looking at many of the internet reviews they point out a couple of slightly negative things, mainly the lack of USM in favour of an older and noisier focusing motor.   So which would you all recommend,the 17-85 or 18-200?      Many thanks in advance for any answers.
