I don't plan on doing that anymore and I know I shouldn't have, so please don't lecture me on that. Now however, the scars are still there & rather obvious, they're kinda purple so you can still read it & everything. I'm going to be going to the doctor soon to get a shot & I'm not sure if they're going to give me a physical or not, last time they did. Meaning I would be in one of those paper gowns & the doctor would easily be able to see the scars on my legs. Nobody knows about them & I'd like to keep it that way. Now, my appointment (which I can't change) is in a few hours and I can't go out & buy anything to cover them up. I have some cover up but it rubs off really easily & I'm wearing jeans. I'm just really freaking out right now & need help please

20090131111328AAh9qyj	Beauty & Style;Makeup	Is this cleansing routine good for face?	I have suffered with sensitive skin always,and also ance now as i know partly or if not greatly caused by polycystic ovary syndrome. My skin has improved a little and i think this is due to using better products and medication that has been prescribed. I used to use alot of different type washes to clean the face of makeup and dirt etc but found some of them along with the water dried or made my face tight,also i was not completely sure if they were removing the makeup off properly,clinique says they believe in using a makeup remover first and then cleanser after,thats how there range is,plus i always go by what it says on the label if it doesn't include removes makeup on it,then i would use a seperate product or find something else.   I have now gone back to lotion cleansers like the type you wipe or massage over the face,i used to a couple of years ago use a tea tree cleanser,wipe over face and very little moisturiser,i never wore much or any makeup then and my skin was clear and lovely,this was back in 2005.      So i have been using body shops aloe range cleanser and toner,i massage the cleanser over areas of the face and wipe off with dry cotton pad,and continue until all traces of makeup are gone etc,i find it a bit time consuming though as i find if i massage it over the whole face at once then it evaporates very quick and i feel i need to use more and more thus being heavy on the skin perhaps,so i do seperate parts at a time,then tone and then apply moisturiser.   But i always read in the case of if you are using washes etc they say splash face with cold water to close pores,which i think would be good for my skin but then i can't do it as i use a non wash cleanser anyway.   I chose the aloe range cause its free of perfume,colour,soap etc,and even though not oil free isn't heavy or got oily ingredients in it. They do do a seaweed range for combination skins thats non drying and oil free,which you'd think would be ideal but it stings and irritates my face well mainly cheek area,and is also perfumed,so no good for me.   Would like any advice ,comments or experiences on my question. Thanks

It is when you have red bumps around your mouth. Essentially it looks like acne but it has this name, so I will refer to it as acne. It bothers the **** out of me. I know it's gay but I actually wear make-up now to cover it up. I hate wearing makeup. I can't grow facial hair, so I was thinking could I buy a fake beard that looks real and just wear that . Any ideas if that would be a good idea, and if so where I would get this legitimate looking fake beard.

I'm so upset right now. =/ PLEASE READ, I need help so bad. =[      Me and my boyfriend have been dating for almost 3 months and we like eachother ALOT. The thing is, he's always smoked weed, cigarettes, and he's an alcoholic. I told him I don't like ANY of that stuff and I want him to stop.      So he stopped weed, and told me he stopped cigarettes. I don't care if he drinks. But I hate cigarettes because I had to watch my grandfather die a horrible death from lung cancer, and now my 18 year old brother smokes. I hate it.      So my boyfriend told me he quit. A couple weeks after, I lied to him to figure out if he was smoking or not. I said,      "I've been hearing you smoked the other day." [I really didn't, I just wanted to get it out of him." And he told me he did, and I gave him another chance.       A couple weeks later-he did the same exact thing again. He told me it's because 'his life is soo fuckkkeeddd up and when he's not on his ADD meds, he does stupid stuff.' [Which I know is true,]   So I gave him ANOTHER chance.      Ever since then, I don't trust him with his friends. I never let him hang out with the ones that smoke. He looks me in the eyes every single day and tells me "I don't smoke anymore, you have to believe me."      So today, my friend Mike, told me that last week my boyfriend smoked about 2 or 3 times when he stayed after school to weightlift. Mike said he wasn't supposed to tell me but he did because he's a really good friend to me. I told my boyfriend I knew and what do you know? It was true.      I told him that was it. I broke up with him. And now he's telling me he made a huge mistake and he loves me more than anything. We DO love eachother, alot. And every single one of his friends is telling me I should give him another chance, but every one of MY friends tells me I shouldn't because they know how it feels to be a girl and get her heart broken.      I love him so much, but I don't know what I should do!!! PLEASE HELPPP ME. ]:

You gotta tell me if it's impossible or not to block the move girls use to smack a guys face where she stands with her hip out to the side, and then will put her hand on top of it standing there, then will slap the crap out of the guy with the other hand. Is there any way at all for us to block that move? I would've bet a thousand bucks i easily could've blocked a girls hand, from ANY girl, but this one who is a junior, she used it on me, and i was frozen the second she stuck her left hand on her hip. she got me easily, i can't block that. THEN i had a friend it happened to, and after she slapped him with the SAME move, i asked why he didn't block her hand(i didn't tell him that i couldn't), and he just said yeah, right! have you tried this on a guy? is that move unblockable? or not? and if not, then how do we?

20090225091249AAeVRwp	Beauty & Style;Skin & Body;Other - Skin & Body	My employer has told me to remove facial piercings...?	I have a tongue piercing and an eyebrow piercing, the one in my eyebrow is very small.  When I interviewed for this position 2 years ago I did not remove them, in the dress code policies there is nothing prohibiting tattoos and body piercings, I do not show off my tattoos or stick my tongue out at people to show it off nor do I play with it.  Most people don't even know I have them and have only seen the eyebrow piercing.  Recently I was told I would have to remove them, which I do have a problem with but will do it if I have too.  The major problem that I have is that this policy is being directed directly towards me, am I incorrect in thinking that if this is going to be the policy that it would have to be a company wide enforced policy and not just a request made to one individual?        Serious answers only, I don't need any of that why would you do that to your body stuff, blah blah blah.  It's mine, I do what I want and if you don't like it too bad.  And if you want to give an answer like that keep the following in mind...      The only difference between people with tattoos and piercings and those without is that people with body art don't look down on those that don't.  Judge me for who I am and what I can do, not whether or not I look like you.                            Author Unknown
