Here in the US, we could not sustain without fuel or electricity. We would not have a grocery store to visit because shipments would stop due to the truck not having fuel. We should starve to death because domestic farms are only sufficient for feeding people nearby. Cattle is raised in a completely non sustainable manner, causing soil erosion and water pollution.  In a poor country, one would farm organically because pesticides are not even existent. People take huge busses crammed until it is unacceptable and only about one car exists per hundred people. Wood burning cooking is the method of food preparation and pollutes less than a gas stove or automobile.   Capitalism robs the poor while the poor support capitalism|`|gYNDNXAkaa	Capitalistic Poverty.|`|PWe2uK2Qaa	?f you take a look at the thing with overall view. both of them are threat for the future of the viable enverioment. we should evaluate these two threats as whole problem. there are considerable amount of responsibilites which everyone should take in order to create viable enverioment for our future. capitalism will no longer maintain its existence as a result of the economic downturn. this severe economic downturn revealed that what take place in the usa and what affect the usa will be impression on the other countries without a doubt. on the other hand the usa has experienced that the war might wreack havoc on the the economi of the usa severly. the usa will be much more vigilant when it comes to making its moves. I want everyone to pay attention to the delicate balance of the world. the existence of the american troops ruined the enverioment of iraqi people. the ulterior motive of the usa was clear. the usa could take the helm of iraq by attemming military coup. then they decided to ruin the enverioment iraq. after a couple of years the price of the war has been really severe. it compelled the usa to face the downturn which has been hitting the usa effectively. The war and capitalism has been caused poverty and destruction. this conclusion brings particular results that everyting has indispensible ties with each other. you can no longer establish sustaniable world by escaliting the tension of the public. we all should seek for the ways of bringing everyone together regardless of their identity,religion,nationality,color of skin etc. we sh?uld belive that the only thing which creates hostility,friction,enmity,conflict is lack of connection between each other. we should be able to establish connection ties betwwen each other. we should not allow anyone to undermine the solidarity and peace of the world.
f64a2a4ada0fcb1ea5303362c0bca8efaa	First of all proof of global warming, is proof that humans are the cause, and that increases in temperatures will have catastrophic results.    From empirical evidence we know that there is a very good correlation between the sun, PDO and temperature trends.  Both the sun and PDO are in phases that should cause cooling.  If warming resumes within the next couple of years, I will reconsider my hypothesis.|`|pZi3HXdnaa	If the Earth would start warming again, and continue for at least a few years.|`|5T13u01eaa	i think maybe if you showed me facts, or any scientific video etc. just prove that will show me that global worming is true... something that is based on humans using or eating or needing to survive and that is disappearing slowly or whats changing that can affect us in the future.|`|5c127f052b6bfa757d067568c8afa6c3aa	In science a hypothesis normally requires supporting empirical data and practical testing that can be independantly verified and recreated. Once a comprehensive physics based explanation has been developed, than models can play their part.    Models once developed would need to be based entirely in known lawss of physics and must pass validatation and testing. Only once we can match the earths climate history with models and make future predictions that are accurate could we then identify any human signal.    Also important is falsification, ways in which the theory are proven wrong need to be considered and covered in depth. I scientist should always try to prove a hypothesis wrong, then if he can not prove it wrong and has exhausted every other possibility, the hypothesis is likely to be correct. This is good science, cheery picking data to support the hypothesis is wrong.     There are also many claims made to support AGW which are immediately contradicted. These issues need to be addressed, not ignored.    Most studies show a MWP warmer than today and most show a LIA. Mann and his chums work is in the minoirity, yet the IPCC dont consider the others.    Most ice cores show co2 much higher than today this interglacial, as does stomal data and chemical gas analysis, so co2 levels are not unsual and didnt trigger catastrophe when they occured.    Many studies based on empirical data (including works by Keeling and Revelle) show the co2 lifecycle is around 7 - 7.5 years, making the enitre subject a non-issue.    Why does the co2 growth rate anomalie follow SST and not human output?    Also important is logic, if co2 levels in the past caused no warming, then why would they today? Science is the explanation of that what is observed, proving that something that isnt observed exists is theology.     When the greenhouse effect was hypothesised due to a difference between 2 crude equations, things might be a little different if they had known about the laws of thermal dynamics or if they had considered an earth with and without a sea instead. This area should also be revisited and some attempt make to prove the effect exists, as AGW assumes it does.    Receding glaciers, ice mass at the poles, temperature record, droughts etc... are evidence of nothing as these things have always ocurred naturally, and it should be assumed natural until proved otherwise.    Unfortunetly like the big bang theory it will never be proven and it will be a case of looking at the evidence to support each theory and picking the one best supported by empirical data. For example we know the sun at similar levels this centuary to the levels that caused the warmer MWP, hence it should be assumed it is the sun again until proven wrong (as scientifically it is better supported by observation), especially when SST explains most the observed warming and the sun warms the sea.|`|1oxBCtmZaa	For one, a resumption of the warming.    After that, how about some direct, tangible proof of human causation?    At the very least, the models could actually predict something - this has yet to happen.   It's amazing to me that people whose models are so consistently wrong insist that "science is on our side."    If your predictive model consistently fails to make accurate predictions, then it does not accurately model every factor, does it?    Mountain glaciers have shrunk before - the Alps have had less ice during at least three periods since the last Ice Age than they have today.    During the MWP, Lake Naivasha in Kenya DRIED UP for 200 years.    Despite much greater use of the water, it has not dried up during this phase of "global warming."|`|t1zlbOURaa	Proof beyond a correlation (weak one at that) that CO2 is as effective as you say at warming the earth.    Explain the times that the earth was colder than now with higher CO2 concentrations.    Explain why the Maunder Minimum correlated with the Mini Ice Age, and the Medieval Warm period coincided with a period of high sunspot activity.    And... the biggie... make a prediction that is correct.    I've been making the prediction of much colder temps than normal for the last two years, based on the sunspot cycle, and what do we have? Much colder than normal winter for ALL of the northern hemisphere, and much colder in the southern hemisphere as well. Go figure.     I know Australia just had a heatwave, but I'd say the combination of snow in Baghdad, snow in the UAE, the ridiculously cold weather over all of north america, and the ridiculous blizzard in the UK kind of trumps a little bit of warm in Australia.    Edit:    I'm not the one who keeps carping about greenhouse gasses, specifically CO2. You guys do. If you were honest, you'd worry publically about water vapor which has the biggest effect of the climate, but even a fricking monkey can recognize that it's stupid to think we can control that.|`|XzhdKsPlaa	I will answer your last question first that's easy, as the population of the world grows so they drink more water, and when they drink it all away they then die of thirst, so we reduce the population that is causing global warming, there by bringing everything back into harmony?   Now to get serious, nobody has yet proved to me it is anything to do with human activity, it is just another example of the earth going through a warm cycle, and people taking notice of the stupid remarks of scientists as the weather has just bit back with the cold spell in England. (so bring on global warming) now there predictions have just been disproved. As they were when they predicted of the end of civilisation with the deforestation of the Amazon Jungle. In a few years time when they see there prediction's were unfounded it will die a death like all the other theories, it is Armageddon that will kill us all, not the ravings of a few "ex-spurts"!!   Please note "deniers"  is a unit of weight used to measure the fineness of silk that is used in the manufacture of stockings!|`|n6xqkPhXaa	I'd want proof that this agw thing is about science, and not a political left-wing agenda.      There's no question that it's driven by political motivation however, so I'm secure in my stand.|`|aWTo9K22aa	The problem is, skeptics demand "proof" in the way that we can "prove" a geometry theorem. Of course, real science does not work in such simple and easy terms. In that sense of the word, there is no "proof" either for relativity, the laws of thermodynamics, evolution, the link between smoking and lung cancer, even Newtonian physics--yet most scientific 'skeptics' of global warming have no problem accepting these things as fact.|`|5tpV7Jdcaa	Right on.  The deniers need to be made convinced that CO2 is the problem.  These ignorant Republicans and Rush Limbaugh are liars, ignorant, and mean.  I feel the planet's pain.  We need to get rid of these evil talk shows that empower the DENIERS.  Mark my words, you will regret it when massive hurricanes and floods plague us each year!!!!!!!!|`|kPG2g4iSaa	Although I don't consider myself a denier (which to me means that one believes AGW is a hoax regardless of the science) but a genuine skeptic, I'll answer the question anyway. Well, I'll answer a slightly altered version of the question because human activity is almost certainly causing at least minimal warming of the planet. "What evidence would I have to see in order to accept that I am wrong and that human activity is indeed causing catastrophic warming of the planet?"    Like Peter.Jungmann said: Make a prediction that is correct. I don't mean a "let's throw everything at a wall and see what sticks", but a comprehensive prediction that is correct *and* the absence of a plethora of other predictions that aren't. In other words, 100 wrong predictions and one correct one don't count. The prediction cannot be explained by any other cause, like natural climate cycles we all know exist. Ideally, this same prediction would incorporate correctly hindcasting the last 110 years of earth's climate history. Simply saying "It's going to get warmer!", or "The poles will be most affected first." don't count.    To use an example, when Einstein came up with his General Theory of Relativity, he made several predictions that would "prove" his theory. These included, but are not limited to, explaining the observed error in the precession of the orbit of Mercury, and his prediction that the same star would be seen in two different places at the same time during a solar eclipse. I understand here that this "Killer AGW Prediction" isn't likely to be as neat as the two I just mentioned, but it is a noble goal to shoot for. If the alarmists (*not* used as a term of derision) speak with a single voice and say "This is what is going to happen." and the world watches as their predictions come true almost to the letter, there would be no more debate.    It would also be nice if the alarmists could actually agree on and explain the causes of millennial scale climate changes that have been happening with amazing regularity at least throughout Phanerozoic time and all over the globe .    Oh, it would be nice, too, if deniers and alarmists alike didn't use Y!A to wage their own little cyber spit-wad fights and instead actually engaged in meaningful dialogue. Propaganda tactics that could serve as a textbook for totalitarian regimes have no place in a debate as important as this one is. You know who you are.|`|52otNiElaa	prove to me that the earth stayed at a constant temprature for millions of years simply because there was no human "activity".|`|VNRJnNr2aa	There is no such thing of Global Warming...        and I can back it up because earth gases are at normal levels       and if there was Global warming our own natural gases that are produced from the atmosphere will be altered and unbalanced.      there is no global warming in Outer space because gases alter      global warming gases with hydrogen gas             global Warming is from retarded understanding of natural gases        that can advert other gases that are dangerous to the enviorment        the earth is bi polar so how can you say global warming?????|`|84b16d97e7d42ff125bb26b44375be86aa	Some robust scientific proof.    At present all we have is models that can't predict the future better than a coin toss, but have been tweeked to hind-cast the last 100 years of climate.    For me the physical properties of CO2 do not appear conducive to anthropogenic warming.  CO2 absorbes a narrow range of radiation, the atmosphere is already opaque to that range and any increase in atmospheric absorbtivity implies and increase in atmospheric  emissivity as well.    (edit) I'd want proof that changes are actually caused by human activity.  The natural world is not static, it's always changing.  Whenever there is an observable change in the natural world, environmentalists are very quick to blame human activity, but the sea levels have been rising since the last ice age.  Some glaciers are melting, others are growning and the Earth hasn't warming since 1998.|`|5abd76da20906ffdd9c9409b83773dfbaa	How to talk to a climate skeptic ?

SYZQZGesaa	None of these theories widely posted on the web work. In each case, an error in how the total energy in or out can be found. I have duplicated every experiment and found this to be the case. A typical error occurs when not accounting for enthalpy from the warmer outside environment or the energy involved in providing the hot water in the electrolyte or taking advantage of heats generated from mixing chemicals. Faraday was quite right. 1.2 volts is the minimum ELECTRICAL force needed to split water. This number is never realized (and it would be 120% efficient fyi) because there are no perfect electrolytes. Typically, if staying in the realm of clean gases, KOH is the best conducting electrolyte allowing for about 1.6 volts at room temperature. Lower voltages have been witnessed, even by myself, and have lead to conclusions of "over unity". Again, they failed to account for enthalpy. Stan Meyer was sued and lost his case because he couldn't prove his "amazing discovery" in a court of law. At the same time, it is cost efficient to electrolyze water to get brown's gas for fuel. Reformation of dirty gases is NOT the best way.|`|sfC6L8ybaa	If you've done any review of Chemistry 101, you know that the required energy to split water is very large and there's no "secret" around that.

From a radiation perspective, GPS signals are much weaker than any other RF signal out there (in fact, it is in the noise).  So there would be no more danger in this perspective than, say, TV or cell phones.    The satellites themselves are a piece of debris left in space when the satellite is taken out of service.

Das sichtbare Sonnenlicht besteht aus Strahlung unterschiedlichster Wellenl?ngen, die ein Farbspektrum von Violett und Blau ber Grn und Gelb zu Rot ergeben. Das wei?e Licht entsteht durch die Mischung dieser Farben. Der englische Physiker Lord Rayleigh konnte 1871 nachweisen, da? das Sonnenlicht an den Luftmoleklen in alle Richtungen gestreut wird. Weiterhin zeigte er, dass die kurzwelligen Lichtstrahlen (also Violett und Blau mit Wellenl?ngen L=0,38 bis 0,45 m) an diesen kleinen Partikeln st?rker gestreut werden als das langwellige Licht (Orange und Rot, L=0,65 bis 0,75 m). Die Streuung des Lichtes nimmt also mit abnehmender Wellenl?nge zu. Erst durch die Streuung der Sonnenstrahlen an unendlich vielen Moleklen und Partikeln der Atmosph?re erh?lt der Himmel seine F?rbung. Die Reflexion der Lichtstrahlen an Gegenst?nden macht diese erst fr uns sichtbar.     Allgemein ist die Farbe eines Mediums grunds?tzlich das Ergebnis der Wechselwirkung auftreffender elektromagnetischer Strahlung (Licht) mit den Atomen oder Moleklen des Mediums. Ohne Licht also keine Farbe. Die Filterung des Lichts kann durch unterschiedliche Wechselwirkungen mit der Materie geschehen. Man unterscheidet Reflexion, Streuung und Absorption. Bei der Reflexion wird ein auf eine Oberfl?che auftreffender Lichtstrahl in seiner Richtung abgelenkt. Dieses Ph?nomen kann beispielsweise Wasser farbig erscheinen lassen. Streuung tritt an Materieteilchen auf, deren Durchmesser im Bereich der Wellenl?nge des auftreffenden Lichts liegt. Ein solches Teilchen strahlt dann eine gestreute Lichtwelle in alle Richtungen ab. Die Energie fr die gestreute - oder sekund?re - Welle wird der auftreffenden - oder prim?ren - Welle entnommen, die danach in geschw?chter Form das Medium weiter durchl?uft.     Ist der Durchmesser des Teilchens sehr viel kleiner als die Wellenl?nge des Lichts, spricht man von der so genannten Rayleigh-Streuung. Die Intensit?t des gestreuten Lichts h?ngt dabei vom Kehrwert der vierten Potenz der Wellenl?nge ab. Blaues Licht wird deshalb etwa fnf mal st?rker gestreut als rotes. Schlie?lich wird Licht von Moleklen absorbiert, das hei?t in W?rme umgewandelt. Dabei werden moleklspezifisch unterschiedliche Wellenl?ngen absorbiert.     Antwort:  Die Wechselwirkung von Wassermoleklen mit Lichtstrahlen ist nur sehr schwach, weswegen geringe Wassermengen farblos erscheinen. Mit zunehmender Strecke, die ein Lichtstrahl durch Wasser zurcklegt, werden jedoch immer mehr rote Lichtanteile absorbiert und blaue gestreut.   Letzendlich wird die Farbe eines Wasserk?rpers durch alle m?glichen Schwebstoffe bestimmt, z.B. Nordsee durch Tonkolloide (kleinste schwebene Tonteile).|`|22a1c76b8abaeacb8f76deabb9b36021aa	das blaue Licht ist das energiereichste Licht (fr das menschliche Auge sichtbar) Deswegen kommt diese Licht auch am weitesten in die Tiefe des Meeres.

Reines Wasser hat nun die spezielle Eigenschaft, alle Farben bis auf die blaue zu verschlucken (das nennt man auch Absorption). Die blaue Farbe wird dagegen reflektiert, also zurckgeworfen. Deshalb erscheint reines Wasser blau.    Vielleicht hast Du auch schon bemerkt, dass das Meerwasser nicht immer blau ist. Dies liegt an verschiedenen Stoffen, die im Meerwasser enthalten sein k?nnen. So f?rben mikroskopisch kleine Algen das Wasser grn. Treten Algen allerdings in gro?er Menge auf, so wird das Wasser grnlich-braun, wie etwa an der Nord- und Ostsee.
