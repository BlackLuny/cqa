20090203095915AAt1UBs	Health;Women's Health	Do you think the cost of fat grafting (for breasts) will go down in the next few years?	i've heard there is a rising alternative for breast implants that involves taking fat from another part of your body and putting it into your breasts, making them a l little fuller but still using a natural material. not only do i like the idea of using fat as opposed to plastic...but i believe it's more fitting for the type of enhancement i'm going for. which is not an increase in cup size so much as a filler to fill in a small portion of loose skin and result in a small lift as well. because it seems to require fat grafting it is VERY expensive....though once they've perfected the operation, i imagine a LOT of women will be going after THIS procedure instead of implants, so they'll have to make it affordable right? anyone have any opinions on this?

20090203100250AAVxq6m	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Allergies	I have the flu or a bad cold and need to clear mucous?	I need something to help clear out some of this mucous dripping in my throat.. Occasionally after a coughing fit it gets lodged right in the back of my throat. I dry heave and gag on it, loosening the mucous but not enough to come out, which really makes it harder to breath and more irritating (i can taste it every time I swallow). I have Sudafed but am not into taking over the counter drugs unless I am in agonizing pain (which I am not) and besides, that just dries the mucous up in my nose.       Is there something that I can do for myself to help get this stuff out- I know steam helps, um.. anything I can eat or drink? tea, wasabi, etc.       The reason I am posting this in allergies is because you probably deal with a lot of mucous related cases, thanks

Ok I am like normal but more masculine, but anyways, masculinity is something that turns me on. I can't stand effeminate guys. I just love masculinity. I like it when guys are into sports, loud, agressive, dominant, and just act like men. I hate all that planting flowers, decorating, etc. crap! I think masculinity is sexy. Anyways, I was wondering str8 guys felt the same way only about femininity. Do you guys find all that feminity attractive? When women are planting flowers, decorating, painting their nails, gossiping and all that crap. Because oddly enough, I've heard a lot of guys that rather their girls be into sports and be kind of tomboyish so it seems as if str8 men are turned on by masculinity as well

It looks a lot like this:    http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3150/2657...       Only mine is blue and brown rather than green and brown.      Please don't say anything hateful.  I'm just wondering if I have any company out there.  I've never seen anyone else with eyes like mine, not in person-- only in pictures on the internet.

20090219181311AAKXzub	Health;Mental Health	Things keep building up and I don't know how much longer I can hold on?	Over the past three years I have been on the edge of giving up and hanging on. It gets worse and worse as time goes on, and right now pretty much anything will push me off the edge. In a nutshell: an old friend of mine hanged herself a year ago Monday which I still spend every day thinking about, and I just found out today that a really good friend of mine who has been suicidal on and off since last year has been getting really bad recently. On top of that, schoolwork is really catching up to me now that the year is half over, with my grades are dropping and tests that I absolutely bomb. Of course those aren't my only problems though. And honestly the only way I have been able to cope up to now is by cutting, and even that seems hardly worth it anymore.       Seeing a therapist isn't an option, as I can't afford it.    I'm not willing to talk to anybody I know in real life about it either, as I've pretty much pushed everybody away.   I need some hope... please.
20090219181730AAECMqT	Health;Mental Health	My parents don't seem to listen, and I'm depressed?	Please read this before answering. I'm a 16-year-old, and I definately believe that I have depression. I always feel stressed when there isn't anything to stress about, I keep forgetting every little thing, I just want to sleep all the time and don't feel rested when I wake up, I can't seem to feel happy other than laughing when something funny happens, I'm easily irritated when other people try to talk to me or call me, and I don't enjoy doing anything any more (even hanging out with my friends who I love dearly). I feel like my life is really empty right now because I have an impossible time trying to focus on even school work or my writing, and I have no inspiration to do anything AT ALL. I also have a hard time thinking anything good about myself, which I used to be able to do. I often have random crying spells too. However, I AM NOT suicidal and do not want to be directed to an emergency hot line or anything like that. Suicide is something I never, ever see myself doing. I am also homeschooled, so please don't direct me to a school counselor, which I have seen many people say to questions like these. I have taken online quizzes (which are not always accurate, I know), and they all say that I have moderate to severe depression and beg me to get help.      I've talked to both my parents, but my Dad says that:      1. It may be caused by lack of exercise (I'm not overweight- actually very skinny, but I barely get exercise in) since he knew that even he was much happier when he was more active. Even if this is the problem, no one in my family does anything to help me exercise or get fresh air when I ask/plead for it. My Mom makes excuses not to take me to the gym or pool, my Dad is always working, and I'm not allowed to go out by myself. I can not drive yet.      2. He says that what I'm feeling also sounds like what a lot of extremely gifted artistic types go through. I do love writing/sketching, but this answer I am absolutely not satisfied with. My IQ is 127, but I've never found myself able to do anything special that someone else around me couldn't do much better. This may just be the depression talking, but it's the way I feel.      My Mom never gives me much of a response, and although she tries to seem genuine, she doesn't appear to take it very seriously. My Mom isn't adamant about it, but by the way she complains about her life and always finds a way to ignore the meaning of what I'm really talking about and start talking about what she's doing, it's not hard to tell that she's a bit narcistic.      Don't get me wrong. I'm not some brooding teenager who hates my life and my parents. I know I have a good life, but I just can't enjoy it at all. I love my parents dearly also, but they don't seem to be listening.      Please tell me what I should do. I feel utterly trapped, and I don't know what else to do. I don't need a pep talk (those never work any more, unfortunately), I just need to be guided. Please.      Also- I'm not sure if this even affects anything, but-   --I don't do drugs.   --I don't use alcohol.   --I am not, nor have I ever been, sexually active.

20090219190055AA3uQmU	Health;Mental Health	Why am I still feeling this way?	All this time my mom and this person/professional (embarrassing) she makes me see have asked why I'm depressed and I smile and I say I'm just stressed from school, even though there's more to it than that. But I finally admitted to myself today that it's more than college applications, I just feel so down about everything and worried about everyone and I don't know why. It's all so stupid. It's been like this for a long time though, but I can't ever tell people what's actually going on in my mind, I just feel like a burden and can't stop smiling instead. Maybe I also really don't like being out of control, I always thought I had disordered eating because of stress but I guess there's probably more there too. I don't know, I just can't stop feeling guilty for every little thing (nothing bad or hurtful or anything, just things I imagine I've done wrong currently and throughout my life).      When I look ahead at life it seems so long, and I'm so selfish to say that, there are people out there who are dying who deserve to live. I just feel like everything is falling apart, I worry that I did something and that my dad doesn't want to be close anymore, and I just worry about everything. I feel so bad for the world, and when I go out places I just feel so bad because I wonder what they have to go through or have gone through. And where I live everyone loves the city, and I enjoy visiting my family there, but in general it depresses me. Like there were these homeless men we saw and I just wanted to do more, like we gave them money and talked to them but it's just so sad. I just feel a layer of extra sadness there. Yet, how selfish is that of me? I'm sure not everyone is upset in the world. I don't know, I just feel worthless and I shouldn't be complaining.      By the way, I do pray and volunteer and always have (I know that's often recommended), but I don't know.      I'm not sure how to explain how I feel, but it's just more than what I said, but those were examples. Thank you so much for reading!

20090219183642AAg6oUC	Health;General Health Care;Injuries	SHOULD I GET SCREWS REMOVED IN ANKLE?	I had ankle surgery in August and got a plate and 9 screws put in. Doctor says over time the 2 long screws in my ankle will break. It is my choice whether to get the 2 screws removed or keep them in and walk around with broken screws (he says you won't feel it). He says you can possibly do further damage by taking them out (they may break in the process of taking them out or could shatter bone fragments). If they do break when taking out, the head will come out but the rest will stay in because there is no way to get to the remaining part. I've had an abscess and currently have an infection at the sight of surgical wounds. I could be risking getting another infection if going into surgery again. Also, that would leave me another scar. What are your thoughts on removing the screws? Are there any advantages to leaving the screws in? Is there more of a risk taking them out? I was getting them out because I didn't like the thought of waking around with broken screws in ankle (which may take years and years to break) but now I'm having second thoughts. Doctor also says screws has nothing to do with my immobility and removing can lead to weakening of the bone where removed. For example, fractures through holes where screws were implanted are not uncommon.

20090219183445AAmQR8c	Health;Mental Health	How do you cope with seeing someone you've loved for so long, be with someone else?	So, my ex of 5 years and I talk alot. Almost to the point of I guess making me feel like we could be together again "someday"...I guess that may be a little in part due to that fact that I can be naive, or maybe just wishful thinking, I dunno. Our relationship was always riddled with problems, nothing major, but enough to get the boat going on a pretty consistent basis.       Now, I'm a pretty mature person and can go with the flow of change, but I'm dealing with the fact that he is probably with another girl that he was with when we broke up for a few months a couple of years ago. I can't help, because of my own nature, to feel slighted, pissy, upset and so angry. I would never go up to him and make a scene about it, but I would love for it to just roll off my shoulders, to not even phase me, but it is messing with my mind. When I found out, my body literally started to shake in anger and hurt, as well as resentment towards him. We loved each other for so long, and still have love for each other, but not in that way anymore, but I feel like someone is moving in on my territory, trying to hurt ME in a way. I don't want to feel like this at all, I have too many things to deal with aside from this bump in the road. How do you stop feeling that way with an ex?...We were together since I was 15 and it just sucks that I'm feeling so angry, how do you cope?

20090219185027AAod64h	Health;Dental	Need a root canal, want an extraction?	My upper back tooth on the left side has a major cavity in it, and the dentist says that it needs a root canal.  She wants me to go to a specialist because she said she can't do it since it's in a hard place to get to.        I JUST got done with a different dentist who did a root canal on one of my lower teeth.  That root canal took about 5-6 appointments and it was awful.        I have really bad cold sensitivity on my front teeth and the worst part about it was drilling for all those hours with the sucky thing and the water making my teeth cold and really painful, plus for some reason the novocaine wears off REALLY quickly for me and I feel the root canal much sooner than I should.      I am paying about 700 dollars (more probably) for my other root canal and crown (WITH insurance) and I just don't want to pay for another one!  Plus it'll probably be a lot more or not covered at all since I have to go to a specialist.        Honestly thinking about going through the pain of another root canal just makes me feel like crying.  Now it's starting to hurt and I have to figure out what I'm going to do.   I know that if I get it extracted that my other teeth will try to move around and that the bone there might recede, but is it really the end of the world if I just get it taken out?  Are there other options?

20090219185344AA9ddO5	Health;Mental Health	Homesickness Part 1: How do I get over my anxiety.?	6 months ago I moved from Columbia, SC to San Antonio, TX. I moved so I could live closer to Austin and pursue music (my mom's family is in San Antonio too).       Initially, I was terribly homesick. I cried every night and was too depressed to go out especially since I didn't know where anything was. Even though I was staying w/ my aunt and had family all around me I couldn't help but feel alone.      Finally after 3 months, I started feeling better. I landed a great paying job, moved into my own place, had a guy friend, and even went home for Thnxgiving, but those good feelings ended right before Christmas.       The holidays were really hard. I couldn't even enjoy being around my family. I felt more alone than I ever have in my life. And even now that the holidays are over, I feel better but still homesick.      Now, everything I do and think about revolves around me getting back home. I try to remember why I moved in the first place, but that doesn't help considering that I haven't done anything here I couldn't do back in SC.      My lease doesn't end for another 7 months, but I want to leave in 5. Is it possible to be too homesick or do I need to just suck it up for the next 7 months?

20090219190045AAD67l8	Health;General Health Care;Other - General Health Care	Charge for urine analysis in California?	Hello everyone, I just have a couple of questions for those who are medical bill savvy. So, last month, my mother went in for her usual monthly "check-up" to get refills on her prescriptions, but the doctor that runs the primary care clinic she uses had instituted a new policy requiring all patients to fill out a 10-page form regarding medication use. They also asked her to provide a urine sample so that they could measure the effects of her current prescriptions. Now, these monthly visits usually range anywhere between 50 and 90 dollars each, depending on how much my parents' insurance covers. Today, she was looking through her medical bills online, only to discover that they had charged a whopping $1,600.00 for the urine analysis! Even with her insurance, co-pay, and whatnot, she is still required to pay over fifteen hundred dollars of this. Is this considered the normal going-rate for what (to me)  has always been a routine procedure? Or is this, for lack of a better description, highway robbery plain and simple? And, if the charge really is as outrageous as I believe, is there any way she could go about challenging it? Thank you very much for your help. Any answers are appreciated.

About two days ago I noticed a small thing at the top of my lip (its my vaginal lip and its right at the top near the clitoris). It looks like a very small pimple almost except pimples normally have a white tip when they're about to pop but this has a brownish tip, but its pretty small. It hasn't increased in size yet but if it does I plan to go to the doctor I was just wondering if anyone might have an suggestions as to what it is.    My boyfriend just had MRSA last week and got rid of it so I don't know if that may be it, the brown tip makes me think its not because it doesn't look like the bumps he had. I'm sexually active with my boyfriend but neither of us have had any other partners so I don't think its a STD or anything.    Any suggestions?   Only other information I can think of is that I'm on birth control (if you're wondering what medication I'm on) but I've never had any side effects like this.

She looked over the area where I think the pain is coming from, took xrays. She found nothing other then one of my crowns was hitting my bottom teeth wrong.   Today, i wake up with a sore jaw along with the tooth pain.   The tooth pain feels better, but still VERY sore when bitting down. Feels like I'm hitting something extra in my teeth.   My jaw pain is coming from the bottom of my jaw, in the area where it curves. Feels like its right there, behind the bone.   It hurts when I move my neck, when i touch it, when I push into it.   Any idea what it could be?   If I wake up in the morning with my jaw still hurting, I'll call my dentist. Shes closed now.   Thanks

I heard if you get addicted to nicotene, it:   makes your taste buds get weaker   increases matablism   cuts cravings   weight loss      What you recommend a specififc brand? I started on Marlboro Ultra Lights.      Caffeine.      I heard In doses of 100-200 mg. caffeine can increase alertness, relieve drowsiness and improve thinking. At doses of 250-700 mg/day, caffeine can cause anxiety, insomnia, nervousness, hypertension, and insomnia. Caffeine is a diuretic and increases urination. It can curiously enough make it more difficult to lose weight because it stimulates insulin secretion, which reduces serum glucose, which increases hunger.       http://www.rxlist.com/script/main/art.as...       I bought a small coke at mcd today and also heard it has a weight loss stimulant in caffeine, is this true also?      I do NOT Want to get anxiety, would it work best if i took just 50-100mg to help me loose weight and absorb information better?      Where can i buy these pills? should i start at 10mg and work myway to 50 and then 100?

For example say im lifing a book with 1 hand from the ground.... or sometimes pushups and or dips. it hasnt been an issue for swimming until recently, although it still doesnt bother me that much. Now i've started to do water polo and it bothered me when we were throwing/catching repeatedly (it's in my right elbow and i'm a righty).

I don't think it is hereditary because this would've started way back when I was little. (Now 17.) I also started taking YAZ birth control right after my 16th birthday. Could my accesive sweating be because of the birth control? I have not found anywhere on the internet about this being a side effect but I am wondering if it is due to the hormonal changes that go with the birth control.   Has anyone else know what this could be of? or Has anyone else had overactive sweat glands from taking birth control?

I had my gall badder removed about three months ago and I am experiencing aches in that area is this normal?   I had my gall badder removed about three months ago and I am experiencing aches in that area is this normal?   I first noticed a month after it being removed that I could literally feel a splurge of bile or something (hard to explain)at times come out of that area (since I don't have a gall bladder anymore I'm guessing it's my liver) Is this normal after the removal? Now I'm just experiencing a bloated feeling in my tummy and it aching where it was removed. OMG anf the weirdest thing happened when my husband was laying on my stomach my pancreas started pulsating it literally felt stronger than a heart beat ( my husband thought it was weird).Any who basically now I have ocasonal pains in the pancreas area and a dull aching pain in the area where the gall bladder was removed.It almost kind of feels like the pain that would happen before a stone would get stuck and try and pass. Any Ideas?      could that happen even though its been 3 months since the surgery?         eww every here and there i hear it make a little gurgle noise.                I got up in the middle of the night feeling really weak and a little dizzy. Now through out the day I feel a little nauseous that pain I described.      7 hours ago   I feel slight pressure and a dull pinching burning pain.The pain just started 2 days ago.         the pain isn't too bad but more less uncomfy. The weakness and nauseousness feel bad.      I'm reposting this because I'm worried and feel really sick now.      My eyes also are looking weird like how they did when I got Jaundice the day I had the emergency removel. WHY? Can this happen?

20090219214133AA8ZEvd	Health;Other - Health	I think I may have lupus, need prayer and/or advice...?	I've done tons of research on all types of Lupus and on other immunity disorders for a few years now. The decline in my health started when I had a lot of gastro problems. They were severe for 4 months and bad for a year but b/c I didn't have insurance I just tried elimination diets thinking it may have been a food allergy. Much later I found out that I had the pylori infection that causes ulcers and my doctor thought I was bleeding internally because my iron was very low. I was put on antibiotics for the pylori ( which I know is not considered serious ) and was given iron pills. My doctor also thought a lot of it was in my head (in fact I had to insist that he give me the pylori test) turns out the instincts about my body were correct. He had prescribed me anti-depressants before the blood work came back positive because he thought it might be depression but the anti-d's caused my gastro problems to be worse (yeah, I seem to be really sensitive to meds whether OTC or prescription. Anyway, at the time, ( a little over a year in a half ago ) this same doctor who tested me for h pylori (sp?) said in a follow up visit that because of a long list of varying symptoms (mostly related to the intestines) that I typed out on a sheet for him (and which I had been experiencing for over a year at the time) that I should see a specialist and get my insides examined to be on the safe side.       I had just lost my job and knew I couldn't afford to go to a specialist (G.I.) b/c I didn't have insurance and wasn't eligible for medicaid. (I had already spent about $1,700 at my family doctor's.)       Since then, I moved to another state and have free health care because I am so low income and I go to a local clinic. I try to get blood work every few months or so. Last time I was checked for pylori, it was gone (which was about 9-10 months ago). Two months ago, standard blood work was done and everything came out fine. My stomach/intestinal problems have gotten better but are still present. I feel achy a lot but the worst symptoms of all is being very fatigued. I get tired over the smallest thing whether it is a mental or physical task. This isn't some temporary situation. It's been bad for years now. I just keep waiting to get some big improvement so I'm back to my old self but haven't had such an improvement. I've told my doctor this several times but he acts like I'm a hypochondriac and never gives me referrals to a specialist. All he does is prescribe me more pain medication each time...that's NOT going to solve my problem! (Not yelling, just putting emphasis on the not). He doesn't prescribe narcotics but I know pain relievers can be habit forming and even the gentler ones are not good for you, have side effects and get to where they are not as effective once you start taking them for a while.       I almost feel like I need to fake some big attack for someone to take me seriously. I cannot work full time and the smallest thing that doesn't go right can really stress me out because my body and mind already feels naturally stressed all the time. I feel like no one understands and the worst part is, I'm right when it is concerning those that are closest to me because my parents seem to not have a clue about what I'm going through and can't seem to understand or accept the fact that I cannot work full time. I'm sure they are stressed about finances because they are struggling in that area but I can't handle extra stress right now or any stress for that matter. After all, it doesn't cost anything to be a little sympathetic and that free gift would mean a lot to me.      I am not depressed, I mean, maybe I am but it's all situational and didn't happen until I started feeling bad all the time, physically. I used to have a good job, a good salary and a nice apartment but left my job because of these health problems. I was just way too stressed. I'm only unhappy because of the way I physically feel but like a downward spiral, feeling bad physically has stressed me mentally and that has caused emotional problems in my life so it is an endless cycle of physical, mental and spiritual stress.       I try to eat healthy but have no money and am not eligible for food stamps because I live with my parents and they make too much money, (yeah, the government doesn't take into consideration all the expenses my parents have like food, gas, car, insurance, health insurance for the two of them, doctor visits, rent, bills, and the 9 medications my dad is on). They can barely afford to buy basic things for themselves, let alone me. So pretty much I'm stuck with whatever they buy and only ask for frozen mixed vegetables because they aren't very expensive. I don't drink alcohol or soda and have very little sweets/junk food. I'm about 25 pounds overweight at most which isn't much considering I have the fat gene. In the last couple of years I've lost about 10 pounds and have gained a little bit of muscle because I try to stay somewhat active and walk a fe

I've seen this question a few times, but not exactly covering what I want so:      I had braces as a teenager (I live in the UK), and it did my teeth the world of good. However, I've been left with a gap between my front teeth. If I went to the orthodontist, he would probably say I needed braces for both the top and bottom, but I wouldn't want them for the bottom teeth, as they're a little crowded but otherwise fine, nothing I want to pay loads to fix anyway. So would it be possible to just get the top brace, or would the price be fixed regardless of what I have done?      And how expensive are they roughly, I've seen figures around ￡2000-4000.

I dont mind the sound, but to be honest it interferes with my "social life". If I'm trying to kiss my boyfriend, it pops and he can hear and feel it. It hasn't ended any relationships but its very embarrassing. I would like to be able to go on without this loud sound popping as soon as I open my mouth more than an inch. Help?

20090219195933AAzyCam	Health;Other - Health	So... im 16. and Im wondering if this is normal.?	Recently, I've been having quite a few arguments with my mom.    We moved to a new town in december ( i had the choice to stay with my dad or move with her) so there's been many changes.    new house   no furniture   new school   tiny temporary room   having to make friends etc..   And a couple weeks ago i heard my step dad and her "having fun" if you know what i mean. and so i was completely grossed out by that. wanting nothing to do with them for a while. just wanted to be on my own and forget about it.    But my mom kept bringing it up at extremely bad times.    Like calling me at school   talking to me before school    And everytime we try to talk. about anything thats bugging me.   we end up fighting..       So I'll be 17 soon, and it seems childish to get upset over little things.    But is it normal to feel like your parents suck? Like everything that they do to try and please you is only for them? Cause i've never felt that way before.    She wants to send me back home, or she thinks i have some mental issues    and i feel like its because im not this perfect little girl who has emotions and gets annoyed by her parents..       so yeah. it might be a lame question,    But is it normal for a 16 (almost 17) year old to have so many arguments with her mom. well its only been like 2 maybe 3 since we've moved. they never used to happen really.

I got horrible horrible horrible[!!!] stomach pains that felt somewhat like the worst cramps ever. I then had to go to the hospital a few days later because it hurt so much I couldn't sleep or do anything at all.    Last Month, my period came 2 days early. And I got my horrible horrible stomach/cramps pain back again.   This month, my period came 3 days late. I got it last night and I woke up crying because the pain hurt so much. I put a heating pad and took some advil but it didn't help until I took NyQuil to help my cough. and that made my tired. Today in my class, they came and I almost started crying.

20090219210222AAb1QB2	Health;General Health Care;Other - General Health Care	I feel tired all the time?	I am mostly tired every day, I haven't felt really energized in a good month and that was only a little spurt before I felt tired again.      Honestly I don't get alot of exercise, I walk maybe for an hour outside every couples days and than of course there's always my gym class (;-;) to look forward to.       I go to sleep around 12 every night and it takes me atleast an hour to get to sleep, I usually wake up maybe 3 times through out the night usually going back to sleep pretty easily. I'll wake up at around 8 and get home from school at 4 and if I don't take a nap I'll just feel numb through out the day.      The thing is so much of my day is taken up by school it really stresses me out. I feel as if when I get home my day is just starting yet I've already been awake and sitting around for a good 7 hours. Which is why it really bothers me when it's time to go to sleep. I just keep thinking where has the day gone?       Anyway a few days ago I took my nap at around 9 and actually slept the entire night through which is probably the most sleep I've gotten in a while that wasn't on a weekend (I usually sleep 10-12 hours on those and have no problem. It's just on school days that I feel really out of it.)      Anyway I do remember waking up in the middel of the night and not being able to get back to sleep for an hour or so but it was still a good thing for me and at the end of my last class my far sight was literally blury. I was getting a dose of what it was like to need glasses, my eyes were so messed up.   Sometimes I feel like my body is tired but my mind is awake and others times it's switched around.      Anyway x3 after that very bad story, have you ever had sleeping problems and how did you deal with them?   (I heard that sleep medication make it so you don't dream?)

20090219212942AAIfc7F	Health;Men's Health	Fecal smell especially when in school and extreme gas cramps when not passing gas for a short while.?	I recently got to smelling of feces. For some reason I can't get rid of it. I have had it for 2 weeks now and I feel embarrassed and uncomfortable around other people.      I eat a healthy, all-organic diet. The only meats i eat are fish and chicken and the occasional, once a month beef. Every morning I take a shower, put on deodorant, eat cold oatmeal with grapes, walnuts, plain wheat n' bran, nonfat and organic yogurt, and organic skim milk. For lunch, I always eat disgusting school food which i have eaten for 4 years though. It is the usual cheap stuff a school sells for $4. In the evenings I eat with my family. We usually eat very healthy food. I do not eat candy and only eat a small amount of chocolate every month. Every 3rd week i have a bowl of ice cream.      The smell usually starts right after getting out of the shower. I smell it in my whole room after getting out. I smell it on the way to school in the bus for one hour. In 1st period it continues and in 2nd period as well. My nose has blocked out the smell by break or it stopped somehow. Yet, it returns in 4th and 5th period and sometimes 6th.      I also receive extreme gas cramps by 1st period. I keep them for the whole day and it feels like my colon is about to explode in 6th period. I have not gone to lacrosse practice for 2 days in a row due to this.   I am scared to silently pass gas because it may become loud on the hard, plastic seats.      I plan on seeing the doctor next week about this.      My mom is a nurse and she tried to see what was wrong but she couldn't find anything. I also noticed that when I push down on my bladder it feels a little bit uncomfortable. Also when I push down a little on where my appendix is located, I get a more painful pain.      Please help, this is making my days very unenjoyable and embarrassing...

I'm 110. so i was trying to get down to at least 105 to let my abs start showing. then i reduced it to 100 for the heck of it. so, i need to lose 2 lbs a week by spring break. which is 5 weeks away. so here's my diet. don't tell me it's unhealthy. I really don't care. i still eat, i don't puke, nor shat myself to death. sorry if you find that offensive.... = /   but uhm, I only take in 300 cals a day. which before the diet it was only 600-800, so i'm cutting it about 60% or so. But on top of that, i run 15 minutes, i do 25 push ups, 30 crunches, 75 jumping jacks, 50 ab wheel crunch things, and whatever else i add in tomorrow. every other day my routine changes.what i just said was day one. day two is more aerobics. i haven't looked at the routine much, but i pulled it out of a magazine & it said that it worked on 81% of girls my age, that were trying to get the beach body. so yeah..   think it'll work? i take in alottt of water too.   && i'm 16 btw.

20090219220509AA4jdpG	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Other - Diseases	What could I do about my uncle who lives with us that is burning himself with a cigarette  to help other pain?	He has trouble going to the bathroom. He has had this problem for six years now. He has seen many doctors and specialist that believe it is nerve damage. He's an alcoholic, he's been in recovery only slipping twice in the last eight years. They put him on all kinds of medicine. His primary doctor doesn't want to prescribe pain meds anymore and wants his pain management doctor to handle all that...only they don't write narcotics. He has a severe case of OCD, from the time he wakes up in the morning usually between 4 and 5 until the time he goes to bed at 10 he sits in the kitchen and reads. That is all he does. Last night he said he called his doctor and told her that the pain clinic won't prescribe anything...she said she was going to get in touch with them...anyway, he then told me look i'm burning myself so i don't feel that pain. When I said he has trouble going to the bathroom, i mean moving his bowels....although i know he has been going.
20090219220902AAT04pE	Health;Mental Health	SHOULD I END IT ALL!!!!?	Living is a drag. I just don't feel any motivation any more. I've lost interest in a lot of things I used to be interested in. I have no direction in life. I'm not really good at anything. I can't make friends with anyone and I have no friends. There is no communication between my family. I don't really see any options for me. Talking to anyone isn't going to help me because I can't think of things to say or explain myself thouroghly. Medication isn't. I also have really bad social anxiety where I can't keep eye contact with anyone. Every one thinks I'm a creep. I walk like a creep. Everywhere I go I just can't stand the anxiety attacks because all my muscles cramp and I can't think at all. And I get rapid heartbeats. I don't see any hope for me. There is basically nothing I can occupy my mind about but only an escape route from all this pain. I don't see a future for me. Everyone around me seems to be having the time of their life. I've tried getting interested in things, I've tried a lot of things, but nothing seems to work. Now the only question that  remains is should I live and be unhappy and just a walking zombie for the rest of my life and bring everyone around me down, or should I end it all so I don't have to deal with this **** anymore?

This is sort of a while away but I am a freshman in high school and our orchestra group which I am in is going to Branson on April 2 to April 4. My mom is going to be one of the parents going. Anyway my last period started Feb, 5 and my cycle is regular and they are usually 28 days apart sometimes a day or so early of late. But I'm worried that I will have it around the time of the trip and when I start I get cramps and I sometimes feel little nauseous but don't actually throw up. I usually have to pee a lot too so I'm worried about that and being able to change my pad or tampon enough. I plan to take midol with me but I am worried about my other problems. Also we have to share 4 girls to a room and that means 2 girls to bed and I'm worried about staining the sheet. Anyway I know it's awhile away but I want to figure out now what I should do. Also we will be in Silver Dollar City for a day. Please give some advice it will be greatly appreciated. Thank you.

Hey im 14 years old. i have semi-long hair. ive heard people saying its normal for people to "shed" their hair (that is, have some hair fall out than grow back in. however, when this happens to me, when i examine the hair sometimes, at the end, i can see this little dot that looks like the root of my hair. i was just wondering, when you "shed" hair, does the hair just snap off or, like me, come out at the root? please answer i am very worried-   much appreciated, kevin

20090219190052AAve4UR	Health;Dental	Wisdom Teeth Removed?	I'm 14 years old, and have to get my wisdom teeth removed this year. X-rays have already been taken, and my consultation is tomorrow. Does anyone have any information about this procedure? I'm with Gentle Dental.   So, I've looked around online, but most of the information is for adults or an impacted tooth. Since i'm only 14, and my mouth is just simply small, no other medical problems, that isn't very helpful. I have to get them out though, soon, and i'm nervous and not sure what to expect. It will be surgical, so here are my questions:   1) anything on the procedure   2) the pain and recovery?   3) what hould i do before and after?   4) best way-should i be out or just local anesthesia?   Even if you got them removed at a later age, any information will be helpful.   Thanks!

I am about 5'11, 160lbs, I normally run about 5 miles twice per week but i am currently recovering from the Disney World Marathon and have not run in a few weeks.  I am currently taking Adderall for ADD, drink about 50oz of water a day, drink about 20 beers a week(college student) and do not smoke cigarettes.  I smoked a small blunt and joint that was probably equivalent to about a gram of personal inhalation because it was passed around.  Any answers would be greatly appreciated and if you don't have anything positive to say, please leave your negative feedback on another post.  While everyone has different views about this issue, voicing a negative opinion here does no good.  Thank you.

My doctor was sugesting a second surgery and I was sent to an IME and FCE but I do not have the results yet.  In the mean time, I went to another doctor, had an MRI and looked for a second opinion.  This doctor says that the surgery will not do anything for me, suggested some physical therapy (which I had waaay to many), and another exploratory surgery.  But he says that my condition pretty much is irreversible.  So I guess I just will have to live with the pain.  How do I know if I have reached maximum medical improvement(MMI) ? Or how is the permanent partial disability(PPD) or permanent total disability(PTD) been set ?

20090219184632AAdrkSq	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Other - Diseases	Experiencing Frequent Headaches?	Alright, firstly let me explain some background information about this.      I've suffered roughly 2-3 migraines throughout my life (19 years of age) and am a common sufferer of headaches. One of the migraines i had was so severely painful that after laying down i passed out for a few hours before waking up to a clear head.      Now to the situation:      Roughly 2-3 weeks ago i experienced an extremley uncomfortable series of events which included a throbbing pain sensation in the left hemisphere of my brain, accompanied with slurred speech, loss of coordination, balancing difficulty and an in-ability to think ahead or backwards in time. Im familiar with the abilities the left hemisphere of the brain is responsible for.. and the symptoms seems to conclude that something wasn't functioning right in my left hemisphere.      Of course, after experiencing these symptoms i went to the emergency department of my hospital as soon as i could and told them exactly what happened, i was seen by 4 doctors.. who all performed medical examinations of my hand-eye coordination, muscle tension and sense's... i was completely fine at this point, and the senior doctor concluded that it sounded like i experienced some form of a complex migraine..      He said they couldn't do anything else unless they ran a brain scan.. but there's a 1/10,000 chance of me receiving brain cancer due to the radiation used.. he weighed out the odds and the seriousness and figured it wasnt serious enough to run the risk.      Fast forward to now.. and im still experiencing 'normal' headaches in different parts of my brain.. mainly the left hemisphere.. this is really starting to concern me that i might have a tumor.      I also went to the doctor last week and had my arm checked because it felt like a lack of blood flow to my arteries.. the doctor concluded that it sounded more like a nerve irritation.      Now i understand migraines and to some extent headaches can possibly narrow or widen the blood vessels in your brain, it could be that im not receiving sufficient blood flow to my left hemisphere which is causing it to play up.. i'll sometimes slip in and out of concentration which is a direct result of the left side not functioning as it should be, since it process's information linearly.. numbers,logic,patterns and puts them in order..      Bit of a long post i know.. it's a serious concern of mine.. i will most likely be trying to arrange for an MRI scan, i really need peace of mind.. especially with something like this.      Anyone's thoughts on what it might be, whether the doc's are probably right and im over-worrying about something which is probably just a coincidence of events?

At this time I felt great, I live a very healthy life for the most part sometimes more then ever but i was feeling great.  we are together 24/7 and about 7days into i woke up with it very bad..I had a terrible cough and a 104.7 fever.  I normally run a very low grade fever.  fever lasted 3 days around 103 then another 2 weeks over 99( normally a bad fever for me) it was gone fully for prob 2 days at most, I have no med insurance so took penicillin and needed to take 800mg just to budge the fever, and cough syrup. I have been feeling very tired lately and having some headaches sometimes at night and my eyes burn(i do wear contacts) but they feel like "fever eyes". take temp yesterday 100.0 today am 97.6 then 10:30 99.8.  I know more info and total background would be needed but i have any info to add if anyone has any ideas.

She called her doctor this morning, and she said that she was going to give her more pills with higher potency, and see if it works, and she said that if that didn't work either she was going to get her uterus removed in Mexico because she doesn't have insurance here, and it's cheaper over there. Is there any help for my mom, and recommended pills, has this happend to anyone? Please help!

Sometimes they're visible, sometimes they aren't. They aren't actually scars because I've never got any there. Occasionally my left knee will hurt and it seems like one of the lines is indented into the skin. I guess it's rubbing it and that's what makes it hurt. They're mainly visible when my knees are locked. Does anyone have any idea why I have these?

20090219200901AAyxeYT	Health;Men's Health	What causes kidney stones?	I heard it is from excessive sugars from junk foods is this true? Plus, I heard that drinking water and sometimes cranberry juice also helps eliminate this problem, and another benefit is that it reduces enlargement prostate in men. I don't have kidney stones, even though I wondered about kidney stones in general so I thought I'd ask. However, I didn't go to the doctor yet but I believe I might have enlarged prostate because I feel a throbbing feeling inside of me over top of my anal area and it's NOT ANYWHERE located in the scrotum area, so I know it's not my testicles. I believe it's the prostate. Are these one of the symptoms for enlarged prostate? Will drinking water and cranberry juice shrink it to size, if that is the problem of the throbbing and pulsating feel, it's a little bit on my left side located where I stated earlier.

They looked like mosqueto bites, were about the size of a quarter, itched very badly, and had little raised (like poison ivy) bumps on top. At first I though they were poison ivy, though it is winter and I have no clue how I could have gotten it. Then I thought maybe some sort of bug was biting me. I got some Calamine lotion and treated them and they are almost healed. The other day I woke up and had some more bumps develop, one on each leg (opposite sides) and some on one foot. Like I said they itch very badly, and when I scratch them (though I try very hard not to) they ooze. What could these be? Why do they go away then new ones come back? It is wierd they pop up over night. Someone mentioned bed bugs to me, but I wash my bed sheets etc every week.

I am constantly subject to people saying "oh she's your mom, don't say that." or "that can't be true." Well then, why they heck would I say it.    For a period of time, I took to telling people that I was an orphan, made it easier on me. But I don't feel that quite cuts it.    I was raised by a single teenaged mom. A crazy woman. In the end she tried to kill me, I was removed from her home and lived in a group home until my 18th birthday. Then I moved out on my own, got 2 jobs and started putting myself through college.    2 years ago I decided I wanted "the university experience." So I graduated community college and transferred to a big out of state university in the south.    Major depression hit when I realized I was surrounded by people with good loving parents who paid for everything for them. These people can not possibly empathize with me. They have no idea what life would be like without their cushy loving parents they were so lucky to be born to.    What do I do? It's eating away at my insides. I am so sick of people telling me to forgive and make up with my mom.

I used to smoke cigarettes, but then I swapped to smoking only from a shisha pipe, thus reducing the harshness of the smoke,although I never get smoker-coughs at all and I don't loose my breath easily when I have to do exercise even though I don't exercise regularly. I am fairly short and skinny and live next to the sea. I know all of these contribute to having a small lung capacity, are there any ways I can increase it?
20090219194345AAKlQsY	Health;General Health Care;Injuries	What does the doctor mean by "full leg cast"?	I hurted my leg last night when I slipped on the stairs.  The ER doctor told me that he saw a fracture in my lower leg, but he just wrapped my leg up in splint and told me to go see the specialist asap.  He mentioned that I might need surgery and/or be putted into a full leg cast.  What does he mean by "full" leg cast?  Does a 'full cast' mean that it will be those plaster casts that I cannot remove, instead of a splint?
20090219202204AAfpqif	Health;Other - Health	Ear problems - please help!?	About two weeks ago I went to the doctor with a really really bad earache. I was given drops, told I had swimmer's ear (not from swimming) and told to come back in 5-7 days if my ear didn't get better.      So 7 days later I go back and now both my ears are sore. Doctor tells me they are "dry" and says put olive oil in them.      I tried that for a few days (hesitently) and no success.      So my ears and jaw still hurt a bit and my ears are popping a lot.   Is something worse going on? The doctors dont seem that helpful      Advice is appreciated

I don't like using children's vitamins because they get kinda nasty (especially the chewy ones), but I take them because I'm afraid of over-dosing on vitamins. The reason being is because I'm pretty much the height and weight of the average 13-year-old lol (I'm 5'1, 95 lbs and 18-years-old). Like medicines are based on weight (at least the children's ones), I thought it would be the same rule for vitamins. So back to the question - can I take the regular Centrum?

I heard if you get addicted to nicotene, it:   makes your taste buds get weaker   increases matablism   cuts cravings   weight loss      What you recommend a specififc brand? I started on Marlboro Ultra Lights.      Caffeine.      I heard In doses of 100-200 mg. caffeine can increase alertness, relieve drowsiness and improve thinking. At doses of 250-700 mg/day, caffeine can cause anxiety, insomnia, nervousness, hypertension, and insomnia. Caffeine is a diuretic and increases urination. It can curiously enough make it more difficult to lose weight because it stimulates insulin secretion, which reduces serum glucose, which increases hunger.       http://www.rxlist.com/script/main/art.as...

Is it easily fixed?      and can it have something to do with heredity... both my sisters have "issues" with there kidneys and doctors in the past have found protein in there urnie.

When I got my braces off, my parents told me I could get one of those invisible retainers. Unfortunatley the doctor ordered the wrong kind, and I ended up with the classic metal and plastic style. And I was really upset. So I decided to rebel and not wear my retainers. Plus I was so embarrssed by them, I started to wear them all the time-- except at school. I would come home and wear them so that no one could see me.      THE MISTAKE:   Well now it has been almost five months, and (I have seen a tiny bit of shifting up until now-- but only a tiny tiny bit) suddenly, I had woken up and this one stupid tooth in the lower back left has shifted all the way around!!! Now my smile looks horrible and it's all because I was angry at a dentist!!!      My ISSUE:   look, I need to fix this: It's one tooth, but it's one tooth that has completely messed up my smile. My parents have already said no braces. I can't have them again.(Not that I want them). So what should I do? I was thinking about trying to convince them to buy me some invisible retainers and I could help pay for them, I only really need a bottom one anyways.... So can I fix this without braces? What would you do!?!? I am so scared it really bothers me and I just don't feel confident enough to smile, please tell me what you would do, I could use some advice!!!!

I was wondering if anyone knew the on a percentage scale, what's the chance of it going away all on its own? And sources too.      For me, I never had a tramatic experience that has caused me anxiety or anything, I just have a lot of anxiety, and It just really increased over christmas, and ever since Dec. 29th, I think i've had depersonalization.      So I was wondering, what my odds may be? On an opinion bases.   10 points to best answer and any additional information.

Including Headaches, nausea, sore throat, sore muscles and constant fatigue. I went to see a doctor and she told me that I have the cold. Two months after being sick I discovered sores all in my mouth. The doctor gave me medicine for Thrush. A few days later my tongue swelled up in the back. An hour later it was closing my throat and I wasn't able to breath. I got to the hospital and they told me I had an allergic reaction. But I didn't eat anything all day and I am only allergic to penicillin. They gave me meds and sent me home. I was tested for mono because I had all the symptoms for it. Came out negative. Two days later my mouth was swelling up again and back to the hospital. They are still convinced it's from something I'm allergic to. But each time I was in a different place, didnt eat anything close to the time it occured. They only thing they found was that my white cells are a little elavated which means there is an infection somwhere but I've been tested for so many things that are coming out negative. I have been in and out of the Emergency Room several times. They can't figure it out. Some say that it's my anxiety that causes it. But it's the other way around. I'm paranoid to fall asleep now. I really need some fresh help on this please!

I posted earlier under another catagory and got no help      About two weeks ago I went to the doctor with a really really bad earache. I was given drops, told I had swimmer's ear (not from swimming) and told to come back in 5-7 days if my ear didn't get better.      So 7 days later I go back and now both my ears are sore. Doctor tells me they are "dry" and says put olive oil in them.      I tried that for a few days (hesitently) and no success.      So my ears and jaw still hurt a bit and my ears are popping a lot.   Is something worse going on? The doctors dont seem that helpful      Advice is appreciated

At first they said it was Bipolar, but in June of last year the diagnosis was changed to Borderline Personality Disorder with Major depressive disorder.  I've been hospitalized 2 times.  First was in November of 2007 right after thanksgiving.  The second time was Oktober 2008.  My friends abbandoned me, my 15 year old cat died and I ran out of money.  I've been spending money, and now have 2 kittens and 1 dog, but still I feel empty inside.  My psychiatrist has ordered a 4 month supply of Cymbolta which he wants me to try.  It won't be here for 3 weeks.  I've tried prozac, paxel, depacote, lithem, lamictal, and trazodone to no relief.  What can I do to stop feeling so empty whilst waiting for this new meds?

20090219203418AAi8Yz0	Health;Diet & Fitness	I really need help losing weight!?	I have a lot of problems losing weight. I have Hypothyroidism, Insulin resistance (metabolic syndrome), PCOS, low metabolism, and low energy. I gain weight real easy and I can't lose it. The only way I have lost so far is by cutting my intake way way down. I was on the Isagenix 9 day cleanse. You are drinking the cleanse for four days (shakes for five), so all you do is drink the cleanse and eat veggies for four days and I lost weight that way, but I simply cannot continue to do that. I tried to stick to the 30 day Isagenix but I got bored and it doesn't really taste good. Plus, it is quite expensive. I have been exercising lately (an hour walk everyday). I just can't lose weight. I don't know what to do. Every time I try to lose weight and I fail it makes it so much harder to try again.       Please don't tell me to exercise and eat right, because like I said I have tried that. Please no stupid answers. I am serious and I need help.      Thank You.

20090219203855AAIyufz	Health;Dental	Is there any parent out there who can share there experience of a child with an abscessed tooth?	My 2 yr old son fell and chipped his front teeth about 6 months ago.  After a recent check up with his dentist, we were told it was abscessed, and needed to be removed right away.   I was devastated, and went to another doctor for a second opinion.  This doctor said there is a chance that it could be treated with antibiotics, and prescribed him some and said to come back in 2 weeks.  From everything I have read online, antibiotics are not an effective way, and usually the tooth must come out.  I just can't stand the thought of him having no tooth for 5+ years.  Anyone have any light to shed?

20090219204850AA7JmTe	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Other - Diseases	What are the chances my doctor will refill my Alprazolam (Xanax)?	Six weeks ago I went to the doctor for a really bad anxiety attack and he gave me 60 Xanax, 1mg. The bottle says no refills but he scheduled me to see him 6 weeks later. That time is almost up and  I'm still having anxiety attacks when I don't take them. A month from now things in my life will be different and I just need enough to get me through this stressful month.What are the chances he will refill it when I go to see him? What can I say that will ensure he will refill it? I realize Xanax is addictive and they don't like to prescribe it more than necessary. I only take one maybe 3-4 times a week and this is enough to help me.
