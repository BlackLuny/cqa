NfwJPdLjaa	This happened to me twice so I had to make a new account.<br>  1.) Check your password.<br>  Is the caps on? Did you misspell it?<br>  <br>  2.) Get a new password.<br>  Something you CAN remember(: Like your pet's name. Something<br>  your sure no one else has. Cause if someone has the same password as you then don't be surprised if you can't get in.<br>  <br>  3.) Someone probably hacked you.<br>  If you go somewhere public like a library and you go on myspace or something and you click remember me someone can get your email and password.<br>  Mostly likely they won't get out. They will change your password or email to tease you. Happened to me 2 times.<br>  <br>  5.) Be careful(:<br>  <br>  Good Luck<br>  xx

Read it and find out why.<br>  It is usually due to a problem with the mail service of the recipient, no longer a client, currently over limit, or that mail service is experiencing problems or doing maintenance. Check with the person to make sure the address is correct and active. Try again at a later time.

e63450517215908d3a9a820dd7193140aa	That is a Yahoo safety measure. If you write a long mail for example and something goes wrong causing a crash, you can go to the drafts folder and you'll find what you have written so far. When you send the mail, the draft should normally be deleted. If you want to save a draft to use it repeatedly, all you have to do is push the shift key when you send your mail. If you send your mail without pushing the shift key and the draft did not get deleted, you should go to this online help form and describe your problem:<br>  <a href="http://help.yahoo.com/fast/help/us/mail/cgi_ymail">http://help.yahoo.com/fast/help/us/mail/...</a> <br>  You could also send a mail to e-mail support: <br>  mail@cc.yahoo-inc.com<br>  or <br>  mail-classic-errors@cc.yahoo-inc.com<br>  or call Yahoo! Customer Service: 1-408-349-1572|`|44vgFcKcaa	Draft is the box you use to keep a letter you have written but do not want to send yet. Can be very handy and time saving. Once you compose the message you want, click on the button above that says 'Send to draft." If you are in the process of writting a message and something goes wrong, it will not be kept automatically. You loss it unless you save it. Hope this helped

It's been this way since 2005. So, glitches/problems were likely and using the service is a risk for users. It's had slow periods for a long time now for many users. In October 2007, the Yahoo! 360 team announced that they would no longer fix 360-related bugs, as they prepared to transition the service to a universal profile system. So, when a service is not properly monitored, more issues happen. Basically, everyone is complaining. It has little to do with your system unless your computer hasn't been properly maintained overall and you've consistently had problems with other sites, which doesn't seem to be the case for you.<br>  <br>  The Yahoo! Profile started as of October 16, 2008, but the 360 transition to that platform has not been completed. If you setup your profile at <a href="http://profiles.yahoo.com">http://profiles.yahoo.com</a> now, you can transfer some information from your 360 "Profile Information" and "Lists" modules so far. You can also invite 360 friends to connect there.

The 360 team blog is also accessible via the "Yahoo! 360 News" link in the upper right corner of your 360 space. You can post complaints on their blog, but don't expect a personal response.<br>  <br>  <br>  OTHER RESOURCES:<br>  - See <a href="http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-4D4zxsg6fLRvC60pERfR7.8c?p=858">http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-4D4zxsg6f...</a> for more information on 360 glitches.<br>  - See the links in these blog entries for more details on Yahoo's overall direction and UPS: <a href="http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-4D4zxsg6fLRvC60pERfR7.8c?p=1414">http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-4D4zxsg6f...</a> , <a href="http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-4D4zxsg6fLRvC60pERfR7.8c?p=1168">http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-4D4zxsg6f...</a> , and <a href="http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-4D4zxsg6fLRvC60pERfR7.8c?p=1236">http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-4D4zxsg6f...</a> .<br>  <br>  You can create a new Yahoo account and set up the 360 page for it, but you may incur the same problems again.

You can delete your answer by clicking the delete button in the small print to delete it. In order to comment you have to go to a resolved question. Then find the comment button. Click that.

You can check by clicking on their avatar. To make a avatar you go to your profile and click on "Edit My Info". Then scroll down until you see the options for the avatars.

The best thing for you to do is wait for his probation officer to get in contact or if u really need to know now, phone up your local citizens advice or contact a solicitor for advice.<br>  <br>  For me prison was hard the first 6 weeks ago, it all depends what the inmate is like. If he is looking for trouble then he will get it, if he keeps his head down speaks when he spoken to with a kind mature and respectable manner he should be fine. I guess he just got to wait til he settles in. The first 6 weeks are hard, if you go to see him then try not to smolder him or cry infront of him. Don't talk about negative issues be positive keep him strong for some inmates it can be horrible. I wish you all the best.

15017428de404442efe6fff34a4dd6edaa	There are websites like Snopes and Chain-mail anonymous that can verify such claims. But it's simple to just assume they are fake and delete them at once!|`|AA10985791	I don't know babs, but I'm blaming the fact I'm still single on the fact i never did forward that email that told me I'd have 7 years bad luck in love.....damn, haha|`|Ltx89w04aa	They don't know - someone just put that in the e-mail to make it sound impressive.<br>  <br>  Chain e-mails, except for the joke ones, are generally pretty stupid.  Lines like "if you don't forward this, you don't support our troops" or "forward to 500 of your friends and your wish will come true" is all a load of poo.  And then you've got the missing kids, people dying of cancer, etc.<br>  <br>  Most of these e-mails are flat out lies.  The easiest way to figure out if an e-mail forward is real or not is snopes.com - they research e-mails and determine whether they are hoaxes or not.<br>  <br>  Believe me, my life would be much simpler if more people used that site - I get soooooo annoyed when people forward me what I know are outright lies, and they forward the e-mail to about 50 people, so those people then get all worked up over nothing and forward it to more people...you get the point, the lie spreads and hundreds, if not thousands of people, get duped.<br>  <br>  When our parents told us not to believe everything we see, they meant it.  Chain e-mails are included in that - just because you get an e-mail saying a serial killer is roaming your neighbor and will kill you if you have red panties, it doesn't necessarily follow that it's true.|`|44vgFcKcaa	As it is much too easy to edit and change the E-mail content, I assume it is not true. But, then again, I also think of the chain letters as spam. I ask all my contacts not to send and or/forward them. If I do get them, they are deleted.

F0h2iFWsaa	Level 3 starts at 1,000 points - you have 433.<br>  <br>  All levels can pick a best answer to questions they ask and can vote for best answer on others' undecided questions.  Once you hit level 2 & get the ability to 'rate', the only difference in the levels is the daily limits on questions, answers, comments, votes, etc.<br>  <br>  Levels 2 and up can 'rate' the answers of other Y!A users.  Rating = giving Thumbs Up & Down to express your opinion of other peoples' answers. No points are involved (unless a best answer has TUs, then they get 1 point for each TU up to 50) in rating, and thumbs do not determine the Best Answer selection.<br>  <br>  Hints: <br>  <br>  answer your limit of questions each day (2 points each)<br>  get an answer selected as best answer (10 points each)<br>  pick a best answer for your question (3 points)<br>  vote your limit of unresolved questions each day (1 point each)<br>  you also get a point a day for signing in<br>  <br>  each question costs 5 points, so ask sparingly<br>  <br>  :o)<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/info/scoring_system">http://answers.yahoo.com/info/scoring_sy...</a>|`|suPD7c3gaa	You need 1000 points to get to Level 3.

cWmx0J4jaa	like this one, people are simply drawn to it!|`|fr180hSmaa	There are a few factors.<br>  1. Interestingness: if a question is "boring" people tend to not answer it some times. Or if the question does not relate to people.<br>  2. Category: Category matters if you ask a question in polls and surveys and it sucks you will still get a minimum of like 5 answers because that is a category with tons of people on it.<br>  3. Time: logically there are not going to be many people on at 3 in the morning even with time zones. Also more people are on in the evenings and weekends.|`|QxtdyNvgaa	because the answer appeals to certain yahoo answerers and the yahoo answerers are intrested with the question or know the answer to the question.<br>  <br>  <br>  for example............................ i am intrested with this question so i answered it and i will click the box-(found it intresting)<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  hope it helps!|`|04gAmuPuaa	Because more people know the answer to one certain type of question, than to another.

This is because there is to many people asking questions on this fantastic website that all questions dont appear on the front page but they do on another page. Most likely they go for the questions on the front. Another reason is that sometimes people wish to answer questions in a certain criteria and therefor they pass your question. Also if the persons question is fairly easy, alot of people will pick that one.|`|xDom6mr3aa	people are lazy and only like questions which require an answer of less than 20 words! \o/<br>  <br>  or talking about sex of course!|`|2mGE9mgNaa	Some are a lot more interesting.

e85803bf0a191397e1f247ae39618449aa	It has been reported that AT&T Quickfire has been pulled off the shelves, sales have been halted, due to what AT&T is calling "quality issues". However it is still available online and the blogosphere is ablaze with rumors and puns.

1thzSbS8aa	"Some" of the questions are perfectly normal? :D<br>  <br>  It's just possible that "some" of your questions violated the guidelines. <br>  <br>  If you received a violation notice, or notice that you're down 10 points, it means someone reported your question. If you did not receive a violation notice, the questions was deleted because it expired with no answers. If there are no answers, the question cannot be resolved, so it is not kept.|`|SOxdyWQOaa	yahoo will delete violation questions like chatting sadly some questions that are fine are being delete because people are reporting them for fun|`|suPD7c3gaa	What you call "normal" could still be a violation.  What were the questions, or even one, that was deleted... exact wording?  Someone here could tell you what the violation was.  It's more likely that you were reported, than any other reason.|`|GKmSyF7qaa	Sometimes they get automatically deleted if nobody answers them fast enough.|`|ZLt8TwOiaa	yahoo deletes those that violate terms of service
suPD7c3gaa	Because that's just not the case.  Yahoo! Answers does review all reported questions and answers that are appealed.  And many appeals are won.  So many people haven't read the Community Guidelines that they are often sure that their question or answer wasn't a violation... when oftentimes it is, so they wouldn't win an appeal. Remember, a question or answer doesn't have to contain profanity, be rude or offensive, contain anything inappropriate sexually explicit or be a controversial topic to be a violation. There are MANY other possible violations.  The most common is probably chat, followed closely by rant, soliciting, and Not a question or an answer... to name just a few.|`|zDQIPFH2aa	If you got a violation e-mail, post it and users can help you understand the problem.  Your "...I added details to adreess some of them..." may have been over the line and reported as chat.  You are not suppose to respond to answers until you resolve the question except just to clarify the question, not correspond with answerers.|`|ZLt8TwOiaa	I have to agree with your question . I once gave someone a website for information and I only gave it one, it was for weight loss and my question was deleted. I appealed and never heard anything at all from yahoo and I was not soliciting

Animal cruelty is taken very seriously these days.|`|jcX7g2Mcaa	call the police. right now its the only thing you can do. it is unlikely that your neighbor hurts people too. in which case you should talk to him, but it probably wont do any good. the best thing is to call the police.<br>  hope things work out!

gGZz2EGyaa	I would have to say that in total about 2 -3 hours a day.  I tend to come on here for a while, then pop off and do something else then pop back on again later in the day.  It does become a little addictive as you say to yourself you will only pop on here for 30 minutes and then spend the odd hour or two. I might answer about 20 questions in a day, might be more if I am a roll.<br>  I would not say I was smart, but as it is a complement I will accept it, the best offer I had today, thank you.

kJTzXWoPaa	This is an easy fix, don't worry. Place your pointer at the very edge of your page, right where the blue line starts. See how it turns into a double-arrow?<br>  <br>  That icon means you can "size" the page now. Just click and hold the clicker down until you get that arrow, still holding the click, move towards the outer edge of the page. See the page widening? Once it reaches it's widest point, release and you have your "Y" back, okay?<br>  <br>  Okay!

You can delete your answer by clicking the delete button in the small print to delete it. In order to comment you have to go to a resolved question. Then find the comment button. Click that. Type in your comment. Then click submit. There aren't any rewards when you become a top contributor or go to the highest level which is 7. You can send a user a message if the person allows it. You can check by clicking on their avatar. To make a avatar you go to your profile and click on "Edit My Info". Then scroll down until you see the options for the avatars. Click on "Edit My Avatar" or something like that in the blue print. Then a page should come up. Then you make the avatar.

CS4MVhsfaa	Hi, Sallylucy!<br>  <br>  Yahoo! Briefcase is a place you can store your computer files without using your own storage space.<br>  <br>  You may never have used it or even knew you had it in which case it's probably empty.<br>  <br>  But you should check and download any files in it as Yahoo! will soon be terminating this feature/service.<br>  <br>  Here's a link that should take you through the procedure.

If someone continously violates the Yahoo Terms of Serivce he might very well lose his complete Yahoo ID.|`|C8DOT8Y7aa	UPDATE: The best thing to do is to have an account used exclusively for Y/A and no other Yahoo service. Use a separate account for the other Yahoo services. If the Y/A one gets deleted, less sadness is involved. <br>  <br>  It can only take one, depending on the severity of the offense. However, that's not usually the case.<br>  <br>  "In a large majority of the cases people who are being suspended or loosing their accounts are warned with an email way in advance. In suspension cases we offer numerous warnings to people to let them know that their posts are not acceptable to us and they need to cease. However, there are some people who chose to ignore the warning and continue posting abusive posts. After a certain point, depending on the amount and the magnitude of the abuse, the person looses access to their Yahoo! Answers account. These people are suspended from Yahoo! Answers, the people who have lost their entire accounts have violatated the overall Yahoo! Terms of Service that they read and agreed to upon signing up for the account. These violations can happen on other Yahoo! properties outside of Yahoo! Answers, but if a person has broken these they are given warnings before the loss of account. It is because people do not read these emails, ignore them, or understand and chose to continue on anyway they lose their accounts. We cannot let people who have broken the Terms of Service multiple times, across Yahoo!, continue to do so." - answer posted by a Y/A staff member at<a href="http://suggestions.yahoo.com/detail/?prop=answers&fid=8539">http://suggestions.yahoo.com/detail/?pro...</a>

The troll attempts to pass as a legitimate participant, sharing the group's common interests and concerns; the newsgroups members, if they are cognizant of trolls and other identity deceptions, attempt to both distinguish real from trolling postings, and upon judging a poster a troll, make the offending poster leave the group. Their success at the former depends on how well they — and the troll — understand identity cues; their success at the latter depends on whether the troll's enjoyment is sufficiently diminished or outweighed by the costs imposed by the group|`|2Hl4AAP7aa	a troll is basically only here to cause trouble by posting questions hoping to provoke ,posting stupid and silly questions, reporting anyone they disagree with, stalking other users and reporting all their answers, playing avatar games,leaving nasty answers to questions or idk as an answer. they are the curse of yahoo answers and are silly stupid creatures.

Click "Get Started" button on the far right section of that page. After going through the activation process, you can click on the teeny tiny "Yahoo 360 Home" link on the upper right of that page (or the 360 main page) to get into the 360 space.<br>  <br>  Make sure a JPEG formatted photo (with .jpg, .jpeg, .jpe extension) under 5MB is saved to your hard drive.<br>  <br>   Click your "My Page" link at the top<br>  - Click "Edit Profile/Personal Photos" over the empty picture frame<br>  - Click "Browse" and upload photo into an empty field. Then click one "use as primary" radio button on the right before saving (if you've uploaded more than one image).<br>  <br>  You can't upload more than 4 profile pictures (this includes an avatar). Make sure that you are following the 360 Personal Photo guidelines here: <a href="http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/360/gui...">http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/360/gui...</a> .<br>  <br>  Then, come back to Yahoo! Answers.<br>  - Make sure that it is the same Yahoo ID that you used for 360.<br>  - Click the "My Profile" link to the upper right of this Yahoo! Answers page, then click "Edit My Info" in the top left box on the Answers profile page.<br>  - Scroll down to the image section and check the option of showing the 360 picture. Click Preview and then the OK button. Then, WAIT.<br>  <br>  NOTE: The image may not show up right away in Y/A, as it sometimes takes minutes, hours, days, or weeks for the system to catch up. So, in the meantime, you will be without any picture on Y/A (a gray unisex icon) or an old 360 image. Just go through the above process and let your picture stay that way until the system makes your 360 image appear. If you don't want to wait, then just use a Yahoo! Avatar (<a href="http://avatars.yahoo.com">http://avatars.yahoo.com</a> ) and forget about using the 360 image.<br>  <br>  OTHER TIPS: <br>  *** If the 360 space is recently activated, you may want to wait a few days before changing settings, as Y/A may not recognize that you have a 360 space right away.<br>  *** You may want to enable all the communication options on your Y/A profile and/or enable the Simple URL option in your Yahoo! 360 "Basic Info" and "Blog" settings pages. Sometimes that helps make the Y!360 image appear in your Y/A profile for an unknown reason. You still may have to wait for anything to happen though. <br>  *** Although, some people have found limited success in continually trying to re-select the 360 image option in their Y/A profile. I recommend waiting though, as to not inadvertently cause further delay.<br>  *** Some people never see an image show up. You can always post a bug report (or piggyback on other's bug reports) on the issue at the Y/A forum: <a href="http://suggestions.yahoo.com/?prop=answe...">http://suggestions.yahoo.com/?prop=answe...</a> . This link between Y/A and Y!360 has been buggy for years.

If you click on the pencil, three or four tabs (depending on whether you extended the expiration date or not) will pop down, and one of them will read "PUT THIS QUESTION TO VOTE." Then the question will be put to vote, and you and the Yahoo! Answers community will vote for the best answer. You will still receive three points when the question is resolved.|`|suPD7c3gaa	You've asked 2 different questions.  It's NOT advisable to send your question to voting. Once you do that, you have no control over which answer is gets the votes for Best Answer. People tend to get upset about that.  So do your best to choose a Best Answer.  You really don't HAVE to choose after receiving one answer, unless you are sure that answer really is what answers your question or solves your problem.  Your question would go to voting for the community to choose the Best Answer once time expires and you can no longer choose.  So don't let the time expire.  <br>  <br>  Once your question has been posted for at least 4 hours, you will see the blue "Choose as Best Answer" button by each answer. After 4 hours have elapsed, just go to your question, then to the answer you want to choose, and click on that button, and follow the steps. If you haven't gotten the answer you need, you can give it a few more days just in case you get more answers, and one that might be better.|`|2Hl4AAP7aa	after your question has been posted for 4 hours a blue bar is under each answer saying choose as best answer just click it. for voting after 4-5 days and no best answer is chosen by the poster it goes to voting. you can choose to send a question to voting early. you can vote your own answer as best in voting. you get 1 point for every vote you give in voting, 1 vote per question.|`|a59579ec8aee8902f555d4fccd5299e6aa	You have to wait for 4 hours to pick an answer, then the choice will show up automatically.|`|JsrpYFfIaa	it's keeps like that for ...3 days i think..after that when you check your question, you'll see a notification (in orange) says that you have to choose a best answer (or let it for voters)|`|gRkpFHNzaa	wait a minimum of 4 hours. go to question you posted and you will see the blue tags next to each ones name . click on which ever one you want to give best answer to.|`|ZDjmDuuyaa	You won't be able to chose best answer until your question has been in at least one day then a box will appear to chose best answer couldn't be easier. good luck :)|`|SOxdyWQOaa	wait 4 to 5 hours then you can vote

7u77AiBjaa	You are using a Yahoo account to access services like Yahoo! 360 and Yahoo Answers.<br>  <br>  Closing your entire Yahoo account gives you the best chance to completely remove your 360 space from the web. Closing a Yahoo account does cancel access (and for some removes associated content) to Yahoo services under that account. Otherwise, if you do not want to lose your Yahoo ID, your second-best option is content removal and permissions adjustment.<br>  <br>  So, here are your two choices:<br>  <br>  1) Go to <a href="http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/edit/changing_users/edit-23.html">http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/edit/ch...</a> and click the Account Deletion link. If you read through the text, you will find this will also delete all associated services for that account like Yahoo! Mail. I still recommend removing any content that you've added to your 360 before deleting your entire account.<br>  <br>  NOTE: If a COMPLETELY deleted account doesn't result in a deleted 360 space, you can contact Yahoo Customer Care through this Account Deletion Help Form at <a href="http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/edit/registration/deletion.html">http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/edit/re...</a> and/or use the 360 ABUSE FORM at <a href="http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/360/abuse.html">http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/360/abu...</a> . You can also call 1-866-562-7219, 1-408-349-1572, 1-408-349-3300 Hours: 8a-5p M-F (Pacific).It's possible that you won't be deleted COMPLETELY from the user registration database until after 90 days.<br>  <br>  2) If you don't want to completely lose your Yahoo ID, then I suggest removing all content and information that you added to Yahoo! 360. Make all your settings (basic info, blog, communication, and every module on your "My Page") set to "Friends" or "Just Me (Private)". The "Just Me (Private)" setting is preferred, but if you don't have that option choose "Friends." Delete all your friends (see <a href="http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/360/friends/friends-05.html">http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/360/fri...</a> ). Remove content from automatically public areas like the Personal Profile Picture module and Top Page comments. Change the background back to the default version - either called the "custom" or "classic" theme. Then, that's it.|`|Ai8NrXB8aa	I don't think so, sorry.

And put your photo in the middle , the picture size behing atleast a quarter size smaller than the canvas itself (the canvas is supposed to be bigger) then save it and upload your display picture and you will see that the unnessecary canvas parts are cutt off , but your picture is visible as it was not part of the cut off part. It is natural for it to be cut out - hence thats why the canvas.<br>  <br>  If you do not have Photoshop, open a blank sheet like normal, make it bigger than your picture then put your picture in the middle and so on.<br>  <br>  If it doesn't work the first time, keep on fiddling and moving the picture around, making the picture even smaller, or the canvas even bigger, until it works :).|`|645f18865ac05bd21df6fca545da961daa	you mention the top top being cropped off, not clear where profile is or for, if image is taller than wide, you could add blank space to sides to make square, but image would appear smaller, <br>  if image is for here, you can edit in paint by selecting size, and copy, then paste as new paint, or use other editor crop/ cut tools,<br>  <br>  for avatar here you use 360 profile icon, select "my page" then edit profile photo<br>  <a href="http://360.yahoo.com/">http://360.yahoo.com/</a><br>  <br>  for yahoo profile you can use same icon or add new, the avatar pop-up does cut image into square shape so this is where you would have to resize borders to fit width, default for 360 link here if you don't have 360 blog, <br>  <a href="http://profiles.yahoo.com/">http://profiles.yahoo.com/</a><br>  <br>  Pixenate - Online Photo Editor<br>  <a href="http://pixenate.com/" rel="nofollow">http://pixenate.com/</a><br>  Pixer.us  online <br>  <a href="http://pixer.us/" rel="nofollow">http://pixer.us/</a><br>  Dr.Picture Editor online<br>  <a href="http://gui.picresize.com/picresize2/" rel="nofollow">http://gui.picresize.com/picresize2/</a><br>  _________<br>  <br>  Photofiltre<br>  <a href="http://photofiltre.free.fr/frames_en.htm" rel="nofollow">http://photofiltre.free.fr/frames_en.htm</a><br>  Artweaver<br>   <a href="http://www.artweaver.de/index.php?en_version" rel="nofollow">http://www.artweaver.de/index.php?en_ver...</a><br>  Pixia<br>  <a href="http://www.ne.jp/asahi/mighty/knight/" rel="nofollow">http://www.ne.jp/asahi/mighty/knight/</a><br>  ..|`|chHPoiThaa	If you are using Windows XP, the easiest way is to install a Microsoft Powertoy called "Image Resizer" to resize pictures (including JPEG) straight from Windows Explorer.<br>  Download it here:<br>  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/w..." rel="nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/w...</a><br>  After installation, just right-click on the image in Windows Explorer then select "Resize Pictures".

(IMPORTANT!  DO NOT us an image that's tiny/avatar sized to start with.  You must use 'normal' size image files.)  Then you need to put the image you'd like to use as your avatar on your 360 page. You may already have one. If you do, you would be able to access it from your profile. Just click on your avatar (or "My Profile" on the upper right). The 360 option will be on the upper right. If not, you'd need to create one.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://360.yahoo.com/">http://360.yahoo.com/</a><br>  <br>  To be sure your image meets proper specifications:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/360/guidelines/guidelines-06.html">http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/360/gui...</a><br>  <br>  To add a photo to 360: Go to your 360 page. Click on "My Page" that's near the top. You'll see your photos (or where they would be if you don't already have photos there) and the option to "Edit Personal Photos". Click on that, then you will see where you can add photos. Click on "Choose File" to find the image on your computer. Once you add the image, click on "Save". That'll bring you back to the group of images. If you want to set the new image as primary to use here, click on "Edit Personal Photos" again. Click where it says "Set as Primary", then click "Save.<br>  <br>  Then to use your 360 image here for your avatar, go to your profile (Click on your avatar or click "My Profile" on the upper right of the page), the click on "Edit my info".

Therefore, you need to check out your questions every once in a while to see if there are new comments on one or more of them.|`|suPD7c3gaa	If you set your profile to be notified if you get answers to a question, you will get an email.  If you didn't, then go to your profile, click on the "My Questions" tab, and find the question to see if you've received answers.

It may take a few days for the bank to process, but once it is done, you should be able to sign on, then do all of your banking on line that you wish to do. <br>  You can call your bank to get the wed addresses you need, if you can not find them yourself, plus any other information I have not covered, and answer questions you may have.<br>  Hope this helped.

9BL6LFJ9aa	Yahoo is still having some problems at the moment. Suggested cures range from Update Adobe Flash Player and Java script to clear IE7 cache, cookies, and browsing history. Different things seem to work for different people. It's causing attachments to not show, 999 errors where it won't let you do a particular action and some people cannot send receive delete or move mail. It's not just Vista either it's happening to some of us on XP. If all else fails go back to classic mail  Hope this helps.
