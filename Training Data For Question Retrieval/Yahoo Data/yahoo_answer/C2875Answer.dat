Su fama se remonta a la Feria Internacional de Panam del a?o 1915, cuando el Maotai consigui un premio de oro. Desde aquel entonces se reconoce como una de las tres bebidas alcohlicas destiladas ms sobresalientes del mundo, junto con el gisqui escocs y el co?ac francs. Por otra parte y por esta causa, se convirti en el licor nacional de China.     Este licor legendario se produce en el pueblo de Maotai, de la ciudad de Zunyi. En l, la presencia del alcohol se extiende por todas partes debido a la existencia de ms de 500 destileras dedicadas a esta produccin. Para conocer de cerca este pueblo, les recomendamos vivamente visitar dos lugares, la destilera del licor Maotai y el Museo de la Cultura Alcohlica de China.

kedcv0glaa	They are excellent and very meaty. And they pre-crack the crab legs so all you have to do is pull apart the shells and the meat falls right out. They make their own crab butter and it is delicious as well. Their special there is really awesome. It's $19.99 for a 9 oz sirloin, half pound of crab legs and a baked potato. But you can also do the same special with a 6 oz sirloin for $15.99 (that's what the prices are in KY were I worked). Just because it's a lot of food, I could never finish it. Happy eating :)|`|FcuGQofUaa	their really good i really like it|`|JnLoHaoAaa	I've had them and they are delicious! A bonus is they slice the shell down the middle making it very easy to just open up and dig in so you don't have to mess with crackers and picks    EDIT: Well we always buy the blooming onion, so between that, the complimentary bread, and the crab legs I fill up :)|`|PxJXJKCpaa	King crab rocks.  I can't guarantee you that they will be great, tho.  Bring a pair of scissors just in case their not cut.    Sounds good.  I've got one by me and I haven't seen that ad yet.
rmhfMtQjaa	$100+.  No less.|`|ggSWODTRaa	the amount of money is up to you.. you should take her to one of the place that you like so you can see what you both may have incommoded and to break in ice of conversation you can help her chose a dish that you know it is already good... good luck and have fun|`|t5xnbgKkaa	You can get a good meal for 25 per person, just check with your local restaurants,and remember that wine and other drinks will cost extra. But you can also take a loot at one of the many restaurant guides for the u.k., such as Top table, and check out special offers in your area..or simply call and ask about special offers. Premier Inns, for instance, are doing dinner for two for 10 ..this may be only two courses and it will not include drinks, but it is certainly a very good value beginning to the meal and in quiet surroundings. Hotels, middle of the range hotels, often do have good meal offers even for people who are simply dining there rather than staying, and a lot of good pubs have excellent menus as well.  As this is a first date you should not spend too much, it looks as if you are trying to impress or expecting something in return..when what you should be aiming at is a couple of quiet hours when you can talk and eat and get to know each other. Never take a  first date to a place with foreign cuisine unless you happen to know for a fact that she ..or he..is definitely into that particular cuisine.If you have a shortage of good English restaurants in your area then Greek is probably the safest alternative unless you know your dates preferences already.  Work out what you think it will cost and make sure that you have at least 20 per cent more than that on hand just in case; do not take her to a place where they serve lobster..why take the risk of being stiffed with a huge bill?..and unless you are very knowledgeable about wine and the wine list is very reasonably priced, stick to a glasses or a carafe of the house wine. Enjoy yourselves and if it turns out that you've accidentally chosen a really horrible restaurant, get out after the first course and go get a MacDonald's or a pizza after all..you will have something to talk about and laugh at .which is a lot more important than anything else.|`|kedcv0glaa	Just go some place that you both will enjoy. Order whatever you want but don't try to go all out or she will notice you are trying to hard to impress her.|`|agodSvgraa	i think around 50-70 depending on if there will be drinking.  I think for a first date i would suggest a small quaint restaurant that you know is good, instead of taking your date to a chain restaurant where it is really loud and the food is not that good.  If the date is going well, get dessert at a cafe.  there's nothing better than dessert, coffee, and good conversation.  Honestly just spend what you feel comfortable spending, don't feel like you have to spend so much, it is just the first date.|`|SNkDwJvEaa	I honestly don't no.

NJgysWKMaa	Oh you are just fine.  It's not like you are getting fries and burgers.  Keep dancing darling!|`|soncFl6Daa	ok, it obviously is not the best thing you could be having but the thing is is that you have one a week with no meat in it.  the meat is the worst part of those sandwiches.  i think it is not a big deal for you to eat that once a week but if you want to make it better i would jsut decrease the portion size because a foot long is a bit much.  the rest is not bad i would just enjoy it once a week. plus the veggies have major health benefits|`|Lj0xwPmraa	I think the veggie sandwich would be ok. I'm a little concerned about the quality of their meats though.|`|ZoaggZ76aa	yeah everyone makes a good point about the meat comments, that's why I like to take my deli meat with me when I go to subway.  Keep up the whole wheat bread and the veggies and you'll be fine.  For me Subway is Carpe diem.  Relax and enjoy the foot long.|`|GCzQQqHraa	Almost anything can be made healthy the same with being unhealthy but what your eating is better than 90% of the stuff that most people eat. Whole weat is a complex carb so good choice, the veggie delite is also a good choice. It mainly depends on the sauce your describing as sub sauce. However, more than likely even if your using mayo it would not likely exceed t-3 tablespoon which add about 150 calories and more than it's fair share of fat so I would just be mindfull of the type of sauce your using. Some better choices are oil and vinegar, mustards, or their sweet onion sauce but if your only doing it once a week it's no big deal. Check out fitday.com for some helpfull information on nutrtion and use their links. Keep in mind you don't have much protein on the sandwich and given your age you may want to consider some more (turkey, chicken).|`|Tf19RETiaa	it depends on what you get from there, instead of diet coke, get water because the sugar substitute in diet drinks aren't good for you. but the sandwich sounds very healthy!|`|qxteTM9Kaa	Sure,it's healthy enough.|`|CoBFyszeaa	NOOOOOOOOO    VERRYYYYY UN HEALTHYYYYYYY  1NCE EVRY 2 WEEKS IS OKAY 4 UUR AGEEE.....

hNa5oHxQaa	No  I prefer NY style pizza|`|AA10412922	I don't think it would be any good,just a half baked mess|`|uDVpjFbiaa	Nah wouldnt make a difference really :/ lol|`|VXcp8hvHaa	sure, why not?|`|J48VE1Q5aa	never thought about that.... but why not?  they seem to add all sorts of strange things to their menus, why not try a delicious chicago style pizza?  of course it would never beat the real thing... would not come close to giordano's, or gino's east... but for you poor folks in texas, YES, they should make that accomadation!     hey, do you texans have UNO down there?  they are a franchise and have good chicago style pizza.  and you are always welcome to send some spicy texas chili or great mexican my way!!|`|m936qdlDaa	no|`|FrSDLRfyaa	go to chicago|`|VyEtrqtYaa	No.    They have already positioned themselves as a New York style pizza chain, even going as far as to have a pizza called Brooklyn Style.  A company should never lose its focus and they should keep doing what made them famous.      With that said, I see Domino's pushing their new subs trying to compete against Subway... Granted Domino's is a big enough company to take risks like that but a smaller company should keep its focus in mind.  Do what you do best.    As for wanting deep dish in Texas... Buy a cheap cast iron pan and read some recipes. It's easy, simple, and cheap.

AA10667849	the old clam house on bayshore is a good one    you might also considere the italian social club on russin    tommy toys is great but expensive|`|gjteVB2Daa	We always go back to the Franciscan on the wharf overlooking the Bay.  Great food not too pricey and fantastic appetizers, too. Love the fried squid.  We also like the Buena Vista for their good food and Irish Coffee.|`|f696776b941b55b420115b639c09c57aaa	Izzy's on Steiner at Lombard, good steaks, seafood and stiff drinks.  Tadich Grill 240 California an old boys kind of place that does great fish, steaks and chops.  No reservations but first come first served at the counter.  Clement Street Bar and Grill, Clement at 8th Avenue.  A great neighborhood place with something for every body on the menu. Incredible staff as well.|`|bTbYP3iyaa	red robin|`|28d6b247dbaac5aea6f4f1980e00962baa	We recently went to Lolo in the Mission for my mother-in-law's birthday dinner.  It was really really great.  We were a party of 5.  We ate our dishes tapas style (sharing everything).  Every dish was outstanding and they never rushed us (we took a long time to eat and visit and eat and visit).  I highly recommend this as a 'locals' go-to spot and I look forward to going back.      Another great restaurant that I enjoyed recently is Aziza.  It's in the Outer Richmond -- terrific food, excellent service!  Again, we ate tapas-style, sharing everything.  They have a full bar here and the decor is great.  Get a booth for a smaller party and feel cozy while you eat and visit.      Happy eating!  (I could come up with more suggestions for you, if you give me more info about what you like/dislike.  But, these two places are cool and 'local'-y.  I would say that Lolo was more whimsical than Aziza but the food at both places was stellar.)|`|DEev3JdHaa	crustaceans for the garlic crab.|`|8H8SRZ7Paa	I know there are only three of you, but if you don't finish your food, you can always take some home with you. There's Buca De Beppos in downtown of SF :)    Give yourself a treat and have some cheesecake at the Cheesecake Factory inside of Macy's by Union Square.|`|3Nl8g6Azaa	Villa Romano on Irving St., near Golden Gate Park.   They really do have the best meatballs in San Francisco, not too expensive and they have a small, homey feel to the restaurant. It's never been extremely busy when I've gone, but you might want to call ahead just in case.  It's Italian food, mainly pasta, but it's delicious.|`|hnqPQUmgaa	Momo's (www.sfmomos.com) or Acme Chophouse (/www.acmechophouse.com) by the ballpark are both excellent restaurants.  Momo's is classy and Acme is neither snobbish or pretentious.  I also love One Market (www.onemarket.com).  Good luck!  All the restaurants listed, with a few exceptions, are excellent.
VXcp8hvHaa	more expensive in france|`|7gap7tAxaa	probably more. all i know is that a cheeseburger in holland has more tax than the actual sandwich itself
86fc0a36ed445f3acb8c37c8c987f35baa	Try Mia Bella on Main right downtown, Michelangelo's in Montrose, or Crappito's on Mid Lane near the Galleria just inside the Loop.

Neither is Rainforest Cafe or any other Landry's restaurant. Try outside of downtown.|`|Seppx5Jwaa	Maybe you could cook a dinner and go to a bakery or ice cream restaurant to get a treat.|`|BSdvz7YGaa	ok, im a girl, i luv 2 dine at the cheese cake factory. idk if u have 1 where u live, or take her to a nice fancy place.  looking for something cheap? cook at home, and take her out for dessert!|`|nmRZqyeoaa	Timpano's is a really good place...  Feels upscale in decor, but jacket and tie are not required.  Additionally, it has it's own lounge/bar area with dancing and piano playing, so it's possible to have a decent meal and have some drinks after or dance.  Or if you want, there are plenty of places in the area around it to hang after.  Another plus is that there is a parking lot right across the street from it, so if you drive in to town you don't have to walk 5 blocks to get to the place.    http://www.timpanochophouse.net/|`|H59IEeD7aa	i know where u should u go.Go to Applebee 's or go to the Diner.If i were u i would go to Ruby Tuesday.
