20090222235224AAMTUv5	Sports;Tennis	Is this racket a fake one?	I went to this shop that had a Head Microgel Prestige Pro. It doesn't look fake at all and the weight and everything looks correct, (I searched in the internet and compared). It was head light like I read on the internet, it has the hydrosorb grip ( white colored with holes) and the grip still had the plastic on it. The paint as well was very nice, it even had a bar code on it with the antishock and warranty card attached to it.. I asked the vendor last time and he told me it was a real one and told me it was like 300$. Today I go to the same shop and another seller told me it was a 2nd grade racket, that it was reaaaaaaaaally close to the real thing, but it's not. I asked him if it was fake and he told me no, it's a 2nd grade racket. I'm like ok...... and proposed me 150$. I want to buy this racket to risk and see if It is playable or not, if I string it with expensive strings if it'll break or somthing, because I dont have 300$ and want to buy it from the other seller at 150$.   Do you think it's a fake one? I mean It looks real and maybe the second seller was wrong, and it turns out to be a real racket....

20090223005416AA7M2Q6	Sports;Baseball	Overrated vs. underrated?	overrated   ryan howard-plate discipline is horrible. adam dunn is just as good as him.   mark texeira-the yanks overpaid for this guy. consistent player who plays an easy defensive position. most of his power #s came from the hitter-friendly rangers park. other than defensive prowess, not much of an upgrade over jason giambi.   josh hamilton-32 homers is good but not great especially since he plays in a hitter's paradise. slugging percentage is not exactly superstar.   justin morneau-solid player, one year wonder who doesn't get on base as much as some of the premiere hitters. career high in homers (34), career batting average (.281) and career ops (.846) are very mediocre for a first baseman   a-rod: his overall stats don't stack up against pujols'   ichiro: used to be great. now, he's barely better than juan pierre and that's only because he plays gold glove outfield.   prince fielder: 1 year wonder. nuff said      underrated   manny ramirez-# speak for themselves. ridiculous that no team sign him yet. sure he might be a cancer, but baseball is not exactly a team sport.   adrian gonzalez: he's better than texerira given that he plays in a pitcher park.   albert pujols: the best hitter of the generation period. the only knock is that he plays an easy position (1st base), but he plays it well.   adam dunn: almost as good as howard yet couldn't get a decent contract

20090223012249AABPHJg	Sports;Football (American)	Should I Play Football Next Year?	Okay I'm a Freshman in high school right now and next year I'm gonna be a sophomore (obviously).  I go to a private school (Kamehameha) and I just got accepted this year so I couldn't really try out this past year since they had conditioning and stuff going on during the summer.       So here it is...I love football. Even though I've played baseball since I was 4, I love football.  I played football for 5 years and played running back in my first two season, in which I sucked and then played Left Guard my last three seasons.  Yeah I was small and was probably 20 pounds lighter than everyone else but that didn't stop me.  My last season, our team had good team chemistry and that sorta made me super good and I was drive blocking people and filling in as if I was the same size as the people I was going up against.  Maybe the only thing I couldn't do was trap block.  But I just loved the feeling of feeling that the guy in front me thinks that he's just gonna run me over but really, he's the one getting blown off the line.      I really don't wanna see my football career end because I just love the game too much.  Unfortunately, I'm not very fast, I have below average hands because I have short and fat fingers, i'm 120 pounds now and 5'5".  My real question though is, what position should I try out for?

Andy Roddick is skipping Dubai because of the treatment of Shahar Peer and rightly so.  Since this episode, we've heard lots about how politics and sports should not mix and how the UAE should be sanctioned, etc.  However, do you think the outcry would have been the same had the victim been Muslim?  Would Roddick skip a tournament in say, Israel or the United States if an Iranian or Pakistani player had been denied a visa?  Would there be a double standard or do you think the outrage would be the same?  In other words, is all this hoopla about how sports and politics should never mix just a load of hypocrisy?  Because something in my gut tells me he and other protesters wouldn't take the same stand for a Pakistani or Iranian player.  What do you think?
