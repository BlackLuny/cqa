20070609055359AAV2gfr	Entertainment & Music;Celebrities	Cupcakes, lets throw a party Paris Hilton style?	So what did you all think of the huge bash Paris Hilton's parents were throwing her when she was temporarily released from jail?      Truck loads of cupcakes and all sort of other goodies...      ...and she wonders why people were outraged by her early release. I mean what kind of punishment is house arrest when her parents are flaunting on TV a party?      One of the arguments for her early release was she was sick, yet she was more than willing to get down and party.      Bad move on her parents part, it hurt Paris's image and took  away what sympathy many may have had IMO.      I wonder if they'll donate those cupcakes to some charity now that she is back in jail...

20090128145530AABL6Fh	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	How unfair is this grade?	OK so I have a gay science teacher. I'm new to the school so I didn't know a lot of things that I should have done to make my grade better, and he didnt tell me, so how in the world was I supposed to know? We did this project for Biomes and we had to do a thing of notecards. Well I was absent the first two days he explained the project. Everyone was assigned a partner and they each did half the work, well I came back to school and there wasnt anyone else to partner up with so I had to do the whole thing by myself. Well I worked damn hard on the thing, I did much better then anyone else in my class who probably just slopped something together in the last minute. At first he gave me 100. Well the rest of the class got a 75 because their heading wasnt correct. This was a test grade by the way. Then this girl asked why I got the 100 and where my heading was. And nobody knew what the heck he meant by a heading! Then he grabbed my paper, crossed out the 100, and put a 50. The heading thing wasn't on the paper explaining the project, he said he told us to do it in class, the day I wasnt there of course. And he also changed the directions in the middle of the project. But what I don't undersatand is why everyone else got a 75 and I got a 50 when we all did the same thing wrong. I should have gotten more points because I worked alone. And then during the project I missed almost a week because I got the flu and he probably told us more things. I did it the project with the instructions he handed out and he told me to do. And who the heck takes off 25% for not having a heading? So my parents set up an appointment with him to straghten some things out. But don't you think that is so unfair?

Dans un AIRBUS A380, le commandant de bord dit à ses passagers :      - " Mesdames,  Messieurs, c'est votre commandant de bord qui vous parle.          Nous perdons de  l'altitude et nous n'avons pas assez de carburant pour atteindre notre  destination.         Donc, nous allons  larguer hors de l'avion tous les bagages".      Ceci fait l'avion regagne de l'altitude mais, une demi-heure plus tard,      en  reperd.   La voix du commandant se fait de nouveau entendre dans les hauts parleurs :              -" C'est votre commandant qui vous parle.         Nous perdons encore de  l'altitude et nous ne pourrons pas  atteindre         notre destination sans jeter quelques passagers hors de l'avion..

Nous sommes Black et donc des      gens de Couleur" .      Et le pére de répondre:       - " mon fils quand la situation le demande il faut savoir accepter ce que      nous  sommes .

In one store she sees a lovely dress at a reduced price. It fits her a treat so she buys it. She now needs new shoes to go with the dress so she trails around a few shoes shops until she finds a pair she likes and as luck would have it, they are on sale too, 25% off the marked price. She meets her best friend and they have a coffee together and decide to check out the new bargain store which has just opened. They load up with lots of new tops and skirts and sexy underwear. The woman receives a call on her mobile to tell her that her husband has been involved in a bad accisent and is in hospital. She is upset about this but is having such a good time she thinks another hour won't make much difference. She is having one of her best shopping days ever, bargain after bargain adds to her already full shopping bags until she can carry no more. After about four hours she thinks she really must go to the hospital to see her husband.   She arrives and is met by a female doctor. The doctor notices that the woman is fully laden with shopping and says, " I see you have been shopping. For the last five hours your husband has been in intensive care fighting for his life and you don't give a damn. All you think about is yourself, you ought to be ashamed."   The woman breaks down in tears and is clearly very upset. The doctor puts her arm around the woman's shouder and consoles her. "Don't worry dear. I was only joking. You husband died three hours ago. Now, show me what you bought!"

C'est ainsi que la race humaine est apparue.       Deux jours plus tard, la petite fille demande à son père la même question.    Le père répond: Il y a très longtemps existaient les singes.    Au fil des années ils se transformèrent pour devenir des hommes.  C'est ainsi qu'est apparue la race humaine.       Confuse, la petite fille retourne voir sa mère et lui demande:    -Maman comment se fait-il que tu m'aies dit que la race humaine a été créée par Dieu et que papa m'affirme qu'elle vient du singe?    -Chérie, répondit la maman, c'est que moi je t'ai parlé de l'origine de ma famille et ton père de la sienne!

20081110011842AAkb2jR	Entertainment & Music;Movies	Was Harry Shearers voice in the movie MacCarthur(1977)?	I heard a voice in the Movie Mac Macarthur(1977), on a television movie real.  It sounds just like good old, and UNMISTAKABLE, Harry Shearer.  He is old enough to have done the voice work.  It is really hard to find detailed credits for smaller parts in older movies. It doesn't surprise me that it isn't listed on his credits, as it was a voice work, before the voice work that is popular now day's i.e. Simpson's So this will have to be a" someone knows someone" answer.

20081113153551AAWyPn1	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	A couple visiting Jerusalem?	George went on a vacation to the Middle East with his wife. During their vacation in Jerusalem, his wife died. With the death certificate in his hand, George went to the American Consulate to make arrangements to send the body back to the USA for a proper burial. The Consul told George that to send the body back to the United States for burial is very, very expensive. It could cost him as much as $5,000.00. The Consul told him, in most cases the person responsible for the remains normally decides to bury the body here in Jerusalem. This would only cost him $150.00. George thinks for some time and answers, "I don't care how much it will cost to send the body back, that's what I want to do." The Consul says, "You must have loved your wife very much considering the difference in price". "No, it's not that," says George.    "You see, I know of a case ,many years ago of a man that was buried here in Jerusalem. On the third day he arose from the dead! I just cant take the risk!

My mother said 'Son you will grow up as a good man,   Make a family and have a nice little picket fence,   But don't get caged in cause the reality is,   Everyone dies, which means someone will die alone.'      I didn't understand what she meant but I knew this,   Love is a gift that only lasts one lifetime...So I'll take it as it comes.   I'll capture a spirit in a net that I made of Spider web,   I wanna see if it can break it....for fun i guess.      When my Mother died I knew what she meant,   She spoke in broken up sentences.   "Daniel my Son, how is you heart, does it hurt like mine does,   You see your father is gone, so you have to carry on"      I wished my mother a great rest as she stole her last breathe,   So I picked up a dove and sent her a letter,   "Mum, remember when you said I'll be a good man....   I'm sorry that your plans have now come undone!"

20090128150814AALJlh8	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	Do you think she will call back?	I was on a date with this chick and we started making out. Then I passed out and woke up in a ditch on the side of the road. It was dark out and my clothes were really bloody. I tried to hitch hike home but no one would stop for me. Eventually a cop car pulled over and two pigs came out of it. I yelled "I smell bacon!!!" at them and started running, but they tazered me and I fell over. They took me to some stupid hospital and the doctor said I had been stabbed several times in the chest. What a load of crap. I snuck out when the pigs weren't looking and drove an ambulance home.   Who could have done this? It was probably that stupid wife of mine.   Do you think the girl will call back?

20090128165853AAeuuFh	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	What do you think of my speech?	im supposed to write up an presentation on something that has to do with biology in the media and I wrote it on an pregnant man. (nobody else did theirs on reproduction, they did it on metabolism and cigarettes and cancer and such)      here's my presentation (imagine me saying it without laughing, straight faced) tell me what you think of it         A Pregnant Man      There once was a man named Tom   He was the male who became a mom.      In March 2008, a man called Thomas Beatie reported to the public that he was pregnant. He/she is a transgender. He/she had surgery to take away her boobs and changed her appearance into a man, by the means of growing a beard and lots of body/facial hair. He has even gotten male hairstyles. Almost twenty years ago, he had changed from Tracy as a woman to Tom as a man. Although he is legally a man, people still call him a woman because he had kept his uterus. It is unknown whether if he has a vagina only or a vagina and testicles at the same time. People call him a woman also because his voice still sounds female and that he is a woman just changed her physical appearance.      It does not really matter what the public says because Tom had legally stated that he/she is a man and that his wife, Nancy are legal married couples. Nancy had a disease called endometrioses 20 years ago and had to go thru a hysterectomy and is unable to carry a child. Tom believes that having a baby is not a male or female desire, but a human desire. He was made pregnant by a sperm donor.      The baby came out on July 3, 2008, it was a girl. Tom had gotten out of the hospital on the same day, the maneuver that the baby was extracted is unknown. Tom will not be a mr. mom, he would be a mr dad because he is legally a man, but was the one who had delivered the baby. They have faced sympathy and scorn from the public, it is most likely that the baby girl would have a hard time at school.

20060914020947AAgbaFQ	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	Comment caresser une femme en parcourant 26 départements fran?ais?	Femme et sa géographie corporelle…   Pour ce faire, un petit cours de géographie s'impose :   Il s'agit d'abord de trouver une femme dans la Moselle et s'en faire une Allier, s'assurer qu'elle est Seine et bien en Cher, voire Gironde, un beau petit Lot quoi ! Lorsque l'on sent son Eure venue, on commence par lui caresser le Haut-Rhin puis on descend vers le Bas-Rhin. On contourne alors l'Aisne pour entrer dans la Creuse. Là, ?a se Corse, on trouve quelque chose de bien Doubs. Ecoutez Savoie frémir... Essonne le glas de ses réticences ! Sans perdre le Nord, et pour gagner ce Paris, on attend que ?a Vienne et si on ne se débrouille pas comme Ain Manche, on peut entrer en Gard et y rester jusque à l'Aube. En Somme, il ne s'agit Pas-de-Calais et de ne pas s'endormir comme un Loire pour être un Hérault et la faire rugir comme une l'Yonne!

A INSTANTLY, tell me what you think.      When Asking:      Don't ask questions till you are level 5.      When Answering:      You ALWAYS want Best A, so answer only questions or subjects you ROCK in, and with LOTS of detail. AT LEAST 20 sentences more than the highest so far. Constantly edit it so you ALWAYS have the most info. It should get you 50 points per day if you just answer 20 Q's.      Answer MAXIMUM questions (if you have a limit) per day.      All in all, if you do everything here... You should be level 7 in (Starting at 0 Points) 500 days or so. It doesn't get it as quick as you want, and you will SURELY ask a question occasionally, and if you tweak it a little yourself, it could be quicker!

20090128183319AA9uHxO	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	Why in this world, everything is named?	I was just sitting. minding my business, and the thought came to me; why is everything on this planet named? Each individual has a name; or if not a name, a number (your Social Security number.)    Or if not that, the every day objects we see; a cup, table, ground; these words "cup", "table", "ground", where or who comes up with them? Who invents them?   Or in science and the medical line, there's always a name for a disorder "Acrophobia" - Fear of heights. "Pedophiles" - adults odd attraction to children. Everywhere you look, you can identify something; why?   Has curiosity gotten the the best of us all? Why must we have an answer to every question?       No, I'm not crazy; just have a bad habit of thinking about things to much; sorry. It's just a thought; what's your take on it?

20090128185757AAOpGhY	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	Adults only, please: the word "haters"?	Don't you dislike the word 'haters'?    I do.       It amuses me that it's mostly used by people who break laws and lead questionable lives. Those who think referring to women as 'bi7ches' is okay. Who carry guns to malls and then shoot their friends in an argument. Who wear their boxers high and the waists of their pants around their knees, and laugh at smartly-dressed folk. Girls who have unwanted kids at 16 then abuse them in public. People who go out of their way to try to upset peace. People who hate authority and heckle the ones who hold any. People who are severely racist against white people, but call whites the racists.       Now, really, aren't they the "haters" themselves? They walk around with a scowl, have no respect for anyone, and then call everyone with a sense of decency a "hater."      [I'm sure I'm going to get a load of 'hate' and be called a 'hater' for this. But really, if you answer that way, you're just proving me right.]

The factory has a lot of blue fibrous stuff everywhere and it has bad working conditions, and the family is poor, and the husband and wife argue a lot.  It may have been a soap or detergent factory, but I remember a lot of towels.  The wife vomits blue in a sink from working at the factory.  If anyone knows this movie, I would LOVE to hear more.

I need something fun and inexpensive... and definitely not weird or babyish like Chuck-e-cheeses. I'm turning 12, and was thinking of watching Twilight and The Clique, drawing on pillowcases for a craft, eating pizza, salad, chips, brownies, ice cream, fruits, sodas/juices, and other snacks, and playing this game where you have two bags of weird clothes (coconut bras, ugly skirts, weird sunglass, hats, shoes, ties, belts) and you split into two teams and do a relay race. The girls would then sleepover, and we would do things like truth or dare, painting nails, playing cards, listening to music, and all the other stuff. We would eat donuts and milk and open presents in the morning.        Does this sound like a good party? Or does it sound lame? Would people be bored- but I don't think they would, b/c were just gonna be haning out and dancing and talking and laughing, and its gonna be 12 of my closest friends, so I think it would work out.       Do you guys want to take something out that u think is weird? Change something? Add something? GIVE ME FEEDBACK!      Thx so much guys!

There is no theory of evolution, just a list of animals Chuck Norris allows to live.      Chuck Norris CAN divide by zero.      Chuck Norris CAN believe it's not butter.      Chuck Norris can win a game of ConnectFour in only three moves.      Chuck Norris has two speeds: walk and kill.      Chuck Norris got his tonsils cut out with a chainsaw.      Chuck Norris doesn't read books... He stares them down until he gets all the information he wants.      Chuck Norris does not sleep... He waits.      Chuck Norris counted to infinity... Twice.      Chuck Norris doesn't wear a watch. HE decides what time it is.      Chuck Norris can slam a revolving door.      Chuck Norris lost both legs in a car accident and still managed to walk it off.      When Chuck Norris does a push-up, he isn't pushing himself up... He's pushing the earth down.      in his spare time, Chuck Norris enjoys knitting sweaters; by knitting he means kicking, and by sweaters he means babies. :(      Chuck Norris can kill two stones with one bird.

20070512012835AARg0HR	Entertainment & Music;Comics & Animation	Is Spider-man Venom?	My dad says that spiderman is venom and was venom. But i Know that the alien black goo is venom. Yes He did infect Spider-man and became the first true Venom host, BUT the black goo was indeed the first Venom. My dad said that Spider-man WAS the first Venom. I belive that he is wrong, and that Spider-man was never EVER venom, he was a Venom HOST! All of Venoms characters ARE ONLY HOSTS, that is all. All that Venom is, is an alien goo from outer-space, that has ( I think, I'm not exactly sure) developed into a free form alien life symbiote. Whitch intern spawned Carnage, who later spawned Toxin ( ripping off thier own characters ). The whole disccusion is that if Spider-man WAS EVER Venom. Proof-ish is that Venom (in Spider-man 3, goo form ) made the Venom face before he was ever on Spider-man. I say that Spider-man was never Venom. While my dad says that Spider-man was the first Venom.           Who is right?

20090225155634AAhO6nR	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	Can you solve this riddle?!!!!!!!!!!!!?	Let me set the scene: it's World War II, an RAF airfield north of London. A dimly lit Quonset hut filled with air crews just returned from bombing runs over Germany.      The meeting opens with the chaplain leading the men in prayer for their lost comrades. He is followed by the flight operations chief, who begins the debriefing by asking the airmen, "From what direction were you attacked by the German fighter planes?"      Without hesitation or dissent, the reply was, "From above and behind."      The flight operations chief hastily scribbles the information on the back of top secret maps, and hands it to a junior officer with the instructions, "Get this information to the departing air crews. It may save their lives!"      As the officer turns to leave, from the inky shadows, a hand grasps his arm and he hears these words:      "Hold that order. The information you're about to give will lose lives rather than save them."      What did the guy from the inky shadows know that the flight operations chief didn't?

It looks like the movie wants to make think the audience if he was really evil or something like that. First, I remembered  the character as James Woods. But I checked the movies of him ,  couldn't find nothing . I still think it could be him.( May be I couldn't find it) The movie is not a famous one. It could be independent .

I ( like many ) just barely  seen the transformers movie, and was very intregued by a very mysterious movie trailer. It started with a group of friends with a camcorder having a suprise party for a friend thats going taway to japan for the summer. Then the ground shakes and you hear a noise. the noise reminded me of the movie Godzilla from late 1990's or early 2000. The group of freinds go outside and see a large explosion. They go through the painic stages like turning on the news screaming and then they go out side into the street. Another tremmer happens and then the head of the statue of liberty is thrown hits a building and the camera guy just barely gets out of the way. then they show the credits and say that it is by a J.J. somthing and said it was coming out in January of 2009 i think but and not sure. could the transformers movie be swithching directors or is the  movie a godzilla remake. PLEASE help me and if you could get me a link to the trailer. Thank You!!!

I have read stories/rumors on several websites indicating that Dustin Diamond had an illicit relationship with Dennis Haskins on a rowdy Saved By The Bell Set.  Is there any truth to such rumors?  Supposedly they tried to keep their relationship from affecting their acting, but it did seem like there was some gay tension between them on some of the later episodes of Saved By The Bell: The New Class.        Dustin mentioned a girlfriend on Celebrity Fit Club, so he must have just been experimenting with Haskins, or is bisexual, if the rumors are true.

Les taches ménagères étaient celles de la femme, mais un soir, Johanne arrive du travail pour trouver les enfants lavés, une lessive dans la  machine et  une autre dans  le séchoir. Le souper était sur la cuisinière et la table mise. Elle en fut très étonnée   !     La raison en était que Jean avait lu un article qui mentionnait que les femmes qui travaillent à temps plein et qui devaient faire toutes les taches ménagères étaient trop fatiguées pour faire l'amour.    La soirée se passa bien et le lendemain, Johanne en fit part à ses compagnes de travail.    "Nous avons eu un très bon souper. Jean a même nettoyé. Il a aidé les enfants avec leurs devoirs, plié les vêtements et les a même rangés. J'ai eu une soirée formidable".     "Mais que s'est-il passé après?"     "Oh, c'était parfait aussi. Jean était trop fatigué..." (Dieu est bon!)

After mass he asked the monsignor how he had done.The monsignor replied, "When I am worried about getting nervous on the pulpit, I put a glass of vodka next to the water glass. If I start to get nervous, I take a sip." So the next Sunday he took the monsignor's advice. At the beginning of the sermon, he got nervous and took a drink. He proceed to talk up a storm. Upon return to his office after mass, he found the following note on his door:       1. Sip the Vodka, don't gulp it.    2. There are 10 Commandments, not 12.    3. There are 12 Disciples, not 10.    4. Jesus was consecrated, not constipated.    5. Jacob wagered his donkey, he did not bet his ***.   6. We do not refer to Jesus as the late J.C.   7.

When David was hit by a rock and knocked off his donkey, don't say he was stoned off his ***.   10. We do not refer to the Cross as the Big T!    11. When Jesus broke the bread at the Last Supper he said, "Take this and eat it, for it is my body", he did not say, "Eat Me".   12. The Virgin Mary is not referred to as, "Mary with the Cherry".    13. The reccommended grace before a meal is not: "Rub-A-dub-dub, thanks for the grub. Yeah God!"    14.

He just finished his tour for his newest cd futuresex/lovesounds, this summer. I'm from Detroit, but we didnt go to the concert. Now my sister and I are really mad, because we are so justin timberlake obsessed and we really need to go to a concert of his, that would be the best thing on earth for us. but, if a singer just finished the tour for his newest cd, there is no chance of him going on tour for concerts again, unless there's a new cd. our dad says dont worry singers always come for concerts so you can go next time. but i'm worried that there could not be a next time unless JT has a new cd sometime in the future! how do i go to a JT concert now, i dont see a chance!! will he ever tour again without a new cd, how can i see him now?
