Sore throat, aches and pains, congested, etc. It started with a minor sore throat Tuesday and got a little worse each day. I crawled in bed Friday evening and didn't get out until Monday morning.I had never felt so awful in my life. I'm now feeling better for the most part but I do have some nasal drainage into my throat and a slight cough. I'm not coughing real hard or often but when I do I taste blood. I also will just swallow and it tastes and feels like I'm swallowing blood clots although I haven't seen any blood. I also have a numb feeling in my chest. Kind of like I smoked a menthol cigarette and my chest feels heavy. I'm 24 and haven't smoked in over a year. I'm pretty healthy other then hypersomnia and migraines. Should I be conncerned? I'm thinking it's just the final stages of the flu or whatever I had but wanted other opinions.  Thanks in advance!

20090305103451AAZE7N3	Health;Diet & Fitness	How do I get rid of my belly fat?	Summary version at very bottom.  Wall of text:      About October of 2007, I started to exercise doing a 10,000 walking program.  At the time, I weighed in 208 pounds, which is a HUGE amount considering my age at the time; despite my height at 5'9, I was only 13 going on 14.  For three days a week I used this program, and then I worked up to five days a week, and eventually seven.  After three months I was down already to 173.      After another four months I moved onto running, first for thirty minutes a day, then forty minutes a day, then forty minutes with incline, then recently back down to forty minutes with reduced incline.  By the time the one year anniversary passed, I was down to 155.        SUMMARY, AND CONTINUATION OF ABOVE: Fast forward to today, and I'm still at 155.  I've still got a belly fat problem.  I still run at 40 minutes per day, but I think it's the diet that's killing me; I might need to further change my diet.  Any tips?

20090305125645AAesCC6	Health;Diet & Fitness	The right diet for the right workout?	Hello. I'm trying to get in amazing shape for the military. Not for looks or for any other reason. I have been losing weight and trying to build muscle at the same time but the two acts are conflicting. I'm 250LBS 22 years of age, male, about 5'11" Right now I'm about 29% body fat. I was 325LBS on OCT 1st 2008, so I'm moving at a decent speed. I have been focusing on 4 exercises more than any other. Push ups, sit ups, 3 mile run, and about a 8-10 mile march. .      I try to do the push ups and sit ups every other day and in between those days I either do a long walk or run. However when I run or walk my muscles hurt from the push ups and sit ups and don't heal intime for everyother day. I have to wait about every 4 days to work them out again. I think my cardio work outs slow my muscles from healing and I would like a diet that works for both. I was also thinking that it could be because I'm still heavy. I do 4 reps of 20 for each sit and push ups.      all my carbs are oat, whole grain, wheat. I don't eat red meats and I stay away from large amounts of fat. I force myself to eat a large amount of chicken and sometimes I eat a protein bar. A total of about 1500 to 2100 calories a day.       What is the right diet for me, what am I doing wrong, how much protein should I eat, am I moving too fast?

Your grandma does not want to go to a nursing home but nobody wants to help her. She is like dead weight. Another, although she has a home health aid, cannot have everything done that is needed because her aid is on limited time. Another has problems with doctors who shrug her off even though her symptoms put her in unbearable pain. Another has dental problems and can barely eat.

20090305123355AA9nDsa	Health;General Health Care;Other - General Health Care	My Mum is lieing to my face that she has quit smoking, but i know she hasn't. Help?	I have always hated her smoking, and she has quit for 2 weeks then gone back to smoking probably one thousand times by now. But for her 'new years resolution' for 2009 - Was to quit smoking...      I was sitting at the dinner table, eating dinner, and her coat was behind me, something with a sharp edge was cutting into my back, so i looked in the pocket to see what it was, and to move it...Turns out it was a pack of cigarettes...   I put them under my legs so she wouldn't see when she came back into the dinning room. After dinner i went to the bathroom, i was so angry about the cigarettes, and the fact that she had been lieing to me about quiting for weeks.     I got all the cigarettes out the pack and ran cold water all over them so they would no longer be of use to her.    I know that i shouldn't destroy her stuff, but if she is going to smoke then she could at least have some respect and tell me! Also, if she is smoking in the house (not in the garden) then, i know it is her house and everything, but i have rights. I don't want to smoke, i think it is something only idiots do.      I put the wet cigarettes back in the packet then put them in her coat pocket where i found them. If she starts shouting at me, i will just move round my dads. I am so fed up of her smoking. I have even spent my own money of nicotine patches for her.      But, can anyone think of anything i could say to her (when she starts to shout at me) that would make her stop shouting at me and feel guilty for lieing and smoking? I only do it because i love her and i don't want her to die of lung cancer.    Help?

I can't have sex with someone I don't love and enjoy it, nor could I love myself if I did.  I am very attractive and could easily find willing men.

20070126123549AAFqmTX	Health;General Health Care;Injuries	Knee question?	So, during gym class we were playing handball but on our knees. It was a bad idea i know but it wasnt my idea. So, since i rubbbed it agenst the wresteling mats it got really red and swollen and i couldn't walk on it. I went to the doctor and he said I might have torn/pulled a ligament and sent me to an orthapedic. The orthapidic did x-rays but no MRI. He said I have premature patella Inflamation. He said it will go away soon with rest. Also, when i bend it, my knee cracks. It has been 2 1/2 weeks and the pain is still not any better. I am probably going back to get an MRI. I know what it is but what r the procedures? What do YOU think I have? And how is this treated? Do you know of any good websites?    And yes I have iced it, creamed it, elevated it, wraped it, rested it, and even ate these homiopathic pills. What could it be?

Or i'll want to be home instead of being at work all day, fuss about how the hours are completely shitty... (mine were 4-11 on weekdays and 1-6 on the weekends). Or even freak out because I didnt or KNOW i didnt have a consistent ride there.      It's days like that where I feel like going on disability because noone will hire this freakshow of emotions.      The problem here is that I WANT a job, but I cant KEEP a job. It's really starting to bother and confuse people.

My ob/gyn did a CT scan and everything looked normal.  My GP suggested that I may have adhesions/scars from the c-section.

20090227040900AASOpYQ	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Diabetes	Diabetics should always be given candy?	I took a CPR course a few days back, and something that the instructor told us offhand keeps bothering me. He said, "If a diabetic person is in shock, you should always feed him candy. He'll snap out of it." Is this true? I don't think this could be right. Isn't this only right when the patient is suffering from LOW blood glucose (hypoglycemia)? What if the patient is actually in shock from HYPERglycemia? Do you still give him candy? And how can you make sure it's hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia that he's suffering from? I can't ask him Have you had breakfast? if he's in shock.       Can somebody give me a clear answer on this?

20090227043558AAcvlnT	Health;Mental Health	Please help, elderly mother makes me want to die to end this misery?	Please help. I'm a 31 year old adult daughter of a psychriatically ill 68 year old mum. I dont have any siblings. My dad and her have a bad relationship in that she mentally abuses him, so he leaves her house at 10am every morning and does not come back until 8 or 9pm at night, he has his own place a half hours drive away. She is cared for in every practical way, financially, clothes wise, food and has her own independance and car. Her mental illnesses manifests itself in separation anxiety and a 100% lock solid idea in her head idea that my role is to give up my life and my boyfriend (who i live with for 8 years) for her, and she drives this home to me every time i meet her. She doesnt like my boyfriend and has bad mouthed him to people and i cannot bring him home to her house (where i go every 3 weeks and xmas, easter and any other special holidays..i have to be separated from my partner). She has fought and said nasty things to her family (brothers and sisters) and now they all exclude her from family events..so she has no one. She soemtimes turns up at family events and then they ring me and tell me the nasty things she said or done even though i cannot control where she goes. that has lead to me cutting those aunts and uncles out too...as they have never been a support to me only to tell me how nasty she behaves. One aunt rings me up and tells me word for word the nasty things shes said about me and to her and then tells me not to repeat it as shes doesnt want to get ate by her. This leaves me so upset. My dad says i should do more aswell, although i do all i can with her. I've spoken to her doctors and nurses and they say she is just dfficult and wil not change and she is under their care. She tries to control me and people just tell me i'm an adult and to stand up to her wickedness, but i feel shes acting out of desperation and i dont want to upset her more. My dad then also says i'm not to stand up to her and make his life more difficult. He says hes the one dealing with her dailly while i live 60 miles away, so he thinks i should be doing more. Shes coming to me for the weekend and my skin is so bad...please help me.. She even gets so far as accident and emmergecny and gets checked out over and over again in attention seeking behaviour taht keeps everyone worried. Please help   ALSO SHE HAS ACTUALLY BOOKED HERSELF INTO A PRIVATE NURSING HOME FOR THE PAST 4 NIGHTS AND MY DAD HAS PAID FOR IT BUT HAS SORT OF INFERRED THAT IF SHE WANTS TO STAY LONGER I SHOULD COUGH UP TOO. I'M STRUGGLING FINANCIALLY MYSELF AND SHE HAS THE FINANCE HERSELF IF SHE WISHED TO COVER IT.....      i've just spoken to her now and she tells me that she has no change of clothes that she went straight to the nursing home from A & E without any clothes althoug her and my father could have drove 6km by her house to collect a change of clothes knowing she was booking herself in to this home for a few nights. Shes told me this and now I am so upset, knowing my mam is in there with no change of clothes. Also my aunt will probably ring me feeling sorry for her, and almost inferring i should come 90km and organise it for my mum if she wants to stay more nights in the home. I know this is all manipulation but am i strong enough for this pressure.      My dad has his own place and keeps it in a state and although i go there and try to clean it, and i could organise help to do so , he will not allow it, he says he doesnt want strangers in his house, yet i'm worried about the way they live...      JUST TO CONFIRM, SHE IS UNDER PSYCHRIATIC CARE, HAS A DAY CENTRE TO VISIT, HAS HER MEDICATION BLISTER PACKED, HAS A GOOD NURSE AND DOCTOR TO VISIT AND A MENTAL HEALTH NURSE WHO CALLS TO HER SO SHE IS IN THE SYSTEM, HAS A HOMEHELP WHO CALLS ONCE PER WEEK, MUM IS 100% MOBILE AND PHYSCIALLY FIT, AND SHE DRIVES HER OWN CAR   Please answer:   1)  What is my moral and legal responsibilty to her?   2)  Why do relatives not help and always try to push her onto me, give no practical help at all and tell me the nasty things?

Etre seul comme l'enfant est seul quand les grandes personnes vont et viennent, melees a des choses qui semblent grandes a l'enfant et importantes du seul fait que les grandes personnes s'en affairent et que l'enfant ne comprend rien a ce qu'elles font. S'il n'est pas de communication entre les hommes et vous, essayez d'etre pres des choses: elles ne vous abandonneront pas. Il y a encore des vents qui agitent les arbres et courent sur les pays. Dans le monde des choses et celui des betes, tout est plein d'evenements auxquels vous pouvez prendre part. Les enfants sont toujours comme l'enfant que vous futes: tristes et heureux; et si vous pensez a votre enfance, vous revivez parmi eux, parmi les enfants secrets. Les grandes personnes ne sont rien, leur dignite ne repond a rien.

20070721085025AA0zqFq	Health;Mental Health	15 Years Old, Could I Have Depression? Im unsure what to do?	My names Chrissy, Im 15, and I need some advice...   This year has been pretty hard and lately I havent been happy. Nothing has gone horribly wrong in my life, just the loss of a few friends and my loss of innocence. I should be happy, considering I went to an amazing concert just last night, and Im around great people every day in camp. When I do feel happy it only lasts around a few hours. I get really depressed at home, and especially at night. I cant sleep well anymore, and even when I do sleep I still feel tired. I often cry for no reason, or over little things. Ive had suicidal thoughts before and have come pretty close to doing it, although I think sometimes I might have just been melodramatic. I have an intense fear of losing people, and I constantly feel like Im stuck and people are moving on without me. Im scared of the future and I cry over things that havent happened yet, and probably wont happen for a while. I dont know what to do, I just want to learn to love life again.
