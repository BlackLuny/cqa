Alot of the homes in Ohio will put you through the training and test you at the end of it, which saves you from taking the course at a local college.<br>  If you are good with people (which, in this field is VERY important) then this may fit you well.<br>  You can receive training at an accredited college to further your education in the medical field, it seems to be rolling with our economy.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!!
mh0QRDE9aa	I believe you are in the UK.  This is a world wide forum and jobs are scarce all over the world.  Stay in school and continue to get good grades.  Most employers want skilled, experienced and people who can work any hours.  These people have families to support and will get the jobs first since they have all the above.

b8uYVhVMaa	If company Y was a subsidiary of company X then it makes no difference and the contract would not be void.|`|UAW1U3Uoaa	Without seeing your full contract I cant say 100% but just because you are paid by a particular company does not automatically in the legal sense mean that you are therefore employed by them. I would imagine that you are legally an employee of company X and for some administrative reason they paid you via company Y.

e80d865060201c6543892c88a41bba3caa	Pubs are closing down at a very high rate just now and have been for a few years now.<br>  In my area alone in the past couple of years 6 pubs have closed.<br>  <br>  No, not a good idea at the moment. Even if it seems to be thriving now it is likely to drop of over the next few months when the recession grows.<br>  <br>  If you want to start a business then go with a pawn broker. They always do well in harder times.|`|LCIcUTwNaa	Yes, You should buy a pub in the uk and I will be your first customer.<br>  Good Luck!!|`|4gjAxw4saa	If your going to sell cheap beer and food and make a profit, yes.<br>  Get deals with the local farmers for produce, fruit ,meat and veg and you should be o.k.|`|L4z1FI5Kaa	If you do buy a pub, think of one where you might be able to include Bed & Breakfast so that you have another "string to your bow"<br>  This may be a time when people are more likely to do weekend breaks if they are unable to jet abroad for a holiday.|`|AOlNMMtEaa	personaly i believ that buyin a pub is the best thing you could do right now i have studdied social trends and as the unemployment increases the depression levels increase and so do pub profits because most people use this as a means of escape<br>  <br>  this s only my personal oppinion tho|`|Ld1vLH8Kaa	No. I think one of the most obvious places to see a decline in trade at the moment is the pub trade.|`|9f8XoDKJaa	Easy Answer<br>  <br>  No<br>  <br>  Economy sucks now|`|AA11327323	Sorry, that is one of the worse ideas I have seen in a long while.<br>                                             Pubs started going down hill almost immediately the smoking ban came into force.<br>                                              Fellers stopped at home in their thousands, they bought booze from the supermarket and saved a lot of money. <br>                                              200 grand is a lot to gamble with!<br>        This question is not as easy as it first looks.<br>                                                  Supermarkets are very busy trying to put each other out of business, it would be difficult to buy any stock as cheaply as they do.<br>                                                   In my small town we have two ￡1 shops, and even a 99p shop. All within a few yards of each other!<br>                                                   I have noticed quite a few 'charity' shops doing a roaring trade, One in particular, they get stuff donated , they price it up and within a couple of days it is sold.<br>                                                        Other charity shops price the stuff up as if it's brand new, they sell next to nothing, but they have a pretty window display?<br>                                                       May sound silly, but I think you need to get an income for the pair of you, with a minimum initial out lay.<br>                                                       I would suggest going into the second hand trade, rent a large display shop, allow folk to wander around freely, no hassle, advertise a lot locally, House clearances etc, get a large van, pick the stuff up, and get rid asap.|`|uKrRyVgVaa	Well it would be perfect if you start a business at the lowest point that the economy would go to just before it starts to recover and grow.<br>  At the end of the day such move is always a gamble... and I've lost ￡600 playing blackjack so I tell you gambling is bad.<br>  (Not a crappy player I just got pissed off and went mental... well actually yes I am pretty bad if that happened ><)|`|bc042c1d51863a0279ef168a1097903daa	Ordinary Pubs are struggling now. Yours would need to have something special about it. Live music, great food, attractive staff, a trendy atmosphere. A place where people can just have a morning coffee. I think that bog-standard pubs have had their day. For ￡200k, a trendy cafe would be worth considering. You are right though; this is a good time to start a business because costs are low. For ￡200 you could buy 2 or 3 properties at an auction (see Clive Emson) renovate them and sell them on, or get a tenant. <br>  Whatever you decide, good luck.|`|AA11220909	NO.<br>  <br>  There are 4 closing each week in my part of the UK - south west - at the moment.  Prior to the recession there were 4 each MONTH in the whole of England.|`|B08V01eRaa	good friend of mine has two pubs hes brillant landlord did well last year xmas and this year hes losing ￡2000 a week if people tighten their belts pubs resturants get hit the worst|`|G6t2O9Kmaa	Property prices are cheapest at the moment so I think its a good idea to take advantage of it.|`|BEu6LLrxaa	no pubs are closing down every day.not just because of the credit crush.it because of the prices in pubs.|`|OMYd6p3gaa	I really dont think thats a good idea. Its not very good to make an investment like that with the recession that happening. Pubs are great, but they need a lot of care and $$.|`|3uI0JAAwaa	Yes, in a depression, everyone want to drink...solid investment.|`|6oSCCqYcaa	No. buy woolworths|`|hmjAwZQEaa	no

mQZDizMVaa	Springer Foreign News Service<br>  500 5th Ave., NYC<br>  212-983-1983<br>  Near the intersection of 5th Av./W. 42nd St.<br>  <br>  if it's the store I think it is, they also carry foreign magazines.  It's on 42nd St., near Times Square. Used to pass it on my way to Port Authority.

5PQd5gSQaa	Mississauga is good, they've got great transportation and if you stay close to Bloor St you'll be able to take a bus to the far west stops (Kipling or Islingtion). <br>   Toronto is a fantastic city to live it, its alive with music, food and entertainment. If you do want to live in the downtown core of  I suggest checking out craigslist postings for wanted roommates. <br>   Yonge&Eglington is also a good area to start out in, there are plenty of apartment buildings with reasonable rent and they'll put you right on the subway line. <br>    Personally I'd try to stay as close to the downtown core as possible, the less travel time to work the better, and outside of work there are lots of places to go,to eat, things to do and to see!|`|cDETflFmaa	Both Mississauga to the west of Toronto and York Region to the north have a large number of IT businesses, as does Toronto itself. Transit in both areas is good, but not as comprehensive as it is in the city. Both suburbs are definately more car-reliant.<br>  <br>  I would personally locate in central Toronto until I found out where my job was. From central Toronto, you are less than an hour away from both suburbs by transit, but will need to pay fare twice - for the TTC and for the suburban transit. The benefit is that getting around on the weekend is much more convenient, and most Torontonians are within a 10 minute walk of 24-hour transit.|`|0iYoPLGIaa	I wouldn't live in Missisauga because it's far... I wouldn't call that a neighbourhood of Toronto, it is a city of it's own and uses a different transit system than Toronto. If I were you I would live in Toronto, somewhere close to the subway... you don't need a car when you live in Toronto. I don't know about the IT thing though... I'd say live somewhere off of Bloor.
iJ8MQ5HZaa	yes but there are many. you need to ask around or check superpages.com
