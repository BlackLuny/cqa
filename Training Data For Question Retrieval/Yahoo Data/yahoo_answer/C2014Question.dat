20080124103247AAc4e1S	Consumer Electronics;Home Theater	Blablabla?????????????????????…	Desde peque?os nos han dicho que consumir leche es algo sano e imprescindible; incluso, algunos van más allá diciendo que si no consumimos leche y sus derivados estamos en un grave riesgo de padecer enfermedades que nos pueden llevar hasta una completa desnutrición y futura muerte. Toda esta teoría se refuerza aún más si le sumamos los millones y millones de dólares que invierten las empresas involucradas en la Industria Láctea en todo tipo de publicidad: televisión, radio, letreros, gigantografías, internet, etc. (solo es cosa de recordar la fuerte campa?a publicitaria en que aparecían famosos diciendo "yo tomo leche"). Sin quedarse conformes con la inversión en publicidad, destinan recursos para pagarle a sospechosos (por decir lo menos) médicos para que salgan en los spots informándonos sobre el nuevo producto de tal o cual empresa lechera.      En resumen, existe una inversión millonaria desde hace ya un buen tiempo por parte de estos grupos económicos que se benefician del consumo de lácteos. ?Qué busca esta gran inversión?, pues bien, cubrir un objetivo esencial: la desinformación sistemática de la sociedad respecto a las carentes propiedades nutritivas de la leche, los elevados índices de toxinas que presentan y la verdad respecto a las crueles prácticas de las actuales Industrias Lecheras.      La vida de una vaca lechera   Si tú eres una de las personas que evitan el consumo de carnes por razones éticas, ya que tú al igual que nosotros consideras que consumir carne es moralmente incorrecto producto de que para la obtención de un trozo de ella es necesario utilizar crueles mecanismos que implican un sufrimiento despiadado hacia los animales de crianza intensiva, con mayor razón deberías evitar el consumo de la leche y todos sus derivados, ya que es la industria láctea como así también la industria de los huevos , las que más sufrimiento causan a millones de animales en todo el mundo.      Mientras que los medios de comunicación nos siguen mostrando la hipócrita imagen de que las vacas lecheras viven libremente en las praderas, felices junto a sus crías pastando en la tranquilidad de las monta?as (como ciertos spots televisivos), todas ellas son criadas en deplorables condiciones: hacinamiento, suciedad, orde?o intensivo, mala alimentación, embarazos forzados, administración de hormonas, antibióticos y tranquilizantes, etc. La vaca lechera moderna es criada, alimentada, medicada, inseminada y manipulada para un solo fin: producir más y más leche.      Producto del desarrollo tecnológico, actualmente ya no se utiliza el "orde?o manual" , sino que el llamado "orde?o mecánico", el cual permite orde?ar a los animales 2 ó 3 veces al día, de esta forma la producción media de una vaca de granja intensiva alcanza aproximadamente unos 4.000 litros anuales, y sin conformarse la industria sigue buscando nuevos procedimientos para aumentar estas cifras.      Este sistema excesivo además de ser muy doloroso y molesto, provoca heridas, inflamación e infecciones en las ubres, lo cual obliga a la industria a administrar medicamentos y antibióticos; los cuales permanecerán en el vaso de leche que usted ha de beber.      En su estado normal, las vacas no dan leche todo el tiempo (como es la creencia de muchas personas). Las vacas tienen que parir para producir leche, leche que debería ser el alimento de su cría. Sin embargo, para mantener elevada la producción de leche, las industrias fuerzan a las vacas a tener un embarazo cada a?o. Esto se hace porque tras el parto la producción es máxima y podrá ser orde?ada intensivamente durante aproximadamente 10 meses hasta el siguiente embarazo. Lo anterior se realiza mediante inseminación artificial o por implante de embrión.      Por otro lado, los terneros son removidos del lado de sus madres apenas nacen, lo que les causa a ambos una profunda depresión.      Los terneros son encerrados en corrales especiales con suelo de cemento o metal. Sus jaulas solo les permiten estar de pie o estirados, ni siquiera pueden darse la vuelta. Estos terneros son mal nutridos y la mayoría padece anemia ; no se les permite moverse, ya que si hicieran ejercicio y se alimentaran de mejor forma, la carne para servir en el plato se tornaría más oscura y dura , por supuesto, esto es lo último que desearía el productor.      Para obtener un ternero gordo y débil en el menor tiempo posible, el productor lo alimentara con una dieta líquida deficiente en hierro y basada en una combinación de leche en polvo y aditivos (cuando en realidad debería alimentarse de pastizales).      El único día en que abandonarán sus celdas, será el día en que serán puestos en un camión directo al matadero.      Por último, cuando desciende la productividad lechera de la vaca, lo cual sucede aproximadamente tras 4 o 5 lactancias, y en oposición a su esperanza de vida de 20 - 25 a?os, serán enviadas al matadero luego de su dolorosa existencia, para que sus maltrechos y enfermos cuerpos se transformen en un trozo de carne para servir en el plato de algún comensal (de hecho, aproximadamente el 70% de la carne de vacuno procede de vacas lecheras), transformar sus restos (huesos, tendones, vísceras varias, etc.) en unas deliciosas vienesas o hamburguesas y, para sacarle el máximo provecho, sacarles el pellejo estando muchas aún conscientes para así elaborar cuero para vestir.      Ya en el matadero, el procedimiento es similar al de cualquier animal de engorde; es decir, serán colgadas de una sola pata con cadenas boca abajo, luego se les hará una peque?a perforación en la garganta para que se desangren lentamente.      Te preguntarás por qué se usa este método, ?simple!, cuando los animales entran a un matadero presienten lo que les va a suceder, ?cómo?, sienten el olor a putrefacción y sangre que ronda el lugar, y mientras están en fila esperando su hora, escuchan los desesperados gritos de dolor y horror que emiten sus compa?eras que en ese momento están siendo desangradas y mutiladas estando la mayoría aún concientes. Ante esto, el animal que espera en la fila apreta fuertemente sus músculos de puro miedo y terror. Obviamente, el empresario no va a entregar carnes "duras" a los consumidores, por esta razón es que cuelgan a los animales boca abajo y les hacen un peque?o orificio en la garganta para que poco a poco vayan perdiendo el conocimiento producto del desangramiento (sangre que también se aprovechara para elaborar las tradicionales "prietas" o el conocido "niachi"); de esta forma, los animales mueren con sus músculos "sueltos y blanditos" para ser degustados por algún aficionado al consumo de cadáveres.      Cada vez que compras productos lácteos y en el envase se observa el nombre de alguna marca, sea cual sea ésta, siempre, en todo Chile o en cualquier parte del mundo, ese producto procederá de los procesos industriales anteriormente descritos. Sería ingenuo que cuando compras un yogur en el kiosco de la esquina pensaras que esa leche proviene de vacas libres pastando en la pradera y felices junto a sus crías.      Probablemente, si viajas a un sector muy rural puedas encontrar algunos fundos con unas cuantas vacas que no son tratadas como en las grandes factorías. Pero, así incluso, no puedes dejar de preguntarte si es ético consumir un producto que fue hecho para otros fines. LAS VACAS PRODUCEN LECHE PARA SUS CRíAS, NO PARA LOS HUMANOS. ?Por qué tanta resistencia a comprender este principio básico de la naturaleza? ?Tan idiota y egoísta es nuestra especie? ?Acaso ya dejamos de pensar y reflexionar?... Por el momento, aún tenemos esperanzas de que podemos mejorar y cambiar nuestras actitudes cotidianas entre nosotros y con nuestro entorno. Esta en nuestras manos, no en la de los políticos.

I bought a Sidekick 3, and it wouldn't charge.   Now T-Mobile won't exchange my phone for a new one directly, have to ship it in and all of that,   so they said I can get a temperary flip phone to use, just go to their store.. So I went to their store, and they say I need to put 100 dollar deposit down.   No, they sold me a defected phone, I shouldn't have to run around or go through troubles.      Today is the last day I can cancel my contract with T-Mobile for no charge, so should I cancel and go with Helio?   or stay with them? Which phone is better?      From my understandings, Helio does basically the same things as Sidekick 3, except for does MORE, and the things that are the same, are better. (better camera, faster internet, java-script supported..)      Advice?

Now I get my bill and there is the application cost and also the "data charges" while I was playing the game.  This game was not one you need to be connected to anything for - it's like solitaire. I was under the impression that once you download the game it is on your phone not related to the network whatsoever.  My old cell phones were Verizon and Sprint, neither of which charged data costs to play the games you bought.      Has this happened to anyone else and what can we do about it?

I'm wanting to buy a HDD (hard disk) DVD player to record TV and wonder if the equipment would be compatible with Virgin Media's digital box. I'm using the Explorer 4000DVD (had it for 4 years when it was still Telewest).      The Sony RDR-HXD890 with freeview that I'm looking at has an inbuilt freeview digital decoder.        http://www.amazon.co.uk/Sony-RDR-HXD890-...          What's confusing me is: will the freeview decoder be bypassed if I plug in Virgin's decoder box?  Freeview is of no use to me as I don't have an aerial - and have only got cable.      What I would appreciate is, if someone is using a HDD DVD recorder similar with in-built freeview - and hasn't experienced any compatibility problems when connecting to a Virgin Media digital box to let me know.      Even better, if you can recommend a cheaper compatible Virgin HDD DVD recorder than what I've listed.      Thanks in advance.

I have already talked to my mom and she said there is a good chance that if i do really well in school i will get one in June when school ends.  But the thing is my grades are pretty bad (D's) and I don't think they are going to go to A's that easy.  I am trying but i don't think its possible      Another thing is that it was my birthday in December, 16th birthday but that's all i really have going for me.  My dad also doesn't know about it yet and hes going to be the one making the final decision, hes also pretty strict.  There really is no money factor, i have enough money to buy one myself but my parents wont let me buy anything to interfere with school so money isn't the issue.      So ANY help is appreciated, I really want a PS3, thanks guys.

So, I clicked yes on my video camera to format it. Apparently, it decided to either delete them all or something. Now, I can't find the pictures or videos.   So, my question is, did I delete them? Can I get them back? What does formatting mean on the video camera?      Anything at this point will do. I'm in tears and I need help. Thanks!
