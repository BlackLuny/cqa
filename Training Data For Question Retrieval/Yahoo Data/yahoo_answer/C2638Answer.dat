c64cfd32e7e9ba18e3ede6c7a2b89932aa	PATH trains operate 24/7 but on weekends and weekday late night the 33rd St  to Journal Square train operates to Hoboken first and then continues on to Journal Square.    Aside form the PATH, there is also NJ Transit from Penn Station to Newark.      Take the AirTrain at JFK to either:    1)  Howard Beach - take the A train to Penn Station     2)  Jamaica  - take the E train to Penn Station    Option 1 is generally recommended if you have luggage as the Howard Beach station is more "luggage friendly".    The subway trip takes about 1 hour.    There are trains from Penn Station to Newark at 11:07 PM, 11:14 PM, 11:18 PM, 11:56 PM, 12:18 AM, 12:42 AM, 12:42 AM ans 1:18 AM (based on NE Corridor and NJ Coast line timetables)    NJ Transit Fare to Newark one way - $4.00.    If you prefer PATH, then at Penn station exit to 7th Av and walkover to 6th Av to get the PATH train.    At that hour PATH trains leave 33rd St about every 20 minutes.  The trip to Journal Square takes about 26 minutes.  Add another 15-20 minutes (waiting and travel time)  from Journal Sq to Newark.     PATH fare is $1.75.|`|yk4S7uuraa	Yes, the PATH operates 24/7, 365 days per year.    They do, however, have a Sunday schedule which differs from the weekday schedule.

Justice, "We are your friends."  Usher, "Love in this club."  Eminem, "Lose yourself."    And, finally, a lesser known song, but certainly the most fitting, lyrically, "The Ballad of Barry Allen," by Jim's Big Ego.

hG8FMFUeaa	nigel is incorrect. the secondary oxygen sensor does not control fuel flow. it only tells your computer if your catalytic converter is working properly. besides the fact that only obd II systems have downstream oxygen sensors  so it does not apply to this vehicle. as for your question. no it will not hurt. yes it is illegal. if you get caught there is a fine. if you sell it no you won't get a fine because you can say you bought it like that. a shop will not do it for you do to it being highly illegal. go to an exhaust shop and have them install a high flow catco catalytic converter for around 100 bucks parts and labor. it will boost performance and it will still be legal. yes your engine will run different with no cat. all engines require a certain amount of back pressure to run correctly. it should run ok but it may lose a little performance or gain a little performance its hit and miss. my recommendation is to get a high flow cat and be done with it. and bandit is wrong the check engine light will not come on because it doesnt have a down stream o2 sensor. it is a 1990.|`|t97dGuLgaa	i normally buy an aftermarket converter and a lot of short pipes and adapters get aggravated real bad but i save money and the COMPUTER is happy when the computer is unhappy it messes with fuel delivery and other things|`|zOIgzIy4aa	it won,t hurt the motor except the check engine light might stay on and if you decide to sell it you will have to put it back on because it,s illegal to have it off.|`|51d9e39c71aaaed7424c9ac49e9069c5aa	It might seriously hurt your wallet if you ever decide to sell or trade the vehicle.

So thus you'll have to figure out a way to keep the secondary O2 sensor hooked up.    What you are planning on doing is illegal - a federal offense, which legally could result in seizure and crushing of your vehicle.    That said - why not just cut open (on the top side) your rattly catalytic converter, remove the rattly stuff, seal it back up and re-install it?  Still illegal, but solves other issues.|`|AA10248469	If it is rattling it is only a loose heat shield. Tighten it up. Everything you are talking about is a whole lot more work plus it is illegal.

If it blocking your mailbox, call around various towing companies - you will probably be able to find one that will tow it away.|`|WO68RZdIaa	Due to numerous privacy laws, the main one being the Drivers Privacy Protection Act- you cannot obtain any information from a vehicles registration number.

If the vehicle is blocking the mailbox to the extent that the mail carrier cannot access it, the USPS will refuse to deliver your mail.

Bl9zcqxQaa	The 3.1, 3.4 and 3.8 liter engines in those cars had a big problem with the lower intake gaskets leaking coolant internally and externally.   GM was extending the warranty on some of them because they are such a problem.    Have the coolant system leak checked as soon as posssible, as coolant mixing with oil can severly damage your engine and wear out internal bearings.   The only other thing that can cause that would be wither a crack head or blown head gasket, although they are not as common as the lower intake gaskets.   The intake gasket job usually will cost you around 6-800 dollors, but if not fixed, eventually you will need an engine, which is much more costly.  Good luck|`|zOIgzIy4aa	you probably have a head gasket leaking. anti-freeze is probably going through the combustion chamber and out the tail pipe.|`|51d9e39c71aaaed7424c9ac49e9069c5aa	It could be a bad head gasket or cracked head.   I doubt condensation would be that severe as to cause the oil to become a "milky gunk."|`|WKcC0Qayaa	no, not directly    you have one or more of the following:  * blown head gasket  * cracked head  * cracked block.|`|mqXyDTwwaa	Maybe a cracked water jacket. Antifreeze is leaking into the oil, which is why you're losing antifreeze. The milky substance is the antifreeze in the oil.|`|4a0Akgieaa	Let me guess, it has a 3.1 or 3.4 V6?

Keep in mind Oldsmobile is a brand that has a low resale value in general because GM discontinued the Oldsmobile brand several years ago.  That might explain why the car is cheap.    Otherwise, remember that you car DOES have 109k miles.  Depending on the car's history, you may get transmission/cylinder head gasket/radiator/other issues eventually.
UU76HDwoaa	How fast depends on which motor.    Since a stock computer is governed to 120mph, that is the max speed you can go.  A 3.0 V6 car can make the speed limiter.  The 2.5 I4, most like not.    Now, I've had my daytona iroc 3.0 V6 with 5spd at an estimated 130mph.  My speedo was disabled at the time.  I was nearing redline in 5th gear.  My daytona was able to do 120mph at redline in 4th.  My daytona made 160whp and 181ft lbs of torque at the wheels.    Alot of 3.0 owners use to put a kill switch on the speedo.  This would allow them to past the 120mph limit without causing drivability problems.  The cars like to stall when coming to a stop when the computer doesn't see a mph reading.  This wouldn't be a good idea for a 4spd auto car.    My current shadow doesn't have a speed limiter.  Since the car is a convertible, I've only hit 120mph once.  This was quite a surprise to a coworker in his audi.  He thought his A4 would easily beat my shadow on the highway.  I proved him wrong as I was able to pass him.  Since the top makes alot of noise at such a sustained speed, I don't like going past 100mph.    Even my neon sport doesn't have a speed limiter.  But its 2.4 with 3.55 geared transmission had a hard time even holding 115mph on the highway.  I reached the max speed limit based on the car's horsepower and gearing.  Perhaps with the 3.94 tranny, I'll have to retest the neon.|`|WKcC0Qayaa	assuming that it is in good shape; the four cylinder version will do somewhere between 100 and 110 mph.

M7G3MZb5aa	A "HEMI" Engine is really just a sales gimmick done by dodge.    The word hemi is short for hemispherical, which si the shape of the combustion chamber above the cylinder, its shaped like a dome, or a hemi-sphere.    In the past, valves had different configurations and im not going to get into it, but wayyyyy back in the day, dodge INVENTED the hemispherical head design where intake valves come in from one side, and exhaust valves come in angles the opposite way.  Well they didnt so much as invent it, but they made it avialable to the masses and marketed it as the hemi, in reality, i beleive that valve configuration dates back to circa 1916 with a few cadillac and bugatti prototypes.  It was a huge leap in performance over other cylinder head designs. And at the time, having a "hemi" meant you had a really powerful motor in comparison to other motors that were available.    Then, decades later, Dodge brought back the term "hemi" as a sales gimmick, and it was genius, thousands of dodge owners now believe that they have something special in their car/truck because they have a "hemi" when in fact almost every single engine that isn't a lawn mower engine, has a hemispherical/pentespherical head design.  Even some lawn mower engines have overhead valve configurations now, i mean, like that's how NOT SPECIAL it is.    -----fuel consumption is effected most by the mass of the vehicle, and the earodynamics of the vehicle, however an extremely powerfull motor will often result in watsed fuel from the user accidentlly accelearting too much and having to apply the brakes.  You cant just label the fuel efficiency fo a motor alone, unless you rated it in terms of its chemical efficiency, if thats the case, most combustion engines effectively convert about 25% of the chemical enrgy available into physical enrgy directed toward propelling the car, the rest is turned into heat.    About the video, i dont know why the car does that, its known as "slipping the clutch" i have never seen an automatic car do that.  Typically you only do that when racing to acheive maximum torque to the wheels, it burns up clutches.    Now you have 4 top contributors|`|51d9e39c71aaaed7424c9ac49e9069c5aa	I understand the sudden drop and increased speed as the tach revs back up - that's simply a shift in gears - but what you point out in your question makes me suspect that perhaps what we are viewing may not be completely on the up and up.|`|c48nm70gaa	First of all the U-Tube display says it's a Cummins motor not a Chrysler Hemispherical Head gasoline engine.     Any Hemi (hemispherical) head engine is a four cycle engine with a very unique shaped combustion chamber. Instead of the valves extending into the combustion chambers side by side the intake valve it tipped way over toward the intake port side of the combustion chamber. The exhaust valve is tipped over toward the exhaust side of the combustion chamber. This lay-out promotes easier free flowing breathing angles for the valves and ports.    The shape of the combustion chamber is more like an umbrella than a normal wedge designed chamber.    The U-Tube freak show gave no view of what they were trying to brainwash you with. The Only reason the tachometer wasn't moving was it most likely was a low RPM high horsepower double  turbocharged and inner-cooled diesel engine with some kind of super slipper drag type Crower Glide transmission at the Bonneville Salt Flats.|`|iTj5NdH1aa	They are the same as any other engine. "Hemi" is a term used to describe the engine because they have hemispheric combustion chambers.|`|JA2p5V06aa	it stays near 3000 rpm because, the vehichle is changing gears. The hemi works like any other internal combustion engine.|`|X2ED3OrRaa	The HEMI is short for the word hemisphere. It is in reference to the shape of the combustion chamber in the heads of engine. {CIRCULAR}  The engine itself is just a naturally aspirated engine just as all fuel burning engines are.[non turbo or blown]  The HEMI heads was mass produced by CHRYSLER in America in the early 60's and only on some engines. They stray away from it's use for years after a successful ' MUSCLE CAR' use of the head design during the energy shortage of the early 70's.   EVERY BODY, especially the european and japanese uses and silently sell engines with HEMI heads.   Chrysler uses the  word to hint to us as a 'performance oriented' type engine and for all practical purposes, IT SELLS.    The next time you are under the hood of a car, look to see if the spark plug hole is through the valve cover. If it is, 'THERE IS A HEMI'!!    CONSUMPTION?    Which hemi? The moped or the 18 wheeler?  BOTH ARE HEMI's.     LOOK AT THE  RPM  vs THE TACH AGAIN.  What you stated cannot be true!                                        "BRILLIANT:!!!!

3NoQuoWuaa	Either you need more practice driving or you need to get over your nervousness when the examiner gets in you car. State requirements vary from state to state on driving tests. Your state obviously requires a high passing rate. You need to settle down and think about what you are doing when taking the test.r|`|FbtEvsIGaa	i dont . you need to do more practice driving . maybe a school|`|4Nbiuj6Gaa	The reason why you have to do it again is because you showed in the previous test that you understand what a stop sign is and 3 point turn, then you messed both up.  A stop sign is there for a reason, so you need to obey it. It doesn't show good driving potential if you miss such an important and general sign on the road.     Good luck for the next test.
3NoQuoWuaa	the answer is simple. Go get a drivers license. That is what they are telling you.|`|e9c3e42d64ceb58add3e61412e049096aa	Not exactly true.  If you have an international license, and you are here legally, as in, a legal resident, you can register the car, but you'll need a US licensed driver to be listed, and you excluded, to get the insurance.

SLSX6QQsaa	Theres a recent story on the news where a woman (I think someone related to a famous person) walked into her garage where her car was warming up, and immediately fell down and passed out, dying from the carbon monoxide.  It can and does happen.  And chances of dying from it without being contained is very slim.  Its going to happen when you are trapped in a small space where the fumes are getting into your car and building up.  You could get a carbon monoxide detector like what you use for the home and just put one in your car but I wouldn  t bother.  Just open your garage door so the fumes can air out when you are warming it up.|`|r8Sme80raa	Only if you leave your mouth on the tail pipe and leave the garage door closed while the engine is running!|`|TdrgZwnoaa	Forget your garage. This stuff is getting into your house too. And it doesn't take much to start doing you harm. The human body's respiration system is very lazy and It would rather absorb carbon monoxide over oxygen any time.   Noticed any headaches lately?|`|h6NqNzHAaa	In an enclosed space where the carbon monoxide can collect, yes you can die. Sitting in a parked car, outside, the chances are extremely slim. Millions do it all the time.|`|kjAWsDwLaa	Yes, it's carbon monoxide, and it's deadly if you get enough of it.  If you do still want to keep your engine running, crack a window an inch or two and keep the heater fan running, set to outside air, not recirculate.  Also, have your exhaust system professionally checked to make sure it's tight.|`|XLXncQu9aa	Well, the answer is yes you can die from leaving your car running, but the catch is it must be in an enclosed place like a garage for this to happen.  That is why it is not advised to warm your car in the garage.  The first reason is that if the garage door is close while you are warming it, you can breathe in the carbon monoxide.  Secondly, the deadly gas can seep into the house causing others to die as well.  Always warm your car outside where the gas can escape.  Just don't do it in enclosed places, you are a lot safer that way.|`|31Ttgqlbaa	You shouldn't leave your car running for 30 minutes. It's not good for the engine and you are wasting a lot of gas. And I think 30 minutes of carbon monoxide in the garage can lead to lethal carbon monoxide poisoning. I think at least 20 (or less) minutes would endanger anybody's life in the garage. I would have the garage door up while the car is running and not have it running any longer than 5 minutes. But I wouldn't think that would even be necessary if the car is in the garage because it'll be a lot colder if the car was sitting outside. Also, I think a car warms up quicker while driving it.|`|omHDMybgaa	yes you can die like that. Yes it is the carbon monoxide gas that can kill you. I don't think you can die if your car is outside but i am no sure. But yes in the garage if the door is closed|`|51d9e39c71aaaed7424c9ac49e9069c5aa	Long before you die, you'll get a pounding head ache and feel nauseous and dizzy as hell if the CO is concentrated enough - that's why the driver took sleeping pills first and why he parked in an enclosed garage. He apparently wanted a painless death.|`|AA11900069	Workshops where cars will be run indoors have to have a flexible nozzle to go on the tail-pipe to allow the Carbon Monoxide (deadly at 4% concentration) to vent to the atmosphere - think something like the vent on a tumble-dryer.     If your garage is attached to the house, Carbon Monoxide could leech into the house, and at lower concentrations can still cause nausea and headaches in the healty, and presents a significant health risk to those already ill.  Granted it is cold where you live, but you could get a water pre-heater, which warms your cars' water up to give you a working heater and gets the engine up to temperature before you start it - they run off the mains electricity.  It has to be safer!

0Z9jssmfaa	That depends on the space available you have for the box, and the power you want to achieve. A sealed box will give you the top power capability (100%) of your subs (check the spec sheet that comes with them) and be a smaller box since sealed boxes require a smaller space. It will also give you a quicker cone response (tighter bass). The downside is that you may lose a small bit of the boomy feel (not much at that power though), and many box builders can't/won't build a sealed box because the internal volume needs to be perfect to achieve proper and maximum performance (which requires a LOT more expertise than the regular-joe installer has). A ported or bandpass box is probably your best bet. The flow of air is what gives these boxes their boomy resonance. They are also easier to tune by using fluid dynamics and accoustic resonance principles by modifying the size of the ports. The downside is the boxes are bigger, the bass is a bit sloppy (I speak performance wise, if you like it like that then go for it), and your maximum power output for the subs is about 2/3 to 3/4 of the maximum rating --check the spec sheet (if you run 3000 watts to each sub in a ported/bandpass box you'll blow them sooner or later -probably sooner). Remember those ratings are based on optimum performance conditions, a sealed box holds the cone tighter because the cone pushes against the enclosed air making it stronger so it can handle the higher power. So basically, unless your planning on running 3000 watts to each sub (maximum power) you don't HAVE to go sealed. A ported or bandpass box will give you the boomy kind of bass you want as long as it's built well --and it'll be cheaper. Just a note dude, if your serious about this then also upgrade your component speakers and for the love of god power tham with an amp too! You want to be able to hear rest of your song and everyone will be impressed if they can hear 50 Cent's voice from a block as well as the bass. I'd also recomend a serious power system upgrade if you haven't already. This is way easier to do before you get all the goodies installed.|`|7ObGOaPPaa	ok I read through half of dave's response, and couldn't read it any longer. he is somewhat confused about how subwoofers, and boxes work.    first to answer your question, a ported box will be better. sealed boxes really can't compare to ported boxes when it comes to loudness. thats because sealed boxes block off the sound waves from one side of the woofer, and the ported box uses the rear and front soundwaves, meaning it is more efficient, and louder.    second sealed boxes are waaaaaaay easier to build then ported boxes, and you don't need any special knowledge to build one. it doesn't have to be exact. with subwoofers, there is always a range that you can work with.    ported boxes are harder to build, because of the port and tuning it.    while it is true that small (as in smaller than the recommended size) sealed boxes will allow a subwoofer to run with more power, its not significant enough to make up for the loudness that you get from a ported box.    third subwoofers in sealed boxes won't really give you a "quicker cone response" than a subwoofer in a ported box will. this really has little to do with the box at all, and more to do with the actual subwoofer, and amplifier that you are using.    sealed boxes provide more accurate bass because the range that the subwoofer plays isn't influenced or limited by the box. a ported box has a frequency range in which the subwoofer plays its loudest, then one outside of this range, the volume drops off. in a sealed box, this range doesn't exist. so the soofer is only limited by it own capabilities. But inside the range that a ported box is tuned for it will be much louder than a sealed box.|`|9TiP37XOaa	deponds on what kind of vehicle you are puting it in|`|G5cBAB2Caa	yes!!! go ported
cQqc1Qicaa	Would you Puh-leeze get it scanned?  At least then you'd have some idea what to check instead of randomly trying things.  On the other hand, you're probably right in that your RF wheel bearing is probably going South.  A driving indication is that the noise gets louder when turning one way and quiet the other.  Jack the suspect wheel up (all of them if it's AWD).  Spin the wheel with one hand while resting the other on the upper control arm.  Any rumble or coarseness indicates a rough bearing.  If it's really loose, it can take out the ABS wheel speed sensor. A correct replacement hub assembly will contain a new sensor.|`|M7G3MZb5aa	It is possible i suppose, since on SOME cars the abs sensor is built into the hub/bearing assembly.  If your bearings failed, its likely that they woudl be getting VERY HOT possibly damaging the abs sensor by melting it since it may eb in close proximity.  Im just confirming that tis possible.    I would first check all of your abs connections at the wheels, and if thats not the case, get the error code, it will shed lgiht onto where the problem is.|`|N4IGdJXwaa	Yes, the wheel hub could cause the malfunction, and you would need to purchase a new one.  You can not rebuild the wheel hub, sorry.  For $123 you can purchase new wheel hubs at http://mibearings.com/paypalparts/515003...  Bad hub assemblies are known to cause grinding noises when they are on death row.   Also, it would be the front, because there is no ABS sensor in the rear (on the bearings).  I hope that helps!|`|AA11665535	yes, it could be the brg hub assy. if it is bad the clearance between the tone ring and sensor will be out of specs, tripping the abs light. Best best on the explorer is to replace the bub brg assy with new/rebuilt one, they aren't easily rebuilt by a home mechanic.
fNoDk12caa	Just talk to a supplier located around you. You can search for the car part you are looking for from http://www.automotive-online.com and you will get the list of suppliers with contact details.|`|H8XpaaPDaa	you know it doesn't matter where the car is made, as long as you buy the headlight for the same car from the same year, your fine...      btw, just go to your local junk yard and buy one, its a lot cheaper.|`|AA11880026	may I call you mumbles??
cQqc1Qicaa	You probably bent the steering knuckle too.  This type of damage usually has a severe effect on alignment and you may shave your tires if you continue to drive it like this.  You are also more likely to skid again.  You can do it yourself, just go ahead and do it.  You'll need a jack and stands, hammer, large pry bar, wrenches and sockets.  Typical hex sizes in Asian cars are: 10, 12, 14, 17, 19, 22 and 24mm.  If you don't want to pay for a four-wheel, ask for a front end-only alignment after you've installed the parts.  Get the arm and link online and the wheel from a salvage yard.  If the Camber angle is too far positive and there's more than one degree of difference in the included angle  compared to the 'good' side, the knuckle's bent.  If you have to change it, you'll need a large axle nut socket and possibly a puller to get the outer CV joint out of the hub.  Get the knuckle from a salvage yard, but be sure to check the bearing by turning it; it should be glassy smooth.|`|c9uCz19taa	Depending on your location $50-100 an hour is typical.  Common shop markup on parts is 50-100 percent and they usually get their parts from a non discount parts store like Napa or Carquest...not Autozone, Advanced, etc.  I'd definately try to buy a used rim from a salvage yard.    If any of the damaged pieces break you could easily lose control of the car and crash...and you will be liable for knowingly driving a damaged vehicle.  Severe tire wear is also likely.|`|dIoluUZ8aa	Having the control arm break will most definitely not be a fun experience, especially at highway speeds. It's an integral part of any suspension system.    Having it straightened out is a band aid fix and not recommended. While the control arm can be bent back into shape, the initial impact has left the metal permanently weak.   Think of it like a paper clip. It can be bent straight, but as soon as you wiggle back and forth a bit it breaks.    $94/hr is not outrageous, but control arm replacement can be done on your own, provided you have the basic DIY tools such as a set of sockets, wrenches etc. If you decide to go this route, make sure you buy either a factory service manual, or a Haynes manual that will guide you through the process.    The rim can be replaced from the junk yard, as long as you take the rear wheel off of a vehicle with front end damage, or vice versa.  You could also swap your spare wheel (if fulls size) and keep the damaged as a spare.    After the repairs are done, which ever route you go by, you should get an alignment. This should fix your pulling to the side as you drive and/or turn, or ultimately reveal additional damaged components (But hopefully none).    Good luck.|`|FjgLglhoaa	http://autorepair.about.com/                                                                                                                                                                          http://www.hunter.com/pub/undercar/4187T...|`|jg5yg2ojaa	i really do not know where you get your repairs but when you get everything done get like 1 new tire or 2 new tires at town fair and get 4 wheel alignment for like 10 bucks. But I don't know how much it is alone|`|hlve6Engaa	i think $94/hr seems high. my mechanic is around $60 but i guess it depend where u live. see if u can find some good used parts on Ebay then take them to a mechanic.|`|JPi9Ffgoaa	Well i think this is an urgent problem because control of your car is very important epically on the highway  you could cause a serious crash and have to pay even more.  well i don't know how to fix it but i know that when it comes to alinement's and stabilizing you better leave it for the pros because you could do something wrong and damage some thing else.  i know 700+ is a lot but i think instead of doing it your self and keep    messing up the alignment it get annoying i would suggest get it over with at the mechanic.   P.S: mechanic said 2 hours so i would stay there with him because he could just slack off and waste time and make you pay extra for  more time.    and for the rim yeah i think it would be a lot better to go to a scrap yard and dig one out because it a lot cheaper.    but hey if you think your up to doing it your self no problem and i am sure the ones online are just as good as the one the mechanic spit out.and i think you can Google some instructions.    Hope this helps!
gEw83TRTaa	Fora  change, those values are not far off.      Manheim Auctions is a dealer-only auction.  They are the place many trades wind up.  A used car dealer has to buy a car at, or just under MMR (Manheim Market Report) for it to make sense.      According to MMR - a 2006 Mazda 3 has an average auction price of 10,155.  I assume most of the cars are better equipped than your base model though.  I adjust that down about $500 for the extras to get a projected MMR of approx 9600.00.  So a dealer would want to buy that car for no more than about 9200 to be on the safe side and allow for in-house reconditioning.    So - $9000 is not far off.|`|WKcC0Qayaa	optimistic - the market is still falling faster than they can update their sites.  The issue is that the car dealers do not have money, and thus can do have the money to take trades without being able to sell them quickly.    At best, the dealer will be able to give you 10% to 20% less than the most recent wholesale auction price.    Why not keep the car - a Mazda 3 is a good car?
cECMUYcGaa	DO NOT TAKE IT TO AN AUTO SHOP    I recently replaced mine and it was a very easy job. The only tough part is getting the ball joint to come out of the sway bar, but if you heat the seal and the metal for a few minutes (not the sway bar itself) and put some WD-40 (this will burn a little with the heat) and then use a punch (I have an air punch) or really anything else you might have to get it out. Auto shops are for people who don't know a thing about car maintenance. An easy job like this can be done simply for the cost of the sway bar links alone (I got mine at NAPA for like $70 which is a lot cheaper then what a shop would charge) and it'll take you less than an 45 minutes rather then driving it all the way to a shop and then waiting to have it repaired.    If your into wheeling, I recommend these: http://www.quadratec.com/products/16160_...    They are work great and are worth the money so you won't break them again. Just disconnect them before you go out and reconnect them when you get back.|`|7HDWtqhOaa	Parts and labor about 200 to 275, But I would step up and get some quick disconnect links, tougher, stronger and a better idea if you go 4x4ing, will give you better axle articulation|`|55a7c9ee13be4af0516d03c798a92a60aa	call any parts store might even look it up on a few   should be able to do it yourself might be able to find how to info just by typing how to replace Stabilizer bushing 1997 Jeep Wrangler  guessing this migh tbe what you need to do but wouldnt swear to it but really not any hard to replace than remove if you know what is bad was hard part|`|1e4aad18d6b4953e1bd3bf2f36bf4928aa	it wont be cheap. its about 75 an hour and they will charge you about 3 hours.

If it has sat unused for many years than the lubricants have not been circulating and you could have bad bearings, water pump, corrosion in the cooling system, etc.  I've found that if you compare a low mileage car like that to one with 150,000 miles that has been driven and maintained regularly then the higher mileage but frequently used car will be the more dependable version.  I usually look up prices at www.kbb.com and use private party values...I try to buy vehicles under those values.

faa35ec1fb8fad57ed3c419553576dcdaa	I like the last two answers.... Especially the part about majoring in something else... Pilots are very likely to endure a furlough lasting 12 to 48 months in the airline industry... Furlough.... fancy word for layoff.    I know a pilot at American, who holds an ATP (pilot rating) and an A&P (mechanic rating). He was furloughed a while back and was able to shift over to a mechanic position at another airline (UPS in fact) and once he was called back up by American, he continued his career as a pilot. Furloughs are nasty for pilots, but being prepared for it makes a huge difference. I know another pilot that has his own cabinet company and installation crew..  This business provides that emergency residual income that is needed to endure a furlough. Although, currently, your secondary business needs to focus on something well outside of anything in the home-building business as that could go south on you in a heartbeat.|`|32dffe7e0eba9eb2c4e6c9418ec99ba5aa	None.  Pilot training is self-contained, and provides everything you need to know to pilot an aircraft.    If you have some knowledge of science, that helps.  A bit of math helps, too.  But you don't have to have any specific training in high school or college to prepare yourself for pilot training.    If you plan to fly commercially, a college degree looks good on a resume, especially a technical degree.  But this is for getting jobs, not learning to fly.    EDIT: Prometheus makes a good point that I overlooked.  Since any college degree will look good on a resume, you might want to study something other than aviation in college, just in case the pilot job doesn't pan out. I think that's actually more important than worrying about which technical subject would support a piloting career, for reasons already stated.|`|1JwBoU7Haa	Be good in math. You could join the US Air Force and let them pay for your college while serving for a couple of years. Study engineering specially aeronautical engineering.

78e4081014f25f2f27e0302c168080c5aa	Taking out the MAF sensor and cleaning it is always an easy first attempt.  I guess nobody thinks a fuel pressure test is warranted here, considering the fuel pump is electric and known to fail causing all the problems you speak of?  Oh well, I guess that's why I have been doing this for 20 years.  If under a load and the fuel pressure does not stay at a constant rate, preferably above 35 psi, then the fuel pump may not be providing enough pressure, causing the problems you describe.|`|Dvf3cPshaa	First thing I would check is the mass air flow sensor.  take it out and look at the wire running through the middle see if it is covered in small black gunk.  spray it off with brake cleaner really good and see if it runs any better.  After that I would just check your basics, fuel pressure, fuel filter, plugged exhaust etc.|`|RjHNxn8zaa	Is the "Check Engine" light on?  If so, pulling the codes from the engine management computer might help point to the problem.  A gummy Mass Airflow Sensor is a good guess, but I would use Carb cleaner, not Brake cleaner to clean off junk.  If the sensor is working properly, the "burn off" process should prevent gunk from building up - unless you have an over-oiled K&N air filter which can cause problems.  Other possibilities are a failed cam sensor, failed crank sensor, weak oxygen sensor - but any of these things should turn on the Check Engine light to point to the problem.  Places like Auto Zone can pull the codes, or you can buy a tool for about $30 that will show you the codes by flashing the Check Engine light (and will have a guide that tells you what the codes mean).    Bad spark plugs, spark plug wires or ignition coil pack could also be the problem, but the plugs and wires would have been replaced at the 60K, 120K, or 180K scheduled maintenance.  How many miles do you have on the car?  Have you performed the recommended maintenance work?

The shabbiest examples will still be a few thousand pounds, surely?        Automatics are never as good as a manual is on fuel, you have to compromise what you want with what you can afford.  Insurance is going to be very high for you.  I would recommend, if you can afford it, "the best built used car on the planet", in the words of Top-Gear...        The Mercedes-Benz 190E.  You could get yourself a 1.8 auto for under 1,000pounds.  A later model may have ABS (anti-lock brakes) and an airbag for the driver, at least.  These cars are safe, fast enough, reliable through and through and economical enough to live with.  Even with my back-problem, I can drive for a few hours and get out feeling refreshed, and sad that the enjoyable drive is over!   I have a 2-litre automatic, my third one, and will only ever think of parting with it for another one!  Mileages are not a problem on these cars, examples on eBay are often nudging the 300,000 figure.

Your search results are in the New England area, where there is a lot of snow and ice, and these cars do not handle well in either of them. And, looking at them, the mileage of all of them seems to be higher than the US Yearly average, so there is a price hit for that as well.    The results on the page are all V6 models, which are pretty anemic in power for such a heavy car. Don't expect to go drag racing in any of these, as you will be lucky to get out of your own way.    Finally, all of the results are from dealers, who are having a hellof a time getting cars out the door right now, so selling a Charger for so little can only help in getting a much needed sale.

6tkIHLlkaa	If you want speed you should go for an aprilia rs50. It will do 65mph and is the fastest 50cc production bike. Do not listen to these idiots that say their bike goes 70mph because bike speedo's are generally aound 8mph out. Even the digital ones are around 5mph out. There  are 125cc that cannot do 70mph.  Just stay away from chinese bikes!!!|`|93B7kwr3aa	Get one. I have a 76 Puch maxi s, it goes around 25-30mph.

Check on Craigslist or Ebay, you could probably get one for pretty cheap if you're willing to do some work. My moped is a hell of a lot of fun and I highly recommend a Puch if you can come across one reasonably priced.|`|7ERpxpFnaa	I don't have advice on which bike to buy - but avoid ones that you've never heard of. I have a friend who bought a brand new bike on ebay for a little under 600 from Japan or somewhere, 'guarenteed' legal in the uk - but there was no paperwork for it and it cost her 100's to get it on the road.  Stick to a brand you have heard of, and if buying on ebay a seller who has plenty of positive feedback.      RE the Law: If you are over 16 in the UK you can ride a 50cc moped.  You need a CBT ( a course costs around 100, renewable every couple of years unless you pass a full test), tax (very small, it was 15 when i last rode!) and the all important insurance (depends on you, the bike etc) and finally L plates (untill you pass that full test!).      I had a Honda C70 when i was 18, it did about 45 to 50mph which was plenty for a little ped! some are faster than others tho, and some are slower.  Mopeds take some getting used to at first, can get a bit hairy because I found on a moped you get treated like a bicycle (ignored and pushed to the side of the road) unless you hold your position in the centre of the lane (improved when I upgraded to a 125 that looked a bit meatier and could compete with the speed of the traffic.  You can get a honda C50, my hubby had one, they were good bikes when we had them! Have a look around on bike trader, ebay, etc you should find yourself a decent deal.

Treat it is gently, and it might last for several years.  Let the kids ride it and it will be broken shortly and possible forever.

AA11435704	Each state has their own rules for emergency equipment on vehicles. That being said, in an emergency situation, where you are using the lights (no need for the siren if the vehicle is stopped) to protect lives and property, no police officer is going to have a problem.

I assume since you are driving that equipped car that you are a trained emergency responder. That said, emergency certified individual in legal emergency equipped vehicle = emergency responder who duties include response and rescue in all forms of emergency situations.   No Police Officer in his or her right mind would cite you for controlling and securing an accident scene.
3qGdN6xMaa	Ethanol is more of a problem for a vehicle that is driven occasionally, like motocross bike or ATV that you put on a trailer and take to a recreation park, and leave them parked for the winter.    It is not about the size of the engine, it is about the amount of time you leave it sitting in between using it.  You'd have the same problem with dune buggies, sand rails and ski boats.    Pump gas may contain up to 5% ethanol, there may be a small warning on the side of the pump but not big so you notice it, take a look around for it on the pump.|`|Ro2ObPXlaa	I think ethanol has been added for a few years now.  Probably steadily on the rise over the last decade.  Ethanol burns cleaner, it's all about the green movement, that's why it is there.    Well, the ethanol will actually help rust form.  The alcohol evaporates and leaves water behind.  Just keep the oil fresh and clean, there's really nothing you can do about it unless you can get non-ethanol gas.  There may be some additives that could help you.  Check your WalMart or auto parts store.  Good luck.|`|a3838c0cd2f7f63124657ac7f4657dfbaa	It also depends on how old the engine is.

Also, the rubber seals on the in tank fuel pumps on many cars are not designed for ethanol and they are failing.

fbxqLErlaa	First please refer to this class of motorcycles as sport bikes.  Crotch rocket is just slang.  Despite your dirt bike experience, a 600cc sport bike is not good for a beginning street rider.  Please refer to article below.  Staying upright on a street motorcycle requires skill and experience.  Because we do not always enjoy perfect road conditions so a riders need to recognize the change in conditions and adjust accordingly.   Sign up for a Motorcycle Safety Foundation rider course.  After you get some road experience, sign up for an advanced rider's course like the Total Control Advanced Rider training course.  Have you ever dropped your dirt bike?  Sort of required when you are dirt riding.  If you have never slid out while dirt riding, you will really need the rider's training schools.  Again stay away from 600cc sport bikes.  Bad machines for the beginner.  I will offer this one tip.  Look thru the corner.  As you approach a corner, you should have the bike set up before you enter the corner.  As you enter the turn. turn your head in the direction of the turn.  Look at the rider on the silver motorcycle on the home page of the Total Control web site.  See how his head is turned relative to the direction of the motorcycle?  That is how you need to corner a motorcycle, be it in the dirt or on the road.   Good Luck|`|VkXv4RInaa	If you take a riders safety course, they will teach you how to corner correctly and it will become very simple.    If you don't want to take the course, I highly recommend going to a big open parking lot and practicing for about an hour. Also, remember to take it very easy on your bike if the tires are cold... let them warm up before you get too aggressive with cornering.    Set up a cone or just use lines painted in a parking lot and try some basic manuevers -     If you are going slow around a corner, you have to shift your weight to the opposite side to keep your bike from falling over. remember to use your clutch to keep your engine from stalling in 1st gear if you are going VERY slow around a U-Turn type corner.    If you are going fast around a corner, you need to learn to countersteer. Don't think about it too much because it doesn't make sense to the average person, just get used to the fact that you have to lightly push the steering wheel in the opposite direction you want to turn. The only thing this does is cause the bike to tilt which allows you to turn in the right direction. You cannot turn a bike without leaning it.    Have fun|`|lM9NvSwnaa	The only way the bike is gonna fall on you in a corner (unless you come to an abrupt stop) is if you slide out.  Loose debris at the apex of the turn is what you need to watch for.  I highly recommend taking the nearest MSF course.  It will teach you how to ride the bike and how to steer and counter steer.    Until you know exactly how you and your new bike will respond, follow the safety tips of 1)slow, 2) look thru 3) lean.  Once you develop confidence in your performance on the bike and how it handles then cornering will be natural.  i have had a number of bikes over 40 years of riding.  Each one handled different than the last one.  Each bike required I take it easy for the first week or so and truly get to know it.|`|51d9e39c71aaaed7424c9ac49e9069c5aa	First and foremost - simply slow down a bit.   Be on the look out for loose gravel or sand, leaves or other debris in the road and so forth.|`|yaq7oaH6aa	Do your required braking and any downshifting,   before you enter the corner. (Plan ahead).  Then gently accellerate through it.  Most novice 'crotch rocket' single vehicle incidents in corners   are 'low sides' caused by breaking traction with too much throttle   braking in the corner, or poor shifting.|`|jYy6dDAZaa	Ur bike will seldom fall over at any reasonable speed, centrifugal force works with u.  and in city traffic u will seldom get more than 10-12 degrees off vertical, not the 45 degrees senn on racers at 160MPH on a corner with a 1/4 mile radius.  U start slow and get faster really quick.      And remember that u can put ur foot down as a slider.|`|hSCcrSdbaa	Above about 10 mph it is just a matter of using counter steering, push (lightly) on the right handle bar and the bike turns right, same thing for the left bar/turns.  You've already done this on your dirt bike.  For slow speeds it is more about balance.  Begin making slow turns with your feet off the pegs to catch yourself before you fall.  After a while you will develop the skill you need to maneuver at low speeds without having to put your feet out except when stopped.|`|qJTGzKrZaa	Amazing how this sort of questions generates answers.  The blind leading the blind, that's Yahoo for ya.    Take a Motorcycle Safety Course or stay off my roadway.|`|TSAl7ZX1aa	Just to start with Suzuki don't make a GSX-R650 there is a 600 and a 750, neither are beginner bikes. If you are nervous about cornering you shouldn't be considering a bike with 100 bhp available at the rear wheel, even with the daft 3-way mode switch.    However, taking corners.  1 slowing  having observed the approach of the corner calculate the speed you can go through the corner, to reach that speed you should need to slow down, using the front brake and/or changing gear. As a beginner you will need to do this before you get close to leaning in.    2 positioning  approach the corner, for a righthand corner position yourself to the left of the carriageway  this gives you the best visibility through the corner. Vice versa for lefthanders.    3 lean into the corner  countersteering is the name of the next action, what this means is to turn right the righthand bar needs to be gently pushed forwards, this will provoke the lean, your body should lean off the bike to the right (this is counter to the position you adopt on a dirt bike where a lot of the body position is from the hips), the throttle should be trailing (not shut off) any adjustment of your throttle here will alter your line through the corner. Keep looking through the corner to the exit.    4 exit the corner  as you leave the corner you will need to straighten up this is a combination of actions, the revs are increased, the body position returns to the straightline position and the outside bar is gently pushed away from you.    All of this is a lot to take in (and difficult to understand by reading it) and you can really only understand by riding a bike and learning and thinking about each element and the best route to this is to take a recognised training course.|`|26c154b69baa8aa4faf85a634112c1aeaa	its a bandit 650 ( basic name ) i think or maybe the sv650 ??    always look where your going not at the curb or you will hit it    gsxr's are 600 750 1000cc

Yq2CUhtYaa	And at what point did you decide to believe him, and want to buy his car with no proof that it's even his?    Nevermind that if it's his car, why do YOU have to track down the title?    No, you don't get plates, reg, or anything else. There's no way to prove it's his, and thus, no way to prove it's now yours.    You can't go in the DMV and request the title, because it wasn't in your name. Only the original owner can request a duplicate title.    Tell him to get the title. If he says he can't, or just refuses, walk away, it's a sham.|`|j5kj3Bxtaa	Are you serious? Please tell me you didn't buy that car. First of all the car could be STOLEN!

If this is your Grandma's car, and she gifted it to you when she went to the retirement home, and she visits occasionally to see what you are doing to mod her car, don't do anything that will give her a major heart attack.  Grandma wouldn't like if you lower it, put ground effects skirts and 20 inch wheels and tint the windows and replace the trunk with a huge base tube reservoir.|`|AA10056605	I agree with tinting the windows and getting new rims.    New low profile tires might work as well.    But the biggest thing to do is look into the following:    New paint job that reflects who you are (color, maybe some airbrushing)  turbocharging or supercharging, which will make the car faster  new suspension, to make it handle better  replace the interior with parts that you think make the car more you  see what Toyota's TRD group offers for the Camry    Once you make these changes, you should like your Camry more. Be prepared to spend a small fortune for all of that though.    Otherwise, sell it and get something you like more.

In some things, it won't hurt, but it will cause reduced performance, such as a Sea-Doo RXP. But, if the book clearly states 91 or higher, they you should take it the gas out. This is just to be safe. In reality, it probably won't do any longterm damage from one tank of it, but it is better to be on the safe side.|`|5BJWwXJNaa	How is it running?

Just don't try to accelerate hard.  That will cause detonation in the combustion chambers.  Detonation is the air/fuel mixture exploding instead of burning.  You will hear it as the sound of ball bearing rattling around in the engine.  91 octane burns slower and is less prone to detonation.    If it was my bike, I would run out about 2 gallons then fill up with 91 octane.  2 more gallons and a fill up.  If you want to drain out the fuel, it should be easy on your bike.  Take a look at article below for the definition of detonation.     Good Luck.|`|mAZi1eH7aa	You will not even notice the difference. It is 4 points in octane. That is not enough to even notice. If it was 100 and you put in 80 the difference would be noticed. You and your engine will not notice a difference and it will not hurt the engine in any way. You need a vast difference in points to notice a difference, even then it is only in performance. It will not hurt the motor at all.|`|WxqeMSw7aa	Just go get a decent fuel additive which will boost the octane level in your tank.  At least you didn't fill up a diesel with gasoline like I did to my wifes car on her birthday after a relaxing day at the local spa !! Not recommended,. especially on a bank holiday !    Cost me the best part of 300 to get it fixed !

The 2 seaters are better.|`|pv9v44YLaa	The 2+2 seats are barely adequate for children, and the 2+2 is a bit heavier than the 2 seater, making it a tad slower, though it does have a longer wheelbase, so rides a bit better.    Personally, I always found the looks of the 2+2 to be a bit out of proportion to my eyes - I much preferred the 2 seater.    Also, as others have mentioned, the 2+2 Twin Turbo was never imported to the U.S. and if you wanted Turbocharging, you would have to d oa TT engine/front clip swap.
zj91sSsuaa	Clean the spark plug and the magneto coil.|`|lM9NvSwnaa	Engines need 3 things to work-1)fuel mix in the proper amount, 2) spark at the plug and 3) compression.  If you have the proper mix getting to the cylinder at the proper time with compression in the engine and spark at the plug at the right time then it starts.    If not, you need to look to 1)spark plug-is it clean and dry?  A wet plug indicates either too much fuel or oil is getting past something in the engine that it should not be (depends on color of wetness).  2) Spark-it should be a fat blue spark.  If not then you need to look at the coil(s), and lastly compression.    If you try starting with the choke on-pull the chord a couple of times and if it does not start, then flip the choke off and try a few more times.  It is possible you are getting too much fuel to the plug (from having the choke on and then pull, pull, pulling time after time).  it is also possible that you are not pulling hard enough-even though you are using all your might, to spin the engine quick enough.

TnDGopiwaa	"If the starter motor spins but fails to engage the flywheel, the cause may be a weak solenoid, defective starter drive or broken teeth on the flywheel.

Either the Abendix is shot or the flexplate(flywheel) has a dead spot in it. The abendix what actually drives the motor when you place the key into the start position. When the starter motor engages it 'spins' a smaller gear(abendix) which meshes with the flexplate and spins the motor.     Everytime you shutoff your motor it has 3 positions it will come to rest in everytime. Therefore these 3 places, depending on where it comes to rest, are where the starter engages everytime thus wearing in these postions more than the rest of the flexplate.|`|AA11458886	listen to LAURA...she answered you question correctly...most of those other people don't have a clue....|`|zOIgzIy4aa	sounds like the bendix is bad in the starter.|`|k55p1pKraa	Your starter is pulling up to highand missing the flywheel teeth, you need to go to the auto parts store and pick up so starter SHIMS, you will need to put them on the side of the starter close to the flywheel , that way it will let that end of the starter down so the starter will lin up with the flywheel teeth.
Dvf3cPshaa	If you jump the starter and it just spins.  You probably are not jumping the right terminal.  Put power to the smaller wire on the starter that should throw out the gear into your flywheel.  Have someone try to crank it and check for power at the signal wire on the starter.  If you have power at the signal wire.  Check power at the bigger wire while you are trying to crank.  possible bad battery connection.  If the starter engages and turns but the engine does not crank you probably have a bad starter or missing teeth on the flywheel.|`|q8vILEpfaa	I'm in with Grampa Alex but would add it could also be the Bendix that is bad.

v8TWvtQgaa	listen loner rods has NOTHING to do with a stroker or CID of engine.     A 383 stroker is a .030" over 350 with a 400 crank.     In the old days you would use 400's short rods, .030" 350 pistons and have a 400's crank turned down to fit the 350's mains     Step foward 30 years to today and now we have ready made 383 stroker parts.     You buy a 383 stroker crank which has the 3.75" stroke and the 2.45" 350's mains     Then you buy pistoms made for a 350 block with a 3.75" stroke     And you can use std 5.7" 350 rods     Now the things to watch for.. the 350 is internal balanced.. Most 383 cranks and all 400 cranks are external balance.  So you will need a damper and flexplate/flywheel for external balance.     You will need to take crank, rods, pistons, etc to machine shop and have them balanced.     Std. GM 5.7" rods will hit the cam lobes on most performance cams, so you can grind the rod bolt shoulders down or buy stroker clearanced rods from like Scat.     Or you could go with a small base circle cam to fix the clearance probs but IMHO thats just a rushed way of building a 383.     The block also needs to be cleranced. The rods and crank counter weights will hit the bottom of the cyl bores and maybe the oil pan rails, so you need to carfully grind just enough metal away from the spots it hits to clear.|`|dQrBlk4qaa	Sounds like everybody here's got a little bit of the whole answer!     Rather than go "old-school junkyard", nowadays its much better to get a stroker kit. Summit sells a complete kit including solid name-brand gaskets/bearings/pistons/rods/crank and oil pump for about a grand, plus change. You'll need to spend another two hundred or so to have a shop balance the assembly. All you need is a prepped 030 over 350 block. Remember that the machining necessary to clean up/condition the block will likely include some minor clearancing to clear the counterweights and such.   You'll also need an externally balanced flywheel/balancer combination, since your 350 stuff is for an internally balanced engine. You can spend the extra money to get an internally balanced kit, but budget-wise it's probably cheaper to go with the external stuff.     Also, you will need a small base-circle cam to clear the extra rod movement - keep that in mind!|`|YmLcF2rSaa	Longer rods,machine cuts for piston skirts and bore|`|WKcC0Qayaa	and a stroker crank.

New parts don't usually raise value much unfortunately.

I drive a 32 foot long school bus and we have to know the exact position of our vehicles on the road 100% of the time.|`|31Ttgqlbaa	This sounds like a narrow street. I guess you can drive in the middle if you can see that there are no cars coming form the other direction, and move over when a car comes to allow room for it to pass. In my opinion , to me there's always more room than I think, like when parallel parking one time, it looked like I was close to the curb, but actually I had several feet of space. When driving I seem to be close to the yellow line because I don't want to get too close to the right side and go off the road, but actually there's plenty of room. I drive a small car and starting driving more away from the yellow line and do find.     You can use your right side mirror and if you see the parked cars in your mirror as you drive by them, your're fine. If you don't see them in your mirror, then you're too far away.|`|ONZ4QhDIaa	watch the road and look in your mirrors DUH|`|79c8ae67c46c5115144cf09d72566a64aa	I try to watch the sides of my bumper your dad might think your going to hit the car next to you so he tells you to move over same thing happened a while ago when I was riding with my mom.  Just do your best to get through without hitting anything but if your dad says move over do it.
qnZyIkODaa	Yes, it would sound louder.|`|KbBWLMTgaa	yes it will be alot loude rit also depends on who makes it and what type of metal its made of as to what tone will come out but most results no matter what are a louder tone.
iZcFPeviaa	try this http://www.powercallsirens.com/fordradio... hope that helps or you can go to ford dealership
cQqc1Qicaa	Use DexronIII/Mercon fluid.  I doubt that the stop-leak will work.  If the fuid is leaking at the point where the trans meets the engine, you're probably looking at a front pump seal (very expensive to replace), but it could also be an axle seal, the pan gasket or the cooler hoses, which are not so bad.  Get it looked at.|`|zOIgzIy4aa	get the dextron 3 / mercon transmission fluid. it works in ford and GM.|`|WKcC0Qayaa	read your owner's manual    get a pro to look at it - a leak can be a sign of a major problem, or a very minor issue.    take it to a pro (not jiffy lube or similar) have the transmission fluid and filter changed, and have them fix the leak.    stop leak stuff is temporary - a few weeks at most, and can cause other very expensive damage.
ojxfzv7Faa	No, it's a car for people that don't care how terrible it is.    They are not good cars.    They have poor performance for a sports car, they're small, they're unreliable, they have very expensive parts from the old R170 Mercedes-Benz SLK-Class roadster and they were very overpriced.    That's why they discontinued making them.|`|addaf7237cf3d32190cfc96546e98709aa	Sports car for old people?  No    The Chrysler Crossfire competes with the Audi TT and Nissan 350z.

But it is a cool car to have.|`|fe73dc32e71ef5846abbf8e72834c313aa	If you can afford it go for it, they not just for 'older' people, it is a roadster after all. As for it's reliability I don't have any thing bad to say about the car, they haven't been around too long. If it's what you're looking for then go for it.|`|ye6Buzneaa	buy it...trust me buy it.    Its super sexy and super sleek. Get it. Your lucky you can afford one. If any of ur buddies calls it an old people car, just laugh and point at their Accords.
TdrgZwnoaa	They will probably just auction off the assets of the company or sell it complete to a competitor.<br>  <br>   Who gives a royal flying fig anyway? I am done with GMC and their shoddy cars and customer service. I have a GM car sitting in my driveway that no one in the family will drive now because of outstanding warranty/safety issues. And the car just lapsed out of warranty without the initial problem being attended to. A design problem, I might add, that has been ongoing since we purchased the vehicle brand new.<br>  <br>   Fork 'em. Somebody will step in to take their place anyway.<br>  <br>   As for me. My next vehicle is going to come from a manufacturer that stands behind their product. Does anybody know of one?|`|f5ibT3WNaa	They're not going under.|`|EWGDIq5baa	I would imagine they would sell off everything but beware of this because you would most likely end up with a car with no warranty.  They also might get bought out if they file bankruptcy which is what most companies do.  If this happens they might keep the GM brand names which would be the best deal for consumers.|`|XFHleRhWaa	Very good question, with the 9.6 billion loss just posted! they will go for a reorganization bankruptcy. Sell off the debts, reorganize, and only offer profitable models. POOR retired employees, their benefits will be one of the first to go.

S1UEMIuZaa	sounds like he stole your air intake off your tahoe. and yes even if it is fuel injected it has to have a air breather. his plans were for alot of dirt to get in ur engine and it lock up. id take it to another mechanic and tell him to go all through it. check everything. then take pics and press charges on that worthless peice of ****.hahahaha|`|XFHleRhWaa	It sounds like when the did the oil change the did not stick your dip stick back in, They took it out to check the level and never took it out. Not talking about Wally World but they do hire kids, and people with no experience. They hired my brother-in-law and put him in the AUTO department. He Had two degrees and could not change a tire or air filter. I'd go back and ask for the store manager. TELL HIM to make it right.|`|gwVnvKXRaa	That's what happens when you take things to WALMART!!!!!  I hate that place with a passion, There are so many different and cheaper places to take your car other than a dealer, but a lot of times you can get just as good of a deal on an oil change from the dealer as you can a Pennzoil or Valvoline oil change shop.  You just have to deal with the inconvenience of the dealer vs. being able to shop while you wait, but for a more trustworthy job on your vehicle I think it would be totally worth it.|`|e3mpxIjcaa	This doesnt have anything to do with your problem , but speakin of Walmart, I went in to get a battery for my lawn mower,found the battery no problem went to pay at the auto desk,they had some old f****n lady behind the counter had no idea what she was doin.Took me about a half hour to ring up my battery.After two managers came to help her,then I went to pay with my C.C. and she couldnt figure out how to push the credit key.Ended up goin to the front desk to check out. Just pissed me off!!
qsozRiDGaa	Hi, I own a 1991 Harley FXR with 159,000 miles. My Harley is my world and I love her.  She's getting a little tired but hopefully soon I'll be able to add another Harley to the stable. I ride with a passenger sometimes but mostly ride one up.  Living in the Chicago Illinois area, my riding time is limited.  Been out west and out east but not south.  I hope you love your Harley as much as I do.  I try to ride every day to work. My Harley is running great even after all those miles.  I do love the sound of the motor but I prefer the music out of the Supertrapp two into one exhaust.  Keep riding as long as you can.  Life is too short.  They say that four wheels move bodies and two wheels move souls.  Keep the shiny side up.|`|lgNfXk9Qaa	Have owned several Harleys. Now have 08 StreetGlide.

It is like learn how to park people :)|`|Qa0s3HAeaa	That's a good idea! "Hey, I parked my car far into the lot, will you walk me out?" I will so use that! Yeah! It's really annoying.

If only people were considerate.....|`|0405893528ec8866808fd4b76dad4bd1aa	yes!!!!!!!!  i have a story to tell.  there was 2 parking spots next to eachother.  once i was waiting for someone to leave one of the parking spots, so i could park there, and there was someone across from me to. the lady across from me right away zoomed into the parking spot, right in the middle of both of the 2 spots!! i was like are you kidding me? so i had to drive around for 20 minutes to find a parking spot, since it was so crowded being the day after christmas.|`|jNzkN6Rnaa	YES!!|`|1QpigqCNaa	omggg yess that f.ing pisses me off its like really you can just mooooovvvvvvvvvvveeeeee|`|D3agflP1aa	hahah i totally agree my dad  gets so mad when someones car is badly parked|`|R0NfdgzLaa	yeah, i almost have mild OCD when it comes to that...  i always park parallel and in the centre of the parking space.  i used to be a professional driver and for some reason i view my driving as a reflection on myself... i only ever cut corners or cross unbroken lines when there's nobody within sight in any direction, otherwise i feel the need to do it properly.|`|S2FhDtfSaa	I have been known to retaliate by simply stepping on a tire's valve stem.

When you see those huge SUV's parked in the tiny spots. It really bugs me. What bugs me worse, is that I work at a car dealership and in the back of the lot we have a row of parking for the employees.

I'm from Massachusetts!|`|pofFe2HEaa	Yes, and worse than that i get so p'd off when a tiny car or motor cycle is parked and i think i see a spot for me to get into but really its a tiny car hidden behind another one and i start to whip in and have to keep going.

I get irritated too, but no big deal.|`|lT36RavYaa	Yeah, at school we have an oval of road around the high school that the students park on and people will have 2/3 of a car space on either side of them and it PISSES ME OFF! UG!|`|ojKmXu3waa	my mom gets really bad and if the driver's still in the car she stares her evil stare at them|`|vk6sczbLaa	I hate when I have to park next to a badly parked car, because it usually makes me park badly so that I can actually get out of the car. Then when the car leaves, it looks like I was the one parked badly in the first place. =/    Or when very big cars try to park in compact spaces.    I also hate parallel parkers that leave such great distances between them and the other cars. If they would park correctly, at least another car or two could park along the sidewalk as well.|`|qcLRjTPTaa	yes it really pisses me off when there parked hlf on there park and half on another|`|1mbUH5aUaa	I carry peanut butter so I can put it under the door handle of some jerk *** hole who can't park right.

I couldn't even get in side ways...I went back into the restaurant and asked them to mention the make and model of the car so they could come and move it...I'm 6 months pregnant and was not going to even to attempt to crawl over the passenger seat!!  Your right when you say people have no consideration!!|`|VDy99i3oaa	If the person is in their own space I don't care. However if they're taking up two spaces that's completely different. I mean, I've had to park badly because of the way other people park, or for other extenuating circumstances, but I'm always in my own space. It's rude that you guys would damage the other persons' car simply because they parked badly. You don't know their circumstances and you certainly wouldn't like it if they damaged your car if for some reason you one day parked badly.|`|vD3VS98oaa	YES. THOSE F*CKING IDIOTS!!!!!|`|PNkhcbMcaa	heck ya! i want to punch the  car|`|paHt6Yi8aa	yeah, i do get quite irritated at badly parked cars, only, however, if it pertrudes other peoples parking spots, even if they're already taken. my mom parks sometimes off cener, but we're either on the very outside of the lot, or it is a really not busy day. but yes it does irritate me|`|nczfUTsGaa	Yes i do, especially when part of the car takes up another space then i think to myself wow this guy or girl is retarded. I never thought about picking up ppl like that though thats a good one.
kgk3Yz9Naa	well your sort of right,but different designed engines wont sound the same...i know the early mk1 1980 ford fiesta sounds the same as the 1999 ford fiesta as they had the same type of engine fitted,it may be an updated spi with pulse ignition,but other than that there the same engine for over 20 years.|`|tI7QP3dkaa	I have noticed that a lot of cars sound the same ie all mitsubishi vehicles have the same sound when they start.  I have had three and can pick one starting in car park without even having to lift my head to see what type of car it is.      I have an Renault too and have driven others and they too sound the same.       I think it might be a manufacturers way of putting their signature on the car..|`|uLLHFiT3aa	They don't sound the same. There's so many different engines OHV,SOHC,DOHC, inline 4, V6 , 2 valves per cylinder, 4 valves per cylinder etc... Some cars have cheap replacement mufflers that are noisy while others have added a performance exhaust with a raspier sound. Maybe your local muffler man is using the same crappy el cheapo mufflers on the cars in your neck of the woods.
QM0Ezfvnaa	You are describing a fuel problem . . . either the fuel filter or the fuel pump or water the tank.     Filters should be replaced with some regularity as we are getting some trashy fuel as we hunt for best gas prices.     Gas dealers have sludge/water in the bottom of the inground fuel tanks. Sometimes water/trash gets into our cars - the filters try to remove it. Change the inexpensive filter as a first move.|`|FjgLglhoaa	http://autorepair.about.com/|`|zOIgzIy4aa	it very well could be the gas filter. if it gets clogged then you be surprised what that filter can do.|`|TsJoADGPaa	I would try changing the fuel filter first. If it's very clogged, you would have problems like this. You'd notice the car struggling on hills and stuff too. They're very cheap, so it doesn't hurt to change it.|`|eESXiy7paa	don't be concerned about mixing old fuel and new fuel...rust and crap in your tank will float on the top of the fuel...if you run your tank nearly dry before refueling, some of that stuff is bound to get sucked into the fuel filter and plug it up..the fuel filter is very cheap to replace..it looks like a small canister located close to the carb..1 line in from your tank..1 line out to the carb.........this is not a definitive answer to your problem..just a good place to start|`|q8vILEpfaa	I'm leaning more toward electrical.    Distributor cap for cracks,  your plug wires may be breaking down.
lLZqNNUdaa	Legally this car still belongs to the person your parents bought it from because they did not bother to have it registered in their name.  They can not legally sell this car to you until they properly register the car in their name first. They MUST be able to convey a CLEAR title to you for this transaction to be legal, and for you to be able to register the car in your name.    There will be taxes and fees due the state which THEY must pay before they can sell the car to anyone.  Once they have legally registered the car they can "gift" it to you, and all you would pay is a modest fee for the transfer. .

This will make you more valuable to the service, train you for a skill for life that you can use after the service, and if you are in the top 3 of your class get you sent to pretty much where you pick on your dream sheet. Without a school you pretty much get sent to where they need you and you have to "strike" to get a rating. All the worst jobs go to strikers! I went to MK school right out of boot. Although I hardly new about engines I studied hard (did not spend my time partying) and came out tops in my class. I got my first pick and went to a small boat station as an MK. Later on I also qualified as a coxswain. After I got out I got my captains license and spent the next 26 years as a boat operator with the USNPS.

For instance, there's a light switch.  The lights are not in the switch, they're on the front of the car.  There's also a wiper switch.  The wipers are not in the switch, they're on the windshield.<br>  <br>  Cruise control is the same way.  The cruise control has a mechanical governor that is connected to the speedometer cable (not the speedometer) and that is in turn connected to the engine.  All that stuff is under the hood.<br>  <br>  The way to avoid being taken by mechanics is to leave it alone and just use the gas pedal.

ojxfzv7Faa	No, it's legal to pull a small car with all the right equipment, a tow bar or tow dolly and with a vehicle that can handle it.    Edit:     A Tow bar or Tow dolly is what you use to pull vehicles with. The tow bar is something that hooks up to the car being pulled and the vehicle pulling it. A tow dolly is very small trailer that holds two of the vehicles wheels off the road to tow the vehicle...  ...I know U-haul rents the the tow dolly kind.    You'll have do some of this work, I'm not sure I will be able to answer all the question you may have.|`|r5aokD7Yaa	local moving companies should have tow bars or dollies for rent (Uhaul)    in order to tow a car, you need to know what the tow rating for the vehicle which is performing the towing would be    most minivans are not rated to tow items as heavy as cars    frequently, rental trucks (like Budget, Uhaul, etc) can be rented along with a tow dolly to move a car along with furniture    best luck!

You also have to factor in rear end ratios as well as manual or torqueflite transmissions.  An example of a 1970 Challenger equipped with a 440 6pack with a rear end of 3.23 and a 3 spd torqueflite came in at 104.28 mph and 13.62 seconds in the quarter mile.

3MTYGEbWaa	It's not quite that simple. Leasing is a form of financing, not renting. When you signed a 3 or 4 year contract, they agreed to low payments that are only good if you complete the lease on the original schedule. If you end the lease early (this is all in your contract) you essentially void the contract and you give them the right to RECALCULATE your lease balance in a way that is NOT in your favor. You'll owe much more that you might have thought. If a dealer says he can "help" you avoid these costs, he's pulling your leg.     You could consider a lease transfer, if your lease company allows it. Someone takes over your car and your lease for the remainder of the lease term. Here's more about it:  http://www.leaseguide.com/Articles/lease...    .|`|TnDGopiwaa	I believe you can, but they may charge you to get out of that lease.

6DQ8LzxFaa	Pyle is a pile. Junk brand. Here is a list i keep handy. Some people disagree with some of it, some people like it. It is based on personal experience and opinions of people I know that are highly regarded in car audio.       Good brands, including but not limited to: Alpine, Rockford Fosgate (except subs), Kicker, JL Audio (too expensive), Soundstream, ARC Audio, Cadence, Diamond Audio, Focal, Dayton (subs), older Precision Power, some MTX, RE audio, US Amps, Fi car audio, Sundown Audio, Hertz, MB Quart, Zapco, JBL, Ascendent audio, DC sound labs, Digital Designs, Pioneer Premier; old school brands: Lanzar, Hifonics, Orion, and Phoenix Gold.    Mediocre brands (brands that are good for the money, but there is better): Quantum Audio, Sony ES line, Memphis (I have heard of lot's of problems with their amps), Dual (if I was broke), Infinity (in my opinion), Pioneer, Kenwood (in my opinion; if I was broke).     Junk brands, including, but not limited to: Blaupunkt (except old school stuff), Pyramid, Boss, Profile, Lanzar (except old school Lanzars), HiFonics (again except old school, series VIII and earlier), Legacy, American Pro, Rampage, MA Audio, Alphasonik, Crunch, Lightning Audio, Visionik, Audiovox, Volfenhag, Rockwood, Jensen, SPL, American Legacy, Soundstorm, Audiobahn, SPX, Sony Explod line, VR3, Pyle.

7L0zp7O6aa	That's not a bad deal if there is no shaft play.  And you need an 02 to 05 WRX to use the 565's(pinks).  If you have an 06 or newer, you have palenty of injector for a VF39 plus the pinks will not work on those.  And the crack only effects flow if it's cracked and split.  90% of VF39's have the hairline cracks so it's pretty much a given.|`|66caf963e729a83a9cb3d35243c82382aa	Check for a crack on the inside housing of the turbo, some hairline cracks are said to not lose any performance or stability but i'm not a fan of that idea.<br>  <br>  I have idea what model year you're talking about so I don't really know if the 565 is what you should be after or what your tuning objectives are but they will run properly together.  <br>  <br>  $500 would be a decent deal if the turbo isn't cracked and the wastegate hasn't been welded shut.  I would also do a flow test on the injectors to see if any of them were faulty before I went to the trouble of installing them.
v905m6jRaa	The speed your lifeboat will travel depends upon the prevailing winds and prevailing ocean currents.  These winds and currents will change throughout the year.  <br>  <br>  PILOT CHARTS are used to help mariners know the winds and currents in the oceans.  They are produced by the NGA -- National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency.  These charts are available for download.<br>  <br>  Here's the description of a PILOT CHART:<br>  <br>  "Pilot Charts depict averages in prevailing winds and currents, air and sea temperatures, wave heights, ice limits, visibility, barometric pressure, and weather conditions at different times of the year. The information used to compile these averages was obtained from oceanographic and meteorologic observations over many decades during the late 18th and 19th centuries.<br>  <br>  The Atlas of Pilot Charts set is comprised of five volumes, each covering a specific geographic region. Each volume is an atlas of twelve pilot charts, each depicting the observed conditions for a particular month of any given year. <br>  <br>  The charts are intended to aid the navigator in selecting the fastest and safest routes with regards to the expected weather and ocean conditions. The charts are not intended to be used for navigation."<br>  <br>  Note that they say you shouldn't use these for navigation -- but in a lifeboat, these are the best charts to have....|`|AA11662883	Just the same way as acient times. The term "knots" were just that, Knots tied onto a rope. After the rope was dropped into the water (with an anchor) A timer was used to count off one minute. (back then.. an hour glass) After one minute expired... they counted the knots and done the math   (speed = time + distaince)|`|7jj3lCvOaa	The last answer gives the speed over the water, which is not the same as speed over the ground. The wind affects the speed, but not the recording, so using the log as previously given you then need to calculate the tide, or current, either from a chart, or take a position at the start and at the end.Then do the maths. If you need more info start a sailing course.<br>  Or buy a GPS.

4agFELNzaa	If you want the best, come to a Canadian flight school. Ontario has more good weather than the east and west coast so finding a school in Ontario is preferable. There are college programs at schools such as Seneca or Conestoga that have you graduate with a Commercial Pilots Lisence, or Universities such as the University of Western Ontario where you can get a degree and a Commercial Pilots license. Regardless, Canada is the place to learn.

mR5ZtjqWaa	http://www.leftseat.com/FAAforms.htm      it is quite easy to get a Private Pilot's License, but as soon as you try for commercial, airline, or military, sight (actually, all health and physical) requirements jump up. Still, most of the time, you can correct your vision with glasses or contacts or laser surgery and still be allowed to fly.    here are the more precise vision requirements for each med class    1 http://flightphysical.com/part67/Class1/...  2 http://flightphysical.com/part67/Class2/...  3 http://flightphysical.com/part67/Class3/...    You need a medical certificate before flying solo in an airplane, helicopter, gyroplane, or airship.  You can get a med certificate from any FAA-authorized aviation medical examiner. There are approximately 6,000 of them in the U.S. (locate one : http://www.faa.gov/pilots/amelocator/ )|`|a8m3HdDHaa	Sure, I have a cousin who has only one eye and he has a pilots license, I don't think they would give him a job flying for Delta though.|`|AGQI3NuXaa	yeah,  you can wear glasses as a Private Pilot too|`|bhJYeBXWaa	Pretty much as long as you are correctable to 20/20 with contacts/glasses/etc. you can get your FAA Class I physical (though you may have a Statement of Demonstrated Ability, or "waiver"), which is what is required to fly for a Part 121 air carrier. I am in a similar situation and fly the 757/767 for a major airline.

fMDS4vTGaa	You need to contact the buyer immediately after the end of the auction and let them know you are the winner and that you'd like to make arrangements to finalize the purchase.    Usually sellers have their stipulations for purchase written in the details they posted on their auction page, so MAKE SURE you read everything the seller writes about the vehicle and their stipulations for how they want payment after the auction is done.    DO NOT EVER send a seller the total amount after the sale.  If a seller demands this, pass on the deal as this is how unscrupulous or fraudulent sellers commence business -- they receive the funds and you never hear from them again.    Usually the seller will ask for a deposit within a specified period and then want to meet you to close the sale.    Be ready to have to remove the vehicle at the time that you close the sale with the seller in person and be ready to be able to make the entire purchase within a matter of days.      Also be ready to consider that you've purchased a vehicle unseen and that you may be in for a world of hurt if you expect to have a drivable vehicle to take back home across country or across state.    Consider also that pictures always look better than the real live thing, so make sure that your bid reflects some wiggle room in respect to possible minor blemishes or mechanical problems the seller overlooked.    Its an auction and an auction is always buyer beware and your bid is your commitment. Also consider that most vehicle purchases on auction are considered as is as seen -- in other words, be ready to take the vehicle, even if its not as great as you thought, as long as there isn't a major discrepancy between what they said it was and what it actually is. (like its a rust-bucket when they said it had no rust or minor rust, or it doesn't run when they said it was a good runner).    As to proof of insurance, registration or whatnot, you can't insure or register something that you don't actually possess yet and as for license, you don't need that to own property.  What you do with it and how legal you are to use it after the purchase is your own business and no concern of the seller.     The transaction is the agreed amount of cash for the vehicle represented as sold, beyond that its all yours to do with as you please, how you please.      They just want the money you are committed to pay and for you to take the vehicle, period. Tow it, drive it, push it, that's your business.|`|WKcC0Qayaa	generally the seller wants cash before possession and transfer of title - the other stuff varies from state to state - check DMV website(s).    ebay is like an agent, not the buyer or seller, and basically could care less, as long as they get their fees.|`|55a7c9ee13be4af0516d03c798a92a60aa	money they wanted to sell car for be able to get to car they bid on really not a smart thing to do really to buy any used car one need to be able to check it and drive it and sorry with ebay you cant do it til after you spend the money more easy to lose money and many do better to shop close by your town or state so you dont have to drive to far to look at it but really if you bit and send money that money going into someone bank account and then you get car maybe better really know what your doing and check person out before biding

However, if the vehicle was in a huge wreck before, it nullifies the mileage debate.    On the flip side, if a vehicle has high mileage compared to the others, it may mean it's mostly highway miles, which are less damaging to the vehicle as a whole over city miles.    Here's a link to help you compare some mileage and prices though: http://www.easyautosales.com/Land-Rover/...

43DHFQnKaa	the following installations:  -cold air intake and increased throttle body (73 or 75mm)  -performance exhaust ,  catbacks  -performance headers  -re tune of engine management system with tuning chip (diablo predator for example)    ...acting together will give you an increase in hp of approx 15-18% at the crank,  and with headers much of that will get to the rear wheels,  making it noticeable improvement.    this is considered traditional modification program,  installed individually these modifications will be much less effective.    these are all bolt on installations relatively easy to add (headers are admittedly a bit of a challenge but worthwhile).  you can go to these online performance shops to get an idea of parts/costs: american muscle,  lethal performance.    -swapping rear end gears for 3.73's  is also very effective,  doesn't add power,  but makes you quicker from the get-go,  and still will not have an overly large impact on highway driving.    if you want to go further you can add forced induction (usually by way of mild boost supercharger, lots of bolt on installations available).  without enhancing internals or heads the older profile 4.6 engine can be taken up to the range of 380hp with a supercharger,  and later profile engine (post 2005) can be taken up to the range of 420hp...seriously quick.|`|BUCvr0R8aa	I have a cobra with 600 horses but it has everything on it though.

Make sure you test the gap on your plugs though.|`|AWDW78ESaa	I don't know of any website, but you can try autozone.com. They have some how-to stuff on there so that may help. I have always had good results with champion plugs. Everyone has their own preference. You will need to know the year, make and model of  your vehicle (ex. 2003 Ford Escape) and the engine size (ex. 6 cylinder, 2.4 liter). You will need a "gap guage". The clerk at the parts store can tel you what the gap should be and show you how to use it. Start of gapping all the plugs, then remove one plug wire and only one. After remove the old plug and install the new one then put the new wire on. Repeat this process for each of the cylinders making sure to remove only one wire at a time so that you don't take a chance of mixing up 2 wires and hooking the up wrong. This would cause the cylinders to fire improperly because they are timed to fire in a certain order and mixing up the wires will mess up that order and your car won't run correctly. There may be little plastic "holders" along the wires in places. If there are, make sure the new wires go into those to keep them off the hot parts of the engine. Good luck

TdrgZwnoaa	My neighbour just purchased a new SX4 and she loves it. We live in Central Canada and it gets cold (-40F) here. As a result most of our roads are covered with packed snow (ice) all winter long. This car with snow tires all round has never failed her and she has to commute 45 miles to work.|`|dQrBlk4qaa	I'm an older, more experienced driver, and I'm looking to make the SX4  my daily driver!     Its rated very well safety wise, and since you're talking Virginia, I'd say the standard front wheel drive car will serve you well. I'm considering the awd version for my new england ski jaunts, and my even more bad, sporadic NJ weather conditions!     It drives like a slot car, has room for 5 (squeezing them in a little - the back seat leg room is a little scarce). The fuel tank is a little small, which means you will be stopping more often for gas, and the mileage is a little low considering its size (but still within the realm of most other compacts). The automatic is a little buzzy and slightly sluggish for my tastes (you may not notice it, being its your first car); if you can drive a stick shift, the SX4 is a lot more fun to throw the stick around with, and you can keep the car in its powerband.    However, what's up with the lack of an available mp3 player input on the radio? Its a great sounding system, but unless they've changed it on the newest one, there's no "aux in" like on practically every other new car. Otherwise, the interior is pretty snazzy.     Hope that helps!|`|1H7aNVT3aa	Don't have first hand experience with one but the SX4 is a bit bigger and heavier than other subcompacts.  It also has slightly worse mileage.  I think it's a good car and a safe car, but you can do better.      $16,000 can buy a lot of car on the used car market nowadays.  Have you thought of a Toyota Matrix or Corolla or a Honda Civic slightly used?  That is moving significantly upscale from an SX4.    If you are looking for AWD, if you live in the mountains how about a Subaru?

6DQ8LzxFaa	You have to have an enclosure for a sub. If it is in open air, it will produce no bass. It is called cancellation, which is the front sound waves meeting the rear sound waves. There are subs made for free-air, or open air, mounting, but you have to mount them to a baffle, or piece of wood sheeting, then mount that in the trunk. That setup uses the trunk as the enclosure.   Ohms is the impedence the sub (or any speaker) presents to the amp (HU internal or an external amp). The lower the ohm (2-ohm vs 4-ohm) the more resistance, and the more power the amp produces. That is why you will see an amp rated at, say, 100 watts x 2 @ 4-ohms and 150 watts RMS x 2 @ 2-ohms.  Subwoofers play sub bass frequencies, generally 50 Hz and lower. Then woofers; midbass; midrange; and tweeters.     Pioneer has that gimmick of "super tweeters" on a 4-way. That is a marketing ploy. A good 2-way is all that is needed. A 2-way has a woofer cone and a tweeter. A 3-way has a woofer cone, a midrange driver, and a tweeter- all in one housing. 6x9 3-ways are an example.|`|51d9e39c71aaaed7424c9ac49e9069c5aa	The sound waves from the rear of a speaker are 180 degrees out of phase with the sound waves from the front and will tend to cancel each other out if simply placed in open air.  Ohms indicate the impedance or load that the speaker places on the amplifier and should be matched to the amplifier's out put terminals.  Tweeters are the very high frequency speakers used to help produce a full spectrum of sound.|`|YIbELNRBaa	wow, what are you like 16. ha. Match the ohms with whatever your using.

Sparky3489@yahoo.com - top car audio guru      _________________    How you load an amp determines the amount of power out.    There is a trade off though, the lower the impedance (ohms) the more power is pushed as well as higher distortion and more heat is generated. The excessive heat will shorten the life of the amp.    For best overall performance, it's far better to get a higher powered amp and load it with 4 ohms than a lower powered amp and force it to push more power with a lower impedance (2 or less ohms) load.|`|6PGo60uqaa	j|`|pofFe2HEaa	box helps the soundwaves to bounce within the box to create harder bass. tweeters are tiny speakers in corner of daash but there loud and improves vocal and musical quality.|`|6hqmRRzHaa	a woofer pumps up the bass and tweeters kick out the jams MAN! but no... all i know is woofers is for real bassy stuff and i assume tweeters, by their name, are the opposite. OHMS i think are just how many decibels|`|WZeUrVXFaa	the subs will give you the signature base found in a lot of rap and dance songs, the tweeters will give you the treble found in a lot of pop music, they compliment each other, it all really depends on what you listen too, and how loud you want to listen to it...|`|1c8ea5969ab46c77a9c66dea8a748209aa	So you can get a 14y.o. girlfriend easier. Nothing is more ridiculous than a car that's worth less than it's stereo & nobody thinks any bigger of those who think it makes up for a tiny penis. Two 6x9's & two 6's will provide all the noise you're ears can handle & won't weigh your car down or drain your battery.|`|fqX1pz9Naa	subwoofer box acts like a drum, if you only beat on a piece leather you won't get any sound at all but when stretched over something hollow you hear a beat. the air in the box vibrates from the subs then the box acts like a drum. OHMS are a way of measuring the strength of subwoofers, tweeters are basically for treble (higher pitched sounds in music) I may be wrong so you may want to do other research, but I tried to help|`|9Fhgt4nFaa	It's pointless, waste of money|`|nRNsfbE9aa	A box is veryy important. If you ever heard a free-air woofer before, you would understand. A box is the enclosure space that actually causes the sound of bass. ohms are the impedence of the subs, don't really know how to explain it but subs have various wiring capabilities depending on what ohm subwoofer you buy and if its single or dual voice coil. Tweeters are strictly for highs, as many speakers are used in an audio system for the mid range bass/ highs, the tweeters are used specifically for treble. The subwoofer as you probably already know is used for low range bass, the frequency range of the sub and amp determines what frequencies it will be able to play effeciently. Check out Sparkys guide though, should get you up and going.|`|TdRVzKfZaa	To woof subs.|`|yBBuE0v7aa	What is the point of having a cover on your xbox? Whats the point of having a container for peanuts?    Those may not be good examples. But subwoofers need and ENCLOSED area with no air. If subwoofers were placed alone it will damage them and it wont be any good.
H8XpaaPDaa	learn from your mistakes is the only productive way of living. if you always look back and worry about your mistakes, your just digging yourself into a deeper hole. by learning from your mistakes, you will prevent yourself from making it again.    what i do if something is bothering me, i just go to sleep! i always feel better in the morning. even if that thing comes back to mind, it doesn't bother me nearly as much as it used to!    look on the bright side, atleast you didn't hit him!!!    good luck!|`|UKNmZsU5aa	I think if you just relax a little you'll be fine.  Think about what you did wrong. Next time correct it.  Be happy it wasn't an accident.|`|s4aX6bF6aa	ever hear of 'if you fall off your horse get back on'...well you had a spooky moment...shake it off as experience for next time...and don't forget to check your blindspots.|`|4qyRl14aaa	Get a boyfriend...... so he can drive!|`|2ZEm9cvVaa	well one way is to deal with ur fear i was just in a accident and im still thinkin about it just learn from ur mistakes and live on :)|`|vD3VS98oaa	Get in a car accident then you wont really care about almost getting in an accident and more about the injuries you have just received. OK that was bad advice at least tried to help how come everyone keeps thinking i know all the answers i'm not Einstein for god sake.|`|zOIgzIy4aa	you need to get that out of your head or you will always be afraid to drive. if you drive any length of time you will find out more then that. you can,t let it worry you.|`|Yq2CUhtYaa	Well, two things.    Either you can focus on it.    Or you can be glad you're alive, and get over it.|`|1Gj0uKxzaa	Don't be in a rush to forget it - eventually you will. Use the fear to build and reinforce some better habits. Start driving again, but stick to smaller, slower roads until you feel comfortable again. But some fear is good. Too many people think nothing can happen - that's *really* scary...
S6grX41qaa	Of course you can, but you'll be working just to pay for the insurance bill.<br>  This is what is ruining people's lives in the USA. It's like a honeypot for flies.|`|kjAWsDwLaa	Sure, you can.  Just be sure to list the bank/loan company as the lienholder and send the checks in on time.|`|gdY0yPiAaa	yes|`|mwu6aJuyaa	yes you can, but you might want to consider the option of putting it under his because it will likely be cheaper for you. Being that he already has insurance, he has good credit (assuming, being that he's helping with your car) and he has a history with his insurance company which often leads to reduced rates and multi-line discounts. (discounts for having multiple things insured with a given company). You could still be primary driver on your car even if it's under his name and his policy. Just something to think about to save yourself some money until you get your car paid off, maybe even help you get it paid off faster.|`|Au2aI9a2aa	You can get insurance into your own name to drive any car. However you would not be the primary insurer.<br>  This would be a secondary insurance coverage as you are not the registered owner of the car and the DMV requires the registered owner of the car to have insurance.|`|Dqwajq4Qaa	I know that in New York, where I live, if a person A finances a car then person A has to insure it in his name. In some instances, using out-of-state insurance companies, Person B can insure it if they either have written permission from Person A OR they are a co-signer on the finance lien.|`|i8HxOaRUaa	Yes you sure can!|`|3gfkA4Xeaa	It will depend upon your insurance company's guidelines.  If the vehicle isn't registered to you, some companies will not add it to a policy in your name.  Also, whatever company your father is financing the vehicle through may require your name to know that you're the driver.  Make sure he checks with them first because they may not accept proof of insurance in your name only.  I'm sorry this is not a simple answer.  Unfortunately, it can be a process just depending upon both companies' requirements.  I hope this helps!|`|CasElICIaa	Buy your own car for $800 pay cash for it and get liability insurance for it. That's the SMART way and 5 times cheaper.
JJsJaQjxaa	Go for the YZ125. The CRF230's suspension is non adjustable and basic to say the least. The YZ will be lighter, can be entered into races and win if you're a good enough rider, and is way more advanced than the honda. About the only downside is top end rebuilds every once in a while. I don't know what that one post was talking about...having to rebuild the crank case? Something like that only has to be touched if there is catastrophic engine failure.|`|DOw7gdOAaa	Im 12 years old and have a YZ85    If your just riding in the woods and trails get a CRF230    But If your riding everywhere get the YZ125    The YZ125 will bee more powerful and faster than a CRF230, and I think that 2 stroke a funner the 4 strokes|`|vKW4iPxXaa	the best bike would be a crf230 because it has the power and it is fast as a two stroke but with a two stroke u have to rebuild the crank case by putting new bearings in the whole engine

895XRbnJaa	well the requirements are different in each state but in Pennsylvania we can get a learners permit when we are 16 which is just a written test and then 6 months later we take the actual driving test if you pass that then you get a junior license which lasts until you are eighteen and then you get an actual drivers license. with the juniors license there are some rules like you have to get off the road at a certain time|`|r5aokD7Yaa	each state is different    in some rural areas of some states, you can get a permit to drive to & from school when you're 14    most states have requirements for persons under 16 to participate in a class, driving with an instructor, pass a written test, and pass a driving test with a certified person (who may work for the state's department of motor vehicles)|`|1oMMx4W0aa	Okay so basically, when your 15 and 6 months if you are enrolled in a drivers ed class, you can go to the dmv and get your learners permit, if you are not enrolled than you have to take a test. After 6 months of driving with an adult over 25, u can then go and test to get your drivers lisence at 16. but if u dont take drivers ed, you have to wait until you are 18. an i believe u have a restricted license hear untill ur 21. although i have a restricted liscence idk wht tht entails really. smthin, but i forgit|`|MpiTctvbaa	It  depends on which state you live in. They all have different laws. Generally the driving age is 16. You must take a class, pass a written state test, if you pass your written test then you need to take a driving test with that's states driving person. They will then either pass/fail you. This could take 6 months to a year.|`|eHHp4tulaa	My gracious, you have to go through a lot to get a driver's license.   The kids here just have to take driver's education in school. They then get a permit to drive.   They can drive right away with another person who has a driver's license.   But, if they take the entire driving test, and pass it when they walk out the door they are legal to drive.     Today's young people here in illinois have a lot of restrictions on their driver's license at first, but as they age it gets better for them.    Every state in the United States have different regulations on driving license. You would have to check with each state's regulations and rules of the road to be complete. They usually don't vary a whole lot.|`|M21c8MQ9aa	In America, you cannot get your learner's permit (a form of a license that only allows you to drive only while accompanied by someone who has a driver's license) until you are 16 years old. In order to recieve a permit, you must pass an eye test and a written test. When you pass that, you must hold your permit for six months. After your six months is up, you go back and try for your license. This consists of a driving test. In the old days, the DMV (Department of Motor Vehicles) provided you a car to take your driving test in. Now, you must provide your own car. It must have liability insurance and everything must work properly in it.  When you pass your road test, you are given your license. There are a number of restrictions that may be on your license, but I don't know what they are. But after you recieve your license, you are permitted to do everything that you could do with a full license in your country|`|vLYirJ3laa	you gotta spell license right first! and at 16 you get a permit. drive for 6 months and like 6 hours at night. take you test at dmv get your license. and wait another 6 months till you can drive passengers under the age of 25 or something. but the best way is to be 18 clears everything.
RoTp5VAUaa	You also should compare car insurance quotes for different cars before buying one, for example here - carinsurance.enacre.net|`|j5kj3Bxtaa	A price range would be nice and unless you're towing and/or going off road there is nothing an SUV can do that a wagon or hatchback cant btw. Since you're mentioning strollers a Minivan may be better for you since it's better at carrying people than an SUV is.|`|racuITx9aa	The Ford Escape is really good and gets great mileage. You can probably get a great deal on one now because I think the foreign cars (honda, nissan, toyota, etc) are very overpriced.
Bl9zcqxQaa	The Federal emission warranty for all makes is 8 years or 80,000 miles.  So no, your car is not covered.  Price around to get the best price.   Good luck|`|54d31d8ca1d93393903fc5f7a7334431aa	They'll fix it, but it will not be under warranty.|`|cQqc1Qicaa	After 100k, I don't think you have a leg to stand on.|`|Dvf3cPshaa	truthfully at 11 years old the car has zero manufacture warranty at all.  but there are certain extended warranties that go out surprisingly far.  And I have heard at some toyota classes that toyota will still replace cats even after warranty has expired.  I think to keep satisfaction numbers up.
379b18fddd29f1b64385008f275bdd61aa	You have posted so much it is hard to go through. What I understand is that you bought a piece of junk car that you didn't check out before you made the purchase. It was your responsibility to check the car out and make sure it had all it was supposed to and would be suitable for your needs. You failed in that. Sorry, but despite the fact they took you for a ride, it was your negligence that sealed the deal.|`|8GDBr2U9aa	Bummer. You had the opportunity to inspect the vehicle before you bought it. If you didn't, then whose problem is that? Did you even look at the vehicle before you bought it? It doesn't sound like you did.|`|c22cd3bc80b769e97ac9ae2bc60d368eaa	So, if I understand correctly, you bought a junk car you didn't check out from a sleazy dealer who lied to you, correct?  Legally, I doubt you have any recourse for being naive (I avoided saying dumb).  What you could do is:   1.  Go into the business at a busy time.  Very loudly start complaining about your experience.  Make sure everyone hears what liars & cheats they are.  Go many times.    2.  Contact Better Business Bureau, State Attorney General, DMV (how did it pass inspection?), TV stations ("Call for Action"), etc.  They may be of little help since it's your word against his.    3.  Tell everyone you know & meet what a crook he is.    4.  Think of ways to legally disrupt his business; have your friends go car shopping.  Tie his time up.  Have him show them numerous vehicles, test drive all of them, have trade in bid, discuss terms, argue on pricing & then leave.      5.  Park the car in front of his business with a big lemon on it with a sign "bought here!"  AND BUY THE MECHANIC A GIFT for being an honorable man working for a crook.|`|ozwLZwXeaa	I am so sorry you are going through this.  The rule is you should have taken the Lincoln and have it checked out front to back, inside and outside. In court they will say it is your fault for not taking the time to do that.        Buyer beware but still call a lawyer.
EbY4jX7Oaa	Huuumm well  Its really your decision to make. I personally went to mechanic school first and then welding then auto body. Im into restorations and it all helps. good luck|`|AA11264416	well im not to sure but you might could make more doing body and paint work, there's mechanics everywhere but not nearly as many that does body work and paint jobs, most schools like Wyotech you can do the auto body program and do mechanics on the side also|`|a3838c0cd2f7f63124657ac7f4657dfbaa	As far as pay is concerned both pay about equal if you are good at your job.  Do like I did, Got my technicians papers. Then went for body and got my papers for that one also. Then went back to university, ended running a dealership .|`|hlve6Engaa	that's a question u got to ask yourself. you know what u like|`|6ab3673bb81ad84f3158efb113c25ce3aa	go for auto mechanic .. more useful ;)|`|Dvf3cPshaa	that's like asking which would be better, being kicked in the groin or hit in the throat.  jk.  I think takes longer to make money as a mechanic.  If you are better with numbers and logic be a mechanic.  if you are more artistic maybe you would be better with auto body.  sprayers can make really good money,  over a 100k a year if you are really good.
kIy2bdiraa	Take a broom stick and hold it against the different components.  Then put your ear to the stick.  The noise will travel up the stick and you will be able to determine where the squeak is coming from.|`|zOIgzIy4aa	is the belt running straight? it,s probably a serpentine belt. maybe it,s the AC is making the noise.|`|AA12095978	it's probably the belt tensioner and/or Idler pully.    water pumps don't really squeak because they're constantly being lubricated via the antifreeze.  alternator's don't really squeak unless the bearings are giving out.  the belt tensioner and idler pullys can squeak for a while & stop when they get warmer because the grease inside has disapated and/or leaking out.  could also be the tensioner unit itself.  These are EASY things to replace anyway.  the idler is located on the right side of the motor if you're facing it.  the tensioner is under the air intake hose.|`|vvgw5MBTaa	Remove the serpentine belt & spin the accessories.  You should be able to narrow down the source.  1. Idler pulley  2. A/C Pulley  3. Alternator  4. Air Pump  5. Water Pump  6. P/S Pump    ???|`|PsdWiZQoaa	I don't know what is causing the squeak but the power steering pump is also attached to pulley system, make sure your fluid levels for it are right.  Most cars also have a tension pulley, this keeps the belt at the right tension so it doesn't fly off.
FgRUdQOBaa	The difficult part is getting hired, the railroad provides all the on the job training needed. <br>  Relocation to a dispatching center then you would be permanent, not any moving after that involved. <br>  Pay and retirement benefits are very good. <br>  <br>  By FAA do you mean Federal Aviation Administration? that is not a requirment.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Hoghead, around here I think they do it anally and also remove the sense of humor gland, after all, that is a lot closer to the brains of most dispatchers and not nearly as painful.|`|OWOoITTkaa	Definitely a very serious job, always have to remember that you have people's lives in your hands.  You would need to be qualified on the operating rules of the railroad you are looking to be employed by (the most popular are GCOR and NORAC), along with the timetable and special instructions, physical characteristics, etc.  You would also be subject to very strict hours of service rules and drug testing.  The benefits and pay tend to be very good with the bigger roads, and all common carriers belong to the Railroad Retirement system, which is an excellent thing to get in on.<br>  <br>  And as hoghead said... those with a sense of humor need not apply, haha.|`|e6a7b237eaa4f5be0d4d281381c815caaa	There are different types of Dispatchers. There are Crew Dispatchers and  Train Dispatchers, Years ago you needed to be a former telegraph operator in order to get a job as Assistant Train Dispatcher then get promoted to Dispatcher. Nowadays railways train you to do jobs that were formerly seniority type jobs. When I first started on the RR as a Locomotive Fireman I was assigned to the Spare Board then later I was forced to work as a Hostler in the Roundhouse. That meant working a regular 8 hour shift with lousy hours and lousy days off. So I left that and became a Brakeman.|`|902bf06cc6e416f1757072330cfc5b9daa	Difficult?  I'm inclined to say, no.  Though I rarely admit it, my brother was a train dispatcher for 30+ years for the SP and its successor, UP.  Decent pay, union representation, good benefits and RRT.<br>  <br>  But there are drawbacks.  It can be a high stress job for many, for example.  Even further, I'm told it is very painful when they stick that tube up your nose to suck out half your brain...
AA11264416	well im not into that, im into the loud 4x4 lifted trucks but 20s ain't to bad, but the ones with the 22s and bigger just want attention i think and maybe self absorbed sometimes, not all but some, but 20s ain't over board so thats fine, only thing i think looks plainly stupid is when cars are lifted a little just to fit even bigger rims made for trucks/SUVs, they look stupid, but its funny when the people with the big 22s or bigger get mad that the cops are always looking at them hmmm i wonder why lol, but don't go any bigger than 20s|`|ihOIHE5Aaa	He's got his priorities mixed up.

RjHNxn8zaa	Yes, automatic transmission is available as a no-cost option on 2009 models.  I didn't check availability for prior years.  CTS-V is noted for being the fastest production sedan; I think it edges out the Lexus and Jaguar in performance, and spaciousness.|`|addaf7237cf3d32190cfc96546e98709aa	CTS-V , BMW M5, Mercedes E class AMG, Audi S6, and Jaguar XK-F compete with each other.    The IS-F is a small car that competes with Audi RS4, BMW M3 sedan, and Mercedes C63 AMG    The CTS-V is manual only.  The Lexus and Mercedes are Automatics only.    The best car is the CTS-V. More comfortable and better value than the Lexus, which is just a bit more reliable.|`|MwrRCxKGaa	You can Order the Cts-V With an automatic trans. and i think that the cts is the best of the three best price for the best power, now if you are looking for a track car i would not go with the cts, the jaguar is more of a track car but runs for around 83-97k.If you want a Muscle car with Muscle car interior then go with the Cts And its 53k best deal of the three.btw imo The jaguar looks the best... i dont like the lexus that much looks like something my grandma would drive :0

These are mostly car nerds though, so if you don't know what you're talking about they will jump on you. However lurking there you will learn a lot. When I started posting there I knew a lot, but I was still impressed by their knowledge.     Another thing you can do is check out jalopnik and autoblog. They are some of the bigger car blog sites. So you can keep up with car news and learn a lot that way. Jalopnik has a cool fantasy garage feature where they put some recent and classic cars up into their "fantasy garage" and explain why the car should go into it. Doing that teaches you A LOT about the cars.     Third you can always IM me and ask if you have any questions.

Dvf3cPshaa	It sounds like you have more than one problem but they could be related.  gm has several tsbs about aftermarket alarm systems causing running problems.  Other problem could be in radio.  newer cars will run serial data through the radio for some stupid reason which can turn off abs and airbag systems and even more.  As far as battery draw.  A 1 amp draw such as a glove box light in 75 degree weather will make your truck unstartable in about 3 days.  not sure if i am helping any but i would fix your wires sticking out of the dash i am not a radio person but i believe blue is for the amp signal.  good luck.|`|XFZmAMOAaa	Have someone who knows electrical systems check it out before it burns up.Sounds like you have big problems.|`|fq2GAOEpaa	you probably have a bad alternator.

Obviously, the 2+2 fits more people, but the cost is the added weight of more seating. Most people wouldn't notice the difference when driving, but if you are more interested in going .2 seconds faster around a turn than having 700lbs worth of people in your car, the 2 seater is better. The other thing to think about is whether that back seat would really be able to fit people in it anyway.

4Y2mxvnfaa	I would definitely go for the Honda.  It's a lot less miles, a lot less hassles to maintain, and it's much easier to find parts for the Civic in case anything happens.    Didn't the Firebird get discontinued?  There's probably a reason for that.    Not to mention, there's practically an extra year of life in the Honda in terms of mileage and model year for only $50 more!|`|HpwyYmoIaa	i would personally go for the firebird, they are very good cars and have very good looks. i wouldnt get the honda its kinda old lady-ish to me and i would never own a honda anyway, you see way to many of them around and i like to stick out alittle i guess, not in a bad way of course, and then you also never see a wrecked honda cause if they are ever in a wreck they are usually totaled because of the way they are made, and sure it will have a little better gas mileage and has slightly less miles but those 2 pluses for the honda isnt worth it in my opinion, if you take care of the pontiac it will last you a long time, and see if the 75k mile maintenance has been done and youll be good|`|tEhJ3v99aa	Did you check out the price of insurance on the Firebird vs the the Honda. I think that  will answer your question.|`|j5kj3Bxtaa	If it's the V6 Firebird with the 3800 V6 then you have nothing to worry about as far as reliability is concerned. Those cars are bulletproof.

If you want a fast car you might as well go with a Trans/Am.|`|BhxycGViaa	firebird|`|PHyVkmPyaa	think of gas and insurance, honda still beats the Firebird  on money.

Before that they were more basic like Deluxe and Series.

bqLvWpcZaa	They are both very good engines.  The M617 engine ( found in the 300SD ) has a nearly bullet-proof reputation but it is also a coarse engine.  It vibrates noticeably at idle and is also quite loud.  The M602 engine ( found in the 300D 2.5 ) does not have quite the same reputation but is a much more quiet ( for a diesel ) and refined engine ( much less vibration at idle ).    I've personally seen examples of each of these models reach over 500K km on the original engine.  I would go for the 300D 2.5 because the body is the W124 chassis.  It is a well proven and robust chassis.  The W126 (  300SD ) is also a solid design but if this car spent any time in a snowbelt region, have the underbody inspected thoroughly.  The suspension components can rot out and are very expensive to replace ( especially the rear control arms ).
AA11151305	Sounds like the internal mechanism that controls the blend air door to your climate control system.  Find out what controls your blend door (i.e. vacuum, electrical or mechanical) and you might find your control switch there.|`|BAN3dRcAaa	The most common cause of the cool air when set on heat is not the Control switch in your car but an air pocket in the cooling system.  The heater core in the dash is the highest point in the cooling system flow and is the most likely to go deficient when coolant is low. Air pockets are difficult to remove in your '96 but if you keep checking the radiator level each morning, when the engine is cold and before starting, and "topping it off", you should be able to top off and have full efficiency soon,  Alan  P.S. If the coolant at the radiator is always a bit low and the overflow bottle level continues to rise to overfull when cold, then either your radiator cap is bad or you have a bad head gasket.

mAZi1eH7aa	The 10 is the density of the oil when cold. The 30 is the oil density when hot. The lower density is to allow lubrication when the engine is cold and there is no oil circulation. Using 30 only will not allow oil lubrication to your engine when it is first started. The best oil would be 5W30 synthetic, but 10W30 will do as a second best. SEA30 will never do.  As a suggestion, I always recommend a bottle of Lucas oil at every change.|`|a919ffaf7b39c58d58f4680cb8cc3324aa	Oh hell no.|`|zOIgzIy4aa	you can use SAE if it,s HD oil. make sure it reads HD 30.|`|BgwTxzEFaa	No, you should not use straight 30 oil in place of 10W30, especially if you live where the temperature varies.  When it gets cold out, the polymers in the oil allow the oil to prevent becoming too thick or too thin when it is warmer out.|`|YsQQ30YJaa	CAN, yes. Should, probably not. It depends on your situation. If you live in a cold climate you need that oil to be a little thinner for easy starting and good flow through the engine before it warms. If you have a high mileage engine you might consider 10w-40 instead.|`|s9ZUMI5maa	No.    And to refute an answer above, there are no polymers in motor oil. There are organic compounds, yes, but no polymers.    To correct an answer below, it's not "10 winter 40" or whatever. The 'w' stands for WEIGHT, not WINTER.    Don't listen to that idiot.|`|Jw4vSc2Baa	No. Do not use straight 30. Your vehicle calls for 10 winter 30 operating temperature oil.    Your engine requires a lighter weight when starting up. 30 will be the weight when you are at your operating temperature.    You use 10w30 (mineral and synthetic) that will cover the largest environmental temperature range for your vehicle. You do have other options though depending on how old it is, and the make/model. If it's cold use a lighter weight oil if it's hotter use a 10w30 or a 10w40.    For instance you could use a 5w30 (mineral or synthetic) oil or a 0w30 synthetic. (for a new vehicle)    If you are leaking oil and were thinking a heavier weight oil would reduce the leak you are partially correct. Picture slamming your fist into a bucket and pulling it out. The heavier/thicker the oil the harder it is to do that.    A good oil to use IF you are leaking may be a 10w40 oil. or a 5w40 synthetic, as you will leak the most oil after your engine heats up to the operating temperature. You can also buy engine seal additives, which supposedly treat and swell the engine gaskets and reduce the severity of leaks.

If you are itching to buy a project car, then buy one for $1,000 or less and use the rest of the money to dump into your dream.    Your first car shouldn't be a project.  I strongly recommend that you buy a cheap runner like an old Toyota Camry for $1500 and put the rest into the bank, do your research and learn about cars before you end up blowing all your precious money on a lot of nothing.

It's a little underpowered but there are some people who cure that by way of importing the Nissan Silvia's legendary SR20DET. Otherwise, there'd probably be some turbo kits for the Miata, lowered suspension, new mags, killer sound system...the MX5 is a decent modified car.    Non-convertible wise, let your imagination run wild. I'd start with a DC2 Honda/Acura Integra and work your way up. You might also be able to find a decent Soarer with the twin-turbo 1JZ-GTE motor in it as well, those things kill V8s standard. They're very strong motors in both cars too, able to withstand lots of horsies from standard. The Integra may be front-wheel-drive but its more of a semi-racing car.

Here is a story this is a newer car, but the principle still applies. A guy I know has a rich grandfather. His GP has a Flying Spur. While at a mall a lady in a Nissan Versa isn't looking while backing out and hits his Bentley in the front bumper denting the Bentley. It was $17,000 to replace the front bumper and repaint it.

gstBWswfaa	A capacitor is only good so far as the audio system isn't trying to pull too much from the electrical system. A cap doesn't provide more power, it's designed to 'stiffen' the voltage to the amp, nothing else. If the current isn't there, a cap won't help. The alternator must have at least 20% more amperage power than the entire vehicle and sound system combined for a cap to be of benefit which is ironically the same requirements for an amp to be efficient. A cap does it's best to keep the voltage at a certain level, but if the voltage changes so will the cap voltage. The cap just makes the change smoother. The diming light syndrome isn't a voltage issue but rather a current (amperage) drop. The voltage simply follows what the current does. A cap does not help this situation at all. A cap doesn't provide more power nor does it try to correct it.<br>  <br>  <br>  so a cap will just be a waste of your money.. you may not need to upgrade anything.. but if anything you will just need to do the "big three" upgrade<br>  <br>  a ho alternator wouldnt hurt but go the cheaper way and upgrade the big three.. if that doesnt help any then go with a ho alternator|`|mwu6aJuyaa	You can google capacitor set up and get alot of instructions on how to install a capacitor.

My lights were dimming slightly, and yes the capacitor did fix the problem. I also noticed the bass was crisper. Which makes perfect sense if you understand what a capacitor does.<br>  <br>  I will say that there is conflicting views on the subject, there are many people that say capacitors are not good and that you will need to upgrade your alternator. The fact remains, I had the same problem as you, I got a cap and the problem was fixed, I rest my case and let the facts do the talking.<br>  <br>  You will need nothing less than a 1 farad capacitor for a 1000W amp. Don't worry about the amp for your regular speakers, just worry about a cap for your subs.|`|fOmH3wUvaa	If your lights dim out, then the voltage at the amplifier is dropping significantly. A cap will help keep your voltage at the amp stable which will allow the bass to hit harder. It will help out with sound quality if the bass clips or the is there is other distortion.<br>  <br>  Caps let their charge go extremely quickly but have a low capacity where a battery has a high capacity and can't release it quickly. To use them effectively, keep the wiring between the cap and the amp as short as possible and use heavy wiring also.

c9uCz19taa	That is a little steep.  I'm also leery of places that do "courtesy inspections" and then tell you they found lots of things wrong.  Even if you go with that shop I would have the problem verified somewhere else.    If you have one tie rod end bad I would replace them all.  You have an inner and an outer tie rod end on both sides and they do the exact same job so usually the wear is about the same on them.  Also you have to have an alignment after one is replaced so you might as well get all four new and then the alignment.  Autozone sells the inner ones for $52 each and the outer ones for $26 each with a lifetime warranty.  I get a lot of my parts off of eBay (no warranty but much cheaper).  If you go that route you can probably get all four pieces for under $100.  An experienced mechanic could have all four replaced in under two hours easy.    One other thing that you might need is the rubber boot that covers the inside tie rod end.

I own a 2003 mustang, and I might buy a 2010 mustang, but I will likely keep my car as well.  No need getting rid of my car when it's paid off and there is nothing wrong with it.
f43be0279e4f60717eb598a32d93faa0aa	CPI Taiwan. CPI group was founded in 1991 and is a Taiwanese company. However the bikes are made almost exclusively in the PRC. Makes sense, when I was there, (Taiwan) every man and his dog had a scooter, although they were Kymco's etc....400 GBP...depends on the model and condition.|`|hlqj0pvxaa	I believe CPI is a Taiwanese company. <br>  <br>  Taiwanese bikes are higher quality than the typical Chinese makes. <br>  <br>  The most important thing is the Quality Control that a distributor sets up in the manufacturer. <br>  <br>  Some of the lower end scooters can be great if this issue was observed.
Q2wdm3spaa	I run 2" straight pipes on my Shovel, and Screamin' Eagle II duals with a Stage I kit on Twin Cam. The Eagles have a nice mellow note I like, but still have a crisp sound. Like Firecracker said, there's a lot of personal taste involved.|`|1ca078fb6ac9d1741007da931ca6cd16aa	You know, I really don't know what they are.<br>  After messing around with gutted (2 different ways) stock mufflers, I bought a set of baffled slip-ons from the shop down the road. He said Santee, but I think Cycle Shack. I don't even know what model they were for, but they weren't for a Dyna. The mounts are different.<br>  I run them on a set of modified original headpipes.<br>  <br>  You're deep into personal preference territory.<br>  I like duals.|`|XpKY04Tnaa	On my Sportster I have Python slash cuts that are great. <br>  On my FHLT I have Suppertrapp. <br>  <br>  Most of the Harley riders in my area have Vance & Hines pipes. <br>  <br>  I like to not be part of the heard and have a different sound than every bike on the road.|`|pSnI6ywJaa	By far the most popular seem to be Rinehart or Vance & Hines exhaust.  Looks and the way it sounds seem shallow, but are important, after all we are talking about riding our Harley!  Some important factors to think abotu are well noted at the atached link.  I think you'll find this helpful.  Please check our prices at Ride Shack when yuo dicide you are ready to buy!|`|6f89b5d16dbdb895634e3f8c49efb428aa	I really like Vance and Hines. i put a set of their straight shots on an evo I used to have. Only set of pipes I've ever installed where I could really feel a performance gain. I would nor recommend the long Shots though. Pipes that long are very hard or almost impossible to tune properly.|`|ghaETYwcaa	for performance the 2 into 1 is the way to go.However for sound and of course looks its allways a dual twin pipe set up. Me myself 30  inch long inch and a quarter  diameter home made drag pipes is all I ever use. With an anti reversion cone of course!|`|f41f07330effd00e202635eab4dc96b5aa	Some good choices, some useless and stupid. I have a moderately modified Hertage Softail... I put on Screamin' eagle slip-ons, and tuned the baffles to the Andrews cams. It runs and sounds fantastic. -And when I let off the gas at around 110, there's no popping or empty "gargling" at the pipes. -thats my 2 cents... do your thing.... you're the only one that has to be pleased.|`|d4faf8027bc15de335da3e549fd8364baa	Always dual pipes! A 2in1 set is a headache, believe me. I had a 2 in 1 header set on a bike once and it was so deafening I took it off and put gutted dual exhausts/mufflers on it|`|2a81d626b8332849227f2aa88c035fc6aa	I went with PipeDreamz Insomnic's drag pipes on my 07 Sportster|`|9f1b60e24ea206cbe8c589ad31539dc1aa	cycle shack,not hard on the wallet and look and sound nice.
808f8239addd67976faf828dba2a4992aa	When air bags first came out they were more dangerous because they had not got all the bugs out same with seat belts. Why do you think they have a lap Belt and a shoulder harness? because the belts caused people to be cut in half, but they don't report that. Also air bags killed people if the didn't have the seat belts on and many children died from impact by a air bag child ws to small and when the bag exploded  it broke their necks adults too. Seat belts and air bags were pushed by the insurance company's so they did not have to pay for the injuries from car accidents. The same with helmets for motorcycle drivers and bicycle riders, it's about the money. As for putting spikes on the steering Wheel it is silly, you can still be killed by the seat belt and the air bag. If there is a defect in the bag or the firing mechanism it can kill you so thinking your safe is just plain stupid, you have a bag coming at you at 220 miles an hour and hits you in the face, if anything goes wrong your dead! imagine being hit with a piece of plywood at 220 miles per hour that's what it's like. some have air bags down by your feet and could shear off your legs in the right conditions and the metal dictates the conditions and luck. There were air bags as early as the early 1970's in test runs . The new air bags don't use rocket fuel to fire them off anymore they use different methods but still deadly so go on thinking your safe you still can be killed or mamed for life if things go wrong. to think your even safe traveling at the speed of a bullet shows you how stupid people can be when they don't understand how these things work.|`|51d9e39c71aaaed7424c9ac49e9069c5aa	That's a good question. <br>  I honestly doubt that many people even think about the air bag when they're driving. And, after the initial shock of seeing 10" spikes sticking out of the steering wheel, I suspect people would soon stop thinking about those also (too busy texting, dialing their cell phone, searching for a radio station, eating lunch, clipping their finger nails, etc....etc.....)|`|jYy6dDAZaa	Spikes MAY make you aware of driving into a tree but do nothing about the vehicle that smash you in traffic.<br>  You cannot plan on an accident, they happen accidently.<br>  They are not intended for parking lot bumps but for carshes that would cause major injuries.|`|nIkFQfE2aa	personally the airbag scares me more then the actual accident..<br>  <br>  I was in a car accident and the air bag broke my jaw..but i guess its better then flying threw the windshield..but i think that's what the seat belt is for|`|XLXncQu9aa	The purpose of airbags is to cushion the amount of damage done in a crash.  Generally they are safe but throughout the years, injuries have been linked with air bag deployment.  Here is information done based on studies of air bag injury and the risks. <br>  <br>  The study comes from Craig Newgard, MD, of Oregon Health & Science University. He's due to present his findings Friday in Chicago at the annual meeting of the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine.<br>  <br>  Newgard analyzed injury statistics for 1995-2005 from a motor vehicle crash database.<br>  <br>  The database shows that during the years studied, 52,552 drivers and 14,732 passengers were involved in crashes.<br>  <br>  Most of those people weren't seriously injured, but 2.5% of the drivers and 2.6% of the passengers sustained serious injuries to any part of the body.<br>  <br>  Newgard reviewed data on the drivers' and passengers' height and weight, air bags, and 10 factors about the crash.<br>  <br>  He found that air bags were "modestly protective" for front-seat passengers of medium height, which he defined as being between 5 foot 3 inches tall to 5 foot 11 inches tall.<br>  <br>  However, Newgard writes that "air bags appear to increase the risk of injury for large- and small-stature adults."<br>  <br>  Basically from the study it was found that height is a reason why injuries would occur.  However as you can see the percentages of serious injuries are small.  Injuries and deaths can happen because of air bags, but the percentages are not so great.|`|wpgRMjgraa	The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration ( NHTSA) states that there has been a good return on the enormous investment in Airbags; just 152 deaths for a statistical estimate of about 5000 lives saved. <br>  <br>  But the real number of airbag caused deaths is greater.  And this doesn't even consider all the severe injuries caused by airbags over the last 12 years. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.airbagonoff.com/rbarticle.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.airbagonoff.com/rbarticle.htm</a>
CubxpK0gaa	no not at all just because i'm gunna get one, but it's fun to drive threw the walmart parking lot and scar the **** out of ramdom people|`|LygV4VOOaa	no.<br>  <br>  What set up are you running? Whered you get it?<br>  Im looking to install one sometime now.|`|TdrgZwnoaa	Not in the slightest, my friend.<br>  <br>   But; if you did that and I were to put a .457 slug through your engine block would that **** you off? Just curious.|`|Yq2CUhtYaa	Not really.<br>  <br>  Your train horn is illegal to have on a personal vehicle. So I'll simply report you to the police for excessive use of a horn, disturbing the peace, and for vehicle equipment violation.<br>  <br>  Have fun with those tickets.
8d66998c4e4a1670785cfa3cf37d043eaa	tron is an idiot. have someone with a scanner check the door adjar switches. most likely its the drivers door. or spray wd40 in the latches. open and close the door 15 times. to get it lubed up. the switch is in the bottom of the latch. and there are updated switches.  25-30 bucks each 1 hour to install. don't wast your money on inaccurate diagnosis just to have someone throw parts at it.|`|CubxpK0gaa	the door ajar switch i probly bad|`|kvGHnEHjaa	first, check your dimmer switch, if it's all the way up it will keep your lights on. (don't worry, i won't tell anyone you did that) otherwise you probably have a bad door ajar switch, most likely the liftgate or drivers door. try spraying wd 40 in all the latches and work the latches, if that's not it check the sliding door contacts for corrosion, clean them up with a little sandpaper and you should be good to go. good luck.|`|tBq6ZDZvaa	check the switch's that are mounted on the front of the door frame they look like push buttons they go bad all the time water and dirt gets in them and makes the contacts corrode. they are cheep like 2 dollars and you can get them at any auto parts store.
W155OmfMaa	the type 2 is more powerful. Engine size doesn't always equal more power. for example, the j30a in the 03-07 accord is a 3.0 and makes 240 hp. Conversely, the 3.8 v6 in the 95-2004 mustang make only like 140-150 hp.    stick with your type 2.|`|kbXTofhEaa	a type2 block with a 3.5 head!!
dXGvp5sVaa	When looking at Afla's, especially Spiders, consider the YEAR. A spider from 1991 and up is a great find, and usually run great, but will run above $10,000 if it is in great condition. Spiders from the mid 80's had a lot of problems with the engine and transmission, and are known to break down.|`|cB247Azuaa	Don't see the post, but you will need to know a thing or two about cars.  You don't just buy the parts off the shelf. - Why?, because there is no shelf.    Start making friends with mechanics...
cQqc1Qicaa	You may have a shorted diode in the alternator, which not only charges poorly, but will also discharge the battery when not running.  The voltage regulator is built into your alternator.|`|zOIgzIy4aa	it sounds like advance was right. if you had to get it jumped then it,s possible that the alternator is bad or you have a weak cell in the battery.|`|51d9e39c71aaaed7424c9ac49e9069c5aa	Apparently, Advanced Auto was right.|`|QM0Ezfvnaa	Electrical problems can be intermittant . . . Advance may have put a tester on the alternator and saw something that disappeared for the Auto Zone tester.    It will be the alternator, the voltage regulator or the battery . . . these are the three items in the charging system that one targets. NONE are expensive and only the alternator can be a little trouble to get in/out.    If you replace the alternator, do the voltage regulator at the same time . . . one can affect the other and the regulator is cheeeep!|`|c9uCz19taa	Take it back and have it tested again.  Something is definately wrong.
TdrgZwnoaa	If you mean cigarette smoke then it is coming from every surface of the interior of the car. That means everything from the headliner down to the carpet.   Car detailing shops can get that smell out. They have chemicals that can completely remove all odours permanently.
