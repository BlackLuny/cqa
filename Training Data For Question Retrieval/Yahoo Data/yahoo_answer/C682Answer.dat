First you deside the guy realy worth it or just for *** he is saying to you.|`|c04c5741427382a6b1b00479817db64caa	Its always wrong to tell someone you love them if you really don't. I'm not talking about loving them as a friend or because he's a really nice guy. I'm talking about being in love with him and that you want to spend the rest of your life with him. It is really unfair for you to be doing this to him. You are being selfish because although you are not in love with him there is something that makes you want to stay with him, as you say "throughout my life". You should be honest with him, let him move on and find a woman who really loves him and won't play with his emotions. I'm sure if it were the other way around, you would be hurt. Don't mess with this mans heart, set him free and let him live a life with someone who actually knows how they feel about him.|`|AA11749277	how old are you you sound very young
AA11046024	Red Skelton <br>  Bernard Richard "Red" Skelton (July 18, 1913 – September 17, 1997) was an American comedian born in Vincennes, Indiana who started in vaudeville as a teenager, worked his way up to Broadway shows, secondary roles in MGM movies, radio performances and finally popularity in the early days of TV. His eponymous variety show ran alternately on the television networks CBS and NBC from 1951 through 1971. (See: The Red Skelton Show.)<br>  <br>  He is best remembered for taking on the persona of circus clowns in traditional makeup — a role that may have come naturally to Skelton, since his father, who died shortly before his birth, had worked as a clown for the Hagenbeck & Wallace Circus. His best-known clown persona was "Freddy the Freeloader", who had traditional tramp clown makeup. Another popular character was goofy "Clem Kadiddlehopper".<br>  <br>  Near the end of his life, Skelton said his daily routine included writing a short story a day and composing a piece of music a day (which he would then sell to providers of background music such as Muzak).<br>  <br>  One of America's best-loved comedians, Red Skelton is buried in Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery, in Glendale, California.<br>  <br>  <br>  Filmography<br>  Having Wonderful Time (1938) <br>  Seeing Red (1939) (short subject) <br>  Flight Command (1940) <br>  The People vs. Dr. Kildare (1941) <br>  Whistling in the Dark (1941) <br>  Dr. Kildare's Wedding Day (1941) <br>  Lady Be Good (1941) <br>  Ship Ahoy (1942) <br>  Maisie Gets Her Man (1942) <br>  Panama Hattie (1942) <br>  Whistling in Dixie (1942) <br>  Du Barry Was a Lady (1943) <br>  Thousands Cheer (1943) <br>  I Dood It (1943) <br>  Whistling in Brooklyn (1943) <br>  Radio Bugs (1944) (short subject) (voice) <br>  Bathing Beauty (1944) <br>  The Luckiest Guy in the World (1946) (short subject) (voice) <br>  Ziegfeld Follies (1946) <br>  The Show-Off (1946) <br>  Merton of the Movies (1947) <br>  The Fuller Brush Man (1948) <br>  A Southern Yankee (1948) <br>  Neptune's Daughter (1949) <br>  The Yellow Cab Man (1950) <br>  Three Little Words (1950) <br>  Duchess of Idaho (1950) (cameo) <br>  The Fuller Brush Girl (1950) (cameo) <br>  Watch the Birdie (1950) <br>  Excuse My Dust (1951) <br>  Texas Carnival (1951) <br>  Lovely to Look At (1952) <br>  The Clown (1953) <br>  Half a Hero (1953) <br>  The Great Diamond Robbery (1953) <br>  Hollywood Goes to War (1954) (short subject) <br>  Susan Slept Here (1954) (cameo) <br>  Around the World in Eighty Days (1956) <br>  Public Pigeon No. One (1957) <br>  Ocean's Eleven (1960) <br>  Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines (1965)|`|4e9c0f9d8f451fc760a4f2916069c107aa	do u mean red skelton...the comedian....if so i wrote a paper on him...i can help you wit that

AA12070575	Thats a tough situation, but can be worked through if done in the right manner. If I were you I would look for a job and until you find one its really not worth worrying about. However, if you did find a job far away realize that your son and mother might not like to separate from eachother but thats part of life, and besides its not like you couldnt visit. You need to do whats in the besty interest for your son and if you are not happy where you are than it will reflect on your attitude towards the BOTH of them. So as someone who has their Psychology degree, try to understand that not all good-byes are forever and really you never know what possiblilites your son could have if you do move. Plus a move might mean finding someone for yourself as well and what better way for your son to have a father figure. So you see it can happen anywhere even where you are, but you must do whats in the best interest for the both of you. Good luck and hope this helps and doesnt confuse...|`|26bed8a801858486e2b917a2a961c015aa	see if you can try a school closer to home. sometimes we have to give up the best to just have our children and the people we love near us. i know its hard and unfair but you can commute.|`|AA11455628	well first thing first is finish school then get a job, see what it pays and what is affordable etc. You didn't say how old the child is but old enough to talk and say what they like.

Maybe she can come with you? Maybe you can try the job you get locally for a year or two get experience and then be able to move to a better one and everyone will be ready for that plan.

While you are getting an education, be motivated by your dream to later move someday.  And if you get an education, you could get a better paid job and live richly later on a different coast.  Also, make a deal with yo mama and yo son, tell yo mama that if you stay and get an education, that after you are done with that education you can and will move. Make sure she approves and if she doesn't, stick with the plan and not tell her.  It is what is best for you and your son.

AA12247548	yes of course and I am still experiencing it.  It feels wonderful to be in love.  To be with the person you love and being loved.  True love is all about understanding your partner and trusting in him no matter what. It also means being together in thick and thin.  Yes there are little spats and fights but nothing can break the relationship if trust and loyalty is there.<br>  I was 19 when I found true love.  He is my first and last love.  Nine years have passed since then and today we are happily married with a 11 month old son. TOUCH-WOOD. We have to be patient and never lose hope in this matter.  i WISH YOU TOO FIND TRUE LOVE SOON IF YOU HAVEN'T FOUND IT YET.  CHERISH YOUR LOVE AND RESPECT HIM FOR BEING THERE.  NEVER TAKE YOUR PARTNER FOR GRANTED.<br>  All the Best and God bless.|`|2542a5bed84b3b443d5c237cedf937f0aa	true love experience in my school life  <br>  i am 18 year old and in my class a beautyful<br>  girl  she liked me and i love her|`|5469ba4e69d536655770bc60c4d18298aa	ya i had...at 15|`|AA12263571	Most of the time I really think that LOVE doesn't exist.

I've fallen in love three times.  But I was 18 before it was a mutual love, and I find that to be one of the truest of loves.  When your relationship survives some of the hardest times you've ever experienced in your entire life, when you almost die and realize you are at peace with that because you've found what you spent your life looking for, that's true love.  It's a rollercoaster, it's beautiful sometimes, sometimes it's hideously ugly...it feels so great most of the time, but sometimes you feel like your heart is being ripped out of your chest.  It's crazy, but I wouldn't pass this wonderful emotion up for anything in the entire world.|`|AA12217118	Yes but too bad only one way experience. By default, I naturally think of my bf well being before mine. It doesn't mean I am losing myself. I believe I can still love someone with all of my heart without losing myself but too bad he can't do the same for me. <br>  <br>  Well, since my bf is not willing to put me before himself, I can only tell u, what I think it'll be like....  <br>  <br>  You just know that whatever he/she does, your well being is always on top of the priorities so the trust is always there. No doubts. You'll have a comforted throughtout the day knowing someone is loving you unconditionally. =)
AA10701806	of course you should tell him your going to miss him!
AA11477616	yes he could be.. guys do strange things.. but you know us girls do at times too.. but he definitely wanted you to notice him for sure.. but actually he was rude if you ask me..maybe he really likes you and just does not know if you like him in the same way since you are getting tired of his attitude...if you do not  like him in that way i would just keep acting like you have been and i really would not let him bother you or upset you in any way...and are you sure him and your friend are nothing but friends?? well it is so hard to tell what guys feel anymore.. i have  had 7 sons i find them so hard to understand.. one thing i know about a few of mine is that they like to go out with women for just one thing... i do not think they have the same feelings women do either..i think , well most women or girls i think need to have feelings  for a guy but i do not think guys do have to really feel something for them.. maybe just lust or something like that...i do not know if this is helping you at all.. but i would say that it is a very good chance that he wants you to notice him and very possible he is trying to make you jealous.....|`|AA10896070	uhm i sorry i wish i could help.. but this seems confussing. and who knoes what going on inside of his mind. maybe you should just talk to him and tell him how you feel or ask how he feels. it would be better that way.
AA12047543	ok, so, like, you sound like you're probably, like, not at an age where you might be financially independent, meaning, e.g., that if you were to get to know him well, and then he were to move away, you wouldn't have the financial wherewithall nor the independence to continue to pursue the relationship, i.e., go with him.  considering this, why would you want to "start something that you can't finish?"<br>  <br>  but, assuming that the former were an irrelevant issue, if you want to get to know him, just take a deep breath, have courage (and CONFIDENCE), go up to him, and talk to him.  what's the worst that can possibly happen?  he doesn't have feelings for you, and you feel rejected, dejected, hurt, and your ego bruises for a few days - 2 weeks tops.  conversely, if he feels about you similarly to how you feel about him, you've found yourself a potentially wonderful experience.  if you never do anything, though, one thing is for certain: nothing will happen, and you will never know if anything would've happened.  <br>  <br>  as one of morrissey's song's lyrics state, "shyness is nice, but shyness can stop you, from doing all the things in life you'd like to."  sadly, very true words.<br>  <br>  i know it's not easy.  it's far easier said than done.  however, in the long run (even if this may perhaps not work out), taking (healthy) risks will be an immeasurably positive influence in your life.  and the more you do so, the easier it'll become.<br>  <br>  so, like, ok?|`|2104e3813eba0dcd918439d2b4da53a1aa	lol that funny that what happen to my girl friend she was shy to talk to me and i looked at her alot because i was think that she was the most beautiful girl on earth and then one day a friend of her started to talk to me and as we were talking she told me that she like me but was to shy to tell me will i was scared but then i want over and started to talk to her from there i called her and we stayed talking on the phone for about 8 hours none stop because I'm the type of guy that keep to myself and she did know anything about but because of that she asked me so many question trying to get to know me till i started to open up to her and from there we are thinking about getting married can i love her that much and i'm so the girl at school said the one of the three most hottest guys at school so girls asked me out left and right but yeah just get one of your friends to talk to the guy and see if he comes to you if he does will i leave the rest up to you|`|AA11703981	Make jokes with him. Kid around with him maybe even tease him a little. That always works for me. And I find that guys find that intriguing. Be nonchalant and be cool.|`|AA11841334	Tess, Tess, Tess, Tess, Tess! I am getting replays of October 6th. That date should ring a bell. Now, remember why that day was significant. Remembered? Good. Now think about a football game where we had to run concessions. Now think about putting ketchup on a hotdog. Does this bring back any memories? YOU SOUND LIKE ME!!!!! And you are most certainly NOT me! You have never been shy in all the years I've known you! I guess you must like this guy a lot. 'Cause flirting with President Kennedy was no problem! :) I'm just messing with you. <br>  <br>  If you just stare at him and don't say anything he will think you're weird. He'll wonder if you're a mute. :) So just go up to him, introduce yourself, and say "Hi. Um, I just recently moved here so I don't know my way around very well. Do you think you could show me where the (library, ice cream parlor, park) is?" <br>  <br>  If he's moving, Tess, you need to do this pronto! Tomorrow may be to late.......................................<br>  <br>  Oh, I'm going on an airplane ride tomorrow!!! You should know where I'm going. I'll try and call you.

5dd48df95bd68447ae1be5ff0417d737aa	Yes, <br>  <br>  The only reason we are not so truthful about that is because society is not kind to men who are too emotional, I mean you don't get a guy sitting around with his other guys can depressing that he will never find his soulmate, its something we do alone!|`|100186d350b78d2d6bd2d3f9f892beb7aa	most guys like a girl in the streets and a freak in the sheets.

No one knows him. He's a hermit.|`|8a34e42aefe1e0403394d1ef041cfe38aa	Yeah, wasn't he the bass player for Winger?
f7f6df38773eaf64700d987d72a0d20aaa	YES YES YES!!! I have been telling my sister in-law exactly that. You do not want to be the one to blame if in some way the marriage caused either one of you to not finish your education. I tell her to finish college and work on getting her career started before she considers marriage. If this upsets the other person involved then they have no respect for you and only wants this for themselves. If it is true love, It will wait for the right time.. Dont rush it!!!|`|AA11604641	Depends on the situation.  If getting married screws up student loans, medical insurance, or the like, I'd say wait until your last semester begins.  If you don't want to wait that long and can swing the financial upsets, go for it.|`|AA11721065	This is something I am dealing with. I am going to wait, till we are both done with college. We will have financial security and stability. Also it may depend on if you go to the same school. I have heard from ppl that is hard on you to be going through school, working and be newly married. The equivalent to 3 full time jobs. So I am not, but that is just me. Don't know if that helped or not.|`|AA11962345	yes I believe they should. College is tough enough without adding the stress of marriage.|`|AA12111208	The standard answer would be yes, but it really depends on how you are funding your education, if it's a free ride and you don't have to worry about work and all those hassles, then what's to keep you from getting married. if you are working then it might be best to wait, you don't need the distraction of planing a wedding and all the stress from work. it could affect your desire to complete your education. you may think your spouse has got your back and you don't need to finish.|`|AA11688662	well. if its ment to be then there is no need to rush it.if you wait then you know that you and he have the basic foundation for a strong relationship. and besides, you could afford a real wedding|`|7abe747ff0a08af3be845dff63f68885aa	Yes.|`|AA10701806	yea, thats probably the best thing to do.|`|AA12207629	yes, at least i would, and it also depends on how long u are going to college for, if ur going to college for over 5 years, u should get married now. if not, then wait, ull have time|`|ee43a6e8b8f24313ad60c1f0f6229dbdaa	Yes.  I am only 15, but i have seen all of my older brothers and sisters make big mistakes in thier lifetime.  One of them was getting married before they were done with college.  I love my sister and everything.  But she started working at Wendy's when she was 16 years old.  Now she is 31 and she is still working at Wendy's.  She was in college, but chose to get married.  she then got pregnent and dropped out of college.  So by working at wendy's she doesn't have alot of money and she isn't around people her age alot.   (and since she is now devorced with 3 kids) she has been useing bars to find guys to date.  Which i can tell you have been a HORRIBLE experience for her.  I am not saying that everything that happened to her will happen to you.  but i would suggest you wait.

Say that you think you guys could become really good friends. Make sure you say friends you dont want her to get the wrong idea.
AA11610005	Yes, it is hard to do. You have to have patience of steal. It gets hard as hell at times but if you truly love the guy any of his "baggage" is worth it. The kids aren't so much the main problem, IT IS THE EX WIFE that is the problem. Let me tell you this, too, as the kids get older it gets tougher. It may not be so bad for you if the mother of his child keeps her mouth shut, her opinions to herself, and doesn't throw the child into the mix of any tension between you and the dad and herself. If the mom/ex is mature, responsible and grown up the situation may not be so bad for you and your boyfriend. Just remember that even if the mom/ex is some kind of crazy psycho it is not the child's fault. Love the child and ignore the mom/ex. Good luck and God bless you.|`|AA12330638	its not hard to do...but i would not involve the child at first until you know you are gonna stick around...it makes the situation less confusing for the child...|`|21d09ca1e44fa83b984b49ad2e5aa013aa	In my opinion, dating someone with a child is as hard as a person makes it out to be.  For instance;  If you were the one with the child, would it be hard for you to date someone without a child?  If you like kids, it shouldn't be that hard.  The only catch to anything like this is that the parent has rules of his/her own for the child to follow and the child(ren), may feel threatenedby you.  They may think you are trying to take the parent away and that could bring a problem between you and your girlfriend/boyfriend.  Good luck and take care.|`|32d4e0fb7497ec45b9549916f283ae97aa	not if you only go around on the weekends he does not have her|`|AA11391200	Think of yourself as dating both of them.  Include his daughter in your social plans as often as possible.  Let your boyfriend decide when she should be left home with a babysitter.|`|cbb043740fe47c5bd03c629587dc053daa	I don't date women with children because I do not think that I'm mature enough to handle what could or what might happen.  I don't want to inconvience the woman in question so, no matter the situation, I do not date with women with kids.  Also, I think that children should come only after the storm(the first few major fights of a relationship).  So I would advise you to take my advice: Baby momma drama not only is annoying, it's very enduring on a relationship.  It can end great relationships on its own.
AA10583031	I have a feelings for a guy i dated over 6 years ago. We we're together for 2 years, then broke up, and never spoke the entire 6 years... well we found each other again. its great. Dont feel like your selfish at all|`|0f4cc4a82be8a270d5a5491f90a3d656aa	well its OKay to have feelings for some one but do you only want him back cause the guys you like don't like you that way and you thinks OK to go back to him?well if that the case then YES your being selfish,but if you seriously have feelings for him cause you love him then NO your being selfish but you cant expect him to feel the same way there are many fish in the sea lol|`|42343d29d332ca84f5404391f972530faa	I guess it's fine, who am I to say that it isn't? Just please make sure you love him for him and not the memories you've shared. Sometimes looking back at past bfs can trigger "feelings", but we only remember what we want to remember and erase the reasons why the relationship wasn't or didn't work. Selective amnesia. Be careful...|`|83f841d18a40e9b184306c2a1f9e2949aa	It depends if he's with someone. If he is then yes you're being selfish and you just need to move on but if not then go for it. All you can do is try and if he doesn't want you back then then don't try anymore.
AA11340885	Being that i am an older girl with a better personality and attitude (compared to looks)---i am a bit biased.  Really its not about looks or personality, it's about how this person makes you feel.  Everyone and everything has beauty----its where that beauty is that is the most important.  If i had my choice---it would be someone who is funny and could keep me positive and happy.

I don't know it seems like most people gainmore personality as they grow up so the younger girl might not have bloomed yet. Case by CAse basis really.
AA11112418	People that abuse children usually have something wrong with them mentally that make them attracted to children instead of adults. That will take a lot of studying and figuring out what causes this attraction. If you legalize child prostitution, then that problem could be solved, but since that would never happen,,,<br>  As for rape, rape is not about sex. Rape is about power and control. Yes, the person is "having sex" with their victim, but they are getting aroused by the power they are forcing on their victim much more than physical stimulation.|`|AA11965318	I agree with everything cosaxteacher said. I have personally had been abused as a child and raped as an adult. Neither of these have to do with prostitution. Child abuse is about the abuser being sick in the head. Rape is about power and control, NOT sex. So, legalizing prostitution would do nothing to help either situation, just allow married men to cheat on their wives legally.|`|AA11707323	The 3 have nothing to do with each other.

0615ba8b33c5bbb6989eab18419e0a6caa	I got married at 18 and I absolutely love it. It is probably the best decision I have ever made. It also just depends on the person in the relationship too though, you can't judge people by age. You have to be mature and ready for that lifelong commitment and all the bumps along the way.....nobody said it was easy.|`|AA11549317	Of course!!!!!!!!!!

As time went by and my friends were still out having fun, going places, meeting people etc. I really started to feel like I was missing something. It was like my wings were clipped before I even flew...(strange analogy but you get it) I divorced at 28 and boy did those wings grow back fast!!! I have never been happier. Of course I have remarried since then to the real man of my dreams and I look back at what I thought was love and realize it wasn't, not at all. So, I don't think anyone should get married at 18, there is too much living to do.|`|AA11784935	Yes.

You have to be horn*y in order for the orgasm to work, so you may want to incorporate goat weed or any good aphrodisiac (a sexual libido enhancer, NOT Viagra or "size pills") . The G-spot is on the top inside of the vagina. Curve your fingers up when fing*ring. For a libido enhancer, try <a href="http://www.directvideoanddvd.com/listcategory_toys.asp." rel="nofollow">http://www.directvideoanddvd.com/listcat...</a> Maybe pop in a porno.

68d970a94ff2c1ff8d1b0d1bfdc0fed0aa	Women get attached more easily because they are functioning on an emotional level in a relationship, whereas a man typically is interested in the physical. The physical for a woman, however, only results from an emotional tie... a reason sex is (USUALLY) more enjoyable when two people are in love than just a booty call. As for change... for a woman, if a man desires change it sends out a signal "you're not good enough... but another woman is." When you choose to be with a woman, you should let your intentions be known from the start that you are ONLY interested in dating around. If she gets involved thereafter, the heartache is her fault alone because you can always remind her where you stood from the beginning.|`|AA11136417	i dont get attatched too easily it takes time for anyone to get my trust, and a considerable amount of respect on their part for me to even look at a guy. the best advice i can give is for you to be honest about that with any chica you pursue, and make sure she feels the same so that if it dosnt work out you still have a friend, also be respectful and dont act ignorant, and you will know when it is serious when you start feeling jealous about her exploring her options, then that is the right time for you to ask for a committment. so good luck to you and hope you find the right fit, when you need it and remeber there is someone out there for everyone, so i think you are going about it the right way, dont let anyone change your mind until you are ready, i love it... by the way, even though i have found 2 men who have captured my heart, and now am having difficulties choosing between the two, it feels as if my heart and mind are at war, be careful dont let that happen to you, it is a terrible predictiment.|`|AA10686101	possibly because all you attract are brainless bimbos ya dam hoodratz<br>  <br>  wOrd
21980bdbf80346a7d4d61d47b98e9313aa	Perhaps you need to compromise. Each can move an equal driving distance if possible. Other things to consider are if you have custody or not and how often do you see your boys and how often her ex sees her daughter. I think it would be very wise for all parties involved (even the other parents) sit down and have a talk about a fair solution. You never know who is willing to compromise once everyone has met each other. If all else fails you could wait a few years until the children get older.<br>  <br>  I think that it is a good idea that you are discussing this now, before things get really complicated. Also something else to think about, how do you each get along with the other's kids? How do the kids feel about the situation? With this type of descision, everyone should have a say in the matter. Keep your head up and remain open and I am sure that a viable solution can be found.<br>  Blessings|`|147607adf55cb5f3a236aadc7f042230aa	Your kids come first dude!...If this woman doesn't want to leave her kids then why should you leave yours...something is wrong!|`|AA11473291	If you love her.

She's putting raising her child and what's best for him/her first -- which she should.  She's already raising a child of divorce -- at least allowing the child to have both parents working cooperatively is a very good thing -- not to mention trying to take the child away from that locale COULD result in another bitter court battle.<br>         You have the self-same reasons for not wanting to move -- because it would take you away from YOUR children.  Exact same situation.  If YOU aren't willing to do it -- in the exact same situation --  how can you expect or demand that she do it?   And unfortunately, I dont' see a clear solution to this one.  She has, in fact, told you that she would marry you BUT (conditional) this is where she lives -- period.  She's been open and honest and put her cards on the table -- and put the ball back in your court.  In this negotiation, she's just given you a deal breaker.  Next move is yours, and you have to decide - but her leaving her town is not on the table for negotiation.|`|cbe23107aefffa564fca8f6026e17372aa	yessssss
5d643e970b8a5e21d0288feffe91a1b3aa	My Ex rented an incredible Executive home on the beach.  It had winding spiral staircases that went up all four floors, a complete wall of glass facing the ocean, and balconies on each level with views that would take your breath away! We made love in every room, on every balcony, the pool, hottub, and of course the beach with the stars twinkling above, and the surf pounding with the rhythm of our bodies!!!  It was pure magic!!  Sadly, we could only afford one night, but I'll never ever forget how I felt for one beautiful day with this man.|`|AA11017730	In highschool I had a guy pick me up from work and he showed up with a teddy bear. Then when we got to his house he had hidden 2 dozen roses all over the house. He gave me the first one which had a love quote and a clue to the next one. After I found them all it lead me to the kitchen where he had the table set for use with my favorite desert and slow music playing. He then told me how much he loved me. We spent the entire night just talking and holding eachother with no interuptions.|`|92f64da9d9c71db4c1fe8ab68d874356aa	lick me all over|`|75f8ed5a8a1403bbafb2cb5ea2f6a21daa	I told my boyfriend that I felt like I wasn't important to him so he made me a card where he wrote a poem about how much he loved me.  He spent the whole day with me and he treated me like his everything.  Were still together and it has been almost four years.|`|9b0dfebc33fb97cafe6032b6118c039faa	The nicest thing a guy has ever done for me..two things in fact.<br>  <br>  Guy #1<br>  He knew I was going to the post office to mail him a present because he was in Iraq and I got him something. So he asked when I was going to leave and I told him here in a few (we were talking on IM) So when I leave I come back home a bit later and there is a message on my phone. Cutest message ever and he even goes..Uh...hi...umm..ash....umm..yeah..I... know you're uh..at the post office..but I just..umm.wanted to call and uh...yeah..you know..umm..say thanks..and that I really love you..,well I gotta go bye! I thought that was the sweetest freakin thing ever. And that was the first time he called me. I saved that thing for a while because I would listen to it whenever my day got bad because it would perk me up to hear his voice and how nervous he was to even make that call.<br>  <br>  Guy #2<br>  He calls me up one night and he knows I've had a bad day. So he sings my favorite song to m Iris by the Goo Goo Dolls. Now granted he can't sing like Johnny but he did try it and he made me cry cause that was the first time anyone had done that. He wanted to sing me another song but I said no because I thought one was enough (he really couldn't sing..but it was the thought that counted)|`|AA12115815	Well, I'm only 13, but there was this guy (we were both about 11), i went over to his house just to hang out, and he had a mega crush on me. I said something about me not being cute, but he said, and i quote "Your right, your not cute, your beautiful." it was SO sweet!|`|ee99cc0a6435a8f5ea8c553964d9471daa	when i was 15 my bf and i laid in his bed just cuddling together, until we fell fast asleep i awoke still wrapped in his arms and to see him kissing me on my nose while he was still asleep- he made feel warm and safe-when he woke up he made me the best steak i've ever had in my life! although we are not together i miss those days
86b930d5a00d8f51108cb1a160947d8daa	Girl plz, this is his way of realing you in his game.  I mean who knows...maybe he is da one.  but be very careful, just because you have alot in common and he does stuff for you doesn't mean anything.  Like I said, he might be doin dat so you can fall for him.  So take it slowly.  Anywaym if he was such a gentleman you shouldn't have paid for anything right?  When a favor is done you shouln't be ASKED to pay for stuff dat should come out of you.  BE CAREFUL!!!!!|`|2bab7047ef7c34f7d4027e5d8a7eff79aa	take at the pace you want. he sounds really nice. if you think there could be something from this thats great.|`|AA10976121	i think he likes you|`|AA10530406	That guy is truely special right there.

Good luck in you future relationship.|`|ba60dd0df93da088e2288387c7eb0296aa	you can see that when both of u between a crowd. but even if he is nice to every one and you like him you should make him now that directly or indirectly. for me he seems polite.<br>  But I worn you that he might be doing this because he wants you and will change after he gets you. so check it out
AA11124905	Maybe it means you are a 2 at 10pm and a 10 at 2 am.

Why?  do you want someone who is drunk before he calls you to like you?  I do not know your age but I bet if you value yourself then the man in your life will do the same thing.  I would tell this guy first of all you are not a baby doll and second don't call you drunk.  If he wants to get to know you and you like him tell him the only way is to stop drinking and only call when he is sober and has something to say.  If you like the situation then you need to find out why you are willing to settle for treatment like this.   When a man calls a woman drunk he is either looking for affection or no one else will put up with him in this situation.  Value  yourself more and simply tell him your expectations and hang up.  Good Luck|`|4b0141f06cf99b1ff4975ac438c965f6aa	it means he wants to get laid....AND I BET HE CALLS YOU LATE TO!!!!|`|71ef3d03e0de9114a1641d2ed67884c0aa	Maybe, but if he is calling you drunk, is he really worth it?|`|AA10867776	THAT HE THINKS YOU ARE CUTE.|`|AA11710616	Uhh it probably means he is a drunk.|`|e493da827b8bf613116ad527295d34f9aa	ur the booty call|`|e63aa7803505ae35c97453836d0d9f2aaa	sounds like hes after sex, or aint got courage to phone you when he is sober its hard to say, dont go to far into things with this guy until you know for sure what his motives are
AA10783218	just go for it...why spend your whole life wondering?|`|AA12021701	You need to talk to her about it. You cannot keep hanging out with her wondering what might have happened if you actually would have made a move. If you guys are truly that good of friends then your friendship will not be ruined if she does not like you back. Atleast if you find out that she doesn't like you back you can move on and if she does like you back then your all set. It is hard I know but you need to try and gather up the courage to tell her how you really feel about her otherwise you will live life wondering and later you might actually realize that she did like you. Either way you cannot have a truly amazing and honest friendship until you tell her.|`|afa506dfbb1215a4adbf70766aefbf37aa	go for it its . u only have one life to live.|`|62f2b1f78c68b2509ae26bfd11b5291baa	AWWWW !! you seem really sweet !!

Its a reflex! :D|`|AA12345990	if you have erection, then there is no more blood in yr brain and so no more questions|`|AA11630881	Due to our defect even if we are made in the image and likeness of God (in my belief) we are imperfect.

81e599772a73bd71e704574e8ce670a6aa	Remember that you asked.<br>  First of all, allow me to extend my condolences regarding the loss of your mother, I too lost mine when i was 14 yrs old. I do not personally know what you are going thru, but be assured that i understand what it is to lose a beloved one. This is how I would deal with the situation.  Im gonna simplify it for you.<br>  do not tell your dad about "girls" you like or that like you. It is not worth the trouble. remember you are just getting started in the girlfriend/boyfriend game. i am sure there will be a few girls who you will call g/f before you get out of jr high. unless you look like quazimoto, or have three eyes or two mouths , then you will have trouble , but  if not , then you will see, how girls come and go before you settle in a steady  relationship, (and that is not gonna happen yet, you are not ready for a formal steady relationship, and neither are the chicks you kick it with. dont get me wrong, im not saying you aren't capable of one, you are just not ready for one yet.<br>  and if you are so sure that you are not thinking about sex (which for a boy your age is almost impposible to believe, but since you mention your stronghold in christianity, then i wont argue that issue).  You said that your father trusts you and that you will be able to handle the peer preassure. but yet it seems to me that neither  does he trust you, given the fact that he got mad, nor you are a very strong christian as you think you might be. other wise your father would see that in you and there would not be any need for you to convince him.  concerning about the tips for not getting into sex with your g/f i will say this, follow the voice of your councience, and dont ignore the feelings of your heart. only then will you be able to walk on fire without getting burned. i hope i can send my message clear accros and remember ultimately. it is your decision, and what you just read, is only my opinion. GOD BLESS YOU AND WHAT EVER YOU DO BE SAFE AND BE AT PEACE.|`|bf096e562c05d1de307f8a8b9917d287aa	First of all, if you do decide to go out with her, would it matter to you if someone older would have to drive you to your dates? Personally, I found it embarassing to have parents and siblings driving my dates and I around. So that's one reason to wait a little while.<br>  Now, if she's your best friend, you'd probably being hanging out with her anyways. That means you would see her a lot and if you wanted to turn it into something more, then act romantically towards eachother. Flirting, cuddling, holding hands, kissing: none of these are having sex. You can look up lists on the internet such as "101 way to make love without having sex."<br>  And considering she's a good friend, she should already know how your father feels about sex. Besides, you basically said you're in "like" right? That's not love. There's a reason that "having sex" is so frequently refered to as "making love." Love is what it should be reserved for.<br>  I wasn't allowed to date until I could drive. I kind of liked that, both because it saved unfortunate embarassment when it came to dealing with my parents (my (boy)friends always seemed to have cooler parents) and it also was a ligitimate rejection line to say I wasn't allowed to go out if I didn't like the boy. None of that ever stopped me from going out with my friends (boys or girls). And whether or not I kissed them or flirted was entirely my business.|`|da66ea04f04f3ada3e5c95fabeda46daaa	I'm not sure if your ready to be  in a relationship or not everyone is different on what age they are mature enough to be responsible with the other sex. But I do know that the bible says " children obey your parents, for in the lord this is right", and your dad would only do what he thinks is right for you. He knows you better than anyone else. Also I really wouldnt date my best friend if I were you, I was friends with this guy for11 years and then we decided that we wanted more than a friendship and long story short I am in the process of a divorce from him we have an 18 month old son that he has seen 3 times and he just got out of jail because he was very abusive. So not only did I loose my husband because we we not ready at our age (19 & 21) but I also lost my very best friend. If you do decide to go for it avoid being with her alone to much try to stick to public places or hang out with friends, and dont do anything sexual until your ready to do everything because once the hormones are started its hard to stop them. Good luck I hope you make the right choice for you and everyone involved. And I'm really sorry about your mom.|`|eaa6981ef2be5e8d5cf16d73ba1131f0aa	if you're in 8th grade, of COURSE you're too young. DUH. but i'm a christian too and i'm a virgin YUPPPPPPP lol well you can show him that you're too young for sex and that you guys are not going to do any sexual stuff. parents try to prevent you from having a girlfriend or boyfriend because of having sex and they're worried about you. but for reals, you realize that well you are way too young to have sex so just show your dad that you can trust him.|`|f6effef72083da5e4137a421d54f9d5baa	Sweetheart, you sound like a responsible, sweet kid but your dad is just worried about you.

462b78f4311608808a5064e9afb784d7aa	This is a decision that you have to make based on what you want.  If you want a big wedding, or even a small but elaborate one, you should wait.  You don't want to get stressed out or anything.  In fact if the program tends to keep you very busy or stressed out - you should wait.<br>  <br>  But if you want a small/simple wedding, or you want to get married sooner you should go for it now.  Don't listen to people who say you're too young or that you're not ready - they don't know you!!  They are trying to help but they  are speaking from their own experience and yours is different.  If you are ready for marriage now, that is good enough reason.<br>  <br>  I don't think there is a general answer to questions like this.  It really is on a case by case basis.  Good luck with your decision.|`|5354196880e5999abb77f245e29b9ccfaa	finish it before u get married. why, u r just 22!!!<br>  life is beautiful and if he is the one for u then a couple months waiting wont hurt.<br>  getting married adds more commitments and responsibilities. unless u think u can handle them (logically thinking), u'd better save it for later.|`|a0d49e57c3c1527675256264698dad37aa	Wait, that way you can focus on the two of you more.

AA11304034	The day I got married:<br>  I had the bridesmaids spend the night before the wedding, we had donuts that morning and then we all split up to get our hair done. I had a two O'clock wedding so I met my hair dresser at the church (my sister-in-law) at 9:30. She did my hair then she did my sister's hair (which is why we went so early). The bridesmaids all showed up at 12:00. We hung around and talked I got my make-up done and by 1:00 we were dressed and were taking some pictures. Then we had the ceremony.<br>  <br>  I had my nails done the day before, and everybody brought all dresses, and shoes to the church the day before so nothing was forgotten.<br>  <br>  My man the day of the wedding went up to the reception site to make sure everything was intact. (also because his sister made our cake and she was a bridesmaids so he set that up for us, he is very creative and loves to help out and it kept him from being bored)<br>  <br>  Don't sress out, stay relaxed. The more relaxed you are the better the day will go. Everything really depends on the brides mood, at lease that's what my dad said. My wedding day I was really relaxed and just so excited, I kept in mind that something WILL go wrong so if it did I wouldn't have to worry about it , I just went with the flow. <br>  <br>  Need any other information send me an email at glitter3317@yahoo.com. I don't mind answering more questions because I know how stressful yet fun it can be, I also know how frustrating it is when you ask a question and it is not quite the answer you are needing because they read it a different way then what you mean.|`|34a841bf07c701361c44d8b201c092d8aa	It depends on what you have left to do - and how much planning you have done up to that point.  My wedding day - got up, hair done (on the phone with tux company - still not right - going to deliver correct items to church - haha, didn't happen), to hotel, makeup done - i was late for it.  Got dressed - photographer allready there, took pics of me dressing, down to reception - more pics.  Highway backed up, was ontime for wedding though.  Organist never showed - my aunt jumped into the spot and played the organ for the first time.  My one ring bearer was 8 yrs old, wearing a 33 long man's shirt (thanks to my mother in law you would never know (poor kid had straight pins all throught his shirt)).  My husbands phone goes off while we're at the alter, lost the photographer on the way to take pictures after ceremony.  Sister in law that was supposed to keep my daughter in her room got totally trashed and invited the reception to her room for the after party.  Never did get into the jacuzzi - went to bed at three, up at six to go to the bears convention, make up and hair still up!  <br>  <br>  My point - the whole thing could be up for grabs, but it was still one of my best days ever!  Relax, and let the cards fall where they may, it's your day and you just have to go with the flow, and hope for the best.  If you have a good attitude and say oh well alot you'll have a great, memorable time.  The little oops moments are what make your day something to talk about.  Just think if everything goes as planned - what would you have to laugh about?|`|9bb263d8c231c58368e8598b6b43ee4faa	Have fun! Relax...be Stressfree!!

The day will be fun but stressful.  Have you watched the Wedding Planner?  You will wake up, eat breakfast, go to the salon and get your hair, nails and make-up done.  Get this done with your bridesmaids, they will make you laugh and cry.  It will be a fun experience.  Get dressed either at the church in a dressing room or somewhere else like at home.  Have your wedding planner coordinate the rest.  You just need to worry about yourself, not the cake delivery and flower arrangements.<br>  <br>  Congratulations!|`|715c2fffea5d7930d431644b7c04d1d8aa	Everything should be done by that day.  All you have to do is get your hair and make up done, be relaxed all day and GET MARRIED!! :)|`|AA11079496	Get married? lol<br>  <br>  Nails should be done the day before with an "emergency" scheduled appointment the day of in case of a color change/breakage.<br>  <br>  Hair appointment, makeup if you feel it necessary.<br>  <br>  Other then that, you should have all of your ducks in a row so there is not much you need to do- this is why I suggest you pay the extra $10-$50 to have the flowers and cake delivered the day of so you do not have to worry about family destroying them (accidentally or otherwise) and you can blame the people who brought it. It just makes it SO much easier. When they bring it to the hall, all you have to do is direct where it's going and how you want them if need be.<br>  <br>  Have a radio/CD player and Cd's as back-up if the DJ falls through, have the alcohol delivered the day before and COUNT HOW MUCH YOU HAVE in case of breakage and/or theft. Also, keep your empties and have your bartender tally empties to keep track of what you need to pay for.|`|3845ec778cd9f56c64ca7e6f445d2f98aa	Have fun!

Didn't work out in the long run, but then again, it hasn't always worked out when I met people in real life either.  You meet the same people on-line that you would meet at the mall, so what's the dirfference?<br>  <br>  Just make sure that when you meet someone in person for the first time, that you meet them in a public place (so that they don't know where you live if you decide that this person is crazy). I haven't met any crazy people yet, but you never know.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|AA12306815	I think its doable

Also notice if he changes his ways, like if he has a trait that just between the both of you and then he stops it for a period of time. You should definitely ask him.<br>  <br>  Well thats how I show disinterest...its not that I want to, its just as if the "flame" is dying.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.|`|6a797af60861d50e48d5f9f3fce48a1caa	When you come home and that same girl is sitting on his face for the third day in a row you gotta start wondering, but when she doesn't greet back its certain there is something going on...|`|e3b3b4c839752ba8f5a6bd64c0759a74aa	Ask him.  If he says he's not interested, he's not interested.  If he is, he is.<br>  <br>  Us men are as plain as dirt.  There's no hidden signals like with women.  If he doesn't like you, he knows it already and will tell you if asked.|`|e494a23677997ede4937ccd074de3d37aa	He show that he is not intrested in you
AA12256785	I am a girl but even I get why he does this..It is because he uses you JUST sexually! Sorry sweetie but you deserve SOOOOOOOOO much better. Get away from him!!|`|AA11514977	Because when we treat you like crap, your insecure nature comes out and you'll do anything for our acceptance, including allowing us to get into your panties<br>  <br>  Yea guys!|`|AA10273189	Its a game both ex's play, he knows what to say that you lead him on to believe is acceptable...you even go all the way and then question is this forever, the i love you comment, when everything leading up to sex had very little to do with love or commitment...if your a friend with benefits accept it..if not then don't go there and allow yourself to recognize on what level your friendship can be.|`|AA10583031	maybe scared of commitment, or just wants a booty call??|`|AA11403313	Often women scare guys by telling them of their affection.  Guys like to keep the fantasies alive and facing realities destroys those thoughts. When a guy thinks a woman is putting strings on him his first reaction is to repel her attention.  He may enjoy her sharing her goodies with him but not be ready to commit.  Defense brings out the insults in guys. Sorry that's life. Pick someone ready for a relationship and you may have better luck.|`|AA11984652	any guy should be happy when he gets in love,should proceed not shut her out.he is a pig,I'm not,most r not|`|AA10187954	He probably just want you to fulfill the dreams which I'm assuming were sexual. Sounds like that's what he wants.
c5aaaa7bc0de5169e89cff41344a3c80aa	Its a waste of time unless you want someone who is toothless, fat, ugly and a lot older than you are.  You wouldn't believe some of the bow-wows I've met in person who had just awesome pictures posted.  The only problem was the picture was taken when they were 25 or younger.  Save yourself the time and energy - its not worth it.|`|AA10701806	no its not worth it!|`|469599c4582a235f65745dd6ce594a93aa	no u should try face to face relationships|`|4fe8d0507ac40bbe14e97f40be30a08caa	I think it is so hard, I tried, and people just were not what they said they were...........go out with friends and meet people
a5feccc3415f710950a8f9e86fbde6e2aa	yeah. they know that they got determination & courage & take initiative to get what they want, as opposed to being meek & shy. it throws dudes off when a chick asks them out, but there's still respect there|`|ecda794e799ac0924144fb56cfb9a42eaa	yes some times we get busy and don't notic those interested in us|`|0d8ced59212a7d77617d180ef03e1b32aa	In this day and age I would say so. Just be cool about it and don't seem needy.
e7204723b146cb0bb3ca4f87be0d6fefaa	i wouldn't worry about them. if they don't like you then oh well. as long as your partner loves you then is doesn't matter.|`|cbb302f78b0f1ee804cfa165a383f461aa	woooooooooooow that must suk for you sooner or later theyll come around just dont let it get to u that much parents are parents
37685ea1a29066b136ac272463372ae4aa	Absolutely not. You want the person to get to know "you" not some fictious person created from lies. Besides, more than likely, when they find you weren't telling the truth, they won't like you because of it.<br>  <br>  When I don't know what to say to someone, I ask a question to get the conversation rolling. If I know they play sports, "Hey, how was the game last night?"  "How did you do?", etc. I find that most people like to talk, especially about themselves.|`|0bbb9fbe12cd63d1d41eb9a4c041cb8daa	Think about it.  If you lie at first, then get to know them (and they you), the truth will come out.  Is that really what you want?   A relationship based on lies?|`|2dd41272165cec7a320767367f8840b6aa	first learn to spell before you start being a liar, your lies will catch up to you, says a lot about you. and no this isn't a good question because of anyone is smart then they won't believe what your wrote on you main page; profile area. you sound like a little girl, maybe you should consider going out and playing with your friends.|`|AA10701806	LOL... aren't you an immature little asshole! and you probably are 14, you sound like you are!|`|AA11882458	no, its starst wrong and will end up wrong.
AA11502071	Yes. It's called "Back Support" and he owes you 18 years worth of it. What ever country he lives in......contact the Bureau of Child Support and submit his social security number, address, name... and anything else you have on him. Even if he is retired, it doesn't matter. Whatever income he has...including income tax returns...will be garnished and paid to you. Even if your child is already grown. That's why it's called BACK Support. He is paying for what he owes you in the rear.|`|28d8fd14e52278e31f54fa296921aecdaa	Although this is a reference to a Canadian case, it is not without precedence. <br>  <br>  ----------------<br>  A unique trial in which a woman is suing her mother and father for<br>  abandonment of parental duty began Monday in B.C.

AA10182431	I'm assuming he is going to this dance...????  If not then ask him to...if he is then ask him to dance.  I think a good slow dance can quickly break down barriers when two people are unsure of each other and if there is a relationship developing.  Don't be afraid to kiss on his neck a little while dancing and see what happens.|`|b9a25e0d3e644235a89b321fd895e151aa	best way to find out if he feels this way is to ask him,<br>  <br>  if he replies he doesnt then tell him that is ok and remain his friend|`|6de7feae1d4de9be6486aabdb57072b9aa	yes i believe i can help you with this just have confudence in your self and striage up ask him out believe me it works out and if not you are sure atlest not to miss out on something great good luck|`|AA11405734	ask him to the dance|`|AA11610276	if hes going to the dance, then ask him out. he might like you (he prob does because of what u sed) or he could reject u and only like u as a friend. if he sez no, try to like some other guy or focus more on something else (like any work or something.) who knows? <br>  <br>  whenever i go 2 a dance, im gonna make sure my crush is coming and ask him out. do the same. (i no my crush will say yes cuz he likes me back ;))|`|AA11819536	he does understand the language that u speck right?? then why don't u tell him how u feel....u must b a lil teeny bob per..COMMUNICATE GIRL
AA11367792	sounds just like what happened to me this year with two of my friends...ones a guy and ones a girl. what you need to try to do is not get too involved [as hard as that sounds]. I got involved and man.....I wish I hadn't. If these two are mature enough they should sit down and try to work out there issues. It could be insecurity issues and jealously. Maybe your guy friend doesn't get a lot of girls or when he does someone else comes and takes her away from him. If they really don't like each other then it just won't work out between them...they shouldn't force something to happen if it won't come out for the better. And they shouldn't be blaming you because all your trying to do is help them. Possibly if you want to, sit with them, and talk about how YOU feel and how it's un fair of them to continuously blame you. If they are really your friends they would listen to you and if they don't then leave them a lone for a few days and see if they'll come back to you. About the family getting involved...I don't really know what to say about that. Good luck!|`|1f734a4754457a8c63644ecc145bff62aa	3 some!!!|`|AA11610276	thats not good......its ok to have only friends (u need some kind of family too tho) u dont need to have a gf or a wife or anything like that.

AA10064223	por qué dices VERNOS? ya te estás incluyendo?.<br>  Concuerdo con quien dijo que porque es más agradable que lo otro. Además es algo más "visible" y diferente en los hombres, así como hay nalgones hay desnalgados. Es como apreciar el busto o el trasero de las mujeres, aunque esto tiene un poco más de antecedentes primitivos y culturales.

Gals are more soft-hearted than Guys,so its not too easy to give up on a relationship. If your guy is a person who listens to you,he'll b there for you always. An eg: You met a guy,he will sms n call you for 3 weeks,then later everything is damn boring n u will feel worried about him. When you yourself call him,he sees your number,he won't even take up your call. So understanding guys is very easy. So,don't worry.

If she wanted to be true she wouldn't still be seeing the other guy AT ALL. Make your life the way you want it, and keep the people who bring you down out of it. Give yourself and your son all the love and attention you both deserve to be happy well adjusted people.|`|b621faedf42d72a5c7ed54b94d7879e0aa	It is pretty obvious that she is not willing to make a change for you are her son. I would be afraid she would bring something home from these men( like a sexual disease).  You are a better person than that and deserve to have a wife that is good to you as you are to her.  And your son deserves to have a mother that is at home with him instead of off with everything that is offering it to her. Get out and get full custody of your son. Get into church and find a good woman that will be there for you both. They are out there. I'm not saying that only good women go to church, but God can help you and your son through these hard times if you let him. You and your son deserve to have a happy life, that includes a good wife and mother. It sounds to me like you have given her enough chances to straighten up.  You have to move on and do what is best for you and your child. God Bless You, and good luck.|`|42df1ee43205e64e82376f160b4b42dbaa	It sounds to me like you need to dump your "wife".

You know that she wont be there and in time, it wont get better it will get worse. I've been married for 11 and unhappy for the last 2. My guy does the same thing. I know what has to be done but there's alot to leave after so many years of your life.
df7d9c71d0e64ebc9642d34cd776c726aa	Um, he sounds like he may be normal to me.  He will have better conversations after sex to, expecially if he's not tired beforehand.<br>  <br>  Hopefully, he can talk to you for a while before he needs sex though.  But, I think being intimate with your wife in conversation is an obvious aphrodisiac.  And if your fanny is hanging out of your PJ, what do you expect?<br>  <br>  Most men could use sex 2-3 times/day in there twenties.  Bet he could do 4-5 actually.<br>  <br>  You could tell him to do it himself...he shouldn't be so pushy as to force you obviously though.  Tell him that if he really loves you he'll lay off a little, try and initiate once a day or something.|`|03c3881fd24bfb93aa59a952408c38d7aa	You both need to seek counseling.

"love honor and cherish" means to put someone else ahead of yourself.<br>   <br>  you have been doing this by trying to keep up with his sexual appetite, but he is failing miserably by trying to badger you into more sex than you want, need or are truly willing to give. He could stifle the urge every once in a while for your sake. It can't be healthy for your body to take on that much action, or healthy for him to have his every wish granted like a spoiled child. <br>  insist on seeing a marriage counselor or a doctor. if theres performance enhancing drugs like viagra, there should be something out there for the opposite problem.|`|AA11107497	Start him on Prozac.

Seek professional help or else he is going to try to get it elsewhere.|`|AA12319096	maybe because you don't enjoy it? if he can see that you love him and enjoy being intimate with him, then he might slow down a bit. i don't think he's a maniac. he simply loves you and being physical with you is one way of showing it. i know some guys who think that when you need their reassurance or if you feel a bit insecure, they go and make love to you, hoping that it settles the score and that you feel loved. you are lucky because he can't get enough of you. i know a lot of women who would give anything to have their own man initiate sex once in a while. that means you're irresistible and that he's simply insatiable!if he says you need to please him, find out what his fantasy is and act it out  only if you feel comfortable with it. this will satisfy him! and if you get your fair share of satisfaction, show your appreciation. this will boost his ego & self-esteem that he's got what it takes to make you happy. it is a great feeling to be desired especially by a loving husband.|`|bb5263747404aebc36fa432d3bf765e4aa	As  a man...try having it with him you obviously turn him on...would you rather him go "elsewhere"?? to fulfill his appetite???|`|c5eac7a63cfa2366c79f3f92ec3c4165aa	My b/f is like that and I just don't give in to him and tell him why would he want to have sex with someone who's not in the mood or if he still wants it I say "ok lets ok but make it quick and hurry up get it done and over with" that turns him right off lol

AA12124130	The common idea is that you do not be around them or talk to them but chances are that this may be impossible to do. If you show outward hostility or dislike for someone, it will only add to the tension of the office and could cause problems down the line.<br>  <br>  Even though it may make your blood boil and your skin crawl, just be nice to the person. It takes no extra time or energy to be nice than it does to be surly. You don't have to spend time with this person but by being friendly, you can shield your dislike with a smile. Remember, what you are doing is being watched by others and if you show consistent animosity, they might start to think that YOU are the problem and not the other person.<br>  <br>  Fake it till you make it!|`|AA11599430	avoid  him or her at ALL COSTS|`|AA12073561	That's a VERY difficult situation.   Having no information -- basically, you avoid dealing with them as much as possible.  If you can't do that, then you try to find a way to get things to "work" as well as possible.   If you can't do that -- you get transferred or find a new job elsewhere.

db6cfade2f67161d4af45d4f0505b7d9aa	I am a florist, and while it is an old-fashioned custom to carry the prayer book or bible with a small spray on top, I have done it a few times in the last couple years for brides, so it's certainly not strange.  Usually the bride brings in a book that belongs to a close relative or ancestor. We all agree in my shop that it is a very sweet and dainty choice, as well as being sentimental. Any professional florist near you will be able to help you with this.|`|AA11286495	it sounds cool, but what's a blusher?|`|462b78f4311608808a5064e9afb784d7aa	I think the look is a little old fashioned but in a good way.  Not necessarily "dated" - I think it will look really nice and it seems like a trend that is coming back into style.  You should go ahead and do what you want, and I think that when people see you on that day the last thing they will be thinking is that it is old fashioned.|`|AA11446902	I don't see why not.

You both should just chill for a while before getting into another relationship, rebound relationships never work out.|`|462b78f4311608808a5064e9afb784d7aa	It sounds like this guy is sending mixed signals but his message is pretty clear.  He wants to keep you close enough so that he can rely on you to be there for him, but at a far enough distance that he doesn't have to be there for you.  Which is just an awful position for him to put you in.<br>  <br>  It sounds like regardless of what he will say in the future he is just not ready to be in a relationship.  He might like you enough to want to be your boyfriend but that really doesn't mean that he's ready yet.  If you think he's worth it I would say you should definitely stick around and just be his friend!  But if not, you should move on and find someone who isn't going to flip flop so much about whether or not they want to be with you.
AA11307530	i dated a girl like that, hangs on every word their parents say, they dont make good partners.........i would tell his parents to grow up and let their son make their own descision's, how old are you guys?<br>  <br>  <br>  edit:wow, if he is 18 he needs to grow up and stop being a mommas boy, he needs to make his own choices and see people the way he sees them not the way his parents see them.|`|f4fe5e505f214797d0eaf4c992e9116caa	WELL HANG IN THERE!!!!

Does he still live with them?  Depend on them financially?  Because if so, he might have a hard time getting them to back off.<br>  <br>  But he should probably sit down with them and tell him that they aren't actually doing him any good.  They might think they are helping him but in reality they are just hurting him by treating you poorly.  He can tell them about his feelings for you and yours for him, and that he would really like them to leave you alone.<br>  <br>  If you talk to them I think they will turn it around and use it as ammunition against you.  Good luck.
AA12286321	You will know.|`|AA10381966	no one will tell u this. but when u'll find someone so, u'll feel it from ur heart inside.|`|9b2c9fbacf1de45417983e585eadccbbaa	You have to work it up, e.g understanding, tolerance, care ,concern;etc. Nobody can tell you, this sort of relationship is between the two of you.

If you start thinking that their happiness is more important than your own, or that you would do anything for them, those kinds of feelings are a good indication.  If you are happier with them even when you're fighting than you've ever been without them.<br>  <br>  As for something like compatability, only time will really tell.  When you have been with someone for awhile and the rush that you felt with them has turned into a very comfortable thing (the best is when you still get that little rush, but you're never nervous about it and you are almost used to it)...then you know that you've found someone that is a great match.<br>  <br>  When you say "perfect" though, I think that is something that you can't describe.  You just feel it.

462b78f4311608808a5064e9afb784d7aa	I think that your friends should definitely be able to be in a room with each other without ruining it for you - but just in case, I would say that it might be a good idea to talk to one or two people that you trust the most.  Say that you're worried that people won't get along at your shower and ask them to be extra friendly to your other friends.<br>  <br>  I mean if you at least have a couple of people making the effort, I think that the others will pick up on it.  If you're not worried about fighting/bickering but more worried that they just will not talk to each other, check with the person who is throwing your bridal shower to make sure that she's planning games and activities that won't divide one group against the other.<br>  <br>  But when all is said and done, I really think that your friends will make the effort on your behalf.  I can't imagine that you would think of these people as friends if they really were callous enough to ruin your shower.  So plan for the worst but I hope that you don't stress out too much about it!  Good luck!|`|b3d92da0b0895720875d7588327ac17baa	All you have to do is don't let them talk to each other and try to avoid them meeting.|`|c2b0c54ac5bc43be413eb1675d56c4ffaa	They will just have to deal with it.  This is your special day, and if they can't keep their issues with each other under wraps for a couple hours than you should consider finding some new friends.  It's not fair of them to stir trouble at your shower, you're under enough stress as it is!|`|d15523b6f2eb977e0485a8956eed4c73aa	depending on how formal your shower is, you could have place cards and seat them separately.  they need to realize the shower is about you and celebrating your upcoming wedding and if they don't like each other, they needn't socialize together.|`|82b07e4444a5e32b246811ed58a3b34caa	Consider having two separate showers.  It is a shame that adult women cannot get along for the sake of their friend, but hey, you don't want a ruined shower.  Think further down the line...what will you do about the two factions at the wedding?|`|AA12040807	Its really not about them-for once, its about you. They should put aside their differences for your sake, and grow up! If they can't do that, then maybe they should just get together amongst themselves and do something nice-like a gift card to where your registered, for the things you didn't get at the actual "shower". Good luck!|`|e218a235ade1b2eec9bdb20af21020a0aa	You should invite everyone you want. They will need to choose to honor you with their presence, or give a gift and not show up. You will see who really cares enough to put differences aside for you. You enjoy your day, and dont let their problems be yours. You have enough to worry about planning the wedding.|`|AA11618088	You *could* have fun with it.  Post signs outside that say "No Work Zone".  Create topic sentences that they have to talk about with another person, and then put them in a punch bowl  and when they walk in, they have to draw one.  On the back, write the rule - no work talk.  <br>  <br>  Sentences like "So, I have/haven't seen Pirates of the Carribean yet - Did you like it?" or "Did you see any of the World Cup? Do you like soccer?"  or "What do you think of those new Smart Cars?" No politics, no religion, no touchy subjects (fishing/hunting/animals, hurricane katrina, work subjects, healthcare, war, etc)<br>  <br>  Anytime you hear talk go back to work, grab the bowl and make them pick a new topic.  They may find fun in the humour of the situation, and should know better than to be mean to each other.|`|43267a8ca0970de6d02aaaa047f04c51aa	Look at it this way. Its a way of weeding out the good from the bad. If they can't be civilized to each other at your shower, then they aren't real friends to you.

5047f4f12fe30dad446aab03b2d0771aaa	First of all, you can never coerce another person to like you. If you sincerely like the guy, then i suggest that you talk to him. All is fair in love and war. So, it wouldn't hurt to get some info on your guy friend before you talk to him. get in touch with some of his friends and try to get a picture of what he's really like. Please remember, you should always be yourself. Do not try to reinvent yourself to become someone that you are not just to look attractive to him.<br>  I can tell you with 100% confidence that if you take it slow, you will stand a better chance at success. Get to know the guy better and then take it step by step. If you rush things then you'll risk chasing him away. Love works both ways. So he'll have to like you too.<br>  <br>  Good things always come to those who wait. Keep an open mind, always. Promise yourself that if this does not work out, that you'll not beat yourself up over it. <br>  <br>  All the best..|`|05a262341142283ecd28ab26b76afa0baa	Go and talk to him  if both of you made for each other then surely something happens between both of you.And be natural and talk him as you talk to others.|`|18dbfb9f3411bcd4fbcae8bd4b43d55faa	AS Bonnie Raitt says, "You can't make a heart do something it won't"|`|2223cabeda908cf3f0c77293a3ae1359aa	You can't make someone love You!<br>  <br>  R u sure u love him, i think not if you think you can make someone love you.<br>  <br>  Infatuation is the word you are looking at.<br>  <br>  And I think your ? is how can you attract someones attention.<br>  That answer comes with what kind of person you are or want to be.

I saw no reason not to give in to my righteous indignation at her abhorrent actions and make her miserable in return, so I did so.<br>  <br>  After all of this I paid my sister to beat her up.<br>  <br>  The world saw justice that day, her new boyfriend saw reason- (after seeing the pictures as proof of what I told him) and now nobody in the area will have anything to do with her.<br>  <br>  She got no more than she deserved.|`|AA11299527	Wow, well I told my ex wife's new fiance why we didn't work out.

You are very young and marriage is very serious and difficult.  Its hard to go to school and keep a marriage together.  My advice is to get yourself through school first and if they two of you are still together then get married.  Maturity comes with being able to prioritize your life, and school should be number one.|`|462b78f4311608808a5064e9afb784d7aa	You should know that your grandmother is trying to help you.  It might feel like she's attacking you and your choices but she really is just looking out for your happiness in the best way she knows how.  That being said, you should sit her down and listen to everything she has to say.<br>  <br>  If your marriage is the real thing...you'll be able to talk to her about it.  If she thinks you're not ready, you'll be able to explain to her why you are.  If she thinks your fiance is awful, you'll know what to say to her about how wonderful they are.  Just speak with her over it and I'm sure that with time she'll see that you're happier doing things your way.<br>  <br>  But a word of warning, you never know if she could be right.  So keep an open mind.  Really listen to what she says and take it to heart.|`|4fce567ac5bbb3d37685f48281d89f6daa	SHE SHOULD BE WORRIED ABOUT YOUR SPELLING DID THEY TEACH YOU THAT IN UNIVERSITY|`|aeb798ecbbe107973799d1a8429e0f99aa	Well I would agree with your grandma.

Also, just remember reality. We always want the fairytale relationship, but in reality it isn't what we think it is. If your feelings are that strong then get out of the marriage before something happens between you and your past.  I just recently knew a girl that did the same thing and her husband found out and she too had a young child and the husband ended up with legal custody of the child. Don't mess up.|`|AA11020054	it is a serious matter that I think it mustn't be dealt with in a brief.<br>  would you like to talk ??|`|AA12073561	You're just in a rut and looking for some excitement.  You can't really revisit the past, AND you've created a family now and made a committment to that.  Are you willing to face the consequences?  That lack of spark will happen with anyone over time -- it's just the way things are.  You can renew it if you both want to -- but if you let a fantasy interfere, you're setting yourself (and your family) up for a big, nasty fall!!!

AA11299941	Does the why really matter? Does it change anything? Nope it doesn't, so its really irrelevant. People get so hung up on the why and there is really no point to it, whats done is done and knowing why doesn't change a thing. REALLY think about this, imagine that you know the why, then what? Then what you need to do is put this away and move ahead with your life, which is the same thing you need to do without knowing the why. Yes marriage is supposed to be forever, but very often isn't. If you dwell on what happened and what is lost you will never move ahead with your life, you will be stuck there. Obviously she wasn't who you thought she was and she wasn't who you wanted her to be. That has nothing to do with you or who you are really, thats all about her. Now, make a decision to accept what has happened, that doesn't mean you have to like it but it is reality so you have no choice but to accept it. That was yesterday, today is today. You wasted enough time on her don't you think? No more thinking about that, time to think about what you want tomorrow to be not what you hoped yesterday would be. Thats a colossal waste of time and energy isn't it? Learn the lessons there are to be learned, like perhaps seeing people for what they really are and not seeing them based on what you wish they were and get on with your life.|`|0d9426e08851b8720975c4c1a04c5d1baa	she needs help!!!!!!!|`|209f8877a51c5be408d460a47ee72ed1aa	some peeps have no soul thats why they are like that.her mom sounds like my mom.wash your hands and think god you dont have to put up with her mom much longer.its hard to move on.but youll feel beeter when you do.it worked for your her didnt it?|`|AA10217500	I think that age is supposed to bring about maturity but in some cases age just seems to be a number for some.  Suffice it to be so, you cannot continue to beat yourself up trying to figure out what her reasons were.  Only she and god know the reason or the motivating factors that led her to go outside of her marriage.  People have different perceptions of what marriage is supposed to be and not everyone can articulate what they feel.  <br>  Abuse isn't easy to live through, but to say that perhaps that's a reason for her behaviour is more of an excuse than a reason to me.  You seem to be a very loving and supportive husband and I don't think that if she had come to you expressing her frustrations within the marriage that her concerns would have fallen on deaf ears.  Always remember that people cheat because they want to, the opportunity presents itself and caution goes right out the window.  The key in moving foward is to look your best, and be the very best that you can be, and know that life is a circle and what goes around certainly comes around.  I do hope that I have been of some help not to mention comfort.
AA12338340	Tell her how you feel about her and that if she cant trust you then it would be best if the both of you went separate ways. Be nice about it, take her on a really nice date and just spill your heart to her. Then give the ultimatum "baby if you cant learn to respect my friends and my time away from you, then you will never trust me, and if the relationship goes any farther its just gonna be a waste of time, so you have an option, either chill out or lose me forever".

You know, still long but neatly cut too. I think that while it is important to maintain authority over such young children, it is wise to let them change their body like that if they wish (but no peircings or tattoos!). If you deny them that priveledge, you are setting yourself up for an even more rebellious child when he's a teenager. <br>  <br>  My parents gave me a little leeway when I was younger, and as a result I got to avoid that teenage pot-smoking parent hating phase. That way children aren't itching for a chance to defy their parents, since they see that you tolerate their individuality within reason.|`|25f9d6777b502c499e5ab9707ca12926aa	I think even at this young age children need to feel at least a small sense of independence.

Just don't let his get carried away, like tell him he has to wash it and brush it, keep it neat or something of that nature.Your ex-mother-in-law sounds like a prude and it sounds like the ex-husband is just following in her footsteps while the new girlfriend just agrees and does as he says...I hope I'm not being too forward, but this is just as much your son as it is his and it should be between you 2, the mother and girlfriend need to be left out of it.|`|AA12257726	okay I'm 15 and my mom started letting me pick out all my hair cut about 7 and it just a simple decision on him it gives him a little freedom..........and he'll get tired of it being long and want to change it soon anyways.|`|d3a416eedae9e1e192231e8c5789b272aa	it is his hair let him do what he wants with it so tell the ex to let him do his thing with it|`|ba51bc486d49737ffb37375fd8cc9c8aaa	I think it is gross when little boys have long hair and someone needs to take him to get it cut.|`|031bac198bf981ecc8c5536df571f095aa	He's only 8 and your his mom, it's up to you.|`|1cf66048c152bdfdc71bcda7ec34425daa	I am with ya completely on letting the child having a chance to express himself with something as simple as a hairstyle - it is not permanent and allows a child to show individuality in a safe way.  My 7 yr old has always wanted brush cuts because he did not like to brush his hair.  About two months ago he told me he wanted to grow it out  so he could get it long enough to cut it into a mohawk or liberty spikes.  I hate how it looks shaggy right now but I keep my mouth closed and I will let him try this now - hopefully it is short lived!|`|3fbc09a4f95e4122e563714d654a599eaa	My stepson is 15 he grew his hair out and it looked hidious it was in his eyes he would put a hood over his head he looked like the grim reaper.  I bugged him and bugged him to cut his hair.  His real mom didn't care she let him grow it long it was past his shoulders about 3 inches.  My husband threatened him to go get a hair cut but was afraid he would not want to come over (which I thought was ridiculous.  My stepson got into trouble at school and his mom finally had him cut his hair and he looks so much better you can see his cute little eyes.|`|AA10583031	i think he is old enough to make his own decision on the type of hair cut he wants. Its not like he wants to dye it some funky color or anything. I think you all need to sit down and talk about this, before it gets out of hand. Sit down with your ex and his girlfriend, and who ever is having a problem with it, and explain it... sit down, even with your son there, and come to a happy medium. <br>  <br>  Good luck and best wishes|`|AA12278224	your the mother and you have cusdity of him and its your call and if ex and his gal do anything as far as cutting his hair you could take them to court and he could lose his visataion rights or only have supervised visitaions , if you feel your son can have long hair do it|`|597bc96e3febd92037a43a1ea2788cdeaa	Let him express himself!  My son just turned 9, and his dad took him to get his ear pierced.  So what??  Kids need to be able to express their individuality too.  My son likes the John Cena haircut, but even if he didn't, TOUCHING the ears is not too long or odd.  Let him fit in or stand out a bit.  And it's not up his grandmother.  Set some boundaries, and give him choices, and enjoy his individuality.  If he gets teased about his "long" hair...you can bet he'll be asking for a cut.  Pick your battles...believe me, hair is not the big battle!|`|5db1ecdba3d6ae84acaaa775a2f8b44daa	If he is willing to wash and brush it, then let him grow it out long.

Screw what the ex's gf thinks it's not her kid it's yours. Personally my son is into short hair however we have went though phases where it has been many different colors i just buy the wash out stuff and let him have at it there are so many things wrong with kids these days that small issues shouldn't matter to anyone and after all even at age 9 he has some rights and i honestly feel unless its something you just can not tolerate let him have the choice after all he is the one that has to live with it... Good Luck|`|f72db24181e854a516f2e8ed2ae7dc6faa	It's should be his own choice what length he wishes to grow his hair. Personally i don't think he's too young to make that kind of decision, if he wants his hair long, then let him have his hair long. It's probably only a phase he's going through, before you know it he'll be wanting something else.|`|f7ace519ab6dff95fc3879b040e8972eaa	the harder you push.. the more he will want to do it ...its only hair let him have it the way he wants,because you can be stricter on things that are more important

AA10938489	The ultimate aim of a girl falling in love with a man is to dominate his mind. Once a girl dominates a man's mind she feels safe and secure with him. An atheist's mind is not dominated by even gods, so a girl can not dominate an atheist's mind. Thus, if no god could dominate an atheist, and neither could she, this man would not be safe and a girl would not feel secure so she would avoid him. Again, an atheist represents a demolisher of gods' temples in people's minds, does any believer girl accept a temple-demolisher as a husband?<br>  However, if a girl's mind is free, the thing which may be very dear, she may well like an atheist.|`|0d8ced59212a7d77617d180ef03e1b32aa	Depends on the girl.|`|AA10965146	I WOULD NEVER DATE SOMEONE WHO DID NOT BELIEVE IN GOD!<br>  YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT KIND OF BELIEFS HE MAY HAVE LATER ON SUCH AS DEVIL WORSHIPING AND THE LIKE|`|AA12246034	I wouldnt like an atheist man.

af4215f6c33cd73b44995e8a52fc349caa	I kind of know how you feel. My first year of high school, I had to start a new school because we had just moved to a new town. I did not know anyone at all! I hadn't been so nervous in my life! I didn't even know how to get into the school (like which doors to use)! It wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. The thing I worried about the most was "Where am I going to sit at lunch time"? I was so worried about having to eat by myself and everyone staring at me! But, I actually made a friend at lunch time. She was new too. We are still friends to this day. Just think your not the only new person at the school. Just look around for people who are new too. You can usually tell because they'll just be by themselves too. Try to make friends with the other new people, they'll appreciate it too because they'll be as nervous as you. Just try not to get in with the bad crowd just because you want to make friends. It's not worth it! There can actually be good that comes out of this too. These people don't know you, so if you ever made any mistakes before, you can start over fresh this year! Good luck, and I wish you the best of luck!|`|8e1f140936dd7a827f6f2be48b9a9545aa	Don't be nervous, I'm sure that your good personality will make you lot's of friends in no time at all.|`|5d643e970b8a5e21d0288feffe91a1b3aa	It will be okay--really!!!!!<br>   My daughter got held back too last year, and she was just as worried as you are now.

Initially it may be for seconds only, which you can increase as her liking increases or you can say disliking decreases.|`|5d643e970b8a5e21d0288feffe91a1b3aa	I don't think that it's really a matter of liking or disliking the BJ--as much as seeing the joy it brings your Man!!!

AA11103974	Once a month only? <br>  I suggest that you are be a little bit more sexual  agressive *outside* the bedroom, by which I mean that you have to seek more physical contact with him, dress a little bit more sexy and talk about sex. And once in a while just take him by the hand to your bedroom and start undressing. <br>  <br>  Other ideas: prepare a romantic dinner; ask him to massage your back and shoulders or rub your feet; suggest watching a porno movie; suggest a little role play like master/slave, doctor/nurse; ask him about his fantasies and tell him about yours.<br>  <br>  He will get the idea... but you have to work for it, as your partner seems to be happy enough with the present situation.|`|0d8ced59212a7d77617d180ef03e1b32aa	When you're starting to get into it tell him you want to try something you read in Cosmo or whatever and then make the change without giving him chance to ask why. I'm sure he'll be too busy to try to stop and ask questions. This is for basic changes only though, nothing too freaky. Like for instance if you guys only do missionary, try climbing on top of him for a change etc. To get him to do it more often try flirting with him more. Be a little aggressive if that's what he likes. Hope this helps.|`|162dc3d1efb2c3152b0250003d8f8d48aa	dump him and get a hot guy like me or something|`|AA11382241	BEARDED LADY HERE!!!

Second, turn it into a hobby.  Third, get paid for it by turning it into a job.  Then, you'll kill two birds with one stone.  You won't feel bored, and you'll make some money.  Example:  What you love:  children...  hobby:  voluntarily rocking babies in a hospital nursery... job:  working in your local daycare center.  This will keep you from being bored, help you earn some money, and keep your mind off your ex-boyfriend, all at the same time!|`|56b6a3f6bd1d9e3b17d93ed00798915faa	I don't think anybody can help you but you yourself.

I know you may have seen one or are seeing one, but this seems like a major transition.  Pharmacuticals may really be able to help you drop your anxiety a bit, or calm down.  Sometimes, you just have to admit you have problem, and that you aren't tough enough to do without the help that is available.<br>  <br>  Also, I think it is common to feel threatened when a relationship gets very close.  <br>  <br>  I have not had this issue.  But according to tests I am a little crazy, so I've read a lot of crap...

You don't need to go anywhere or do anything, a child that age just wants someone to play with.  Ideally if you do go somewhere if should be a place where they can express themselves and tell you things, so that would include the beach, but exclude the movies.  Save them for later.|`|501c54ad299f1752af324548310e3323aa	How old are you?  Why have you never met her? Is she newly adopted or have you just entered her life after an absence since her birth?  If you've been absent and she has a family she's still with, you should only be seeing her when she's brought by and cared for by people she knows.   You are a stranger.  <br>  <br>  If you've adoped her, or if you are just new to her life, when you hang out with her and these other people, you see what she likes,  involve yourself, and ask questions from there.  4 year olds are NOT going to give you most info about themselves verbally.  It will be from play and by observing her and her reactions to you.  You should have complete and utter respect for her feelings.  Let her lead the way, set the pace.  She owes you nothing.  Your feelings are really not imporant.  She is not there to please you.  <br>  <br>  You must read books about child development if you aren't extensively familiar with the topic.  The Irreducible Needs of Children is wonderful, but a scholarly read.

The only thing she wants is for him to call her. Trust me, just being there and showing effort means more than you know right now. Show her genuine affection, and pay attention to her when she's talking. Answer her questions, and ask her some too. Your conversations with her mean more than anything you could do with her or buy for her. Tell her that you love her, and mean it. Back up your words with actions, and she will respond. She will be happy to get to know you, if you just stay focused on her.

So if your decision to draw the line has taken into consideration both the aspects then you can take the call.

Don't buy into the cookie cutter vision of marriage that everyone says you're supposed to have.  I'd be scared too, if that kind of drudgery was all I had to look forward to.  Instead, just let your relationship be whatever it is meant to be.  Au naturel.  If it eventually evolves into something that approaches the socially accepted definition of marriage, then make your Mom happy and go ahead and get hitched.  But just don't do anything because you HAVE to.  You should only get married if it's the only way left to express how much you love one another.|`|AA10112869	just be upfront and ask him to marry you, ask him to take his time to answer you back but be honest, you wont be sorry and take a bold step accordingly...

AA12260728	You just learn to keep it to yourself. I had a hard time with this one as well. Basically, you just ask yourself how much it really matters. Think about what you say and how much it will really effect your bf if he does it anyway. Myself, I tied a rubber band around my wrist and snapped it when I got close to telling someone what to do. After a while, I learned when it was pertinent for me to chime in and when it wasn't.

Hard to tell, since he won't answer emails, SMS,phone calls, etc. even though our relationshp was coming along fine until his ex showed up...mmmm.  And yes, its been nearly 2wks of daily tears & frustration on my part because I have no closure and had no chance to tell him how much he has hurt me... god, I'm patheitic...  Its the frustration I find the most unbearable as it does for you too by the sounds of it.  To have your love not returned seems no unjust.  Such is life.  How am I dealing with things on a day to day level.  Frankly, I'm not and I can sympathise with you whole heartedly.  I know in time, my heart will heal but the pain is something I will not forget.  I walked out of my family home, with my 2yr old son and only the clothes on my back & a sprained ankle, away from an abusive relationship, to be with another man who gave me the strength & belief in myself to leave in the first place. Then I think, What goes around comes around .... and it certainly has for me.  I go to sleep at night thinking of my  man & he's the first thing on my mind when I wake from a fitful night's sleep. Can't eat, can't sleep can barely function as a mother and feel like I'm letting my son down.|`|AA10583031	if you know where they are, then find them, and tell them how you feel... if you dont know where they are, find them by any means possible, and then tell them how you feel|`|c4eecdf695bb2019d3043e6ec3142233aa	DONT YOU EVEN DARE REMIND ME <br>  it hurts so much you know..

I'm not a skinny girl but I'm not fat either and I know that I'll keep it real when I meet up with someone through myspace (which I wont). But I think that the girl that your friend tried to hook up with probably had low self-esteem. That's why she pulled a fast one on your friend. Its wrong I know, but face it the Internet is filled with liars and you both should be careful meeting up with people. I hope this helped a little bit.

411fb0527f0e69f899eb074bf65243ffaa	You sound like a sweet person that always puts the needs of others before your own.  You are a calm and serene person, taking things one day at a time, always with a smile on your face even when things are hard.  People are jealous of you because of this... you have the type of inner strength that many envy.  The people around you, even the people you love the most, only see what you show them.   Even when you struggle, you struggle gracefully.  That is admirable and I think people want that for themselves.  You should not change the great person that you are.  Just know that unfortunately, not everyone has the inner strength that you do.  All you can do the next time this happens (if it's someone close to you, like your boyfriend)explain to him, gently, that it hurts you when they are jealous of you.  If they truly love you, they will at least try to understand.|`|0ae8338e5c54bab8870c8fe00622d363aa	uuhhhhhhh dont know dont care|`|5d308aae544319011f193fd69aee49e1aa	think about this.     every one know the answer before the question. you see depression comes  from knowing what you must do but are scare to act on what you best foryou so we call people to hear themsay what we already know leave.a week of misery is better than a life time of heart ace and pain|`|AA10265303	People who help others in need are outgoing, compassionate, and generous to a fault. The quid pro quo is:  generous people help and  want love and gratitude in return. When the love and gratitude is not returned, the generous person gets hurt. Generous people have a hard time receiving help from others. They tend to not see what others are doing for them. They tend to be unthankful when they are on the receiving end of help, because they are uncomfortable being on that end. <br>  <br>  There are two things to remember about helping others: <br>  1) There are people who take advantage of you and will continue to take advantage of you. These are not your friends at all. They are ungrateful, speak evilly of you and are unworthy of your help. Stay 100 miles from these people. <br>  2)   People who receive help from you feel they owe you. As a result they feel diminished. It is unspoken -- felt more than thought. You always need to leave room to allow them to pay you back in some fashion. They may have you over for dinner. They may cut your lawn. The point is for a relationship like friendship to stay healthy there has to be a quid pro quo. Something for something, or favor for favor. The reason is that two friends need to feel they are on equal footing. <br>  <br>  It sounds like your boyfriend feels diminished in your presence. That is the real problem, not his so-called jealousy. You need to cool it. You need to practice thankfulness. You need to build up your boyfriend, if he is worthy. He may be a lazy bum. You have to decide. If he is a good man, then build him up. Be thankful. Allow others to help you. Purposely arrange situations where you allow people to take the heads position and you take the tails position.  That's the problem. You always want to be the heads and the people have to be the tails. Your friends are showing you that they don't always want to be the tails. It is not jealousy, it is a lack of equal footing. They don't have the words to express this clearly, and they probably are unaware of the dynamics working here. Your  helping has to be something that builds your friends up, not make them beholding to you, even on an unconscious level. I surely hope you understand what I am telling you, because I tell you true.|`|1a9029a11770d519d69e130b2f21ff20aa	Unfortunatly love, jealousy is just human nature in some people. But as long as your kids are alright and your bringing them up to the best of your ability, why worry about any body else.|`|3b6d114e2933a2be84786658fcd8c461aa	That is because they see all your potential and would like to emulate you. Some picture you as role model while others see you as a competitor. Ignore them continue on be strong.|`|450d10767194180b115cdc168632ac14aa	Don't sweat it it is their problem. God gave you these gifts you've mentoned and you use them well. Just love yourself. And one last thing tryi not encouraging the pople who are jealosus of you as much. Then see what their agenda really is.....|`|513465a24fdaa468c5d477e340e06483aa	They're jealous of how you can be so caring.  If they copy you, then think of it is flattery.  Mimicry is, after all, the greatest form of flattery.|`|7289591769e3d6aa5bb716176457acccaa	Honey, it sounds like you are a good person hanging around with some immature children. Be proud of who you are and spend time with people who are proud of you too.|`|db71e880b244b86100da67b8b6f50df1aa	Honestly step back and look at yourself. You may be a confident person but you also sound insecure. It sounds like you need to change things about yourself to make yourself love you before others can.|`|AA12073561	I can't remember the cliche, but something about copying someone being the sincerest form of flattery (Some one out there knows the correct line, I'm sure....)   If they're trying to copycat you, they're trying to be like you.  Competing with you also means they put you above them and they're trying to match or, or possibly unseat you to elevate themselves.  It's just human nature.  As long as you can SEE it, you're doing good.  There's nothing you can do about what THEY do -- you can only control your own reactions.  Once you let it roll off you, it frustrates them and you aren't bothered by it anymore.  One thing for sure, NEVER expect someone else to give as much as you do -- you'll always be let down.|`|8a44d327cd0a2a7f25a7cf3411268f4daa	Wow I can definitely relate to you. I'm a single mother also and I have a faily decent job, home and car but it wasn't always this way. You have to remeber that you encourage others but they may not do the same for you. I've learned that people will be people and to expect these things to happen so as to not het so hurt by it. I'm a very emothial sensitve peerson and it's taken me years to get through this one but just concertrate on you because people will take and never give back. It's time for you to think about you or no one else will. Best wishes.

I'm not saying there aren't troubled times, that you don't fight etc.  We are humans..BUT after the waves have settled the person is still standing right beside you.|`|462b78f4311608808a5064e9afb784d7aa	I think that most couples would like to be like that!  I definitely feel that way about my husband.  Because of religious reasons I don't believe in divorce as a viable option, so I made absolutely sure in every way possible that my husband was the right person for me to spend the rest of my life with.

0a9baaa6e70a1b78e2e0560dcc74853faa	Well that depends.  We have, and continue to teach our children that we will ove them no matter what they do in life.  But that's us.  I would hope that if one of my children were gay that they would feel free to come and talk to us aout it.  Of course I would want to know what makes them believe they are gay, and if they truely are, I would accept them no matter what.<br>  <br>  Just my 2 cents worth|`|a414a5e944f21c19f06c3e8e8870fad2aa	just tell her she is your mom and should accept it. so just tell her mom i am gay. all she can do is accept it.|`|14797fb225a23799870c96e21cc98ad6aa	just tell them! you are what you are and they will love you any way you are their child, maybe if you gave them info on pflag ( parents and friiends of lesbian and gay ) they could better deal or at least have some info to better understand what you are going through|`|24d7597d478268d5cee2686cc1acfa35aa	That is a tough question...when you are absolutely sure and ready to tell that is when you should do so...sit them down...let them know you have something to share that they may be surprised about...and just tell them...they may freak...however, as long as they love you, they will accept you for who you are, no matter what...good luck.|`|aba7ecf9352c237e31030d57247c1619aa	tell them wen u think it's da rite time|`|bf099b971c44912e70bc473b0e232fd4aa	do it when the time is right and do it with the one u feel more comfortable telling about and u should tell them before u find someone to or they wont get y and u will probably have to give it some time for them to understand and u mite have to explain.|`|24c00f5782341676da84bd4fe4af373faa	dont ever tell them ur gay, its not accepted in this world, if u told ur parents and ur not sure even 1% that they'll be ok with, dont tell them, people dont eccept aod an unusuall things in life, dont rewin things with ur perants, its not worth it|`|462b78f4311608808a5064e9afb784d7aa	I think you should tell her as nicely as possible.  It will probably be a shock to both your parents, so as long as you are able to nicely  tell them hopefully they will take it well.<br>  <br>  Just try to mentally prepare yourself for both the best and the worst reactions.  Good luck and I hope it goes smoothly!|`|70da49d5bf3eca60a84363b1056fb5c0aa	maybe you don't have to.....your parents may already suspect that you are gay.|`|984920ce39362ff227b9333e55fb7f4daa	just tell her if she loves you  like she say than she will love you for who you are and what you like!!!!!!!!
AA10239468	Thats is a good question that in my view would require a lot of serious thought.  You only included two possible options thus that is all that can be considered.<br>  <br>  I do suppose I must first consider the qualifications of the maid and her ability to care for and to treat the children as if you were the one caring for them.  I have seen many who really later in life have more respect for the maid than they do for the parents because of the maids care during the growing years.<br>  <br>  If it is a priority for you to educate the children at an early age about the ways of the world, then the nursery may be the best choice. In that case I would be very careful in the selecting of the nursery.<br>  <br>  I am sorry but in my opinion both have good and bad points. I like the stay at home and care for your own children because they were given to you by God, but you did not give that option.<br>  <br>  Only to make a choice I would probably choose the maid rather than the nursery for the nursery is a business and the maid at home is not.  I feel I could have more direct control over the maid and the children in the home situation and less headaches.|`|AA11649471	Dont know the ages of the kids you are talking about.  However, if the children were of age 1 and up, if I were fortunate to have a maid.. I would still want my children to go to the daycare or nursery for the simple reason, there they could have exposure to other children, learn how to share, play together, broaden their horizons somewhat better than with the maid.  In my mind, a maids duties would be of household chores, etc. not necessarily tending to children.. if this is a nanny as opposed to a maid, then I think I would still want my children to have that important social skills at an early age.  I feel that it is very important for them to learn the social aspect of life as early as possible.|`|77e3a136c013cc670a32a44114802ceeaa	Do you trust the maid? Does the maid mind babysitting? I think it's best for a little one to spend their first year at home. After that nurseries are good because it teaches kids how to be with other kids, sharing etc.|`|AA12276210	Quit work and stay home. Your children need you not a maid. Why did you have children if you do not want to nurture them?

5a95eeea21463bb3ab106a75bac43a68aa	It depends on the actors and the scene. In some of the scenes they do what is known as a stage kiss where one of the actor's fingers is blocking the other actor's mouth. This type might occur if the person really felt awkward, or if they were on a stage. The other type is a normal one, which stage and movie actors do alike as well. But no, they don't feel awkward. At least, not too much that it would get in the way of their scene. You have to remember that a show or movie is a job, and it pays the bills. And acting is a very enjoyable job. Even if they do feel a little uncomfortable, they eventually get over it. The actors have to have some measure of chemistry for the scene to work, and they undergo auditions so that the casting people know who will work together. Another thing, actors have little modesty. ^_^ In their job, they can't have too much, otherwise it severly limits the type of roles they can play. They know that it's a character, even as they become that character.<br>  <br>  (18)<br>  <br>  Hope this helps! ^_^|`|4042366bc1d8bafeabc3b989c50d8117aa	herion are they junkies????????????????????????????????|`|40aad258ce7761dab41f021f5270f09eaa	Yes they do it for the money.

eea18afdba05e322733e0707f68da45daa	A little less than a year ago I became friends with a guy that was not terrible physically attractive (to me) but had a wonderful personality.  We had a great connection and a lot of common interests.  We were friends for a couple of months, and then the connection became undeniable, so I decided to go for it in spite of the fact that I didn't find him all that attractive physically.  Almost 9 months later, we have an amazing relationship, because it's based in friendship, not lust.  The physical form is just a shell for the true person inside.  If she has a beautiful soul, she can become beautiful to you.|`|5cfbdc385317e011cbced4c9cfed5c6daa	i wood give her a chance becase you know what might happin  i look at the heart of a prerson|`|AA11517844	You are damn shallow.

Sure, people can often see past physical imperfections in someone they truely love..but you cannot seem to do that in this case.  To me, that indicates you don't truely love her-at least in a romantic way.  I think [if you asked her out ] that you would start to become resentful and unhappy. You might end up hurting her more in the long run.  I suggest keeping it at the close friend level. If you are not able to hold and touch and love her with physical affection too, it will only create hurt...|`|AA11969515	Absolutely not. You would not make her a good bf.

Orgasmo múltiplo s?o vários orgamos, em seqüência. Eles s?o possíveis, com algum intervalo entre um e outro.|`|a5d445a3dab67e38711976f94a514a79aa	O ORGASMO FEMININO é UM êXTASE<br>  <br>  Express?o facial, face avermelhada, vocaliza??o e ere??o dos mamilos durante o orgasmo. A pele e outras áreas ficam ruborizadas porque o horm?nio adrenalina dilata os vasos superficiais do corpo; <br>  O cora??o se acelera para bombear mais sangue aos músculos; <br>  No cérebro, a atividade dos neur?nios aumenta; <br>  Nos pum?es, a respira??o se torna rápida, para oxigenar o sangue, que circula mais depressa. <br>  <br>  <br>  O orgasmo, também chamado de clímax, é um estado fisiológico de excita??o sexual e gratifica??o, seguida por um relaxamento das tens?es sexuais e dos músculos do corpo. é marcado por sentimento de repentino e intenso prazer.<br>  <br>  Os orgamos beneficiam as mulheres fisicamente e psicologicamente de muitas maneiras, além de aliviar cólicas menstruais e diminui??o do stress. Muitos homens se importam profundamente se as parceiras alca?am o clímax. Uma rela??o sexual que n?o satisfa?a ambos, n?o satisfará o parceiro masculino emocionalmente, n?o importando quanto prazer físico ele consiga do ato em si. <br>  <br>  Para atingir o orgasmo, o sistema nervoso envia ordens ao cora??o para que os batimentos cardíacos se acelerem. <br>  <br>  A adrenalina, despejada pelas glandulas adrenais, é jogada no sangue e dilata as artérias, aumentando o fluxo sanguíneo nos músculos envolvidos nas atividades sexuais. Para uma melhor oxigena??o do sangue, os pulm?es aumentam o seu trabalho, e a respira??o se torna curta e rápida. O suor aumenta, provavelmente para dissipar o calor acumulado do corpo.<br>  <br>  O orgasmo é marcado por: <br>  <br>  · um sentimento de intenso e repentino prazer;<br>  · um aumento repentino dos batimentos cardíacos e da press?o sanguínea; <br>  · os seios incham, e os mamilos se tornam eretos; <br>  · vasoconstri??o generealizada; <br>  · o clitóris fica completamente retirado; <br>  · a vagina é lubrificada; <br>  · o útero se eleva;<br>  · ocorre espasmos dos músculos pélvicos causando contra??es vaginais. <br>  · vocaliza??o involuntária também pode acontecer. <br>  <br>  O orgasmo dura alguns segundos (normalmente n?o mais de dez); a estimula??o continuada pode produzir orgasmos adicionais na mulher. Após um orgasmo, o homem n?o responde mais à estimula??o sexual e n?o consegue alcan?ar outra fase de excita??o até que um certo período de tempo passe, mas as mulheres s?o fisicamente capazes de ter orgasmos repetidos, sem a necessidade do "período de recupera??o", necessário aos homens. <br>  <br>  Orgasmo Feminino: Por quê? <br>  <br>  O orgasmo feminino ainda permanece um mistério se comparado com o mais frequente e mais facilmente alcan?ado orgasmo masculino. Em termos de evolu??o e adapta??o, as mulheres n?o necessitam experenciar o orgasmo de maneira a reproduzir. <br>  <br>  Ent?o qual é a fun??o do orgasmo nas mulheres? Teóricos darwinistas, que fizeram tentativas precoces de caracterizar o orgasmo feminino, propuseram que o orgasmo faz com que a mulher permane?a deitada após o sexo, retendo passivamente o esperma e aumentando a probabilidade de concep??o (3).<br>  <br>  Outros sugeriram que o orgasmo feminino evoluiu para criar uma liga??o mais forte entre parceiros, inspirando nas mulheres sentimentos de intimidade e de confian?a entre eles. Alguns argumentaram que o orgasmo cumunica a satisfa??o sexual e a devo??o ao parceiro. <br>  <br>  Psicólogos evolutivos têm explorado a proposi??o de que o orgasmo feminino é uma sofisticada adapta??o que permite as mulheres manipularem - mesmo inconscientemente - qual de seus parceiros será permitido fertilizar seus óvulos (3).<br>  <br>  Orgasmos múltiplos em mulheres<br>  <br>  N?o é segredo que algumas mulheres tenham orgasmos múltiplos - Masters e Johnson documentaram o fen?meno há mais de 20 anos atrás (6). O orgasmo feminino representa um paradoxo. Enquanto ele é muito mais difícil de ser alcan?ado do que o orgasmo masculino, quando alcan?ado, parece ser capaz proporcionar o prazer repetido: o t?o chamado orgasmos múltiplos. <br>  <br>  Por que, em uma vis?o adaptacionista, isto ocorre? Por que o prazer feminino n?o pode ser t?o direto e t?o imediatamente recopensador como o do homem? <br>  Teorias sugerem que contra??es musculares associadas com vários orgasmos empurram com mais eficiência o esperma da vagina para o cérvix, onde há uma melhor posi??o para encontrar o óvulo. <br>  <br>  Pesquisadores descobriram que quando uma mulher alcan?a o clímax até 45 minutos depois que seu parceiro ejaculou, ela retém significativamente mais esperma do que em sexo n?o-orgásmico (3). Quando o orgasmo dela precede o do companheiro por mais do que um minuto, ou quando ela n?o tem orgasmos, pouco esperma é retido. (3). <br>  <br>  A pílula do orgasmo feminino <br>  <br>  Pesquisadores na Universidade de New Brunswick, NJ, acreditam que isolaram uma substancia química que produz orgasmos em mulheres. Através de experimentos com ratos de laboratório, os pesquisadores determinaram que o cérebro pode receber sinais de resposta sexual por caminho outro que a medula espinhal. Eles descobriram um caminho alternativo através do nervo vago, que vai diretamente do cérvix, através do abdomem e tórax, até o pesco?o e tronco cerebral. Mulheres que foram paralisadas e n?o possuem sensa??es abaixo da linha do peito, tinham na verdade, a capacidade de alcan?ar o orgasmo (7). <br>  <br>  Estes experimentos ajudaram o isolamento do peptídeo intestinal vasoativo, que acredita-se ser o neurotransmissor, ou mensageiro químico do sistema nervoso, que causa a sensa??o de orgasmo no cérebro. <br>  <br>  Esta mesma substancia química também tem efeito supressor da dor, rivalizando com a morfina, e fazendo dela um dia a fonte natural do alívio da dor (7). O achado poderia levar a uma pílula que daria a uma pessoa a mesma sensa??o de orgasmo e poderia ser usada no tratamento da dor.|`|6cd18b35b1a950a0f6910e19bf55035daa	oxenteeeeeeeeeeee|`|a94cf32cbccc9ec332bcc25492b34847aa	Acredita-se que algumas mulheres (poucas), no momento do orgasmo, conseguem expelir uma secre??o assim como os homens. é um líquido claro, às vezes leitoso, ralo e geralmente inodoro. “Essa informa??o foi veiculada devido a pesquisas de entrevistas com mulheres, porém n?o há trabalho científico a respeito.<br>  <br>  esse relato geralmente é observado em mulheres que têm múltiplos orgasmos ou aquelas que atingem o clímax através da estimula??o vaginal.

Nothing does. you may not have made the best choices to be in that situation, but nothing gives someone the right to violate your body against your wishes.

As far as him ditching you and stuff, that happens, but you were clearly telling him no and he wouldn't take no for an answer. Just make sure that if you do file rape charges, it isn't because he ditched you and no longer speaks to you and it's because you were forced to have sex against your will. I understand you feel likes its your fault because you gave in, but you gave in because he wouldn't give up and you were pressured and scared.<br>  Good luck.|`|AA11226510	You're right it wasn't rape because you gave in and unfortunately you put yourself in a position that you shouldn't have especially when it went on for quite sometime with him UN buttoning your pants. It seems like you were debating on what you really wanted to do but you wasn't sure if you wanted to do it at that time. But it happened. Just remember we all have made decisions that we have went on later to regret but you don't dwell on those situations, you learn from them and remember that you are a Jewel no matter other people think. and if you keep that in mind in every situation you will make your life a lot easier, especially when you have respect for yourself. Keep your head up momma and remember we all have made mistakes. LEARN FROM YOUR MISTAKES.|`|AA11843127	DO NOT BLAME YOURSELF. This is what rape victims do. Press charges. You've been raped! <br>  <br>  Save someone else from this predator--Please! Just go to the police station and write it down on a piece of paper. That's all it takes to get it started. Too many girls loose their viriginity by rape. It's not right. Be brave for the rest of us.|`|d03a85881fa5285ec5d0346c581299b6aa	that was peer pressure and you gave in you are just as much to fault as he is sorry but its the truth!!!|`|dbfced7d072f3d9de57dda02afdc5e71aa	IT. IS. NOT. YOUR. FAULT. I'm so sick of people saying it's the wemon's fault because of the clothes they were, they are drunk, or whatever. HOW ABOUT THIS? If a girl is drunk, don't rape her. If a girl is wearing a skirt, don't rape. AND IF YOU SAY NO, THEN YOU SAY NO!!! AND NO MEANS NO!!! He raped you and he should die choking in his own vomit while doing a summersault naked through a bon fire!! I would have givien in too, Because I would have been scared. scared of the fact he could kill me. RAPE IS SCARY. And you are not to blame!
1186daf1cebf759c1c154a11001207acaa	You teach him/her according to her questions. Like if she asks where do babies come from? Just say from a place called the uterus in the mommy. Wait until she asks for details don't volunteer. As she gets older she will ask. Be honest and never act like sex is a dirty thing when it comes on in a movie or tv program. Gently change it remarking at how that is private and not for us. We wouldn't go into someone else's bedroom or invite them to kiss in our living room would we? As she approaches her pre-teens you will have to prepare she/he for the changes that are about to take place before they happen. Otherwise it could leave the child feeling unnecessary shame and worry. For girls you would talk of the menstrual cycle and boys the wet dream which happens in their sleep no matter what. You wouldn't want him to wake up in the morning feeling he had done something wrong.|`|AA11328507	Oh come on!|`|AA11899639	you teach children the proper things - hearing it from others is never acurate|`|5c381ccb0a7f02e8d730d84bb09128b8aa	No, learning from parents at the appropriate age is the best thing|`|AA11001110	Are you kidding?  who would let a stranger talk to their kids about sex??  I talked to my daughter when she was about 9,  I used scientific descriptions for what it was and how babies were made.  I included what a period was, what happens to girls and boys bodies at puberty, etc.   It's my husbands job to talk to our son.|`|AA11802566	You have to talk to them to present your ideals in a way that you want.  Reading about it or hearing it from others that may have different ideals and/or morals than you just wouldn't be a smart thing to do to your kids....they get enough bad information outside the home!!|`|a26b747c76e01b98b822771179e14a2caa	you definitely teach your child yourself and the earlier the better because you can get all the embarassing questions out of the way before they know what they really mean - i told my daughter at 9 and we are so open now its great and she doesnt giggle at everything i tell her .  Throw the periods chat in at the same time too , you will feel better for doing it. When they hear it off others it turns into horror stories !|`|AA11814789	i started telling my son about sex when he started asking and we still have open talks about it and he's 20 and now has a son 4 months old i tried to do my best it just wasn't good enough i guess but i think it should come from the parents because their friends  know as much as they do and that's not enough........
AA10363910	lol...I love the sarcastic answers..lol...sorry...<br>  <br>   Your girlfriend doesn't have a problem with 1 year old's mom, because you didn't cheat on your girlfriend to conceive him! But the new baby would be a steady reminder of your unfaithfulness. But if given the choice, of claiming and supporting your new baby or losing your girlfriend, I'd let girlfriend go! What kind of man does she want you to be? Would she want you to turn your back if she got pregnant? Should the baby pay by not knowing you, because of a mistake you made? How heartless and selfish is this girl? Is that the character of a woman you want to spend your life with? Honey, you need to think about this and point these things out to her! <br>    Good Luck!<br>  <br>  And tie that thing in a knot next time!!..lol..|`|f639092fc925bbd55e7b6272eeb17334aa	Learn to keep it in your pants.

That's probably why she hates the idea. <br>  <br>  Maybe you should consider a vasectomy. You can't seem to keep your penis to yourself. You lack the ability to remain faithful to only one partner at a time. By the time you find your soulmate, she won't want you because of all of the excess baggage you are creating.|`|32fb35f493394070648e52e82a34026daa	Save money, get ready for child support.|`|AA11715471	you really need to start using protection, man.  I feel sorry for all of the parties involved, especially the children.  Is the girl pretty sure it is yours?  if so, you need to support the mom, she is holding your child and should not feel stress.  If the new gf cannot deal with this now, how will she treat your baby?  Your kid comes first, and if she isnt willing to deal with that then she needs to be the one to leave.|`|ae2dbdbedeef07b9871aa8d28e1f7834aa	If the girl doesn't accept the baby if it's yours and your any kind of father then the deal breaker should be you.. I know you were wrong for cheating but if she is willing to forgive you she can not justify taking it out on a baby|`|49361790207f895e1eabd9b92448ec90aa	your questions are getting to hard to believe.. now you're just being ridiculous...|`|bb73f73dff874f6464bbe93f0dbdf9daaa	Kind of a double standard with your kid and the one on the way.  Look, no offense, but if you were screwing around, do you really love the chic you're with anyway?

Tell him that he's around other people, he shouldn't try to showoff.
bca23255ffd120a5555209a9e8b2c99baa	He made his choice move on.  If he dated someone it maybe a little different, but he made a life long committment with someone else.  You are just setting youself up for hurt move on.  I think he may just wanted to have sex with you and make you the other woman.  Don't settle for being second best find someone who is clear on their feelings and will treat you like number one.|`|23ed6ed331b288040ea6e09da46e0ba1aa	Evidently he didn't care as much as you thought.

In the process, hopefully, you will show him what he gave up when he did not choose you.  Let him eat his heart out then.|`|ff5878ede57558281c30e4be2e1cb2d9aa	a crazy person is what he is.....get over him|`|AA12359948	Understand he LIKES you,he didn't want to marry you and still does.That makes him just a friend.Accept the fact,find someone else,and live on for another day.|`|AA10373401	Sounds kinda similar to my culture.  But now that he has someone, you should back off and hold your feelings to someone else.  If marrying someone else is what she wants, let him have it.

Si realmente te interesa conservar la relación con ella (por el motivo que sea) entonces sé tú la que se acerque y pida una disculpa (por los insultos que le dijiste) no por la situación que las llevó a eso.."Se que no estoy de acuerdo con lo que usted piensa y tengo mi propio punto de vista, sin embargo no me parece justo que la haya ofendido con insultos" y listo.

But how can a guy gain this confidence and convey it to women?<br>  <br>  The frame that works best for attracting women can be summed up in three words: It's Always On.<br>  <br>  To really be successful with women, you must be so confident that anything she says or does is proof that she is attracted to you. <br>  <br>  So how can you take on this powerful attitude for yourself? <br>  <br>  Here are some techniques that you can use to become a more confident guy:<br>  <br>  1. Become "principle centered" instead of validation centered<br>  If you come from a place of honesty, trust, respect, integrity, and loyalty, you will always be confident because you will always know you are doing the right thing.<br>  <br>  2. Prescribe the symptom<br>  This technique is from Milton Erickson, the famous therapist and hypnotist, whom I admire greatly.<br>  <br>  Take control of your shyness by deciding in advance to deliberately be shy when you go out. This gives you a sense of control over the emotion. You'll find that the next time you go out, you will be able to control the emotion and feel more confident.<br>  <br>  3. Earn confidence through self-knowledge<br>  When you truly understand yourself and what you want out of life, and know exactly who you are, it is a huge source of confidence.<br>  <br>  What is your mission in life?<br>  <br>  4. Be cool<br>  People become "cool" when they no longer fear other people's disapproval, or, said another way, when you are no longer seeking other people's approval.<br>  <br>  Find your own path in life and stick to it. Do what's right for you, no matter what anyone else has to say.|`|54e3a31c045491219f5ac677d445c4c3aa	just ask her|`|f82885965ef82d5306fc141045f176cdaa	ya i agree with the above.....Juat askher man.....start a conversation like.......i think we have a lot in common or sumthin like that and ask her to go with u to the movies or the next dance or sumthin and go from there|`|f639092fc925bbd55e7b6272eeb17334aa	Plan a date on a day you know she will be available and then just let it happen, but make sure that there is no doubt that you are only interested in her.|`|4f01f25ec176d99f0d025b47363f1f78aa	Mention to her how much you would like to see her t*ts!

3d50fe6001d7054bd8e70e7f26c87fb7aa	Old school marriage is one where the man works earns the living and is in control of the household, makes the decisions regarding his family and what they do, the woman stays at home and is happy to deal with the kids and house and let her husband do the rest.  Marriage is till death do you part, divorce which did happen is very rare.  Men and women both take their vows serious.  God was an important factor in lives as well as marriages back then not money and social standing.  The couple worked through things and stayed together.  Most slept in twin beds apart from each other.|`|93b973a4653bd2cfbce812682be8a05faa	Husband works, wife stays at home with the kids.  Wife cooks and cleans.

Nowdays it's too easy to get a divorce if times get a bit tough. Plus used to be each knew their role..... a man is a man and a woman is a woman, each bringing something to the whole. Now the woman tries to be the man and there doesnt seem to be too many strong confident men anymore. This is because for years women kept asking for a sensitive guy but now wonder where the "men" are. But the basic definition of old school is two people together no matter what...... a team working through life.|`|6b3980d5c1de92bd94ae26661494ec50aa	An "old school" marriage would be like when your grand parents got married.....Back when marriage ACTUALLY meant something........You were devoted to that ONE person til death do u part......You say your marriage vows and MEAN IT......a real genuine romance.....( like those old couples have who have been married for 50 years and still very much in love.....awwww!!)

82f5bed58788ca8d411b0bd3bd02889baa	Girl no. He drove you away. Leave him before it gets any worse. The best thing I ever did was leave a four yr. relationship and tried something new. In that relationship, I was under a lot of pressure and stress, I lost weight, and I cried constantly, now I'm happy because I'm free to be me. I express myself, and I'm not scared anymore, don't take 4yrs like me to leave someone who don't mean you no good, leave now...you done been through enough, and if this one ends up not being the one, just look at it like this...your gain is their lose. You would have more experience of what you don't want and knowledge of what you do. Trust me, it will all work in your favor. Don't hang on to old news, let it go...you only got one life to live, live it the way you want to. Every girl is a princess, waiting for her chance to be a queen.|`|ecce99a765034e05acbd50f9c1eaec1baa	Ther is nothing wrong in liking another guy. Your bf mistreats you, so what are you suppossed to do. Not because you already have a bf doesn't mean you are cold as a stone. You are bound to like someone along the road. Of course it won't be like you will cheat on your bf even though he doesn't seem so nice. However your feelings seem to be based on the fact that your bf is demanding and isn't what this other guy is, making this "crush" more irresistable. I would say you will never know unless you take the time to spend some time alone and think. Is my current relationship giving me what I want making me happy. If it isn't why are you still there? do u really have feelings for your bf if you do try talking to him and telling him how you feel about the realitionship. You have to work at it with him, if not it you might end breaking up with him and later regretting it.
265f8a8b46cd3ab51e3786ea83bfb8ccaa	First, let me just say that as a romantic man myself, we need more of that kind of attention directed to the girl we love. In a relationship, it is all about listening & going the extra mile. If she likes roses & small places to dine, then she will be thrilled. The key to making her smile like the rising sun, is to plan a date that she has a picture of in her mind. You must get to know her & know what makes her light up. Before you set the date for this <br>  grand event, find out for sure if she would like to do something of this sort.

"This is the maid," answers the woman.  "We don't have a maid," says the man.  The woman says, "I was hired this morning by the lady of the house."  The man says, "Well, this is her husband. Is she there?"  The woman replies, "She is upstairs in the bedroom with someone who I figured was her husband."  The guy is fuming. He says to the maid, "Listen, would you like to make $50,000?"  The maid says, "What will I have to do?"  The man tells her, "I want you to get my gun from the desk, and shoot the witch and the jerk she's with."  The maid puts the phone down; the man hears footsteps and the gun shots.  The maid comes back to the phone, "What do I do with the bodies?" The man says, "Throw them in the swimming pool."  Puzzled, the maid answers, "But there's no pool here."  A long pause and the man says, "Is this 832-4821?" <br>  <br>  -One day a young man and woman were in their bedroom making love. All of a sudden a bumble bee entered the bedroom window. As the young lady parted her legs the bee entered her vagina. The woman started screaming, Oh my god, help me, there's a bee in my vagina!  The husband immediately took her to the local doctor and explained the situation. The doctor thought for a moment and said, Hmm, tricky situation. But I have a solution to the problem if young sir would permit. The husband being very concerned agreed that the doctor could use whatever method to get the bee out of his wife's vagina. The doctor said OK, what I'm gonna do is rub some honey over the top of my penis and insert it into your wife's vagina. When I feel the bee getting closer to the tip of my d!ck I shall withdraw it and the bee should hopefully follow my penis out of your wife's vagina.  The husband nodded and gave his approval. The young lady said Yes, yes, whatever, just get on with it.  So the doctor, after covering the tip of his penis with honey, inserted it into the young lady's vagina. After a few gentle strokes, the doctor said, I don't think the bee has noticed the honey yet. Perhaps I should go a bit deeper.  So the doctor went deeper and deeper. After a while the doctor began shafting the young lady very hard indeed. The young lady began to quiver with excitement, she began to moan and groan aloud, Oh doctor, doctor! she shouted. The doctor, concentrating very hard, looked like he was enjoying himself.  He then put his hands on the young lady's breasts and started making loud noises.  The husband, at this point, suddenly became very annoyed and shouted. Now wait a minute, what the hell do you think you're doing?! he blasted.  The doctor, still concentrating, replied: Change of plan, I'm gonna drown the bastard!<br>  <br>  -Two bored casino dealers were waiting at a craps table.  A very attractive blonde woman arrived and bet $20,000.00 on a single roll of the dice. She said, "I hope you don't mind, but I feel much luckier when I'm completely nude." With that she stripped from her neck down, rolled the dice and yelled, "Mama needs new clothes!" Then she hollered..."YES! YES! I WON!" She jumped up and down and hugged each of the dealers.  She then picked up all the money and clothes and quickly departed.  The dealers just stared at each other dumbfounded.  Finally, one of them asked, "What did she roll?" The other answered, "I don't know I thought YOU were watching!" Moral: Not all blondes are dumb, but all men are men!!!<br>  <br>  -Mickey Mouse and Minnie Mouse were in a divorce court and the judge said to Mickey, "You say here that your wife is crazy."  Mickey replied, "No i didn't, i said she was f*cking Goofy."

Eu n?o considero que elas se sentem inferiores, acontece que elas s?o diferentes dos homens, em muitas coisas e temos a impress?o, pelo seu comportamento, que se sentem inferiores, mas na realidade elas est?o é agindo à maneira delas e conquistando o seu espa?o na sociedade. Absolutamente, elas n?o se sentem inferiores.

You are basically the same way that he is. How can you be so sure that you don't give off the vibes that you don't really want a serious serious relationship with him, and that's keeping him from saying anything. I think that the fact that he's taking care of you and your son and you feel this way, is rather selfish and it sounds kind of like you're prostituting yourself out in a way for food, shelter and the same for your child. I think that because of what you said about how you can't leave right now because he's taking care of you. I'd say , if he doesn't want to commit, you should be happy he is staying with you anyways. Maybe he's feeling a little used, because I think I would if I were him. I'm sorry if this sounds harsh, but I just think you aren't looking at his position very much and just concentrating on what you want to hear from him to maybe boost your ego.|`|AA11899639	you don't want to marry him & you don't want to break up yet - so you are just using him- what does it matter?

Either he taking care of you and/or if you left , you would be worse off than being there with him (financailly).   When will people learn you cant chage anyone,  if he aint commit to you by now chancews are he never will and your just wasting time hoping he will.  you have to ask yourself why he is not.  And ill tell you why,  why would he buy the cow when he already gets the milk for free.<br>  Also you contradicting yourself ,  how we let me break it down for you.  In one breathe you state that you dont wanna marry him and you know hes not the right one for you.  But then you got on to say that the whole cohabitating thing bothers you and the fact that he's not offering to commit is bothering you.  (im lost on that one)  you can not have it both ways,  you dont want him but your upset cause he dont act like he wants you.   huh wtfis that all about.  dear figure out what YOU want and go get it.  Why are you awaiting arrival of something you dont want in the first place.  Cancel that order make a new one for what you want and get it.
e036cbc68471e304ef8dbb200c884d87aa	OK, first of all, where are your parents with all this going on?  They should not let your brothers and sister be sexually irresponsible and they should not allow them to be so mean to you.  If your parents are neglectful you need to talk to some responsible adult about it like a school counselor or a minister or more responsible relative.<br>  <br>  Second, remember that your sister is probably being so active in response to similar teasing when she was younger.  Don't let your siblings push you into this dangerous and irresponsible behavior.  They think if they call you ugly or a lesbian that you will run out and go with any guy you can get just to prove them wrong.  DON'T FALL INTO THAT TRAP!  You are too young for that sort of thing, and even when you feel old enough you should wait for someone you feel close to and can trust.<br>  <br>  Finally, I'm sure you look just fine and your brothers are just being mean, but if you don't look the way you'd like remember that 13 is an awkward age where some parts of our body grow faster than others and you might look very different in a few years when everything catches up.  I remember looking at young Tara Lapinski and thinking - "Gee I hope she grows into that face someday" and she did.  She looked like a troll doll at the time but grew up to be a glamorous adult.<br>  <br>  This is so important for you and how you grow up.  Remember:<br>  <br>  1] Talk to a responsible adult.<br>  2] Don't jump off that bridge just because they call you chicken.<br>  3] You are not done growing yet and might look very different in the future.<br>  4] Wait until you're old enough and it's what you want to do.  Then ALWAYS use protection.|`|1816a64fd088fbedf36f65a5fd54e4a0aa	First, let me just tell you that they are just saying this because they know that it bothers you.   The same thing happens to lots of younger sisters and brothers,  you are NOT ALONE.  I didn't have a boyfriend til I was 16, and that was good, because it does not make sense to have one any younger than that.   <br>  <br>  I would tell you to try and tell them that this really makes your feelings hurt, that it makes you so sad, and you want them to stop. Maybe write them each a note and leave it on their bed.  Try to say it when it is quiet in the house, when they are just sitting and watching tv, or when you are all eating dinner.   If you can tell your mom or dad,  maybe they could help.    I know that you feel like there is nothing you can do, but remember that this will not last forever, that one day you won't have to listen to them any more, and they will probably even feel bad about what they said, once they get older.   I used to call my little sister all sorts of terrible things when I was younger, and now it just makes me want to cry, ...I can't believe I was so mean, and I wish I could take it all back.  Hang in there, you ARE IMPORTANT to this world,  and don't ever forget that.  God loves you, and pray to God to help you deal with your family, and to get through this hard time. Everything is going to be ok!  God bless you!|`|AA11899639	when other people say mean things to someone it's because they have low self esteem- you are fine - and think that they are probably jealous otherwise they wouldn't say mean things to you|`|cb41d5c23ca37f5dcfa845618b4f9e28aa	THE WAY PEOPLE TREAT OTHERS REFLECTS HOW THEY FEEL ABOUT THEMSELVES, AND YOU CAN TELL THEM THAT.  <br>  IT'S CALLED PROJECTION.<br>  TELL THEM TO QUIT PROJECTING THEIR OWN INSECURITIES ON YOU.<br>  WHEN THEY TELL YOU THAT NO ONE WILL DATE YOU BECAUSE YOU ARE UGLY, AS THEM IF THAT IS WHAT THEY ARE AFRAID OF.<br>  YOU SHOULD FEEL SORRY FOR THEM.

Then smile and walk off like you have a secret that they don't know.

It seems like everytime I  am actually having a good day... here comes my husband insulting me in someway.  Nothing positive ever comes from his mouth to me anymore.  I think he gets off hurting my feelings.  Yet wonders why I don't want to sleep with him anymore.  Oh I tried for a long time because I thought it was my duty as a wife, but all I could hear in my head was the insults and there I would go crying again.  I'd rather he not even talk to me if all he's going to do is bring me down.  Currently I am unemployed and when he starts in on me then I am upset and it's a little hard to go on an interview with swollen eyes let alone the heaviness in my heart. You know verbal abuse is sometimes worse than physical.  I know I live it daily.  I spend my time moving from room to room just to get away and have a little peace.  Good Luck in trying to ignore it I have not been able to master that one myself.

No doubt that choice number is out of question. It is the most wrong thing to do. You are lying to him and to yourself. I think it's best to talk to him in person. These things are better to be discussed face to face. Tell him that you and him have been best friends for some time, but with time your freelings for him changed and became stronger than just friendship, you are hoping that you guys can go the next step. See what he tells you. If you say it the way I told you, it won't be weird and if he rejects, it won't cause any damage to your friendship. Hope this helps and good luck :)|`|5bdb9f91939ed2156bd71e06e08ce6cbaa	Go with #2 it is more real and has potential to work.

Women no longer have to put up with abuse because the law now protects them. Women had to go to work in the 40's because of the war. They liked the advantages of working and stayed in the work force. Many individuals, men and women, find attractions to work mates and boom, a divorce occurs. The Bible tells that this will happen. That is the greatest reason for this problem. The Bible does not lie.

556f6a84a1e72fa5f9fa440c37251fe4aa	I've been told both of the above at some point in my life.  :)<br>  <br>  --The Negative energy, I think is mainly because I *do* have a mood disorder, do get seriously depressed, and well....some folks just don't or won't seem to get it that if a Mood Disorder were some sort of "voluntary" thing I could turn on and off, and *make* go away at will...well, don't you think I would have *done so* by now??  :P<br>  <br>  But yeah, a lot of folks will give you that "negative energy" crap when you are down, when you have legitimate reasons for being in a crap mood.  In this case I am not always sure that this is a negative *energy* thing--it might well be more of a negative *reflection* thing, in terms of mood reflecting circumstances, you know?<br>  <br>  --The positive energy thing is a weird one....not a lot of folks have noticed this from me and accepted it at face value, but....<br>  <br>  If I am fairly calm and relaxed when I am around people, and not too terribly busy myself....I tend to *boost* the mental endeavors of others around me.  It usually doesn't matter if *I* open my big geeky mouth any....if others around me are relaxed and open to it, it seems like they get a boost from being around me.  And even for normal people, it seems significant enough to *attract* people sometimes, so that when I go shopping for instance, I will be at a place for five minutes and suddenly all the local students from the nearby university campus show up....<br>  <br>  But I really figured this one out from being in my apartment building.  There are a significant number of elderly people and people with mental illness and outright mental impariments in my building....and it almost never fails, that when I show up, certain others do too, and that they are almost *always* more coherent and focused around me than around some of my other neighbors.<br>  <br>  And I am fairly laid-back and easy to get along with 95% of the time (and no, not an anal person the remaining 5%--the bottom five percent of the time I keep to myself), so no, I am not enforcing any norms or anything to my best knowledge....<br>  <br>  It just seems like when I can maintain it for myself that I bring a "calm, focused, thoughtful" type of vibe to others.  Those that become aware of it in their own way kinda like it.  I'm not sure what good it does *me* but there it is....|`|11b259ed47d0ea3c4c3c482525f69667aa	Yes I have been told I give positive energy to others.  Sometimes when a person needs someone to talk to, it is very difficult to find someone who is ready to listen only without even uttering a word of acknowledgement.  People in trouble need to spit out their troubles in order to feel good, otherwise these troubles would effect their life-cycle.  In acknowelegement to this patience, these people say that you have given them the energy to keep on going.  On the other side if instead of helping someone the troubles spread, then their opinion of you would be automatically the opposite.  What do you think?|`|8089153f0d69d29d76ff72de3d8a105baa	Positive. I am a giver, not a taker, I have charisma, a healing gift, and a sense of humor. It is my moral value to help others enjoy life. I am an entertainer too.

(Don't bother paying for your score b/c it really doesn't matter at this point).<br>  <br>  Once you have it, you should be able to see if there are any addresses that don't belong to you on there.  This might help you figure out who is using your identity.  Now if it is a family member, you should confront them.  You could report them and clear your name up, or you might be stuck waiting years for the stuff to expire (assuming that whoever stops using your idenity.)<br>  <br>  Not a good place to be with a family member (b/c usually it means financial problems.)<br>  <br>  If it happens to be someone else, definitely report it.<br>  <br>  File a police report immediately in the jurisdiction where you live. This proves to credit providers you were diligent, and this is a first step toward an investigation (if there ever is one). <br>  <br>  Call the three national credit reporting organizations immediately to place a fraud alert on your name and Social Security number.  The alert means any company that checks your credit knows your information was stolen, and they have to contact you by phone to authorize new credit.  <br>  <br>  Now, here are the numbers you always need to contact about your identity being stolen: <br>  <br>  1.) Equifax: 1-800-525-6285 <br>  2.) Experian (formerly TRW): 1-888-397-3742 <br>  3.) TransUnion: 1-800-680-7289 <br>  4.) Social Security Administration (fraud line): 1-800-269-0271|`|4ec2b0f2c6d27448024b5bf29145386aaa	What do you mean you do not want to get anyone in trouble? Who ever did it, did not consider how much pain and heartache you are going to suffer trying to get your credit history corrected.<br>  First get your credit report history, go through each acct opened and write, ask them who and when each acct was opened, ask for receipts with signatures and things like that, after start disputing them. Make a police report. I know of people that have  taken them years to clear something like this.  Find the person and prosecute them. That is all they deserve, or you will never be able to open an account, or even a house. Get prepare for the BATTLE of your young life.|`|408bf13a5830f0407bdc57a66a1491d7aa	you don't want someone in trouble while they got you in trouble?  boy, that's a bad combo.  who gives a **** if u get them in trouble, obviously, they didn't think about you when they opened all those accounts.  dispute it with the credit bureus (experian, trans union, i forgot the other one), it'll take time but do it otherwise, you won't qualify for anything.  if you don't want anyone in trouble, then do nothing and pls. stop whining abt. it.|`|5f297977fd704bd8099a65707f996f59aa	You need to get in touch with the three credit bureaus and talk to them, and also Chexsystems. Tell them what has happened. You may have to send them a copy of your ID to prove your age.  You need to do this NOW, before you turn 18. You also need to go to the Social Security Administration and file for a new number, and keep it under lock and key. In order to be able to do this, you may have to file charges against the perpetrator.<br>  Your thoughtfulness toward your family, if this is who did this to you, is to be commended, but I believe it to be misplaced. Whoever the culprit is did not think of how this would affect you, did they? They not only ruined your credit rating, they took advantage of you and made it exceedingly more difficult for you in the future you are embarking on. Don't let your youthful good nature hinder you from doing what is right for your own future. Whoever did this does not deserve your loyalty. And they were probably expecting you to NOT report them because you are family. This is emotional blackmail and backstabbing of the worst kind.<br>  Good luck.|`|AA11419986	stop worrying about getting someone in trouble. they didn't care about you when they stole your identity now did they

Ever thought of a career change?|`|d25ffe0965756a348a399c2ec86042b9aa	It depends on the employer how much "fun" you can be doing at work.......but remember...someone who hired you is not paying you to do the things you're doing.  Be honest and be responsible.<br>  <br>  If you were the owner or the person who has hired, would you find this behavior tolerable or wasting your money? <br>  <br>  This is not the answer you were looking for, but I hope you read it and look into it seriously.<br>  <br>  Have a good day.|`|6a837ae9c1fed73d9a78152ddfe4b038aa	Hay i worked in a place that ---------I would tell people that i had to get back , because i ran a    ZOO  !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
8bcbc5559b945005c2be6cdea7e8be73aa	It all depends on your body type and shape.  Going by weight alone i cannot say your overweight.  I mean lets face it some people just have different figures than other.  So dint listen to the other girls responding that most likely purge there meals everyday or eat crackers only.   If you feel like you look nice and feel good about yourself that is all that matters.  Ex.  If you are large breasted your obviously gonna be heavier than someone with an a cup so on so forth.|`|062e5e4b706150d869d101e1c48d3d5caa	lol well yea u r cusz im 15 nd im 5'7 and i weigh 125lb....and i got a bangin body so u must be fat and i kno im not a guy but yea|`|08e3c1febe2495bae333c2104a4234d0aa	depends on how ur bulit but i doubt your overweight  ur mostlikly normal weight not anerexic like most girls now a days|`|569202b98ddf361f85c3b2a9bc26c452aa	Doods like all types.

A better indicator would probably be your dress size or jeans size...|`|AA10696655	No, you are not!  If you feel bad about your body, go to the gym to tone up..but you are not "fat" by any means.  Don't listen to these rude people!|`|a2e3f85c9d0a5100fde59888f017b697aa	No, I don't think so, since you have a lot of muscle you sound just right.|`|ccce4bf5944077d1fbf6dc9b58a7bf5baa	sry...yea, im 6'2 and u weigh 15 pounds less than me|`|AA12165010	Hey I'm 5'7" and 145 lbs. too.

My bf said that you are not. But if you get up to 150-160 or any higher, then you should start to exercise and eat smaller portions to control your weight. Just think....big boobs, big booty can be a good thing. But don't put on any more wait he says.|`|80924e4bbf7c2be738c26f73d26f6dbaaa	no ur not ur just going to make other girls jeallous|`|AA10913368	that is so hard to answer because muscle weighs more than fat i am 27 5'7" and weigh 178 the doctor says i am over weight but i don't have a ounce of fat on my body yeah that's right baby 6 pac abs|`|AA12017512	well a little.  wait no ur not my brother is 14 and wieghs 175
AA12073561	Well, let's see, she's having serious money-problems if her hubby lost his job, and her mother died.  Hmmm.  Sounds like some BIG issues that can cause some major depression to me.  Add to that that her family seems to be oh-so supportive (brothers fighting with her, son ditching her because she's having problems)  Sounds like a lot of reason to "feel better" doesn't it.<br>      Your mom is battling some heavy stuff right now.  Beating her up won't do anything.  She's struggling to keep her head above water in a number of ways.  You should be "kind" even if you feel the need to keep your distance.  And, she probably does need some help right now.   As your mother, she IS going to push her ideas, etc. on her because that's what she knows.  She's trying to teach you "right" because that's what she's supposed to do -- even if her lessons aren't necessarily right.  She's always going to be a "mother" so that will never change.   She's from a different generation, and the times are a'changin' fast!!!  You're only 25, and you have no idea who YOU are yet -- trust me.  You'll START that process in a couple of years and might have a semi-clue by 30.   (And doesn't asking you to return a call so she won't have to pay the bill indicate a pretty serious financial problem?)|`|AA10625778	You said recently your mom has been negative and that you use to have a great relationship with her.. She maybe going through the change of life (menopause).. she probably feels unappreciated or unloved... give her some space and understanding..  she may need to be on hormone therapy... she may need to talk to a professional...  mean time try and be the good daughter you always were|`|AA12126281	She is 49, she is not going to change unless she wants to and even at that it would be hard.  She, like anyone else, is the way she is.<br>  Plus your step dad lost his job, its not easy at his age to just go out and get another.  This is worrisome on him and her.<br>  Her mother died.  Listen to your list of situations she has gone through.  She needs a sounding board right now, you.<br>   And you are you too.  If you don't want to hear her religious ways she should respect you too, you are a man now.  Sometimes we as mothers forget our little boys grow up.  After all if she is like me I enjoyed my children being around and playing with them.  She might miss that too.<br>  You did tell her you didn't want her in your life.  Thats pretty heavy.  You need to apoligize for that.<br>  You and her don't have to agree on everything, its OK to disagree, you are both different people. <br>  It's not nice to call people names no matter what our thoughts on a subject is.  I don't like the way the world is changing either, but some things are changing and we have to learn to accept that.<br>  I  have a son whom I love with all of my heart and I don't know what I would do if he ever said something so harsh as you did.  I know I have always told him, you can take it or leave it ( referring to my advise).  But really I try very hard not to give it unless he asks for it.<br>  You and your mom have some issues to work out.  But its not impossible.  Some things you have to let roll off your shoulders.<br>  Hope this helps, it comes from my heart as a mom.

I mean if they are my friends how could they deceive me?<br>  <br>  Then I would look at if I considered them friends and  what made them take advantage or jepordize our relationship.  Were my feelings even taken into consideration,  any remorse shown or do they act just like it's another day.<br>  <br>  Still friends???  Maybe.   Good friends??  Your choice.  Can you put your feelings out there and be secure they will respect them?<br>  <br>  You know these people,  what do you think?  Not for them,  for you.<br>  <br>  If you change your attitude they'll know why you discontinued faith and support that the intimacy doesn't exist anymore.

A little thing can be forgiven, a big thing shouldn't be.  Without trust there is no friendship or relationship.  Either way, you've found out that your friends don't think of you as highly as you thought.  I know it's hard but it's probably best to find a new group of friends.|`|4f122d3d2d5cf7e4d6807978f09fbae1aa	My boyfriend wore a wire for the D.A. against me twice and never said a word to me about it until I found out from an investigator and confronted him with the info.

In fact, don't think of it as a date; but instead, think of it as just hanging out. If you make it a big deal, you might scare her off.

2d32a6064ac5838b97a55efa0ccecbdfaa	You need to first figure out why you're having these feelings.  Are you insecure about yourself for whatever reason?  Have you been cheated on before?  Do you not feel he loves you anymore?  These could just a few reasons why jealousy turns its ugly head in relationship.  Once you figure out the problem, then you'll be able to work on the real issue.  <br>  <br>  To me it sounds like you have a combination of two problems.  One it sounds like you have been cheated on before.  So as a result, you're afraid that he will do the same (even if you don't realize it).  Try to give him the benefit of the doubt.  He's gonna get attention from other girls, but he obviously doesn't want them.  He wants you and only you or he'd been cheating a long time ago (which I really don't think he is).  Instead, be proud.  You have a handsome guy that other girls want, who only wants you.  Put your head up, smile, and put your arm around him when you two are walking.  This will show other girls he's yours and your d*mn proud of it.  The second problem could be that you're a little insecure about yourself and may feel like you're no longer good enough to be with him, so you have to cling to him to keep him.  That's obviously not the case of he wouldn't be with you.  Believe him when he tells you he loves you, you're gorgeous, etc.  Cuz after three years, he wouldn't say it if he didn't believe it.  That pride on what you two have and just work on your issues and things should settle down.  Also, have him remind you when you start to get jealous or clingy so that way you can stop yourself.  You really can't do this yourself and showing him you're trying will mean so much.  Good luck and I hope I helped in some way.|`|29033b2f15d68fe096476f517e807e3baa	To trust is to believe. Nobody is so perfect as a saint. You are a common human being, so does he. Trust is based on the deep love between him and you. To trust is simply to love.|`|AA10217500	Men do not like woman that are clingy, and in order to not be so clingy, you need to get a life.  By that I mean find activities and interests that are of interest an importance to you, do some volunteer work, anything that would distract from him and your jealous and obsessive way.  Trust as you know is a really important part of any relationship and noone can give trust to you, you need to believe in what you and this guy share.  He will get fed up of your constant insecurities and find someone that he doesn't have to reassure every two seconds!  Grow up, strengthen your relationship by being independant, finding your own interests, loving yourself, building your confidence and self-esteem. Stop being so paronoid, women are everywhere and yes, they will look at your man, but so what, he is with you, isn't he? And if he hasn't given you any reason to be insecure, then relax.

Like the answer submitted before me, you are describing your car.  For those who react on impulse, you may find a cinder block thrown through the windshield if not worse.

Don't do it.|`|c39514ca3eb9e03b9723c65db154d752aa	Why not?  if YOU want to drive YOUR car with a bumper sticker that says that, you're more than welcome to.

AA11775731	What a tough position your in, but its not the end of the world. If things are great for him but not great for you then something is definitely wrong and its not a relationship that is making you happy. Its terrific that you two get along for the baby's sake but it has to work for the adults as well. There is never a good time to bring the subject up of how you are feeling so maybe you can let him know that the two of you need some serious time alone to get things sorted out. Another thing "Don't ever stay together for the child" I made that mistake and trust me, it just never works out that way. You can be supportive of your baby whether you are with his father or not. You two have to agree that the most important thing is his welfare. This should be done in positive settings. Its possible to raise a very well rounded child even when the parents arent together, but working together is important. He will feel loved by both of you. Good luck!!|`|4a82f6d53e957b15663568e7e87ba985aa	it sounds to me like you guys need to spicen things up, tell him what you feel like you're not getting enough of, ask him if there's anything he wants.<br>  if that doesn't work then maybe you should move on, just make sure the father can stay in the childs life.|`|AA11899639	when you ask questions like this one it's time to go -your soul knows best|`|ed6aa9ef3a9a5ba4843b7d32f3c5b980aa	I think your taking a very special man for granted .He is the father of your child and honey i was single a long time no one will love a child in the exact same way as a real dad will.The only way you should leave is if he hits you or cheats on you.Do you understand that if you left him in 6 months you would be crawling back because its a cold sick world out there and dating is no exception.Spice things up give it your whole heart its just a rough patch.
AA11707323	All I can say from experience its that if it feels like too much too soon and too good to be true, it is.  There is something not so good waiting in the background.  I dont know this kid but anyone who moves too fast has some issues that wont come out until YOU fall in love and find it harder to view everything as you should.  Arab men in general think of women as less than them and they are very traditional when it comes to a women's place in this world.  Cooking, cleaning, raising children and obeying men are normal.  Besides all that, at 18 your way too young to get married.  You have no idea how many things you will miss out on if you follow through with this marriage.  Its not a good idea and your gut is trying to tell you that.|`|AA10414527	I think you let your emotions cloud your sight, You are a young woman and should not have to wait for ANY man.

Then, after a few yrs have gone by, and you both feel the same, then decide where to go from there.|`|070acd6453e880fd563a2a3c744a2757aa	no, there even nicer when they have gone to see ala|`|AA11899639	that's your red flag RUN, you are too young, and if he's scary now wait till after marriage|`|AA12241780	run forest run, next thing you know , you will be on a plane !  with a bomb straped !|`|d1e0c5dd9848bbb5716827d226ec9a9daa	OMG!

Yeah, you're young, but being young doesn't mean you have to act young and go sleep around have fun. <br>  I'm tired of Westerners thinking that way, the only thing they get is just more slutty. Don't take advice from them. <br>  <br>  If you don't want to marry him then don't. I would be more worried if the guy wasn't serious. Besides, I would applaud a guy who has willpower to stay faithful and wait for a girl for years and STILL want to marry her then. <br>  <br>  I think you're worried for all the wrong reasons. But if you can't deal with it then don't marry him.

AA12144161	The alleged interview has been circulating since December 2, 2004 and it's been proven false and she has since sued the author of the hoax interview. <br>  <br>  A December 7, 2004 bulletin from The Electronic Urban Report confirmed the obvious: this purported "interview" with black tennis star Serena Williams is a hoax. "Ms. Williams has conducted no such interview," the report said. Here is her quoted response: <br>  <br>  "Words cannot express how upset I am to find out that someone has deliberately attempted to ruin my reputation and image," says Ms. Williams. "I would never, ever, under any circumstance, be so disrespectful. Whoever decided to write this garbage does not know Serena Williams. It is not my thinking nor my being. I want to find out who is behind this, and have them prosecuted within the fullest extent of the law. I am hoping that there will be more policing over the Internet, in order to find out immediately the origin of this kind of treachery. No one deserves to be humiliated and defamed this way." The earliest copy of the hoax received here was dated December 2. No source was cited, nor was I able to locate the text in any published source. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://urbanlegends.about.com/gi/dynamic/offsite.htm?site=http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/tennis/news/story%3Fid=1942048" rel="nofollow">http://urbanlegends.about.com/gi/dynamic...</a><br>  <br>  She even went so far as to clear her name on television.

Find out why she doesn't want you to be together.  Listen to what she has to say and maybe she will listen to what you have to say.  Hopefully, you can work it out.  If not, maybe it isn't meant to be.  It may hurt but it will be better in the long run.

In the end it didn't work out and a lot of it was the stress of it being secret. I wish you the best of luck whatever you decide to do.

Try current events (news), find out more about the person your are talking to by asking them questions about them self. Sports, music, hobby's, school, family, friends, travel, favorite things, turn offs, turn ons, The coolest things come from your own heart.

Si tu pregunta es cierta, es que algo dentro tuyo te molesta. Está mal visto a las mujeres hebreas mostrar el pelo y deben usar polleras largas, las musulmanas deben con el Burka tapar su rostro, a los católicos nos está prohibido desear la mujer del prójimo, tener malos pensamientos y fornicar. Ahora, como vos apliques tu creencia, es tuya. Yo me confieso, tengo malos pensamientos y me gusta fornicar. por lo tanto estoy en un estado continuo de pecado. Si respeto a la mujer del prójimo (aunque a veces ellas me quieran faltar el respeto a mí).<br>  La sexualidad hoy se vé desde otro plano. Hasta la cirscunsición, con respeto a quién la practique, me parece algo ya superado como para realizarlo.Opinión personal, sin ánimo de ofender.<br>  Me gusta el sexo anal cuando estoy en pareja, como acto de libertad dentro del juego, y a la mujer que pueda estar conmigo intento que le sea sumamente placentero, y hasta hoy, siempre lo han disfrutado.<br>  Ya de hecho, estás pecando porque tenés malos pensamientos.<br>  <br>  Realmente, creo yo, preocupate por ser felíz, plena y sin restricciones para lo que te haga sentir emocionalmente bién a vos. El sexo, a mi entender, es para que lo disfrutes, no para que lo intelectualices o te interrogues.<br>  <br>  DIOS, estoy seguro, no nos vá a preguntar que tipo de sexo tuvimos, estoy seguro, bien como dice la frase, nos va a preguntar que calidad, no cantidad de amor dimos.

POr naturaleza, los hombres somos infieles y siempre mentimos para lograr nuestros objetivos, pero lo  más importante es tu desición, si crees que serás feliz con él, entoncces no lo pienses, pero lo más seguro es que esa relación te traerá muchos sinsabores,los seres humanos no cambiamos, enternamente seguimos siendo siempre igual.<br>  Cudate mucho.|`|1d66e65a5ba17a18084515676ccb30f1aa	bueno  si el  deverdad dice  que  esta enamorado de ti y regroso  por algo fue si  tu deverdad  estas enamorada  de el  dale  una oportunidad para ver como el a cambiado y si deberdad  exsiste el amor  que  el dice tener por ti  y na   dalepalante intentelo denuevo que  la  vida es una sola y si esta   juntos a  el es mucho mejor  no  pierdas la  oportunidad que  te brinda la vida|`|76be71e1fe2aae60388308181ef3307faa	Bueno es que no explicas si el hace 6 a?os te fue infiel o simplemente se termino la relacion, pero yo creo que no podemos confiar al 100% en ningun ser humano, todos llegamos a mentir y a traicionar en algun momento de nuestra vida, pero si lo quieres o deseas estar con el, pues disfrutalo <br>  Suerte|`|7cf103aa5d445384d1861dd7e0b41dfaaa	Es bien dificil generalizar, te sugiero que, como tu tienes ahora el control de la situacion, te concentres en lo que tu misma sientes, personalmente, soy hombre, y si, si soy fiel, aunque nadie nos crea, en tu situacion, yo imagino que debes ver primero que es lo que tu misma sientes, pero a la primera situacion en que te sientas mal.  Hablarlo mucho y muy bien.<br>  Yo andaria con mucho cuidado.<br>  Suerte y animo!|`|809b7081371ff50d6fe1379d75e82eecaa	eso es casi casi IMPOSIBLE!...|`|AA10059786	Sí.

Pero yo creo que hay personas que si son fieles. Y en tu caso, que volvio despues de 6 a?os, tal vez cambio, y maduro, eso es bueno. Pero si fueras vos, no volveria con el tan facil, hace que te insita como se lo merece una mujer despues de que fue enga?ada, porque si te entregas facilmente, lo va a voler a hacer, supongo. <br>  Yo estoy hace muchos a?os con mi novio, y siempre le fui fiel, y el a mi tambien, lo se y le creo. Mas alla de que tuve dudas, el me jura que no y que no lo haria. Y siempre me lo jura por su mama que fallecio hace unos a?os.

Eso de ser fiel ya esta pasando de moda y no se nos esta dando mucho ultimamente, asi que hay que platicar mucho cuales son las necesidades que cada uno tiene de esa manera sea la pareja las que las satisfaga, es mejor...

Ainda existe! Mas voce me dá licen?a para te revelar uma verdade terrivel?! Pois bem: Ainda tem homens que se matém fiel a uma única parceira, mas esses homens, geralmente, dormem no sofa e n?o comem as suas mulheres quando elas querem. E as mulheres desses homens logo se esquecem do sexo ou fingem se esquecer. Há outra categoria de homens que só mantém uma parceira sexual; s?o os  recem-casados com mulheres dominadoras e essencialmente gostosas. Mas estes, depois de um certo tempo, n?o muito, mudam o perfil. O homem que só tem uma parceira é um masturbador inveterado ou n?o come ninguem. As mulheres que buscam homens que só mantem uma parceira sexual, necessitam fazer uma escolha: Querem um frouxo ou um tarado comedor? RESUMINDO: A fidelidade masculina, diferente da fidelidade feminina, n?o está nos genitais, mas no comportamento, no compromisso, no amor que mantiver pela parceira. O homem, diferente da mulher, faz sexo pelo o puro prazer de chegar ao gozo. é capaz, diferente da mulher,de fazer sexo todos os dias, se tiver tes?o, com quem n?o gosta. Uma ultima coisa: o homem pode amar loucamente uma mulher e n?o gostar de fazer sexo com ela; e é capaz de comer uma mulher com muito tes?o e depois, socialmente, n?o ter coragem de lhe dar bom dia. Esta é toda a verdade da natureza masculina; o homem que discordar disso, n?o esta sendo sincero ou ainda n?o se conhece.|`|932a1feb307cc376320b0c3b7ec7dea8aa	Sim, todos os homens traem, se algum disser pra vc que será eternemente fiel por certo estará mentindo, eu poderia até jurar fidelidade eterna pra vc mas isso seria somente para te conquistar e ganhar a tua confian?a, na verdade as mulheres que devem parar pra pensar e analisar duas vezes antes de acreditar no que um homem fala, afinal ninguém é perfeito.|`|d62f5e62e18f8fc409f9f4625256f97aaa	tem homens que s?o fieis as mulheres,mas eu acho que a maioria dos homens que n?o encontram em casa oque gostariam de encontrar,oque v?o fazer,v?o trair sim e mesmo acontece com as mulheres.Na minha opini?o eu acho que a trai??o n?o deveria existir,mas como os desejos do ser humano é mais forte que si mesmo ,isso vai longe.|`|dca62d7597ec1435fe7c233d0ba73f12aa	Toda regra tem sua excess?o, e neste caso n?o é diferente.<br>  O que ocorre nos dias atuais é que as pessoas est?o banalizando demais o relacionamento a dois, colocando inclusive o sexo só como prazer, quando na realidade o sexo tem sua importantancia fundamental no relacionamento, mais n?o é tudo.

AA11450203	If your fiance truly loves you then she will tell her guy friend the limits of the relationship and how important that you are to her life and that he is not going to get between the two of you.  That is her obligation.  If she fails to set the ground rules, then I would reconsider marrying this woman in the first place.  Because is she trully loves you, noone would be able to come between the two of you.

She can either accept it, and stick around anyway - or go on her merry way, and look for a more committment-minded person.|`|cebea3a8e8113acc7b540c298907a6c7aa	Yes, you are perfect in the age department. Women are more mature than men at the same age so you are in the ballpark. That doesn't mean your immature. Both stable, and you don't live with Momma. Everything is perfect but I would suggest that you consider buying a house. If it's as small as an apartment the price per month won't change that much and you build equity. Have you talked about family planning? Don't pop the question till both of you are on the same page there.

Marriage isn't all about money and a home, granted, they are important, but love for the other makes the marrage worth everything and it also helps when you have problems with the home or money issues.  <br>  <br>  Get engaged...see how it feels to know that you are to spend the rest of your lives together, no one can force you into something like this.  If you are meant to be..so be it.  But if things are missing, things could get really iffy and drastic.

The reason you are asking is because you are asking yourself if you really want to do it and you'd like someone else to decide for you. It would be very hard to disappoint your girlfriend, but in the long run you would be doing both her and you a favor.|`|047af378b1100d1b95a75ee7b2a4db21aa	You know when you're ready.

In the individual, toping is regarded with disesteem, but toping nations are in the forefront of civilization and power. When pitted against the hard-drinking Christians the absemious Mahometans go down like grass before the scythe. In India one hundred thousand beef- eating and brandy-and-soda guzzling Britons hold in subjection two hundred and fifty million vegetarian abstainers of the same Aryan race. With what an easy grace the whisky-loving American pushed the temperate Spaniard out of his possessions! From the time when the Berserkers ravaged all the coasts of western Europe and lay drunk in every conquered port it has been the same way: everywhere the nations that drink too much are observed to fight rather well and not too righteously.

But I'd draw the line when he starts meeting other girls from the internet you know. Go talk to him. If he's serious about you and your relationship, he'll lay off the "other stuff".

The hidden life is almost always dark<br>  2.  The hidden life requires that he live a lie<br>  3.  The hidden life means you have a false relationship<br>  4.

And as this "secret" girl, have you ever asked him if he has a girlfriend?|`|171011390db93301b72ea0bf78524738aa	If it was me I would as him up font what he is playing at and then see what he has to say for him self.<br>  <br>  If I was the secret girl first thing I would ask is if he has a girlfriend and what he is looking for on the site.|`|aa473249b693a810091d265ac9972588aa	continue to chat with him and eventually try to meet with him... if he does meet with you, as his email buddy, then you know exactly where you stand and should break up with him.. sorry, but that's the facts.|`|ca04fb4375fb954bbfca701c7977cda7aa	I kinda agree with Sweetgurl.  Ask him if he has a girlfriend, and see what he says.  Take it from there.|`|ff4f681d12abd15830f84b3b962c0a1daa	Approach him, and talk to him about the situation.|`|0a6fd07ba97715287ec7f12264de3d9caa	I think one question you should ask is "Do you have a girlfriend?"  And you know exactly what to do if he says "No" right?  But on the other hand.. checking up on him like that will make him feel that you don't trust him.  The only thing you can do I guess is to confront him straight out.  If he argues, defends himself, and gets mad at you, then he's not worth it because if he loves you and knows that you love him, then it is only natural for you to want to know the truth.|`|77142c0708938bed0f7e2d1a5b9e5d32aa	Maybe if conversations save you could check up on them? you dont wanna be to sneaky.. it could lead to arguments about not trusting eachother... if its bothering you that he is talking to girls on the net.. then you shoudnt tlk to guys... i dont know... maybe try the convo saving thing.. if it dont work.. talk to him|`|7eb520cf7fbf882d4215c979e314c017aa	talk to him as secret girl and see how far he is willing to go. you never know you may be supprised?? he might just be talking to these girls and nothing else. if he is willing to go further confront him|`|9c37839cb850d3a78d07ab325af769caaa	What the???????

fc4NOCp3aa	Well first of all, don't ever say "I'm just a guy."  I know we live in a society that constantly degrades & belittles men into thinking they have zero intelligence but YOU don't have to buy into that.  I'm sure there are those will read this post & think "she's crazy - our society doesn't do that."  No?  All you have to do is turn on the t.v. to see how many shows have the woman as the strong, intelligent person and then there's her whacky, stupid, usually fat husband who just says dumb things.  Anyway, enough of that!  That's not what you asked about! :) <br>  <br>  When women say they aren't "in love" w/ a guy, it means, she's not passionate for him....he doesn't stir something in her soul.....he doesn't give her the butterflies in her stomach that are there when you're really falling in love with someone....and it means she just really loves him as a friend.  When they say they "love" the guy but aren't in love, they mean they CARE for the guy really....they want to see him happy, successful, and they care enough to perhaps let him go.  To me, I think that takes alot of courage.  There are those women who will string a guy along KNOWING they aren't in love with him just so they aren't alone or because they're afraid they might not find anyone better.  Would you want that?  I wouldn't if I were a guy!!  Heck no!  My mom taught me that the minute you know a guy isn't "the one", it's time to let him go b/c it's not FAIR to the guy!  Every day that you hold him back is a day that he could be out there finding the TRUE love of his life so in many ways, when a girl dumps you, it can be a huge FAVOR although I know it doesn't feel that way in the moment.<br>  <br>  I hope that helped!|`|PshRhxqraa	In my experience it means they have found someone new and have remembered what it's like to be 'in love' again.  Of course that doesn't last...and that turns into love (hopefully) but some people seem to go on forever searching for the 'in love' bit, casting aside the people they genuinely love to experience that thrilling new love.|`|obXAeNW5aa	it means exactly that u can love some one and not be in love with them and there is a difference haven't u ever met someone but the something feeling just wasn't there and no matter how u try it just never is that what we are talking about so u could love him like a brother or just a good friend|`|TpcrI3rKaa	i love him but im not in love means there is no more love as a couple but  they might have some thing that is going to be there For ever like kids so ...... they have to like each other for all the work is going to be need to raise dose kids....|`|3fbc09a4f95e4122e563714d654a599eaa	She love you because you are the father of her child or she loves you for the person you are however she is not in love with you.

Like you truely care about them deeply, you just don't have romantic feelings for the person.|`|6xQI445baa	It means that you are her girl friend not her boyfriend.|`|d28f15ee4fdbf2944e40df8ba2e01a24aa	If I did that I might have to go into this big huge ordeal,and then I'D CRY!|`|pJcbV2cnaa	When a girl says to you that she loves you but is not in love with you. She means that she mostly cares for you and loves you but not in a romantic way. when youre in love with someone you picture yourself with that person and you want to be with that person so when a girl tells you she loves you but is not in love with you she does not picture herself with you even though she cares for you. Kinda hard to explain but I was one of those girls who said the same thing.|`|OSPS9BWlaa	Easy!<br>  You can love a mom, dad, brother and a friend but you are not IN love with them right?<br>  If you hear that, that would be the same. A person that loves someone as a friend but they are not In love. Love without the butterflies...<br>  <br>  Did it help? :-)|`|ed0955174428e55e7e6205da49319b6eaa	It means that she loves you as a person, but doesn't love you as in a romantic/physical relationship.

They are trying to say the fire has gone out and the excitement is gone. What they don't understand is that the excitement is mental. Their attitude is what has changed, and that can be easy to control. Love is a decision we make. The best thing that parents can do for their children is to love each other and to strive to keep the fire burning.|`|m4T0IT0yaa	I'm a woman and I don't get it.  I personally think it's a cop-out if you ask me.  Saying, "I love him but I'm not in love with him" sounds better than "I just don't love him anymore."  So it's a cop-out to make the person saying it feel better about themselves.  It helps to alleviate their guilt.|`|c3474cd1d5137c5d6298fa6134dcf3c8aa	It means she cares deeply for him, cares about his happiness, care about his future. However she is not romantically interested in him any more.|`|1o3OqSioaa	I can explain this because I said this to my ex-husband. He left me and broke my heart into a million pieces. I spent 16 yrs. and another failed marraige trying to get over him. Finally, I met another guy who made my heart flutter when I would see him, and when he kissed me, I would go weak in the knees. He was so wonderful to my kids, and me that as hard as I tried not to fall "in love" with him, I fell hard for him. My heart did a big ole' flip flop one evening as we strolled hand in hand through a small charming tourist town lit up by christmas lights, and I knew that I was "in love." We were 1 week away from getting married, when my first husband called crying, apologizing, saying everything that I ever wanted to hear him say wanting me back. That's the moment that I realized that even though he still had a piece of my heart, that he was only someone that I used to be "in love" with, but I was totally "in love" with my fiancee, and wasn't interested in a life with my ex anymore. I didn't think of him as someone that I could trust with my heart, he couldn't make me feel secure, and I wasn't turned on by him. He was someone that I still cared about very deeply as a friend now, so I told him that I would always love him as a friend, but that I wasn't in love with him, that I was marrying my fiancee. My fiancee heard me say that "I love you" to my ex. He asked what was going on, and I told him the truth. He said that my ex and I could be friends, but that he'd never better show up on our doorstep. He'd had his chance and blew it, and my fiancee said he wasn't going to blow his. I fell even deeper "in love" for his understanding, and his marking his territory (so to speak). I only feel compassion, and care about how my ex is doing in his life. I truly want him to be happy, and find someone who will be "in love" with him and he with her.<br>  On the other hand, I would not feel so charitable with my husband whom I am "in love" with. I would want him to eat dirt and die a horrible, excrutiatinglly painful death if he found someone else to love.<br>  I guess that's the true difference in what being in love is compared to loving someone. I hope this clears it up for you, and doesn't scare the h** out of you.
568c8fefc9b572cf5b933c7c676dcd1faa	I wish I had a better answer for you...my wife cheated on me and no matter what she does or says I will not trust or forgive her.|`|AA11899639	if you loved him very much- you wouldn't have cheated! the best thing to do know is talk and see if you are both willing to forgive & forget or this will not work out--good luck|`|24zvWEDHaa	Cheating always causes a rift. It's a very unwise decision to make and it affects many more people then it first appears. My husband had an affair and it has been a long journey towards moving beyond it. I dont know if the complete trust will ever be regained. It's a touchy situation.<br>  <br>  You make it right for your child to have a relationship with the father and you leave it to the father to offer his trust to YOU again. You can't make him trust you again, EVER. If he is ready and willing then he will come around.<br>  <br>  It can work but both parties have to want it with all their hearts.|`|d4baa570e228ef8bb8a2c4d28c935c7aaa	If you love this person as much as you say you do, then you wouldn't cheat.|`|tiT0plNGaa	just say the truth.another thing is not to be gone long and when u r call and let him know whats going on.Good luck!!

Just let it feel right now and I'm sure that there will comes a time that ...that feelings will go. Don't force yourself to forget him because the more you tell yourself to forget him..the more he become stronger on your mind. Just continue hanging out with your friends, it might help.

In college, at work, everywhere. Actually, let's not say 'friends' let's just say relationships. I mean, even if you are shy or whatever, it might come off and snobby and stuck-up and no one wants to deal with anyone like that. You don't have to become BFF with anyone if you claim you're going to be out of their in 5 months. But do you really want to end your high school career by thinking, "Oh she was a nice girl but I'm glad I'm not friends with her b/c I'm probably never going to see her ever again." Honestly, that's not a good outlook to have in life and from you just saying that, it doesn't really sound like your shy, it makes you seem selfish and you only have time in the world for yourself.|`|cd57c0d6cde8338aee3c16aad5dc23fdaa	I guess that you're the loner sort of person? If it makes you happier, then don't force yourself to make friends. I suggest that you stay open though; you never know when you might meet a really nice person. You can't really just go out and grab friends. You have to find people you genuinely like.<br>  <br>  People are telling you it's a bad idea because most people want friends, and friends are a major part of their lives. They possibly don't understand that maybe you'd rather be on your own. I still encourage that you try though, even if its just a little. They tell you its a bad idea because, contrary to what you said, that in "five months and [you'll] be out of there," high school friends, good high school friends, are the ones you have for life. If you're happy the way you are, then I guess that's fine. If you still want friends, just keep an eye out, and try to enjoy yourself with other activities! I hope everything works out for you! ^__^

You could also gently say, thank you for your feelings, but you need to move on to someone that will also feel that way, because I do not. How long has he been holding on after you let go ? It is often harder for one person or the other to let go when they love another person. Friends email you. If you want to be friends, tell him that is it , friendship only, no intimacy, no intimate contact, no intimate talks or emails. Platonic friendship is all you want, and if he continues, refuse to open his emails and you may have to accept that he does not know how to change his feelings into friendly ones. Sometimes people need a lot of time before they can be friends with someone whom they have hurt over, sometimes they cannot ever be just friends, and if thats the case, time will tell you that. Be gentle, as long as he is not harming you. If he starts abusing you, take it to the law.|`|1abbcbeb71d4c6391f08cecf920c454aaa	dont know but if u find out let me know|`|f89d4f5c188eba1d7a91133da1e5f350aa	Explain clearly your intentions of being friends if she continues to<br>  act the same cut her off.|`|AA11689215	Sex his sister.|`|aea695a82c7fdebee26d1e328fca8986aa	Send a final emai that says "I don't think it's good we communicate anymore as I'd like to move on" and then block him.|`|959aa1dd339abea5649d3c29ae274b7aaa	Stop reading the emails and delete them off the computer.

ef3e8a055f877ac48bf7cb67749b1830aa	I'd definitely consider leaving San Diego.  Are you wanting indoor or outdoor?  What month?<br>  <br>  Some considerations-<br>  a cruise ship- San Diego has several that leave from there and the cruise plus wedding could be as little as 3000.<br>  <br>  Balboa Park if you like outdoor<br>  <br>  Where do the local high schools have prom?  We have ours at a Shrine Templer (Shriners) and it rents for about 1000 here.  Though you'd need caterering and decor but how much you do there is up to you.<br>  <br>  A beach wedding again if you like outdoor.  The permit for many beaches is around $50-75.  A minister roughly $200.<br>  <br>  Consider renting out a restaurant or a nightclub.  My cousin did that and it's not as expensive as you would think plus you save since you don't have to decorate it.  Especially look at booking around noon a restaurant that does not open for lunch, only dinner.  Consider a smaller nightclub that does not do much business or just renting out one room of the club.  Many clubs around here have one room that plays country and one that plays normal club Top 40 stuff.  <br>  <br>  How many people are you talking about?<br>  <br>  Also look into historic homes.  There are often a lot of restrictions in historic homes (like no dancing and only certain areas you can set up food in) but they often rent very inexpensively.  Here less than $500 a night.<br>  <br>  Another thing to consider in San Diego is to rent a vacation property.  If your wedding is off season (not the peak summer rental) the rental price changes dramatically.  I'm on the east coast but here most beach properties have Winter price, spring/fall price, low summer (may and august when most kids are still in school) and high summer (june, july).  So the rate could be more than 50% less than it is High Summer.  Plus you'd have a place for some people to stay and it would be really easy to get stuff caterered.  You could get married on the deck or beach in front, dine inside, and both parents could crash inside.  My sister looked into doing this when she decided to get married on the beach.  She has since decided on a cruise ship wedding.<br>  <br>  Vegas is very nice too.  Again they have chapels that can rent from anything--$100-10,000 it just requires some pre planning.<br>  <br>  How many guests is probably the first thing to figure out though.|`|w1necKzYaa	get your family to do a buffet instead of caterer's and forgo the favours and go with a small amount of decorations!|`|4ec7418aca20a0d4c9b979bf6a9d4d4eaa	Many city parks have nice pavillions, or community centers that are nice places for a wedding reception/ceremony and they're pretty inexpensive for residents.  You can also go to www.theknot.com, and there are local planning guides and local resources for most major metropolitan areas in the US.  The words "nice" and "affordable" have different meanings to different folks, plus not knowing where you're wanting to have your wedding makes it impossible to give you specifics.|`|cCymTwdcaa	Here are some place idea, non-specific since I'm an East Coaster:<br>  <br>  Churches<br>  Old Mansions<br>  B&B yard/garden<br>  Libraries<br>  Parks<br>  Pubs<br>  Art Galleries<br>  Musuems<br>  Menageries/Zoos <br>  Beach <br>  Woods, Mountain Top, Waterfalls if you have any nearby.<br>  Caves (some of the most beautiful weddings have been in caves).|`|AkUhaMm9aa	it all depends where you live..and if you want outdoor /indoor wedding...tell us more about your wedding ?|`|d1TTwwUUaa	give us some idea or budget your working with|`|eRBn7orfaa	You can often book a Elks lodge for a reasonable amount.

I love flirty boys..|`|hnc7Epqdaa	If you feel shy its okay, one way or another we all feel things and that doesnt set us apart or makes us different from one another, in fact we are still unique in our ways. Before you even began to think about girls it will be pretty good to work on yourself. What I mean by this, is work on your self esteem, boost it up and get confidence. Nothing will halp you more than this. why? because when we go out and talk and meet people with a great character we automatically feel an attachment to that person and its not just out of ordinary its because we found something in that person that we liked. Be it there kindness, the way they look anything. What do those people have that you dont? guess! I hope this was your answer (nothing) they have nothing you dont have. Most of the time we see more of our flaws than our great qualities, and yes we all have them. The thing here is your afraid to show them, thats why working on your self esteem will help tremendously because you will be getting more connected to our feelings and what we want, ready to experience joys and disappointments, and ready to cry and to love all because we have the confidence to believe in ourselves and know that we are unique. If you do go and look for girls in any place as some have suggested here, dont go people shopping. What I mean by this? here is an example, when you go into a mall and you see a cool shirt which really caught your attention, after you check it out do you go an put it on the counter without knowing if it will be $50, or $100 or more or do you check the price? pretty much we all check the price thats okay. Now people and clothes are not the same. When you look at somebody you wont know for sure how that person is and what qualities they poses. Therefore thats where we have to give each other the time to get to know the person and for that person to get to know us be it friends, dating or else. Instead of judging over there clothes, there hair or else the most important is for us to get to know the person. Some of us do, others dont. But when we dont we truly never get to know the uniqueness of that other person. Therefore I suggest for you to work on yourself and then on the world. The expriences well be fascinating as you will go out to the world or say the dating world being sure of what you want and who you are and no one will be able to play with that image of yyours because you will be strong enough. One more thing dont go people shopping, see others as you would like to be seeing, no labels. I am working on myself to and the experience is getting better each time. You can search for articles on line about boosting your confidence before you head out there, or you can even find books. The truth is you will notice the important qualities you poses and you will know who you truly are sadly, some people never give themselves the opportunity to do so. Here's a web you can check out as well is all about the mystery of womans and how to understand them speacially when you get into a relationship (David De Angelo.com)|`|8vhzpMIsaa	all you need to do is become friend with some people and i know that you might think you like girls for there looks but if you get to know some not so popular people then you can get to like them and try to meet people that you mite have thought were to good for you because they might actually like you for who you are and not your looks because looks don't matter only personality.|`|3TG46TOnaa	People are people, i don't understand why you haven't spoken 2 a girl before!

AA11412999	Virgo and Scorpio?  Astrological signs are based upon such beliefs as the gods (plural "gods" = polytheism) resided in the various planet and the alignment of the planets in the heavens (AKA space) impacted our lives here on earth.  If this is somehow proved to me, I'll maybe consider it, but until then the astrological forecasts in the paper provide nothing more for me than a good chuckle.  Did you know a good friend of mine was once hired to write those?  She was NOT an astrologist...just very creative. ;)<br>  <br>  Do some serious thinking about marriage before you jump in.  It means making a life-long change to the way you think and live.  You are promising to be someone's best friend, protector, and advocate for the rest of your natural lives.  I personally don't feel that many people are truly incompatible.  Most peole COULD get along together if they really had their heads in the right place (all people are deserving of unconditional love, because God is able to love us unconditionally),  but this is often not the case.<br>  <br>  Please do some VERY serious thinking and praying before you make such a decision.|`|924ce7ad76f5ca6a50c440c80186f35eaa	star signs aint true and they don't affect your love life...enjoy yourself with him, don't worry about the supernatural!

AA10699062	Hi Johnny Knoxville, question 43!<br>  Yes.  <br>  Yes.<br>  Yes.<br>  :D<br>  <br>  I like to be in control, so I like to drive.  I don't always get to do so, however, so I tend to not pay attention to what the driver is doing because it stresses me out - and there's enough stress in my life without me adding more!  When I'm driving and someone does, or says something, I normally just slow down, look at them and ask them who's driving, or say something about the car having only one steering wheel, etc.<br>  <br>  Maybe when it's time for you to take your Mom anywhere, you should take a nerve pill to chill out, so that when your driving whigs her out, you don't get whigged out yourself.  :D<br>  <br>  good luck to you Johnny Knoxville!!!!|`|AA11899639	what are hads??|`|0ee5e5ecfdf8e873dba1f94f9312816eaa	I can not drive while  my sister is in the car.she make me nerveous.anytime i turn she grabs the dash also and freaks out.<br>  but i guess i do kinda drive like a mad woman.|`|a33d25db8cab57795952da38b2dd2415aa	I am a nervous passenger and I cannot help it.  I think it is all in my head because it is not that I don't trust the person driving it is just that I don't trust the people in the other cars on the road.  And I think that a big part of it is because I am not behind the wheel, so I don't feel like I have control of my life at that specific moment.  It's weird, and I don't know how to control it completely, but I am getting better!|`|dc1dc0e91497dd670ae7abafbe5e2e4daa	haha my Mom is kinda like that when I drive! She makes me so nervious!

Hope she learns to chill so you can to.

If you live near a theme park, spend a day there! If nice, find some go-carts, lazer tag and other fun and active things. All that is funner than any house party... no matter how old you are turning.<br>  <br>  If the above is completely out of the question and you are having a house party, one big thing that always makes parties great is the food. Step outside of the ordinary coke-and-pizza. There are lots of delicious snacks that are unique and memorable. The key is variety - a rule of thumb is 1 different "kind" of food for every 3 people. Break out a cook book for some good ideas. I think music is fairly obvious, but don't overdue it. Have same games set up that everyone can enjoy... Wii or that Rockband game have been big hits recently for teen and early adult party.|`|HKkbqlIuaa	Well, it depends if you would like to do something in the house or go out somewhere. <br>  <br>  If you want to go out:<br>  <br>  - You guys could go out to eat and then go bowling.<br>  - Depending on what state you live in, you could go to the club.<br>  - You guys could go to a local hooka bar, if you have one and are interested in stuff like that.<br>  - You could go play pool.<br>  - In Texas we have something called Main Event. They have bowling, lazer tag, pool tables, video games, shuffleboard, etc. That's always a nice place to go because everyone can have fun.<br>  - Of course, you could go to a nice restaurant. <br>  - You could go to the nearest big city and just spend the day there. Go to the mall, museums, or any attractions the city has to offer.- If there's a carnival or amusement park nearby, you could spend the day there. <br>  - Ride gokarts<br>  <br>  If you want to stay in:<br>  <br>  - Order pizza. <br>  - If it's close friends, you guys can just hang out and do all the stuff you enjoy. <br>  - Play games, watch movies, dance, etc.<br>  - If you like to drink, you could get some alcohol.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Well, I hope my ideas helped you out some. I'm not sure what you and your friends like to do, so it's kind of hard to offer advice.

And if you really love that person moving on with out trying to help that person understand love and feel love is something that you will have to work a little hard if that's really what you want. Without trust, I mean really trusting your heart and believing in what you feel love will find it's way, don't be afraid of it. Don't second guess it, just fell it. I mean really feel it.

It will make us better people, more understanding, kinder.<br>  Time does heal.  You don't need to deny that you loved someone.

The man I was with for 7 years cheated on me, and told me about it after the girl was 9 months pregnant. We tried to work through it, but he wouldn't stop seeing her. It hurts really bad. I am just taking it one day at a time. I keep telling myself that there is someone out there better for me. We also have three children together. When he told me this I was about 6 wks pregnant with our third child. I got so upset that I almost lost her. After that I had alot of problems with my pregnancy. Just take it one day at a time.

My ex of four years and I broke up a year and six months ago, and up to now i still love him very much and i can't get him off my mind. His pictures are still in my iPod..i always listen to the songs we used to love..i still visit his cousins who are very close to me. Obviously, i haven't moved on yet. Sometimes become bitter and i want to curse love. I mean, you get that feeling that you gave everything yet your everything still isn't enough to make him stay. You tried to be perfect but still you're trying in vain. It's really hard, and you get the big phobia of falling in love again and risk getting hurt again.<br>  <br>  My advice? Deal with it. Time heals all the wounds and so should you. You can't rush into moving on, you have to pass through several stages until you could say 'i survived!'. By now im sure you have the mottos 'love sucks', 'love is stupidity' etc....<br>  <br>  1.) throw away all his mementos, photos, and eveything that reminds you of him.<br>  2.)

Keep a list of all the bad things he did to you and tack them next to your bed.<br>  6.) Sever all of your communications with him.<br>  7.)

0a00f2668197953c559c78273f974721aa	I'm going through the same thing.  We haven't been intimate. You didn't mention if you have been.  There's a reason why I am asking.  If you have had sex then it's likely things may not work because what started badly ends badly.  I hope in your case it does work because I feel your pain.  If you haven't had sex then you need to ask yourself if you are willing to "wait" and put your life on hold for this man who has already told you in a sense that he's not leaving.  If you want him in your life that way and if you are ok with that then go for it.  You will know when you need to leave.  Do I believe in fate, destiny and true love?  I recognize that fate can bring two people together, but in the end BOTH need to decide your destiny.

He can go to jail, and will not be allowed to live with you anymore.  If your Mom won't protect you, then let someone else protect you!  Tell everyone!!! Go into your favorite teacher or your guidance counselor or your school nurse or your grandparents or your birth Dad or your friend's parents today!  If the person you tell doesn't help you, go to someone else!   He can't sell you to anyone (especially if he's in jail, which is where he's going to be if he puts his hands on you).  <br>  <br>  You have done nothing wrong in this.  If your Mom gets mad at you, it just shows that she's brainwashed or something.  She's being a really terrible Mom if she doesn't protect you.  Not everyone is a great Mom, but it's her problem not yours.<br>  <br>  Can't help with the internet history.  You can delete your search history and postings on your own sites, but can't delete stuff on other sites unless you contact Webmasters for those sites and ask.

Dose he believe in GOD?  The reason I ask because what give him the right to do these things to you. And your mom let him too. She is being crazy i mean any mother who in their mind right  will never allow that to happen. So the only things is tell someone else  (older) in your family that you could trust that could help you or another adult but if this information   of yours get into the law hands you might end up somewhere were you don't want to be  or some other places that you might want to live.

She might also be afraid for herself, but that is no excuse to go on allowing it to happen. <br>  Your home should always be a safe haven.|`|955875037481fa5fb2c9c0e960a79f63aa	Yes he can get into trouble, lots of trouble.  You should call police, but do it from school. So you dont get caught calling them.  I've been there, but it was just a sick step grandfather.  To delete internet history, on my computer I go to control panel, security center, internet options then under general tab push the delete button for history, cookies and temporary files. Please call the police i was sexually molested from the age 14 to 18 years old before I told anyone. That long of a time can really screw you up and ruin your life. Don't let that happen to you.
9e2130ec276925af9eb23573fa721694aa	Put off your marriage until you can work out this issue. What's done is done, and you can't keep on being resentful, it's just not healthy. The whole "time alone" BS was a pretty low-blow thing on your part, I don't blame her for being angry, and getting even with you. Sounds like she made a good use of the "time alone" that was imposed on her, and you have to get over it. If you don't, it will destroy your relationship eventually. I don't know if counseling would be something you'd consider, perhaps it's worth a shot.|`|1165ba31b143ba80c9a0b9bcf2908730aa	No matter how much you want to marry someone, rushing the person isn't cool.  I think she was wrong, in the first place, for not backing off gracefully, and giving you a little space to think things through.<br>  <br>  As for her having sex with someone else, I guess that's her right, but I would be concerned about her motivation.  She wanted to teach you a lesson?<br>  <br>  After you are married, she may decide to teach you another lesson, because she doesn't feel like you're spending enough time with her, or because she doesn't like the way you looked at another woman, or you had an argument about the finances.<br>  <br>  The bottom line is, she thinks having sex with someone else is a legitimate way of getting back at you, anytime she is unhappy about something.  I think you're asking for trouble, if you go through with this marriage.|`|AA10928914	She seems like a skank! "She said he was sweet and wanted to thank him" WTF??

800607246df3ce3c65b01624978cb3dcaa	So you've had a pretty wild few years. <br>  We've all been there. The trick is to know when enough is enough. The result of not knowing when to stop, i.e. Peter Stringfellow, is not a good look! <br>  You say you are now looking for a more serious "adult" relationship, so you have obviously realised that the time has now come. <br>  The reason that you feel guilty after casual sex is because you know, subconsciously or otherwise, that you have just used another human being for your own ends. Sure, she was up for it too, but in a sense you were dishonest with her about your feelings for her. Sex is supposed to be an expression of love, or, at the very least, intense desire, but these women you so easily "got naked" you felt very little for. <br>  You know this because it contrasts so strongly with the way you act and feel around the girls you genuinely desire. Acting wacky sounds to me like you have an issue with self-confidence at times. We all have a certain situation where we feel less confident and we all have our own ways of dealing with it. It sounds like you deal with it by trying just a bit too hard. <br>  Remember two things: we build confidence by facing our fears and overcoming them; also, the 'right' person (or people) will accept us and love us the way we are. With the right person you won't feel the need to be a weirdo.<br>  Keep trying with the girls you like and make them see there is more to you than some joke-cracking loony. The more you talk to them the more you will relax and the more chance you have of finding the relationship you want.|`|vIivJkO5aa	go find girls in coffee shops instead of bars and clubs.|`|PA7kYyAxaa	Maybe you should talk to a professioanl counselour or your parish Priest|`|avdgNTMfaa	it seems to me like maybe you need to get to know youself better as an individual before you came become a couple. i dont mean offense by that either. a lot of people have the same problem with letting people get to know them. you should try taking it slow when u meet a girl, jumping in bed can ruin the chances of a really great relationship, it happens all the time. Im 21 yrs old married and have a kid lol so i have no fear of committment but before i met my husband he was 16 nd had slept with about 12 girls and said he had the same issue...anyway if i were u i would stop lookin for the one who will be the one night stand and start looking for the one who will be the one---at least for a while lol|`|hF6uZqWRaa	well you just need to learn how to control your self (your body) and remind your self you want serious and not a one night stand... you know they say sex can be addictive... i know my ex got all into it and started having sex with random women and thats when i broke up with him. (when i found out)... wish you the best. also, maybe theres something you do or say that give them the vibe you just want to sleep with them and not be serious...try finding out what it is and change it. it wont be easy.|`|b99c02d2efcaf0924dc72f729d7ae118aa	wow, if the chances of getting a sexually transmitted disease and HIV / AIDS doesn't scare you, then i'd say you're a hopeless man-whore.

What kind of woman do you want to end up with?  What kind of lady do you want raising you children (some day) (if you want kids at all)? Do you want your kids to act like you do?  Do you want to marry a woman that will jump in the sack with you, only days after meeting you (if that's the case..not trying to judge you, here.)<br>  <br>  <br>  I am not telling you what to do...Im just suggesting some questions you might ask yourself.  In closing, I would add one more thing: all the sex in the world will not fil the need for a legitimate relationship....a good, solid, relationship where you talk, share your thoughts and dreams, and need each other (for something other than sex)<br>  Have a good weekend.|`|o6bl7Nkwaa	I'm going to try and NOT be an ******le for you and answer your question.

Think of the people you hurt.|`|IDfQko2Zaa	I'm a woman and I know what is right<br>  It sounds like the women you have been sleeping with o no want a proper relationship and they are like you, they don't care about anything else apart form that one night.<br>  You should go for different women.<br>  You sound like you are just doing the same stupid mistake over and over again. Go for a girl who is different than your normal choice. Go for someone who you wouldn't normally even think about sleeping with, because you don't just want to sleep with her. Talk with her and see how that feels. If you are finding the conversation awkward then it means that you two aren't right as you can't chat properly.<br>  You also need to try harder, it isn't just the girls you are going for that is the mistake, you obviously aren't showing yourself in the right way. You will be coming across in the wrong way which is attracting the wrong kind of attention.<br>  The reason you will be feeling guilty after sleeping with her is because you actually want to be in a proper relationship, you want someone who cares for you. It does not feel great for you now knowing you are just with people who don't care for you, don't want a future with you. Barely even know you.<br>  Just try something different to what you normally would and don't sleep with the girl!|`|pLD3pYsuaa	U should try taking easy with a girl, don't try to get into her pants to early in the relationship, maybe if u take it easy with a girl, the girl can get to know u better and see what u're really about. <br>  <br>  U problably have a reputation by now, so girls can't confide in u too, so try to prove yourself to the girl u like that you're not just into getting in her pants.|`|eSI9c4Ncaa	First of all, take a deep breath and calm down. It's not as bad as it seems, what you're doing is no different than what other young men your age are doing. I think it's commendable that you would want to find a more self restrained dating style, but after all you're only 19. Soon you'll be in a place where you'll have more opportunities than before to engage in casual, sexual relationships. If you slip up and end up with 20, please don't beat yourself up too much.<br>  <br>  The issue you should be most concerned with is (1) health, yours and that of your partner, out of respect for her and you always use protection. <br>  <br>  Next you should be concerned with (2) honesty. Always be sure that the person you're involved with knows where the "relationship" is going. Whether it be a one-night stand or something long-term. Whichever it is be sure that you can live up to it.<br>  <br>  Lastly, if you really want to slow it down and find a serious, love-filled relationship you have to (3) try. T.R.Y. three little letters that mean so much. The only person that can make you stop before you go seeking out shallow, physical pleasure is you. Try to initiate and create a friendship before you take it to a sexual level. If you start off with a friendship, it means that you respect that person and a person you respect you are more likely to treat accordingly.<br>  <br>  I hope that helps. Good luck suga<br>  <br>  <br>  (Wow, I didn't know I was so smart. Yay me!)

GQsDlFtzaa	Have your guest go to hotwire or priceline.  But you should get a block of rooms. You can work out a discount for the rooms.|`|ef3e8a055f877ac48bf7cb67749b1830aa	It's not necessary BAD not to block them but if you don't at least include a few hotels that are an easy drive, their phone numbers and directions from that hotel to the church/reception in the invite.  <br>  <br>  Some people put about 3 different nearby hotels.<br>  <br>  I mean obviously if you book a block, some people are going to not want to stay there anyway (perhaps they have a lot of Hilton points they want to use) but that's their choice.  <br>  <br>  Depending on where you live $98 a night might be a good deal.  I know when I was in Boston $200 a night was the best we could find.  You put your credit card down as a just in case.  If you are a fraud and no one shows up, they have put aside 25 rooms for a prank caller.  They don't charge your credit card other than a certain fee for being a prank caller (like the typical 10% restocking charge).<br>  <br>  Personally it's so common place for a bride to do that in consideration of her guests that I'd be a little shocked if one didn't but I don't consider a grave offense.|`|26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	I have never heard of blocked hotels at any out of the area wedding I have attended. From that I have been told, you shouldn't have to pay anything to block a hotel room. If someone does want your money when you do that, to go elsewhere asap. When you block rooms, you get a discount that you wouldn't otherwise. Also, places like Priceline, etc that advertise dirt cheap rooms don't always have nice hotels. They are typically the ones that have been picked over and no one wants to stay in.|`|4ec7418aca20a0d4c9b979bf6a9d4d4eaa	If you book (and you don't have to pay for) a block of rooms, you'll usually get them cheaper than guests booking their own individual rooms.  When you call a hotel to check their rates, you need to call the hotel directly, don't call the national reservation line (the 800 #).  Ask to speak to someone in their "group sales" department.  If you need more than 10 rooms for guests, they should give you a pretty decent discount, and you can set it up so that guests handle their bills themselves.  You don't HAVE to set this up in advance for your guests, but if you you know you're having a large enough group coming in from out of town, it's a nice thing to do for them.  You know the town, they don't--you know what hotel will be convenient for them to stay at, they don't.  It's just a nice thing to do for your guests, that's all.<br>  <br>  edit:  It's also easier for your guests who know each other to arrange car pooling to events if they're staying at the same property--also saves on their having to rent as many cars if they're flying in.|`|eRBn7orfaa	Usually if you can guarantee a certain number of rooms will be filled by your guests (# depending on the hotel) the hotel will give a reasonable discount. As a guest who has traveled to weddings in the past, it is nice to stay in the same hotel as other guests for the wedding.|`|Q8wDjvZ1aa	don't worry about it.  when you send out your invites have a card in them that lists local hotels with phone numbers or websites.  let guests choose where they want to stay.  for our friends wedding in niagara falls we were on our own for finding hotels, and it worked out perfectly because i found a cheaper place than every other guest.|`|5Vc1e0iPaa	Just depends where you live.  If it is a small town that only has one or two hotels then it might me necessary.  Where I live has tons of hotels so there was so point.  Just so long as there is not a risk of all the rooms in the town filling up most people are able to find their own hotel.

QtTvjLS4aa	Well it seems to me you are a bit down about not being able to spend as much money as they do and i say you shouldn't be. Yea some people are like that they think that you have to spend a lot of money to have a good time and in fact you don't. Five pound is more than enough to have a good time with your friends, basically all you want to do is get a little something to eat and have a good conversation with them, actually just being with your friends should be good enough fun. Well i would tell them that you rather do other stuff than go to the cinema, i mean going occasionally is ok i guess but all the time it just gets boring. Instead of letting them choose where to go you decide what you could do once in a while. Going out doesn't have to be costly, you and your friends can hang out and buy a meal at KFC or McDonald's from ￡2-￡4 actually and still have change left back. I would tell your friends that you think that they spend too much money when they go out and that you guys can have fun without spending so much. And i say if they can't understand that then you are friends with the wrong set of people and they aren't really your friends. You shouldn't let them make you feel bad and you shouldn't have to pretend to be someone you aren't either, and if they are really your friends then they will respect your decision and wouldn't think of you any less. If they do well it's time to get new friends. Hope i helped.
FLPRFTccaa	go for it. i did.|`|POHWTDPRaa	Absolutely do not have sex at least for a few years. Literally. What you feel is not love. It is typical new relationship giddiness. It happens to everyone. You will feel the same way at the beginning of your next relationship, and the one after that and the one after that... It doesn't mean anything. Not only is it too soon in the 'relationship,' it is too soon for you. You are still a child.

This is probably not the guy that you will marry someday and is he really mature enough to leave all his dreams behind so he can support you and a child that he probably doesn't even want at this point in his life. Sex should be more than a one night stand or even a temporary thing. Too much is riding on the choices that you make. He is going to be a kid for a few more years and so are you.

No one can make your decisions for you. I know girls that lost your virginity younger than you, and they weren't even going out with the guy. I think that if you're ready, that's your decision. Personally, I waited until I was 18, and I am so glad that I did. For me at least, I felt that I was older and could truly appreciate the moment. If you do decide to have sex, make sure you use protection. Don't let him tell you he is going to "pull out." Well, before you make this decision, you need to come to terms with yourself. Don't let your boyfriend pressure you. You need to make sure you're ready when you're alone. If you decide you are, THEN go talk to your boyfriend about it.

Feelings are not rational and are not based on information they are based upon generally what you have learnt through time. In this instance spending time with him has made you feel a particular way. Please look at the situation rationally and not emotionally, otherwise you may make a mistake. Anyway its best not to have sex with a dude so early 2 reasons. You never know who a person is after 2 weeks not even the best psychologist can do it. 2 once a man has had sex he has reached the height of pleasure unless he loves you which takes a long time to form with guys, the pleasure of the sex is greater than the relationship, which is why most of the time the man just moves on to the next sex.|`|QUmEfPhLaa	you don't have sex.Really you're not 18  and probably not in love as much as you'd like to think so just stick with making out because otherwise you'll just end up with a screaming crying pooping child before you're 16|`|xcv3mbEEaa	im not gonna say because its up to you but think about this:<br>  <br>  is that all he wants?<br>  are you on birth control or can you get it?(i would also suggest condoms which you can get almost anywhere)<br>  where can you?, because im sure your parents dont want you to.<br>  and can you wait till your at least 16, anyway you should probabally wait till 18.............<br>  <br>  its still up to you.... but id say wait a little longer :-)|`|ADpPVwdNaa	Unless you guys are planning on getting married, don't even consider it.

Things like pregnancies, STD's, or a broken heart. If your asking this uestion automatically your unsure of what to do, therefore your not ready. Because when you are, you are mature enough to think about everything yourself and with your partner. Give yourself the opportunity to date and have boyfriends without the need for sex until your emotionally ready. And the time will come someday trust me!|`|26oL7vHoaa	oh my god...have you even started your period yet? <br>  sex is something for adults, and judging by your question, you're DEFINATELY not ready for sex. besides, once he gets it hell move on.|`|4j6DSEqFaa	You should wait and a few weeks is nothing trust me. All guys want to and just to let you know you aren't in love it just feels that way. But when you are you will know. I am not saying wait til you are married but give it real thought. Me I want to wait til I'm 18 to 21, but the youngest I'll ever consider is 16, but if I were you I would wait. And making out is nothing compared to making out. THERE IS A COMPLETE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN KISSING (PUTTING YOUR TONGUES TOGETHER INSIDE YOUR MOUTH) AND SEX (HIM PUTTING HIS PENIS INTO YOUR VAGINA). And if its only been a few weeks he is probably going to leave you.|`|gHS5bU8Saa	If you're only 13, I really think you should wait. You only been dating him a few weeks, thats not a long time. Wait. You don't want to do anything you'll regret.|`|ZfvFjxpwaa	I know your feelings are true for eachother...and they are probably heart throbbingly intense to you. but I can say if you choose to have sex now your relationship will be really messed up. I know this from other people, me, and its general knowledge. Your relationship needs to be backed up with more than just feelings sometimes before you have sex. You need the time the memories, trust, honesty, loyalty all the things that keep relationships together. It is because sex is such an emotionly waiting thing, and you become very attached to this person. What if it turns out this guy was a douche? and you slept with him. and you will never be able to forget him. Wouldnt you rather wait and just enjoy your relationship for what it is. If it cant survive without you guys having sex then you wont last. sex is a minor part to relationships, there is much more to them than that. A lot of people might not agree, but those relationships that are sex too soon, or just sex do not last. Enjoy your youth and the wonders before involving yourself in something that can be done much later.|`|JWNzoksmaa	wait...enjoy the simplicity of a relationship before you mess it all up with sex. Seriously, you'll come to realize that sex just messing everything up...it's great and a necessity..but wait until you're mentally mature enough to handle sex.|`|71ZdsCraaa	Are you stupid or something??? Not only should you worry about getting pregnant but you should worry about STDS! If you do get pregrant you can say goodbye to your teen life!|`|56nOQvnWaa	You dont have sex!<br>  Your way to young! <br>  Its just your hormones talking.<br>  You guys need to be way older to have sex.<br>  You will get pregnant! <br>  and then you'll be posting the<br>  "Am i pregnant?" <br>  question!<br>  Save us all that! <br>  Do it for us! For the people on yahoo answers!<br>  We dont wanna caculate when your last period was! <br>  Thanks.|`|iIWwZrvEaa	wait hun|`|JNcB7Ffbaa	duh WAIT do you want a screaming pain in the butt kid at 13 you cant deal with that i can i have 5 kids but you no sorry WAIT!! PS. im 33.|`|LIUsQtLqaa	I have been have sex for 6 years, and have never gotten pregnant. SO I dont know why these people are telling you that. As long as you use protection, correctly, you will probably not get pregnant. <br>  <br>  Do what you feel is right. I lost my virginity at 13, and have never regretted it. You can't ask questions like this on here and expect to get real answers. You can't ask questions like this on here in general, because the answers need to come from your head and your heart, not someone else's. So if you feel like it is right, and you feel that you are ready, then go for it. Don't worry about what other people think or say. Your virginity is your gift, and you chose who to give it to.|`|SfFlz254aa	umm...a few weeks? wait till marraige so u can fully submit urself without lookin back|`|48SlX2Yiaa	Though people say to do it when you're ready. Honestly, save it until you get older. You may regret it even if you feel like you're in love.|`|XO8rWEbnaa	Whoa, wtf?|`|eayVCgUZaa	Just forget about all those other rude comments.!<br>  okay, honey honestly you should wait.!<br>  you might feel like you are ready, but this is a big deal.<br>  it's better to wait, then to regret, and lose him<br>  but if you disregard my suggestion, please use protection!!<br>  the pull out method doesn't work because he can pre-ejac.<br>  Be Careful!! hope i helped :)|`|qSXY8QKpaa	sex should be something when your emotiaonally and physically ready, your mind may knwo what sex is, but your body doesnt, just wait for a while, im sure whitley will understand, because if he does then he truly loves you andw ill wait with you until your ready|`|Qy9mH2s7aa	sure!!! just make sure you use a condom and have FUN!!! XD|`|bhnPUzypaa	I'd wait, your not ready to take responsibility if you were to end up pregnant. If you love one another that much you will wait. You've made out quite a few times..it takes a lot more than a few times making out to move onto the stage of having sex!|`|121YqxV2aa	first tell him to ware a condom but wait until u go out 4 at least 3 months|`|Nz9BU7iXaa	my rule is it has to be at lest liek half a year before i would do anything and just make sure  u hav condoms maybe even hav him wear 2 just in case|`|S2LH6L8Uaa	Im not telling you to have sex BUT if this boy have deep emotional feelings for you and you do to, and you might want to think about the risk's what might happen if any thing happen.LIKE<br>  *The condom might bust,*You might get STD,ext.....<br>  Fallow your feeling's<br>    <br>  Ans:DONT HAVE SEX|`|4iSnuDS9aa	wait til your married sweetie..... thats wrong of u|`|7YEZDCugaa	Hey,<br>  <br>  I personally think you should wait till you're older but if you think it's right then... You should use protection. Make him put on a condom and go down to your local sexual health clinic and get the morning after pill if you want to be extra safe!<br>  <br>  Hope that helps!|`|4KHpOztkaa	well if you don't want to get pregnant use a condom or go on the pill.<br>  but i would wait untill you have been dating a while longer x|`|kH0P9P9Naa	Go watch The Secret Life of the American Teenager<br>  <br>  And geez.....13?? At least wait until you can drive or have a job.|`|IFrzXsDXaa	DO NOT! DO NOT! DO NOT! <br>  <br>  you WILL screw up your life and you will regret it dearly! Please dont. Wait until mairrage!!!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  WAIT!|`|nru7H9e2aa	If you are desperate and can't wait, get on the pills (for safety from pregnancy) and then use a condom(to prevent sexually transmitted disease). Before you get into that, read this:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.click2houston.com/news/15773665/detail.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.click2houston.com/news/157736...</a><br>  <br>  Also read TC Boyle's "The Love of my Life."<br>  <br>  My personal advice: Please say NO to sex.<br>  <br>  Do not be pressured into it.<br>  <br>  Your love is just sexual attraction.|`|ZXpYrLUbaa	if you are 13, you probably shouldn't have even KISSED!!!! Girl, i know you like him, but wait until you're much older. 13? No!!! if you must do it, though, get someone thats 18 to buy a condom so you guys are safe.. eeeew sorry but that's just very astonishing!|`|831cf80630eaa5c9cdbb28536f2027d5aa	Wait until you are older, otherwise you will regret it later.|`|VNwB064Baa	First of all, you're definitely too young and so is he.  I waited until I was 21 and was mature enough to know he was the right guy.  After 3 years, we're still together.  About 14 is when my hormones started going nuts and I hit puberty.  So I know that you're thinking he's the right one and you're ready and all, but trust me, you aren't.  Wait a couple years at least.  You'll be happier in the long run.  But if you must, please use protection!|`|nlqVEjhQaa	No one who has sex at 13 is happy about it in the long run.<br>  Ask anyone else down the line they wish they could have waited 2 or 3 more years at the least to do it for the first time.<br>  Be smart.|`|gOwakeM1aa	Save your ultimate gift to your husband when you are married. If the guy likes you for who you are as a person then he will respect you and want to be with you always but if you give him it all right now then he will let you go after he has got the ultimate prize from you and go to some other cutey pie that gives him the look. I do know what I,m talkin  abt frm experience as a girly chaser!|`|2PfMa1XIaa	you probably should not but if you really want to then just do it. if you do be sure to do it safely. but honestly i would say you are to young but then again if you do be sure to wear a condom. safe sex :D|`|M0qbyACRaa	Theres a reason people say to wait!.<br>  <br>  That reason is for your own good.<br>  <br>  <br>  so DONT. PLEASE!!!, your life will be screwed up|`|qbxkWDMbaa	PLEASE wait im BEGGING you.<br>  This is more of a "Ask Mom" question.<br>  I know it may be akward,<br>  but maybe she can talk sense into you.<br>  You're too young,<br>  And it's only been a few weeks.<br>  If he loves you, he'll wait.|`|7z9eKO2maa	dudette... you have GOT to be joking... i'm 14, and so is my girlfriend... and we both know that we love each other, and don't feel any need to have sex, honestly... don't screw up your life, you are still in school... missing months of school while being pregnant completely tears your future apart, missing tons of material, and then having to support your own CHILD, don't do it... he's 14, and probably still has no clue how to use a condom anyways... don't bother with sex until you're older... try... 20? seriously... teen sex is a horrible thing... would you really want your kid to be born when you're that young? your boyfriend can clearly not even understand the consequences... in order for a guy to feel the ammount of pain that birth is, he'd have to pull his SCROTUM OVER HIS HEAD... anyways... don't do it... pleeeease don't do it, i'm not joking|`|zPGjFdJhaa	Don't have sex until you are married, you have all your life to have sex.|`|prqE3Tthaa	IT'S YOUR DECISION!!! don't let other people tell you not to do it. if you want to, do it. USE PROTECTION THOUGH. (condoms, the pill)<br>  if you want to have sex, have sex. if you don't want to have sex, don't have sex. life is short. what if one of you died tomorrow? you'd never know what would've happened.<br>  There's only now,<br>  there's only here,<br>  give in to love,<br>  or live in fear.<br>  No other path,<br>  No other way,<br>  No day but today.<br>  Have a nice day=]|`|muOxoDGOaa	If you both think you're ready, just know that if you do have sex, always remember to use a condom! If you don't there is a really good chance you will get pregnant.|`|TUbD7f0Xaa	Wait till you're older and you can deal with having a child with him!!! And it's called infatuation when you like someone like that, not love.  Seriously, don't do anything drastic.|`|AcjLKC2Laa	Have you lost your mind,<br>  I'm 14 & I almost made that decision But i didn't have it.<br>  You could get stds or aids or something so just waiit!<br>  <br>  Kay'|`|e06APKVqaa	Use a condom duh! But ya'll are probley gonna have sex then want a baby cuz you think your grown and "in love"|`|lG5KtdUgaa	Id wait becuz you dont wanna get pregnate|`|nwxtmNJfaa	Please wait. A few weeks isn't enough time to know a person well enough! I am your age and my boyfriend is his age and believe me, you're going to want to. Just don't! The emotional stress it causes is pretty much unbearable, and even if he wears a condom or you take birth control pills there still is a risk of you getting pregnant. If he loves you, he will wait until you get older, marry you, then have sex with you. Good luck, and make the right choice.|`|FNJFPnoIaa	You're waayyyy too young.. both of you are... on top of that.. it's only been a few weeks... not months.. not years... yes you may feel ready for it but after you may have regrets.. take it from someone who's been there... also.. think about the risks... i'm not sure if either of you have slept with other people or not.. that's your business.. but there's the risk of STDs and pregnancy and you are both too young to be parents... I'd definitely say to wait.. you'll be better off in the end... but if you do decide to have sex.. make sure you're protected...|`|EwQj0w84aa	psh, dont listen to any of those people down there. i wouldn't doubt there all virgins at the age of 50 ;D<br>  <br>  SO yea basically do it if your fully aware of what your doing, and if you wanna have sex.. have sex.<br>  <br>  just dont let him pressure you into something you dont wanna do, big no-no . and! of course dont get knocked up girlfran!<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|AA10676396	the person u give your virginity will not always be the person you end up marrying. reconsider if u really want to do it and if u must please be extremely careful about. btw if he really loves u he will wait until u guys r older|`|TFqnYBeDaa	DO NOT HAVE SEX.<br>  There is a reason its not only in the bible, but why people wait!<br>  BECAUSE it leads to diseases, hurt feelings, baby's and even suicide.<br>  And how easy can you be? Your 13 and you've only been dating this guy for a few weeks.<br>  Sexual Intercourse is the MOST INTIMATE FORM on PHYSICAL CONTACT. In the bible it says, the two shall become one.<br>  I bet if you asked every person that had sex before marriage, they'd say they wish they waited.<br>  Just PLEASE don't.|`|9UTSZ3Xkaa	honestly, DON'T.:|<br>  the things that can happen from sex,<br>  are srsly gross.<br>  not just pregnancy, but STD's, too.<br>  trust me, you dnt want tht.<br>  <.<<br>  your neither physically, OR, emotionally ready for that.<br>  if he loves you he'll wait.|`|CRlmTdaxaa	Make sure you're ready. People who have sex only after a few weeks of dating tend to be considered whores... You're more than old enough to make your own decisions and you have the power to do it whenever you want. Just MAKE SURE YOU USE CONDOMS. Sex is something that comes naturally to humans, but your first time will be awkward. Lastly, be ready to be caught: All things become evident within time.<br>  <br>  Good Luck.|`|A73ForyRaa	well if you really want to go ahead but at least wait till you have been going out with him a little bit longer a few weeks isn't enough time to know that you really love someone and actually want to have sex with them|`|KbLxI1cEaa	honestly, i think ur way to young to have sex. Your only 13 and i dont think a 13 year old really knows what love is yet. you have your whole life ahead of you! in a couple of years maybe you'll find someone you trully love and you'll be way more mature. If the guy really likes you he wont pressure you if your not ready. Waiting for the right guy to come would be my advice. It may seem like your in love with him now, but what if after having sex he dumps you? what would you do then if you were to get pregnent? But if your sure hes the right guy i would say to talk to someone you trust who is also sexually active. They could advice you on what to do to protect yourself. <br>  -hope this help! my best advice would be not to rush! your only 13!|`|LKer0JTbaa	You are way to young to get pregnant and you barely know this guy even though you think you do.  Tell him you need to slow down a bit and if he likes you like you like him then he'll wait.

Find someone who cares more about your opinions then everyone Else's, someone who will treat you right. Give you benefits and the relationship that it's supposed to go with. "Friends with benefits" is recipe for disaster and greater heart break every time I've seen it tried. Don't let him rope you into his lie's and problems and find someone worth your time. :D|`|PA7kYyAxaa	you are his b00ty call, congrats!<br>  <br>  and you can't even spell "like"|`|L6Dt7wo0aa	Dump him and find someone that likes you for you.|`|ieKIB64Eaa	It means he is using you, and keeping himself open for someone he does want to date.<br>  <br>  You don't need that.

If a guy likes you there must be something about you that attracted him. You need to think outside the box and go find other people that will support you. The key is to be yourself and have lots and lots of confidence. <br>  Btw...if the rumors aren't true then don't let them get to you. It just shows that that guy has a no lofe making up all that crappy rumors. Good luck and be yourself.

It is also safer because you might hurt someone's feelings when one assumes something that isn't true, which happens when you become bf/ gf. Maybe for some people, it is already understood that you love each other when you become bf/ gf. But sometimes, they are just too embarrassed or scared to say because of the fear of rejection that you might not reciprocate their feelings.|`|3c6b7f2c583befb67a2156c7aa57cdc2aa	I think you have underestimated how shallow some people can be.|`|52d5ab23da3ae1f32226c6a0220cbfb2aa	Then you have no idea what love is.()|`|e5b684d2c2e48d54a68b6ccee1664bccaa	Some people just like the feeling of knowing that they have someone|`|befec6e1c03a7f92ba58be78b96ad694aa	I would think the idea of bf/gf is to establish a relationship, does it need to be love? no. But rather a commitment towards one another to find out if it turns into love.  It's the commitment that allows you to open up with each other, trust each other, and maybe fall in love.  By the way you're doing it, you could miss many opportunities with people you could actually fall for.|`|fdfa4e0f094f919b3f28981c778cae4daa	Because it takes TIME and nothing but time to develop real, mature love.  What I thought love was at age 19 and at age 30 were totally different!  It was like night and day.<br>  <br>  You see, everyone has different goals in life and different goals when dating someone.  Some people "date" so they can find the right person and settle down and marry them.  Some people, like me, date casually and often date more than one woman at a time.  <br>  <br>  Anyways, it's generally a good idea to "date" someone first for awhile (at least a few months) before you start "labelling" your relationship as boyfriend / girlfriend.<br>  <br>  Only tell people you love them when you really do.  I've only said "I love you" to 3 women in my life and when I said it I really meant it.  But I've dated dozens of women over my life and really, you're not going to know any of this until you've had more life experience.<br>  <br>  Have fun with dating and don't take it so seriously.<br>  <br>  Rod|`|011319d372500cc8dad5360bfaeae528aa	It's easier that way.|`|66a5f3b314b4589bd0a91fe7ec319264aa	well u already state how u fell......different folks different strokes

You need to start out with just an ordinary conversation...try asking him if he got the homework assingment or some other excuse to get comfortable talking to him.

I was in a big shopping mall.  There were dozens of Japanese tourists who were there shopping.  They were very rude when it came to elevator manners.  When the elevator would stop on a floor, they would push their way in and stop anyone who was trying to get out.  This was going on for a couple of hours.  A friend of mine was there and our wives went into a store together.  We went to get a couple of hot dogs.  He piled his up with sauerkraut and drank a few bottles of beer. Within 20 minutes he was far*ing like a machine gun.  We went into one of the elevators and went up a couple of floors.  Just as the doors opened and these nasty ladies pushed their way in, he let a ripe one rip.  We pushed our way out.  As the elevator went up, you could see through the glass sides and the women we fanning their faces and gagging.<br>  We did that for the next half hour and must have gassed a couple of hundred of them that way.  A few times we stayed in the elevator and blamed the women for doing it.  It was a funny way to spend an afternoon.  Of course my friends wife threw him out of the house because he was having his "problem" all night long.|`|26f1be09089baca92a00511a24a05894aa	when ppl just answered my question and they were nice :)|`|358419af2c33ff7b71dd602903185208aa	Last night, my bf and I had a movie night together.

bc28949b0da27bf37f857d5424f15ac2aa	ADESTRAMENTO. Tem um programa na Tv a cabo mas n?o me lembro o canal onde a apresentadora usa o mesmo método para adestrar c?es no intuito de ensinar aos homens esses pequenos hábitos domésticos. O princípio básico é o da premia??o, ou seja, você n?o briga, mas elogia toda vez que ele fizer certo. E vai pedindo todas as vezes, com a maior delicadeza: "meu amor, n?o esquece de baixar a tampinha tá?". Toda vez que ele fizer certo, beijinhos, carinhos, etc. E meninos, a tampa do vaso tem que ficar baixada por quest?o de higiene, n?o é por chilique. Por mais limpinho que esteja o vaso, se a tampa fica aberta sai aquele cheirinho desagradável. é para isto que ela existe e n?o para enfeitar o vaso, ok? hehehe|`|0810ff29a2cb87ea0a41fc851ab35bd6aa	Deixe a tampa levantada.

Mas como alguns escreveram, é ponto de vista. Teríamos nós que aprender a baixar a tampa e condicioná-la aberta?!<br>  Eu acho que eles ficam t?o irritados como nós, quando entram no banheiro e tem que erguer a tampa.<br>  Interessante ponto de vista, você n?o achou?<br>  <br>  Mas respondendo sua pergunta, é uma quest?o da maneira como eles foram educados, meus dois filhos homens já aprenderam isso desde cedo, que devem deixar a tampa abaixada.<br>  <br>  Mais uma coisinha, n?o fique t?o estressada por t?o pouco, n?o se indigne por esse motivo, tem coisas mais sérias dentro de um relacionamento para você se preocupar, os homens n?o pensam e nem agem como as mulheres, esses detalhes para eles, s?o tolos e se você levar muito à sério talvez fa?a com que seu companheiro comece a se cansar de você.

That may be that you need to let her family know what she is doing.  Try talking to her to figure out why she is cutting.  She is trying to feel something other than emotional pain or numbness.  She is looking for attention and i dont necessarily mean that in a bad way.  Let her know that you are there for her and that you will listen.  IF she doesnt stop and it continues you really need to get her some professional  help and let her family know if they dont know already.  It could turn into something much worse, Death. and thats probably NOT what she wants.  She is hurting and needs someone she can trust to be with her and help her, NOT to judge her but to just be her friend.  I will put you and her in my prayers. Take care
AA11489753	There's sth wrong with her. Jus tell her firmly that what both of u did is wrong, totally wrong!!!Tell her the truth that u r upset.

Just go on your knees and ask God in heaven to forgive you because what you committed is called adultery and God detests it (please read the book of proverbs chapter 7 in the bible). The goodnews is that He would forgive you but you must forgive yourself and never get close to that woman again or else you would go back to your vomit. she is not a goodnews to you. cheers

de7c4bc69611d320a1c484fcc53344b6aa	Here's why we got into it.. We were curious. My husband wondered what it would be like to watch me with another man/woman. At first I was totally against it. But after the first time I am loving it. Yes there alot of pro/cons as to why or why not. It takes a strong marriage and you have to be comfortable with yourself. If you are insecure in anyway this is not a lifestyle to be in. If there are any jealousy at all it will not work. It's not about loving the other couple/man/woman you are with. It's about adventure and having fun. There are clubs and websites you can find that can give you more info for your paper. There are ground rules that you and your partner have to set before going into this. You also have to be picky to a point. You have to have standards. There are alot of scary people out there and you have to feel safe and secure. There is one couple that we have been together with and have formed a wonderful friendship out of it. It's not just about sex.. Yes that is 99% of it.. But it's about friendship and respect. People somestimes have a negative view on this lifestyle. But ask yourself this.. Why??? Most feel that if you are married than why be with someone else.. Don't you feel as if you are cheating? The answers are this.. Who said you had to have sex with just one person for the rest of your life. Why do you think people cheat and divorce. If you can be open and trust one another than it's the better.. I'm not saying it's for everyone either. It's a choice you make as a couple. Also discreetion is an absolute must. We feel that what happens in our bedroom is our personnal business and that our family and close friends do not need to know. So all in all it's about curiousity and respect and to enjoy one another. You only live once so why not be open to fun and new things.. And that is why we did and our enjoying the swing lifestyle.|`|2f49a4b295fb5f06569311ceff0cfed8aa	You need to define your paper a little more.  Are swinging couples ones who go out and pick up some one in a bar and have a threesome on occasion or are they the one who choose it as a lifestyle.  There are differences.<br>  <br>  As far as the second ones - they are into it because it is a lifestyle, not just an occasional fling. They think differently and have a different view of life.  The first type usually end up having a lot of problems and are part of the 50% divorce rate. The second type usually have a very low divorce rate - under 10%.  You have to trust your partner to an extreme to allow them to have sex with some one else.  It is called unconditional love - some one talked about it some 2000 years ago.  <br>  <br>  We do it because we have a strong relationship.  If you get into to try and save your marriage or think you need a kick start for your bedroom chances are you are doomed to fail.  But for those who are strong and comfortable in their relationships it is an added dimension that cannot be achieved any other way.  Curiosity is the main reason successful couples get into it.  and I have been familiar with it for more than 40 years and was familiar with couples who had been in it for more than 40 years - 40 years ago.  Those people who do get into it - probably 90% - stay with it for a long time. The people in it are trustworthy people - they have to be especially because of the rules, and any good club has rules they enforce rigorously.  Many times you end up with life long friends whether you continue to have sex or not.|`|AA11412999	Just a tip: you won't find much reliable information on here.  Try SwingersBoard (see link below)<br>  <br>  Why did we get into it?  Because we can.  It's not a need, it's just a really cool addition to our sex life.  Also, it has really deepened our relationship and improved us as individuals.  It forces you to confront your true nature...and demons.  You have two choices: fix your problems or lose your mind.  It's not for wimps.<br>  <br>  We're currently not swinging right now (3 1/2 years of monogamy, so that takes care of the myth that "you can't go back") but that's just due to life becoming too busy.  Hoping to get back into it soon though...gotta get back on the weight bench first!

419ac1935f74b8c60bd977019c7d802caa	Men are very good at singular focus - give us one topic/subject at a time, and we're fine. On the other hand, our multitasking skills suck - which translates to having problems concentrating on you, his issues at work, the TV, upcoming events, his hobbies, his friends, and anything else all at the same time. We mere males don't read minds, we lack the ability to intuit social subtleties naturally, we are often slow at connecting body language and verbal communication, and the silent treatment is no good since it takes us about 9-11 minutes to realise we're in the pooh.<br>  <br>  Men can maintain relationships, but we need women to coach us along. If you want us to listen, then give advanced notice and provide an agenda. We can't tell if something is 'wrong' if you don't tell us, and if we don't know it's broken then why would we try to fix it?<br>  <br>  For men, relationship etiquette is learned behaviour, but I don't see women taking charge of trying to teach us. Until then, all men can do is try our best guess...|`|AA10269578	Not all men though... But in  some points there are men who don't stick to one relationship. They are looking for something which beyond from their imagination. Men sometimes like woman who'se very submissive to them but to some aspect woman think that they are being controlled. However, men think that it is a minus point when woman are too dependent to them. There are really many reasons why men don't stay in a relationship. Some of them don't like forever commitment which give them no freedom at all. There are most men who just like to be controlled by woman yet woman doesn't appreciate it because it's not healthy in a relationship. Men are men... I just don't know what made them or what made them think about woman. They have their own minds... But as far as I'm concern..understanding and descernment are few ways to maintain a relationship.|`|AA11604508	I think it's because men get bored fairly easily. The key is for us women is to keep the love life steamy and to treat him like a king... that way he'll obey like a good puppy!|`|ce471f254f0611c8bcad8a51139c574baa	because they are to busy thinking about your best friend ,sister maybe mother. if they did not want to fuk everything maybe then they could stay like a good puppy.|`|e5a631ce059c43507956ed8e5784c400aa	Coz there ain't such thing like relationship....there ain't nothing to maintain there.

Men (and women for that matter) who have been in a relationship for a while get into a comfort zone and familiarity and this is only natural and inevitable. <br>  Keep the relationship alive by trying new things together, taking vacations and initiating fun activities.<br>  Make sure you always have his favourite beer in the fridge,<br>  good luck<br>  Irene

She had her face and chin raised, and her eyesight was always straight, she never lowered her eyes. And she dressed well; elegant. <br>  <br>  She wasn't exactly hot (she was a bit overweight and small boobs), but it was her poise and commanding demeanor that made her stand out from the other girls.<br>  <br>  I liked her because that is how I am too.|`|3bbaa47e0cfe3ac70149b3ea53041db2aa	She has the most fantastic legs I've ever seen!|`|a3a49e421f116d5f0745e5947d9d7084aa	The way she enters a room.

FXCoGD44aa	I don't forget their birthday or anniversary. I live on the other side of the country and I always send a card in the mail and give them a call on the day. Same goes for all holidays. I do it not only because it's the thing you should do for the people you love, but also because they never forget my birthday either. I know they love just getting a card in the mail - it's nice to open up something that isn't a bill. But, yes, calling is better than nothing at all.<br>  <br>  So I don't forget, I mark ALL birthdays on my regular calendar - even if I have them memorized. I'm a visual person, so seeing it every day reminds me and helps me remember and stick to deadlines and birthdays.|`|qVMg9YRsaa	Yes... and it's OK to forget because we're human... let's be honest, we're so busy that we're liable to forget our own important dates. With that said, when it comes to the people who created you, we ought to take an extra initiative to remember their important dates... sort of like how you'd love for them to remember yours... Likewise, try hard to... and a phone is always better than nothing... anything is better than nothing. Even sending a free online greeting card would be nice and thoughtful... But don't panic, just pray that you're given another year to try to remember. Good luck sweetie!|`|Is429fvUaa	i never 4get a family event.. ut if u did.. i would just call.. it's better to hear from u than nothing.
SjX72fPyaa	You don't sound like your ready to have sex, so I would suggest that you don't. Your first time is supposed to be special for you, not just because your boyfriend wanted you to. <br>  I lost mine before I was ready simply because my boyfriend at the time didn't want to be the only virgin in his group of friends so he talked me into it. I don't regret losing it to him, we're still great friends, but I do wish that we would have waited for an actual good reason to have sex, not just so he could be more accepted by his friends. So I know what you mean by feeling pressured.<br>  But if you don't think that he will still like you if you don't have sex with him, then you might want to rethink your relationship. Sit down with him and talk about it. If he truly loves you for you, then he will wait as long as you need him to. If he still doesn't want to wait, then you should move on to someone who actually deserves to get your virginity one day.<br>  Good luck. I hope it works out for you :)|`|KweMUxUdaa	Oral sex is good, that way you are not pressured into going all the way.|`|NMcFF0Iwaa	No decent guy would be bugging you for it. <br>  Save it for when you are older. <br>  There's always another bus coming. <br>  If he doesn't like you because of sex, then it's really time to catch another bus(guy).<br>  And what about the man you will someday marry, after all, you will love him.  <br>  If you are under 18, forget about sex, enjoy your fun free years, too many other things to do.|`|p0L0A4ysaa	You wait.<br>  <br>  Tough. I know you want to "make him happy". But if YOU make HIM happy, he'll wait.<br>  <br>  I put out on too young of an age, and I regret it. I'm sick of young girls having this mentality and just giving all of them to one guy at a young age.|`|0ox8VKwKaa	If he likes you for who you are it shouldn't matter. I don't know enough about you to really make comments. One thing for sure is that you shouldn't do something for him to like you.|`|e7f7b9508f28f00c8e34cd692587ca8caa	If he cares about U he'll wait|`|rM9Oqy68aa	If he likes you then he will not force you into anything. You're just feeling a bit insecure and thinking that he is thinking about sex. You do not have to sleep with him to make him happy, do sweet things etc. He should respect you enough. <br>  When you feel ready is when you are ready, do not rush this, it will come eventually.|`|BsK3u5p3aa	thatz dumb. u just said u were a virgin. n from the sound of it if he stop liking him juss cuz u dont go all the way with him, he doesnt really like u sweet heart. so basically u gone lose ur virginity to a azzhole who only wanted one thing n he'll eventually end up gettin what he wants and leaving yo azz. always turns out that way. so think about it do u really wanna lost it to someone like that? cuz it wont last long if he that type of person... n u'll regret it in the future. & u'll feel really bad and sad and he'll treat u like dirt. but i could be wrong. u could be wrong. juss dont give it up to no anybody but u can get ur heart broken.|`|0wgU37Gjaa	If your not comfortable having sex then dont, cause you'll end up regretting it no matter the outcome. If he wont be with you because of the fact you wont sleep with him, then let him go cause it seems like he is only in it for that. Tons of other fish in the sea.|`|8pWFsDSHaa	I think if you really like him you wont have sex, I mean it is your choice but make sure it is your choice, and has nothing to do with him and think of how he has already loved another girl(physically and emotionally) and if you really want to be the second or third or more....|`|cn04Dmzeaa	you need to talk to him about it.<br>  <br>  If you don't feel comfortable having sex then don't do it.<br>  If you're willing to meet somewhere or make  <br>  <br>  Regardless if you like him or not, what you want should be something you hold in account.|`|fOQ2TDIeaa	You know what? It's your virginity, it's your choice. You get one chance to share this with someone. It is very painful and after it is wonderful. Is he worth this? There are many ways to please him without giving it up.|`|hAXJ47iAaa	You wait until your ready...and if he is a great guy worth your time, he will wait with you.|`|kULet9pxaa	don't do it! Wrong choice! What did ur health teacher teach u, missy??|`|S1H8B23Iaa	My boyfriend is 2 years older than me and has had way more partners than me..(ive been with one other).. so i can understand how you feel pressured to want to do stuff that he has done before... i dont know you but it sounds like you are not ready to take this step and trust me, sex changes EVERYTHING.. and if you do this and end up not staying with him in the long haul is this what you want to remember..that you had sex because he wanted to not because you wanted it also?? think about it.. especially tell him how you feel.. my boyfriend knows it makes me sad to know he has had so many partners and if you have sex with someone you dont love and dont see a future with, who's to say it wont happen again if you dont stay with him? just remember that.|`|HKTRAHV9aa	I'm in the same situation. I talked to my boyfriend and told him that I don't think I'm ready at this point to do certain things and that I felt bad for disappointing him. He said that I wasn't disappointing him, and he shouldn't be pushy and that we can only go as far as I want to.<br>  If your boyfriends not accepting of your limits, then you need to rewind and talk with him. Dont' get in too deep and don't do anything yo're not ready for, you won't like it.|`|CShomAPsaa	Firstly, the big question is, do you feel ready to actually sleep with this guy, or are you doing it, because you want to please him (or maybe he's pressuring you)?   This is a big decision and not something you should do lightly....only when you are sure this is a secure relationship and that it's your choice.   If it is a secure relationship, then you don't need to worry about making him happy...just be yourself and that should be enough.<br>  <br>  Sounds to me though like you're not that sure.   Maybe you really need to give this some more thought?|`|5pj6rmSraa	slob on his knob
6BSHkiugaa	That depends on which state you reside in.  In Pa there is no such thing as a legal seperation.  I wanted one myself. Just be sure to get a legal opinion before moving out.

In order for it to warrant his approval it has to say so in the papers.  Secondly the daughter is 15, and would more than likely have been able to choose to move anyway even if the papers said his permission was needed.  What I suggest is changing his insurance policy to cover his daughter, (my ex has it on our daughter, he lives in PA , her and I live in CA)|`|AA11780989	I feel for you, I have custody of my daughter but pay a percentage of her medical plus if she gets braces, I'll have to pay a nice chunk.

Your husband should have taken her to court and let the judge work this out it. How long have they been out of state?? Is the daughter willing to live with you all 15 years old she's in the First or second year of high school. she(the mother) should not have moved out of state on that note alone. I would have him go back to court and see if the daughter is interested in living with you guys if that's not a problem for you.

If the mother has full custody she ,will still recieve child support ,but not 100% medical,the judge makes that choice, sound like you might have to go back to court.Or wait it out ,you do not have to pay after they turn 18yr.s of age.|`|AA10408335	he needs to contact a lawyer, my lawyer told me I could not move without going to court and getting the courts permission.

Good luck|`|AA11146414	Why doesn't the insurance cover his daughter? My ex husband lives 2600 miles away from me and his insurance covers our daughter most major insurance companies such as blue cross blue shield and such will do this. Your husband does not need to give the custodial parent "permission" to move anywhere including out of state with the child. My ex husband did not give me permission to move 2600 miles away by law all I was required to do was inform him of where we would be moving to the new address and when I planned on moving. If in the divorce decree it state he will be responsible for her medical then there is nothing that can be done and even if the wife signs permission for treatment that piece of paper holds him liable for all bills.|`|AA11899639	he needs to go back to court - and settle this with a judge(specially if she doesn't have full custody)

Just ignore them and be yourself and be good, refuse to notice them,  by that they would know that they are nothing and cannot influence you by thier character. With this measure, most of the time you find them becoming curious as to why everyone around them pays attention to them but you are not. Once they notice you are not paying attention to their arrogance or pride they naturally would feel like correcting themselves towards you. I have done that with a lot of girl and it worked. Just act like you don't need them.|`|a3ee0046684928a0cb84ba5295262b45aa	That depends.  Some respond to and like other arrogant people.  Some like to have all the attention to themselves.  Some have the arrogance to put folks off so they don't have to deal with them. Figure out which it is, and play to their world view.<br>  <br>  Personally, my way of dealing with an arrogant woman is to avoid her and deal with people who are friendly, forthright, and more realistic in their expectations of life.  <br>  <br>  The arrogant ones who get rewarded for being arrogant are tough to live around later on.

If she would be patient and calm... May be he will open his heart to her once again. <br>  _______________<br>  <br>  She may not want to be with him... In that case I think it will be better, if she forget about him... May be you can help her to find another love... <br>  <br>  But please, don't kill love, if there is a chance to make Chris and Mel happy!|`|6e3a6e78e1762d44202e6fe4c4f7ea17aa	I think that she had her chance and she screwed it up.If she is truly sorry she needs to try her hardest to win him back but she also has to be responsible for her actions.She screwed up, now she has consequences she needs to deal with.I don't want to sound mean but that s the truth.I think she should just talk to him and tell him how she feels he might still love her and be willing to forgive her, he is probably being defensive and is trying to stay away so she doesn't hurt him again.so maybe talking will resolve the situation,be honest let know everything and accept whatever comes your way because remember it was your fault.|`|2ae8081f337e2bbe9e95cce3db58dc28aa	It sounds like she lost her chance with him.<br>  She hurt him really bad, what does she expect?<br>  She really has to start showing him she's changed and maybe get that closeness back. That's what I would do. I wouldn't push anything on him just yet, give it some time.<br>  I wish her luck.|`|67b9958e3f9478dc924202f30e727a8baa	If the guy was still interested he would have made you realize this by now, now he is not interested in you like he used to and you have to get that into your head and move on maybe there is nothing you can do to change him afterall he has new friends and he is not even thinking of you. Move on Mel, you have only one life to live, you have to creat an atmosphere for yourself, create one of joy not sadness.

37655935232b3e6a147858c852c391b6aa	If he sits near you, try to start a conversation.  Don't start off talking about you, ask about him!  Everyone loves talking about themselves.  Only respond in agreement or very respectful argument, letting him pass on.  Find stuuf in common!|`|AA10775168	Talk to him.  Hang out with him.

So, speaking as a "cute" guy, I can tell you that there's plenty of times where I wished some girls would just come up and talk to me.  Don't go up to him like you're trying to get him to ask you out...just talk to him like you would anybody else. Be friendly, but not clingy. Don't look like your world would be devastated if he says or does the wrong thing...that creeps guys out.<br>  <br>  And if he acts like he's too good for you...move on and find somebody worth your time and effort.|`|5343fe85ba10587a9e8ec2b39bd14177aa	You have known him for SIX years? Do you just know of him or do you really know him?  If you are in situations where you see him all the time and this is ongoing then start by asking him a question based on whatever the common interest is that brought you around him.  For example, if you have a class with him, ask him about something that happened in class?  If you just see him in the hall, start by just saying hi.  This will build your confidence up to start having longer conversations.  If he is a nice guy, he will talk to you.  If he is a jerk, then he won't and then you know not to waste any more of your time on him - no matter how cute he is - some guys are just not worth the headache if they are arrogant.|`|964bfaf70052589024dd16dfebe12e10aa	You have to talk to him.

2f31b4d39ae1b04efdb601126bd63100aa	The vintage ones are the best.  Some of them are really amazing in the detail.  Plus, there is just something romantic about a pocketwatch that has been used by other people.  It just makes you wonder who had it before and what that person experienced.  Plus, going vintage goes along with the theme of past times together.

AA10479785	Tell her the truth.  Get out and move back home. That is what your gut seems to be telling you.  If she is an alcoholic that will bring a lot of trouble.  I don't see that part of it working out.  I definitely think you should tell her the truth and then move back home!|`|bac0c08d67448ca69e882615d8e3b333aa	Oh man, you young people and your "best friends" of the opposite sex.  Oh well.  Actually you shouldn't be living there if you aren't on the lease and I'm sure that's clearly spelled out on the lease.  As a legal matter you should move out tomorrow.  She could be evicted if they found out.  I wouldn't move back home, YIKES, but maybe you could find a room in someones house that is less expensive.  There are a lot of ads in the paper with people with large houses who want to rent out the downstairs etc.  You should give her at least 2 weeks to a month notice, but again, you're not even legally living there.  I feel strongly that young people should get away from their parents and struggle themselves, it's a great learning experience and makes you much better at life when you are in your 30's/40's.  You have to find a way to make your life more financially comfortable, whether it's another job or reducing expenses somehow.|`|eaf5f8882f88e649f6b01cb379f77e5eaa	If she's your best friend you should be able to talk to her and explain to her that you want to get your self together financially and she should understand where you're coming from.  I hope she consulted you before she signed another lease because if not it's like she took it upon herself to sign the lease like she just automatically expected to you to be okay with living there for another year and that was selfish of her. I think you need to take care of your self before you end up struggling, talk to her and either way you need to leave and take care of you first, good luck.|`|b1ae06a1fe2d43f0d327dad7eaab1ab0aa	I would just tell her the honest truth. Paying your bills and keeping your credit is very important.  If your not comfortable with the drinking and you stay it will only end up badly. Your name is not on the lease so get out and take care of yourself. If she is truly your best friend she will understand. Might be pissed for a little while, but she'll get over it. good luck

Marriage is a man made invention enforced by the legal system and most religion.  But there is nothing to say that you cannot love more than one person at a time.<br>  <br>  The problem is that you made a commitment to your wife to love her forever and not cheat on her.  But by having a girl friend you are proving yourself to be a liar and a cheater.  If you truly loved your wife, you would not be doing this to her.  The fact that you are a cheater means that in fact the most likely explanation is that you love only one person; yourself.
AA10644017	and you believe her ?|`|ff4ec92730f0d1ed7332b61129233010aa	nothing she might just feel uncomftoble because she hasnt let any1 touch her in 2 years just give it a while|`|8886eda8f9b695a4f6a3fc571d0dff05aa	It may be that she wasn't prepared to go all the way with you that soon.  It sounds like she needs time to reconcile her feelings and needs.  Give her some time and let her know you truly care about her.
c8b76be8f6bf2f5a698c0bd2d4432b45aa	Yes (but, like the others, it depends on your local jurisdiction).<br>  <br>  Here's what happened to me....<br>  <br>  My divorce is inter-jurisdictional (filed for in "STATE A", the actual divorce and division of assets occuring in "STATE A", but since I'm in a "STATE B", the child custody, support etc happened in <br>  "STATE B").<br>  <br>  I had a lawyer acting on my behalf in Alberta. Divorce judgement became final this past April. HOWEVER... my ex, being the idiot he is, didn't attend the hearing (I didn't have to b/c my lawyer was there representing me). He also failed to provide a current address to the courts, so the final divorce judgement got mailed to his old address.<br>  <br>  MONTHS go by. Finally, he hires a lawyer (we're still trying to deal with division of assets). I get a letter from his lawyer, asking me to sign off on the divorce judgement because "my client (the ex) has moved on and wishes to legally be able to do so".<br>  <br>  Basically, he's got a new honey, wants to get remarried but doesn't know he's divorced (and has been for nearly 10 months!!). I'm not gonna tell him, and neither is my lawyer!! <br>  <br>  LMAO :)|`|AA11899639	i am going to say yes...,but it really depends on the state you live in -|`|3ffde5594a7c4f47ee9d51aec2cfacabaa	Yep (Your state may vary.......)|`|55f9e37e5a4b3b2b6558f30a74b990f3aa	I am gonna say yes but you may want to contact the court where the divorce was gonna happen.

We spoke for awhile.|`|b3350709b67209134666137a0df804afaa	Well...women definately love to shop, so it's probably a good opportunity to meet someone! But, I know I am usually rushed when I go shopping and probably don't want to spend that time having a conversation with a man I just met (just being honest here). If you are at a mall, maybe you could go to a resting area. **make sure she's single first by checking the ring finger.** Things that could be good conversation starters might be: "Do you know where (insert store name) is?" Then you can say thank you and pick something to compliment her on. You can ask if she knows of any good restaraunts in the area...and go from there and maybe talk about what kind of food you like. Just try to be yourself and don't act too desperate. If you meet someone you like and you can tell she likes you back then you might say something like, "I hope I am not being too forward, but I would love to take you to dinner some night..." Hopefully, this will work for you. Good Luck! : )|`|359923da2275fc5db5d2c004fef9b9a9aa	It depends on how good looking you are. If you are, than just start talking. If your not, good luck.

You don't want to creep her out by coming on too strong, but you also don't want to be the "Nice Guy".  Who is the "Nice Guy"?  The "Nice Guy" is the man that is too shy to ask her on a date, so buys her lunch and becomes her new best friend.  From there, the romantic relationship you planned on having with her is gonna go down hill.  Because the moment she met you, you gave her the wrong impression. <br>  <br>                 One good way to start talking with a woman you really like is to find a way to run into her on accident.  This may sound corny at first, but believe me, women love a good story to tell their friends on how they met a great guy.  From there, introduce yourself to her in a smooth fashion.  When you get a conversation going ask her in a sweet way, out on a date.  A lady always likes it when a man gets down to the point.  And if she declines, don't worry, there's plenty of other fish in the sea.<br>  <br>                  So, my advice to you at first, would be to go to the mall with a group of guy friends, have a good time, but also be on the lookout.  Because I garantee there are groups of women who aren't necessarily there to shop.........I should know.  It's been my excuse plenty of times before.<br>  <br>                   Oh, and one last pointer, if you get her on a date, during the conversation, pay close attention and keep eye contact!!  That's the most important thing to a women, to know that you care about what she has to say.|`|AA10145813	well if you see a woman at the mall shopping just start by saying you like what ever she may have in her hand. or if you really want to just talk just ask her how she is doing.|`|cf02fbd63abd4c79930a4736e6b6f70faa	mr johnson get a life<br>  <br>  women dont want to go shopping and find a man its annoying DO NOT try to pick a girl up shopping|`|fcf3657a6a2569d2770c5f6d29381f94aa	the best places to meet women are places that they like to go alot.

AA11928159	I can  remember having similar problems all the way through high school; and it was all due to my own shyness and insecurities.  And I'll tell you a secret.  Do what you can to push past the shyness and allow yourself to socialize with them (and other kids in school)<br>  <br>  I did this by joining powder puff football team (all girls). Only the popular girls---also considered the high rollers---did  stuff like that.  I couldn't convince my other friends to join with me.  So I did so on my own and I made the decision that I WAS going to do this and I was going to have fun at it!  EVen if it killed me!  <br>  <br>  Well, I did and I earned a lot respect from them and for myself!  Also, I did make new friends.  I ended up with 2 sets of friends and I was satisfied with that.  And myself.... For finding a way to push past that terrifble feeling of shyness....and the fear. ...  <br>  <br>  My advice to you is to engage them in an interesting conversation....possibly by asking them a question or something like that.  Laughter is always good.  Learn some new jokes and make 'em bust a gut laughing!  lol... Do you see what I mean?  Let them see that Yes you're a little shy, but not all of the time!  That you really aren't a geek and can be fun to hang with.  <br>  <br>  BTW, I was in the 12th grade when that event happened in my life.  I WISH it happened when I was in the 9th grade.  My high school years would've been a lot more fun than they were!  <br>  <br>  Remember this: YOU ARE JUST AS GOOD AS THEY ARE!!  And don't you ever let them or anyone else let you think otherwise!!  If you do that, you'll be okay!  <br>  <br>  Peace and good luck to ya!|`|5c8d2c3f5738a732ae4f07570cd003fdaa	you can be something in the middle! those popular girls are popular only NOW, but you will see what will happen only in 3 years!                                                                                       they won't be so beautiful!even geeks will be better than them! i think there's someone who's not popular and not geek. make new friends!|`|8dfe5debe6c0daa8e0404fe0fd4a6253aa	well , i once have the same kind of feeling too but i am on the popular and going popular stage.some kind in the middle . i am not from america school or something so things might be different,so watever still givve you my advice: my friends once told me that popular people are popular for being hated.that is quite true . if you were stuck with the geeks why not make them beautiful and cool[if some are able to svae] in this way you are the saver! the leader. the populars are popular only when people think they are. make them chage their views,let them think you are cool.most of all yes confidence. it comes from within.when you are walking be proud or may be listen to some music that help and walk to the rythm of the beat, in that way people would take notice and look at you.and dressing is importent never copy others,they would think you are a poser ,dress your own way even when it is weird.if not, be cunning oti destroy them.lol.insult people with a smile. good luck|`|9476c19bf1bddecdb8e0e05e74db706eaa	I Am UNIQUE!<br>  <br>  thats the thought thats going to give you a boost.Have it in ur mind all the time and Dont mind any other gals.

They're just a bunch of bitches. Why would u want to hang out with people like them? <br>  <br>  Aren't there any other kind of people in ur class then the geeks and the popular girls? If there are then make friends with them. Don't be shy.|`|f7aab8809017bea27386f96548df371faa	Ignore the wanna be's who will never succeed in anything but getting laid.<br>  I was a bit shy in school, and didn't have many friends, but thats how I liked it, just a group of about seven, and we all were different. I didn't really connect with any of them because I didn't go out every weekend to the popular hang out, and I definitely didn't spend the night at someones house.<br>  One day I started JROTC and met some people like me, mostly guys of course. I have had those friends since then. I excelled in my class and and met older people in high school and had a blast. So, try joining some kind of extra curicular activity at school.Be patient the fun will come to you.<br>  I unfortunatly had an expirence in being "the most popular girl in school" one year and hated it. I moved to a knew town and had a cousin who was a cheerleader and everyone thought I was so cool because I wasn't from their and the only redhead there as well. I had a senior boyfriend, just turned 16, and then they wanted me to go out drinking with them. Not that I minded the drinking at that time but things got out of hand and went down hill.<br>  Everybody was talking about it and I said something out right rude about it and then I was the "enemy". Needless to say I finally reconnected with the friends I belonged with and had a good time. I moved back before the was up, but when I left I was considered a stuck up Bitty. Not that I cared at all.<br>  I get along better with guys than I do girl's, so just relax and like I said before ignore the wanna be's, and wait for it. Sometimes you do have to contribute a little in order to make friends.

e9548933bb1a59a3ec420c1c8901d30baa	You shouldn't be paranoid it's natural to sometimes need some space to yourself. Maybe there's something around his house he needs to get done. I'm sure he still wants to see you. I was once told that if you spend too much time together that neither of you will want to admit it, too. So when he doesn't ask you to do stuff don't worry---just enjoy your free time and read that book you've been meaning to or something.|`|4e88053f1d509402a86c74e2da0bd6f1aa	Umm, he's entitled to his own space sweetie...

You  are being paranoid, he's entitled to time with his friends, apart from you- such as you are entitled to your own life. Just because your his girlfriend doesn't mean your entire life revolves around this guy- as far as the comment of wanting to spend time with you, if my guy wanted to spend all his time with him- I'd feel suffocated and not being able to do things for myself- and you also might be considered smothering and clingy wanting to spend every waking moment with him.|`|138bfe143b08ba4fd80d1cd77590df6baa	Everyone needs their space!

Use condoms. There are too many sexually transmitted diseases floating around. The pill does not protect you from these diseases. Also, if you are not an organised person and miss a pill or two, you leave yourself open to pregnancy. To make matters worse, the pill has been associated with cancer and other disease in women. Not using a condom also makes you more at risk from cervical cancer.<br>  <br>  Condoms are the best. Get a good brand and a good lover and you can't go wrong. Any guy that complains that a condom is too tight etc is having a laugh (you can fit a condom over a human head- unless his penis is that size, he's a whiny old liar). There are many different brands, and there is the perfect one out there for everyone! Also, condoms have a higher success rate at preventing pregnancy than the pill. Sex is less messy afterwards and there are no adverse side effects for either partner.<br>  <br>  Good luck :-) Stay safe!|`|0181cecad413554bec4e7547924e820caa	As soon as you start your period|`|178d30b3ec7eb62999fddfbd2bdb1433aa	when you have your period. it helps with cramps and other menstrual related symptoms. if you're taking it for the other reason (s**) then same answer [[when you have your period]]|`|8c400f8b0956209fea2f015b0b879d0aaa	you shouldn't be having sex until your married but you can when ever|`|19ac12ec81bd2102c2e5d2be877dff70aa	good question and ADDITIon to this question how do you use it........................|`|cbe1a612c11bdb267c8e9f11988e5f4caa	As  long  as   you  can  do   stuf f  with  a   guy   you    can  take  it  , but    you     have   to  be  18-19  to  buy   birth  control.

She is taking all of the financial risk in building a building, and she needs to get her money back if you guys decide to sell the land or if there is a land dispute/disagreement. Land is worth way more with a building on it!<br>  It is also good to just have an agreement/plan for the division of land so that there will be fewer problems later.<br>  It may be your own land, but it is also your sisters, your moms and whoever else it was left to.

Te lo digo porque lo primero que ocurrira es que diran "que hiciste para provocarlo?"  Asi somos en Mexico.....  por otro lado ve con tu departamento legal y pregunta que si es posible hacer una demanda por acoso sexual a traves de ellos (esto normalmente no es posible, pero pone sobre aviso a los legales de que les puede llegar una demanda de esas y no les conviene).  Esto te deja en ventaja porque tienes pruebas, testigos y apoyo de la empresa.  Durante todo el asunto NO LE AVISES AL JEFE lo que estas haciendo porque dejara de hacerlo inmediatamente.  SI, eso es lo que quieres, pero piensa que no has de ser ni la primera ni la ultima, por tanto hay que detenerlo en seco.  Sera latoso pero efectivo.  Al final podria hasta perder su trabajo aquel, pero eso se merece por no tratarte con el respeto y profesionalismo debido.   Si despues de todo esto (y es posible que pase, lo he sabido) la empresa no te da el apoyo necesario y solo ponen sobre aviso al jefe, te hara la vida imposible.... pero no cedas y aguanta.

a1769d41fa92e505c71b7817faef4048aa	Okay the best possible way to do this... First of all guys get thrown off by games, so tell him straight off. And communication is the best thing to do, so tell him you realize he is older, tell him everything you realiz and feel. Spill it all out more information and communication really helps. Don't hide anything (of course unless you feel uncomfortable doing it.) Do what you will. But dont get over thrown if he doesnt show affection back. DOnt expect anything back (not saying he wont do it) because if you do, and then he doesnt, it hurts and puts everything in turmoil. Be patient and make the right choices when taking the next step.

You need to gain some maturity and know this: <br>  We all have a right to a past and if he had four women or forty it's in the PAST. he is married to YOU now. and if you want to keep it that way, let the past stay where it is. What he did and with whom before he married you is over and done with. It's not that the dude was a serial killer that might slit your throat at any moment. He just had a few relationships before you. Get the difference? Make sure when you argue to argue constructively and about things that actually matter. Do not use insults and degrade the guy, men's egos are fragile and it really is useless to mention his past, (four women is nothing, believe me.) <br>  If you are to have  children your marriage will gain another dimension which will require you to work together as a team. and you do not want your future children to have a bad opinion of their father.

Obviously he does not want to be a father, regardless of how many sex partners he's had.   You do realize that "pulling out" is only like 25% effective.

Maybe it was the wrong thing for you to do to marry your first sexual partner - if you had dated around first, you would have realized that sexual experiences is something that comes and goes, and they for the most part do not occupy a significant place in the person's present. Even the strongest of feelings and the most memorable of impressions tend to fade away in time, as new priorities take their place. Your husband's priorities now lie with you; if you keep bringing up his past, you're doing him and yourself a big disservice by keeping it alive instead of burying it (which is what it deserves). There's nothing wrong with acknowledging the past - but to keep it a part of your present life is dysfunctional. Four women is a miniscule amount; most guys I'd been with had slept with many more than that; my own number is probably nearing 30. So what? You really have to focus on your marriage - if you focus too much on the past, your relationship is doomed, might as well walk out now instead of slowly undermining it. Find constructive ways to address your problems.|`|AA11899639	if you felt this way why did you marry him- and why would you ask-how many women he had been with<br>  <br>  the past is gone- let it go --he is with you now|`|AA12066168	I am seeing lots of people tell you to "let it go," and I agree with them.  Unfortunately, you're not getting suggestions on how to do that.  The fact of the matter is that you did marry your husband in spite of his sexual history.  Marrying him, I would think, implies acceptance of him.  If you choose to marry someone, you are saying, in effect, "I accept you completely."  Therefore, for you to complain about his history with other women is wrong of you, because you're telling him that your acceptance of him in marriage was a lie.  It's not like he can go back in time and make different choices, so you are beating him up over something he can't do anything about.  Therefore, to move on, you need to do one thing: aplogize.  Apologize sincerely for bringing up women of the past, for behaving angrily toward him about them, and for bringing them up in arguments.  Then, as part of a good apology, take the final step and repent.  Tell him you will do your best never, ever to bring up those other women again, no matter what the circumstances.  And then follow through.  Once you apologize, and he has forgiven you, you will find it much easier to stop thinking about the women before you.|`|3eb39e8ea80bf1a12c0f8d30af8930dcaa	be glad it was only 4 women he has had unprotected sex with - hell, be glad he has only been with 4 women period.  my bf said he was with 25 - i am sure that the number is probably much higher.  but i think that you would be jealous if he had only 1 woman before you.  i know it can be hard to supress jealousy, but you need to try.  be glad he's pulling out, then you don't have to worry about the goo in your panties or lack of panties and running down your thigh.|`|F6jzuFPQaa	well, i'll tell you what... ive been married for about a year and im very happy with my husband. we do have sexual relations, he has been with other girls, but that was in the past, i dont worrie about it!

I doubt there are many men around that don't have some sort of a past that would concern you so you better let it go if you do not want to ruin your marriage. <br>  If him not wanting to *** inside you is a problem, see if he will *** in your mouth.  If he won't do that, you will want to hire a P.I. to check him out.|`|eed14410225060beec05cd0d99586f73aa	You need to let go.

7649088338ba21b87bd529e7549790c6aa	ABSOLUTELY!<br>  I'm here in TX and have actually had to deal with this issue personally. He CAN stop you. <br>  If you leave this state you can be arrested for kidnapping. <br>  <br>  But maybe...you should mention to him just how much money he owes on back child support, and threaten to start collecting. He may back down. Sounds like a loser.|`|90a94d536b5d7092b5b6e71868cc58bdaa	YES THEY CAN! Trust me, I know first hand. My initial divorce decree said that I couldn't even leave the county of was living in, but I had it changed to say that I could live in that county and the ones surrounding it, however I can not leave the state. It is completely up to the judge in your case, not up to you or your ex. If your ex makes a good enough arguement that you moving would make it almost impossible for him to have a relationship with his child, then a judge may very well take his opinion into consideration and not allow you to leave the state. <br>  <br>  It happens all the time in Texas. Best thing you can do is, have all the evidence that you can showing his lack of interest, past history, etc. That way, the judge may be more likely to allow you to move out of state. He still may make you meet your ex halfway, or pay for half of the plane ticket to fly your son to him, or make you two take turns flying your son back and forth. In Texas, you never know what a judge will decide. I have seen it time and time again down here.|`|6fab959502d2591cc6cf18b6a0df55f9aa	no....call a lawyer right away...good luck|`|AA11899639	yes, the state can tell you that- but you will most likely get to have your son visit his dad during the summer.Unless you can prove otherwise(the reason why that shouldn't happen) in any case talk to a lawyer|`|afc450c272a8e7cbe986f3278a12edf0aa	if your ex never had papers for custody drawn up there isnt much he can do now.

If he sees your son regularly and still pays no support, that is your fault for not pursuing and will have nothing to do with the courts decision. They do what is best for the child and keeping him in close contact with both parents is what they want. If he is getting an attorney, I suggest you get one too and just prepare to not go anywhere.|`|550d6951c5399f73fd6046cf430dfa16aa	i have hear of stuff like that happening. but if he never pays child support a or anything and you have proof of that  he will have a hard time getting that one|`|6d335ff07bb08c2ac3eb44809f2e88a7aa	Possibly.  I know that some states prohibit moving a child's residence out of state without written consent of the other parent or a court order allowing it.  Consult a lawyer ASAP.|`|AA11100707	YES YES YES It is entirely possible. Many states and the presiding judges therein will rule [and have done so] that the child cannot be taken out of state if it will create and undue visitation hardship on the other parent....You need to get a lawyer to advise you ASAP|`|AA11170195	Depends on the child support order...usually with extreme cases, the judge can order the child not be removed from the state, but usually no....|`|a3f2457aa73bf77b6ff5d8dbfbc3dbefaa	They cannot make you stay, BUT you could be ordered by the court to pay for all expenses to deliver you child for visitation.  There is nothing you can do to stop the guy, you can only hope that he cannot afford to pay for all that, it will cost him a bundle.<br>  <br>  Don't act afraid, try to get the court to make your son's birth father pay for your lawyer, you need one!!<br>  <br>  I am so sorry that you are going through this, it should be a happy time for you, with your new beginning.|`|aff114646e4619a8d3355cacb518d39caa	Actually they can.  I would say get a good lawyer on this cause the state can either say you can't leave or that the custody goes to your ex husband.  Remember he has his rights to see the kid also so that has to be thought of also before a move.|`|d4baa570e228ef8bb8a2c4d28c935c7aaa	Yes the Texas can.  You need to get a attorney right away and start filing the necessary paperwork to make your move legitimate.  Get the law on your side by doing the right thing.  <br>  <br>  If the father of your son has not established paternity legally, that may be a whole seperate issue and may make things much simpler for you.<br>  <br>  Talk to an attorney- that way you know you have dotted all your I's and crossed your T's.|`|c0aede154d890d4ff3c7e2f93610dfb0aa	Well first of all if you were never married to your child's father and there has been no court orders set in then you can take your child wherever you would like.  I'm not positive about Texas law but in Oklahoma divorced couples w/ children must provide the other parent with written notice at least two weeks before the move.  You must provide him w/ the address, telephone, number and the name of the school that the child will attend.  Both of you need to get together and decide what type of visitation you want him to have.  If he does hire an attorney they will pretty much file in court and have you go to a visitation hearing.

Decent guys are always looking for good women. You need to be the kind of woman that attracts decent guys.

8383cb5f8e740ea6869df1ec316508c5aa	I have corresponded with some here that have asked swinger questions.  I'd say it is their own business and nobody's but God to judge.  Actually, sorry to disappoint you, most of them are well-adjusted lust connoisseurs.|`|vC1lW619aa	I had a friend in high school and his parents where swingers....he hated them with a passion because of it.<br>  <br>  Im 27 now|`|00022c7590414ed841e07a5d33d1347faa	I say what the hell you get married for?|`|77622be92ab404409f818db551a4987aaa	We are swingers and know many swingers here in the local scene.  We don't "know" the all... LOL  But, we are good acquaintances and friends with many.<br>  <br>  I'd day 95% of them are very happily married, socially and sexually well-adjusted people.<br>  <br>  Of course (as others have mentioned) there are those that try to use swinging to "fix" or "spice-up" a waning relationship. They somehow think that having sex with others will magically repair all the damage that years of neglect of each other and the accompanying resentment has created.  They quickly find out that it just give them one more thing to argue about and resent each other for.  These are the ones that get divorced. But then again, they would have got divorced anyway, swinging just hastened the marriage's demise.<br>  <br>  How is our relationship?  Rock solid and stable. We are each other's best friend. We are like two teenagers in love, all the time.  We talk all the time.  We love being together.  We even car pool these days even though we work at separate locations just so we can spend more time together.  When we are at work we text message each other all day long. We are always touching or holding hands. Our friends say we are the happiest couple they know... and most of them don't know about our private life.<br>  <br>  Why are we this way?  Because we have removed sex as THE reason that we are married. As Intuition says (that posts here), we have taken sex down of the alter and we no longer worship it as THE reason we stay together.  It is part of our relationship, but not THE relationship.  Taking sex out of the equation in this manner has clearly defined why we are married to each other and not other people.  There are lots of people in this world that we could have great sex with. But we can only have everything else we have (see above) with each other.<br>  <br>  My wife is my best friend. She is my confidant. She knows my deepest, darkest secrets and she still loves me. I don't have to put on a mask around her for fear that she'll run away. She loves me for who I am, not who she wants me to be.<br>  <br>  It all comes down to honesty, trust, and honor with each other. Things I will never betray in my wife and she never will in me. We don't have to. We don't fear each other, therefore we can be honest and open about anything.<br>  <br>  Now, I'm not saying everyone should be swingers. Some have this same type of relationship and don't swing. Most however, do not.  We were close before we started swinging (that is why we could swing successfully), but swinging gave it the push it needed to evolve.<br>  <br>  Swinging simply is an extension of our great relationship and the great sex we have together.  It's not replacement sex like some would believe.  It's wanting each other to experience everything they can in life, and not being afraid of letting them do it. It's being secure in ourselves, in each other, and in our relationship.<br>  <br>  It works well for us and many, many others. But, it doesn't work for everyone.  It's simply knowing this about yourself and acknowledging so without being judgmental of those that live life differently, in any manner.<br>  <br>  For some good information about swingers, from swingers, check-out The Swingers Board forums.|`|AA11412999	Lots of good, accurate answers here.  I think there should be a distinction made between couples who are swingers, and couples who have TRIED swinging.  The ones who have tried it, and went into it with good, solid relationships with healthy communication skills, are the ones who backed away and decided to close that chapter, curiosity quenched, and the wiser for it.  Now they are monogamous because they choose to be, because it is what suits their marriage the best.  The other couples who tried it who went into it unprepared, recklessly, and without that strong foundation of a good relationship that I mentioned, these are the ones you hear the horror stories from.  Unfortunately, there are many of them.  They've tried swinging for the wrong reasons (to "fix" a lagging sex life, subconsciously looking to replace their mate, feeling that they "deserve" sex with other people, etc.) and they pay the price for it.  As was mentioned, it's not something to take lightly.  <br>  <br>  The message board that RacerX mentioned (<a href="http://www.swingersboard.com)" rel="nofollow">http://www.swingersboard.com)</a> is an excellent place for information and advice.  And about 99% of the time, couples who have hit roadblocks are told to NOT move forward until they have talked things through.  If they see  enough "red flags", the couple is told to walk away from it right now.  Put it out of their heads, and focus on getting their relationship in shape.  It's just not worth it otherwise.  None of us wants other couples to ruin their relationships over this!  Aside from the bad karma, practically speaking, it tends to rain on the whole parade when one couple at a party creates a scene or someone storms out or your play partner bursts into tears or a fit of rage.  That...is NOT fun.  If they can't handle it, they shouldn't do it.<br>  <br>  MYTH: They can't really be in love if they want other people.<br>  <br>  FACT: We do it BECAUSE we are in love.  Because we can.  We see each other as more than just a convenient source of good sex (although we are that to one another, too).  I don't want my husband's formidable sexuality to be limited because of a silly rule that doesn't make sense to either of us.  Seeing him with another woman does not hurt me at all, because I know that it is irrelevant to the health of our relationship.  We have both promised one another that we would never allow sex to determine the course of our relationship ever again.  It's apples and oranges.  It truly has been separated from it, and yet this has not diminished neither love nor sex for us.  We still highly value and respect both.  <br>  <br>  MYTH: It will always, always, always ruin a relationship. <br>  <br>  FACT: 12 year marriage, swinging experience for 5 of those, and currently back to a "monogamous break" due to a very busy life.  No end to our marriage in sight, and if there were, it certainly wouldn't be because of swinging.  Remember, we made a promise.<br>  <br>  MYTH:  Swingers have no idea what real committment is about.  They have no value for marriage.<br>  <br>  FACT: That is absolute fiction.  Sexual monogamy does not equal committment.  Committment is being inadvertently hurt by one another's mistakes and readily forgiving for it, knowing that they'll need to forgive us someday, too.  Committment is looking past the circumstances of today and seeing the bigger picture, understanding that we are with one another because we choose to be, and loving the soul of this other person even though they evolve as people throughout their lives.  Oh yes, we understand committment.<br>  <br>  And we value marriage more than most.  We abhorr cheaters.  Cheaters are opportunistic, parasitic cowards who value themselves and their sexual gratification over their spouse's needs and feelings.  Why be married if you just want to sleep around?  Isn't that a question swingers get a lot?  Seems to me the door swings both ways...  What we do doesn't qualify as adultery.  Adultery is wrong because it hurts and dishonours - essentially steals from - the very person you made a promise to to never do such a thing to.  Swinging does none of these things.  If it hurt us, we wouldn't do it.  But it doesn't.  So why not?  God made rules for good reasons.  All we did was try to understand why the rule was in place, realized it didn't apply, and so got rid of it between us.  Yes, we can do that.  It IS our marriage, is it not?|`|ec1237ce8417fcd5290d706d99025bb7aa	Personally, I've only known "two" couples. Not enough to make a judgment about the stability of their relationship, but both couples are now divorced, for what that's worth. Very subjective of me, but I "felt" they were searching for excitement they hadn't been able to find in each other. One I'd thought was a friend, planned some trip or other, & when I found out it was to be a threesome, I said thanks but no thanks. They were both ENRAGED. Ah well, ships passing in the night...just not my "style." Without further research, I can't but speculate it's a sublimation for something. Don't quote me, please.|`|5GZFeuEzaa	We have several friends who are swingers.  Some have good relationships and some have bad but that is the same in all relationships even if you are not swingers.  I personally would never swing because it would kill me to see my husband with someone else but a lot of couples do it.  If you asked our swinger friends they would tell you that it the excitement of being with someone else and that they love their spouses.  It is a BIG step in a relationship and one that shouldn't be taken lightly because once you do it you can never take it back.|`|ZPGSkJwoaa	You might be surprised, it's possible that you DO know some swinger couples, but just aren't aware that they are in the lifestyle.  We don't wear loads of gold chains, or perm our hair, or dress like Austin Powers.  Short of what we choose to do with our recreational time, we're pretty much the same as everyone else.<br>  <br>  Most of the swingers I know have a very stable relationship, but a small percentage are going through, or have been through, some problems.  Then again, it's no different then the percentage of vanilla couples we know that have had problems.  In fact, I know many more swinger couples that have been married 10+ years to each other then I do vanilla couples.<br>  <br>  Why do we do it?  It really comes down to a simple answer.  We enjoy it, the same reason people go fishing, or on vacations, or bowling.  The biggest problem those outside of the lifestyle seem to have is the seperation of love and sex.  While we may have sex with others, we only love our true partners.  Sex is recreational.  Many have said that sex is nothing without love.  While I can't agree with that (sorry, sex is still good!), I will say that recreational sex doesn't even compare with the sex you have with a life partner.  That is where love comes into it.<br>  <br>  Think of it in something totally innocuous (I probably murdered that word).  I've been deep sea fishing with buddies, and really had a great time.  Last year, I went deep sea fishing with my two sons.  Watching both of them reel in a couple of huge fish, seeing the looks on their faces, and the total fun we had on that trip, nothing compared.  It was still fisihing, and I had fun on both trips, but this took it to a totally different level.|`|oPPd7jFyaa	My wife and I have been swingers for several years, so I can speak with some authority on the subject.<br>  <br>  Our relationship is very stable and loving.  As is the relationship with many of the swingers we know.  <br>  <br>  I can say with certainty though, that as a whole, most swingers don't have stable relationships. They do it for the wrong reasons. (usually unhappy with their relationship)<br>  <br>  Why do it?  It's fun and pleasurable of course.  It can also be very erotic and bonding for a loving couple to be able to share something so intimate together without the jealousies so many other couples have.<br>  <br>  Swinging is playing with fire.  It is very dangerous.  If you are not stable, you will get burnt.  It is not for everyone.  Only a strong healthy relationship can sustain through such an emotional test.<br>  <br>  .

hhatTZVnaa	I understand exactly how you feel, but the thing is, you shouldnt let it get to you that much. You said that you have had bad relationships in the past, but you cannot let that affect the boyfriend you have now, because it isnt fair towards him.<br>   I had to learn this too, because I have had a guy cheat on me before, and another who tried to use me, and I am now in a serious relationship with my boyfriend now and we have been dating for a year and 6 months, and I have (And sometimes still) accuse him for cheating or doing other stuff like that because my past boyfriend have, but, the thing is, girls only worry like that when they really care, ya know? <br>  But, you guys have been together for a long time, you should know how he is and if he is actually capable of cheating, and I only think that you are worrying yourself over nothing. Besides, its her boyfriend that works with him, right? Well, that right there shouldnt worry you at all, because its her boyfriend, it's not like she is gunna try to get with your man while her boyfriend is there, ya know? <br>  Besides, it was over 2 years ago, to make yourself feel better, just think, what were you doing 2 years ago? You have liked other guys before too right? SO you cannot really blame him about that, because its not like you guys were thinking that it would affect u in the future, ya know? Sorry if that was a lil confusing, but, its just, the past is the past, there is a reason you guys are together now, so do not let that girl get in the way of you 2 loving eachother. I know its hard, because It is still hard for me sometimes too, but, in reality, it really isnt anything to be worried about... because unless you have actual proof, you should just focus on the positive parts in your relationship.<br>  Just do not stress so much, he obviuosly loves you because even after all of the fights over her, he is still with you... and by you fighting about her, your letting her win, so dont worry about her, ok? Your his girlfriend, she isnt, so dont worry about it... Everything will be fine, no worries!!! Good luck!!!|`|0676CScpaa	You should sit your self down and ask yourself if you trust your boyfriend. If the answer is yes than you should not have a hard time letting go of your fear of him cheating.  if the answer is no than you need to have a long hard chat with your boyfriend about it and find reasons to trust him.|`|WrXX4K85aa	well first you have to make sure you talk to him and tell him why you are the way you are, if he says he's willing to stick around and help you work it out then cool....you just have to seriously and consciously make a change in yourself, just to let you know, sometimes something like this is beyond you helping yourself, its psychological!!!!|`|Yl4K5Lwzaa	Go to therapy, or even couple's therapy.|`|c8e542cacc4df44bda486b0be8ee16cfaa	Just learn to trust your guy.

YEc5o3Osaa	siento mucho no ser profesional, pero te dare mi experiencia como he alcanzado a perdonar a las personas que me desean un mal.<br>  Sabes, en primer lugar, cuando me ofenden busco a callar ante las ofensas que me estan diciemndo, ya que puedo decir algo al calor del momento que despues pueda que se revierta hacia a mi y me arrepienta, posteriormente dejo que todo esa energía positiva que recibi, salga de mi, dandome tiempo por la noche a meditar sobre lo sucedido y si es posible a desahogarme por medio de la oración (no rezo), en mi caso yo no lloro pero si tu lo puedes hacer hazlo, te sentiras mejor. Busca encontrar los puntos positivos y negativos de la situacion, tanto los tuyos como los de la persona que te agredió, trata de encontrar una razon de su actuación y posteriormete buscales la solución mas adecuada alejada de todo pasionalismo y efervecencia emosional. Busca dentro de ti, paz, por medio de la escucha de musica de relajación y permite que esta te lleve a los lugares y parajes más preciosos que puedas imaginar, esto son el objeto de que el agravio que sufristes paresca tan peque?o ante la belleza que estas experimentando en ese momento, poco a poco la paz interior llegara a ti y te llenaras de energía positiva, de tal forma que iradiaras energía positiva, la cual te servira para cuando te acerques a esa persona que te ofendio. Ya que ante cualquier fuerza de energía positiva nadie podra atacarte tan fuerte de nuevo y te sugiero que aunque tu no tengas culpa alguna en el agravia que sufristes seas tu el que pida perdon, se que alguien puede verlo como tonto lo que te digo, pero veras que tu te sentiras bien, y si esa persona no te perdona, tu te estaras librando de un peso y bajando el costal de culpas que puedas llevar en tus espaldas y descanzaras. Despues de esto deja pasar un tiempo sin tener contacto con esta persona (no tan largo ni tan corto) de forma tal que le des tiempo que lo piense y que no sienta acoso de tu parte y en un dado caso te llame o te encuentres con esta persona y te saluda se cordial y gentil, no muestres rencor, poque este sentimiento se revierte. y sonriele que te hara muy feliz y sentiras relajación y bienestar. Espero amigo que este proceso que te he explicado y que a mi me ha dado resultado te sirva a ti. Me alegra que este buscando perdonar, ya que la ira y la venganza nunca terminan bien.|`|200c6fe93f4d1fda474d8465459ec34faa	Si alguien que tu hallas ofendido o insultado,tu tienes que sentir pesar en tu mente y corazon,se llama arrepentimiento verdadero y que estas segura de que lo puedes hacer, vas con la persona que ofendiste a pedirle perdon por lo que hiceste y que nunca lo volveras hacer.<br>  asi quedaras libre del error que cometiste,y abondonas el error cometido,el que se arrepiente de sus pecado y cumple los mandamientos del Se?or seran perdonado,por Dios tambien.|`|8bcdcff739f8a8e34a43eb41b55e867caa	me pusiste a pensar creo que eso solo es inercia, cuestiones de valores, creo que para eso no hay algun proceso solo se perdona|`|37a2e8246d995fece8e76b779a3a2952aa	Yo no soy  profesional y este es mi punto personal de vista. OK. El perdón no se otorga porque uno así lo decida, sino porque así lo sientes. Cuando perdonas es borrón y cuenta nueva, no se trata de olvidar, sino que el suceso que emérita el perdón, no hiera tu corazón cada vez que lo recuerdas. Si te lastima es no perdonaste de corazón. Cuando algo te molesta o te hiere antes de perdonar o enojarte hay que oír la explicación de la persona o personas envueltas en el asunto, de esa manera es mas fácil perdonar, entendiendo las cosas. Si es algo que no entiendes o que entiendes pero no aceptas entonces date la vuelta y no vuelvas a tener relación alguna con esta persona o personas. Pero no guardes rencor eso, solo te lastimara mas a ti, analiza lo muchas veces en tu cabeza hasta que te acostumbres a la idea y finalmente perdona te a ti mismo por los sentimientos negativos que tal o cuál persona despierta, cuando lo hayas hecho sierra la puerta a ese suceso y veras que ya no te duele tanto como al principio. Ojo cuando la confianza se pierde, ya no hay nada que hacer, podrás perdonar pero confiar como antes nunca.|`|46521d83a36c190c4c9d9be491533001aa	No soy profesional, pero mi opinion al respecto es  la siguiente:<br>  <br>  el perdon es una declaracion, una declaracion modifica el mundo, es asumir un compromiso, es mirar para adelante ...<br>  para poder perdonar, tenes que estar convencido que eso es lo que queres hacer, es una eleccion para seguir tu vida sin rencores<br>  te podrias preguntar ?para que te sirve estar en un estado de NO PERDON, que emociones tienes? y ...<br>  ?que pasaria con tus emociones, en que se modificarian tus dias si ELEGIS PERDONAR?<br>  <br>  Considero que el tema es ?que queres hacer con esta situacion?|`|c422d5e6245ed4b26521dfc00e846ddeaa	SUPONGO QUE TENDRAS QUE HABER PRIMERO UNA PERSONA QUE TE PIDA PERDON; YA QUE EL PERDON SE "OTORGA" A QUIEN LO SOLICITA.<br>  <br>  ASI QUE SINO TE PIDEN PERDON NI TE PREOCUPES.<br>  <br>  Y SI TE ESTAN PIDIENDO QUE LE OTORGUES EL PERDON, SIMPLEMENTE HAZLO, VERAS CON EL TIEMPO TE CURARAS.|`|xTsE7TeCaa	Hola Diana!! para empezar de que perdon hablamos, de que te perdonen a ti algo o de que tuperdones a alguien?<br>  Si es para que alguien te perdones es hablando con esa persona y diciendole los motivos reales por lo que hiciste las cosas, no es facil pero es el primer paso para que te vuelvan a tener confianza, despues de eso, la misma persona ofendida te dira que hacer para obtener el perdon.<br>  Pero si la cuastión es que tu quieres perdonar a alguien, es un proceso largo y quizá doloroso, para empezar debes de analizar el porque te dolio tanto lo que te hicieron, despues de eso, analiza cuantas cosas buenas te ha dado esa persona, luego piensa desde lo mas profundo de tu corazon que por mucho dolor que te haya ocacionado esa persona o situaciòn tu bienestra es mas importante y que nadie puede herir lo mas puro y profundo de tu alma, ademas recuerda que el odio provoca cancer, y si ya te hizo da?o esa persona, que no pase de ahi, y el perdon le da mas beneficios a quien lo otorga que a quien lo recibe, porque asi se vivie con tranquilidad y serenidad, no vale la pena nadie de que da?es tu vida con odios.

UmBUNrfpaa	You did nothing wrong! What is going on in Heathers head, she was not honest with you! Josh wasn't being clear with you. The two of them obviosly had unresolved issues about their relationship and now they don't want to look like the fools they are. Instead they are turning on you. Hold your head up high, they are immature and playing games with other peoples feelings, they sound like a good match!|`|AA10397262	no you didnt.... well thats all i can say.|`|pWpH3O5Aaa	well if he always talked about heather he might of still had a few feelings for her.  instead of breaking up w/ him you could have just confronted him about it. but oh well. whats done is done. especially if he started flirting with heather again. and as for his friends hating you, that is none of their buisness. you didnt do anything wrong and Josh did. so tell them to lay off.|`|wm64zcg1aa	I don't think that you did wrong.  Relationships are so complicated!  You did not steal her boyfriend.  I think you were right to break up with him if all he talked about was Heather!  The fact that Josh and his friends are mad is beyond your control!  They sound very immature!  Hold your head up high, and ignore them!  Good luck!|`|WOUEEkZqaa	No you didn't do wrong your "friend" probably just wanted you to go out with him because she wanted to make him jealous and you ex hates you now because he got dumped don't be feeling bad you deserve better and make new friends|`|wEqpCHKfaa	you fu*ked up everyone knows that you dont go out with your best friends ex everybody knows that you must be 14 or so right.
31f6fa3ccfe85c7ee511bbdc00933245aa	Xara!<br>  <br>  Kkkkkkkkkkkk<br>  Sinceramente leia toda esta baboseira como um texto para rir e francamente espero ter sido um pouco ir?nico aqui, veja o resultado dessa salada e vamos navegar nessa maionese,  ói aí, ó:<br>   <br>  Certamente que esses homens seguem os preceitos de Economia do Mercado Comum, isto é, ao economizar suas próprias mulheres eles inclusive preservam  as reservas ambientais de suas propriedades e contribuem para dar maior fertilidade ao solo de seu domínio. Além de criar um fundo ou "bolsa" de reserva para gastos  futuros. O consumo de outras áreas (mulheres dos outros) certamente que contribui também para o contrabalan?o, isto é, muitas vezes as mulheres alheias s?o mal consumidas por seus parceiros, causando mal estar e acúmulo de reservas. Portanto esses "maridos" exportam também matéria prima para este importante mercado consumidor. Poderíamos concluir que o grande problema s?o as malhas finas do controle alfandegário que podem gerar n?o só cobran?as de tarifas, como prêmio em balas, em facas tramontina, enfim e algumas manchetes e gastos com publica??es nas páginas policiais, mas talvez com maior sorte esses  "aventureiros" possam também adquirir grandes reservas e parcerias consumidoras. Basta agir conforme as regras do bom senso. Grande teoria esta sua viu! Veja como exigiu de mim elaborar um texto destes, totalmente contrário as regras feministas. <br>  Saladas à parte, considere os que consomem apenas as suas reservas e gostem de suas mulheres!

81c2eb4412288b62d2a6dd68ca648a56aa	Creo que está mal. El famoso debate (y excusa de justificación para muchos) de si el feto tiene consciencia se me hace ridículo porque aunque no la tenga hasta el momento del nacimiento, eventualmente la llegará a tener y el terminar con esa vida también evitará que sea un individuo consciente.<br>  <br>  Por otro lado y aunque estoy completamente de acuerdo que una mujer es libre de decidir sobre su propio cuerpo no puede decidir sobre el feto porque sencillamente no le pertenece aunque este creciendo dentro de ella. Es un individuo único e independiente que por 9 meses "tomará prestada" a su mamá para alcanzar su completo desarrollo. <br>  <br>  La noción de que los hijos le pertenecen a los padres, se me hace ridícula. Son nuestros hijos, pero no son nuestros. Es decir, los padres tienen la obligación de protegerlos y ayudarlos a crecer por instino, por amor o por las razones que deseen, pero no son sus due?os y a diferencia de las constumbres de la antigua roma, no pueden decidir sobre si viven o mueren..<br>  <br>  El aborto es una manera muy cobarde de librarse de las responsabilidades que no existirian de haber tenido un poco mas de cuidado y no estoy hablando del celibato o de nada de sexo antes del matrimonio. Entiendo que somos humanos, pero que hoy en día haya embarazos no deseados, por favor. Lo entendería en las clases menos favorecidas en donde no hay educación y en donde, ironicamente, tampoco hay muchas posibilidades (economicas y de otro tipo) para el aborto.<br>  <br>  Tal ves el único caso que podría justificarlo, sería la violación totalmente comprobada y puede hablar de dos casos en donde las mujeres no aceptaron el aborto porque consideraron que los ni?os no tenian la culpa. Si hubieran decido llevarlo a cabo, también lo hubiera entendido.<br>  <br>  Pero en fin, es un tema muy controversial e independientemente de las leyes, en un asunto de consciencia y de valores y totalmente individual. La posición que yo he tomado en este tipo de casos con amigas (yo nunca he tenido directamente un problema asi), ha sido apoyarlas con la decisión que tomen sin juzgarlas independienente de mi manera de pensar.<br>  <br>  Sin embargo estamos acercandonos al momento, por culpa de la sobrepoblación, en donde el aborto deje de ser un asunto personal y se convierta en un asunto de estado.

e5jNtvIXaa	SEVEN-YEAR ITCH - "Used to describe a husband's or wife's urge to stray from his or her mate after seven years of marriage, this expression appears to have been invented by American playwright George Axelrod in his play 'The Seven Year Itch' (1952) and further popularized by the film version starring Marilyn Monroe (1955). Word and phrase hunters haven't been able to turn up any earlier use of the words in a sexual context, although seven-year itch had been used to describe a poison ivy itch that supposedly recurred once every seven years." From the "Encyclopedia of Word and Phrase Origins" by Robert Hendrickson (Facts on File, New York, 1997).|`|w8EDZZvTaa	Well, it sounds to me as if you are just two or three degrees "better" than ordinary folks.

Essa manifesta??o tinha como finalidade reivindicar a redu??o da jornada de trabalho para 8 horas diárias e teve a participa??o de centenas de milhares de pessoas. Nesse dia teve início uma greve geral nos EUA. No dia 3 de Maio houve um pequeno levantamento que acabou com uma escaramu?a com a polícia e com a morte de alguns protestantes. No dia seguinte, 4 de Maio, uma nova manifesta??o foi organizada como protesto pelos acontecimentos dos dias anteriores, tendo terminado com o lan?amento de uma bomba por desconhecidos para o meio dos policiais que come?avam a dispersar os manifestantes, matando sete agentes. A polícia abriu ent?o fogo sobre a multid?o, matando doze pessoas e ferindo dezenas. Estes acontecimentos passaram a ser conhecidos como a Revolta de Haymarket.<br>  <br>  Três anos mais tarde, a 20 de Junho de 1889, a segunda Internacional Socialista reunida em Paris decidiu por proposta de Raymond Lavigne convocar anualmente uma manifesta??o com o objectivo de lutar pelas 8 horas de trabalho diário. A data escolhida foi o 1o de Maio, como homenagem às lutas sindicais de Chicago. Em 1 de Maio de 1891 uma manifesta??o no norte de Fran?a é dispersada pela polícia resultando na morte de dez manifestantes. Esse novo drama serve para refor?ar o dia como um dia de luta dos trabalhadores e meses depois a Internacional Socialista de Bruxelas proclama esse dia como dia internacional de reivindica??o de condi??es laborais.<br>  <br>  A 23 de Abril de 1919 o senado francês ratifica o dia de 8 horas e proclama o dia 1 de Maio desse ano dia feriado. Em 1920 a Rússia adota o 1o de Maio como feriado nacional, e este exemplo é seguido por muitos outros países.<br>  <br>  <br>  Em Portugal, só a partir de Maio de 1974 (o ano da revolu??o do 25 de Abril) é que se voltou a comemorar espontaneamente o Primeiro de Maio. Durante o Estado Novo este dia tinha a denomina??o de Dia do Trabalho e era organizado e controlado pelo Estado.<br>  <br>  Nos A?ores há a tradi??o dos "Maios" que s?o bonecos que as pessoas fazem com panos ou mesmo com bonecos que têm em casa e colocam nas varandas ou nas janelas.

ySb5fEQ4aa	AMIGA, o mar é muito, mais muito trai?oeiro, basta vc acompanhar  noticias que envolvem o mar, mas digamos que vc fosse tomar um banho de mar  , ai, dependo  da praia, mas, mesmo assim vc deve saber  nadar muito bem para enfrenta-lo, O MAR N?O TEM CABELO PARA NOS AGARRAR-MOS.  tem pessoas  que dominam muito bem a arte de viver no mar, s?o  treinados e dotados de experiência para esse fim. com fogo e agua n?o se brinca devemos sempre estar alertas e tomar  muito cuidado. Pois  quase todos os dias lemos noticias de afogamentos, principalmente nos fins de samana.|`|594089a1720d8b4af7ccb39699839036aa	E como é !!! Basta uma descuidada que você n?o consegue mais voltar para a margem. Parece até que o mar te segura e te leva mais para o fundo !|`|86c963ea9f578eb933ea079cb81f7320aa	N?o podemos chamar o Mar de trai?oeiro, porque ele só te agride quando você n?o respeita seus limites, você aproveita dele com todas as formas de agre??es, se atira nele, bate nele, urina nele, e ele passivamente nos suporta sem reclamar, agora se desrespeitar seus limites paga o pre?o.|`|a5d445a3dab67e38711976f94a514a79aa	Conhe?o, convivi com o mar por 13 anos, ele n?o é trai?oeiro, ele está na dele e é a maneira que a natureza lhe fez, mas se vc for de encontro a ele sem conhecer, poderá se dar mal e dizer que ele é trai?oeiro, o homem deve respeitar e aceitar como ele é, perdi um amigo que n?o sabia nadar, estava em uma praia e n?o sabia que lá tinha o tal "perol" é um baixo relevo no fundo que vc está com agua na cintura, com um passo a frente, vc cai em uma profundidade bem maior, mas repito, o mar esva lá quieto, foi vc que foi a ele.|`|33ba1d63ad3422c063fa15a2f45ccdc6aa	é perigoso sim.<br>  Uma vez salvei uma pessoa que estava no raso mas caiu em uma vala e estava sendo levada.

O Mar, assim como os rios, podem mudar repentinamente.  você pode entrar em um mar calmo e em quest?es de segundos ele virar e se tornar super batido. Eu já quase morri afogada por causa disso, e conheci um rapaz que morreu... olha que ele era pescador e surfista, super acostumado com mar forte, mas foi pego de surpresa.<br>  Antes de entrar no mar ou em rios é sempre bom perguntar aos "nativos" da regi?o como é o mar ou rio ali, e se é seguro entrar.

6z1neletaa	Hola! Desde el punto de vista legal no puedo ayudarte... pero me pongo en tu lugar y entiendo tu preocupación por la formación de tu nena.  Cuando están peque?os los ni?os imitan todo lo que ven y son como esponjitas que absorben los estímulos del medio que les rodea, también sus experiencias afectivas los marcaran por el resto de sus vidas. Los 6 primeros a?os son esenciales en la vida de todo ser humano.<br>       Ahora bien es importante la objetividad cuando se trata de pensar en lo mejor para ellos, tu situación es difícil y tus miedos justificados, pero a veces nuestras decisiones se ven afectadas por nuestros resentimientos, recuerda que aunque imperfecto él va a ser el padre de tu hija por el resto de su vida y por lo que cuentas a diferencia de otros que los abandonan por completo él tiene el interés de seguir compartiendo con ella.  En mi opinión lo más importante en primer lugar es que establezcas una buena forma de comunicación con él, esa va a ser la base sobre la cual tu podrás tener confianza para dejar que salga con la ni?a o no.<br>         Si la beba vive contigo y tu ves por ella en todos los aspectos de su vida (alimentación, aseo, cuidados y formación) tu tienes mayor poder de decisión como para poner pautas y establecer condiciones (tipo de comida que puede ingerir, programas de televisión, juegos etc) las cuales tienes que hacerle saber a él.  Dile que estás pensando en la posibilidad de dejar que se la lleve pero que para ti es una decisión difícil porque la ni?a está aún peque?a (lo cual es muy válido)... tus otras razones (con respecto a la madre de él y sus defectos) sólo crearán barreras que interferiran con los buenos acuerdos a los que puedan llegar. <br>           Después de expresarle tu preocupación dile que necesitas confiar en que la ni?a va a estar bien cuidada, que te gustaría que en un principio la siguiera viendo en tu casa, y poco a poco acostumbrarte a la idea siempre y cuando él respete tus condiciones y opiniones respecto a la educación de la nena. Ella va a vivir contigo y tu serás la responsable por sus valores, hábitos y modales. En la medida que él acepte tus condiciones y tu sientas más confianza puedes ir cediendo primero por una ma?ana y luego todo el día hasta que la ni?a esté un poquito mas grande para dormir fuera de casa. <br>       Hay muchos lugares en los que padre e hija pueden compartir fuera de su casa (parques, etc) y el afecto que él le brinde va a ser más significativo que las malas costumbres, siempre y cuando tu afiances en ella los verdaderos valores.<br>       Preguntas si hay modo de evitar que se la lleve? como te dije no soy abogado (soy psicopedagoga) pero supongo que él como padre tiene derechos establecidos por la ley, lo mejor es que pensando en el propio bienestar de tu gran tesoro, trates de tomar distancia emocional y actuar objetivamente para conseguir que las cosas se hagan bajo tus condiciones que seguro serán las más beneficiosas si las estableces sin egoímo y apartando un poco los miedos infundados. Lo más importante es que la ni?a esté segura:   que su papá pueda cuidar que no sufra lesiones físicas, por caidas o accidentes, que esté bien alimentada (que le den las comidas a su hora, que no la atiborren de chucherías) y por supuesto estar segura de que no vaya a recibir maltratos físicos o verbales.  <br>            Deseo que puedas resolver la situación y te sientas mas tranquila...  : )|`|37a2e8246d995fece8e76b779a3a2952aa	Por la seguridad de tu hija alar galo lo mas que puedas, ahorita esta muy peque?a espera a que hable y te pueda decir si la lastimaron de alguna manera y has le ver a tu ex que lo sientes pero la  seguridad de tu hija es prioridad para ti y debería de ser lo para el, si el no tiene un lugar donde no se pueda controlar la gente que entra y sale no hay trato.

Hay muchas recomendaciones que no quiero dar pero busca a Dios acude a grupos de estudio de la biblia hacen maravillas en tu matrimonio y en uno mismo.'<br>  <br>  Recuarda desaparece de su vida sin dar explicaciones por que si no lo haces nunca vas romper el circulo. Muchas suerte|`|S1eVXH54aa	te deseo suerte porque la carne es devil
qOFMun4haa	Talk to both of them and get things organized so you won't be in the position that you are in. If you don't talk to eithe of them and just let things roll. Nothing is going to happen in ways that you want them to, in terms of finding information out that important for you. Because the world could know, they both could be dogs. So just lay back investiagate and then move forward and see what you want to do.|`|AA11151794	Mike sounds more responsible as a friend.  Raj sounds rather immature.  You cannot benefit by being with a man who has a habit of getting drunk and has little or no inherent ambition.

Which one can you be yourself around?|`|hhFzDIt9aa	Before you jump into anything maybe you should ask Mike how he feels about you. They both sound like great guys but if Mike has feelings for you he might be the better catch. He could be shy and afraid to let you know how he really feels because he fears rejection. It's not uncommon.
BlI1DuISaa	A ver Gustavo...<br>  ?Que quieres????  Llevartela a la cama y ya?  Si es asi, no te desgastes y busca en otro lado, porque no vale la pena el esfuerzo que tendrías que desarrolar para tan peque?a y efimera recompensa...<br>  <br>  Pero si te estas enamorando de ella y quieres convertirla en tu dulcinea, en tu julieta, en tu musa, pues entonces ... ADELANTE!!!  Ve por ella, puede ser el amor de tu vida y no pùedes darte el lujo de dejarla ir como ya lo hiciste una vez..<br>  <br>  ?Qué que haces?  Facil!!!!  <br>  <br>    AMALA!!!!  Porque el amor no necesita permiso. Amar es una desicion y no depende de nadie mas que de uno mismo!!!  <br>  <br>  Amala desde que piensas en ella, amala en ayunas y al despertar cada ma?ana. Amala al terminar el dia. Amala en tus sue?os, amala en tu vigilia...<br>  <br>  Amala al mirarla, que ella vea la llama de amor que bulle en tu alma por ella. <br>  <br>  Amala con la pasion del hombre que eres, con la humildad del cobarde que fuiste, con la arrogancia del que quiere lo mejor para ella.<br>  <br>  Ama su nombre y su sombra, su pelo y su figura, su risa y su silencio..  Amala antes de que ella se entere de que la amas... <br>  <br>  Y entonces, sin ninguna fecha especial de por medio, llevale una flor, con una carta breve invitandola a tomar un cafe. Tu mirada lo dira todo... Abrele la puerta del carro, cedele la acera, sé todo un caballero. <br>  En el cafe, deja que elija la mesa y el asiento, ponle la silla, preguntale que quiere tomar y pideselo tu al mesero, recuerda que ella es una REINA... redescubrela... Dios te dio dos oidos y una boca para que escuches lo doble de lo que hablas... asi que hazla hablar y callate,,, preguntale cosas de ella y de lo que piensa y escuchala...callate la boca y escuchala...con interes genuino, porque la amas ?recuerdas??<br>  <br>  Hazle saber que es muy importante para ti, con el menor numero de palabras posibles, porque lo que deberas dejar hablar es a tu corazon, no a tu deseo de poseerla.. va?<br>   <br>  Si puedes, aprendete el poema de Mario Benedetti que se llama Tactica y Estrategia... (He aqui un fragmento: Mi estrategia es ser franco, y saber que tu eres franca, para que entre los dos no halla, ni telon, ni abismos...  ?padre no?) <br>  <br>  Y preparate para decirlselo a los ojos sin titubear...<br>  <br>  Yo creo que el amor de hombre, no es un dulce empalagoso, no es  cadena que hiere, no es un codigo secreto imposible de descifrar... El amor de hombre es silencioso, no como tromba ni tornado, si no mas bien como lluvia tibia y mansa de verano... El amor de hombre edifica, construye,  protege, impulsa, respeta...<br>  <br>  Ahora, si no sabes ganar el amor de una mujer como hombre, no lo debes llorar como un ni?o, caprichoso y voluble....<br>  <br>  Se hombre esta vez.... <br>  <br>  ? AMALA !<br>  <br>  Dale tiempo (pero no mucho!!), dejalo crecer, florecer y madurar.. Mandale flores, una carta por correo, un telegrama deseandole buen dia... hazle saber que no la olvidas nunca...<br>  <br>  Y si ella es mujer para ti y tu eres el hombre para ella, no sera necesario seguir mas recetas... no sera necesario mas se?ales... Llegara ese MAGNIFICO momento en el que tu alma y la suya se conectaràn en un mirada y fluiran a travès del beso mas dulce, mas genuino, suave y autentico que en sus vidas recibiran y daran... y entonces podran vivir la vida que quieran vivir...<br>  <br>  Pero en el caso de que aun con todo lo que tu sabes hacer,  aun asi ella no te corresponde, pues entonces,??Brinca y Baila de alegria!! Te habra hecho un favor enorme porque entonces no le hecharas a perder la vida ni ella te lastimara jamas a ti<br>  <br>  En la vida se da y se toma, se encuentra y se pierde, se vive y se muere.... Asi es la vida y nunca podras ganar en todo como tampoco en todo perderas...<br>  <br>  Pero entonces asegurate de irte de su vida con dignidad, sin dramas, sin herirla y sin da?arte.. Te iras con la dignidad de aquel que sabe perder,,, con el orgullo del que sabe que hizo su mejor esfuerzo... Te iras de su lado como hombre.... ?SI!

Just tell him that things are feeling apart between you two and you want to break up. I mean lets face it no matter how you tell him he will be hurt regardless.|`|KlkUj6uFaa	I don't think there is any good way to deliver bad news but you will just have to pluck up the courage and tell him.

Just tell him, in no uncertain terms, that the relationship needs to end. If he begs you and tries to negotiate with you to stay with him, listen to him patiently and let him say whatever he needs to say, but stand firm (I know how easy it is to cave in). Reassure him that you'll still be there for him, as a friend.<br>  <br>  If you think it'll make it easier for you to stand your ground, have the conversation over the phone (unless you think he'll be a danger to himself, in which case someplace quiet but public's probably better).

Liking each other is just very natural and there is no man made aspect involved !|`|KTwT2ph3aa	i think that the hottest thing a girl can wear is a nice pair of pants and a nice shirt with your hair up and only a little makeup alot is a turn off and i personally would not even look twice at a girl who dresses slu tty|`|zL07jiv0aa	I'd guess-<br>  A girl who dresses conservativly, but in fashion. Maybe a little flattering in areas.<br>  <br>  Definitely not to the point of sweater in hot weather, and bikini's in cold. Usually, guy's like it when they find their style.
a69193d8a32dcea1f49c8b8bae3bb72baa	I would say ,hey girl ur hella fine ! ! Just like my  sister ! !
AA10164444	um...yeah.  touching and caressing your face is a clear sign that he is interested in you.|`|NwiMvY6Eaa	Well by putting your head on his shoulder is a sign, that you feel comfortable with him.  I bet if you asked him or better yet his mom she would tell you that she use to stroke his face or head to make him clam down or get comfortable.  So because he stroked your face it is like an unspoken words that says "hey I am comfortable with you and realy care about your comfort too."  <br>  <br>  Now with that said I am sure he is hoping that your head on is shoulder could be the signs of potentially making the relationship more than friends.
C9mmeZdaaa	No it isn't fair.  You can fight it, and you may or maynot win, ask yourself with your dads personality what would he do.  Did you get any of your dads personal belongings?  If so then you really got more then they did, because you can't put a price on that or the memories of your father.  Money and the fight for it will probably in the long run cost you more than you will get not to mention the headaches.|`|6b0361fd65c600b0617b3884ebc87b1eaa	Forget it, unless your rich. I just lost a family member an it would cost over $50K to contest the will. That's with a orphans court experienced attorney. I interviewed several.<br>  No guarantee.|`|AA11899639	unfortunately it may not seem fair, but if that's what her will says then it should be followed|`|c049edfa5536b651a0107995bcbc3a08aa	yes fair...it is irrelevant how much money HER children have or don't have....this was her property and she is WILLING to share with all children...EXTREMELY FAIR.|`|iDbFKygPaa	I agree with the above mentioned also.  She didn't have to leave you and your siblings anything, but she did.|`|AA10008833	Once your fathers estate went to the stepmother it became her money. You have no grounds to contest her will, actually her children would have a much better chance of contesting it than you. It sounds like your father and stepmother agreed long ago about how where the oney would go and she kept her part of the bargain. Splitting equally is correct thing to do. Now if you do attempt to contest it dont be surprised if her children  then try to cut you out completely and they would probably be successful. Final thought...why do people feel they are ENTITLED to a single dime of their parents money?
AA10217500	One would think, that he will be man enough to tell you, then you'll know|`|9a7fc9e6cc479c925675418526eddf6aaa	oh you will know...He will come to you.

acKsMyUuaa	A physical relationship is on the man from the time he meets you if he thinks you are attractive.  Online dating is no different than any other kind; men are a little more forward online (I think) b/c it seems "safer."  Be firm and know that you will eventually meet the guy who can't live without you, and will want to marry you.  As for the money, thing, well, that's a new one for me.  I have a lot of friends who do the online thing, and they have never told me that so I'm sorry this is happening to you.  I would believe that one is unusual.  Good luck!|`|0ec6592ca1f48301b9fa1dc011b9d614aa	be careful but yes it's possible|`|47ea55b6ba0073af5a70731622664575aa	maybe u should try something different...a different way of meeting guys...let them come to you in the real world instead of fake liars on the dating sites|`|6v7NGvDlaa	i met my hubby on line and we have been together 4 years|`|Sy8yEkWXaa	my uncle met my aunt online and they have been married for like 10 years, so yes it is possible. be careful though :)|`|abSNqG3Qaa	I think it is possible but hard to find.  Maybe you should add on your profile that your not looking to give money but are looking to be taken care of body mind and spirit.|`|g1yLWtiqaa	I think that there are alot of guys on those sites who are just looking for that.

I'm in a wedding this summer with my best friend from law school who met his fiance from eHarmony.<br>  I met my fiance on Craigslist (but I didn't get to know her online. We met in person after a short amount of e-mailing).<br>  <br>  Different services, I think, attract different people.  eHarmony is just about the best "long-term commitment" service that's out there.  But I think women have to go through a bunch of guys to find the right one or two. (Guys don't have this problem because they just get shut down by lots of women, or quickly realize that the woman is not for them.)|`|32cgr5Vraa	Me too I know a young married couple who met on line (Match.com) but they have only been married two years this year so who knows how long that relationship will last?<br>  <br>  As for myself, I met my current partner three years ago this year through eBay of all places and we`re still together to this day but that`s because we weren`t looking for a mate or a lover on that particular auction site, of course.<br>  <br>  But when we met, I was already married to someone else and living overseas (Western Europe) and my boyfriend was single but living on the East Coast of the USA,  therefore initially, the chances of us ever getting together were very remote, to say the least.<br>  <br>  But look at us now!<br>  <br>  I eventually got divorced and moved my whole life across the Atlantic just to be with someone I met on line!<br>  <br>  And I did all that BEFORE ever meeting him face to face, can you believe this???<br>  <br>  I hope you can because it`s the God honest truth!!!<br>  <br>  Who on earth ever said that crazy, passionate & insane love was dead?<br>  <br>  Just proves the fact that you can fall madly in love with someone you have never seen in the flesh, that`s all.<br>  <br>  Whether you initially met through the Internet or not.|`|4f55d2ff9515ab32bf18556229a3228eaa	Anything is possible.|`|E6UuilRSaa	Probably, never tried it, good luck

Appears she is coming to realise how she would have to sacrifice and give up her style of life if she continued a relationship with you and she is not willing to do this. Although I believe we all have opportunities to accomplish goals to be successful my concern is more not of what she is feeling, but for why you have not set positive goals for yourself? Appears you are avoiding this truth by just focusing on her financial status as being the only reason she is deciding against any promise of a future with you.  Even so, I do feel she is not the girl for you. You have to see if she is rejecting you because of your lack of goals and ambitions or is it just for money? If she is just focused on money as being successful, then my advice to you would be to let her go. You will only find heartache if you always feel you fail to measure up to her standards.

rEDNbg8zaa	Well, first off, I am not so sure most people believe sex is a sin...it may be in certain age demographics, but certainly not mine (35).  Most of my adult relationships, since the age of 23) have been open relationships.  I figured out that if my g/f or wife wants to sleep with another, all she has to do is let me know PRIOR to doing so.  If she sneaks, it is only to hurt me, not because of attraction, kinkiness, wants that I am not fulfilling properly, and the list can go on.  I like open relationships, because it promotes open, honst discussions.  In and of itself, honest discussion about sex are a turn on and lead to even better sex.  As for finding group sex activities in any area, just look up swingers club (in the city you live in), and all swingers clubs have a website.  I can tell you that many swingers clubs are less than any fantasy that might be dancing through you head, but there are a few good ones.  Some just feel like a meat market.  Dirty?  no, basic instinct?  no, combo, yes!|`|AA11412999	There's nothing dirty about sex.  It's just a bodily function.  It's what people do with it that makes it clean or dirty.  My husband and I have been able to swing and I do not feel "dirty" or ashamed of what we have done.  It feels like the most natural thing in the world for us.  If someone thinks that sex is dirty, then perhaps we should be examining why.  People were created with genitalea.  Which were designed to be used.  It feels good to have sex, and I can't imagine that that is bad.  It's the human mind that perverts what should be a completely innocent act.|`|0611e453682a610c09f35be950559e60aa	There is so much that can be said on this topic. wow!

If you like him and you want to go out with him why not go after him? Why wait for him? Just because he may be shy, don't mean you have to wait for him to make the first move. Me personally (and again this is just my opinion) I like it when the girl (woman, whoops again) makes the first move. It shows what kind of person she is. Nothing sexier than a woman that knows what she wants and isn't afraid to go after it. ( oh and just for my personal outlook is there anything sexier than a woman that will do that and has tatts, makes me shiver just thinking of it.)|`|98d9db4d2e5e9f2e1230126103949479aa	he likes u of course. why else would he flirt with u? sometimes guys r strange creatures. if u're brave enough... ask him out.|`|AA11292734	Until you take a firm decision to talk things over with this guy, you will continue in that confusing state.

E pode ser um jeito até desagradável ...<br>  <br>  + no seu caso, como você diz que sempre demonstra o seu amor pra ele, eu acho que você n?o deveria ser t?o presente assim .

Digo, no sentido de se mostrar uma mulher importante, ausente, que n?o vai estar sempre por perto paparicando ... esse é o segredo, querida!!! Você n?o pode ser a mulher companheira, amorosa e boazinha!! Experimente dar um duro com ele!!! Dá uns sumi?os, pare de dizer "eu te amo", você n?o pode nunca mostrar tanto apego a ele!!! Sen?o o cara vai relaxar, e acontecer oq acontece!!! Ele tem que estar sempre conquistando você ... toda mulher é especial e merece isso . Mas tem que ter a paciência, coisa que a maioria de nós n?o temos!!!

4550d1a6940c14994a272912d8cd6de4aa	This may help. God bless and I hope all works out. I know how tough a bad marriage can be and how scary money issues are.<br>  <br>  2) If I am not working right now, at the initial Order to Show Cause hearing, will I be required to find a job immediately?<br>  At the order to show cause hearing, the judge is not concerned about the employability of the wife. Instead, at this stage, the judge merely wants to preserve the status quo and provide the wife with sufficient income for her basic needs, consistent with the parties' life style.<br>  3) How does a judge determine spousal support at the time of the trial?<br>  At the trial of the dissolution, the California Family Code provides the judge with a long list of factors that are to be considered in determining the amount and duration of spousal support. This list includes such factors as the length of the marri age, the parties' prior living standard, the extent to which the supported spouse contributed to the attainment of an education or professional license by the other spouse, the presence of young children in the home, and the employment opportunities avail able to the spouse requesting support.<br>  4) How long will my spousal support last?<br>  In general, where the marriage has lasted more than 10 years, the court will, at the very least require a "reservation of jurisdiction." This means that, even if there is no current order for spousal support, the wife will be permitted to come back to court at a later date to request spousal support should the need arise. In marriages of less than ten years, spousal support will usually be paid for approximately one-half of the length of the marriage. <br>  5) Is the spousal support I am paying tax deductible? <br>  The Internal Revenue Code provides that all spousal support payments are tax deductible by the paying spouse and taxable to the recipient spouse as "ordinary income." For this reason, it is not uncommon for a negotiated settlement to include the paym ent of a high amount of spousal support, because such a p|`|w3sPTSB8aa	Hello that is great. relationship is to share in each others need and problems.You should be there for each other in hard and good times do things as one body, assist in each others need.<br>  thanks and goodluck|`|AA11899639	yes --it's called alimony|`|88817f7c9e0acc7d2bf2857f8d7a1402aa	I think it depends on the length of time of the marriage....and how much debt was incurred together. But regardless, the other will be held to a pay standard. The person making less can't work part time to get more support|`|b686051cb7a4e6695ee9032ddc4c463faa	I woudl definitely speak with an attorney.  I think it would depend on how long you have been married and if the spouse stopped working to raise a family, or always worked part-time even before you were together.  If your standard of living together is higher than what they had before you then they could possibly ask for alimony...to be able to keep up the life they have become accustomed to.  I have a cousin whose ex-wife pays HIM alimony for that reason...she made a lot more than him.

AA10864123	Relationships between a fat white women and a black guy are usually created when the black guy is disrespectful enough to find an easy, fat, low self esteemed white woman and take advantage of her.  Sometimes the man will have another woman elsewhere, but when he needs money or to drive a car other than his, that's when the fat white woman comes in handy.<br>  <br>  The white woman feels like she is liked because the guy will ask her for things, thus making her feel as if the guy "needs" her.

You'll know if he's a play if he wants to keep his gf but still go out with you, but if he's willing to break it off with his gf for you then he really likes you. If he flirts be kinda neutral and if he really likes you he may come out and say it!<br>  <br>  best of luck!!!<br>  just make sure you don't get in involved with him while he's with another girl b/c that's just gonna lead with a lot of broken heart!!<br>  <br>  hope it all works out!!!|`|661581279a0bb02982160cbdd9bec129aa	just stay best friends.

1eacd47cb685e776d991a7ddf1396d02aa	no you will not go to hell just because you dont go to church, if you believe in god and all that then you will go to heaven|`|08c39c3a2d25adaa754f11394fcf8f20aa	No. I think you have to start sinning before you can pray for forgiveness and if you're only 13-you still have a long way to go and a lot of maturing to do before you can truly sin, much less choose a god to pray to. Anyways- Salvation is not about church or prayer, it's about belief and spirituality. Define your PERSONAL beliefs aside from those you've learned and studied because they will be your true passage. You must live as a follower but not be forced to follow where ever the heard may roam. Make sense?|`|Gfr076UCaa	It's ok just believe in God and Jesus and your sins will be forgiven and you won't go to hell trust me!|`|c7db39975c64a358eab6a0044a8a7223aa	No....Chruch is not fun, that is understood.

AA11412999	No, in fact it doesn't hurt at all.  If it does, you shouldn't be doing it.  Period.  It's supposed to be fun.  The difference is that swingers look at sex in a completely different way.  And 'different' doesn't mean 'unhealthy'.  As long as it's not interfering with their relationship or with their mental, emotional, spiritual or psychological health, for some people being able to see sex as something completely separate from love - as a biological function that demands respect as a means of human communication - can actually be a very good thing. <br>  <br>  As RacerX said, I too enjoy the idea that my husband is a beautiful creature that I have no right to control or hinder.  It feels like putting an animal back into it's natural habitat.   Setting it free.  His feelings are my priority.  Not my own insecurities.  I love him, and for me, it's nothing but joy to know that I am able to give him this kind of freedom.  It defines me in a very, very good way.|`|77622be92ab404409f818db551a4987aaa	I don't have to deal with my partner having sex with someone else because I love when she has sex with someone else. Her having a great time makes me happy. I am part of that great time. As she says, I'm her safety net that enables her to be the wild, sexual woman she is.  I don't have to deal with it because it turns me on.  Just like the first time I saw her.<br>  <br>  I treasure her sexuality and I'd never ask her to reign it in for me, although she did for the first six years we were together. When we were secure enough in our relationship that we knew neither of us was ever going anywhere without the other, we were able to make all those fantasies we'd talked about a reality.<br>  <br>  I'm just not the jealous sort I guess.  I am not in the least bit insecure about myself, my wife, and our relationship.  My worth to my wife is never in question.<br>  <br>  Swinging is something we do as a couple for us as a couple. It benefits both of us in similar ways.  And we are more in love today then we were before we started swinging... and that was allot!  Swinging is simply an extension of our already great relationship and abuntant sex together.<br>  <br>  Do I wonder if she'll get emotionally attached to someone else?  Not over sex... No.  It's just sex.  We're not in love with each other and married to each other because of great sex.  It's everything else that makes a relationship, like companionship, trust, passion, loyalty, respect, being best friends.  It's knowing each other's deepest, darkest secrets and still loving each other without question.  It's all this and we have great sex together. And it's because all this that no matter how good the sex is with someone else, it will never be the same as sex with me?  Why?  Because sex between us is soul sex. It's not only physically satisfying, it's emotionally fulfilling.  Sex with others is just physically satisfying.<br>  <br>  Anyone who's ever had a one night stand with someone they absolutely lusted will know exactly what I am saying.  It's great sex at the time, but it's not the same as sex when you are in love.  One satisfies one thing about you at the time, the other satisfies everything about you.<br>  <br>  There are 3 billion other men in the world... Why did she decide to marry me?  Because I'm everything the other 2.99 billion men aren't to her.  And the same goes for her with me. Taking sex out of the equation as being THE reason we are together has clearly defined the reasons listed above as why we are married to each other and not other people.<br>  <br>  There is an incredibly liberating feeling within a relationship when you've opened the door for someone, like we have, and they don't walk through it.  There is complete trust between us. We are never, ever in suspicion of each other because there is no reason to lie to each other. If you can be honest about sexual desires with your spouse, imagine how easy it is to talk about money or problems with the kids?<br>  <br>  I hope that makes sense.  Sometimes trying to describe this is like trying to describe why you skydive to someone who's afraid of heights.  They can't understand. Because of their own fears they only see that you're jumping out of a perfectly good airplane.|`|69029dcd97abb485f7f3ec5e286e4334aa	sWINGER ARE LOGICLY WRONG AND IT IS OF COURSE HURT FULL IF YOUR PARTNER IS A SWINGER AND ID SAY TRY HELPING HIM TO GET OUT OF THAT PROBLEM.

Best thing to do is to contact your local domestic violence agency...ncadv...National Coalition Against Domestic Violence website can lead you in the right direction.  Many agencies have Legal Advocates and sometime Attorneys to walk you through the process.  I work for such as agency in Pennsylvania.  We are completely free and everything is confidential.  Good luck and be safe.|`|5296797039256ad1a40878eb64cddd9caa	There person who you are getting a restraining order on does not have to be in the courtroom.  Once you fill out the document and file it with the court they will serve a document with the court date on it noting the hearing for the restraining order before a judge a magistrate.  He will have a chance to respond and if he chooses he can defend himself once you go before the judge.  I had a similar situation, but my ex lived in a different state.  She did not show up in court but sent a fax documenting her side of the story.  The judge granted the restraining order.|`|MZHdWd4raa	I wouldn't think he would have to be in the courtroom at the same time, if that was the case I think many people would be unable to get restraining orders, for they probably wouldn't willingly show up at court to be restrained.<br>  <br>  As far as the evidence, I do not know, do a goole search on restraining orders and see if you can find out further details on how to proceed.

Well, I've had problems asking girls out too, and they find out quickly, so if you snooze you loose.

Could be pretty hard to get her interested since you already told her you love her.  Probably scared her off.  Sounds way to needy.|`|khBWNQOLaa	First of all if you haven't even went out, how do you know you love her. Secondly, it takes more than saying you love her "(and stuff)? whats that about. You want a hook up, check elsewhere because if you really did love her then you should be dating now and not looking in through the window.
5343fe85ba10587a9e8ec2b39bd14177aa	It was rape if you told him no or to stop.  He said he was sorry because he didn't want to get in trouble for what he did.  The fact that you said he insisted it wasn't rape should tell you what he is thinking.  Why would you want to get back with a man who is jealous and violent?  If you do, then you need to know that he isn't going to change so don't expect him to.  If that is the kind of man you want, then no one can tell you different, but I sure would not get back with him.  Go find the guy in the club and have some fun!|`|bf6b9798f78167159318613fe87464e1aa	it happened definitely but was it worth it?

5343fe85ba10587a9e8ec2b39bd14177aa	Just be his friend and don't worry about anything more.  If he dumps her, then you will be right there.  If he stays with her, then you probably wouldn't want to be with  guy that is that dumb...and you sure don't want her seconds...

AA12086491	Try to sit her down and tell her you misread her signals, you are sorry about that but what exactly does she want you to do to make this up to her.  If she can't come up with something, what exactly is the point in playing along with this girl, it doesn't seem like she's put a lot of thought into this fight.  I wouldn't put up with it, but then thats just me.|`|5343fe85ba10587a9e8ec2b39bd14177aa	I wouldn't do much more than you already have done.  After you get back, take her out and then talk about how would be the best way to make her happy and feel comfortable.
5343fe85ba10587a9e8ec2b39bd14177aa	Okay first off if your BF is 19 then what he is doing is illegal and it's called statutory rape.  It's illegal because they know that at 15 it is harder for you to make decisions or be in control of your life.  Your BF obviously is not making decisions that are in your best interest or he would have been responsible enough to use protection.  So, if he won't use it then you need to be the adult and tell him no - not without protection.  That being said, if you just had your period then the odds are in your favor that you aren't, but that is just the odds.  You should go buy a test just to make sure and make you feel better.  Now, the fact that you are hesitant on telling him makes me believe that your relationship isn't developed which means you should not have gone as far as you did with him.  It doesn't matter if he said he would stay with you because (1) he answered a hypothetical question and (2) at 15 you don't need to be caring for a baby anyway.  Last, I am sure you may think this guy is great but you probably should spend a little more time enjoying being 15 and stop hanging around older guys.  At 19, guys really only want one thing from girls and 15 year olds are easiser to get it from then 19 year olds...keep that in mind.

Nothing personal, just the way it is.|`|VL0FwgaOaa	You need to sit down and tell him how you feel.  Don't worry about the fact that he likes you so much.  In the long run, the longer you lead him on, the harder it will be for him.   I would suggest ending it now since your feelings are obviously strong.  Let him know that you think he's a great guy, but he just not the guy for you.  A lot of people also find that they can still be friends afterwards.  Hopefully this is the case for you guys! Good Luck!|`|ixyX7rUhaa	Well just say im sorry i just want to be friends! Honesty is the best policy. I know this will be hard to do but you cant keep torturing yourself like this. He will get over you sooner or later once you dump him.

Maybe only men and their buddies think that way, but it just isn't true.  I think if a guy wants to look at that, there is nothing wrong with it.  It's not all men though.  The men who don't are actually called gentlemen and are preferred by the ladies over the guys who do.

I can't see how it could be that tough.<br>  Try the local junior high or middle school. That's what the teachers do.
AA11412999	Married 12+ years, swinging successfully since 2003.<br>  <br>  First of all, you really should be asking this question in a place where people know what they're opining about.  Very few real swingers on here.  See the website below.  It's the best site on the web for lifestyle information and advice.<br>  <br>  Secondly, I would be wary of swingers who try to involve their neighbours in their activity.  Sometimes it works, but the rule of thumb is: if you can't walk away from the situation clean, don't even get involved.  If things go all Zebra Lounge on you, (and sex makes otherwise rational people sometimes act like their alter ego) are you willing to pack up and move to get away from your psycho-stalker neighbours?  Poorly-adjusted swinging couples (typically newbie couples whose enthusiasm overrides their common sense) can act like jilted crazy ex's when things don't go according to their well-laid plans.  Asking a neighbour to swing with them sounds like a newbie "red flag" to me.  It might not be, but I would avoid becoming sexually involved with them in any capacity.<br>  <br>  My suggestion would be to continue to talk with them, hang out with them, and if invited, accompany them to a club or something...but make it clear that because you live so close together (and your lives are so closely intertwined), you are not comfortable becoming sexually involved.  Thanks but no thanks.  But ask them about their experiences, find out how they started, what they enjoy most about it, what the worst parts are, etc.  This is just an aspect of their life...it isn't everything that they are.  Don't be afraid of the people just because of their unusual 'hobby'.  <br>  <br>  Please see the website below and ask the folks there the same question.  You'll get great advice.|`|28c9eb0b801c2374bd219860f12425b9aa	My sister got started this exact way!<br>  Now her marriage is over !<br>  She got a criminial record a class C felenoly for luade and indecent exposure in front of monier her son and he wont talk to her!!<br>  She lost her Job!<br>  Her Insurance carrion wound not cover her hospital bill because she was in a lifestyle that was not declared on insurance application !<br>  And her 13 year old son lives with wife and I ,and the past 2 months alone we paid out of our own pocket almost 4 grand for family counselor for her son who calls her to her  face a "DIRTY C U N T" in public no less!<br>  Don't go there leave the fantasy's at the door and stay away all together from your new friends!|`|77622be92ab404409f818db551a4987aaa	We have been swinging for several years and have had a great time doing it, so I speak from experience here.<br>  <br>  There is no harm in going to a party or club and just being voyeurs, lots of people do.  The swinging community is very open to others and their levels of experience and comfort and nobody is going to expect or pressure you to join-in.  Lots of people go to have a great, sexy time, then just go home with their own spouse for fun.<br>  <br>  For some more, really objective information check-out The Swingers Board forums at <a href="http://www.swingersboard.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.swingersboard.com</a> .|`|b4f6a75fc2a129d81b5b5f4ffb227fc5aa	We've been happily married for almost 37 years, and we, too, had a period where we "experimented" with our relationship.<br>  <br>  Your curiosity regarding your neighbors is perfectly normal.<br>  <br>  As far as "watching" them, that would be up to your neighbors, obviously.<br>  <br>  And you would be well advised to set up some preliminary "rules" before going over there to "watch," such as "no means no."  In other words, your neighbors might invite you to join in, and if you're not comfortable with it....you don't.<br>  <br>  There is another "variety" of swinging called "soft swing." That just means that two couples have sex with their own partner in the same room; the thrill being having sex in the company of another couple.<br>  <br>  But NO couple should even consider "experimentation" unless their relationship is rock-solid, and not prone to emotions like jealousy, self-doubt or performance anxiety. Experimenting with another couple will NOT "fix" a problem in your relationship.<br>  <br>  That's my best advice to you. Email me if you have any other questions.|`|dc83398c61491eab0e1cb106338c2330aa	My neighbors are also swingers/bikers. They where on a quest to get my wife and I to at least observe at one of their parties. They are not the best looking couple and we have always declined. Their just not our kind of people or their friends for that matter. I have seen her without any clothes on and she looks 100% better with her clothes on. We're not prudes either, but they completly turned us off. Maybe at least you'll have a few laughs.|`|AA10008833	We go to the clubs and mostly watch or be watched. The only word of caution I would give is that the next door neighbors would be a little too close to home for us|`|jvW3a5GYaa	My best friend and her ex-husband were swingers - it's definitely not the lifestyle for everyone. If you have any reservations AT ALL - don't do it!!! My friend thought it was fine in the moment but has regretted it ever since.
o5NWwHlkaa	Yup, it's called ALCOHOL and VALIUM! Best results when taken together in excessive amounts!|`|2dfdfcdb4d65c895a40f81c0cb21ef17aa	It's called getting by with a little help from your friends.  Call them. Hang out with them.  Forget the self-medicating stuff...that can make things even worse.|`|aff24c8c1e29ed8627848e8cde47c4b4aa	Chocolate|`|0f9bd97c3bb02de9c849a8a4327ffa1eaa	Don't do anything foolish,and please remember time heals all wounds.|`|OeYY0kvbaa	The greatest medicine to cure you is to find another who is also heartbroken. You two can completely understand where the other is coming from.|`|TH7f1AxQaa	I hate to say it dude, but to hook up with somebody else as quickly as possible helps. It's just a temporary fix, but it's actually like putting duct tape on your arm and ripping it off. At first it just keeps on hurting and hurting, but after a while, it's no big deal.|`|dd30f9f07591c4e2aafcf46d6ff22818aa	The only medicine that I can think of is Time, and JESUS!!|`|7302f131a1ff084c70173918d9df4c85aa	no, only time will heal it.|`|94ee69b3959b70b2580259ceb732b7bbaa	Yes and the Dr's are Ben & Jerry.

Everything can work out smoothly from here.<br>  <br>  Or she doesn't want to cross that friend barrier, and pursuing more will actually hurt your friendship. Only you can know how things stand right now.<br>  <br>  A good idea is to set up a play date. Maybe say, "Hey, you know what would be fun? Do you want to go grab some grub on Friday night, maybe go see a movie?" Don't treat it like a date.<br>  <br>  You can bring a bigger group along but sometimes that hurts your chances. It depends on your friends. Maybe they might say something to add pressure on the situation. Or they might help keep things comfortable.<br>  <br>  Pay attention to her mannerisms, how she acts towards you. THEN make your decision. Just know, that once you cross this line, there is NO going back. Your relationship can/will be forever changed.|`|AA10241742	Well if she is a friend just be like hey, wanna go get a bite to eat?  Or you could say lets go see that new movie.

37a2e8246d995fece8e76b779a3a2952aa	Mira se me hace muy egoísta de parte de tu hermano que quiera que tu mama este solo yo le preguntaría reaccionaria así, si hubiere sido tu mama la que hubiera muerto?. No es fácil, aceptar que alguien mas entre en la vida de uno de tus padres, es un conflicto de lealtades tremendo, primero no quieres que nadie usurpe el lugar de tu papa, pero quieres que tu mama sea feliz, así que te sientes miserable por no entender la situación, pero cuando vez que tu mama hace cosas con esta persona que no hacia con tu papa se te retuercen los sentimiento mas malos que uno puede tener(celos, egoísmo etc, etc) y la razón por que a tu hermano le pega mas es porque se siente con derecho dado que ha vivido mas tiempo con tu mama. Ahora tienes que hablar con tu hermano tranquilos sin enojarse empieza hablando de tu papa, las cosas buenas que hacia y las malas también (nadie es perfecto ni siquiera los muertos por mucho que nos duela) y ahí la hablas de la oportunidad que tiene tu mama de rehacer su vida con ese se?or o con algún otro esa es decisión de tu mama, no de tu hermano. El ya decidió con quien compartir su vida y estoy segura que no le pidió consejo a tu mama,  o a el  le gustaría que tu mama le corriera a la marinovia que tiene? no verdad si alguien la va a correr va a ser el de igual manera si tu mama decide rehacer su vida o no va a ser decisión de ella.

37a2e8246d995fece8e76b779a3a2952aa	Bueno para empezar nadie tiene la cura mágica para eso, veras si ella esta con otro es porque así lo decidió, así lo desea y esta usando a su hijo como pretexto, contigo también tiene un ni?o o no?, ya es hora de que sierres ese capitulo en tu vida, esa mujer no es para ti porque ella así lo decidió, no entiendo como pudo tener un hijo tuyo recién nacido, y vivir con el papa del otro ni?o, quiere decir le puso el cuerno al otro contigo, o a ti te lo puso con el, como quiera que sea en un embrollo. AHHH y no es cierto que un clavo saca a otro clavo, lo que has de hacer es primero terminar tu relación con ella, ojo con ella no con tu hijo, aprender a vivir solo, a quererte, respetarte, amarte, consentirte, a vivir contigo mismo. Una vez hecho esto ya puedes empezar a vivir con alguien mas, pero ten cuidado acuerda te quien de verdad te ama no te hará sufrir.|`|OifYplhcaa	Vas a pasar toda tu vida lamentándote por lo que sentís? yo creo que uno tiene que luchar por lo que ama , de lo contrario debemos resignarnos a ser infelices toda nuestra vida.

Ic9oWmg8aa	You can love in high school to the greatest capacity of which you are able. However, most people of that age are not developed enough emotionally to really KNOW what they want or need in a partner.<br>  <br>  I'm not putting you down or disputing your feelings.

AA11412999	Have tried it and loved it.    It's of utmost importance that you 1) do your homework, 2) maintain 100% open, clear and constant communication with your spouse and 3) ALWAYS respect the boundaries and comfort levels of others (your spouse AND your swing partners).  <br>  <br>  Here's an amazing website with terrific discussions about swinging.  The information here is reliable and the people offer great support for those just starting out.|`|AA10008833	We've been involved for many years and its been great for us. If you two want to get involved, do a little research first.Then the two of you need to have an honest talk about what you want and what the boundaries are going to be. For instance my wife and I will play with another couple but never have intercourse. We feel that that is something only for us. The most important thing is to set your boundaries and NEVER overstep them.|`|705bb9794e7f7982745b157f9432c000aa	i dont have a partner.|`|AA10681946	I would try it but my hubby is against it.
AA11106362	I will give you a bit of an answer. I am married to someone that eventually will be a citizen through me. <br>  <br>  Marrying a US citizen can give you citizenship eventually. The following things must apply:<br>  <br>  The immigrant must remain married for 5 years. <br>  The immigrant must have a notation on his visa that states that he does not need to leave the US and reenter after two years following expiration of visa.<br>  He must apply for a conversion to citizenship through a lawyer and requires extensive paper work.<br>  <br>  You do not become a citizen automatically. You can not have a criminal history in any country. You must not violate any laws while in the process of citizenship. You can not leave your spouse or the temporary visa will expire.<br>  <br>  You can get a temporary visa (similar to citizenship) that last for a year once married and filed. But there is no magic way to become legal by marrying someone. <br>  <br>  If your friend is being used, look for inappropriate behavior from the person marrying them. She or he has a lot of power over the future of that person. It should be a concern for them but if love is there, the love should stand out more than the pursuit of citizenship.<br>  <br>  Lots of people are used but you have up to two years to find out. And if that person is using your friend, the relationship will sour quickly. Remind your friend of what love is about.<br>  <br>  I am going through this process. My husband is barely motivated to fill out the paperwork....but he loves me dearly. Love is a great thing...but the government will figure it out if your friend doesn't.|`|l0lopeSeaa	Dear Friend,<br>  Sad but true, many people marry Americans just to become citizens. My boyfriends mom did just that. She was a Russian Native and married an American. However Federal law states that "you must be married for 2 years" before you can become a citizen. Also all other dependents like children will  also become citizens after the two years.<br>  Alot of those marriages end up in divorce after the 2 years is over. If I were you I would tell your friend to have pre-nuptial agreement, in order of not getting riped off if the marriage does end in divorce...Good Luck|`|tG6Lju7Raa	That happens all the time especially Asian women, they love you no **** until they get to be an American citizen and then leave you high and dry and take you for whatever they can get.|`|uskRcQtTaa	When a U.S citizen marries a person from another country the marriage would help the person from another country become a citizen. That's all I can really tell you on that subject. Also if you believe your friend is being used by his or her partner you should let your friend know.

While others are sharing just there interests.  and further still, others just feel that a relationship is more of a friendship, with benifits. <br>  <br>  It sounds like he is very interested in something else (good chance its himself), and a relationship is not something he feels needs a lot of attention.    <br>  If you choose to break up with him you will see a drastic change but realize that its only because you have messed with his little world.

I'm not a man, but I see it day in, day out.  It's called love.  When someone, not only a man, but a woman too, falls in love, they are BLINDED to an extent and this helps to allude them to certain faults in their beloved.  Nobody is perfect and if it weren't for this 'blindness'  then in reality, we wouldn't be able to fall in love in the first place!  We would just continue to see a person for their faults and not become enamoured with them.  I have seen the loveliest guys with the most domineering women and they are crazy about them.

Guys don't want to deal with that kind of hassle.  It doesn't matter how you feel about him because you already built that relationship.  You are the "hook-up" girl.  He's all you think about because you can't have him.  If you really really wanted him, you would have changed the hook-up relationship into something else way before now.  It's a bit too late for that.
5343fe85ba10587a9e8ec2b39bd14177aa	I understand your confusion but the reality is that this boy is not that in to you.  It sounds like he broke up with you to be with this other girl and he made up the excuse about going to college because he didn't want to tell you the truth.  He probably knew how you felt about him and didn't want to hurt your feelings.  I doubt that telling him how you feel will get him back.  Besides, I am sure you did that already when he was breaking up with you.  It may be hard, but I would try to get over him.

Ent?o elas automaticamente ficam mais legais pois querem aproveitar ao máximo tudo pois n?o tem nenhum compromisso com nada nem com ninguém. Agora vai conviver dia-a-dia com qualquer pessoa e vc verá quem é legal de verdade. é com o tempo que se conhece de verdade alguém.

Ou?a aquela música do Gilberto Gil:" Eu preciso aprender a só ser."..conhece?Ame-se primeiro, respeite-se, lute por sua vida, mesmo que tenha que colocar seu ex na justi?a para dar pens?o para sua filha, mas batalhe para viver,liberte-se um pouco da dependência da figura masculina.

8HYCUBzxaa	Sounds like she tries to put you down and build herself up all the time.  If it were me, I'd get tired of being treated like that.

A true friend only wants happiness for her friend...she doesn't go out of her way to destroy potential happiness.  She needs help.  Where is this going to stop?  Is she going to screw up your chances for a job or something.  Get this negative person out of your life.
5343fe85ba10587a9e8ec2b39bd14177aa	Sounds like you have internal issues that you need to deal with.  It could be something like you may feel he is somehow above you in status or that he is more outgoing or just that he brings out insecurities that you thought you never had but are realizing you do.  It is more of a self-discovery thing.  You are getting older and things that may have seemed easy or made you secure may not be just the opposite.  I would be concerned about being with someone that is bringing out negative qualities in myself.  You may need to re-examine if the relationship is healthy - for you.
9B4lKmDpaa	My parents did not speak to each other - would not even be in the same room for 30 years.  They had 4 children together but that was not enough to make them be civil to each other.  I remember one time, when I was about 13, my father came for his visitation and my mother had him arrested for not paying child support.  At weddings, they sat at opposite ends of the pew and didn't speak.  We always had 2 birthday parties for my children so that they wouldn't have to see each other; had to schedule who came to baseball games; etc.   If they saw each other in Wal-Mart, they would turn around and go the other direction.  It was ridiculous. In the last few years, it has gotten better.  At least now they will speak to each other.|`|fEvtIwfbaa	My dad died.If he hadn't they would still be married. Be glad they just got divorced & are still alive.|`|5343fe85ba10587a9e8ec2b39bd14177aa	My parents get along fine.  They have never played the games that you always hear about.  They just could not stand to live with each other.  Sometimes, when that's the case, then they really aren't doing the kids any favors by staying together.  I truly believe I have a better relationship with both of them because of it.  Had they stayed, they would be miserable and I would be in therapy.
5343fe85ba10587a9e8ec2b39bd14177aa	First off, you need to go with your instinct.  More times than not, when this situation happens it's because the person that is making the accusations is really the one cheating.  I doubt having a conversation will change things.  Either he is going to trust you or he's not.  If he says he trusts you but then starts making accusations, then that just makes him a liar and that means you can't trust what he says.  If it continues... dump him.  You will be better off.|`|AA12095283	Would dump him if he does'nt stop his jealous tantrums.Beware this type will soon be critical of your clothes.By blaming you for attracting these guys,because of your improper dress

NOESSH5Aaa	I spent 9 years with my piece of **** ex.  She just out of the blue decided it would be better to spend all the time in the world with someone else and then tell me about it months later.

Just please be happy that you aren't losing any more of your life with scum.|`|ee990e37c19d643fe6667035763897d1aa	im sorry to say but it could be many reasons that he broke up<br>  with you. if you have tried to find out and he still has not<br>  given a reason then there nothing you can do but move on<br>  it does hurt to know that someone that you love did this<br>  and  also it about closure , which he did not give you. but<br>  sometime you just need to make the choice to do what<br>  is right for you and close the door behind and move forward<br>  good luck.|`|bf621e05dd1c4f89ff36b9fdce162254aa	Just move on with your life.  While I agree we would all like to know the reasons for a break-up, in the final analysis whether we know or not really doesn't make a scrap of difference.<br>  <br>  If the other person doesn't want to be with us, then we are better off without them, and that is the bottom line.<br>  <br>  It may well be that he really just does not know within himself.  I don't know how old you two are, but age and development could be part of it.  He may just not be ready to be in a steady relationship.  If he does know, he may not want to tell you because telling you may expose him to feelings of guilt (depending on the reason) and men/boys just HATE feeling guilty and will avoid it at all costs!<br>  <br>  I know it is hard when you really feel for someone and that feeling is not returned, however a one-sided relationship will never work long term.<br>  <br>  Concentrate on getting out and about with other friends, doing things to take your mind off it.  It will come and go in waves, you will have times when it is hard for you, and then you will be OK for a while.  <br>  <br>  Leave him be - if you nag him about the whole thing, it will just make it worse.

If it feels dirty, depraved or negative at all, don't do it.  You'll only hurt yourself and then your partner.  It's just sex and it's not worth ruining a relationship over, right?<br>  <br>  However, if my SO wanted one (and he does) and I was equally enthusiastic about the idea (I am), then we would do it...cautiously and carefully.  Just be sure you are very picky about who you choose to allow into your bedroom, because it can't be undone.  Also, be sure that you have both discussed it from every angle conceivable, addressing all the scariest what-ifs.  Such as, what if one of you develops feelings for the other person?  And no cop outs!  You can't just say, "Oh honey, that would NEVER happen!"  The game is WHAT IF it did?  Make a list of your biggest concerns.  STDs, pregnancy, emotions, abandonnment/being left out, who's prettier/skinnier/buffer/better endowed than whom, breaking the rules and sneaking around (cheating), physical safety (sex can make people act very strangely, and so personal safety IS an issue), alcohol, smoking and drugs, comfort zones (sex acts or other acts that are or not permissable, such as kissing, eye contact, holding hands, etc)...There are a thousand things to talk about and don't start until  you see eye to eye.<br>  <br>  Then again, this may have just been a hypothetical question.. lol<br>  <br>  Bottom line: NEVER take one for the team.

oAfbZBMjaa	You have to consider whether your friend or the guy is more important to you. If you value your friendship with her, it's better if you could just treat the boy as a friend. Afterall, there are still plenty of fish in the sea, if you know what I mean.<br>  <br>  It's not worth to break the friendship (just in case your friend doesn't approve you being with him) over a guy. Agree?<br>  <br>  However, if your friend is understanding, you may want to ask how she feels if the boy likes you.|`|AA12296264	The real question should be; what do you value more, your friendship or your love life?  But there is one possibility for success in both areas.  Ask your friend if s/he is okay with you going out with him, and go from his/her reply.  That's basically all I can provide you with.  If your friend appears hurt by the mere mention of this, drop it, and laugh as if you were joking, then change the subject subtly.  If s/he holds your friendship in higher priority, then go for him, but don't forget your friend at any cost.

5343fe85ba10587a9e8ec2b39bd14177aa	you need to grow up and realize that he was drunk and would have said anything to control your feelings and thoughts.  Down the road he will still be drunk and trying to tell you things you want to hear one minute and mean to you the next.  That is not any way to live your life and you certainly don't want to grow old only to have spent your entire life around a man who belittles you.  Life is too short.
5343fe85ba10587a9e8ec2b39bd14177aa	Sounds like he used you and doesn't know how to handle the guilt so he takes it out on you.  Walk...no run away from this "kid" and try to use this lesson to not give it up unless you have been dating awhile and in a serious committed relationship.
jXm1Ppicaa	Don't worry, going without someone it won't be weird to your teacher. And don't be shy to your favorite teacher just talk to her and tell how everything is doing in your life and in hers. <br>  <br>  Tip: Buy her a box of chocolate or make a gift basket it will cheer her up when you come.|`|28e0c0f430bed21c8a227b061b9514a1aa	sure can help. i had one person go with me once and once by myself. i had a teacher had the most respect for and i was her pet. i loved her to death. well anyhow every now and then i would write to her about stuff and she would answer also. well she died in 94 and of coarse i didnt' know she passed away and it was her grandkid that told me. i guess all the rest of her family is gone. yes go and talk to the person. let them know you really care about them and like to come and see her from time to time. its would be refreshing for her to know this and i know they do appreciate it. i had a girlfriend that was related to the teacher also. so little town. its great just do it you will find things to talk about.|`|AA11119626	If I follow you here, you've decided to visit a former teacher.Usually you go with someone, but this time, you'll be alone - is that right?<br>  <br>  Okay, as a shy person, I can relate. You worry about making conversation, not feeling awkward...  the good news is, you really don't have much to worry about. See, your teacher knows you're shy, and won't be expecting you to blow in as the life of the party. It's enough that you're you, that you appreciate what this person did for you.<br>  <br>  "Hi - I'm so glad to see you. You're wuch a great teacher. I really look up to you. How are you? What's going on in your life?"<br>  <br>  Then you let her talk. You listen - really listen. Ask questions. Listen some more. If she's still teaching, ask about her classes now - anyone promising? Anyone she really has hopes for? If not, you ask about her family, her life.<br>  <br>  It doesn't have to be witty conversation. You're just showing that you appreciate her, respect her, that you care. All of that is a lot and she'll appreciate it. You don't have to perform for her entertainment. It's enough to be you.|`|eZtdK8wMaa	Hehe, I'm shy too and if I did visit an old teacher without a friend..just ask her casual stuff..like how she's doing and if she asks you then tell her the exciting things that's been going on|`|fisHNMu4aa	Not, it's not weird at all. In fact it would be a nice gesture to your teacher to visit her, that just proves that you still remember her even when you have no body else to go with.|`|iaaQjjFVaa	I actually think it's better to go alone if you are visiting an old friend, or an old teacher or an old anything.  Because your friend doesn't have any connection with your teacher and likely will be sitting there looking bored.  If you're shy, try this:  Find her a little gift.  Nothing special, just thoughtful.  Maybe a book.  Stop by and tell her you can just stay a couple of minutes but you wanted her to have it as a thank-you for all she did for you.  Then, if the conversation doesn't start rolling, you can go.  If it does, stay awhile.  I'm shy, too, and I find if I put parameters around what I have to do, I can handle it much better.  Good luck.  And do visit your teacher.  I'm sure she would love it.|`|ni9lZ9bCaa	Visit. you will find things to talk about. If you can't think of anything, ask her about her life, what's going on and such. share stories and things like that. She will love that you cared enough to visit her.|`|1wG3U9Veaa	Since you brought someone with you every time you visited your old teacher she thought that you were just stopping by to see how she was doing and to let her know how well you're doing. The problem that you may have now is that, when you show up alone she's going to feel like you have something serious or intimate to talk about. To let her know that it's nothing like that you open the conversation by saying " My friend was really impressed with you the last time she was here and I told her about how much I looked up to you" and your teacher will then most likely follow up with "How is she doing" or "I see she didn't make it this time" and then you can easily answer that by saying she had other plans and continue on like you normally would.|`|7mIXWzGTaa	When I was younger I use to go visit teachers I like.<br>  Usually I was alone.  I was also shy.<br>  But conversation always came.<br>  It's not like they have a lot of time to visit anyway.|`|AKggcycUaa	Trust me!  Your teacher will love the visit!<br>  <br>  You're showing her that her teaching meant more to you than just a year's worth of tests and assignments.  and that you think of her as a real person.<br>  <br>  Teachers can go on something like that for MONTHS.  Theirs is generally a very thankless job.<br>  <br>  Good for you for keeping track of this favorite teacher!<br>  <br>  I'm shy too - I suggest keeping the visit breif.  That way you won't have any awkward silences.  Unless, of course, you both get to chatting and you're both obviously having a good time.  Otherwise, I'd say about 15 minutes is long enough to be respectable, but short enough to avoid the dangers of 'wearing out your welcome' or running out of things to say.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|Himm8Hrcaa	No its not weird at all!!<br>  infact i've went by myself to a FOURTH GRADE TEACHER!<br>  -- it was fun being by myself and i got to help her out a little with the pleasure of knowing she knows i look up to her :D<br>  <br>  and im quite shy also but threw an awesome conversation b/c my teacher knew exactly what to say since she knew that a student would remember her :)<br>  <br>  (.. THERE'S THE ICECREAM MAN.. GOTTA GO!!..)|`|oDS61DOAaa	...wth just go visit her and talk to the woman!|`|sIiDSNQ3aa	are you sure there's jobody that can come with you??? ask anybody...there's gotta be somebody!!! if not here's my otha advice:<br>  <br>  try to boost your confidence and practice not being so shy. If they were your teacher, you should probably show them how well they taught you and how confident they made you...that will make him/her happy! my teacher loves when she can see someone understanding what she's teaching and when she witnesses her teaching paying off! maybe try to take a risk and count how many times you feel uncomfortable or you look at the floor deadly...the least, the better...take the risk and be confident!!!! -hope i could help!
5343fe85ba10587a9e8ec2b39bd14177aa	Well, it sounds like the relationship is heading in the wrong direction.  You might want to find out from your boyfriend if he thinks he is going to remain faithful and give you a continued reason to trust him or if he wants to be free to flirt or see other girls because you wouldn't want him disrespecting you.  Somewhere down the line regardless of what he says about this, you are going to have to make your own choice on whether to accept his relationship with this girl or not.
v0A3hvyiaa	I'd tell her how you feel, but casually. Personally I'd be flattered if one of my friends said he had feelings for me. Find out from your conversation how she feels. If the isn't interesting in being more than friends than let it go. But you may find that she feels the same about you is is also to frightened to tell you.  If she is a really great friend, she'll understand and probably be glad that you were honest with her|`|AyVzx4yKaa	I'm in the exact same situation... So I'm watching. Good Luck!|`|IoJUAtaFaa	have someone else tell her you like her and have them tell how she responded dont have them sya "he told me to tell you..." just like a casual thing if she wants it then just tell her and you'll be fine...if not, just keep it bottled up agian|`|d0t4VGJHaa	i think the best way to tell her is just be straight up and honest about it but if she says she doesnt like you in that way be cool with that 1 of my friends told me she liked me and i had to tell her id rather just be friends with her and weve been basically best friends since dont push the issue|`|WTik1e58aa	Ask her to do something with you. It doesn't have to be a date or anything, just so long as you and she will both be there and you can talk and spend time with her. Pay attention to how she acts around you, especially when and if you're alone with her. If she seems receptive to you, then drop hints. If she's receptive to the hints, drop bigger ones, or, if it's your style, just tell her.|`|oyD3uRoYaa	tell her.<br>  if you guys are such good friends, i'm sure she'd rather find out from you now.|`|8tRY1U2Iaa	If she's friends with you, and it sounds like you two have been friends for a long time, then she'll understand how you feel. Just ask her if she wants to be in a relationship (don't say "with me") at this time, and if she does, ask her if she wants to be in one with you. If she says "no", then just don't bring it up again.|`|3d29b3c5add26506676d0872c7b6f4b3aa	it all depends on whether or not you think she likes you!
AA11412999	Sorry, but I can't read morse code.  I'm not sure what you're after.  Are you in immediate danger?  Are you texting this by flashlight locked in the trunk of a car?  Are you just looking for ideas on finding a date or a husband?  <br>  <br>  You'll need to give us more to go on than this.  I'd suggest getting yourself a Yahoo 360 account (<a href="http://360.yahoo.com)" rel="nofollow">http://360.yahoo.com)</a> and post your entire story on there.  There's no character limit, and you can get unlimited feedback from people.  You can put a link to your 360 page in your Yahoo Answers profile as well.  Another idea is something like Facebook.com if you're okay with putting your real self out there.<br>  <br>  Good luck!
2Z95ylAhaa	Well, while this is just my opinion, he might be hurting inside, too.  As you mentioned, he's admitted that he's liked you before so maybe he has real feelings for you and fears you don't reciprocate.  <br>  <br>  I would talk to him, but give him a bit of space first.  Wait about a day or two, until things have cooled down a bit and both of your emotions have settled and then talk with him.  Maybe it was a misunderstanding or maybe there are issues you need to work through together.|`|EJYp5fIcaa	the exact same thing happened to me at the beginning of the year. me and this guy were best friends for over a year and i knew he liked me more than a friend but i never wanted to take it further. we talked normally an then the next day i got an email from him saying he hated me and i had ruin his life! its hurt! i was then told he did that coz he wanted me out of his life coz he liked me too much and it was killing him being as close as we were but being just friends. maybe this guy feels the same. give him time and hopefully he will come round. he might just need time to get over you, if he does like like you. if you cant wait around go and speak to him about how you feel<br>  sadly me and that guy still dont speak and it happened to  me in january but i hope it works out for you! good luck|`|AA10409800	Guys generally are not just wanting to be 'friends' for the most part, unless they're gay.  No, this isn't always the case, but I'm assuming you're pretty young and in that age group it's almost always the case.  He likes you in 'that way' and, since you don't feel the same way, he's mad.  It's completely unfair for guys to do this; it's almost as if they don't think you have any choice in the matter.  <br>  <br>  What he needs to realize is that he can lose a good friend by being so petty and selfish.  Just know that you have every right to be upset and, more importantly, angry.  I think you should confront him and, in a nutshell, tell him off.  If it's too much for him, then wipe your hands of the whole relationship.  At least you know that you did what you could, and that it was HIS choice to end the friendship.
cb8GlXHyaa	just try new things and catch him off guard ..he will be totally WOW'd and love that you have confidence to just take the lead! my husband and i never kiss the same each time ..we always are trying to new things ..sometimes it's nice just to have a little kiss and just cuddle and rubb each others arms while watching a movie ..you don't ALWAYS have to kiss otherwise it would get bored for sure!!|`|T1U4SzLtaa	Perhaps the feeling isn't there to go with the kissing. You need to think about that.|`|wGdKrmrRaa	It just sounds like making out isn't your "forte". Try some other things. =)|`|QcqHHyGJaa	Why don't you show him what YOU like also?  Try using different techniques and tongue action.  You just need some practice before you figure out what you like and don't like.  Kissing can be very fun if you switch it up a bit between the two of you!|`|33z4szB3aa	I learnt with time....but that was with DIFFERENT guys.<br>  I think u need to vary what u do.he knows ONE way he likes to be kissed, but thats boring n tedious to ONLY stick to that.<br>  Trying kissing him the way YOU like kissing him.<br>  try softly biting, sucking, licking, as well as the normal kissing.<br>  switch between things. Dont forget ur body as well. This adds interest. Think about ur hands, stroke his face, hug him etc.<br>  Try kissing his neck and ears n stuff.|`|My665Jgwaa	talk to him and suggest to try something new.<br>  its always good having something to spruce up your relationship.|`|Sl4mgvfYaa	nibble/suck on his bottom lip, NOT HARD, just gently, then pull away. and then kiss him how he likes to be kissed. <br>  <br>  he'll love it|`|ZOiRGGkIaa	I think that u should talk to him about it cuz hes ur boyfriend and u should be able to talk to him about anything to him.<br>   <br>  and u should try kissing him upside down or suck one of his lips or his tongue lol!|`|haIkbzK5aa	You could make it more interesting by touching ur bfs neck gently, I like to bite my gfs lip and kiss her neck as well. that should help make it more fun!|`|7zH39atZaa	sorry no idea<br>  but u can tell ur probelm to him & solve it talking each other|`|l6QA0Y6Qaa	While kissing your partner, gently bite down on the lower lip (women love it ) and then start sucking on the bottom lip to give them a great sensation.<br>  <br>  Yummy!!! The lips or the chocolate?<br>  It may turn up too messy, but its worth the try. Take a bite of any chocolate that melts easily and French kiss as you would. It is extremely pleasurable. Say yummy the lips or the chocolate.<br>  <br>  Lap Kiss<br>  Ask your partner to lie with his/ her head on your lap, lean over and kiss them in rhythmic beats Your bottom lip will be on your partner's top lip, and vise versa. You can even French kiss while in this position. It can act like a foreplay for the rest of the spice up session.<br>  <br>  All over Kiss<br>  It begins with a gentle kiss on your partner's forehead. Move down slowly to the eyelids by gently forcing them to shut to dream an exotic experience. Feel the warmth of the breath and move down slowly to the nose. Give your best kiss right on to the lips exploring gently the treasures of the mouth. Make sure not to dig in hard. Make your partner anticipate for more.

DcrI9zmkaa	Who says he lied?  He was most likely just mistaken as to what night the comedy show was.  Chill out, Girl!|`|alv31wBlaa	maybe he messed up on the date OR! maybe he was kinda upset that he couldnt go with you so he lied.|`|NEEGoiC2aa	maybe he went with another girl didnt want upset u or  maybe he did get his date wrong  but ask around ur mate who did go  and say 2 them so who with this person then ??|`|Ubpd1h9Caa	Honey, no one understands men. Talk to him, tell him you thought he said something else and see if he says anything about it.. But at any rate, if he's lying to you then you don't need him!

yyXy9ZKraa	every girl likes a different type of guy,  there's absolutely no problem with being quiet or shy normally there the nicest =]  if you like a girl and she seems to like you go for it , don't change who you are for a girl<br>  xxx|`|PzgEX7GQaa	Sadly, its a common thing that girls don't, its not neccassarily because the guy is shy, but because girls are naturally attracted to guys with a confident attitude, now this doesn't mean a shy guy can't get a girl, it just means he's gonna have to be able to work up enough nerve to go forward and find someone, confidence is one reason, but its also kinda hard to find a girl if the guy is too shy to go after one. However, once a guy has the girl, it becomes alot easier, because the girl can get to know the real you, and if you have a good enough personality, shy or not, they'll probably end up liking you.|`|UtQxrdOaaa	No.  Girls HATE shy, quiet guys.  It makes them feel like they're talking to their dog.<br>  <br>  A man has confidence.  A man speaks what's on his mind and says whatever the hell he wants whenever he wants.<br>  <br>  Stop being a dog.  And be a man.|`|c7e30071e7abdcbe463f55ac4e891aa8aa	well you cant ask a girl out if you never talk to her so try to come out of your shell a bit but its ok to be shy some girls think its cute!|`|WkA8UPflaa	Yes I do. I wish he would ask me out but he is way to shy, and I am not that into asking the guy out so I am still waiting... But an answer to your question, I usually find that shy guys are actually deeper.|`|607b74dffc19f552539bc4b01d158d07aa	i think girls like guys who are social and out there <br>  but not snobby or stuck up

aO37q4U8aa	If you had sex whether it's a friend or not, means you're<br>  not a virgin anymore.<br>  well it all boils down to the self-respect you have for<br>  one's self. If you treasure yourself and have self-worth within<br>  you,  you wouldn't go around having sex with just anybody.<br>  You'd wait until you're married and abstain from having sex<br>  until the right person comes along.<br>  It'll be so much special and fulfilling.|`|AA10373401	you must have no clue about life.|`|OisK0HlLaa	If you have sex with anyone then it's fair to say you're not a virgin. (?) Also, who is to say that you can't love your friend but you must love someone you lust after? Doesn't make sense to me although I would be more worried about damaging a good friendship.|`|sB98dhi9aa	Keep up that spirit. Preserve yourself for the person you love.<br>  Its very good you are thinking like this wish you all the best.
WkA8UPflaa	Your cute, beautiful eyes. There is a good chance he likes you, and people that say anything about you do it because they have no self confidence. Like popular girls try to put down really gorgeous girls so they dont feel confident. its just a game people play. Be confident no matter what people say, they can be ruthless in high school|`|zkYV1pbhaa	I think you're over exaggerating.<br>  <br>  He see's you as a friend, sweetie.<br>  Nothing More Nothing Less.<br>  <br>  <br>  And you're pretty.<br>  Don't use make-up.<br>  Most guys like a natural look.
esPAtvZKaa	lol hun I was in the exact oppisite postion as you a few months ago, my bf wanted to get married and I didnt it took 4 failed marriage proposals and lots of serious disscussion before we said I DO,  so I have absouletly no answer to your question maybe I will ask my husband and then get back to you!|`|ei29RlZTaa	i think that would fall under "keeping up with the Jonses".....marriage is just the "right" thing to do in America, and most places. i got married because i found a guy who's bad habits were not that bad, and he was funny, hot and intelligent and sweet. plus i got knocked up......but anyway, i married him so that he's "claimed". he's mine. and i enjoy getting more back on my tax returns and the slightly lower car insurance......|`|UIgnIjFRaa	You should get married because its your day and you get to feel pretty and special with friends and family to witness!!! oh yeah and then you get a certificate and the same last name as your lover :) Hes your personal slave....=D|`|4HoVVCenaa	Security, and social norms.|`|gYWDrHVFaa	Because you were brought up to believe in fairy tales with happy endings.  Marriage isn't like that.|`|f547b0547924b21590b8ffb102004fdeaa	Women want men that are going to stick around and help provide for the children. (biologically, that is, even if you don't want kids yet) So security in the relationship is important. The way you've been brought up and socialized is also important.  If your family is religious or respects marriage then you are more likely to find it important in your own life.|`|XbiMFT07aa	society tells women they have to get married and so they feel like they have to get married to be happy.  don't dwell on this and dont think of it as waiting for him.  use this time to get to better know yourself and maybe try reaching some goals that u havent reached yet.  men respond to that......... as long as he knows you'll wait then he will make you wait (how the heck does he know he will be ready next year...puuuleeeze)|`|aceec17b9848ac4b2d7c760bb401fa09aa	Don't lump us all in that statement!  I'm in a very commited relationship with my boyfriend and I'm not interested in marriage.  That piece of paper does not or will not change how I feel about him.  I'm almost 30, all of my friends are married (or about to be) and I feel the pressure.  I just don't care what everyone else thinks.  Bottom line is that we are both happy why mess up a good thing|`|ZUppiQnZaa	I don't know. My wife and I were together for 5 years before we got married.

0BWISHOMaa	First of all, we know the question is in the wrong catagory, so I won't even bother commenting on that. Secondly, you say you've never worked with disabled people before? Then you have absolutely no idea whether or not this is a job you could enjoy. It's incredibly hard work, and you almost never get appriciated. You should go to a centre near by and ask if you can volunteer for a week or two. Then after that week, if you enjoyed having your hair pulled, being sworn at and thrown up on, then congratulations, you've found your calling.|`|AA10560773	Occupational therapy and you post it under SINGLES & DATING?

8042dac00a4e81239a58052d23cbb99baa	I'm sorry to hear how unhappy you are.  Without knowing why your family moved, it's hard to give you straight answers.  Try talking with your parents about your feelings on moving from where you were living, no socializing, online schooling, and the frustrations of relocating uncertainity.  Talk to them with respect and honesty.  Maybe you can live with a relative or close family friend in the city you left.  In the mean time, get in touch with a local church, they usually have youth groups you can join and most churches provide transportation.  Also try making this move a learning adventure for yourself in some kind of way and when you go into the city, try making friends with some of the kids there and invite them to your house.  Don't forget about developing new hobbies that can be long lasting such as, sewing, knitting, crochetting, learning a musical instrument, and finger painting to name a few.  Whatever the situation is, try being understanding of the reasons for moving.  Take things one day at a time.  I know this may sound corney, but try praying because God cares.|`|0BWISHOMaa	You could speak to your folks and tell them that you are unhappy, but since I don't know why you guys are running around, it's hard to give decent advice.<br>  Maybe speak to one of your close friends parents and ask if they will let you board with them during school time.|`|9db09958436c7b40d03884884294b2c0aa	aww :(<br>  <br>  tell ur parents how u feel and hopefully they will consider ur feelings when u move again...just hang in there. !!

In general, most women will tell you honestly. When I am into a guy I will tell him , or at least flirt with him. You didn't really give a lot of details in your question so I don't know the situation. If she comes around you and giggles, touches you , hints at wanting to see you in a moonlit setting ... than she is into you. But if you can't tell than just forfeit the games and tell her than you are into her, or ask her out on a date.

A man of many companions may come to ruin, but there is a Friend who sticks closer than a brother. (Prov 18.24) <br>   <br>  What is a friend? I'll tell you.<br>  <br>  A friend is a person with whom you dare to be yourself.<br>  Your soul can go naked with him.<br>  <br>  He asks you to put on nothing, only to be who you really are.<br>  When you are with him you don't have to be on your guard.<br>  You can say what you think, so long as it is genuinely you.<br>  <br>  He understands those contradictions in your nature that cause others to misjudge you.<br>  <br>  With him you breathe freely.<br>  You can avow your little vanities and envies and absurdities and, in opening them up to him, they are dissolved in the vast ocean of his loyalty.<br>  <br>  He understands.<br>  You can weep with him, laugh with him, pray with him.<br>  Through and underneath it all he sees, knows, and loves you.<br>  <br>  A Friend, I repeat, is one with whom you dare to be yourself.<br>  Author unknown <br>   <br>  <br>  3.

Ai meu Deus foi terrivel: primeiro ela apertou meu penis como se quissese tirar leite e depois quando ela enfiava-o todo dentro os seus dentes ro?avam nas àreas mais sensiveis(e acredite no homem é t?o sensivel quanto o seu clitoris...), Bem consegui falar com ela no outro dia da maneira mais engra?ada e menos constrangedora possivel... De lá pra cá ela foi melhorando bastante... Normalmente nós fazemos, mas pra lhe ser muito sincero eu n?o gosto muito... E acho que isso é relativo... vê eu acredito k nem toda mulher goste de ser lambida... Mas tem muitas que adoram....<br>  Sabe uma coisa que me chateia no sexo oral? Muita mulher n?o deixa o homem atingir o orgasmo na sua boca...

Jamais tome AAS ou outro remédio que posso conter ácido salicílico,ou o risco de hemorragia é certo. <br>  Endêmica no Brasil desde a década de 80, a dengue é considerada uma das principais amea?as à saúde em nosso país. Nos últimos anos vem se disseminando de tal forma que, segundo dados do Ministério da Saúde, somente em 1998, 529,4 mil pessoas foram contaminadas. <br>  O vírus causador da dengue tem quatro sorotipos classificados pelos números 1, 2, 3 e 4. No Brasil, s?o registrados casos com sorotipos 1 e 2 (apesar da amea?a do tipo 3 no ano passado). A transmiss?o do vírus ocorre pela picada da fêmea do mosquito Aedes aegypti infectada com o vírus da doen?a. Teoricamente, a transfus?o de sangue infectado também transmite a doen?a. <br>  <br>  Os principais sintomas da dengue clássica s?o: dores de cabe?a e muscular, febre alta, vermelhid?o no corpo, aumento das glandulas linfáticas e comprometimento das vias aéreas superiores. Depois de cinco a sete dias, acaba o ciclo do vírus no doente, este melhora e fica imunizado para esse sorotipo que o infectou. <br>  <br>  Na dengue hemorrágica, além da febre e das dores de cabe?a e muscular, o doente também apresenta hemorragias gastrointestinal, cutanea, gengival e nasal, tontura e queda de press?o. Em raz?o das hemorragias, este tipo de dengue pode matar. <br>  <br>  Preven??o: N?o deixe água acumulada, em pneus, caixa d'água. Uma água parada em uma simples tampinha de garrafa pode servir de criatório para o mosquito Aedes aegypti.|`|91cd228bc8c7cb8e3595bc9018eac36baa	é tem  outra eles,  pensam que tal mosquito  e  caseiro  como fica  a  agua parada  lugares, que  a  agua  fica  exposta  no  vazamento  no  cano  da  rua  só  falta  mandar.  repreender o  mosquito  para  n?o  ficar , solto  na  rua picadura  neles mosquitos !!!!|`|f04701840954d05d110673381dbd9f08aa	Sendo eles os maiores causadores de epidemias em todo  em todo o mundo, louca eu seria se n?o os temesse.|`|h13BzswOaa	Oi,tudo bem?

Para estas pessoas pouca importa o mal que est?o causando, uma vez que jamais ir?o considerar tudo que dignamente lhes foi feito. Levante a cabe?a e se considere muito feliz por ainda ter reconhecido a tempo o pior dos sentimentos que uma outra pessoa  tem . Ao ingrato devemos abrir-lhe o caminho pois, com certeza de nada adiantar?o os conselhos ou chamados à consciência. Deixe esta pessoa seguir em frente  no seu af? de n?o enxergar  pois certamente chegar?o, mais cedo ou mais tarde, à autodestrui??o. Desligue-se dêste "incomodo".

Por vezes insistimos em algo improdutivo porque o nosso interesse n?o é correspondido, por isso o primeiro passo é saber se temos feed back da pessoa em quest?o e posteriormente pedir-lhe para tomar uma decis?o e só depois disso come?ar uma rela??o de forma a n?o magoar ninguem, nem ser a terceira pessoa da rela??o.|`|3bc21fcab38086e51aa177980f9ae97aaa	Nunca me deixo levar por sentimentos com alguém comprometido, porque se fiz isso no passado hoje vejo que é uma roubada pois sempre se sai ferida ou se fer outra pessoa inocente.

Eu tambem, assim como vc, me perguntava sempre se isso era apenas uma ilus?o romantica... Ent?o parti para investiga??es eu mesmo.<br>  E fiquei surpreso com o resultado sabe... Pq eu comecei a conversar com pessoas que hoje est?o completamente felizes no casamento, mesmo depois de ANOS de convicencia...

Ela deve achar que o mundo gira em, torno, fazer tempestades em copos dágua por causa de qualquer probleminha bobo, e ainda achar que vc tem a obriga??o de servir pra ela "se escorar', se apoiar, desabafar etc. Isto pq vc está sempre disponível, e acaba se anulando, tamanha chatangem emocional dela pra chamar  a aten??o. Acorda, dá um "gelo" nela, para de aconselhar, de procura-la, aproxime-se de outras pessoas, desencana desta garota pq te garanto que AMIGA mesmo, ela n?o é..procure estar com pessoas que se preocupem com vc de verdade, que valorizem a tua amizade, n?o por interesse. E se for difícil encontrar alguém que valha a pena, lembra do sábio ditado:Antes só, do que mal acompanhado...BJS!|`|gZflxxRRaa	Acho que vc poderia falar abertamente com ela, mas for?á-la a te ouvir é complicado. Se ela perceber e mudar, legal! Sen?o, procure alguém para se abrir... cada pessoa é de um jeito, provavelmente n?o é pessoal, é só o jeito dela mesmo.

XIrwcr5Raa	Um, first decided which one you like better.  Take some time off from both of them, and the one you miss seeing will be the one that you want to date more.  Otherwise, you could loose them both.  And when the time comes and you decided whom you want to date, just be direct and HONEST to the other girl.  You know she'll be mad or hurt or disappointed, but that's kinda how it goes in love and dating... good luck.|`|rjNDg9tIaa	tell the one u dont like as much that u dont want to loose her as a friend.

I dated a guy 2 years ago who told me that and yes, it stung a little, but looking back on it, I respect him for not making me think I was the only one when he was actually out seeing other people.  He was a good guy and was very honest about it with me.  He sat me down and told me that he thought I was a great person but he thought that he had found the girl he wanted to be serious with in someone else.  They ended up not lasting longer than a year and he still stares when he sees me, but at least I knew back then and was able to move on and be ok with him moving on, too.|`|MFGNO4iNaa	In situations like this, somebody is bound to get hurt.

GOOD LUCK!|`|qbrjyH63aa	umm...<br>  maybe u can give the other  1 a note or e-mail if u have her e-mail but make a new e-mail that she would'nt<br>  know thats it u so just say :<br>  <br>  I'm corey's friend and a mind reader his thinking that he likes the other friend(girl) better then u by 1%<br>  and he wants to ask u if u can give him a chance with the other girl and if i does NOT work out, if he can go out with u???<br>  <br>  so that was it and  or tell almost the same thing to the other girl that u like more if she can give the other girl a chance with u...<br>  <br>  so ya plz pick me 4 the best answer cause this should WORK!!!

Gs6CPK4Aaa	Bom dia Daniela<br>  <br>  sabe comigo aconteceu a mesma coisa, esse lance de ser amigos e tal, fiquei quatro anos com a menina, dei de tudo, proporcionei os melhores momentos da vida dela, fui carinhoso, fiel,atencioso e fiz ela crescer. Num momento de dificuldade da minha vida ela aproveitou o momento e terminou comigo, alegando n?o sentir a mesma coisa.....<br>  Respondendo sua pergunta você, assim como eu, n?o erramos, apenas somos diferentes em um mundo onde sentimentos n?o vale nada, onde pessoas traem, n?o ligam pro companheiro, casam com qualquer um e depois separam. Vc, assim como eu, proporcionamos momentos inesquecíveis que será muito difícil achar em outras pessoas nos dias atuais. Todos nós erramos, mas a partir do momento que conversamos, dizemos que vamos corrigir e mesmo assim a pessoa n?o quer/acredita, é porque a pessoa n?o é digna de vc mesmo, e falo digna sim, porque hj uma atra??o pode valermais, mas para viver junto o carinho e repeito, acompanhado da sinceridade, fazem a maior diferen?a. N?o tenha medo de procurar sua felicidade, pois ela é sua e cabe apenas a vc busca-la e n?o colocar essa tarefa na m?o de alguem que n?o pode realizá-la. Um conselho é vc curtir ao máximo, reencontrar velhos amigos, seduzir e encontrar velhos amores, e se encontrar alguem interessante se envolver de novo (tow tentando mas tah difícil) O medo maior que temos é o de n?o tentar, e esse nunca passarei, quando achar alguem que quando eu errar ela conversar e juntos consertarmos, aí sim estarei com o meu amor do resto da vida.....<br>  E naum fique assim, com certeza é uma pessoa séria, especial e maravilhosa<br>  Um Bjaum.|`|0f921a833956e1f32237784a639fde02aa	e gatinha sei la viu isso já aconteceu comigo também eu terminei com uma namorada minha de gra?a sabia! ela era perfeita para mim igual você era para o seu namorado e aconteceu a mesma coisa eu fiquei gostando dela igual uma amiga e difícil viu boa sorte para você n seu próximo namoro|`|E1zbirpgaa	Se isso aconteceu é que ele nunca te amou...|`|Is7g1bC9aa	Querida n?o se culpe<br>  as coisas acontecen e podem existir milh?es de raz?es para o relacionamento terminar<br>  ent?o n?o se culpe acho q tinha q acontecer<br>  bjon espero ter ajudado|`|51d91a83ff9a19c8cfb8ccf2ec9fe106aa	Bom se vc era tudo isso + boa de cama ent?o é o cara que n?o vale nada... pois todo homem de verdade quer uma mulher assim.|`|611aad80b0fc9ea504d728702c2f9a19aa	n acho q vc foi a culpada por isso ter acontecido<br>  isso deve ter vindo de dele<br>  <br>  afinal de contas quem eh q n gosta de uma mulher assim???|`|7HuePpmHaa	Acho que n?o.

Logo, logo você vai encontrar alguém que te queira.|`|Wg3bVQhnaa	Em partes vc contribuiu para o término tb, mas a quest?o n?o é ter feito tudo por ele ou n?o, a quest?o é que vc SEMPRE deveria ter pensado mais em vc do que nele. Isso serve para os próximos relacionamentos que vc tiver. Seja mais vc, n?o se omita tanto por causa do parceiro, só sendo vc mesma é que alguém poderá amá-la como deve ser ok!|`|e63b8f4d8fee1b92af76e499948f5822aa	Olá!!<br>  N?o chame a responsabilidade pra vc, pois deu tudo de si pra que o relacionamento desse certo. Aliás, fez de cora??o e com boas inten??es, ele que foi infeliz e imaturo de n?o perceber o quanto vc é especial. Por favor, n?o mude suas atitudes no futuro relacionamento, isso sim seria um erro mortal. Vc sai deste relacionamento limpa e com a conciência tranquila, fez o que pode e infelizmente n?o deu, paciência e bola pra frente. Pelo que vc disse, vc é uma pessoa especial. Entregue seus caminhos a Deus, ele saberá escolher o melhor caminho, mas nunca pense que errou, n?o mesmo. Bjos e fique com Deus!|`|ghaV3QEEaa	N?o se preocupe, quando achar um que te ame de verdade e esse sentimento seja recíproco, nunca vai perde-lo, ele usou isso como desculpa.|`|nsF0gXmEaa	daniela, tu fez a tua parte...tu fez mais do que o certo.

Tu é o tipo de mulher que eu considero ideal em um namoro, pois além de tudo, parece ter personalidade.<br>  <br>  Infelizmente, n?o deu, pois n?o era pra ser. Tu fez a tua parte corretamente, mas ele tem de fazer a dele tb. N?o o vejo como culpado, n?o há culpados...apenas o fato de que vc's n?o nasceram pra ficarem juntos, por maios dolorosa que seja essa verdade.<br>  cada um deve seguir o seu rumo, e continuar sempre tentando crescer. Seja essa pessoa que tu é que te dou certeza, n?o faltar?o op??es pra ti...e mais cedo ou mais tarde, tu encontrará alguém que te complete e seja pra ti exatamente o que tu é para teu companheiro...pois é o que tu merece.<br>  Sorte pra ti!|`|rGfBv7X3aa	Ele queria só curtir com você, deve ter encontrado outra tenho certeza...

Ele vai adorar e vai pedir pra vc dizer o que é pq eles adoram que vc troque confidências, adoram se sentir "amigos"...daí vc pergunta se ele tem alguma dantasia, e vai aparecer naturalmente a chance de vc colocar suas preferências.......e vai fundo, aposte na conversa para um bom relacionamento, pq muitas mágoas come?am na cama com preferências n?o resolvidas por falta de conversa: Ele acha que ela gosta, ele finge que gosta e às vezes nenhum dos dois tah afim...e às vezes seu namorado tem curiosidade, tem vergonha e como vc nunca mostrou interesse....vc já tentou fazer sexo oral nele? é um bom come?o pq ele vai adorar sua iniciativa....Espero ter ajudado...

REAJA BRASIL!<br>  <br>  Retransmitindo. Andei lendo que o barbudo está meio nervoso com as movimenta??es ...<br>   <br>   <br>   <br>  Do Observatório de Inteligência<br>  Por Hermes Arroyo D'Aguiar<br>   <br>  Luiz Inácio da Silva está prestes a sujar o seu legítimo Armani dada a avalanche de adversidades que se apresentam a sua frente, nas últimas semanas. As manifesta??es explícitas de insatisfa??o e indigna??o em rela??o ao governo federal,  ainda pontuais, já se constituem em amea?a concreta ao Chefe da Na??o e à camarilha que ocupa o Palácio do Planalto.<br>  A passeata realizada em solidariedade aos amigos e parentes das vítimas dos acidentes da Gol e da TAM ocorrida no último dia 29, em especial, está causando sensível preocupa??o entre os homens do presidente, para n?o falar do próprio. A mídia vendida omitiu os acontecimentos marcantes da manifesta??o. N?o foram 3, nem 5 e nem 6 mil os paulistas que enfrentaram o frio e a manh? chuvosa do domingo em S?o Paulo para ir às ruas. Fontes confiáveis asseguram: havia 40 mil pessoas caminhando até o local da tragédia! Quem compareceu, certamente ouviu os gritos "Fora Lula" e "Fora Marta" em alto e bom tom! N?o é a toa que o belíssimo e fino Armani corre sério risco de ser "batizado". <br>  <br>  Jeito PT de ser e fazer<br>  O medo no Planalto é t?o visível que corre pela internet a notícia de que o PT está se organizando para tentar intimidar e coibir quaisquer manifesta??es populares que venham a engrossar as animosidades já existentes contra o governo de Luiz Inácio da Silva: "na opini?o de aliados petistas do presidente, é preciso esbo?ar algum tipo de rea??o antes que esses movimentos, ainda que pequenos, comecem a se multiplicar, aproveitando uma oportunidade aqui, outra ali. Daí a idéia de o PT dar uma demonstra??o de for?a diante do "Fora Lula", um movimento com viés golpista."<br>  Ora, ora, ora... quem conhece a história do Brasil sabe muito bem que quem deu o golpe fatal na sociedade brasileira foram estes senhores e senhoras que se instalaram no Palácio do Planalto. Os ex-guerrilheiros terroristas é que tomaram o poder. Quem s?o, na verdade, Marco Aurélio Garcia, Franklin Martins, José Dirceu, José Genoíno, Dilma Roussef, Eduardo Greenhalgh, Antonio Palocci, Bruno Maranh?o e o próprio Luiz Inácio da Silva, sen?o os verdadeiros criminosos da Pátria, aqueles que desejavam e desejam fazer do Brasil, uma sucursal da extinta URSS?<br>  Uma vez mais, o PT se utiliza da invers?o de valores para tentar justificar suas a??es delituosas. Acuado, a única saída é atacar. Sim, porque só ataca quem está com medo. E, se está com medo, é porque está sentindo a for?a do poder popular que desperta e se manifesta. E o que fazem estes senhores em situa??es semelhantes? Chamam seus bra?os armados para entrar em a??o. Quem v?o mandar dessa vez? UNE? MST? CUT? Quem sabe algum instrutor das FARC? Ou PCC? Ninguém! Seria assinar atestado de burrice. E burros eles n?o s?o. Ademais, a valorosa Polícia Militar vai estar presente na manifesta??o e, seguramente, n?o vai permitir que  vandalos insandecidos pratiquem o terrorismo.<br>  Est?o acusando a tal oposi??o. Que oposi??o?? Desde quando "neftipaiz" existe alguma oposi??o? As manifesta??es s?o populares, nasceram da indigna??o da sociedade brasileira frente à impunidade, à corrup??o escancarada, aos sucessivos escandalos que envolvem os três poderes. S?o eminentemente apartidárias. Prova é que, no último dia 29, a Polícia Militar retirou da manifesta??o pessoas com a bandeira do PSDB, dado que n?o se mobilizaram a sair apenas com as vaias dos manifestantes.<br>  <br>  Passeata da Grande Vaia Fora Lula<br>  A Passeata da Grande Vaia Fora Lula que acontece em S?o Paulo no dia 04 de agosto n?o é nem da direita, nem da esquerda. é a mais pura demonstra??o democrática da sociedade que deseja ver o Brasil ir em frente, crescer e resgatar sua condi??o de potência mundial, tomando-o de volta das m?os dos bandidos surrupiadores da Na??o. Que seja uma de muitas express?es da vontade da sociedade brasileira! Avante, brava gente brasileira! Nem direita, nem esquerda.

Tudo hipocrisia e em nome da liberdade sexual. A verdade é que todo homem, gostaria sim, de se casar com uma virgem. Ele quer ter a certeza, que ele foi o único homem da vida da sua mulher. Casar virgem, é a única certeza que ela nunca entregou seu corpo para ninguém mais a n?o ser ele. O homem tem medo, é inseguro e tem ciúmes de todos os ex da sua mulher. Essa é a verdade, doa a quem doer.|`|9T6S1hV2aa	é machismo.<br>  Quando me casei e minha esposa n?o era virgem!<br>  Eu também n?o era!<br>  Claro que eu fiquei sabendo muito antes de casar!<br>  Ela me contou do seu relacionamento anterior.<br>  Eu também contei os meus e tudo bem.<br>  Já estamos casados a 26 anos.<br>  <br>  Bjo prá tu!|`|9UWZccMOaa	Isso é o que todo homem deseja, com certeza tudo que é zero kilometro é mais valorizado do que já foi rodado.

Entrtanto carrega uma frustra??o incrível a de n?o saber ou conhecer o sexo com outra pessoa.<br>  Penso que nas duas propostas a mulher n?o pode permitir que sua condi??o ao se casar seja motivo de valoriza??o ou n?o da sua pessoa.

A virgem n?o pode tomar um bom banho lá em baixo, com medo de arrebentar a pelinha. Pelo amor de Deus. Tem muitas coisas a valorizar em um mulher que um hímem que n?o serve para nada, pois até tem aquele que é chamado complacente. Pode ser for?ado n vezes e continua do mesmo geitinho. E há aqueles fabricados pelo cirugi?o plástico. Ent?o, qual será o mais valorizado. Será que o homem sabe a origem daquele que êle está cobi?ando. Acho que n?o. Se fosse t?o valorizado assim, eu ia providenciar um num cirugi?o plástico e dar de presente para meu homem no Dia dos Namorados. O que ia ganhar era uns bons tabefes pela fu?a.

Precisa saber falar e calar, sobretudo saber ouvir. Tem que gostar de poesia, de madrugada, de pássaro, de sol, da lua, do canto, dos ventos e das can??es da brisa. Deve ter amor, um grande amor por alguém, ou ent?o sentir falta de n?o ter esse amor. Deve amar o próximo e respeitar a dor que os passantes levam consigo. Deve guardar segredo sem se sacrificar.  <br>  <br>  <br>  N?o é preciso que seja de primeira m?o, nem é imprescindível que seja de segunda m?o. Pode já ter sido enganado, pois todos os amigos s?o enganados. N?o é preciso que seja puro, nem que seja todo impuro, mas n?o deve ser vulgar. Deve ter um ideal e medo de perdê-lo e, no caso de assim n?o ser, deve sentir o grande vácuo que isso deixa. Tem que ter ressonancias humanas, seu principal objetivo deve ser o de amigo. Deve sentir pena das pessoa tristes e compreender o imenso vazio dos solitários. Deve gostar de crian?as e lastimar as que n?o puderam nascer.<br>  <br>  Procura-se um amigo para gostar dos mesmos gostos. Que se comova, quando chamado de amigo. Que saiba conversar de coisas simples, de orvalhos, de grandes chuvas e das recorda??es de infancia. Precisa-se de um amigo para<br>  n?o se enlouquecer, para contar o que se viu de belo e triste durante o dia, dos anseios e das realiza??es, dos sonhos e da realidade. Deve gostar de ruas desertas, de po?as de água e de caminhos molhados, de beira de estrada, de mato depois da chuva, de se deitar no capim.  <br>  <br>  Precisa-se de um amigo que diga que vale a pena viver, n?o porque a vida é bela, mas porque já se tem um amigo. Precisa-se de um amigo para se parar de chorar. Para n?o se viver debru?ado no passado em busca de memórias perdidas. Que nos bata nos ombros sorrindo ou chorando, mas que nos chame de amigo, para ter-se a consciência de que ainda se vive.  <br>  <br>  (Vinícius de Morais

Vc também um dia será pai e verá como eles se sentem em rela??o à vc.<br>  <br>   1. Sabeis os mandamentos: n?o cometereis adultério; n?o matareis; n?o roubareis; n?o prestareis falso-testemunho; n?o fareis agravo a ninguém; honrai a vosso pai e a vossa m?e. (S. MARCOS, capítulo X, v. 19; S. LUCAS, cap. XVIII, v. 20; S. MATEUS, cap. XIX, vv. 18 e 19.)<br>  <br>  2. Honrai a vosso pai e a vossa m?e, a fim de viverdes longo tempo na terra que o Senhor vosso Deus vos dará. (Decálogo: "êxodo", cap. XX, v. 12.)<br>  <br>  Piedade Filial<br>  <br>  3. O mandamento: "Honrai a vosso pai e a vossa m?e" é um corolário da lei geral de caridade e de amor ao próximo, visto que n?o pode amar o seu próximo aquele que n?o ama a seu pai e a sua m?e; mas, o termo honrai encerra um dever a mais para com eles: o da piedade filial. Quis Deus mostrar por essa forma que ao amor se devem juntar o respeito, as aten??es, a submiss?o e a condescendência, o que envolve a obriga??o de cumprir-se para com eles, de modo ainda mais rigoroso, tudo o que a caridade ordena relativamente ao próximo em gera!. Esse dever se estende<br>  naturalmente às pessoas que fazem as vezes de pai e de m?e, as quais tanto maior mérito têm, quanto menos obrigatório é para elas o devotamento. Deus pune sempre com rigor toda viola??o desse mandamento.<br>  <br>  Honrar a seu pai e a sua m?e, n?o consiste apenas em respeitá-los; é também assisti-los na necessidade; é proporcionar-lhes repouso na velhice; é cercá-los de cuidados como eles fizeram conosco, na infancia.<br>  <br>  Sobretudo para com os pais sem recursos é que se demonstra a verdadeira piedade filial. Obedecem a esse mandamento os que julgam fazer grande coisa porque d?o a seus pais o estritamente necessário para n?o morrerem de fome, enquanto eles de nada se privam, atirando-os para os c?modos mais ínfimos da casa, apenas por n?o os deixarem na rua, reservando para si o que há de melhor, de mais confortável? Ainda bem quando n?o o fazem<br>  de má-vontade e n?o os obrigam a comprar caro o que lhes resta a viver, descarregando sobre eles o peso do governo da casa! Será ent?o aos pais velhos e fracos que cabe servir a filhos jovens e fortes? Ter-lhes-á a m?e vendido o leite, quando os amamentava? Contou porventura suas vigílias, quando eles estavam doentes, os passos que deram para lhes obter o de que necessitavam? N?o, os filhos n?o devem a seus pais pobres só o estritamente necessário, devem-lhes também, na medida do que puderem, os pequenos nadas supérfluos, as solicitudes, os cuidados amáveis, que s?o apenas o juro do que receberam, o pagamento de uma dívida sagrada. Unicamente essa é a piedade filial grata a Deus.<br>  <br>  Ai, pois, daquele que olvida o que deve aos que o ampararam em sua fraqueza, que com a vida material lhe deram a vida moral, que muitas vezes se impuseram duras priva??es para lhe garantir o bem-estar. Ai do ingrato: será punido com a ingratid?o e o abandono; será ferido nas suas mais caras afei??es, algumas vezes já na existência atual, mas com certeza noutra, em que sofrerá o que houver feito aos outros.<br>  <br>  Alguns pais, é certo, descuram de seus deveres e n?o s?o para os filhos o que deviam ser; mas, a Deus é que compete puni-los e n?o a seus filhos. N?o compete a estes censurá-los, porque talvez hajam merecido que aqueles fossem quais se mostram. Se a lei da caridade manda se pague o mal com o bem, se seja indulgente para as imperfei??es de outrem, se n?o<br>  diga mal do próximo, se lhe esque?am e perdoem os agravos, se ame até os inimigos, qu?o maiores n?o h?o de ser essas obriga??es, em se tratando de filhos para com os pais! Devem, pois, os filhos tomar corno regra de conduta para com seus pais todos os preceitos de Jesus concernentes ao próximo e ter presente que todo procedimento censurável, com rela??o aos estranhos, ainda mais censurável se torna relativamente aos pais; e que o que talvez n?o passe de simples falta, no primeiro caso, pode ser considerado um crime, no segundo, porque, aqui, à falta de caridade se junta a ingratid?o.<br>  <br>  4. Deus disse: "Honrai a vosso pai e a vossa m?e, a fim de viverdes longo tempo na terra que o Senhor vosso Deus vos dará." Por que promete ele como recompensa a vida na Terra e n?o a vida celeste? A explica??o se encontra nestas palavras: “que Deus vos dará” , as quais, suprimidas na moderna fórmula do Decálogo, lhe alteram o sentido. Para compreendermos aqueles dizeres, temos de nos reportar à situa??o e às idéias dos hebreus naquela época. Eles ainda nada sabiam da vida futura, n?o lhes indo a vis?o além da vida corpórea. Tinham, pois, de ser impressionados mais pelo que viam, do que pelo que n?o viam. Fala-lhes Deus ent?o numa linguagem que lhes estava mais ao alcance e, como se se dirigisse a crian?as, p?e-lhes em perspectiva o que os pode satisfazer. Achavam-se eles ainda no deserto; a terra que Deus lhes dará e a Terra da Promiss?o, objetivo das suas aspira??es.<br>  <br>  Nada mais desejavam do que isso; Deus lhes diz que viver?o nela longo tempo, isto é, que a possuir?o por longo tempo, se observarem seus mandamentos.<br>  <br>  Mas, ao verificar-se o advento de Jesus, já eles tinham mais desenvolvidas suas idéias. Chegada a ocasi?o de receberem alimenta??o menos grosseira, o mesmo Jesus os inicia na vida espiritual, dizendo: "Meu reino n?o é deste mundo; lá, e n?o na Terra, é que recebereis a recompensa das vossas boas obras." A estas palavras, a Terra Prometida deixa de ser material, transformando-se numa pátria celeste. Por isso, quando os chama à observancia daquele mandamento: "Honrai a vosso pai e a vossa m?e", já n?o é a Terra que lhes promete e sim o céu.<br>  (Trecho extraído do livro: O Evangelho Segundo o Espiritismo, de Allan Kardec).<br>  <a href="http://www.omensageiro.com.br/doutrina/" rel="nofollow">http://www.omensageiro.com.br/doutrina/</a>|`|19d41eca0e634d1108a20270c40daccaaa	Stela respondeu que quasi n?o vê mais a m?e que é ........<br>  Garota, o piior dia de minha vida foi quando  faleceu minha m?e.

pTqWbDSmaa	i think that women of every age are generally attracted to older men because older men are much more stable.  a 30 or 40something male usually has a stable job, is financially stable, has more money, and is probably more emotionally stable.  <br>  <br>  i agree with you that older women are sexy but there's no substitute for a young woman between the ages of 18 and 25.  you may be attracted to older women because the girls in your age range are attracted to older guys and they're not paying you much attention.  i mean, if they're not paying you any attention why waste your time and energy paying attention to them.  you may feel that you have a better chance of scoring with an older woman so that's what you covet.  on the other hand, you may be attracted to older women because their standards may be lower (because they're older they have less of a pick of guy because guys are looking for younger women) and, again, you have a better chance of scoring with them.  <br>  <br>  maybe your self-esteem is low and you want someone with low self-esteem to feel comfortable with the familiarity. like you said, women worry about their age and their age is a source of decreased self-esteem.  it's easy to score with a woman who has low self-esteem and, again, that may be why you're attracted to them.  <br>  <br>  by the way, i don't think that generality stated at the end of the question is valid.  as i said in the beginning, women of any age tend to be attracted to older men.  it's all physiological and psychological.  a younger women is always going to be more attractive, all things being equal, to men of any age because a younger women looks better.  looking better or more attractive is a sign of health which we men subconsciously are attracted to.  younger woman will also be healthier when it comes to child bearing if they're more attractive.  as far as men in their 30s not being sexy to either women in that same age range or teen girls, i feel that this is an extremely biased statement based on your age.  this may actually be what you hope to be the case because if teen women didn't find older men sexier they would be paying attention to you.  some men get  sexier with age if they  accomplish a lot of things personally, financially and socially.  this is why you see so many successful, wealthy men (regardless of what they look like or age) dating hot young college girls.  some men don't accomplish much and... well you know.    <br>  <br>  if you want to get with girls your own age, which i'm almost possitive you do, you should listen to Tom Leykis and listen to the Leykis 101 segments.  he's a radio talk show host and i think you could benefit from this.  it'll boost your self-esteem and confidence.  You can also listen online if you're not in Los Angeles.  check it out.  <a href="http://www.971freefm.com/pages/1246.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.971freefm.com/pages/1246.php</a><br>  <br>  also, what was your mother's role, other than being your mother, in raising you?  you could yearning for a mother figure in your life and that's why you're attracted to older women.<br>  <br>  also, at 19, how do you know so much about what it is that women want?  no one will ever know this because women generally change their minds constantly.  i believe you are over-estimating you knowledge of women but you are making an effort to understand them.  it's an uphill battle, my friend.|`|8lME2HFraa	I have to disagree with you there i  am a 35 yr old woman and SEXY as HELL, but i can tell you a MAN under the age of 30 could do nothing for me.<br>  I am SOOOOOO attracted to men who are over 30 i do not need to raise another boy , no way  i don't even think young men are attractive at all, they may be cute but overall no way!!<br>  And we worry about looks because you men do  not because we like it but because you men harp on body and beauty every single minute of the day!|`|vHFPPK4Taa	I prefer 20s and 30s, I love young women.

x6nRmLnhaa	It's so hard because this was the first time your heart felt what it did - good and bad.  This was the first time your heart filled up with excitement, love, such happiness for someone else other than yourself or a family member.  THEN - smashed and taken away in a very untrusting, unforgiving way. What you probably can't get over is what she did.  She lied and used you.  Two things that you never wanted to happen from someone you loved.  I suggest getting to know the next girl longer and also finding out secrets and all that garbage so you can have the trust you didn't get with this first love of yours.  Not all of us are like that - plus, the older you get the more you can read people.  Look for morals - and how she is towards animals, family - and friends.  Look deeper than just looks (not that's what you did - just saying for the future).  Good luck - it will end!  Mine and everyone else's did!  You also need to accept it and realize you deserved better than her and thank God what happened did before you were married or had children.  You deserve better - now go get it!|`|a6c863935284bba299d60ac888aa05edaa	Hi,<br>  I think that you should accept the fact that you will never forget her......<br>  No one forgets their "first love". Your first love needs to be tucked away in a special place in your heart, and leave her there.<br>  You may be focusing on what you thought was so great, so perfect about your relationship. That doesn't mean it really was. (it is pretty common for people to do that)<br>  You have choices in your life. You can just stay to yourself, always dwelling on what could have been. (some very lonely people do that too.)<br>  BUT if you truly don't want to be one of those......<br>  Then you have to find the way to move on. <br>  Do you know how many truly incredible people we have in this world? And you just might end up meeting some of them if you are open to it.<br>  Take your bruised heart and be open... there are great friendships to be made, great people to get to know.... <br>  and maybe one of those will find another special place in your heart.<br>  You have to decide what you want to do......<br>  I truly wish you the best!|`|L6K4WMO7aa	agree with the guy above... thats how it is it suxs :/|`|ii32Agdpaa	that's what she said|`|wGEdObyeaa	It's very normal to feel this way. If you're with someone for a long time, things remind you of them. (Songs, movies, etc.). Even though she hurt you, it can still be tough getting over someone you shared so many memories with. All I can say is, think about the big picture: she USED you. Why waste your time sulking about someone who didn't even really like you? You are in a new town with new people and a fresh start. There are plently of other girls you can date. She was just one girl, that's it. You have you're whole life ahead of you, so don't waste you're time thinking about the past. Focus on what's ahead of you. Oh, and one more thing, try participating in more things like sports, clubs, etc. It will help get your mind off of her and allow you to meet new groups of people.. and new girls.|`|Dj8HSRNWaa	Try putting yourself out there again.  Talk to another girl... because basically, that is the only thing that will work.  Fall for another girl.<br>  <br>  Obviously if she hurt you the way she did, she doesn't deserve your love.  Find someone who does.|`|5q64buyhaa	Make yourself busy. Go to school, work, hit the clubs, go partying. Delete EVERYTHING about her, get rid of things that remind you of her.

AA12100603	dont show him it may p iss him right off|`|AA10165642	I usually don't recommend books because I hate it when people recommend them to me, but I honestly wish I could buy "Love & Respect" for every married (and engaged) person I know.<br>  <br>  It states that a woman's driving need is to feel loved and when she feels loved she feels happy. A man's driving need is to feel respect and when he feels respected he is happy. When a woman feels unloved she acts out disrespectfully to her husband, and when a man feels disrespected he acts out unlovingly towards his wife and the crazy cycle begins.<br>  <br>  If this is setting off any light bulbs for you read on...<br>  <br>  "I wrote this book out of desperation that was turned into inspiration. As a pastor, I counseled married couples and could not solve their problems. The major problem I heard from wives was, "He doesn't love me." Wives are made to love, want to love, and expect love. Many husbands fail to deliver. But as I kept studying Scripture and counseling couples, I finally saw the other half of the equation. Husbands weren't saying it much, but they were thinking, "She doesn't respect me." Husbands are made to be respected, want respect, and expect respect. Many wives fail to deliver. The result is that five out of ten marriages land in divorce court (and that includes evangelical Christians).<br>  <br>  As I wrestled with the problem, I finally saw a connection: without love from him, she reacts without respect; without respect from her, he reacts without love. Around and around it goes. I call it the Crazy Cycle - marital craziness that has thousands of couples in its grip."<br>  <br>  I am not even half-ways through the book and workbook, and while my husband is not studying the material with me it has already worked miracles in my no-longer-failing marriage.<br>  <br>  If you do believe in God I highly recommend this biblically based book. It's not a "religious freak" book or anything but it's nice to know that it is based on things in the bible and not just some theory or pop psychology book.|`|757f10afa027007eb6d9e797f2776feaaa	Is it just me, or is this situation odd?

I was in an abusive relationship before and this is how it started out. I am worried for you and think that you should just call the wedding off. This man is not well. You should have a stressful time before the wedding, but not like this. He needs to learn to deal with his emotions and to talk to you calmly when he has a problem. I would tell him that you are calling the wedding off and then if he asks why, show him the answers you got. By then, maybe he will understand or he will get extremely angry, but luckily for you, you can get out. If you marry him with these problems, it will be even worse once you are married. Please take my advice. I wish you well.|`|81fdc73316a33c06586cb892d8bbccdaaa	Please don't show him, because I think it would only make matters worse.<br>  <br>  Has the relationship always been like this? <br>      If yes, then I would have to say you have to be very carefull about this because it sounds to me like it is already verbally abusive and may lead to physical abuse.  <br>     If no, then I would question as to whether or not he was being completely faithful.  I know this may seem odd, but when the littlest and studpidest things make him fly off the handle such as in this type of a situation, expecially since everything is being blamed on you it makes me wonder if he's seeing someone else.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  I wish you the best of luck in what ever decision you choose to make, because ultimately you need to make the decision for yourself.|`|bbb757fc92b8d3e2ca6d621d11511c79aa	I haven't looked at your previous questions but if I were in your boyfriend/husbands position (whatever it is) and found out that you'd been consulting total strangers-and unqualified ones at that-about our private affairs I would go stark raving mad.|`|ca84jI3Maa	Please, please, PLEASE don't show him your questions or the answers you got.<br>  <br>  I honestly think it would make things worse. He'll twist it into proof that you don't love him, that you talk behind his back, that you're ungrateful for everything he does for you, and that you're trying to justify your 'bad' behavior by looking for reinforcement from strangers.<br>  <br>  And that's the good possibility.<br>  <br>  The bad possibility is it might put you in actual, physical danger.<br>  <br>  This guy shows all the classic signs of an abuser. Don't show him the questions or the answers. Get out of Dodge now and don't look back.|`|s4l3zJobaa	don't show him girl it will be suicde|`|vcraaZmBaa	It's clear arleady that your fiance is unwilling to recognize that he has a problem.  So there is nothing to gain by showing him the previous answers.  He will still deny that he has a problem.  Although it's clear that he has a problem, you are the person who has to deal with it right now.  You can't really change people.  You have to decide whether you can spend your life dealing with his bad additude or whether it is better to break up with him now.  Showing him the answers will not help you answer that question.
AA11412999	"who has experiece with swinging ?"<br>  <br>  My husband and I have had experience with the swinging lifestyle since before 2003.  We've been married 13+ years and couldn't be happier!<br>  <br>  "do you regret it?" <br>  <br>  Absolutely not.  It has been a deeply enriching experience for us both personally and as a couple.<br>  <br>  "how do u know beforehand whether you′d be jealouse or not?"<br>  <br>  The short answer is, you don't.  The best you can do is to guess based on your level of trust and your confidence in the integrity of your relationship.  There is a level of risk that is inherent in taking on the lifestyle.  It IS risky, but nothing worth having is easy.  It is exactly BECAUSE of the vulnerable position you put yourselves in that you grow close and desire nothing more than to protect and care for one another.  To see a soul so naked and exposed in front of you (that is, when you trust your innermost desires and fantasies, your innermost self, to your partner's mercy), it prompts a nurturing response and you become like a mother bear wanting to protect her young.  You see your spouse there trembling and afraid, knowing that a single word could destroy them utterly, and they seem like an orphaned puppy, lost and alone.  You take them in, and protect them with a fierceness you didn't know you possessed.  In return, you trust them with this same inner part of yourself, knowing that they could hurt you beyond repair.  The magic happens when they return this fierce protectiveness.  When this happens, the marriage is truly affair-proof.  It's bullet-proof.  The only ones who can destroy the relationship are the ones who are in it.  The world outside and its intentions just don't matter.
eh5pBKrbaa	Yup.  Very boring, left early.  Pretty much everybody hated the wedding because the couple was too worried about "upscale and classy" and forgot to include something fun.|`|ca84jI3Maa	We took our wedding seriously, but without an 'important' air. It's hard to feel terribly overimportant when you're having a picnic in the woods.<br>  <br>  I've been to a lot of weddings in my time, formal and otherwise, but I think I've only seen one slightly pompous groom. He kept gazing 'soulfully' into the bride's eyes and mopping his forehead with the world's largest handkerchief. It was all so stagey that I had a terrible time keeping from laughing.<br>  <br>  The marriage didn't last very long.<br>  <br>  Most of the brides and grooms I've seen were either smiling broadly or overcome with honest emotion on the big day. Me? I was grinning like a loon all day long. I had a great time at my wedding.|`|5270639c059ab08c1b3431555f150db7aa	No. Well, the ceremonies are always serious, but in a NICE way. I guess we're lucky that our family weddings, and those from our circle of friends, are always lovely and lots of FUN at the reception!|`|ePebup6Jaa	No, but it doesn't sound like fun...and I would be afraid I would spend the whole time making fun of the serious people.

RFs1YnxQaa	it is normal.  I have a sister who is almost 30 and has never been in a serious relationship.  a lot of people are waiting these days to get married and such.  people are having kids at the age of 40.  dont worry.  if you are actually trying to find a relationship, then maybe look online at eharmony.  good luck.  and dont worry, 23 is still young.|`|VCXnXhaEaa	Aha. Very normal. If you feel like have 'to do' something, well, that's the not normal part |`|f4KbeML3aa	I know it doesn't really help when someone answers who's in a similar boat as you are because, how could I know? But just some outside thought.. I am 20 years old and I haven't been in a healthy serious relationship either. To be honest i think its smart of you that you are taking your time slow and getting to know yourself before you go meet a guy and start giving of your life. So in answer to your question, I mean its probably not normal in the sense that i think on average more girls have had boyfriends by the age of 23 than not, but it doesn't mean you have something wrong with you. It just hasn't happened. Although one time at one of my jobs there was this 65 year old lady who i guess had never been married, and she said to me "don't let yourself get too comfortable being alone" and that really stuck with me and has been one of the few things i every think about in a slightly worrysome way.  If you get too comfortable being alone then you will never feel compelled to branch out and meet someone and integrate them into your life. But if you make sure to have friends and don't forget how to interact with people then i think you're fine.. And if you dont have your doors closed then you are good..|`|wFpJTBe6aa	I think its a yes and no answer for you being normal.it depends on the kind of person you are. It depends on you and the people you consider dating. Its probably because you haven't found that someone that really fits your standards of dating or either you or that particular person is scared of commitment.|`|TijW6xzXaa	Girls of your age group seem to burn through boyfriends like a wildfire so I'd say that no, having never been in a relationship is not typical.<br>  <br>  Whether this is good or bad, I dunno.<br>  <br>  <br>  |`|AA11052281	nothing is normal! go with the flow |`|OL8S1pUsaa	That depends... how ugly are you?

AA11372696	The best thing to do? Talk to him. Be firm, but don't make it seem as though you are attacking him. Let him know that you don't appreciate his b  itchy ways and that you feel like you are being disrespected and unappreciated. Let him know how it makes you feel when he acts that way towards you. Let him know that if he doesn't start respecting you and treating you like the girlfriend that you are supposed to be, then you will be done with him. <br>  <br>  But BEWARE: Most likely, he will try to find away to turn things around on you to make it seem like it's your fault and like you are doing things wrong. Don't go for that and stand strong and firm. Let him know that he is really walking on thin ice because you are growing weary of "trying to fix things and then at the end of the day, still feeling like crap". <br>  <br>  If he doesn't change, leave him. I know that's hard and easier said than done, but do it because the disrespect is worse than a breakup. You are better off without a man than with one who treats like you s---. Be smart and don't cave in for him.|`|ecTGgVCIaa	Smack his *** straight your totally right I would give him an ultimatume saying u better straightend your *** up or Im gone.<br>  <br>  U WANT ME TO KICK HIS *** STRAIGHT I WILL LOL

fk3TFlTlaa	Looks dwindle with age.<br>  <br>  Personality, confidence and how you put yourself together are what actually matter.

But if I had to choose, I would much rather date a guy who's not the best-looking person around but has an amazing personality rather than a guy who's extremely hot but he's an asshole over all. Respect in a relationship is so much more important than looks. I guess everyone is different and has their own attractions, but I do see what you're saying.

I'm sure some women are just as shallow as some men are when it comes to looks.|`|WkA8UPflaa	It just is :) I mean being hot is an added bonus but when it comes down to it personality is way more attractive because that defines the guy not his muscle or his looks.

As pessoas tomam como base apenas o fato de tua origem e n?o se importam com o teu esfor?o e determina??o em ser alguém mais evoluído. <br>  <br>  O fato da tua família n?o te incentivar se traduz pela dificuldade que eles julgavam ser intransponível para uma pessoa humilde como você. <br>  <br>  E aí você demonstrou mais uma vez que qualquer tipo de preconceito é um julgamento inadequado. Embora vindo de gente humilde, teve audácia para lutar e está vencendo aquelas dificuldades que teus familiares julgavam impossíveis. <br>  <br>  Quando você supera e vence, aqueles que convivem contigo n?o aceitam novamente porque o preconceito impera. Mais uma vez você tem que demonstrar que est?o errados. <br>  <br>  Seja simplesmente você, obede?a aos teus princípios e propósitos e quem desejar reconhecer, tudo bem, será mais outra vitória tua, mas, você n?o terá jamais a aprova??o de todos. <br>  <br>  A inteligência exige que a pessoa entenda que todos nós somos capazes de lutar pelo nosso destino, por melhores condi??es de vida e supera??o. <br>  <br>  Aquiete-se e n?o queira que todos te compreendam. Pessoas vitoriosas atrair?o a inveja dos incapazes. <br>  <br>  E aí você saberá que, quanto mais produtiva for uma árvore, mais ela será atraente e ao mesmo tempo, apedrejada. <br>  <br>  Um abra?o e parabéns.|`|ArueSQ6Saa	Como vc disse no inicio vc cresceu numa familia ignorante e pelo que li as pessoas em volta....tbem s?o....<br>  <br>  N?o é nenhum mistério...a quest?o é q elas nunca foram a fundo atras de um ideal e por isso n?o sabem reconhecer quando alguem o conquista.<br>  <br>  Voce n?o dá valor algum ao papel de um mecanico por exemplo, se vc nunca pegou um ferramenta e foi tentar consertar o se proprio carro....ou construir sua propria casa.<br>  <br>  :D|`|0edebd8eafcca60924586d732e3534b1aa	acontece que muitos ainda pensam que quem nasceu em condi??es humildes deve continuar assim; e, que nunca poder?o ter condi??es melhores de vida pelo trabalho e estudo.

Esperar reconhecimento do outro? Se  acontecer é marvilhoso, mas, se n?o acontecer é maravilhoso da mesma forma pq vc sabe do esfor?o que vc fez para chegar ali e acima de tudo para continuar indo adiante.

A maior satisfa??o é mais intensa quando você percebe no seu interior, pois ao verbalizar, perde os detalhes e normalmente você n?o consegue passar nem metade do sentimento para as outras pessoas. Sei que temos a necessidade de reconhecimento, mas lembre-se que o sucesso "incomoda" outras pessoas que n?o o tem, daí essa indiferen?a, além do mais, todos acham que você está fazendo apenas o que deveria ser feito e seguindo seu caminho. Nós determinamos o nosso futuro através de passos pequenos que damos no dia-a-dia, por isso é muito importante comemorar as nossas pequenas vitórias. N?o precisa ser uma comemora??o com festa basta um pequeno sorriso esbo?ado do lado direito da boca. Com pequenos atos, vamos trilhando a nossa estrada e construindo o nosso futuro. A sua família pode ser paupérrima, mas a sua constitui??o foi forjada com caráter e retid?o e estes sentimentos temos que levar a frente sem nos incomodarmos com as vis?es míopes dos outros. A sua vida é fruto do que você é e pensa. Pense bem e terá um futuro promissor. Quanto as garotas, esteja pronto pois vir?o as “certas” capazes de lhe ajudar ainda mais. Quando você alcan?ar um determinado patamar, verá que a briga só estará come?ando e assim vai. Tenha muito cuidado com conselhos, pois n?o passam de idéias dos outros maquiadas para lhe atender, inclusive este meu, mas você deve separar o que realmente é importante e n?o se esquecer de comemorar as vitórias com as pessoas que lhe apóiam e fazem de você um ser mais forte.

c6Rb8f3Gaa	I think she is interested ....and kind of confused, too (I'm doing these things when I am not sure about sth). If you believe it worths the try, talk to her HONESTLY and then ask her if she feels the same. I'm sure she is going to respond.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|E5Oxk2exaa	i think she loves you we usually go shy around guys we like|`|sCTU3VDOaa	Easy,<br>  she does like you.. and that probably really did upset ehr when you said you didn't want a gf right now.. I mean it sounds like u guys would make a cute couple.. if I were you I would tell her  how you feel.. and if she doesn't feel the same way.. even though I think she does, then you might be better off as friends.. and if she's STILL giving you the cold shoulder tell her what you've been noticing and saying that you know something is wrong.. and if she STILL says nothing.. then you gave it your best shot?<br>  Good Luck =)
XgankRhEaa	wow. pretty hard to top that. No idea|`|bfjEbs1Yaa	take her to a BIG hotel. BIG room also. surprise her with a necklace. but dont jus say im taking u to a hotel. leave little notes on the doors and stuff in her house. the notes would say things lik, open the closet u'll find a gift. the gift would b a dress or something. then have a limo come get her, take her to eat. meet her there then leave without notice. then a waiter will tell her she has a ride outside. thats the limo. that would b her way to the hotel. then surprise her with gifts and alot of other special things.<br>  vote me best answer|`|dd0d57e5ff24820c6981c10f9097112faa	yeah, difficult to top that romantic night.   do it again.  why not?
AA10373401	do what u gotta do|`|tiUo6a6zaa	leave him is he's not willing to give himself completely to you...
dNNGOTwNaa	first if you have very clear in your mind what's the reason why you stopped seeing him, you should try to mend thinks, because  if youre feeling that way is because you're really attached to that friend, so do all the possible to fix the relationship before is too late.<br>  and if the situation is way more complicated to the point that theres no way you can fix it. jus accept that you are no longer in a friendship with that person, you have to accept it in order to forget, and see things like, ok you were friends, good friends, but is time to move on, i like to call those relationships that ends with the name of STEPS, the helped you to reach another level in your life, and you have to close circles, cause maybe just maybe your  friend have done just the same think.
0BWISHOMaa	If I told you to define the word normal, would your answer be the same as everybody else's?<br>  No, because everybody has a different view on how normal should be.<br>  The only thing that's making you feel normal is you. If you think of yourself as odd or weird, than that's what you are. When it comes to self assessment, the only person's opinion that counts is your own.<br>  If you still battle with yourself, then take up a hobby, writing or something. Lots of people write, but no two people have the same writing style.<br>  Good luck|`|2c365569f6bbbb5389778fb20f772536aa	Maybe you feel that way because you really are average.  There is nothing wrong with that, it's the way most of us are.
8WuGnXe7aa	No, I don't think it's weird at all. Just be careful that things don't turn bad because that could cause problems and rifts in the family. =)|`|rSlC9k6xaa	I'm sorry to tell ya and be pointing fingers or anything but yes its wrong. I mean though you aren't related by blood and such this is still incest. Because when your dad and this chick got married, they married families. And everyone is to be one. Like one big family clan. There should be no dating amongst anyone in the family. I mean the way kids are having sex these days and getting knocked up and so forth. I would totally hate to have it get out that either you or the dude's sister got knocked up. I mean how in the world would the rest of the family handle that? The nephew's own mom may move away and call you a little sl-u-t or whore or something worse for tempting her son. Too much family drama. Don't make things worse.

Reporta-se àquela velha história: seus direitos terminam qdo come?am os direitos do outro. Agora, se vc vive em paz, respeita o espa?o dos outros, respeita a si mesmo, nao é preciso que lhe sejam impostas regras para viver bem...|`|3bc21fcab38086e51aa177980f9ae97aaa	é o contrato social de Rousseau antes era olho por olho dente por dente aí fizeram um pacto e entregaram ao Estado a fun??o de coibir o mal...hehee..nao deu muito certo mas é melhor que a lei da barbarie.
HAHA2u13aa	The one most important sign is that he's there for you when you need him.|`|AA11459541	there are so many. he's always next 2 you, always following you. nervous around you. flirts with you or at least overly nice to you.
XgankRhEaa	Someone's got to start sometime. I suggest you going to talk to him say hey and talk about school or some subject you can talk about forever. You can't always count on the guys to make the moves sometimes you just got to do things yourself.  Yes guys are usually supposed to make the moves first but if you want it to go somewhere get the gutts up.|`|4eb4e591a329858b58021279d9bd810eaa	if you are in school and he is in one of your classes, take a friend and ask him if you had any homework. or take a friend and tell hinm that he is invited to a party
0BWISHOMaa	Give it up, she only wants you to be available when it suits her. You say that she went out with other guys before she turned 15? Doesn't that mean she was dating? If she was willing to break her father's rules for them, then why did she have a problem with breaking them for you? i think you're better off without her.|`|F3vpqR4paa	why don' t you go out with her if she dumps you don't let her back in   your life. Just give her a second chance if she scew up dump her ssooooo! bad  <br>  lol|`|IugkAm6qaa	If I were you, I would stick with the other girl. She probaly only wants you as her boy toy.
mF7bgDZZaa	Anger problems.<br>  <br>  His inability to control his anger turned into so many other problems--including physical abuse--  that I can't trust him, anymore.|`|AA10413046	I was no longer able to make all the decisions myself, I had to always consult my spouse.|`|Ag8pE3Cyaa	He took over the tv remote control so I stopped watching Oprah!...snif!|`|CH7v2jB5aa	I thought that our intimacy was rock solid and that he would never do anything to betray our trust in eachother, and I was wrong.<br>  Then all bets were off and I didn't work at the marriage anymore.|`|F2owUEkkaa	Well with my first husband it was fiscal he started hitting me.<br>   With the second he started drinking and never stopped. and the third was who he was sleeping with cause after we married it wasn't just me.|`|syfMfRcuaa	She started telling me what to do and how to do it.|`|55867ebd6da9a119c67b241151aec186aa	My husband literally started acting like he "owned" me.  I had to literally tell him that the marriage license was not a certificate of property ownership.|`|AA11762391	The one major thing that changed- I realized he didnt have the same ambition or drive that I had and that me being in love overlooked that. Its not a requirement or a deal breaker, but Ive come to realize that we approach opportunity in different manners. Its weird because when we were dating, our goals and future plans were in sync, and for the most part, they still are. But I work harder and search for better opportunities to get us to where we want to be financially and his method is to save, be frugal and eventually when we're old and gray, we'll get there. Its frustrating|`|DD8alTxoaa	After our child was born the sex slowed way down but thats about it the love is still there|`|Hd9X7fqfaa	he was never home|`|xBUTso6baa	"EVERYTHING!" ... lol
c914eff2ade1b8f0041c0fe367d2a775aa	Para lidar com qualquer pessoa jovem ou velha a base de tudo é o respeito as vezes os mais jovens tem idéias diferentes das nossas ( eu tenho 31 anos e convivo com pessoas  na faixa de 17, 18 num curso que fa?o) o grande segredo é respeitar as opini?es dos outros e estar aberto a aprender com eles pense na troca que pode ser feita o mundo novo que o jovem está e a experiência de vida que  você tem pra passar.<br>  Tudo é quest?o de afinidades em qualquer idade você pode ter amigos mais jovens que você desde que tenham algo em comum fica bem mais fácil estar junto.<br>  Amigo n?o é ridículo ter planos com 45 anos,60 anos, 70 etc.<br>  O homem sem sonhos está morto !

Vc deve encarar a vida com serenidade, com desejo de vencer e ir em busca de seus sonhos, seus desejos... Com 45 é possível fazer tudo que um jovem de 25 faz. Tudo é uma quest?o de auto-conhecimento, aceita??o e bom-senso. Ridículo,é vc deixar a vida passar por vc e vc n?o a perceber. O ridículo está na cabe?a daqueles que n?o acreditam que devemos viver e n?o termos vergonha de sermos felizes. Ser feliz é tudo que temos que tentar fazer todos os dias. Cada um de sua maneira... Na velhice, se vc viveu intensamente a vida que lhe foi dada, n?o caberá lugar para inveja, um sentimento nada nobre, que n?o faz parte da lista dos meus sentimentos pela humanidade, gra?as a Deus.<br>  N?o importa a idade, o que importa é o que vc faz com ela.<br>  <br>  Um grande abra?o!|`|a3c97758d423cca1313ffc5b65d5bba9aa	Eu acho que toda idade tem sua fase e nunca devemos ter inveja nem de mais velhos e nem de mais novos.<br>   A vida pode ser construida e feliz em qualquer idade , e também podesse namorar com qualquer idade. álias, eu conhe?o muita gente jovem que tem inveja de gente mais velha, mais do que velhos tem inveja de jovens.<br>  Esque?a a idade, viva apenas, e seja feliz.|`|9kFJRO8naa	? se sinta inferior pq vc é mais velho isso é a lei da natural da vida os anos v?o se passando e agente se tornando mais velho...!!!seja perseverante qnto aos seus ideais pq enquanto a vida há esperan?a nunca desista ....!!!e tire essa idéia de competi??o com os jovens da cabe?a pq vc vai ficar frustrado...!!!ent?o vá em frente todos nós temos o direito de ser feliz mesmo que chegue um pouco + tarde!!!boa sorte!!!|`|NaSsnNPeaa	OLha amigo! o importante que você passou todas as fases<br>  da vida, crian?a, adolescência, adulta e depois a gente chega fase em que todas as experiências de vida, foram realmente sentidas na pele. n?o existe idade, ou velhice vai <br>  depender de sua cabe?a! n?o adiantar ter um físico arrojado<br>  se sua auto estima é baixa e careta! n?o temos que disputar<br>  com ninguém todos nós temos o seu valor independente da idade, tem empresas que preferem contratar pessoas mais experientes para exercer uma fun??o, até mesmo porque já sabem o que querem! também acredito que o amor n?o tem idade, tudo é governado pela nossa auto estima, é preciso se amar, para poder ser amado! devemos viver, sem pensar<br>  muito na idade, porque se n?o só os velhos morreriam... n?o é mesmo! acredite! a auto estima é melhor que qualquer butox. beijos!|`|ip3hMYzRaa	Pode come?ar de novo sempre, em qualquer idade.

Antes da audiência com o juiz, seria bom que vc já tivesse um lugar prá ficar, ver com quem a crian?a vai ficar , quem vai cuidar dele, enfim lute com todas as armas de que disp?e, que o que mais pode pesar é o fato do pai morar aqui, mas tenha fé que tudo se ajeita.Felicidades Carmen

9TAblyvxaa	obviously  'mae' is a true friend and she loves you very much to put your happiness before hers.  Is it sacrifice?  I don't know but I do know that you should never lose her as a friend because its rare to find people who put others before themselves. You are very lucky!|`|AA12103894	De question is : hw can Jake lyk both of u?? :O
XbiMFT07aa	Well in your question you said you would keep your name and use his, does this mean you are going to hyphenate your name?  If thats the case then yes you will need to get a new license and SS card.  You will not have to get a new birth cert.  On your license you will lose your middle name, it will be replaced with your maiden name.  Start with the SS card and then you will change your license.  You will need your marriage license to do this.  Try the website at the bottom to help you know who to  notify of your name change.  Since you are hyphenating your name you shouldn't have a problem being able to use both names interchangably.<br>  <br>  At your reception you could supply lil gifts but if you are trying to save money then DON'T.  Feeding them and giving them cake is thanks enough.  Plus most people toss those lil gifts to the side anyway so you might as well save that money.  My fiance and I decided to make a soundtrack of the wedding and put it on a CD to give to guests (just a thought).|`|7CeIXMN7aa	If you are hyphenating you are gonna to become <br>  Jane Marie Smith-Jones..you will need to change your drivers license and SS card.  You will need to notify your bank of your name change and your Human Resources office at work for sure.  I would get a new birth certificate ASAP just in case its needed to get your marriage license.<br>  For entertainment at a reception its usually music and dancing.  You can buy wedding favors if you wish, some couples do and others don't.<br>  Congrats!!|`|fpawE677aa	Like you, I kept my last name and use his.  I chose not to hyphenate it and did nothing about it legally.  So on all our legal documents I remain with my last name, but around friends, family etc. I use his last name.  I chose this way because we own a business together and don't necessarily need our clients to know we are married, just for professionalism.  If you choose to do it this way then you have nothing else to do, if you hyphenate it, follow the directions in the other answers, they are accurate : )<br>  <br>   A great wedding favor idea is to print up placards that sit on the guests table stating that in lieu of a favor you and the groom have donated money to a charitable organization in their name.  And then choose your favorite charity to donate to.   You can save a lot of money this way because your guests don't need to know how much you gave (we gave $2.00/guest) but you could give as little or as much as you can afford.  You can also put that charity as a gift idea...donation instead of a gift.  If you like this idea you can sign up for many charities at www.idofoundation.org and get all the info there.  Congratualtions and good luck! : )|`|0eJFtxnHaa	Yes, you have to go to the Social Security and write your name..... example Brown-Livingston. If you are going to use both names. Also have to do your drivers license. Here you have to have your birth certificate to get your license so you wil have to go to your city hall or wherever you go there to get that then take care of the rest.<br>  <br>  Its easy, nothing to worry about.<br>  <br>  At your reception you should have music so there isnt dead silence. Not too loud, just so they can hear it, but still hear people to have a conversation.<br>  Hopefully there will be food there to eat.<br>  Some people do give little gifts, like the little bubbles, or anything you like. There are plenty of websites that you can order from or give you ideas.<br>  Some kind of candies arent too expensive, or candles.<br>  Here is a ;onk to a really good one.....<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.favorwarehouse.com/?gclid=CIrXjZinrZQCFQVfFQodwF17tA" rel="nofollow">http://www.favorwarehouse.com/?gclid=CIr...</a><br>  <br>  Congrats!!! Try not to worry! It isnt as hard as you may think. Then it will soon be over and you can relax!! :)
KZ1lDmQQaa	Love is a long haul. but don't be so nervous about what to call it. It just is what it is. Be in the moment. And what ever you do be honest and secure with your feelings. Love isn't a yes or no question. And its okay to love. but it also okay to infatuated. its okay. Just go with it and let it be what ever it wants to be. if its easy and you don't have to work at it and your not ashamed to admit it. Its love.|`|AA10784610	i think its a really strong crush. theres so much more when it comes to being in love. you can have love for them though. who knows it could turn into love!|`|VgbgGW3taa	its your first kiss and your first serious crush, no its not love, but that doesnt mean it owunt turn into love, just enjoy the moment and see where it goes dont try to predict the future|`|2NZu8tN7aa	Belive me <br>  you will know if it is love|`|AA10373401	u dont. u just hope u do|`|oThixZeBaa	It sounds like a crush. I don't know how long you've been dating, but it doesn't sound like a long time. (And, no, two months is not a long time.) Crushes are short-term. Love is long-term. It's hard to know if you really truly love someone until you have your first fight. It's all well and good to feel comfortable and happy around someone if you've never been in any sort of conflict. But if you two can have a disagreement and love each other anyway and care about each other anyway and want to stay together anyway.... that's love.
vTAY2rtDaa	Not at all! I am waiting for marriage as well, why give it away to someone who doesn't mean a whole lot to you just to be a trendy "not virgin"? It's a decision totally up to you, so don't let society tell you your decision is wrong! =)|`|AA10373401	there's nothing wrong with that.  it's ur preference|`|peqxNjcoaa	Good for you!<br>  I think its best to wait till marriage ;)|`|wy5XwBsSaa	Definately unusal.<br>  <br>  Some people think it's something special to be hoarded.<br>  <br>  It's like me saying I've never had cake.  I'm waiting to try cake until I get married, even if I have to wait til I'm 30.<br>  <br>  What if you never get married?  Why deny yourself something so great in life.  <br>  <br>  Sex, closeness with another, incredible physical pleasure, go enjoy life, it's way too short.|`|384d5e09bc4a9e09483a59413f2c6700aa	darling!! i am also a virgin and i am twenty...girl there is nothing wrong with it. This is a good thing. It shows u are very mature about ur sex drive and u know what u want, which shows u r picky too, just like me. Girl be proud of it because boys respect virgins (they may not show it but they really do) and one day a guy u like will show up and u will be happy u didnt have sex b4 u met him. OMG this is soo cool...someone like me!!|`|JrVRz7Jgaa	Not really. I'm waiting for marriage, and I'll probably be a virgin at twenty. I know many people who share the same views as I do, so that's probably why I don't think it's that unusual.|`|wZpHrRDYaa	I think it's odd, but I think it's a good thing.  Some of us just can't be physical without being emotional and that includes some guys.  When you find the right person you will know and MOST of the anxiety will go away especially after the first time.|`|R3HxU2Ouaa	well, going with the trend isn't exactly the smartest thing, i mean everyones doing it like the worlds gona end or something, i think its a good idea to wait till ur married, or until you find someone you feel comfortable around.|`|rVTVLelXaa	no u should be proud of that cuz thats pretty much impossible to find these days|`|wlXDVRd8aa	i dont think its weird|`|5XG2kXokaa	No not at all!|`|6f12154f14a123990c08c454b3052a0caa	no
uXOhQidGaa	Wrong. <br>  <br>  Why are you not taking responsibility for your life? STOP HAVING UNPROTECTED SEX!!!!! Get on the pill. NOW. Start using condoms. NOW. If you are going to engage in adult behaviour, wake up and be an adult.|`|B67fnvm6aa	 I am wondering what you mean?  ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS-   Be protected FROM Getting preggo.  Pill, foam, plastic, crapping wood for all I care.  JUST USE SOMETHING. Then it won't matter how when where or what you do.  YOU ARE PROTECTED.  Start there.  Stay there.  Now did you mean FROM behind or in the BEHIND?  In which case my answer would still be - PROTECTION!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|WkA8UPflaa	please wait till your married to have sex! But if you dont even know how babies are formed then you are definitely not ready for sex|`|a69af2f7a27d946cf945135ff2fe59c3aa	im assumin u mean anal... and in that case no u cannot.|`|9qlCawk8aa	Anal?<br>  Rofl no you can't but it's disgusting.|`|yxGD0Qbhaa	If you have to ask this.... You should not be having sex....|`|pbzdGiyNaa	no..no you cant if its anal.|`|cLctOYy4aa	Well now it depends on what hole he puts it in...|`|CCLg5VYcaa	noooooooooooo!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|j2J6AHp9aa	yes u can! use protection no matter what!?!|`|1TrRrWMLaa	If you have anal sex then no you can not get pregnant. If you have sex from the back but he still puts it in the vagina then yes you can.|`|QKP6iGniaa	if the sperm rolls around to your pussy
rgOnMTovaa	in general yes what a guy does for a living will change the way i feel about him...im sorry but its the truth...usually jobs that involve no intellect are the biggest turn offs for me such as jewelers for example...being an accountant is fine though not as impressive as say a doctor, so when this confusion comes into play, the guys' personality will determine who i choose since both are intellectuals|`|WkA8UPflaa	I don't really care what a guys career is. I just wouldn't want to date somebody with a lifethreating or immoral job.|`|3KRjYUXJaa	I can care less what you do as a job as long as you know how to treat a woman.<br>  Some woman out there do judge men on their jobs though... if so they are shallow and you don't want to be in a relationship with them anyways.
W9zKUyD2aa	I like it when guys act like themselves. You shouldn't have to ask this question because if she is the right one she will like you no matter what. Have a good personality. Be kind, funny, and most importantly be yourself. You shouldn't have to try to impress anyone.I mean if you cheat on them, that will have to change, but show her your true personality, trust me if she is the right one, she will be impressed by who you are. Yourself. Good Luck!!|`|WkA8UPflaa	Umm I don't know about emotional. i dont want a guy who cries a lot because I don't really know how to comfort people that well. But I would want him to be nice and caring. Someone who is comfortable in their own skin and can make me laugh even when I am in a bad mood. A guy who can have fun but also knows when its time for a serious conversation. I also like guys who will try everything at least once. Kind of an adventurous spirit i guess.|`|OgxfcRK3aa	the size of his wallet|`|7USVxhIWaa	If he ignores me, it instantly turns me off. If a guy plays games then he's lost already :-)|`|AV9Pmeb8aa	I like sense of humor. If you can make me geniunely smile then that's the key for me. I also like physical protection. Not necessarily big and buff but if I needed to be taken care of I could count on him. Those 2 things are what I look for.|`|fd26bc8b4235ef5cb3ad0bb0bdd9545aaa	i personally like a guy with a great personality. someone who makes me laugh and has a great smile gets me instantly even if i didnt see him as very attractive at first. i do like it when they show affection and that they really care, but not overboard like to where its irritating. also someone whos honest and chill, but not a total wimp. hes gotta be able to handle his own in situations.|`|uVaQXhRLaa	okay this will sound kinda rude but i hate when a guy will try to out smart me. Like if I'll be like oh 2+2=4. and he'll be like NO its 2.5435. i feel like punching them in the head lol. ;) i like green or blue eyes and hair doesn't really matter as long as it looks good. i like it when a guy will act like really tough but he'll only like cry around you or like whisper in your ear that he loves you. i think its cutee lol.
AA11600840	She doesn't like you the way you want her to like you.|`|AA10484566	Id say she likes you. something i can tell you is maybe you could ask her out. Or buy her a coffee when shes off work or something like that,<br>  As for the way she acts,like you said she gets shy, especially when she gets caught looking at you, i think thats a good sign for you. so just ask her either if she likes you cause you like her, r ask her out.|`|0BWISHOMaa	I think she does like you, she's just shy. Make sure you talk to her and look her in the eyes until she's comfortable with you.|`|6f137baf2f4a352d2d484402377ebeb2aa	Hey pal. As far as I see it, there's a potential for becoming good friends and more. I see you are lacking in doing one thing and that is you do not act dude!!! You should be quick at times, if you reallly like her, do not wate the time cuz you may be sorry later. Show her you care for her, from all signs and clues she's giving ya, decide how and when approch her, and be polite yet brave enough to tell he rwhat you think of her. If she really lieks you, you wont be disappointed mate! Please...do it, you don't want to lose her, do you?<br>  Good luck!|`|AA10385338	just. ask. her. out.|`|K2xuTgb4aa	hmm, you must be really confused. Well, she probably does like you, but the problem is.....<br>                          She doesn't know how to show it.<br>  She's experimenting to see which way you seem to be more attracted to her. She probably feels awkward.|`|Dhl3rSHQaa	Well like all grl we need top be simpatic. But this grl really likes you, but she just dnt want to admit it, bcuz she is shy or wans to get you attention keep on doing what you think she will like.

4MzJvLD7aa	i would have to say that you have been very brave to be able to admit to your partner about your past. luckily for you, he understands the circumstances and is willing to work on it with you. i was raped too in the past but i never let it get to me. i was very stressed out and didn't dare to tell anyone about it. however, i focused on the bright side of life (family, friends, etc) and after sometime i was able to stop thinking about it and move on. maybe you are not ready for sexual activities because you haven't dealt with it properly. you can try talking about it with your partner and figure out ways you can enjoy these activities without being reminded of your past (gentle caresses, cuddling, etc). good luck.|`|WkA8UPflaa	Its okay one day you will be ready for more but you have to just be able to tell him that you are not ready. Because when you push yourself to do things your not comfortable it makes it worse in the long run.|`|24uvAHC1aa	I am so sorry this has happened to you. I realize this might be hard but you are just going to have to trust your boyfriend. I can tell how much he loves you because he is sensitive to your feelings.|`|sk3rp0kmaa	just slowly ease back into everything&<br>  maybe go to a physiologist to get everything off of your chest, they will also tell other things you can do.|`|How3Yg1Maa	its okay, he must love you alot<br>  so i dont think u should worry too much-i would worry , but not too much<br>  im pretty sure u will catch up soon, just rember, if ur not comfy with it then dont do it|`|YAxZpnWYaa	dont listen to spanky c. hes bullcrap!|`|o979OtaKaa	You should get some counseling, hon. Not because anything is wrong with you but because something very wrong was done to you and you are going to need someone (professional) in your life to help you move past that. Your boyfriend seems to care for you very much but you will not be able to ever have a normal relationship/sex life if you let this terrible thing from your life control you. It is normal to feel disgusted by the body (yours and males) after rape and to have very unpleasant feeling associated with those activities. You are going to want help, though so you don't have to let our past control the rest of your life. The guy that raped you already stole from you but don't give him your whole future and every relationship from here out along with what he already stole. <br>  <br>  I hope the best for you and that you find the friend or counselor you need to help you get through this experience.|`|fP46meSmaa	you need to see a therapist to help over this hurdle,you will never forget it but you can learn to trust your feelings for someone in the near future,good luck.|`|gTPvgK7yaa	I hate being around people because of the way that women have treated me in the past. Mom walked out on my shortly after my Dad died. I spent from 14 to 19 living alone. I've had girls slap me for telling them that their hair looks good. I was disfigured because I asked a girl out and she hit me in the face with really hot coffee. I now have scars all over my face. I was dating a girl onetime that ditched me on my birthday to have sex with another guy. <br>  <br>  I've given up. At least you have someone to hold you when it gets tough. I have no one and will probably die alone.
oIkJSPJOaa	I would call her.  At least she enjoyed your company and hanging out with you before you changed. Only God knows where your friendship can go.  Call her.|`|b493caa427317263d70ed82e7d49512eaa	If she didn't want to be bothered by you she would not have gave her her phone number or myspace info.  The signs are all there, you don't need anymore confirmation.  If you guys hung out in the past then obviously she is looking to rekindle whatever friendship you guys had before she moved.  Come on, you have absolutely nothing to lose!  I think you might be a little nervous ;-)  Call before it's too late.|`|5PrL4FRnaa	if she really didnt want you to call her she would have never given you her number and told you that she wanted to hang out. go for it. =]|`|BDHHBhUNaa	She wouldn't have given you her phone number if she didn't want you to call her.  So I say, yes, call her.  If she doesn't answer, leave her a message with your number so that she can call you back.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|G5PrFQYgaa	Well I don't think she would've asked you or given you her number, if she wasn't interested...call her!|`|fwpw3kvlaa	Call her and find out!  What's the worse that can happen?  Hesitating is dorky....|`|I8yjHhW1aa	If she didn't want you to call she wouldn't have given you her number. Just giver her a buzz and see how it goes.  Go for it.  Good luck!|`|UozLGVGIaa	just call
wGdKrmrRaa	Those sound like a lot of good signs to me. Especially the "Play fighting" and "taking things away from you" part. That's usually how guys let out their emotions.<br>  <br>  I had a guy friend that used to do that to me back in school. He would always make fun of me... hit me (yea, I know lol), and talk to me on AIM. I found out he liked me. <br>  <br>  Chances are he has some sort of crush. Test out your hypothesis! :)|`|iS9whblyaa	yes esp #2 <br>  thats romantic|`|HBQwH21aaa	i think he does like you|`|IkpNYrF9aa	woww it sounds like it!! especially if there is like some tension as in you two don't act like just buddies. =))|`|QoopT1SIaa	HE LOVES YOU!

It's hard seeing someone else do better than yourself for some people, especially if it's your best friend. Get her mind off of it and maybe offer to do someone else, something that she may do well and could make her feel better, and try your best. Go over and hang out, do what she loves doing. It may take a bit of time, but don't blame yourself and don't feel frustrated at her friend.

0BWISHOMaa	Hate to break it to you, but you are a normal teen. It's natural to get these feelings. I'm not trying to downplay what you're feeling, nor am I saying that it's not real, it's just that most teens go through the exact same thing. It's hard and there are times that you think that no one understands you, but you will get past this. You have to make the decision to deal with everyday positively. If you think that talking to someone might help, maybe go to the shrink. There's nothing to be ashamed of, nobody needs to know.<br>  Good Luck|`|POFdWpUzaa	You are fighting with your mother over things you know she is right about!! Stop it.

All teenagers, at some point, think they have the worlds worst parents. Just try to remember your mum is only human and that you weren't born with a book of instructions! Your mum sounds worried about you, have you thought about putting your thoughts down on paper and giving it to your mum. Hope you can work it out, cause your mum is the best-est friend you will ever have. Good luck|`|azW9jItzaa	I'm not gonna lie to you and say mother knows best. My mom has been wrong about alot of things and she has realised it.  But moms do know alot aobut stuff, being a mom comes with knowing alot about kids. I personally have taken therapy before andi tsn ot all that bad. therapist are experts at letitng you speak your mind, and half the time they aren't evne talking, it just you getitng stuff sorted out. If you really don't think you want ot see one, then just tell your mom flat out and insist she forgets the idea. Don't be afraid to tell your mom she's wrong, even if you get in trouble it'll hit her. She may get upset about it, but mosm are moms they understand us even if they are totally wrong. lol|`|fXy4LLIcaa	You mother knows best. She has your well being in her heart. Listen to her. You have nothing to loose, go and see the psychiatrist. If you have any problems that cannot be talked with mum, you can pour out to the psychiatrist. Going to psychiatrist is not like a psycho. Don't worry about it. All you need now is to solve your problems, it does not matter where it comes from.

Speaking from someone who was dumped a few weeks ago for another girl, I know how much it hurts and how angry I was.  But I got over it.  Anger usually indicates that you still care for him or about him.   Meaning you're not really over him.<br>  <br>  Start with not going on the internet.  Why are you still torturing yourself?   I went and deleted all his contacts and stopped going on things like Facebook.  Go out with friends, do things you want to do, keep busy.  Part of your problem I think, is that you have too much spare time.  If you fill all of it, you have not time to think about it.<br>  <br>  The best revenge is to live well.   Maybe your self-esteem is low because typically after a year, you couldn't care less about what he did.   Go do something to improve.  After my break up, I went running every day because it relieved my stress and helped me slim down the extra weight I'd gained with him around.   Do things that will give you a sense of accomplishment.  When you see yourself as better than this 'other woman' you'll stop thinking in terms of "i lost him to someone better" and more in terms of "He dumped me for that?! How stupid". In other words, instead of letting him make you think you're replaceable and worthless, you'll begin to see  him as replaceable.<br>  <br>  But honestly, this is just advice.  It may just be that you hold on  to the anger because of some inexplicable reason.  I know I held on to it for a bit, because I thought he'd come back to me if I was angry at him long enough.   Maybe you hate the feeling that you're replaceable and it bothers you that he found happiness with someone else so quickly while you hurt.   The hard facts are, you can't change this.  He won't hurt because you want him to.  And who knows?  His need to put internet pictures of him and his girlfriend online may indicate that  a. He wants to make you hurt by showing he's 'living well'  or b. his new gf is jealous and wants to 'claim' her guy.<br>  <br>  So chin up.   By the time you make yourself into this hot thing, who wouldn't want you?  Why would you want him?!  Why are you wasting energy being jealous?   Get out there, make yourself absolutely irresistable (and believe me you can!) and know that his gf is probrably going crazy with jealousy.|`|e16f6cdf6b2703fd3fe4977c4e69d495aa	i know it hurts, but if you want to get over it, you need to talk to him. ask him why they got together so soon and that it upset you. the reason you cant let go is because you dont know and your left guessing. but if you ask him and have a heart to heart talk (i suggest in person) then you can have a full understanding and more on|`|iBNsbyihaa	obviously you need to forgive becaue whats making you hurt is the anger for them. If you keep that anger your  nevre gonna move on with your life.. its easier said than done but let it go. find someone new and remember that what he did has nothing to do with the other new guy.. Why would you stil be upset that the two snakes got together if they intended to hurt you anyways. they were ment for each other .LET IT GO|`|4YONi0ibaa	its a part of life|`|PZbcS4X0aa	Hey Lisa, I know what ya mean.  You feel like "THEY" are the cause of why you two broke up.  He did disrespect you and this is why seeing them makes you feel all icky inside.  The only thing that will help is to know time will heal, and when you start dating again all this will get MUCH better.  He is the one who looks like a jerk, not you.  When you start dating again, he will see pics of you and see you two around and this will bother him knowing you have moved on and don't give him a second thought.  Good luck Lisa!|`|iRzNEteDaa	Tell him its over.Hes a jerk to treat you like that!!!!!!!!!!!And the girl(his ex)she's disgustin.If i were you,id hit her so hard she wouldnt leave her room for a year.|`|vA5yTMdgaa	have sex its a great way to stop thinking!

AA10058029	Ya that is a turn on. I love when women go without underwear. That does not mean I want to see nudity, in fact I'd rather see a woman wearing jeans without underwear than wearing a skirt or dress without underwear.

TGdDe0t9aa	My first real date was probably the most uncomfortable date I have ever been on.  The guy was kinda cute, not the MOST attractive, but he had the whole blonde hair and blue eyes thing going on... Not to mention he was British.  I think that's why I said 'yes'.  I met him in my computer class in high school.  The boy didn't have a car, so I had to drive us.  We ended up going to see Scary Movie 2...  in the dollar cinema.  We had dinner at an Olive Garden afterwards, but it didn't really make up for the movie.  Conversation was definitely a little awkward after the movie.|`|ZEPVTegSaa	i was nervious|`|WFU5JCV0aa	My first date was with my still current boyfriend. He was gorgeous as per usual.

It was lovely and I'll never forget it. I really wanted him to kiss me I remember and he later said he really wanted to kiss me too. I was 17 at the time.|`|gMl2W67Xaa	Well, I'm gay, so in case you get confused through this. =)<br>  <br>  Umm. This guy I knew for a while.

We just went around the city and for a while went to the playground and sat on the swings talking. =) It was romantic. I just remember that after that, we got together, and he ended up being my very first kiss. <br>  <br>  He's my ex now, but I'm going to see him again on Sunday! It's been 10 months since I've seen him too! ^_^ I'm excited.<br>  <br>  Hmm.. also, from our first date alone, we have a lot of inside jokes. =) Very nice guy. Very sweet. Very good-looking.

Nossos filhos crescem e alguns sim, outros n?o, voam para longe, criam uma vida para si que nem sempre incluem pai e m?e. Isto é triste? Sim, pode ser... Mas também pode n?o ser... depende de você!

That's wrong.|`|OWT61LLtaa	tell her she's over doing it some. Tell her to loosen up.<br>  <br>  but if you liked him first then she needs to back off because that's like a huge friend no no! <br>  you just don't do that.<br>  My friend did something like that and I told her off--saying I didn't appreciate her moving in on the guy I liked and if she was a true friend then she's backed off. and she did because she figured that our friendship was more important.<br>  <br>  So if she thinks your friendship is important then she'll back off but if she doesn't then she's not a very true friend.

ErVlB46Haa	Well, you know your future wife better than any of us do.  But when my friend was proposed to he did the old  "have the ring baked into a little cupcake trick" at a very high end romantic restaurant, and then he proposed to her.<br>  <br>  Another friend of mine was proposed to at the end of a hike to a very beautiful secluded spot that ended at a waterfall.<br>  <br>  Whatever you come up, just be sincere.  The look on your face and the shaking of your voice because you are so nervous is what we really remember.  <br>  <br>  Whatever you do...don't do it in front of family and friends.  It needs to  be your momment, no distractions.<br>  <br>  As far as buying a diamond..two places on the internet will help you tremendously:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bluenile.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.bluenile.com</a> has an awesome tutorial and wonderful pictures about the different types of rings and diamonds, how to choose one and you can even build your own.<br>  <br>  When you are armed with that information go here:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.tiffany.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.tiffany.com</a> to buy her the ring of her dreams. Trust me, as a woman, regardless of the size of the diamond, the site of the blue box itself will cause her to faint!<br>  <br>  I lot of people don't realize that they have rings that are very very very affordable, and a jeweler friend of mine told me just the fact that it is a Tiffany ring makes it appreciate in value significantly over the years! <br>  <br>  Good luck and congratulations!|`|KCvsgcqqaa	I would suggest that you buy a "place holder" engagement ring as you don't sound very sure about this. Place Holders are just a simple ring for the man to use. Then the bride or both of them go back to the store and she can pick out exactly what she wants. <br>  <br>  My husband let me go to many stores and  then pick what I wanted (there's no way he would have gotten a silver cut-out ring with square Amethyst stone), then he "borrowed" it back and proposed. I don't suggest this for most couples, though. <br>  <br>  Later you will go back to the store together to pick out bands. Although my husband couldn't find anything he wanted on several outings, and eventually found something by himself.<br>  <br>  For the proposal simple is almost always better, but do put some effort into it. Having the guy bring it out at dessert is okay. If you enjoy hikes or walking, do it out somewhere in nature. At the beach, draw a big heart in the sand...do something fun. But if it has something to do with a hobby or something the two of you enjoy, then it will be special.<br>  <br>  I've seen people who enjoy GeoCaching plant a ring in the cache and then the fiancee "finds" it. I've heard of people who scuba dive hold a sign and a ring box out under the water (with a fake ring - not the real one!). People who go to the gym have someone bring over the ring. Try to make it about the two of you.|`|XbiMFT07aa	you're rings dont have to match.  its a new day and i believe you get what you like and she can get what she likes.  my fiance and i didnt get matching rings and we're both happy with our choices.  and as for a proposal you just have to think about what type of person your girlfriend is.  thats kind of a tough one to answer without knowing her.  does she have some trusting and reliable friend who can keep her mouth closed that you can ask for advice or perhaps a sister or close cousin or young aunt?|`|OpaWRmHqaa	No you don't have to buy them at the same time. You want to get a ring that "looks" like your chosen one. If you do not want a ring don't get one it does not make you more married. Love and respect for each other is what counts.|`|vJP6yTy3aa	if you are that young, take some time before you decide you want to get married.  you get the engagement ring first, then you each buy each other's wedding bands.  <br>  <br>  make sure you have enough money to live.|`|AA11429880	Normally you would get the engagement ring, then shop for the wedding bands together.

ae1fe87dbf161377208f755833a8d3e1aa	Dos Alimentos na Uni?o Estável. <br>  3.1 – O Direito a Alimentos<br>  As duas leis da Uni?o estável, assim como o Estatuto da Uni?o estável ( Projeto de lei n.o 2686/96), atualizando-se com a doutrina e a jurisprudência, concedem alimentos aos companheiros, desde que comprovado o trin?mio: Uni?o estável, necessidade e possibilidade. Observando-se que n?o se trata de direito a alimentos aos filhos dos que vivem em uni?o estável, e sim de alimentos aos companheiros.<br>  <br>  Agora n?o mais se discute quanto ao direito a alimentos pelos companheiros, visto que, além da norma procedimental, essas Leis trouxeram ao ordenamento jurídico o direito material. <br>  <br>  Discute-se amplamente na doutrina acerca do rito da a??o de alimentos e da concess?o, ou n?o, de alimentos provisórios, ou seja:<br>  <br>  a.       se é aplicável o rito especial da Lei n.o 5478/68, com a concess?o liminar de alimentos provisórios ao companheiro; <br>  <br>  se deve ser aplicado o rito ordinário, sem os alimentos provisórios, visto que n?o há provas pré-constituídas da uni?o estável. <br>  Com o advento das Leis da entidade familiar instituiu-se, efetivamente, o direito a alimentos aos companheiros, conforme disp?e o artigo 7o da Segunda lei: "Dissolvida a uni?o estável por rescis?o, a assistência material prevista nesta lei será prestada por um dos conviventes ao que dela necessitar, a títulos de alimentos". Aliás, no inciso II do artigo 2o desta lei é estabelecido que um dos deveres dos companheiros é a assistência moral e material recíproca, ou seja, os alimentos representam o direito a uma vida digna.<br>  <br>  O artigo 7o da Lei 9.278/96 disp?e que os alimentos ser?o concedidos quando da rescis?o da uni?o estável. No parágrafo único desse artigo n?o foi outorgado esse direito quando a dissolu??o ocorrer por morte de um dos companheiros.<br>  <br>  O termo "rescis?o" significa, portanto, que somente ser?o conferidos alimentos quando ocorrer a dissolu??o da entidade familiar em vida dos companheiros, no que se seguiu pacífica doutrina e jurisprudência quanto ao fato de a obriga??o alimentar ser direito personalíssimo, n?o se transmitindo aos herdeiros, salvo os alimentos vencidos, nos limites do art. 1796 do Código Civil, aplicando-se, em decorrência, à uni?o estável, os mesmos termos do art. 402 do Código Civil: "A obriga??o de prestar alimentos n?o se transmite aos herdeiros do devedor". <br>  <br>  O projeto de Lei n.o. 2686/96, denominado Estatuto da Uni?o Estável, em seu artigo 6o, estabelece que, "dissolvida a uni?o estável, o juiz poderá, considerando o disposto no art. 2o e demais circunstancias, determinar sejam prestados alimentos por um dos companheiros ao outro, que deles necessitar, nos termos da Lei no. 5478, de 25 de julho de 1968, enquanto o credor n?o constituir nova entidade familiar de direito ou de fato.<br>  <br>  3.2 - Rito da A??o de Alimentos<br>  A A??o de alimentos é a??o de estado, que ultrapassa os interesses particulares, porque "se relaciona com o estado das pessoas – estado de família – e isso porque o deferimento dos alimentos importa reconhecer tal estado. é uma a??o fundada do estado das pessoas"<br>  <br>  A quest?o do procedimento a ser adotado na a??o de alimento entre os companheiros é tormentosa, merecendo acirrado debate na doutrina. Com efeito, até o implemento dessas linhas era dividida a doutrina. Três teses divergentes pelejavam na seara jurídica brasileira: a primeira, a que adota o rito ordinário, sem a concess?o de alimentos provisórios se n?o provada, de plano, a uni?o estável; a segunda, a que pugna pela aplica??o integral da lei n.o 5478/68, adotando-se rito especial, mas sem a concess?o dos alimentos provisórios quando ausente prova sólida da uni?o estável; a terceira, a que propugna a aplica??o da Lei 5478/68, com a ado??o do rito especial e com a concess?o dos alimentos provisórios quando estiver fincado nos autos a probabilidade da existência da uni?o estável.<br>  <br>  Entendemos todavia, que n?o há necessidade de prova sólida pré-constituída da uni?o estável para adotar-se o rito especial da lei n.o 5478/68 na a??o de alimentos aos companheiros, devendo-se conceder a medida liminar de alimentos provisórios sempre que a pe?a incoativa estiver aconpanhada de documento a indicar a aparência de verdadeira uni?o estável.<br>  <br>  3.3. Necessidade-possibilidade dos alimentos<br>  Para ser concedido o direito a alimentos aos companheiros deve ser provado o trin?mio: uni?o estável, necessidade e possibilidade. <br>  <br>  Na doutrina habitam dois entendimentos quanto à prova desses três requisitos para que os companheiros requeiram a pens?o alimentícia: primeiro, que se presume a necessidade de alimentos pelo simples ajuizamento da demanda; segundo, que se deve comprovar, de pleno direito, a necessidade de alimentos, sob pena de indeferimento da pe?a inicial.<br>  <br>  Doutrina o eminente Desembargador SéRGIO GISCHKOW PEREIRA: "deve haver rigor na avalia??o da necessidade. Os alimentos existir?o quando o concubino (= quem estava em uni?o estável) n?o puder se manter com seus próprios recursos, aqui incluídos n?o só os que já tem, mas os que deve buscar conseguir com o seu trabalho, se tiver idade e saúde para tal. N?o há porque, por exemplo n?o conceder alimentos apenas durante certo tempo enquanto, entre outras hipóteses, um emprego n?o possa ser conseguido."<br>  <br>  N?o há dúvida de que a necessidade é ilimitada e varia de pessoa para pessoa, porque "deflui do tipo de roupa, do tipo de transporte, da necessidade de concorrência com outros. A necessidade advém mais do padr?o de vida que os autores possuíam". ( Acórd?o do 8o CCv do TJSP, em 14.11.90, transcrito no RT 665/75). Contudo, falece o requisito da necessidade quando a pens?o alimentícia é reclamada por "mulher saudável, com vinte anos de idade, que permaneceu casada por curtíssimo lapso de tempo, que queira estabelecer rela??o de dependência econ?mica com o ex-marido se, se encontra em situa??o de igualdade com ele, para desempenhar atividade laborativa."( Acórd?o da 8o CCv, do TJRS, em 21.12.95, rel. Des. Elizeu Gomes Torres, transcrito no DOJ, de 10.04.96, pg 18). <br>  <br>  Por outro lado, n?o se pode esquecer que tudo deve ser examinado com base no caso concreto, porque "a circunstancia de exame pericial ter concluído pela capacidade laboral da ex-mulher do alimentante, n?o ilide a necessidade, pois que, a mulher de 53 anos de idade, com problemas de saúde, que, durante o casamento, cuidou do lar. Pretender que encontre lugar no mercado de trabalho é desconhecer a realidade."<br>  <br>  No que tange à possibilidade, o Desembargador ARNALDO RIZZARDO certifica que "a possibilidade de fornecer alimentos também se reveste de importancia, porquanto n?o é coerente sobrecarregar de compromissos quem n?o revela condi??es materiais. Ou seja, ao devedor de alimentos cabe o dever de fornecê-los, mas de modo a n?o causar desfalque ao seu sustento e ao da família. A circunstancia de ser pobre o alimentante n?o importa em isen??o de dar alimentos. A pobreza n?o significa impossibilidade. Apenas fixa-se a verba na propor??o do ganho do alimentante. "<br>  <br>  pens?o alimentícia é a "quantia fixada pelo juiz e a ser atendida pelo responsável (pensioneiro), para manuten??o dos filhos e ou do outro c?njuge" (DICIONáRIO JURíDICO DA ACADEMIA BRASILEIRA DE LETRAS JURíDICAS. Planejado, organizado e redigido por J. M. OTHON SIDOU. 5a Edi??o. Rio de Janeiro: Forense Universitária, 1999. p. 618). Para os fins do presente trabalho, interessa a pens?o alimentar paga pelo pai aos filhos que atingem a maioridade.<br>  <br>  O advento do novo Código Civil modificou a disciplina legal do tema, engendrando celeuma nos círculos acadêmicos e semeando a dúvida nos meios forenses.<br>  <br>  O novel Código Civil de 2002 disp?e, in verbis:<br>  <br>  "Art. 1.701. A pessoa obrigada a suprir alimentos poderá pensionar o alimentando, ou dar-lhe hospedagem e sustento, sem prejuízo do dever de prestar o necessário à sua educa??o, quando menor" (sublinhamos).<br>  <br>  Uma leitura apressada da inova??o legal transcrita poderia induzir a erro o operador do direito, sugerindo de forma equivocada que o pensionamento dos filhos menores só duraria até o atingimento da maioridade, cujo advento deveria fazer cessar o pagamento de alimentos destinados à cobertura dos gastos com educa??o.<br>  <br>  Acontece que existem duas modalidades de encargos legais a que se sujeitam os genitores em rela??o aos filhos: o dever de sustento e a obriga??o alimentar.<br>  <br>  O dever de sustento diz respeito ao filho menor, e vincula-se ao pátrio poder (leia-se: poder familiar); seu fundamento encontra-se no art. 1.566, IV, do Código Civil de 2002; cessando o poder familiar (antigo pátrio poder), pela maioridade ou pela emancipa??o, cessa conseqüentemente o dever em quest?o (CAHALI, Yussef Said. DOS ALIMENTOS. 3a edi??o. S?o Paulo: Editora Revista dos Tribunais, 1999. p. 684).<br>  <br>  A obriga??o alimentar n?o se vincula ao pátrio poder, mas à rela??o de parentesco, representando uma obriga??o mais ampla que tem seu fundamento no art. 1.696 do Código Civil de 2002; tem como causa jurídica o vínculo ascendente-descendente (CAHALI, Yussef Said. Obra citada, p. 685).<br>  PROCURE UM ADVOGADO DE FAMILIA, ELE ENTRARá COM O PEDIDO, ENCAMINHARá AO ITAMARATI, BEM, ELE PODERá DAR MAIORES INFORMA??ES. <br>  PROCURE O SITE <a href="http://www.direitodefamilia.com.br/materia.asp?CodMater=206" rel="nofollow">http://www.direitodefamilia.com.br/mater...</a>|`|72a13bb42cbcb77e32947d6e846f8711aa	Voces arrumam cada problema.<br>  <br>  Agora fique esperta e lembre-se que lei e' lei e foram feitas para serem quebradas.<br>  <br>  O nosso senador pagava pensao alimenticia usando a maquina de corrupcao do estado.

dABa8rYbaa	One thing I've  found interesting to learn is that actual ceremonies are a man-made idea. I had never thought about it...but there is no ceremony recorded for Adam and Eve. In fact, the bible actually shows that marriage is the act of 2 becoming 1...which means that the marriage of a man and a woman happens when they engage is sexual intercourse.<br>   <br>  That's why even today when two people get married, but don't consummate the marriage, the marriage is found invalid an can be annulled rather than having to go through the process of a divorce (because to be divorced would mean you had to have been married to begin with, and marriage isn't final unless it is consummated by sexual intercourse). <br>  <br>  Back to your questions...I'm assuming when you ask 'What is its purpose?' you are referring to the ceremony? The act of the marriage ceremony is done to unite two people in marriage before witnesses. To make a public statement that you are committing yourself to the other person in marriage. It's taking  a stand, making a statement, vowing before witnesses that this is the person you've chosen to spend the rest of your life with...<br>  <br>  Unfortunately in today's world this doesn't really seem to mean as much as it once did.<br>  <br>  As for vows...obviously, they seem to have gone from being very traditional to very non-traditional. I wonder who came up wtih 'wedding vows' in the first place? I find it hard to accept that I am supposed to say something to my future spouse just because some guys hundreds (or even thousands) of years ago decided these were the words that needed to be said during a wedding ceremony. <br>  <br>  My fiance and I are writing our own...we're having a very non-traditional wedding, so we might as well go all the way and write our own vows as well. Atleast we'll be really meaning what we say...not to mention understanding the words that we say. Have you really paid attention to some of the traditional vows said?!  Some of the weirdest words I've ever heard!|`|EaEcFpjdaa	Marriges is one of the wonderfull relationship. It mainly depends on them how they make their  marriage successfull .<br>  Mainly depends on the beliving &trusting each another.|`|AA11412999	Just celebrated our 13th anniversary on Monday.<br>  Although we have been legally married for 13 years, we went through a sort of "rebirth" about 5 years ago.  We unofficially divorced one another and completely rejected the old marriage, declaring it dead in the water.  Then we rebuilt it exactly the way we wanted it, throwing out the cookie-cutter plans that every married couple is handed the day they say their Vows-In-A-Can.  It's like some kind of kit like paint by numbers or something.  "Thank you for purchasing Marriage in a Box!  The ONLY way to be happy!"  <br>  <br>  The purpose of our marriage is no longer to be see how long we can last, how much we can accumulate, how many kids we have, how many times we have sex per week, and certainly not to find validation through one another.<br>  <br>  Our marriage used to exist because we wanted something from one another; now it exists only so that we can GIVE ourselves, our lives, our love to one another.  To paraphrase, our vows used to be, "I'll try to love and cherish you (yada yada)...IF you PROMISE me that you'll stroke my enormous ego by telling me I'm the only woman who can turn you on and make you happy.  This is how you will prove your love to me."<br>  Now our vows sound more like this: "I don't care if you love me back or not.  I don't care how you change.  I don't even care if you accidentally hurt me.  I am VOWING to be your friend, come what may.  That means I'll be your friend even if we're together or not, and I'll do everything in my power to never hurt you.  But if I do, I'll trust you to forgive me, because the injury was not intentional.  And I'll do the same for you.  All I want to do is help you live a full, abundant life, and if you want to prove your love to me, then do it by living up to your full potential.  I'll be your witness, and your life will not go unnoticed.  I don't want to attach you to my life; I want to attach myself to yours.  I'm giving you everything that I am, my whole life.  Please respect the gravity of this gift, and use it well."  <br>  <br>  I have never been happier.|`|xc9xh14xaa	A ceremony to show that both of you are now together.

I'm a very friendly person and I find it hard to be friends with girls because they think I'm either sleeping with all these guys or I'm going to steal their boyfriends away (neither of which is true).|`|MNnIszzFaa	yes just becasue i loook good and dated alot, and it seemed as if i did do everyone but i didnt, so i got into my current relationship 8 months! woopee for me and i lost my virginity to him, no one knew for 2 months till me and him and another couple were tlaking and somone must have over heard, so i had sex once and it labled me so just take pride in the name and use it sarcasticly, they want to call u that, figure out clever ways to backfire it or just kik the crap outta whoever says that to you, and dont be shy about it...|`|UqAJMu3eaa	that's my fantasy|`|hcJuzrfyaa	no, not me . Try not to sleep around , you will get more than a reputation - have some bloody self respect !|`|AA12272744	I used to have somewhat of a "player" reputation in my school. People were just really gossipy, so every time they saw me talking to a guy, they would assume that's the person I was dating. They saw me talking to numerous guys at different times, so they thought I was going out with all of them at the same time. Even though I hadn't dated anyone in my life at that point, it was because of a misconception that I got that reputation. But hey, although it was inaccurate, it was still fun to have people look up to me for my "abilities"!|`|fd19cc30485a33a66a4b55289acd51d0aa	i think all my friends are sluts, cause they sleep with anything that walks and cant keep a relationship.  !!!
0BWISHOMaa	Since you didn't tell us why you and the ex broke up, it's hard to comment, but I'm guessing that the breakup had a reason, you didn't just drift.<br>  If you broke up for a reason, then you need to decide if that reasn is enough to stay away from her.
RrIM1EMzaa	Definitely not!<br>  <br>  Having been a housewife whilst my kids were little I can tell you it can be pretty isolating, and demeaning. No matter how cool your man is, its always there in your mind that its his wages you're spending.<br>  <br>  Without kids in playgroups etc I'd have ended up being a total recluse or something and not seeing anyone... unless I used his money to go.<br>  <br>  I know in theory it should have been our money but the dependency is always lurking.<br>  <br>  Plus, work stimulates the mind and gives you interest in life. Without this, surely there is a big danger of the brain going to jelly a bit, and of becoming so boring with only how much the supermarket bill was this week to talk about that your man will lose interest and respect for you?|`|wnO8iGlqaa	Hell no I would get bored easily and then be one of those women who b*tch about not being able to spend her husbands because, " I work hard to taking care of the kids, cleaning and cooking" blah blah blah<br>  <br>  Nope I will want to get a job even if its part time. To have money to blow off on whatever it is I want. And there would be no money problems in my marriage.<br>  <br>  This girl isn't a house wife, I'm lazy..I hate cleaning h ahaha and the hell if I am going to cook a meal EVERYDAY for the rest of my miserable life. <br>  <br>  I do want to take care of my kids though (if I had any) that would be the ONLY reason why I stay home. Until they are old enough to go to school of course.|`|1isNCpfiaa	No. Never. I need to be in the work force. I wouldn't want him to think that he has 100% control over me, therefore, I can't buy what I want, and have no freedom. I want him to work and do his job while I'll work and do my job. As for the home, the work will get done. I'll still clean and cook half the time or whenever I can for us, and he'll do it too. It's all about compromise.|`|8LSDfixwaa	omg yes I would love to..and but then again I would also like to make my own money so I'm not dependent on a man for anything at all because you could get burned in the end, he may take off and leave then you have nothing.|`|pBbNoPAaaa	maybe. prob not (even tho i'm too young to be thinking bout this) but no, i don't want to just be at home all day that's so boring! lol|`|lqphthnDaa	i would try it.  but im not sure that i would be able to do it for very long.|`|2dud2xsJaa	yes i would because it would give me more time with him.|`|xxAqQga9aa	YES|`|4XiUWhUYaa	yes, if it's a big house|`|A7gsIbvQaa	they should!|`|XX2vJ4Gpaa	nope because i wanna make a living|`|EoHGlGQWaa	if i could have spending money to shop then yes. otherwise no!|`|oRzqWhsDaa	yes|`|WkA8UPflaa	it depends if i was tired of my career. I mean if I felt like I had accomplished enough and was ready for a break maybe and if i had a lot of kids. Otherwise I would feel like i was wasting my time staying at home.

O esvaziamento da amizade consumatória parece estar fazendo surgir um outro tipo de rela??o mediada por interesse de luta por uma causa comum, ou contra um inimigo comum, ou de uni?o para celebrar um acontecimento solidário, ou para fazer de conta que, nesse mundo sem cora??o (Lash, 1991), só existir amizade mediada por uma causa do bem. Ou seja, temos que nos contentar com uma “quase-amizade”, um arremedo de amizade, com aqueles que vivem sob o mesmo guarda-chuva do trabalho, ou que empreendem conosco um projeto de estudo, ou para jogar bola num clube, ou participar de uma ONG, de um partido político, ou se ligar aos irm?os de uma fé “x” ou igreja “y”, porque devemos fazer o que estiver ao nosso alcance para evitar que as pessoas fiquem cada vez mais individualistas e o mundo cada vez mais sombrio e sem cora??o.<br>  <br>  <br>  .........................................<br>  “...Se amas sem despertar amor; isto é, se teu amor, enquanto amor, n?o produz amor recíproco [mas sim ódio], se mediante tua exterioriza??o de vida como homem amante n?o te convertes a homem amado, teu amor é impotente, uma desgra?a”( Marx, K.

AA10379925	i totally understand what you are talking about, decent girls are rarer than albino alligators. Honestly though who can blame the female sex for their slutty actions. I mean mainstream media shows "miley" in provocative photos at age 14!!! Palin's 17yr old daughter is pregnant and Jaime Lynn Spears is breastfeeding her kid at age 17 is it?? Wow i mean Wow.. <br>  <br>  I am about to turn 20 and every girl I know is not even half way close to dating material. They either consume more alcohol a day than a 300lbs raging alcoholic man does in a week . Or is on some mind altering narcotic that severely impairs there sense of judgment. Thus leading to unstable emotions and fluctuating behaviors. So if the majority of the women out there are anything like the vast majority of girl friends I know or have met. Then i think its safe to say the the human race as we know it is doomed to many generations of douche bags and bimbos. This will create a classic domino effect leading to the down fall of many Economy's and inevitably the end of the human race as we know it. <br>  <br>  Have a good day,  If we are lucky we'll find a used up std infested dimwit 20yrs older than us.

You are not looking for them in the places where they might be.  I would suggest, including, but not limited to, young persons group at your place of worship, alumni from your university, local groups that cater to a particular social interest of yours.  Maybe some of the web sites such as EHarmony or Match.com may help. <br>  <br>  You're not going to find a girl with the qualities you seek at a bar.<br>  <br>  Once you find the girl you love, you'll want her to be a slut with you...|`|Lmol29nxaa	hi. well if you really love someone why should the way she use to be matter? not every girl is a slut/stuck up. you should get to know people before you judge them and beauty is whats inside so try finding a girl based on her personality alone. but it is the sad truth that alot of girls think their guy has to be straight up ballin'. a 14 year old? man that is sad. but its not all the girls fault. society makes girls think its ok to sleep around and that they should sit around all day by their pool why their man is out making 20Gs. thats what we see on TV thats what we expect....NOT ALL GIRLS ARE LIKE THAT!!!!<br>  but remeber "you want a lady in the street but a freak in the bed!"|`|vhzDLyiuaa	The best things come when your least expecting them.

Is beauty truly a huge factor? Would you only go out with a girl because she is pretty? I tend to notice that once I get to know someone their inner beauty becomes more prevalent on the outside and those small flaws I noticed before vanish. At 28, it's no wonder you're still single. You have to understand what a relationship is about. Its about compromise, communication, values and beliefs. If someone isn't as smart as you look at it as a positive, you can teach that person new things every day. But smarts are debatable as well, they may not be smart in Literature for example, but incredibly knowledgeable in the Medical field. Selflessness is very uncommon to find in the society we live in, so to find a woman with this is golden, thats one great thing that you're looking for. Try joining clubs or even taking some college courses to meet people with your same interests. It's more common to find a slut where the man sluts lurk. Check yourself before criticizing others.|`|J64W9UsXaa	Oh my god you are so cute,<br>  I just want to grab you and give you a hug.<br>  Dont worry, I am very sure that someone like you<br>  Will definetley find someone to fall in love with.<br>  Dont give up, EVER because if you do<br>  You never know what Your going to miss,<br>  or not going to miss.<br>  Keep your head up =D<br>  <br>  |`|l2EFsjycaa	Maybe you're idea of beautiful needs reformed.

No lies, no deception, no cheating....just have fun...."and ALWAYS bring a plate to the party".....don't go with your hands swinging.....that's for the single/solo guys!|`|77622be92ab404409f818db551a4987aaa	I'm assuming you are a single male, so I'm addressing my answer as such.<br>  <br>  It is difficult for a single guy to get into the swinger lifestyle.  First because swinging is mostly a couples activity.  Yes, there are couples out there looking to include a single male in their playtime, but for every couple looking for this there is 10 single guys competing for their attention.<br>  <br>  Second, many single guys are simply disrespectful and lecherous and have turned many couples off from including single males.<br>  <br>  Third, and related to above, most single males don't understand the lifestyle or swingers.  They (like most outsiders) think that swinging is a 24/7 orgy and that swingers will have sex with anyone, anytime, anywhere, hence they approach it as such and turn-off allot of couples.  Swinging is couples fulfilling fantasies, and some of those require a single male.  If you approach it this way than you'll have better success.  If you think it's an easy way to get laid and not have to deal with any commitment with the woman later on, than you're not only sadly mistaken about swinging, but you'll get nowhere with swingers.<br>  <br>  I am constantly amazed at the crap a single male will say to my wife, things he'd never say to a single woman he was trying to pick-up or get to know.  It is a huge turn-off.<br>  <br>  So good luck.  I hope the advice above helps some.|`|AA11412999	My question to you is, does your wife know and approve of your extramarital adventures?

raW99VT4aa	Not all men "let it out" after marriage.  It boils down to respect.  Everyone has their limit on what they want their partner to share with them.  If he cannot respect your boundaries that you have discussed with him, then that means he does not respect you.|`|AA10042617	So you don't fart or pick your nose?  You also don't over eat or nag him and you still fit into your wedding dress?<br>  <br>  When people live together they get to see much more of their partner than they used to.  It's part of life.  My guess is that the person that you were attracted to is still there, only you get to see what goes on behind the scenes and he is much more relaxed now.<br>  <br>  Remember this, you cannot change someone else.  No matter how hard you try, it is really up to him.  You said that you have not kissed him in years, which shows him that you don't care about him.  This takes away any incentive for him to try and please you, so keep that in mind when you withhold affection from him.<br>  <br>  If you want to keep him from farting, then you may want to change up his diet.

In this case ur husband`s contempt is for social etiquette. U r not over-reacting, most women, unless raised in the backwoods, would be repulsed by such habits and rightfully turned-off. If telling him in a nice way what his habits r doing to u and he does not make any attempt to change or at least refrain from doing them in front of u, U have several choices, if u love him, accept him as he is, tell him ur desire for him is gone or if the bad out weighs the good, tell him u can`t bear living with him any more and he either stops or ur leaving. Maybe a wake-up call is all he needs. Just make sure he knows ur serious about what u say. Some men don`t find the things that annoy us as being gross, so they really don`t listen to our pleas.

9wsExzfEaa	That is a difficult situation.  Are you sure about your feelings? If so then you deserve to at least tell her so you don't feel sorry for the rest of your life.  I know my suggestion might be  a little bit impersonal but it will save you and her a lot of embarrassment.  Write her a letter and give it to her.  Tell her about your feelings.   To call off ones wedding is not easy but is not fair to live life wondering if you should have told her.  Ask her to meet you in a certain place if she feels the same.  Good luck...|`|6tDgRhh2aa	she is about to get married thats mean she love this one and you are with some one else already too<br>  hummmm i think if i even try i will be selfish<br>  try to give the happiness for the one you have  and live the other to get her happiness|`|KLQhXJPwaa	First, I must tell you that's a dangerous game you're gonna get yourself involved in. Second, think about the situation. The girl you want is about to get married, who's to say that if you two were about to get married she wouldn't do the same? If she leaves the man she's to be wed to be with you, and if you leave your other for, who's to say that later on down the line the same situation won't happen again, but this time one of you may be the victim. All I'm saying is expect the best, but be prepared for the worst!

NcDEHJXLaa	I will date anyone as long as they hve a good personality!!!!|`|xoYVs7tBaa	Yea you date someone because you like them for who they are not because of the color of there skin. so definitely yes|`|Oc2L4g67aa	I actually prefer girls who dont have a tan.|`|PxCcSWbZaa	guys are not that detail specific.  Even if you have no pigment in your skin, as long as you have a good or fair body you will be fine.|`|RZVMPAIEaa	beauty is in the eye of the beholder|`|aIoHvMzcaa	As the saying goes, beauty is in the eye of the beholder. Some guys like tan girls, some like pale girls, some like black girls, some like latin girls, etc. Asking that question here is useless. It all depends on the guy in question. As long as you are not some freakishly white albino, it shouldn't be a problem. But physical attraction is not the only part, personality is also VERY important. And no, it is also not the ONLY part like some liars *above poster cough cough* claim. If a girl (or guy) is a Jerry Springer side show freak, I don't care how good their personality is, they aren't getting noticed by the opposite sex as anything other than "friends." And even then it is pushing it because nobody wants to be seen in public with a freak. So, in conclusion, you must look at least moderately attractive, and then you must have a good personality. As far as your skin, it is subjective.

ugIYOK91aa	If you want to kiss him, what's stopping you? The next time you and he part ways after a nice outing together, initiate a hug. As you're embracing him, look into his eyes for a brief moment, and then give him a peck on the lips. Just a quick peck, it needn't be more provocative. If he really likes you, he'll actually kiss you back! And he'll find it sexy that you were assertive enough to take such a risk.|`|AnrT5fM7aa	when you two have been together for a few days just give him a hug or something or just be close to him don't rush at him you'll make um nervous. normally guys have no idea what girls want them to do no matter what signs they may let on so the best thing for you to do is make the first step but don't seem to eager.|`|AA11808385	that's what my best friend and me did.....and here we are we've been together for a while....he already held me,we already kissed on the lips,and we already made out......u just need to give it time and talk to him about it.and its a good sign u think about him.....that's the same way i feel about my bf....we love each other....give him ur phone number and atleast tell him where u live....my baby goes to my house and calls me every time....so u should do the same|`|hQ7sVN8uaa	guys love it when girls make a move... trust me...<br>  <br>  Go kiss him hell love it... ask him to hold you close, he'll love to hold you
0f8kAT5gaa	The most obvious way, in person! Just go for it--if you like her and she likes you back, then it shouldn't be at all a big deal to just ask her. As to specifically WHAT you say, that's up to you. Be creative, or be traditional. Either one works.|`|IwCoHqD0aa	talk to her in person and tell her what u have in your mind.|`|szQugznkaa	ask her over the phone no doubt, lead her into a conversation that'll charm her and leave her vulnerable for you to pop the question and get a good answer. humor works great if you're a fairly comical guy, i kno it works wonders for me when i'm trying to get a girl comfortable with me|`|weFCKoBPaa	dont ask her through  IM, that will be awkard at school. do it in person
YwwXh4CSaa	tell her that it is a dream of yours also and u didnt mean for this to happen if u had the choise it would be both of u that got it but it is not and it didnt work out that way just be there for her... but if she is a good friend she would be happy for u to|`|MpzmnbCZaa	u made it she got screwed obiously ur better than her so tell me something if u gave up ur spot for her and when and if she becomes famous u actually think she gonna remmeber u? think about  why give up ur dreams for someone elses?|`|Qpb6kam2aa	Well, if you took her spot then you must be better, then she probably wont get as far as you anyway, so its probably better for you, yes.<br>  <br>  Dont feel bad.<br>  She will get over it.|`|AA10334284	it depends on what you mean by you taking her spot. if you mean a contest and you happened to win, no. not unless u cheated or did something unfairly or lied, if its ur dream go for it. i understand her being mad but i think if shed really ur friend she will feel bad and apologize and no ur not being a bz. :)|`|9vJggc0caa	if it's also a dream of yours, then dont waste it, it's not often that your dreams become a reality, and who knows, your friend may not even be a friend in a few months time, and you'll regret leaving modelling.|`|YiBVKbWpaa	There must be more than one spot for modeling!|`|AA10373401	modeling is not based on spots,  so u didn't do the wrong thing.|`|Tgqji3lLaa	Do not leave modeling.<br>  If she can't accept they accepted you over her without ruining your friendship... Than she shouldn't be your friend at all.<br>  <br>  If this is ruining your friendship, then your friendship isn't worth it.  She probably jealous and selfish, so if she doesn't like you doing modeling, then stop talking to her.<br>  <br>  That would mean she isn't a True friend to you if something like modeling gets in the way between you two.<br>  <br>  Again, don't drop modeling, that will be your future.<br>  Your friend won't be your future.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|Vs8ePl12aa	First of all... if she's mad at you for something that is out of your control, you should consider who your friends are? Are you valuing your friendship more then she is?? Sorry.. it just seems like she's more concerned about HER modeling career then about her friendship. I guess you should ask yourself, do you think she would drop out of modeling for you?<br>  <br>  In all honesty, if it's your dream then she should accept that they chose you instead of her. You have every right to that spot in modeling. You earned it, didnt you? Try to make her understand that this IS your dream, and that you want it just as much as she did and that there is no reason why she should be mad at you since it had nothing to do with you in the first place. You didnt purposely take her spot did you? In that case, she has no reason to be mad at you particularly. <br>  <br>  And if she was a good friend, she would realize that your dream is worth just as much as her own. She should be happy for you that you have managed to achieve your dream and ... she shouldn't give up on her own dream as easily as it seems she has. <br>  <br>  hope this helps ... =)|`|f360441d45b279ef483ab0c22a2eb310aa	Wow i was on that same boat years ago with my best friend since 3rd grade. We went to a modeling place and they picked me over her. And it was also more of a dream to her than me. Yeah i felt bad, but i did tell her not to give up and she kept trying to get in to the modeling and finally did. If you like doing it i wouldnt quit. she will get over it. If it's something you enjoy doing then dont give up and also tell her not to give up. There is more spots down the road for her to take. And she should be happy for you. You would of been happy for her if she got it and being your best friend she should be happy for you...|`|12fb03b6307d168f59c6cab5a451fac7aa	well you must have been chosen for a reseon how can you have been a B when you have no control over who the judges chose well i think if she really values ur friendship she will support u u should not have to give up ur dreams for her just cause she waas not picked shomeone else will pick her just not the ones ur with tell her to go ans see other agencys she will get a job just not the one u have got now "Smile a friend will support if a friend has given a thought"|`|AA10140271	Well you have to think whatsmore important your dream or your friendship?

If you pick the dream she'll totally get over and move to her next dream. If you pick friendship she'll probaly be upset because she'll now you quit because of her and you will be upset because you just lost your dream.|`|Ptrzm4Owaa	If both of you have the same dreams of course someone is going to get hurt by not making it. You should be proud of yourself for making it and too bad for your friend. She is being a bad sport just cause you beat her. You should keep modeling, if she were really your friend then that shoudn't come in between you two.|`|SCL2yglfaa	I Say Your friend iz being jealous because you are doing betta than her and of couse you are not being a B**** it iz her fault that she iz not working hard hard enough to win and  you are doing betta! But i would not want to end a friendship ova that! but i sort of belive that she iz being a bit STUBORD 4 not  doing az well as you!|`|dSB6vISSaa	You're friend is probably pretty jealous of you taking her spot in modeling which is understandable, but it doesn't matter what she thinks! If you really want to do you're friend will get over it!|`|XpHWwbRTaa	like drew said "dog eat dog world"<br>  <br>  its competition. you played fair and beat her. she cant be mad at you bc whoever was judging thought you were better for the job. <br>  <br>  dont worry about it. continue to excel in life and you will succeed.|`|noeTcpm3aa	Your best friend is always as pleased for you, and you would of been for her, otherwise find another best friend, who'll share in your dreams. Good luck.|`|HRyJ5TK8aa	Well If You Love Your Your Friend So Much You Could Give Her The Spot If You Want To Make Your Dreams Come True You Could Do Nothing   (But You Should Remember It Is Her Dream 2)|`|drFne2vsaa	Why was it her spot?  If it is your dream also it's every person for themselves.|`|HGVt4TOlaa	if she cant accept the fact that your better than her, and her appreciate that, than maybe you are better off without her..sorry but she doesnt sound right for you....|`|nm0jN9GIaa	Nope she should be happy for you and its tough luck for her.|`|Jch7tFldaa	hii1IF U DESERVED IT THEN UDID WHATS WRONG WITH THAT!U LEAVE HER SHE GONA COME BACK  AFTER REALISING THAT U WERE DA BEST.NC TYME EN TAKE CARE|`|qFIz31BBaa	She didn't fit the spot as well as you did.

Wouldn't you?|`|PPRT7InDaa	Its Dog eat Dog.|`|pGKv6ik8aa	if you stole her spot on purpose then you are being a B!T(H<br>  but if not on purpose then explaine it to her|`|AA10322192	yeah
AA10413142	The cheating may be because she is 19, self-centered and too immature to appreciate a good man. <br>  <br>  Consider dating someone who shares the same relationship values that you do. She should be in the same age bracket as you (24+). More than likely that lady will be someone who has self-respect, and enough experience to understand what committment is. <br>  <br>  Most young adults want meaningful relationships, but are still trying to soul search and are not ready to settle down. They are too busy exploring other options. <br>  <br>  <br>  If you decide to stick with this 19-year-old, you should take her to the clinic and stock up on condoms.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|c0dd28e337acd6c05e7bf0634abd5923aa	Once a cheater, always a cheater, find a girl that is faithful|`|909ba7c765e96de54c9f1a6fd7bdbd5caa	let her go SHE'S TOOO YOUNG FOR U, WRONG CHOICE FROM THE GETGO.FIND SOMEONE YOUR OWN AGE!!!!!!!!|`|t2kjEpwWaa	let her go, it seems hard but thats the best thing to do so just burn everything from your memory that has to do with her. it will take time but youll eventually get over it, find a new girl at least to destraction so you don think of her and before you know it she'll be gone from your memory. and definately DONT CALL HER!! OR EMAIL HER!! done|`|vKIO4NRqaa	You sound like a great guy. She has betrayed you twice and she is only 19 years old! Imagine what happens when she turns 21. Stop wasting your time with her. She could have given you a disease! She does not have the capability at 19 to love you on the same level that you love her... or she would have been able to honor her commitment! You made the right choice. Just because you still have feelings for her doesn't mean that it's a healthy relationship. Just because she cried doesn't mean she will change. That is how a guilty person reacts when they get caught (again) and realizes they're homeless because of their stupidity. Cut your losses! Oh, and don't let a girl move in with you until she has a ring on her finger...

qdE9hMIxaa	I think the age you marry is dependant on your goals in life as well as your maturity.  But really it has to be a personal decision.  My advice would be to give yourself time to enjoy life and do the things that you want to do while single.  I always said I wanted to finish my education and travel the world before I got married, well I didn't end up doing either.  I ended up finding an amazing guy who I wanted to do all of that with.  So my advice would be to set your goals, but if you meet the person that you want to be with and they are willing to support your goals and work to accomplish them with you, then why not go for it?|`|5270639c059ab08c1b3431555f150db7aa	24 and older - done post-secondary education, out in the workforce for a while, living independently, learning about yourself and the world first.|`|TRbUAtDuaa	when you feel you are ready for marriage I got married young me just turned 21 and my husband just turned 20 and we are married for a long time.<br>  I think that it depends on the individual and what they think<br>  marriage is a huge step and not to be taken lightly.|`|8zP8jO6Oaa	once you are well settled in life and ur career|`|AA12033464	Whenever you feel you`ve sown all your wild oats, and are ready to commit to one person.

eh5pBKrbaa	It's not any trouble at all.  You have to make a playlist for the DJ so a playlist for the Ipod isn't any harder.<br>  <br>  Check with your location and see if they have a soundsystem already hooked into the building that you can use or rent.  If not you will need to rent speakers.  Many party rental places do this for conventions and things when people do speeches and such.  You will need a laptop and the Ipod or you can buy the docking station.  Any electronics store will sell you an adapter cord that allows you to hook up the computer to the speakers and run sound through them.  You can play music directly off the laptop or connect the Ipod to the laptop and play that way.  If you have the docking station plug the docking station into the speakers, ipod into the docking station.  Either way make sure that you have the power source connected to the Ipod and that it is charged so your music doesn't die on you.<br>  <br>  The debate is heated on both sides on whether or not to use the DJ.  Some say timing is a problem but this is easy to fix if you break up the playlists into sections.  Have a First Dance, Mother/son and Father/daughter, Cake cutting,  a few Fast, a few Slow.  40 bucks and a meal can buy any teenager you want to run it if none of your guests will.  If the laptop is there and you have wireless you can download any song request in moments so I don't see that being a problem. <br>  <br>  I dunno, for me DJ's are expensive and way too cheeseball.  As far as announcements, that doesn't take professional experience to say "its cake cutting time!" and at least someone I know won't mangle the names by saying them all wrong.|`|AA12358335	IMO, I would say hire the DJ.<br>  <br>  On the one hand, I understand where you're coming from in wanting to save money - DJ's are expensive! However, you will need to make sure you've got speakers and all the appropriate docking accessories, and someone with enough equipment savvy to work it all. You'll also have to worry about set up. If you have someone willing to do all that and can  troubleshoot, then go for it. <br>  <br>  The other thing to consider is that the DJ is not only responsible for playing the music at your reception, he/she's also responsible for serving as your reception's emcee - s/he will announce your entrance as Mr. & Mrs. as well as call attention to things like your first dance, intro of the bridal party, cake cutting, bouquet/garter toss, etc. Do you have someone willing to do that for you at your reception? <br>  <br>  If it were ME, I'd say hire the DJ - it's just substantially less stress to have a trained professional controlling the mood of the reception.|`|bee7d4a3dc5792694d34b511a50849eeaa	My friend did this and yes, you basically need speakers and a dock to hook it up to. The only thing about doing this is that you will have to use a friend or someone to announce the wedding party and all the other important announcements like bridal toss. Plus, with the iPod you have to get it just right so like you have to really think like a DJ and it would be hard to predict the crowd. What if they want to dance slow songs are playing???|`|mgfHcckOaa	IMO The music at a wedding reception can either make or break the party. I understand that you want to save money but I think in the long run a DJ would be better. Wouldn't you want an MC that could get the crowd up and dancing? I'm not sure how you would do that with an IPOD.|`|GD2KVvkhaa	I know someone who used their IPOD instead of a DJ for their reception. One neat idea that they did was, they emailed their friends and family attending the wedding, and asked them what their 5 favorite songs where. Then they downloaded these songs so that everyone there would have something being played that they would enjoy. It was a great idea!!|`|T2pDAWVAaa	I think its a great idea, programed properly and set up right........  Wonderful idea.....  @ least the ipod won't get any bright ideas that could potentially mess up the groove of everything.....    BEST WISHES & GOOD LUCK:)|`|ca84jI3Maa	A good pair of speakers, a docking station, and someone to start it up is pretty much all you need, as I understand it. If anyone you know has any technical savvy at all, it shouldn't be difficult.<br>  <br>  Unless you know a DJ you can really trust not to ignore your no-play list and to be tasteful in making announcements, etc., and iPod is easier and probably cheaper.<br>  <br>  I've known lots of brides who would have chosen this over the DJ's they hired in a heartbeat!|`|wluzAk8Eaa	tha dj is easyer u won't have to do anything and a dj has more songs and one more thing u wouldn't have to set every thing up cause i went to a wedding just two days ago and belive me it was easyer that way|`|5270639c059ab08c1b3431555f150db7aa	Of course the idea might be tempting, but really not worth it in the long run. You can get a dj for $300 and up, depending on your area and the hours you want. You can have all the songs you want, and someone there to deal professionally with all the technical stuff, and who will keep the guests up dancing, and having fun. You have no hassles then!|`|12732763cb9e80926a8b8c61107b155aaa	just get a dj he comes with hes equipment and finish save urself the trouble...at 1st place thats a wacky idea

s6miUiKSaa	I would be very wary of this one. I dont know how old he is and how old you are. I would worry about the fact he has had numerous random sexual encounters with strangers and has never been in love.<br>  I would try asking him what sex means to him. Does it have any meaning or is it just some activity he can do with anyone?<br>  I would find out as much as possible about him, his past and current activities before getting too attached to him. Ask yourself: Is he willing to offer you everything too?|`|Q5Ub5LBGaa	based on the information you are giving, i would not consider him long-term relationship material. he is still a little too immature for you, and i am afraid you will end up with a broken heart (at the least, and perhaps a disease as well). <br>  <br>  you need to realize that there are a lot of very nice guys out there that have no need to play online games or mess around and hook up. you have a lot of potential and a lot to offer the right guy, so please don't waste your time trying to get a crocodile to sit in your lap and purr like a kitten. realize a person (this guy) for what he is, and don't try to delude yourself.|`|f7BNh47Aaa	Find out from his friends|`|h3p5YH0eaa	To answer  you should talk to him & if he dont understand that he is not respecting your feelings & maybe he ain't ready for a real relatinship.|`|sPTsTdPiaa	Relationships are always extremely hard. You give everything, and either it works, or you get crushed and you have to start all over again. At least he's taken down 2 of 3 websites. It's always hard to trust in a relationship when thing's like that are going down. You just have to try, and if it gets to the point where it's hurting more than it's helping you might want to give it a break.<br>  <br>  Boyfriends can't be controled, not that I think you are trying to control him. Guys will do what they want, they honestly don't think they're doing anything wrong.

qQLH7rAYaa	Have you considered having the ceremony and reception at the same venue or place? This way it may be cheaper for you and you can still have a traditional wedding in the attire you want. You can find a church with a hall or gathering area suitable for a small reception. You can choose a summer like gown if you wish and you can have a ceremony at a church even if you're not religious. Just research for the best price it could be up to $500 for the church including the pastor or priest to perform the nuptuals. Look on the wedding websites or find one of those wedding classifieds books (they're usually free in the grocery store) I know lots about weddings since alot of my friends have gotten married and all i do is watch wedding shows any way. If you think i can be of help email me lady_0780@yahoo.com   Good Luck :-)|`|4brYYxHOaa	Hi, and congratulations!!! My fiance and I are also planning a wedding, and so I know a little something about it. First, if you only have a reception, of course you can wear a 'summery like wedding dress', it's your day, you can make the decisions like that. And even though you arent religious/belong to a church, some churches will still be willing to marry you in a ceremony. You just need to ask around. Also, there are people who are ministers who arent affiliated with a particular church or organization, and therefore, might be a better bet. So yeah, congrats, and hope you big day is perfect!|`|E9xS7seKaa	If you really wanted a ceremony more than just a (literally 5-10 min.) court house wedding then you can still have one!  You can find justices of the peace or notaries who are willing to do weddings.  Sometimes even ministers are willing to do them.  You can work with them to pick out poems or something in place of religious readings.  You can book a non-religious venue like a golf-course or a park and have a ceremony there.   As for the dress....I have been to a few courthouse weddings and I think it would be kinda weird to have a big wedding dress.  Usually I see a casual dress and sometimes even a suit.  Think 1940's.   However, if you had a ceremony like I described...go for it!! If you have just a reception I would think you could wear a wedding dress.  As for your bridesmaid....if you wear a wedding dress pick out a traditional bridesmaid dress if you'd like.  OR have her go pick out something she likes in the color you are using for the wedding.  Then she can wear it again!  Good Luck.|`|ca84jI3Maa	My husband and I are both athiests, and we had a lovely wedding without clergy. We called the county clerk's office, they told us who would be on wedding duty on our wedding date, and we talked to him and set it up. He came to us, I wore a white gown and had five bridesmaids, while my husband wore a morning suit and had four groomsmen. There there was the picnic reception.<br>  <br>  So no, you don't have to have a clergymember marry you in order to have a wedding ceremony that's more than a quick courthouse deal.<br>  <br>  If, however, you choose to marry at the courthouse and have a reception later on, there won't be a marriage ceremony at that, so bridesmaids are out.<br>  <br>  If you'd like to have a bridesmaid and a wedding gown, I would simply have a licensed officient come to you. since money is an issued, I'd suggest having a fairly small wedding and reception at the same time. With a small guest list and a bit of creativity, you can have a lovely wedding in a park, a backyard or a generously-sized living room.<br>  <br>  Weddings aren't just for the devout.|`|5270639c059ab08c1b3431555f150db7aa	Have whatever ceremony you choose, and just have the type of reception you can afford.<br>  Sorry, don't like your choice for wedding dress at all - that pickup skirt thing just is a fad, and really isn't flattering....|`|3ba037b05903ac9005634f2b380e25f8aa	If you want something a little more formal than a courthouse wedding, hire a Justice of the Peace.

You can have a nice ceremony (complete with walking down the aisle, unity candle, etc) at the beach, in a park, your backyard, your reception site,. etc.
ca84jI3Maa	You two need to sit down and really talk seriously about this. Does he not understand how much money per head you're paying? Have you left vital people off the list? Is there a less expensive way you can take care of your guests and accomodate a few more? Has he had any say in the planning?<br>  <br>  Whatever you decide, it sounds like communication has broken down somewhere along the line.

He is commenting on women on TV.  That is not exactly something to get jealous over.  It would be different if you were in public like at the mall, and all he could do was comment on different women walking by.  Something like that would show a lack of respect for you.  However, since it is just on TV, I really think that you have no reason to be jealous.  I would re-examine your own feelings about yourself.  Maybe you have some insecurities that are brewing to the surface and that is what really has you confused.  If you are feeling insecure in your relationship with your b/f than I would discuss this with him.  There may be other things that he does that is causing you to feel this way and you are using the comments as the excuse, or it may just be yourself because of previous relationships.|`|fMGU1QKLaa	you could try acting a little jealous, just as a method of find out if your bf like a certain hair style,or a skirt length, or eye swadow, but not the kind where you will kill him if......|`|p53nLIJ2aa	no dont be jealus i mean if he didnt like you he wouldnt be with you.|`|AA11448035	If you feel beautiful and are satisfied with your appearance, and your bf finds you attractive.

Deal with it. The truth of the matter is everyone, male and female are jealous to some degree. There will always be someone hotter or prettier then you, and uglier then you, be happy with yourself. Your bf will notice other women it's a fact of life. It simply means that they're attractive aswell. You probably do it too, everyone does. It's human nature.

0BWISHOMaa	Firstly, it's perfectly natural to get wet. It's to lubricate the passageway so that intercourse isn't painful. That's why condoms come lubricated. If they, (or you), were dry during the act, it would cause serious friction and hurt like hell.<br>  As for the second question, all guys are different and therefore into different things. If you are happy in your relationship and are willing to take it to this level, then hopefully you can talk to him about anything. I know it can be a bit embarrassing to do the first time, but next time you're getting up close and personal, ask him what he likes, or what you can do to make it more exciting. Trust me, it's seriously worht it. My husband was so turned on by my interest that we nearly missed all the fun... Good luck|`|Rtn8kXsAaa	This is not the place to discuss this. You need to talk to an adult at home . How old are you?|`|NkSWh4i6aa	Getting wet  there.. is normal.|`|2450ec9e6d3869ead0de9bf051683455aa	i'm not giving you any beat off material|`|51cc9879c520209bf043785f8fb0f31aaa	1 that is completely normal, and for the second part I can't really help you. I am probably even more inexperienced than you are.
P9hW2Rzpaa	Maybe when he's upset about something he doesn't want to upset you as well. You need someone else to talk to sometimes other than your girlfriend. It's not oversensitive of you to care enough to want to know what's bothering him, you just have to understand that he may want to deal with it outside of you.|`|6tDgRhh2aa	better you talk to him about that things or wait till he cant handel it any more and go to other girl ...|`|2ygOPyemaa	If he doesn't want to tell you, don't press it.  He doesn't feel comfortable telling you.  Try to give him another outlet for his stress.|`|deSaogUeaa	This is THE guy problem. Woman want MORE, men want LESS (talk). If you share with him openly in a quiet time, it will convince him it is safe for him to do so too. It is going to take some time and commitment.

It is that simple. Put your arms around him, hug him, rest your head on his chest and tell him that you love him! Do something like that. You don't have to do sexual favors. Yes, guys are of course going to be like "OOH! sexual favors, me likey!" Be careful with sexual favors too, they can backfire.
ee0920ee022f74741b54f20fb343063faa	Do not do anything.  Girls like a hard to get person.  Act uninterested and if she really likes you then she will come back and talk to you.  It is no biggy about the contert.  You will find or run into the one and only soon enough and it will work out on its own.  Don't put that much pressure on yourself.  You are only human and we all make mistakes and if she cannot understand that ... you don't want her to begin with.|`|37c6b16774d58ac20a5d068778465bc7aa	lol... my friend... you just burn your only chance... <br>  <br>  forget about it... and move on to the next prey...|`|9654d75c1ab1179325e3968d37f1ed1baa	tell the girl you like what your intention was and maybe she will under stand.

You will find in your life there are a lot of females that want to play games with your heart. Stand up for yourself. There will be females in your life. One day you will find the right one as she will find you. Life is too short to play my friend. My best to you. Be all you can be!|`|AA10202179	Yeah, just be honest with her about how awkward you were feeling, and that you'd like to talk to her more. If she's decent, she'll be understanding about it.
an8IRuhSaa	different gals hav diff opinions,<br>  u can try it until shes happy n wans more,<br>  u 'll have the time of yr life dude|`|6tDgRhh2aa	so you are not sure if she satisfaied or not ... <br>  any way if she judg you for 1 sex time ...... u can complet what i want to say|`|2MRXjLFOaa	Don't worry you will have many more shots at it. Relax|`|AA10983477	most girls should be more understanding than to let that worry them. She would probably understand that the first time you would be a bit nervous and it takes a few times to be attuned to each other. Thats not the only way you can satisfy her either.|`|AA11587751	dpends if she really understood your situation. How old are you? Most of the time, when you are young, full erection is not achieved when you are too insecure of satisfying the girl.<br>  Most girls would admire US animals in bed, even if you treat them like trash they keep coming back.<br>  But think that if she comes back to you not because of the sex then she is really meant to last.<br>  If she leaves and contacts you even-as you say-you are a loser! Then she really loves you and you can think of marrying her(so if you continue to have erectile problems your family is safe hahahahaha)<br>  If she doen'e then don't feel bad she is a whore and you can always get them around.<br>  I guess initially solve the problem of erection. Don't have too much on your head-don't compare yourself to porn stars, just go with the flow and biologically it should stand and be hard as steel.<br>  Good luck! If I mine is called Lethal Weapon yours is Useless Weapon hahahahah joke!!!!-it can easily be solved.|`|AA11928183	screw 'em all man.  You only live once then you get married.|`|Zoafz0Vraa	no, she won't! if she is normal and not stupid, she must know, that sometimes it happens but it's OK, and there is nothing to be afraid of.<br>  <br>  besides it is a good way to learn if your relationship is important for her and how deeply\strongly(?) does she like you.<br>  <br>  don't worry
iVEwq3cjaa	well....its sort of confusing... but... if its what i think.... u r probably doing the right thing.....|`|HG5ZNvwMaa	drama drama drama-talk 2 her about how you feel-in the end if she feels the same other guys that like her won't matter 2 her.

AA12095283	Would'nt have any test.Either he  does or he does'nt take things as they are.His mother, gimme a break|`|AA10665652	Break ups always have confusion and misunderstandings. But  if he wants to get back together again, and wont stop pestering you, then agree to it. Ask your father why he didn't like him. The guy undoubtedly convinced his mother that you were seeing someone else, which is what he thought was true. Being that you didn't correct him  (maybe you did, but not convincingly) she told him to give you a test. For the sake of peace, just take the test, which should really be more than one. YOu always were over presumptious, Cindy Lynne!|`|AA10835897	Just tell him to cut the crud and give you a straight answer. Who'd want to be in a relationship with a guy who they have to prove everything to?|`|e79d4cbcc7bcdb565178fa9137a711e5aa	Sometimes its really hard to trust someone even if they've done none-few things wrong their whole relationship. Cheating is EVERYWHERE. <br>  Depending on what the test is, and how much you love him, maybe you should just go along with it.
K1biaWU7aa	Why do you want a guy who just wants "benefits" to notice you  more? So you can further the abusive relationship?  This in turn lowers your self-esteem furthering the cycle (that, no doubt has already started).   Do NOT settle for anything less than what you want and deserve.  Is this guy the last male in your world?  Sorry to say this but HE'S JUST NOT THAT INTO YOU.  Find someone else that is and stop wasting your time.  Sorry for the tough love...|`|AA10835897	of course there's always hope! You just have to confront him and explain what you're feeling the best you can, and if he thinks the two of you won't wrok out, at least you can still keep the whole just-friends thing going!|`|QuB9xjOzaa	I remember when my first boyfriend dumped me, i was absolutley mortified. For about two yrs after that, i obsessed about him day in day out he was "all i wanted". The real reason for this was because he never told me WHY!- i never got closure from the relationship. So i was just wondering if you both ever sat down and talked about what happened between you, maybe its not that you want him back, its the simple fact that you want closure. Just a thought....
QhRO0kcMaa	Always go with someone you Love.

AA10372597	If I was you I would find some who would have a little RESPECT for me(you)...You are not a animal so don't let him or anyone else treat you like one... ok Find someone who will love you the same way that you love them and have RESPECT for you|`|6f55018be55def6322ee6829868961afaa	The crying will be something you'll simply have to do. It will make you stronger in the end. Leave him. He doesn't treat you right and you don't deserve that. Don't get into the habit of letting guys treat you wrong.. you'll do it your entire life if you start now!|`|44bba4ed155b45dc504c9d4f02d9078aaa	I would sit down and talk to him about his treatment of you in front of his friends.  Let him know that if he continues that you are going to leave him.  He will either straighten up or you will find out he doesn't love you like you think he does.  Good Luck!|`|2XPIRYsUaa	sounds like you need to learn how to take control of your man. Heres what you do. Start acting the same way around your friends and when he asks you to do something around his friends say no and leave then call him later n talk to him o the phone about it If he's the right one for you then he'll stop his madness|`|5E8OEShyaa	Honey, it's never good to put yourself in a situation like that. Being with this guy is making you compromise your sense of self and self-worth. If all he does is order you around and not show you the attention that you need from him you are under his control, and that's all he wants from you. I know that being controlled to some extent can feel like love but trust me it's not. Let it go. I can almost guarantee that if you don't leave now it will get worse. You will cry and it will hurt but most likely if you stop having contact with him on that level in less than a few months you will be over it. LOVE YOU MORE THAN YOU LOVE HIM!!!!!!!!|`|WCvMNgXJaa	Well if he teats you like that you should leave him...I know it's going to be very very hard but the fact is that his culture is hispanic and they are a very male dominate race....that means the more he has his "woman" under control the more he is looked as a good bf or whatever it's a real raw deal and I hope you make the right decidgion and leave him I know it will be extreamly hard the main thing is to try to keep yourself busy with friends and family don't dwell in your room looking at photos and so on...I hope it works out for you<br>  <br>  Best of luck<br>  <br>  -Moose|`|HOJ2C0VWaa	stop tormenting yourself.

ca84jI3Maa	Price buying the whole pig, the chickens, etc. then call a couple caterers and get general estimates. Your luau will probably wind up being cheaper, but that way you'll get a better idea of whether you're saving...and if so how much. Be sure to factor in plates, napkins, silverware, cups, etc. in your calculations.<br>  <br>  Savings or not, though, that sounds like a fantastic party!<br>  <br>  I do know that when I got married, we saved a bundle by self-catering with cold picnic-style foods (sandwich makings, potato salad, fruit salad, green salad, fruit tarts) at our outdoor wedding reception. If the luau turns out a bit more expensive than you were thinking, that's another possibility.<br>  <br>  Keep the creative ideas flowing, and you're bound to come up with some fun and easy ways to save a little cash.<br>  <br>  Best of luck to you!|`|UEk5VABoaa	I love this idea. It has the aire of celebration you know?<br>  You'll save money if you do it the right way. You think your saving money by not hiring a caterer, etc, which you will if you plan wisely.<br>  I did my wedding on a budget, and I would find myself thinking..oh well I didn't spend the money on that fancy cake, so I can use the money for more flowers. What I'm saying is just keep it under control and this could work!<br>  Congrats!!!|`|ooxzlNViaa	Here is a great place to buy things for your luau at great prices. <a href="http://www.orientaltrading.com/application?namespace=browse&origin=home.jsp&event=catalog&categoryId=377343&tabId=PartySupplies" rel="nofollow">http://www.orientaltrading.com/applicati...</a>|`|L8vTzMDlaa	I think it could definately be cheaper for you. But you have to keep an eye on the money you spend in preparation because it adds up really fast and could end up costing you more if you dont watch it!! So just be careful, cut corners wherever you can, but still create a fun recepetion. Its a great idea. Good luck!

AA12019145	all i can say is that you are not really making sufficient amount of efforts from your side to get over this. he is a nobody and has no control over you. keep this mind dear, mind control is something very important and you must learn it. i am no psychologist but i know one thing for sure, don't think abt things or people that upset you. keep your mind occupied with books and other things. get busy and make a strong effort not to think abt him. <br>  <br>  and trust me you will be fine in exactly 8 days.<br>  <br>  <br>  8 days that is all, but you must be sincere in ur efforts.....<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|6R5TSoIZaa	dont worry babee.<br>  that happened to me.<br>  i couldnt get over that guy even though i was dating someone else.<br>  butt dont worry you`ll get over him eventually.<br>  just dont bump into him<br>  causee if you see him with a girl..<br>  you`ll be freakin` jealoused.|`|gh0YJaOqaa	u should tell him how u feel, if all goes well, u might just get bac 2gether<br>  good luck
oIkJSPJOaa	Stay uninvolved for your sake.  As long as she is making an effort to get him back, she would be bitter with you for being in the way.  For the record, I hope he doesn't ever take her back. She made a decision, and that should now be her lost.
JE7KFqjhaa	No you shouldn't, lord knows you shouldn't. Lock your door and tell her that you are brother and sister and it is very VERY  un-natural. Please tell me she is your step sister.

Even factoring out society's reaction, having children together would be beyond inadvisable. <br>  <br>  The only reason I would imagine you would actually be considering this is that she is hot, and that for a guy it is very difficult to refuse easy and convenient sex. <br>  <br>  All the more reasons why it would be VERY inadvisable to go ahead with your/her plan.|`|SMz63SFjaa	i konw i'm not a guy buy ne guy that says yes is a jerk as well as you for even thinking that there could be a yes, you idiot, i can't believe you would even consider that!!!!!!!!!!  guys get stupider every day i swear. well some, and your one of them!that's so sick!!!!eeeeewwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww!!!!!!!!!... you big nasty!!!!!!!!!

Don't do it, it is evil, wicked, degrading, unforgivable, incest, etc. she probably is a little girl both in age and sense and doesnt know what she is asking for. If you do it now and tomorrow she grows up and knows her left  from her right she would never forgive you for not avoiding this temptation that is not even worth it.

No namoro, tudo s?o flores, vc tem tempo para tudo e n?o há cansa?o, porque namoro vc tem que conquistar o sentimento, e no casamento, as pessoas já est?o relaxadas em rela??o à conquista, daí se acomodam. Tudo indica que é cansa?o mesmo, porque agora ele tem novas prioridades, tipo pagar as contas em dia, evoluir financeiramente e outras coisas que o casamento exige, e além do mais, vc tá ali do lado, a disposi??o, por isso ele se acomodou, porque tem a certeza dos seus sentimentos. A pior coisa que se pode acontecer num casamento é a acomoda??o e a certeza do homem. Deve-se sempre deixar um pouco de dúvida para que o homem (ou a mulher) n?o se acomode. N?o grila, n?o, n?o é outra mulher n?o, é cansa?o e preocupa??o. O que vc pode fazer é acender a chama novamente, pense no que ele gostava quando vcs estavam namorando e bote a imagina??o para funcionar. Boa sorte!!!

Like i dont need ot put on some act to get her attention and then slowly reveal myself for what I really am.. Yes I've met some women that are liek this right of the bat..<br>  <br>  Also i guess your asking for my favorite feature or persona? I like the eyes and hair.. And I LOVE it when a girl talks sports and understands that at tiems i may talk about something she isnt interested in, but she listens and responds because she knows if she doesn't than that woudl be rude and kind of make me feel stupid..|`|AA12167030	For me, a guy has to smell a certain way. I don't know if it's pheromones or what, but a guy can be pretty much perfect in every other way, but if I don't like the way he smells (not the same thing as thinking he smells bad!) then I won't go for it. He has to be smart and goal-oriented (in college or working post-college) too.

ieoACSmjaa	Honey there is NO EASY WAY TO DUMP SOMEONE!!!! I can tell you are a good person becuz most chicks would have just cheated. I think it is sweet that you care about his feelings. You are trying to not have him be jaded from this.   Let him know that you are looking for someone that can take control of a situation.  You understand that this is his first real relationship and you don't want to hurt him in any way but you need more intimacy in a relationship. Not sex.  But explain what you are looking for. Just be honest. Obviously don't tell him about the other guy you have crushing on. If you guys continue to be friends then you should be able to see when he getting over you. But I would wait until it seems that he has moved on in some way. Not necessarily another girl but maybe a better mood or something like that. When you do decide to get with this guy....DO NOT bring him around your ex until you know FOR SURE that he won't be devastated by what he sees.  Now I am not saying put your love life on hold, but since it appears that you have his best interest at heart, that is why I say take it slow. You can start getting to know to this guy whenever you want. It is the dating part that you would want to be careful with. Just don't throw it in his face that you found someone new so quickly. Good Luck sweetie!!|`|9b701ee514d98413099a7f9a981d4a9caa	u need to talk to him & ask him if hes uncomfortable. ask him if he rather be ur friend. u can make him more comfortable by telling him u wont rush him & that u 2 can hang out like any friends. but if u want to leave him then u just need to tell him that u dont feel like its working out & that u felt happier as friends.|`|2a7d579ba03ccc286021129a4035222baa	Be honest with the current guy.

0BWISHOMaa	People in life tend to grow apart. It doesn't matter how long you've known them, or how close you once were, as people get older, they change their personalities to something more fitting to the person they'll ultimately become. It's sad, but it's a fact of life.<br>  The person you are at 12years old is not the same and the person you become at 18, or 28 or even 58. <br>  It's hard to let go, but trying to hold on to a friendship that's drifted is just going to make things worse. Rather, be grateful that you had such a wonderful time together and find new friends of your own. Don't give up on your mate, just don't crowd her, let her come to you.<br>  Good Luck|`|VvwDYjFYaa	you should say everithing clear to ur best friend and ur friend about what u r feeling about them . u should break ur friendship from them.

She was WONDERFUL.  She had a great vision, understood exactly what we wanted, and she was really sweet and helpful!  To boot, her prices were very, very favorable and I ended up with way more than what I paid for in terms of quality.  Being an amateur photographer myself, I am pretty picky about quality--I received both a CD and prints (very professional) and both were more than acceptable.  Anyway, it was a fun photo shoot and we were excited about the photographs that we received.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|ca84jI3Maa	Any professional should have a contact list of previous customers you can talk to. Don't just call one person on the list, either. Talk to at least three or four so you get a better idea of what this person is like to work with.<br>  <br>  Also, if something about her or her company makes you uncomfortable, follow your gut. Even if there's nothing wrong with her, if she makes you uncomfortable then she'll stress you out on your wedding day. Surround yourself with people who make you feel comfortable. It will make you less stressed and you'll have a better time.

The thing is, you only really start to discover who you are as a person long after you've left school and have started work.

HG5ZNvwMaa	either he was bust 2 answer ur text or somem' but everything in live has a balance-u can't live w/out death and can't have happiness w/out sadness, just like u can't love w/out hate. me and my fiance get in some arguments/disagreements but i still love him-i joke to him and get like "i hate you so much i HAVE 2 love you." it's more of a feeling u don't actually hate them u just don't like their attitudes or how they're acting at the time. especially when he's a smart@$$ and makes me laugh as a joke like makin' fun of something i say but not 2 hurt me-and i'm all like i hate u. then make it up. lol-we're pathetic we know but we love each other. it's just that when you love someone sometimes it can get tough you know, personal space, trying 2 achieve goals, other things going on. my fiance makes me his top/ #1 priority, sometimes it makes me feel bad like i'm keeping him from doing what he wants. but he says "no-i love making u my top priority-that's what a guy should do." anywhoo point is-everything in life every feeling has it's own balance|`|0VwSp06iaa	yea u can maybe talkin 2 him is rite so he knows how u feel, dont let his pretti face fool u.good luck|`|WZPMzvuOaa	I think of it as the Yin and Yang.  <br>  <br>  As much as you can love somone, you can hate them just the same.  <br>  <br>  If you love somone, they can hurt you more than somone who you do not love.

7LBhizfiaa	Following your instincts by slowing down will keep you from getting hurt.  If this guy is so fast that he cannot slow down for someone he really likes, then he was only interested in one thing.<br>  <br>  You have your body and heart to protect.  He's let you know from his comments what he is interested in...if he's interested in your heart, he will slow it down and clean up his comments.|`|0Z50p1qWaa	hes stupid<br>  find someone better<br>  you deserve someone who isnt a man whore.|`|8Q7sbrv0aa	I would point out first that men really do have two centers from which motivations are spawned for any action. The first would be his conscious "center." That would be his brain, in which he has collected information and established, or failed to establish, some form of ethics, goals (long term or short), standards, etc. Notice that all of these are "thought" about at one point in time or another. The second "center" is his id, animal instincts, unconscious desires, emotions, etc. These are not necessarily considered.<br>  <br>  The two can, and often do, act independently of one another.<br>  <br>  What you are asking about is his motive for his actions. "Why" is always the hardest thing to answer, even for the person who harbors the motivation.<br>  <br>  There are 3 possiblities I would consider probable, all of which could be wrong. 1st is libido. The "hit it and quit" you refer to. If he is interested in you at all for anything besides merely hanging out then sexual attraction is most likely there. How many people do you think consider dating someone that they are not sexually attracted to? This should be obvious to some degree. Sex alone could obviously be his motivation.<br>  <br>  2nd would be a conscious desire to pursue a long standing relationship with you. The chances of this being so increase slightly with age, so if he is under 20 it is not likely. Don't misunderstand though, it is possible. I doubt he is motivated by this and not the 1st as well, but again I suppose it's possible.<br>  <br>  3rd is the possiblity of both the 1st and 2nd. He has an interest in you from both physical attraction and conscious "standards" (for lack of a better word.) This is most likely the one you are wishing on a star about because the first is probably obvious, it's the second that you are unsure about and wish to decipher.<br>  <br>  Honestly, no one knows but him. Asking him will get the response he thinks you want to hear no matter what the truth is if he is a fairly typical guy. The more odd you consider him the more likely you will need to find out from him what his motives are.<br>  <br>  I would bet on the first one being true, it's the third one in question. You honestly sound young to me which leads me to make the educated guess that he too is, at the oldest, in his early 20's (more likely you are both in your teens.) In which case I would bet on his primary focus is "hitting it" without any regard for relationship or "quitting." Most guys would not consider "quitting it" before they have had "it", for all they know "it" could be the best on the planet in which case why would they "quit it?" Guys don't enter the equation planning on the quitting part. As a matter of fact They usually don't give anything much thought except the "hitting it" part. What comes after they generally just deal with as it comes.<br>  The reasons guys "quit it" obliges a very long list, but it is safe to say that part of it is nature, versus nurture.<br>  <br>  The answer you are looking for though, is:<br>  "If it feels like you're moving too fast, then you are moving too fast." Yes you are going to get hurt. Intercourse isn't the only option for a "sexual" encounter either. Consider alternative passionate endeavors. Whatever you do, don't be afraid (even in the heat of the moment)to say "no." And if he has a hard time with "stop" or "no", then you can pretty much assume safely that he only has one motivation,...that would be the first one.<br>  <br>  good luck|`|FhEoDGbgaa	ok then all what u have 2 do is just let him know his limit and dont show him that u r easy to have|`|ZZ3Wolhxaa	If he can't think of you before him, than he's not worth anything.

B6WXzAlnaa	This actually happened to me once.  My best friend was getting married and she asked me to be her maid of honor.  Then her younger sister threw a hissy fit and her mom pressured her into having her younger sister as her maid of honor.  I understood since I have a sister too but I was still hurt.  I had really been looking forward to doing all the wedding stuff with her and suddenly I was on the back burner.  I knew it was childish of me but I couldn't help but feel hurt and I did lose a little interest in the wedding plans.  I still stood up for her but I almost gagged when her sister gave this big speach at the shower about how touched and surprised she was when she was asked to be the maid of honor.  You should probably talk to your friend and ask her how she feels.  Maybe you could acknowledge her in some other way by asking her to do a very special reading.  For my wedding, we listed our wedding party in our program and wrote something special about each person and how they were important to us.  It served as a nice way to honor our friends and family.|`|ca84jI3Maa	Talk to her. It may be that she's hurt that you asked her to step down as maid of honor, or it may be that there's something else going on in her life<br>  <br>  This is one of your closest friends. You asked her to stand at your side when you get married. I think it's worth the effort to find out whether the problem is something you did, something she's decided, or something that has nothing at all to do with you or your wedding.<br>  <br>  Just keep in mind that weddings are emotional not only for the couple getting married, but for a lot of the people around them. it behoves us to be extra careful of everyone's feelings in the midst of wedding planning. Take the time to find out what's really going on before you make any decisions.|`|yGDZ1iuCaa	Can I ask why you asked her before you asked your sister in the first place?  I don't know your relationship with either so I was just curious.  I'm sure she's a little hurt that she's no longer the MOH so maybe just try and include her in everything you can like shoe shopping, lingerie shopping...stuff like that.  Make her feel as important as if she were still your MOH and hopefully she'll break out of this funk she's in.  But be patient...the bottom line is you demoted her so she's probably a little irritated even if she didn't say she was.|`|AA11380378	You offended her. You don't honor someone just to dishonour them later (indian gifiting???) .<br>  <br>  That was so rude of you and I don't blame her one bit from distancing herself from you.<br>  <br>  I'm sorry, but you are at fault. She was a lady by stepping down without a fuss, too bad that I cannot say the same thing about you.<br>  <br>  This is awful. You hurt her feelings, but you seem not to undesrtand this horrible etiquette faux pas. If I was her, I wouldn't even attend your wedding.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|SP2KK0ataa	You should definitely talk to her. Maybe she's hurt because she's not the MOH. So in that case she doesn't want to talk about it too much, but she still wants to be part of it. It never hurts to ask.|`|AA11509996	how come you asked her b4 your sister? Do you and your sister have a good relationship? if not, your friend might be feeling burned ...she might think that she has been there for you when your sister wasnt and is feeling sad and upset that you had to ask her to step down. i would understand how she could feel embarrassed even. she was probably all excited and told other ppl that she was going to be your MOH. You should talk to her. Dont assume anything. Her feelings can be legit. Shes probably just hurt cuz she wanted to be acknowledged by you on your special day.|`|CoJmCtU9aa	I would ask her to lunch and talk to her in person. No offense, but what you did is wrong, and extremely rude. She probably seemed like she took it fine because she has class and didn't want to upset you. Why on earth didn't you think about getting your wedding party situated before hand? You cannot do that to someone and think that they won't be hurt. The least you could have done was make them both Maids of Honor. I certainly hope she's giving you a hint - because if it were me, I'd seriously be questioning my friendship to you.|`|HIRYscJlaa	Well, you demoted her...she's not obligated to be as involved because she's only a bridesmaid.  I would talk to her and see what's up.|`|elsZ9ab3aa	Since you demoted her, she probably feels she just doesn't need to be as involved anymore. The MOH holds most of the responsibilities and now she might feel like she only has to show up. <br>  <br>  Have you asked how things are going in HER life? Maybe the problem is with work, her family, a guy... and not at all with this! Just a suggestion.

AA10649406	let it go,this guy isn't worth your time,  the other girl is still around because he is giving her reasons to remain around, there is more going on than he is actually telling you, it may be 4 years that she has chased him but there is some interaction going on between the two of them that is making her stick around for as long as she has, so she can fully have him to herself, if he didn't want her in his life then he could have easily said so but she is there because he wants her there regardless of your relationship with him, he obviously has no respect for you or how you feel about what he's doing and you can do alot better, so let him go and find someone who actually shows that they want to be with you...|`|XzbRZCPUaa	if he goes to her he didn love you enough and he was probably cheating on you with her anyway  ecspecialy if he was lieng about talkin to her move on girl|`|673a1462daeb057e9deae110b6258875aa	ok thi is a stalker, if she keeps this crap up call the cops and get a restraining order, let the answer machie get a few of the calls so you have evidence, and then go to the poice department and let the cop listen to them, he will help you.|`|82f5bed58788ca8d411b0bd3bd02889baa	Let it go. U can do a lot better, and if he's txtin another girl, then let it go. That's disrespect to u. U deserve way better. There is better for u, and there is life after a four yr relationship. My bf of four yrs gav a chic that lived next door to him his number and she called as we were cuddling. I confronted him about that. He didn't get the satisfaction of letting it happen again. I have to admit, u will feel pain but if u just liveone day at a time I promise some one worth ur time will come along and respect u for who u r. & if she do get with him, their relationship wont last bc God doesn't honor stuff like that. Remember if he did it to u, then he'll do it to her. "What goes around comes around again." So don't be sad about it, when u wake up every morning, say good. That's one less hard-ache u have to deal with. U r so much nicer than me, u actually called the girl...I would've found out where she stayed and lets just say she wouldn't have had the nerve to say what she said to u, but just remember, it'll come back on her. U basically don't have to react, both of them liars, let the liars flock together. God will send u some one, & u won't have to find him, he'll find u. & don't settle for the first guy that comes along either.|`|b6bdef1f70f7a01e9009a6cbdf680e5daa	If he really wants to be with you I dont think he would have said that comment. I think he does like you but maybe not enough. Also if he really loved you he would make that other girl disapeare within a heart beat. believe me. If you love someone then other people shouldnt be an issue and if some girl is bothering him or you he would have told her off or put a restraining order on her ***. But it sounds like he likes the attention of the other girl so he never says anything to her. or possibly even worse he has cheated. He knows this other girls makes you feel uncomfortable so if he really loves you and not this other girl then he should have no problem getting rid of her and not have it being an issue in your relationship. Its not like he needs to talk to her anyway right. If I knew my boyfriend were talking to some girl who really likes him and he kept on talking to her anyway then I would have known something was uop and dumped his ***. Remember trust your instincts. nobodys perfect but 4 years is a long time to keep dragging her around even though he knows it upsets you. move on you deserve better|`|uEXTYMTGaa	guys are stupid. they push away the one girl that they love because they are scared. show him that you are worth it by TRUSTING HIM. besides if he really wanted this other girl what's stopping him????

But give him the ablitly to choose if he wants her in HIS life.|`|kLHV6oFraa	honey, first of all i am soooo sorry... this girl sounds like a real *****... i  don't really know what to say but i've been there once myself...although it wasn't for four years... you're stronger than i am... anyway... apologize... i know you don't think you need to and i don't think you do either but he may not see it that way... just tell him you are sorry for overreacting and ask him to have dinner with you some time. then talk to him about why it bothers you so much. then ask him again if he would rather have you or the other girl... you'll know what to do by his answer... if not just ask it here... okay well good luck and i hope all goes well for you... you sound like a good girl and you deserve a guy as devoted to you as you are to him...|`|sKkHOtlhaa	u dont need him baby just move on get u a man thats gon treeat u right and cherish ur heart for whats its really worth some guys are jhust assholes by nature and they just aint gon change until its over but its time to end it boo if he dont respect u enough to let it go then tell him to kick rocks and move on

Sufres sindrome psicológico de ansiedad y dependencia. Es casi como el efecto de la droga, pero sin chutes. En primer lugar debes de aprender bien la lección, no para dejar de confiar, sino para andar con pies de plomo la proxima vez que te enamores. Piensa que no eres el único al que le ha pasado eso. Evita lugares en los que hayas estado con ella y trata de mantener tu mente ocupada con actividades de ocio propias. <br>  <br>  Todo el mundo tenemos grandes aficiones que nos podemos permitir y estoy seguro que tu también las tienes. Vete de viaje y conoce mundo si puedes. <br>  <br>  La mente es muy fuerte pero si gracias a lo que te ha pasado has aprendido a seleccionar mejor tus amores, puedes sentirte orgulloso. No hay nada mejor que verlo desde el exterior como un espectador para ser mas optimista. Mira a tu alrededor y verás la cantidad de personas que les pasan cosas incluso peores. Aprende y no vuelvas a dejarque te pisoteen. <br>  <br>  Hay un truquito para evitar en lo posible que te vuelva a suceder esto. jeje. Cuanto mas dificil sea conquistar a una mujer, mas dificil será que te enga?e con otro. Y esto es bien cierto. Lo que no quiere decir que si eres un ga?án no la pierdas por tu forma de ser (en este caso, la unica solución es cambiar uno mismo) <br>  <br>  Cambia tu táctica de acoso y derribo a algo mas sutil y paciente.

AA10387487	Start arranging casual get-togethers outside of work. It doesn't have to be just the two of you if you are nervous about it. Make it a group activity with friends (his, yours, mutual, etc.). Go play miniature golf, go to an amusement park, go bowling, roller blading/skating, fishing, surfing, etc. Spending time together away from the workplace and the computer will help you get to know each other better and decide if a relationship is what you really want to pursue. You may find that you value his friendship more than the possibility of being romantic with him and vice versa.<br>  <br>   If the casual outings do lead to something more, like actual dates and romance, then you've both still gotten something positive and joyful out of the situation. Just don't forget where you started, and remember to value the gift of his friendship as much as his love.

AA11823581	Guys are different and each one has a different way of showing if they are interested or not, i guess you just have to let time do the talking. As time goes by pay attention to his way of being with you and of his actions towards you. Only you will be able to decide whether he is interested in you.|`|g29k2CgVaa	well believe me u cant....!!!!!!!!!!!|`|bc06bfa5e6e290d86d60dd98ef424b1faa	Interested?  When he gives his attention to you despite other distractions.  Mixed emotions?  How sure are you?  Did he confess anything to you regarding his emotions?  Flirting?  When he knows that you have a crush on him & you are imagining that he's interested in you and that you are assuming that he has mixed emotions.  :)
EOVxYRHyaa	Hola! Mirá... todo es posible en cuestiones del corazón!!!!! claro que es posible.... el tema es que funcione. pero mi experiencia y la de la gente que me rodea... generalmente no es tan posible eso.... porque los sentimientos se mezclan, se hacen comparaciones, y uno recién termina una relación y como que es necesario un proceso, un tiempo de adaptación para luego comenzar con otra. Pero lo importante es que estes bien vos... y depende de lo que sientas.... para mí es como dificil estar con alguien, quererla, y al otro día ya querer a otra persona y demás.... como que algo no funciona bien.... salvo que con la persona que antes estabas no era lo que vos querias... y esta que conociste ahora si lo sea. suerteeeeeee y PAZZZZZZZZZZZZZ :)|`|8i8vJlGeaa	Si es posible si te sientes lista para hacerlo o por lo menos intentarlo y es una forma de poder salir de la que te ha hecho sufrir y superarlo.

IiAuqQnwaa	at work you have a constant purpose and awkward silences are more easily avoidable. you are always doing something or moving around. you are both focusing on the task at hand, and that means you automatically have something to talk about. at school there is a lot of down time at lunch and between classes when you are just mingling around. i don't really know if any of that made sense to you.... haha but i tried.
57f4b6be33d4f0172d205ce68d41b99eaa	You need to tell your friend that you are not interested in her brother.  You should probably talk with the brother and let him know your feels are not any more than friendship.  Let the brother know flat out that you are interested in the cousin and that you do not want to be the family talk.  If the brother is smart and a respectable guy he will not let the situation get our of hand.  If he is older he is probably mature enough to handle the problem as long as you are up front and honest with your words .  GOOD LUCK!|`|NWx4vZiJaa	Talk to the brother tell him you don't have feelings for him and explain whats happening. or set him up with someone else.

I0Z0XX65aa	if you guys have had admitited that you have feelings for each other or love/loved each other.<br>  <br>  then there is a chance that you two will be together some time in your life.<br>  <br>  <br>  alot of the times if u go out then you will be together for a good time.<br>  <br>  but if you do break up.you should still be best friends.because you were.and you should always be if you feel this way about each other.|`|av17mfUzaa	The only thing you guys can do is try it. Go out with each other if your already best Friends than you have a head start! So date and if it doesn't work out make sure you guys leave on good terms.<br>  You'll never know till you try!<br>  Do you want to always be thinking "what if"?

Just tell him that you don't like him like you thought you liked him, and you'd rather just continue being best friends.  You can't change how he feels, or what will happen when you tell him.  And you can't continue to date someone just because you don't want to hurt them.  But if he's really your friend he won't care that you broke up, and he'll continue being your friend.  Good luck!

CLTXRrnFaa	ahh pero claro que el sexo te favorece entre mas tengas mas estetica te veras, ven ami clinica sexual y veras que te dejamos como reyna de la primavera y las mueves bien quiza llegas hasta ser miss .<br>  hay ni?a como crees, en torno ala sexualidad existen muchos mitos, y ese es solo uno de tantos para llevarte ala cama, solo haste una pregunta, alguna vez has visto a alguna prostituta ???<br>  si no es asi date una vuelta por la merced en el df o donde haya prostitutas y dime si todas tienen cuerpo de supermodelos, no verdad las hay unos muy bien y todo lo que quieras y hay otras con cuerpos horribles, el sexo no va a formar tu cuerpo, si no imaginate las prostitutas estarian re buenas pero no es asi, que no te mientan.<br>  Por cierto cuando comienzas tu vida sexual hay muchos cambios hormonales y obvio esto cambia tu metabolismo y tus funciones corporales, pero si lo haces a una edad muy temprana en vez de ayudarte te perjudica.<br>  No me creas solo observa a aquellas ni?as golfas que andan de acostonas desde los 15 a?os, llegan alos 23, 24 y ya tienen unos cuerpos blandos amorfos y muy feos, te digo no me creas confirmalo pór ti misma que no te costara nada averiguar sobre las mas pu.ta.s de rumbo donde vives y dime si les ha servido el sexo...|`|DA0xnTEMaa	>23 Razones para hacer el amor.<br>  ><br>  ><br>  ><br>  ><br>  >1.- No se racione la pasión, dicen los expertos médicos . El sexo es divertido, excitante y una de las pocas cosas en la vida que son gratis. Le puede hacer lucir y sentir de maravilla. La celulitis, las manchas, depresión, estrés, ataque al corazón y dolores de cabeza, entre otras cosas, se pueden mejorar con un poco de amor.<br>  ><br>  >2.- El sexo es como un tratamiento de belleza . Se ha descubierto científicamente que cuando la mujer hace el amor produce doble cantidad de estrógeno, la hormona que mantiene la piel suave y le da brillo al cabello.<br>  ><br>  ><br>  >3.- Hacer el amor de un modo suave y relajado elimina las probabilidades de sufrir dermatitis, erupciones y  manchas cutáneas. El transpirar limpia los poros y es saludable para la piel.<br>  ><br>  >4.- Al copular puede quemar hasta 560 calorías , y eso  equivale a hora y media en una bicicleta.<br>  ><br>  ><br>  >5.- Es uno de los ejercicios mas completos que existen . Ejercita todos los músculos del cuerpo.<br>  ><br>  ><br>  >6.- Es una cura instantánea para la depresión leve . Hace circular la endorfina por el sistema sanguíneo, produciendo una agradable sensación de euforia y bienestar.<br>  ><br>  ><br>  >7.- El estrógeno es una hormona que retarda el proceso de la osteoporosis y puede proteger contra la Hipertensión.<br>  ><br>  ><br>  >8.- Mientras más relaciones sexuales sé tenga, mas se ofrecerán. El cuerpo sexualmente activo segrega mas cantidad de sustancias llamadas feromonas que vuelven loco al sexo opuesto.<br>  ><br>  ><br>  >9.- El sexo te hace mejor deportista. La noche antes, te permitirá dormir mejor.<br>  ><br>  ><br>  >10.- Un abrazo amoroso te ayuda a tener mas confianza en ti mismo. Saber que alguien te desea es suficiente para que tu mismo te quieras más.<br>  ><br>  ><br>  >11.- Es el mejor tranquilizante del mundo. "Diez veces mas efectivo que el valium".<br>  ><br>  ><br>  >12.- Besar a diario le alejara del consultorio dental . Besar estimula la saliva, que elimina partículas de comida de los dientes, también hace disminuir el nivel ácido que causa las caries y la placa dental.<br>  ><br>  ><br>  >13.- Alivia los dolores de cabeza. Un encuentro amoroso relaja la tensión, que constri?e los vasos sanguíneos cerebrales.<br>  ><br>  ><br>  >14.- Mucho amor puede destapar una nariz bloqueada . él sexo es un antihistamínico natural, nadie estornuda cuando hace el amor.<br>  ><br>  ><br>  >15.- Practicado con toda regularidad, él sexo mejora notablemente la salud mental. Saca a relucir las emociones, incluso la risa. Se ha comprobado que la risa alivia el estrés, eliminando el exceso de hormonas como adrenalina, y haciéndole sentir eufórico, pero calmado.<br>  ><br>  ><br>  >16.- En Suecia los funcionarios de la republica han establecido días de fiesta sexuales para que la gente "olvide las cosas apremiantes y se pueda relajar".<br>  ><br>  ><br>  >17.- El frecuente contacto sexual hace los labios mas besables. Les da color, mejor forma y apariencia.<br>  ><br>  ><br>  >18.- Si padeces de insomnio no tomes píldoras . Los cambios bioquímicas que ocurren durante el  acto sexual provocan lasitud y sue?o enseguida.<br>  ><br>  ><br>  >19.- Uno de los mejores antídotos para la tensión nerviosa es hacer el amor, se le quitara el pánico y la ansiedad.<br>  ><br>  ><br>  >20.- Si hace el amor al menos una vez a la semana , estará menos irritable y le afectara menos la  tensión diaria.<br>  ><br>  ><br>  >21.- Las noches de pasión mitigan la amenaza de  problemas cardiacos. (Siempre y cuando no sean después de una opípara cena).<br>  ><br>  ><br>  >22.- Hacer el amor puede aliviar la artritis , mejora la circulación y aumenta los glóbulos rojos.<br>  ><br>  ><br>  >23.- Hacer el amor te ayuda a prevenir la celulitis . Mejora la circulación de fluido linfático en el cuerpo. El sistema linfático se encarga de eliminar bacterias, toxinas y otras sustancias que se acumulan en el organismo, especialmente en los muslos.<br>  ><br>  >.<br>  ><br>  >.<br>  ><br>  >.<br>  ><br>  >.<br>  ><br>  >.<br>  ><br>  >.<br>  ><br>  >.<br>  ><br>  >.<br>  ><br>  >.<br>  ><br>  >.<br>  ><br>  >.<br>  ><br>  >.<br>  ><br>  ><br>  ><br>  >  Entonces... ?Que haces allí sentado(a) frente a la pc?|`|LDke8t48aa	Si ,60 calorias por minuto .(A.L.C.O).|`|cIYqtXkyaa	Cuando  una mujer comienza su vida sexual,  esta en uan etapa de muchos  cambios  animicos y hormonales,  por eso  se modifican sus formas  corporales  y su estado de animo es  buenisimo,   si es que tiene sexo placentero,  Claro que se pierden calorias! <br>  El sexo no es un salon de belleza,  es un acto de amor  que  el estar enamorada  tambien embellece a las mujeres, como consecuencia  logica,<br>  No usen el sexo para embellecerse, Simplemente  enamorense,  y disfruten la vida, Cuiden su cuerpo que es el mayor tesoro que se tiene!|`|58610ddfecb6d670036eb1923050ace6aa	Hola!

ca84jI3Maa	You have to have a license to get married, but simply having the license doesn't make you married. There must be a ceremony.<br>  <br>  The ceremony, though, may be anything from the big white wedding you're probably thinking of to a simple exchange of vows before a judge at the courthouse. Either one makes you just as married and will allow you to change your name if you choose to do so.<br>  <br>  If you choose to have a bigger do later on, it's not a wedding. Once you're married, that's it. You may, however, choose to hold a reception, reaffirm your vows, or have your church bless your marriage at a later date. In this case, you may choose to follow some of the traditions of a wedding including pretty dresses, flowers, a big cake. You would, however, leave out things like showers, bachelor's parties, and registering for gifts.<br>  <br>  Best of luck to you and your intended. I wish you every joy.|`|c720f18d5ff47be9e8559720adf278ceaa	You have to get the license and go through the Justice of the Peace at the very least.  You can have a big to do wedding later on if you so choose to do so.<br>  <br>  Good luck and thank your fiance for his service to our country!|`|f572cd9e5284c6c84045096ffbd2aeb8aa	Oh, no, honey. You can totally do the civil wedding first and then have the 'wedding celebration' or blessing later.<br>  Which is what I am doing. <br>  :)|`|39rGJ6D4aa	you apply for the licence, once it is approved (takes about a month) then you have 1 year in which to get married. Once you are married you get your certificate which you use as proof of marrige to change your name.|`|vs6pzaZyaa	It is when man and woman cleave together and become one that they are married!

That doesn't mean you have no chance, but that's a fact.<br>  <br>  If the reason, as you seem to indicate, is at least in part because he doesn't know you very well, then maybe you just need to face your fear.<br>  <br>  I'd say talk to him just like you'd talk to anyone...I think a big problem is people don't do that enough around people they like.  If you're honest and not just that, but respond how you would to anyone, even if it's something you disagree on, it'll work out better.  If you do act a certain way on purpose, and it works, then eventually when you get to know each other more, whatever thoughts you had that you didn't want him to know, because of how he might take it or whatever, will come out, and the relationship will have been better off not started.<br>  <br>  Aside from all that hogwash, I'd just swallow hard and ask him to join you for something or other...  Might be easier on you if you don't actaully call it a "date" or something, but just invite him to do something with you.  Eventually, if you're still not sure what's going on, just lay it on the table...  And regardless of his response, you'll feel better afterwards...Even if it's a no, it might hurt, but you'll know.  Agonizing over it is worse.  May not seem so now, but if you get a no after agonizing, it'll be far worse than a no before.|`|Hc1N61Z5aa	get close to him and when he looks you in the eyes and looks like hes moving closer u do the same thing and then  kiss him|`|bXbBVbSnaa	honestly... all you can do is be more outgoing, flirt a little bit.. and hope for the best. you can't really force someone to like you, you just have to do what you can.<br>  if this boy likes your friend, then don't be pushy and try to get him to notice you right away, that'll probably just make him dislike you instead. so be subtle!<br>  you could talk to your friend about it, if you two are close enough for it to not be awkward... maybe ask her to keep her distance from him, so you can have more time with him?<br>  then again, if he knows you like him... then he might not like you back, and so if that's the case then you can't really do much. you can wait, and see if his mind changes, but if he's going for your friend then he'll probably stick with her until she clearly shows she's not interested.<br>  <br>  good luck!

cacddb6ff04dcf9104db148ad0c131bbaa	Are you bitter with your boyfriend.  Sounds like he was put in a tough situation.  He probably had no idea his ex would react the way she did.  He was surprised too.  On the other hand it wasn't wise to bring someone to the house which his ex was living and they are fighting for ownership of the home.<br>  <br>  I am willing to bet, he figured since she had guys over that it would be ok if he had you over.  <br>  <br>  He is with you.  So you have no reason to be bitter with him.<br>  His family on the other hand should keep their opinions to themselves.  what does your boyfriend say about his family and his brother?  It sounds like a relationship boomed since the beginning.  If you care about this guy, you will find a way to work it out.  If not, then cut your losses and get out now.<br>  <br>  Good Luck, faith|`|0BWISHOMaa	Going through something like that is certainly rough, and I applaude you for doing it, but here's the thing, although I agree that certain things could have been handled better, it's not really your bf's fault that his ex is a nutjob.<br>  Being bitter is only giving her what she wants, you have to stop letting it bother you and enjoy your happiness, that's the only way you'll ever beat her.

I've been single for almost 2 years now and it's tough.  I think, if you never experienced love in the first place then it won't be so bad because you don't know what you are missing.  But I will never deny or say that love isn't great because it is one of the most powerful forces on the planet.  haha i think i went on a tangent.  But I think love is worth it!
0BWISHOMaa	I do agree with Pamela, he is acting a bit like a spoilt brat, but I can also see that you care about him, so my advice to you is to just let him talk.<br>  Talking about what's stressing you out is always helpful, it makes a person feel loads better.<br>  Also don't interrupt him and give him advice about things, just let him let off steam.<br>  Also, try and make him laugh, or talk about something that interests him after he's done moaning, it'll help keep his mind off of whatevers bugging him|`|4bf6fc8fb1cce3ab2092d525a3c2efbdaa	He is "stressed out" b/c his parents had him clean the house 2 times?!?!  You're joking, right?  What a whiny baby!  He needs to get over it & just help!  I'm sure he's helping to make the mess.  When he's in the "grown-up" world he's not going to be handled with kid gloves.  If something like this stresses him out God HELP HIM when he gets out on his own.  Tell him to stop whining & start cleaning!  That's the best "help" you can give him!
0BWISHOMaa	If I were you, I would show your mom this question.<br>  It's exactly what needs to be said and you're showing your understanding of your financial situation as well as you siblings, plus you're offering to pay for it.<br>  Show this question to her, I'm sure she'll be supportive.|`|cacddb6ff04dcf9104db148ad0c131bbaa	Tell your mom you have been having headaches and have been having a hard time seeing at a distance.  Tell her you think you may need glasses.<br>  <br>  Dont be afraid to tell her.  She would want to know.<br>  You are her child, she would want to help you.<br>  <br>  Good Luck, faith
cacddb6ff04dcf9104db148ad0c131bbaa	Are you dating 4 people?  If not then you really dont have to give them up since you are not involved in a relationship.  Just remain being friends.  It sounds like to me, that your infatuated with some and are confused on love.  Or it could be that you love them but not IN LOVE with all of them.<br>  <br>  Take some time and figure out what is best for you and for the other people involved.  <br>  <br>  Good Luck, faith|`|0BWISHOMaa	You label yourself a slut and get ready to party
0BWISHOMaa	You can't ask others why you had sex, only you and your friend know that.<br>  My advice to you is that if it meant nothing, just forget it ever happened and don't tell your other halves about it.|`|2J4Gqkk4aa	You might just have ,kinda given yourself away.....
0BWISHOMaa	Your mom has no right to involve you with things like this. This is between her and your father.<br>  Tell her that you don't want to get involved and that she shouldn't force you. <br>  If she tries to force you, speak to someone like a teacher about the problem.|`|gj74QGCnaa	This is between your folks. Don't get in the middle of it.
0BWISHOMaa	Are you supposed to keep a promise or are they. If the person you hurt is supposed to keep a promise, then you can probably forget about it.<br>  You didn't say what it was that you did to hurt this person, so the best advice I can give you is that yoiur appology must be equal to or larger in size than the hurt that you created.|`|DcZDBYnlaa	apologize to them.
0BWISHOMaa	If a guy can so easliy move on and cheat without so much as a warning, then this guy is not worth your time or heartbreak.<br>  I know you can't just make the pain dissapear, but don't let him see that it's affected  you. <br>  Force yourself to at least appear to be moving on, don't let him see you sad, he's not worth it.<br>  You deserve better|`|lkz9ScDIaa	the a tough 1... id probably slap him then tell him to get all his stuff out of my house...  <br>  <br>  but you gotta think he's back with the ex after 10 years.... how longs he been seeing her be hind your back
vgDtSUfoaa	You should try watching movies, playing video games (if you are into that), reading. Can you have friends over? If so maybe that would also be a good idea to keep you from getting bored. If you like hobbies you could also try some craft projects or some kind of art work.<br>  I hope it helps...|`|0BWISHOMaa	If you have a library at your school, then I suggest you take out as many books as possible, with at least one being a do-it-yourself hobby book.<br>  Writing is always fun and ask your mum to rent some movies for you.<br>  Camp out in the lounge, make costumes out of clothes that no longer fit, (ask your mom first though).<br>  The world is full of fun possibilities, you just have to be imaginative.<br>  Have a great holiday
0BWISHOMaa	Heartache is something none of us want our kids to experience, and it's the one thing that we can't protect them from.<br>  She's obviously very hurt and angry with this boy and unfortunately, at this age, there's not much reading that will change how she's feeling right now. <br>  What you have to let her know is that he's not worth her time and every moment spent thinking about him is a moment wasted.<br>  If you want to give her some reading material though, try the following wesites:<br>  www.pig-dogs.net/relationship_advice_b...<br>  www.howtohealyourbrokenheart.com<br>  Hope that helps

jNtkhOTVaa	You cannot leave him alone because you know your feelings are real and a big part of you knows he feels the same way.  Men do not invest that much time in women they are not interested in.  <br>  <br>  You cannot sleep with him because it cannot be something casual and you know it.  You do not want to be "sleeping" buddies.  You want something more... you two apparently talk all the time.  You already have more.  Therefore, it is not just about sleeping with one another. For that matter if it were I am sure he would have already made his move. <br>  <br>  It sounds like the two of you have something very real.  Nevertheless, one of you will have to make a move.  Find the courage and just tell him the truth about everything.  I know it is easier said than done.  But it seems like a much better alternative than just leaving him alone.  <br>  <br>  I guess you just have to ask yourself:  If you walk away and do not look back, will you have regrets and always wonder what could have been?  Every woman desires to be with her best friend.  <br>  <br>  If you stay friends with him but neither of you ever make a move you will continue on the same track until someone new comes into his life or someone new comes into your life.  If you want the relationship to change its course, you will have to change your direction… otherwise you risk just going round and round in circles with him. There is a chance of him taking charge... but it is a risk.  What if he does not?<br>  <br>  It just makes sense to talk to him and at least feel him out concerning his feelings for you.  If it ends badly at least you have peace of mind in knowing one way or another.  If you really think you can walk away and not have any regrets then maybe that is your answer.<br>  <br>  Good luck,  I wish you all the happiness in the world.  And honestly, I really think (just from what you have said) that the two of you have something special.|`|4A8xuKqqaa	just walk up to him, kiss him, and say: "i love you." then walk away. <br>  <br>  just do that, and leave it alone.  <br>  <br>  <br>  and ur not crazy
9c4d762a189c8f036cb003f2f0bc731caa	Of course it's hard to watch her with another guy when you want to be with her. But don't end the friendship. Even if the feelings you have for her are too much, trust me, not having her in your life will be harder to deal with than not having her in your arms.<br>  <br>  Keep the friendship and cherish it.<br>  And remember, she and the boyfriend could break up in the future.|`|ZT9VPNzBaa	yes you should stay friends with her because having friends is better than having none. although she has a boyfriend, respect her space because then you might have a chance to interact with her if she breaks up with the boy.|`|iFjNBEfGaa	if you stop, then you're still going to be torn up watching her and her boyfriend. if they dont have a stable relationship, then you could have a chance.|`|jNtkhOTVaa	I think deep down you know what you need to do.<br>  <br>  You should either tell her the truth or just back away for a while.  Honestly, if my friend had feelings for me I would much rather they just tell me honestly... even if I was with someone else.  Then I could make the decision for myself.<br>  <br>  And I'm not saying walk up to her and tell her you're in love with her and beg her to be with you.  But just tell her honestly that you have to back away because your feelings for her have gone past friendship and then let her make the call.  I know it is hard to do.  But it is hard to imagine you being a friend to her in this situation because I think a part of you will just be waiting and perhaps even hoping for the day that she breaks up with her boyfriend.  <br>  <br>  I hope it all works out for you.  And just do what you know is right.
8D4VUJy2aa	ok  i think he likes you,and her both,
liW2Nf5naa	Because they have nothing better to do than be all up in everyone else's business.  I had a neighbor like that for a while.  I think she had a screw loose in her head or something.

6de0f5c9722e499861b2b5e17bafe0c7aa	First of all, all of your information has been second hand. If you really like the guy, and he feels the same about you, what are you waiting for? Ask him out and take it from there. You'll never know anything if you don't ask! So he's not the best looking guy in school. Something about him obviously attracted you to him. Here's some friendly advice, keep everybody out of your relationships except you and your partner. It will run much smoother.

AA11412999	A whore is anyone who abuses or disrespects their body - or allows others to do so - for worldly gain.  This includes not only money, but social gain.  For example screwing the boss to get a promotion, groupies who just want to say they were in (insert celebrity's name here)'s bed, or "marrying" a rich old man with a bad cough to make good when he croaks.  A whore gives away sexual favours so that others will give her things.  This includes people who are looking for attention or approveal, although these people have a problem that should be addressed by a professional counsellor.<br>  <br>  Swingers, on the other hand, are just people who choose to throw out the rule that a marriage needs monogamy because they realize they don't need it for their relationship to be perfectly healthy.  Are there swingers who are whores?  Absolutely.  But being a swinger doesn't necessarily mean that one is a whore.  Lots of whores out there in the vanilla world, too.  Being a whore is a state of mind, an illness.  Swinging is a chosen lifestyle.|`|VN9MG1h5aa	Good answer Racer.  <br>  <br>  Whoring is a "job" and swinging is a "lifestyle".  There is a huge difference.<br>  <br>  If done and handled properly, swinging can allow that inner-slut to come out and play in a comfortable environment without fear of shame and repercussion.  There is nothing and I mean NOTHING sexier than the inner-slut coming out to play.|`|77622be92ab404409f818db551a4987aaa	No. The definition of a whore is someone who has sex for money. Swingers have sex because it's fun to have sex.  :-)

Sobre a minha vontade de dedicar um tempo para estar perto das crian?as, para orientá-los, até que o mais novo deles tenha capacidade de ir ao banheiro sozinho...<br>  Trabalhava, meio expediente, quando os 2 maiores estavam no colégio. De tarde ficava com eles. Agora que chegou a número 3 estou amamentando. E n?o vou voltar a trabalhar. Lembra da história do banheiro? <br>  Meu marido, também tem seu "sacrifício" que é nos bancar em tudo, do básico ao fútil, do essencial ao supérfluo. Ele rala...<br>  Eu continuo estudando, cursos à distancia, ou quando presencial tenho a ajuda, daqueles que sempre poderei contar pais e sogros. Afinal, quando a oportunidade bater à porta tenho que estar atualizada. Mas sempre procuro cursos noturnos, deixo as crian?as dormindo, e o trabalho é só o de olhar. Meu marido, me incentiva muito e me acompanha muitas vezes, me dá carona e fica me esperando.

Converse com alguém para bancar as mensalidades, quando vc se formar e arrumar um emprego, vc paga de volta... conversa com teu marido e com quem mais um dia vc ajudou a realizar sonhos, agora chegou a sua vez!

E voce esta confusa em saber diferenciar o que é seu sucesso. Isso é crise existencial, e todos nós passamos por isso. Temos duas possibilidades na vida: Nos dedicarmos a sermos reconhecidos pela grande sociedade; Nos dedicarmos a uma pequena sociedade, só nossa, que é a família. Nenhuma delas é melhor que a outra, mas há aquela que é mais sincera e a outra que é mais abrangente. Nossa sociedade é capitalista, ela nos induz a esquecermos de nosso lado espiritual, pois a reflex?o é sentimento perigoso. Nossos filhos seguir?o o caminho da maioria, estudar?o, trabalhar?o, e quem sabe até atinjam algum destaque. A sensa??o que temos é que seremos esquecidos. A nossa sociedade, porém, é movida pelo interesse, tornando esse reconhecimento artificial. Para eles somos descartaveis, mas para nossos familiares n?o. Voce parece ser a fonte que faz essa familia dar certo, veja pelo lado egoista em que todos "caem fora" e voce "dá for?a". As pessoas n?o s?o naturalmente egoístas como nos fazem pensar, elas só reagem conforme o mundo se apresenta. Tente passar a seus familiares principios fundamentais, o por que voce sente prazer em ajudá-los e ser boa, ensine-os a isso. Ninguém nasce sabendo essas coisas, aprende-se com as experiencias. Use a lógica, seja racional, nunca tente apenas convence-los. Todas pessoas boas s?o boas por que esperam essa troca, mas infelizmente em nossa sociedade, n?o podemos ser inteiramente bons. O que posso lhe dizer e que vale a pena tentar com quem está próximo da gente, como a familia e uns raros amigos. Saiba reconhecer quem tem capacidade disso, pois há pessoas que simplesmente n?o possuem caráter. Voce vera que n?o será esquecida, e talvez perceberá que já esta no sucesso.|`|c6a1f70aeb1f79c1c1d7bb5c5761be5caa	O que você fez de bom nessa vida?

gUnfNeObaa	Ok the key to being confident is faking it till you make. Let me explain, really examine the body language that you are giving off that may make others believe that you are shy. For example: Do you hunch over, stare and floor, or evert eye contact when walking down the halls? It's an easy fix. Pick up your shoulders, look up and take wider strides, you're looking more confident already even if your still feeling shy inside. The next step is just to simply make eye contact with others. If this is hard for you start by only looking at their foreheads and then the space between their eyes until you can really focus on their eyes. When you stand spread your legs out wide and stand tall with your hands on your hips, this will instantly make you look more confident. When talking to other people first take a deep breath, this makes your voice lower and sound more authoritative. Talk with conviction and people will be more likely to listen also remember to use your hands when talking, it will help you keep peoples attention. So when your done "faking it" you may find that you really have created confidence inside of yourself and the process will be easier and easier. Best of Luck!|`|WkA8UPflaa	I wish I knew!! I am also a senior and I have NEVER had a boyfriend. I'm shy and I know if a guy would just ask me out I would most likely go out with them. I liked this one guy for a long time but he is also shy, but if he had of just taken the chance and asked me I would have definitely said yes. So you never know. Being shy is an attractive quality, but their is a such a thing as being shy to a fault. Just don't let your shyness get in the way of you having fun your last year.|`|2rV2gXOhaa	I need more info about urself and how long u have been n the school,  and r u cute or nething?  smart?|`|72bTzXXhaa	Only you know exactly what is holding you back from being more outgoing.  The main thing is, this is your last year, so why hold back?  Once you get out of highschool, and away from the place where people laughing and picking on you is day-to-day, you'll wish you had told someone how you really felt about them.  Don't be afraid to tell a girl you think she's cute, hot, funny, attractive...  And if there's one in particular you want to go out with, and she's single, tell her.  Chances are, the girls are waiting for you.|`|DHo0zGlHaa	You have to believe in yourself. You have to think you're cool. You want to be on a good social status. I'm sure you have good, encouraging friends. They will help you. Don't be shy. Girls don't have time for shy guys, guys that don't speak up for themselves. Guys that want the girl to make the move. Plenty of girls must of had crushes on you before. But you were too shy to notice. <br>  <br>    If you mess up, you mess up. Live your life. You need to trust yourself. Plan everything out before asking a girl out, girls like it when guys are smooth, not when they're stuttering.

Depois vai ate a tua mae e lhe diga- Mae eu te amo muito e durante muito tempo tinha em meu coracao algo contra ti......relata o problema se for necessario. Depois faca uma pequena oracao a DEUS atraves de Jesus- confessando a Ele que a parti deste momento voce deixa a tua mae livre- e que o seu coracao tambem es livre desta dor, angustia, ou raiz de armagura.

O comportamento de Jesus com Maria, sua M?e, e com José, que fazia as vezes de pai, deve ser um exemplo a ser imitado por todos.<br>  <br>  Por extens?o, o quarto mandamento inclui o respeito e a obediência devidos àqueles que, sob algum aspecto, est?o constituídos em autoridade: professores, autoridades eclesiásticas e civis, a pátria etc..<br>  <br>  O cumprimento do quarto mandamento traz consigo uma recompensa: “Honra a teu pai e a tua m?e, para que se prolonguem teus dias sobre a terra que o Senhor, teu Deus, vai te dar” (êxodo, 20,12). <br>  <br>  Cara dê hoje um beijo na tua m?e.

Bom, pra tudo tem um pre?o e, a de morar sózinho, é que vc tem que arcar com todas as despesas. N?o ter com quem conversar, é outro problema mas, vc acaba acostumando.

Vivemos livres, podemos ficar pelados dentro de casa, as coisas bagun?adas dentro da nossa organiza??o desorganizada, comemos e bebemos o que quiser, n?o temos hora para sair e nem para chegar, andamos em companhia de quem bem entendermos, gastamos o que acharmos que devemos, adquirimos as nossas idiocrasias|`|20b53df1bf61a25af65f3d6d09a60b0caa	As vantagens s?o que vc tem um lugar todo seu e pode fazedr dele o que quiser, pode andar pelado, pode deixar tudo bagun?ado, pode deixar a cama sem arrumar o dia inteirinho, pode tomar água na concha de feij?o por pregui?a de lavar um copo sem que ninguém te encha o saco. Vc vai chegar a hora que quiser e sair tb e vai poder levar até lá quem quiser sem ter que dar satisfa??o.<br>  Como desvantagens vêm a solid?o em primeiro lugar, vai ter dia que vai sentir falta de ter com quem conversar e vai até querer bater um papo com a geladeira ou a televis?o. Vc vai ter que fazer as compras da casa e pagar todas as despesas. Vc vai ter que se virar com a roupa e a limpeza da casa e nada de esperar comidinha caseira quentinha na hora. Sua roupa de cama vc vai ter que trocar. Se o chuveiro queimar ou a porta emperrar, vc vai ter que ligar pra assistência pra que eles venham arrumar.

a94b92cff3ce40968ac165e7d7ff52e1aa	If he does not love her, then he wouldn't be there with her. You need to get rid of him because he will never leave her, and he is just using you for some fun on the side. and if you think he's not sleeping with her , you're crazy. No matter what he tells you, he is. The mother of his kids will always have him, even when he has a new girlfriend she will still have him.|`|AA10373401	how do you know he does not love her?  have you met the woman and she has told you that both of them are just friends and it's OK that u are going out with him?  yeah, there's a problem alright, YOU.<br>  Just being honest.|`|7b703c5c34bc1932d9889b77339a82a8aa	Alright sweetie, get with the times.  This is 2008.  If he really does not want to live there, he does not have to.  I bet there are some apartments/houses for rent somewhere.  Don't let him feed you that line.  If he wanted to leave, kids involved or not, he could leave.  There are laws providing him with visitation rights and the mother has to comply.  <br>  Please wake up and smell the coffee--it's burning!|`|Tqq0CUA6aa	Just because he move out, it does mean he has to forget his kids. Either he moves on with you or you have to let him go. Unless you want to wait for him till his kids graduate from highschool.|`|b6LcC0CEaa	Does she know he doesn't love her? Sounds kinda sketchy to me. If he loves you, he shouldn't be living with another woman. His kids will grow to hate him more if it comes out later that he's been seeing another woman while living with their mother. He should make a break and realize that child support laws in this country entitle a paying father to see his kids, and often. He cannot lose his kids. He may see them less, but thats all. Plus, he will be happier bcuz he's with you, and they will pick up on that and be happier in return.|`|czVj74eTaa	If it were me, I'd step back and wait until he has left her.  Leaving a marriage doesn't mean losing your kids.  He has rights as a father and won't lose those rights because he's divorced or seperated.  Most guys in this situation aren't serious about leaving thier wives (from what I've heard) so I sincerely hope that he is not one of those men.  Bottom line though is that he probably should make sure he knows his rights legally regarding the children and then leave his wife.  Once that's happened you can be together and introduce yourself to the children slowly so everyone can adjust.  I hope it works out for you.|`|jRJ1BByraa	Sorry kid, but it's more than likely a con.  Good luck, though.|`|nBLBDcY6aa	If you don't have kids...it's not worth the baggage he has.  Seriously.

Lol.  This girl was trying to get me to quit smoking, so I said only if she has dinner with me...and she has to pay for dinner.  Lol.

Maybe she's just playing coy, not every woman is going to put out at your whims.  Maybe she wants you to put a little more effort forth.  Even if she doesn't, go out and have some drinks with her.  Worst case scenario is you keep a friend out of it.  Who knows, maybe she knows other girls for you if she doesn't want you.  The best stuff happens when you aren't trying for sex you know.|`|zy8tQI8maa	Just forget her and go look for a cute 20 year old woman who IS interested in kissing you.|`|Aq9eO1SAaa	yes|`|DlZJEvhFaa	Hey, for what it's worth, you are lucky. Normally, its never a good idea to get involved with someone fresh out of a long term relationship, especially a divorce. Nobody likes to be known as 'rebound man.' Count yourself lucky and close the chapter on this. And, who cares if she is playing hard to get?<br>  Anybody who skirts around the issues of intimacy isn't worth the bother.|`|f4b3b67ae1374a350f02f6af8b15321faa	Treat her like she's lucky to even get a kiss from you...she's so confused and out of the loop at this point, you could probably get her to buy you a Ferrari!!! Ride her till the wheels fall off, player!|`|pbVpoI4Paa	Under the general question, I would say, that is not always the case for an older woman to be attracted in younger guys for reasons more than just being a toyboy, but from reading about your specific situation I would say that it is too messy to be involving yourself with this woman unless you do just want to have fun with her.<br>  <br>  If she is going through all that, then she is probably feeling lonely and insecure about herself and likes to think that a younger guy would boost her confidence and she likes you enough to eye you over.<br>  <br>  I think you gave up too soon anyway, she did probably want you to chase her, but it is your call.<br>  <br>  I think you should move on and find some woman around your own age.|`|plKFnnkNaa	Get a life.  She is a looser.  Dump her and find someone your own age.

68g3ZKA4aa	Depends. Do you like anyone at this time? If you have a crush on someone and he likes you and wanted to take you to the school dance.. that will be funny. He'll see that your dancing with other guys and wouldn't want to dance with you anyone or even get mad. But, if your just going with you guy friend.. try to introduce him to you girl friends and have a wonderful time! Tip: Don't just leave him by himself though. That'll be messed up. If he's dancing with someone else, say this. " Hey, I just saw my friend over there. I'm going to go dance with him okay? " <br>  <br>  I hope this help :D|`|alv31wBlaa	go with your friend. dont go with the other guy if you dont want to because you'll be doing something you really dont wanna do while hurting his feelings.|`|HXvrDloHaa	go with the guy but make sure ur friend is there and dance with him with one of the dances so he knows that u wanna be more then friends it worked for me|`|PjM3qxwtaa	go with your friends.

35ca96dfe65df4ee3ff9a38263deb1b1aa	That depends on how bad the past relationship was.  It's very possible.<br>  <br>  When she gets like that, just give her her space.  Don't email, call, text, etc.  Or, if she's shutting you out, just say, "Okay, no problem.  Call me when you want to talk."<br>  <br>  I broke up with a guy once for the simple reason that when I told him I needed space (to study for finals) he sent me an email not a half hour later.  Then he left me a present on my doorstep.  It seems sweet, but I was busy and extremely annoyed that he wouldn't just leave me alone for a while.  I mean, I politely told him that I needed to focus on school during finals and made it clear that I'd call him in a week... but he just wouldn't go away!!!|`|bVROvLNSaa	Although you don't say how old SHE is, I would suggest counselling for her.  She is still raw and hurting and it may take years for her to process that bad relationship; counselling will give her the tools to help with that.  You seem to really care for her and your desire to do the right thing is commendable.  Take it slow, be good friends FIRST and foremost.  She needs to be able to trust again - both you and herself - and until she can, she will be on her guard constantly.  She is a victim and needs to rise above that and feel that she can take charge of her life again - she is the ONLY one that can do that.|`|DgLdf7B6aa	I have been in this girls shoes before. All you can really do is let her know you are there. In a way, no matter how wrong it sounds, it's kind of a way for her to "test" if this relationship is like others. It sounds like other guys may have let her down in the past, and by placing a wall up... she wants to know if you will do the same. Being too forceful may scare her off indefinately, but gentle reminders that let her know you're thinking of her and that you want to help her and love her in any way you can will do wonders. Good luck!|`|WkA8UPflaa	Thing really tore her up, and she probably thinks that the only reason men want to be with her is to get something from her. I say take it slow and don't try to advance yourself on her. Believe me she will show you when she is ready for more. But when she does get distant, just do things that she wouldn't expect. By her flowers and have them delivered to her house or job. Totally unexpected and she will see how great of a guy you are. Just do little things here and there and she will soon realize that you really care about her, and don't just want something in return but that you really want a relationship|`|lzooHi0Baa	I think this girl is using her "bad experience" as an excuse to let you down easy.  I assume she is as young or younger than you.   At this early stage in a person's life, it takes more than one "bad experience" to traumatize you and send you to a shrink.  That is the excuse I used whenever I realized I didn't want anything serious with a guy, it was my favorite subject as a "drama queen" that I used to be until I realized I was being more than playing dramatic but that I was playing with their feelings and I stopped the day a guy used the same method on me.    Good luck|`|zKQnNXv9aa	Well dont be to pushy with her... Like she said take it slow...<br>  Past bad relationships suck... Trust me I know... and usually there is a BIG wall that is put up...<br>  My advice as a girl... What I would like if I was back in that situation.<br>  Take her somewhere adventerous, not like the average date, movies dinner, ect. Like find a nice spot for a picnic or on a hot air balloon... Somewhere really different, and just have fun, Whatever you do dont get to physical with her, show her you can have fun and not be phsical. <br>  Good Luck<br>  And I wish you all the best

46465463e9a9114f6aea1c68a978589daa	Well, if you don't want your mother to do it then you are going to have to beat her to it and do it yourself.  If that means twice a week, so be it.<br>  <br>  The only other thing you can do is to flip your mattress over, cut a hole in it and stick your dirty clothes in there until you are ready to do them.|`|XuUbL1cnaa	she probably still think you're her little girl<br>  tell her now that you're growing up, you can take on more responsibilities and that she doesn't have to worry about it|`|AA10834511	Tell her if you don't have anything to wear than it will be your problem{if your that picky} I think its good you do your own laundry. My daughter does hers shes not picky, so when shes out and I know its going to be late I may throw some of hers in with mine or do it just to help her out.Maybe she did it today because you were out late and she wanted to help. I will tell my daughter sometimes when I am doing laundry{ I sometimes have alot} and shell tell me she has some to do ,so I let her know when am done so she can do a load.Give mom a break, we cant stop being a mom, but if it really makes you angry, than tell her it will be your problem if you don't have clean clothes!|`|VfJcsnXiaa	you go girl tell your momma to stop doing your ******* laundry hide it if you have to! us women need to be independent im the same way my momma learned not to touch my **** once i told her your momma seems hard headed but naw naw for real just tell her to stop babying you and you need to learn how to do this stuff on your own!|`|alv31wBlaa	yeahh im 14 to but my mom let me. i just told her it would take a load off of her and maybe your mom just want to hold on to the fact that your still her little girl! but your not and just tell her your growing up and you want to be more mature. good luck :D|`|e03d20389b34a4c208c3b809db27df20aa	The only thing I can think of is to hide your laundry.

3y7ShgtLaa	JJ, you know that slight fear of rejection that all of us guys feel when we want to ask a girl out? Females feel that 10 times worse. Their egos are extremely sensitive, and protecting that ego is very important to her. Remember that, always...if you hurt a chic badly, she will launch nukes!|`|c4y2bFntaa	because they dont know if you like them or if your being friendly and they like guys to make the first move and they like the guys telling them how they feel so they know. they dont want to say or do the wrong thing|`|4vIEce0Aaa	what?<br>  and guys should take the first step.<br>  it's really kind of weird for the girl to make the first move.<br>  be manly.<br>  ask her out.<br>  :]|`|4pZCnliPaa	1) Afraid of rejection!<br>  2) Boys are suppose to make the first move!|`|Mgwv5kCbaa	becuz guys always ask girls out as a joke. and its not funny u rele hurt oir feelings. guys ask girl|`|alv31wBlaa	i didnt understand your details<br>  <br>  and because some girls t h i n k that the g u y s should ask them out because its been that way for ever.|`|cWIcUGQ3aa	Because girls don't want to get hurt so they hope the guy asks them out|`|xAoE9P5Maa	'Cause girls care about their reputation and the guy she likes HAS to ask her out.

xapeC3tJaa	Even though he is frustrated with your behavior, he is being unrealistic to expect you to totaly change in only 1 week. <br>   It's not so much what you say to him to get him back, but the gradual changes you make over time.|`|e45fed8f3e6bedeaad7f718d75efa6d5aa	T_T<br>  <br>  I'm touched.<br>  <br>  I think you should:<br>  -quit smoking<br>  -quit drinking alcoholic drinks<br>  -quit doing bad stuff<br>  <br>  he might come back, you'll never know. But if he doesn't, maybe someone better will. The number one turn-off for girls are these kind of vices, so you should quit them.|`|2Gf89XR7aa	I am sorry but first of all if all you can think about is a way to get this guy back then you really aren't trying to change your ways. I know that you say you are but if the only reason you are doing it is because you want to show him that you can so this for him then you are not helping you. As soon as you get him back or maybe a couple months down the raod you will relapse because it is something that you did not want to do for you. I think that the best thing you could do right now is focus on your recovery and then if your recovery goes well he will see that you have changed without you having to prove it to him. Drugs and alcohol make you completely different, I work in corrections and see it all the time. Someone comes in all jacked up and they get sober saying that they have learned their lesson and do not want to do it again because of the place it landed them in. Then wow wouldn't you know it they come through booking again 2 months later. Work on getting yourself healthy for you and then someone will come along that makes you know that you are in a better place and you will see that your feelings can be taken to a whole other level.|`|b07be0b76912dcb91a48c4193751d1cbaa	Give it up Quick|`|pzysmzh2aa	change has to start within you. and you have to want to change. the only way to get him back is to be a better person.

7rS8suzbaa	I would go with my heart and find the woman of your dreams. Also stop stressing on the dating, join groups for the activities or fun you will have and you will find someone there who has similar interests to you.|`|8c643a48148981e73f897b3569fc6e5eaa	Arranged marriage. It's part of your culture and has worked surprisingly well for a number of years. Ask your parents to start searching for suitable partners.|`|91db6a4d486dece36cdd77acfc4a9ef9aa	You are living in a Western society now.  People here does not believe in arranged marriage.  Go find the woman of your dream.  She is out there waiting for you.|`|7x36QFwtaa	Hey bro, luv after marriage will never decieve!<br>  According 2 me u should let ur parents 2 find sumone 4 u. :)|`|AA10544075	I say you date if you want someone you can fall in love with.  It may take time but trust me it will be worth it at the end.  The idea of an arranged marriage isn't quite appealing because you won't like her or she wont like you, marriage just won't be fun, and you will fight constantly.  So go with dating, remember good things come to those who wait.  Good luck with finding love!|`|dPrVVgISaa	You're almost 30, but it's cool. Just hang out for a little bit....go to coffe shops, book store, ball games, whatever you want....let your parents suggest some girls, they probably will find someone that shares your values/cultural background...but dont agree to anything right away!|`|Dqaf2r78aa	Wow, I don't know, allot of arranged marriages work if you come from the same background and have the same morales. steeping out of that world can be too difficult. you not understanding her, she not understanding you.How open are you to other cultures? Could  a girl from a different background ever meet your expectations of a wife? think about what you want in a woman?

VtMlDUpbaa	NEVER tell him... your mind is just wandering and wondering because Spring is coming and all of this natural feelings... if hes working out be positive and encourage him by complimenting or something and focus on the positive attributes... its normal to go through phases so don't be hard on yourself and play it all off on your period as an excuse, that always works|`|caP6ZcYraa	ask him to go work out with you as an excuse for him to work out more?|`|wGdKrmrRaa	Ok... this is funny. I kind of have the same thing going on. I've been with my boyfriend for 3 years in October. He was skinny when I met him. However, he's still the perfect size of a guy.. but he's got a stomache now. Whenever I see him, I just see the damn stomache, and it sucks. <br>  The thing is, I told him... and he HATES when I tell him. I usually tell him to eat better... and he loves to eat fast food... and a lot of it. He never used to gain weight when he ate a lot... so he's continuing with his old habits.<br>  <br>  I would tell him how you feel; Just don't be mean about it. He should understand.|`|BE4CxhKwaa	Me and my girlfriend always say no secrets, no lies, always be truthful even if you know it will hurt the other person.  <br>  <br>  I think you should tell him, and the two of you can laugh about it later.|`|d6d302b925a7f6c8192055493ac9c9a8aa	Hi sometimes when we start seeing things, wrong with people our feelings are usually changing. And we get irritated but if you are sure this is not it. Then since he is working out to lose the weight., say as nice and sweet as you can . Sweetie you are beginning to look hot or something similar to that. And tell him you saw where they said the area that is as hard to lose, beside the stomach area is under the chin. And this is how they said to work that area. Hold your head back as far as you can, now try and pull your bottom teeth over your top. And hold it say till ten let go and repeat. you practice this so you can show him, can you feel that muscle ? hurts a little when you first start. But if you keep doing it, it will work I do it often. Good luck sweetie.|`|nuJku1P5aa	i think encouraging him to be healthy by working out with him or opting for healthier food on dates is one of the best things you can do. also if you have been going out of FOUR years (holy **** i could never do it lol) then you owe it to both of you to wait a while longer before doing something, don't be rash. wait it out a month, if you can and just try to do the things you love together, if you are having fun you shouldn't notice his chin. :)<br>  good luckk
VdJT7OCfaa	He still really cares about you. <br>  <br>  I still talk to a girl almost everyday that I still care about alot. <br>  <br>  Like nobody has been able to replace her, or come even close.|`|wGdKrmrRaa	What does he talk to you about?|`|bcIqUg75aa	he still cares for you.|`|ioUEr0Bcaa	You don't really say what he wants to talk about but that really doesn't matter. Obviously he has feelings for you and keeping in touch and you talking to him makes him feel better.  There is nothing wrong with talking to someone but just be careful he doesn't get the wrong idea unless you want him to.  I think its great that you are dealing with this in an adult way so talk to him in an adult way and find out why?  You don't sound like it bothers you too much but again i do feel you need to find out his reasons.|`|s7S7TNdSaa	he misses you. your relationship was probably important to him and he wants to keep just a little bit of it.
u9yFPjWqaa	Well you could have done that differntly. You probaly made him feel a little bad, But you did say you would call him back. So he knows he has a chance. If your not sure if you like him, you need to get to know him(if you just go out with him, to see if you like him, most likely things will not work out, that would be a bad idea). Call him back and tell him that you want to get to know him a little more before you go out with him...Start spending time togeather and then you will get an idea if you like him or not. A Date would be a good idea also. But remember if you dont like him after that, Dont lead him on. I hope things work out :)<br>  <br>  -WS|`|0jjTuejIaa	then do not go out with him|`|GFZZnve3aa	Give it a shot|`|Y0INIUCMaa	try to take time to talk to him and get to know him better!!<br>  you should start out as freinds and than work from there!!<br>  good luck|`|wGdKrmrRaa	Go out on a date with him once. If you don't feel anything, that's it. There's no harm in going out on a date.|`|I2KVdNsHaa	u have to figure out if u like him and then call him back|`|HZgjUguWaa	test it to see !! He didn't ask you for a wk-end getaway did he?? then a date or 2 won't hurt & you may find out he's a blast
wGdKrmrRaa	Wow, you're too young for this stuff.
CLC8bH8paa	He probably has done or been through something he doesn't want to talk to you about, and as an afterthought he decided that face to face is harder than just disappearing. Don't worry too much about it, if he's worth taking time to get over he would have considered your feelings in the first place. Reflect on your relationship, and try to find a pattern that might explain why he would do what he is doing. If you can't find one it's probably because he wasn't being real with you from the jump. Good luck, God bless.|`|NwiMvY6Eaa	This is kind of silly, if he says, I want to go dancing, you know you are going dancing so you would get on your dancing shoes.  <br>  <br>  If he says I want to break up well at that point I would say you just did.  Mail his stuff back and forget him.  I would fear that he is looking for one last fling before he goes...dont let him.  No friendship either, thats a way of saying I will keep you on my ta do list.  <br>  <br>  Let him go, Send him his stuff and do what you want to do....move on.

NwiMvY6Eaa	Its called you are a nice guy, I have the same problem.  <br>  <br>  You are too nice. Plain and simple.  <br>  <br>  The good thing is you are a genuinely nice person.<br>  The bad thing is no one cares that you are that nice person<br>  The Nice thing is that someday you will find a girl that appreciates you for being so nice and respectful.<br>  The crappy thing is that she probably will cheat on you with someone who is not nice.<br>  <br>  Thats life.|`|f343f81ef7e5ba61783a27cf4ee37a5aaa	after reading your question, I'm wondering the same thing|`|QeNNmwr1aa	R u gay???|`|a53bce9219af673cd64d4e553a66ca66aa	Maybe you are a decent guy..you are not supposed to treat anyone like an object. Go-Go girls are human too. Why not go to a real bar and ask a girl out since you have money to burn.

Treatment by girls - If you two posted these pics the issue is not visual - but it's that you lack self confidence.   <br>  second pic - I think you are cute -but your hair is to big - it makes your face look triangular.   You don't look as relaxed as the first guy - but serious is not a bad thing.  I would chat you up in a bar as well - but seriously your issues are with confidence.  If your not sure of yourself then how can you make us feel like the center of the universe?

255ce26100974169d63059eee2c13f56aa	Make sure that you don't get stupid with it and let her have access to it whenever she asks (surprise check-ups).  If you wanted it bad enough you would comply.  Then when you are 18 you can continue the use of it without a "chaperon".|`|SsmxE0f4aa	This works:<br>  -All of my friends have one<br>  -I can stay in touch with everyone and get missed assignments and stuff quicker that way then calling everyone and having no one pick up.<br>  -It will be on private, so only my friends can see it.<br>  -I won't add anyone I don't know on it, not even celebrities.<br>  -You can check it every once in a while if you want.[DO NOT LET HER HAVE UR PW. log in for her urself, u dont want her to access ur acc all the time]<br>  -My real location wont be on it.<br>  -You can look at my friend's profile...see, theres nothing inappropriate on it!<br>  <br>  <br>  Another thing, if she still says no tell her that just cause u have a myspace doesn't mean u cant trust me, and i wont even put my pictures up on it.<br>  [[well, you can put ur pics up a little later if she says yes]]lol|`|h9PVbsUBaa	all the hoes are on it!!!<br>  lol<br>  j/k|`|Ve48V97Baa	you don't need myspace, all the cool kids DONT have and if you really wanted to ,just go ahead and do it no one is stopping you|`|WTSEBPPPaa	Well my daughter wanted one and I told her that she had to be 14 according to the Myspace rules.  She is soon to be 13.  She said "I could lie on it" and I said "That's fraud." She changed her mind.  She didn't want to be a liar or a fraud.  I also believe that pervs can hide well under any disguise, even one of a hot 14 or 15 year old boy that he got a photo of from anywhere.  I don't blame your mom.  Mine won't be a popular post, but I just don't like the anonymity of the internet when combined with the naivete of most younger teens.|`|hIq0Wn56aa	How old are you? If your like under the age of 16 tell her she can check it if she wants too. If your any older than you all need to work on trust. Sounds like there is none if your older.|`|51ecfa209ff83e37a175b28fbca449beaa	nothing just get one!!! that's what i did!!!|`|BUrU0JiUaa	Remember moms are ALWAYS right|`|FbHJsizCaa	Find out what her objections to it are so you know what it is you're trying to prove wrong. Let her know that you know how to stay safe on the internet. Also, when you're making your points, don't pester her to much or act childish. That will just make her more likely to say no.|`|GwV69lX0aa	girl i know what youre going through. {because at first my mom would not let me get a myspace,nut i do now.}well i just begged and begged until she finally said yes. i couldnt sneak one because my mom is the nosey kind,so she wouldve tried to find oout if i had one. plus she has one of her own. i understand what people say about the bad people on there,but what i do is if i dont know someone,i dnt talk to them.just talk to people that you know and everything will turn out okay. so ask your mom a few more times.|`|RC6dS1Cxaa	ok..........ure mom is your mom.....my mom wont care if i have a  myspace but i dont know about yours......... just ask her openly!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Surprise, surprise. I only get 200 texts per month, too! I have tried many things on my mom and none of them worked. Though, they might work for your mother. Let's see...<br>  1.) Show her a friend's myspace. Show her how NOBODY can see any information about you except for your picture and display name. ( and location but, hey, who put's their location on, anyway?)<br>  2.) Tell her you will give her your password for security reasons<br>  3.) Tell her to talk to other mothers whose children have myspaces. See if that can loosen her up.<br>  Good Luck! Hope this helped.|`|wxhK5xKVaa	Your mother is trying to protect you, but tell her that you are not an idiot, you will not talk to people whose profile you don't know. and you will only use it for school friends. That might be the only way
tsQeUbrUaa	You should ask him. I would. Funny story. I waited for my x to c**, and the lights were off, next thing you know, he shot me in my eye! But I think that was the funniest thing that ever happened during sex to me! idk. But if your comfortable having sex with him. You shouldnt be afraid to ask him a question.|`|61vktzhkaa	he probably thinks you don't like it in your mouth so he was considerate and didn't do it.|`|XIrwcr5Raa	I think its a politeness thing.  And since it hasn't happened too often, he's probably thinking you weren't quite ready for that just yet.  If you are, the next time you are giving him head, tell him you want him to finish in your mouth.  He'll probably be really excited about that.|`|hIY80Suyaa	*** ur boyfriend is DAM lucky i wish my lady would do that<br>  well she gives me head but not bouth after one another<br>  <br>  umm..well i guess he dint wanna *** on you.<br>  maybe it fealt like he was going to and we wasent|`|dXbnNWplaa	well if you stopped then obviously you didnt finish him off.|`|e19fe39acd1c37058ee08632374a3219aa	there is an easy way to tell if he enjoyed it, did he *** right after he pulled your head away? if so then he enjoyed it! If he had to masterbate for a minute or so to get off then he probably didnt enjoy it . In either situation you should ask him how he likes it done and remember practice makes perfect!|`|eOkDrLTqaa	lol probably the thought of the fact that he wants to kiss your lips and he puts his toungue in your mouth.<br>  he doesn't want to taste his own c**<br>  that's just grimey|`|lQLiJlejaa	He probly just didn't want to blow his load in your mouth. Trust me, it isn't a nice taste, especially when you aren't expecting it.<br>  <br>  If you're concerned he wasn't enjoying it, just ask him! He'll tell you.  Try asking him "Did you enjoy the oral, anything you want me to try next time?"|`|9YlQ5HEhaa	You could ask him. Some guys assume a woman doesn't want it in her mouth, which is sad because really they should ask first. I personally like that. I think it is rude for him to move your head though, and he shouldn't do it. Tell him how you feel and if it was because of not wanting to come in your mouth, next time he could tell you and you could move your own head?|`|vtmvud6eaa	He was being nice. If you don't think you'll mind the taste tell him that your willing to try it. (PS what he eats affects the taste make sure he doesn't eat garlic Double Yuck!)

erGjTgKmaa	I think you might need to spice it up a little. Try different positions and communicate, what feels good for her. I would say maybe it is something with her birth control, she could talk to her doctor about it and maybe they could put her on a different kind. I don't think it is necessarily you or her; maybe you both are just thinking too much and not letting it happen. Try a few different positions; invest in a karma sutra book. You just need to see what works for her. Have you ever tried with her on top? It surprisingly helps with feelings for the female and it might help to get to her g-sport more. There are a lot of women that have these types of problems, I hear about it all the time. I would just not stress about it, things will not always be perfect but communicating with her will help to get to a place where both of you can be happy.|`|AA10116824	wait till over 21.then use lubication and you use comdon and she use pill.what is the hurry on sex.you have your whole life for sex.and no oral sex.so gross.good luck.|`|2xQuaZHwaa	Most likely its stress or something that's on her mind.|`|JWXZGHHTaa	your head between her thighs|`|TISMxFOfaa	.

Is she taking birth control pills by any chance? If so, I suggest that she discuss this with her doctor. Birth control pills contain various levels of hormones that can have many crazy effects on women's bodies. If she will consult with her doctor, there are so many different brands out there that she can try, 'til she finds the one that works best for her. (and for you)<br>  Best of Luck to you both!|`|ZIDwZTuWaa	Ha.

I would go ahead and try to rule that out first--maybe she can change her prescription, there are different types of BC with different combinations of hormones in them.  In fact, that really probably is most likely the case, so don't worry about it too much.

Carry a tray around and offer to get drinks or food for the girls you want to converse with.<br>  Or carry a crazy umbrella around with you. <br>  Really great shades are a must, and/or a funny hat or even a lady's bathing cap.<br>  Whatever you end up doing to attract attention, be sure you have fun!

AA10373401	from a person who ended up marrying and divorcing a friend since first grade, I should tell you that it's not worth it.  if it works great, but if it doesn't then there's a lot more to loose.|`|Qpb6kam2aa	Go with whoever you like more.<br>  :D|`|YssKhHqJaa	Ok well i think that you should give your friend a chance see nothing in life is certain and almost everything we do is risky but when you know someone who feels they honestly like you for who you are and not who they want you to be its definately worth the risk and you shouldn't pass up something like this.|`|8jOhiBnraa	well how about this if you dont truly like then to the point where you think you could be with them for ever or if you think it may be just a week or two type of thing then dont even go outwith ether of them because there would be no purpus or you could tri asking your self why you like them if its just for looks or for more than that.|`|AA11317051	i'm going out with a guy that i knew since kindergarten. we've been going out for 9 months now. i only kinda liked him before because wer were friends and even when he asked me out i only kinda liked him. now i love him so i think you should go out with your friend if you like him at all and see what happens. good luck!|`|fDSiBDLDaa	a tough one<br>  sometimes we are ment to be friends and nothing more and when it gets into dating we destroy the friendship.<br>    On the other hand since he said he wants to ask you out, it seems he is shy yet really likes you.  So he kinda asked you out first, and is waiting for you to kinda say lets go out.<br>   Others can tell you anything, I would ask the king of kings he knows what is best for you and me.  I pray "Help me Jesus, if I am not willing to do your will, change my will so I will be willing to do it."<br>   with respect and honor. <br>  <br>  Revelation 3:19&20 Jesus says "I love you and knock on your heart door to come in, and be your friend, if you repent and ask me in." John 3 repent of sin and be born again." Jesus Christ.<br>  Jesus speaks from heaven Revelation 1:1 chapter 1 verse 1 & 3:19&20 "I love you and ask you to repent of sin quickly. Behold I stand/I am at your heart door and knock to come in, ask me in and i will and be your friend."<br>  good prayer=toi keo ai vao long/trong tham tam Jesus (i draw you near to my heart Jesus), toi rat lay lam tiec/toi goi la<br>  co mac toi tay dinh (I am sorry for my sins) hay tha loi cho toi (forgive me) than voi (be my friend) amen<br>  <br>  I am growing Easter lilly 3 blooms, 1 for u princess, & put it into your heart for happy and it smells like heaven<br>  <br>  happy weekend to you|`|7iJIPmIMaa	Maybe a tall man who is dumb may show some light? What's important is the personality and how he makes you feel, and how he respects you.|`|NZlkjqEdaa	go for who makes you feel right|`|8aWSJOD2aa	I THINK YOU SHOULD GOO FOR IT IF IT FEEL RIGHT TO YOU
FpbB0IyXaa	So you wanna have sex with some guy and get preggo or diseased at 16? good luck with that.|`|AA10373401	sounds like an airhead problem on ur part, and am not in any way trying to make fun of you.  If ur not allowed, then don't.|`|782c5071618c83bae5ddf2e29b433262aa	Well... how old are you now???|`|eg7nowjSaa	i had a boyfriend at the age of 11 - of course we didnt do anything (prob cuz we didnt know how back then LOL) but enywaiz im not allowed a bf either until i turn 18 (according to my parents) but im just like watevaz n have one secretly...<br>  do wat u want jus dont fall pregs n there shudnt realli be a prob :)xx|`|qUfdnrC9aa	let me answer dis. personally.<br>  i asked out one of my sisters friends after meeting her for the first time the day before ( i asked her out ) anyways.<br>  she WASNT allowed a boyfriend.<br>  im a 'bad boy'. i do stuff which most girl's parents would hav a fit over.<br>  she was a goody goody, and innocent. her parents found out, and she got into total sh*t.<br>   the answer is... up to u. are u willin to keep it a secret, only to be broken apart from ur boyfriend coz of ur parents?<br>  <br>  ~good luck|`|IPJt28xpaa	well, it's your decision. you can choose to override your parents decision or follow it.<br>  i know myself that i would probably take him as a boyfriend.<br>  but in the long run is to tell him the truth; that you cant date till youre sixteen.<br>  and for him to wait would show great sign of a great future boyfriend.|`|Qz6LoSFlaa	That's sort of silly... not having a boyfriend until 16 and all.  But I suppose I see where that may be coming from... the whole raging hormones bit.<br>  <br>  Talk with your parents about it.  Perhaps they'll agree to it if you allow them to chaperone.... and then, if you're still together at 16, then you could take things to a more serious level and try out the actualy "dating" scene|`|uBSxTD5Saa	umm how old are you???<br>  <br>  to tell the truth even tho its bad to go against your parents i would! lol and i have my parents said im not alloud one untill i finish high school so around 18 and ive had boyfriends for ages i mean we all need our secrets right n you gotta have fun n stuff when your young!<br>  i would just do it any way!<br>  go get him ; )|`|01snxQf6aa	I believe you should. There's many places you guys can hang out other then your home. Like school, movies, mall, other friends houses. Don't keep your parents beliefs from stopping you from loving someone. Hope this helps! =]|`|SXO9ZhZTaa	It will probably go bad for you if your parents find out.|`|j0O3QYbqaa	jus be friends for sometime n then after 16 he can become ya bf|`|Np3ISFTGaa	just do it ur parents wont find out|`|HfTESJcnaa	how old are u?
MpzmnbCZaa	didnt u just ask this question or am was it somone else?|`|AA10373401	Paranoid schizo can cause a person to have a feeling of granduer or persecussion.  In granduer, they can feel as high as being God.  God, in many religion, is giver and TAKER of life.  In persecusion, the person can feel that someone is out to get him/her, and the natural instinct of a person is self preservation at all cost, even that of others.  you get the point now?
fIKJ7gskaa	I agree. Tell him and if your friend gets mad at you then shes just mad that u were the smart one and didnt wait. So what if he doesnt like you back too. There are other fish in the sea. Just get back up dust yourself off and keep walking. Sure its harder than it sounds but that doesnt mean its not impossible. Good Luck.|`|FCw0EjDxaa	well you should tell him you like him. I mean he put him arm around you! and about your friend liking him too, that shouldn't stop you! so wat you loose your chance and he goes out with her! And it dosn't have to be face to face. just text him or something. Or ask a friend to ask him if he likes you. hope i helped! ;)|`|Wd78foeKaa	he must  have a thing for you if he puts his arms around you at the movies<br>  i think you should tell him that you like him<br>  (or you should ask him does he like you)|`|6pBX1Gluaa	go for it.<br>  you never know what could happen.|`|ddVBywfUaa	if you dont tell him how you feel he will go for other girls, but never forget you. he is obviously interested in you, not your friend. tell him you like him, and if it upsets your friend then she is not  a true friend, true friend wouldnt care. and when he texts you or puts your arm around you go with it, if you dont he will think you arnt interested and stop thinking about you.|`|xiY5jtbMaa	tell him you like him,i mean it's not like you love him.i already told this guy i have a crush on and it so happens he digs me.|`|q3NMrbYgaa	Talk to him, tell him how you feel. You'll never know until you try. If you friend gets jealous because you acted first, it's her fault|`|O87HUV4paa	yeah. tell him. it might be easy to text it to him, without telling him in person.|`|AA11904470	you never know.. i told this one girl that i liked her and she said that she likes me also.. so we might be in a relationship <br>  <br>  <br>  so yah! tell him how u feel! he just might feel the same way!|`|n91yNCesaa	tell him how you feel...if he says yes, go for it, but make sure your friend understands that a) you acted on your feelings first, and b) you have feelings too and its not always about her. if he doesnt like you, life moves on...ya it will be awkward at first but if you 2 think that ur friendship is more important than that then you should move on fine
LAUFFyJ8aa	idk buy a dildo or make an older guy buy one for you|`|xJ4ooDT4aa	Just use your finger.|`|WkA8UPflaa	Girl dont feed your flesh, meaning dont let lust take control of you.|`|YXJw5QSLaa	i think it ok that you masterbate it better than you going and having sex with popel your not sure if they have stds<br>  <br>  try foods like cucumbers, carrots, sit on the dryer while its going and no ones home.|`|9ke0wi1qaa	Use your pillow (have it slanted up)and rub up and down on it while thinking about something that turns you on|`|qRnV4mwOaa	mmmm.. i think u are to young to masterbate yet but i would suggest u use ur finger|`|9PUONQ7Jaa	I will have to say cucumber, banana,anything cylinder shaped? It is much better you masterbating than having sex :)|`|bp8EX9A1aa	use anything that will fit in there aslong as its safe..masterbation is fun....................................|`|xX1oBydFaa	hmmm buy a vibrator in a couple years. but for now just stop masturbating
AA10373401	NEVER EVER date ur best friend's exes|`|6pcCJGFtaa	well if hes moving and its only for the summer theres no point in going out with him because your friend isnt moving so it would be dumb to lose a friendship for a boy that you only went out with for a couple of months....|`|cSoqwCZSaa	your best friend is your best friend you girls will have a lot of guys come in and out of your lives <br>  but you have to remember to always stay together dont let a boy come between you two..
TrRyjKXgaa	Wow well sounds like you have trust issues but it's okay if you really want to know if he's cheating on you then make a surprise visit to his place and see whats going on or hire a P.I. (Private investigator) <br>  <br>  Good luck?|`|dd0d57e5ff24820c6981c10f9097112faa	well now we know what he 'isnt' doing:  he isnt talking to you.<br>  that's the only thing you can be sure of ...the rest is assumption, speculation.  he could be on a deserted island.  maybe he's flying jets.  hmm could be deep sea diving looking for ancient treasure.  maybe he's got 5 new girlfriends AND boyfriends and he' got 10 kids!!!|`|AA10373401	u don't, u just hope he isnt
gjX9lBBaaa	Well first you should let him get to no you better and then find out if he likes you back...! Write me back to let me know how it goes...!|`|1dqCUZ1Uaa	Ask him if he likes you. If not, move on and find someone new who loves you back.|`|eDGZsOWTaa	shoot him lol nah im playing ask him like and wait see where it goes i done it like that|`|Ez9r9Lz0aa	if he like u, he would talk you anyway, just wait....|`|AA11441704	So? What are you expecting?|`|AA10373401	have u tried askin him?|`|feb0df556be60b6ae1592e3a13327aedaa	If he doesn't, what can you  do , you cant force some one to like you, so just let it go..|`|6MLqrB3faa	eventually gotta ask or ull never know|`|ozBjELK2aa	i saw him first!!!|`|DUu2sZbmaa	Ask him.
vIQSpoovaa	Well I could claim the same thing then, being 18 and never kissing a girl, but I don't. I do sorta see myself as morally superior to most people, however it is not because of some silly reason such as being a virgin.|`|DTqkV4sfaa	I am 19, and a virgin because I am a Christian and am waiting till marriage, but also because I want my first time to be special and worth it with someone who loves me for ME.<br>  <br>  However, I dont think being a virgin makes you any more special than not being virgin, it is simply a personal choice that one makes in their life.<br>  <br>  If you're waiting for religious reasons or personal reasons, hold true to you're beliefs/yourself, but if you're waiting for sex just because it makes you better than anyone else, thats stupid.<br>  I'm not saying go have sex, but still...<br>  <br>  You are not better than anyone else for not having sex. Its a personal choice. And as for avoiding kissing, I have kissed a guy, not for a long time, long before I became a Christian but if given the chance to kiss a guy I liked who was my boyfriend, I would do it. There is nothing wrong with kissing, its what happens after the kissing that makes the difference (ie, guy touching you in private parts whilst kissing etc).<br>  <br>  It depends on you're personal and religious beliefs, and what they mean to you.|`|YzSXm73Qaa	you shouldn't worry about what others think<br>  i say it is awesome that you have kept to what you believe and  the power to ya<br>  but idk what you mean by morally superior<br>  sorry|`|X5fCaaf9aa	You can stay on your self erected pedestal, but its lonely there. You are not  morally superior, because that would be placing your own value system on everyone, and to be honest, who the hell are you?|`|aDyoWTY5aa	Defiled? Hmmmmm|`|DUu2sZbmaa	Just because you cant get any, doesnt mean you shouldnt.|`|5d5b2dcdde07da94a6e5f2a73d65b998aa	Not necessarily. Just because you've had a hard time getting laid and just because you've suppressed your human instincts, doesn't mean that you're morally superior to someone who has an easy time getting laid and someone who's honest with themselves.|`|PK2mFkQ5aa	thats the kind of attitude i cant stand. celibacy is fine, saving yourself for someone special is terrific, but to try and use that as a fact that you are better than anyone that doesnt, thats just screwed up. you are not morally better, in fact, i bet you are stuck up, which may mean the opposite.|`|QMObd9kaaa	No, chastity does not mean the moral high ground.  On the contrary, I think that your lack of physical interaction removes you from people in a bad way. <br>  <br>  Human beings are meant to be tactile, and touch and gesture often communicate thoughts or feelings that words or looks cannot.  If you still do not know how to use these nuances of communication, you'll be at something of a disadvantage when you realize that, in order to really find love, you need to get your hands a little dirty.  <br>  <br>  Enjoy going through all the social awkwardness of a teenager until you're 30!|`|f2ec926ce6206d4381143c6ad93b2768aa	lol no honey, you aren't any more special than anyone else. Get off your high horse or you'll be spending eternity by yourself, all undefiled.|`|AA10373401	quite the contrary it make u morally inferior|`|DG4A8S6Baa	Oh, get off the cross.
Pjq72F59aa	I have had experience with this my self as a teenager dating. I believe that you may have to make him feel more comfortable around you. get to know each other a little bit more. Physical connections should come later. Breaking up with him because of the awkwardness was probably not the best thing in the world as it would cause more awkwardness in the future. I suggest you bring more communication into your relationship, talk about what's bothering you and maybe he'll tell you why he's uncomfortable.|`|896e1d48f07e0d033cd71d4de034cd02aa	Do what you want to do, not what is right by everyone else. This type of question comes up often and I have to say that the only remedy is too learn as you grow. Nothing will be perfect in a relationship. You can try to set goals and work towards them. If you are in your teens, then don't get frustrated, It is like learning to walk.|`|AA10373401	sound like u guys need to get ur heads outta u know where and realize that no one cares what u 2 do.  Stop acting shy around each other and be a couple.|`|VpSPg0txaa	well how old are you? cause im 17 turning 18 soon and every guy i know wants to do something.  <br>  <br>  Though when first with a girl i'm very shy also but if she made the move i'm never against it.  Also I've had forward gf's in the past and the more they made the moves the easier it was for me in the future to do so myself.  <br>  Plus if he has never done things before he can be shy cause he may not know what he is doing.  <br>  <br>  hope this helps|`|9KEBtsNTaa	Tough to really change someone, but I would just suggest really encouraging ANY aggressive behaviour.  ANYTIME he does anything, moan and show maybe even a slight over-exaggerated response.|`|K5vcC1JFaa	Get back with him the sex thing will come in time, And talk to him about it. Sex aint a death sentence once he gets into it hell love it and if he dont hes very odd.|`|DUu2sZbmaa	Just coax him into a nice makeout session. Once the first major one is out of the way, it gets easier from there.|`|Sz0nBywvaa	Open up to him. Sit down with him and explain your feelings. Say "Dont say nothing untill im finished explained" Then express yourself. <br>  <br>  If you really like him and see yourself with him for a long time dont let him go over something like this, you say he is inexperienced so bare with him! <br>  <br>  Once you sit down with him and express your feelings, maybe he will feel comfortable and express his feelings to you! <br>  <br>  Communication is a big part of relationships try it out and see how it works!|`|uOf6ilHcaa	I'm not sure if you did the right thing. They say opposites attract, and that goes with shy and outgoing. Did you talk to him about it, and tried to see if he'd make more moves? Communication is really important to solving things like that. Discuss the problems you're having with him and work it out.<br>  <br>  Edit: Johnny W, why are you saying goddamn you? All she's doing is trying to find help, not hurt anyone. What the heck is that all about?|`|m09ZoNWsaa	u need to have good communication with each other......soo maby stay friends then when u are around each other more and more it will be more comfertble for u 2 to be together
ac5mKd4caa	barely call her/ text her, doesent really give you his time<br>  unless he is wanting to hook up.... then YOU KNOW he's lost respect for you|`|AA10373401	when she start cheating on him|`|AW6PyQ4yaa	when they start talking to that girl and treating her in a disrespectful way
AA10373401	could it be that he and this other girl r just living 2gethr for the child?
Fxwc7QDOaa	Well alot of women find it flattering but if they're out of your league, they may find it creepy.|`|JxepMD88aa	yes we do ....it lets us know your interested...|`|b0af4140b671aeeb8f7f443973bea0bdaa	I am a man, but I know for a fact women LOVE it when we guys check them out.  They like to say they don't like it, but deep down they do.  It gives them a great boost in ego when you give them the eye.  Especially if the woman you are checking out is a little older.  As long as you are not oogling them or staring at their breast with mouth wide open drooling like a hungry dog, then you are still good.<br>  <br>  Word of advice as a guy:  Be subtle when checking the ladies out.  Don't make it obvious.|`|LHZze97Taa	Let me just tell you... On the real: We only like it when CUTE guys check us out, don't let it be an old fat man because EWwww.. we'll hate it. So, if you're a cutie then go ahead. Oh. and also... Don't over do it, just look at us and smile... Don't act horny, lol..|`|WkA8UPflaa	Its nice to know a guy thinks your attractive but some guys go to far and it feels like there almost undressing you with there eyes. And its definitely gross when older men or married men do it. That makes me feel so uncomfortable|`|O9cEbFU7aa	Well it depends on how you check them out. A lot of women appreciate respectful guys though.
RWDsMDCtaa	You're cute, in a unique way.  I don't think the reason you haven't gotten a date is because of your looks.<br>  <br>  Maybe you should put yourself out there more..|`|ZmeMJaQBaa	wow i can't believe you asked that, don't think like that<br>   your not ugly, girls would die  for you, but the time just hasn't come yet.<br>  i think you look really good, so it can't be your looks<br>  u do the asking not the girls|`|WkA8UPflaa	Your not ugly! You are an average looking guy. I am sure there is a girl out there just for you. Just keep asking girls out b/c if your waiting for a girl to ask you out it probably isnt going to happen. We like to be asked out first! Good luck|`|7hmr5aQfaa	you look fine. hey, you're a guy though. you should be the one asking girls out. if you're waiting for girls to approach to you and ask you out, that's probably not gonna happen!|`|AA12148838	ur not ugly..
WkA8UPflaa	I am  not a guy but I know a lot of girls who are overweight and have really hot boyfriends and then theres me I am at a really good weight and I am single and never had a serious boyfriend. I mean its about a lot more than the body!!|`|hP05mUjRaa	Yes, it does matter that you take care of your body. While most of us do not expect you to be a supermodel, we do want to know you'll take care of your own body. Otherwise it shows that if you cant take of your own body, how can you be expected to take responsibilities in other areas of your life.<br>  <br>  Also, your looks are going to be the first thing we see. If there's no attraction, it's not going to work. Obviously certain guys perfer certain looks over others.|`|K8JFhH1xaa	well pretty much, your body/looks is someone's first impression of you. so yes.|`|5nFzgcVYaa	i take care of my body and exercise everyday so i want someone who does the same. just my opinion
a6c863935284bba299d60ac888aa05edaa	Hi, and so sorry for your situation!<br>  <br>  Since she lives with her grandparents, have you considering going to her house and letting them meet you, and therefore getting to know you better?<br>  Her grandparents probably have older style ideas about dating and "courtship" in general.<br>  See if you can go over to her house for lunch on a Saturday. <br>  Bring along some chips or some cookies, or a flower planter for her Grandma. (I know this might sound silly, but this sort of thing might just impress them!)<br>  Don't be shy either. <br>  When you arrive, thank them for inviting you. Shake her Grandpa's hand. Tell them their house, or yard, looks so nice etc.....<br>  Offer to mow their lawn if they ever want the help with that.<br>  Don't even try to go to her bedroom. Don't try to be alone with her at first. <br>  If you get invited for lunch, don't linger, leave at the right time. Don't kiss her in front of them.<br>  Just be a nice guy that they can grow to like. (and trust)<br>  If you truly do like each other, gaining her grandparents trust by any means necessary will be well worth it. <br>  Keep trying to spend time with her at her house. See if you can go over there to watch a movie they all might like to watch, in the afternoon, not at night..........<br>  As they get to know you better, that will help them trust you. (I would think they really aren't trying to be mean, they are just trying to protect her.)<br>  If you are really brave, you can tell them that you would like to take her to a movie (a matinee, at first) and tell them that you will have her home a 5 or whatever....... and make sure she is home by then. This may lead to other dating opportunities. <br>  <br>  I do believe the above actions are necessary on your part if you ever want to be able to date this girl. And it sounds like you want to!<br>  <br>  As the mother of 3 daughters I can tell you that any guy that wanted to date them, had to come in to our house and met us and spend some family time in our home. I Never allowed them to run out of the house to some guy to pulled in the driveway and honked the horn! LOL!<br>  <br>  If you truly do like each other, you must gain the trust of her grandparents or you will get no where......<br>  <br>  Good Luck!!!|`|sQ4p7tktaa	well im sorry to hear that,  u definitely should respect her family and if she cant go out right now dont stress it.  If its true love it will last :)   also maybe if her family knows about u, and knows how respectful you are after time, they will give her freedoms little by little.  she basically has to earn there respect and all so she did that not u,  hope it works out for ya!|`|x38M9L1waa	The same thing happened to me. I miss my boyfriend, and I can't even email or call him. He has my cell phone #, but he still didn't call me. I had his #, but I lost it..... Anyways, you definitley shouldn't break up with her. For now, just continue to chat and email her. Tell her how much you miss her. At least you can contact her! Then when school starts, you'll be as happy as a clam to see her and I'll be happy too bcuz I'll see my bf!! Hope I helped! =D|`|w0Ta5kk0aa	You need: A pair of gasmasks<br>                   some CS gas<br>  Go to her house.Throw the CS grenades in from the windows<br>  As soon as her grandparents come out running> get in and pass her the other mask.You can talk and ****.It will be a little too hard to kiss but whatever.Its better than nothing!|`|PncKCIBQaa	sounds like a suckie relationship even though its not her fault <br>  you guys just need to talk <br>  meet sumwhere such as a park or something <br>  sumwhere here grandparent would let her go|`|zrvrhOpFaa	Go talk to her grandparents, I bet if they like you they'd let you around more often.|`|edc20700911d02d086ac4251d2d69ac4aa	sneek out of your house every night and sneed into hers every night..easy peasie :)|`|JSGnXSQHaa	While it may kill you :). jk. You should propobly wait it out, let her grandparents get to know you, get to know them. Heck, get to know HER better. You could (depending on your age!) just sit down with her parents, maybe have dinner with them (try to resit the tempation to shudder!). But, bottom line is: EARN THEIR TRUST!!. It never hurts to have her parents like you (unless they REALLY like you, then she could get very annoyed). I was in a similar situation and I made the mistake of sneaking into her house one two many times and I saw her MUCH less. AND (because mid terms and the semester were over) Her parents fuxed with her scedule so that I didn't have a SINGLE class with her!!. It also didn't help that I was christan and she was a Shite Muslim, but well....... thats life.|`|vWYqIZcjaa	First I have to say that is so sweet. I know many guys that are jerks and all they want is to get laid and if they can't see the girl they just say, "Whatever. I'll go find someone else." So, I really like how you are very attracted to this girl, which is good because...if you talk to her grandparents they may soften up or even better, involve your parents and allow them to talk to her grandparents. I know you may be thinking, "Parents? what? ew no!" but honestly, that's the best you can do. It will really help you.|`|w18Cu7L7aa	See if her grandparents will let you come over while they're there, and show them that you can be a gentleman,respectful, and how responsible you are, and maybe then they will let you go out together with set curfews, show her grandparents that you respect their decision about the matter. Hopefully they will let you guys go out together|`|PvpCU2Bdaa	you could always try spending some time with her parents/grandparents. get on their good side and they shouldn't have a problem letting you two go out. convince them you will take care of her and nothing bad will happen.<br>  <br>  if thats not going to work there is always just simply one of you sneaking out to go see each other.|`|LzsyQrXWaa	alright now im going through the same exact thing..my grandfather is predjadist and he dont like nobody but white peeps and it annoys the crap out of me..<br>  anyways if u really wanna see your gf just tell her to talk to her<br>  grandparents and ask them to give you a chance of treating your gf like a real gf and that you wont do anything stupid to hurt her.|`|8B5nPtXDaa	make her tell her grandparents that you are a really smart guy in school and you get all these awards and everything, but make it sound like she hates u. & also let her say that you offered to tutor her in something [math, science w/e] and she wants her grandparents to decide if she should take the offer.|`|9VUO2moQaa	Next time you see your gf talk to her about this issue. I think her grandparents would loosen up if you both talk to them. Like introduce yourself to her grandparents and show them that you're not a bad person and stuff. Maybe they'll rethink their strictness and loosen up a little.|`|scpYi7Gbaa	if you want to see her come over to my house...<br>  shes sitting on my hard-on right now, squeling for her daddy....<br>  <br>  yeah i said it.....<br>  <br>  what you gonna do?<br>  <br>  ******?|`|aboRP3ctaa	Be the best you can and eventually her parents will realise that you're a nice person but you must be patient and dont lose hope|`|DBBrvj5waa	i don't answer questions dat good but talk to her dating secretly isn't good either just invite her to yur house while parents arent home|`|0GYVoRp0aa	Webcam. And say to her to tell her grandparents she is going to have some shopping and later u will meet at a local supermarket.|`|1tdVrtlvaa	Try to figure things out with her grandparents.<br>  <br>  If not try going out secretly. Your Gf can tell her grandparents you guys broke up. And she want to go hang with her friends. Then she would be with you more|`|TmuLhZtyaa	go slow with her <br>  <br>  girl parent are very strict<br>  <br>  go slow<br>  <br>  she can go out to the movies with her friends or birthday party and you can be there <br>  <br>  soz fell the pain|`|WRgrJknaaa	talk it over with her grandparents. act like a little goody 2shoes and be really polite, maybe theyll consider it, but just dont beg.|`|NMYW7ZUhaa	hang in there and wait it out.|`|ATDAbzzIaa	invite her to your house|`|ZhhbbZvdaa	well i am a girl and i have the same thing. try talking to her grand parents. once they get to know you they might know how sweet or nice you are. sneaking behind their backs is not good. that is just saying bad person here. but try to talk to them. ask them if they came with you and your girl on a date than there you go. just dont kiss her in front of them. parents or gardieans wants to have their young to be safe and happy. but what you MUST do is to be your self, ask them to talk to them. if they say no than act like buddes when your over at her house, prestend to break up with her so she can tell her parents or grand parent they ruined her life. (talk to her on chat and ask her about this, about pretending to break up.) if this doesnt work try to email me on my profile!|`|d7OswsvMaa	um..meet her parents & introduce urself as some responsible guy..Thatll get em..|`|YHcyuka3aa	Since you don't want to discontinue the friendship then you'll have to respect her grandparents rules. Snicking into the house is not an option, that's just wrong. Do what you can that is okay with her Gparents and when they get acquainted with you and know IF they can trust you or not, you will be able to visit her on their okay. But if you mess up and break rules, you might as well move on!|`|Zb6T2wj4aa	Aww just understand her situation.<br>  Don't pressure her, alright?<br>  Try to get her to commit atleast ATLEAST, one hour a day. Or something like that. Or visit her more!|`|M55et6t1aa	Leeme guess.....Your 12.<br>  <br>  The Rat|`|Z4Z0IO7aaa	Keep up an e-mail relationship with her.<br>  <br>  You don't say how old you are, but I'm guessing you are 16 and she is 15.<br>  <br>  You are dangerously close to committing any of several crimes which could land you in juvenile court and possibly locked up. Being in her grandparents house without their permission is punishable by jail time.<br>  <br>  I'm talking about illegal trespass, breaking and entering, statutory rape, violation of a temporary restraining order.<br>  <br>  It is not worth jail time.<br>  <br>  And you could make things worse for her.<br>  <br>  Sty home and learn to write an English sentence using capital letters and punctuation, please.|`|eUiMXcFcaa	your relationship will go a lot smoother if her grandparents are okay with you, although sneaking around may be your only option if they're super stubborn. talk to your girlfriend and see if she'd be okay with it if you went to her house and had a talk with her grandparents. introduce yourself, be polite and respectful, and tell them why you care about their granddaughter and why you want to date her. see if they'll let you spend time together supervised at first and ask them what it will take for you to be able to take her out on dates. when they see how mature and responsible you can be it would be pretty unreasonable for them to continue keeping the two of you apart.
IljipcrFaa	it would be cute to hook back up with jessica...but since u guys are all at USC im sure that both girls are probably great smart women...if u like ur current gf stay with her...and just remain friends with jessica in case something goes wrong between  u and ur gf...but if you felt somethin when u ran into jessica in class...then it may be meant for u 2 to be together..follow ur heart..but whatever u do..dont try to be a player and talk 2 both of them...u will end up alone.|`|iIX9Bsigaa	Do you really like your new girlfriend? If you don't want to lose her then try your best to explain to her that you're not  cheating on her, which I hope you're not cause that's wrong, and that you really do want to be with her. If not then break it off with her and go for Jessica cause you know how she is since you dated her before.|`|eKUm3eRwaa	well i think that you should follow your heart if you like this jessica girl then go for it! if not then stay with your gf! i think that if your girlfriend does not trust you with her then maybe you should not be together! just think before you act!|`|6M2Ai5ynaa	if your girlfriend doesnt  trust you, then u maybe shudnt be together because relationships need trust. and lots of it|`|XgankRhEaa	Well who do you want? Make up your mind
RQwS8h0iaa	you really can't just "make" it happen, it takes time but it will happen eventually. do something to keep your mind off of it|`|FkAXKhi1aa	You can't really get over a first love, he's you're first, and he's always going to be your first, there's no changing that. For now, just get out of your house, go have fun, do something you love to take your mind off him. You deserve better, anyways! Just keep busy and stop laying around so you won't think about the situation anymore. You'll find someone better, who's worth your time, don't worry. You'll always remember him as your first love, though, just don't deny it. What doesn't kill you makes you stronger! Your heart may be broken now, but soon it will heal and all that will be left is a scar that was left by him and that get smaller as time passes. <br>  Good luck.|`|rtaGbcv3aa	Do not sit alone always be with people around you and enjoy your life build up your future n be sure about your parents would get you a match when you reach the right age do not try to jump and reach the difficult part of life loving is easy getting married is also easy but to maintain n run it smooth is the most difficult part in your life, why do you want to suffer earlier when your parents have given you the chance to enjoy. Enjoy when you have to, suffer when you have to do not suffer when you get the chance to enjoy.|`|JU5rBGKmaa	Try not to think about him when you can. It will take time but eventually it won't hurt anymore. It could take anywhere from months to a year or two unless you can find somebody new. When you find somebody a lot better you will realize that it was good that you are no longer attached to such a loser.|`|muCuMvh3aa	get over him girl. hes not worth it...u deserve someone way better my best friend has the same prob 2, shes gonna get over it (or im gonna force it out of her)<br>  bye<br>  <br>  good luck|`|XgankRhEaa	Find someone else to care about.

DKoaADgdaa	Barefoot! It's more for cleanliness though xD<br>  <br>  But walking barefoot in the grass is uh-may-zing!|`|Uny8ZUuyaa	Yes, and yes! It's silly to say, but it feels a little liberating. You wear shoes most of the day, with the exception of going to bed (when you wouldn't notice it either way)... so it's nice to go barefoot whenever you're in that comfort zone (home, grass :o).|`|O2CMaOUHaa	barefoot gives us a sense of freedom.<br>  i try to go barefoot as much as possible!!!<br>  plus, if i have a cute pedicure, thats also another great reason to show them off..|`|vYDSmapoaa	i go barefoot like all the time|`|0vWQvKPJaa	heck yes of coarse doesn't every1|`|Qu3WVz8Faa	yea i do|`|JNhMGzaPaa	uhmmm yeah i take my shoes off..haha it feels okay i guess.|`|rDnwu00saa	Yea, most of the time, and sometime's outside too.|`|WkA8UPflaa	Yes I like to  go barefoot when possible...
69e4a0516dfe2a2a32a1f5937bff7829aa	Date him? Are you also in Russia......because if not then it could be tough.....|`|WkA8UPflaa	Hmm he is hot and since it says hes 23 i am guessing thats how old he is :)! But yeah I mean he does look his age maybe a bit older. I would give him like a 8-9 hes really hot though and i would definitely date him!|`|PSyz50Hnaa	well hes to old for me but yesss|`|Ap94ANQAaa	6.<br>  <br>  Hes abit too muscley|`|AA12325049	No
AA10356453	Its ok for your ex to help you like that but I think you are selling yourself short a bit.<br>  <br>  You need to realise that he has moved on. Its normal for him to be nice to you. He is definitely keeping you as a backup! This should not be acceptable to you no matter what your heart feels.  <br>  <br>  Even if he is being nice to get with you, what about this other person he is with? She does exist and he is with her! Oh yes she does and she is not there without him wanting her to be there. He choose her. He Choose to be with her and not you. He did that already. YOU deserve soo much better than him.  This is HIS loss not yours! <br>  <br>  Why are you allowing yourself to be second in someone's life when you can be first in another person's life?<br>  <br>  Its time for you to forget about the old and in with the new. God knows you may never forget your ex for the rest of your life!! but don't tag along waiting 10 years for something that will never happen like I did.<br>  <br>  Best of luck. Life is for the living, love is for the giving.<br>  <br>   It may seem as if that is ok with you but you should give yourself more love than that. Someone who is there for you whenever you need them sounds better to me.  Forget about your ex please. Don't make the same mistake I did. I remember the day my ex got married, it had been so many long years of  hoping for me that I was without feeling or thought on that day...<br>  <br>  Today, after running away from a position I put myself in for so long finally I am married and it doesn't mean I have forgotten about him but my life is not on hold anymore for anyone and I am better for my choices!|`|fIeEVGvraa	he is the most honest guy i've heard of!<br>  saying no to your advances and admitting he sees a future with the woman he is with now; and being cavalier by offering to be friends with you.<br>  a regular  guy will seize the opportunity to have a playmate! but no, he's not a regular guy; it's your loss!<br>  better for you to move on; i don't think you can have him back. he's right.....you can't afford him!|`|UrtYm3IZaa	This may be a bit harsh...but I think he's just being nice to you to keep you on the 'list'. So if things don't work with his current girl, he'll come back to you.<br>  <br>  I think you need to stop calling him...stop any contact with him...and work on getting over it. It won't be easy, but it's better than constantly wishing he would come back to you, isn't not?|`|pdj7ZsBvaa	I personally think he's being mean. If your in love with him then don't hang around him. He likes someone else and you should move on because he knows you'd do anything for him. And saying that5 you could never afford him is messed up.|`|hrty14DEaa	i think he still has some feelings for you its hard to let go someone you loved for so long he might say he doesnt but deep down there is..... if he didnt have feelings for you dont you think he wouldnt go out of his way and get you a computer no he wouldnt....so thats a sign|`|Y8cGbmdpaa	To be honest, i think he is just being nice to you in order to keep a decent relationship. I would just continue the friendship unless being friends is too painful for you, then just call it quits...love can hurt!|`|0GhRsPhcaa	He is using you...and you're allowing it.<br>  <br>  Break out of your shell and meet a new guy; being friends with an ex is foolish, especially when they have a new love,.|`|5in1UYXOaa	Why do you keep calling him? If it is painful for you then you need to stop. You said that he is insistent that you remain in contact even though you said it is too painful for you. Did you ask him why he is so insistent upon you two remaining friends? <br>  <br>  Your best bet is to remove him from your life and move forward. The more you stay in contact with him the more it is going to hurt you and your chances of a better life. <br>  <br>  I had a similar situation with an ex over a year ago. We had to completely cut all communication because it was too painful for both of us. In the end it was best because I now have a much stronger relationship and am happy. I still miss him and think about him from time to time, but not as I would if we kept in contact.|`|AA10719339	ok first off since is spelled like this not like scents hehehehe, i think he just feels that he had strong feelings for you at one time, and probably still does but he is not in love with you any more, and does not want to get involved with you again because you broke his heart once before and maybe he thinks you just might do it again so he does not want to give up what he gots now to take another chance with you again,and he probably is in love with the person he is with now and does not think he can get that loving feeling back he had for you once before,he has moved on with his life and you should do the same, i think he feels that just being good friends with you well be enough for him and maybe that should be enough for you too, advice for you find some one new for yourself and let your ex be with the one he has fallen in love with dont ruin it for him and his new love .|`|oYa4ubyiaa	Ask yourself these questions...  Have you ever met his current girlfriend?  Does he talk to you with her in the room?  Have you ever just spend time with his girlfriend without him around?<br>  <br>  If you have met his girlfriend and like her.  Then he's just being nice to a friend.<br>  <br>  If you don't really know or like his current girlfriend, it means that he's keeping you on the back burner.  You're perfectly set up to be his break up girl.  You know, the girl you cry on her shoulder and expose a sensitive side just to get her in the sack after a breakup.  I mean, you already exposed yourself and he said no.  What more do you want?|`|AA10373401	It's normal.  I have the same kinda relationship with my Exes.  One thing you should understand is that both of you are always gonna be part of each other.  Breaking up does not mean that there weren't good times in the relationship.  I love helping my Exes because that's who i am.  If i need help, they don't hesitate to do so for me either.  Have you thought that maybe he's just a good guy?|`|ihjEAoKRaa	Sounds like he values your friendship.  He also may be keeping you as a "back-up."  Make yourself happy, but let your desire for him go.  It's not so easy, but it sounds necessary.
BewYc1hCaa	get close to him and then stay there and slowly look up into his eyes and then down at his lips for a few seconds and then back up at his eyes-usually they get the point. but if he's a little slow and doesn't get it, try whispering in his ear 'kiss me.' that WORKS.|`|OaxhMKr5aa	stare into his eyes and smile then pucker up! :)|`|60aa2c1f0300ff1e992f1bde00c32822aa	Let him do it first it's better that way~! Just sit real close to him when you are alone, and when you make long eye contact stare at his lips and then look up at him slowly~!|`|tDGDrmUKaa	Subtly touch and bite down on your bottom lip. This will direct his attention to it.<br>  Also showing your neck is a good way because it shows that you're vulnerable and innocent, and guys like being able to be your hero.<br>  You can also make it a point to wear lip gloss. It's quick, cheap, and easy to apply, and it won't rub off on him like lipstick would.<br>  Good luck, sweet pea!|`|4EEJfYlPaa	look at his lips when he talks to u but just like quick little glances and then bit ur lip in a sensual way  also try getting closer to him and then stare into his eyes in a very sweet yet sexy way and hopefully he will get the hint|`|dVIpLtqPaa	Just say " I don't feel you like me, you never show affection and you would like him to".|`|fVlBFOK9aa	he hasn't kissed you and hes your borefriend? wow.|`|X33lTHYeaa	I had tha same problem.....except it was a bet....my boyfriends shy, so i was trying 2 make him blush (which isn't possible).....didn't work.....it turned out he reversed my plan and kissed me. But i think this will help...this is what i did. Get a lil closer to him......hopefully he'll look down at u...at this point u look u at him and move a lil closer..........if he's smart at all, he'll move in for tha kiss.....|`|v2O4aQxWaa	look into his eyes, then down at his lips then bite your bottom lip or something like that.  it should give him a hint and if it doesn't, then he's pretty oblivious.<br>  if that doesn't work, i'd just go for it because if you wait around for him to make the first move, you might be waiting a while.|`|LlvXQ8wQaa	Go in for a hug, put your arms around him and press your body to his. touch your cheek to his softly and pull back enough to brush your noses slightly together.  while your doing that, make sure you mouth is close enough to his so he can feel your breath on his lips.  yep, that should do it.  um....make sure you brush first.|`|QyvEn21gaa	when ur on a date..lets say for instance the movies...during the movie be like,'' im cold''..then when he gets closer..gaze into his eyes and if he wants to kiss u.he'll lean in and kiss u. if ur at skool..right b4 u leave or waiting on the bus or watever just give him a real tight hug and then look into his eyes and smile..it shud work...|`|tal5duqFaa	Do it in like a place where the both of you are alone so he won't feel embarassed.....just run your hand over his neck and just touch the tip of your noses and just kiss him.......if pretty sure he'll kiss you back if he loves you.|`|2ibvcOoJaa	talk about kissing and how much you like it or want to try it, be in a romantic place and while your telling him this look him in the eyes, oh and don't forget to bite your lip that's sexy. Hope this helps.|`|FUHwNtVHaa	run ur tongue over ur lips and gaze into his eyes|`|ArbTevQyaa	Try saying jokingly "you know it is okay for you to kiss me"  sometimes guys will get nervous and be afraid of doing somthing wrong.

WELEJl2Yaa	If your cousin said "it doesn't matter" then you should be alright if you wear something that is dressy-casual, and by that I mean, nothing too dressy or too casual, like dress slacks and a nice shirt. Just try to wear whatever the other guests are requested to wear.|`|5Vc1e0iPaa	I would say wearing something just slightly more formal than the rest of the wedding guest will be wearing.  Not all out like the members of the bridal party but something a little nicer than you would normally wear.  Unless that is going to involve buying a new outfit, try and wear something you already have.|`|XbiMFT07aa	Because you are family and your daughter is in it doesn't mean you have to be "formal".  Dress the way she wants all the guest to dress.  If its a casual wedding then dress casual.  If you are still feeling a little on edge then ask other family members what they are wearing and plan accordingly.|`|KCvsgcqqaa	A simple, casual dress will work in any situation.

XbiMFT07aa	I agree with fizzy, you shouldnt have a proxy. that is a bit rude.  "hey we only need you in the wedding if our original can't be in it".  the wedding party should only include those who are near and dear to you and not simply people to fill a spot (i made that mistake).  When you look at your pictures 30 years from now you want to be happy with your choices.  So i would suggest putting the original guy on the program and if he can't make it so be it.  its ok if its uneven.|`|mPKDmMJoaa	I wouldn't do programs in this case, due to the nature of the situation. It is also a good way to save money. Buy better food instead.|`|757f10afa027007eb6d9e797f2776feaaa	The problem is not whose name you should write; its the fact you are having a proxy! How rude. Why not list them both and have both of them in the wedding? It is not necessary to have absolutely even sides to the wedding party. And to have proxies waiting in the shadows just so you can have even sides is silly.|`|Go0j24rPaa	First of all, I really think you HAVE TO HAVE PROGRAMS!!!  <br>  <br>  I'm planning a May wedding, and would be crazed if one of our attendants said that.  If they don't know if they can be in it, I would just exclude them (nicely of course.)  If they decide they could be in it, after you found someone else, you coulud always have them help with something else in your wedding, that is not recognized in the program. (Like decorate the car, help with Bachelor party, etc.)  Keep him included.
ogcfaBwxaa	i say keep doing what ur doing, but leave that door open...if someone else comes into ur life...then see what they have to offer. <br>  if you feel like you will only get attached more by hanging out with him, then you need to try to back off....if he really feels for you he'll come back. <br>  im sure it's tough on him having a 4 yr old boy and finishing school...a relationship isnt what he wants, but it is...he just cant balance everything at once...thats obvious....just do what you think is right...sticking it out for a year though, prolly can get tough...try talking to him, but dont pressure him at all...just be you...and if its meant to be, then all the pieces will fall into place good luck|`|79PoK1gHaa	I know what you mean my fience broke up with me. we were dating for 2 1/2 yrs then we became obsesed with each other because of me going to college but we are still friends and I wish that we could date again.

If he's worth all the trouble then work at it.  Maybe it will work out years from now and you'll be glad you did.  <br>  <br>  However, he sounds very busy and has a lot of commitments...don't be disappointed if he decides his current life and family over you.  Sounds like he is intentionally distancing himself to avoid either of you getting hurt.|`|sNTuRBYAaa	I think he is being very smart and open communicating to you about his situation.  He knows he cant maintain a relationship because of the forensic biology it is very intense subject.  So he is letting you go because it is only fair even though he still loves you.  This will also tell him if you really seriously love him you will stay and tolerate the 1 year which he has to do this way.  If not then you were not meant to be with him.  This is the give and take of relationship the price you pay to be in one.  It is not always the way you want it all the time.  Plus he is doing something constructive for his life why don't you use this year to do the same?|`|iKhy5EWzaa	He just doesn't have time. a child takes up a lot of time. <br>  <br>  It is up to you.

It's always hard to let go but you'd be doing yourself an injustice sticking around and hoping things will get better.<br>  Right now, he's got everything he needs ... he doesn't have the admin of a relationship but still gets the attention he wants ... why would he want to change it?<br>  He'll come back to you if it's supposed to be.|`|RgdTgHMuaa	Be friends with him, but be available, too. After he finishes school, there is still the need for him to find work, so you may be left waiting longer than you planned. Don't put your life on hold for anyone. He sounds like a great guy, but he can't give you the commitment that you're looking for. That's not taking anything away from him; it's just stating that the two of you have different priorities right now.|`|XbiMFT07aa	Well his reasons sound very reasonable and its fine to hang out with him but I strongly suggest you still try to date other guys.  My brother was your "forensic guy" and he told a girl the same thing.  Then while they were just friends he met another girl.  It wasn't on purpose but it just happened.  The first girl became a true friend instead of a friend with benefits and now she is stuck trying to get over my brother and he is clearly over her.........

It might be his hormones if he is at that age.  But guys can just be weird sometimes.  Back in the day when my current boyfriend was like 19 (he's 21 now) he found an unopened tampon at work.  Instead of tossing it he put it in his pocket and took it home with him.  The he ran water over it to see it poof out.  WHAT A LOSER...I know.  See it gets even weirder.<br>  <br>  Why not say, "Hey Justin...wtf?"|`|uXeGsxSVaa	Lol, yeah, puberty. You haven't got it real bad though - when I was 18, my bff Bill saw a pack of tampons in my bag and spent 3 hours playing with one - pulling it apart,a sking questions. Yes, the guys was 18|`|XbiMFT07aa	He's just going through guy changes and prob is now more interested in girls and just realized you're a girl.  This would be a good time to hang out a lil more with your girl friends until this phase passes.|`|u01JWYhPaa	sounds like he  might be wanting more or take it to the next step of your relationship|`|Ul7N6ygUaa	lol he sounds like fun! lol if it is really bothering you, ask him to stop, he will<br>  i know what your worrying about, he might be gay, but he isnt. he might just be like me - really fun and completely insane :)<br>  but seriously, dont worry, he is just secure with himself as a man|`|r587JGBuaa	my first guess is that Justin is attracted to you, but you know, there's nothing wrong with being like, "what's up, dude?" if you notice a change in behavior. put it out on the table.|`|YZhoWJacaa	He is aksing for more attention from you or he may have something going on. why don't you find out?<br>  <br>  It it better to spell out what you expect from each other.|`|jLIdXncYaa	i agree with the others, puberty. he's also probably attracted to you.
XbiMFT07aa	i would definitely pray for him...normally if someone keeps talking about suicide they are depressed but not actually going to commit it (even though they believe they want to).  Im not saying it doesnt happen though.  Continue to seek out signs of it getting worse.  If it does then I would def say try talking to him and making him realize all the positives in his life and assure him that life will get better.  We all have low points.|`|21d1f12aab8b2f3771bee2912c3e2dfdaa	Just that. Just say that you love him. That is all he needs to hear.|`|RsJHmJKYaa	Nothin is his fault and I'm gonna kick her asszz if she keeps hurting him . Let him see his girls!!  I love him and its clear that he has had it rough and that she needs to do her part to work with him!! A Gentle hand is all he needs and some cuddling!! Hes a very good man ,just a little lost!|`|2YbTY6CMaa	i would say go to him and let him know that he is loved.  also pray to God and ask God to guide him in the right direction.  in the mean time try to contact one of the suicide anonymous lines in your area and ask for advice, maybe the can help.  God Bless you and your family.|`|W2q3x3h7aa	you should call the authorities if he is serious and get him some medical help.also you should just be there for him and make sure he knows you love him|`|KlRsBt5waa	I think it's great that you're trying to offer him some support but he also needs professional support as well. I don't know what kind of plan for him was decided post discharge but he should be also receiving out patient treatment so that he does not fall into that trap again. Help him find support groups in his area so that he can deal with recovery and if he can remain sober, he can take his ex to family court to get an order of visitation so that his daughter can't be kept away from him. As a father, he has rights too. Maybe everything is too overwhelming for him so try to break things into smaller issues that he can work on. Step 1 - making a plan to stay on recovery. Step 2 - going to garage sales and thrift stores in order to find furniture to make up for what he lost (would be much more inexpensive than buying new). Step 3 - get him back on track with finances. Break down what areas he needs help with so that things can be more managable. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps...and praying for him would be good too!|`|26fcc8253f103a1972acc261fc76ff94aa	check Tony Robbin foundation<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpc-t-Uwv1I" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpc-t-Uwv...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Robbins#Anthony_Robbins_Foundation" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Rob...</a>|`|7Fc3HvrWaa	Just call 911 and report it.

XbiMFT07aa	guys have a hard time expressing their feelings.  has he always been like that? or does he usually respond differently when you ask him? if this is the norm then look for other ways he says i love you.  (i.e. going to work everyday to support your family, fixing things around the house, doing lawn work, running errands for you, sitting through movies that you know he hates.....)  these are the kinds of things guys do to say I love you without actually saying it.  they are not very verbal.  Take a look at your relationship and see if you notice any changes in him or changes that have occurred in yalls life in general....he could have alot of things on his mind and is not able to talk with you about it just yet.....|`|EW1RBhnwaa	I totally agree that there is a difference between the two.  I am in love with my hubby.... how long have you been married?|`|uI4Dspi4aa	This question makes me think of a particular quote, not sure who its by though.<br>  <br>  " If you ask someone if they are in love with you and they think about it, then the answer is no. If you love someone, you know it."|`|kdsxS2j7aa	if he cannot look you in the eyes and tell you how he truly feels then there is no use in being with him....he probaly is still in love with you but he just cannot come to admit it to himself or you so ask him again and tell him that you honestly need to know how he feels about the two of you and just see and listen to what he says.|`|4Pb8Bj3taa	i think he does love otherwise u 2 woulnt still be married.he might be afraid of how u might react or maybe over react. just spice up the love life and i think u 2 will be just fine.|`|plVXnjyVaa	all he said was that he loved me is your statement<br>  <br>  did you expect more.........................|`|8J6XaTa0aa	Yes there is a difference in loving someone and being in love. I love my husband but not in love with him, maybe ask him how he feels about you.....tell him there is a difference in being in love and loving someone and how does he feel|`|UuXHtAfkaa	Sounds like something is defenitely going on. Maybe time for marriage counseling?
XbiMFT07aa	I would say if they grow in different directions and they can't seem to understand the level that the other is on...this happens ALOT, especially if one person is more driven than the other.  The only way to fix it is to talk about it honestly or perhaps be more supportive.  Sometimes people just outgrow each other though.  Relationships are trial an error.|`|pRF5LLloaa	people fall out of love when they take the other person for granted.  You assume that they're always going to be there, and you start concentrating on yourself and not on what is needed to make love last.<br>  <br>  You need to remember that before the two of you met you were not in love. You couldn't be -- you didn't know each other. But suddenly you were introduced and he/she was the most imporant thing in the world.<br>  <br>  What changed?<br>  <br>  You can NOT do anything to change the other person. Therefore, in order to answer that question you have to change yourself.  What changed IN YOU?<br>  <br>  Again, we most commonly take the other person for granted, and forget that we need to SHOW love in order to get love.<br>  <br>  So concentrate on making yourself loveable to that other person.  Try to find out what that other person saw in you at the beginning, and try to recapture that.<br>  <br>  be careful, though, that you don't regress.  It is possible that the other person liked you because you were "bad".  You did things that were"daring" then, but not that the two of you settled down you see those things as bad and you don't want to go there again.<br>  <br>  Still, by inner inspection you can find that inside of you which is still loveable, and still loves that other person.  Bring those out of you and see if the relationship doesn;t get better.|`|8J6XaTa0aa	I wish I knew the way to fix it because I am not in love with my husband anymore and trying to figure out how to get out of it without ruining everything I have. He use to be an alcoholic and ruined my love for him with everything he did to me. Maybe try counsiling ..........It didnt help me but ya never know. Good luck|`|Xh4aSWHEaa	You don't feel feelings of love anymore when your spouse is no longer invested in meeting your needs.  Maybe if you tell the other person your needs and ask what theirs are, fulfilling them will help out.  People in love need to be the best of friends and anticipate what each other is going to need.|`|982b63b7af7d35aa88514fbe563f2b78aa	Depends on if you are not in love due to curcumstances outside or it is just that you have falled out of love. If outside<br>  forces then you need to find out how to reduce that force. ( ie if stress - then reduce, money..e.tc.)|`|p9Ya3voKaa	love, no matter how hard we try to hang onto it, sometimes fades over time for lots of different reasons. without more information, it would be hard to answer.|`|qLisuT82aa	thats a good question.  I have been going through the same thing, its sad but I feel  as if I'm not getting what I need out of my relationship, not the same interests, I'm really enjoy physical afffection( touching, kissing, etc) and my wife has no inclination to do it without provocation.  Its hard to make the judgement but overall its all yours.
j5MtfmEHaa	stop giving your wife so much money.|`|LWzrCu5caa	Is this English?<br>  <br>  I think your wife needs to cut the apron strings and make him support himself.   <br>  <br>  Also if you have a second child who is 25 and takes nothing,  how is that fair?|`|MmfMJq9Paa	don't give anyone money, enroll in an educational night course so you can learn how to properly communicate with others, so others can understand and comprehend you better, dude!, truthfully.|`|aJRP6WWYaa	Tell your son to learn to manage his money better. Fix ix so your wife don't have access to your money. Only give her what she needs to buy groceries.|`|XbiMFT07aa	whats the question?|`|Ny54eDpuaa	This is a VERY difficult question (if it's a question) to understand.  I don't think I found a punctuation mark, but anyhoo....<br>   If I did get it right, then I guess your wife keeps giving your 26 year old son money.  Does he still live at home?  If so, give him 30 days to find his own place.  If he asks why, tell him you are helping him become a man.  If your wife throws a fit tell her she can work in a nursery if she wants another baby.  For now, if she is wanting to stay married, she will cut her apron strings from around your son's neck.<br>   The next thing you do is put your wife on an allowance.  Sit her down with all the bills (mortgage, cars, utilities, goodies, etc) and show her exactly what her spending is doing to the family.  Explain that until she can prove to you that she will be more responsible with money, you are restricting her spending to $XXXX amount per month.  (Place a reasonable amount of money here.)  <br>   If you are paying insurance on vehicles for either son, stop immediately.  Tell them you paid for July but they have until September to get their own insurances.  Same with medical benefits, or any allowances.  They are grown adults.  You are grown parents.  It's time for the parents to start acting like adults.|`|eCsn0TO6aa	If you're the man of the house then it's your house.  Tell the wife she needs to stop feeding his habbits.  Cut that damn cord man.  Cut him off!  He's going to be a momma's boy for the rest of his life.  He will never move out until you take some gigantic gardening shears to that cord that is still connected to his navel.  Kick him out, that'll work.  In all seriousness though, he needs to branch out on his own.  He's 26 and just freeloads.  Get a job and move your *** out.  Set a timetable and if he doesn't meet it, buh-bye!  Hope this gives you something good to think about.|`|0806218b1494ccb623c7ee737e7199b8aa	He is very spoiled and clearly is looking for a free ride if he has his own money.  He figures why should I buy it if mommy will.  I say make him grow up and do for himself because before long he wont know how to do for himself if his mother keeps giving him everything.
jXyHnD3Zaa	Maybe because there are so few men out there that tend to their homes, their wives and their families the way men are supposed to.|`|SgOVFseaaa	You just have low self-esteem.|`|ALDXW0Jeaa	i honestly agree with you. we are just good wives.|`|5sIA8oYAaa	The main reason that this changed is the price of life. My own mother had to go back to work when I was 10, I had to take over many of the household duties. In this day it takes two incomes just to make ends meet unless the husband is very lucky in his job choice, it would be a much better world all the way around if this was no so, but you do the best you can.|`|RPT80gpWaa	I would like to know how old you are, and how long you have been married, first of all.<br>  <br>  Secondly, I have no problem whatsoever catering to my husband, provided he is the sole breadwinner of the household and my sole responsibility is the household.  Once I step out of the house into the workforce, the responsibility shifts because I cannot effectively run my household from 40 hours (plus commute) of work a week.|`|Ih18jMNyaa	The great thing about today is that women can still do that if they want too!  BUT they can also do anything else they might want to do too!<br>  <br>  My wife's desire was to have children and stay home and raise them.  She did go to college and get a teaching degree and was teaching BUT her hearts desire was to marry and have kids and stay home with them.  So now she does just that!  What can be frustrating is when people feel that her staying home is not enough! ! ! !  Heck she works harder at home then I have ever worked in the office!|`|Pv9ALQfpaa	I don't think we are meant to "serve" our husbands but I do think we are supposed to be their help mate. My husband loves the fact that I do the house work. I do it cause I don't like to live in a dirty house and someone has to do it and now I do it because it shows him that I care enough for him to do it. And he takes care of me in other ways. But as a Christian wife I am under no bounds to serve my husband like I am a slavegirl. <br>  <br>  My grandma(s) and mom all worked outside of the house (while providing a comforting home) because they had to do it to survive. And that is the trait that I will be following as well.|`|61ba79ff5c1542528d2b969d552d2fbeaa	No, my mom worked AND raised 3 good children because my dad was a jerk who went to work, blew all his money on crap and drank most of his life away.  Guess you could say I am a woman who was raised with a backbone and who believes in equality.  You are the minority in the year 2008 and it seems you are just fishing for compliments from men.|`|dD5uhH8naa	bcuz the men that we have in 2008 are not the same men that were around in the 50's and 60's so that has a lot to do with why women act the way they do|`|gvtwuiYlaa	Bridgette women today have no clue. I agree, though "he" should contribute too.|`|VrgAFQPuaa	does that include bj's?<br>  <br>  =) <br>  <br>  To a certain point, I agree with you...|`|p9Ya3voKaa	you are a rare catch indeed. I hope your husband appreciates what he has.|`|4texMkJxaa	I think we can script our own roles in marriage, whether you prefer to be working more or less, who is the primary disciplinariean, breadwinner, preparer of meals, kid dresser/bather, etc.<br>  Women are a huge part of the nation's professional workforce and as such, are more financially independent than in prior generations.  That independence tends to pervade their social behaviours as well.<br>  I believe knowledge is power and education creates opportunity.  Freedom to choose a role that is pleasing to you, with a spouse that empowers, respects, appreciates and celebrates you is the mix for a great batch of marital bliss!|`|LJ67klPraa	Hey, whatever floats your boat...<br>  <br>  ...I just pray that your A$$ wont drown during the flood because you had to make sure he had everything HE needed in order to climb aboard!|`|XbiMFT07aa	I agree with you.  Although times have changed and women are expecting men to take on more roles and a womans rational is "well since i have to work then you should do such and such".  I totally agree with catering to your husband and keeping him happy.  soooooooo many times i see moms doing everything under the sun to please their kids (buying them whatever they want, being their chauffeur, etc. ) but they do nothing like that for their husband.  its sooooooooo backwards.  men require attention and wanna know they are still the king of the castle (as long as he is indeed still meeting your needs at the same time).  alot of men are unhappy because of it and then women are upset because the man is distant.  i feel if a woman made a man feel loved and dare i say "catered to" then the man would step up on his own and help out....so women of your thinking do still exist.  and the women who don't think as we do are probably single or in unhappy relationships/marriages and wondering what they did wrong.  (not saying catering makes the relationship last all the time, sometimes people just arent meant to be..but atleast you can look back on the relationship and know that you did all you could)|`|zOwqJZKPaa	I just really like the idea of an equal partnership.  Sometimes I'll do this and sometimes he does that.  Not a partnership that dictates I'll cook and clean and he'll cut the grass and so forth.<br>  <br>  For me, it's all about just wanting to enjoy my spouse and have fun with him - not catering to his every need.|`|HqcFo3NPaa	Me and my Husband are traditional Catholics and serve in our assigned roles as Husband and wife, so yes, I agree with you.<br>  <br>  I am rare too!<br>  <br>  : )<br>  <br>  ADD On- WOW!  Reading through some of these answers ....a lot of women sound angry.  My man takes care of his family, we want for NOTHING.  I cannot think of NOT serving him.....seriously.|`|2YbTY6CMaa	If you truly believe this then you surely don't need us to remind you that you are stupid.  I believe that you should help someone not "cater" to them.  if you want to "cater" to someone then you need to be a waitress.|`|wcWIVBSsaa	I agree with you on this I think that women need to care for there men and men need to take care of the wife. I have stayed at home for 8 years I cook, clean, care for the kids and my husband. His duty's are to go to work and when he is off work care for the yard and trash. Sometimes I ask him to help me with getting my oldest daughters home work done with her if I'm tending to the smaller kids or getting dinner made. Thats is only if he is home. I think that a lot of people do it different these days because it takes two parents work and bring home enough money for the family to live off of. It almost seems like marriage is not sacred any more. People don't try as hard they are more selfish. Go ahead and give me thumbs down I really dont care its just what I believe.
XbiMFT07aa	Just talk to him for goodness sake.  you cant have a meaningful relationship without communication, direct communication!!!  tell him in plain english why you've been depressed.|`|qzWBykzgaa	If he treats you well and isn't abusive then It sounds to me like you are depressed. There is no shame in this! Depression can take hold when you are stressed (sounds like you are) and in new situations (sounds like you are). Go to your doctor and explain this to them, they will be able to give you some medication that will change your chemical imbalance. You will be amazed at how much better you will feel. I also suggest some counseling for you. For some reason your fear of losing him has made you feel insecure, which makes you act introverted (opposite of your previous personality). And now the way you are acting could cause you to lose the reason you started acting this way in the first place. Go talk to someone and get some help. Don't feel ashamed, be excited that you are taking the steps you need to improve your life!
XbiMFT07aa	this is exactly why married women or men shouldnt have close friends of the opposite sex.  it can mess with your head and make you feel things that arent even real.  stop talking to this ex crush and start trying to work it out with your husband.  marriage is tough but its a MARRIAGE not simply a dating thing.  you cant just leave when it gets rough.  you vowed to love him through good and bad times!!!!|`|ALDXW0Jeaa	first of all if you prayed to the Lord he would lead you where you need to be and i assure you it is not leaving your husband. the way you talk, you have a good honest husband and a child. why would you even question leaving that for someone you liked as a child. that is very selfish. not everyone is 100% happy in there marriage. it is called work, you have to work at a marriage. think about it.|`|aceec17b9848ac4b2d7c760bb401fa09aa	Wow you want to leave your husband for a pedofile.

Marriages aren't always "100%" good ALL the time... There will always be better days... there will always be bad days....

What makes you think this guy who you knew won't be the same way or maybe he may do something you do not like too?  Are you going to leave him too?  It is easy to find fault in a relationship than to try to resolve issues between you and your spouse.  Counseling is good for both of you or talking to your pastor after church would be good too.  You have an opinion of him and I am sure he has one of you.  Let your love come out for the one you married and it will work and marriage is work.  If it was easy, everyone would be doing it with fewer divorces right?|`|QYcog9aOaa	it seems like your husband isn't too much fun, and doesn't, bottom line, make you happy. makes you feel like a miserable person. and he doesn't listen to how you feel, and though he says he will pay attention to how he's treating you--he doesn't. you're saying here that he's not willing to change. the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and expecting different results. He might be a great person, with some habits or ways that are unfortunate-- but he doesn't sound like someone you really want, in your heart.<br>  <br>  for example: when you said you didn't have anyone else to talk to about your problems--you know that's not true! you had at least one other person you could talk to. you hadn't seen that person in years! be honest with yourself--you talked with your fantasy guy because you felt like it. it was selfish of you, and was emotional cheating. you let yourself be intimate with someone else--it was definitely flirting--the kind that undermines and degrades your husband--not like saying a cheerful hello to the postman. you've had a long-standing crush on the fantasy guy and you what-- talked to him about you and your husband? come on, you did that because you really wanted him, not your husband. or some attention. it was flirting. and a call for help. you wanted to see what another man's attention would be like--and also to see how the fantasy guy says he'll react in those situations you don't like. at least you told your husband-- then again, you were trying, at least on some level, i think, to snap your hubby out of it by pitting the two against each other.<br>  anyway, i think you need to figure out if this is a grass is greener situation-- because it sounds like an infatuation. also it doesn't seem like you respect your husband too much, and most often love and respect go hand in hand. if i were in your shoes and i thought my husband was going to be some grumpy awful guy for the rest of my years on this planet i would RUN RUN RUN! but do try to be drama-free in the process.

You still have feelings for him and are debating whether to tell, or to show.<br>  I would go with telling him about your feelings. Take this opportunity to talk about it since you will be alone.<br>  If you should decide to "show" him your feelings, you risk a sexual encounter that still may result in your bff status.<br>  If you really want a sexual encounter and are willing to accept the outcome (whatever that may be) then go for it!<br>  Best Wishes!|`|681a85c3fe88efd43a43d5dc97a3acb5aa	First of all please read the book, "Why Men Love Bitches"....the bottom line is that men are hunters.

a6c863935284bba299d60ac888aa05edaa	Hi, I would think that he might have feelings of wanting to make sure he pleases you, and be a great lover, etc (dealing with the male ego here!) especially if he knows you have a bit more experience.<br>  <br>  At first, I would let him do whatever comes naturally to him. Reassure him that you will enjoy what he does because he is the one you are making love to. Don't get all complicated and try the whole "bag of tricks". I hate to sound this way, but it is almost like, get the first couple of times out of the way.....(traditional position etc)<br>  After that you can slow down a little during foreplay. You can show him where your clit is. You can show him how to touch you just right. <br>  You can tell him how to help you have an orgasm. From there you can do all the rest of the great stuff that people do to make each other feel really good during sex, and move on to different positions, and other actions etc.<br>  <br>  I am sure you can blow his mind right now, babe. But maybe take some time to build up his confidence, and go from there.<br>  Best wishes, you are a lucky lady!|`|oUtEVKDHaa	same thing happend to me but he wasn't a virgin but sure acted like one. he was shy to top it off and didnt want to take off his clothes! heheh i knew what i was doing so i just took charge i did the things i like in bed and i knew he would like too. i asked him what he prefered and took it from there. he never complained about things i did to him so i guessed he liked it. i would ask what positions he would like to try and we did. eventually he got the hang of it. and after almost 2 years he's KINDA better i mean he isn't a stallion but i'm used to him now. so just do things like you like it. and tell him you wanna try it like this and that's it. i dont think there's any good beginner positions. maybe missionary that's pretty basic.|`|RAEEGsVdaa	lol, a guy who knows only a little about sex.

Being serious, it's nice to get a compliment, cause we guys have poor, fragile baby eggshell egos that need to be boosted, at least with a girl we just met. It's a first date, we want to make a good impression when we're supposed to be being ourselves and having a good time, so you need to loosen us up by making us our confident, cocky, asshole selves again. :D Preferably make it something unusual, like nice legs, or, I like how you shave your (whatever). :D|`|LNSUF4UMaa	It depends on the level of intimacy. Are you trying to get inside his head sexually only, or as you would as a lover. Like the lust vs love thing. <br>  <br>  Well, find a flaw that you think he might be sensitive about and turn it into something hot. For example, I've got dumbo ears, but the girl I'm with now ***GOD*** haha, she calls them love handles! Then she licks and sucks on 'em and breaths real heavy into my ear. Jeez that's hot!<br>  <br>  If ur really into the person, let them know from time to time how much it sucks to be away from him.

aK8JwxHhaa	I actually just went through something similar yesterday.  To make a long story short, a girl that I had considered one of my closest friends said that I was "turning against my friends, and that she'd make sure that they all knew."  One of the people that she was referring to was my bff.<br>  <br>  My advice to you?  Let this other girl run her mouth all she wants to.  In the long run, if this girl really is your bff, she'll know that this new girl isn't worth the time of day.  Try to talk things out with her.  If she won't listen, then tell her that you're better off without her.  Also, let her know that you'd be willing to work things out with her when ((or if)) she ever grows up... if you feel that way.|`|iQzCGrjuaa	Not to be rude..but this sounds like Elementary/middle school drama,If that's the case,Hon she's not a good friend if she did that to you.<br>  <br>  ..and not meant to scare you but..problems get harder as you get older..I wish that was one of my problems..I'd trade any one of them for this kind of BFF problems.|`|INLQHsl7aa	i dont think  dont have 2 do that...<br>  isthats what happen, ur ex bf will hate u more bcoz she'll lie... n lie... n lie... more.<br>  just stay calm, and u dont have 2 make another contact with them.|`|Dc6gLnaKaa	I've had that happened, the end result?<br>  I have a new best friend, and I had a IM/Phone fight with the girl, My (now EXxxx) best friend and also about five other girls.

And, if it doesnt work, send a LONG email about everything and end it with "If you dont trust me, then dont but it is the truth....im sorry but i just wanted to let you know what happened..... lylas..................bye." and if it doesnt work, try and move on......its HARD but just try. I had a bff for 5yrs and a new girl like that came along. we finally stopped tlkin 4 a year and i called her and she was completely difrent a complete brat and backstabber.....be careful when messing with a new girl like this.

a6c863935284bba299d60ac888aa05edaa	Hi, <br>  Wow!<br>  It is a little bit confusing. I am going to try to get this.<br>  You are saying that you are in a relationship that hasn't ended yet, but is no longer intimate and you have strong feelings for another man, and that man wants you to have a baby with him. Is that correct?<br>  <br>  I would say that you should  end your present relationship, because of your strong feelings for another. <br>  <br>  If your current relationship ended, would you and this other man start one? <br>  <br>  If you start a relationship with him, wouldn't you want to wait a bit before deciding to add a baby to the mix? As most couples can attest, a baby changes everything!<br>  <br>  I can see a very romantic man saying that he can imagine sharing his life with you. Maybe even saying he can see the two of you raising a family together. But until the two of you are together and commited to each, you risk raising a baby by yourself. <br>  Only you can know if you are prepared for that.<br>  <br>  If he is telling you these things, only he can tell you why. (and you should ask!)<br>  <br>  Be sure to listen to your head and not only your heart.<br>  <br>  Best wishes to you!
PtqlQ5Anaa	You can try it but you would be doing long distance 3 times the length youve already been dating. Thats hard for anyone. Obviously you all are younger because you still live with your parents so that just makes it tremendously hard. You would really be missing out on a lot. Maybe you guys should keep talking and talk about maybe just waiting til he gets back to continue dating again. the first four months of a relationship is a honey moon phase so everything goes very smooth then it starts to get to where you argue. If he is in nova scotia that will just cause sooo much more stress. If both of you are very set on having something long distance and it starts to fizzle out after a few months maybe try having an open relationship for a while and make it exclusive again when he gets back if you both feel the same way in a year. A LOT happens in a year.|`|1c2e120daf62de36ddf3fc388f1a0f5baa	Love can not be  only one way.  Count your blessings he's gone, better now  than later.  You can do better.   Do not degrade yourself life is too short.  Do not wast your time on someone who does not appreciate you.<br>  <br>  I was married for 33 years.|`|l5MCXmTaaa	thats your decision ?? Just make sure whatever you choose you don't regret it later .|`|J51GNRlaaa	Get webcams.  If u love each other and talk or cam every day, it won't b that hard, especially for a year.  Unless u guys r really shallow and whorish, meaning need to touch others, ull b fine.  then again, u guys r young and don't know the world of real dating. a lot of young people think they're in love because they don't have a lot of options in high school. ur mind can create a fake love, wich u believe with all ur heart to be true love, until u go into the real world and it slaps u to the ground like a ton of bricks that ur love wasn't real.|`|Uwdxyi4naa	If you really love him like you say, try out the long distance. If it doesn't work out (i.e. you're the one for things like cuddling or kissing or so), then ask to see other people for a while, and perhaps when/if he comes back, to get back with him.|`|wGdKrmrRaa	You can try it out, but if it doesn't work... you're just going to either have to break up with him or wait until he comes back.|`|XmO8KOCPaa	i say try longdistance realationship because you can always use a dildow :)|`|NNnJGSysaa	if your 21 and younger end it..i know u get tired of hearing it but u dont know what love is, especially after four months...sorry for the harshness|`|rCTN5fetaa	I am in a strong Long Distance relationship. It is a good test to put your relationship through if you want to test how strong it is. If you really trust him not to cheat and really know that you aren't going to get hurt in the process then be my guest. I have very strong faith in my man. He Is absolutly amazing! The best there ever is. He is great. I will love him untill the day after forever! <br>  So please try it if you'd like but bewarned! It hurts me everday not to be able to see my boyfriend. AND HECK! I have to wait two years to see my guy. 2010! pshh, And he says he can't wait that long either. But we hang in there.<br>  Always&Forever.

If not, tell them that you truly do love him and everything that happened was consensual and do not tell them his name because if they do go to the police, thats bad. <br>  <br>  <br>  if your turning 18 soon, it doesn't matter. when you turn 18, they can't control you, and they can go to the police but the guy won't get in trouble.<br>  good luck|`|wGdKrmrRaa	Hou much older than you is he? I wouldn't trust a long distance relationship with an older guy.

Remember, you're underage. Your parents are usually involved in everything you do.<br>  <br>  Plus, I think your parents are making the right choice. You're underage. You don't need a guy older than you... especially if it makes the situation "sex with a minor".|`|zzDuC99caa	with you being young and losing ur virginity to him, i would say that he used u. but thats me. if you talk to a shrink they can keep things confidental and wont speak to the police. id say the **** hit the fan. but maybe it needs to be understood that everything yall did, wuz something yall did together and not him persuading u. it mite be a good idea to call a teen hotline.|`|aEknHMpkaa	I recommend counseling, honey.

0AW2CDsHaa	i was very uncomfortable when i first watched porn with my boyfriend. most girls dont like it because they feel like their guy is more into the girls on the screen than her. talk to her and tell her u would like try new sexual things like porn so you can bond and learn new tricks. i went from not wanting to watch porn to watching straight porn and even LESBIAN!! porn with my boyfriend. you should let her watch some of it by herself. and if u guys do watch together say things like "oh i would love to do that to you," and "your **** are nice" or "your *** is nice" NOT things like "Damn! look at those ****" or "that ***!" just make her feel comfortable with you.|`|2V7HRd7Vaa	there is no point in watching it whatsoever, so why bother? why do you want her to watch it so bad anyway? why are guys so perverted?!

AA10036744	I'm sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but the cellulite has almost nothing to do with your weight. Yes, being overweight will DEFINITELY accentuate the problem, but it isn't what causes it. Genetics is the culprit, and you'd have the dimples even if you were skeletal. Kate Moss has cellulite. It happens.<br>  <br>  So, there isn't anything you can do to remove it, but you CAN make it less noticeable. There are a lot of over-the-counter creams that claim to reduce the appearance, but the one I've found works the best is from Avon. Regular massaging of the area will also help to improve the appearance. My favorite thing to do is use ground coffee as an exfoliant. Gently, and I do mean GENTLY, massage the grounds into the affected area. Do this for about 10 minutes 2 to three times a week, and you'll notice some visible tightening of the skin. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps :)<br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  |`|j6MSv5Tkaa	maybe the reason why you have all those dimples is cause of FAST FOOD.<br>  <br>  i'm 5'9 and weigh 143 and i have absolutely no dimples on the back of my legs at all. cause i don't eat that much junk food and i eat a lot of fruits and veggies..<br>  <br>  start eating healthy :)|`|xJ4ooDT4aa	Well you are really skinny. You're not fat at all. I think what you need to do is tone up a bit. Try to cut back on that food and work out more.|`|b10IbxyJaa	get over it and quit trying to be up to par with America's perception of "beautiful".  I bet you're over exaggerating.|`|52f1c834298f9b217db9e7336dac1270aa	at 107 its not your weight its your body fat index, try going to the gym or get in some fitness class at a local, Ymca or community center. Although eating better would also help, like you said you need to add some veggies in your diet, and after about 2 weeks you would barely even miss the ranch dressing, trying cutting out one thing at a time, such as, the ranch dressing and still eat the carrots, cucumbers and apples. Next take it where you want, if you eat out 5 days a week make it 4 but make better choices at home, if you love frys try some out of the freezer section and bake them in the oven, try finding alternative food to fast food that isn't' going to leave you completely craving it, I know its hard I love fries. Hope this helps a little|`|WkA8UPflaa	cellulite is usually fat pockets if you are skinny so maybe you could try to tone your legs. Maybe try jogging and squats. if you have a pool squats in the water work best and you can get a tan at the same time :) I hope this helps!! Try to cut back on the junk food but dont stop eating or try to lose weight just eat healthy<br>  oh yeah diet pills are usually not safe or fat burners. They can deplete your immune system and also harm you liver. Plus if you do it the natural way it will have the best results it might take a bit longer but it pays off and you will feel healthier<br>  sorry i keep thinking of things lol. Have you ever tried rice cakes they are really good and healthy! Also if you buy sunflower seeds if you are craving something you can eat that and it will make you feel better without eating anything too unhealthy, hmmm mango is really good as well as kiwi and pineapple
WkA8UPflaa	Yes it is very possible for a guy to be anorexic. Especially if he has been getting a lot of compliments when he first started not to eat. Sometimes people whos lifes are out of control will start to not eat becuase they think they can be in control in at least one area of ther life even if it is unhealthy they might view it as a way to have control over something and i think it would be very wise to approach him but first google it and tell him all the syptoms and dangers there are of being aneroxic I really hope I helped
PsG9cklPaa	There is no time frame as to when you will fall in love...<br>  <br>  Let it come naturally... if not... only time will tell.<br>  <br>  There is nothing wrong with you.

a6c863935284bba299d60ac888aa05edaa	Hi, <br>  I think the sweetest thing is when a guy would ask first.<br>  So when you are alone, and standing face to face, hold her hands and look into her eyes. Tell her that you have been wanting to kiss her and ask her if you can. I am sure she will say yes.<br>  Move your hands to her waist. Keep your lips relaxed a little, don't "pucker up". As you move your face closer to hers, tip your head just a little bit to one side so you don't bump noses.<br>  Press your lips against hers gently. There you go! <br>  After the kiss give her a hug.<br>  If there is any sort of awkwardness, like say you did bump noses, or you both had your eyes open or something, just laugh a little bit and say let's try that again!<br>  <br>  You will be just fine!<br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  |`|CR1TmpGaaa	awww. when you guys are alone and just kinda looking at eachother just kiss her. maybe if your too scared on the cheek. then see her responce and if it went well then kiss her. the first time is kinda scary but after a while it comes naturally. go for it =]|`|a6Clopwgaa	just go for it man!<br>  <br>  take her by the hand or hold her softly in your arms then look into her eyes....make sure your breath is fresh......then just kiss her lips softly. just pecks at first but that's as far as you should go if this is your first real kiss....no intercourse man.|`|mu14qSlbaa	Aww! So cute. Just start with a peck on the lips and slowly move your head back and look at her facial reaction. If it went well, go further!|`|1FoPHnhuaa	make your first kiss simple and romantic, but make sure she is ready first|`|TWrioURmaa	if u love her you cant go wrong<br>  if she loves you back she wont care if you suck
WkA8UPflaa	Yes I didnt have a boyfriend until now and I am 18 its not weird and a lot of guys think I am hot (not being conceited either) and I just never went for guys because they were not my type. In school they were to immature and at work, well they were just not the right ones. And its great when you hold out it is much funner dating when you are an adult. All the drama in high school from bf and gfs was crazy and also when your under 18 your parents are in control of what you do. So personally by my own choice I stayed single till I was 18 and I dont mind at all. |`|elxXIOTfaa	You basically described myself.  My first boyfriend was at the age of 17.  Don't rush it.  Let them come to you.  If people ask, just tell them the truth.  Who really cares you know? Sometimes its hard having a relationship in high school with the crap load of homework they give you. So just take your time and you'll be alright.  |`|oozAbVuDaa	theres nothing wrong with you, fate just hasent brought the right guy for you...its a stupid awnser but you have to wait...unless you're really desperate lol you could get an online boyfriend...((lmao which i did and im not ugly either)) but i would'nt reccomend that either its way harder than a regular ((healthy)) relationship so i'd say be paitent...your time will come lol and i so know you dont want that awnser....other than that ....mhmm COMPLEATE makeover? good luck |`|ifJMbeOHaa	I'm 20 and I've never had a girlfriend, just try not to let it get to you.|`|YWdNTZU3aa	just keep it to yourslf and talk to some guys|`|JVwxwiPKaa	Lol i am in the same position you are in. Ive never had a boyfriend before and im 15, some people question me about my sexuality because of this but it doesnt tend to bother me. For some reason i dont really care about not having one, trust me you are not weird. If people look at you in a funny way because youve never had a boyfriend, do the same to them!
a6c863935284bba299d60ac888aa05edaa	Hi, so the gf broke up with her bf after observing this accident, right?<br>  <br>  From what they observed, the guy didn't care for the girlfriend's dog. He didn't look out for it, "he was just taking her dog for a walk" resulting in the death of her dog.<br>  <br>  There must be something in about this accident, that applied to her boyfriend's character in some way? Can't really tell by the story though.<br>  <br>  But something hit home to her. Hard to tell without knowing more about this couple.<br>  It is almost as if she saw her boyfriend's character in this man they observed and realized she can't handle that anymore.<br>  <br>  Good question. I want to read other's opinions.<br>  Thanks!<br>  |`|oxeSJ85Gaa	she fell in love with him for tring to save the dog, she was afried that he'd kill her dog if she keep it up<br>  |`|t0gt4oHxaa	I'm so confused!|`|PHa4hg5Taa	wat the heck?? i dont get it either 
WkA8UPflaa	I like older guys. The reason being is they are more mature and I am 18 so that could have something to do with it. I like guys anywhere from 19-26 i would date somebody the same age but I would prefer them to be older 26 is the tops though I think|`|5cXW4A0Faa	No its normal. I was dating a 22 yr old when i was 15, and we didnt have any issues.|`|9ff1c6f2d4868d7018aa09f9e4c7f3b8aa	i tend to lean towards the older guys, but im better friends with guys my age so i like them too|`|eLFnR8yvaa	Depends man

Chances are you're not going to walk funny and your parents wont find out as long as you don't TELL THEM. |`|NT26Vdlmaa	well its great that u planed all this out u aren't as stupid as most other kids! well if u ask me have fun and keep ur mouth shut around ur parents!|`|Vjw1pVVsaa	put on a rubber and stay on the pill and it will hurt but it will be HOT AND SEXY|`|QU37MZi7aa	parents will never know unless you will be having "morning sickness" lady. just be sure to have best protection before doing "it".|`|ZO6QXAY5aa	It sounds to me like you aren't ready. If you refer to sex as "it" and don't feel comfortable enough to say it and If you have to ask these questions on YA! then you should not be having sex.|`|dojw9pUiaa	You probably wont walk funny, but it is said to hurt a bit when you first have 'it'.<br>  <br>  Your parents wont find out unless you tell them, someone else tells them or they catch you in the act. I dont think there are any particular signs that you have done 'it'. <br>  Just make sure that your boyfriend wears protection, then you'll have nothing to worry about. <br>  <br>  But remember, if you dont feel ready, then dont do it. If your boyfriend cares for you he wont force you into doing anything you don't want to do. If you feel you arnt ready then wait because you'll enjoy it more when you do it because you'll feel fully ready and wont regret anything. <br>  <br>  Just Relax. (:|`|AA12246778	You are still very young and not ready for it.  Growing up is a scary experience.  (remember your first date, first day at a new school, first day of work at a new job).  Sex is a very personal experience, it is also a very wonderful experience.  Learning about sex is also very special and something you learn as you get older.  Don't rush it.  Learning about sex and boys is something  that you will always remember.  Don't do something you will later regret because you will never forget these moments.|`|7isKCNKxaa	all you got to do is lay there and give him a few minutes and he will be done so what is there to be nervous about|`|NhfbBOzKaa	If you are calling sex ,"it", then you're not ready...

Dn2Zdljraa	   I guess you'll get a few different opinions.<br>  <br>     Yes I have a FEW, and they are attractive guys, but not flamers, and around me they are REGULAR people, just thinking in a different way than I do, sexually, but that doesn't mean they are weird.<br>  <br>     Any girl, who knows, or befriends any gay guys,might also enjoy it, just for the company, and a drink, or meal, or conversation, and both still know it's "safe"<br>  <br>     How YOU handle it? I assume you aren't a girl. Anyone "handles" it in knowing the preferences, but still maybe wanting to know the other person, without judging those preferences.<br>  <br>     I don't HANG with them, but some I know are like best friends, and I trust them, like their casual company, honesty, and usually the "preference" isn't an issue.<br>  <br>     If you or anyone thinks the issue is about trying to convert someone, you might want to re-think your motives.|`|2ea7f508e5ceee425b8e39e2ee78ab82aa	no i dont have any gay guy friends. and if i did and had an attraction to one of them id just find a hot straight guy nd switch to him. attraction to a gay guy is a waste,lol|`|WkA8UPflaa	umm I had one and he was hot but him acting like a girl turned me off instantly!

Most look at the shoes first (an indicator of mood, status and length of penis).  <br>  <br>  When a man stares at a woman, he imagines her with less clothes; when a woman looks at a man, she imagines him in better clothes. |`|PndL1lfcaa	How fat their wallet looks in their back pocket.|`|3cc04ca1b70eaaef3ed7bb1c5dc9af35aa	....i'm curious to know too.

LOVE LOVE LOVE!|`|u8bEX5Qzaa	Truthfully, girls tend to not look for things on the guys body. Of course good looks are important to us but we don't look at the size of your penis or your butt or anything, we aren't that superficial. We look for a guy who will treat us good and won't hurt us. |`|8RKA2KBUaa	First, talk to the guy, notice the eyes...lalalaa<br>  The second thing I notice is their hair...idk why....then i notice the face. If it's adorable...that's when u look at the butt!! <br>  <br>  Idc wat that girl says...girl's do look at the butts...and if ur a flat one..well just hope u have a cute face.|`|WkA8UPflaa	There face and when they take there shirt off, if they have a hot body ;) but usually only the face!! And of course I like them taller then me|`|FZ80qm3Eaa	I mostly look at the face.

Girls/Women aren't as perverted as guys.  Unless you have a weird fetish with like...ears or something.|`|Nxzm7Nnaaa	Well I know the first thing I look at is the smile, then I work my way down. I then will look at your body, then I'll most likely look at your eyes, then I'll go talk to you and see how your personality is cuz that's the main key, and if it's good i'll flirt a little (:|`|V1EhayaFaa	i like arms.. and hands. every girl is different though. we like butts too!!! hahahah but we mostly notice style, etc before the actual physicalities. |`|br4tGaeiaa	Im pretty sure we dont look at guys for sexual pleasure lol<br>  <br>  girls like faces and egos :]<br>  <br>  ohh ya the ABS oh god girls LOVE abs :]|`|9J3ymalQaa	Personally, The First Thing I Glance At Is Probably The Height, Face,Then I Work My Way Down The Body On The Belly And Stuff.

gNXQ8uSwaa	Wait until you are at least 18 years old and have a diploma in your hand. |`|WkA8UPflaa	I think it is I am 18 and a virgin, I mean its just something I think is special. A lot of guys I know date girls and when they get in there pants they leave them. This one guy dated a girl for over 6 months, everybody thought he was a great bf and so she caved and had sex with him, the moment she did he left her. Not saying it happens every time but it does happen a lot. When you wait for marriage you know the guy wants you for more than just sex, a guy wouldnt marry you if that was all he was after|`|M8okrfKfaa	yes it is. deff. <br>  <br>  ppl who have already done it before marriage and regret doing "it" are gonna tell you "no, it's not worth it" but that's just because they are lying to themselves about it since they have already lost their virginity and they are ashamed.<br>  <br>  wait till marriage.<br>  <br>  it helps you experience something new with your husband that NeiTher of you have ever done before (if he is waiting too) and it feels better knowing that you don't have guilt.<br>  <br>  waiting till marriage brings the husband and wife closer together.<br>  <br>  plus,<br>  if you wait,<br>  you'll be able to experience the greatness of "it" for the first time... with your Sexy husband........<br>  <br>  without having the feeling of "gosh, this is nothing new. ugh. i've already done this with men before. it was good the first time, but now it's nothing new"<br>  <br>  just wait till marriage.|`|GVanattBaa	Well, It's not up to us (as in Yahoo Answerers)<br>  It's up to you. <br>  In my opinion, I think it's best. Mainly because I think it would be more special and more romantic if it was with the one person I truely love. And plus, if something goes wrong, No regrets. No one night stands. <br>  <br>  I don't know that's my choice, I'm waiting till marriage because I think that's best for me, and plus, I don't think I'll be ready till marriage. haha, <br>  But it's really up to you.

iKYNUni0aa	maybe he was 2 excited or nervous|`|HCqJixZmaa	Nervous for sure.|`|AA11585161	Many possible reasons.  He could have something wrong with hm physically or mentally at present and not be aware of it.  He could be afraid of not satisfying you properly.  Try and discuss it with him and see if either of you can perhaps find any type of answer.  If it continues I would suggest that he speak with his doctor and let him know what is happening.  Best of luck.|`|nXVnM4FOaa	Nerves, drank too much, medication he might be on, saw that you actually have a twig and berries.... that kinda stuff.|`|nmYH1mB7aa	He was nervous or not all that into you.|`|aIPtYaBiaa	You probably talked to much, and I agree with the first guy, dank|`|bQdz0orUaa	he could be nervous or distracted with other things in life or perhaps putting too much pressure on himself to please you why not take the lead and get him comfortable with foreplay this will help put him at ease just show support and he'll pull through eventually dont expect it to be hours longer straight away give it time good luck hope you work out|`|SkxUKjz5aa	He was nervous or either so excited over you and that's not unusual for the first time.

It sucks that he did that to you and you deserve better than that. If he really does like you, he wouldn't have done that. You should tell him that that's not cool and you don't appreciate it. If you don't, he might think he can run over you and do something like that again.<br>  <br>  I know someone's friend who committed suicide because someone made a fake female profile to make him think someone liked him, and he had low self-esteem. |`|t9c4vOZmaa	That's really mean to do to somebody going out with them on a dare. <br>  What do you say to him?

o1rzGR8kaa	So your eyes wont bulge out|`|c7c42fcd2fd4b62ba49207bebbdb931daa	The mob has "rules", bikers have "rules", thieves have "rules", so....  I guess it's just so everyone knows what they can and can't do, and that way, everything has an order to it.<br>  <br>  Edit:  Ok, well, you didn't specify that we had to only answer the question based on it's relativity to sex.  I was just pointing out that the oddest "groups" have rules, when you wouldn't necessarily think that they do.  Hence swingers having rules.  And, sorry, but I've known some thieves, and they most definately had rules....|`|t81MEJ82aa	They have rules to set boundaries just as anyone else has rules. The purpose is to protect the relationship. Some people are able to separate sex from the relationship so having sex outside the relationship doesn't destroy it. You cannot judge someone else's choices based on your personal limitations.|`|XIGnFAAsaa	Mam Man, you're back!!<br>  <br>  I agree with the poster who said, 'If you're gonna have sex with multiple people, why get married?"<br>  <br>  Seems to me that one isn't conducive to the other.<br>  <br>  Just my opinion, but I would never get married again for a lot of reasons, so maybe it's a moot point.|`|AnW3dzQfaa	There's no "rules" in swinging.  It just depends on the couple your about to hook up with.|`|AA11412999	The point is that without rules, it's just two people out for their own pleasure and not concerned with the well-being and happiness of the other.  Without rules, people get hurt.<br>  <br>  Rules are created by each person in the couple as measuring sticks.  The other person in the couple uses these rules to avoid hurting his or her spouse.  The rules are actually opportunities to build trust: follow the rules, you earn your partner's trust.  If you're an idiot who blatantly breaks the rules because they were (in his/her opinion) too restrictive, then your partner is going to be hurt twice: once by the act that they asked you to please not engage in, and second by the fact that you had no respect whatsoever for his/her emotional needs.<br>  <br>  Rules are the training wheels of the lifestyle.  Once you've gotten enough experience (and confidence in the relationship), the training wheels come off one bolt at a time.  But until then, they are the primary trust-building tool that swingers use to avoid harming their relationship and one another.  Without these rules as a framework, you're left with a rich breeding ground for miscommunication...and miscommunication is the kiss of death in relationships.|`|pzTkEmKkaa	There is only one rule in swinging which is universal and that is "NO means No" All others are considered to be guidelines that vary from person to person and couple to couple.<br>  <br>  What would you do or would your partner want you to do if during a swinging encounter you experienced performance anxiety, should everyone else continue or should all activities cease? <br>  <br>  This situation should not be considered at the time of the encounter, as a couple you should know how to proceed before in such a situation.<br>  <br>  This is why swingers have guidelines....to be prepared for any situation.<br>  <br>  "Getting it on" with someone does not give them free reign to do as they please. Some swingers choose to exclude certain actions to simply keep them for one another.<br>  <br>  Ginni  |`|pZfKcU9vaa	Swinging couples have rules to clearly define what is and isn't okay.  It's really pretty simple, frankly.  Some couples don't allow kissing.  Some don't allow penetration.  It is really like any other part of their lives.  In our relationship, our rules are set with what my wife is comfortable with, and what I am comfortable with.|`|vdcJBx6Daa	Swinging is all about trust.  Rules are necessary to maintain order and uphold the trust.<br>  <br>  Rule 1: No means no.  Breaking the rule means you are committing rape or abuse.<br>  Rule 2: Always get your partner's consent before swinging.  Breaking the rule means you are cheating and is no different from non-swingers.<br>  Rule 3: Always use protection unless all parties agree not to.  Breaking the rule dissolves trust (and potentially leads to paternity issues and child support).|`|1YU4dOiTaa	You're obviously not a swinger. Swingers have rules because they care about themselves, their partner, and their relationship. Every couple (and person) has a different comfort level, and successful swingers respect that about other people and about their own partner. |`|hKyOUVXIaa	What's the point of swingers being married?  It's pretty dumb.  You make a commitment to someone, then decide to sleep around with their permission.  Why not be single?  Geez.|`|g1cLfPpEaa	Morons all.|`|2f2338425d995c6d00e32cb38d57ee7faa	What's the point in anyone having "rules"? Every couple has "rules" whether it relates to swinging, housework, staying out late or taking care of the kids. Rules and expectations are always a part of the relationship, whether you're a swinger or not.
deZFoiHxaa	Most women are bitches.  I know - I am one.  We tend to be "cold" because we don't know you, or are possibly in a relationship and would feel we're disrespecting our sig other if if we were to talk to you - you may mean it friendly but the bf could see it otherwise.  Also, she might take the friendliness as a intro to tryin to have sex with her or something.  So, be a little more upfront and instead of saying you seem interesting can I get to know you...say something like I really like to meet new people and you seem like someone I'd like to know.  and make it clear you don't have hidden sex-driven agendas.  |`|RdXuck1zaa	I will be honest, Sometimes we are talking to so many people that we can't respond to everybody. That is my case. I am sorry. The internet is a little bit more chaotic then real life when trying to get to know someone. I am 24 too! E-mail me, Let's get to know each other!|`|WkA8UPflaa	I think its because in person you know if the guy looks like a freak or not. Online, you have been warned all your life that the Internet is "bad" so you tend to think that the guys are kind of freaks. Its just a mind set even though its kind of stupid. But it is good to be cautious|`|IzXiO360aa	hello mr.24 ur idea of making new friends seems interesting  but girls are afriad to do chatting with the boys.<br>  if so, they get deeply involved into it that it will become hard for them to *** out from this   to avoid such problem they maintain distance from online chatting idea.|`|GwwcqUCoaa	Getting Copy and Paste-looking e-mails is really awful. At least put in a name along with the "Hi";  women aren't hamburgers whizzing down an assembly line. It's a real turn-off when a guy can't be bothered to personalize what he's saying.|`|HWU9tb0gaa	It's probably the girl. I enjoy meeting people and talking to people. <br>  And I generally think it's good manners to give someone, guy or girl, a heads up saying that you have to go soon.<br>  She may not be interested in you, or she may just not really be into the online scene. Some girls prefer the traditional method, especially if the guy in question is more long distance.

UP33GlBwaa	First you get the courage to ask her out.  Maybe have a movie night or dinner, then go somewhere quiet where the two of you can be alone to talk.  Then, you can tell her just how you feel.  Now of course this all depends on how well you know her to begin with.  If you have just met her, then she may not yet be comfortable getting alone with you, so then you need to take it step by step to get to that point.  And if you do already know her and are friends, then she may be alright with that. |`|AA10409800	I picture this as you:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.viruscomix.com/page458.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.viruscomix.com/page458.html</a>|`|OB6tc2d9aa	When you first feel it.

AA11450203	Don't speed the recovery process.  You hurt your friend and it's going to take quite some time for her to recover from it.  She may have forgiven you but she has certainly not forgotten what happened.  Only time can cure wounds like that and they may have quite the proverbal scar left over.  That means that it is unlikely things will ever return back to normal and that there wil always be an heir of uncomfortablility for the two of you.|`|4cf2ebbd05e754bc934280d2a40f8dc6aa	Once trust has been broken its hard to just trust again.<br>  You can never speed things like this up as she'll have to deal with it in her own time.<br>  |`|6wqaewGgaa	You should be more kindly to her, and wait until she wants to be friends like you use to be.

You'll probably never be the same.|`|OlSvP5YZaa	don't rush things. she is still trying to come to terms with your deeds. everything you do now to rekindle your friendship just hurts her more. so give her all the time in the world, when she is ready, you will know and then if she accepts you back please don't do it again!|`|v2lLYnjeaa	I hate to say this, but you cannot really speed that up. It is going to take her a looong time to really forgive you. I would say suck it up and let her take all the time she needs. Really talk to her, see what you can do to help.|`|qTbGqts5aa	Consider yourself very lucky that your friend still deals with you. Don't speed up anything. Maybe she is still dealing with her trust issues with you. The ball is in her court now, so just prove to her any doubt that she has about you is not worth it! Good luck with your friendship. |`|AA12275607	Well you already know that women are emotional beings. There are somethings that you do that could be seen as unforgivable, this could just be one of them. I am not saying that she will never forgive you but trust is earned. It will take time for her to be able to trust you again. You said you guys talk a lot. Just embrace that for now. Don't force the issue.....learn from the lesson.

VEEgoDkFaa	Your boyfriend sounds like he's got a lot of game with him.  He's calling the shots and you're unhappy with the way the relationship is going. The beginning of a relationship is supposed to be the best part. It's when you get to know each other and do your best to spend time together. If that's not his goal now, it may never be. You need to have a heart to heart talk with him and let him know that your needs are not being met the way the relationship is going now.  You are not wrong to have expectations and you're really not asking for much. He doesn't even try tp appease you with a few phone calls. You need to decide if this is something you can live with or not.  Honestly I think you deserve better, and I think you know this. Think about what you want, and if you believe he can't or wont give you what you want and deserve, then it may be time to end it. Think about it. Trust. ';-()|`|y4SUDnpaaa	It seems pretty much a stretch to even call what you have a relationship. You are not overreacting, if  anything you are being too passive. This guy sounds like he's hiding something or playing some kind of quirky game with you.

You can't lose what you've never had.|`|km5e0hfsaa	sounds like he has another woman or you are not important to him, just someone to pass time with.|`|SCoCHGJtaa	I agree with Fletcher it's likely he's hiding something from you he probably has one or more than one lady he's busy with and your just the side dish.|`|IxzJ6SN5aa	I would listen to your instincts on this one. <br>  <br>  I would keep your options open and see if you can find a guy you like better who isn't quite so fishy.|`|AA10373401	so which part of your thought process thinks it could be a perfect relationship?|`|47SaB9PFaa	Though, one but something is up don't you think, i dont know what to say however, if you called, and he didn;t i don;t know, you are not overreacting sweetie, this guy seems, kinda shady,so talk to him, and see whats up, but if he is still this way, and getting worse sorry to say Dump the guy |`|RQnrjcmcaa	Sounds like he is hiding something from you. Does he really live with his parents? I'm sure he could've invited you over for a few hours when his parents weren't home just to show you around. So he's not a phone person? Does he text or email? You're right to be suspicious.|`|qOoPYlL7aa	I would think he is hiding something from you. If he really did like you then the two of you would make plans to see each other. A relationship only works when the two of you do things together or at least see each other. I would start looking for someone else.  |`|Ya5VQQLTaa	He's not interested enough in you to even think about your feelings.  Don't answer his calls, maybe he'll come crawling back to you.

"soon we'll have plenty of time together" is a bunch of bull because we dont no how long sooon can be. Your not overreacting you just want to know whats up with you guys and thats normal.

He might be commited to someone else and living with them.  He ofered you to meet his family so you would not think he has anything to hide.  He indirectly told you he's been tending to family business and soon you two could get together and have some fun.  Your a young girl, there's are others you can choose from. Follow your gut stop now before you get to deep.  Tell him you must do this.  
ZSBZ83Dpaa	I am sorry about your friend's mom's reaction. Most likely she was really shocked and needs time to absorb this surprise about her daughter's sexual orientation. All you can try is to give her mom the time she needs to get over this and to adapt to reality. This may take a lot of talking, and it would certainly be useful if you could enlist your mother's help in this. The two ladies are in the same boat, so-to-speak. At the moment, I would take a low profile and not push it. I'm sure that you will not stop being friends with or loving your girl, but you need to do everything to not provoke her mom. I don't know her, but chances are that she'll come around eventually and accept reality.|`|AA10373401	there is your problem, "because i need her in my life but no one understands."

But if that's the sort of guy you want to marry, by God you had better save it for him. Otherwise, better to sow your wild oats and satisfy your curiousity now than have it be a drag on your relationship later. No one is immune from doubt and second-guessing life choices.|`|YVRXdfGHaa	My first wife was a virgin. I wasn't. But I respected her wishes.

AA11412999	Contrary to common misconception, swingers are not slaves to their sex drives.  Any swinger worth his or her salt is quite the opposite, and is quite good at making decisions with the big head, not the little one.  They also should be good at taking no for an answer.  If you explain to them exactly what you've said here: "My wife and I are not at a point in our relationship where we are willing to consider the swinging lifestyle." it should be a no-brainer.  The response should be something like, "Oh.  Well we find you both attractive and were interested, so we thought we'd ask.  But no harm no foul.  Let us know if you ever change your minds."  And that should be the end of it.  <br>  <br>  The worst thing you might find is that they try again later on down the road.  If they're pushy or sneaky or do anything that feels like manipulation, walk away.  In any case, you can't go wrong with clear, direct communication.  State the situation the way you see it and simply state how you feel about it.  One thing we've found to be constant: assumptions leave room for doubts and miscommunication.  So be polite, but be sure to call it like you see it.<br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  EDIT:  There are plenty of answerers on here who will tell you that swinging is 110% wrong.  I'm guessing that most of them either have NO direct experience with swinging, or they're picking it up from really, really bad examples.  Even if they've experienced it themselves, if they told me all about their disaster, I'm sure I could point out to them exactly why it didn't work for them.  Swinging isn't the problem.  It's the idiots who try it for all the wrong reasons who are to blame.  There have been some pretty broad negative generalizations about us and about our motives, morals, ethics, commitment to marriage, and even how much we love our spouses, all of which are ridiculous.  So...333, you can call me a liar if you like, I HEARTILY disagree.|`|0Id85yiYaa	considering that the wife took some persuasion to get into it, they would understand if you guys weren't into it. i'm sure they're perfectly capable of having just a friendship. |`|RN1wGlWWaa	If you are not gonna be comfortable with this couple because you think they will keep "hinting" at talking you into something you don't want to do, then no - don't be friends with them.<br>  <br>  IMO when you marry you don't share your spouse with another.  Swinging is just a fancy way to say you are cheating with permission.  Your desire should be with your spouse.  <br>  <br>  I would just wait and see.  If they continue to being up the swinging topic and you guys are against it, tell them "sorry but we can't be friends because we don't agree with what you are doing".  <br>  <br>  Then find new friends to make/hang out with.|`|1NCPPHR9aa	You don't have to do anything you are not comfortable with.

Its plenty easy to say no.  The only problem is if the continually pressure you or make passes at you.  I've been a swinger and had many friends who were not. Its not that big a deal.|`|o6xLWwZvaa	At first my husband and I wanted only a female involved in the bedroom, however we had more luck finding single men or couples. So at first we just involved whoever was interested. Then we got to the point that we wanted more friendship out of the deal. So we decided to contact couples stating to them, that we are looking for friendship but if anything else happens so be it. <br>  <br>  We are a member to adultfriendfinder.com<br>  The bad part about that website is..to contact anyone you have to be a paying member. Which we are not. We haven't been with anyone in over 3yrs. Since my husband came home from Iraq, my love for him grew and I just can't imagine sharing him with anyone or him sharing me. <br>  <br>  If you and your wife have other things in common besides sex with this swinger couple then hang out with them as friends and take it one day at a time.|`|OG6BYwaLaa	I am a swinger myself. <br>  <br>  I suggest you NOT play with pre-existing friends.  It is not the same. Things change forever and they cannot go back.<br>  <br>  You can still be friends with them without dabbling in what they do.  If you are not comfortable hearing about their adventures, tell them so.  If they are good friends, they should respect that.|`|PFmPcKbwaa	Hmm sounds interesting and hot.

We are friends with each of them based on that, and we don't try to convert non-swinging friends into swingers.  We appreciate them for who they are.|`|NzrJeHTMaa	I don't think you necessarily have to end what could be a very good friendship because of this. She was fairly discreet in asking you, and they don't seem to be pushy or anything.<br>  <br>  What I would do is tell her what you've told us: That your marriage is not yet at a point where you'd be comfortable with that but you'd like to continue being friends. That way, you can keep your friends and later on, if you change your mind about the swinging, you can have your cake and eat it too (so to speak).Good luck.|`|vxqP6uUJaa	LOSE THEM, swinging is for people who dont have what it takes to have  a successful marriage, so unless you are unhappy in your marriage, ...get far away. <br>  Dont you take your vows seriously?? <br>  <br>  If you dont care about your marriage then swing away.<br>  <br>  Its a pathetic disgusting lifestyle, for those who try and justify their promiscuous sick desires. <br>  And if one truly loves their spouse, this question never comes up and if anyone says otherwise, they're liars.|`|ze7xiJwTaa	I've been on both sides of this. People who swing, have open relationships or otherwise engage in sexual practices that include other people tend to have the similar moral values in other areas of their lives. I have honestly tried to be open minded but I find that there is always a level of drama and dishonesty in this type of relationship that seems to end in disaster every time. No matter what kind of 'rules' are set in a situation like that, they always seem to get broken. <br>  In my experience these relationships are spawned by one partner who has abnormal boundaries, maybe a sex addiction, and is looking to get some action. After they get their partner to buy in, this person will eventually betray the other. That's just my experience. <br>  You can be friends of course, but keep it at an arms length. Don't get sucked in. It will ruin your marriage. |`|QTVjjOyRaa	Cheating is wrong, doesn't matter if through marriage, dating, or relationships.

I hate swingers, they ruin marriages, relationships, and any bonding, If you're not good enough for your girl, or she's not good enough for you, then don't be together, cheating will not bring you any closer, it's like a knife to both of your hearts!|`|G4HL8ZYsaa	I would only continue your friendship with them if you honestly enjoyed talking with them and being around them. But if your just befriending them simply for the sake of having friends, then I would cease having a close relationship with them. And if their swinging weirds you out, then defiantly stop.|`|5vPgeQHNaa	I think you should move away. Don't agree to being a swinger.|`|AA11442678	Not that I'm an expert on swinger couples, but I have a few friends who are into it, and they are very open with their definition of "marriage" and "couple."  If either of you are uncomfortable with the idea, try being upfront with the other couple - set those verbal boundaries and make it clear that you guys aren't interested but would still enjoy a friendship with them.  If they ever again bring up swingin' with you guys, then seek friends elsewhere.  Give them a chance first, though.<br>  <br>  That's just me.|`|ZuipHl3Eaa	Hiya!<br>  <br>  First, I want to put you at ease regarding swingers. My husband and I are active in the lifestyle and have several close friends who are couples and who made it clear they are not interested in joining or experimenting with the lifestyle... Swingers are very open minded individuals and the fact that they are swingers enables them to understand and accept others more so than those of a different caliber. They appreciate people who don't judge them for engaging in a lifestyle which is not conducive to most other couples. By showing them you approve of them as individuals, they are more likely to approve of you because you are individuals as well, sexuality should not be the basis for a friendship...<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!<br>  Dawn|`|mBc9zyoiaa	Swingers are normal people too, we have friends just like everyone else.  However, we prefer friends who are open-minded that we can discuss our lifestyle choice with without any judgement or without them automatically assuming we want to sleep with them.  That said, we tend to choose other swingers as friends, including swingers that they don't play with.<br>  <br>  Let your potential friends know that you are not interested in playing with them. If they are still interested in being friends then go with it.  You know their secret already so they have nothing to hide from you.  However, if they aren't interested in being just friends, they will let you know and you won't have to worry about the decision anymore.
o1VMX8fWaa	Honestly, I did the exact same thing to a dude in my class. I didn't hate him, like him, or have a "crush" on him I was just extremely sexually attracted to him. That may or may not be the case here but I'm sure she's interested. Casually ask her what her problem is. I wish the dude in my class had done that. Things might have worked out for the best. :) Good luck.|`|AA11280073	Ask her. Say, "Did I do something to make you angry?" Smile when you ask. If she reacts in a nasty way, you will know the type of person she is. Otherwise, it could clear the air.|`|8FuwpE56aa	go up to her sometime and ask whay she hates you. its that simple. it may b b/c of a rumor or your rep or something. just be honest and she will b too.<br>  <br>  good luck!!|`|wu2g3BtRaa	i don't think she's glaring at you cause she knows you like her and she's not interested.  are you sure this isn't her normal look?  what does she look like otherwise?  what does she look like when she smiels?  maybe she DOES need glasses.  what is she like when you talk with her... is she friendly?  if you haven't already talked with her, do; it's the only way you'll find out.|`|J1J47FIAaa	Try talking to her, you have nothing to loose right? <br>  <br>  Btw she might not even be glaring at you. Maybe its the way she looks at people.|`|sebhK7r7aa	She's probably checking you out.|`|7jlaeYKUaa	Well from a girls prospective i would move on. I glare at my mom all the time and im pretty sure im not checking her out sooo i think you can catch on. So ya you should find someone better. Shes not worth you|`|T8cq1qOmaa	probably she likes yhu.... wen yhu talk to her listen for clues dat give signals dat she probably might like yhu<br>  or yhu should ask y she stares... yhu may never noe wat she might say =]|`|z68ZLjpkaa	She thought you farted.|`|5up38DUlaa	maybe she has a crush on you and wondering if u like her back... or she thinks u don't want to be friends with her bcoz u don't talk that much with her.. she might think u dont like her..|`|u2yLV8jEaa	shes gay
R65Owmebaa	I understand this completely I was like this after many awkward /horrible relationships and dates. So I got sick of guys crap and just got my life together and focused on me for awhile.I just wanted to learn to be happy on my own and I was. I met my husband by chance a few months later...Some things happen when you least expect it. I am not saying you will meet the man of your dreams I am just saying just enjoy life right now no one said you have to be in a relationship. Have fun being you and you may meet some one down the road no one can predict the future just enjoy the moments in life for now.|`|AA12384954	Unfortunately some guys feel attracted to women who genuinely are avoiding relationships.  I know this too well.  Just because you don't feel ready to date or have other priorities in life at that time.  Not much you can do but do your best to avoid the party, social type situations where you meet them, avoid answering the phone or door.  Not much fun but that's just the way it is.  Some ignorant people will make assumptions on your behalf and make unpleasant remarks, but they are not the ones you want to befriend anyway.  Good luck!|`|2694a4bc591fcc77e5167b64748acc8caa	then don't get in one of course.<br>  you may change your mind, but if you don't it doesn't matter.<br>  <br>  (i kind of used to feel the same way, too. but then when i found the right guy i realized he was worth the work.  but so many aren't worth it!)|`|Evq7g2NCaa	Then don't be in one for now but who knows your opinion could change on this topic.|`|NYq3l3rGaa	then don't have one|`|sebhK7r7aa	Welcome to my world|`|OLpWRv2uaa	Or are you really just afraid you will never have one?|`|9zIB02nQaa	and|`|itfeXDRCaa	So is your question do you need to be in a relationship? Well I don't know how old you are, but if you are in elementary or something you will have different thought when you are older. Some do cause problems. And if you don't want to be in a relationship then you don't have to. But do you really wanna die alone never ever having a true love? Maybe you will find a couple of people and then just hate their guts after. But MAYBE eventually you will find someone you can get along with. Not every relationship works, but then again some do. =)|`|H5fEVUFsaa	If you don't want a relationship don't have one. And, if any guys ask you out don't make up a lie of why you don't want to go out with them, tell them the truth. Trust me, it helps a lot. And your right about how they are a lot of work. And, it takes forever to heal your heart if you get dumped or dump someone and feel bad about it. So, your totally right. Just, do what I told you and you'll be fine until you want to be in a relationship. Hope I helped. :-D|`|e5a37e7afe8ec6690c5df08cdf7e5e71aa	I felt this way when I was a teenager because you are right, they are a lot of work. I didnt want a bf because all my friends bf were jerk offs but this one guy came along and took my breathe away and he was so nice to me, sounds cheesy but I dont think you will feel this way when that certain one comes along. same goes for pets, I got this puppy, it was work to train him but when he grew up, he was the best dog. dont be so negative about it though. life comes in surprises.|`|eJ1am284aa	theres nothing wrong with that! The only problem is you may push away some really nice guys. but its no use pushing yourself to feel a certain way, its better to be comfortable. when the right person comes along you will know and feel ready. trust me, the past 2 yrs ive chosen to be single even though ive been asked out a few times. ive completely enjoyed it and now im dating a nice guy as i suddenly felt ready to give dating ago again. nothing wrong with your choices!|`|yOivjbuCaa	Finally!  An individual with a head on her shoulders.  And uses her head too.  Live your life, Toots.  Be free, happy, and alive.  I too am single and loving it.  The work that goes into a relationship SUCKS.  Busting your behind to please another person is so not cool.  That is why you got to do your own thing, and make your own moves.|`|gl3nT8Lxaa	well it doesnt matter if u want to be in a relationship or not, but im just sayin, wat, do u wanna die alone??? lol but so what? alot of ppl dont want to be in a relationship, just turn down evry person who asks u out unless you like them|`|Iz0NKhg3aa	Then don't get into one. Simple. No one has a gun to your head telling you to get into one. Relationships aren't everything in life and it's a good because it means you won't be distracted. Good for you!|`|RSyaABmNaa	its ok if u dont want a relationship<br>  but if u wanna get married or somethin u gotta put A LOT A LOT A LOT of work in it.|`|gQg3KdE8aa	its like this I don't have a tv and i don't want one what should i do?|`|VFCdX4Rfaa	than don't get in one..simple as that|`|t0TKMplmaa	it doesnt matter. just be happy =]|`|YpUhEviCaa	live alone for the rest of your life|`|cfc794c02beace0d0ed122ea3ddf8771aa	You're right about relationships being a lot of work!  If that's what you choose to do, then that's what you do.<br>  <br>  Sound like you know what may be best for you at this point in your life!  Too bad most people don't listen to their own advice.|`|hJLcqWKXaa	well it's your choice<br>  so if you don't want a relationship<br>  don't be in one lol|`|o6xLWwZvaa	Well you don't have to be in a relationship. You can stay single for the rest of your life. Remember its your life, you make as you please.<br>  <br>  <br>  IMO, when you are in love, its worth the hard work to keep the relationship happy.<br>  <br>  Pets are nice to have. <br>  <br>  Sounds like you don't want anything if it deals with work. Life is hard work, get used to it.|`|TepR1rACaa	Well you can always get a cat or 20. Good luck.|`|q7XSr1Lgaa	Then just don't get one....<br>  It's not like food where you  HAVE too have it, it's optinoal.|`|Wvj6o1XZaa	I don't see the question in this.

If shes a liar, shes not my woman : )|`|RSMKT3fIaa	well she should be very honest and really care for the person and try to obey as much as she can. and her heart should be purelly filled with lover and respect for the person.<br>  <br>  <br>  for me body counts but not that much what matters to me is the person.|`|6Hf2FbREaa	Looks count, but not necessarily GODDESS stature...cool, smart, masarap makisama, into a lot of stuff. adventurous.|`|xhapy2viaa	she has to be honest. I wouldnt like to be with a liar. Honesty is the most important thing in a relationship.|`|9VQoRNTKaa	Attractiveness is, of course, going to be the first thing seen.

yeGEagOBaa	maybe things ended on bad terms with her and they never had any good points in thier short relationship that made talkin good about her an option...he might of actually liked u and enjoyed spending time with u ...sometimes things just dont work out|`|I2PCl06Uaa	in fact u should stop to think any more about him. if he not speak he may talk later dont trust a guy who keep changeing Gf as like cloths. |`|AA10373401	and exactly your problem is?|`|XzsmYWOqaa	He respects you (maybe)<br>  <br>  He talks smack about the other girl cause he got so hurt, still loves her, but still so hurt and wants to get back at her for breaking his heart.
3566188061f294a16807056333d8ef6caa	Just say, "Sorry, I misunderstood..PEACE!" <br>  <br>  Then, move on with your life. What else can you possibly say to this guy?  You'll never convince him of the fact that he handled this all wrong so why even bother?  Some times, walking away with your dignity is the best revenge.  He'll bite his words later.  By then though, I think you'll be with someone much cooler and better for you.  <br>  <br>  Trust me..you'll thank me later.  |`|0B7E0ACpaa	I mean if thats going to make you feel much happier then yeah go for it.|`|hx9MbGrTaa	Yes you must give him a piece of your mind by thinking he does not exist for you now until he comes back to you for saying sincere "sorry" to you. Why should you waste your precious energy and peace of mind on such a fickle person?|`|o4jUjbIuaa	First ask him what the problem is. People break up all the time over stupid **** just because of their ego. One of you has to be mature. Try to talk about it instead of arguing.|`|Vm2dZOzVaa	Give him a piece of your mind in person. That way you can work it out easier.|`|ba60dd0df93da088e2288387c7eb0296aa	that would hurt, I think!<br>  No, seriously, have a mature talk with him. Guys these days are missed up; they want everything at the same time.|`|MuUZIpmdaa	lucky
Xi7yN6Zxaa	It sounds like she's just flirting and trying to sound cool and confident.  That's what I hate about text messaging is that you can't tell the person's tone when they say something like that.  I really don't think she's thinking what you're thinking, but you never know.  If I were you I'd talk to her over the phone or in person more than over text message.  That way you can tell what she means by her tone and if she's joking around or not.|`|CdBdP2ymaa	Texting is the stupidist thing on the planet....Shouldnt it have come before we had voice?|`|1hciyvKdaa	Id say, with all this texting your doing I feel like I am dating a jr high kid.|`|fxTNq3qlaa	If you guys have already spent 5 hours texting today your relationship is doomed before it begins.  It's going to explode into a ball of flames with texted name calling and accusations.  Make sure you don't lend her any money - you'll end up on Judge Judy and she'll make the both of you look like morons.|`|4d5247fbc8be95ded60ba90440fe55ecaa	I'd say if you actually wasted an evening texting for 5 hours it doesn't look good. What ever happened to TALKING to someone? In any case, here is a good suggestion: DON'T ANSWER EVERY SINGLE TEXT SHE SENDS!!!! There is no rule that you have to. It is ok to be busy sometimes. And if she is worth dating, she'll respect that. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|TPTpwarwaa	It does sound like she is a bit clicky, kinda obsessive...i mean she may be just really into you, but if you dont want that type of thing right now just go on the date and dont kiss or anything. I mean you dont want to ditch out on her, but make sure you tell you want to take things slow. It sounds like shes TOO into you.. and you aren't feeling the same for her (yet).|`|wu2g3BtRaa	suggestions?  if you don't want her all over you, constantly texting, calling, etc., then don't go out with her 'cause she sounds very needy... she is very much into you... but she's also needy.|`|Hvdb3pDCaa	How old are you guys?  <br>  It just seems a little pushy and immature at this point, but if she is young, than it is maybe not that immature for her age.<br>  <br>  Just see how the date goes, and take it from there.|`|0lqEiXxLaa	Come on dude...<br>  <br>  She obviously wants to go the full distance and will probably leave you if you don't make a move soon.<br>  <br>  Go to CVS and buy some condoms because you want to be safe.|`|z3J3CvAmaa	Lol...She just really likes you (: You're not overreacting at all ;) It's a good thing, honestly :D Life is too short to be taking her out and stuff to get closer x] Don't let it scare you ;p|`|1zSZ02KHaa	dude! you totally got this chick at your finger tips. go at it champ. you lucked out|`|6MyhyUDfaa	next thing you know, you both are in the bedroom|`|sh9xGy92aa	maybe she just moves fast<br>  or else shes desperate maybe?|`|ZMZzNkuMaa	tell her tu suck ur dick if she does she's just a hoe<br>  <br>  an attention hoe|`|lKcCSxS4aa	u lucky bastard|`|jdLY2Vlxaa	oh man huggin. sounds serious..|`|YtJ6zTPnaa	I will agree with just about everyone here that you lucked out with this one. She seems to be wanting more than just a hug. Just hang out with her and see what happens. But be sure to come prepared. Grab a box of Magnums or Trojans on the way there and keep 2-3 somewhere with you. Never bring just one condom. If it breaks (which can happen) you're out of luck so have an extra for backup. Plus its better to have some with you in case you might need them, than not having them when you do need them. Before you leave, put some in your jacket or car and keep them there for the night until you need them. <br>  <br>  Anyway, dont concern yourself too much about her being to forward with things like this. She's just hinting that she wants something so go with it.|`|f4626d8ab2971dbbdc53215d04053622aa	Well, go on the date. If she's still acting like this, then tell her you just want to be friends. <br>  <br>  But you're not overreacting, she is being a little bit forward.

Ms9ArphRaa	I think for guys porn is a way of living out their fantasies without actually cheating.  Lots of guys dream about being with a barbie doll type woman and this is a way for them to express this in a way that doesn't hurt anyone.  Most guys either can't get a girl like that or don't want the associated headaches they come with.  Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying you husband doesn't love you but most men, as much as they love their significant other, still want that ideal.  That's why I watch porn anyway and any guy who say he doesn't is a liar.|`|AA10409800	What question?  You just assume we know what the hell you're talking about?

That sounds like the stigma that bothers you most.  Please realize that some people have a slower time learning book material than others.  However, some of these slow learners do catch up and become better students than the rest of their peer.<br>  <br>  You will have to ask yourself if it is the embarrassment that is bothering you.  Because you said that this guy makes you feel wonderful and that he cares for you greatly are you willing to lose what you have because of learning ability?  I know in high school friends can be quite cruel and you are in a difficult dilemma.  However, you have to ask if you can deal with the embarrassment or is it better to end the relationship and move forward.|`|t56cq0ZKaa	Well bella, if you love this guy enough to be patient with him and you can be understanding to his small problem which sometimes can become extraordinary like in the movie "A Beautiful Mind" with Russel Crowe, then does it really matter? They say love is blind. If he's a great guy and you have fun with him do you think the grass is greener on the other side, not really. Search your heart and be fair with him and yourself. Let your heart not mind decide. I'm always unemployed sadly but my wife of 7 years loves me more then ever. There is nothing better if it feels right!<br>  <br>  Chow Bella!!!|`|HA4UhZTjaa	Just be there for him.  Who cares what other people think if you REALLY like this guy and enjoy his company.  If you act like his disability makes you feel uncomfortable, it will make him feel VERY uncomfortable.  Let him know that you are okay with him and that it is not his fault that he has a disability.  Maybe other people at school will follow your lead and have a little bit more consideration for people with learning disabilities.  I'm sure that he is a good person, so his disability shouldn't matter.   Hope this helps!|`|gh7bWR1uaa	Things would change between yall but if you love him/her then you wouldnt let that stand in the way of your realationship. Try and work it out.

And since you do give them money obviously the word got around.|`|dd1ed523a17927679c4955f404f3e139aa	Sounds to me like you need to hold out for a better class of fella. One of the downsides of the independence of women is that too many men no longer know how to treat a lady, let alone treat her any differently than a dude. The economic advancement of women has opened up a world of opportunity for players and schemers... there is nothing wrong with respectable, hard working men whose skills are limited... but a man should not ask for handouts or a leg up. You need to think enough of yourself to hold out for a winner and not a whiner.|`|wzqahEqiaa	You're looking for guys in the wrong places.  I've never gone to clubs before.  I have seen a lot of things on TV where people go to clubs.  I read a book by Steve Santagati that explains how he approaches women at clubs or bars.  The book is interesting and I learned a lot.  It's hard for me to believe that a man would put so much time, effort, and detail into explaining his experiences and preferences.<br>  <br>  Some men are insecure and disrespectful.  There are still kind, loving, giving, gentleman in the world.  My parents have been faithfully married for over 30 years.  I adore my father and he protects and respects me.<br>  <br>  Be sure check out the books below by Stephen Wood.  The videos about chastity (purity) may also be helpful.  There are a lot of different attitudes and perspectives in the world.  The best advice I can give is to know your standards and don't compromise just to please someone.
dCmSA6r2aa	all you can judge is how good the person is on giving you what you want and need|`|rMq9D06Faa	I think there is a correlation between kissing and sex.....<br>  <br>  However, there is NO correlation between how someone kisses and what kind of person they are.  It's possible for a nice guy and a jerk to both be good/lousy kissers.<br>  <br>  I am not a great kisser but any girl should wish they had me as their boyfriend...they would never regret it!|`|jQoYYR5saa	Not really. A bad person can kiss . Just as a good person can. As for the bed room same applies. |`|AA10292331	Kissing u cant judge, but of course in the bed room you can judge.|`|15eb8387d74986a6f6f9cf3828274860aa	Make your action perfect as far as possible .|`|GG51YaHLaa	Depends what you are trying to judge? Eg a man who doesn't know how to read a girl's body language isn't going to be a good kisser or good at pleasing her iykwim. Yep, this may mean a selfish personality, but it may not. |`|Xr4VGJEhaa	I think you can judge someone on how he or she kisses. if they have a sloppy kiss then there life is sloppy and so on.|`|K5Bm9KgDaa	YES.... YOU CAN FEEL THE SENSATION AND BODY RUSH..

NtojCW9Saa	Hell no - Id leave my husband. But knowing certain stories of this kind, I also know people that will stick to their man no matter what. It is a really teriibly story. To tell you the truth, i would totally disown you as a freind .... Terrible terrible story. Good luck with everything though. A baby is a blessing.|`|XTBlOf9baa	SUPPOSEDLY she is a "good friend" of yours yet you sleep with her husband, never told her before, and she has a medical condition that prevents her from having children and you can't be bothered to remember what it is? I'm glad I'm not your friend! You're the worst kind of human being possible.<br>  <br>  So you "unintentionally" became so drunk that you couldn't control yourself anymore? Who forced you to drink all that liquor? NO ONE! You drank it yourself, you're responsible for the consequences. The "I was drunk" crap doesn't work in the real world. And, no, if I were her I wouldn't forgive you and help you. As soon as I found out you were pregnant, I'd call up my lawyer and put the custody battle into gear. Think about it, she can't have kids, you're having his kid, they're married which indicates a more stable home environment in the eyes of the court, and I'm sure there's more. If I were her, I'd throw you out of my house, call the cops on you to get a restraining order, take you to court for custody of the kid so you don't ruin this kid's life with your clearly horrible judgment, and I'd never give you the time of day again. That's what "friends" are for... at least by the way you treat friendship!|`|GEOamw3paa	No I wouldn't forgive it..you are supposed to be her friend.  You don't take comfort in having sex with a friend's husband.  That kind of thing doesn't "just happen"  There is a thing called self-control and both of you failed to utilize it. How can she ever trust either of you again? What's going to happen the next time she gets in a fight with her husband or you get in a fight with your boyfriend?  This is going to shatter her, but you have to tell her.  It is better that she hear from you before she hears the news from someone else.  |`|c1gnFE8Gaa	You are a disgusting person who has no idea what this will do to your friend, you sound so relaxed about the whole thing it is pathetic.<br>  <br>  Your poor friend cant have kids and now you think it is ok to go and tell her you are having HER HUSBANDS baby, you are a freak.<br>  <br>  Just two people conforting each other, yeah right whatever, you are disgusting to the worst possible standard.|`|86b4fd85b1f89dd4383237042a6abbc1aa	Oh what a tangled web we weave|`|AA11391968	  First off, you need to find out if you are infact, pregnant.  Secondly,  is it possible that it is someone else's baby?  If not, then your friend's husband should tell his wife.  If you tell her, she may not believe it, or worse.  <br>    The fact that you state above that you "would try to pass the baby off as your bf'"s is despicable.   You can bet that her husband will want a paternity test as well.  I hate to say this, I really do, but people like you frighten me because you lack the ability to truly love and be honest.   |`|AA11996507	How about you get an abortion and get out of both your "friend's" and her husband's lives?  That would be the kindest thing you could do for her, if you care about her at all.<br>  As far as refusing to not have the baby - you can force the father to pay child support, but you can't force him to be a part of the baby's life.  If he refuses to help you with the raising of the child, you're stuck on your own. <br>  And lastly, there is no such thing as an "unintentional" pregnancy.  Just like there is no such thing as "I didn't mean it" and "it just happened".  What happened happened as the result of your choices and decisions.  You chose to take your clothes off and spread your legs.  He chose to stick it in.  And spare me the "I was too drunk to know what I was doing" excuse while you're at it.  If your drinking problem is so out of control that you genuinely cannot account for the things you do when you drink, you need serious help and are an even less likely candidate for motherhood.|`|3f74f589fd6d94e1a2e772781955e0f7aa	How sad it is when adults are so stingy and sinful. Because the sad part is that these adults never think about the poor little babies that get caught involuntarily in the destructive paths made before they are even born. Good going. I wonder how many lives you and him just jacked up....and all for a piece of azz. What a world we live in. <br>  Pathetic and disgusting. Hope she doesn't have a gun.....|`|RsJHmJKYaa	 Then if you were  full of grace you woud give the baby  to her and him. That is love. And no you should ...tell  him not her.,untill after she knows|`|kNNMIajqaa	you are the worst friend she ever known if it happen..i wish when when you get married,yournhusband will not do it in your friend too..|`|AA10373401	good luck|`|141429b21ae0709c3ec89fbf61b5e604aa	What makes you think your girlfriend wants to hear that you and her husband created a baby?  You are crazy if you believe that. The real reason you are wanting to tell her first is to gloat, and I do not approve.<br>  <br>  You don't need to tell either one of the married couple.  But you do need to tell your boyfriend.  You have a relationship with him, or had you forgotten?  Your relationship is just between the two of you.<br>  <br>  On another front, after you discuss this with the only person you are supposedly committed to (bf), then, after the baby is born, you can have the testing done.  If, at that time it's the other man's baby, you then have a reason to tell him.  Why would you EVER want to tell her?  That is so cruel, I cannot imagine why you'd want to do that.  It is tasteless, and ugly.<br>  <br>  You had no right to do what you did.  It didn't 'just happen.'  God forgives everyone.  But why don't you take a little responsibility for what you did by yourself?<br>  |`|KESlvKqQaa	You think you are pregnant, and you think it's his.  Tell HIM first, give him a time frame to tell his wife, and if he doesn't tell her by then, at that point you can tell her.  If you came to me and told me that, I would laugh in your face because I wouldn't believe you, especially since you are my "friend".  And be prepared for the DNA test after the baby is born.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  No, I wouldn't forgive you or him, and I certainly wouldn't help raise the baby.  I also wouldn't care that you were drunk, didn't mean it, didn't intend for it to happen, whatever, it was wrong.<br>  <br>  ADD: Ok, I went back and read some of your other questions, because I doubted if this was real the more I thought about it.  And yes, you're just making things up.  According to your other questions, two months ago you married a 68 year old with three grown children, a month ago you wanted to know how to convince your husband to send his 3, 5, and 8 year old children to boarding school, and three weeks ago you wanted to get married someday just for companionship.  So you are just a troll.|`|bYoKSMNKaa	Yes it is better to hear it from you - you owe her that much. You can say all u want that hes gonna help u but u cant make him help out (except for child support). I would never ever forgive you if u were my friend - NEVER EVER!  Even though it wasnt an affair it was horrible and pathetic - how gut wrenching - to be betrayed by your hubby and ur friend.<br>  <br>  I want to know why u didnt tell her earlier, or u only feel bad cos theres about to be proof of it. If u are not preggers are u still going to tell ur bf and ur friend? If u have a soul u will still tell them both.|`|vFUsJFY7aa	OMG............this is the part of life, that's actually life changing. I seems you dont have any regrets. I hope your not prego. this will ruin your friendship,her, and her marriage. Becare fulll!!! you telling this married man that you might be prego/is prego,.... He's going to protect his wife!!!! this wont be nearly as easy as you think. you are thinking about having your FRIENDS-HUSBAN'S BABY!!! <br>  <br>  ***** You need to tell her! she needs to know what friend SHE DOESN'T HAVE- and you need to be tested for HIV- U don't know how many times he's cheated on her- i don't think you were special*********|`|8j7zj9aKaa	She will never forgive you.. or be able to love the child.<br>  <br>  Why dont you tell her half the story.  Why dont you tell her that you were at a party and had an accident and got pregnant.  You can then tell her that you are not ready to be a parent, and you were considering adoption.  Knowing that she has problems, and you love her, you thought she might be a good parent.<br>  <br>  There is open adoption - where you get to visit the child and be a part of their life.  <br>  <br>  |`|c65d7e6592df4daae8ab2af6385c569faa	wow that is deep.  For the baby sake and for the sake of your best friend I think it's a good idea to tell her and say that you made a huge mistake that you cannot take back. I really don't think that you guys will be friends no more but you owe her the truth and nothing but the truth. As for the guy he mind as well get ready for the big "D" . That friend of yours is going to get paid no matter what...|`|0wPhMVFXaa	Make sure you are pregnant first. Then wait to find out how far you are as this could be you boyfriends baby.<br>  You need to get all the facts first before you split people up.<br>  Also if the baby is her husbands you need to tell him first as he at least has the right to know it is his child first. <br>  <br>  Good Luck and i hope everything will be ok|`|IqOXSm4gaa	Yeah she is a really good friend of yours and now you want to break her heart.<br>  <br>  You are disgusting.  I hope she slaps you down, you deserve it.|`|7IPDyLoBaa	With friends like you who needs enemies.|`|3Qp1sXFraa	Firstly, you need to find out if you truly are pregnant. Don't go getting crazy and telling the world, until you're absolutely positive. Secondly, you need to think about why your cheated--on your boyfriend, plus you decieved your friend. Thirdly, you need to sit both your friend and her husband down and tell them. Yes, at the same time. Be absolutely honest and leave nothing out. Tell your friend first what happened between you and her husband, then the latter part about being preganant.<br>  <br>  This will be hard, but for everything there is a consequence. And now you must fix things, even if it hurts.|`|EqbxEo55aa	I think that your reasoning for telling her is not very well supported, "Because what if the baby looks like her husband". Honestly, it doesn't matter how close the similarity is, I'm sure they wouldn't just to that conclusion if it was really just a one night drunken mistake. Why ruin your friends life? It will break her heart and you don't really deserve to be the mother of her husband's only child. You aren't his. I'm not trying to say you aren't a good person, just that this doesn't seem like the best decision for everyone involvded. Unless your bf demands a paternity test or something, just go with the flow. I don't think telling her sooner rather than later will really soften the blow at all, so you might as well wait until you are forced, if ever.|`|QZ0nUuOEaa	I definitely don't think you should tell her first.  If I were your friend I would not want to stay friends with you.  I don't care how drunk you were there is just no way you should have slept with him.  I don't know if you have thought this through enough, will your boyfriend stand by you and do you want him to.  I have, though, thought of an amazing thing you could do.  Have the baby and let her and her husband adopt it, that way she gets to have the baby she can't have, you may get to keep a good friend and you won't have to raise the baby as an unmarried mum.  I know that will take some thinking about but if you are young enough you can have another baby with someone you really love and you may make another woman very very happy.|`|YBtWbgGWaa	Well, it certainly is going to cause riffs and waves in everybody's relationships, but you're going to have the baby and you need the support as well.  The standard and traditional thing to do would be for the wife to blow up and ditch the guy and then for him to re-marry you (or somebody else). But who does that help?  A new life is coming into the world and that kid needs as much support as possible.<br>  <br>  But what if you could all be grown ups and work something out among you?  You might have to look outside the box of traditional monogamy though.  She can't have a kid, but does she want the experience of raising a kid?  Wouldn't it be great if that kid could have two mommies and a daddy instead of just a mommy and a daddy?<br>  <br>  Yes, you will need to tell her and it would probably be a good idea for you to tell her first.  You need her to understand the circumstances and to understand that you weren't trying to "steal" her husband away.  And to understand your intentions.  It might help to write her a letter so you can set all of your thoughts out calmly.  She will likely be quite pissed at you.  You have no control over that.  All you can do is to own up for the decisions you made.  Good luck.<br>  <br>  |`|gXihDFdxaa	GIRL, FOR REAL, I WOULD LEAVE HIM AND NEVER SPEAK TO YOU AGAIN IN LIFE. I know it was an accident? You slipped and his dick fell in for comfort...BULL. YOU KNEW WHAT YOU WERE DOING AND KNOWING THAT SHE COULD NOT HAVE KIDS....YOU ARE NOW GOING TO DESTROY HER MARRIAGE BY ASKING FOR CHILD SUPPORT. TASTELESS YOU ARE. EXCUSE FILLED YOU ARE. REGARDLESS OF HOW MUCH SYMPATHY YOU ARE TRYING TO MUSTER IN THE NAME OF BEING TRUTHFULL...YOU' RE NO FRIEND TO EITHER OF THEM AND YOU DO NOT VALUE YOURSELF ENOUGH TO NOT SHARE YOURSELF WITH A MARRIED MAN....ANY MARRIED MAN...YOU ARE LOW GIRL, YOU ARE RANK!|`|uamd8G51aa	You and him should talk about what you want to do first & take it from there.....You should both have an idea of what steps you are going to take before you tell the wife. You should also give the husband time to let this settle before you tell the wife that way he is come & knows what he is going to say to his wife to let her down as easy as possible. but I would suggest adoption. that kid shouldn't have to know that his father cheated on his wife and his mother had sex with a married man. Do you know how this will affect your child? Do you know how this will affect your friend? Do you know how painful it is to not be able to have children? Don't expect her to be like ok i forgive you lets all be a happy family because I doubt that will happen

First of all, your mom called you ugly. No good mother says that seriously. Your dad sounds like a power hungry abusive control freak. You should probably tell somebody at your school about it. If you're close to 18 tough it out as much as possible. If you're not I think you should go to an aunt or uncle and tell them what's going on.

You seem to be living in an abusive family. It's not normal for parents to treat their children like that. Please don't feel badly!!!!! You have to remain strong!!! If you can talk to someone like a teacher, counselor or a church member (priest) or a good friend, please do so!!! Don't keep things inside and to yourself, you will only feel more hurt. Find someone you can trust and lean on them for some support because it seems like you won't get any at home. Very sad indeed. :(   Try to stay positive Loves!!<br>  <br>  Wishing you wellness!<br>  J|`|AA12200214	Ok I see you answered my first question, you are only 14.  That is not an insult trust me, but it is common for 14 year olds to have this problem with their parents, ask your friends.  <br>  Teenage years are the hardest years of all, for both you and your parents.  You are growing up so fast, they are afraid of loosing control, and of course you are getting older so you want more freedom, and those two aspects often collide into a mess.  <br>  There is one big difference, the thoughts of suicide, those should never be taken lightly no matter whether you think you mean them or not.  You need to discuss these feelings with your parents, and if you cannot do that, you need to talk to another adult you trust, a teacher or minister or school counselor, please do that, do not waste the best years of your life being sad, this is time you cannot get back.<br>  Know this, you are not alone in your feelings, and yes, you can get help for the sadness.  I use to think my father was the absolute worse parent in the world, he yelled all the time, he was so strict, he never let me do anything I wanted to do and he was just plain old mean all the time and I was afraid of him....or so I thought.<br>  I am 54 years old now, he has been gone for over 3 years, and God I would give anything to have him back, its surprising how smart and what a great parent he was after I was about 18...and man after 25 he was a freaking genious!!!  Good luck dear, and please talk to someone about your feelings...not just yahoo questions.|`|OEaU9w6haa	You need to talk to a school counselor or pastor.  This is not right - parents should not demean or berate their children.  No parent is perfect and no child is perfect.  I believe that children should watch how they speak to adults, but that is a two way street - adults need to watch how they speak to kids.  <br>  I'm serious - speak to a family friend, a friends parents, teacher, principal, youth leader, pastor - someone.   If that person won't help you - go to another person.   It sounds to me like your parents are miserable people and not happy with their own lives, but it is a real shame that you already feel that way and you are just a kid.  If you are feeling like killing yourself - you need help - maybe you are too sensitive or emotional and talking to a doctor may help you - or even some anti- anxiety medications may be needed - but please - seek help.  <br>  I'm sorry you have to live like that and feel that way.  From my own personal experience - their remarks and treatment of you reflects back to how unhappy they are and how miserable they feel - they want you to hurt and be miserable too. <br>  Good luck honey. |`|TIN66x5Xaa	oh no, sweetie! it's not your fault! And i am sure you are beautiful.<br>  <br>  Sometimes parents can get irritated by life and that irritation can easily get taken out on their kids. I think that is the case here. It's not right that they make you feel this way! Don't EVER think about killing yourself! It's your life, you can move out the house after you are 18 and you have a long road ahead of you! Don't let them get you with their threat or hurtful things they say.  I am sure they love you, but sometimes parents forget how to show their love for you from too much stress or other things.<br>  <br>  Nothing is wrong with you, if i were in your shoes, i would feel bad too. You know what i suggest you do. Go find a good good book and dive yourself in it. Write your feelings into a journal, talk to your friends or teachers about it.  <br>  <br>  Worst comes, you can always call the cops, verbal abuse and threatening is illegal, however going to that extreme might not be good for the long run.<br>  <br>  But mack my word, don't think about hurting yourself! Life has so much wonderful things to offer, don't let them ruin it for you.|`|XhHfGW19aa	Please don't kill yourself. You are a great individual,<br>  you have a lot ahead of you, and are you going to<br>  throw away all that potential just because your dad<br>  threatens you? You're only 14 years old, who knows<br>  what you can become in the future, a teacher, a <br>  doctor, a lawyer, anything! Don't let your dad stop<br>  you from living the life you were given. If I were you<br>  I'd talk to someone I trust, not a teacher or a guidance<br>  because they tend to share information around, I'd talk<br>  to a relative, your grandma or aunty, or anyone you are<br>  close to. Maybe your best friend's mom...somebody!<br>  Just know you are better than this, and your dad is <br>  an asshole he has no right to treat you this way because<br>  I know he wouldn't like it if he were treated that way. And<br>  PS: I don't think I have to tell you this, but you aren't talking<br>  back your simply explaining yourself and answering his<br>  questions...so he's the disillusion one. |`|guz5jskdaa	No there's nothing wrong with you but your dad seems to be the one with the problem. Talk to one of your aunts or maybe your grandparents. Tell them exactly what you told us and hopefully they'll knock some sense into your parents. Your dad seems to be controlling, definitely talk to someone about it and have them help. And please don't kill yourself, you have so much to live for, think about it. I'm sorry, I hope things get better for you. Goodluck and hang in there.|`|xBhATA65aa	Darling, I know at times it seems hard to understand your parents. And I'm not going to say that "they do this because they love you..." because you will hear that from everyone. Yes, your parents love you. But everybody makes mistakes, maybe your Dad or Mother had a rough day. Our parents go through things that they don't tell us about, things that are very stressful to them. So tell your mother and father how you feel. Take a gentle aproach and say how you feel. <br>  <br>  I used to feel like this too but one day I'd had enough so I told my parents how I felt. I said "Mom, Dad I need to talk to you. I feel like you don't love me and I feel like I'm not living up to expectation. I really want to please you both, because I love you, but sometimes you both just seem like you could care less about me." And since then I have had no more trouble with my family. <br>  <br>  Sucide, drugs, alcohol, none of that is EVER an answer. I know you may be scared to talk to your parents. But just take some time to calm down, then tell them how you feel. They are YOUR parents they love you (it may not seem like it, but they do), and they will understand if you take the time to talk to them.
bcbYkBjRaa	Give him a little space. Don't force anything but still be nice just not needy. For some reason or another he is put-off. This is a lame situation for you and I am sorry about that. There is no good answer because the ball is in his court and he is not helping. Its like a game of tennis: you hit the ball to him and he just lets it go by. Its not going to help to keep hitting more balls at him. Hes blowing it though. Some woman after having a kid might be hard to get in the mood.|`|AA11363680	Why is that women can't seem to understand that men sometimes don't always want sex? It's only been four days!!! Maybe whatever you've been arguing about for the last 8 1/2 months is getting in the way! So deal with that. Not argue about it more, but actually deal with it properly. Then give him a couple of days to adjust and if he hasn't initiated then it's your turn.<br>  <br>  And for future reference, guys don't like having to always initiate either. It's nice if she wants to start something too you know.|`|AA10373401	take a breather|`|JFji7sjqaa	It is only 4 days and you mention cheating- that of course you won't do so don't mention it.<br>  I learned that every individual has a different definition of what love is and how they want to be shown they are loved. Take an example of a man who does not want his woman to be clingy or dislikes public displays of affection but if his lady cooks his favorite meal or goes hiking with him when she would rather be at yoga class, he feels special and appreciates her. There is a warm connection and he responds to her respect for him. The ideal situation sees him doing the same types of things for her. It sounds as if there is little emotional communication between the two of you. This is something you must build. Get a sitter and start talking without blaming and talking about the sex angle., You might have a problem of  your own equating sex with approval.
FhWOpW4waa	Chances are, she just needed a shower.  Girls sweat just like us.  And they have a lot more nooks and crannies down there for things to collect in.  <br>  <br>  Ya, its a turn off.  But you will learn as you date, girls are human too.  They burp and fart.  They sweat and get dirty.  Its not romantic, and its certainly not sexy, but its life.<br>  <br>  If she smells bad the next time you have sex, talk to her about it.  She may not even know its off putting.  Be polite about it, but don't be afraid to bring it up.  You can guarantee if you smelled like a locker room, she'd let you know :)|`|M62WPprsaa	Tuna Cat ewwwww..... but it's probably a good thing you asked this question. As you can see by the other answers, it actually is common, most notably right before or during the period. If that persists, then she has poor hygine and is not taking care of herself properly; at that point it's comparable to you not brushing your teeth for an extended period of time and not caring. |`|ijmcG1ziaa	relax.  she just has an imbalance in her system, its not because shes unhigenic.  and no, dont do that, just give her some live yogurt.  that should help her.|`|9fAHd15Caa	okay don't go for the other girl... break up with your gf if your no longer attracted to her and if your still attracted to her then confront her and tell her tht she smells|`|AA11450203	Obviously the smell is an obstacle that ruined the sexual experience for the both of you.  If you want to be with her you will have to be honest and tell her about the problem.  She may be resentful and that will cause bad feelings between the two of you.  However, if you're not that close to her just call the relationship off and don't mention the problem.<br>  <br>  It all depends on what your heart tells you and according to your response the two of you aren't that close.  Don't beat a dead horse and move forward without hurting the other girl's feelings.|`|4lEWhkVEaa	You should have talked to your girlfriend about the odor. I know it's hard because you don't want to hurt her feelings, but that smell could have been the sign of a vaginal infection. You could catch her infection and/or make her infection worse for her by ignoring it. Going with another girl is just immature. It shows that you don't care about your girlfriend. Besides, there's no guarantee that when you pull her underwear off hers won't smell too.|`|ZgHXy5QUaa	maybe thats just the smell? have you ever SMELLED VAJEEN BEFORE?<br>  if it was a bad smell she was probably starting her period, i know mine does right before that time of the month. YUCK.<br>  but yeah if you like her alot, then don't.<br>  but if you're seriously concerned, tell her to take a shower before you two do something next.<br>  or if you're really erotic just take a shower with her and get a scrubby and scrub it for her lmao|`|VANvNYEyaa	dear lord dont break up with her over the smell. im sure she is aware of it and embarrassed about it herself. im sure shes already trying to take care of it as well. Its probably an infection that can be cured with a cream and NO its not contagious. Every girl gets it its normal. just give her a week to try to clear it up before sex again|`|14sTdBPaaa	your girl need to clean her vagina with a douch, and she might be having some kind of disease, she needs to go get a check up... and you, you are a fockdup person already by wanting to break her up for another girl so mine as well, since it seem like you going to do it anyway, now or later...|`|rEh0mhezaa	why are you with her in the first place? her personality or sex?<br>  <br>  if it is #2, move on. you dont deserve her.<br>  <br>  <br>  answer mine, girls?: <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20081008134408AAvoaWA&r=w">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|6WKYxnLfaa	Seriously every girl has some type of smell down there don't break up with her over something stupid like that|`|kYa44IQhaa	thats gross|`|JZmYuDPkaa	alright yeah that's gross..but if you really legit like her your not going to break up with her over something stupid like that.

A simple washing will make the smell go away. Maybe she should bathe instead of shower or just scrub extra hard.|`|m5uzV6uqaa	You're a jerk if you break up with her over that. You obviously don't care about her. She may have some sort of infection. Talk to her and tell her gently. Don't dump her over this - be a man.

AA10539883	well, its going to be hard to explain, but i would love to date you. you sound unique, in a way that you are talkative, energetic, braggy, yet modest, and it sounds like you are the life of the party (fun to be with) .  But it still depends on your age. You sound like you are 14. Im 15, so I'd be fine with that. I also know that girls hate it when guys say something like this: nice body. But, it is true. and no, I am not a perv. who only wants to see you naked. But it sounds like you want to show off your body to other, and are self-confident in yourself. good work! to finalize, yes you sound gorgeous, and yes, i would date you.<br>  <br>  If you want to upload a picture, depending on the computer, right click or CTRL-click your picture, then click something like show image or view image, and it should come up in a different page, and just copy the link, then post it here. but to do that, it has to be a picture from facebook, myspace, etc. then, that way, if somebody doesnt have accounts n those websites, they can still see the picture, because that is all that come up. for example: <br>  <a href="http://photos-e.ak.fbcdn.net/photos-ak-sf2p/v148/221/79/623190181/n623190181_1647628_6941.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://photos-e.ak.fbcdn.net/photos-ak-s...</a><br>  im the second to the right. and that picture is about a year and a half old... just in case you were wondering. the boy on the other side of the girl is my twin brother. <br>  but hey, add me to your favorites, and send me a picture once you get the picture to work, and you can provide a link for me! send it through email also if you want! jaja... ---waiting---|`|LZuLpEZvaa	Don't listen to that ***** CuTiE?

You sound attractive, but you might just not have the confidence to go up and start flirting with one. Guys are very open to communication with any woman. The odds are in your favor.

Not sex in general, just sex with you.  It has nothing to do with you, he would do the same thing even if he were shacking up with a porn star.  Everything you will hear on this forum is a short term idea.  There is little you can do.  He will change or not as he will.  As far as you getting some - I would suggest a good swingers club.  Unattached women are always welcome and it is the safest place you will ever be.  Good luck.|`|ncWV2FwLaa	you can not compete with the hand.no one knows how to please ourselves as much/good as we do.|`|mJiO0LYyaa	sex addicts anonymous|`|4048ad82d67909905629720173b0aa1caa	DIY|`|7yWFoWcJaa	get a toyboy|`|2TQixstDaa	Definitely watch porn if your husband can't satisfy you. If you aren't getting satisfaction from your partner, you have to seek it elsewhere, and unless your husband will allow an open relationship or you decide to have an affair, that elsewhere is masturbation. Nothing wrong with it--if your husband does it, you should too.<br>  <br>  Definitely see a sex therapist, because this situation is very wrong. Both parties should be satisfied, and you aren't. Your husband might be unhappy too, if getting in fights is harming his sex drive. A therapist might not solve the problem, but at least you'll be addressing it.<br>  <br>  Also note that because of hormones, pregnant women often have far more active libidos than usual. However, men may be more reluctant to have sex with a pregnant woman. For example, Elvis Presley found his wife repulsive after she got pregnant. Who knows what your husband's problem is? But you've got to address it, because "going nuts" is not healthy for you.|`|b04e3750e3441e3335c8fe8f4e21fc66aa	In any relationship where there is a domination of the women in any sense or humiliation towards husband from the wife, it is going to affect the sex life, drastically, how much is a subject matter of each case!!!<br>  <br>  Check the cuase of fighting or domination and see where correction can take place.<br>  There are many things in the family ups & downs which should be within unless both need outside help. <br>  <br>  <br>  
TuaDHolKaa	I am 38 and still a virgin.  I have to be honest and say it was because of introversion and poor social skills more than purity.  However, I am confident that many guys would perceive a mid-30s female virgin positively.  They might want to know why the long wait but I believe their elation would overcome any negative feelings.  <br>  <br>  Good luck and don't waste it on just any guy!|`|xJBJn6dOaa	I think there are plenty of men who are also saving themselves for marriage.

If this is a moral decision and you are with other guys who aren't seeking sex initially...then its a positive. If you are out at bars or meeting guys at work, you will be seen as damaged. Personally I see it as a positive. |`|4RiziMD0aa	I think that's wonderful. You really stuck to what you believe. Don't give up now you've worked too hard. Good Luck on finding that right person. When you do it will be so worth it that you have saved it for him. And try go looking for him keep your eyes open. Have you ever considered joining a dating site like match.com?|`|AA10409800	I don't.<br>  <br>  |`|fH5n6dw4aa	I'm near 30 and also a virgin waiting till marriage. I totally applaud you on your decision. There are not too many treasures like us nowadays. I've had men respect me for being a virgin, for it truly shows good morals and strong commitment. Just think, we don't have to worry about STD's, pregnancy scares, or experiencing side effects from birth control pills. I'm on a dating website where I'm making friends with guys. That way, the guys will get to know me better before getting serious.<br>  <br>  By the way, I have a girlfriend who's 35 and also a virgin waiting till marriage. Would you like to meet my best friend who lives in Chicago? He's 35, still a virgin, and only wants to marry a virgin. He thinks virgins are special:)|`|AA12275607	I think it's commendable. I think your man would even appreciate YOU more. Not too many 35 year old virgins are around today. <br>  <br>  At least you are showing him that you equate Sex with Love and Commitment. The pressure/problem comes in when you broadcast to everyone that you are a "35 y-o virgin". Not that it is not something to be proud of but just remember that at this stage some people, even your friends, are more focused on seeing you "pop the cherry" as opposed to making sure your find the right someone. Remember at your age you don't want to have sex just because. I had a friend who gave hers up at 32 and the guy walked away after. She almost went insane.<br>  <br>  How about you let them know you are interested in finding love than letting them know that you have never had sex. |`|AA10478165	It is ok to do what ever you want to do! I bet you would find millions of guys wanting to help you with that right here on Y.A. and if I wasn't so old and ugly I would be first in line! But if you haven't ever had sex that would make three cherries! I bet you get a million answers to this one! Good luck.|`|6181098e678ac09da6cdf85baad14dc1aa	wow    that would be sweet. no worrys about diseases or std's     nice and fresh    very pretty and brand new looking    just don't let them know your a virgin till your ready to tell them.   you don't need to tell them either till after and then surprise the hell out of them<br>  |`|p4zASJYYaa	Wow. Good for you. I think you are fine! Any real man who loves you will respect you and be so in awe because of you. Keep it up and don't let anyone tell you otherwise. You will give your future husband such a wonderful and precious gift!! |`|Gl8qbSezaa	I think guys like women that are still virgin they know you not sleeping around. Sometime i wish i was a virgin and i'm 28. Yes remain a virgin till you get married.|`|lZVtLvkGaa	I appreciate waiting until marriage, but at 35, you need a good balling<br>  You'll feel better|`|MX3kORmLaa	It's fine and commendable if that's what you want and believe. It's actually refreshing. Where were you before my heart was broken :)|`|2OehB5Dnaa	I waited until I was 30, but not by choice (not very smooth with the ladies) and not for marriage.  I had considered going to a brothel just to get it over with, then I met someone.  The whole experience was far less than I had built up in my mind, so I was disappointed that I waited so long for such a let-down.<br>  <br>  When I met my wife, she had A LOT more experience than I, and I was thankful for that.  Being a virgin does not mean anything to me, but you have to ask yourself what it is you now think you're missing that you're considering doing something you have held off on until now.  Virginity really is nothing more than a senseless religious stricture; I never really understood why an all-knowing, all-powerful (but unseen) God would care so much about a puny human's sexuality.  There is no real reason to wait until marriage.  <br>  <br>  In the end, be sure you don't do anything now that you'll regret later due to temporary feelings, and be safe if you choose to change your mind. |`|O1yFzNLVaa	Your a rare women, be proud that you have preserved your<br>  Body. What you need to do is start dating, not sleeping around.<br>  Get to know a guy, like his habbits and his stability.

1Yb3020vaa	This is a hard one.  It's tempting to say "let her go, and if she comes back blah blah blah" but I don't know if that's really the truth in this situation (although it is true sometimes).<br>  <br>  The real truth is that you can't un-love someone.  I know that sounds silly, but I mean it.  Once you love someone, you have given something of yourself to that person, and you can't get it back.  Memories, good and bad, will be there forever.  She will always remember the reasons she fell in love with him, how she felt the first time they kissed, and she will always see the sadness in their parting.<br>  <br>  That, however, does not mean that she doesn't know what she's doing, or isn't capable of making a true commitment to you.  It actually can help her make a better commitment, because she can use what went wrong in that relationship to make the one with you stronger.<br>  <br>  It may be true that she's using you, doesn't really love you, etc. but I have a feeling that it isn't.  Think hard about this before you make any drastic decisions.|`|yfxM0P8taa	If she is really still in love with her ex, then she is not committing to you.<br>  You are being used to help her get over him, to use an old fashioned expression, you are catching her on the rebound.<br>  |`|6yn7lUsaaa	Let her go, because you need someone's undivided love and won't share it with another man.|`|JzY8x9Umaa	But your not the love of her life ......and thats the problem.

One is advised to marry someone of Christianity beliefs. Trust me, no matter what religion you are referring to, if you change your whole belief system because of "love" and not because you genuinely thirst for the teaches of that religion, then you might as well be an atheist.|`|foAJ9mjxaa	I just recently got out of a relationship with someone who was very strongly Christian, and I'm Buddhist/Atheist.<br>  <br>  For us it worked great, because we were both open minded and respectful of each others choice, because it is your choice and your choice alone.|`|kdynjOkMaa	DO NOT DO IT! If love forces you to change yourself, it's not love.<br>  <br>  and believe me, it won't last... if he is more into his "label" than you. |`|vNDGas4Baa	I'm an atheist who somehow has always ended up with Catholics, though ranging from mostly lapsed to regular church attendee.  I'm not really in a position at this point in my life where I'd need to change or have a discussion about it.  Sorry if that's not a full experience, I guess I could have one in the future.  I don't make religion a big part of my relationship and as long as the person I'm with is ok with that and with me, it's fine.
WC2Dk860aa	Not that I or my girlfriend is aware of.<br>  <br>  The Bible tells more about marriage and basic moral tenants (like having forgiveness, integrity, sharing love, and being truthful) You know, the big stuff...not something this detailed.<br>  <br>  How old are you?  If you are a teenager, it might explain why his parents are so watchful.  They might not know you as well, and might be afraid of things happening between you two that would be out of their control (like sexual activity that they might not approve of or drug use, or other concerns that parents have with their teens.)<br>  <br>  I think the best that you can do now is try to spend time with your boyfriend and his family...it takes time for people to build up trust.  After they get to know you and realize that you are harmless, then it will get better.<br>  <br>  Just start small, like asking to go to a movie alone, or go to dinner alone.  If they want, put a time limit on it, and call if you are going to be late for an unforseen reason (fatal accident closed a road or locked keys in car or something).  When nothing bad happens, they will see that you are mature enough to handle your relationship together, and you can ask for more privacy.<br>  <br>  They only act like this because they worry about and love their son.  Especially mothers.  Some mothers have a very hard time letting go of their sons.  Lol,I should know.  My mother put my girlfriends through hell in high school.  It wasn't until I entered college and started living on my own that she realized that she had little control over my relationships.<br>  <br>  I'm sorry that I can't give you a more immediate solution, but sometimes these things don't have a simple answer.  In the meantime, just invite him over to your house alot, if your parents are more comfortable giving the two of you space.<br>  <br>  Best of luck!  I understand what you are coming from.|`|bb6738ca3416c2abf7463cd28f1bf069aa	You are lucky you do not live in the Bible days, when children didn't listen to their parents some of them were taken to the gates of the city and stoned to death. Look in the book of Proverbs, it is full of scriptures about raising children,until you are married and have a spouse you are to honor your father and mother always and it says once you are married to one another then you are to cleve until thy husband and the 2 of you can be your own boss, if there is such a thing. Rules and boundaries are for your own protection until you become an adult.In fact the Bible says if you do not correct your children you do not love them, and that the blueness of a wound chases away evil and will save your child from Hell. It also says even a child can be found out if he is full of evil or good. That is just a few, look them up and see how many you can find. Good Luck!|`|pa1wANPRaa	"I'm looking, I'm looking...

D0wFwBu5aa	This is a classic question and many people ask this question but never find the answer.<br>  <br>  When I need to just get away for a while I take a walk and I usually go to a pond, garden or beach. Its very peaceful and it gives me the space to have metal clarity because there are no distractions in these areas. It's magical what can happen when you're in the serenity of nature.<br>  <br>  I also like to journal and dedicate some time to personal thoughts and deeper issues.<br>  <br>  Here's a exercise you can try to calm yourself down.<br>  <br>  First find a quiet place (maybe nature or if this isn't possible sit in the closet or in the washroom with the door shut).<br>  Close your eyes and talk a deep breath in and count 1 and then exhale and count 2 and only focus on breathing and counting, you should not be thinking about anything else and keep doing this until you reach ten. <br>  Eventually you'll be able to do this for longer of periods of time. This should provide you with some very deep time with yourself and should help you relax.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps<br>  Tony<br>  <br>  |`|KZfYzhZRaa	i just put my ipod on and loston to slow music, do this durring the night around nine, also drinking a lot of tea helps, right now my parents are getting a divorse because i saw my dad kisses another woman and i told my mom, every since then i thought it was my fault and i still do but im not so depresses and angrey and sad all the time, i know how you feel i honestly do, just try it it realy helped me!|`|ch6g2UzMaa	Different things.

In effect not relaxing IS relaxing. Give yourself time to feel depressed and just be honest about it not looking for the way out. Writing and music help me express it in a way that I can see it better for what it is. Love encompasses sadness and anger. The opposite of love is indifference.

Worry will do too much damage to your health so you need to stop. For example, if you wanted to be a certain height to play in a certain game, do you think worrying about it will make you taller? If you have a certain dream about your future do you think that worrying about it will make your dream come true? Of course not. You need to do what you can and understand that if you do your best, then that is all you can do because you have no more to give. You can do not more because its ALL you can do. No one knows what the future holds. If you were to die today, you worried about tomorrow for nothing. |`|mwdxW5fRaa	Chillllllll|`|AA10373401	live each day as ur last and enjoy is|`|yigpBdU1aa	sign up for a yoga class, they really help

lO3Py7Ciaa	It all comes down to protection and the basic instincts of men. As in cave man days men wanna protect women. A women who is smaller than them or skinnier than them is perceived as someone who needs more protection. In modern times it comes down to preference, what a man wants more. I'll give you an example: I am a 5'4 guy with wide shoulders who is a bit of a dork. So i want a women who is smaller than me, just as dorky. Curves don't matter, as long as she is somewhat smaller than me. Now that is the perfect situation. It doesn't always happen like that and it's the prefect situation because i perceive that person as more in need of protection. <br>  <br>  That example translates into all relationships. We as men want to be able to stand up to other males who want our women and it becomes easier when that women is more in need of that protection. Strong women don't need it as much just like big Amazonian women don't need it.<br>  <br>  Now if a man has the foresight and is looking for a long term relationship or even marriage he wants the skinnier woman because she will, most likely, grow older better. Stay skinnier longer, keep her health longer and pass her genes on to better generations of people. MOST men do not have that foresight<br>  <br>  So Why do men like skinny women? That is your question. They are the type of women that have been idealized for generations ever since fashion magazines and T.V.. We have been programed to look at them first. To look at their beauty as perfection incarnate. A lot of men, me included, have started to see that a good woman is a good woman whether or not she is super skinny or even particularly hot. Smart men like a women who is a little curvy and has a little self confidence issue because she is less likely try to control the relationship  and be a total B!^ch. <br>  <br>  Sorry for the long winded answer but I've been waiting to give my opinion on the subject.|`|lAJ9EVhiaa	Models are beautiful.

Does he have children?  <br>  And one more thing...always remember this, if he would cheat on his wife, he would eventually cheat on you.

Or may be more serious and wants to cheat on his wife with you; how would you feel about ruining a woman's life for a game of "blink".|`|lGQ0dRUzaa	he is married... so I wouldn't worry about what it means unless you wanna be a home wrecker.|`|o2se5pSKaa	He could very well just like your eyes and like starring at them....<br>  but the reality is that you should leave well alone and just keep friends seems he is married cause it would only cause unnecessary tention and arguing and labelling that i am sure you really dont want....
KNaXSLLDaa	Confidence, but not to the point where they feel like you may be too concentrated on themselves. Someone that is not afraid to do things that may be out of the ordinary, take risks and is motivated in moving forward with their goals in life, such as making a family, and being financially stable. Honesty is a major plus, to be real with what you want and dont want, and to fight to be with the one they love. <br>  Being a friend, being there when it counts the most.<br>  |`|Hd1gPr5oaa	I asked my sister and she said she likes a guy with<br>  a nice smile, nice teeth, nice eyes, nice lips, clean looking ie; freshly cut hair, shaved face, clean finger nails ect.. she always said he has to be romantic, caring, loving, passionate & of course with a good sense of humor :)<br>  <br>  hope this helps|`|WkA8UPflaa	smart, funny, inner strength, sarcastic(sometimes), needs to know how to have a serious convo. every once in awhile. spontaneous, adventurous, likes sports, likes to just have fun and do random things.

I've met a few who don't, but I always wind up with the cuddlers.<br>  <br>  When men complain about it, it's often because they were hoping for a bit more than just cuddling.|`|4YLxIz8Uaa	i love cuddling. what im guessing the guys are complaing about is the girl not doing anything else while cuddling. thats what me and my friend complain about lol|`|1uLfl0sXaa	Depends on who is cuddling whom|`|cHY5aV8aaa	Yeah most do.............WTF ALL OF THEM DO|`|BmurRetTaa	depends on what type of guy you are cuddling with|`|jum176oKaa	yes very much so|`|TlvgxkMwaa	yea we do|`|jq93WDL7aa	Well, my guy knows I like it, so he likes to do it to please me.<br>  <br>  I kinda think that's good enough.

AA10373401	we think of them just as we think of any other girl|`|l1pewZpaaa	One of best friends is the Spanish looking kind of Filipina girls, and she is completely gorgeous! So is her mom and her younger sister. They all have have really long dark hair and dark eyes and dark tan skin. Theyre not "slender", they're more curvy, but definitely not overweight. My friend is about 5'2, her mom is 5'0, and her sister is abot 4'10 or 4'11. My friend gets all the guys.<br>  <br>  However I have another Filipina friend who looks chinese. She has very coarse dark hair and she's about 5'5 and very slender. She also has dark tan skin. She's really pretty too, but she doesnt get alot of guys for some reason.|`|0jYKeIEGaa	I think that the filipina girls I have met are mostly slender, nice personality, mostly pretty, defer to their boyfriends or husbands. Some are hispanic looking, some more asian looking. I would love to meet a nice filipina girl.|`|HFbY9PYzaa	Love them they usually have nice bodies and good fashion sense and personality and always upbeat and there is this one smoking hot one in one of my classes.|`|QKSLx8fqaa	i know a couple and one of them is a good friend of mine i love the way some of them look <br>  <br>  i honestly dont think of them any differently then any other girl|`|mCoipTkbaa	they are normal people, and they can breath just like anyone else!!!
4WIi7SlJaa	For one take a breathe and realize in no way are you being unreasonable. For one your fear stems from your concern from your child not from what you may think as insanity. You are just acknowledging that you love your son-sooo much so that you see that relationships can blur and hide what we would not want to see. I am sure no mother would want to admit that their lover was doing such things to their child. I can empathize with your fear. But I also feel that maybe light dating and terms that are set by you would allow you to breathe and trust that with these terms you are not putting yourself or your son in danger. Go ahead and date but again remember that just because you invite him him to your home doesn't mean he has the right to intrude into your lifestyle, do not feel bad or torn for giving pieces yourself to your lover. If he cannot understand your fears to protect your son from the blind evil of the world then he does not have the patience to love and understand you. The only way to have trust is time, you cannot openly invite a starnger but as you say no matter how long you know someone they will show and rear a face of utmost disgust as to disappoint and hurt beyond measure. It is no fault of yours but the man's if he molestation of your son occurs. But I know mother's are prone to blame themselves for their child's hard and rough spots in life, because infinitely a mother's love is everlasting. You yourself do not have misplaced fears but should instead set terms is my advice.<br>  Like he may come over, He cannot spend the night for so and so long-then maybe. He will not be left alone with my son until I feel and know things will be fine. <br>  Also as a mother as attuned as yourself I doubt that you wouldn't be able to tell of things going on in your own home-yes I know I know it happens all the time. But since you have acknowledged that your already ahead of the game. Not to mention how much you care for your son, I assume you know him and what or how he would react if upset in such a manner. It will show-perhaps not understood but a child will express themselves one way or another.<br>  Hope that helps!<br>  Good Luck!|`|s73FPY8Paa	nothing wrong with looking out for you son<br>  but not everyone is out to rape a child<br>  you will know when someone is interested in you <br>  and not too interested in your son<br>  take your time<br>  but don't be scared|`|af44e91f06c457b3798336ad7be5f726aa	I know exactly what you are going through I think my relationship with my son's father was over the second the umbilical cord was cut and dealing with healing up from giving birth and a shattered heart I thought I'd never want to look at another man, besides I not only had myself to worry about I had my son. I couldn't just have men coming in and out my life,and his father rarely came around. My biggest question to myself was how can I raise a man when I hate them all.<br>  <br>  But I gave myself time to breathe and forgive. I prayed about it and God sent me the sweetest and most understanding man any woman could ever ask for and best of all he not only loves me he loves my son.<br>  <br>  My point is you are right to be scared not only for you but for your son. I'm telling you from experience things can work out. Don't rush into things. Wait a while before you let the person you are seeing meet your son and make sure it's serious. Don't leave the two alone right way and I had a rule when I started dating I never let my bf's discipline my child.<br>  <br>  I hope this has helped. Good luck and God bless!!!|`|lP31m2nqaa	It is really refreshing to know that there are parents out there who take such precautions when it comes to their children.  Granted, most individuals would be of no threat.  However, I can share your concern when it comes to your child.<br>  <br>  Having dated several women with children, one considerable error seems to come up over and over again.  The women I have dated have been far too quick to introduce their children to me.  Secondly, they were far too quick to ask me to take on some kind of authoritative role.  I have no desire to start handing out rules and discipline to other peoples children during the early stages of dating.<br>  <br>  In my mind, there is nothing worse for children than to have a "revolving door" of people coming in and out of their lives.  First, children should not come to know those individuals dating their parents until such time as it has been established that a relationship is in fact developing, and that this arrangement will continue for (hopefully) some time.  I would assume that all contact between your son and anyone you might date would be supervised by you.  In this case, there would be nothing to fear.  Eventually, trust would come into play.  You can't be everywhere at once.  But by then, you should have a better knowledge of the person you are dating.|`|AA10373401	i think you are making excuse for yourself and using ur son as a shield.  You never know when the right person will drop in.  Just try to enjoy life and you will be fine.  |`|AA10615302	I have dated a women who was 3 years older than me whom had a 3 year old son when we met.  We've dated for 5 1/2 years and I took care of her son as if he was my own.  I do not have kids of my own, but I treated him as if he was mine.  I loved and went above and beyond the extremes of my means for the both of them each and every day.  I took her son too and from daycare, kinder and first grade. I bought him lots of toys and clothes in the process.  I treated him to McDonald's many times and took both of them out to eat.<br>  <br>  In other words I opened and poured my heart out for the both of them each and every day. And as far as his mother, my girlfriend, she appreciated me so super much for being there for the both of them.  <br>  <br>  Sad news→ We both moved on and were not together anymore.  Nothing bad happened it was just a mutal split.<br>  <br>  So there are a lot of nice guys out there you just have to make sure the right one is there for you and your son and not just you and not just your son.  He has to favor the both of you.<br>  <br>  <br>  Mr. Jeff
NpgsuItraa	Some guys get jealous even when you are a friend. They just don't want to talk about other guys and do the "none of my females can have any other guy" type mentality even if they don't feel that way, its just an alpha male thing...|`|ZQ6Xef0yaa	Some guys are just really conservative and don't like it when you keep in touch with other guys even just as friends.  Or maybe he has complete trust in you and doesn't really care who you talk to.  Since he hasn't really said to stop or got mad at you for talking to other guys, I would think that it's because he just doesn't care about that.|`|AA10783185	could u give any names by any chance??? my husband is military and im hoping its not him....|`|K1RKai83aa	maybe because he probably isn't all too interested in what you do with other guys, I don't know. If he's married then he should not care or be jealous of you with other guys so maybe that's why he seems to monotone. At the same time he could be actually a little annoyed you are hanging out with other guys & he can't hang out with you/be with you if he likes you. But he's married so I think it's the first answer I said, I am just giving any possible option haha.|`|AA11705300	He hasn't reached the stage yet where he is truly a friend. A true friend is interested in you meeting people to have real relationships and eventually have a committed relationship with one.<br>    I think you realize you have an ongoing flirtation here... you say you talk about being just friends but you know that if you were really just friends, you'd be free to be friends with him and his wife together. I get the distinct feeling you are using him as a substitute for a real relationship.|`|AA10373401	guys aren't interested in talking about other guys.

1Z0Lmrk1aa	Deedia, you indeed have a problem and if you don't get some help your going to end up with STD you can't get rid of or maybe even aids. I have a high sex drive, but I am not even in your ball park honey, lol. I think you've taken the first step, you know in your heart that you have a problem, now you just have to act. I suggest you make some phone calls to therapist, see if you can find an addiction therapist that specializes in sexual addiction. Good luck honey.|`|8722a385a740fd3c165b65c08ed568ffaa	you are addicted to sex|`|NwBhaX5yaa	If you are being serious and excuse me for even implying otherwise, but it did cross my mind that you're looking for a rise out of us guys out here. :)<br>  <br>  Anyway, there is SA and SLAA and other groups for sex addicts etc. that you can go and check out. Or read about them online to start. Sounds like you may have some issues but manageable ones. Good luck.|`|AA10983590	Where's the problem?  I go through the same thing, you dont see me complaining!

Otherwise, it's quite natural. somebody may be high and somebody slow.|`|lvOafYB1aa	You are addicted, I have the cure. Let me tie you down and get rid of all your unfufilled desires.|`|7lhngIGyaa	I am the same way. I think its just a high raise in your desire for sex and some people just simply want it more than others.   If it is hindering your every day life and people are noticing then yes, its an addiction.  Otherwise I'd say more of an obsession, youre curious.  The stuff you are in to just makes you kinky and adventurous, actually.  Thats the kind of fun life is all about! :)|`|3dGZ7z83aa	i think you are full of **** and probably a loser that no ones really wants. or u wouldn't be bringing that kind of **** here, you'd be off masturbating somewhere. |`|cInuzPXQaa	Can i have your phone number?<br>  <br>  Hint: I have a huge dick.
bveDH0Rpaa	Those are the best type of relationships, the kind where you begin as best friends. My husband and I were best friends, we still are now....just a bit more complicated...in a good way. I would say if you want a "life long partner" then go ahead, but if you still want to date around dont ask her...it will most definitely ruin the friendship.|`|EPTaL9Ajaa	See if she likes someone else first. If she does, but you really still like her, then tell her.|`|AA11235749	We usually do not get what we expet. But we have to try it anyway. So you can make friend|`|JW9RSvdgaa	Ask her out to a 'fun night' but don't let her think of it as a date. As the evening goes on tell her u like her. Say something that faintly disguises it but doesn't give it away. <br>  Keep on hinting but really small. Like if u go out for dinner if she looks away shuffle closer. Just a tiny bit. If ur at the movies really enjoy yourself.  <br>  At the end of the night say u really liked spending a night with her. Wait for her response and when u think ur ready, peck her on the cheek.|`|Z2p5uincaa	you'll never know unless you try..<br>  & sorry to break it to you<br>  but i personally know people who've gone out with their best friends and they regret it later because they can't ever go back to that sort of friendship..<br>  but who knows, your friend might be different<br>  <br>  i would give it a shot though|`|cGKnbGbMaa	No it isn't worth it.  You can find hundreds or thousands of girls to date, but you can't find many girls to be your friend. once you cross the line you can't go back and you ruin one of the best things in your life.
iuSrMdwmaa	There is nothing in the law that requires a ring to be given and received as part of the marriage ceremony.<br>  <br>  I've married couples who haven't exchanged rings in their ceremony because they were going on a holiday overseas so were planning on buying them duty free.<br>  <br>  I've married couples who didn't exchange rings because they were waiting for a planned renewal of vows when all their family could get together.<br>  <br>  I've married elderly people with arthritic knuckles who couldn't have worn a ring however much they might have liked to.<br>  <br>  Occasionally I have a couple who chooses other forms of jewellery - necklace, bracelet etc.<br>  <br>  I always tell my couples at the first meeting that they don't have to exchange rings - they can exchange power-tools if they like. Somehow that always makes the guys eyes light up!|`|F3LBgfvwaa	Yeah, you can. It's not a big deal. When I got married I had no money so I had to wait to get a ring lol.|`|26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	Yes. People got married for millenia without having a ring. Even during WW2 they were rare because people couldn't afford frivolities like that at the time. |`|AA11235749	Sure. Changing ring is only the cultural thing. The culture itself is changing. So you can go ahead without ring.|`|crPZVBexaa	Why not? It doesn't change the meaning, but no one would know you are married.|`|I8M5kw5Saa	of course and in some religions its not warn at all.Not me though as I got me the biggest diamond  I could find.|`|1KfbgBupaa	I did.|`|HX5VPVDmaa	yeah you can can but the ring is so much fun. I would lay in bed at night and play with it with im thumb and stare at it some times. It wasn't fancy it was very simple but it was mine and the man I loved put it their so it made it great.|`|pE3agx4jaa	of course. for me, it's not in the ring, nor in a big time marriage celebration - marriage is a lifetime commitment and can be done even without those material things. :)|`|LU3TfwmYaa	 yes of course you can!... i have heard some religions dont alow it....so yes of course you can|`|958373ab2988960e44e21c2951d28f46aa	Yes  In fact there are some beliefs out there that do not allow jewelry.  |`|988d05b411b86680c69063473c6a29b1aa	Sure you can.|`|e2v1H1ATaa	yes you sure can
VjsemxVwaa	First of all, you should learn how to spell and go easy on the poor keyboard. Second, calm down and just give him the silent treatment. Eventually, he'll break down and you guys will have a talk.|`|AA10373401	were you expecting him to say something.  He's your dad, he doesnt have to say anything. If you want a relationship with him, someone has to take the lead.  sometime it may be you that has to do that.

Hope that helps.|`|mXQpRIMYaa	First you must start by trying to know the reason that he was gone. then you must evaluate how bad you really want him in your life. Then I think you should forgive him, since it could have been better he was gone. Depending on what he was doing while he was gone. Let him know how you feel about him being gone.

AA10373401	this is the "it's not you, it's me" kinda situation.  There's no need for you to call her.  Just let her be and move on.  If you are too nice, it's your nature, don't change it.  she probably has not experienced that in her life before and it's awkward to her.  I have met plenty of women like that in my life. they have had such bad experiences that it has become the norm to them, so being with someone good is an unfamiliar territory to them.  BTW, this is just based on what you just said.  If there's more that you didn't say, then you might want to repost your question with all details.  good luck.|`|DS33Wl4waa	I'm not a girl but I feel your pain. The woman I'm dating I haven't heard from in 2 days, no answer to my texts, emails or phone calls. We even had plans for the weekend. We had just went on a romantic walk a couple nights ago. <br>  <br>  There's not much you can do if you can't reach her, just hope she comes around. |`|e5k8Bsxpaa	The only thing you can do is wait for her to call you. You did nothing wrong. |`|n2O0NwR6aa	I had a similar experience with a guy.  He was really hot - super smart - extremely romantic - and every girl in our school was after him.  But he liked me, so we went out a few times.  He was soooo nice!  He opened doors for me, brought me flowers, wrote poems for me, and took me on romantic picnics.  Every girl's dream, right?  But try as I might, I just couldn't get into him... he was just TOO nice!!  Isn't that the craziest thing you've ever heard?    <br>  <br>  I don't know why it is, but some girls are turned off when a guy is too nice.  Maybe it's because there's no "challenge" to the relationship, nothing to keep us wondering, "does he really like me or not?"  Or maybe it's because when a guy puts us up on a pedestal, it makes us feel like the superior one in the relationship - which subconsciously makes the guy seem inferior.  It's pretty stupid, really - I mean, what girl doesn't want to be treated like a princess?  But that's how it is, with some girls, at least. When we get what we think we want, we suddenly find we don't want it after all.<br>  <br>  I'm not saying that you should start acting like a jerk.  Don't change!  You sound like a great guy, and eventually you're going to find some really lucky girl who will appreciate what an awesome boyfriend you are!  In the meantime, if you date a girl who doesn't seem interested, don't take it personally.  She's probably just one of those girls who's attracted to more of the bad-boy type.  It's nothing you're doing wrong.<br>  |`|tmr7xQXlaa	omg!  as hard as this may be, you might just have to forget about her.  you didnt do anything wrong, and her sister trying to guilt trip you is total BS.  you sound like a great guy, and my bet is you can find someone way better whos going to treat you right and not turn off their phone to avoid you like theyre 8 years old.  |`|RGXB8ayPaa	DO YOU WANNA KNOW WHAT!actually that girl is trying to cheat you and try to discuss with her i think she's a stupid girl stop going out with her if u wanna safe.She's a kind of that trying to cheat you discuss this with her HORRIBLE sister!|`|gFiRi5xnaa	She was probably planning on cheating on you, or stealing your money. Either that or she's just crazy. A normal girl would kill to have a sweet, romantic guy like you. I'd give up on that crazy lost cause if I were you.|`|JDogbPg6aa	She might have just felt like she was leading you on. Just give her some time and hopefully you can become friends again because she seems like a drama kind of person. |`|AA11356977	She has a boyfriend or maybe she just want into you. Either way. Dont call her for a week , then try one more time then let it go.|`|F8CSNTQdaa	Lose her. Why play games?|`|NIn62JuPaa	Any mature and rational girl would not have drama queened out the way she did. Be happy that she left now before she really had your heart wrapped up and to only hurt you worse later. She is obviously unstable and confused by a good guy like you, do not think what you did was wrong because some normal girl will come along that will return your gestures and then you both can be happy. do not let yourself get caught up in trying to help someone like her save it for the professionals.|`|bMJyxilqaa	She's insecure about herself. She realizes what a great guy you are, and something is hurting her deep down. DON'T GIVE UP! You can't let her keep thinking that way, because I'm sure she's a great girl. :) Keep calling. And figure out a way to meet up with her. Bring her flowers, tell her your really into her and want to get to know her. She'll probably resist, but I'm sure she's wortht the chase. <br>  I'm sure you didn't do anything, and she is just feeling bad because something in her past as her thinking she's not good enough. She wants you, but doesn't want to hurt you because she sees how nice you are to her. It's complicated, yes, but worth your time to get her back. <br>  <br>  As for her sister, im sure she doesn't know the story and she's just getting into her protective mode. |`|Q4HFgE6faa	she either is <br>  a) really into you and you're such a nice guy but she's the kinda girl who can't commit or something like that and somehow can't see both of you together<br>  <br>   or<br>  <br>  b) she's nuts<br>  <br>  you're a nice guy. try calling her again, send her flowers. do something. and at the end of it, you find she's not worth the trouble, move on<br>  <br>  |`|6u87NDMsaa	she probably didnt like you sorry... shes got issues though... thats pretty crazy... first of all whats wrong with being nice... she probably likes men that treat her badly... thats very bad... i seriously dont think its you at all.. shes just crazy|`|mZhXENfwaa	You did NOTHING wrong!<br>  <br>  She either is drama filled or just feels very badly about herself.|`|CitzTXTMaa	Maybe she feels guilty about something. Do you know what she was like when she was with other people? Are you sure you have not left out an important detail?|`|1Midr0avaa	keep trying you still ahve a chnace for think you did nothing wrong. persistance wins the day....good luck.|`|k22ne1oUaa	you did nothing wrong. she was probably just going through somethings.|`|LnM9NVWdaa	Dude, calm down. If she just suddenly out of the blue left you alone with no further reason--well, of course there's a reason! First, think, did she seem all picky and frustrated in the beginning of the date. If she did, then that must of been a sign that something was bugging her. First, text her and ask her if you had done anything wrong. No, I know you didn't do anything wrong. Just-you have to text her and keep texting her and say sorry for whatever you have done wrong. Have you two ever broken up? Been mad at each other? Think of that. And then ask her, but on IM, and if she doesn't respond, then quit. She doesn't care about you! She doesn't deserve a space in your heart, who wants to hang out wiht a freak like her? |`|QpS0ytEuaa	Maybe because you are such a nice guy this scarred her or shocked her and she felt overwhelmed.<br>  Maybe something happened during ya'lls kissing<br>  <br>  I would give her space and let her come back to you if its meant to be. Dont keep calling her because that might make it worse.<br>  If this just happend a few hours ago you still have a fighting chance. I personally think what you did was very sweet.<br>  Give it some time buddy and be patient.<br>  If she does not reply to you then you deserve someone that appreciates your niceness.|`|UZLziZi8aa	I'm sorry that happened to you, that's like movie drama. She said that you were too nice and that she didn't wanna hurt you, what if she has some issues that cause her to pull away and sabotage a relationship when its going well (I do that, not to that extent, but I freak when things are going well with a guy so I pull away to avoid getting closer to him, thus I avoid any chances of getting hurt) If she cried like her sister said, then she likes you but is too scared to keep things going with you. Another possibility could be that maybe she didn't want to date you anymore and didn't know how to do it, so she made a scene and had her sister answer the phone to avoid talking to you (her sister saying that you made her cry could be just a mean way to mess with you, I don't really know). Whatever the case, you've done all you can by calling, but your gonna have to wait until she gets a hold of you. Trust me if she's interested in you she'll come back and if not well then she didn't want anything. Be careful in how you handle yourself with this girl because if she's sabotaging a good thing (like I do), then becoming serious with someone like that is setting yourself up for getting hurt badly. I'm really sorry that something crazy like that happened to you, be careful in trusting your feelings with someone like that.|`|qmdzCTgcaa	Sounds like you did nothing wrong. You sound like a nice guy and I don't know why she did that but i feel bad for you and I'm sorry. If her phone is off leave a really sweet message just saying you are sorry and you're not sure what u did but u really like her. Tell her if it can't work out like that you still want to be friends. Good luck! I hope it turns out good for you. :)|`|OIJ3JBkSaa	i don't know what you did, if your story is the plain and simple truth then you didn't do a darn thing wrong and she just got scared?  or?<br>  i'm sorry it didn't work out but don't give up on us!  there are lots of nice girls out there who won't play games, keep trying sweetie.  let this one go, don't try to contact her, shes made it clear that she isn't interested so chalk this one up to a life experience!  <br>  good luck!|`|BRg8RNPjaa	OK?<br>  <br>  She's a psycho path, dump her and she'll come running back to you. <br>  <br>

This is funny...<br>  <br>  Well, are you under age?  If you're under the legal age for being able to "do the deed" and these guys are over the age, then they can be hit with some pretty tough legal stuff if it gets out.  If you are over age...then it's probably circulating on the web as I type that.  With this said....just know that you've been imortalized for the rest of your life, and even some of your children's whenever you have them.  Soo...don't go off being a politician or anything, just stick with Burger King or Wendys and you should be alright, once you're in a position of power though...it's all over...<br>  <br>  OH, and as long as they have this and the longer you wait to confront them, the more copies are going to go out, eventually your dad may see them just "browsing" across the internet...and who knows that that will bring to the fire.

I have no idea what makes these people think he's being racist towards you... I dont think so, based on your description.

His race obviously is not an issue and it shouldnt be.<br>  <br>  Dave S: You cant tell her who to be with and dont forget she already has a boyfriend. You obviously have an issue with black people.

He may have attachment issues and if he is already getting clingy and overly protective you may want to get out now..  it will only get worse and can turn into either physical or emotional abuse...   but if you really like the guy just let him know he is coming on a bit strong, that may upset him though..  tough one you got there.|`|7KCNxW5Naa	A good relationship is based on honesty and communication. If you can't tell him he's being too pushy, or moving too fast, then the relationship won't work anyway. <br>      Go for it. tell him how you feel.

"Over-protective" usually leads to abusive jackass...|`|AA10373401	let him know that ur not a person who deal well with clingyness so he should cut the "i love u" crap out.

T8xwCB9Raa	I think you did absolutely the right thing. Your mom is an adult, and so is everyone else involved. She will get over it, but she would have felt so betrayed if she had found out down the road. <br>  Why don't you ask your mom up for a visit next? Maybe it will make her feel better.<br>  You need to be able to see your dad without guilt, so just push it out of your mind. It isn't fair to you!|`|n2O0NwR6aa	I think you did the right thing.  Like you said, if she found out after the fact (which she certainly would), she would've felt betrayed that you didn't tell her beforehand.  She might've felt like you and your dad had plotted together to keep this from her.  And that would make her feel even worse.<br>  <br>  It's not your fault that she's upset  - and it's not like you intentionally tried to upset her.  She would be upset no matter who told her.  Better to hear it from you, and just deal with her feelings about the new girlfriend, than to hear it from someone else, and add on the feeling that you're keeping things from her.|`|wpi36XBAaa	You are right, Honesty is the best policy. While your mother may be upset now, I'd think she'd be more upset if you felt you had to lie, or hide this from her. |`|JzY8x9Umaa	I think you did the right thing, if she would of found out later then like you said she would of felt betrayed. Butttttt, they need to be mature adults, it isn't your job to deal with their jealousy and resentment and maybe you need to tell them that. You shouldn't have to deal with the drama. Both parents deserve to move on and have a new person in their life if they choose to. Good Luck.|`|ghz5D5iLaa	I would have told her too. She would have been mad if she found out after you did not tell her. |`|AA10373401	you should have listened to your husband.|`|wpkJFL5Qaa	u did the right thing|`|O20PKkLOaa	Your mother cannot get jealous or upset.  You have a right to see your father and he has a right to have a new girlfriend. She is jealous and upset when you told her before they were coming.. she was going to end up upset either way.  Better off warning her first.  She should be happy you are seeing your father .. since its been awhile.  Some people in this world never get to see their father.  I think you done right.  <br>  |`|lDsvWCm2aa	I agree with you.  As awkward as the situation is now, it would be a whole lot worse if she found out after the visit and discovered you kept it from her.  It isn't your fault that this situation has arose and you definately should not need to lie.  I congratulate you on your honesty and I hope all works out well.|`|rzhLEoCmaa	I feel you did the right thing, but if your husband told you before the fact that you shouldn't tell your mother and yet you went on and did it anyways, then that's a problem.|`|Q1YJDUP3aa	Those are your parents. If you feel it would be beneficial for her, you did th right thing. Like you said, it's better for her to know instead of finding out later and feel betrayed. |`|u87sMdDoaa	Maybe you shouldnt have told her right away.Maybe you should of waited a while longer.But she would of found out sooner or later.So there really is no right or wrong thing done.Dont worry about it too much Honey.It will all be OKAY!|`|NqhQBBaYaa	Making people feel bad for telling the truth should be a crime.|`|2762ccba83512fa723ba5e46f6bed344aa	I think your mom has some security issues.... Talk with her about it..|`|7H6DtT94aa	It was probably better to tell her sooner than later, because she'll know that you still care about and her feelings. I think you did the right thing.|`|II7rFGvFaa	u did the right thing, either way she is going to get upset but atleast you didn't lose her trust!
rRub6s2Laa	sex is a gud way of letting out frustration..lolzzzz|`|kSQufl2taa	I would say it's neither.  I believe it is a natural stage of post-puberty.  As an older teenager, you are in your sexual prime.  Around the age of 18, men's body's produce the highest levels of testosterone that it will for their entire life.  It is natural for the body to be geared towards sex at this age.  While the finger is commonly pointed at TV, Movies, or video games, I honestly believe it's more of just a natural curiosity and stage in one's life.  |`|BpIgmTxvaa	Because of puberty. Along with the adolescent years comes curiosity of the opposite sex. My question to you is: Is it possible sex was on the mind of teenagers before tv and movies we're invented? What statistics are you reading and what teenagers are volunteering their opinion. |`|8e9e2bd12ac1963ded67edc5aa19b3d4aa	For guys it's the rush of testosterone, for girls it's the peer pressure-at a young age anyway|`|f5VSMPg9aa	One word: hormones<br>  <br>  Teenagers are going through a lot of changes and the chemicals in their bodies make them think a little differently than adults.|`|f6j94xH1aa	Being a teenager, I would say that it is because of puberty more than anything.|`|wlHQ1Z6oaa	It's because of those two balls that are producing all that naughty hormones!|`|I2PCl06Uaa	yes to some extent but the most contribution to this is present living style of society|`|tqY4rwkxaa	simple explaination, because there was many such thg sources out there, and teenagers like to pratice wat adult do.|`|tDTC2P2waa	Hormone levels in adolescents are much higher. |`|qXBdGhqRaa	its hormones, silly|`|H9ID5d2gaa	Because of de breasts and aids <br>  <br>  its always aids|`|FChsjNwuaa	any person who thinks that it is due to tv or movies should be shot. it is merely human nature. |`|e0l9qWV9aa	puberty, ever heard of it?|`|sZ1sxdMCaa	It's just a phase that every teen goes through.|`|n2O0NwR6aa	Sex has always been on the minds of teenagers.  That's how nature designed us... it gave us a desire to have sex and reproduce, as soon as our bodies are sexually mature.  Back in the caveman days, that made good sense.  People didn't live very long, so it made sense to start having sex and making babies as soon as possible, while you were still around to do it.  Nowadays, of course, people live a lot longer.  There's no big rush to reproduce.  But our bodies haven't caught up with the times.  There's still that inner voice saying, "Okay, you're body's ready now, so go for it!"  <br>  <br>  People who want to wait until they're older, or married, or whatever, have to block that voice out.  And that can be difficult, because it's a pretty convincing voice.  It used to be easier, though.  Losing your virginity before marriage, or becoming an unwed mother, would get you scorned by society.  The fear of becoming a social outcast was enough to make most teenage girls avoid the urge to have sex - or at least be very careful.  <br>  <br>  Today, teens don't have that fear to help them block out that inner voice.  Teen sex seems more acceptable.  They see it on TV and in the movies... they go to school with pregnant classmates.  Society has become more forgiving and accepting, so it's no big deal anymore.  There's not much to help teens avoid that inner voice that nature gave us.|`|3T1vYz5Maa	hormones, the media, and sex ed makes us to curious!|`|AA10373401	hormonal changes.  that is why parents are suppose to help them through it.

ITS EVERYWHERE!|`|uymc9tscaa	hormones..it really is that simple..plus all the external stimuli..like tv internet..people sweating in gym class..bathing suits..you get the picture|`|dmci2TKBaa	It's just that silly desire to reproduce and continue the human race.|`|JtQvOLqkaa	Hormones more than either of those influences|`|3lorTxrLaa	its so we reproduce tvs got nothing to do with it. no matter what you teach or dont teach your teenagers they will sneak out, meet, and most likely have sex.....|`|lAJ9EVhiaa	It's due to nature.
W4DIM1KTaa	Light brown hair, blue/green eyes, fair to medium skin tone, shorter than me, no tattoos, ears pierced, younger, thin (but not too skinny), relatively plump lips, a little bit of makeup, especially a little eyeliner|`|XOgsoOyOaa	Well I have a preference for brunettes over blondes, even though  most guys like a blonde. I like someone with blue, green, or a mixture of both eye colors. I would choose a more toned skin color, that way she doesn't quite look so pale. If a girl has toned skin I might assume she gets out and does things or she might just go the local tanning salon. I don't really care to go out with anybody with too many tattoos, 1 or 2 is fine by me. I would try to go out with someone within a few years of my age because there would be a greater chance, we have something in common. Also a girl who is somewhat athletic so an average body weight is okay. I don't really have a preference on lip size, but I hope they aren't too big though. makeup can usually get you noticed by the guys out there, but that is all up to you. Hope that helps.|`|bkBTZr7gaa	I think that this will vary from guy to guy, my personal preferences are:<br>  Hair: any but red<br>  eyes: any<br>  tall or short: any<br>  tattoos: no tattoos of any kind.<br>  piercings: normal <br>  age: not more or less than 5 years difference<br>  size: average, not to skinny<br>  lips: regular lips.<br>  make up: normal.     "nothing extreme" <br>  <br>  basically in the end what it really does matter is your personality, of course the appearance plays a very important place too, but it does not matter if you are the girl of my dreams if you are a b_____!! i would leave her in a heart beat. |`|x9NJX9CDaa	Brown<br>  Eyes can go any way but if i had to choose Blue<br>  Light Skin, borderline pale<br>  Shorter, but this isn't critical<br>  no tatoos, but its up to her in the end.

woOeYFrEaa	Getting married will not effect your current pay and benefits.  After you're married you could give your workplace your marriage certificate and get your husband added to your benefits and that would increase the cost but you don't have to do that if you don't want to.  Vice versa, he could get you added to his benefits once you're married.<br>  <br>  The first step in changing your name is going to the social security office with your marriage certificate and getting a new social security card.  Once you've done that, you can legally change your name everywhere else....work, driver's license, etc.  Most places will ask to see your social secuirty card or your marriage license for proof to change your name.  But with such little time between your wedding and your maternity leave, I wouldn't bother trying to change your name yet.  There's no deadline for getting that done.<br>  <br>  Best of luck to you!|`|AA11450203	Benefits will not change because of the marital status.  Furthermore, the Federal Medical Leave Act allows for both maternity and paternity leave regardless if the parents are married or not.  The same goes for adopted children.
1Y0yPiSvaa	She seems like she might be traumatized from some past experience. In my unprofessional opinion, she needs professional help. If in 11 years she has not been able to develop trust in you than I really do not think you can do anything about it. She should really speak with a therapist to try and see what is bothering her.|`|8rbQBaIeaa	Love comes in all color and sizes. If you are happy because you love her and don't want to leave her, then you may have to just roll your eyes and continue on. Otherwise, this is who she is and you will have to live with it. My brother in law got divorced because she couldn't stand him being so clingy. He learned his lesson and is much happier with his new wife. He learned to let go and to trust. Your wife is having a trust issue. If you have done nothing, then it has something to do with her past that she cannot get over. You can try talking to her, but I would almost bet that she won't give you a straight answer to why her behavior is as of such|`|beiztH7iaa	Your wife sounds very unwell. A little jealousy is fairly normal, but hers is way over the top; it's sad really, she seems to have no self-esteem whatsoever, and she's clearly very insecure. I think you are amazing to have put up with it as long as you have done! She really needs psychological counselling to help her understand why she reacts the way she does, what feelings are underlying that behaviour, and how to change it. This is outside your ability to deal with ... she does need professional help. Yes, you can support her, but the help she needs is beyond what you can offer. Be gentle, get her some professional help without expressing judgement, and try to keep reassuring her ... you do still need to point out that her behaviour is irrational though, be careful of validating it.|`|Mdh8xbl3aa	If you are 40 and been married 11 years and you now find yourself unhappy due to her stupidity,  then ask yourself why waste another day when you can easily get away from what is obviously making you miserable.  And if these things happen everyday I know that love makes you do some funny things but to be unhappy in love is not a good option|`|H7hHCHRkaa	She has absolutely no self esteem whatsoever maybe you could start commenting on how she look and when she does something you like tell her cooking food you like etc. compliment her a lot not to much in the beginning she might suspect something. Try to be honest in your comments though, this will help I am sure.|`|A3UaBkzRaa	Are you Dean Cain or some equally sexy celeb lookalike? Seriously, maybe she has issues from the past, or maybe she is looking at other guys and assumes you are doing the same. Maybe this should be worked out on the comfy couch of a therapist's office.|`|P8OTvhU9aa	she needs a good fix. a really good fix.|`|AA11412999	Sound like this goes beyond "normal" jealousy and is leaning towards crazy.  I know that jealousy can have a serious stranglehold on a person because I've been there.  It's a very negative emotion and I no longer believe that it is "normal" or in any way desirable to have in a relationship.  <br>  <br>  Experience has shown me that it really has very little to do with you, and everything to do with the fact that she does not feel very good about herself.  If she truly believed she was a woman worth being in a relationship with, there would be nothing for jealousy to cling to.  She fears these other women - and the attention they steal that she is supposed to be getting from you.  And why?  Because she just can't bring herself to believe that she is worth staying with.  Therefore she must always be on the defensive, instead of just believing you and laughing at any woman who is stupid enough to try to steal you away.<br>  <br>  If you truly want to get rid of her jealousy, you'll need to reassure her of what she means to you.  You need to find ways to show her you are proud that she's your woman!  Find ways, without making a big production of it, to prove to her that you choose her over other women and that she is unique and irreplaceable, and that her place in your heart is secure.<br>  <br>  Good luck! |`|pVGSvmwfaa	It is most likely that your wife is cheating on you, or thinking about it.<br>  Her thoughts are being justified by over compensating the guilt back to you. Keep it quiet and check her out. You might be surprised to find that she is keeping track of your every move so she can pull a few moves of her own when you are not around!<br>  Talking down to your relatives can mean two things. <br>  She feels she needs to defend herself. OR she has a very low self esteem.|`|SYJWWas5aa	It's weird that you don't take your wife with you when you go to visit relatives.  She's your wife, so by marriage they are her relatives too.<br>  <br>  Maybe thats why she thinks your cheating, because you don't invite her along?|`|Ux0co0Dsaa	counseling?  this sounds very extreme...have you fed into this at all?  did you have a wandering eye at one time?  honestly- it doesn't matter, she sounds terribly insecure.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|cyUuLhbRaa	Tell her how you feel.  She is crazy jealous and needs help.
1kj0uXUpaa	Don't string him along.  Tell him honestly that you don't know what you want, and maybe you and he could talk with a third party (perhaps a counselor) about what you both want out of the relationship and how your different goals can be reconciled.|`|Nbr5mEnpaa	I have been in this same boat before and it was hard to break his heart.  In my situation he survived the breakup and is happily married now.  You need to be honest with him about your feelings and maybe he will back off a little, that is if you still want to salvage the relationship.  If he don't understand your feelings then its best to move on.  You cant expect to make him happy, because doing it is making you unhappy and if you marry him your marriage will not be good.  He has to learn to make himself happy, then he will find what he is looking for..does that makes sense to you?  Life is too short to be unhappy, you will be doing him a favor in the end.  |`|AA12063478	I think that you should tell him that your not ready to settle down. And if you are not feeling him, I think that you should have left with him a long time ago. Four years is a long time to be with someone and if you continue to be with him all your doing is giving him false hope.<br>  <br>  So think about it and make the right choice for yourself.|`|AA11450203	A relationship with partners wanting different things and wanting different directions is a disaster waiting to happen.  You need to be assertively honest with your boyfriend and tell him how you feel.  Failing to do so will force the two of you to continue living the lie.  If the two of you end the relationship it will be hard at first but if done properly will be less painful than letting the stresses erode the relationship down to nothing.|`|mbfFiCyXaa	Sounds like you need some time apart to reassess your feelings, imagine being stuck with someone that you have grown apart from.|`|HwQG65Dlaa	I've been with my fiance for four years, also. After a while, things start to not be as... Well, exciting anymore. It's not going to be like when you were fifteen, y'know, with the butterflies and stuff. Things start to even out and real life kicks in, and that's the time you're closest.<br>  <br>  When I used to get the "not so exciting anymore" feeling, it made me ill, too. And that just proved to me that I DID love him and that it wasn't because anything was fading or I was losing my connection with him.<br>  <br>  Are there certain things that happen prior to those feelings? Could there be external triggers?<br>  <br>  Be sure to tell him about this, though. If he wants to settle down and your heart's not truly in it, it's not fair for him.|`|meQvjtLWaa	well i would do whatever seems right. because it's not fair to him to love you and not be loved back. and its not fair to you to be in a relationship that you don't wanna be in. don't lie to yourself but most importantly, don't lie to him. because staying in the relationship and not wanting to be in it is basically lying to yourself and him.|`|8HsPdPPqaa	Somebody told me in the past that I should be with the person who loves me more than I love her. If he really loves you so much then go and talk to him, tell him about your feelings & take a little break from your relationship & then when you are alone, you'd realize what is the right thing for you to do.|`|n3CGPXSFaa	if you cant tell him the truth then hes not the right guy you need a guy who you feel comfortable with and can tel them anything that on your mind

AA11412999	In the absence of the ability to read minds people have come to rely upon their ability to recognize patterns.  And because we all need to feel safe, our best bet in this unpredictable world is to develop simple rules.  Sadly, there is correlation between unmarried/uncommitted couples or single men, and dramatic, un-fun situations that we all want to avoid.  It paints with a broad brush, it's true, and is hardly fair to legitimate singles or unmarried couples who are not prone to "drama".  But we really can't apologize for it because our time is very valuable.  When you travel 3 1/2 hours to meet a couple or a single guy and he turns out to be more pig than human, or they turn out to be "married but not to each other", or they're married but are trying to "fix" their relationship...etc, etc...well, it's taught us that it's always best to have a Plan B.  Swinging is great...as long as you can find playmates that you click with.  It's actually extremely difficult!  When you spend literally years looking for decent single guys who won't treat you like a whore, single women who aren't unattractive and/or crazy, and unmarried couples who just don't "get it", you can either lower your standards (not happening) or just cut the entire category altogether.  You just eventually get tired of the BS, y'know?|`|bO2rzfISaa	Because single guys will stop at nothing to get laid, as you are proving. They don't want you pursuing their wives after the fact. It really could get ugly if you are found out. At a minimum you will be ostracized.|`|6EoAKcMwaa	Security reasons. They don't want any jealousy going on, and most married couples who engage in this lifestyle do not have any problems with jealousy. <br>  <br>  They just don't want a fight to break out when everyone should be having a good time. As long as you and your friend have clear rules and boundaries, I don't see a problem, try to communicate that to your potential partners that you two play together, or not at all. Some married couples have probably dealt with one of the other couple being coerced, and that is a major party foul. Make it clear you both consent, and it should be fine<br>  <br>  BTW: I have never been, but I write erotica so I research this often, women are encouraged alone at swing clubs, not men, again because of the possibility of jealousy. |`|inFfJk20aa	security reasons mostly.  i have overcome those concerns a couple times to actually meet single guys.  in fact i did end up seeing one guy for over a year.  so it does happen but you have to figure the numbers are not in a singe guys favor.|`|ImiMtrcqaa	Boundaries and comfort level.  If those couples find out that you are not married, it will go through that community like Sherman went through Atlanta.   With the same results for you and your friend. In other words, you will be burned.  No one likes liars.|`|abyHvk07aa	Because they tend to be more honest, more mature and have more of the same interests. Which btw your lying, deceptive, do anything to get sex idea of playing married just proved. A true sign of maturity is respecting people's right to make their own decisions about who they want to be with. (It's a close knit family in there. When they find out you're lying it will get passes around quickly.) They also know what discrete means and don't need to fill their sails by talking about their conquests with other people. <br>  Young unmarried couples tend to be jealous and bring drama. They also have no legal commitment and break up frequently especially when they are involved in the lifestyle at such a young age. Also as to why most couples want couples or single women...most women are bi, which is fine with their men. They enjoy it also. Most guys are not. A single man does nothing for them.|`|pzTkEmKkaa	WOW, excellent answers! Two couples make an even playing field and makes the perfect mix for swapping. If all involved are comfortable in sharing their spouse then all are getting as well as giving.<br>  <br>  SHAME ON YOU for being dishonest!!!!<br>  <br>  Ginni
IA1h4V9gaa	Sounds like last Saturday night to me.  Here I was all wound up and the guy was just pfffft.  Not very exciting at all.  It's the downside of having a total stud as a swinger husband - most others are not very exciting by comparison.<br>  I personally derive a lot of pleasure from my husband's pleasure, so I loved seeing him just going to town on the girl.  It was pretty obvious that he was now her #1.  Hehe.   I got the good stuff from my husband later on anyway.   <br>  <br>  To my surprise, my husband told me that this girl was actually kinda dull and although very attractive, he didn't have the time he was hoping for either.  <br>  <br>  Essentially, you take the good with the bad in this game.  Like fishing.  Most you'll toss back, but once in a while you'll snag a real keeper.  But the fishing is still fun, even if you don't bring any home.<br>  <br>  EDIT avengelyne: jealousy has no place in what swingers do.  It can't it'll ruin everything.<br>  <br>  EDIT Man in Black - if I read the question correctly, I think that she was happy with the guy until they got naked.  That's usually the case with me - I think the guy is hot and I wanna do him, but what he does is just not so great.|`|K3ZYWBr4aa	Doesnt it bother you to watch your hubby enjoying another woman like that and lusting after her? That would make me so jealous. I admit however i do fantasize about my husband doing other women but if he evern actually did it would break my heart. Anyways simply just dont sleep with the couple unless the man meets your requirements!|`|c425bd77add075a97bdceeb9591a73bbaa	You really ought to try an on-premise club.  <br>  <br>  We've found that's the best way to meet couples, and you're not "stuck" with one couple if nothing is happening for you.|`|AA11412999	I think - and this is JMO here - it's normal to be really into your own partner and somewhat disappointed with other partners.  It makes sense, though, if you think about it.  It's true that sex keeps getting better the longer you're together, right?  That's because you know one another literally inside out.  The excitement doesn't fizzle because while you want nothing more than to get closer to your spouse, than to get inside his head and really merge with him, you can't.  Because he is a separate person, and therefore you will never know all there is to know about him.  That is the constant fascination we have with one another.  Sex is how we communicate this.<br>  <br>  With strangers, while the initial spark may be there and there is chemistry, the fact remains: we don't know them.  And furthermore, we have no need to know them and no interest.  Without the deep emotional bond - the "home" that we find in our spouse's arms - it really is a much more superficial experience.  If you are unprepared for that superficiality, if you can't find ways to wrap your head around it in a healthy way, it could cause problems.  <br>  <br>  We enjoyed swinging because it allowed us to be exactly who we were without the games, and because it allowed us a privileged glimpse into the real lives of those around us.  You gain a new awareness and respect for others who cross your path in your day to day life, because it teaches you that, even though you don't see it, every single person on this planet has a rich inner life and a story to tell.  Swinging just gives us a brief glimpse of it.|`|d1ee48df00eb4b8567acf7a43aeb1c1aaa	We're not swingers, but my girlfriend and my experience with many social circles is that a lot of women work hard to be sexy... while almost all the guys are kinda blah, pudgy, dorky or worse.  It's like they don't make an effort (often, effort would mean "gym".) |`|Cp2GGtDLaa	Swingers do it because they want more excitement and expect rockets to go off. When they don't go off they're disappointed. Look at it this way, when you go to the casino you do not win/lose every time. Live with it.|`|hCAQ6aWWaa	Its always the way!|`|pzTkEmKkaa	I have learned that sometimes it isn't the other person that does nothing for me but more that my mind simply isn't in it at the time. It can be very difficult to get 4 people in the mood at the same time.<br>  <br>  Be sure that you are able to relax and let yourself go, that you aren't paying too much attention to your hubby and what he is doing, this can make it difficult for you as well as your partner.<br>  <br>  I had the same problem and was placing the blame on the other males until I realized it was really me and learned to relax more.<br>  <br>  Ginni|`|inFfJk20aa	with us its usually been the opposite way around.  if i didnt like someone i'll still talk and be nice (but not do anything) where he has a hard time doing that.  plus hubby's always too concerned with making sure i'm ok and that detracts from his just letting go. <br>  <br>  edit:  anyone ever just go out on dates alone?  i have and that is great also.  even husband feels its easier sometimes.|`|791b0e42bf3b803e6a037bdda6b43d2daa	What iw ould do is go out and get a swinger couple that the guy is banin hot like sizzle and his wife is a only a average women,, try to make your husband jealous, see what he says to you,,,,,, and i have to give u props, i wouldnt be able to do what you do,, that other woman would be DEAD.|`|4B93B5H9aa	When we were swinging we generally had small parties of 4 or more couples at our home so that their were more options.  If there are only two couples there is just a one in sixteen chance that all four of you are going to click with one another.  You increase the odds if there are more options.  Even with more options, someone may not find someone to play with on any given night.  Start hosting parties and the more people you invite them more likely that you will find a playmate for the evening.

ch6g2UzMaa	Not for me; that just makes it interesting. |`|fTxwKBNBaa	Nope. It is great.  Great to kiss someone who has not kissed anyone before you, said my boyfriend when we started dating at the age of 16.  We are still together, and happy.  And he knows my magical first kiss moment was with him and proud of it, so I can say it is more of a turn on than a turn off.|`|AA10373401	my first kiss was as forgetable as the last one. Now i can tall you my first bill that i had to pay myself all the way to the last bill. |`|WVqCKx3Zaa	There is nothing wrong that you haven't had any kisses before, you're only 15 and hold on to it not to go further with anyone yet, wait until you turn 18 at least.  I mean to have a kiss is fine, but the problem is once you've a kiss with him and he might wanted to go further to have sex with you and you're still a minor, this will be turned against the law to have sex with a minor.    |`|z6DCHxtAaa	When i was 17 i dated a 16 year old name krystle, and she had never kissed a guy before, and i really liked to know that i was going to get to be the first. You never forget that first one, so i was happy that i got to be the guy she remembers for her whole life.|`|UVciAbXxaa	no it just makes the kiss better i guess. idk now days all the gurls i kiss are between 18-22 an they all have had there first kiss so idk..|`|adc4d3088db3b71b6bfc9aa4f53c6483aa	I dont see why it would be a turnoff.  If its a turnoff for a guy then he is stupid.  I thinks its special because that means that you have been saving a very special moment for yourself and the lucky fell you share it with for a long time.  I think its sort of a turnon!|`|2i2Y5Fyaaa	i dont think its a problem, i havent had my first kiss yet, im waiting for the perfect girl who i will actually love until i get a kiss, so i dont think it is a problem.|`|d5d4f7e20b92171ade59d412b4a271b5aa	this guy mustn't like you veery much or he would have said oh it doesnt matter etc or if he's cheeky he'd av said something like yeah well we can do something about that<br>  
RJumIHAOaa	He obviously must think that you're really cute when you're jealous or something, which is why he keeps doing this. What you were saying about him usually only whistling at girls when you're in a group, he probably is trying to look cool in front of his mates or doesn't want to look like he likes you in front of his friends.<br>  If I were you, I would just ignore the whole "making you jealous" facade he's on, and then later on, IF your relationship progresses then you could point it out.<br>  It's probably just his way of seeing if you like him though.<br>  Really cute :)<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|AA10373401	so y are u asking us?

AA10373401	get a divorce|`|AA12250380	When a wife starts undermining her husband's sense of manhood she has committed the one unforgivable sin and the marriage is irretrievably lost. <br>  <br>  Start preparing for divorce, aiming to minimize what you will have to give her and then commence legal proceedings. There are plenty of nice girls wishing for a good husband and there is no need to put up  with ball breakers.  <br>  <br>  And I can give you a very good tip for the future. When assessing what kind of wife a woman will make, go by how bad she is at her worst and not by bow nice she is at her best. Also watch their face and voice. Some women look very ugly when they are angry and that ugliness lingers in the memory a long time.|`|oQq1rqDVaa	First there is something else going on here - women do not come out with statements like this unless something is going on that you don't know about.  You can begin by telling her exactly how you feel and I know that feeling talk is hard for a man but that is the way you need to go.  You could say 'You know I felt awful when you made those comments.  I have sexual needs too and if there is a problem then maybe we can talk about it and work it out together.  However, I am not willing to stay in a marriage without sex'.  |`|EbUFcZwAaa	your math is wrong, you are putting 2 + 2 together and getting 4,  <br>  <br>  in a woman's mind 2 + 2 = you are infinitely wrong and you've got to apologize for whatever she's upset about before you "get any".<br>  <br>  suck it up, go get some flowers, some takeout chinese, give her a hug and tell her love her and you are sorry.<br>  <br>  then give her a couple of days where you are really nice to her and all harmonious and then you will start "getting some".<br>  |`|sTgT1lyKaa	That was simply hateful.  No one needs their significant other to treat them like that.  In addition, if she loves you, she wouldn't care about that unless it is due to your health.|`|WgZn5OY7aa	Talk to her and ask her wats wrong. tell her you are really hurt with her reaction.|`|AA11006063	I don't have that problem, but my husband does.|`|BXOS9ad7aa	what????????????????????????????????|`|DKKf3Q0gaa	Well me and my boyfriend are not married, but have been together for 3 years. He has never lost interest for sex, but I have. I like it to be romantic and intimate. I think the reason you have lost interest for sex, is because you are not in love with her anymore. The reason, I say this is because you said you wish you never would have gotten married now. Also going with out sex too, can cause alot of problems in your relationship. What you need to do is just sit down and think long and hard, if you are in love with her. If you come to find you are not, then sit her down and see if she too feels the same way. Good Luck!!!|`|FCoyu33Iaa	Well, to say that to anyone is very mean, but to say it to someone you "supposedly" love is completely wrong.  Was there anything leading up to this remark, or was it out of no where.  Normally I say to try and determine what is wrong with your spouse, but that was just WRONG.  Sorry, unless she was having MAJOR PMDD, you need to think about moving on.|`|0Axv8bPBaa	All the answerer have not picked the que.I advice u to go for a healthy exercise & diet to loose peripheral fats and ur belly fat(mesentric).If a male wants his wife in shape- why can't wife????Get in shape &enjoy life .U can't get married twice or more just to have sex.Remember the law of life-GIVE SOME,GET MORE.|`|AA11452842	I'm guessin you are fat and a bad lay...........|`|bO2rzfISaa	You'd better make up with her...who else'll have you?<br>  EDIT: Al Rozz you are so bad.

wxBFZ41Taa	Your fiance will need to get an annulment. Even though he/she was married outside the Church, the marriage is still "legal" and the Church must declare it invalid. This should be a simple process though. |`|592517cb7a38eb4f9614445c37df538aaa	You can marry as soon as he has his first marriage annulled.<br>  <br>  Yes, even though it was a civil marriage, he still has to get it declared null. However, this is usually a quick "slam dunk" -- they call it "Lack of Canonical Form." It's easy to prove. He'll just have to fill out the paperwork, provide copies of the marriage certificate that prove it was performed by a justice of the peace and not clergy, and pay the processing fee. |`|dQrBlk4qaa	Yes, but you have to go to the church to ensure that they're aware of the marriage, and "void" the marriage. <br>  <br>  The rules seem to be that if your marriage was one "in the eyes of God", then you cannot. However, since it wasn't a marriage sanctioned by the church or presided over by clergy, they give you a big fat loophole to step through. <br>  <br>  Be sure to verify this with your church. Your diocese may view things differently!|`|Z1ZifWGbaa	Yes, you can...even if you have  a child, you still can.  The marriage will have to be annulled, of course, and then you will attend classes in the church before absolution takes place...<br>  <br>  You "MUST" speak to a priest for the proper sequence of events tho...<br>  <br>  I wish you the very best...|`|AA11899639	i think the church frowns upon this- but i'm going to say yes-i believe you can still get married
AA11412999	Depends on the club and the laws in your area.  Don't delude yourself, however.  Swingers clubs don't look like Hugh Heffner's back yard with silicone centerfolds bouncing around the pool in thongs.  Club members are regular, average, everyday people - couples in their 30's and 40's mainly - who are out blowing off some steam for the evening.  Some are dysfunctional, yes, but there are a great many (most?) who are just trying to add a little fun to their marriage.<br>  <br>  Being just barely "legal" might cause some issues, yes.  A lot of the people at the clubs will have kids of their own that are your age.  My daughter is 13; it won't be long and she'll be dating guys your age.  It's just personal preference here, but the idea of having sex with someone who's almost young enough to be my kid is...well...a little creepy.  You may find many others with the same feelings.  And not trying to tread on you here, but I'm also just not attracted to people with whom I have nothing in common.  It's so much easier to relate to people who know what a headache mortgages, lousy jobs, and yard maintenance are.  I mean, can you really see yourself having a conversation about, say, how expensive little league sports are or kids' sleepover parties?<br>  <br>  That's not written in stone;  it's just a caveat.  I'd recommend forgetting about swingers clubs for now.  There's plenty of time to get into that later on.  Right now, just focus on carving out a life for yourself.
EOkOPBMuaa	You have to be very trusting and comfortable with eachother in order for swinging NOT to ruin the relationship. But if you have that kind of relationship, it is a great time and will make the bond that you have with your partner even stronger knowing that you can share an experience like that together. <br>  <br>  My advice is if you do decide to give it a try, talk, talk and talk some more beforehand and come up with what your each comfortable with. And start slow the first time you are with another couple. Don't be in a hurry to do everything you want the first time. |`|AA10826663	Yes. No. Maybe. It depends first upon the couple and to a lesser extent upon the people they interact with.<br>  <br>  The effects will vary, again depending on the couple and the people they interact with.  For some couples, it will bring feelings of freedom and increased intimacy. For others, it will bring boredom or disillusionment.  For still others, it will bring divorce.  It's complicated enough just getting two individuals on the same page, so don't be surprised when disagreements arise over the inclusion of a third or fourth.<br>  <br>  I strongly advise getting professional counseling if you are considering embarking on this adventure.  Be absolutely certain that this is something you both want to do.  And at the very least, make sure you completely understand the physical risks and that you take adequate precautions to protect your health.  Talk to a doctor if you have ANY questions.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|AA11412999	JudyJ, yes it can, depending on the couple.  Some couples are wired to thrive monogamously, and some non-monogamously.  <br>  <br>  Speaking from PERSONAL experience, and not just from down-the-grapevine urban legends, I have to say that it really has given my husband and I the opportunity to grow closer.  As backward as it seems, I have never felt more confident or joyful in my relationship as when we were swinging.  Is my relationship crippled because we're not swinging?  Heck, no.  We just happen to be the type who thrive in that kind of relationship dynamic.  <br>  <br>  And I have never gotten an STD of any kind from swinging!  I attribute that to being very picky about our partners, selecting only those who are as paranoid as we are about catching something, and then following through with strict condom use.<br>  <br>  "... I have also heard that most swingers are on drugs while they do this. I think the problems come in after the thrill is done and the drugs have worn off."<br>  <br>  Actually...I have never done drugs in my life.  I don't even smoke.  Swingers clubs have enough to deal with legally speaking without inviting trouble, so they will routinely throw out anyone who brings drugs to the club or who overindulges in alcohol.  The generally accepted school of thought on drug/alcohol use while swinging is as follows:<br>  <br>  One or two drinks is OK, but being drunk is NOT cool, and NOT sexy.  It's sloppy, not funny, not athletic, and both guys AND women have trouble performing.<br>  <br>  Impaired judgment + swinging = a boatload of morning-after drama.  If you can't do it sober, you shouldn't be doing it at all.<br>  <br>  Contrary to popular belief, swingers are actually a relatively conservative bunch.  Swingers find people who have their lives together and who live in a balanced, health-conscious way are attractive.  Substance addiction indicates a life that is not under control.  We place a great deal of trust in our swing partners when we invite them into our lives like this; how can we feel good about trusting someone whose integrity we feel we have to question?  The "swingers" in question sound like a bunch of vanillas who got drunk at an office party, threw their consciences out the window, and blamed it on the alcohol the next morning.  Not cool.<br>  <br>  And to Quasimodo:  Just to put it into perspective, how many spouses are brutally murdered every day - maybe in the same fashion - over less than that?  How many were swingers and how many were in traditional relationships?  Swinging had nothing to do with the fact that these people had issues before they even got out the gate.  Take the swinger part out of the story and substitute "affair" and suddenly the story looks a lot like the ones that we frown and shake our heads at in the morning news, saying "What a shame."  and "That's awful."...and then we turn the page.|`|h4oHBSJcaa	I think most couples do it for the thrill and they use this as an excuse to cheat and not feel quilty about it.  I have also heard that most swingers are on drugs while they do this.  I think the problems come in after the thrill is done and the drugs have worn off.<br>  <br>  I would never do this........ever|`|2PGOAQo0aa	 I don't know about joy and confidence, but I know a couple who was into swinging until she got herpes and gave it to her husband.

A very large chance of acquiring a non-curable sexual transmitted disease.|`|6sns33traa	For us, yes it does.  This is because we both get joy and happiness from each others joy and happiness.  It's called "compersion" and is the opposite of jealousy, which is insecurity that creates anxiety when your partner experiences joy or happiness that isn't directly associated with yourself.  Jealousy is the fear that someone else, or something else, will be preferred over yourself because you aren't "good enough" for your partner in one manner or another.<br>  <br>  We don't feel that way.  We both are secure in ourselves and in our value to each other.  We both know deep down that we love each other and that nobody else outside our marriage could ever change that.<br>  <br>  What are the effects on a married couple?  Well for us it was an exponential increase in communication and honesty that lead to a better understand of ourselves and each other.  It was not only being able to talk to each other about everything, it was having to.  It was being able to be honest with each other about our attraction to other people without the fear of anger and resentment due to insecurity and jealousy.<br>  <br>  Because of this we have a trust between us that few couples ever have.  We communicate more openly and honestly than most couples ever do.  We can tell each other anything, sexual or otherwise, without the fear of the other getting angry and hurt.<br>  <br>  There is not the fear that one of us will leave the other.  The doors been held open and we both know that we are together because we want to be, not because we have to be because we are trapped in a marriage.  Opening-up our relationship has clearly defined the reasons why we are married to each other and not to other people.  It's not sex. It's everything about our relationship besides sex.  Sex is great between us and always has been, but it's the fact that we are companions and best friends besides lovers that makes our relationship.  We really love being together even when we are not horny and trying to get in each others pants.<br>  <br>  Many of our friends (many that also don't know we have an open relationship) say that we are the happiest couple they have ever known.  They say we act like two teenagers in love.  And I guess we do.  We always are holding hands or cuddling or touching in one manner or another.  We text, IM and text each other constantly throughout the day.  We just love talking to each other, and we've been together over 10 years.<br>  <br>  So for us, yes, swinging has brought us even closer together than we were when we got into it, and our relationship was pretty dang good then, too. In fact, swinging was really just sharing the overflow from our great relationship with others.  Swinging isn't for everyone, but for some it works very, very well.|`|AA11460234	Maybe we should ask the couple here in Connecticut that ended up having the wife run off with the other couple and leave her hubby so she and the other couple could engage in all sorts of acrobatic antics.<br>  <br>  Spurned hubby tracked down his wife, shot her and sawed her head off.

AA11412999	Funny story...I remember one time we had our friends over and we didn't realize that our bedroom window was open.  The neighbours must have been treated to quite the sound experience as we discovered they were outside that evening (we lived in a semi-detached at the time).  Both the other woman and I apparently made quite a bit of noise. ;)  <br>  <br>  Sticks & stones, Jordan...<br>  <br>  The first answerer was right: it's all in good fun.|`|CvdbSeUQaa	It is a great deal of fun and sometimes really funny. :-)  We all look silly when we have sex so sharing that can be hilarious.<br>  <br>  My husband and I were in bed with our best friends during one of those times.  My husband was wearing vampire gloves with little spikes in them and playing with my breasts.  I was laughing because it ticked and laughed so hard he popped out.  So, naturally he reached down to put himself back in but forgot about the spikes on the gloves.  The expression of absolute horror on his face broke the rest of us up.  we laughed so hard we stopped having sex and just went out to dinner.<br>  <br>  |`|05w1azYhaa	Your such a whore rotten spewie. |`|XPVF7Ra5aa	It is all in fun...there is no harm, if it feels good then there are no problems.|`|cDRXtuJCaa	i never get involved it sounds so nasty and tacky not for me |`|hH6kGUvBaa	EWWW I hope you all get tested. My body is not a toilet bowel! EWW COOTIES!!!!
AA11412999	A wise question.  Unfortunately, you and your husband are the only ones who can answer it.  The most surprising thing I discovered is that all of the negative emotions and insecurities that stood to threaten our relationship were not through any fault or negligence by our spouse: they were things that we created in our own minds.  The bogeymen under your bed and the skeletons and demons in your particular closet are of your own design.  They are as big or as small as you make them out to be.  In other words, all those things I was most afraid of happening only seemed like they were happening...because I was unable to take my husband at his word - that he truly did NOT want to hurt me and that his attraction to other women honestly did not change the fact that he was crazy about me.  If your husband tells you this but you can't quite bring yourself to believe it, preferring to believe that there was still some chance that he was just telling you what you wanted to hear so he could bang other women behind your back, then your jealousy will just eat you alive.  But if you really asked yourself whether or not you could really trust your husband, what would the answer be?  Honestly?  Chances are he's not the monster you imagine  in your worst-case-scenario.  That's just you trying to protect yourself.  Trusting someone this much can be really hard, and feeling the weight of such trust from someone else is equally jarring.  But that's what makes the experience so very rewarding.<br>  <br>  I would suggest, after you have determined that you're really ready to give it a whirl, that you start very slowly.  Start with pillow talk (and not when you're drunk or otherwise inebriated...that doesn't count), and move up to mild experiments.  For example, flirting with the waiter/waitress the next time you're out at dinner, people-watching together at the mall, noticing when someone catches his eye when you're out and talking about it.  If you're able to talk comfortably about such things, then try going to a swingers club (be sure it's couples only, and not single guy night, which can be too high pressured on a first outing).  Make up "da rules" and stick to them on pain of death.  Don't do anything more than dance and flirt with other couples on the first night.  Just go to absorb the erotic atmosphere, meet other swingers, and bring home the good vibes to enjoy between the two of you.  Be sure to thoroughly discuss the whole thing in painstaking detail.<br>  <br>  Good experiences are built on trust, and this is how you develop trust, by showing that you care more about your partner's need for emotional safety than you do about your own desire to run amok in the club.  There is no need to rush anything.  As long as neither one of you screws it up by being pushy with one another, there will be plenty of opportunity to experience whatever you like.  The key is to care more about the other person's feelings than you do about your own.  <br>  <br>  It was a ton of fun when we were into it, and there's so much more than just sex involved.  Please visit the site below.  In my opinion it's the best resource on the web for swingers.  Good luck!|`|NOn8IRcVaa	Don't do that. My ex-husband talked me into several threesomes with other girls and you know- despite how much trust you have in each other....it honestly is not what marriage should be about. Do the vows that you said when you got married mean anything? Monogomy is the best way to go about a marriage. While it may seem like it is not a big deal- odds are later on it will eat away at you. <br>  <br>  If you want to spice up your sex life- try new things. There are plenty of things you two can do together that I am sure you haven't tryed. <br>  <br>  |`|tjjy03Yqaa	I have thought about this too..and actually asked about it the other day but it got taken down/flagged.  Thanks a lot PRUDES.<br>  <br>  Anyway, we decided against it.

Go to the orientation and ask questions, they have heard them all.  Then go to a party.  There is no rule that says you have to have sex with anyone or at all.  so go, watch and meet people.  You will find a kindred spirit or you won't.

It shouldn't take a person 10 months to figure out they are in a relationship and they should stop seeing other women. Once the two of you established a relationship he should have cut off the (booty calls) relationships. If you stick around get use to him see/sleeping with other women.|`|AA12187979	If I were a woman I would never ever allow a irresponsible boy to stick his penis in me if he use to do booty calls.<br>  <br>  |`|AA10409800	Nope.  Easiest question of the day.|`|AA11990465	Sounds like a player to me. I wouldn't believe a word he said. |`|IgZbZyPmaa	I think this ultimately depends on several different factors.  If you want a simple answer I'd have to say probably not.  If he's not faithful in the beginning "fun and new" stage, it seems unlikely that he would be in later, more difficult phases in the relationship.<br>  <br>  However, people CAN change.  Has he given you any inclination that he's grown up?  Does he feel remorseful- and I mean genuinely, not just "let me back in your bed" remorseful?  Is he open with you now about his desire to be different.  I think those things would be requirements before you should even consider trusting him.  And even then, he needs to understand he has to earn it back.  He had it once and blew it.<br>  <br>  Otherwise I'd say cut your losses and get out before he does more hurtful things.|`|RPp3WVOnaa	What do you think?  Just talking to other women doesnt constitute being unfaithful but you said he went out a couple of times with one of them.  Your question depends of the level of commitment you two have made to each other.  If you've been together 10 months, he's told you he loves you and only want to see you exclusively and you have expressed the same then I would say you are in a committed relationship. You seem by the nature of your question to have serious doubts that you can trust him.  Listen to your gut instinct.   Best Wishes!|`|e44113cd9f21585ce32b6f910959288daa	You can't say because it just depends on how serious he is about you.  If he lost you would it have a great impact on his life? If not then he will continue to do what ever he wants to do because you aren't a permanent factor in his existence.  Trust is something that is earned not freely given.  So it will be up to you to see if you are willing to be with a man you don't know if you can trust.  Take your time and figure out what is best for you.|`|UW0k9wusaa	I really do not know, but if you want to have a happy relationship you will have to try to trust him.  I kind of went/going thru the same thing.

AA11412999	Jes, you can't convince him of anything.  You're right: he's choosing his dick over your emotional wellbeing.  That is NOT love, regardless of what he tells you otherwise.  If that's what it boils down to, he's choosing himself over you.  What would you call it?<br>  <br>  If you guys have been married less than 10 years - 5 years MINIMUM - you probably won't find success with swinging anyway.  You're still in that 'sandpaper' phase where you're still figuring each other out.  You don't have enough history yet.  Having some history together is important if you expect to have any confidence in a relationship's solidity.<br>  <br>  Jes, do not let anyone talk you into doing ANYthing that makes you feel dirty, bad or like less of a person.  It is very unfair for someone to ask this of anyone.  Neal sounds like he's got some wild oats to sow; I guess it's up to you to decide whether you want to be around while he gets that out of his system.  Because one way or another, he's going to have to satisfy this unrelenting curiosity before he can seriously commit to reliably caring for you.  This means he has to choose: either swallow the bitter pill and possibly become resentful of you for denying him his adventure, or let him go and tell him to get it out of his system.  If he does need to experience these things for him to feel that his life was successful, it's not for anyone to judge - not even you as his spouse.  We might have opinions about that, but a person's personal journey is no one's business but his or her own.  However, this same rule applies to you, too.  He cannot expect you to kill a piece of yourself to satisfy his whims.  You, like Neal, have a right to a full, happy and satisfying life.  If he is proving himself to be an impediment to that goal, you have not only a right but a responsibility to yourself to remove yourself from him, or have him remove himself from your life.  It hurts, it's unpleasant, but the long term outcome is much more painful: literally years wasted stumbling down the wrong path, each step together taking you that much further from where you want to be, and that much more time wasted that could've been spent getting to where you actually want to be.  Each of you.<br>  <br>  Now personally, I feel that if Neal chooses to leave to pursue his adventures, he will eventually discover that the experience is truly hollow, and he was foolish for losing Jes because he was selfish and impatient, not wanting to wait for her to become comfortable, and instead trying to drag her kicking and screaming along behind him.  Time and experience will eventually remove the mystery from around swinging for him and show it for what it is: ordinary sex.  Just with different people.  And it really does lack substance because there is no one with whom to share the experience.  You just have to go home to your empty apartment, crack open a beer, flip on the TV and tell it to your cat.  <br>  <br>  Swinging isn't a bad thing, but for for the two of you, I think it most definitely is the wrong thing.|`|qqRZVKXYaa	Wow...Why on earth have you entered a marriage if you were both clearly too immature to consider the future. Your husband is clearly a sex manic who views his sexual needs as a priority above intimacy. However, I can empathize with his view on things because he has lost respect for your marriage, due to the swinging and his perception of you cheating on him. <br>  I would strongly consider sobering up, from alcohol/drugs, as well as to the reality of the situation. I respect alternative lifestyles, and I don't push any kind of moral code on people, but clearly the nihilism and outright recklessness you two have shown each other must be resolved. Consider counseling because obviously you have problems that need a mediator.

naequcqlaa	Unfortunately acceptance is the hardest thing for all of us regardless of the situation.  And this is just what is giving you your problems.  Yes, of course it does hurt.  I don't believe it has anything to do w/your age, but this was you first love & when we're young, this is just important to us.  I KNOW in time you WILL be able  to move on & accept the fact you just must leave this in your past.  We all have pasts of one thing or another, some are good, some not so good.  But once you accept this is now part of your past, you'll free yourself to be able to move on & start a new beginning for yourself.  I'm a firm believer that things do happen for a reason whether we know the reason at the time or not.  Just know you're young enuf that you have your whole life ahead of you.  We don't know what the future holds for any of us, but you just might have a whole bright new future to look forward to & end up being happier than you could ever realize you could be.  I'm sure working w/her sure doesn't make things any easier for you either. If you can just do you best to avoid her & stay out of her sight as much as possible this can also be a help to you.  Of course you can't imagine getting over this, but that you w/be able to do also.  Just KNOW that in some point in your life there WILL be that special someone who is just for you.  I realize at the moment this is the furtherest thing from your mind, but once you're completely able to "let go" of what once was, you can feel freerer to look ahead at what is going to be.  What you once had w/slowly fade into memories & you'll have a brand new "now" to be able to bring happiness into your life.  You haven't really had the time & I'm sure the where with all to see who else just might be available, but at the time you least expect it, I just KNOW it w/come to you.  Each & everyone of us have losses in our lives of one kind or another & we just wonder if & how we'll ever get over them or be able to go forward, but we do.  My son & family recently lost their beautiful 14 yr. old daughter suddenly in a car accident.  We all didn't know how we were going to manage.  We've taken it a day at a time & very slowly we are starting to heal from it.  This was devistating to us all & very hard for us to accept.  But we have, some days are better than others, but on the whole we are slowly being able to overcome it & remember the good times we had & cherrish every moment we spent w/her.  A loss is a loss & even tho we don't think it's possible to overcome, we do.  You too w/be able to overcome this & at least you do have a chance of starting a new future that at the moment you just are unable to comprehend.  I trust as each day goes by you'll start to feel better & even tho you can't imagine it, I can tell you I KNOW without a doubt you'll be OK.  Some day you'll be able to look back & all of a sudden realize the reason this did happen.  Do your best to know something positive is going to come from it all. Into each life a little rain does fall.  Some day, one day the sun w/shine again for you in your brighter tomorrow.  Take things a day at a time & just know tomorrow is one step closer to feeling just a bit better.  I certainly DO wish you all the best...:)|`|jzCGALKKaa	Neither men nor women are attracted to a desperate suiter. Stop the puppy dog eyes & act like she has no importance to you.

So now you have to go out and find someone else , and once you find the right one you will be happy and have completely forgotton about her .  And when you go to work it wont be a problem anymore because you will know that you have a woman you love at home waiting . So just try and forget about it the best you can , and get backk out there . Try again .|`|2TAq6XO2aa	Man, sorry to hear about this.  Your words probably don't portray the amount of pain u still feel from the breakup.  People say to get over it, that there's no fish on the sea, but they don't realize that you have to see this one everyday! and that u still love her!  My ex dumped me, told me I was evil, and said she was no longer in love with me, and the only way I got over it was when she went off to college, so I couldn't see her.  I think u need to ask yourself what's more important, your job, or your emotional health, your happiness?  You need to get away from this girl..one way love hurts, and makes her revere you as wimpy.  Good luck bud|`|QQ57J9VDaa	It's going to take time. A relationship that long and with that amount of feeling will take time to get over. Besides, working with her doesn't really help. But, I am not going to tell you to quit your job just because of a girl. If you really want to, then go ahead. It's up to you whether or not you think quiting and finding a new job, will help. But, if you really love her that much and don't wish to move on, or think it might be what you really want to do, try to win her back. If you do not succeed, then you are going to have to move on. I am not saying that it will be easy, it won't be, because honestly, when is something ever that simple? Take some time off of work and go on a vacation or just sit home and relax. Maybe what you need is to get away from her for a little while. But you don't have to quit your job to do it either, only do so if you feel that is best.|`|MxR3waRnaa	We always want what we can't have, if the magic is over with her chances are you can't get her back, I had the same problem and no matter what you do once they lose the spark that connected you its dead.<br>  <br>  The hope i can offer you is to get back out in the field, it helps you forget because if what she said is true no tears will be shed for you. |`|quynjD7Paa	It's only been a month, it's going to take longer than that and even longer because you work together, if there is any way for you to avoid seeing her do it, just keep busy and keep your mind off the break up, its just going to take time|`|ONvkGXdmaa	Well the best way to handle this is to go on with your life i mean when you see her say hey and all don't be rude to her or anything and times are getting to hard to quit your job. Just move on don't get stuck on one chick and trust me its no fun being in love alone. If it was meant to be she'll come back. Im not saying this will be easy but move on and she realize what she had in a minute but by then it might be too late for her.|`|4gIOfawaaa	You  just need to try get over her. I know it'll be really hard. If she doesn't feel anything for you then there's nothing really you can do about it but be friends with her and hope that her feelings for you come back. If I were you I would just try and get over her and look for another girl. I mean she was your first right? There's other fish in the sea, man. You'll find another girl, just have hope. The first decent girlfriend I had started to have no feelings for me  and I was crazy in love with her. She told me she feels like we've been "ONLY FRIENDS" the past week and that pretty much meant that her love feelings are gone. It took me over a year to get over her...And there was a point where I thought she liked me again but really she was just playin a game to see if I'd break up with the girl I was with just to get with her again...I never did. I played games back and told her I broke up with my girl when I didn't...But i'm single now...Still looking. Just gotta have hope.|`|q5XXHxioaa	GET OVER IT MOVE ON, She is not the only fish in the sea ,life is too short to dwell on a lost love. Start to date other people  out side of your job Please,|`|1KaBPme5aa	TIME if she means that much to you ask her out! with roses or send her movie tickets in the mail dont say who it is when she gets there tell her how you feel tell her just do this once to prove o her self|`|MD6wHiLXaa	find a new job then.|`|1df31c9db3dcca4d09a9e2c45066a64caa	Try to start with accepting what you can't change. You can't make someone feel the way you do and they can't make you change how you  feel either. You may feel that way as she's the first one  but don't have to limit yourself to other happiness if you learn to let her go. IF she doesn't change her mind later it wasn't meant to be then. Do NOT pursue this or try to win her back, she'll see it as harassing and you could be in jeopardy on the job then if this is attempted at all there.<br>  <br>  I would not do other than to see she's a coworker now and act like it.<br>  I would not dwell on this, it's tough to let go but it's best. You'll see.|`|4qevcGUNaa	The best revenge on an ex is living well. Move on.
dYPffc13aa	Well, for one thing, you don't know for sure she'll turn you down. Just take a chance and ask to spend some time with her. I'll let you in on a little secret, girls often times look for the sweet guys, the ones with character and grace, as well as morals. Looks are not always top priority. Life is not about denying yourself happiness for fear of rejection, talk to this girl and get to know her, or you may find you'll regret it. Besides, what is the absolute worst that can happen? She may turn you down, and if that happens, pick yourself up, give yourself some time to recover, and then look for another who'll like you, for you.<br>  Best of Luck! |`|n4N35Cugaa	if u said she's average to cute to others then u might have a chance... unless u say she's super hot then its different.. get a new do or something & go say hi.. if u want it, work for it..|`|ae48365b65bb6b1cb9d2865a047ffb20aa	Well in one sentence you said you want her and how great she is, and then the next sentence you said she is not that great. Anyway, what is holding you back? If you think she is the greatest thing on two feet, what is stopping you. I mean this in the most genuine way. If you like this girl, go up to her, start a conversation, and go from there. I look at this way, you only get one life, so if all you do is dodge every chance you have, you are going to be unhappy, and miss out on allot of stuff. And what is the worst that could happen, she says no. Really that is not the worst that could happen, so go for it, and really if she says no, it will just show her you got the fortitude to ask her out. I hope this helps.<br>  <br>  -Ty|`|xnvoaQJKaa	I guess Im a bit confused on why you keep saying you cant have this girl she has a bf? is thats why you cant shes with someone else. if shes not then I cant see why your thinking an feeling this way, if you really like this girl an shes single there shouldnt be a problem you just have to have confidence in yourself an get to know her be friends an go with the flow an you never know you might just get on like a house on fire.. good luck|`|HMFsaJteaa	Find someone better or go gay.
JgTmXrojaa	i agree with the first responds, i don't think you should allow that to happened, as you said you want to get married before that happen, i respect you in that, i don't think you should go for it, i think you should stand your ground, if he love you he can wait, |`|lb6jBcDiaa	you both are young and reckless<br>  if he loves you he'll respect you<br>  2 and a half years tho is a while to go out, and its hard to tell if hes using you for sex, because a guy woud wait possibly 2 months before dumping you if he wants sex<br>  he will change yes, but it doesnt mean it will be in a bad way|`|yIufTLWwaa	If your not ready then he should respect that... if he loves you he can wait! dont let him preussure you into somthing your not ready for.|`|c560cd0063dd9ad6f45df09fd1589422aa	wow if you want to wait and you waited so long then you should not do it wit him and i no you love him but if he changes just because you dont want to have sex then you will know that hes not the right guy for you to marry, its normal for a guy to want to have sex 3 girls and hes only 19? i dont think you should at all if he has needs you can accomplish them in other fun and non penetrating ways he should respect your decison not to do it dnt ever let the thought of him breaking up or changing influence such a big decision|`|bXsmpHSkaa	If he has waited 2 1/2 yrs then he can wait until your married. Your only 17 yrs old and I wish I would of had the strength to wait until marriage. It is so important to be true to yourself. You know in your heart that waitng is the right thing to do! Not only will you thank yourself in the long run but he will thank you and respect/cherish you more..|`|n4N35Cugaa	okay ure like 17 and he's like 19.... if u wanna believe that he's promising the truth of marrying u in an effort to get u to sleep w him then YOU ARE SO NAIVE, GIRL.... ure only 17... so what if he breaks up w u? he's 19 and he's had 3 ex gf. i think he's keeping a list of the girls he's dated..|`|N2Cj2fZ5aa	If waiting until marriage is that important to you then you shouldn't comprise your morals or beliefs for him. And if he is pressuring you and willing to break up with you over sex then he isn't the right one for you. But if you feel like you are truly ready then go for it. |`|9rLTE4Gaaa	Im assuming that over the 2 and a half years you too have bonded and created a relationship. Now!! Him telling you dat he wanted to have sex shows that he has openly asked you and I am sure that if you say no he will understand.... You need to think about this different people have sex for different reasons you need to think about why you want to have sex and don't just do it because he wants to you should want to also because Im telling you now if you don't want 2 don't because u could start backing out while your getting unchaged.... If his dumps u just for not wanting to have sex, then forget him its good because then you know that if you continued to have a relationship with him and he asked you another serious question that didn't agree to he could ditch you n you would have wasted your first time

upoCLdSlaa	well, it sounds like you are taking this relationship seriously, and not just kidding. it kind of depends on how long you guys have been dating. let him know how you feel, again, and my advice would be to give him about one more week to get into shape. (if one week doesn't sound good, then set a time before you do anything-- make it reasonable) if he really does care about you, then he'll do anything to keep you in his arms. if he doesn't satisfy you, then just forget about it. move on, and grab another guy. relationships are tuff, but if you handle them the correct way, you'll save a lot of time, energy, and block A LOT of stress. good luck, and i hope you consider my advice!!!<br>  ~ cuteducklingxoxo|`|RsnQ23XBaa	it sounds like he needs his space. just give it to him and let him figure it out. you cant and shouldn't try to influence his decisions. if it was meant to be he'll come back.<br>  good luck.|`|15eb8387d74986a6f6f9cf3828274860aa	Please maintain him as your own .|`|7e9f66e8183a6115754d5680f9ad5f36aa	ugh... drama.|`|kTXJD0Gfaa	If he hasn't even try to get in touch with you in a whole week, then he's just not that into you... and even if you don't want to believe he might be with someone else (even if its just to screw around).

I tend to go on the negative side too when I don't hear from my boyfriend for a while but then I remember that sometimes I get really busy I don't have the time but really want to talk to him just to say hey. He always understands because he gets that busy sometimes. So just know that will call you the minute he can :)|`|Tc90UAezaa	I would say that you need to express your feelings to him. Since he works, why not suggest to him to buy a prepaid,or trac phone to contact you. Find out if he really wants this relationship. However, it sounds that you've made him the center of your life, everything is based around him. You need to find yourself again, it's not healthy for you to put all your energy into him and he may not be doing the same. I agree you need a break this is an eye opener to you to regain power of yourself and life.|`|Xpkp2e1Daa	Your situation was with the same as one of my best friends. I'm going to tell you what i told her. I think you guys are in the process of breaking up. Yes, her boyfriend was the sweetest guy ever, but it was hard for both of them to make time for each other, and their phone calls started out daily but then it seem less and less.  I didn't want to hurt her by telling her the truth but they eventually broke up.  Like he was trying to avoid her for a couple days, and he finally just end things.  So if I was you, I would try to find him, and see where things are.  If you're willing to keep him, try to figure what's going on.  But if it's over, beat him to the punch. Cause for sure sweetie, he's trying not to hurt you by ending things, he maybe avoiding you because he wants you to end things instead.
7Vhlszr1aa	I wouldn't worry about it, he should of made that contact with you when you wrote to him the past two times.  he probably had or was talking to someone else and hoped that things would work out between them.  it probably didn't and thats why he made contact with you again.  take his question with a grain of salt.  if you're still find interest then reply and tell him why.  If not, just ignore him as he did.  As for me, should a female that i find interest and she did that, then i would just forget her.  <br>  <br>  Think of it this way, you were interested at the time and attempted every little bit, why shouldn't he?<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|kVg3VlGFaa	He's playing games and want you to chase him.

My bf and i have been dating close to 3 years and we are on a break now, were only 16. A little bit of Distance doesnt hurt. He probably was having mixed feelings for you and didnt understand why that was happening, give him a week or two more. If he says he needs more time then I guess you can move on. You should not stop living because of him. If he really is going to break up with you then he must be extremely immature for such age. I really hope things work out and take care of your little girl:) best of luck.|`|thW6k4zXaa	Wow, that's rough...I seriously think that maybe he tried to play single and flirted with a few girls.  Maybe one actually called him back and it's possible that he could've been talking to her on the phone but not have gone out with her yet.  I think it is wrong the way he is doing this to you and your daughter because when you are hurting so is she.  He is only thinking of himself right now and being very inconsiderate.

I am so sorry you're going through that!  I have a feeling you already know the answer though, right?  <br>  <br>  This is just my personal opinion; but when a man/woman is giving you the "I need a break" speach or even better, the b.s. he texted you "he needs a few more weeks to see how it is without you" is just an immature way of having a serious conversation about your relationship.  I say serious because your daughter is involved.  You're not just go 30(ish) year olds w/o kids dating.....to me, when kids are involved; you gotta ask yourself a question.<br>  <br>  Am I dating a man or a boy?  To me from what your describing, he sounds like a boy.  He either doesn't want to hurt your feelings for whatever reason or doesn't know how to "man up" and talk to you about the relationship.<br>  <br>  You also said you live an hour away and you do the driving to him on the wknds?  Girl, c'mon!  <br>  <br>  Think of it as a big flashing bright can't miss it sign!!!  Do you really want to be in a long term relationship with someone who can't even be straight with you?  Weather or not something happened in your relationship or not, you don't need that crap.<br>  <br>  And since you asked what Yahoo! what we'd do; this is what i'd do:<br>  <br>  Don't call him<br>  Don't text him<br>  Don't email him<br>  Don't (anything) him<br>  <br>  I'm not at all saying that's easy either, but, sheesh.... don't kiss his ***.  And i'm not saying you did that, but for the love of God, please don't text him or call or anything anymore.  He's just getting off on that anyway; probably like: "yeah, I got her" or something like that.<br>  <br>  Why not make HIM WONDER WHAT YOU'RE UP TO instead of the other way around?  You like how that sounds, right?  <br>  <br>  Let it go girly..... as hard as it is- let it go.  Besides, you posted this today 11-17-08 ok, Halloween was 17 days ago, and your "boy" wants a few more weeks?  WTF for?  That's a month and a half.

Put your daughter first.

It seems that your boyfriend had never had any intention of staying the long term with you.  This is not how a 35 year old man would act if he truly wanted to spend the rest of his life with you.  Do you really want to take a chance on someone who won't take a chance on you?  Please move on, both of you will be much better for it.|`|xMA4sgboaa	that is totally B.S. that he is doing that to you. I don't know all the details i.e. how you treat him, how he treats you etc. He just randomly pulled that crap? and he needs that long of a break? man... that is weird. my advice (even though this will be tough, it always is) is just leave him alone and show him how independent you are. He wants his space, give him it. Don't even talk to him in any way, let him come to you if he wants you. Hopefully, the time away will drive him nuts.
n4N35Cugaa	firstly how did he sound when he said that? that should answer ur question...|`|U3mbaDocaa	well i think he means he can't tell if you like him like want to be friends or something more maybe he does like you...|`|AA12048332	TEASE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...|`|GjziP3Rdaa	Thats just another way of calling you a tease.

XV1arNEzaa	Tell her how you feel. Let her know that you think that she is someone you want to be around. But don't be clingy or creepy. Make sure you tell her what your situation is. This is the most important part: Don't get too involved, you may get your feelings hurt. If you are going to be leaving soon you may not have a chance to develop a strong connection. This may lead her to feel like she is not committed to you, and move on while you are away. But hey she could be special and really like you and wait. But if you don't tell her how you feel you will never know. But be romantic, its nice to have that once in a while. |`|AA11412068	Well, then ask her out..

Z9r5lphvaa	Yes  marriage is the most important decision in your life. why? Because you are expected to keep it for the rest of your life. By the way, to not marry is also a decision that is actually a fallout of the same question. Either way, its an important decision.<br>  <br>  Just as we are influenced by our parents in our childhood, our adulthood is shaped by our life partner. We become who we are influenced a bit or largely, by our partner's little choices (believe it or not) - movies, literature, music, sports, even food, opinions, clothes !!!<br>  Subsequent important decisions such as career decisions, financial decisions, personal decisions are all taken, taking into account your significant other.<br>  <br>  The world begins viewing you as a single "unit" - a couple. Later, families, in laws, friend circles and kids.......<br>  <br>  Of course its the most important decision of the adult life!!<br>  Personally, I've never believed in "temporary marriages", but if the outlook is short-term......well.....its of short-term importance !! And if there are kids involved.....it is no longer a question about only your life......|`|vJP6yTy3aa	so far, it has been.  one of the other important ones has been to have kids.  we're TTC right now, and that's the biggest thing right now.|`|AA10373401	Nope, i just don't put that much thought in it.

It'll probably end in a costly divorce anyway.  That's what's happening to me right now.  Save yourself the headache AND the money.  I'm not saying don't get in a long term relationship.  Just don't sign that paper.

If it doesn't work out, there is always an exit.  I believe that the most important decisions any person must make is, one,  whether they want to have children or not. For a woman this is critical because of time constraints and once the time is passed, there is no turning back, she can't make that decision any more.  Important decision number 2 is deciding that you are going to live your life the best and happiest way that you can, regardless of other peoples opinions.  It would be a sad moment in your old age to look back at your life with regrets.|`|sErT9VPJaa	Yes,marriage is the most important decision in an individual's life.Being married for 10 yrs. I can say that it is worth your life.till the day you get married someway or the other you feel you are dependant but then after marriage others depend on you.Your spouse,children and the closer family.And not only that every decision you take affects the entire family who is depending on you.The choice you make,makes a lot of difference in your as well as the others.|`|54M1JBJcaa	marriage .. of course is important<br>  of course .. all are important<br>  but you cannot consider it as the most important one ..<br>  your goals ..<br>  your ambitions ..<br>  your education ..<br>  your health<br>  and so many are important in your life<br>  more than marriage<br>  we can survive without marriage but i donot dispute it also gives you a good support in your life<br>  so marriege is alao important but not the most important one ..|`|1GOoFqdjaa	ya its a very important decision in ones life because life is incomplete without half life which we have to spent with over partner.

Call off the so called engagement and get to know each other. Date. Don't live together. You are not mature enough to do this. You are not ready to do this. Eff your 20. Live a little, stop promising your life and love to some random guy off the street. 3 months is not a long time. 3 months is nothing and you think that you want to marry this guy....pretty pathetically crazy.<br>  <br>  If this is what your relationship is like now, wait till your married and start popping out the kids.

You can always call off the engagement... it's a lot easier to get out of than a divorce is gonna be.  |`|wu2g3BtRaa	My personal opinion is youre both too young to get married.  Also you don't know one another well enough... it's only been 6 months since you've met.  You should give your relationship more time.  By the way, do you both work or are you supporting him?  There are alot of unanswered questions, but bottom line, don't get married yet... it sounds as though he's suffocating you if youre not allowed to have your own friends, and the fact that you feel he lies to you is not good... you don't want to start a relationship on lies.  |`|0Nsfj0leaa	Looking at an "engage man": Here is what I think I would see.<br>  I would see a man that is showing me his best. I have been married for just over 20 years. When my husband was first taking me out, he open the doors for me, he pull out my chair for me, when we walked down the street he always was on the outside.. I knew just what kind of husband he would be. 20 years later he is still doing all those things and more. If your fiance is acting like this now...What do you think he will do when you are married? Most people that have (or had ) a abusive mate always say "it started out with yelling and ended with being hit. I say it is time to leave and find someone who know how to open doors and treat a lady like a lady.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|dAT4n8rsaa	First of all, you guys got engaged way too quickly. I mean, two months!? But I don't blame you. True love can drive you crazy!<br>  When people get engaged really fast, they don't really know  themselves. As time passes, it may end up like yelling, screaming, crying because it all went too quickly. <br>  <br>  And I think you're absolutely right. He says 'let's get married tomorrow' , after fighting with you!? What is he thinking!?<br>  <br>  I'm not sure what to say. I think that you guys should spend more time together and know each other better before getting married. You have to know if he's cheating on you or not. If it turns out that you two are not perfect for each other, dump him. Find someone else and don't get engaged too quicly again! But if it does work out, then that's good! You guys get married and live happily ever after. I suggest for you to start to know him for... 4 months? Well, that's just my opinion. I hope everything goes well.|`|k3obZ8Dqaa	a liar is always going to be a liar. And you would an idiot for knowwing that he is lying to you and still get into that marriage. Why is that even a question...Should i stay with someone that lied and someone that is always fighting with you. <br>  <br>  thats the reason why you need to take at least 2-3years + to get to know a person before you marry them. Also you shouldnt move in with someone til after marriage as well. Thats my opinion.  <br>  <br>  <br>  So i recommend cancelling the marriage and returning his ring. asking him to leave and if he doesnt call the cops. Because okay picture the future you guys get married and something happens he screws up lies or whatever and you have kids and you want a divorce you ask him to leave and he says no im not leaving and is defensive and stuff. You have just brought such a bad man into your life and you knew he was a liar and u knew the way he was and also you brought kids into this relationship and they are going to suffer from this. You need to think of the future when it comes to these things. You cant marry a man you know his badd flaws. they are not little flaws that are loveable they are flaws that will have a big affect on your future. |`|rE1eW8Ifaa	maybe take a little break and allow you both to miss eachother and crave eachother ha<br>  <br>  or maybe do something together that will involve a lot of fun and togetherness just go out somewhere cute, even if you dont actually spend money. like go walking along a bridge together, something that can keep a good memory and make something 'yours'<br>  <br>  i know you feel like the idiot when youre not the one doing anything wrong to try harder, but if he is definately what you want then give it ago. it sounds like hes being a big pain at the moment. give him a kick up the bum! :)<br>  <br>  good luck!
wlSD6Ccgaa	why waste a week?!<br>  seriously this guy has poor hygiene,"to pee...he uses a bottle!" that's vile!!!<br>  <br>  <br>   bumps your confidence at every given opportunity "says my vagina smells" who says that to thier g/f?!<br>  <br>  he is selfish "asks for bl0wj0bs all the time" but won't return the favour!<br>  <br>  why do you love him? what could this guy possibly offer to make your life better?! you deserve better hun move on.|`|td6WXhv4aa	<br>  <br>  Why wait a week? ditch him now sounds like a jerk.|`|8U1aivfwaa	ultimatums usually don't work|`|Dgt66Tg4aa	what a f*ing bum.|`|MtL2fZjOaa	Yes its a good idea :D <br>  and you must really love him because he is gross lol, peeing in a bottle, same clothes for 3 days, he's an  ***, I mean what kind of guy tells a girl that they are going to get wrinkles?..., I think you could do better than him, but if you love him then giving him a week is more than fair enough.  |`|S8mbXHUUaa	He's like a step lower than my ex.  For someone who'd be concerned with wrinkles or appearance, he doesn't have good hygiene. If he's like this about sex, he's probably getting it from someone else.  If he tells you to give him head, tell him to go choke and swallow, slap him, and tell him you hope he stays lonely and you'd feel sorry for the next girl because he's filthy and they all deserve better than trash.  Do this if you  plan to leave him for good and you want to make a lasting impression on his ego.  I know I'm mean, but I was the nicest girl at my school, until this guy messed me up. Don't let a him question your value, especially when it comes to your body.  You're worth more than that.|`|wu2g3BtRaa	Dear one you should have "dumped" him eons ago.  My vote is to get rid of him now.  Hun, believe me when I say you don't need that type of person in your life.  Time to dry those tears and not look back... there's too much for you to find out there but make sure you look upwards, not backwards.   and the fact that he's got a smelly penis -- absolutely obscene!|`|KsXdWO85aa	Dump his low life ***.<br>  <br>  You deserve SO MUCH BETTER.<br>  <br>  you sound like a really amazing girl too be with, but unfortunately for him, he's lost in his pathetic little world. <br>  <br>  Do him before he dumps you, it will feel SO MUCH better then getting dumped. |`|tb0NMaooaa	right here: He wears the same clothing three days in a row, hardly brushes his teeth, and is too lazy to even go to the bathroom to pee...he uses a bottle!<br>  <br>  <br>  i woulda dumped him long time ago. gross|`|phUQktLZaa	why wait a week - seriously this guy is not a good catch, read what you've written, if a friend of yours had described her bf like this what would you be telling her now?|`|AA11966889	dump him now|`|9slEygm6aa	Wow, he has some really bad habits. Even if he does shape up, it will probably only be a short time before he gets back into his old ways again. I would start looking for a new boyfriend. If it is that bad now, just imagine how bad it would be 10 years down the road!!|`|RJX1FYY0aa	He' s a gross, selfish, pig! If he is lazy enough that he urinates in a BOTTLE, imagine what he will be like if you were to get married. If you <br>  two were to live together, he would trash the house! If he's older than four, he should realize he is disgusting. I suggest not even giving him a week to shape up. Just dump him. You might hurt for a while, but it will benefit you in the long run. Best of Luck! :)|`|hi1eqrXwaa	first of all, how can you stand it that "he wears the same clothing three days in a row, hardly brushes his teeth, and is too lazy to even go to the bathroom to pee...he uses a bottle!" That is freaking disgusting! You should have been done broke up with him. Ughh. It makes me wanna throw up!<br>  |`|rLqpBqtuaa	if he doesn't appreciate you like he should, talk to him about it.<br>  and if he doesn't take your talk seriously, or he doesn't take it to heart, dump him. you could find someone who treats you amazingly, and not like you don't matter.|`|y7ybrmtVaa	Sorry, but he seems rude & obnocious. But I think you should tell him to shape, don't tell his you'll break up with him otherwise... just tell him to shape up... if he doesn't within the week... dump him.<br>  |`|kj430OiQaa	dude you cant change him.. he'll be the same in a week.. or if he does "shape up" it'll only be temporary. dump him now so you can get over him faster. that's a mistake girls make- thinking they can change guys. |`|TqWDKmhHaa	You give him one day to shape up or dump him not a week. If he doesn't dump him!!!!!!!!!!!1|`|avyFgIVSaa	Good idea.<br>  <br>  He is draining you girl, and not good enough for you.<br>  <br>  Good luck,|`|nU1W6qvgaa	dump that low life immediately!|`|6TRc1nKyaa	Sound to me like do doesn't really want to be with you. Dump him!<br>  <br>  ~GOOD LUCK~|`|fSt5Lzaoaa	I would definitely dump him because he sounds very gross and very rude! GOOD LUCK!|`|F6wLGNTHaa	dude, BREAK UP WITH HIM|`|P7HbvTdzaa	dump that shizzzface|`|0BKpJ168aa	I think you should leave him today!  He is disgusting! He is not going to change. The things he does are habits embedded in him and they don't just go away. He is mean and disrespectful. Don't put yourself thru that a second longer than you have to. You say you love him...it doesn't sound like he loves you so why waste your time? Get it over with now!|`|BZYguWrNaa	if he only asks for bjs and wont return the pleasure to you, then that is rude and not how it should work.<br>  <br>  he seems rude and ignores you. it sounds like he's making you miserable.<br>  <br>  give him a week and if he's still rude and treats you like crap then there are other fishes in the sea. |`|SrbsmTW5aa	Yes. I think  that would be the best solution .If your boyfriend doesn't treat you with respect,doesn't care what you think is rude, and doesn't have the hygiene of a 6 month old child you should end the relationship for your own good because it doesn't sound like your getting anything out of it.|`|VVncVDcEaa	Why give him a week? Dump that loser now! You deserve better girl. If he loved you he would not treat you like this! Repeat after me... I am a loving person who deserves better than what he has to offer. Don't walk from him run. Let him do it to someone else. There are wonderful guys out there that would love you no matter what.|`|cYVMA15Daa	hes a total jerk dump him but chances are the christmas present is really for u but if he loved you he would do anything
inuecfP7aa	Is she a sound sleeper lol<br>  <br>  You said cheating is not a option|`|agTCqkLDaa	If she has changed passwords that you once had then she is possibly cheating (whether she leaves the house or not); it may not be physical cheating but possibly emotional cheating.  This is not definite but just o ensure you're not ruling it out.  <br>  <br>  Part of marriage is compromise and she should take your suggestions for therapy seriously and not throw things.  The next time she says "it's not you; it's me" tell her kindly that while you're glad it's not you that it is imperative to your well being and marriage that you know what's going on with her.  Ask if there is anything you can help her with or anything you can do.  <br>  <br>  Comfort her with knowledge that you don't want to leave her because when you married her you made a promise to her to be there for her in sickness and in health, but that if this issue is not in the very least attempted to be resolved that it's going to affect your well-being (because it will emotionally).<br>  <br>  I know people want to write it off past a certain point, but physical affection is a very important part of a marriage.|`|AA10373401	if she wont touch you, then reach out and touch someone else|`|AA11391968	If the drinking hard is still continuing that could be a large cause of the problems.  Alcoholism is progressive.  If not, it sounds like she became angry/upset with you at some point and is punishing you by using sex as a weapoon.  That is why she is remaining jealous of you.   Ask her to tell you what you can do to repair this.  Then tell her your marriage depends on it.|`|MMF1YmZZaa	Therapy is really the best answer, but if that is impossible then-----???  Does she have a sister or cousin or friend that you could talk to? Maybe they could possibly help you?  Has something happend to make her feel uncomfortable (ie-weight gain)? <br>  <br>  Have you tried writing her a heart wide open letter? That actually really does help. <br>  <br>  I had a boyfriend once and I really didn't like to have sex with him.  I never told him but I tried to make suggestions to him like lets try this or lets go buy some toys etc and he wouldn't do any of it.  After awhile I just stopped having sex him and then we broke up.  I didn't want to hurt his feelings and make him feel like he was bad in bed, but maybe I should have if I wanted to stay with him. <br>  <br>  Unfortunately sex is a need, and this is not going to work out if you are both not satisfied. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|YzObEmUqaa	Sorry to hear that<br>  I think she has issues<br>  You gotta really sit her down and talk to her<br>  Whatever it takes <br>  Use creative side of yours make her open herself up<br>  Create a friendly environment..Talk about life<br>  Each other dreams in life<br>  Your relationship with her, the direction you guys are heading into<br>  How are you guys gonna achieve your goals<br>  Through compromises, commitment, devotion..<br>  Feelings for each other...<br>  You know make her open up one issue at a time in a way<br>  Then you would narrow down each subject she has talked about<br>  And slowly and effectively lead her to talk about intimacy...|`|9I7YogHXaa	I think you're wife is just not that into you. Try offering her a back massage and creep your hands around to the front...try making it about her to get her in the mood|`|eFDOhVGLaa	She may not leave the house, because her lover is coming to yours.|`|6IeHe5rPaa	I say suprise her one day and do something freaky that will make her want you.|`|OTvymEWGaa	She has a (Cyber) boyfriend!!  It sounds like it will go real-life soon!!|`|AweWEVuEaa	well just speak to her about it rather then asking everyone here....only you and her can get through this.....so ask her if she has any fantasies she needs fulfilled or if something is bugging her or maybe you guys just need to try and approach sex in whole new way.....only she will be able to give you the correct answer that you need to hear..|`|I920tAmUaa	I think you have really approached this in an open, caring and logical way. I really think that there is something going on with your wife. Think about what has changed the past few years - stress, weight, mood, career, family, fights, finances, kids, death in family. It doesn't seem like there is something totally obvious, but a combination of many things. I really think there may either be a resentment or disconnect that your wife has in the marriage. What is she not getting to make herself emotionally and physically connected and open to sex. Women build up resentment over many years and withholding sex could be a passive aggressive attempt at getting back at you? This may not be it, but then my next thought is she has an emotional or physical issue either in her past that has surfaced and her emotional instability history and present could be part of the symptoms. Party girls that drink heavily and sleep around are not typically the picture of emotional health. What was she trying to numb, she has replaced the booze with isolation it sounds.  This is her problem and I am not sure how you can fix it by yourself. I am not sure if you need to play a trump card with a suggestion for trial separation or the "D" word to strike the fear in her that she needs to shape up and fix what is going on.  Going this far to the edge too could make it worse. I'm at a loss myself.|`|OYD5QqBfaa	Wow! That sucks,... you have tried everything and still no action, i think its time to tell her she needs to put out or you are leaving, sex is much more then an orgasm, its the feeling of being loved and close to each other, its a way to show great emotion and love... i hate saying this but if i were in her shoes and w/ the info given i would have to say that A) she is emotionally cheating on you, someone over the internet maybe? B) repulsed at the sight of you or D) depressed, depression can minimize your sex drive. do you have kids? does she work? there is something wrong, maybe she isn't in love anymore and as far as her being jealous goes she may be keeping her options open, she figures if things dont work out for the Other Guy (if she is cheating) then she wants to make sure she is covered. This is a hard situation and the only way you two can get through it is COMMUNICATION, do anything yell fight scream whatever just try to express your feelings! Good Luck!|`|izcQ2zXTaa	I would maybe talk to a counselor, because you might have some pains that are holding you down from the next course of action...<br>  <br>  ask the counselor for some understanding as to what is going on... there is that possibility that you have overlooked something...<br>  <br>  tell her you are going to a counselor with or without her?<br>  <br>  Ask her if she loves you... if it is too late?<br>  <br>  as always try to talk to her about your emotional/physical needs and if she doesn't care, well maybe it is too late...<br>  <br>  I would hire a private investigator, and maybe gain some insight into her nocturnal communications, and second start moving your finances into an overseas bank account, she might just try to cook your goose.|`|jQ6CiVldaa	the question is, why has your sex life disapearred.<br>  it was all well at first it seems and now nothing.<br>  you seem like an honest man who'd never cheat<br>  but shes human too and going sex less for a long time?<br>  are you sure shes not cheating?<br>  maybe something has happend and you need to have a talk with her.<br>  or maybe the love is gone and the intimacy is gone<br>  therapy is a good idea<br>  especially for her at first to see whats wrong<br>  and then couples thearpy and sex therapy to spark the fire again<br>  if it doesnt work out in the end, at least you know you tried and it didnt work out. <br>  plus, its never the end of the world. maybe your life together has come to end short.<br>  but optomistically, you should tell her how you feel and ask her what you guys should do and what she expects you to do as shes makign you wait.. shes lucky you havent cheated and all..<br>  <br>  hope that helps..
iDo5oxubaa	You can't do anything until they break up. Don't try to break anyone up, because it is not worth it. Also, if they break up and you start to date her, she will probably be upset for a while, and he might try to start a fight with you. Guys don't like to see other guys with their ex-girlfriend right after they break up. So my advise to you is, don't do anything until they break up and wait for a while after they do. She will be upset and might not be up to dating right after.|`|cfc794c02beace0d0ed122ea3ddf8771aa	Just remain a friend, even if her and the guy break up.  I would rather keep a friend for life than potentially ruin a great friendship.  If your meant to be more than friends; it will happen at the right time.|`|gYyW39wTaa	i think you should stay away from their relationship.Maybe when they breakup,you can make your move|`|MYCnuOfAaa	I am assuming you are asking what you should do. I know that they are going through their own personal issues... but the best thing you can do is be her friend. <br>  <br>  On the flip, you can be honest with her but don't go in with any expectations after telling her. In my opinion, I would wait because you don't want to be the stand in as she is going through her difficult time while she is vulnerable. You want to be sure that you guys are compatible... and that will be after their relationship is over. Give her a chance to heal so you are not just a rebound boy. <br>  <br>  One more thing, be sure if you decide to tell, that is worth the risk because I have been where you are and actually dated my best fried. In the end, it didn't work out AND I lost my best friend just because it left us feeling too awkward to talk to one another. You want to be sure before you cross that line.|`|1keH3R6paa	It's honestly none of your business, but seeing how she's your friend, ask her if there's something going on with her and her boyfriend. Say you're a concerned friend and would like to help. Good luck.|`|ytBI9PwOaa	Wait until she is finished with her guy then make your move!|`|AA12132104	what and how u shoud do? idk|`|AsaJwuIiaa	well...since the girl and the boy is fighting constantly. you should be the shoulder she needs to cry on. be her BEST friend. that way when she's down. you cheer her up and she'll trust you. she'll feel protected.<br>  when her and the boy have a really long fight, try and make a move. <br>  <br>  that's what my second boyfriend did. me & my first boyfriend was like that boy and girl. i talked to my second boyfriend a lot. (we were getting close & i started liking him.) anyways. my second boyfriend started talking to me more and more. i ended up liking him. he made a move and asked me to be his girlfriend. i accepted and dumped the other dude. :]<br>  <br>  maybe that could happen for you <br>  <br>  hope that helps & doesnt make you confused :/|`|YdtUUN9faa	You should let her know that you're there for her, and tell her that whatever happens you will be by her side. You should spend more time with her and show her how much you care.  Maybe she'll realize that she likes you better anyway and leave her current bf, or maybe she'll just see you as a loving, sincere friend.   <br>  Hope I helped.|`|7dvVy0sIaa	If you know her then you will know if you should try and persue something with her or just leave things the way that they are. Tell her how you feel and see what her response is. Also, make sure to let her know that you will stay by her side no matter what she decides|`|3dCDo6zYaa	you gotta wait the existing relaltionship out.... No matter what you cant try to move in on another mans girl no matter what the relationships like|`|EmCotYekaa	stay out of it if you get involved they will resent it just be there for her,when they break up you'll be where you need to be|`|YBwJvDUEaa	If it's that unstable it won't last much longer, then you pounce.|`|ug2ZIhPYaa	Go for it, just watch out for the friend zone....
wu2g3BtRaa	he's 11 years older than you are... of course youre head over heels :~) he's been around the block a few times and knows what he's doing.  the extravagant date to you may just be a normal date to him.  i would leave it alone and not ask anything yet.  you've only dated a few times but the fact that he's still asking you out definitely means he's interested in you and enjoys your company.  just enjoy being with him for now, as time progresses and you continue to date, things will become more clear but if they're not more clear, ask... just not yet... it 's too soon in my estimation.|`|4LsF70cjaa	For heaven's sake it only been three weeks.  What's the rush?  Lighten up.|`|j2FTGSlLaa	you're rushing things, it's too soon. just enjoy his company and see where things go. if you push him he might just run away or chuck you. would you really want him to make such a premature choice?|`|xcV1oVJLaa	three weeks is nothing....If I were him, it would seem a little pushy for you to bring up the subject...
