Both me and my fiance work as servers at different restaurants and it seems like more people are tipping a lower percentage (15% is considered 'good' around here and we have been seeing a lot of 10% or less).  Ordering a less expensive entree then tipping well on it still puts less money in my pocket than used to be there but that does not bother me, I mean I understand eating out is a luxury, but I just don't understand the person who orders the expensive entree and tips 8%.  It seems to be like this for everyone so I really doubt that our ability to provide good service has suddenly gone down.  Just wondering
