ot1ZZexeaa	Your options depend whether or not you have an ASN/ASD or a BSN. If it is the former you are pretty much tied to the field (this is why i strongly advocate that people get a BSN). If you're the latter you can pursue opportunities in case management, program supervising and consulting with allied health organization. Some of these career paths might require further schooling, however. Unfortunately, nothing pays as good as nursing, unless one is willing to obtain an advance degree. Them's the breaks.<br>  <br>  Of course you can always wait table, as you don't even need a HS diploma to do that.|`|XzLUA7ataa	You might go through a certification program for Physical Therapy Assistant, Mammography, Surgical Technician, X-Ray Technician,<br>  Occupational Therapist, Veterinary Technician or another along those lines, or consider working in the pharmaceutical industry, or with BC/BS or another health insurance firm.|`|7amGyOw9aa	Check out www.alljobstoday.com!
7628c38bd2b4ddbbe04c4cce50a9edf2aa	As the author of the job search book "Think Like an Interviewer: Your Job Hunting Guide to Success," someone who's taught accounting, and a student with 15 graduate credits in accounting, let me answer your question.<br>  <br>  Simply put, the answer is yes! A bookkeeper's job is to record transactions and run a variety of financial reports. The bare minimum here is financial accounting.<br>  <br>  Now as far as accountants go, there are varying levels of jobs within this category. For example, some "do it all." Now this would require an Associates or a Bachelors. And depending on the firm, perhaps a CPA.<br>  <br>  But others handle specific types of accounts. For example, some only handle A/R, A/P, G/L, or Revenue accounts. These are jobs you could do with either a certificate or an Associates Degree. In addition, there's payroll that you could do. Some companies put payroll clerks under their accounting departments; others lump them in with their HR departments.<br>  <br>  So your Certificate or Associates Degree would qualify you for a multitude of positions within the accounting profession.|`|1c4256f905a272aacbd200f6119e4124aa	Bookkeeper, yes. Accountant, no.<br>  Accountant positions usually require a minimum bachelor's degree. Bookkeepers can be entry-level positions, but there aren't a lot of these sorts of jobs around anymore--too much software does the work for you. You can be a "bookkeeper" if you know how to use Quicken--and that's almost a no-brainer learning curve. If you start with an associate degree, depending on the college where you get it, you may be able to transfer your credits to a 4-year program which will allow you to get your BBA. That depends entirely on the universities involved; and it will require good research on your part to find them in your area. <br>  <br>  For more information try looking through Barron's Profiles of American Colleges--the first 100-pages or so are invaluable in finding out this sort of stuff and how and where to search. You can find this book at any chain bookstore (like Borders, Barnes & Noble, etc.)<br>  <br>  Good luck in your career.
CL9zXIA7aa	Tell the loan company you plan to sell the car and that they had better work with you else they'll have to repossess the car and both of your lives will be miserable. And never ever again buy a car with anything less than 40% down lest you find yourself in a mess like this again. Better yet, next time save up some money and pay cash for a nice used car. <br>  <br>  Exactly what were you thinking when you gave up your full-time knowing you had this huge debt and big monthly bill hanging over your head? Didn't plan this out very well did you?|`|AA10481071	You should have thought about this before buying a new car.  you will have to get a full time job to pay it off, or sell it and put money with it to pay it off.<br>  <br>  You can sell it and have someone take over the payments,  and then you are out of it.<br>  <br>  You might have to just give the car free to anyone that will take over the payments.  But at least you will be out of trouble.   But nobody has credit to buy it, so I don't know what you will do.<br>  <br>  I guess you can just turn in the car and keys and try and hide from the payments until you can pay.|`|AWSmknxLaa	quit school<br>  <br>  you should not have started school with so much debt.<br>  <br>  You will most likely have the car repo'd.

If you let them know that you are having trouble making payments but still want to do what you can, they may be willing to work with you and figure out a payment plan that you can afford for now, and then when you can afford to pay more you can catch up.  They would rather get some payment each month than no payments.
PxoKseAiaa	Your father probably has been getting letters since he got behind on the mortgage. <br>  <br>  What happens is, the lender will not accept a *partial* payment.  They want the 3mos your father owes plus any late fees.  He has to pay this amount in order to avoid the next step, which could be foreclosure.<br>  <br>  He should talk to the lenders loss mitigation dept<br>  and try to rectify this situation as soon as he can.<br>  It sounds as if your mom won't be in a position to help financially if she is ill and in the hospital.

I have lost 140lbs and have noticed that I have more opportunities that my education and experience alone didn't seem to provide. <br>  <br>  While it's entirely possible there has been hiring discrimination against fat people, employers might not even be aware of their biases against them.

ywEIQEPkaa	The main interest rate is set by the Federal Reserve Bank (also known as the Fed). The Fed sets interest rates to affect the amount of money in circulation and to affect the ease of obtaining money on credit. <br>  <br>  For example, when the interest rate is low, it is cheaper to borrow money, because someone who takes out a loan haves to pay less in interest. When interest rates are high, a borrower has to pay more in interest.<br>  <br>  You might ask, why wouldn't the interest rate always be low? Well, there's another side to interest rates. When interest rates are high, people who invest money RECEIVE more money in interest. So high interest rates reward investment and saving.<br>  <br>  It has been argued that leaving interest rates so low over the past decade contributed to the present financial crisis. Because it was so easy to borrow money, people borrowed money when they really shouldn't have been. For example, people borrowed money to buy a house they couldn't really afford.<br>  <br>  Finally, the base interest rate, set by the Fed, is not the only interest rate. Banks can set their own interest rates, which vary even within banks, based on the Fed's rate.|`|aC00XDRnaa	Economics 101.  The Fed generally lowers rates to encourage investment to stimulate the economy.  Rates are generally raised to curb inflation or slow down capital investment. Simple example.  A family would be more enticed to purchase and finance a home at 6% than at the rate of 9% thus stimulating our economy. I will have to disagree with Marcus on one point.  The problem was not lower mortgage rates but sub-prime rates given to individuals that qualified for homes they could not afford due to fraud and misrepresation of income and debt by purchers and lenders.|`|kL41a5Bnaa	The federal bank changes them to help fight off deflation and inflation.

Then if you know the products you wish to sell, you can contact the manufacturer directly.
ot1ZZexeaa	Say, "I decided to pursue other opportunities." And leave it at that. If they wish to speak to someone from your previous place of employment, have them speak with a coworker, not your boss. If you were at the job for less than six months, it's acceptable to omit it from your resume and it would probably be in your best interest to do so.

3mAgM405aa	Here's a short list of jobs in the U.S., Canada and Europe which you can create to generate income:<br>  <br>  1. Learn calligraphy so that you can provide handwritten invitations and thank you notes to prospective wedding parties, birthday celebrations, etc. Seek out clients through wedding planners at nearby churches and temples. A starter calligraphy kit usually runs around $20 and anyone can easily pick up this skill. The going rate is usually $1 per hand addressed item.<br>  <br>  2. Seek from your neighbors a gardner position which involves planting, weed removal, plant/tree trimming, light brush clearance. You will be using the neighbor's equipment and tools. Again, do not represent yourself as a lawn mower since there are any number of safety issues involved. A door-to-door solicitation of surrounding neighbors is required and you can charge between $6 to $9 per hour.<br>  <br>  3. Offer policing/removal or clearance of trash services to surrounding neighbors which involve trash pickup within nearby residential area. Limit the extent of pickup to small areas and be aware that there are no hazardous terrain or elements involved in this process. Again, a door-to-door solicitation of neighbors is in order. You can charge between $6.75 to $7.50 per hour.<br>  <br>  4. Acquire a set of window cleaning tools [a bucket, liquid window cleaner, sponge, squeegee, handle with an extension and a small step ladder] and solicit local businesses for your window cleaning services. However, be careful to limit the height of the window cleaning to no higher than one story. Charge $1 per window panel.<br>  <br>  5. Visit your nearest beauty salon and ask to be trained as a shampoo person who is also willing to sweep up fallen hair on the ground and do set ups [arranging dye kits, curler holders, etc.] for a set hourly fee.<br>  <br>  6. Become a sign flipper by contacting your nearest realtor. A flipper is someone who stands at a major intersection and flips a "For Lease/Rental" sign in order to attract visitors to an open house or to a particular real estate listing. The hourly pay is at least the minimum wage.<br>  <br>  7. Why not become a paid feeder servicing the disabled at nearby nursing, convalescent, assisted living/care centers and hospitals. It involves feeding food to patients who are unable to feed themselves. The starting rate is $8.00 per hour. The only downside is that one has to take precautions to wash one's hands after each feeding. A posting of your services [by a business card or flyer] on a reviewable bulletin board would be enough to generate customers. The paid feeder position is one of the fastest growing occupation at this time.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|DuIv5462aa	babysitting is a great way to make easy money.<br>  just let your neighbors know you're interested/available.

uBtWPy7Gaa	Yes of course you can still make money.   you can also still lose money - trading forex is simply gambling.  Most people that trade in forex do lose money.|`|jZMDYsVOaa	Hi,<br>  <br>  As a new trader to forex, you need to be able to easily identify the key factors that make up this business. Knowing how to trade isn't good enough. Knowing why you should trade, for what reason and how to control yourself play much bigger roles in long term strategy.<br>  ? Trade On News: The majority of currencies make their biggest moves around news, because there is always some juicy piece of information released that has an effect on the market. Most of the biggest players in the forex business make the majority of their trades when the news comes on in the morning. It prepares you for what is to be expected. <br>  ? KISS - Keep It Simple Silly: Often the best traders out there don't have this complex sophisticated trading strategies because they're often ineffective. The best thing you can do is get down to the basics of this business and keep it as simple as possible. <br>  ? Eliminate Emotion and Your Ego: These are probably the two biggest enemies you'll run into. You won't have to worry about the competitors in the market, you have to watch yourself. Making an emotion trade is just plain gambling. When you have problems with your ego, you start to try to prove something(to someone else) and usually end up showing off. They're both losing strategies. <br>  ? Get Automated Software: Having software like Forex Killer can save you a lot of time since it will automatically go through currency data and graphs searching for profitable trends that you can exploit.<br>  <br>  All the Best!
1hciyvKdaa	I buy from 100 mainly and occassionally from 99. I read the negative comments if there are any. I take into account what they say. about hard or rude to communicate with. SHipping times arent grounds for not purchasing from someone. <br>  Read the ad, the entire ad five times, make sure you understand and all your questions are answered or email them. What they say is what it is, you cant buy then say like oh I want to do this or that. I love ebay, I do more, buy it now instead of auctions sometimes it seems the pesron has a friend bidding, and now with the new system you cant see the history of the person your bidding against. Anyhow, just know if they say, non refundable, they mean it, if they say gently used, it might be more used than you think.Ads without pictures I never order from. Only use pay pal to pay, sellers still try to sneak in other payment options, and that is not allowed anymore. Good luck.|`|YCmf9fT6aa	2%

aqsUYT9naa	Karen,<br>  <br>  Sorry to hear about the recent loss of your husband.  It sounds like you are talking about a "small estate".  The definition of a small estate varies from state to state, but is generally $25,000 to $50,000.  If that is the case, you should be able to present a copy of the death certificate and complete a small estate affidavit vouching that you are entitled to the funds as next of kin.  Many banks have a standard form that you can complete -- if not, you may need to consult an attorney or find one online.  If the total estate is larger than the definition of a small estate in your state, then you will need to go through probate.  Best wishes!!|`|Z5baAx6Vaa	Sorry for your loss.<br>  <br>  If he does not have anyone listed as a joint or a beneficiary, you will need to bring in a death certificate along with something showing that you have control of his estate.

1c4256f905a272aacbd200f6119e4124aa	There is one you may not have thoguht about, and it's kind of strange, but there is an actual job out there if you are willing to do it: doing makeup and hair for the deceased. Most funeral homes don't have a person on staff to do these things--they hire people in the area to do them, or contract them out to local beauty salons.  If you are willing to do makeup or hair for the dead, you don't mind driving a ways to get there, and you know what to do, you may have a lifelong, recession-proof career, and pretty much can set your own prices. Call your local funeral home to find out what they would pay for such services on contract if available, or if they hire out these services. <br>  <br>  And yes, I'm very serious here. This is not one a lot of people think about.<br>  <br>  There are also jobs such as cosmetic coverups for people with disfiguring injuries or deformities to the face and head. There are entire lines of special makeup for this purpose, but few people do the work. You could, again, find a niche market that would supply you with a good career for a long time if you were willing.<br>  <br>  Or here's another one: selling wigs and hats to cancer patients. When I had cancer there was only one woman in four counties who did this. She came to my house, she brought a selection of wigs, and hats, and she let me try them on with gentle encouragement, good lighting, nice suggestions, etc.---she made me very comfortable and was really compassionate. I was in terrible shape, and she really lifted my spirits. You could also offer to do makeup and color correction for the skin--many cancer patients are either jaundiced (yellow and sallow) or so pale they can't find commercial makeups to make them look good, let alone go out to try them on at a cosmetic counter! This would be a wonderful service. You can post your cards and fees and so forth in any oncology office anywhere--they always have a bulletin board for such things. <br>  <br>  Hope that gives you some good ideas. Good luck!
ot1ZZexeaa	You should apply now and accept the job on the terms under which they will offer it to you. I started my "real" job three months before I graduated and I just had to make the best of it. I was fortunate that my senior year was mostly work on my undergraduate thesis and not classroom time. Getting a jump on the job market, particularly in this market is highly advised. Accept that you will be on their terms and not your own. The market is tremendously competitive and you're up against people who can start immediately.

5BTKscZraa	A legal threat over the phone does not mean that you are really being sued. You can tell for sure if  you are really being sued if the following has happened: You are official served a summons (usually be a sheriff) from the court with a confirmed court case docket #.  A letter or verbal threat from a debt collector threatening legal action is not a summons or official lawsuit.<br>  <br>  Debt collectors LOVE to pretend to be attorneys (or represent them) when this is not the case to scare you into giving them your bank checking numbers. <br>  <br>  When a debt collector first contacts you, your first step should ALWAYS be to request validation of the debt per your rights under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act. Even if the debt is valid, request validation anyway.<br>  Send this debt collector a letter via Certified Mail with Return Receipt (NOT regular mail) stating:<br>  <br>  Per the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, I cannot officially respond to your claim until validation is made for the alleged debt. I am officially requesting validation of your claim, to include:<br>  <br>  - A copy of the original application with my signature for this alleged debt <br>  - How much was this debt purchased for? <br>  - What is the “Date of Last Activity” being used to calculate the Statute of Limitations for the alleged debt?<br>  <br>  This letter has been mailed via Certified Mail with Return Receipt. Receipt of this letter is being officially time stamped. <br>  -------------------------------------- <br>  * DO NOT sign your signature on any document that you mail to a debt collector. It could end up on a forged document that can be used against you. Simply type your full name.<br>  <br>  When they call back, tell them: I have sent a certified letter to your office officially requesting written validation of this alleged debt per my rights under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act.<br>  <br>  Per this federal law they must provide written validation within 30 days and they must cease collection activity until they send you written validation. Do not let them scare you with bogus threats during this period.<br>  ==============================<br>  FYI: Paying back and old charged-off credit card will not help your credit rating. <br>  <br>  *  Debt collectors will often pretend to be (or represent) attorneys when this is not the case. This is a violation of federal law. To confirm if this is a “real” legal threat, ask for their attorney’s full name and license number in the state bar association. Call your state bar association to confirm this info.  If they refuse to give this info to you, then the legal threat is probably a bluff.|`|IKakoOfyaa	It varies from state to state whether unemployment is considered garnishable.  If not, if you have any personal property (car,etc.), you may be forced to sell and use that to pay your debt.<br>  <br>  If the law firm won't negotiate, go to the original creditor and see if they will.  If they won't, you really need to see an attorney.  One option would be to file bankruptcy.  It will remain on your credit for 7 years but will wipe out your debts.  If you incurred the debt in 2003, it is not past the statute of limitations for recovery.|`|5f297977fd704bd8099a65707f996f59aa	You are entitled to get a free copy of your credit report once a year.

It is their job to harass you into paying the debt by whatever means they think will work, but there are guidelines they must follow by law. The Fair Debt Collections Practices Act lays out the law regarding collection agency practices: <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/pubs/consumer/credit/cre27.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/pubs/consumer...</a><br>  <br>  Also go to a site called Bud  Hibbs. He has much valuable information regarding dealing with collection agencies. Whatever you do, DO NOT promise to pay or make a payment on the old debt as it re-ages the debt and you start the clock over again for another three to seven or ten years.<br>  If you have a dun from the collection agency you have thirty days to ask for validation of the debt. While you are at it include a demand they cease and desist calling you. By law they cannot call you anymore. Send the letter to them certified mail, return receipt requested.<br>  If you get a summons to go to court by all means scrape together the money to retain a consumer lawyer. They are worth their weight in gold and will save you one heckuva lot of mental turmoil. They will also be way less expensive than paying the outlandish fees the collection agent is trying to get from you. <br>  Good luck. In these hard times people need to know their rights when dealing with these carrion of society. Most people will pay if they can, but when they fall on hard times food, rent and utilities come first.|`|OacSIfSiaa	First thing to do is see if this debt is beyond your states statute of limitations.  This is the time frame for a creditor to seek legal action.<br>  If the debt is "time barred" then they can not touch you at all.<br>  <br>  Many junk debt collection agencies will use illegal tactics to scare you into making a hasty decision.  If you pay anything and the debt is past your state statute of limitations, you will reset the SOL and they then can take you to court.  Many are also known to show a payment as having been made when there never was one made.<br>  <br>  Check the following web site to see what your states laws are concerning credit card debt.<br>  <a href="http://www.creditcards.com/credit-card-news/credit-card-state-statute-limitations-1282.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.creditcards.com/credit-card-n...</a><br>  <br>  IF today was the first time they have contacted you then under the FDCPA 15 USC 1692g, § 809. Validation of debts:they  must comply with the following:<br>  (a) Within five days after the initial communication with a consumer in connection with the collection of any debt, a debt collector shall, unless the following information is contained in the initial communication or the consumer has paid the debt, send the consumer a written notice containing—<br>  (1) the amount of the debt;<br>  (2) the name of the creditor to whom the debt is owed;<br>  (3) a statement that unless the consumer, within thirty days after  receipt of the notice, disputes the validity of the debt, or any portion thereof, the debt will be assumed to be valid by the debt collector;<br>  (4) a statement that if the consumer notifies the debt collector<br>  in writing within the thirty-day period that the debt, or any portion thereof, is disputed, the debt collector will obtain verification of the debt or a copy of a judgment against the consumer and a copy of such<br>  verification or judgment will be mailed to the consumer<br>  by the debt collector; and<br>  (5) a statement that, upon the consumer’s written request within the thirty-day period, the debt collector will provide the consumer with the name and address of the original creditor, if different from the current creditor<br>  (b) If the consumer notifies the debt collector in writing within the thirty-day period described in subsection (a) that the debt, or any portion thereof, is disputed, or that the consumer requests the name and address of the original creditor.the debt collector shall cease collection of the debt, or any disputed portion thereof, until the debt collector<br>  obtains verification of the debt or any copy of a judgment, or the name and address of the original creditor, and a copy of such verification or judgment, or name and address of the original creditor, is mailed to the consumer by the debt collector.<br>  <br>  What all that means is if you do not get anything in writing from them, you will have to file a dispute with them via usps in a letter requesting validation of the debt.  You must send it certified mail/return receipt for your records.  This will put a temporary halt to any legal actions so you can figure out what your next move will be.<br>  <br>  Also if the debt is time barred then by making the threat of a lawsuit violates § 808.

I have heard of them only being able to garnish up to 10%, but it said that things like alimony, child support, or back taxes are what they would go after you for.  So, again I am not sure about old credit debt.  Do you have any information on the credit card, who they sold the collection to?

He or she will ask for a disclosure (they usually don't have one). Even if they have proof that you paid with-in the last six years these debts are usually handed to one credit co. to another. They will take a cut on what you owe them (usually .30 of the dollar of your original dept is what you have to pay) The lawyer cost around $200.00. Until you are served by an official person (by me it was the police) I wouldn't do anything. If it was in 2003 that you last paid-then your six years is probably up. Don't send them any $-the moment you do you start the Statue of Limitations up all over again! You will be on the clock for another six years. Good luck-believe me I was surprised myself on how this worked (I asked my lawyer that if I don't talk to some certain family members for six years-do they go away too?

UnA531DNaa	From personal experience, either the child support department has their numbers wrong and your father needs to take his reciepts down to them to get things straightened out, or he has been lying to you about the child support.  Either way, it's you're father's deal, let him deal with it, your job is to be a kid and not worry about it, just don't stress him out with silly requests for stupid frivolous crap.  If it's just you and your brother with him, where are your sibling(s) that he's paying for?  Somehow, they haven't been getting their money, and may have been living without all the luxuries you've had all your life, i assume.  <br>  <br>  If the money was the last of your mother's life insurance, and if you don't get it back, you're done for, please look at this realistically. Done for means what, exactly?  You can't go to the mall with your friends and buy stuff?  You can't get what?  $50,000 - $100,000 isn't going to go far, not unless your dad has his own income, like a job.  If he does, he should be living within his means.  If he's working, then you shouldn't have to worry about things like food on the table or a roof over your head or a car payment.  <br>  <br>  Either way, it's up to your dad to fix this mess.  Perhaps you're right and he's been sending child support faithfully - and somehow the child support office doesn't know about it... but honestly, if there's a child support judgement, he should be sending the payments to them, not directly to the mother of his other kids.  That one is on him... it's like you passing your homework on to someone you hate, and hoping they pass it on to the teacher to be graded... if they're split, then why would he send her money directly?  There's no guarantee she'll tell the child support office that she's getting money from him, if there's no paper trail.

In fact, the credit card company will just take your payment and apply it to the lowest interest rate balance first.  In other words, if you have a balance on purchases with a lower interest rate than the balance you have from cash advances you might have taken, that payment you send every month will go towards lowering the purchases balance first, while they keep accruing the full amount of interest they can get on the cash advances balance.  Which is why it never pays to take a cash advance from your credit card.<br>  All you can do is write one check for more than the minimum payment, even if it's only five dollars at first.  Remember that you finance charges from the month before become part of your balance next month anyway, and interest accrues on that amount too.|`|MbzyriZ4aa	When you get your monthly statement the Credit Card Co. will state what the minimum payment due is.<br>  <br>  That does not mean that you can not pay any amount above that minimum payment including the full balance due.<br>  <br>  There is no need to send them 2 separate checks. One Check will do the same thing. But that check needs to be a reasonable amount that covers the interest payment (minimum payment) plus a part of the principal.<br>  <br>  If you have a balance of $1000 and they ask you to pay $30 min. then you should be paying $200 for the next 5 to 6 months and get this card paid off.<br>  <br>  Nobody said you could not send more than the minimum payment.|`|aEeCCHVlaa	I  round up the dollar amount of the monthly payment, never the minimum due.

It makes absolutely no sense to write a separate check earmarked for finance charges only.  In fact, I can't think of any type of loan where that would be advantageous.<br>  <br>  Paying the minimum payment will take forever to pay off credit card debt.  Typically, only about 1% actually goes towards the principal.  If you want to make progress, you have to pay more than the minimum payment.  <br>  <br>  Just send one check with as much extra as you can squeeze out of your budget.  The extra goes toward the principal.  The faster you pay that off, the less interest you have to pay.|`|hSOYndoxaa	I know you can do that with car payments but I have never heard of a such thing with credit card payments.

Phone numbers are scarce these days and numbers have to be recycled before they've been out of service for any length of time.

About the only thing you can do is to send the collection agency a certified letter stating that you just got the number and you are not the person they are trying to collect from.  Just telling them over the phone won't help because the people who do owe the money try this all the time.  <br>  If it gets worse and several collection agencies call about your only option is to get a different number and hope for better results.|`|AA11774722	This may not solve your problem but it will make it so much more entertaining!

And there's the added bonus if you are able to bring in other new candidates to this program.  So, if you do not want to keep strict track of such offerings and do not have others to recommend, then the overall pay per hour for all your survey taking may prove to be of little value for all your efforts.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|2iuZdBXraa	It may be legit but you won't make money.

I would recommend health care. Also one more plus in health care is that it is recession-proof, because everyone still needs health care in the recession.

You can place all the online ads for free and learn about online marketing at the same time. The skills you will learn can later be applied to any other business ideas you have. <br>  <br>  You'll be helping your parents get rid of old items and make some money. You may be surprised at their reaction knowing they have a budding Internet Entrepreneur in the house! <br>  <br>  If this works out you can approach other family members, friends, neighbors, referrals and build a solid network of contacts that you can offer this service to.

At least that way you'll have "your" money and not have to rely on Mum and Dad for stuff you want.<br>  <br>  I had friends in high school who used to do deliveries on bikes for the local pharmacy.  They would deliver old people's prescriptions to them.  <br>  <br>  You're 13, so you shouldn't be worrying about your family's finances. You can't do much to contribute money-wise, but what you can do for your family will be invaluable.  Your parents are probably stressed out of their brains.  If you take on some of the jobs at home, and do the washing, or cook tea, or do the cleaning, so that they don't have to, that'll be one less thing they have to worry about.  <br>  <br>  I work 2 jobs to pay a mortgage.  I can't tell you how much better life is when I come home and find that my partner has done the dishes or washed the towels.  Just doing a few little chores around the house will ease your parent's burden and make them less likely to get depressed.  So focus on supporting your parents in non-financial ways.  They will really really appreciate it. <br>  <br>  Don't stress, okay?  There isn't much you can do, so don't stress about it.  Just help out at home.  It'll use up your stress hormones and make you feel better.

AA11639059	Before you get too tired of the "no acre is the same" you have to understand what it is they are saying. <br>  <br>  Honestly, you sample the trees on the property you are thinking of harvesting. Then you have to make a reasonable estimate of the numbers and method (clear-cutting or select harvest for instance). Then you have to figure on disease and splintering. What if you shatter some good trees when you fell others? How are you going to get them out? What are you going to do with the waste? Are you going to plant replacements? Do you have to give land cover for subsequent rain and snows (the trees themselves are part of a phenomenon called a water shed, a forest is essentially a massive sponge when it rains or snows, holding water and dribbling it out more gradually, and reducing soil erosion in the process.<br>  <br>  If your development is going to be paid for by the timber, then you might start with your buyer. Have them look at the land and the trees and give you a bid and perhaps let them select the trees or stands of certain types. Don't worry about acting dumb, you've done that already here. But when you price the felling and the cleaning and the transporting to their specifications you will have a good idea.<br>  <br>  (A friend of mine had some trees knocked down by a strong wind on the west coast, he found a buyer and after they hauled them away the value of the timber almost paid for the damage done to his house and car, which happened to be where some of the trees fell. So I know that what you ask is potentially possible.)<br>  <br>  Finally, "my lot, which has not been found yet" tells me, among other things you've said, that you really haven't dug deep enough into this for more specific answers.

Its disadvantages are the reduced cash flow and overstatement of reported income.<br>  <br>  The advantages of LIFO are that it results in the highest cash flow (by reducing income taxes) and it best measures net income by matching the cost of sales with most recent costs to replace inventory sold. The disadvantage of LIFO is that inventory on the balance sheet is understated.<br>  <br>  Note that the advantage of FIFO is a disadvantage of LIFO.

Most of my Amazon purchases have come directly from Amazon but I have had a few from sellers.  Check their ratings carefully & read all the fine print - specially regarding returns.  Sellers on both want to achieve & maintain good ratings so most will go out of their way to accommodate.  Buyers are rated also.  <br>  Just familiarize your self with the process & your confidence will increase.  Good luck.|`|AA11357056	I've ordered a few books before - the shipping charge is set by amazon, so its pretty much fixed.

So I definitely would recommend it!

RhEhzGbraa	My suggestion is that you not try to earn money online. There are many people who prey on teenagers and others that are vulnerable on the internet. An example that was recently shown on television was about teenagers who logged onto sites that ended up downloading spyware on their computers and the spyware was used to get their parents information off the computer and commit crimes against the parents.<br>  <br>  Do not use the internet to earn money! My suggestion to you is that you try things like babysitting, offering to do chores for others, cutting grass, other yard work, offering to help arrange yard sales and taking a percentage of the sales, going to the grocery store and offering to help people load their groceries. Walking dogs and or offering to clean up their poop from yards are also very well compensated. If you have elderly people in your neighborhood many times they need people to do errands for them. Also ask your parents or other responsible adults for ideas. <br>  <br>  I am sure you are smart and if you get together with some of your friends you can brainstorm and come up with even more ideas. Just make sure that anything you plan is approved by your parents first. And of course, the most important job is one that you already have which is to go to school and learn as much as possible so that you can have a great job that will earn even more money in the future.<br>  <br>  In terms of yard work, I have a client who started at 16 and as of today owns a lawn care company that does over a million dollar in sales per year and employs numerous people.  Even if you don't want to do the yard work yourself, you could organize others to do it and you do the sales (i.e. get the clients).  Working in fast food restaurants is very hard work and not very well compensated.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps. Good Luck!|`|QU5neCD5aa	you can also work on a farm or baby sit other family member's children|`|ub3Yg7Hvaa	I thought about the same thing when I was your age.

MbzyriZ4aa	You need to do some "restructuring".<br>  <br>  Don't sell the funds you already own... at least they are accumulating a lot of cheap (unfortunately worthless) stock shares right now.<br>  <br>  Pull out your last fund statement and look for a fund (or funds)  that still makes money. (Probably one you aren't invested in...).<br>  <br>  Add these fund(s) to your portfolio.<br>  <br>  Rearrange your distribution. Allow 2% to go to each of your old existing funds and the rest goes into this new fund(s).<br>  <br>  This way you are keeping the old funds and there is still a chance that when and if the market turns these shares will recover in Dollar value.<br>  (But they are no longer being fed...)<br>  You are directing most of your new incoming money towards a fund that is making it thru this mess in one piece.<br>  <br>  Most likely only the money market funds are still showing a moderate gain... it does not matter. If it made money in this climate it should become your new best friend until the market recovers.<br>  <br>  Then you can re-arrange your distribution percentage again and should come out with most of your money intact.<br>  <br>  I would rather see a modest 2% gain right now instead of a 50% drop.|`|yZDw2lBFaa	Leave the old money there, but invest the new money into difference type of funds (may be index fund), or put half of your money into stock, now it's a good time to get in (so many discount), if you stop now you might end up paying income tax (lose for ever), or you can put 3% and do catch-up when you get older,as today economic play it safe, keep some cash in your pocket if you pull out completely, it will take longer for your investment to recovery.|`|w9xx0SPaaa	Dont pull out completly.. if you do you get hit with federal income tax and additional 10% early withdrawl fee...<br>  <br>  if you can financially maintain 9% do it!!! stick with it, it will definetly recover<br>  <br>  if you cant stomach waiting for the recovery look into borrowing against your 401k and getting real estate|`|Ch9TedMcaa	No. Keep doing just what you're doing.

However, you need to get informed about the different fund options in your 401k plan. Some will perform better than others.<br>  <br>  If you have a company stock purchase plan, look into that. That can be a great investment with average stock prices at record lows.<br>  <br>  Remember, this is long term investment. don't look at your short term valuations. Eventually, the recession will end and the stock market will get going again.

b6cPtJ6haa	Lawyers are a dime a dozen, go medical. Heck, there is a shortage of pharmacists and their median wage is $98,000K well above lawyers. Dentists 180,000K median and there is a shortage, and of course a shortage of MDs.<br>  <br>  From US News, Poor careers for 2006<br>  Attorney. If starting over, 75 percent of lawyers would choose to do something else. A similar percentage would advise their children not to become lawyers. The work is often contentious, and there's pressure to be unethical. And despite the drama portrayed on TV, real lawyers spend much of their time on painstakingly detailed research. In addition, those fat-salaried law jobs go to only the top few percent of an already high-powered lot.<br>  <br>  Many people go to law school hoping to do so-called public-interest law. (In fact, much work not officially labeled as such does serve the public interest.) What they don't teach in law school is that the competition for those jobs is intense. I know one graduate of a Top Three law school, for instance, who also edited a law journal. She applied for a low-paying job at the National Abortion Rights Action League and, despite interviewing very well, didn't get the job.<br>  <br>  From the Associated Press, MADISON, Wis. (AP) - A lawmaker who persuaded the Assembly to eliminate all state funding for the University of Wisconsin law school says his reasoning is simple: There's too many lawyers in Wisconsin.<br>  <br>  From an ABA study about malpractice claims, More Sole Practicioners: There appears to be an increasing trend toward sole practicioners, due partly to a lack of jobs for new lawyers, but also due to increasing dissatisfaction among experienced lawyers with traditional firms; leading to some claims which could have been avoided with better mentoring.<br>  <br>  New Lawyers: Most insurers have noticed that many young lawyers cannot find jobs with established firms, and so are starting their own practices without supervision or mentoring. This is likely to cause an increase in malpractice claims, although the claims may be relatively small in size due to the limited nature of a new lawyers<br>  <br>  “In a survey conducted back in 1972 by the American Bar Association, seventy percent of Americans not only didn’t have a lawyer, they didn’t know how to find one. That’s right, thirty years ago the vast majority of people didn’t have a clue on how to find a lawyer. Now it’s almost impossible not to see lawyers everywhere you turn."<br>  <br>  Growth of Legal Sector<br>  Lags Broader Economy; Law Schools Proliferate<br>  For graduates of elite law schools, prospects have never been better. Big law firms this year boosted their starting salaries to as high as $160,000. But the majority of law-school graduates are suffering from a supply-and-demand imbalance that's suppressing pay and job growth. The result: Graduates who don't score at the top of their class are struggling to find well-paying jobs to make payments on law-school debts that can exceed $100,000. Some are taking temporary contract work, reviewing documents for as little as $20 an hour, without benefits. And many are blaming their law schools for failing to warn them about the dark side of the job market.<br>  <br>  The law degree that Scott Bullock gained in 2005 from Seton Hall University -- where he says he ranked in the top third of his class -- is a "waste," he says. Some former high-school friends are earning considerably more as plumbers and electricians than the $50,000-a-year Mr. Bullock is making as a personal-injury attorney in Manhattan. To boot, he is paying off $118,000 in law-school debt.<br>  <br>  A slack in demand appears to be part of the problem. The legal sector, after more than tripling in inflation-adjusted growth between 1970 and 1987, has grown at an average annual inflation-adjusted rate of 1.2% since 1988, or less than half as fast as the broader economy, according to Commerce Department data.<br>  <br>  On the supply end, more lawyers are entering the work force, thanks in part to the accreditation of new law schools and an influx of applicants after the dot-com implosion earlier this decade. In the 2005-06 academic year, 43,883 Juris Doctor degrees were awarded, up from 37,909 for 2001-02, according to the American Bar Association. Universities are starting up more law schools in part for prestige but also because they are money makers. Costs are low compared with other graduate schools and classrooms can be large. Since 1995, the number of ABA-accredited schools increased by 11%, to 196.<br>  <br>  According to the Internal Revenue Service, the inflation-adjusted average income of sole practitioners has been flat since the mid-1980s. A recent survey showed that out of nearly 600 lawyers at firms of 10 lawyers or fewer in Indiana, wages for the majority only kept pace with inflation or dropped in real terms over the past five years.<br>  <br>  Many students "simply cannot earn enough income after graduation to support the debt they incur," wrote Richard Matasar, dean of New York Law|`|6fiYhtACaa	Wouldn't it help a bit to go to law school?|`|q7SQ6Tgfaa	<a href="http://www.criminaldefenselawyer.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.criminaldefenselawyer.com/</a>|`|AA10481071	why do you want to be a criminal|`|gf5ysBCnaa	Befriend a criminal first and you will discover despite of them breaking laws they are still just as human as you.

H17L1WW4aa	if you are W2 I think its 25% of your gross income.  Since you started another job they wont know where you work until your first payroll check information is sent in.  Then they will have to file a garnishment with the new company.  Depending on best case scenario you are about 3 months out before sallie knows where you work, then another month for the garnishment.<br>  <br>  This is assuming they are on top of it.  If you have had 5 months of checks sallie should already know.  Then again the new company might be lax on doing this crap.  They might also be fighting the garnishment without you knowing.  Plus this company has to be served and sallie might not have any idea where to serve this company.
tIUfOJyHaa	It is always good to present a pre qual letter with an offer - even so this is  not a true " loan commitment". The pre qual letter just shows the seller that you as the buyer at least talked to a lender and that you might qualify for a mortgage if certain contingencies are met. One of those contingencies is that the property has to appraise to at least the purchase price and of course there are several other which need to be met before the lender will issue the final loan commitment. <br>  <br>  However I can understand your concern in regards ot a dollar amount written into the pre qual letter. You might want to talk to your lender and ask him to just write the pre qual letter without disclosing a loan amount. <br>  <br>  But since one of the contingencies in every pre qual letter is the appraisal (the property has to appraise to purchase price) - you might be save with the pre qual letter you have. This of course depending on the property and its current market value.

For example under NAFTA I believe Canada mentioned that it wanted to maintain control of its banking system as a specific request.<br>  <br>  Also I think Telecommunications was another industry withheld along with media.  The CRTC in Canada wanted to maintain that Canadian content would be played in Canada as opposed to just getting slammed by a whole slue of United States content.

Learn calligraphy so that you can provide handwritten invitations and thank you notes to prospective wedding parties, birthday celebrations, etc. Seek out clients through wedding planners at nearby churches and temples. A starter calligraphy kit usually runs around $20 and anyone can easily pick up this skill. The going rate is usually $1 per hand addressed item.<br>  <br>  2. Seek from your neighbors a gardner position which involves planting, weed removal, plant/tree trimming, light brush clearance. You will be using the neighbor's equipment and tools. Again, do not represent yourself as a lawn mower since there are any number of safety issues involved. A door-to-door solicitation of surrounding neighbors is required and you can charge between $6 to $9 per hour.<br>  <br>  3. Offer policing/removal or clearance of trash services to surrounding neighbors which involve trash pickup within nearby residential area. Limit the extent of pickup to small areas and be aware that there are no hazardous terrain or elements involved in this process. Again, a door-to-door solicitation of neighbors is in order. You can charge between $6.75 to $7.50 per hour.<br>  <br>  4. Acquire a set of window cleaning tools [a bucket, liquid window cleaner, sponge, squeegee, handle with an extension and a small step ladder] and solicit local businesses for your window cleaning services. However, be careful to limit the height of the window cleaning to no higher than one story. Charge $1 per window panel.<br>  <br>  5. Visit your nearest beauty salon and ask to be trained as a shampoo person who is also willing to sweep up fallen hair on the ground and do set ups [arranging dye kits, curler holders, etc.] for a set hourly fee.<br>  <br>  6. Become a sign flipper by contacting your nearest realtor. A flipper is someone who stands at a major intersection and flips a "For Lease/Rental" sign in order to attract visitors to an open house or to a particular real estate listing. The hourly pay is at least the minimum wage.<br>  <br>  7. Why not become a paid feeder servicing the disabled at nearby nursing, convalescent, assisted living/care centers and hospitals. It involves feeding food to patients who are unable to feed themselves. The starting rate is $8.00 per hour. The only downside is that one has to take precautions to wash one's hands after each feeding. A posting of your services [by a business card or flyer] on a reviewable bulletin board would be enough to generate customers. The paid feeder position is one of the fastest growing occupation at this time.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|VkvJJUtxaa	chick-fil-a|`|prAWOO1kaa	Any small business around you're town usually.|`|OeFNGqbzaa	probably a bagger|`|ycv1tk1gaa	Wendy's is a good one.
Dg8YdG4Jaa	No this is not normal. If you gave $1,800 for a service you should be able to contact someone for a status update. Just because you have not reached an agreement on the modification does not mean it won't happen. You do need to understand that the bank needs to protect itself if you are not paying your mortgage. The bank is not obligated to give you a modification or you may not qualify. In either case the bank has to continue with foreclosure proceedings because the alternative is to begin them after months of discovering you don't qualify. <br>  <br>  Did you send your check to anyone in particular? How much time have you spent calling? Once, twice, 5 times. I don't know what you make an hour but if you want to get your loan modified I would get my $ 1800 worth. You can deal directly with the bank and I would hound the loan modification company. They have to prove the work they have done or they are liable. Its a law that was passed about a year ago to protect against this.|`|rnfxNYx3aa	Jake has broken the rules so why would you trust him in any transaction?  <br>  <br>  Beware frauds as you seem to be dealing with one already.|`|806455f30adefbff1e3b1fbdc3ecc722aa	You have been ripped off.

Lenders now have a financial incentive to deal with you to save your home.<br>  <br>  Second, you need to report the loan mod rip-off artists to your local law enforcement agency. Call the police.
zHmZkMStaa	Very doubtful.  You'd have to pay for at least 30 full days of rent first before a landlord would consider giving you your deposit back.  Since you got dogs, the landlord can charge you about $200 against your deposit for pest control (flea removal)  (and yes; even if you claim that your dogs didn't have fleas, sorry.)|`|cLLP3GXQaa	NO, IF YOU HAD PETS AND THE CONTRACT STRICTLY SAID NO PETS THEN NOPE...YOU BROKE THE CONTRACT|`|yh2hr3Vfaa	No and the Landlord will probably sue you for the full term of the lease which is allot more than your security deposit.

Your goal should be to be a wise investor.  You don't want to risk too much on the stock market in either common stocks or mutual funds, but with a lot of good quality equity going for pennies it would be wise to seek the advice of a professional financial advisor and try to invest in some solid blue chip shares.  <br>  <br>  Although everyone is hurting right now, the solid companies will bounce back for the most part so owning shares in some solid and diverse mutual funds would be a great way to build wealth over the next 10 years or more.  Investing in the markets should be a long-term commitment so if you can afford to part with a small part of your cash, make it work for you that way.  However, don't tie-up too much because you still need your money to be liquid for emergencies and day to day expenses.  It is always wise to have up to 9 months of living expenses stored away in cash in the bank so keep that in mind at all times.  <br>  <br>  If the stock market doesn't inteest you and you know some serious and trustworthy people that are looking to invest in Real Estate you can always look into going in with a group and picking up a rental property (multiplex) or condo and either living in it or renting it out.  This will help pay off the mortgage using other people's money and later provide positive cash flow.  Real Estate may be too much of a headache for you right now but if you feel you're up to it, it's worth looking into.<br>  <br>  Start educating yourself on Tax Lien Certificates.  This involves paying off homeowner's delinquent property taxes to various counties in the US.  When the homeowner finally pays their late bill with interest, the county will pay you back what you invested with interest (the homeowner's late fee).  States like Arizona, Iowa, Florida and Texas offer high interest rates 8, 10, 16, 20% etc...Not all states offer Tax lien certificates so do your research and maybe this may interest you.  <br>  <br>  The Tax lien certificates are government issued and Real Estate collateralised.  This means that in the 1% of the time that the homeowner fails to ever pay the county in arrears, you can foreclose on the property (which is your collateral) and take it free and clear of the mortgage because the Tax Lien has prioroty over most other liens.  Foreclosure is rare and is a complicated and costly process so it shouldn't be your goal.  Just view Tax lien certificates as high interest paying CDs with a small element of risk.  You have to be careful that if you cover someone's property taxes, they will actually want to pay the county back.  Usually they do because nobody wants to lose their home over a few hundred or few thousand dollars, but if the plot of land has environmental damage, or the house is condemned, or it is simply a driveway or patch of grass you could end up losing your initial investment.  <br>  <br>  Even if you foreclose on that useless piece of land or damaged property you will have a tough time reselling it.  Environmental damage can be dangerous because you will be responsible for cleaning up the mess so be careful,   That being said more and more people are investing in Tax Lien Certificates because they are one of the oldest investment around, just not widely publicized or trendy the way stocks/mutual funds are.  All the big banks and wealthy invest in Tax Liens so gather all the info you can and maybe you can do extremely well because they are not subject to the volatilities of either the stock or Real Estate markets which normally experience ups and downs together and every 5-10 years or so.  Hope these 3 major options give you some ideas.  Bottom line...never gamble and never invest too much, and never too much in 1 place...Stay diverse and be wise!

OacSIfSiaa	First of all, see if the debt is within your states statute of limitations to seek legal action.  If the debt is too old (time barred) to seek legal action, then that would be your defense.<br>  <br>  Seeing as to how it is too late to seek validation of the debt if you have been served a summons to appear, you can go to the court and file a "sworn denial" which is basicaly a written document stating the following:  I deny that this is my debt and if it is my debt, I deny that it is still a valid debt and if it is a valid debt, I deny the amount sued for is the correct amount".<br>  <br>  You will need to find out from the court if your state allows for the filing of a sworn denial.  You must type it, (some courts have a blank form to file) sign it and have it notarized.  Then you file it with the clerk of the court, and have a copy sent to the collection lawyer. <br>  <br>  A Sworn denial is powerful in that the creditor can no longer rely on a Sworn Affidavit of Account.  They must now provide a live witness to testify about the debt and it must be someone from the original creditor.  It changes things a lot and many collection agencies can not provide a live withness, hence the case is tossed.<br>  <br>  Hope this is of some help to you.<br>  <br>  NOTE: This communication is not intended as and should not be interpreted as legal advice but is intended solely as a general discussion of legal principles or definitions of the FDCPA and FCRA.    Always consult an attorney if needed.|`|7QPv7ta7aa	If the debt is yours, the collection agency is likely to win.  Have you previously requested validation of the debt to include copies of contracts or other documentation that proves the debt is yours?  Often documentation gets lost in the file for older debts.  If the collection agency doesn't have the contracts, you might win.<br>  <br>  If the debt is beyond the Statute of Limitations (SOL), the timeframe to bring lawsuit, you can raise that issue as an affirmative defense in court.<br>  <br>  There are a lot of "credit" sites that claim all sorts of tricks but in reality, collection agencies are in the biz and know what they can and can't get away with.  You might want to consult an attorney, if the debt is large enough to justify the legal fees.|`|AA11280073	Pay your bills and you won't have to worry about collection  agencies.
H17L1WW4aa	You didnt mention which days were the weekend.  But lets say its this....<br>  <br>  They should be required to book the entire weekend, period.  So lets say the weekend is friday 11, sat 12, sun 13.  Those should be required plus one.<br>  <br>  so they can book 10,11,12,13 or 11, 12, 13, 14<br>  <br>  10 should only be given if not taken if the first scenario, 14 should only be booked on those that dont take the first option.  Basically you have booked 11, 12, 13 not matter what plus 1.  This gives you a 50/50 of open rooms on the 10th and the 14th since half will go early and half will go late.  Both have to pick 4 days.  So a 14 a 15 will be at a premium because its half booked.<br>  <br>  The 15th only will be standard price since its after the weekend.  Chances are most will book the thursday night but you should require a 3 night plus 1 or a 2 night plus 1.<br>  <br>  You can do the same thing saying only friday and saturday is required but do a plus 1..  they have to buy thursday or sunday to get the friday and saturday.

IKakoOfyaa	No, but closing the other two accounts potentially may hurt your credit.  An account closure, even if initiated by you, will lower your credit score.  If this is what you decide to do, leave the other accounts open and either don't use them or charge something small each month like a tank of gas and pay it off when the bill comes.  That will prevent the accounts from being closed due to lack of activity.  And, when you get that new card, don't run up any debts on it.

OacSIfSiaa	A big one! A collection under Running of Reporting Period - Section 605 [15 U.S.C. § 1681c] of the Fair Credit Reporting Act will remain on your credit report Seven years. The running of this time limit is the same as with charge-offs.

This includes debts that have been bought by a collection agency.

I would say 90% are scams and are utter crap. I personally make $3 to 4K a month online from my own websites. . I do not pay anything except for buying my own sites and hosting. <br>  <br>  If you are interested in making money the legit way, email me at "denisemkz@gmail.com" I offer FREE coaching for 1 whole month. I do not sell you anything in case you are wondering but you need $10 to 15 dollars for your own website. I will show you which one to use to get the most out of your effort. I do this to because I want to gather opinions for my membership site later on.<br>  <br>  Since last Jan, I have already had over 150 students. All earning at least $2k a month. Expect to earn about 400 to 500 the first month you do this. Please note: DO NOT EMAIL me if you are looking to push some magic button, you WILL have to work about 2 hours daily. I can only coach 20 students becoz I'm a full time student. First come first serve.

e952612e29a4b551731fb3c702e5e828aa	I will share how I make extra money at home (part time.) and is easy for anyone to do, no cost involved..<br>  (a) A very popular way is to have your own blog and or website, design it properly, post on it regularly etc and your website or blog will pay for itself sooner or later. This is a great form of extra income because the internet is open 24 hours a day and seven days a week and your website or blog is available worldwide...<br>  (b) This is the easiest way (for me) to make extra money, I make pocket change by doing things like "reading emails. I just click on a email link and wait for a timer to expire, close the link and move onto the next email. I spend about a 1/2 hour a night doing this...(c) Sell items on the Internet. I started out by selling extra items that I had at home, now I go to yard sales, flea markets, check out discount bins at stores, etc and resell them for a profit on the net. <br>  If you have any question about what I am going to share with you, please email me (just click on my "yahoo name)..Hopefully, you will find my answer helpful!!! I will post the sources that helped me out

Most townhouse projects will have a homeowners' association in order to administer rules and to share common expenses (like security or insurance or groundskeeping), but utilities are almost always billed individually.

lObEjUh1aa	It sounds like a degree of negligence on the property owner's part is proveable, so long as you have written documentation showing when you contacted the property owner, when they responded, & what corrective action (sounds like none?) they have taken.  This will depend largely on the laws of your locality & the terms of your lease.<br>  <br>  That being said, I would consider whether you can tolerate the silverfish for the rest of the month.  You may have a legal leg to stand on (only an attorney can offer qualified advice on this), but a court or arbitration battle is bound to cause elevated levels of stress and anxiety.  Something tells me that may be worse for your health (and your baby's) then the stress caused by living with bugs everywhere.<br>  <br>  I'm assuming that you are planning to move out at the end of the month (who would want to stay in a bugridden apartment managed by an unsympathetic property owner?).  The move will add more stress to your overall situation, possibly increasing the risk of pregnancy complications.  In your shoes, I think i'd be looking to eliminate as many causes of stress as possible.  Try to reach the best peace you can with the bugs for the rest of the month, then make your move-out as relatively stress free as you can.  If you are married, ask your husband to handle as much of the move-out process as possible.  Ask local friends or family for help as well.<br>  <br>  It sounds like you are in a terrible situation, & I sympathize.  Try to hang in there for the rest of the month, then kick the dirt off your feet when you leave & never look back at that place again.|`|AA10434862	unfortunately silverfish are like ants - they're everywhere.  you don't need to change your lifestyle, just spray in the areas where you see them with a safe household spray you can find at home depot.  they can come & go through wherever they please.  we have silverfish too - not a big deal - just have to deal with them since you're in an apartment building.  flip your landlord the bill or discount it off your rent - that'll get him/her to appreciate your problem.|`|AA10021585	Block the openings with minimal expanding foam.  You spray it in and it fills the cracks and hardens.<br>  <br>  Then sprinkle boric acid around.  It will kill the bugs, but is only as toxic as table salt.<br>  <br>  Both can be found in hardware stores.<br>  <br>  Also, keep the place as dry as possible.  Run your a/c or a de-humidifier.
lObEjUh1aa	I understand the cost of moving is high, but you have to compare it to the cost of staying.  It sounds as if your property owner's commitment to maintenance is zero.  This means the property value (& your quality of life) will keep declining over time.<br>  <br>  Of particular concern is the leak in your A/C.  I don't have expertise about the health effects of long term exposure to industrial refrigerants, but I'm sure they aren't doing you any good.<br>  <br>  If you must stay, get a lease.  You will pay significantly higher rental rates if you go month-to-month.  Properly maintained properties will be available at lower rates.<br>  <br>  Inconvenient and expensive as it is, I would move out of there asap.  Moving only hurts once.  Continual maintenance problems will just keep hurting month after month.|`|9504acb1471e54df34c70529056f0206aa	You need to call your local Housing Athority and turn him in.

I'm not an expert but I've been told that where I live if there are problems with the place we are renting and they are causing serious issues as is your plumbing problems, you can with hold your rent until they fix it. Granted you need to provide written proof that you've notified them, no phone calls but certified mail letters that they have to sign and you hold the receipt on.<br>  <br>  I would Google your state and the term "renters rights" to see what comes up. Just because you don't own the house doesn't mean that they can't keep it up to standards. I really do hope you find a resolution!|`|HvWwjnLFaa	sounds like you got one of the slum lords which has been outlawed in our state.|`|AA10091004	Call code enforcement, a realtor can provide you with the correct number to call. Prepare a list of repairs, and have it notarized and send it registered mail. Tell the owner you wish to stay but need repairs done right away. Their responsibility is to provide you with safe, comfortable shelter. You are paying them for a service, after all. Don't be afraid of them. They cannot evict you for demanding repairs. All states have different laws. The realtor should have basic knowledge of landlord / tenant laws.

Os Estados possuem 2 governadores, 1 eleito pelo povo e outro nomeado pela rainha da Inglaterra. Muitas leis s?o baseadas nas leis inglesas e, n?o diferente, o processo de vistos de trabalho / turismo etc.<br>  Trabalhar na Austrália é muito bom, mas n?o pense que é t?o fácil. Por ser um continente novo e um pouco isolado, muitos habitantes de lá procuram oportunidades em outros países (continente Americano e Asiático s?o os preferidos). Este processo todo gera carência de m?o-de-obra em vários setores. Por este motivo, o governo oferece inúmeros incentivos: auxílio moradia, auxílio / seguro saúde, conta em banco, crédito, hospedagem etc.<br>  Em um primeiro momento parece um sonho, mas para conquistar tudo isso é preciso convencer o consulado de que você quer ir para a Austrália para fazer o país crescer, oferecer seus conhecimentos e aprender os deles. Deve apresentar dados muito consistentes (residência fixa, família no Brasil, Bom currículo e, é claro, inglês fluente).<br>  Depois de tudo isso, entrando na Austrália.. ai vem a rala??o. Os salários s?o tabelados. Você raramente econtra um publicitário que ganha 1,000 e um outro na mesma fun??o em outra empresa que ganha 4,000. As diferen?as s?o no máximo de 100 dólares australianos.<br>  Um programador e desenvolvedor web ganha em média 500 dólares australianos e o custo de vida lá é um pouco caro. Comida e lazer s?o caros, porém você pode montar sua casa com equipamentos de primeiro mundo, de segunda m?o, vendidos em "vendas de garagem". é uma prática muito frequente lá.

9ff60ac9f9d64bf7201944b6105d0b55aa	Con artists make money through deception. They lie, cheat and fool people into thinking they've happened onto a great deal or some easy money, when they're the ones who'll be making money. If that doesn't work, they'll take advantage of our weaknesses -- loneliness, insecurity, poor health or simple ignorance. The only thing more important to a con artist than perfecting a con is perfecting a total lack of conscience. <br>  What does the average con artist look like? Despite what you may think, he isn't always a shady-looking character. A con artist is an expert at looking however he needs to look. If the con involves banking or investments, the con artist will wear a snappy suit. If it involves home improvement scams, he'll show up wearing well-worn work clothes. Even the basic assumption that the con is a "he" is incorrect: there are plenty of con women too. <br>  <br>  You might think you can spot a con artist because he's someone you instinctively "don't trust." But the term con artist is short for confidence artist -- they gain your confidence just long enough to get their hands on your money. They can be very charming and persuasive. A good con artist can even make you believe he is really an old friend you haven't seen in years. <br>  <br>  Con artists do share certain characteristics, however. Even the best con can only go on for so long before people start getting suspicious. For that reason, con artists tend to move frequently. They may have a job that allows this, or they might claim to have such a job. Railroad worker, carnival worker and traveling salesman are all parts con artists play to cover up their constant relocations. <br>  <br>  A Con's a Con<br>  Different terms for con artists include: flim flam man, sham artist, shyster or sheister, bunco man (after the name of a popular "fixed" card game that has since become synonymous with scams), bamboozler, swindler, grifter and hustler.  <br>  <br>  <br>  It would be impossible to catalogue every con, because con artists are inventive. While many cons are simply variations on ones that are hundreds of years old, new technologies and laws give con artists the opportunity to create original scams. Many cons tend to fall into a few general categories, however: street cons, business cons, Internet cons, loan cons and home improvement cons. <br>  <br>  Street Cons<br>  These are cons that usually happen quickly in a public place. They generally involve the loss of small amounts of money -- a few hundred dollars is a good take for a street con. The victim is usually approached by a stranger who has an offer, makes a bet, or is reacting to something seemingly random and unrelated that has happened nearby. This "random" event is, of course, something the con artist set up well ahead of time. <br>  <br>  Street cons include: <br>  <br>  The Pedigree Dog <br>  A stranger walks into a bar with a dog trailing him on a leash. He asks if the owner can watch his dog for a few minutes while he places a bet or attends to a business deal. While the stranger is gone, a second con artist arrives and notices the dog. He claims to be an expert on dog breeding, and says that this dog is worth hundreds, if not thousands of dollars. He asks the owner if the dog is for sale because he'll pay top dollar. The entire scam hinges on the bar owner's greed. The assumption is he'll see the chance to buy the dog from the unsuspecting owner for a low price, then sell the valuable dog to this "expert breeder." He tells the dog expert to come back later, then offers to buy the dog when its owner returns. The dog's owner sells it, but the "expert" never comes back to buy it. The two con artists walk away with a few hundred dollars, and the bar owner gets stuck with a "mutt." In Neil Gaiman's novel "American Gods," two characters discuss this con using a violin instead of a dog. <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  The Pigeon Drop <br>  There are several variations of this con, but they all start with the victim and the con artist both spotting something of value lying around. It's usually an envelope or bag full of money, but it could be a diamond ring. The con artist tries to get the victim to notice the envelope first, making him less likely to suspect that the con artist planted it. A second con artist may get involved as the victim and the first con artist decide to split up the found money, demanding a fair share since he saw it too. <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  <br>  At this point, the cons will suggest that everyone put some of their own money into the envelope as "good faith money," to show that they're financially responsible people. Once all of the money is in the envelope, it is divided into thirds and returned to the victim and the two con artists. However, through sleight of hand and a distraction, the victim gets an envelope full of paper scraps. <br>  <br>  In the ring variation, the con artist claims to have some expertise in jewelry assessment, and proclaims the ring to be worth several hundred dollars or more. However, not having time to sell or pawn the ring, the con artist offers to let the victim buy out his half. So the victim pays what he can to the con artist and keeps the "valuable" ring, which is actually a cheap fake. The victim, or "pigeon," is "dropped" and left with nothing. <br>  <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Three-card Monte <br>  In this famous street con, a con artist has a table with three cards in front of her. One card is flipped over to reveal that it is the Ace of Spades (or any other card). The victim places a bet that he can keep an eye on that card while the con artist quickly rearranges the cards on the table. If the correct card is picked, the victim wins. Friends of the con artist play the game, sometimes winning, sometimes losing, to give the victim the impression that it is a fair game he might win if he has a sharp eye. In reality, the con artist is a master of sleight of hand, able to switch cards without the victim noticing. No matter how carefully he watches, the victim will never pick the right card unless the con artist wants him to. Variations include the use of shells (a "shell game" is sometimes used to mean any kind of deceptive scam) or cups with the victim trying to spot a quarter, a pea or a ball held within one of the shells.|`|4045eeb32c4ef2d7acd08239fb1eff37aa	They exploit people by getting them when they are vulnerable or emotionaly unstable.

Then maybe "fairness" depends on whether it's part of your job to chase the customers for payment subsequent to the deal (in which case 50% might be fair), or if it's someone else's job to collect payment (in which case you've already done your job).  Also, not fair for your employer to go out of pocket to pay you the commission if there's a chance they'll never receive payment.

Let your kids learn a very important lesson in discipline and help them apply for loans, grants and scholarships. 529 plans are only a good idea if you've taken care of your retirement already. If you haven't maxed out your 401k or Roth IRA options yet, you should. There aren't any retirement scholarships or grants! Your kids will be able to eventually pay off any loans they take. If you have no retirement saved up, you won't be able to pay off any loans you take for their college bills, and when you pass on, they will get stuck with the bill anyway. <br>  <br>  Not to sound selfish, but it's just the most logical decision.

If you did have it inspected, and your inspector missed stuff, you can hold the inspector liable for repairs.|`|N2RnIHiVaa	No there isn't - but here are a few things you can still do.<br>  <br>  If it is an older home - you had to have written very specific repairs into the paperwork that the previous owners were responsible for.  That is why MOST people have the home inspected as a condition of the sale - if it doesn't pass the inspection or if there are a lot of "red flags" you are not required to complete the sales contract.  If there isn't anything in your paperwork - you are responsible for the repairs on your own.<br>  <br>  If it is a brand new home - it should still be under warranty for at least 6 months.  It really depends on what is wrong with it.  If there are already cracks in the walls then it is an issue with the builder - I would discuss it with your agent that you bought the home through.  Same if it is a plumbing problem or electrical problem.  <br>  <br>  If it has to do with an appliance (stove, fridge, water heater, AC) all of those items have individual manufacturer warrantees.  Talk direclty with them.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!
tdiyhf68aa	depends if you want revenge, or just want things fixed? fixed.... get the other 3 tenants together and serve him.... a notice of defects....w/ the treat of with-holding the rent,until things are fixed. then you have to pay him all his rent, including back rent.<br>   this will protect you from being throw out. this is the short story. the how to's.....go buy a book called Tenants Rights for your state, at the book store<br>  not online! step by step, easy to understand language.......|`|a3da2017716e2d64915a498281b1e5deaa	Has anyone else heard him make these comments?  are they in writing?  If not, then its he said she said.  You have no proof he said these things.  Only if you have proof (paper, witnesses) can you file harrassment charges against him.<br>  Make sure all your complaints are in writing and witnessed by a non family member. Preferably another tenant. Then send him the letter (keep your copy).  Paper trail is the key to this.  If he tries to evict you and has made no repairs, then you can go to court and state that he is evicting you for no cause other than requesting repairs that he obviously dont want to do.<br>  If this does go to court, be prepared to move, because even if he gets fined, he will still be the landlord and will find something to get you with. He can make your life hell by siting any little infraction, find an inspection problem against you, etc.  I would be looking elsewhere for an apt.<br>  Landlords like this make us good ones look bad. Sorry for your trouble.|`|eaP6U4y0aa	i believe you have the total right to take him to court for harassment i believe let me see real quick...YOU do and do exactly like the guy said below me and then find a lawer in your area they will love to take the case because they would totally win!!!|`|AA10467187	I'm sure he will never admit to this. What you do is take a small voice recorder with you (one that you can conceal yet still pick up his voice) and make another complaint. I would even bring up what you already complained about. He will probably act more stupid than he did the last time. Make sure you use his name while recording.<br>  Then, get a lawyer - you've got the threats and a legit case
0b6a417126e4e095cb0ff211401dc89baa	Make a list of everything you need to pay for:  rent, electricity, gas, car payment, cable, insurance, food, cleaning products, laundry, everything.  If you buy coffee every morning, add it to the list.  Then look at the bank and credit card statements to see how much you have to pay per month.  If you pay insurance or a water bill once or twice a year figure out the annual total and divide by 12.  Make sure to put enough away for the bills that aren't payable every month.  For clothes and that sort of thing look at your statements for the past year, get the total and then divide by 12.  You may find that you spend more than you have coming in.  Then you need to cut down on things that aren't essential, like buying coffee in the morning.  You should plan to put money into savings, ten percent is a good figure to shoot for.|`|ZmRDnPFFaa	A fairly easy way is to look at your checking account activity, your credit card activity, and any other sources of money.  Look at what the money is being spent on, and decide how much you want to spend for each item.  You can use cash withdrawals from your checking account and credit cards as a way to estimate what you're spending on coffee, magazines, snacks and other smaller items.  There's no magic formula for how much to spend on any particular item--you have to decide for yourself what will work for you.  The key is to get your total spending below your income.  Make sure to save something first--contributions to retirement accounts should be made automatically from your paycheck.<br>  <br>  For more information, see the webpages listed below.

They will want to see your business plan but it will not be that large of a determining factor. The better place to go would be a credit union or a business development bank. They will take into account your credit score but the merit of your business plan will be more important. That is how we got all our loans.
uw3J8M0waa	Here is a short list of  jobs which you can create to generate income:<br>  <br>  1.  Learn calligraphy so that you can provide handwritten invitations and thank you notes to prospective wedding parties, birthday celebrations, etc.  Seek out clients through wedding planners at nearby churches and temples.  A starter calligraphy kit usually runs around $20 and anyone can easily pick up this skill.  The going rate is usually $1 per hand addressed item.<br>  <br>  2.  Become a "poser" who assists wedding photographers in setting and arranging various individuals in group and single photographic positions.  "Posers" carry around a sketch book of various sitting and standing poses which consists of onion skin overlays of various wedding pictures bound in albums.  Again, contact  local wedding photographers and wedding planners, accordingly.  The hourly pay is around $10-$12 per hour and you are often invited to attend all dining activities.<br>  <br>  3.  Seek from your neighbors a gardner position which involves planting, weed removal, plant/tree trimming, light brush clearance.  You will be using the neighbor's equipment and tools.  Again, do not represent yourself as a lawn mower since there are any number of safety issues involved.  A door-to-door solicitation of surrounding neighbors is required and you can charge between $6 to $9 per hour.<br>  <br>  4.  Offer policing/removal or clearance of trash services to surrounding neighbors which involve trash pickup within nearby residential area.  Limit the extent of pickup to small areas and be aware that there are no hazardous terrain or elements involved in this process.  Again, a door-to-door solicitation of neighbors is in order.  You can charge between $6.75 to $7.50 per hour.<br>  <br>  5.  Acquire a set of window cleaning tools [a bucket, liquid window cleaner, sponge, squeegee, handle with an extension and a small step ladder] and solicit local businesses for your window cleaning services.  However, be careful to limit the height of the window cleaning to no higher than one story.  Charge $1 per window panel.<br>  <br>  6.  Become a proxy/stand-in for neighbors to allow delivery of goods and packages to your home/apartment.  Acquire the authority to sign any receipt of  incoming packages as an accepting neighbor.  Charge $1 per each package handled by you.<br>  <br>  7.  Consider becoming a restaurant-cafe customer liaison by using your cell phone at restaurants-cafes to coordinate with the hostess to keep track of waiting customers.  Whenever there's a very long period of time to activate a waiting list, you want to offer the restaurant your services so that customers do not have to stand around for any lengthy period of time.  And when their name/assigned number comes up; you can call the upcoming customer's cell phone to tell them that they can return to the restaurant and be served.  The call back fee is usually around $0.50 cents on a per head basis.   For example, a couple would be charged $1.00 while children under 6 would not be charged.  Placement of a plaque which outlines your fee schedule near the hostess station is sufficient to garner attention of prospective customers who will value your services since they can do other activities outside of the restaurant -- often beyond the range of any inhouse paging system.  You realize that everyone has a cellphone and why not take advantage of  the connectivity to make the diner's experience worthwhile.  The restaurant will also appreciate the added service you are providing as a customer liaison.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|5JpoJO4uaa	work.....get a summer job!  a job that you think will best develop a new person in you!|`|EZ6IqXU4aa	summer job.<br>  <br>  More likely a camp counselor type job if old enough and that way;<br>  <br>  1) have a job<br>  <br>  2) make some money<br>  <br>  3) be outside and be active during the summer|`|py6lQgGAaa	working at summer camp i work there if ur good with kids its easy money your just really tired at the end of the day

Là où ?a varie c'est que moi je suis stagiaire et je "gagne" 400€ par mois alors certes, c'est pas agréable de se dire qu'on est "payé" à rien foutre, mais quand il n'y a vraiment rien à faire, on fait comme on peut pour s'occuper, et pour moi c'est sans scrupule, parce que dans 3 mois je serai sans doute au ch?mage car le système de merde dans lequel on est n'oblige malheureusement pas les entreprises à embaucher les stagiaires, même en cdd, après 6 longs mois d'exploitation.

Je comprends la colère de certains, la surprise, etc... il est clair qu'il y d'énormes disparités entre les métiers que les fran?ais exercent. Mais il ne faut pas critiquer les bureaucrates tout ?a parce qu'ils "se la coulent plus douce" que sur un chantier ou que dans la restauration. Chacun son boulot, et sans les bureau, il n'y aurait pas le reste.<br>  Reste que je travaille en vacataire chaque été à la DDE, le summun de l'Administration !!! Et c'est LA caricature de l'administration !!!! pause café toutes les deux heures, 10 collègues dans un bureau à papoter.... J'adore observer de loin toute cette fourmillière. MAIS, à c?té de ceux-là, certains bossent pour de vrai !!!! et font largement leurs 45h par semaines ! Ce n'est pas une question de métier, mais une question de PERSONALITE et d'INVESTISSEMENT.<br>  Après, c'est s?r que la grande grande majorité des fran?ais n'aiment pas leur boulot, alors forcément.... on boit le café, on va sur internet, on ne décroche plus le téléphone, on appelle les copines, on lit le journal..... et on meurt de chaud dans les bureaux !<br>  Ah oui, aussi, au mois d'ao?t, étant donné que la plus part des collègue sont en congés, c'set difficile d'avancer dans les dossiers quand il manque les 3/4 de la paperasse, censée être fournie par les autres services.....|`|ed127a7d6331335516b61f4cc0859adfaa	En faisant son boulot!|`|sLIkwA1Yaa	Pendant l'été ?

c1VO3mU8aa	Vorrei fare i complimenti a Luca per la risposta, e a completamento di quanto già detto vorrei aggiungere che tante società private e non, che gestiscono l'acqua, fanno pagare alla posa del contatore una cauzione, questa somma e spesso data anche per il pagamento dello stesso contatore, e viene restituita nel momento in cui disdici il contratto, perchè viene poi fatta ripagare al nuovo proprietario, quindi il "signore" in questione, se così fosse, non ha diritto a chiederti un bel niente.|`|VQmRwQrYaa	Ciao, deduco che con il termine "signore" tu indichi un privato, cioè non una impresa  costruttrice. <br>  Certamente il contatore dell'acqua è suo, e a suo tempo gliel'avranno fatto pagare, ma solo perchè il contatore non c'era ed ha dovuto provvedere lui a farlo installare. <br>  Oggi lui vende a te l'immobile, a corpo e non a misura nello stato di fatto e di diritto in cui attualmente si trova, come visto e gradito, con ogni diritto accessorio, accessione, pertinenza, IMPIANTO FISSO E SEMIFISSO,  servitù attive e passive, nulla escluso ed eccettuato. <br>  Il contatore è senz'altro parte dell'impianto, è necessario per il suo funzionamento, e se quando hai visto l'immobile (come visto e gradito) il contatore c'era e non è stato specificato che questa spesa era da sostenere a parte, il contatore è da intendersi facente parte della casa, il suo costo è da considerarsi  compreso nel prezzo pattuito per l'immobile. <br>  Quindi a mio parere tu non devi pagare assolutamente nulla di più di ciò che avevate già pattuito per il prezzo dell'immobile. <br>  Resto a disposizione per ulteriori chiarimenti.|`|61ff2c29fd195d64626009270239e2d2aa	Dovresti fare questa domanda  ad una Agenzia Immobiliare a titolo di curiosita' , loro senzaltro lo sanno

Then getting her fired should be fairly easy.<br>  <br>  I would NOT directly tell your boss anything about her.<br>  <br>  I hope this doesn’t sound too vial or too shallow, but if you are even half as attractive as the woman at the gym I go to, all you really need to do is find a guy, or a girl if she's like that, and work your womanly wilds to convince them how rotten this chick is.  Then, ask them to go to your boss and tell them that they overheard this girl talking on the phone to someone about 'juicing' <steroids> and how they could get them. Then have this person express their dissatisfaction with a gym that permits and apparently condones that kind of activity. Then have them warn the boss that the next time they hear anything like that, they will be notifying the authorities. You could have a 'friend' do this, but it would look better if it was someone you weren't particularly close to. <br>  <br>  If that doesn’t work, wait 10 to 12 days, then have a friend who does NOT go to the gym call the gym when your boss (or another coworker) will answer the phone. Have them ask for the witch you want fired by name and add a line about the "good stuff".  For instance. If the girls name is Sue, have your friend call and ask, "Hi! Is Sue there? She is the one that can order the... um...'Good' supplements right?" (make sure they call from a pay phone!!) Don’t you say anything to ANYONE about this.  Then a day or two later, NO SOONER, go to your boss about the 'good supplement' he 's letting this girl sell. Tell him you got a call asking for her and when she wasn't available you were asked if you sold them too. <br>  <br>  She'll be gone!  Unless you mess up and they find out you are behind it.  Then you will be gone, so BE CAREFUL.<br>  <br>  Your only other choice is to be extremely rotten to her. Put stuff in her drinks to make her sick, like belching powder or a laxative in her food that will have her running to the toilet or any number of other nasty little things to make her get the point she's not wanted. <br>  <br>  Have fun and I hope this helps!|`|PBhtG82qaa	depends what job u have

If you feel uneasy about calling, do it this way...<br>  <br>  When you reach him, tell him that you had some problems with your phone lately and you didn't want to miss his call. <br>  <br>  You really don't need to feel like you're too pushy. You have every right to call and find out what the current status of the job is. My wife went through the same problem when she was being considered for the job.<br>  <br>  There are many factors that could have delayed them from calling you. But if you don't call, you'll never find out.<br>  <br>  One thing I learned is that even though the guy in the dept. wants you, he still has to run it by HR and they are the one's that usually take the longest time.<br>  <br>  Be patient and good luck.|`|SmrRX2Zcaa	Why don't you show some initiative and call back?

Lp1AZ2Lwaa	Try looking at Tech schools.  You can finish an Associates Degree in under 2 years, and it can be reasonably cheap.  With an associates in something related to computers (computer programing, graphic design, etc.) you can probably make 50K+ with a few years experience (maybe 30-40k+ starting).<br>  <br>  Tech schools are a little different than normal colleges.  They are less scholarly and more applied -- meaning you will learn how to do a profession with direct, hands on experience.  The schools offer a wide variety of degrees, so I'm sure you could find something your interested in.<br>  <br>  Good Luck. |`|Sozc3MyFaa	There are very few medical jobs that only require 1- 1.5 years training max.  Most require at least an associates degree.  Probably the best is attending a vocational school for LVN.  Other options include Lab technicians (assist the lab technologists); physical therapy assistants, maybe some x ray techs, ultrasound techs etc.  You would have to contact a vocational school and a community college & see what they offer (for example Trade Tech in LA; any of the community colleges in LA or OC). The less schooling, the less the salary however.
D5MCSqPwaa	Breaking into a career in Broadcasting can be about as tough as breaking into any career without experience, armed with only a degree and no connection to make that magic phone call. Here are a few suggestions that will get your career in Broadcasting started!<br>  <br>  <br>  1. YouTube<br>  <br>  YouTube is an excellent way to spice up your resume with video. Video is an excellent way in order to stand out among the crowd when it comes to your career. I would suggest looking for career oriented sites that allow for free video posting in addition to YouTube. Also, be sure to post a professional and compelling video as there are many people who may be hurting and not helping their careers by posting video resumes online.<br>  <br>  2. Internships<br>  <br>  Internships can help fill in that lack of experience on your resume as well as help you gain great contacts and maybe even a job with the company you intern with. Most companies will be flexible schedule wise as well as rewarding if you can do an unpaid or low paid internship. Radio stations are a good source but here are a few additional Broadcasting Intership Opportunities.<br>  <br>  CBS News Internship Program<br>  <br>  IHS Production Internships<br>  <br>  Arizona State Legislature<br>  <br>  Radio-Television News Directors Association<br>  <br>  National Association of Broadcasters<br>  <br>  Colleges & Universities are an excellent resource even if you didn't attend because of the public information they provide.<br>  <br>  Washington and Lee University<br>  <br>  State University of New York at Albany<br>  <br>  UC Berkeley<br>  <br>  3. Passionate Cover Letter<br>  <br>  A compelling story in your cover letter including a link to your YouTube Video enforcing the same mantra will allow you to stand out among other candidates.<br>  <br>  4. An Innovative Job Search<br>  <br>  Traditional job search engines may not be the best way to go when looking for a non traditional entry point. You may have to be more creative here due to your lack of experience. Not to fear because there are many companies out there looking for you but you have to think like they do. The companies looking for you aren't spending a lot of money on recruitment for a entry level candidate. Job Search Engines and free Classifieds like Craigslist is going to be excellent resources for your search.<br>  <br>  5. Network<br>  <br>  Trust me, everyone else understands your pain on this one. Networking is not easy but something simple as free business cards from VistaPrint are a cheap alternative to spicing up your networking efforts. Distribute them liberally and watch for local networking opportunities.|`|PxMTmtLqaa	Get a job as a  teacher.

If a boss understands this and is willing to show he does, he will have good employees, as well.|`|TtQkWefsaa	1. Competence.  If the boss is a lousy worker, employees won't respect him.  He has to lead by example.  <br>  <br>  2. Honesty.  There's nothing worse than a boss who doesn't keep his word.  If he says he's going to do something, he does it.  That way employees can rely on him, and the whole workplace is a stable environment.  The other part of honesty is that it allows employees to receive recognition for their efforts.  Some bosses like to take credit for everything they can.  That hurts everyone in the end, because nobody will work hard if they know someone's going to steal their thunder.<br>  <br>  3. Coolness.  No, I don't mean that in terms of fashion.  I mean cool as in keeping employees at a bit of a distance.  He always has to treat people well, but a good boss is your boss, not your best friend.  If a boss is overly chummy, his employees will treat him like a doormat.   <br>  <br>  4. Communication.  A boss has to be organized and always know what's going on in the workplace.  Surprises should be kept to a minimum.  Employees have to know what's expected of them, and how they're performing.<br>  <br>  5. Motivation.  This usually comes from the example he sets -- few things are more annoying than a boss who blows a lot of hot air down people's necks.  But establishing a good working environment is a key part of his job.<br>  <br>  6. Compassion.  He can't be soft and his expectations should be high, but if one of his employees is sick or is dealing with a family tragedy, he has to treat them with compassion and understanding.
GogKM4u1aa	Ask for a meeting but it should not be a confrontational meeting.  It is a meeting in order to make the working environment a harmonious one.  This will help the company to be more progressive.  If the conflict is between a co-worker of same level, this is easier because the supervisor or manager can be the mediator.  During the meeting, once the supervisor/mgr gives you the floor, speak your mind.  It's better if you have listed down what you want to bring up.  Speak clearly and with respect.  When it's time for the other party to speak, you listen intently and don't interrupt.  I'm sure, the conflict will be resolved.  Usually, the problem lies on lack of proper communication.  Always, things like this are resolved.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, if the conflict is between you and your supervisor, you can request a one-on-one meeting with him/her.  Tell him/her in the most respectful way your problem about him/her.  Never be confrontational.  Inform him/her that it's affecting your job if the problem is not resolved.  This kind of scenario usually ends up with a positive result.  However, if it doesn't work out, you can bring it up to the direct superior of your supervisor.|`|AA11409885	we had a conference and laid it all out on the table!

I had already began the process of registering the companies name and other paper works, but i paulsed for a while to go a little further with my studies, because and an engineer the first few years are very important in my present situation, it will help me to know what to focus on in the classroom, I hav a direction and honey i want you to know it will give you an edge over others as an uncommon zeal will be evident in your life. <br>  What major to take? I will advice you follow your heart but even when doing that ensure you will be comfortable to a degree in that profession in case you get stocked at doing that for much longer than your actual desire comes true. I speak this way because it is a two dimensional issue the business could do well or go bad and in the situation it goes bad, you have something to fall back to which will earn you good cash. Dont worry about the course to take right now, the school system ususally have a counselor which you could meet to sort that out, just take it one step at a time.<br>  <br>  I will always advice if you have the chance to open a business in a big city you should because business involves money and profit to a high degree, where there are much people you'll have much profit. Coming down to your kid of business a big city will do the trick where you'll always have new people coming in and going out. A small city will also be ok if you are the major source and that product or kind of package then everyone will come to you. You know in the generation thats not possible, so sweety come to the big jungle so long you have the cash or papers to get a nice location, that is one thing you did not ask. In business location counts alot. It take your business from just being one of tghe businesses to THE PLACE THE BIG CATS go to if you know what i mean.<br>  <br>  Finally, If you don't have a supporting spouse running a business could really suck. By the way are you married? If you are not then when checking out guys, make sure he has the spirit of a business of a business man. It will make him to work with you and even make your kids love business too.<br>  <br>  Cheers sweety

Don't put more than one of the same thing up at the same time, that way people may think supplys are limited and they should buy. Besides selling duplicate items means your competing with not only yourself but other eBayer's as well. And most importantly, find a niche. Are there 500 other eBay stores doing what your doing?

6eaWRGaqaa	I would consider myself pretty affluent. I, myself, am not wealthy though.<br>  <br>  My father owns 9 student-loan companies (largest is worth $400m in netprice) and 1 pre-need company (is currently worth $200m in netprice). Via trust fund arrangements I earn around $4m a year. My father earns $15,000,000 +. In 2002, his peak, he was earning $20,000,000+.<br>  <br>  He is a self-made man though, who grew up living on the streets of Harlem, NY. He lived in "public housing" until he was 15 years old. He actually made terrible marks until Sophomore year of high school where he began getting straight A's (all it took was one teacher to believe in him) and then he was able to get a full Merrot Scholarship to Penn. There he founded the Penn-in-Washington program and triple majored in Political Science and two others I can't remember (haha). Yep... that's pretty much it. It's a true story too.<br>  <br>  That is how i got to where I am now. The day I turn 25 years old, I am set for life.<br>  <br>  -Catherine|`|e452d3aad6458def58cc0987764f691aaa	Rich in what? lol i know you meant mony but it was bound to hapen. <br>  <br>  no im dirt pour. |`|gIcg7Ug2aa	That depends on what you consider to be Rich.  If I had another dollar, I really wouldn't know what to do with it.  I arrived at this position by being frugal and smart with my money.  I try not to waste, as I see many others doing.  I remember to save every pay day and, I save for things I want to buy and, pay cash.

fB12eqsWaa	I'm no claims expert, but if you own the leasehold (not renting) this sounds very harsh to me.<br>  <br>  Most UK contents policies cover 'fixed glass and bathroom fittings' (might want to check yours) a hob seems to at least arguably fit the definition of 'fixed glass'. Treating Customers Fairly (TCF) rules in the UK are very strong a company has to do the 'right' thing.... they can't hide behind iffy definitions !<br>  <br>  I think this has to be worth an argue. I have a horrible feeling that any accidental cover on the 'buildings' cover will probably only relate to common areas.<br>  <br>  Best advice I can give is to re-post this in the UK insurance section, there are a couple of cracking experts there.... might even be worth drawing your question to the attention of a certain 'vestonpants'... you can find him in the Insurance top answerer's list.<br>  <br>  He's a claims expert and a bloody nice bloke to boot, though obviously he only does this out of the goodness of his heart... it's not his job to answer.<br>  <br>  I think you're being given the run-around... if you get really stuck... drop me a line and I'll ask around professionally for you to get a better idea.|`|e9c3e42d64ceb58add3e61412e049096aa	You posted this to a USA board, so you get a USA answer.  <br>  <br>  Contents on a renters policy can include coverage for built-ins, if YOU added the built-in.  BUT, on most policies, they are on a named perils basis.  Of course, falling objects is a named peril, but usually it has to damage the outside of the building first.<br>  <br>  If you didn't add coverage for your built-ins, it's not covered.  <br>  <br>  Likely, the damage is going to be under the deductible for the freeholder.  Even if it IS covered, his insurance company can come after you, because YOU are the one that damaged it.  <br>  <br>  Your point - you can't.  You just have to be more careful.<br>  <br>  
uII7EwZkaa	I think this should be the question of the year! :)<br>  <br>  If someone would know the answer for this would the market be in a very good position.<br>  <br>  My answer for that will be, dont buy now! even if you dont want to wait until 2009 December will be a better time than Nov. (like all years).<br>  <br>  If you got the balls for gambling i would suggest to be waiting until around June 09, but if u realy need the house Dec. is my month.<br>  <br>  Good luck anyways<br>  |`|eiJOdPgxaa	Try cheeky low offers - sold one Friday - was on at 148,000 - owner took 120,000!!|`|fda66a3825ca9cdd945fd0f771540bddaa	A lot of cheeky offers are being accepted (I know, having accepted one!)  However, bear in mind that the reason for that is that the market is still going down, so what's a cheeky offer today will be a generous offer in six months time - at which point, a cheeky offer will be even lower!<br>  <br>  If you don't absolutely have to buy now, then I would wait - probably until next summer at the earliest.  I don't think the market will bottom out before then.|`|fESDWigDaa	It is a great time to buy a house right now. The interest rates are low and it is a buyers market. We will only know the best time to buy a home long after that time is past<br>  <br>  The most important considerations when you think about owning a house--as a place to live--are personal. I am talking about things such as the idea of not paying rent any more.<br>  <br>  I think that the most important thing of all is finding the right home. If you only think in terms of timing the market, you might miss the best moment but the worst thing is that you may miss the perfect house for you. The best time for most people to buy is when the right home becomes available.<br>  <br>  The only economic uncertainty that is important to you is your income stream. How is your job security? As a buyer, remember that you are just going to borrow money. The lender is accepting the risk that you will not pay the money back. Once the loan is made the mortgage could be sold but there will always be someone out there to collect your payments and none of the terms of your mortgage loan can be changed.<br>  <br>  Low offers will stand their best chance of being accepted right now but it always depends on the local market. It is worth trying and if you can't get it accepted you can always up your offer. The best strategy is to make an offer and then hang tough if the low price is your main objective.|`|8b35d4575aa79331213dbd54f2766d31aa	look i say you should wait just a little bit further. let me tell you why... as an example. my dad was planning to buy the house next to ours because he wanted to rent it. it's a small property...like super small. a one bedroom house with one restroom, a small kitchen, and a small living room, and very small garage..they put it on the market for $300,000! (serious) and now it's down to $180,000. but they say the property values of a home are going to keep going further down. i say you wait just a lil bit more and look to see if the houses have gone down everyday so you can decide when it's the right time to purchase a home!|`|X1ygowVQaa	Now is a very scary time in the economy for all and none of us really know what is going to happen. Especially all the craziness with the banks and mortgages. If you can afford to buy a house (and i mean buy it outright) then I would go for it. Otherwise I would say better safe than sorry. |`|RQUiHrSRaa	Try a cheeky offer, last Wednesday someone offered me a Mars bar and a half eaten sandwich for my flat in central Skegness.

eACZ1Rhjaa	It will just be more time in daycare or leave them home with their other parent when you are in school. <br>  I went to school nights and worked my regular job in the day so it made some long days. I only had classes 4 nights a week for 4 hours but with more commute time and homework time while working full time there wasn't a lot of extra time. <br>  If you make enough an hour to only work part time it would be easier or if you only take classes 2 nights a week.<br>  If you have to pay for daycare it will be more expensive but maybe you can get one of your parents to watch them the few school hours or the school might have a place for them for those hours.|`|wKQ40DXOaa	Honey I think your hands are so full!

Good luck!|`|XqfH76PMaa	My suggestion is to sell on Ebay.  I have two kids and am starting school at the beginning of the year and that is what I do.  They say the average person has $2000 worth of stuff laying around the house that they do not use and could be sold.  You could begin by selling the clothing that you do not use and by selling you kids clothes.  Just get on and nose around to find out what is selling pretty good and go from there.

Also you can get the Oregon trail card, or food stamps or whatever there called in your state to help with food.
