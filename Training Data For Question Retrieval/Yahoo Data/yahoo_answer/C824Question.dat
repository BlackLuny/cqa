20090225153047AAjvOrn	Food & Drink;Vegetarian & Vegan	How can I become a healthier vegan?	I'm 17 and have been a vegan for six months, and am still struggling to get enough iron and protein every day and to keep my weight up. According to my last blood test I'm anemic, and my blood pressure is low and I'm underweight (5'9, 109), and my parents are driving me insane on a daily basis trying to get me stop being vegan. My dad actually offered me a bribe this morning. Seriously. I need to get them to back off, and they won't until I'm healthier, so I need to get healthy pronto. I already saw a nutritionist for ideas, but honestly, they sucked. I am extremely physically active (swimming & diving, track & field, dance troupe) and so I need more calories and high-energy food.       Could you please suggest some iron and protein-rich food? Also, are there shakes or other portable things I could make and take with me that are more caloric and still vegan?       Thx in adv! : )

The trouble is, most of the ones we've found have too much sugar in them, and we'd like to cut down.      You can suggest any and all hot drinks you like :) You can even tell me the drinks we currently have don't have that much sugar if it's true. We think they have too much though :)      Currently we drink:   Decaff coffee (we have to add sugar to like the taste)   Hot chocolate (too sweet, or too watery, can't win)   Apple cider (too sweet, but our best found option so far)      We've tried lemon tea, and all sorts of teas, but my husband does not like the taste of tea, plus it's not powdered.      My husband's favorite drink is lemon Neo Citrin. Of course, he can only have it when he's sick. A non medicated, similar tasting powdered drink is exactly what we're trying to find :)

I eat about half the bag earlier in the day then the rest later.  Over the past few months someone has been taking my Fritos before I can finish them.  I eat half the bag then when I come back later the rest are gone.  It's not every day so I assume it's someone who rotates.  What can I put on the chips that would make the person sick (or something along similar; ex. diarrhea)?  I would prefer to use something that you would not be able to see on the chips.  If at all possible, no taste.     I’m also open to suggestions for things that would not necessarily make them sick but taste like feces.
