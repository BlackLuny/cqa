20090131122647AAvN4Gj	Food & Drink;Other - Food & Drink	Poll: Do you like toaster pastries? Do you eat them hot or cold? What's your favorite flavor?	Toaster Pastries That Are Surprisingly Good for You--Back in the day, I loved strawberry Pop Tarts. Especially right out of the box--who needs a toaster? At the grocery store over the weekend, these Fiber One Toaster Pastries stopped me in my tracks. I had to have them. So, how did they taste?      They were shockingly yummy--and insanely filling! I ate one before I hit the gym one afternoon and it held me over until dinner. The toaster pastries come in flavors like brown sugar cinnamon, strawberry, chocolate fudge and blueberry. Each pastry contains about 190 calories and five grams of fiber--which is 20 percent of your recommended daily value. The tricky thing is, they come two in a pack; I eat one and save the other for later.

I am a 15 yr old girl and for the past ~15 months I have not eaten junk food or any sort of sweet as a challenge to myself. Now I do the same thing only I am trying to be more lenient. The problem is that I am feeling tired and low. I tried going back to what I was doing before but it didn't make me feel better. I think the best solution is to become a vegetarian (but I can eat eggs). I am going to try it for a few weeks before I am sure but I want to know the health benefits and disadvantages. Also, not only am I going to skip meat, but bread and what I was doing last year (junk food). Can you please explain the side effects of being a vegetarian?
