It's been doing that for awhile but now it's also started shaking whenever i try to accellerate.  And never mind trying to get up a hill unless I have a running start because if you try to accellerate it while going up the hill, that weird noise kicks in and no matter how hard you press on the gas, it barely goes.  Can anyone tell me what's wrong ? and how much is this gonna cost me?

I pulled off and turned to car off I started it back up in about 2-3 mins and it drove fine. And after driving for about another 15 mins I tried to push it hard again and this time same thing happened when I reached around 4000 rpm. This morning when I started it and drove it was fine and I pushed it to 4000 no prob. But the engine feels kinda heavier. Any know what happened.

Okay I have an orange Volkswagen super beetle (1974) and i am looking for some interior seat covers that will make it seem more me, not 1970's. I am specifically looking for polka dot ones preferably in orange. However yellow, green and blue would also be okay. The store/website they are available on, has to be one accessable to the U.S. and are not that expensive ($40 and under) also I just am looking to cover the front seats. I really don't want any fur ones either, just a simple cotton material is fine.Thank you so much, I know that was a very "picky" question.

20090309152931AAPrnjC	Cars & Transportation;Car Makes;Ford	Dual exhaust with One o2 sensor? 89 F150 302?	I have a 89 F150 302. I have been running true dual (no cats) glass packs for 3 years. There is one pipe 1 inch in diameter 3 inches long that connected the two pipes together. This pipe is where the "one" o2 sensor was located.       Well I cracked an exhaust manifold and bought cheap headers. I had a shop modify the exhaust to fit the header. now the pipes do not connect any more with the "tiny 3 inch" pipe. The mechanic left the 3 inch "tiny" pipe on the left exhaust pipe with the o2 sensor still in it. He just cut it at the joint of the right pipe and put a weld cap on it.       The engine light is coming on 95% of the time. Do you think if the mechanic were to remove this "tiny" pipe that leads to no where (which includes the o2 sensor) and put the o2 sensor in the place of where the tiny pipe was, would it turn off the light?       Sorry for the long question. to make it short. If you have one 02 sensor and insert it into one pipe, should the engine light stay off? as of now it is not in the direct flow just in the tiny pipe that goes to no where.      Thanks for the help!!!

Yes, I didn't know this either but tires, just like food, have an expiration date! It is recommended that a tire is out there no more than 6 years, so when ever you go shopping for a "new" tire, make sure its really new! Look for the numbers on the front of the tire (in case you cant see the video- there is a series of numbers for example:  4202  -this means this tire was manufactured on the 42 week of 2002 the first two numbers are for the week in the year the tire was made. Another example of an OLDER tire is 231 - this was made in the 23rd week of 1991!!!!! WOW! So please keep an eye out when you get tires.                http://videos.komando.com/2008/08/23/che...

20090309165517AA496Yw	Cars & Transportation;Safety	Pros & cons of Bill 203 (Street racing law) in Ontario? Please help ASAP !?	Hi everybody. I'm doing this report on street racing law in Ontario(known as Bill 203, which entitles you to $2000 - $10000 fines and vehicle suspensions for driving 50 km/h over speed limit), trying to figure out the 3 pros and 3 cons of having it and need your help big time.       I came up with it, but I don't think some of the points make much sense, so I'd really appreciate if you would let me know some other  pros and cons.      My pros (in short) of having this law:      1. The roads will be safer for drivers and the pedestrians.    2. It sends a message to the driver to follow safety rules   3. The government is increasing its budget by collecting the high fines      cons (in short)      1. It gives too much authority to police officers , who basically have the roles of judges and juries, and some of them are misusing it.   2. In many emergency situations, the drivers would have no choice but to drive faster. For instance, what if it's a question of life and death? The police would not care, and would still treat it as street racing.   3. The main pourpose of this law should not be aimed at collecting high fines, therefore incresing Ontario's economy, but to promote safety .      Once again, thank you so much for reading this and your responses in advance. God bless you !
