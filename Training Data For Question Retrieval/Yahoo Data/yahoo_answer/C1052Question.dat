Kobe Bryant throws him a perfect pass, something Walton easily should've caught and put in, but in his clumsiness he fumbles it and loses it. The other team gets the loose ball. Who is given the turnover? Kobe or Luke?

Yesterday, I went to a birthday party right after my swimming class. Then, I went to the party wearing my competition one-piece swimsuit (it is an Arena swimsuit, and looks exactly like this:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_M22gHfO...  under my clothes. At the party, I got drunk and fell asleep. In the morning, I went home and took a shower. Under the shower, I tried to put the swimsuit off and discovered that it was glued on. Then I realized that someone had put superglue under my swimsuit while I was sleeping. There is superglue all over the suit’s inner surface, except by the crotch (so at least I can go to the bathroom without messing with the swimsuit). I have been trying to put this swimsuit off since then, but NOTHING is working.      I have tried applying nail polish remover and hot water to this swimsuit, but it STILL shows NO SIGNS OF COMING OFF!! No matter I try to pull it off, it remains stuck!      I am getting DESPERATE!!

I told them that should they decide to give me a try, that based on Michael Shannahan and Lane Kiffin, they probably wouldn't pay me either when they fired me from the organization.

20090227172431AAk8eK2	Sports;Football (American)	State your case; best QB's ever?	Everybody hates this question but LOVES to rant about it.  So, i guess at the token of 10pts. can anyone convince me otherwise?   Myself, I rate a quarterback based on team necessity, accuracy with consistency,  footwork, and leadership.  Intangibles i would consider are super bowls, stats, and affects on the game.  So, i say... if you want to call someone the best, make a real QB assessment.   John Elway   TN - A   A&C - D (56% career)   Footwork - F (sacked 516 times)   Leadership - A   Intangibles - A   Overall = 76% C      Joe Montana   TN - C (Steve Young)   A&C - A (63%)   Footwork - C   Leadership - A   Intangibles - A+   Overall = 84% B-      Dan Marino   TN - A   A&C - B   Footwork - B   Leadership - A   Intangibles - C   Overall = 82% B-      Sammy Baugh   TN - A   A&C - D   Footwork - B   Leadership - A   Intangibles - A+   Overall = 84% B      Terry Bradshaw   TN - A   A&C - D   Footwork - C    Leadership - A   Intangibles - A+   Overall = 82% B-      Johnny Unitas   TN - B   A&C - C   Footwork - A   Leadership - B   Intangibles - A+   Overall = 84% A      Steve Young   TN - C   A&C - A+   Footwork - B   Leadership - A   Intangibles - A   Overall = 86% B+      Tom Brady   TN - B   A&C - B   Footwork - A   Leadership - A   Intangibles - A   Overall = 86% B+      Peyton Manning   TN - A   A&C - A   Footwork - A+   Leadership - A   Intangibles - B   Overall = 90% A-      I'm not being biased.  Redo the math.  In A&C I gave up to 50 points for completion %, and up to 50 for TD to INT ratio.  Leadership was a gimme, Unitas was the only one who scored below 90.  Footwork i based on x's sacked and just basic fundamentals.  Intangibles, everyone on the list started with a 70, Super Bowl win gave you a 80, Multiple gave you a 90, and changing the way the postion was played gave you 100.  Also, in intangibles 3+ Super Bowls got you 100.  To score 100 in any other category you had to be statistically the best.   Observe:   Brett Favre   TN - A (boost to the Jets, GB fell out)   A&C -  B (61%=100/2+(464[s.b.]=100/4+310[s.b.]=50...   Footwork - F ((464=50)/2+70[b.f.])/2)   Leadership - A   Intangibles - B (70+10)   Overall = 78% C+   Run your QB through my rater.  Does anyone disagree.  I mean, please, correct me if i'm wrong.  Who is the best QB to ever play the game?

I found a website that explains each, but is there a decent comparison?  Or, is there an acceptable limit to ride with...ie. 120 lumens or at least 350 candlepower?  300 lumens?  1,000,000 candlepower?

That's great for us, some veteran experience and in a position that's hurting. Now we need to pick up Curry and he can be taught by Vrabel.      I've heard that this might be only part of a trade with Pats-Chiefs to get Matt Cassel in Kansas City. I heard Vrabel spoke too soon or something and they were trying to wait to reveal an even bigger deal. I hope so, Cassel would be a nice addition to KC. What do you all think on this and the odds of Cassel wearing red and gold next season.

I don't wanna see any of the Roush drivers go at the end of the season to accommodate NASCAR's 4 car team rule.      The reason i ask this is because i have been hearing that Jamie has to perform this year or he may be out of a ride. But i thought he signed an extension so he would not be out of a ride. Idk....i might be imagining things but i hope i am not.

20070625172436AAzysvI	Sports;Wrestling	Why does God keep taking away all of the good, pure hearted people away from wrestling?	I believe that God has a grand plan in life but why does he keep taking away all of the good, pure hearted people from wrestling, guys like Chris Benoit, Eddie Guerrero, Brian Pillman, and Owen Hart,but guys like Randy Orton who constantly do wrong things, like wreck a hotel room, do drugs, and harass the divas are allowed to have so much success and become rich. I do believe in god and I do believe he has a plan for everyone, but to take the life of not only Chris Benoit, but his wife and his innocent young son, I think is a crime against humanity. They never did anything wrong, Chris was a good man and so was his family. I am a strong Christian but I simply can't understand why god would forsake Chris and his family. Well, at least I know that Chris is up in heaven with his best friends, Eddie Guerrero, Brian Pillman, and Owen Hart, may they rest in peace.
