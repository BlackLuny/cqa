s8VgyzE2aa	Well I've never really had this issue probably because my first born were twins and have always had to share everything so they got used to it quick. I have a lot of experience working in childcare centers and as a nanny though and I would suggest playing a game where you actually practice sharing and taking turns.<br>  <br>  Get a timer and a favorite toy. Then you say that you are going to play the turns game. The timer makes it more fun for the child too. So you set the timer for a very sort time to start and you play with the toy until the timer beeps (maybe 30 seconds) then you say "Oh it's Your turn now! and you hand the toy to the child and set the timer for 30 seconds. when it beeps it's your turn again. <br>  <br>  By playing this game they get used to the idea of taking turns and they come to realize that in a short time they will get it back again and so they learn to stop throwing a fit. make sure to offer lots of praise when he turns over the toy for your turn without issue. If your child gets upset when it's your turn, you need to still take your turn and try things like allowing them to hold the timer and watch for their turn again but continue with your turn until it beeps and then it's their turn again even if they acted up during your turn. They might fuss on your turn in the beginning until they come to realize their turn comes again soon and they getthe idea of the game.<br>  <br>  As time goes on and you play more, you can expand the amount of time that you each get the toy so that the child learns to be patient for longer and longer periods of time.<br>  <br>  Kids don't automatically know how to share or take turns so we have to find ways to teach them. They also don't understand the idea of time and that they will get it with a certain amount of time. The timer really helps them because they can see exactly when their turn will come again.<br>  <br>  If this game goes well I would suggest to the teachers that they try using the timer to help your son see how much time he has left to play with a toy.<br>  <br>  If I was working at that center I would have thought of the timer myself. I would set the the toys on the tabe and have each child take one, then we would set the timer for one minute or two and after it beeps we would all switch around the toys. This not only helps with teaching sharing but it's more fun for the kids!|`|AA11481889	Congratulations...lol ..he sounds totally normal!<br>  <br>  Its a tough concept for them to grasp...or accept at least.<br>  <br>  I just make it a point to have my son share with me..<br>  <br>  When we're playing or he's having his snack or what ever the activity may be....out comes the "Awww Mommy wants some, will baby share? can mommy have some?"  or "Can mommy play with the blue car?  Mommy wants to share the blue car"<br>  <br>  It doesn't always go over...but he's certainly better than when we started.  They just need to see sharing is a "good thing" and that if they'll usually get the item in question back eventually.|`|7CDcMt17aa	  We have that same problem with our 9 year old and 5 year old but what seems to help is encouraging them to share I would give a lot of praise and even a snack for the one who is sharing and it seems to make them want to share more.|`|lObEjUh1aa	hmmm, i'm 31 and i still struggle with sharing...<br>  <br>  HEY!!!  WHAT ARE YOU DOING ON MY INTERNETS?!?!?!  GET OFF MY INTERNETS!!!!!|`|AA11109728	Don't worry.  I have seen that it's normal for them to get used to the idea of sharing.  My daughter is 4, and was around the sitter's daughter all day, she is 5.  At that age, there are still issues about sharing!  To explain, sharing is just taking turns playing with a toy.  You could just practice with your son at home, getting out some toys, when he is playing with one maybe ask him nicely if you may play with it now (or have a turn playing with it now), and when he gives it to you then give him the toy you were playing with.  Stress to him that you are sharing, and praise him when he shares with you without a fit.|`|JSdfD4AYaa	When I play with my son (who is a 3 year old only child), I find that he has problems sharing with adults too, so I try to push the importance of sharing on him then.  I am trying to be careful not to make him think he only has to share because I'm bigger than him, but because it's the nice thing to do.  Coloring is a good activity to demonstrate with, when we sit down to color sometimes he throws a fit because he suddenly wants the crayon I have.  I will just continue to color with it until he gets over it and realizes there are other crayons in the box.  If he starts to get really angry and make a physical objection (i.e. trying to take the crayon away from me, kicking his feet, etc.) then I quickly put all of the crayons back in the box and put them away.  If he can't share them, nobody is going to play with them.  He's starting to catch on, but it's tough.  Any time you get an opportunity to let your son play with a younger child, encourage it!  My son likes playing with children smaller than him, and he actually enjoys sharing things with them.
lcg1u1U7aa	Most make in the neighborhood of 150,000, however, most doctors have 100,000 dollars in debt by they time they get into practice which is about the same as a second mortgage payment.  Also, family practice is one of the lowest paying medical specialties.|`|ebQ4vuUnaa	It would depend on what State they live in, but they make a great living!<br>  <br>  |`|0ZnX6Qjyaa	depends where they work, But at least 300K a year possibly more when they get pay offs from large Drug Companies to push their drugs on patients, but that money is under the table it can range from 30,000 dollars to 800,000 dollars.

And no he doesn't take drug company money on the side (and really that is sort of a thing of the past) in fact he refuses samples even so he isn't affliated with any of it. You people who are saying they make so much money just don't realize it is not nearly as much as you think especially once overhead is figured in.|`|dOHuMMrfaa	It depends are they in private practice, community agency, shared practice? It is really broad. I would say on low end 100k on high end 500k. But you need to understand that medical liability insurance astronomical, as well as equipment costs, staff, updating your licensure. My brother in law is a chiropractor and started off making about 100k now a  bit more but after all of the above not as lucrative as you may think.

7PnYGfDvaa	I can only imagine the shock you must have felt. Planned or not, it is so daunting to face the fact that you are going to have a baby. I have never been pregnant and although married, I dread the childbirth part to the point that I postpone conception plans. I hope that you do not decide to not keep the child, no matter how scared and insecure you feel now. I suggest you take some time to realize this fantastic change in your life-- I know that it takes a LONG while to fully comprehend how enormous and life-changing a pregnancy can be. I also hope that there are people around you who can be happy with the news and can really support you on a psychological, practical and financial basis. Forgive me for assuming that you are a young mum but I cannot help thinking that you were not ready for this. (That is not to say that 26-year-olds just like me cannot get panicky!) Pregnancy is a roller-coaster of emotions and a game of hormones and it is natural to feel helpless or even a bit hostile towards your baby. Maybe you are not even ready for a baby and you feel like it will put a stop to your dreams. While I cannot pretend that taking responsibilty for another being is not going to affect your needs and priorities in life, I can only say that there are some infinite rewards to motherhood- and such as you cannot possibly even fathom right now, at your moments of bewilderment. Such rewards would be looking at your newborn and be amazed at the wonder of life. Holding him/her in your arms and not want to trade that precious moment for anything else or another feeling in the world. Realizing that this being is a PART OF YOU. That as you will love him/her unconditionally for the rest of you life, he/she will love you and you will leave your marks in his/her soul for ever. Your heart will melt everytime he/she hugs you and calls you "mommy". It is a love like no other. Nothing you have experienced before. Consider this step, this baby, as a continuation of your existence and your life not as an obstacle. And last but not least, be proud of yourself. You are the "carrier" of a new life, you are a strong woman  willing to go through this, despite the doubts and/or moments of weakness. You would not be human if you were not shocked. But think of how incredibly strong us women are in the end-- in our wombs lies the strength of thousands of years of existence. I truly wish you best of physical and spiritual wellbeing during your pregnancy..! Keep us posted, please.|`|oScCDhMJaa	Unfortunitly in the early stages there really isnt that much you can do, so you just have to wait it out until you go for your three month appointment where they will take your bloods, and you will also get a scan and see the baby for the first time. Just take it easy and don't lift anything heavy!!|`|4PPRsXpjaa	ok i take it ur still in high school since u went to the nurse but u should just be careful with wat u do dont smoke if u do dont do any thing that may harm the baby just wait to find out then if u r find a good dr and set up appt.ok good luck|`|vSSoYgoLaa	Now you should prolley pick a obgyn if you dont already have one.

Most importantly you need to get her out of the house and doing something. The more she does the better she'll feel. I had a short spell of PND and I just stayed in jammies all day watching tv and looking after the baby. <br>  <br>  Another important thing is sleep - if you can babysit for just a few hours she'll feel refreshed.<br>  <br>  A healthy diet with fruit and veg worked wonders for me. I lost the baby weight and I felt better about myself!<br>  <br>  Good luck with it and congrats on the babies!|`|nhIb1dmeaa	Hi, I would tell her that you have investigated this by asking mums who have had it!<br>  Tell her our comments!<br>  One comment that helped me when i was bad, was , that, There is an end to it!

Be a kind and patient friend! It is tough!|`|J1stiMioaa	just be there for her, take her out for a cuppa, a stroll with the babies, getting out really does help, even if it is just to the shops, and a suprise bunch of flowers works wonders, although quite possibly generate tears (they will be appriciated though!)|`|dXVA1wHDaa	Don't try and force her into talking, just go round to hers and give her a hand with baby.

Wide hips are healthier when it comes to childbearing.|`|LKIhUMCgaa	it makes it less painful. my mom has it and both of her pregnancies were easy bc of how wide her hip-bones r, also i inherited it too, yay! lol not due till may 4th though<br>  <br>  ps. childbearing means giving birth, look it up in the dictionary lol|`|fa0dd5777a3c1d7f167867babbfebd0baa	No not necessarily. It just means that you'll most likely probably dilate the full 10 without tearing...but still that's not even a guarantee.|`|1D9pTEZVaa	it won't make it less painful, but it will ease some of the discomfort of the baby laying down that low in your pelvis.  Most of the pain that you feel while in labor is the contractions and the friction of the baby coming down the birth canal especially if you have no epidural.|`|u4x3UMsEaa	No.  My sister has an hour glass shape with reasonably wide hips.  Her birth canal was not big enough.  She had to have a C section.  The baby was born with bruises on her cheek bones from my sister trying to push her out until the doctor figured out the problem.|`|PR0kF1yDaa	Childbearing no, delivery yes.|`|9urWwYIiaa	Well I'm guessing you are having a baby so..........CONGRATS.

xK5lWU3qaa	Yes and no. <br>  <br>  First of all, women of all ages were more sexually liberated after the birth control pill rolled into the mainstream market. Having said that, teenagers probably feel more sexually liberated by these innovative products as well.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, teenage girls are biologically programmed to desire sex around the age of 15 years old whether or not birth control is widely available. This "awakening" may happen earlier (say 13), or later (say 17), but around 15 years old is actually pretty much average, and this is no reason for alarm in and of itself.<br>  <br>  I think that it is far more concerning that young women in this age group are idealizing sexy role models instead of intelligent or successful role models. Young women are really working towards establishing an identity and the visual data that they are gathering during this process is extremely important.<br>  <br>  If a young woman admires Hilary Clinton, perhaps she strives to become a lawyer. If a young woman admires Paris Hilton or the "The Girls Next Door", well then, what do you think happens to the decisions she makes to position herself according to this new identity?|`|vKEYa8aeaa	i dont think it gives them a reason to have sex but it think that it makes girls less weary off the consequences that sex brings. nonetheless, plan b and birth control is a great thing and shouldnt be advertized less.|`|01Mu3wUeaa	No, it will not give them a reason to have sex.<br>  <br>  They have been having sex at a young age before such things were invented and it will continue.|`|64OsCr8laa	no that it gives them a reason but it givves them confident on nothing happening i think such as getting pregnant i believe since they know its there they are not more careless and dont think as much about it as they should...they know if it they dont wanna use protection its ok cause they have pills now...its just like birth control a virgins parents can put her on birth control just to prevent anything later on and now she feels not as scared cause nothing bad can happen now<br>  <br>  did i make since?|`|0RFUKkBLaa	I do agree that young girls probably do think to go ahead and have sex because plan b is there but imagine that we didnt have it there would be soo many more abortions and unwanted children in the world, so there is definately two sides to it but i think its better that its available|`|m3E6rPm1aa	No, they are going to have sex with or without emergency contraception, look at how many people don't use the morning after pill and get pregnant, they go strait for abortion, they don't care about getting pregnant, nor do they worry about it.|`|gG8oyymiaa	Well what they fail to realize is that you have to be 18 years old to buy it. Then they also cost 80 dollars. So if they are thinking that way they are going to have to go to an adult to get it bought. and Then they are going to have to come up with 80 bucks to buy it.|`|2DsgflhOaa	I never thought of it that way. But you're right, it does seem more now that girls are having sex younger and younger. They're having sex at an age that i didn't even know anything about oral sex when I was that age. I think it's fine for ladies to take the plan b pill, but not continuously, i'm sure studies will show later on a negative effect it might have on our bodies if not takin responsibly and in moderation. I mean they mind as well just start passing out birth control in health classes instead of just condoms at the rate the younger generation is going.<br>  <br>  And all the ladies that say you have to be 18 to get it are wrong. I was getting it at age 16 with no problems and for free at planned parent hood. Girls can work there ways around it if they really want to.<br>  <br>  Also, maybe make it clear in your class since a lot of these women don't seem to know that taking the plan b is not killing anything, all it is doing is preventing the sperm from reaching the egg and if its too late when you take it and you're already pregnant, it has no harm or negative effect on the baby.|`|T526fAIeaa	o! Of course not<br>  <br>  i dont believe in abortion i believe in the morning pill<br>  it is your reasponisiblitlity if your prego, not the babys.<br>  Therefor killing it isnt right!!!!!ugh that makes me so mad. Girls who have sex at young ages are irrisponisible and total sluts.<br>  <br>  <br>  WAIT TILL YOU ARE MARRIED WHORE.|`|c5AJGcYcaa	I would say no, because even tho the morning after pill is available without a RX you have to be a certain age to purchase it. And where i live it's about 60 dollars for the set.<br>  <br>  Not worth it, a condom is a lot cheaper|`|LqnWk9Ilaa	No i think girls who have sex at a young age will do it anyway. I hate what the U.S. is turning into, every day i see girls on yahoo asking if they're pregnant and they're only 13 and 14.... wtf. i blame tv shows and commercials.|`|AA12239480	No.<br>  That's dumb, because you have to be eighteen to get that without a prescription, and why would it?<br>  That's like god people saying that stem-cell research being legal will give women more of a reason to get an abortion.|`|iFBZA9mxaa	I say no.|`|pvDVFrKwaa	no because they will do it with or without that option. its better to give them the option to protect themselves|`|skvzwS8Faa	Well I believe if anyone wants to have sex bad enough, regardless if there is a pill, they're going to have sex. Yeah it sucks that there are young people( not just girls, but guys also b/c it takes two) out there having sex and be irresponsible. But I would rather a young couple use a morning after pill than to try and raise a baby that they are not responsible enough to handle not to mention the love, time, and money it takes.|`|lx6FVMT6aa	I think that girls will have sex either way. But yeah, you need a script if you're under 18 so that's what they might not get. Unless they let their parents know that they had unprotected sex, they would need to find an adult to get it for them. I realize it's 80 dollars, but does insurance cover any of it as it covers birth control?|`|3TJxmDS9aa	yes! they are just running around sleeping with whoever just because they think that they can do anything and nothing will happen to them. its not right. It not hard to keep it in your pants. i am 16 and i havent had sex, but ive managed to be with the SAME boy for TWO years. like people are so stupid. you can get pregnant and what happens when you dont have the option of killing whatever was about to grow inside of you. i hate everyone that thinks they can go and do that|`|er6tQfsnaa	i agree, i think its like saying here's a birth control pill or something like that so you can go have sex as much as you want and not get pregnant or pay the consequences. so if they know they have something like that then theyre more than likely to go do it.|`|qYJgB0Bsaa	I think Plan B was a good idea for that "just-in-case" situation for women who have had unfortunate events. But from what your saying you must also think condoms are promoting teen sex just as much as Plan B ? Schools are actually handing out condoms to teens now. Soooo yeah|`|JnosRXlGaa	honestly id say go ahead and have sex at a young age...but if they catch a disease or get pregnant...then they should be the one to have to deal with it. Every action has a consequence and if they cant learn that...then thats their problem.|`|zevqkFDXaa	No. When I was younger,  I didn't get on birth control so I could have sex, I got on them BECAUSE I was having sex.  If young girls want to have sex, they are going to have sex.|`|acf19784c47b1f7b60623f6016329936aa	Although yes it does cause more underage girls to have sex most of these girls would probably have sex anyway.....so in my opinion it causes less underage pregnancies|`|lmKwo7Kjaa	Yea since girls have to chose who to have sex with carefully because of pregnancy. So I Totally Agree with you.|`|eTm9uLqyaa	I think that if they want it they will do it with or without all that stuff.<br>  That stuff just helps the cause of wanting it..
Iz5tNA5aaa	I have 4 children 11 and under.  The 1st three started team sports at 5 because of the cutoff age, but the 4th started tball last year at the age of 3 because he was turning 4 before the cutoff date.  He actually learned to walk on the fences at the baseball field because his older brothers played and we were at the fields A LOT.<br>  <br>  You normally pay to be on town teams and it is normally for uniforms and field times.  In my area of Florida, the fee is for hat, jersey, belt and socks for uniform (you are responsible for pants and cleats) and for the fields and umpires for the older levels.  Each child brings their own equipment (gloves, bats, helmet), but they are given team equipment as well and bats and helmets can be shared.  I always buy them their own helmets and there is no sharing because it is more hygenic.  Gloves are difficult to share on a team since each child needs one to play.|`|uj1A73ZGaa	I was 3 or 4 when I started soccer and gymnastics. I loved both of them and I also did dance til my senior year of high school. Maybe you could put your daughter in dance I know here they have dance for 3 and 4 year olds. <br>  I am putting my oldest in dance and gymnastics this summer. You can also check at like your community center they have like music classes and tumbling classes or swimming classes.|`|AA10943329	Push kids too early and they burn out. Mine did basket ball skills at 5. It taught them all the skills needed but not games. They started swimming at 4. My son was in a basketball team for one season at the age of 8 but he became more involved with gymnastics and had to give it up. Both mine are 10 tomorrow and are in gymnastics , Cubs and swimming so no real team sports. My sons gymnastics group compete occasionally|`|6RNQDRjvaa	I wouldn't recommend team sports for childs younger than 5.|`|hUbNKOTsaa	well school sports dont start until 7th grade, and you should definitely get her involved in as many as possible, because it keeps her active, shes not bored, and makes a lot of friends and has FUN!!!!<br>  town leagues are usually non-competitive and are no more than $50 and you get a jersey, trophy or medal(usually), and a season of fun. you could start soccer around 4, teeball around 5 basketball around 7, volleyball around 8 or 9, cheerleading around 5 or 6, and dance around 4*(although this wouldnt be a town league, you would have to take her to a dance school) then you have to buy some equipment(ex teeball a glove and bat) soccer you would need to buy cleets, basketball just shoes and volleyball shoes and kneepads, but with the exception of teeball, no town league should be more than $75, and tee ball should be around $100, but all the equipment (with exception of clothes and shoes, because they outgrow them) should last 3-4 years.<br>  <br>  when she gets older, like around 9-10, she can decide on one or two and get really good at and maybe even play in a competitive league, just if she wants to quit, dont force her to play, she will hate playin and eventually because of that hate all sports and school and anything else you make her do and will turn out to be a high school drop out and draw unemployment for a livin|`|pSm7G4O9aa	I was in 3rd grade, and I hated it! YUck,but then i tried it again in 6th and LOVED it and did it for several years|`|gGGyJankaa	I was 7<br>  thats a good age because they can pick the sport THEY like and will most likely stick with =]|`|SxPhldhhaa	I don't have children yet myself, but I recall being on a basketball team organized by our church when I was 8. We did have to pay to be on that one, though. I was on another team organized by our community center the following year, and didn't have to pay for that one. <br>  <br>  I was never on a town or a school team, though, so I'm not sure about those. I'm guessing that you won't have to pay to be on a school team, though, considering that the school would want the best people on their team, paying or not. At my school, there's no need to pay to be on a team, although you have to try out and the competition to get on the team is rather stiff.<br>  <br>  I personally don't recommend starting a child that young in team sports, though. I don't really think they'd be able to pick a sport best suited for them or be able to play it with as much dedication than older ones might. I mean, when I was 3 or 4 and had to pick a sport to go with, I probably would've just picked something that my parents liked, like baseball (which my dad was especially good at) and might not have enjoyed it as much. When I chose basketball at age 8, it was a serious choice and I still play basketball now. So that's just a thought to think about.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|hKJIDdVqaa	my daughter 6, my son was 7, my other son was 8.  Yes you pay to be on the team.  Yes you buy equipment if you want.  They will have bats, and helmets (buy your own though, think head lice)  you will have to buy a T-ball glove.

TJusfEnlaa	Jake got his bottom teeth at about 6 months, the drooling and gnawing started at about 7 months, and four top teeth broke through when he was almost 8 months. Only one week later another bottom one appeared, bringing his grand total to 7, although here we are 2 months later, still waiting on the twin to make its appearance!|`|aJLx0nhNaa	Once the teeth started coming (at 6 months) they never really stopped (he's 8.5 months now).  He's got five now.|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	took forever for my son. he got his first tooth at 9 months second at 11 months and 3rd andd 4th at 13 months|`|6emxR9pQaa	It could be. Some babies are born with a couple teeth already. Each child is different. Sometimes teeth will start coming in all at once. Then could possibly slow down after a few have come in. My son did not even get his first tooth until he was 13 months old, then after that they came in pretty quickly. Like I said, each child is different, either way your baby seems to be on track. Good luck, stay patient through the fussiness and take lots of pictures!! :) <br>  <br>  I am sorry that you gave my answer a thumbs down, I am a pediatric nurse for the past 10 yrs, I do know what I talking about. Check with your Dr. if you have further questions at your next well baby visit.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps.|`|AA12058041	they are gonna start coming in every where now give him frozen teethers or just out of the fridge they love to knaw on something hard to help break them thru their are many things you could supervise and gove to him good luck it a ongoing process
Yz9tGmKFaa	Have you taken a HPT (home pregnancy test)?<br>  If your cycles are consistent and you're two weeks late, a HPT should tell you if you're pregnant.  HCG two weeks past a missed period should show up on a HPT in the blink of an eye.  If anything, you want blood work to make sure that your HCG and progesterone levels are normal . . . call the lab and ask them for a cash price -- most labs offer a discounted price if you are paying cash and not billing insurance.  You will need a lab slip/scrip from your doctor.  Best of luck to you.|`|TYErFAAzaa	Well they are done like any other blood test.  And usually take about a day to get the results.

WT56iKwZaa	It is the Apgar score and is a scale to rate a newborns well being. the doctors score the babies Heart rate, skin color and response to stimulus at 1 minute after birth and 5 minutes after birth. It may be done more often at 5 minute intervals if there were complications. A low score is an indication that the baby may have some problems|`|PDHCOrOSaa	The apgar test I believe ( but it might be spelled different )|`|HGqmsaM5aa	It an APGAR scale. It tells the nurses and doctors how your little one is doing and what their condition is. They measure it every couple minutes for the first little bit then every couple hours after.  One minute — and again five minutes — after your baby is born, doctors calculate his Apgar score to see how he's doing. It's a simple process that helps determine whether your newborn is ready to meet the world without additional medical assistance. The lower the score the worse.|`|5jT9cO2haa	Apgar.

bcZSIphUaa	My doctor classifies infertility as 6 months or more of ttc without success.<br>  <br>  I really recommend that you and your partner go along to your doctors and get yourselves checked out.<br>  <br>  For you, this will involve blood tests to check hormone levels and maybe ultrasound to have a look at your ovaries.<br>  <br>  For your partner this will involve sperm check.<br>  <br>  I went to doctor to get checked and found out that i have PCOS. This means that I don'y ovulate each month. <br>  <br>  I am on MEtformin and starting clomid next month to try and ovulate and thuc conceive.<br>  <br>  Best of luck.|`|lTkYWiy5aa	It's normal for it to take up to a year to conceive. A doctor usually won't do anything unless you have been trying for a year (6 months if you're over 35). However, since you are armed with information that might imply a fertility problem, I would make an appointment with your doctor for a checkup. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|h4UzjZVnaa	We've been trying for 5 months also.

Honestly, I haven't used any opk's or went to the doc for a check up to see if either one of us are ok in the fertility dept. Were just trying it the good ol' fashioned way.

It is great to see a guy take responsibility for something, when many guys in your shoes just walk away.<br>  <br>  I hope that in the end it all works out for you.<br>  <br>  Good Luck.<br>  <br>  **If you cannot afford a lawyer you could try getting legal aid, they usually represent people cheaply/free.  And if she is going to take you to court to help pay medical expenses etc, then you should definately be able to get rights etc.
bcZSIphUaa	Don't you just wish that there was 1 clear sign that you were pregnant? Like suddenly your body does something to let you know?<br>  <br>  It's awful waiting out the 2 weeks to see whether you've conceived or not!<br>  <br>  But, every woman has to go through the wait and be patient and hopeful (but not too hopeful and not over analyse too much!).<br>  <br>  I think it's true that the less you stress, worry, agonise, analyse and focus on whether you're pregnant / ttc the more luck you seem to have.<br>  <br>  I've been obsessed with ttc...which is hard for me cos of my PCOS infertility. HOwever, last month I went on a holiday and stopped thinking about ttc. I'm not pregnant but I've had my first period since stopping the pill 7 months ago. That's great news for me and I think stopping the stress helped it come!<br>  <br>  All the best, try and relax and enjoy the hope : )|`|qBEt621jaa	If you are pregnant it's not likely you would have all or any of these symptoms so early.  Could be many other things.  Then again . . . .  You'll have to wait for the test.

AA12306087	Both months I've been on Clomid I've felt ovulation pains. It's hard to explain how they felt, but they were in the right lower quadrant, and hurt more when I was walking..like with every step I could feel it.  It never was really painful, just irritating painful.  The first month my temp jumped a little so I thought I'd ovulated and the next day I had these pains and low and behold my temp jumped more the next day and that's when fertility friend interpreted ovulation.  So I know it's ovulation!  And I also had it this month the same cycle day as last! I took it as a good sign that I was clearly ovulating.  We'll see, AF's due Saturday!  Good luck to you!|`|AIskV0efaa	with pcos that is really hard to say my overies always hurt so.....i have pcos also|`|Yz9tGmKFaa	You might be experiencing ovulation pain (which would be from a mature follicle).  Did you take LH tests and if so, did you catch a surge?  Are you temping?  This offers another piece of data to determine if and when you ovulated, though ovulation won't show on your chart until after a few days of a sustained rise in temp.  If the pain becomes more than an annoyance, I suggest calling your doctor.  I am on CD 14 too.  ;)  Good luck!
M3pjhIecaa	While i'm not a mum, my kids had major rashes and colic bought on by the milk we switched around a few times not knowing what the problem was, by the time we realized we'd moved him onto solids and had only minor problems from then on. Both my kids are lactose and gluten intolerant, as well as some odd ones like lamb for one and pork for the other, dairy products, coconuts and so on really random, I've no allergies at all but the wife has wheat and dairy. <br>  One has to say that both of them while having rashes and colic both continued to drink the milk however, the amounts they consumed increased with age as obviously the stuff was passing through there system quickly, of course now they're older the symptoms are obvious and avoidable. I don't think you can tell that much from the stools as milk is going to pass through the system and colour them that way anyways, i'd start him on solids and move him on from the milk if your that concerned, I know in the UK there's a company that you send a tiny blood sample too and they test for the top 100 allergies, I'm sure there'll be several offering the same sort of thing over there.|`|KICQQxLxaa	Need more details.  What was he drinking before whole milk, breastmilk or formula?  If formula, what kind??  It will make a big difference in the answer.<br>  <br>  ETA:  Ok, since he was breastfed, it is possible that he does have an intolerance or lactose problem, or it could be taking him a while to get use to drinking whole milk.  My daughter's bowel movements were all over the place after switching to whole milk, and at 2 years old, they are still all over.  Some days are formed, some loose, some little marbles, etc.  It could also be something that he is eating.<br>  <br>  Usually, there are many more symptoms that just poo problems.  My DD had eczema, bad gas, stomach cramping, blood in stool, vomiting.  My DD had a fecal  ocult test which tested the blood in her stool, and that is how we found out about the intolerance.<br>  <br>  You can keep him on the Enfagrow for a while, and then slowly transition him back to regular milk by mixing 1/4 milk to 3/4 Enfagrow and slowly up to regular milk.|`|JP2h62qiaa	After breast feeding my son, when I switched to formula he had this problem. His poop's were almost mucousy and yellow. Eww. He had it for so long. Months I remember.  IS there any way you could switch to soy? It is possible to have a soy allergy too but it is worth a shot. I would make a trip in to talk to the pediatrician about it. Speak about soy and what options you have naturally before having to give your child something like Xantac. Good luck|`|475SHlu3aa	I'm not exactly your target audience for this question, but I am lactose intolerant.  I've never done it, but doctors have a test where they have you eat a substance, and then have you exhale into a container and measure the hydrogen content.

Serving others with what we have that they need is the best and lasting way to self satisfaction.|`|bwKZ8MWWaa	All of the have one extra chormosone, that is down syndrome|`|0d9b657fe19e5aa8e1634e830acde7a4aa	You can't just be an aide to someone with Down Syndrome first of all, you will be placed with any child that needs an aide. Unless of course you are hired as a 1 to 1 aide with someone who just happens to have Downs. <br>  I have 2 children with Down Syndrome and I have to say that your statment about adorable little bunnies is slightly offending. I am not bashing you...I only bring this up so that hopefully you could be more aware as to not offend others. They are not little bunnies, they are people and to say that "they" are the most adorable...... is grouping them together when in fact they are all individuals. Also, regarding your question on looks is simply again, because everyone is different. There are certain physical traits that identify someone with Downs and some people have all the traits, some have a only a few, some have none.....it is simply because they are all different, just as everyone else is.<br>  Good luck in your aide quest.|`|77b89da50334d58ffae963702c00caaaaa	The severity of the syndrome plays a part in the physical appearance of a given individual.  Other complications will also factor in as well.  My first job out of high school was a nurses aide in an MR facility.  It was the best job I have ever had to date and if it paid better I would go back to doing it in a heartbeat.<br>  <br>  Jimmy P. - You may want to re-read the question being asked here.  She is not making fun of those with DS in anyway.  She is mearly asking why certain individuals have very obvious charaturistics and in others it is not so prominant.  Your kind of attack towards an innocent and respectfully asked question only helps to further prevent those with DS from being understood and accepted for the wonderful human beings they are.<br>  <br>  Sweetgrass - 'Retarded' is an insult no matter what it's actual definition is.  And caring for ANY child is not all balloons and party hats whether they have a disability for not.|`|N51LBaQaaa	no they will all have that characteristic

wpAGvRIoaa	Life for kids these days is very different than when you grew up. There is more pressure for kids to grow up fast and to do things like an adult. She most likely is embarrassed to talk to out of fear that you might be disappointed or she is doing or thinking about things that you would not approve of. That is part of life, breaking away and pushing the limits. It's important for kids to get in trouble and make mistakes (to a point, then it becomes destructive). As a mom it is important for you to understand that she may pull away, do what you would rather her not, act as tho you are some kind of prison keeper, and may even begin to say hurtful things. It's not anything that you will do, it's her. Not all teenagers do this, sometimes you get lucky, but 75% or more of teenagers go through the same thing. Just remember that no matter what she still loves you and in a couple of years you'll go back to having the same loving daughter. I am 21 now and I probably was one of those kids that you would try to shelter her from. I had dealings with the law, ditched school, continually disobeyed any parental request, and if i even spoke to my parents i said downright evil things. Now, in hindsight, i would do anything to take it back. My only advice to you is to NEVER stop pushing into her life. She may resent you for it but in the end she will be grateful you didn't give up. After about 3 years of hell my parents pulled back, decided to try giving me 'space' but i just fell deeper, luckily i turned myself around but not for a while. Since your daughter is still really young you're just experiencing the beginning. If you want to get her to talk to you now you could try tell her bad things you did or embarrassing thoughts or stories you have from when you were her age. It might make her more comfortable talking to you about what is happening to her if she doesn't think you are perfect and not want to let you down. Hope this helps a little.|`|GMIsOYYCaa	Kids can smell a hidden agenda coming from a mile away. So if your conversation starts with "So...how is school? Are you having any problems?" then she will close up like a clam immediately. If your relationship hasn't been open and trusting, you can't expect her to just dish her innermost thoughts to you. These things take time. So maybe you should invite her to do something non-threatening, like go to the mall to go shopping together, go out for lunch this Saturday, etc. And you can say something like, "You know, when I was your age, I had to deal with this issue..." (mention something that you think she's going through, like having a crush who she doesn't think likes her back, or not being popular, etc) And if she doesn't bite then, she doesn't bite. You can try again doing something next weekend. You just have to be patient.|`|DDFSITiYaa	ooh, I know I am going to be there in a couple years.  My daughter is 9 and since preschool, she has been pretty closed-mouthed on so many things that happen at school.  I have learned that to get results, asking is not the answer.  You need to almost be an investigator and question her indirectly.  It is best to try to do some one on one activities with her that distract her.  Baking cookies for example.  As you are baking you strike up a converstation - "I remember baking these when you were 5; you sure have grown up fast.... let it develop naturally.  Kids hate being patronized or being 'lead' in converstations. <br>  <br>  There is an excellent book called How to Talk So Kids Listen and Listen so They Will Talk' by Adel Faber.  I borrowed it from the library so many times I ended up buying a copy because I use it as a resource again and again.|`|kEhcVZKmaa	I am only 23 and pregnant with my first child so I don't know how much help i will be. But my mom never talked to me about anything as a child. Sometimes she did but i was like your daughter and never wanted to answer. Try telling her about some problems you may have faced as a preteen at school. Maybe if she hears a life experience you went through that is similar to what she is going through it may help her feel more comfortable to open up to you. Even if she doesn't respond at first just keep talking to her. I know i was a pain in the butt at that age lol good luck|`|ujE80q8Iaa	Is she your only child? Do you have any other kids her age, plus or minus a few years?<br>  <br>  I am 18 and my sister is 4 years younger. Growing up, if my sister was clearly not talking to my mother about something even if she asked and asked, my mother would ask me to talk to her. Even if siblings aren't that close, it is easier to open up to your sibling than a parent. If you don't have any other kids...if she has cousins her age, or just asking her friends might do the trick.|`|22221968cc6e48e97db5387607cd0f8faa	Just keep at it, letting her know that you'll always be there for her, and that you're willing to talk might mean more to her right now than actually talking. Also, maybe you can share some of your school-day hardships, letting her know that she's not the only one that goes through these kinds of things. I know that if my mom had shared more of her life with me, I might be more open with her. We never ever talked when I was a kid, and she wonders why I never tell her anything :)|`|vwoqIUR6aa	spend some time with her. don't make her come out with it but just go out and have some dinner with her or something she likes and maybe you could casually bring it up and see if she tells you. I never told my mom anything at this age (not even about getting my period till she figured it out). I was never close to her because she never really spent time with me so I didn't tell her anything.

FmSWPS7Paa	intercourse is a natural method for inducing labour. sperm causes the cervix to dialate and orgasms also cause the uterus to contracct. hope this helps. 38 wks tried doing it but i dont work for me :(|`|JExgGpgyaa	They COULD be braxton hicks, they're common after sex|`|cEgI5ogLaa	It is pretty normal I already am having contractions after we have sex and I am only 27 weeks pregnant, my doctor said it was fine unless they lasted longer than an hour, I had more than 6 in an hour, or if my water broke ect.

jPnXGIZNaa	Hi, I am in a similar situation - my period was 4 days late so i took a test and it was positive, the next day it was negative! and soon after that i started to bleed/spot, so i though i had a chemical pregnancy. Anyways now i have been spotting for 13 days! so i went to the DR today and found out I am 6 weeks 3 days pregnany BUT my pregnancy is threatened because of the bleeding. My DR booked me for an ultra sound in a few days so we can go from there.<br>  <br>  So I would maybe go see your DR to found out what is happening. <br>  They say bleeding in early pregnancy is not normal but is common. and after me reading all day today about threatened pregnacies sounds like they are about a 50/50 shot..<br>  <br>  Good luck and baby dust. I hope everything turns out ok for you!! fingers crossed.|`|jzAfst8Taa	may have been implantation bleeding take a test first thing tomorrow morning ...good luck and keep us posted

TQScv7Tcaa	I didnt take Charleigh off formula until she was just over 12 months and even then i choose to giv eher toddler formula mixed with milk as it has alot more nutrients etc in it. I also still fed Charleigh her bottles until she was about 14 maybe even 15 months (she only had a night time bottle then). Have you tried the sippy straw cup with formula??? He will learn in his own time. You can also try adding milk/formula to his foods to attribute to his daily intake of milk like cereal in the morning, even adding milk to his vegies or whatever else he is eating. I started adding milk to Charleigh foods at about 9 months and at 11 months i started giving her half and half bottles and just after 12 months i stopped day bottles all together and just made sure she drank/ate alot of dairy rich foods like milk/cheese/yogurt etc and she still had (and even now at nearly 18 month) her night bottle. I know many people who's children still have a night bottle at 2 + so dont worry yourself to much about it now. Charleigh is the same when it comes to drinking out of sippy cups, she will have a bit here and there but doesnt drink a whole lot in one go hence why i still give her the bedtime bottle. Good luck he will get there eventually :)|`|fVRsIPOGaa	You can start introducing your baby to cow's milk, but it is necessary for him to drink his formula until his first birthday because nothing else will provide the vitamins that it has, which your baby needs.|`|nD7cDm8zaa	My kids' pediatrician follows the AAP recommendations which is that babies should not transition to whole milk till age 1.  A suggestion would be to start giving him small amounts of formula in a sippy cup with snacks or meals. As he gets older and is introduced to more table foods his need for so much formula will naturally decrease. Also, don't be afraid to talk to the pediatrician.  That's what they're there for!|`|KICQQxLxaa	If he is only 10 months, there is no rush to get him off formula if he isn't ready.  There is really no rush.  Keep offering his sippy cup with formula/milk in it, and he will get the hang of it soon.<br>  <br>  My daughter never held her own bottle.  I kept her on formula in a bottle until she was a bit over a year.  I then just started putting milk into the sippy cup.|`|OLW0Irbhaa	You don't want to go with cow's milk until at least 12 months of age.  It doesn't have everything they need like breastmilk or formula does.  Just keep working with him on the sippy.  Put warmed formula in it and see if that helps him take it better in the sippy.  Start transitioning from the bottles sooner rather than later.  And yes they do need a certain amount of breastmilk or formula plus solids per day.

fa9d70ab8c4bfd6107b08fab836a98ceaa	wow. well first of all congrats. Secondly, the blood alone could be from the speculum that you had done today. Often, towards the end of pregnancy, even being checked can cause a small bleed. Emphasis on the word small. Any bleeding that doesn't stop or that is accompanied with cramps should be reported. A lot of what you are describing is normal, you are getting closer to the end of your pregnancy and your back will hurt and you may also have increased braxton hicks. All of your symptoms are normal, unless you feel bad or you notice painful contractions (that don't stop) or cramps. Any time you have a concern, you should check with your doctor, but alot of your symptoms are a normal sign of the end of your pregnancy.|`|s2fQf3LXaa	I was reading what to expect just a couple hours ago and saw where it said that small amounts of bleeding in 2nd and 3rd trimester are considered ok. That's because the vagina and uterus are expending and thinning to allow for an easier delivery|`|Nhje1U06aa	Its all normal. just be sure to trust your instincts especially with delivery!   I am not trying to scare you , but i just had a friend who delivered on saturday and it was not good..The baby got stuck in her pelvis. <br>  <br>  Good luck|`|r4E2zXL8aa	everything's fine! you need to calm down and relax! yes i had spotting from the speculams when i had it and my baby was fine. take a chill pill and enjoy the last 8 weeks of your pregnancy!
OLW0Irbhaa	She apparently had funds from "disability" payments when she was supposedly injured on the job in like 1999.  And no, it's not cheap here.  The initial round, drugs, etc is 25-30,000.|`|dPmK83UYaa	She had money from Disability cuz she got hurt at work. And I think she used some of this to pay for it.|`|w9jx0JYLaa	she hurt her back at work and got a bunch of money a few years ago
JExgGpgyaa	It sounds like it COULD be your mucus plug, but it can release itself upto 2 weeks before labor.<br>  <br>  I'd ring your midwife or something just to ask.|`|K1lRZmxXaa	how far along are you it actually sounds like a miscarriage to me|`|AA10289637	u should see the doctor immidiately as there was blood in it. or consult a doctor soon. dnt wait....
vOomJtbsaa	Give away candy, cookies, you can even make some stuff yourself!   And yes it's great not to have games.  I had a co ed shower as well with around 60 men and women and there were no games, and people loved it.  I've never liked playing games, I specifically asked for one thing at my bridal shower 2 weeks ago and that was no games LOL!|`|aLAmvX5Naa	I think its just fine to skip games. No one likes them anyway. And as for gift bags, just give some candies.|`|7oF2o4q5aa	I threw my niece her shower and we didn't play the games.  It had a more open house type feel to it and it was nice for a change.  We had door prizes that were won, if I remember right, by whomever uttered the secret words (baby, mother, Emma, daddy, etc.) and it was in May so we just gave away Gerbera daisies by buying a large one and dividing it into tiny pots painted in the nursery color scheme.  We used these to decorate the tables initially - double duty.  Just a thought - you could get packets of Baby's Breath seeds for like 10 for a $1 and just put the packet of seeds in little clay pots (also so many for $1) and tie them with a baby themed ribbon.  Everyone was relieved not to have to play those goofy games.|`|XRLbqtUbaa	You can not play games if u want, but how r u going to keep everyone entertained?  R u just going to eat and open gifts?  Prizes don't have to be expensive...dollar store baby!  Same thing for the gift bags...I didn't have gift bags at mine, because we did games and prizes...u would spend more on 50 gift bags than on, say, 5-10 prizes.<br>  <br>  I just went to a shower and a raffle was done for everyone who brought diapers and 3 names were chosen, and they received a gift.<br>  <br>  BUT, if u would like to do gift bags, they had a sucker, a pencil, and bubblegum cigar in the gift bags...along with some mints on the table (as decoration).  They don't have to be real expensive...gift bags should be for those that attend...men and women.|`|OHq5gSjJaa	Well if it was my shower I would be sad if there wasn't any games.  I feel like most people look forward to the games at the showers.  That's just my opinion...  sorry!  However there are a few people like yourself who don't care for them.  Why don't you ask the mommy to be how she feels about them?  That way she can let you know if it is something that is important to her or not.  If it is then you could just do one or two games, which doesn't have to have any cost besides a small prize.  <br>  As for gift bags what about just small bags of blue or pink jelly beans?|`|heDtLdz5aa	i didn't have any games at my shower...the only thing that my husbands aunts had planned was who ever said baby would lose a clothes pin..( all they did was buy a bunch of cheap clothes pins or even plastic fake safety pins and tied them around a string..who ever ended up with the most pins won the game...but they didn't win an item..just something fun to do|`|zReKPmgJaa	I had a rather large babyshower myself.  Men, women and children included.  I really didn't want to play games, but was told it was common practice.  My mother and I picked out 2 games... a "scratchoff" and a baby bingo game.  We didn't realize that we were supposed to put the bingo game together until we were getting ready to play at the shower.  So, all we did was the scratchoff game.  It took me FOREVER to open all the presents anyhow... I do not personally think you HAVE to play games.  It's a new day and age... I don't think anyone will be dissapointed if you don't have games.|`|6098ebd9c2c175997bc815b09ad17e01aa	alot of the times i would think guys dont even want to attend. thats my honest opinion. when i had mine, no men showed up. i didnt invite alot either but none showed. its more of a girl thing. most men dont want to stand around and listen to women talk. its ok if you dont have games. i didnt. most people want it done and over. you may give gift bags to both , or just to the women.|`|CVtmd0h3aa	Sure it is o.k..  <br>  For the bags:  Candles, fold up fans, candy inside of baby bottles, pink nail polish if the expected baby is a girl; blue nail polish if it is a boy, maybe a copy of the baby's ultrasound (can get this done at walmart- .15 cents), not sure what else.  We never gave bags out.|`|c7XrBgz2aa	Ask the mother|`|7pYVDyfUaa	You should really include games.  <br>  <br>  There are some really cheap games.  For example:<br>  <br>  Searching for safety pins in rice.  Take a bucket/bowl of rice and place a bunch of safety pins inside and see who can pull the most out *while blinded folded* In say one minute.<br>  <br>  Match the baby animal to it parent- Do some research and find out the baby names for various animals.  For example a baby deer is a fawn.  A baby goose is a gosseling.  There are some that are rather hard out there too.  Mix some easy ones with some hard ones.  Come up with like 25-50 give or take.<br>  <br>  Baby word jumble- Do a search online or just make one up.  Take a bunch of baby words, such as rattle, bottle etc.  Mix up the letters and then give people five minutes to unscramble as many as possible.<br>  <br>  Gift bingo-  Make up a bingo chart.  Have people then fill in what gifts they think the guest of honor will get.  As the guest of honor opens presents the people will mark on their bingo card.  The first to get a bingo wins.<br>  <br>  Door prize/thank you card "game"- have everyone fill out THEIR address on an envelope, *for the mama to be to send thank you back in*  then have the mother to be draw one from a hat, that person gets a prize.<br>  <br>  You don't have to spend much on prizes, and in fact could skip the goody bags and by the door prizes.  The bags are a nice idea, but can get expensive, and I've never been to a shower where you get one.<br>  <br>  Good Luck.|`|nD7cDm8zaa	With so many people (ie - gifts to open) you prob. wouldn't have time to do games anyway.  A favor idea someone did at a shower I went to was to make a donation to a charity favored by the couple (or mom to be).  St. Jude's or March of Dimes are two good ones because they help kids.  Instead of a favor, everyone just got a little note (typed on the computer, on colored paper).  I think it said "A donation on your behalf was made to ... One of so & so's favorite charities. For more information on the work they do see www...." They did not however put the amount of the donation that was made.  I don't think that's needed anyway.  If you're expecting 50 guests and you did a $25 donation that's about what you'd prob. spend on a favor anyway.|`|nIE5Qtiqaa	I think it would be just fine to skip out on the games. As far as gift bags go, just give one item as apposed to a gift bag. I am planning my own shower by choice and I am either going to make home made betty crocker cookies and cut them into cute shapes like bears or duck, put them in celophane, then tie a blue or pink ribbion at the top and attach a cute message with a hole punch. You could say "Its a girl (or boy) thanks for coming to (insert mother to be's name here) baby shower and then list the date. You could also print out those same messages on blue or pink paper maybe add a picture that is cordnated with the theame and wrap them around Hershey bars. Hope this helps!!!|`|zSEJC6vZaa	Food is a great favor - buy bulk from Costco or Sam's Club.  Do a gift bag per couple.  Or, buy cheap little potted flowers, use as decor and the give them away as favors.  People are there to celebrate with the couple and won't care what the favors are really.  <br>  <br>  Games are overrated.  If you really want to do something, do an activity where the guests make something to give to the parents-to-be.  For example, at a shower I just threw, the guests decorated onesies for the parents.  Have each guest bring a plain white onesie and you provide the art supplies.<br>  <br>  With such a large crowd, people will be busy eating and socializing so games and activities aren't really necessary.  Opening gifts will probably take up most of the time.   <br>  <br>  You're a saint for hosting such a large party!|`|cHaLQVVFaa	If you don't do games you don't necessarily need gift bags for the guests. If you don't want to do games throw together a slide show of pics of the expecting mom for some entertainment. I wouldn't do gift bags for anyone but the mom to be. And you don't have to do games but you need to have some sort of other entertainment. I myself have hosted 12 baby showers. I love them and you don't have to do games.<br>  Good Luck!!!<br>  Cheap stuff for bags if your hell bent on doing those. I would just go to your local dollar store and say 2-5 items per bag and call it good.

7rKUmK0qaa	try to take off 2 days before her due date and whatever days that the baby isnt there yet, use your sick days so you wont lose a pay. The first 7 days the state wont pay you anyway thats why you are better off using your sick leave during your first wk off. <br>  Ask your employer if you can take off earlier if she gives birth sooner..<br>  Goodluck|`|HEdGGmkhaa	When baby is ready to come, baby comes lol I wish I had a crystal ball but I don't, if the first was induced early, was there a reason for it (Of course there was lol but I have no clue what it was) This one may be on time, or late....<br>  My first was early, second was late, I have never been induced....<br>  <br>  You will bet your life baby will come in the middle of the night when you have work the next morning :o)  I'm sure they will understand.<br>  <br>  Why don't you book your week a few days after her due date?|`|nfLyS1toaa	its hard to tell, with my first i was 2 weeks early and with my second i was 3 weeks early. is there anyway you can tell your human resource officer if it would be possible for it to go into effect when the baby is born. maybe you can already have paper work filled out and when the baby is born they can submit them through.|`|Nhje1U06aa	How soon do you have to let them know , I would wait until 34 weeks to see how its going . i would probably go a few days after. It is rare when we deliver on the due date<br>  congrats !!!|`|7EOLTC20aa	Is your wife's doctor talking about inducing her again?  If so, then you should have a better idea of when to take that leave.  If not, how soon do you have let your employer know what days you want off?  Most doctors will let you go into labor anytime up to 2 weeks before and 1-2 weeks after the due date, so there is 3-4 week period that your wife could naturally have this baby.  Honestly, your guess is as good as ours on this one.  Your wife should be seeing her ob/gyn on a very regular basis, they should be checking her at these appointments soon for thinning and dialation, that should give you a better guess as to how soon this could happen.  Did you talk to your employer about this?  Most employers know how unpredictable this can be for an expecting mother (to request a maternity leave) and for an expecting father as well to make sure he is there for his wife and new baby.  I know my husbands employer has told him that when he gets the call from me, if he should be at work, he is to leave immediately and they will see to it that his paid time leave covers the days he will be gone, including the day he would need to leave early if it would happen that way.  But everyone is different I guess.  I really don't have a good guess for you as to what you should do.  Talk to your wife and see what she says and how she feels, and talk to your employer and see what you can work out with them too.  Good luck!|`|aBWu7tyHaa	I know you want a better answer than this, but I have THREE kids and trust me, they are ALL different.  Nobody can predict when a baby is going to make it's big entrance into the world.  I would wait until it gets a little closer, the dr.'s can tell you things like how far dialated she is or isnt and how much effaced she is or isn't.  They will be able to determine if they think it's going to be any day now or not.  Being that she was induced the first pregnancy, the second could go either way.  With all three of mine they were completely different.  My second was induced early and the other two came on their own about two weeks early so you just never know.  I'd say when it gets a little closer the dr.'s could tell you more and you could go from there.|`|AA11368796	Wait til she's about 38 weeks. It has been my experience that it will come when you are not expecting it. I also know that sex induces labor so if you want to try to push for the due date, then don't touch her lol. <br>  She will have a lot of braxton hicks contractions before she has a real contraction. Again this is personal experience not to be taken as fact for all.|`|UDqGezOnaa	I think you should be with her all week because her labor pains will be growing during the final weeks or days so she'll probably need her husband there with her.|`|smISvK1Zaa	Call your Kid "Knight of the wind"|`|jRqN060Xaa	I say a week
MFKgVsoAaa	maybe you can have a combination of both names? i know it sounds weird, but you could do one of those things where for example if J's last name is like "apple" and R's is "banana", you could have it as "apple-banana", or you could even have a combination, like "appana" or "banapple". i know that sounds super cheesy, but my aunt did a similar thing for her twin daughters- both her and her best friend really wanted children but wanted to live independent lives, so they just had the twin girls and they both act as parents for them, and the girls' last name is a combination of both my aunt's name and the father's. this could work because it would include both names, plus it would be like a representation of how you belong to both families, your two lives coming together. you can ask them what they think, but remember that the final decision is yours, though you want to make sure that it's not something that becomes such a huge deal to the point where it creates some silly conflicts. hope i helped, and good luck!|`|iG6ksSpHaa	It sounds like you want to change your name to your brother R's name. But, just do what you think is right. I don't think anyone would be really offended by changing your name to the name of someone who practically raised you.|`|zSEJC6vZaa	Get your brother J to change his last name to something that you both like.  Then you can hypenate it with your brother R's last name.|`|mNVipd2Maa	I'd change it to R's name|`|HOdblqIkaa	if i were you i would keep your last name but thats just my personal decision. my sister was adopted by her step dad but kept our dads name instead and when she got married she hyphenated our last name and her new husbands. if you dont want to pass on your last name when you get married and start a family you could always take her last name or give your children her last name. you will all still be a legal family but youll just be the odd man out. if you dont like that thought then maybe you should change to your brothers name. it sounds like the only reason you arent is for your other brother but that is his decision to keep the name. it really up to you if you want to change it or not but if you do people wont associate the name with you. a friend did that, changed her name when her parents got divorced to her moms maiden name and nobody calls her by her legal last name although she changed the name years ago (used to have the last name Ive... and changed it to  Che...., but everyone still calls her by the Ive...name)<br>  in the end its up to you and what you think is right. no one can make the decision for you.
3MbAa1PHaa	birth control totally messed my body up. I quit taking it last August and still have not had a period on my own without the help from provera (the medicine that jump starts your period).. I will never go on BC again!! Hope your periods get regular soon.. and if they don't, go see the Gyn and they can get you on some provera or another med to regulate them! good luck!|`|aa01690707f25106fb64b7b4af022300aa	i hate bc|`|fa9d70ab8c4bfd6107b08fab836a98ceaa	brown could be a sign of a clot, which is a normal thing that you pass during your period. if you feel fine, i wouldn't worry. keep checking for pregnancy and if it persists, see your doctor.
b46KQFtBaa	He sounds like a jerk! I know how you must feel. I understand you don't want to be the one to tell her but I think you have to. It doesn't seem like he cares anymore and so he doesn't deserve her. I would tell her.|`|AusPef8Yaa	You should tell your friend. There is no point to having a boyfriend that doesn't even care anymore.|`|cbEOXkugaa	If he doesn't care, your friend should get rid of him.

wObFm9B4aa	pretty good chances
HOdblqIkaa	assuming the 14 year old has custody of the child then yes the 27 year old would have to pay child support. they would have to go to court, prove they are the parents to the child, and chances are the 27yo would be going to jail because having sex with a minor is illegal. but even in jail you have to pay child support. if you dont have a job in jail then the bills just pile up and you have to pay them when you get out. cant pay them when your out? you go back to jail. kind of a vicious circle. and i dont see why someone would want to have a child with someone 13 years older/younger than them.|`|8SjoUQmEaa	The 27 year old would be going to jail.|`|X67Y1BACaa	Well yes, once he got out of jail for raping a 14 year old.|`|5tqh0akYaa	yes if he went to court and possibly arrested for rape, your sick|`|CdJtH0xdaa	Unless he signed off his rights as a parent, then yes, he has to pay child support if he doesn't already go to jail for rape.|`|qP081wfvaa	okaaay <br>  hoping this is hypothetical <br>  he would first go to jail for rape<br>  or having sex with a minor<br>  and i guess he would<br>  but that guy would be a sick man<br>  thats disgusting<br>  why would yu ask that question|`|AMyH091Taa	First off he will be in jail! So thats a little messed up of the guy, Having a kid with a 14 year old.. **** the 14 year old could be his kid!|`|AusPef8Yaa	That's illegal...He can go to jail.<br>  I'm pretty sure he has to pay, though.|`|mUIMF3hnaa	yes.<br>  if they signed the birth certificate.<br>  but that's called pedophilia....|`|it3GnvdDaa	yes and he will also go to jail for sleeping with a 14 yr old|`|ameJkDgpaa	the 27 year old is a pedophile and should be in jail|`|cUtn9Wb3aa	he would go to jail because thats statatory rape.|`|ZDB9Jermaa	all non-custodial parents have to no matter how old they are.If the parents of the 14 year old don't put your *** in jail for statutory rape they will if you fail to support the child.|`|qPZ5poEHaa	Yes, he would still be legally responsible for the child even if it was the result of statutory rape.  He may have to wait to get out of jail before he can start making payments though.|`|bOfgQzTWaa	the 27 yearold should be in jail and yes i have a friend and her mom was 13 and her dad was i think 21 so yeah he has to pay child support|`|b0Z8c6wJaa	Yes, and that's just wrong too. They might have to go to jail for doing that.|`|mNVipd2Maa	IDK but he would go to jail for "Rape"|`|aLAmvX5Naa	Yes, when the 27 year old got out of jail he would definately need to pay child support and back child support.|`|OLW0Irbhaa	Well, it's hard to pay child support when you are in jail for statutory rape.

CdJtH0xdaa	Just tell her you want to shave, and ask if you can buy a razor. Shaving is natural for teenage boys (assuming you are one), so you should just ask for a razor. Then, tell her that it embarrasses you when she says "You're growing up" and ask her to stop telling everyone she knows. Parents are embarrassing like that.|`|Jucak0HLaa	Mom,I need to shave.|`|vGxipYJnaa	Sometimes us mothers forget that you aren't five anymore.

CdJtH0xdaa	You just sit them down and tell them. They will most likely be angry, but the anger will subside. What you should do is sit them down after dinner, and then tell them that you're pregnant, and don't say much more. If they ask questions, answer them, such as what you're going to do about the baby, and whether you're keeping it or not, etc. Good luck to you!|`|5tqh0akYaa	"I made a mistake but i really need your support right now, mom, dad im pregnant" goodluck|`|HOdblqIkaa	first take a test and find out if you are or not. theres no sense in going to your parents before you even know. once you know and if you are then go to your parents, sit them down and say "im pregnant" its really not as hard as you think it will be.|`|AA11490722	it's going to be hard for you to tell them- but it is important that you do.<br>  It might be easier if you and your boyfriend do it together. Just tell you parents you want to have an important talk to them and then you and your boyfriend sit down and tell them together.<br>  Yes your parents might be angry or upset- but it is important to remember that they love you and want what is best for you. In the long run they will be glad you were mature enough to sit down with them and tell them. <br>  Good luck with it|`|MFKgVsoAaa	well first of all make sure that you do it privately- sit them down and tell them you have something important to talk to them about. don't even try the whole "i have a friend who thinks she's pregnant, what should she do?" or something. if you want them to help you out and give you su[[port, you have to show them that you're responsible, and a responsible person doesn't try to wiggle their way out of a situation- they take responsibility for their actions, even if it might be hard. tell them that you are having a tough time now because you're afraid that you've maid a horrible mistake and that you might be pregnant. tell them that you know it's stupid and irresponsible, but you're taking responsibility of your actions and are treating the situation as an adult, and that even though you know that what might be happening can and will be hard, you're fully committed to doing the best you can to go through with it and make the best out of the situation, and that you hope they could support you. i've never been in that kind of situation, and i know it's probably not gonna go down exactly like that, but you get the idea- if you want to be treated like an adult, you have to act like an adult. show them that you're going to try you're best, and ask for their support and understanding. hope i helped, and good luck!!!|`|SPPfUgpyaa	im 17 and a junior and i just found out i was pregnant. its hard to tell them but my dad kicked me out but my mom wants me to stay here...i am now with my boyfriend and we are working hard to pay the bills....it is hard but its fun to decorate the babys room and learning to be an adult.|`|aSuLnvoSaa	well take a test first, jesus!|`|F7tyzrMzaa	First of all you learn how to spell PREGNANT....<br>  <br>  Then you get a pregnancy test and take it.

z6IekuwSaa	I would expect you to conceive in Sept when you had sex. Is this a trick Q?|`|OLW0Irbhaa	Umm, gee, SEPTEMBER maybe?  If you had sex around the time she could have been dropping eggs.|`|2Hot9EJiaa	If you only had sex in Sept. and she is not pregnant now, she will not be pregnant from that sexual encounter.  Anyone would now that - you say you are married- how old are you?  Young teens now the answer to this one!|`|qxy9xCAsaa	Huh?!?!  If you've only had sex once and it was in the month of September, the only month you could have conceived would have been September.  If you want a baby, I think you need to do it more often.  And even if you don't want a baby, I think you need to do it more often ;-)|`|MHeOHOnbaa	I agree with Doula Valerie|`|WWcaKZ7Qaa	What? This question is very confusing! You need to clarify what you are asking here. Did she get pregnant in Sept.? If so, that's when she conceived. Or are you asking when she would be due if you conceived in Sept.?|`|8ae9CGqcaa	That depends. IF she conceived sometime during the beginning of September, she would be due sometime in the beginning of June. But IF she conceived more during the end it would be sometime in July.<br>  EDIT: I see now that you asked when she would conceive if you had sex once in September. <br>  If she did get pregnant, you could expect her to conceive immediately. But, your chances are slim, unless you both are extremely fertile. And you would know if she was pregnant by now.<br>  And you wouldn't know that unless you saw a doctor, or had many children.<br>  You'll want to continue the mating process, if you want to have a higher chance of having a baby.|`|azE51WGRaa	Um...if you had sex in september, then you'd expect her to conceive in september. Usually that's how it works. If you mean when would she me due then she'd be due to have a baby between june-july (all depends when she conceived).|`|SHXvUSd4aa	conception can only happen when you have sex - she would have known by October if she conceived or not|`|JlG8XgDvaa	Well, depending on whether it was close to the end of september or not, it will be june maybe even july. I got impregnanted on August 20-ish and Im due around May 22nd if that helps.|`|9bPzzoIFaa	in september....<br>  unless you had sex the 29th or 30th, then conception could of occured oct 1,2 or 3rd... sperm can live and swim around in a womans body for 3 days.|`|SZAGOYMYaa	Silly lady. You only had sex once and now you think you have baby?|`|RxhBUkwSaa	It'd be September.  Unless sex was on September 30... by the dates her doc gives her, it could be a week or so later than the date of sex, but not months.|`|AA10289637	it depend on the cycle of her period. if u had it during the ovulation time than within one week she will be expecting. its good to ask her when she had her last period. & at which date u had sex.|`|8Og11giIaa	If your asking when she would have fallen pregnant then id say september - unless it was towards the end of sept, it usually takes about a week for an egg to implant itself. But she would have been able to find out about 4 weeks after this (so in october).<br>  <br>  If you mean when she would be due if she concieved in sept then you usually subtract 3 months and add 7 days from the first day of the last menstrual period. So depending on the date in sept id say sometime in June
MFKgVsoAaa	um, duh. everyone does! it really is normal, as long as you don't do anything with those thoughts that you'll regret later. you don't have to try to get them out of your mind, because you'll just end up thinking about it more. it's probably hormones, but also just general curiosity. it's something that goes on all around us, so it's really natural to be curious about it. if it's really bugging you, talk to a close friend or a sibling (probably sister) or a parent (probably mom), or if you don't feel comfortable doing that, maybe try a diary. hope that helps!|`|B1mEwSXWaa	My dear Stace....<br>  <br>  Sure, honey...in your present state of development the hormones are responsible for "all kind of things", babe !!!

jJLc6uG1aa	You don't have to.  My baby liked it on the cool side but they're all different.|`|V8GrFx0jaa	Most of us aren't warming it by the time they're one year old. You shouldn't be putting him on milk unless he is one, and at that age you definitely don't need to be warming it.|`|xtmFBjO9aa	Yes.  You should definitely warm it atleast for a while...  After a while you will be able to give it to him cold.  You will just know when.|`|DYJOpfvraa	You may have to warm the milk if he's always been used to warm formula.

My Son still gets a "warm" bottle but his sippy cup is "cold" He so far has been pretty accepting.|`|CzKrqgmgaa	you dont need to... i still do for nap and bed time because it helps my son drift a little easier. cold milk tends to wake him up more|`|avx7bLnKaa	Depends on the child....|`|lDMg0rD3aa	I started giving my daughter whole milk the day after she turned 1. I still had some formula left to use up so I mixed it to start her off. I did like 2 oz milk with 5-6 oz formula and gradually increased the amount of milk. I used the powered formula so I used warm water to mix that and it took the chill out of the milk. She is now 1 year 1 month and only on whole milk which I still warm a little in the bottle warmer, and she only uses a sippy cup now as well. Hope this helps you.|`|CVtmd0h3aa	Actually we just slowly started making his formula colder.  We got it to where it was farily cool but not cold and then started slowly introducing cold milk.  Warm milk just sounded awful to me.  I couldn't imagine drinking it so we tried this and it worked fine.  Hope this helps.|`|EFA4cgrfaa	It completely depends on your son's preference.<br>  You do not need to warm it, but he may take the bottle easier if you make the temperature cooler gradually rather than just a straight transition.<br>  It is completely yours and your son's preference.|`|hYL6LJWeaa	It's easier to wean that way, and he will probably be more willing to take it if it's warm, but no you do not have to do it.|`|heDtLdz5aa	no..i never warmed my sons bottles either..i just gave the to him at room temp. he never had a problem with drinking the whole milk cold either|`|EsXe7S1oaa	thats up to your baby...my angel is picky and at 14 mo she still gets it warmed up...lol...

But DON'T let PETA guilt you into it - PETA kills more animals every year in their shelters (completely, perfectly adoptable animals!) then most anyone else. Their employees have killed more than 19,200 dogs, cats, puppies, and kittens since 1998. On top of that, two employees who were running a 'spay and neuter' truck for strays are being tried for animal cruelty.<br>  <br>  petakillsanimals.com - do some research.

But if you're a big fan of it, i've heard it can be difficult. Don't try cutting out all your meats at once. Start with one animal, and then work your way through until you're no longer eating them. Also understand the many different types of vegetarians, vegans, etc. and that there are other decisions to make as well. Gelatin is made out of animal bones and animal tissue, so you'll have to decide if jello/certain candies/etc. are going to be cut from your diet.<br>  I also don't eat certain candies or use certain products that were tested on animals. There is a lot of thinking to do before you just jump into decisions. I researched and such for about 5 months before becoming a vegetarian, but maybe that's just because i like to analyze everything, ahha.<br>  <br>  Good luck(:<br>  Feel free to email me if you need any help or questions answered.|`|frF8iljpaa	simple answer is, if you dont want to eat something it will be easy to stop. if you want to eat something, its going to be hard to stop.<br>  <br>  try eating boca, morning star or quorn products. <br>  <br>  PETA are hypocrites - educate yourself before you start to support them as an organization.<br>  <br>  im a vegetarian (used to be vegan) and im an animal rights activist.|`|XCzpQvDvaa	PETA is an extremist organization that develops propaganda videos to support their own agendas.

FlVLN3Ehaa	Nobody likes changing nappies. Does your hubby change them? Does he like changing them? Does that make him a bad daddy? Some women like breastfeeding. I don't really, but do it anyway. No one likes doing it while it is hurting. You're still recovering and need a bit more help, that's all. It will get better eventually, but eventually could be months away. Get yourself on some iron supplements. That'll help.|`|2arZOZWgaa	Your husband's expectations are too high.  If he *thinks* he would love to do all those things, then he needs to start doing it himself. Of course, he can't breastfeed, but he could be put on all-time-diaper-duty when he gets home from work. It still doesn't make up for the pain of recovery. Men just don't understand. I don't think there is any way to MAKE him understand. There is nothing that he could ever go through that would even compare. <br>  <br>  You should try to sit him down in an un-attacking matter and put on the table for him all the many things that you are trying to deal with. Tell him how hard breastfeeding is. Tell him how much pain you are dealing with. Tell him very specifically what he needs to do to help you overcome all these many obstacles. Set up some kind of baby care routine where the jobs are split more equally. I don't care if he goes to work and you are a stay at home mom. He helped you make that baby and you are therefore no more responsible for her well-being than he is.<br>  <br>  I was very pregnant taking care of a 10-11 month old and I absolutely dreaded changing her diaper. She is quite the squirmy little bugger and would kick my stomach! I had severe pelvic pain that made basic tasks unbearable (switching from my left side to my right side in bed for example). I had to run after her, save her from swallowing whatever was next, and try to make her as happy as possible. I remember how painful breastfeeding was (in tears many times) and I was suffering from depression on top of it. Once baby wakes up after a few weeks and starts crying more, and poor mom gets less and less sleep, and hungry little baby wants fed more and more, mom gets drained! It's not always fun and it's not always easy, but that doesn't mean you don't love your daughter and that having a baby is not worth all the time you put in. I remember wanting to put my boyfriend in a pregnant suit for just ONE day. I was in so much pain from my belly and all the weight I had gained (5'2 and 210 lbs @ birth), but that wouldn't even begin to harness the strain hormones put on you.|`|pXSKSS3daa	Well, I don't LOVE to change diapers and I personally don't know anyone that does.<br>  <br>  How old is your baby? Breastfeeding can be difficult at first. Make sure she's latched properly and you will both get the hang of it. If you feel like it's too hard then contact a lactation consultant.<br>  <br>  Are you on any iron pills for the anemia? I was anemic after my C-section so I know how you feel. Keep yourself well rested(as much as you an) and sleep when your little girl sleeps. <br>  <br>  The only thing I'd be concerned about is you saying your baby's cries are keeping you from sleeping. Unfortunately that is a newborn's only way of communicating with you. If this way of thinking doesn't lift then please talk to your doctor about possible PPD.|`|537fb036f0d7f523891b1281ae7d57d1aa	Im not sure who told you that you are suppose to like those things, there are even books on this like Baby Laughs and the Girlfriends Guides that go on how many women have these same feelings.<br>  <br>  The breastfeeding will likely get much better.  The diapers never.  And the crying maybe.  Last I checked, he's capable of taking care of the last two, and after week 4-6 you can pump and he can bottle feed.|`|oXzHvsBpaa	I had  a lot of pain after my delivery and I was sent home a day early. Only spending the night in the hospital once. It sounds like you are putting your baby first before yourself. Parenthood is filled with many sleepless nights. What are you going to do if your husband has to return to work. Are you going to get upset that the baby is crying? Everyone has gone throw this.|`|2Pp2cDbJaa	well if you cant breast feed use formula, weather or not you are tired has nothing to do with it you have a baby now, in pain or not in pain,and babies cry, thats just how it is. Yes your in pain, yes your tired, but thats motherhood, suck it up, those things have to be done. Your husband can help out but he shouldnt have to do everything, your gonna have to change diapers and feed the baby and sooth the crying and get up at night in pain or not in pain, maybe you and your husband can take turns, you get up, he gets up, you change a diaper, he changes a diaper, you feed, he feeds, that one you might have to do on your own if your gonna breastfeed =)|`|XOtOMncwaa	Sounds to me like your perfectly normal! I can honestly say I don't like to change my sons diaper. And I would prefer that they just came out potty trained, but I guess that would only happen in a perfect world right? And no one likes to hear a baby cry! Trust me, my sons 1 and it still gets to me when he cries! your trying to recover and it makes it alot harder when you have a little one to care for now. Once you recover it will be alot easier, but until then ask your husband to help out more and to stop criticizing. <br>  I was anemic when I had my son and it wasn't easy, finally I went to the doctor and they gave me meds which helped out alot better! There was one day that I couldn't even get out of bed, my fiance had to come home from work to take care of our son! Trust me it will get better, and don't feel bad because you don't like to do those things, no mother does. I'm sure the breastfeeding will become more enjoyable when you get the hang of it... but I have never enjoyed a cry or a diaper change, I just got used to it and it got easier, and I'm sure that will happen with you! Good luck and Congrats!|`|AA11600455	holy crap your husband is a jerk. my husband spoiled me after my c-section. he changed her, fed her, and everything. then when i was healed, i took over.|`|BfBMRlNNaa	It's understandable for you not to totally love doing those things right now. You are recovering from major surgery! What is important is that you are doing it, because that's what we as mothers do. We take care of the things that need to be done for the people we love. It doesn't matter if we are in pain or exhausted, we get up and we get the job done. Most men, and fathers, will not only not understand but they are also not likely to give you credit where credit is due. So I am here to tell you that you are doing a great job and I have no doubt that you love your daughter very much. As you have a chance to heal and get stronger I am sure that you will start to love being a mom and doing all those things!|`|Kj9GWZI7aa	You're a mom.<br>  It's not always glamourous.<br>  <br>  <br>  Honestly, I don't mind changing diapers or feeding in the slightest.<br>  But I remember in the very beginning it was difficult to nurse.<br>  <br>  No one LIKES to hear their baby cry.<br>  But if you're apathetic about it, I would talk to your doctor about baby blues and post partum depression.<br>  <br>  My friend got so exhausted and overwhelmed by motherhood that it didn't even bother her to hear her baby cry.<br>  <br>  Try and get some sleep and let hubby watch the baby<br>  Sleep deprivation makes everything 9432x times harder|`|TJ04fAgNaa	You're not a bad mom.  It sounds like you are dealing with the 'baby blues' or post partum depression.  Not feeling good, especially not being able to take pain meds after a major surgery, is enough to make anyone want to just be left alone!  My suggestion is that when you are feeling up to it, talk to your doctor about maybe getting some antidepressants or something to just get you through the next few months while you heal and adjust to your new life.  Best of luck to you and though you may not really feel congratulatory now, congrats on your new addition!|`|qKEKLOaEaa	your body is recovering from not only a major surgery but also a major hormonal change. It is normal to feel a little irritable at first and a lack of sleep doesn't help. That being said, if you start to get depressed or think about doing harm to yourself or your baby you need to call your doctor ASAP. Your husband needs to be a little more sympathetic to everything you have been through. Ask if he wouldn't mind helping out a little with diapers and feedings so that you can get a little rest here and there. As you begin to heal from surgery it will get easier.<br>  Good luck!
OaOf4oxQaa	I don't think she's pregnant. Tell her to relax, and you have to wait about 10 more days after you are supposed to get your period to get tested.|`|o0MQRIIKaa	okay well...<br>  first it depends if her boy friend did ***.<br>  if so that really matters.<br>  if he pulled out before he still most likely did have pre ***.<br>  the best thing is to go to a place like planned parent hood where they dont notify parents.|`|UMoeNvr4aa	she must stop warring maybe she to stress tell her to let go of the past maybe she can be relived|`|kgcTdberaa	stop being scared and by a test, go to a female cashier. who cares what they think!|`|tMeN2fm0aa	Pre-*** is actually more potent than actual ejaculation.  And the fact that she her period is late, I would def worry too.  Stress could be a factor, but then again alot of things could change a womans period.... and the fact that she is so young, who is to say that it is normal and regular right now anyways.  If you have the money, I would say forget the embarrassment and go get a test.  If you dont have the money, go to a health clinic in your area... you should be able to get them done for free there.  Good luck.  With her being so young, I hope that she is NOT pregnant, but if she is, I am sure that things will be ok.  Things happen, and people survive.  that is the way of the world.  Good luck!  I really hope the best for yall!

AA10358331	You really can't get a positive test until you miss your period. The hormone is the strongest the morning of your missed period.

We were going to Florida, so I bought one *just in case* for the airport and to use in the parks.  It ended up being a lifesaver.<br>  <br>  She doesn't like her carrier anymore, and wants to walk everywhere.  I was afraid to let her walk with us in Sea World.  I was afraid she would see an animal and just run off.  It worked wonderfully at Sea World and another park we went to.<br>  <a href="http://i364.photobucket.com/albums/oo90/hkoziarz/IMG_3983.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i364.photobucket.com/albums/oo90/...</a><br>  <br>  I will only use it on a vacation like that, not if I am at the mall or something like that.<br>  <br>  ETA:  Yeah, I had the negative, knee jerk reaction before, No Way will my daughter EVER have one, until I realized how dangerous the world is, and how FAST my daughter is.  <br>  I love how people say " My child will listen" "They don't need that if they are disciplined"<br>  My DD is extremely well behaved, but come on, you can't trust a 2 year old in a crowded amusement park to listen to you at all times.|`|Me4kGy3Baa	<a href="http://www.munchkin.com/products/detail.html?section=prodCategories&ID=10008&pID=1288" rel="nofollow">http://www.munchkin.com/products/detail....</a><br>  <br>  This is the one I bought recently after answering "Hannah's Mommy's" question (sorry if it's the wrong name).  We used it a couple of times so far and my daughter, Bethany doesn't mind it.  I like how she walks beside me looking all independent and I know she's safe.  <br>  <br>  I bought this because I am pregnant and i was spotting recently.  Bethany is getting heavy for me to carry, and lugging the stroller in and out of the car was getting to be a huge pain in the ***.  Sometimes we just need to go to one store in the mall and if it's a short distance, i'll let her walk beside me with her harness.   <br>  <br>  I am almost 3 months pregnant, and I cannot run after her, I am not lazy.  I am being careful about my pregnancy while doing my best with a 16 month old.  I do not chat on my phone or talk to others, I watch my child.  I just cannot run after her anymore.  <br>  <br>  We are not always with Daddy.  I am usually out with my sister, who is in a wheelchair, she cannot exactly run after my baby for me!!!  Sometimes my sister's wheelchair gets caught around doorways, i have to help her, this is not easy with a stroller.  I always have to put the stroller aside to push the wheelchair through the door, or to hold open a door for her....those buttons on the sides of doors do not always work!!!  At least with the harness, i can help my sister and not worry about my little girl.<br>  <br>  I would rather have people think badly of me than to have something bad happen to my one and only precious baby girl.  I agree with the person who posted that we childproof our houses, strap our baby in carseats, highchairs, etc....so one extra measure of safety is nobody else's business.|`|WlU3NFu6aa	We have a backpack harness. I rarely use it. But we did use it at the zoo this past weekend. It was crowded, my daughter is 14 months and doesnt hold hands, and reasoning with her rarely works. <br>  And no I dont use it so I can do my own thing and not pay any attention to her. I use it so she cant run off far in crowded areas|`|7rCeCVl2aa	I tried it with my first 7 years ago at the zoo. He was notorious for bolting on me. It felt really weird and I ended up taking it off with in 10 minutes or so. I will not be using it for my second. I think it is easier just to hold their hand or use a stroller.|`|XOtHsTo0aa	Yes-I will be getting one for my daughter when she is walking.  I had them with my twins and they were life savers.  Especially in crowded areas-I felt much more secure using them.|`|a8IRxC4raa	We used a harness.  Our child was a darter, and could run faster than us.  That harness saved her life several times.<br>  <br>  All the best.|`|5bYpbodUaa	For me, it's not for an every day thing.  We bought that one (the monkey one shown in link), for when we went to Disneyland. That way our son couldn't accidentally get lost. We absolutely loved it. But that is the only time we used it. All other times, we just made sure we held his hand, and kept a good eye on him when we went out. <br>  <br>  When we took our son to Disneyland at age three, we used this, and yes we got some looks, and there was this one lady and her daughter talking crap about me using this on my son. I got in her face and told her, "BETTER SAFE THAN SORRY!!!! BETTER TO UTILIZE THIS SAFETY FEATURE, THAN TO HAVE MY SON KIDNAPPED, OR LOST!!!!".  She was in total shock that I even would confront her. But I did. NO ONE will talk crap about MY PARENTING, especially when it comes to my son's SAFETY, and not have me in their face!!!  I didn't yell at this lady, but I did say this in a stern voice, and then walked off. <br>  <br>  There are diverse opinions about using a leash. I believe this is awesome in congested areas like Disneyland, and I believe we should take advantage in keeping our children safe. There is no harm using this in such cases.  Now, as an every day thing, nah...I don't believe we need this. But it really is all up to the parent and their situation as to whether or not to use this.<br>  <br>  For me, it was a blessing and it helped a lot while we were at Disneyland.  :-)  We had also bought a pay as you go cell phone for our son too, and put it in the back of the monkey, and made a note stating to call this number if I'm lost.  Just another extra safety feature.<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT: For those comparing this new SAFETY feature, to a DOGS LEASH needs their head examined!!!!!!!  You do NOT treat your children as dogs, and just because you use this extra safety feature, does NOT in any way resemble them as dogs. AND if I come across any of you that says crap about me using one, I will be IN YOUR FACE TOO!  It's NOT YOUR BUSINESS to judge people using this safety feature!!!  YOU ALL ARE NOT LOOKING AT THE BIG PICTURE HERE!!!  OUR TECHNOLOGY HAS COME A LONG WAY WITH EVERYTHING IN THIS WORLD. There is NO harm in utilizing this safety feature for severe congested areas such as amusment parks, or zoo's or any where else! Children are FAST, and if you ever lost your child because you took a SECOND to look somewhere else, you will REGRET not using one of these!!!!!!  GITS!|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	My son was RUNNING at 9 months, he was never happy in a stroller and no longer wanted to be in a baby carrier.  Asking a child to hold their hand above their head for hours is cruel (give it a go I bet you don't make 15 minutes) and its unrealistic to expect a 9 month old to behave 100% of the time; nor can you pay attention to your child 100% of the time if you have two kids, or a kid and a dog, or anything at all distracting you like reading food labels.<br>  <br>  I also think its ridiculous to expect a child to stay in a stroller just because its convenient for mom -no wonder so many kids are obese!<br>  <br>  The "leashes" are excellent for any situation where a second can mean your child is in danger or lost.  <br>  <br>  Of course some people misuse them.  If you aren't paying attention to your child -that's just wrong.  Its to give you a second chance in case your child, not to prevent you watching your child to make sure they are safe and interacting with them.  If you are dragging your child along that's wrong.  <br>  <br>  For those that say its treating your child "like a dog" -I wouldn't walk a dog down a busy street without a leash because 1 second of disobedience could mean death.  Why would I love my child any less?|`|vOomJtbsaa	As I really don't like the idea of one, I also know that I'm not closed off to much being a parent, you do what works for the safety of your children.  And honestly it doesn't look like a leash for a dog, it looks like a funny little backpack with a string attached!  My son is only 6 months old, but I know if we're ever in a very crowded area it takes a split second for a child to be gone!  And it's not an issue of neglect, it happens to the best of parents.  My fiance and I live in LA, and I know that if we want to take Caleb to the zoo, disneyland, museums in downtown area.... it's a very crowded, scary place to be at times and I'd much rather my son be safe and have people look at me like I'm a weirdo, than have my son be kidnapped, run off, get lost, fall, etc etc etc.  So I'm not closed off to the option.  We strap kids into carseats, strollers, we baby proof the house so they don't get hurt, why not be open to other precautions as well!?|`|sYjYbkvWaa	I have done this before when in a crowded area and my son was in the "I'm a big boy --you can't carry me faze." It isn't like it completely restrictive and if used correctly-- could help a busy mom out.|`|lGcpXteaaa	I have to say i am pretty shocked by some of these answers!<br>  I will definitely be using one if i am in a busy mall or fairground or anything.<br>  It is not like walking a dog, you do not pull them back if they pull forwards, you don't say 'heel' if they start to pull....it is to keep your baby safe.<br>  There are some sick people nowadays that would just love to grab your LO when your not looking for that mere *second*...<br>  If i can prevent another 'james bulger' incident..i will!<br>  <br>  I could not live with myself if anything like that happened to my daughter.|`|s6emVQleaa	I have used them with my daughter but she wasn't a big fan.  The reason she doesn't like it is exactly why we need it.  I applaud all the moms with perfect children who never leave their side.  I am not an inattentive or lazy mom.  I have a very active daughter who does not want to be held, dislikes her stroller, has no fear of anyone, and prefers to run from me at most given opportunities.  If someone wants to give me the magic key to keeping her by my side, great, I'll take it.  Until then, there are some kids who it is very helpful for.|`|Ud871v3paa	No, I will not be putting my son on a "LEASH" he will have one of those backpacks so I can keep track of him when we are at places like the fair, the mall or somewhere really crowded.  I think it is silly to have them just at the park or the grocery store but I totally understand having them where there is a rather large chance of him getting lost or taken.|`|OwLcbnTvaa	Nope i do not like them at all.|`|xnhwmontaa	I have the same one. We use it in the airports. my daughter was two but loved to walk. I was scared of her getting away from me in the busy airport. She loved her freedom and at the same time I loved the security. It's not mean or anything. It's not like putting her in a collar around her neck. I didn't get any dirty looks only "aww"s and smiles.|`|AA10953561	Those things are life savers! Both of my nieces and my nephew have all worn these. Mostly we use them when we're in a crowded place like the zoo or an airport. It's easier than carrying them everywhere, but it also gives you some control over where they go and how far they can go. <br>  <br>  We went to the zoo one time and saw all these children climbing on the fence to the polar bear exhibit. My niece was two at the time and made a bee-line for the fence because she wanted to see what all the other kids were looking at. She moved really fast and if we hadn't had the leash on her she could have easily climbed the fence and fallen into the enclosure. <br>  <br>  Of course, these leashes don't make up for bad parenting. You shouldn't put your child on a leash simply because they don't listen, but there's always that odd case where a child will think for themselves and before you know it they've disappeared on you. I completely plan on getting one for my daughter (she's still in the womb).|`|fIDWcViHaa	My mother made the decision 19 years ago to put me on when when I was two after I walked up to a stranger a few feet from my mom and said "Hi! Take me home!" She turned around just as she heard me say "me  home" and grabbed me. <br>  <br>  Personally, if I have a child that is as outgoing as I was at the age and fearless of strangers, I would consider putting a harness on them. It's just a safety precaution, the world is changing rapidly and you never know what could happen. It's best to be optimistic, but take precautions.|`|8ab40e110856e04b57a0ea78b7f1ea14aa	I took a quick look at some of your answers, didn't really read any of them the whole way through.<br>  I can see that there are passionate people for and against the use of the 'baby leash'<br>  <br>  My (now 7 year old) Daughter was walking at age 8 1/2 months, and running at 9.<br>  She was quite a handful..<br>  However, she knew (because she was taught) to stay close to Mommy.<br>  Well behaved, and I know I was lucky!<br>  <br>  When I felt the need to use something to 'harness' her, I made my own.<br>  What I did was take strips of cardboard, fitted to each of our wrists, and covered them in soft fleece, that had heavy velcro clasps to keep them on.<br>  I then took elastic(sewing grade) and made a 'string' between us.<br>  That way she felt like she had her space to walk, but I could get her close to me if I needed it.<br>  <br>  It didn't look like I was walking my child like  a dog.. it looked like we were walking with each other..<br>  <br>  everyone does what works for them,and no one should chastise anyone else for what they have to do!!!|`|gJrHBtp1aa	My husband is convinced he's going to get one for our son. I flat out refuse in normal situations. I keep telling my hubby that our son is a human NOT a  dog. I can understand using it in crowded area's like disney world, but in normal out and about situations its down right disgusting.|`|LbkLg4RFaa	I know my mother did with my older brother when she was pregnant with me and couldn't chase him.  If she didn't there is a very good chance he wouldn't be here now.  She did run into a lot of negative comments and abuse from others particularly people who weren't parents and parents of infants that weren't of walking age.  <br>  <br>  If I needed to I would have no problem using one.  Yes of course I will teach my son to do the right thing and not to wander but it isn't always possible to reason with a child that's 18 months old either or reasonable to expect they spend an hour or more in a stoller.  It can take just a momentary lapse in concentration for a child to be hit by a car or kidnapped.  Why wouldn't I want to prevent that?|`|ce437eacba23b245ed5c4ee833f7b13daa	I don't use them, and honestly before I had kids I thought they were horrible, but now I can understand why some parents would feel the need for it.  Better to be safe then worry about the kid being hurt if they are overly rambunctious or prone to running off.|`|lWUknox6aa	I wasn't going to, but since my 17 month old is constantly running away from me, I might do it just for her safety.  I'd rather have her safe and near me then running off.  I got her the pink piggy one. Haven't used it yet..but today might be the day I get it out.|`|oEfnqmp3aa	They make leashes for kids now? Great! I'd totally get one of those. But then again this is also part of why I plan to avoid being a parent.<br>  <br>  <br>  Falling and getting hurt, running off and getting lost, wandering and getting into trouble ... I do suppose that I think these are important to a kid though. Learning pain and suffering allows pursuit of the opposite. A parent maintaining perfect sight and control of their child ... I'd say that this is instead harmful to the child's growth.<br>  <br>  However when it comes to parenting I'd say its hard to designate what's good and bad. I'd have to say what is, is.|`|dPmK83UYaa	I used one when in the airport, cuz that's a scary place for a kid to run off, especially since i was holding my baby in a sling and I couldn't just bust out sprinting after my toddler. It was just easier. It really depends on if your child listens well to the word "stop" like if he's gonna fall down a flight of stairs or try to go on the escalator "all by himself" this has happened to me!! Scary. He got scared and just fell, good thing he didn't get hurt but it scared the daylight savings outta me.|`|CzKrqgmgaa	I can understand the pros of something like this if you lived in a large centre where kidnappings happened often...<br>  <br>  but i live in a small town and there just isn't a need for one. i honestly would feel absolutely terrible putting one on my son!|`|9EW08emXaa	I have one. <br>  <br>  I never thought I would want to buy one, but on a trip through the airport, it was invaluable.  I still held his hand, but I felt a little more secure knowing that if my son wriggled his hand away from mine, he wouldn't go far.  <br>  <br>  If you are in a crowded place, they are just one more measure of safety. I would totally recommend it.  It isn't a substitute for parental attention or hand holding, but the times we live in, a harness is great if used only occasionally and attentively.<br>  <br>  (Just as a side note...if you are only planning to use it in the airport, you might want to look into the ones that are only a harness...without the monkey (or bear) pocket thing...since it had a pocket, we had to remove it through security...not a big deal, but something to consider.)|`|sAAnquoTaa	Absolutely! I was put on a harness when I was a child and we thought it was fun. When my husband's with me I might not use it, but if I'm alone with her somewhere I will deffinitly be using it. I wouldn't feel safe not being able to see where she runs off to, and no one can say their child NEVER  runs off b/c they all do at some point.|`|4Bgw5xs8aa	Definitely not. I hate seeing people walking their kids like they're a dog. I see the pros, but I honestly think there are way more cons. I've walked through the mall with FIVE 2 year olds before and managed to keep up with them all. I personally think it's used way too often as a cop out for lazy parents. I understand airports, fairs, and amusement parks, but I still couldn't do it to my child. Dogs go on leashes, not children.|`|BUI9HnH1aa	it depends on my son and the situation.<br>  if hes any thing like my brothers or his dad , then im more then likley going to need one <br>  None of them EVER listened to there parents , and it didnt matter what they did the kids would always run off . Even undoing the straps in their pram whist the parents werent looking, just to run off . <br>  I dont think they are all that bad and dont understand why everyone makes a fuss of them ,. <br>  Would u rather ur child get lost, maybe run in to traffic .. Or <br>  wear a back pack that just happens to have a  "leash" on it that u can hold on to ... ?|`|00b5cb8c7ee97957778b15b3cc55a3e7aa	It's not a 'leash.' It's a harness system. They are very helpful, actually. Especially if you have a special needs child who likes to run off. I think people need to quit being so judgmental until they are put in this situation. A safe child is better than a dead one.|`|ozkdtzcBaa	I got a leash for my daughter when I was pregnant and could no longer run after her or pick her up. It was a good way for her to be able to get the exercise she needed and it saved me the energy that I didn't have in the first place. and she loves having her monkey backpack on her back and the tail is the leash end. and sometimes even perfect mothers have to turn their back on their child at some point and kids know when to run.|`|8zdPI8Qsaa	We personally aren't doing it, but I really don't see why people are so against it. I lived in downtown London as a child and I know my parents used one. I think they make them a lot cuter these days :-)  ....in our experience thus far though, we've been lucky that our boy is a good hand holder in public places.|`|1SGl03Zlaa	I will definitely use one for my child.<br>  I don't see any cons to using a harness to keep a child safe.  Its completely unrealistic to think that you can "train" your child not to leave your side or to think that you can keep your eyes on them 100% of the time.  In a crowded place it would only take a second for a child to wiggle free of your hand and disappear into the crowd, so why take the chance.  Even walking down the street (especially if you are pushing another child in a stroller) it would only take a few seconds for a child to see something and go running out in front of a car.  There are so many pro's to them I really can't see any cons other than a few judgemental people looking at me funny because I'm keeping my child safe.|`|dK17K1vMaa	We did when my son was at the walking age.  He didn't like sitting in the cart or hold our hands.  He also was a darter and a runner and would run in the road.  This gave him more independance.  I think they are great!  My son named his Mokey (bc he had the exact one you linked) and he loved it.  It's better to be safe then sorry.|`|r4E2zXL8aa	Yeah, I've used one of those on my 3 year old before. He likes it. So i see no problem.<br>  <br>  I've used it when we went to busy public places (zoo, park, etc)<br>  <br>  My son likes to try and run away from me and i have a 6 month old to look after as well. I can't keep pulling on his arm and chasing after him with my other son in his stroller. with the leash he's able to walk around where ever he chooses safely. I see no harm in that, rather that then him running away from me @ 90 miles an hour like he tries to do all the time and me chasing him with another baby in a stroller.<br>  <br>  better safe than sorry. those who don't like it, look away and mind your own business.|`|tQVBDx5Paa	Oh yes.<br>  I already purchased one for Emma.  It is cute though, it looks like a purse and you can't really tell it is a leash from the front.  My situation is though that I need to keep Emma safe while caring for her newborn sister as well.  So I plan on "leashing" Emma for walks on the road and if she wants to walk in the mall, etc.|`|x5aJcD9zaa	What is the big deal people are making of this?  It is a safety tool that you can CHOOSE to use or not to use.  If you have a 2 year old that will hold your hand the whole time and not run off from you, then good for you!  My 2 year old is a runner.  She will walk for a little while then suddenly bolt.  She is so quick and can get around people a lot faster than I can.<br>  <br>  I choose to use the buggy for busy situations because it is far less stressful, but I certainly don't look down upon people for choosing to use the harness.  They know what is best for their own child.<br>  <br>  Don't judge before you have had a child, and certainly not if you haven't got a runner!|`|8a5c549ea7fffbe40a9a737812632ec8aa	ha, this made me laugh and think of the facebook flair: "Free the Leash Kids!" i most likely will not. kids need to learn not to stray. however, i will never say never. if we were in a very crowded place like an airport or something, i might consider using one, but i'm leaning toward no. every time i see a leash kid i think that the poor parents don't have any control over their child and sometimes it can come off as very overbearing.|`|FUOLr64jaa	My friend has that exact same one and she likes it.  I laughed at her when she told me she was going to put a leash on her son - I won't say I'll never do it but I have NO plans in the near future to use one.|`|Q24QcYB8aa	I always find it very amusing when i see a child on a leash.<br>  Usually the mother isn't paying attention; talking to friends and such-- and the child is trying to walk as far as possible until he gets snagged and almost decapitates himself. Then the mother, still chit chatting away, reals her child in like a fish and the whole process repeats.|`|TQScv7Tcaa	I was with most of the others and thought it was horrible and almost degrading to a child to use a leash and although i would never put my daughter on one i have a friends who's son is SO fast it is unbelieveable, he will be there one minute and while you are paying someone in a shop he will be gone. So although i could never do that to my daughter i do understand that there are circumstances that it is needed.|`|z6IekuwSaa	I dunno. I haven't thought that through. She's only a little baby right now. I guess the pros would be they couldn't run into traffic, not sure about the cons|`|NPAQxqgNaa	That would require letting them out of the basement first, so I gotta say "no" on the leash.|`|AA10615355	Leash? I'm getting a saddle.|`|6fjrcdYjaa	I always said "NO WAY"... that's rediculous. But, unless you've had a two year old boy at CROWDED Disneyland, you'll never know the importance of those "leashes" (which, I don't like to call it. He's not a dog) <br>  <br>  If we weren't somewhere where he could TOTALLY be lost, I wouldn't have need for one... but, he's 2... sometimes, the kid wants to walk and be his own person! It was nice on our trip to Disneyland because I ALWAYS knew where he was. He didn't mind it either! He loves it! They have cute child "leashes" at Target, ones that look like little animal backpacks... he wears his around the house. He LOVES it!|`|Kj9GWZI7aa	I USED to find it ridiculous (before I had children, mind you)<br>  <br>  <br>  Then a family friend's child ran out into the parking lot at the mall in front of a car right in front of her mother's eyes.<br>  <br>  <br>  I'd rather have someone think I was tacky than have to bury my child because I was ignorant enough to think the unthinkable would never happen.|`|quPY9x7qaa	tethers aren't a bad idea in a crowed place like a fairgrounds or a mall, especially if one or both of the parents are handicapped or don't move as well as most people, some of us aren't as fast as we were in school. It only takes a predator a split second to make your life a living hell, nothing wrong w/ having a little extra security.
58G7ZAJpaa	I'd say you've lost your plug and you're definitely in the early stages of labor.  It honestly wouldn't surprise me if you wind up at the hospital tonight.  If not, take that WALK!!  It'll work him out.<br>  <br>  If you haven't done so, I recommend, and strongly suggest<  calling L&D to let them know, so they may expect you at any time.<br>  <br>  Good luck and CONGRATS!!|`|tMeN2fm0aa	LOL I feel ya! I remember being that far along and doing jumping jacks thinking GET OUT!!! hehe  <br>  <br>  I wouldnt walk that long because if you were to go into labor while you were walking... what would you do???  I honestly think you are in the early signs of labor now.  Thats what it sounds like to me!  I wouldnt be surprised if you go to bed tonight and get woke up at 3 am with strong contractions!  CONGRADS MAMA! Here comes your beautiful baby!!!!!|`|EbAMtQsHaa	lol sounds like it or braxton hicks one of the two count the pain if they get about 6 minutes apart go to the hospital you got a baby on the way and walking is a good thing it will progress the labor|`|mqHL4UcRaa	Well it sounds like you have lost your mucus plug or part of it anyways. So thats a good sign that labor is on the way. It could take hours, days, or a week after you lose your mucus plug for labor to begin.<br>  <br>  The tightening of your abdomen (braxton hicks contractions) are normal throughout pregnancy, but they become stronger and painful as your labor progresses. What you need to do is start timing them. Keep track of when they start/end, and when they become 5 minutes apart you need to head to the hospital. <br>  <br>  Walking is very good for you prior to labor, but its not a good idea to walk 30 minutes to the doctor. You need to walk in an area where you can get back home quickly if needed. So drive to the park or walk around the house or neighborhood. Just dont go too far. <br>  <br>  Sounds like your labor is starting. Just give it time.|`|PA7LOoQ9aa	sounds like it was your mucas plug coming out, it can come out day of or week or more before labor. i probably wouldnt over do the walking plus its dangerous for women to be out walking alone. i would go to a safe place and walk. i heard walking backwards up stairs, sex (with cumming inside the sperm softens cervix) also helps. im 37 and 1/2 weeks also having the braxton hicks and i was dilated to 3 two weeks ago!!! good luck.|`|S4Kj1cgOaa	It def sounds like its getting close... as for the walk I say go for it!! Im almost 41 wks now and I take my dog for long walks very day trying to get something started... I dont think shes ready to come out though. So if your baby is ready its a good way to help them get going and if your baby isnt ready then it wont hurt anything!!! Just make sure you have a phone n you to be safe!!! Good luck!!!|`|zRQmWC5saa	I think the only place u will be walking tommorow is the hospital parking lot to the ER!  lol ur in labor now! It may be quick or it may go slow, u never know , so if I was u , I would be heading to the Er now!<br>  congrats and good luck!|`|bPY3oj44aa	my eed is sunday and the exact same thing happened to me today and ive been getting pains on and off all day so i think your in the early stages like me, good luck =) xx|`|VlYMcVKlaa	sounds to me like you are starting. good luck ok let me know how it goes|`|1SxVIZd7aa	i dont know if i would walk to the DR. maybe go for a walk around your house, where you can rest if you start having contractions! Good luck!|`|seU9VwIJaa	It sounds like a possibility that labor is right around the corner! My bloody show was more brown than red. If you aren't having horrible contractions, I see no problems with walking to the doctor as long as your doctor says it's fine for you to exercise! I took my dogs for a walk when I was in the early stages of labor, around 8 pm, and didn't go to the hospital until 5 am. It might help wiggle your little one out of there! <br>  Congrats and good luck!!!
AA11724307	My husband and I were trying for 2 and a half years...no luck!  We got ourselves put on a list for an infertility specialist...found out I was pregnant less then 2 weeks later.  Now I'm going on my 7th week of pregnancy and due in October.  My husband had a low count too.  Have you tried putting him on vitamins?  You can get Fertilaid which is all the vitamins known to help male fertility in one pill.  I bought my husband all of them seperatly.  And we stopped timing ovulation and just had sex when we felt like it.  No pressure that way.  I think its that we kind of gave up on the idea of conceiving naturally that helped us finally conceive...we werent expecting it so we stopped trying.  Good luck and if you have any more questions just message me|`|dOQ5yipDaa	Well as much as I hate to say it - my best friend was trying for 2 years and the month she got pregnant was the month that they were suppose to start IVF. <br>  <br>  So for her she reckons it was not stressing about it, not worrying about getting the BFP and just having sex for sex that made her pregnant!<br>  <br>  Good luck it is such a long hard road isnt it :(<br>  <br>  Are you using ovulation tests? Also an old wives tale is to sit with your legs high up after sex!

kyqhMuSiaa	Pretty much as soon as the sperm comes in contact with oxygen it dies. I don't think you will get pregnant from the way you described.
mqHL4UcRaa	Yeah thats exactly what braxton hicks feels like. It just gets tight & hard for a few seconds/minutes, then it goes away. Most people dont notice them until 26 weeks or so, but now that your 30 weeks they will start getting stronger and stronger. It's your body's way of preparing for labor and strengthening the uterus. So its a healthy sign that your having them.|`|B0bWrvanaa	Definately a Braxton Hicks. I would recommend that you practice your breathing and go to the doctor and let him know that you are progressing...and...<br>  <br>  CONGRATS!
tMeN2fm0aa	No it just sounds like you are hormonal.  You just had a baby and its normal! I didnt want my husband taking my baby anywhere when I first had her because I thought he wasnt going to bring her home... LMFAO!  Its silly of me I know, but your body is out of whack right now.  What he NEEDS to do is start being more sensitive to you and realize that you are not yourself right now and that telling you to think before you speak is a waste of breath!  Again, you just had a baby and your hormones and chemicals are all outta wack and then on top of that the stress of adding a new lil one in you guys life... things are going to be crazy for a little bit.  You are fine in my eyes... If you would feel better about getting checked out, then please do!<br>  <br>  Signs of PPD would be, not wanting to hold the baby... denying that you had children... not taking care of her... resenting her/ or him.... basically wishing you werent a mom....  You just sound like you are a normal new mother!  Congrads on your new baby!!!!|`|mqHL4UcRaa	Sounds like your a little hormonal, which is normal after giving birth. Your hormones drop significantly after birth and your body produces different kinds for breastfeeding, etc. So its okay to be a little overly emotional. I wouldnt go as far as saying its post-partum depression.|`|JPCV48hHaa	It could be, but I wouldn't jump the gun.  Keep in mind, you were pregnant just 7 days ago...your body is still a hormonal battleground.  If you have a checkup coming up with your OB/GYN, I would address this issue, but right now, it just sounds like new baby-itis.  :o)|`|MnZVjZe9aa	To be honest, it sounds like hormones to me.  <br>  <br>  Do you feel:  Loss of appetite <br>  Insomnia <br>  Intense irritability and anger <br>  Overwhelming fatigue <br>  Loss of interest in sex <br>  Lack of joy in life <br>  Feelings of shame, guilt or inadequacy <br>  Severe mood swings <br>  Difficulty bonding with the baby <br>  Withdrawal from family and friends <br>  Thoughts of harming yourself or the baby <br>  <br>  If not, you should be fine.  Enjoy your new family.  I'm due on Saturday and feel like he's coming early.<br>  <br>  Congrats.|`|1SxVIZd7aa	sweetie- you gave birth 7 DAYS AGO!!!!! there is no sign of postpartum depression because of you getting mad at a movie, or starting a fight with your partner. That's called hormones. Lovely, isn't it?<br>  <br>  However, if you have feelings like you are out of control, or like you may hurt yourself or someone else call your dr. Good luck!|`|j9axB0YMaa	I don't think it sounds like post par. Having a new baby and such a big change in your life and stressful so it's bound to lead to somekinda fight. Felling sad over the movie is probably just hormones. Now if you had said you cried for an hour straight I would maybe think differently.
3MbAa1PHaa	you have a right to second opinions! That isn't rude at all. It is important to find the doctor you feel most comfortable with. They shouldn't even think twice about that!|`|lzcglDnMaa	When getting consultation from the different doctors in the same office, you have to take in consideration, that the doctors do talk to one another about your conditions and the best treatment for you. The best thing to do if you want different opinions is go to different offices. This will ensure that you are getting a good opinion, from someone that doesn't' know your situation.

For those of us that aren't "so good" lol. It's not that we don't care, we just have more things that we worry about...closer to home.  Speaking from the truth, I have donated a few time this last year and I'm an agnostic.  fyi, that doesn't mean I don't believe, because I do, I just don't see any proof and I'm not going to spend my life bowing down to a god that may or may not exist. and if I go to hell for it, so be it, my bad. That must be some god that would put his unfaithfuls in hell.  Oh!  An don't let me forget the part about baptizing babies.  for those of you that do, kudos to you.  But why the heck would I want to associate to a god that would put a baby in hell because of the parent's decision not to baptize it?<br>  Besides, the definitions:<br>  <br>  Atheist, agnostic, infidel, skeptic refer to persons not inclined toward religious belief or a particular form of religious belief. An atheist is one who denies the existence of a deity or of divine beings. An agnostic is one who believes it impossible to know anything about God or about the creation of the universe and refrains from commitment to any religious doctrine. Infidel means an unbeliever, especially a nonbeliever in Islam or Christianity. A skeptic doubts and is critical of all accepted doctrines and creeds.|`|Kj9GWZI7aa	You can't categorize, but I'd say on the whole, Christians and Catholics seem to do the most charity
6EXOZu6Vaa	in your previous questions, we found out your sister has bipolar. she probably takes meds for that right? raising a bipolar child is tough but they deserve all your attention because they feel like they experience more hard times than anyone else. but is this a side affect of the meds? im not a doctor but im a a CEO. i meet with alot of people. i know bipolar when i see it. my dad used to be that. on his meds it made him shake alot and have his throat closed up sometimes. also she might be experiencing anxiety or something like that from school, the loss, she said she feels neglected in one of her questions (not saying you neglect her but that's how she feels). i would take her to a pediatrician for doctor. i would talk to her about this. get her at a calm time. ask her if she is upset about school, friends, family... i know her answers account. i can talk to her if you want? look her in her eyes. give her the "oh my god, he will find out sooner or later" look. try and pull as much info out of her. i would consider you getting a family theropist. <br>  hope this helps<br>  ps i know this was a little off topic but i just want to help you and your sister|`|EFA4cgrfaa	This is nothing that anyone on Yahoo can help you with.

ntdGOZqGaa	My son was like that he was really really low at 36 weeks. As I'm sure you know its more then ok if you were to have the baby right now considering 37 weeks is full term. The baby is measuring so big probably bc he is so big. I dont know if you want to go into labor yet or not but taking a hot bath and bouncing on one of those big huge balls will help also walking. Good luck|`|Fwm6lHmpaa	my son was low the whole pregnancy and came out 4 weeks preemie what ur describing sounds like u are gonna go in with the next day or 2 i also lost my plug the friday before i had my son and wednesday i lost my water and my son was born within 8 hours|`|5h8bYsKdaa	ouch so you are probably gonna have a 9 lb baby in a week or less. thats my thoughts. congrats and have fun pushin him out lol|`|vzzSiclEaa	I felt like tat, but I was 9 month.... don;t know what to tell you...|`|tMeN2fm0aa	Um, my Dr said that a woman can lose her mucus plug and still hold on for another month.  With that being said, I went into labor the night after Iost mine.  Though my child was low and I was 3 cm dilated and thinned out for the last month of mine and held out... so its possible.   Either way, good luck and congreads!!!  You are 37 weeks and though its best for the baby to hold of for another couple weeks, you are technically considered full term after 36 weeks, so if you were to go into labor now, the baby would be fine and would go home with you...

vOomJtbsaa	Best time to do it is when the babies can sit up on their own and act interested in food.  I started my LO on them at 5 months and we didn't begin with rice cereal.  I did alot of research and yes it's low allergen but it also has very little nutritional value, it's like equivalent of white bread.  There are far better solids to start on like fresh fruits and veggies that are low allergen, things like avocado, banana and sweet potatoes.  On top of all that, rice cereal is pretty gross, if you've ever tasted it and I'm of the impression I would never make my child eat something that I would never eat.  It tastes like mushed chalk, zero flavor, so yea I'm not a big advocate of rice cereal.  We started Caleb on avocado, then bananas, then sweet potato.... and so on.... now he's eating homemade fruits and veggies of all sorts, and starting on some meats too at night.  Tonight he had turkey and mashed veggies... he gobbled them right up! :)<br>  Do your research and do whatever you think is best for you and your babies.  Good luck!! :)|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	All mammals are protected by the same thing -they can't physically eat food until they are physiologically ready to digest it. For humans this means picking up the food, placing it in their mouth, gumming it, moving it back with their tongue, and swallowing it. The most obvious of course it the tongue thrust that newborns have -this reflex actively keeps food out of their body until they can digest it. But the other steps all have safeguards as well.<br>  <br>  For healthy, full term infants the ability to eat food develops around 6-9 months. In recent years there have been numerous studies looking at the risks of certain things (allergies, asthma, anemia, etc) in relation to when solids are started and almost all have shown that the lowest risks are when solids are started between 6-9 months.<br>  <br>  However it should also be noted that babies with allergies may refuse solids for up to a year, and that breastmilk is nutritionally complete for at least the first year of life despite earlier statements that it is not. An unpleasant feeling in the mouth is often a first sign of allergy and may cause babies to spit out rather than swallow allergenic foods. This is a very useful safeguard that should not be overridden.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.kellymom.com/nutrition/solids/solids-when.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kellymom.com/nutrition/solids...</a><br>  Developmental signs that baby is ready for solids<br>  <br>  Solids readiness depends on both the maturity of baby’s digestive tract and baby’s developmental readiness for solids. Although the maturity of baby’s digestive system is not something that we can readily observe, research indicates that 6 months appears to be ideal for avoiding the allergies and other health risks of too-early solids. After this point, different babies are ready for solids at different times -- developmental readiness for solids cannot be determined using a calendar. Most babies are developmentally ready for solids somewhere between 6 and 8 months.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.llli.org/FAQ/solids.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.llli.org/FAQ/solids.html</a><br>  Babies who are ready for solids can usually feed themselves. Mothers often report that they knew their babies were ready when they picked up food from a plate, chewed it, swallowed it, and wanted more.<br>  <br>  Listen to your baby! Babies with a tendency to allergies may refuse solids until later in their first year. As long as they are growing well and are happy and healthy, there is no need for concern.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.askdrsears.com/faq/bf4.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.askdrsears.com/faq/bf4.asp</a><br>  I also have found that some infants are not developmentally ready for solids until 8 or 9 months.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.kellymom.com/nutrition/solids..." rel="nofollow">http://www.kellymom.com/nutrition/solids...</a><br>  The following organizations recommend that all babies be exclusively breastfed (no cereal, juice or any other foods) for the first 6 months of life (not the first 4-6 months):<br>  <br>  * World Health Organization<br>  * UNICEF<br>  * US Department of Health & Human Services<br>  * American Academy of Pediatrics<br>  * American Academy of Family Physicians<br>  * American Dietetic Association<br>  * Australian National Health and Medical Research Council<br>  * Royal Australian College of General Practitioners<br>  * Health Canada<br>  <br>  <br>  Why Delay Solids?<br>  <a href="http://kellymom.com/nutrition/solids/del..." rel="nofollow">http://kellymom.com/nutrition/solids/del...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.askdrsears.com/faq/fit18.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.askdrsears.com/faq/fit18.asp</a><br>  No, you should wait until he is six months old, unless he is not gaining weight and your doctor advises you to start earlier. This subject keeps coming up, and the answer is still the same: the current recommendations (I didn’t make these up) are to wait until six months before starting solids. Starting foods too early can result in digestive or allergy problems later in life. We have learned that the old guidelines of 4 months are just too soon, and I am willing to bet that in ten years we will be recommending later than 6 months. But for now, the six month guideline seems reasonable.

A baby who is struggling to get food into his mouth is probably not quite ready to eat it.<br>  <br>  Why not cereal?<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/9646449/page..." rel="nofollow">http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/9646449/page...</a><br>  Take rice cereal, for example. Under conventional American wisdom, it's the best first food. But Butte says iron-rich meat — often one of the last foods American parents introduce — would be a better choice.<br>  <br>  Dr. David Ludwig of Children's Hospital Boston, a specialist in pediatric nutrition, says some studies suggest rice and other highly processed grain cereals actually could be among the worst foods for infants.<br>  <br>  "These foods are in a certain sense no different from adding sugar to formula. They digest very rapidly in the body into sugar, raising blood sugar and insulin levels" and could contribute to later health problems, including obesity, he says.<br>  <br>  The lack of variety in the American approach also could be a problem. Exposing infants to more foods may help them adapt to different foods later, which Ludwig says may be key to getting older children to eat healthier.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.kellymom.com/nutrition/solids..." rel="nofollow">http://www.kellymom.com/nutrition/solids...</a><br>  Cereal is not at all necessary, particularly the baby cereals. Regular (whole grain) oatmeal is more nutritious for your baby.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.askdrsears.com/faq/ci2.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.askdrsears.com/faq/ci2.asp</a><br>  The truth is, there is nothing special about these foods that makes them better to start out with. Babies don't actually even need rice cereal<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.llli.org/llleaderweb/LV/LVDec..." rel="nofollow">http://www.llli.org/llleaderweb/LV/LVDec...</a><br>  Meat provides additional protein, zinc, B-vitamins, and other nutrients which may be in short supply when the decrease in breast milk occurs. A recent study from Sweden suggests that when infants are given substantial amounts of cereal, it may lead to low concentrations of zinc and reduced calcium absorption (Persson 1998). Dr. Nancy Krebs has shared preliminary results from a large infant growth study suggesting that breastfed infants who received pureed or strained meat as a primary weaning food beginning at four to five months, grow at a slightly faster rate. Dr. Krebs' premise is that inadequate protein or zinc from complementary foods may limit the growth of some breastfed infants during the weaning period. Both protein and zinc levels were consistently higher in the diets of the infants who received meat (Krebs 1998). Thus the custom of providing large amounts of cereal products and excluding meat products before seven months of age may not meet the nutritional needs of all breastfed infants.<br>  Meat has also been recommended as an excellent source of iron in infancy. Heme iron (the form of iron found in meat) is better absorbed than iron from plant sources. In addition, the protein in meat helps the baby more easily absorb the iron from other foods. Two recent studies (Makrides 1998; Engelmann 1998) have examined iron status in breastfed infants who received meat earlier in the weaning period. These studies indicate that while there is not a measurable change in breastfed babies' iron stores when they receive an increased amount of meat (or iron), the levels of hemoglobin circulating in the blood stream do increase when babies receive meat as one of their first foods.<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.westonaprice.org/children/nou..." rel="nofollow">http://www.westonaprice.org/children/nou...</a><br>  Finally, respect the tiny, still-developing digestive system of your infant. Babies have limited enzyme production, which is necessary for the digestion of foods. In fact, it takes up to 28 months, just around the time when molar teeth are fully developed, for the big-gun carbohydrate enzymes (namely amylase) to fully kick into gear. Foods like cereals, grains and breads are very challenging for little ones to digest. Thus, these foods should be some of the last to be introduced. (One carbohydrate enzyme a baby's small intestine does produce is lactase, for the digestion of lactose in milk.1)<br>  <br>  [...]<br>  <br>  Babies do produce functional enzymes (pepsin and proteolytic enzymes) and digestive juices (hydrochloric acid in the stomach) that work on proteins and fats.12 This makes perfect sense since the milk from a healthy mother has 50-60 percent of its energy as fat, which is critical for growth, energy and development.13 In addition, the cholesterol in human milk supplies an infant with close to six times the amount most adults consume from food.13 In some cultures, a new mother is encouraged to eat six to ten eggs a day and almost ten ounces of chicken and pork for at least a month after birth. This fat-rich diet ensures her breast milk will contain adequate healthy fats.14<br>  Thus, a baby's earliest solid foods should be mostly animal foods since his digestive system, although immature, is better equipped to supply enzymes for digestion of fats and proteins rather than carbohydrates.1 This explains why current research is pointing to meat (including nutrient-dense organ meat) as being a nourishing early weaning food.|`|tivpa7Vlaa	my 3mth old son pediatrician said as long as baby can hold his head up (no wobbly) you can introduce baby foods...|`|JQZDCcyQaa	6 months is reccomended, no need for cereal just start with whole foods|`|b32e560414238926779c6d2630e98a48aa	from about 3-6 months. pablum, barley and/or rice cereals.|`|TvYX1yXWaa	i started my son on solids when he turned 4 months|`|OnTwn6FHaa	The recommended age is 6 months these days, that is going by all the information I was given from various health organisations etc when I had my baby in January. I believe a lot of mums start as early as 4 months without any problems. They don't have to start with rice cereal, pureed fruit or veggies are fine or mashed banana or avocado to start with.  Only introduce one at a time incase your baby reacts to it, it makes it easier to know what they reacted to and only give them a teaspoon or 2 to begin with after a breast/bottle feed over a few days.|`|y8d38Sbgaa	Most pediatricians would say to wait until your baby is 6 months old before trying new foods.  The introduction of novel foods before your baby is ready for it might lead to allergies.  I started with rice cereal.<br>  I hope this helps and good luck!<br>  Lisa<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.babyfood101.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.babyfood101.com</a>|`|gPg7qYGIaa	that depend on your baby be for the can start to wean the should be able to hold there heads up well Control there tongue well  be able to put there hands up to there  mouth and when your eating the baby will watch u and try to copy <br>  my baby was ready at 3 months but my friends was not ready to 6 months just go with your baby u will know when there ready|`|DeXRWlR6aa	Between 4-6 months, start w/cereal. At their check up, ask the pediatrician, just to make sure. Each child is different.|`|YUNE5QReaa	It used to be 4 months but now they prefer to start them at 6 months - yes it's usually farex first which is a type of rice cereal|`|AA12300309	Usually somewhere between 4-6 months and you start with rice cereal.|`|pWoMaxwkaa	when they grow some teeth. <br>  3 months for cereal.|`|LN3ocDmXaa	When they have teeth|`|930525fae9ce50d25e62f663d2250380aa	do you mean really solid foods?  or any food which is pureed?<br>  real solid but cooked food I would say from 10 months and above, however if it is cereal (baby food type) or rice gruel, it would be from 4months and above, but of course introduced one by one, in real small amounts cooked and mashed.  but stay away from cured meat, smoked meat and fish, nuts, raw honey and spices.  those should be introduced one by one again from when the baby is 2 or even three years old. Popcorn and nuts should be introduced only when the child can chew and eat slowly, as both are hard to extract if choked on; maybe when they are 4 or 5 years old, and when you can sit down and eat with them and show that you too are chewing and not talking at the same time?   this will prevent choking.<br>  good luck|`|oPFo0aysaa	It depends on your baby. My first son started rice at 4 months. He hated it. We jumped right into carrotts(at 4 months), he kinda showed intrest. By 7 months he was eating really well done pasta, egg yolks, anything real soft and smushy. My second son HATED rice which we introduced at 4 months. We jumped right into sweet potatoes(yes he was 4 months too), and he loved them.He moved right into 2nd foods by Gerber, my pedi said 1rst and 2nd foods are the same consistancy, just one is bigger. He is now 8 months, and does not show intrest in eating real solids yet. He does eat Zwiebeck toast, puffs, and stage 3 foods though. I hope this helps, my pedi did tell me to go ahead and try rice first at 4 months. BTW, my kiddos have real sensetive stomachs, and Beech Nut rice cereal does not contain milk or soy, which Gerber does, so it is a little easier to digest than Gerber.|`|iKjRrcDoaa	well my sisters friends started eating a solid foods at 5 months however he got food poisoning so my suggestion is maybe 6 months i hope this info. helps|`|fxF2oraPaa	when they can chew, which usually happens after 3 months or so after birth
PgiZQZKxaa	my twins had reflux also they practically lived in their car seats even sleep in them which was advice for there pediatrician nurse practitioner and 2 spec i took them to just think of it like this if you had reflux [you know how that feels] you would stay in the only position that you were comfortable right i just know my kids loved it the only prob i had was switching them to there bed when the reflux was better they did not want to give up there car seats but i slowly took them away a little more each day when my kids were admitted to hospital several times for asthma they stayed in car seats nurses tried to tell me no i told them to call kids doc and he said leave them in car seats as long as they are happy so they did|`|aBWu7tyHaa	my daughter also had acid reflux and our dr. told us during the day while we are awake with her, it's okay to lay her on her tummy to sleep.  it's more comfortable for them and helps them sleep better and deeper so they are healthier and happier.  try that.  did they put her on meds to help?  we had zantac like twice a day.  they also have a formula called Enfamil A.R.  (it's a little bit thicker with rice in it) and something like that may help as well.  I could be wrong but I'm assuming the AR is for Acid Reflux.  Have you tried one of those new slings that they have now?  or get like a little bouncer seat type of thing or swing.  it's sort of like a car seat leaning back and warm and snug.  best of luck|`|JsqMSU9Haa	yes, we did.  we alternated between car seat, swing and bouncy.  acid reflux will get better as she gets older ideally so its a short term solution - but just keep alternating.|`|AFi5kTiEaa	My niece had reflux.  When she was finally put on Zantac it got ALOT better.  She was also on Allementum formula, i think Similac makes it with those two things she was a different baby.  She also slept on her tummy, the ONLY way she would sleep.<br>  <br>  If she is on meds, i would talk to her doctor, she might need a different dose, or need different formula, if you arent bfing.|`|zReKPmgJaa	My daughter has reflux as well.  We give her Zantac twice a day, and this seems to help her tremendously.  She hasn't been nearly as fussy as she was prior to treatment.  I tried so many different things and am always told that the position the car seat forces the baby to be in makes matters worse.  <br>  <br>  Having said this, my daughter happens to love sitting in her car seat as well.  I would keep putting her in the car seat as long as she's happy there.  Just try not to put her in that position immediately after a feeding.  Other than that, you can get so many different opinions, but you have to just do what works for you!!  Good luck.|`|oXzHvsBpaa	My son had this problem. As long as it doesn't go on for too long then its fine. My son would only sleep in his swing for the first 2 months. We then learned that he was a tummy sleeper and it help with his reflux a lot. You could also prop up one side of the crib using a old pillow. Is your baby on medication? If not then I would talk to your doctor about it. My son is on Zantac and Mylanta twice a day. Also depending on the age of your baby you could get a bumbo seat. My son loves sitting in it. Also keep your baby up right for about 20 mins after each feeding.|`|wBpennsMaa	My daughter also has acid reflux. Her pediatrician said to not have her sit in her car seat at unnecessary times because of it.|`|V6slDthdaa	try elevating one side of her crib mattress so that she's laying with her top half slightly elevated. It may help.

vfhKkiSKaa	If you can't do the time, don't do the crime.<br>  <br>  Deal with it.  <br>  <br>  Do you know why you get punished more?  Because we don't want to hear your BS whining.  You don't learn anything if you are let off.  All you learn is that you can do something bad again and you will get off.<br>  <br>  And of course we understand where you are coming from.  Kids never realize that we were your age once too.<br>  <br>  You will understand as you get older.|`|hKJIDdVqaa	I agree. Which is why I do not ground my kids. it is a ridiculous punishment.|`|0qP8gLpyaa	sounds to me like someone is mad for getting into trouble.|`|FlVLN3Ehaa	Parents do that because they think they are doing the right thing. People parent as well as they can, but that doesn't mean they have perfect parenting skills. There's nothing you can do change your parents' behaviour but you can change yours. Don't do whatever it is that gets you into trouble, then you won't have problems. If you get yourself grounded, go and cry where they can't see if that aggravates them. A kid behaving for a few days is not a good reason to lift the grounding, unless the parent themselves feel they over reacted. Parents need to follow through on threats unless they are willing to admit to overreacting or their kids will play them.|`|XOtOMncwaa	Because obviously you did something to be punished, pleading your way out of it isn't going to help things, it only becomes a nuisance if you constantly plead to not be grounded anymore... so to keep you from pleading and acting out even more they add more to the punishment.|`|HXfHkoSHaa	If a grounding is warranted, then it should be carried out.  If it wasn't, the parent would be inconsistent and the child would know s/he could get away with things s/he shouldn't.  Sorry, I agree with your parents as long as you deserve the punishment.|`|nrTVlo8Eaa	Thankfully I never had to be grounded when I was growing up, and I never had to ground either of my children, either. Personally I don't think it's that useful of a disciplinary tool. I would imagine that your parents don't think it is, either, but they're totally at a loss as to what to do next to get you to behave in the way that they've specified.<br>  <br>  I can tell you that as a grown up, pleading NEVER works. The most effective way to get what you want is to play by the rules. It sounds boring and old fashioned, but it works. When you prove yourself by being reliable on a consistent basis, you usually get what you want anyway, because people learn to trust you.|`|rBq189W1aa	"You'd cry to if you got TV taken away and couldn't go out.

The baby's too small for you to be showing yet, so you do look bloated. I'm not sure but I don't really think bloating would cause you to gain that much weight though?? Have you been eating more since you found out about the baby?|`|a9ad5fb472d76ac52689ca11de1f2cc4aa	You probably did gain weight but most likely the weight would have first gone to your buttocks and thighs more.  I think you're just bloated.  I was pretty slim before pregnancy and I think in the first 2 months of pregnancy I gained about 10 pounds.  My doc said it's normal for women who were underweight to gain more than the usual 25-35 pounds.  So don't sweat if you gain a few pounds.

I like Carmine Jose better
3MbAa1PHaa	the problem is.. pregnancy and pre-menstrual symptoms are often very similar! makes it tricky when you are in the two week wait. i would go ahead and take a test in the morning if you can and if neg.. repeat a week after your period was due to be sure. Good luck!|`|Yc2xj1Wpaa	When i was preg. With my son i did not have any symptoms...no cramping no sore boobs no nausea nothing....i knew i was pregnant cuz i was 5 days late, took 3 tests and it was positive,found out i was 5wks 1 day...all women r diff....my sister had cramping ,she said she felt like her period was coming,she was indeed prego,good luck
1z3C0R2Vaa	Yes>>>>>>>|`|NJbLm7Pyaa	yes.|`|a6ed35a31baaffb82ee453238bf5d0b8aa	Yes , there is a probability, she may be pregnant., but , then, the pill don't work to a specific date at a dot. It too has a tolerance of plus/minus dates. Nevertheless a visit to a doc/gyny will put the matter to rest.|`|kBlTsIrHaa	if she had the pill within 72 hours she may not be pregnant and due to the pill periods become irregular as it is the side effect of the pill so very few chances if she is having her periods.. even if 2 days late.|`|gtGDr73Taa	yes.............
DDYwnut6aa	You should watch your cervical mucus (discharge) and when you see clear, stretchy mucus (like raw eggwhites) consider yourself fertile. A normal luteal phase (time between ovulation and your period) is 10-16 days, so you should watch for it around 10-16 days before you expect your next period.<br>  <br>  Go to <a href="http://www.fertilityfriend.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.fertilityfriend.com</a> for more information and to learn about charting your cycles to find your most fertile time of the month.|`|DiqDCZU4aa	they say two weeks after youre period, but you start getting fertile a few days before you ovulate which means sperm can live inside your fertile womb until the egg is realeased, get a maybe baby ovulation kit, they're aussome...|`|HEdGGmkhaa	If you have a normal/typical 28 day cycle you would generally ovulate around the 14th day after the first day of your period. You can also tell by cervial mucus and bbt/basal body temperature.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://essentialconceptionguide.com" rel="nofollow">http://essentialconceptionguide.com</a>|`|92xRj1mKaa	when you get that little discharge that looks  slimmy, that's when you're ovulating|`|3MbAa1PHaa	usually 14 days after the first day of your last menstrual period. So, if you started March 1st.. your most fertile days would be around March 14th. So if you are wanting to get pregnant.. you need to BD from around March 10th until 18th for good measure! :)|`|jPnXGIZNaa	yea they says its 2 weeks after your period.<br>  Although I have heard that only have sex will ovulating does not increase chances.. your better off having sex every other day for the month
AiJeS6I1aa	Yes, it's "bad".  It puts the baby at risk for all kinds of potential problems including, but not limited to: infection, death, poor feeding, learning disability, bleeding in the brain, poor growth, blindness, breathing dificulty/lung disease, physical disability/cerebral palsy, mental retardation....<br>  <br>  But, some babies escape without long term problems.  The younger the gestational age, the more likely for there to be problems.  Lowest level of survival is 24 weeks.  Due date is 40 weeks; full term is 37 weeks ("3 weeks early").<br>  <br>  By 30 weeks (like your friend), there is significantly improved survival and outcome.  By 34 weeks, babies have the same survival and outcome as full term babies, but just need a bit of extra help to start.<br>  <br>  So, yes, being born 10 weeks early, like your friend, is not great, but not the worst-case scenario.|`|pXSKSS3daa	Not necessarily. I mean, a parent doesn't WANT their baby to be born early but that doesn't always mean something will be wrong.<br>  <br>  Unless she had underlying health problems related to her pre-term birth then she wouldn't show any signs of it now. Most preemies grow up to be fine and you couldn't pick them out from those that went full term in a crowd.|`|HXfHkoSHaa	It is a serious situation at birth, but at 10 weeks early most babies will survive.  Most will be a little behind in the very beginning, but catch up to be just as healthy as anyone else pretty quick.  She's probably telling the truth.|`|quNfHZULaa	Yeah it sure isn't good. You can be born that early and be ok though. If she is fine now it then it doesn't really matter how sick she might have been. It's good she didn't have any big problems.
jzAfst8Taa	could be an evap line you'll need to take another first thing tomorrow morning an make sure you read it within the time limit ...good luck and keep us posted|`|AA11724307	Yes...after 10 minutes its inaccurate.  Thats why it says not to read them after 10 minutes and throw them away.  Its not a positive line...its an evaporation line.  A positive test will show up in the time frame alloted.  Low levels of HCG in early pregnancy dont cause a test to take longer to turn positive..it just shows up lighter.|`|N89HLv92aa	You need to retest. You should get a strong solid second pink line this time if you are pregnant.|`|AIskV0efaa	i dont quit understand, are you asking that if after 2 days the test is right? if thats the case the test is right after 3 minutes. but if your asking if you test again will it be right, well that all depends on your body. with my first son i had a blood test done that came up neg and 6 weeks later we found out i was 13 weeks prego.|`|dSobv28maa	nope, tests are inaccurate ater 10 minutes.|`|jPnXGIZNaa	could be! I was four days late on my period and had a very faint positive - it depends on the type of test you use!|`|3MbAa1PHaa	you aren't supposed to read the test after 10 minutes of dipping it in urine. So, no that is what is called an "evaporation line". It is negative.|`|VlYMcVKlaa	u should not read your test on the next day. test should be read right away
AA10196172	If you had an ejaculation, and you didn't ahve a big pee to clean out your plumbing - then there's a good chance your pre-c*m was loaded with sperm. What do you tink is hiding in your tubes? It's nice and warm and moist in there, they'll live plenty long enough to emerge in round 2. At least if Mr. Ed was dry, the stuff on the outside was dead. <br>  <br>  So, it's like having unprotected sex - in fact, that's exactly what it was! If you pushed it right down into her, then you put the little swimmers right where they needed to go. <br>  <br>  The only good things are - was it out side of days 10-18 since her period started? Those are the worst days to do this, if she's got regular cycles. Also, even when couples are TRYING to get pregnant, it doesn't always happen that month. <br>  <br>  Based on your story, I would say your odds of being a dada are pretty low - say about 1 in 5.<br>  <br>  All you can do is wait 2 weeks and see what the test says.|`|Wf5p3jqKaa	I busted in my gf too.  It was a big load.  I'm not sure if shes preggers or not, but she is getting an abortion just in case.|`|EFA4cgrfaa	No one on here can tell you what the chances are.<br>  Any time you perform intercourse without protection you're at risk.<br>  Have her wait a week and take a pregnancy test.|`|QDj0JOhkaa	sperm dies when it dries so aslong as you were dry and didnt *** again then your fine but i cant be 100%sure

427abcdfcd8e012fe37537ef1426e40faa	Don't worry yet.  None of my kids had more than a couple words (other than mama/dada) at a year, and they're all doing just fine now.<br>  <br>  My oldest didn't say anything other than mama/dada at a year.  Her language comprehension was great, but she wasn't saying anything.  She said her first real words at 13 months (right after she started walking) -- "up" and "oof oof" (like "woof woof" for dog).  Her verbal skills just took off from there, and she was speaking in complete sentences by age 2 although her speech still wasn't clear at all.  By age 3, her vocab was phenomenal, and she could clearly say all her sounds (including the difficult "R").  She's now 5 years old, in kindergarten, and has much clearer speech and a better vocabulary than most of her peers.  (Note that I'm not trying to brag here -- just showing that being a little late with first words doesn't necessarily indicate a speech or hearing problem.)<br>  <br>  My middle child said her first words the earliest of my three, but is now 4 years old and doesn't have near the vocab or grammar that my oldest had at this age.  She also still can't say her R's, and she struggles with some other sounds if she speaks too quickly.  Different kid, different development.<br>  <br>  My youngest is 18 months old, and we started signing with him around 8-10 months, and he really loved it!  He consistently does more, all done, please, thank you, milk, water, juice, banana, apple, cracker, cheese, ice cream, eat, play, and toilet.  It's a huge help for us that he can let us know some of his basic needs (or wants -- like ice cream  ;-)  ).  That may be something you can try with your daughter to help her communication until she becomes more verbal.  Oh, and my son didn't have more than a couple words at 12 months either, and it's just been since he hit 18 months that his speech has started to take off.<br>  <br>  Anyway, my point is that it's still early, so just keep talking and reading to your daughter often (and maybe even try some signing), and she'll get there.  If she's not making much progress by 18 months, you may want to have an evaluation if you think she isn't hearing you.  (But if she can follow verbal instructions, my guess is that her hearing is probably fine.)|`|V8GrFx0jaa	No. My kids were well over a year before they even said Mama or Dada. It was hard to wait, but they started by the time they were 15 months, and before they were two they had completely caught up to other two year olds.|`|wOLoYW7jaa	A friend of mines daughter didnt talk until she was almost 3 because her older brother would get everything she needed without her having to put the effort into it - give her time, she'll be fine - her daughter is now 7 and wont stop talking :)|`|AxtJPPDsaa	I had the same problem with my 5 yaer old...he was pushing 2 before he started talking.........i was so worried....now i wondre why i worried.....I can't get him to be quiet...and he is extemely smart! ( can read most stuff on 4th and 5th grade level...without sounding it out)......She will talk...I think his problem was that he didn't have to...he was my first and i catered to him so much he had no reason to talk. He didn't have to say drink...if he pointed i gie it to him.........My husband and i left him when he was 2 for our honey moon with granparents....we came back and he was talking sentences....b/c they didn't know all his commands..he had to talk to them. She will get it!...My daughter is 17 month and has just started talking alot...but she has big bro to help.|`|bWyKAFwuaa	OMG kids typically don't start talking till a year and half, what do you expect????|`|0gChS7z8aa	No, ur baby's gonna be fine. u should only start worring when ur child isn't talking at age three. the average age is around two years old.|`|MB4siWy0aa	Hi.<br>  I'm a child developmentalist.  I wouldn't expect your daughter to be talking yet.  On average a child doesn't even say his / her first word until around fourteen months.  The point is, is she communicating?  If she is and she is vocalising, babbling and making a range of sounds, then that is ok.  - Even if she wasn't, at this age I wouldn't worry too much.|`|n8f9Rocdaa	My 15 month old does not talk either! Don't be concerned she will be fine. When she is 2 years old is when you should be concerned until then don't worry about it!|`|Ei1TcLclaa	No, my youngest (well, 2nd youngest now that she has a younger sister) cousin turned 1 on Oct. 25th and she can't really talk all that well either. Another cousin, who turns 2 in May, just started talking 3-4 months ago. She will get it. There's no need to be concerned.
HOdblqIkaa	Call her mother and explain to her that kicking a minor out of her house is illegal and she better go get the girl before the cops are called. she can get cited for child neglect. if you are willing offer to take your step daughter in until her mom can figure out what her own deal is. you dont kick a 15 year old out for no reason, and whatever reason it was couldnt have been great enough to kick her out. you ground a child, you dont put them in the streets. offer to take her in as fast as you can and make sure that her mother realizes what she did was pretty messed up, dangerous, and illegal.|`|YFx8N0wjaa	find out why<br>  check her into a hotel (over the phone)<br>  buy here a bus ticket <br>  have her stay with you for a few days <br>  if you want ask her to move it (your choice)|`|QJRM2IEEaa	If you and you're husbands ex wife are on good terms, call the mother and see whats up.

Then i would ring her mum be nice dont take sides just try and find out whats going on,maybe get your husband to speak to them and if it turns out she has been kicked out let her stay, or say she can stay till things have died down. need more info really like how is your relationship with the step daughter and mother?  do you mind if she stays with you. Good luck  xx
xJW1RSaAaa	If your hapy with that routine why change it? Children need routine and support, but its happier and healthier all round to let your  child lead the change.

vygYFdsSaa	You should absolutely buy Plan B. Better safe than sorry, pre-ejaculate contains sperm and it only takes one little sperm to impregnate a girl. Good luck|`|8d5f0adc83a9aec3f83894da97ca8d80aa	I would definitely do a plan B, just to be on the safe side. It's rare, but it IS supposedly possible to get pregnant from the pre-ejactulate, that's got sperm in it too, from what I've heard.|`|QYYWBrG7aa	you can`t just "Accidentally" have unprotected sex.|`|AA11880387	yes, it's called pre ***, it's not a big thing since it doesn't shoot out, it's just a small small bit that comes out on the tip. And unless she is one of the really sperm friendly girls she shouldn't be pregnant. BUT I would def, get the pills. Like you said 18 too young to be celebrating father's day.  I would use them from now on infact, because you know, condoms aren't 100%. So that should be a price you'd be willing to pay.|`|Oz05FKLqaa	She shouldnt be pregnant unless you ejaculated in her,pre sperm happens right before your about to ejaculate.For example:If your about to ejaculate and you pull out;pre sperm is released and could get your partner pregnant.Dont worry about it,everything should be ok.|`|YrmJpfdZaa	as long as you didnt ejaculate inside her, you shouldnt worry about it so hard. of course there is a chance for everyhting, no matter how small it is|`|7c0ff0cdc42bafa66ae7ea8350f673d9aa	the thing is, do you remember whether you ejaculated in her or not??<br>  then if you want to do prevention.. (hey i;m not suppose to advise bad things!!) get the girl to eat herbal pills that actually fasten her menses... in other words to get her to get menses earlier...|`|bGRexKPyaa	Get the plan b pill.<br>  <br>  Its free at planed parent hoods, or its 40 bucks at CVS drug stores.<br>  <br>  40 is worth it, rather than having to spend hundreds for diapers and ect...<br>  <br>  Pre *** is coming out every second its inside of her.|`|0pE3dhT8aa	You accidentally the whole STD|`|hprR6qfHaa	you're most likely fine, but check anyway =p|`|Tmr7f3Xgaa	If you're lucky you'll get to have a baby.|`|FaS3CT5waa	yes to the pills, but to be on the safe side go see a doctor....|`|OeOSn5eWaa	get the pill and go to a doctor|`|DTg3USppaa	It seems as though some women get pregnant the first time their 'trap' gets in contact with sperm... other women like me, it took about 2 years for me to get pregnant and it was a common occurance here !!! :P. So anyways, yes you do have sperm that comes out (precum) and yes that can cause her to have a baby (become pregnant) <br>  Don't worry about it though, if she misses her period just worry about it then. Right now she has like a 2% chance considering you didn't fully go in her...:)<br>  <br>  GL<br>  <br>  <br>  If it will make you feel better just get the plan b and leave it at that :)|`|cAkWsA1Aaa	Yes, with unprotected sex it is always possible to impregnate, even when only for a second, although, the possibility is less. Checking for pregnancy should be on your to-do list, not to scare you. The chances are slim, but they are there. Seeing that you are only eighteen I would check soon. If she is, I suggest that you do what you please. In my opinion, having a child at that age is not a great idea.|`|vbViwCOQaa	within a second a girl could get pregenant so you should go get a pregnency test and find out, but please if she is please dont get an abortion give it up for adoption or have your parents look after it till you can handle a kid.|`|AA10963548	Don't worry. If both of you know you made a mistake, then most likely nothing will come of it. If you are going to drink, stay away from each other to calm the hormones.|`|ZB524v05aa	yes, it is possible to get pregnant.<br>  The morning after pill is only effective if taken within 72 hours of intercourse. have the girl call her doctor immediately!|`|okV2yx8Maa	Try the pills amd if u still feel uncertain visit a docter|`|olGEQjzIaa	Time machine FTW.|`|dD2j2j71aa	If you were that drunk it's a miracle you didn't have brewer's droop.|`|8sphY203aa	see what drinking can do!!|`|lA9eKHxnaa	oh no u have aids|`|MGvdpKwlaa	You can only take the plan b pill if it is less than 48 hours after you have unprotected sex. If it has been longer than that I don't know what you could do for that except to pray that she's not pregnant. If she does become pregnant than there's not really much that you can do. Please whatever happens if she is pregnant please don't have an abortion because that baby is a miracle from God and even if the 2 of yall ain't able to care for the baby there is some couple out there who are not able to have a child and will be glad to give your baby a loving home. Who knows if your girlfriend is pregnant when you see that baby your heart will melt and nothing else will matter except the fact that you love the baby and can't live without him or her. Having a baby is an amazing feeling. Good luck and God Bless!|`|wRl0dgQTaa	Well.. I mean some people do get pregnant from pre-***: that's often how people using the "pull out" method get caught (as in pulling out just before the guy comes). But just because you were hard really doesn't mean you "pre-came" into her.<br>  <br>  Honestly, my man & I been using the "pull out" method for 3 years and haven't gotten pregnant yet. (Pls note that we are old enough & more than willing to accept the consequences of our actions if I were to get pregnant.)<br>  <br>  Also, take a look at the "trying to conceive" (TTC) section: You'll see that for a lot of women, being able to get pregnant needs a lot of calculations: It has to be the right day, the right time of the month, etc. So even if you were trying to get her pregnant that night by getting her drunk, it mightn't even have worked.<br>  <br>  Good luck with it anyways. It's too late for morning after pills at this time (Most brands have to be taken within 48 to 72 hours) so, just be more careful next time ;-p<br>  <br>  V.
ABwnRvfAaa	Speak to his parents.  They need to handle this.  If they don't then, tell your nephew that this can't keep happening.  Explain what exactly bugs you and why.  Tell him that from now on the answer will be no and follow through.  Talk to him to about how stealing (which is what he's doing) is wrong and how it needs to stop.  If it's any consolation, my 10 year old son is going through a food phase like this.  It's driving us bananas and he's grounded more often than not lately, but this too shall pass.  Good luck!|`|AA11739944	Just tell him what you said already: "really kid don't u have parents of your own to feed you or can u make yourself a bowl of cereal". Tell him you count everything and if you find something missing you'll hold his head in the toilet and flush. Seriously. I'd do that if my nephew stole my food.|`|AA12215968	He is acting like a puppy, getting attention this way from you two, who I am sure he loves a lot.<br>  He will start putting on weight if he hasn't already with this routine, so get Mom and Dad on board. Play outside with him if you have time and reward with trips to the library or the park rather than food rewards. Maybe you could cut out the junk for a few weeks just to break the pattern. Sit on the sofa eating carrot sticks and your problem will probably disappear.|`|mrunUkhYaa	that's a hard one! you can't choose between family and family! But have you considered moving out?

Yet i hav some friends that understand wat they're doing, and are allowed to do pretty much everything without parents.

Also since Taylor Swift is a younger artist, there will probably be a lot of other teenagers there. I think it is pretty safe, and if none of then have a cell phone, maybe you could let them borrow yours for the night as long as they promise to be careful with it. Have a quick safety talk with them and they should be good to go!|`|ixWiCA0paa	If you trust your daughter then it should be fine.  Taylor Swift is a country singer who is 19, so I don't think you should have a problem with that.<br>  <br>  The only thing is, tickets are practically sold out everywhere.|`|H7x1sZGTaa	Yes, I think you should now is the time you want to start instilling trust in her, prove to her that you do trust her and your not overprotective (no offense). Its only a year difference between them she has to learn sooner or later..|`|iORKgGG2aa	if shes going to get picked up and dropped off then yes that does sound to bad to me.<br>  <br>  taylor swift is a country/pop singer<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlbB7qt6v_0" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlbB7qt6v...</a><br>  <a href="http://images.google.com/images?hl=en&q=taylor%20swift&um=1&ie=UTF-8&sa=N&tab=wi" rel="nofollow">http://images.google.com/images?hl=en&q=...</a>|`|jx6L5t3Paa	I think it depends on the size of the concert. <br>  I think as long as your daughter and her friends stick together, and are good kids overall there wont be any problems. Just make sure at least one of them has their cellphones [or a cell phone] <br>  <br>  :D|`|bOfgQzTWaa	shes a country singer and shes like 19 only and wheres cloths i like her i'm 17 if you trust her and she promises to stay with her friends and you pick her and drop her off i think that would be fine|`|rhvA4G4Paa	yeah, they have lots of security at those things.<br>  <br>  i would just drop her off and pick her up and make sure she calls you when shes inside. <br>  <br>  and tell her not to get lost from her friends.|`|Jucak0HLaa	I wouldn't let mine.There are predators everywhere.|`|aSuLnvoSaa	taylor swift is a country singer, she sings songs about teenage life and love and following your dreams, etc.. she's like 19 years old and sings quiet.  its perfectly safe music for them to listen to!<br>  <br>  <br>  about letting them go to the concert alone.... idk..... concerts are concerts, (although death metal ones are freaky) pick a specific meeting place after the concert and make sure their phones are on <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  but the music is fine|`|BBfIXcI0aa	Talk to her and her friends beforehand, and make sure that they understand that they have to stick together...and to trust their gut feelings. They'll think you're dumb for the reminder, but remind them anyway not to eat or drink anything offered by a stranger unless it was sealed in its original packaging. <br>  As long as one of them has a phone with them, I think they'll be fine to go to this. Taylor Swift's music is generally very sweet, pro-social, fun "chick music," and isn't likely to result in moshing or attract the kind of people you want your daughter to stay away from in herds.|`|WjSJBWl7aa	Yep otherwise she's gonna be hurt and angry that you don't trust her.<br>  <br>  My mother's denyed me two concerts now. It drives me mad. I do understand though - I don't pick the safest kind of bands to go see [metal!] but.. I'm eighteen.. I'm not stupid to take drugs and I'm well practised in karate ..seriously...<br>  <br>  Just let her go. Taylor Swift will be a harmless concert. She reminds me of Cinderella..|`|90nnM99Paa	you don't know who taylor swift is??????????<br>  alright that's beside the point.<br>  I hardly think there will be burnouts at this concert, she's country pop for crying out loud. <br>  come on, do some research.|`|YQrKQ5PAaa	Uhm... common sense, much?
XxhenzC0aa	It really sounds like your preggers!  If so congrats!  You just need to go to store and buy a test and take it.   The bleeding if its not heavy could be implantation happening.  The cramps too.  Wish I had at least some of these symptoms.  I want to be pregnant so bad.  7 days late today and took test and it was neg.  Im sad!  Good Luck with all!|`|N89HLv92aa	maybe....but I dont understand your question very well.
FlVLN3Ehaa	We just went camping with our 4 week old. As long as bub is kept out of the sun and is kept hydrated, there's no problem. Those rules apply even when you are at home. When you say "it wouldn't be very fun" do you mean for your SIL, the baby or yourself? Babies are part of life and go where their mothers go. There's no way she should be leaving a two month old at home while she goes on holiday and no reason why your brother should be leaving his family home to go on holiday either. Be nice to new mothers, they need it.|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	i took my son on a 12 hours car trip at 3 months old again at 16 months and he is 23 months old now and we are going again next month. it never bothered my son and we went to the beach and what not. i would never leave my 1 year old for a week just because of the ride|`|heDtLdz5aa	looks like to me that you don't like you brothers girlfriend very much and all you want is for someone to be on your side..why else would you post this question again with these other added details....let it be..if she wants to go and your brother wants to go so be it..they are the ones that have to look after the baby..why don't you just mind your own business and worry about you and the fun you will have..|`|uGqYoZNEaa	I think it will be fine with enough rest stops and attention to new mommy and new baby.  To me it sounds like you guys just don't want her there, but she is your niece/nephew mother.  I would think you'd wanna include the new members of the family.|`|5jT9cO2haa	The baby should be fine as long as there is enough stops for resting, changing diapers etc.  but it sounds more like you don't want her to go?
HclKftzAaa	i have never heard of a baby having it's head 'shaped' once it was born, and can't imagine it would be good for them... Their head is supposed to be funny shaped after a vaginal birth. And goes back to normal on it's own.<br>  <br>  it is true that about 1/1000 babies are born with a hearing impairment though.|`|vKEYa8aeaa	no ive never even heard of a nurse trying to shape a babys head. is he sure that they werent just cleaning the baby, measuring, putting on the hat, etc??|`|871bf9188469fa10404159e74fc6200caa	I was not aware they could shape a babies head lol, it normally rounds out on its own..|`|FLEXqVoiaa	A baby's head is not made out of Play-Doh. Have you ever seen a young baby with a really strange shaped head? If it were possible for a nurse to change the shape of a newborn's head, wouldn't all babies have perfectly round heads?<br>  <br>  EDIT: Also, if the baby underwent a successful cochlear implant, it means the inner ear (impaired cochleae) was what caused the hearing impairment, not for any reason that would have anything to do with the baby's brain. Now perhaps if he saw the nurse, I don't know, shove a finger up the baby's ears or something. That would be cause for concern. But even that would not be a scientifically sound explanation for a fairly common birth defect.|`|XOtOMncwaa	I'm sure what the father saw was the nurse just checking the baby. They go over every square inch of a babies body after it is born to check for defects, and I'm sure feeling the baby's skull is on the list. You can't shape a baby's head, my sons head was horribly misshapen for the first few days of his life. It's something that has to be fixed on it's own, not something that we can force to go back to the way it should be. I'm sure the baby was hearing impaired before the nurse touched it, things like that happen, I'm sorry to hear about that but rest assured it didn't happen because the nurse was touching the baby's head!|`|5ZrrOEbWaa	i don't think so lol<br>  judging by the shape of my brother's head|`|AA12227209	I am a nurse who attends deliveries and assesses babies and occasionally has to resuscitate them. What I am pretty sure he was witnessing was either drying of the head to help keep the baby from losing any heat, or she was checking the fontanelles (or soft spots) to make sure there were no abnormalities. Nurses are not trained to "shape" a baby's head after birth, those things fix themselves, babies heads are made to mold to the shape of the birth canal to fit through it, that is why they sometimes have a very funny shape. Also, more than likely, rubbing a baby's head after birth would have nothing to do with hearing impairment.|`|aBWu7tyHaa	i'm not sure about the nurses being "trained" to shape a babies head after birth but we had to do that with my first born.  he was in the birth canal for so long he had a cone head pretty bad and we just sort of rubbed it every now and then.  it was actually comforting for him and would put him to sleep a lot.  i've never heard of it having anything to do with the hearing and the cochlear implants but i would have him ask the baby's pediatrician or audiologist.  they should definately be able to help.  best of luck
Wrf5orAuaa	Relaxation techniques. See the link|`|IFDfpbFJaa	study Study study!  What's the test?|`|DP3rQkrtaa	drink a nice warm cup of milk and go to sleep after that, it will be easier.

I just always let myself know that I can always leave and have a blank mind. lol. That usually works for me.|`|A1mln67Aaa	Go to bed early.|`|Cn9WIJhgaa	Study, study , study. This way you know you will do good!|`|j0zhKhIEaa	Go to bed|`|wfE3mo7Naa	Weed|`|kuFAx4ymaa	go to sleep.|`|D9iE2JBKaa	drink a red bull|`|JC6ACC7eaa	Breathing exercises are easy, especially if you can't get to sleep or your mind seems fit to explode in the middle of studying.  There are many ways to do this, but you should inhale for 5-10 seconds, mentally counting.  Hold your breath for 3 seconds, then exhale for the same interval as you inhaled.  Then hold for an additional 3 seconds before repeating the process.<br>  <br>  If this doesn't seem to work, you can try visualization.  Imagine yourself with a favorite person, place, or situation.  It's kind of like a guided day dream.  For instance, if you like beaches, imagine yourself walking down a long sand staircase onto the warm sand, feeling the hot, gritty sensation between your toes.  Whatever you choose, think it through slowly and deliberately, but for an established period of time so that you can get back into studying without getting tired.<br>  <br>  Be sure to also devote enough time for sleep and get up early enough to get breakfast, be it leftover pizza or fresh pancakes and orange juice.  Maybe even get a school breakfast, whatever you like.  If you are a coffee drinker, be sure not to forget it.  If not, do not drink anything terribly decaffeinated, as it will make you jittery and overly nervous. <br>  <br>  Dress comfortably, but try not to dress poorly.  If you don't feel good about yourself--every aspect of yourself--than you won't perform well on the test.<br>  <br>  When you actually sit down for the test, if there a couple that you don't know, DON'T PANIC.  Just breathe. And don't be afraid of skipping questions.  For most state exams, all the questions are weighted equally, so there's no harm in skipping a few in the beginning as long as you go back to them.  Don't just fill in your best guess, either, as you are less likely to go back  to that question at the end if there is already an answer in that slot.  <br>  <br>  Finally, get off the computer!!  Get your nose into those books or whatever it takes to get the job done.  Remember that everybody else is in the same boat that you are--even the teachers and administrators in the exam room are stressed out for you guys.  Once you wake up from a good night's sleep, you will feel better about yourself already.  Try to keep that start-of-the-day optimism throughout the day, and you will succeed.|`|bvUMwDgyaa	Do something you enjoy. Listen to music, cook some food, chill out and read a book, something to get the exams off your mind. Do each of the things that you enjoy doing for 45 minutes. Then for the fifteen minutes in between, study for a different topic each time, read off of flash cards, study from the text book, or quickly go through study guides. Then, start your enjoyable activity again, maybe a different one. Don't do anything too complicated, like trying to tackle a Shakespeare novel or learn a new recipe. Just pick up a favorite book, or make some cookies. Fun and rewarding. Idk, do whatever relaxes you.|`|p3VaFWB9aa	yep i gots reading tomarrow i live in tampa<br>  <br>  Fcat = Florida Child Abuse Test<br>  <br>  FCAT-FDAT<br>  <br>  just think of funny **** like that and then just focus and dont a carry ur cell phone and get invalidated<br>  <br>  <br>  well reading was a breeze but math is gonna SUCK 2marrow!!!! lol|`|35e7dfb2f7131768216a3d6dd973f543aa	You need lots of rest, and be sure to eat a healthy breakfast too.

WYk0zYdhaa	Congrats on your pregnancy!  <br>  I'm sorry to hear about your parents.. that's hard.  <br>  Even at 5 weeks your body is flooded with hormones that you are not used to.  Hence the crying and laughing all sometimes 5 minutes apart lol.  That is normal,  but if you are getting so depressed you don't want to eat or constantly worrying yes, stress can effect the baby.  <br>  You need to be able to step back from problems and stress (as much as you can) take a nice bath with candles and your favorite music (just make sure water is not too hot) and take a breather.  If mom and dad are coming to you with their issues it's time to say you love them but it's really stressing you out and you can't take that now.  It's okay, your mom of all ppl should understand having had babies of her own;)<br>  <br>  If someone has TOO much stress they can miscarry.  When you have your prenatal visit be sure and let your doc know about these feelings.  <br>  <br>  So yeah you want to be careful and make sure you have some one to talk to.  Preferrably another female that you can relate to.  <br>  Take care of yourself and hey let me know if you'd like to talk.  Sometimes it's easier talking to a stranger ;)<br>  <br>  Best of luck and blessings:)|`|yKS2UI87aa	Stress is not good for the baby. But, now that you know you are, you can change it. I suggest going to a counselor it sounds like you may still be in school so I would ask your guidance counselor for help they can point you in the right direction. I'm not sure why your ex and you are no longer together but it will get better with time, I know, I've been there too. I can only imagine it's worse for you as you are also pregnant. Try and find the silver lining in the situation, such as if your parents are being violent to each other it is better they are not together. Good Luck.|`|mqHL4UcRaa	Just try to keep your head up and do things that make you happy. Its okay to be a little emotional as most women are while pregnant. A lot of it might be hormones. Your body is overloaded with hormones which causes you to be overly emotional in the 1st trimester. It will get better once you hit 12+ weeks. You will start to be happier and more energetic in your 2nd trimester. <br>  <br>  If your stressed A LOT then yeah it does effect the baby. It raises your blood pressure and causes the baby's heart to beat faster. So it does have a medical effect. <br>  <br>  So dont stress about being stressed. Just try to do things for yourself that make you happy, like a funny movie, a bath, pedicure, a nice long walk at the park, etc.|`|N89HLv92aa	Are you a teenager? Are you living at home around your parents divorce?  If so you may need to tell them that all the fighting is bothering you. Yes stress is very bad for the baby, especially when you are only 5 weeks pregnant. It can cause miscarriages. Try some stress releiveing techniques such as soaking your feet in some hot water or go for a walk. The fresh air will be good for you. Good Luck and God Bless!!!|`|6zkKEeGCaa	yes it can be. the baby feels everything you feel. so if you're sad the baby is sad. its hard, i can relate a bit. Last week i had a close encounter.. i wouldnt stop crying had been really stresses, and well out of nowhere i started bleeding. [[im 8wks]]. Thankfully everything came out alright, but stress can really affect you and the baby. Hope all gets well for you. And congrats on the baby.|`|X3K25srLaa	Ofcourse it is.. very bad.. every emotion you have the baby receives... try meditating... say all negative out ... all negative out.. ony positive.. I know you will sound silly, but it helps me.. it helps me take deep breaths and keep repeating this.. we all have crappy things going on on our lives, but we have to be strong and keep moving forward.. I mean think about it.. your parents divorce... is there really something u could do .. think ... are they better being seperated or getting back together.. I mean, if they are going to get back just to keep fighting that is even worse...<br>  <br>  your ex.. if he really really loved u he would be w/ u.. u cannot force anyone to ur side... that is when loving yourself comes in.. love yourself so much.. always know that you are not alone in this world.. becus God is watching over us.. and I hope that you are not one of those people that blames God for all the wrong things that happen..<br>  <br>  The beauty of our creation from God is that he gaves us the freedom to be us.. to live life the way we want too.. everything could be cool because that is the way we want it... everything could be peacful cus thats the way we chose to have it.. or u could turn to the other side and be completely the opposite... I truly hope that this advice helps u.. good luck...<br>  <br>  "I know times are hard, but we can make them better"|`|EbAMtQsHaa	yeah it can be just try to relax if your not careful you could loose the baby|`|E23PtUEtaa	I would think so...|`|pNa06Qhxaa	Everything you feel the baby can sense. Your emotions effect your heart rate and blood flow and in turn the baby who is the recipient of this blood feels you stress and it response accordingly. It gets stressed because you are stressed. But being as it is so early in your pregnancy the effects of such stress are uncertain. If you discover ways of relaxing yourself it will benefit your baby, as well as have a helping hand in your delivery. Relaxation techniques are helpful when in labor. They focus your mind and "dulls" the pain.|`|i7QJAgquaa	yes it is when i was pregnant i was in parenting classes and the baby feels everything you feel,im now dealing with my parents divorcing also and i have to daughters now and when they get me in between their problems example:asking me who is right....tell her/him to die or to get out of my life ect... it puts me in a bad mood. i don't wanna talk to nobody and i snap easily. so what i have done now is tell my mom and dad "you know what don't tell me your problems with my mom/dad<br>  i don't care i have delt with it for so long and im sick of it.work it out by yourselves. you decided to marry that person not me. and i didn't decide for you two to be my parents but you are so i would like to have happy moment with both of you not depressing moments."<br>  i know it sound mean but that was the way my dad and mom got the message. <br>  and congrats and the baby|`|RxhBUkwSaa	Oh, sweetie... it's not good for you, but your baby will be just fine.  He or she is insulated in a lovely warm world for months now, and giving you plenty of time to change your focus from the adults in your life who are dragging your down, to the baby in your life who can lift you up!<br>  <br>  Please try to extract yourself from the scene as much as possible.  If you live there, maybe there is another place you can spend a lot of time... like with a peaceful friend or family member?  The more calm and peace you can bring into your world, the better start you'll have.  Don't let your squabbling parents ruin it for both of you!|`|PA7LOoQ9aa	i know what everyone will say is you shouldnt stress. and honestly u shouldnt, but just because your pregnant doesnt mean problems just go away or you cant stress. it isnt good to stress so much, i can form to having a miscarriage or other problems for the baby or yourself. i am 23 pregnant with my second child and my husband up and decided he didnt want to be married anymore. so i had to move back in with my dad and my life is a mess most days, but its hard not to stress. but ihave spent alot of days cryring and stressing and i feel bad because it couldnt hurt the baby. my advice is try and stay away as much as possible from the divorce problems. try to keep from being involved and hearing about it if you have to tell them you dont want to hear about it and at least for yours and the babys sake they need to respect that. as far as your ex i felt the same way, we are now trying to date again and just take things slow, i would just give it time he'll come around. good luck|`|43f703a117f1434d70de1356556b8006aa	If there is violence, you should call the police.  Domestic violence is NOT OKAY.<br>  <br>  And you being sad will not hurt your child.  Just make sure you are eating healthy and taking vitamins.  Try not to get too stressed out, as it can raise your blood pressure.  But I'm sure your baby will be fine.  What pregnancy doesn't get stressful?|`|ZfNCkHllaa	Ya, it can be...talk to your doc...and take some you time...stress is bad for you and baby.<br>  <br>  hope things get better...sorry your having such a bad time.<br>  <br>  and the ex its hard. but you need to try to get over him. focus on you and your baby..put everything else a side..<br>  <br>  hope you feel better soon.|`|044WNiRtaa	Just as what you eat affects your baby, so too does your stress level and your emotional health. It is important that you minimize your stress and anxiety during pregnancy to provide your baby with an optimal environment in which to grow.|`|PUdWfF0yaa	I'm so sorry to hear that. Is the stress bad? Yes! Right now your hormones are going crazy, so that doesn't add to it all. Try to find things to do that will get your mind off of everything. Go baby shopping. Good Luck and GOD Bless.|`|JZbQjRyraa	Yes it is very bad for the baby. The baby could turn retarted. The baby is conected to the mother is pregnant. Be happy. Go out outside.  Fresh air is really healthy for the baby.<br>  <br>  Hope it helps|`|1r05fktRaa	can be bad for the baby|`|2Pp2cDbJaa	yes it is, maybe talk to your doctor about it, do your parents know your pregnant, maybe you can stay will family for a while to get away from all the drama of the divorce|`|AA11085356	Yes, stress can be hard on the baby, as well as yourself. Try to take yourself away from all the drama if you can. I don't kno how old you are or if you are living on your own or not, but try to find someplace you can go to just relax. Take bubble baths, read a good book, window shop, take a walk... I kno it's hard, my mom went through a bad divorce with her 2nd husband, but just try and separate yourself from all of that. Focus on yourself and your baby. If you have some free time, maybe take up a hobby like painting or something. I have also found that keeping a journal can really help with stress, especially when you don't have anyone to talk to. You can write down anything in there to get it off your chest, and nobody has to see it. But whatever you decide to do, remember that it's not just yourself that you have to worrie about anymore. I do hope that I helped a bit, I've been in those shoes before! Good luck to you, and feel free to email me if you need someone to talk to...|`|seU9VwIJaa	Studies have shown that it can have a negative effect on your baby. That's why doctors think it's better for people to stay on anti-depressants if the person has severe depression. I'd suggest therapy for more than one reason. It will help your baby and it seems like you have some nasty things going on in your life that need to be dealt with. <br>  Congrats and good luck! I really hope things look up!|`|1d02fcff81d2bb070fc361fbe28e3606aa	Definitely.  Your blood pressure is up, you probably aren't eating or sleeping well and when you're depressed, your body actually experiences chemical changes because of that.|`|ejrxNVD1aa	it  might be bad for the baby

Eye contact is very important as well. I used to be very shy until I moved around a lot. The way I got over my "fear of people" was not caring what anybody thought of me. I realized that everybody is different, and if I don't talk to other people, then I won't know what's going on in life. You miss out on a lot of things when you're shy, so take the first step towards being yourself. Give yourself time. You have to love yourself before other people can love you. Good luck!!|`|070fa16860f897901118c74cbdcab3b5aa	Sometimes it's really hard, but you have to make yourself let go and be yourself.  After a few minutes, you'll calm down and feel great.

They can also be confusing, especially if dating is new to you. Once you know that the person that you like also likes you, you may be unsure of what to do next. You can start by learning about what makes a dating relationship healthy and safe. <br>  When do teens start dating?<br>  First, there is no best age for teens to begin dating. Every person will be ready for a dating relationship at a different time. Different families may have certain rules about dating, too. When you decide to start a new dating relationship, it should be because you care about someone and not because you feel like you have to start dating. A dating relationship is a special chance to get to know someone, and share your thoughts and feelings with each other.<br>  Do you have the relationship blues?Check out 5 Ways to Heal a Broken Heart<br>  Healthy dating relationships should start with the same things that healthy friendships have: good communication, honesty, and respect. Dating relationships are a little different because they may include physical affection, like hugging, kissing, or holding hands. As you start to date, you may find yourself wanting to spend all of your time with this person, but it is important to spend time apart as well as together. This will allow you to have a healthy relationship with the person you are dating and with your friends and family at the same time. <br>  Be smart 4You!Learn all about relationshipsafety, dating violence, and what to do ifyou ever feel uncomfortable or scared on a date!<br>  Most importantly, you should NEVER feel pressured to do something that you don't want to do. The other person should always respect your right to say no to anything that makes you feel uncomfortable. It is important that you are both clear with each other about what you will and will not do. By talking about how each of you feel about a lot of things, you may avoid getting pressured into making a decision on the spot about something very important. <br>  Take a quiz on how to stay safe in relationships.<br>  Tips for having healthy and safe relationships:<br>  ·Get to know a person by talking on the phone or at school before you go out for the first time. <br>  ·Go out with a group of friends to a public place the first few times you spend time together. <br>  ·Plan fun activities like going to the movies, a picnic, the mall, or for a walk. <br>  ·Be clear with the other person about what you feel comfortable doing and what time your parents/guardian want you to be home. <br>  ·Tell at least one friend and your parents/guardians who you are going out with and where you are going. Be sure to also tell them how to reach you. <br>  <a href="http://www.girlshealth.gov/relationships/dating.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.girlshealth.gov/relationships...</a><br>  <br>  Dating at Age 12?<br>  <br>  <br>  Middle School Expert Advice from Connie Collins <br>  Question: Is it all right for my daughter to date at age 12? She thinks that we are being overprotective.<br>  Answer: I encourage you to think about all the reasons you decided that your daughter was too young to date. You, as parents, know all the extreme dangers: drugs, drinking, driving, sexual predators, date rape. And you know the more subtle dangers: focusing on the date to the exclusion and detriment of studies and/or friends; emotional confusion. You know your daughter and you know her level of mental and sexual maturity -- or lack thereof. <br>  Are you being protective? Absolutely. That is your job. As for being "overprotective," every 12-year-old I know uses that word to push a parent's buttons, to excite those feelings of guilt. You are her parents. You do know best. <br>  In the meantime, prepare yourself and your daughter for the time she will begin dating. There are some excellent pamphlets and books on the subject that can help you out. Consult with your child's school counselor and/or at your local library. Discuss it with her. Look forward with her to that very important even in her life -- her first date.<br>  Thirteen-Year-Old Is Ready to Date<br>  Middle School Expert Advice from Connie Collins <br>  Question: I'm 13 and my mother won't let me date until I'm 15. I think that that I should be able to date now -- I wouldn't do anything inappropriate. I haven't tried talking to her yet about how I feel. What should I say?<br>  Answer: I'm really glad you are willing to talk to your mom about how you are feeling. My guess is that your mom doesn't believe you will do anything inappropriate, but like most of us moms, knows that other kids don't always do so. For that reason, to protect their daughters and to give them time to learn skills in relating to others, parents set dating age requirements. A date usually implies going somewhere alone with another person. How do you get there? At 13, neither you nor your date can drive. What do you do if your date uses alcohol or drugs and/or pressures you for sex? Have you really had enough experience that you can handle those kinds of situations? Be honest! <br>  My guess is that your mom is not going to change her mind, but I would encourage you to talk with her about your inviting small groups of boys and girls over for some activity like a picnic, swimming, going to an arcade, hiking, biking -- whatever you and others might enjoy. Two things will happen. You will learn about some of the boys and you will learn how to interact with them. At the same time your mom will have a chance to build up her trust in you and give you advice if anything happens that you are not sure of. <br>  Enjoy your middle-school years. Learn about others. Learn about yourself. When you are ready, your mom will let you date.<br>  <br>  Should 14-Year-Old Talk to Boys on the Phone?<br>  Middle School Expert Advice from Connie Collins <br>  Question: My 14-year-old daughter thinks she is ready to talk to boys on the phone. In the past, she has had some physical experiences with boys. I don't think she is responsible enough to stop boys from talking inappropriately to her -- or maybe she just likes it! Many of my friends think I'm taking this too seriously. I told her maybe when she's 15, but now I'm not sure when. What do you think? Am I being unfair or unreasonable?<br>  Answer: It appears that there are some greater issues than talking on the phone with which you and your daughter need to resolve. You say she has had some physical experiences with boys and you imply she likes the attention from boys. Perhaps the first place to start is by building up your relationship with your daughter, especially in the area of her sexuality. A good place for moms and daughters to get help in establishing a basis for talking about sexuality are the classes for parents and teens by Planned Parenthood. I strongly urge you to consider enrolling in these classes.<br>  Talking on the phone is a privilege, not a right. Whether teens are talking to boys or girls on the phone, the rules should be the same, so I am hoping you have set up the guidelines in a family meeting, or at the very least in a calm discussion with your daughter. Those guidelines should include: <br>  1) The hours that your daughter can receive calls. e.g. not after dinner, not after 8:00;<br>  2) Telling you the first and last name of who called if you ask;<br>  3) Talking for a limited time -- 15-20 minutes or less; and<br>  4) Privacy for your daughter but with you overseeing the conversation in case she appears upset or confused by the call. <br>  Trust your daughter, but use common sense and your intuition about what kind of conversations are taking place. If you answer the phone and someone wishes to speak with your daughter, always ask who is calling; get the last name if you don't know the child. Hopefully you daughter will trust enough to ask for your help if a caller is out of line.<br>  Is 14 Too Young to Date?<br>  Middle School Expert Advice from Connie Collins <br>  Question: My 14-year-old daughter has a boy "friend" who calls almost every night and they talk for at least 2 hours. She wanted to have him, his friend, and her friend over one night to watch a movie. The boys promised they would leave by 9:30 and she made it clear that they weren't going to "do anything." My husband and I also agreed that she could not date until she was at least done with freshman year. She thought this was very unreasonable and argued that her friend's parents were letting a boy that was 16 and living in another town drive over and pick her up for a movie. What is appropriate for kids my daughter's age?<br>  Answer: Your daughter is using the old saw "my friend's parents are...." That is very normal and, as is appropriate, you as her parents have said she may not date until she has finished her freshman year. <br>  Preteens definitely need the experience of interacting in safe situations like the movie watching in your home. I do think it is appropriate provided that you are there. That means you approve the movie, you welcome the guests, you go in the room from time to time, and you -- along with your daughter -- bid them all good night at 9:30. <br>  I encourage you to think about the 2 hours she spends on the phone every night with her friend (no matter what the gender). There are some boundaries here that I think are being violated. When is your daughter doing her homework, reading, interacting with the family, doing chores, seeing other friends, developing her own hobbies, etc.? Is this a family phone? Ten to 15 minutes at the most should be sufficient. I am supposing she sees this friend every day at school -- they can talk then. <br>  If this is her own phone, I must admit to a personal prejudice: Why does a young teen need a personal line? Even with a personal line teen phone use needs to be monitored. That's the job we parents must take seriously to ensure our children's -- and our own -- safety.<br>  <br>  Dad Is Overprotective of Daughter<br>  Middle School Expert Advice from Connie Collins <br>  Question: My husband doesn't want boys calling our 13-year-old daughter on the phone at all. He will allow her to email back and forth with boys, since we will be able to read their messages to see if they are inappropriate. I think he's being too overprotective about the telephone use, and my daughter does also, even though she has accepted the rule and not broken it. Do you think it is appropriate for boys and girls to talk on the telephone at this age?<br>  Answer: Everybody -- especially teenagers -- need and require privacy and space. By reading her email, you are invading her privacy and space without any good reason except a suspicion. It is through her interaction with others -- boys or girls -- that your daughter learns about her self and how to relate to others. If we as parents want our children to be trustworthy, we have to trust them until they disprove our expectations. It is normal and appropriate for boys and girls to talk on the phone and email each other. <br>  Parents can and should regulate when calls can be received, how long they can last, etc. If you keep the lines of communication between you and your daughter open, she will tell you if a caller is being inappropriate and if she can't handle it. If she has trouble handling a situation, then you can offer suggestions from your own experiences, but you want her to learn and practice these skills on her own as much as possible. <br>  My experience with teens tells me that if you read your child's email and her diary and listen to all her calls, she will withdraw from you and find a way around your rules. I know you don't want that, so I urge you to set your expectations and trust her to behave responsibly. Stay out of her email. Give her some space to grow.<br>  Trusting Your Teen<br>  Middle School Expert Advice from Connie Collins <br>  Question: I am having a tough time right now with my 13-year-old daughter who looks old for her age. She is receiving, in my opinion, way too much attention from older boys. I believe that she is secretly dating a boy who is 15 or 16. I am divorced, so she spends part of the week with me and part with her father. I have expressed my views on dating and there are times when I can't monitor what she is doing, but I try! She locks herself in her room and stays on the phone or she sneaks out late at night to talk to her friends. Recently, I found a young man's picture that was sent to her. <br>  Whenever I try to have a conversation regarding her choice of friends and being responsible and honest with me, she says I'm too judgmental and too strict. She was an honor-roll student two years ago and last year her grades went down. I want her to be more grounded and respectful of my values. I'm looking into therapy for her to help her deal with the divorce. I'm fearful that if I don't address what's going on, it might go beyond normal teen stuff. Everyone in both of our families is trying to offer as much support and love we can. How do I give her some of the freedom that she wants when I don't trust her?<br>  Answer: You are engaged in the eternal struggle between a parent and a child who is seeking her freedom from restrictions (normal teen behavior). It is difficult not to take it personally, but I encourage you to remind yourself often that you are the parent, and while your daughter can have her say, she may not necessarily get her way. <br>  The one thing you cannot control is who likes her and whom she likes, but you do have control on how you respond to her behavior. It is okay not to trust your daughter when she is not trustworthy. You should set the expectations, boundaries, and consequences for study and dating. Discuss with her your expectations and the consequences, and then follow through. An example would be her phone usage. If she is misusing the phone -- sneaking calls to friends, etc. -- a consequence would be to remove her phone. If you would like some help, there are some wonderful parenting books at your local library or your school counselor may have some, too. Parenting support groups are also a good avenue for ideas and for feeling less alone. <br>  Getting your daughter in a children of divorce support group may be even more helpful than individual counseling. My guess is she will resist individual counseling, but I certainly think it is worth a try if a group is not available. <br>  I applaud you for being aware that you must address these issues now. With a mom and family as supportive as you describe, you will find the best way to interact with your daughter and my guess is that she will surprise you with how well she has absorbed your and her father's values.<br>  <a href="http://life.familyeducation.com/parenting/problem-solving/" rel="nofollow">http://life.familyeducation.com/parentin...</a><br>  <br>  Love is like a roller coaster, and dating is like the cart you ride in -- let About Teens help you navigate those twists & turns, and ups & downs!<br>  <a href="http://teenadvice.about.com/library/101/bl_101_love.htm" rel="nofollow">http://teenadvice.about.com/library/101/...</a>|`|5683adcfe3054ce630626800ebbcbbb0aa	Hi my name is____ I ve seen you around and thought you were interested and someone i might like to know better so i was wondering if maybe we could go out to coffee or something sometime...|`|AA11563131	print our sum cute luv lyrics off the net....the stick it in an envelope, make a lil note to him to say hey this is how i feel..|`|AA11723956	Just tell him how you feel life all about exploring the odds.take a chance and be confident.|`|33b87d20c57f13cb426f0e03be5caa25aa	i want to go out wit u!!

See precum starts to come out as soon as the man penitrats and there is semen in it so it is very posible to get pregnant even if the guy doesn't you know.  As for the brown discharge if that is not normal for you then I would say either A. go to the doctors and ask them to do a blood test that will tell you if you are pregnant sooner and more acurate then an at home test or B. Take another at home test in a few days if you don't get a real period before then.  A lot of the time the second line is very light on those at home tests also take it in the morning with your first morning pee.

496adb0cbfb7ab80d70af9b3d934c33daa	As parents we worry about everything, because we love you and cannot imagine losing you. Once when my son was about four I thought something was wrong with him, so I took him to a "special" doctor, and my son said right in front of the guy, "I do not know why you brought me to this guy he is crazier than I am." haha.... It made me realize that maybe I needed to chill out.<br>  <br>  Determining whether you are anorexic is really looking at whether you are eating a healthy diet. Here is the hard part about anorexia....it is a short term solution...people starve themselves to lose weight, but tank their metabolism. It is smarter to eat lots of small meals and keep your metabolism going, so that you do not balloon up when you start to eat again....death is not really a good option either, and that is what happens if you do not eat at all.<br>  <br>  Your partents just love you and they want to see you happy and healthy. Cut them some slack, because kids do not come with an owner's manual. We are making mistakes and learning as we go along too. The best part about going to a "special" doctor is that you now have a new friend to talk with your parents about, and they are the ones paying for it. It is really a beautiful irony.|`|AA11491405	But you are underweight for your height, You can easily pout that 10 pounds back on and not have any worries|`|d57e29c219b565c305798b1e32e4886faa	Parents worry because they love their children and are responsible for their children.  Would you rather than shove you out the door and tell you to live in the gutter?|`|5a3fe266cf6ca1246ffbbc6dbfee9cc3aa	Because my dear they love you and they fear for you and if you are 5'6" you should weigh between 120 - 155 lbs according to all the "charts".    There are a ton of bad examples of people being far too thin to be healthy and we as parents are just afraid.<br>  <br>  I know it's hard to understand and accept.  Just go to the doctor,  take the tests he orders and if you are fine he will tell them...and you can say nicely with a smile  "See Mom,  all that worry for nothing!"   And she'll feel better and so will you  and then maybe you can all talk about things a bit easier.  The more you talk to your parents about what is going on with your life and in your head the more they will trust you and feel comfortable.  And remember sometimes it's not you they don't trust,   it's the rest of this crazy world and all the people in it that may want to hurt you.   <br>  <br>  You are so young and you will understand more when you have a child of your own....you are a precious gift that means more to us than our own life...it's hard to handle,  that kind of love.   It's hard to let you go and make your own mistakes and watch you get hurt (by girls or friends) when we could make it easier for you.   Have some patience with your parents they are only thinking of you...best of luck.|`|AA11626547	120 pounds for your height is too little. <br>  <br>  Your parent's love you, they care. <br>  <br>  Quit your complaining, go to the doctor.

I am 55 and parents never stop worrying about you. My mom is 83 and still does.  One thing to consider is that parents these days don't understand the world their chidren live in because it is changing rapidly, far far far more rapidly than ever before.  So your parents love you so much they want to take you to someone they think can tell for sure because they probably didn't deal with your issues and teens and are trying to keep you healthy and safe in their way.  What do you have to lose if you really think you are telling the truth by going to a dr. ?  There is a huge huge generation gap now. Take this example, a teen can have a cell phone and talk to anyone anywhere any time. Only about 15 years ago, phones were connected to the wall in the kitchen where mom and dad heard everything. It was easier to overhear conversations to make sure you were safe.  You haven't had a long enough time on earth realistically to know the horrors that exist out there. I know you hate to hear that but keep in mind I was an elem teacher and I know "kids".  I wouldn't have wanted to hear it when I was your age either, but there is a lot to be said for experience. Look backwards and what would you advice someone 5 years younger than you to do, for example, 5th grader to 1st grader: "learn to read in 1st as it only gets harder !".  I hope this helps. I'm really one your side.  There are many determinations for too skinny besides what the eye says, like blood workups etc.  Good luck, be patient, and keep on loving those people, your parents who have done so much for you so far.|`|15a16f1a94c650613e43567fdef7cd26aa	i guess its because parents want the best for their kids|`|280dd58dd120cca55b24aed29c6b90beaa	Anorexia is a mental sicknesss caused by a deep desire to look as  style demands.<br>  Those who defeat the sicknes are those that put  intelligence before  instinct. They are the strong.<br>  <br>  Your parent′s  worry is well founded believing that you will not be able to defeat your instinct sickness, due that many people have finally died from this hard to beat mental problem. <br>  <br>  If you are able to maintain you weight of 110 lbs. and not lose any more, you have won and can prove it to your parents.<br>  You ally is the weight balance, keep a control and show it to your parents.|`|47d9f295b6a15f003e55925badf13544aa	Because they love you and are concerned about your health.<br>  <br>  I don't know what you can do to reassure them that you are not having problems with an eating disorder, but it sounds like their protectiveness comes from true concern about you.|`|6620803cd89e575588b0681ebf626517aa	Simply put--they love you and do not want anything bad to happen to you.

When whatever method of testing she used showed that she was pregnant, she began to worry.  What if I'm not getting enough Folic Acid?  What if he's born with no nose?  What if his heart doesn't develop properly?  What if I can't deliver naturally and they can't get the baby out in time?  What if I eat sushi and the baby develops some exotic baby disease?  What if I fall down and the baby dies?  For nine months, 24 hours out of every day, her body and her mind are focused on doing what needs to be done for the tiny life inside her.  When you have that going on, let me assure you, it's nearly impossible to get it OFF your mind, and pregnant mothers worry about everything.<br>  <br>  There is not, however, a break in the worrying after the baby is born.  As difficult and worrisome as the pregnancy was, now the baby is OUT, and SOOOOO many things can happen outside the mother's control.  What if somene drops the baby?  What if he's five months old and not a hint of a tooth (MY GOSH, WHAT IF HE DOESN'T HAVE ANY TEETH AND HAS TO HAVE DENTURES IN KINDERGARTEN??!!??!!)  That other baby sits up, why isn't he sitting up?  According to all the books, he should be sitting up.  What if he has a neurological problem?  What if he's crippled?<br>  <br>  The list goes on and on, and for some reason, for every age, it seems there are more things to worry about.<br>  <br>  Your parents have been worrying about you since your conception, possibly even before that (what if we can't get pregnant???).  They love you.  Their lives are almost not even their own, because so much of every day, and so much of their energy, goes towards caring about you.  <br>  <br>  And how do you thank them for it?  By insisting that they have no right to worry about you when you make what they see as a bad decision about your life or your health.  By insisting that you have the right to do whatever you want with your body, that same body they spent YEARS taking care of.<br>  <br>  You know somethin?  Regardless of whatever popular childrearing experts are saying at the time, your parents, they don't have to trust you.  They don't have to respect your right to damage your own body.  They don't have to treat you, their CHILD, like an adult.<br>  <br>  Now, a girl who is 5'6" and 110 is QUITE skinny.  A guy should probably be even a little heavier than a healthy girl at that height.  They do have some reason to worry, that's not a healthy weight for you to be.  I'm aware that guys in their early or mid-teens can have a growth spurt and shoot up several inches and seem stick-thin for a while.  But you need to accept that your parents' worries are proof that they care a great deal about you.  Go see the doctor, get checked out, don't get offended.  If the doctor says "Mr. and Mrs. James's-parents, he's not anorexic," then great.  <br>  <br>  But don't act like your parents are somehow insulting you by worrying about you.  I realize it annoys you, but it's not something they can stop, and it's not something that is going to just go away.|`|a27c41c486efbbaa8232a23613297ca1aa	Well, they're just really worried for you. To tell you the truth, I'm overweight for my height, but my parents don't pester me about losing weight. You, on the other hand, are definitely underweight for your height (you probably look like some skinny rocker dude, that's okay, some people like that...), but that's not really a problem. <br>  If you want them to stop bothering you about it, just sit down with them for like ten minutes, and explain why you're comfortable with your weight. I did that with my parents, and they accepted my explanation. Still, being under- or overweight sometimes presents health problems, but I don't think they're that serious. It's all down to eating the RIGHT kind of food.<br>  OK, I'm rambling. Anyway, good luck with your parents if you choose to take my advice.
299f19b8a80436701f907753ebf80a18aa	Well let's see...you would always hope that your partner wouldn't cheat on you. It' a horrible thing. I had a family friend (couple) married for over 30 years and the husband cheated on the wife and did get an STD and passed it on to his wife. He did admit it later when he was tested. They got divorced. Bad mistake...it only takes once and she never suspected it. You can always get regular testing!|`|6ccf250bc57b0ab5716aa2509219c4a0aa	both of u  get tested and then youre good to go.|`|AA11126477	wen ur married most women go on the pill so they dont have to ask their husbands|`|c6120dd1ddd5d5625d5ee2b55ebd028caa	i'm with you...|`|a1b6b5962587dcb80b0e16d346f15ac8aa	You should always use protection if you don't want to get STDs or have an unplanned pregnancy.  Even if you have known the person for years, unless you are absolutely certain of their fidelity AND have both been tested for STDs, then it would be foolish to not be cautious.   Also, the pregnancy thing is still an issue....|`|571c32787d7fd2c51f8ea0fd14323ca9aa	You should ALWAYS use protection. but if you know the person for a REALLY long time and you really, really know and love that person. then it might be OK.

e8946d0f7e2560a39175a356cdca8a95aa	My daughter had the same problem.  She tried everything in the book, including ProActive and God knows what else and nothing seemed to work.  I took her to the family doctor and she put my daughter on a low dose anti-biotic and an antibacterial skin cream.  It was like magic and is typically what a dermatologist would do as a start, anyway.<br>  <br>  My daughter is still very meticulous about washing her face and uses a facial mask every couple of weeks, but the antibiotic really did the deal for her - and her skin was getting really horrid practically as you watched.  Thankfully, I got her in before scarring became an issue.  She has aunts, uncles and Grandparents with bad acne scars, and that is what we were most worried about.<br>  <br>  Talk to your doctor honestly about how it makes you feel.  Make a list of everything that you have tried.  Make a list of what you eat - diet does have some impact.  Does your skin break out more at certain times - like when you are under extra stress?  Keep track of that, too.  Be armed with lists, lists, lists and ask your doctor to PLEASE help you.  They can, and it doesn't have to be such a big deal.|`|9d75194905e7d7103f6887a140f9432caa	Click Here:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.proactiv.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.proactiv.com/</a>|`|8bca7d411d2404b6b913dd04b619913faa	ask ur mom or someone to bring u 2 the spa to get a facial or use a fase mask|`|90e60fec07151b5e72164350572b006aaa	Go to a dermatoligist|`|AA11563131	go to a health food store...pick up a bottle of acidophilous, and clelated zinc...take acidopious 2pills a day, and zinc one...it helps trust me|`|d13fcba4adf1d04f6adf5a7b255e9910aa	as chessy as it may sound...try proactive. for a while i started breaking out like crazy, which wasnt normal for me...and i'm 24. so i decided after tryin all sorts of over the counter stuff, to try proactive. it only took about 3 weeks for my complextion to be almost perfect. i'm a busy person and dont always wash twice a day. i'm sure if you follow it to a T you should see reults pretty soon|`|0850f91b4fb0bcd6c482f03258521f71aa	drinks lots of water. you can also try toothpaste. i never tried it but i heard it works.|`|439b0fc2e214e7693a6621942445a960aa	I USE A RAW  EGG TWICE OR ONCE A WEEK I LIKE NOXEMA IT WORKS FOR ME BUT TRY TO FIND A BETTER DOCTOR|`|9620e9f16298b660f5e68dc5c7536b00aa	You might just be prone to acne.  Cetaphil is a really mild soap great for sensitve skin.  I have sensitive skin and rosacea, so I need a really mild soap.  Also, find a moisturizer that doesn't make your skin greasy and use it after every washing.  If you don't put on your skin might be making extra oil to compensate.  If your skin is breaking out because of excess oil, have you tried those oil absorbing sheets?  I'm not sure which skin care line caries them (neutrogena or something you could get at Wal-Mart.)  Do you break out in certain areas?  I still break out on my chin and jaw line (I'm 27) because I touch it with my fingertips a lot, it's a nervous habit.  My forehead used to break out a lot because the oil in my bangs was rubbing onto it.  Exfoliating regularly might help too, neutrogena is a good brand for sensitive skin and it has an exfoliating wash.<br>  <br>  Basically, keep washing 2 times a day, exfoliating and moisturizing regularly.  Try to keep the oil off your skin during the day and don't touch break out prone areas.  There isn't much else I can tell you, except that it might get better as you get older, hang in there.|`|AA11192114	ask your doctor what you can used for blackheads and pimple

EccBqsntaa	Aw..Good for your Erica! <br>  <br>  I'm personally not a vegetarian. My mom's friend's kids are vegetarians. The oldest who is graduating from high school this year, she gradually became a vegetarian. It was a slow process. Like, first she cut out ham, then beef, then turkey etc...I'm not sure if she did it in that particular order. But she said it was a gradual process. <br>  <br>  My mom puts fish on her salad sometimes. Morning Star has terrific meat substitutions. But since you think it tastes gross, you probably wouldn't want to eat it.<br>  <br>  My mom works at a school and takes her lunch break when she can. So sometimes she doesn't get a lunch break(she eats in the class), she eats at home. And as far as I know, the lettuce doesn't not wilt. If you buy an icepack, you can put it next to your salad container. <br>  <br>  If you live near a Safeway(I'm not sure about other stores since the nearest grocery store to me is Safeway), they sell salad toppers. Which are basically things to put on top. Its called Fresh Gourmet. I know for sure that they sell tortilla strips and some kind of onions. And if you do live near a Safeway, they're almost always on sale. <br>  <br>  A lot of the time, my mom puts cheese on her salad. It tastes pretty good too. It smells even better.<br>  <br>  <br>  Email me for more!|`|rjVALevtaa	Eat a lot of dairy products. One of the problems people have with the vegetarian diet is that it doesn't include enough protein. Eat a lot of dairy, beans, and different types of nuts and you should be alright.<br>  <br>  I know this sounds like little kid food but you could always make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Does your school sell burritos? You could eat a bean and cheese burrito for lunch. Although you'll need to double check the ingredients because some beans have pork fat in them. Or Pizza without any meat toppings. <br>  <br>  Hope this helped!|`|iHjt2nWyaa	I have a sister named Erika, who is a vegetarian. You could have tofu and fruit on your salads, peanut butter (sandwiches, on different foods), macaroni and cheese (my favorite vegetarian dish =) ), pizza with vegetables or just cheese, stir-fries, etc. There's plenty of vegetarian dishes out there.|`|drI1vsJdaa	Good for you! I'm vegan, and you can bring<br>  -Crackers and peanut butter (or cheese)<br>  -Some dish with tofu in it<br>  <br>  You can put ANYTHING you like on a salad :) <br>  Like<br>  tomatoes, onions, croutons, mushrooms, carrots, cheese<br>  <br>  Peanut butter will start being your best friend! So will tofu|`|mHN4EZ1Daa	Yeah, I'm a vegetarian. Just tell your parents you don't want to eat meat and ask your mom to get some vegetarian options. if you want to bring a therm as to school, their is vegetarian vegetable soups and panera has like black bean and creamy tomato soup which are all vegetarian. Umm for salad, i like to put cur-tons and carrots and fruit on it. You can make subs like the veggie subs at subway and potatoes, baked or mashed. You'd be surprised by how many things their are to eat even with out meat. Also i forgot their is peanut butter, which is great for sandwich's like a classic pp&j or for crackers and apples.|`|CdJtH0xdaa	I'm sure that at grocery stores you can buy some prepared vegetarian dishes. My sister was a vegetarian for about three years, and she bought vegetarian Thai dumplings that she found in the grocery store. If you find vegetarian pre-prepared dishes, you will be able to bring those to school. As far as being a vegetarian, you just have to tell your parents that you want to be a vegetarian. They might question you as to why, and you should just tell them that you don't like the taste of meat. I'm sure your parents would be willing to make some vegetarian dishes for you.|`|Ti9tKWigaa	Don't eat meat. Tofu is a vegitarian substitute.|`|EQhSJQEraa	OMG... Hi! Welcome to the club! I am also a vegetarian! I am Indian, so 90 percent of them don't eat meat. Do you live in California? There is this store called Trader Joe's, where EVERYTHING is vegetarian and organic, so no extra junk is going into your body. I think there are other states that have them though. There are ready made meals that you just put in the microwave or onto the stove and it's done in 10 minutes! For lunch, a salad would be a good idea, and depending on what you put it in, the lettuce most likely will not wilt. At Trader Joe's, they have a Ceaser salad dressing that is organic, so no anchovies. Put that on there, or I suggest gtting those ready made pizzas to pop in the oven the night before. Take cookies, juice. Meat is not the only way to go,and once you explore, there are many other vegetarian foods. Ask for some money from your mom, and go on to buy what YOU want. I agree, meat does not smell very appetizing, but I have had to live with it since I was born. Good luck with your choice, and I hope it works out!|`|kRaVa0Wraa	-nutella<br>  -any nut butter, not just peanut butter.<br>  -veggies and fruits of course!!<br>  -tofu or tempeh<br>  -crackers with cheese

They retail i think for $90 at babies r us. i opted for the side by side because it folds down more compact and when I put it in my trunk I can actually put other things in their as well. It does not have any under storage or canopies, but I don't really feel it is necessary. It moves very good the only issue is trying to fit though door ways with ease. I love mine and it works great for my needs with my 5 month old and 16 month old. I had a tandem stroller with my older kids and by the time I folded it down I had to almost jump on my trunk to get the thing to fit in there! I hated almost everything about it!
wWkfASTNaa	Its a matter of education on how the cycle works. Not all women ovulate at the same time as every other woman and even month to month it can change. It is best to use protection at all times so that you dont have to worry. Also sperm can live in fertile cervical fluid for up to 5 days, so sex before ovulation by even up to a week almost can end in pregnancy. You can only get pregnant with ovulation. Women ovulate once a month. End of story.|`|FUNhlpiqaa	You can only get pregnant during the time of ovulation, but that could be anytime!

Most of the time when answerers say that, it's just as a rule of thumb.  Most of the time we don't know exactly when the asker last ovulated.  <br>  <br>  Women can only get pregnant during ovulation, but due to the fact that sperm can live inside a woman for many days, she can also have a baby from sex before ovulation.|`|S5GP2nlUaa	okay don't listen to dana, becase a woman can get pregnant anytime.

I ended up becoming a Mum by choice when I was 26.<br>  <br>  Financial concerns for you should be at the top of the list.  You don't want to be a social security recipient for the rest of your life do you?  And it is not right to bring a baby into the world until you know you can care for it.  I sure hope the $6000 government grant is not featuring too highly in your list of reasons why to have a child.|`|BfBMRlNNaa	A friend of mine was in a similar situation several years ago. She had an abortion at a very young age and then got pregnant again around 18 and had a beautiful baby boy. Whether or not she is a great mother has never been an issue, she's incredible! But the truth is that she has spent many years struggling to make a home for her family. She ended up being  a single mom ( even though she had been with the father for several years) and being a single mom is challenging at any age. Having a baby may sound like a wonderful thing,( and it is!) but wait and make sure the time is right. Think about whether or not you will be able to give this baby the kind of life you want for it. Can you afford to be a stay at home mom? Can you afford daycare for that matter? Do you and your boyfriend have your own home? Are you planning on going to school? A baby is a long term commitment, make sure you are really ready to make it.|`|wHencbOAaa	listen sweetie.<br>  that is not a god idea. i love baby's i love children i love them. but just wait until her baby gets to be around 2-3 years old OMGOSH!!! they become monsters. your older then me im only 15 but im the oldest of 12 children and i have a 3 year old sister right now. im telling you that's not what you want. <br>  <br>  yes they are cute while they are little.<br>  but then comes the snotty nose, the stinky diapers. omg! its horrible. lol. even though they are cute :) <br>  <br>  i have a suggestion..... why don't you just get a job at a daycare i have fun doing that. then you don't have that much to worry about. children are wonderful, but at 18 i promise that's not what you want. boyfriend serious relationship or not.<br>  <br>  i wish that you just wait. just babysit for now :)<br>  and you don't want to become a statistic.<br>  i wish you the best whatever you decide :)

yUypd7gWaa	hi hun, <br>  <br>  sonunds a little odd, the cramping could be a sign of your period coming or a sign of pregnancy. <br>  if it was your first time being sexually active sometimes it can put your period back a little bit. did you do your preg test 12 days after you were sexually active if not maybe do another one just to be on the safe side, and go to ur usual GP they will give you many options and advice on sex..<br>  good luck|`|7amGyOw9aa	Even if you are, it's probably too early for the test to show any results.<br>    <br>  I'd wait a few days and test again.  <br>  <br>  Good luck either way!|`|K1lRZmxXaa	go get a test from your doctor
o1yy6KABaa	A faint positive is still a positive - the main thing you need to take into consideration tho is that it isnt a evaptoration line which is where the test has been left longer thatn the recommended time, or if the test was faulty this can also happen (but rarely) <br>  I would suggest if u r uncertain to try a different brand test first thing tomorrow morning.<br>  Fingers crossed this is your BFP!!!|`|aWkp6AJOaa	yup your pregnant.  <br>  congrats!|`|hhocL3aWaa	If there is a faint line, and it had appeared within the allotted time that the box indicated, then yes you are pregnant.  Congrats!!!!!!  My test had shown up the same way.  Give it about 3 days, and take another test.  At that point the line should be darker.  I think my first test had been 8 days after my missed period, and it was light.  Now I am 25 weeks pregnant.  So, you should set a doc app in a few days.|`|LTD0qL6Yaa	A line in the result window no matter how faint is a positive. You are pregnant "CONGRATULATIONS".

Time to go to the doctor and get a beta blood test to make certain, and schedule your first prenatal exam.  Congrats!|`|xBsYePnqaa	Id say your pregnant! Congrats!

The test I took actually said ' pregnant' or 'not pregnant', I wasn't up for any guessing....
cIn8BkYHaa	I would disregard the results of that specific test because it was after 10 mins and isn't a full line. Even the faint ones I got with clear blue were still full lines, I would take another test or even try a different brand. no worries.|`|1z3C0R2Vaa	Look like a positive to me.

If there is a up and down line lol even if it really faint it means positive.|`|044WNiRtaa	When I took my test it also had a faint line.  I called the doctor right away and they said this just means that it's very early in the pregnancy.  A line is a line.  You're probably pregnant but don't rely on my diagnosis, see a doctor right away and get this pregnancy started!|`|AA11764194	Hardly can see it<br>  <br>  better take another test|`|c65526ea03a8624f0b023c9a6db67ec0aa	Looks questionable to me, but if you had 2 positives before this one then you are pregnant!

There might be something more serious going on.|`|5prmKXELaa	=)|`|lG1j8t2Aaa	I suggest that you go back to your obgyn and have a blood test to make sure.

I pulled myself forward on this bar and it made my body push on it's own and it was really helpful.|`|AA11085356	I had an epidural when I had my son, and thank god! Before they gave it to me, I could hardly stand when I would have a contraction, but afterwards, I was able to lay down and get a couple hours of sleep. I didn't have hardly any pain with the contractions. Not too much when I started pushing, more pressure than anything. But I was still able to feel him moving the whole way out. I think the only time I felt any real pain was after he crowned, he got stuck inbetween contractions. But after that, he was out and the pain was gone. They left the catheter in until I was able to walk. I didn't get up for a couple hours after he was born. And when I did, I needed help. But once I started moving around, it wore off pretty quick. I don't think it made going to the bathroom any different. You'll be pretty swollen and sore from the baby still. I am happy I had the epidural, and plan to have it again in the future.<br>  <br>  Congrats and good luck to you!|`|MqFeJiukaa	I have had 5 children vaginally and 2 of them were born with epidurals (my 3rd and 4th).  With my 3rd child pushing the baby out was severe pressure and no pain.  With my 4th child I had epidural where you push the button to get more medicine.  I didn't feel a thing and had a lot of trouble pushing.  I was beyond numb.  <br>  With both children my catheter was removed prob about an hr later.  With my 4th I had my placenta detach from the cord and was stuck to my uterus so I was glad to be so numb at that point because my ob couldn't get my placenta to detach.  When it wears off I never really felt anything just a little like jello when they made me walk.|`|fJ9gJ1ttaa	I had a good experience with the epidural......i didn't feel a thing.  I was able to get out of bed immediately afterward, but i was a little shaky.

I had no discomfort after giving birth.|`|jolUL8vBaa	I had an epidural after being in labour for 7 hours with my son. The docs turned the drugs off about an hour before i was meant to start pushing so i could actually feel the contractions and know when to push. they did put a catheter in for me but that was taken out as soon as i could get up (15 mins after birth). <br>  As for giving birth and the pain with epidural - I didn't feel much at all even with the drugs turned down. It takes about an hour to wear off before you can get up and around.<br>  Sorry i am all over the place but just writing things as they come into my head.
faa49a1082ae030ed5d0898cedf76862aa	I had a tubal reversal in Nov. 05 and I would advise ANYONE to Dr. Berger in N. Carolina he was THE GREATEST thing that has happen! That is ALL he does!

I would like to get my tubal reversal, but I'm not sure how successful it would be. And Chapel Hill isn't that far from where I am. Any info would be great. As for the original question, I too have been looking online for someone to untie my tubes. I did read that sometimes "cheaper" doesn't mean better service.

It's worth it to save your money and get the best medical care possible.<br>  <br>  Most likely a tubal reversal will cost less than invitro, which is your other option to becoming pregnant.  Call around to OB's in your area and see what a typical charge is for a tubal reversal.  See if your insurance will cover any of it.  And then, start putting money aside every month for it.  May 2007 is enough away that you could probably get a good amount saved up.|`|8c9a18ab54458aacb5654333ef3fe545aa	Get your Tubal Ligation treatment in India .IVF treatment, IUI, ICSI and Laparoscopic surgery is very cheap in India. There is one company that is very famous in India that arranges all types of medical treatment and surgery for foreigners in India. They are called the Forerunners Healthcare. I read a lot about them in the Newspapers and about their patient stories. I have also read that they arrange financing for American and Canadian patients, as some of the surgery including ivf treatment is not covered by insurance.<br>  <br>  They also have photos pasted of their International patients. You can checkout their website. The cost savings are incredible. As a doctor I personally believe that your treatment and surgery can be easily handled in India, as the quality of healthcare available here is simply best in the world. The doctors are USA/UK trained and facilities are 5 star. I recently also read about a Chinese couple facilitated by forerunners healthcare were able to get their baby by IVF and a surrogate mother.<br>  <br>  My cousin and her husband got their IVF treatment in India through the forerunners healthcare in India and is all praise for this company. She is a known case of PCOS.She is a very happy mother of a baby boy now. She just paid 2500 pounds for the full treatment for which she was quoted 8000 pounds in private setup in UK.I strongly recommend this company to you as they can be of great help to you. Hope this helps.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.forerunnershealthcare.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.forerunnershealthcare.com</a>
1z3C0R2Vaa	Yes so do the blood test>>>>
3kW6i3Vdaa	It's called dry humping, and alot of people do it.<br>  <br>  There is ALOT of contraception out there, maybe shop around. IUD is great, it's one operation and it lasts for 5 yearrs.<br>  The Pill is great if you are organised and theres always condoms which are great for heat of the moment.<br>  Remember having sex is your decision, don't let anyone push you into it.<br>  Only when you're ready...|`|6fjrcdYjaa	You definitely won't get pregnant by doing this... good idea. BUT, you should find your local Planned Parenthood or Family Planning place. They will give you free birth control (pills, condoms, etc.) without anyone knowing... Being on birth control is the safest thing to do! <br>  <br>  May I suggest, too... REALLY think about it before you do it. You're very young... yes, 15 is VERY YOUNG to be having sex. Be careful...
LDiBjNf5aa	You're right to mention that it's early to be feeling symptoms - especially as many as you're pointing out. Your stomach will NOT have swelled at this point, by any stretch of the imagination. It's amazing what the mind can do when you start worrying/hoping. If you had unprotected sex a week and a half ago, chances are you only implanted three days ago. You would not be feeling these symptoms.<br>  <br>  Relax. Breathe. Distract yourself. And take a test if your period doesn't come.|`|AA11764194	Too early to confirm but you got all the preg symptoms<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|1r05fktRaa	see a dr|`|LTD0qL6Yaa	You have some of the symptoms i had before confirming that i was pregnant.

Good luck..|`|8iK5rmizaa	When I got pregnant which was my first pregnancy I was trying to get pregnant but I knew within a couple of days that I was pregnant.

PUdWfF0yaa	All I can say is 'this to shall pass'. I'm 12 weeks and I thought I was dying. I still get sick, but a lot less now. The doctor gave me a drug called (Phenergan) if for not that drug, I would have been put in the hospital for the whole first tri-mester. So maybe ask your doctor for it. Good Luck and Congratulations...|`|AA11085356	I kno exactly what you are going through! I was the same way when I was pregnant. The good news is, that you wont be pregnant forever. The bad news is, that there is no way to tell how long, or how extreme your morning sickness will be. I was sick for 6 months! I think I went almost a whole month eating nothing but peanut butter toast and crackers! I couldn't keep anything else down! I don't kno how you feel about taking medications while you're pregnant, but my doctor prescribed me zofran (I think that's what it was called) and that worked wonders! I took it before I got out of bed in the morning, and for the most part, I didn't feel nauseous anymore. There are also some certain foods you can eat to help, I think a friend from work would eat dried apricots to settle her stomach. Maybe, when you have to go to those places you could carry a picture in your pocket or something that could help distract your mind a bit. Like a nice beach somewhere, or a picture of your husband. It could work, I guess... Just try to hang in there, it will be over soon!<br>  <br>  Good luck, and I hope I was able to help!<br>  <br>  Congrats!!|`|1opNXHiLaa	You may be able to alleviate nausea by keeping some<br>  food in your stomach — by avoiding having a stomach that’s completely empty or completely full. Here are some other dietary <br>  <br>  suggestions for preventing or relieving nausea:<br>  <br>  Eat smaller meals or snacks frequently throughout the day.<br>  <br>  Have a small snack at bedtime and when you get up to go to the bathroom at night.<br>  <br>  Avoid foods and smells that trigger nausea.<br>  <br>  Drink fewer fluids with your meals.<br>  <br>  Generally morning sickness is not dangerous.But if you get dehydrated,it may affect your baby.<br>  <br>  Hope it helps|`|FJ8JuFcAaa	My boyfriends sister had really bad morning sickness till like her 3rd trimester.

The chances of you actually being pregnant seem very slim but to soothe your nerves buy a pregnancy test the day your expected period is suppose to come, that alone might help you alot!<br>  <br>  ps: dont let these people make you feel "small" or bad about yourself, you asked an honest question and they left dumb answers. screw em!|`|35e7dfb2f7131768216a3d6dd973f543aa	There is a thing called pre-semen that secretes from the tip of the penis. Similar to the lubrication in the vagina when a female is excited. Bottom line, that's all it takes to get pregnant. No ejaculation needed, hypothetically speaking. Anything can happen!|`|WMPqVYe1aa	very unlikely, if he did not penetrate or ejaculate.

She is a teenager and there is nothing you can do about that... she'll hate you for a few years now then start to realize you weren't such an asshole...|`|AA12023355	Huh? How can't she accept her own answers? If you spoke English it might help! Be patient, listen to her don't turn it into a shouting match, each have your say and listen to the others point of view. If you mean things like she has to be home a certain time, just explain to her you want her to be safe, don't just say you have to be home by such a time because I say so. If it's places she wants to go which you don't think are suitable for 12 year olds tell her you accept she is growing up, but you still don't think such a place is suitable for her to go until she is older.  Whatever it is just explain the reasons why, tell her you care about her and  don't want her to  be in situations a 12 year old can't handle.  When she talks, really listen to her, be open and honest with her whatever the situation, talk calmly don't shout, communication is the key.  If you listen to her, she will listen to you. Suggest alternatives like a sleepover, then you will know she is safe, and she and her friends can have fun. If it's about wanting things she can't have, explain to her why she can't have them. If it's about school ,make sure she is happy there, and isn't being bullied.  Somtimes children get argumentative when they don't know how to express themselves, help her work on that.|`|5ea33677ec2c1cd85812cc24722f216daa	Haha.  I'm sorry.  Poor sucker.  Be prepared for her to yell, scream, slam doors, hate you, cry, be totally confused, make no sense, hate talking to you, want a great deal of more privacy, want freedom, rebel, scream, holler, cry, eat you out of the house, and be over dramatic, ungrateful, and just know when she gets what she wants a second later she'll want something else.|`|AA11563131	welcome to parenting a teenager! lol u'll expierience lotsa situations like that....it'll pass....i get in lotsa arguments wit my parents...not bug ones just lil tussles here and there....be prepared for that too|`|AA12382734	dont do it its hard enough for us with the lives we live when you're not there that she doesnt tell u about and never will tell u about. sometimes we get the two worlds we live in mixed up. just give it a few months she'll grow out of it|`|eb5cf516d63afb0380cdd0e2a9526d28aa	just let her know that your there for her.

AA11786491	haha i asked are there any other games called MaSH (cause i wasn't allowed to use all caps in my question lol) but you can just call if mash or MASH...<br>  This is how u play but first of all it stands for MANSION APARTMENT SHACK HOUSE <br>  MASH is a really fun game u can play with ur friends or by yourself if u DONT cheat.<br>  there are a lot of versions of mash, but this is how i play:<br>  <br>  1. you get a piece of paper<br>  2. at the top write MASH<br>  3. make columns and for the headings write boy (this will be ur husband) or if u r a boy write girl casue that will be ur wife but im pretty sure u r a girl and i am a girl too so we write boy. <br>  4. the other categories are types of cars, the cars color, # of kids, your job, and where u live but with my friends we add stuff like hobbies, pets, color of house, and instead of color of car we do color of wedding dress (or tux if ur a boy) which is more fun i think...you can also add more categories to make it more fun<br>  5. under each category put 5 choices, i usually put 4 good choices and my friend will put a bad one or i put 3 good ones and they put 2 bad ones.<br>  6. then u pick a number<br>  7. this part is kinda hard to explain but say u picked the number 7, then you start where it says MASH at the top and you go seven spaces, and u will land on a boys' name so then u cross that name out  you keep doing that until u only have one choice left for EACH category, and that will be ur future life lol<br>  here is a website and then you will get it!<br>  <a href="http://www.playmash.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.playmash.com/</a><br>  GOOD LUCK THIS GAME IS REALLY FUN!|`|1d582e6733cc96d8a893d3f28d49ce56aa	like the game? If thats what ur talking about then.. Mash stands for mansion.. apartment... shack.. and house. hehe. And then u like put cars, boys, pets, ect.. and u list 4 items/people in each category. and then ur partner makes lines till u say stop then u count the lines up and start at the top of the list, and hop to each other category till u stop at the number of lines u had then cross that person/item out. and start at the one u crossed off.. and count again in order. I hope this is what ur talking about.|`|d26ef466ea75fe7bea0c74a95679d04eaa	Mash stands for mansion apartment shack and house. MASH is a game when u make categories like husband or wife (for boy or girl) and their job and your job and wat country u live in. it's like a make up ur dream life but just using a pencil and paper. and u put really weird ppl that u hate or u like and really weird jobs like stripper or a model (if u don't wanna be 1) and u put jobs u would like to have. it's really fun!|`|fe73cda8b1bff17683256bba76c4b7e7aa	1.

Give him a couple of cigarette burns, he'll stop.|`|d57e29c219b565c305798b1e32e4886faa	I was 10 years old when I started smoking, I liked the smell of tobacco.  I smoked for 20 years, finally quitting when I found out I was pregnant for my daughter in 1985.  Not even watching my father die from smoking induced lung cancer made me quit.  My mother suffers from emphysema and is on oxygen 24/7, I have what is called "minimal" lung capacity due to my smoking and am in the "developing" stages of emphysema myself due to the fact that I have had asthma most of my life and yes I smoked...Luckily I have raised my daughter to be a non-smoker, yes she did try once but because of her asthma became so ill she spent two days over a toilet bowl throwing up...that convinced her that smoking wasn't what she wanted to do.  These days with cigarettes $5.00 a pack I don't understand why anyone would want to start either.  It's a very expensive habit and a very expensive death as well, and now life insurance companies are not wanting to cover the costs of death from smoking so it can only become even MORE expensive.  Maybe your son plans on being independently wealthy as he gets older?|`|2fa11e33c80b5b5b4a8f7f651d61a47faa	do you want to stop your son from smoking?well i know a way,and ill guaranteer he wont anymore.get yourself a horse hair and put it in a cigarette and give it to him,and he will throw up his toenails,it wont kill him,but he wont want anymore,but its up to you,but thats a sure way of curing him.|`|406a9c9ebdde8a4a859745e60bf910d2aa	I smoke to relieve some stress and because I need my nicotine fix.|`|AA11563131	slap him....stupid boy|`|AA11732715	I started smoking in my teen age years, and really really regret it now. <br>  <br>  I started because of peer pressure, trying to fit it, and other stupid reasons.<br>  <br>  Encourage him to stop, as it is such a bad habit, and nearly impossible to quit after you have been smoking for several years. <br>  <br>  My best advice is to continue to talk to him in a loving, caring way, and hopefully he will end up making the right decision.|`|f06f3a5f9d88b87da55ea3dc49ad0061aa	the more you fight it the more he'll do it....just because you don't want him too.|`|af21939e4c52df6ae4d73852b68fce5aaa	I started when I was a teenager because I was rebelling.  It made me feel grown up and like I was a bad***.  My husband started for the same kind of reasons when he was a teenager.  He said that he always told himself that he would quit when he started to become addicted.  He didn't realize how flawed that statement was until it was too late.  At 28 I've finally managed to quit and my husband is 33 and still struggling to quit.  If only we had been smart enough not to start.  I wish you the best of luck with your son.

The Dept of Family and Children's services should be standing up with you in court. My situation was a little different. Children's father molested them and was violent with me and the kids. Children's services stood by me through it all and the women's shelter had connections with a lawyer that handled my divorce pro bono(free). It states in the custody part of the divorce that he is not allowed to see the children without a third party present, which he never would agree to, so he doesn't see them. It is hard for the kids to not have a father, but better to not have one than one like they had. I don't know how old your children are, but that will determine how much they miss him. My kids that were four and up were old enough to understand what happened and they personally don't miss him at all. The one that was an infant doesn't remember his dad or the violence, thank God. The one that was 2 and 1/2 says that she misses her dad( she is 13 now ), but she really doesn't miss him she just misses the concept of having a dad. <br>  Definitely get some counseling for them and yourself. Try to have male influences in your childrens lives that they can look up to and respect, like a grandpa, uncle, older cousin, etc. Try not to bash the dad in front of the kids. Let them know that what he did is in no way their fault, that people make choices, sometimes very bad ones, that dad made some bad choices and he has to live with those choices. I wish you and your children the best. God bless you!|`|34170241bf7c04eb47344e4e483690b9aa	Your the Mother of this child and it's YOUR job to keep this child PROTECTED from people trying to KILL them or injure them in anyway.

You had your period and once that happens you are not pregnant you would have skipped it completely if you were.  I know its not your usual but maybe not being on the pill changed your cycle.  Haven't you seen the commercials for some of them.  They say that it lessens your periods and stops the heavy flow.  I wouldn't worry about being pregnant yet.  Cause your probably not.

BUCcd2aBaa	You can tell them whenever you feel comfortable. Ususally people wait until after the third month, incase of miscarrage.

Si tienes una menstruación demasiado escasa, solo un par de dias en cantidad similar a la de los últimos dias de una menstrución normal puede ser el sangrado que ocurre ocasionalmente cuando un óvulo fecundado se implanta en el útero, es una de las razones por las cuales a veces las cuentas de edad gestacional no coinciden, ante un sangrado de este tipo debes descartar un embarazo si has tenido relaciones sexuales. Si las variaciones se salen del rango normal debes consultar a un ginecólogo por cambios hormonales que pueden ser indicio de enfermedad... no es tu caso.|`|cpk9jgqTaa	Para mi es normal,a mi me pasa lo mismo pero por las dudas consulta con tu gineco.|`|Z6xrzBxCaa	La duracion de la menstruación varía entre 3 a 7 días, lo que te pasa es perfectamente normal, puede disminuir debido a que iniciaste tratamiento anticonceptivo, pero de no ser así es normal, es debido a variaciones en el crecimiento del endometrio (capa de células que se desprende con cada menstruación) que a su vez depende de los factores hormonales.

d7LpdFluaa	finnally, I good question:)  well, I've been in your situation.   my first pregnancy they discoverd I had ges. diab.  and "tried" to induce me at 38 weeks.  it didn't work for me though, I had to do all the stuff you are doing now with sonograms and stuff, and will be doing it again soon, b/c   I have diab. again right now, I'm 27 weeks.  I think your doc probly won't induce before 36 weeks, that would be too early and putting your baby at risk, b/c the lungs aren't fully developed yet,  unless there is a major emergency anyway.  I would expect around 36 to 38 weeks, that's pretty common.  good luck, I hope this helps!|`|GNYdYK2Yaa	C O N G R A T U L A T I O N S <br>  <br>                                  <a href="http://www.pregency.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.pregency.com</a><br>                                  <a href="http://www.childbirth.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.childbirth.com</a>|`|bfBzkuRqaa	Congratulations! <br>  I am diabetic, and have had two children. I controlled the diabetes through diet with the first, and was on insulin with the second. My first was scheduled to be induced on his due date, but came on his own the day before, at 7lbs 5oz. My second came about 3 and 1/2 weeks before his due date, and also weighed 7 lbs, 5 oz.  I also had sonograms weekly, and non-stress tests (where they hook you up to a fetal monitor) frequently, and the drs seemed a little worried about size, but it all worked out fine. I know it's hard, but the best thing you can do is to follow dr's orders, eat right, and try to relax. For the record, my labor and deliveries were really fast (a couple hours with the first, and only 1 hour with the second)...I've always thought that it was just my body knowing when the right time was. Good luck with your baby!|`|i1diSArqaa	My daughter was born vaginally 10 days early, when I was pregnant with her I was told that I was borderline diabetic.  She weighed 9 lb. 12 oz. and I should have had a c-section, but, via sonogram the dr.s were insistant that she was between 7 & 8 lbs..  My son on the other hand was delivered via c-section, 14 days early, they said he was going to be very large ( I was insulin dependent) and he only weighed 7 lb. 4 oz.  Don't put too much thought into the "guesstimated" weight of your baby.  Just be happy and try to be relaxed ( I know... easier said than done!)  Good luck and Best wishes!!|`|0321b0879a95ede6235c499677b58625aa	Well, I'm 36 weeks right now. At 35 weeks, my baby measured at 5lbs 14 oz and I have a c-section scheduled for june 14th, but they would have scheduled my c-section for that date even if I didn't have gestational diabetes. So I guess it really depends on your baby and how you are managing the diabetes.|`|AA11559698	Hey!  I with my son, they also thought he was 'too' big for a while, but he seemed to just have a growth spurt inside of me.  I ended up having to be induced at 41 + weeks, and he was 8 1/2 lbs, 22 inches long.  This time, they are inducing me a week and a 1/2 early.

Did you tell him that you were raped when it happened or did you wait to tell him after you were 27 weeks pregnant? The matter of "when" he was told plays a big factor in whether he should believe you or not.|`|42f738e0a88a38a51293015509890057aa	i think she means she was raoed earlier, and then rumours started and now shes pregnant theres rumours shes cheated? hope thats right.<br>  <br>  these people are shits who have nothing better to do and i understand why this is stressing you out but you need to tell you mister that its you he should listen to not gossip. you need to concentrate on yourself and your baby.....your only pregnant for this time, might sound harsh but you can sort your relationship after if necessary but dont but yours and your babies health at risk.<br>  <br>  i hope everything works out

E' chiaro che dal di fuori è facile parlare, ma dovreste cercare una maggiore intesa e complicità tra donne. Prova a pensare da dove è partita questa incomprensione e cerca di chiarire la situazione con tua madre che, immagino, ti voglia bene come tutte le mamme, ma che ha bisogno di capire cosa ti frulla per la testa e cosa realmente vuoi.<br>  Forse se la rendi più partecipe della tua vita e delle tue scelte troverai un'alleata e non un'avversaria.|`|vZlfRagJaa	Scusa...in ke senso te la ritrovi appallottolata sul letto??forse vuole solo aiutarti a mettere apposto l'armadio...??<br>  nn si capisce bene la domanda...kiss|`|xMrX5O05aa	Parlagliene.

Caspita, è una cosa semplicissima!!!!! Perché la gente non si parla??? <br>  Senti, prendi tua madre e sedevi a parlare. Non so quanti anni hai, ma non interessa, perché per incominciare ad avere un dialogo basta sapere parlare!<br>  Io ho 4 figli e parlo di tutto sia con quella di 17 (adesso è un pò arrabbiata con me ma non importa, passerà!) che con il più piccolo di 7. <br>  Chiedi a tua mamma il perché a lei non piace i tuoi vestiti, dille che a te piace e che i gusti non si discutono, che sei tu quello chi devi indossarli, che sei tu quelli chi spendi i soldi per comprarli (i soldi sono tuoi, vero??) e che tu non stai a criticare i vestiti che lei indossa! Se ha visto che assurdo invece l' ultima sfilata di moda di ... (inventa un stilista) e che quelli si, sono vestiti che non indosseresti mai!<br>  Insomma, parlate. Sono sicura che riuscirete a trovare un accordo!<br>  Auguri!!|`|9a25c913c3ac50392bee7bb189490ee1aa	Se tua madre non vuole che compri vestiti nascondili da qualche parte e dopo quando ti li vuoi mette te li metti.|`|cJgi5rmwaa	Anche la mia faceva uguale mi buttava la roba che a me piaceva di più' xke' sosteneva che erano stracci da spolvero...Parlale e chiedi con calma il motivo di questo comportamento e chiedile x cortesia che sei tu a scegliere cosa indossare purché' sia sempre tutto nella regola....|`|f1JBW7q6aa	devi portare pazienza e parlarle...cmq non mi sembra un comportamento maturo|`|fNONaEAvaa	a me succede il contrario...<br>  io lascio la roba appallottolata sul letto e lei la mette nell armadio<br>  pensa ke vita!|`|jjjbETIuaa	Purtroppo hai impostato la tua domanda maluccio, non ci hai spiegato molto, messa così appare molto strano il comportamento di tua madre, si direbbe che abbia dei problemi psicologici, invece sono certa che non sia così. <br>  Tu cosa fai per scatenare questi comportamenti? Forse sono pantaloni indecenti quelli che lei butta che a te piacciono tanto ma chissà che moda segui! Non sempre i consigli dei genitori sono totalmente sbagliati. Si vedono certe ragazze in giro vestite talmente tanto male che la prima cosa che pensi è "ma sua madre la manda in giro così?" <br>  E l'armadio è in ordine come si dovrebbe? non è che i panni sono appallottolati nei cassetti e viene da piangere solo ad aprirli? beh, devi spiegarci non si capisce molto dal tuo quesito.<br>  Credo che il peggiore consiglio che ti hanno dato gli altri è quello di  parlare a monosillabi, tenere le cuffiette mentre tua madre cerca di comunicarti qualcosa, fingere di ascoltare non è l'atteggiamento giusto. Devi costruire un dialogo. E dimostrare un po di rispetto. Pensa se parlassi con un tuo amico e questi invece di darti ascolto tenesse le cuffiette con la musica e a te non ti cag.. nemmeno! Sarebbe piacevole? Non preferiresti piuttosto che interagisse con te dicendoti perché non condivide il tuo pensiero?<br>  C'è un grande conflitto tra di voi, probabilmente sei nel pieno della tua adolescenza ed è una cosa normalissima, anzi è doveroso che ci sia. Ma bisogna confrontarsi, non chiudersi. Non alzare barriere, abbattile! <br>  Chiedile perché fa così, cerca di capire il suo punto di vista non solo contestarlo. E poi spiega le tue ragioni. <br>  Attento che costurire un rapporto, recuperare un dialogo non è una cosa semplice, potrebbero volerci dei giorni. Non scoraggiarti alla prima litigata.<br>  ciao|`|s9PgkgGZaa	Molte famiglie (la mia) hanno problema inverso ...Noi figlie lasciamo appallottolate sul letto le maglie di nostra madre xDxD!

AA11447697	I'm so sorry for what happened to you. <br>  <br>  I really hate sterilization b/c there is always a big risk of regrets (not to mention unpleasant sideeffects) later and reversal can be difficult. <br>  <br>  I would say you should definitely investigate having the procedure reversed.  <a href="http://ccli.org/nfp/contraception/tubal.php" rel="nofollow">http://ccli.org/nfp/contraception/tubal....</a> (an article on tubal ligation)<br>  <br>  The Couple to Couple League (CCLI.org) may be able to point you in the direction of a good doc for reversal.<br>  <br>  Good luck and my prayers are with you.|`|AA11616741	First of all, I'm sorry for your loss....If you want another baby, have the surgery so that you can do that.|`|2Nl9tfIiaa	Wow!  that is sad! If that has happened to you, I am so sorry. I would have surgery to have another one, not as a replacement tho. You wanted a kid to love and now God had better palns for hin or her so now you can have another one. I hope that this helps. If you decide not to have another one, you might want to see a counselor to help you with your ideal. Talking helps. God Bless.|`|756f2ab0fb4d8df04412be9939df9319aa	Yes sorry for your loss. I would go get the surgery so you can have another baby! That has to be really hard. Personally I don't think anyone should ever get fixed because of the fact that certain things happen. Whether the loss of a child or just changing your mind someday.  Good luck and again sorry for your loss.|`|ca61402689139a586d12bf2b7cdcc48aaa	This has played through my head so many times, i have 2 sons, 2 step sons, and im 25 weeks with another boy. Pregnancy brings on so many worries, After this one i am planning on getting my tubes tied. The other day i was thinking well what if something happens to this baby, SIDS or something that will take him away forever. Could i live with never having another child. I came to peace with this. First off if something were to happen to my child i would be lost, i dont know what i would do, how i would feel, or how i would cope. BUT on the same hand i would feel even worse be having another baby, i would feel like i was trying to replace my son. And i dont want that. I dont like that idea. This is my last child and if something were to happen, it is still my last child. Its hard to face and think about things like this but its reality and its part of life, if god wants to bless me with another son thats wonderful, if he wants to take him from me, At least i know hes with God. He would always be in my heart.|`|fcd7e0ecb920038cde8abd30066b75ceaa	That's such a hard thing.

h0GmrHE1aa	a esa edad los peque?os son muy difíciles;pero mi consejo es que cuando salgas trata de llevar algunos juguetes,cartones ,dulces o algo que a el le guste mucho;los nenes también se aburren y mas en ese clase de lugares,poco a poco ira comprendiendo y aprenderá a comportarse ten le mucha paciencia.suerte|`|c72bfd2342e72028065293ffef755dbbaa	no lo lleves<br>  si no hay de otra, llevalo despues de comer y casi dormido, asi podras comer algo, ademas de no molestar alos demas si se despierta y comienza a llorar, ademas pide una mesa retirada, de ser posible en la terraza.<br>  perdona pero yo creo que ser padres conlleva muchos sacrificios y uno es no llevar al bb donde le vaya a dar berrinches|`|Lr3Tih3eaa	Nunca es demasiado temprano para desarrollar hábitos alimenticios saludables ni buenas maneras en la mesa. Llevar a un ni?o a comer en un restaurante, dejarle probar diferentes platillos y aprender el arte de comer fuera de casa es muy positivo. El truco es estar seguros de que no estamos poniendo a nuestro hijo en una situación irrazonable en la que tus expectativas sobre su comportamiento y reacción a la comida estén muy por encima de sus capacidades. Eso implica hacer una elección estratégica de qué tipo de restaurante es el indicado, a qué hora ir y qué “equipo” llevar. Otras recomendaciones: <br>  <br>  ? Primero que nada, elige un restaurante que sea “amigable” para un ni?o: llama antes de ir y consulta si tienen sillitas altas para la mesa, ?son bien recibidos los ni?os? un restaurante con un buen nivel de ruidos y movimiento es ideal. Las voces de tus hijos no será tan llamativa (en caso de que griten o lloren) y el movimiento puede entretenerlos. Evita los restaurantes que tienen un ambiente muy íntimo, más propio para reuniones de ejecutivos o cenas románticas. <br>  ? Ve antes de que comience la hora pico: así encontrarán una mesa con más facilidad y les servirán la comida más rápido. Si no es un restaurante de comida rápida, entonces pide a la mesera que te lleve una panera con galletas o pan, para que tus hijos se entretengan mientras traen la entrada. <br>  ? Nunca lleves a tu hijo a un restaurante si está hambriento: aunque suene contrario a la razón, un ni?o con hambre es más irritable y no podrá disfrutar la experiencia. Lo más recomendable es que le de des un snack antes de salir que le deje con apetito, pero no con hambre. El snack puede ser una fruta, un yogurt o una porción de gelatina. Evita darle dulces o comida chatarra. <br>  ? Lleva algunos de sus juguetes favoritos: aunque la idea no es que armen una fiesta en el restaurante, algunos objetos familiares y juguetes pueden hacer que la comida sea menos aburrida, sobre todo tomando en cuenta que un ni?o puede mantener su concentración en la mesa unos 30 minutos, después de los cuales sólo tendrá ganas de jugar. <br>  ? Si después de probar distintas estrategias –juguetes, galletas, el snack- tus hijos se resisten a portarse bien en el restaurante, pide la cuenta de inmediato ?y sal de ahí!: Hay que saber escoger las batallas, y esta podría llevarte al fracaso total. Rega?ar a tus hijos para que se porten bien en un ambiente público y lleno de distracciones puede ser frustrante, e incluso podría terminar por agriar la experiencia para futuras salidas. Cuanto más grandes son los ni?os, pondrán más atención e interés en lo que están haciendo, y podrán pasarla bien.|`|0t44Ntkyaa	Querida amiga.......preparate para salir con tu bebe.no te stresses y disfrutalo...lleva sus juguetes favoritos.lleva crayolas.....llevale una galletica divertida, llevale algo por descrubrir.una cajita de colores una muneca desarmable...y por supuesto llevale algo rico de comer de picar......y entiendelo....el quiere descubrir el mundo...quiere estar a tu altura....pero tu eres muy grande......el no entiende de protocolos.....pero tu  eres su mami poco a poco le ensenas a no botar la cuchara y a decir gracias!!!<br>  un abrazo <br>  bye!!|`|DzgMuCfOaa	yo creo que no solo en un restaurant, sino que desde casa hay que ponerle las reglas clarasy ser siempre firme y no te preocuparas por que te haga berrinches fuera de ella.si le prometes un premio pero el ni?o se porto mal, aunque te duela no lo premies porque solo le crearas confusion y creera que estuvo bien lo que hizo. si bien la violencia no es buena, tampoco lo es la debilidad o el dejar que el bebe haga lo que se le de en gana. yo creo que ser firme, darle opciones y libertad pero al mismo tiempo ponerle limites cuando su libertad ya caiga en hacer su santa voluntad. eso si, ayudarle con amor y paciencia.|`|Otdh4dJxaa	y supongo qu todavia le das mamila ? hayy que consentidito lo tienes  deja de mimarlo a todas horas y veras la diferencia  hablale como si ya fuera grande y no como un bebe de dos meses|`|AA10139671	1) Corrector en la nuca<br>  No funciona?<br>  <br>  2)No salgas a comer a restaurantes<br>  No queres dejar de salir?<br>  <br>  3) No salgas con el ni?o<br>  <br>  Sds,

Por ejemplo plátanos, frijoles enteros, brocoli, coliflor, picantes o comidas en extremo condimentadas.<br>  Aunque realmente no se conoce bien el proceso por el cual causan efectación, lo mejor es consumir pocas cantidades, exepto por el picante y las comidas en extremo condimentadas, que definitivamente son da?inas no solo para la madre sinó también para el bebe.<br>  Linnett|`|Y4wTfAI9aa	claro porque lo que tu comes es lo mismo que le das en la leche al bb,procura evitar el picante y las espesias|`|Otdh4dJxaa	asi es! no comas porquerias ya que puedes  enfermar al bb! y sera mejor que te portes bien y no te enojes ya que tu comportamiento tambien podrian  enfermar al bb,,, perdon por asustarte pero todo lo que absorbes de el projimo y las comidas que consumas  pueden afectar al bb,, ya que  si te enojas y alimentas al bb el puede enfermarse,,,,,,esto me lo dijo mi abuelita, ella es decendiente de raza azteca y tiene 108 a?os  y creo que ella tiene mas razon que yo ya que apenas tengo 25 y ella solo me habla en  dialecto!  mejor fijate lo que consumes  y trata de no  enojarte  cuando le das de  comer al bb ok!!|`|ccf79591000e79719aee8a6539f8bbedaa	Hay tres grupos de productos que debes vigilar mientras das pecho:<br>  1) Productos que disminuyen la producción de leche, entre los que se incluyen cafeína, teobromina y nicotina (evitar café, consumo excesivo de té, refrescos de cola, chocolates, y el cigarrillo.<br>  2) Productos que pasan a través de la placenta y pueden da?ar al  bebé: Fundamentalmente bebidas alcohólicas, drogas enervantes, y algunos medicamentos de prescripción administrados a la madre.<br>  3) Productos cuyo consumo puede alterar el sabor de la leche materna, o bien provocar gases en el ni?o.  Entre los primeros están ajo, cebolla, chile y condimentos fuertes.  Entre los segundos productos como el brócoli, la coliflor, en algunos casos los frijoles, la calabacita y el repollo.

Invece con il ragazzo con il quale sto ora è stato bellissimo,in pratica l'esatto opposto, mi sentivo fuori dal mio corpo, ero emozionatissima!!!|`|gvzsYfvLaa	io ancora nn l' ho dato il primo baio ma nn vedo l' ora|`|qBr2jFk2aa	nn è stato affatto importante.. xro' me lo sono baciato 2 volte.. xke veniva da me a rompere e allora me lo baciavo.. ma meglio cosi' ora mi diverto xke mi sn sbloccata..^^ ho il tipo da 1 mese e mezzo.. e lo abbiamo anke fatto.. ke bello.. e stato bellissimo.. kissolo!.|`|xtJesuCFaa	Il mio primo bacio è stato con un mio amico ma è successo più per curiosità che per attrazione.

I guess. lol good luck to you!|`|9hym8kp7aa	I kind of didn't understand what you are asking. But the longer the baby stays inside the healthier.  I know that pregnancy seems to last forever, but think about the baby 1st.  The sooner you have the baby the greater the chances are that something might not yet be developed, like the lungs. I'm sure you want the healthiest baby ever. So relax and watch many movies to take your mind off of the actual event.  I'm sure you know your baby will be cute so don't sweat the small stuff. Think about the bigger picture. The closer the baby comes out at 40 weeks the better. Take care.|`|B4KW4u6laa	huh?
3oCpyPYzaa	Ok so I was just on the same pill.  I stopped taking it 4 weeks ago cold turkey on my last pill of the month and only experienced  about 2 days spotting (after my normal period time).  The light brownish color does not mean anything its just old blood.  Although, 8 days is a long time from just missing 1 pill.  I would try waiting to see what happens with your period seeing how it is only several days away and then try calling the docter|`|SWTgl4tkaa	I have been on tri-cyclen lo for over a year and a half now and I have doubled up a few different times and that has happened to me.  I wouldn't worry to much about it but if you start having symptoms like tender breats, morning sickness...then I would take a pregnency test.  Other than that it's usually because your body is somewhat used to having a peroid when your taking your sugar pill and if you miss a pill that is is an actual hormonal pill then your body thinks its time to start its peroid.  The sugar pill is just to keep you taking something so you don't forget.  So when you forget a real one it's like taking your sugar pill which tells your body its time to start your peroid.  After you double up your body gets twice as many hormones as it does normally and that throws your body into a little whackiness.  Don't worry to much about it, it should regulate in another few days.
c8fc98de00622cd084e87daf1db78c6eaa	Yo trataría de poner prioridades. El colegio es obviamente importante, pero más importante aún es no perder a sus hijos. Por lo tanto, yo como mamá de una hija de 18 diría que lo más importante es que empiece a tener confianza en uno. Su cabeza la tiene el en una dirección y tu como padre en otra. Tienes tu, como persona adulta, tratar de encontrar el camino medio. En el momento que el note que tu estás tratando de irle al encuentro, posiblemente ya no reaccione tan reaciamente. Yo supongo que él debe tener sus propios pensamientos cuando hace las cosas que a ti como adulto no te parecen bien. Sería importante saber cuáles son esos pensamientos. Para eso lo único que queda es hablar con él. Pero no hablar con él para que él te entienda a ti, sino para que tú lo entiendas a él. Y de acuerdo a lo que él diga, tu podrías empezar a remodelar lo que tú esperas para tu hijo. Importante es que no lo pierdas, que no se pierda él en alcohol y/o drogas. Si pierde un a?o escolar no es el fin del mundo, pero si se pierden Uds. como padre e hijo, sí podría serlo.<br>  Cuando le recrimines algo, piensa bien cuál de todas las cosas que te parecen mal en tu hijo son absolutamente importantes de recriminarle. Por ejemplo, no te gusta que fume. No sé si también toma alcohol. En tal caso podrías recriminarle lo del alcohol y dejarle pasar lo del tabaco. Así se reduce algo la fuente de recriminaciones y quizás se vuelva más accesible. Seguramente el siente que no hay nada que esté haciendo bien (lo cual probablemente de veras es así desde el punto de vista de un adulto) y entonces simplemente no interesa, porque haga lo que haga siempre va a estar mal. Alli no hay acceso. Hay que encontrarle los lados buenos, que toda persona tiene y más aún tu hijo, para que lentamente se vaya dando cuenta, que te duelen sus fallas, pero que conoces sus lados buenos, aunque quizás estén escondidos por el momento.<br>  Mi hija, cada vez que da un paso de maduración se pone insoportable y nos empezamos a pelear constantemente hasta que yo me doy cuenta y me digo: "alto"! Seguramente ella ha dado el siguiente paso en su camino a la adultez y yo aún no me he percatado y algo quiere de mí, que ni ella misma sabe. Y justo en ese momento empiezan a mejorar las cosas, porque veo sus reacciones con otros ojos. Ella se percata de ello y se tranquiliza.<br>  <br>  Adicional<br>  He leido tu nota adicional. No lo hagas como tu padre. Esos eran otros tiempos. El pediatra de mi hija, al que ella le tiene mucha confianza, un dia hablo con ella, porque nosotros ya no sabiamos que hacer. Ella tomaba las decisiones por encima de nosotros. El le dijo que eso no era justo porque nos dejaba a nosotros padres maniatados. Que si ella no estaba de acuerdo con las reglas que le imponíamos debería discutirlo y discutirlo y discutirlo con nosotros hasta llegar a posiblemente un nuevo acuerdo. Eso es lo que hacemos la mayor parte del tiempo. A veces hace cosas que a mi me parecen mal y digo cual será el castigo (eso ocurre unas 4 veces al a?o). Luego le pregunto a ella si le parece justo o no el castigo. A veces dice que sí. Otras veces me explica porque no le parece justo y la mayoría de esas veces en el fondo tiene razón ella. Y se lo digo, que pienso que tiene razón ella y que yo no tengo motivo para castigarla.<br>  Es muy importante que tu hijo siga con el colegio. Pero no te desesperes si pierde un a?o. Es un a?o más que lo tienes más cerca a ti.<br>  Lo único que sí me parece preocupante es lo de la moto. Pero eso es posiblemente debido a que yo rechazo las motos.<br>  Has pensado en la posibilidad de tomarte un fin de semana largo e irte unos dias fuera con él? Solamente ustedes dos? Quizás serviría para inicio de una relación menos conflictiva.|`|hgSo6eD3aa	hola espero poder ayudarte! tengo 16 a?os y como por eso de los 14 o15 empeze a ser muy rebelde pero porque a mi me habia arrebatado la vida a mi papa por un tiempo y me empeze a amargar la vida entera, hasta que el esposo de mi hermana hablo conmigo y me explico que no podia andar asi de mal en la vida y me apoyo mcho en ese momento... la clave aqui es no dejarlo POR NADA DEL MUNDO LO DEJES TU APOYO VALE MUCHO Y AUNQUE NO LO PARESCA AVECES ERES SU PADRE Y EL TE AMA MUCHO AUNQUE PARESCA QUE NO..

Castígale duro, eso significa que le quites aquellas cosas que más le gustan, ya sea moto, televisión, consola de videojuegos... Siempre se ha dicho que, para que te hagan caso, lo más importante es delimitar los papeles, y a ti te toca ahora mismo ser muy duro e incomprendido por él. No todo le dará igual; no le dejes salir, demuéstrale que el tabaco es malo y que no debe fumar, que ya no puede ver más a esos amigos suyos...se que te odiará, incluso que te llevará la contraria, pero el poder lo tienes tu y debes controlarlo, no que él te controle a ti.<br>  Que tengas mucha suerte amigo, un saludo.|`|ELEAPqT2aa	pues est aen la busqueda de su identidad no te desesperes mejor ense?ale un poco de buen rock y dale una guitarra para q gaste sus energias y las enfoque en otra cosa para q deje de estarse confundiendo con otras cosas lo de fumar es normal y es por influencias como lo sabras y pues si no pues ponle una surra vas a ver como entiende a fuerza jaja y pues va a querer salirse de su casa a sentirse incomprendido jaja lo otro q puedes hacer jaja es picarle su orgullo jaja si se pone con algun tipo de reclamo tonto como los de cualquier adolecente hazle burla y vas a ver q lo dejara de hacer jaja y va a comprender q lo q hace es de ni?os bueeno espero q te sirva yo acabo de salir de la adolecencia y yo fui de los q se burlaban de tipos como tu hijo jaja porq nunca pase por esa epoca asi q bueno no se tal vez estoy mal pero intentalo no pierdes nada con intentar mas cosas... bueno saludos y suerte!!!|`|JARtXJN9aa	lo que puedes hacer es tratar de compartir con el y di le que estas con el todo momento|`|Jb44mD05aa	Hola Manu P, entiendo que hablas con el y ya no sirve de nada, pero le has preguntado que es lo que él quiere?, por lo general independientemente de la adolescencia que es un momento de rebeldia y de autoconocimiento, los chavos siempre nos quieren decir algo con su actitud, aun cuando no siempre se presente como rebeldia, que no es tu caso, a veces solo quieren demostrar que necesitan algo, o que algo les incomoda, toma en cuenta que esta conociendo el mundo y todo para el es nuevo, fumar por ejemplo a esa edad mas que vicio, (que luego se hace si lo siguen haciendo), es una manera de reafirmar que son parte de un grupo y de sentirse aceptados si es que en su grupo lo hacen. El solo quiere que te des cuenta que esta creciendo y que no lo puedes manejar igual aun cuando no hayas sido un padre sobreprotector, por eso la escuela no le va, no obedece horarios, ni reglas y pareciera que no le importa nada, te esta diciendo ESTOY CRECIENDO Y NO ME PUEDES MANEJAR IGUAL ni siquiera con satigos por que ya no te sirven con él, es muy importante que sepas que piensa y siente, que quiere, que necesita, en el momento que se sienta atendido, su actitud va a cambiar, creemelo, tu sabes mejor que nadie si ademas viene cragando con una historia de vida pesada, eso solo tu lo sabes, y que pueda estar repercutiendo en su actuar en el presente.<br>  Bienvenido a este nuevo medio, Soy Lic en psicologia, tambien soy relativamente nueva en esto y en mis pocos tiempos libres que me da mi profesión me gusta estar por aca, espero te haya servido de algo y felicidades no es facil que un papá soltero se preocupe asi por su hijo.

12hB11Zkaa	If you've already seen the heartbeat then your risk of another miscarriage drops from 20% to around 5% until after 12 weeks. After 12 weeks it drops again to around 1%. If you haven't seen a heartbeat, try to arrange an ultrasound with your doctor. It will help put your mind at ease. Try not to worry, only a couple more weeks to go before you hit the magic 12 week stage. Best of luck!|`|wcVY7iOXaa	I had 3 miscarriages, one at 8 weeks and 2 very early on ealier than 2 weeks, and now i am 11 weeks pregnant again and i made sure i got prenatal care early so they can catch anything and i am on some meds for a thyroid disorder that might have caused my misscairages so get early care. My doc told me 13 weeks is when the rick of miscarriage decreases. Also i had an ultrasound at 9 weeks and seen the heartbeat and everything and my doc said thats good that they seen the heartbeat and chances of miscarriage are lower when heartbeat is seen early. well i hope it helps alittle.|`|33275086185ca6d9894364b1f99c435faa	If you have only had one previous miscarriage you are really not at any greater risk for miscarriage this time around. Basically, the risk for miscarriage drops significantly after the first trimester (After 13 weeks). <br>  <br>  On a personal note , however, as a person who has had a miscarriage and a previous healthy pregnancy... Once you have a miscarriage you are more likely to worry the next time around. I am sorry for your loss, and know that it is a difficult thing to get past, but remember more than 50% of women have a miscarriage at some point in their lives... The lucky ones of course are the ones who didn't know they were pregnant to begin with and just have a worse than average period...<br>  <br>  Good luck on your pregnancy, and make sure you keep up with your prenatal care as in any healthy pregnancy. If you have concerns or just are worried about something talk to your doctor... they are very good at reassuring you and giving helpful advice!|`|EgZz6EK9aa	after 3 months you really don't have to worry.  but right now if your 10 weeks i wouldn't worry.  if you were high risk your dr would tell you.|`|GqQL3zFbaa	urm it depends my auntie had 3 mis carriages but maybe she was just unfortunate it real does just depend. all the best.|`|s7ez4vdmaa	hey Hun, I'm sorry you've had a previous miscarriage. Ive had 3 myself. for some people its a one off thing and its been found more than half of women have a miscarriage somewhere in their lifetimes. <br>  the "worry" zone is usually known to be up to 12 weeks but don't stress out either as an increase in stress can also increase miscarriage as with stress your blood pressure rises. so take it easy until you get your first/next scan and enjoy being pregnant... good luck x
2674548b6a4c9cdbb098044c58c7af7aaa	Nope.|`|59ddb8311c6b15678bb27a9163746913aa	it really deppends how big ur bump is if urcarryin more than one baby then i gues it would be really uncomfortable but its does not hurt the baby at all it is actuallly suppose 2 help u thro ur pregnancy|`|2E7wovNNaa	Hurtful, no.  Awkward...YES!!!|`|49b98532f1c2a607d94d38f43a315f96aa	No, and perfectly great to do unless doctor says otherwise.  It felt fine until I got a big stomach.   It's alot more uncomfortable for me now though.  <br>  <br>  30 weeks pregnant and counting with baby girl.|`|a1e6f82bd0a12f1b12568f5c0e0d67afaa	Not for me. I'm 7 weeks and it feels just as it did before. Though one of my friends tells me the further along in the pregnancy she was the better sex felt. She thinks it was because of how high her uterus was but she isn't sure why.|`|vm8HtVUYaa	Not if it's a normal pregnancy (not high-risk) ..you can make love (with no pain) up until delivery.<br>  good luck! God bless!|`|0apKZq7vaa	Hi there, It is not harmful to have intercourse when you are pregnant. The only way that it is harmful is if your water has broke or the doctor has instructed you not too. Intercourse has been known to induce labour if you are at full term doctors may even recommend this. Good luck throughout your pregnancy, remember though if you are not comfortable to have intercourse do not allow your spouse to force you, you are boss! Take care!|`|0e957c25711b2fbb9dd66cf45f459142aa	No. Some doctors will even say that sex during the thrid trimester is perfectly healthy and it helps bring the baby faster|`|850fdf3f64e09f099131a2dba9f1a019aa	IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE GOOD FOR THE PREGNANCY WHY ARE YOU PREGNANT?|`|90c1daa3c1312832dca1683adc9a5d69aa	Ofcourse not i actualy enjoy it even more now that im pregnat.|`|9a902c0bbc8910a7c7afbb6f2df1e77baa	I wouldn't think so. The only thing that I can think of is that it might be uncomfortable for the woman because of the extra weight she is carrying. But that can be remedied with different positions.|`|ORtcfvrhaa	As long as he's not resting and putting pressure on your belly you're fine. Have fun! But do be carefel about being on your back for too long, not only because of the blood flow but your back will HURT when you try to get up.<br>  <br>  It also works great if you lie on your side with him still up like in missionary.<br>  <br>  Hands and knees are fun too! (but wear a bra or your bobs will flap around and hurt!)<br>  <br>  Have fun, i had more fun having sex while pregnant than while trying to get pregnant!|`|X9Lipvmraa	No indeed.  You will certainly have to adjust your positions especially later on.  Missionary position gets a bit difficult, as you might imagine and you might not feel up to anything on the energetic side.<br>  <br>  No reason it should be uncomfortable and it won't hurt the baby.|`|bwkVKbeLaa	no, the only time it was uncomfortable (this was just my experience) was when i was 8-9 months pregnant and it was just to hard to do it in any other position besides on your hands and knees.|`|RvoGf8G1aa	absolutely not, when you are making love while pregant you are rocking your womb and that is all the baby will feel. this can be very soothing to the unborn child.|`|XTBMDV9Haa	Not at all. As long as everything is normal its perfectly ok. You will want to be aware of how you feel and contact your dr. if you experience pain or bleeding afterwards. <br>  Other than that, it can be uncomfortable with some of the pregnancy symptoms and as you get bigger. But its perfectly safe unless you have had pain or bleeding.|`|rounVaoLaa	Depends on if it is the guy who got you preg or his buddy!
FnjMXIZRaa	I know exactly how you feel.  Me and my baby's dad split up when I was only like 13 weeks along.  Pregnancy was so hard to go through alone, especially since I had a really complicated pregnancy and it was scary.  And it is especially hard at those later stages, when you know the birth is near, it seemed like I just started getting really sad around the same time as you are.<br>  It's hard to do alone, but sometimes it is for the best.  Find someone who makes you feel better, whether it's family, a friend, whoever, and try to have them around as much as possible to lift your spirits.  My aunt gave me a neat book that was for new mothers to fill out for their children to read, with all kinds of question about their life story....that was really neat, I wrote in it to fill some of the lonely times.  And let yourself cry when you need to.  It's okay to be sad when you're facing everything alone, just don't get TOO wrapped up in your sadness and overlook the good things that will come with your new baby.  But definitely have a good cry when you feel you need one, it helps to get it out.<br>  I would like to say it stops completely at some point, but it doesn't.  However, it does get better somewhat.  After I had my daughter, I had a couple of really sad moments where I thought about how it would have been to have had a father there for my baby....and every once in a while when I'm up all night with her, or when she does something new or cute, I get choked up thinking how nice it would be to have someone sharing it with me, both the good and bad times.  But I definitely feel much better than I did while still pregnant.<br>  Someone told me to feel proud of everything I did on my own two feet, without help.  That helped when I got down during pregnancy and since I have had her....I take a lot of pride, and I look at her and think how good I feel that I didn't abandon her, even if he did, and I am proud of myself and every difficult thing I have been through as a single mom.<br>  If you need to talk, feel free to contact me....Good luck to you!|`|887b882f1a5f4502bae049466173bb62aa	I'm so sorry you are going through this right now. Yes eventually it will get easier. It may get worse before it gets better, and may never completely go away anytime soon. Good thing is everyday will get a lil easier. Try not to stress to much because you have your lil one to worry about.  I wish you and your baby the best of luck!|`|aadbc672ff509652b97f6931f5913dbaaa	You have just been through a break up, an emotional time in itself, but carrying you ex's baby makes it even more difficult. As a mum you are about to learn just how strong you can be. Time heals, but for now if you need to cry do it. Surround you self with supportive friends and family that are not judgemental. You can get through this and you will.|`|WfJYH05aaa	This is normal.  Ask yourself why you split up with the babys' father.  If he is an abusive asshole, I would say good for you.  If you just don't feel compatible with him, then I would say you are being selfish.  The baby needs a stable home.  To many children are growing up without a father or mother in their households.  Remember, there is no perfect person out there for you.  Everyone has faults.  The longer you stay with someone, the more faults you will see.  The key is to learn to live with a persons faults, as they learn to live with yours.  You will never change someone, you will never shape someone into the perfect mate.  As you grow, and they grow, you will learn to live together and form an unbreakable bond of trust and reliance.<br>   I do not know your situation.  You may have a good reason for not being with the father, but i ask you to think of that child and of the reprocussions on him/her if he must jump between mom and dad.  There is no stability in that, and it makes it very had for a child to adjust without both parents in the same house.|`|c1e995b9ce8779e6e777816b269f7246aa	Of course you are feeling sad right now and you are probably going to continue to cry because it hurts and right now your hormones are at a high level, but as soon as that precious baby is born you are gonna literally be on cloud nine.  When I had my son, I was amazed at the amount of love I had, I didnt even know that much love existed.  For a while I was so wrapped up in him that my husband could have walked out on me and I wouldn't have cared in the least(this is normal too by the way).  Try to keep busy with something else though cuz it is not good for your health or the baby's for you to be under so much stress right now.  Rely on your family and friends for support and comfort.  Congratulations.|`|vm8HtVUYaa	You're just hormonal .. we all get emotional.<br>  I'm 33 weeks and I find myself getting teary-eyed at commercials.<br>  Just relax.. think about that perfect little baby inside of you that  loves you so much .. that baby that will always love you unconditionally, no matter what.<br>  Every little kick and punch and flutter . .it's like, "hi mom!"<br>  Just try to stay positive .. that little baby can feel your emotions.<br>  Good luck to you! and God bless!|`|2642373d5cf18942e834379c5a6fc077aa	eventually it will jus think about ya new baby on the way|`|ObuVkEsOaa	Your bound to be very upset hun and plus because your pregnant your hormones are all over the show at the moment up and down all the time, its natural though but its hard to find a way to cope with them. Im pregnant now and my hormones are a complete mess aswell hun. You need to focus on the baby from now on hun and yourself because if you keep getting upset and feeling down, then your going to make yourself ill hun plus you have a baby inside you who needs you to look after him/her. I hope you feel better soon and good luck with the baby x take care x|`|RmjZY1Kbaa	time heals. don't worry about it. live life, and try not to think of him|`|W2SNEydUaa	Of course its normal. Splitting up with someone is emotional enough and throw in the fact that your pregnant ?!<br>  <br>  Just think about the wonderful baby your going to have in your arms in a few months. After you have your baby you wont be able to think or worry about anyone else but him or her. <br>  <br>  I hope you feel better though. If you ever need to talk .....
2hDJO1Hfaa	yes ovulation and around ovulation are the best days to conceive. thats the time when egg is ready and can be fertilized by a healthy sperm. normally it is 14th day or around. life of sperm varies from 5 to 7 days so trying for pregnancy on 10th, 12th, 14th day can be of huge benefit than normal days. ovulation days vary from woman to woman though and pregnancy can happen at any time of the month but still thats the best time (10th 12th 14th) day. good luck!|`|4stgQNSeaa	That is the best way to conceive,lol.<br>  No but seriously the best time is 5 days before she think that she is going to ovulate, and up to 24 hours after she released an egg. Sperm can survive up to five days in cervical fluid, so when she sees any discharge, have sex, often, try at least every two days or so. Good luck!|`|MfuUAcNwaa	It the best time to get pregnant duh.|`|RrCWvIz4aa	I was told one time that a couple days before shes due for her period is the best time. I was also told by a doctor that trying many different positions can help the flow of the sperm.|`|cDS69QgAaa	find out when she has her period... if she is "regular" she will ovulate on or about 14 days after the first day she starts bleeding.  they sell ovulation kits at the drug store if you need more help.  she can also take her temperature on or around 24 days after her period starts... a woman's normal body temp. raises a degree or so when she's ovulating.  ovulation is the best time 2 get her pregnant!!! if all else fails... have her talk to her gynecologist... hope that helps!!! good luck!!!|`|M5wyBonFaa	when you have a steady job with a good income and a stable home..............but if you dont want to do it that way<br>  <br>  2 weeks after her period|`|AA10925312	Like she said, after you have steady income, can provide a good and loving home, and have gotten married to the woman you are willing to carry to the bathroom and wipe her butt when she can't!
EvlZc0BPaa	from what i understand you are very fertile after a miscarriage. a friend of mine miscarried and was pregnant again before ever having her period. this happened to her twice.<br>  anything is possible, good luck!!!!|`|trbNJrJbaa	yes the most vunrable time to get preg is after d&c i was told. i had to have one to hun horrible isnt it. so yes you could be preg pop to shops and get a test.. good luck xxx|`|WmjuLicqaa	I am in the same boat as you. I had a D&C on 4/13 due to missed miscarriage at 9.5 weeks. I am still waiting for my AF to show up. I had some PMS symptoms for a week now. I don't feel pregnant at all. I am sick of waiting for my AF to come, and nervous that I might be pregnant again.|`|hrObCYvlaa	it is possible
Q0EFie5Laa	I know of one mom who had this, around 25th week..baby seemed to start to catch up a bit..hit 20th percentile, was born at 38 weeks, and did fine...a very small baby..like 3 pounds 6 oz but now is 6 yrs old..extremely intellegent,,,although still wearing size 4 clothes, he wows people with his memory and smarts. His mom did have some early drug use, but no other risk factors, since delivered one normal pregnancy to a normal size baby. no infection was found, and he did not need a ventilator or anything, his lung developed fine, no heart defects, did have some early dental caries but that has been it...<br>  good luck, if you have a good heart rate, is moving, and has enough fluid, be hopeful, will add you and yours to our prayer list.|`|AA11045849	My baby has also been diagnosed with IUGR. They detected mine at an ultrasound last week. My daughter was a large baby and they wanted to see if this one would be too large to deliver vaginally. Imagine our surprize when they measured him at 5lbs 13oz. They repeated the ultrasound earlier this week and he weighed 7lbs 8oz but they are still monitering me closely. I see my OB twice a week and have non stress tests twice a week. I hope that your baby lives just follow your doctors advice, eat right and try to to stress too much! Good Luck!|`|AA11413299	I am so very sorry to hear that... I hope everything turns out ok for you...

Take a test, or ask ur doctor for a blood test.|`|4X6POg8Eaa	wait till your due and do a test...................................|`|5TtF3zoSaa	you could be pregnant.  take a pregnancy test and/or have your dr. check.|`|N2RnIHiVaa	Make an appointment with your OB for an exam.  Explain to the nurse about the spotting, miscarriage and etc.  You really don't need to mention the sex - they'll probably give you a urine test to be sure anyway.  Or you can take one at home and answer that question.<br>  <br>   But I would definitely make an appointment!
N2RnIHiVaa	You can get 2 tests in one box now.  I would recommend taking a test on your normal date if you don't start.  Then wait 10 days until your delayed period would start (if doesn't within the 10 days).  Since a lot of tests can recognize the additional hormone before you even get to your normal cycle time you can be pretty sure that whatever the results are - it will be accurate.<br>  <br>  Don't forget, your stressing out about things now could also delay your period!<br>  <br>  I know it is hard but TRY to relax and go about your normal daily life.  But do start to make the mental preparations just in case...|`|AA10991324	well i would count 28 days from the last time you got a period and test then if you dont get anything and then again a week later an since the last time you were ten days late test again in 3 days after that if still nothing try no to stress because you know what that can do well i hope this was of some help good luck hoe you get an answer soon and i hope it is the one you are looking for|`|qnfqlfDQaa	hi  i have had the same problem my periods were regular  until December my period was 5 days late i didn't pay any attention thinking it was stress related January month it was 7 days late passed it of again February month it was 10 days late just figured it was stress related or my hormones were out of whack  march month rolls around didn't have one waited for about a week thinking it was just late again went to the doctor because i was having sickness and cramping sends me to get blood work done and finds out that i was pregnant. the withdrawal  method doesn't always work in my case it didn't. but it don't mean that you are pregnant but i would go to the doctor to get a check up in case it is something.. go with with your gut and see your doctor ASAP.. Good luck

6e1884100ea01ca5c165183590f92363aa	You might still be pregnant. A UTI can cause cramps and sickness/nausea when it gets bad, but it usually does not delay a period for that long - 4 weeks.<br>  <br>  A blood test would be more accurate than a urine test. The bacteria from your infection might have obscured the urine test results.|`|aZdz2eyvaa	No I don't think so. <br>  <br>  And urine tests aren't always accurate. Get a blood test at your doctor's.|`|413b4fb0c6135de1977fbe2828766a1baa	you know it never hurts to read up on something you have like the Urinary Tract infection (UTI) here are some links you can do and read about the first one has treatment in there for you so many you can take the antibiotics for it and many it will help with cramps and nausea.. some side effects are nausea and or vomiting.<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.umm.edu/patiented/articles/what_treatments_symptoms_of_urinary_tract_infections_000036_7.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.umm.edu/patiented/articles/wh...</a><br>  <br>  (this one shows about the side effects)<br>  <a href="http://kidney.niddk.nih.gov/kudiseases/pubs/utiadult/#symptoms" rel="nofollow">http://kidney.niddk.nih.gov/kudiseases/p...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://healthlink.mcw.edu/article/943045598.html" rel="nofollow">http://healthlink.mcw.edu/article/943045...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  hope this helps you! get better soon!|`|Q0EFie5Laa	stess could cause you to be late, and yes there is a possibilty infection could play a role.<br>  are you on birth control, it might be messed up...IF you are not, and you do not desire a pregnacy..get on it immediatly
DslrcRHEaa	Definitly go talk to your doctor!!!  Once you've been off of b/c and trying to conceive for a year or more you are officially labeled infertile.  The good news is there are lots of reasons for this and lots of treatment options!!!  If you don't already track your cycles using basal body temeratures, ovulation prediction kits or a fertility monitor that's a good place to start!|`|trbNJrJbaa	SNAP, I HAD THE DEOP INJECTION ASWELL AND I BEEN TRYING TO GET PREGNANT FOR A YEAR NOW! i was told it should come out of my system after at least a month, im worried i have messed my reproductive system up aswell.. were seeing a doctor tomorrow about this. maybe go to your doctor|`|0bbb6736218115409a4c5e262c9f4901aa	talk to your doc. there are lots of fertility treatments that he or she can prescribe!! good luck !! fingers crossed for u!!!|`|pDRX7uSUaa	I was on depo for 5 years and i have been off it for 6 months <br>   I personally have had very irregular periods and have always thought that i might not be able to have a baby.

We went through three different pediatricians, and not one of them complained about how my son gained weight.  He was born 9lbs 8 oz.  He was 90th percentile for weight for 4 months.  I also would suggest finding another pediatrician.  Consider it a blessing that he sleeps that well! :)|`|e3dCJw87aa	According to my doctor, all races around the world grow at different rates and different areas of their body. My daughter at 5 months was told that she was too short, head was too big and a average weight. To the everyday person however she was a perfect size. I found it really depends on the Doctor and how broad their knowledge is on this topic.

J9Tbun7naa	I had a similar experience. Went to the hospital at 7 weeks due to some spotting, gestational sac measured at 6 weeks.. couldn't even see the embryo ( so obviously no heartbeat) I was scared as hell so I know exactly how you feel. Went back a week later to check for progress... Could clearly see embryo which measured at 7 weeks and a little heartbeat. Am now 15 weeks and everything is going well. 5 weeks is so early and your baby will grow so quickly. It's hard to believe that just 9 weeks ago I couldn't even make out the embryo and now, literature tells me my baby is like 10cms!!<br>  Also, what sort of ultrasound did you have... transvaginal ultrasounds are much more accurate at this early stage, if they did an abdominal ultrasound then it is not surprising they couldn't see it|`|57ae8f7cb314f2d5ab01174d55e06015aa	I was 6 weeks when I heard the 1st heartbeats!<br>  You can even see how the heart is beating.. and let me tell you it beats in a fast rate..<br>  <br>  I miscarried almost 2 months ago.. the baby was 7 weeks old... Just dont get nervous.. relax.. maybe it's too soon.. Just dont forget to let us know when you did hear it :)<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|1UbIADv6aa	6 weeks is usually when they can detect it.|`|lPgAbMcRaa	dont stress, I was 5 weeks when I went for mine and i could see a heart beat nor the lady could, after 5 and half weeks is when there able to see it, I went back at 8 half weeks and there was a heart beat!!! dont stress bubs fine. . . make anther apponiment abit after 7, 8 weeks and youll see!<br>  Good luck sweety
9uOLylGoaa	This is perfectly normal. The little bumps around your nipple are called Montgomery glands and they are normal during pregnancy. Your breast will be tender and sore and getting ready to feed baby. Do your breasts feel tight like they have milk in them. A lot of people will disagree with me and say that milk doesn't come in until after the baby is born but sometimes you can have small amounts of milk which make your breasts feel very tender. Remember you can take paracetamol as it will not affect your baby in any way and may ease some of the discomfort.|`|weY5yrNdaa	sounds like blocked milk ducts. You should see a doctor, just incase they are infected.|`|TfVzzchTaa	hello there nothing to worry about its just you body changing (getting ready for the big day) there is no time table for when this happens it just depends on your body if you are in that much pain then you can get some nipple cream from boots think its about ￡10 i know how you feel as i was one of the people like you who had very sore nipples & boobs & mine even leeked verry early i was 12 weeks when mine started leeking this time hope this helps you & try not to worry to much sarah thomas

You do know the risks of having a baby after 35 right?|`|WUx5Trqmaa	yea.well my mom was 33 but close enough,and it was worst on her because she smoked while she was pregnant and the baby came out at 5 pounds and 11 oz.But besides that he was fine and still is.|`|fFLlZUUSaa	My step-mom had a miscarriage and D&C at 34.

AiHlyR8raa	Dunque La mamma sente i primi movimenti intorno alla ventesima settimana. Tu naturalmente per sentire i calci del bambino devi aspettare sul quinto mese. Naturalmente se si aspettano 2 gemelli normalmente la pancia ingrossa di più. E naturalmente si fa il doppio della fatica con due gemelli (devo dire che in Italia, tranne qualche centro, gemelli uguale cesareo.) Se il parto è naturale puoi assistere, per la telecamera dovrai chiedere al medico o all'infermiera al momento del parto. Chiedi tranquillo.|`|1nCKx4vzaa	te sei un maschio perciò non lo puoi sentire c\asomai la donna lo sente scalciare muoversi ecc, anche se è nella pancia anche lui è un essere umano perciò mngia,dorme e fà tutto ciò che fanno gli essere umani o almeno le cose principali cmq lo dovresti sentire se appoggi la mano sulla pancia di una donna verso 8 mesi insomma quando stà per nascere.|`|2DsSL8aHaa	io ho un gemello, e come spesso capita in questi casi (parlo del caso di parti naturali) siamo nati un po' prematuri (quasi di 8 mesi): madre natura "agevola " le cose facendo sì che molti gemellini nascano un po' prima del tempo e quindi siano un po' più piccini rispetto ad un pupo che si è fatto 9 mesi filati in pancia!!! poi magari c'è bisogno di qualche settimana in incubatrice...<br>  in bocca al lupo!|`|Qq8OXAaPaa	guarda t vorrei aiutare ma nn so proprio ke dirti!<br>  xkè nn cerki 1 sito su qst argomento?<br>  cmq s può assistere al parto e il bimbo sente la presenza xò me sembra dal 4 o 5 mese ed è + faticoso partorire 2 bambini<br>  Ciao ciao Maribel spero d esserti stato 1 pò d'aiuto!|`|678c7f484f6f17a7660740036303a505aa	No, la videocamera no!<br>  Ma dai, la tua donna è lì che muore dal dolore e ha bisogno di sostegno e di forza e tu sei lì a girare il filmino come in uno show!

Where i'm from you are considered an adult/grown up when you have complete control over it. <br>  <br>  But anyway, i had similar problems, but probably to a lesser degree.  I used to give in to it, but it will only get worse.  What worked for me is like mind over body, like turning the hormone volume down within me.  Couldn't surpress it (mute doesn't work, and i'm not sure it's healthy).  Bathing with cold (not freezing) water helps sometimes, but i still consider that "externally applied remedy," and i usually can't bathe (no access to a bathroom/shower) whenever i get the urge. Focusing your mind on something else also worked for me (prayers, homework, etc), and i don't mean it like a distraction, but actually occupying myself in that task.<br>  <br>  When all else fail, get married and have sex legally.|`|q1W9JF1iaa	lol, yea..find a counselor.
de8b710a2152b97f3cf9de81f8967564aa	You can tell the difference between early period bleeding and implantation bleeding b/c implantation bleeding occurs a bit earlier than expected, is scanty, spotty, pinkish and not red and heavy like a period, and does not follow the normal pattern of a period (light to heavy to light). <br>  <br>  There is often the feeling that it is a period with light cramps and bloating, but the bleeding is shorter, lighter and just not normal. <br>  <br>  If a woman is usually regular, and now all of a sudden develops this type of early spotting, and of course is "at risk" for a pregnancy, I would strongly suspect conception.|`|1469145fbc54553729532a83a0ba1985aa	It could be many things. It's not implantation bleeding, but depending on the amount of blood, you either are having an early period OR you're having a miscarriage.|`|YllMlLdhaa	Implantation bleeding is a pink or brown vaginal discharge that generally occurs six to 12 days after ovulation and fertilization. Most women do not experience implantation bleeding, and doctors suggest that just 1/3 pregnant women will report any such discharge at or around the time they find out they are pregnant. The discharge occurs when the fertilized egg implants in the uterus, which is why it is referred to as implantation bleeding. Usually, you can test for pregnancy and get an accurate result right around the time that you experience implantation bleeding.<br>  <br>  <br>  Many women get scared when they see implantation bleeding or assume that they must not be pregnant because it looks like blood. Cramping, backache, or increased bleeding does not usually accompany implantation bleeding. For most women, implantation bleeding is simply a bit of brown or pink colored discharge mixed in with a clear discharge. If you have already confirmed your pregnancy and it is more than 10 days since fertilization, you probably will not see the implantation bleeding, so if you see blood you should call your doctor and follow his or her instructions carefully as you could be experiencing a miscarriage.

56989d007eb9f42f3eb843843eed06e6aa	Hola., depende mucho de tus antecedentes., por ejemplo si eres primigesta eso es un TDP FL(trabajo de parto en fase latente)., es decír inicia el trabajo de parto., y si eres multigesta(1-más embarazos)., puede ser que esa dilatción sea consecuente al parto previo., ahora bién según las normas del INPER., se puede esperar., obviamente con la realización de RCTG (registro cardiotocografico).,por lo menos cada 3 dias y no haya datos de sufrimiento fetal., además de USG.,para valorar líquido., si no  hasta antes de las 41 SDG se puede  ver si nace expontaneo., a las 41 se debe inducír TDP ó cesárea si existe indicación.|`|85d8b0dcd1fbfa3019be16a8d57ad641aa	CLARO QUE SI!!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  ESTAS A PUNTO DE DAR A LUZ........

No es por asustarte pero conozco dos casos cercanos.<br>  Asi que no esperes más y vuela al doctor y peleale que tu bebe ya quiere venir.<br>  Que Dios los bendiga!<br>  Mari|`|ZTqxR3F2aa	no|`|3Uunm2Pvaa	esta bien tener 1 cm y mas si ya tubiste hijos<br>  tenes que ir para el hospital cuando sientas 2 contracciones en menos de 15 min|`|I7kWgft8aa	El periodo normal de gestación de un bebé es de 40 semanas ciertamente.... asi que lo mas recomendable es que vayas por supuesto a valoración ya que en caso de que no sea el nacimiento como tal puede ser debido a amenaza de aborto... pero por supuesto que es normal por el tiempo que te comento.|`|fswrTGhjaa	yo tuve 1 cm de dilatacion por dos dias seguidos y no dilate mas hasta el tercer dia y sientes que el bb se encaja pero mientras no te den dolores fuertes como colicos aun no es hora <br>  <br>    felicidades y suerte

Good luck!!|`|Q0EFie5Laa	you and your husband might want to see a dr. if you have been trying for one year..but you both need to go<br>  get a ovolation tester to see when you ovulate|`|b774d04c2b65cc1269ae055e8e4e03b7aa	Chart.  It's the best way to know exactly when you ovulate.<br>  <br>  Join <a href="http://forums.ovusoft.com/" rel="nofollow">http://forums.ovusoft.com/</a>  , it's a great TTC & TTA forum.  I love all of the gals there!|`|AA11110785	You start counting from the first day you have your period.  You count off 20 days.  Day 14-20 is when you can get pregnant.  <br>  Have lots and lots of sex during that week.  Have sex missionary style.  More sperm stays in when your on the bottom.  If your on top, more sperm will come out.  Gravity.<br>  After sex, stay put for a while before you get up.  <br>  Good luck.<br>  My kids are 10 months apart.
Q0EFie5Laa	go back on monday,the longer the baby stays put the better<br>  but viability is good for a 31 weeker...I would prefer a girl...they do better, but your son would be fine, they did not admit you so I dont think you are in premature labor now<br>  but let the dr. know if any change is noted|`|ff7aa0549813d4a1320246f7c753ce94aa	Having the baby now would cause complications for him.  Try to hold off for at least 5 more weeks to give his lungs more time to mature.  Good Luck!|`|AA10552909	Um - did you really see a doctor?  There is no such thing and no such medical term as a "short cervix".|`|09364c564a299f77bf14bfdf0f3d03a6aa	Actually, a short cervix is a real thing... it's just not the medical term for it. It can be caused by many things. I had a cone biopsy when I was 16 weeks pregnant and now I have an insufficient cervix. It's too short now. That and your cervix effaces in the last few weeks of pregnancy meaning it thins out, or gets shorter. I am 32 weeks today and everything is still fine. I have been having a lot of the same symptoms recently myself and the doctors told me to just relax and take it easy. Also, don't stress about anything. That can make it much worse. Remember everything you are feeling is normal, and you're not alone. If you search around you can find some stories of babies born at 31 weeks gestation. It may put you at ease. I know they helped me. Also, my brother was only 27 weeks gestation when he was born and he is 13 now and extremely healthy and active. He's also on the honor role in his class with the top average this year. You have nothing to worry about unless your doctor says otherwise. So sit back and enjoy the last few weeks before the baby comes. And if you want to chat sometime, my hotmail is chinko2005@hotmail.com.|`|YXOnGg8Kaa	I went into preterm labor and was put on bed rest at 32 weeks. I am now 35 weeks and doing ok.. I was 70% effaced and 2 centermeters dialated, I was having menstaral like cramps..not really painful just uncomfortable. When you Doctor says it is short..that means it is effaced or thining out. <br>  <br>  You really need to take it easy and drink lots of water, being deyhration (?) is one cause of preterm labor.. <br>  <br>  Your doctors are really going to want you to get to at least 36 weeks for the best chance of the babies health. They may start you on a prescription of Tribulin to stop the contractions, it makes your heart race and makes you feel kinda crazy at first. <br>  <br>  Best of luck & please take it easy! Keep us posted!!
mVqvqoz5aa	Hes just concerned and finally got up the nerve to say something to you about it. I agree he shouldnt have yelled but should have calmly asked you to either not lay together or to stay somewhere else in the house that isnt so private. I dont see a problem with you and your gf just talking as long as the door was open. If the door was closed, then your dad probly had visions of his son getting a girl pregnant or something. He just doesnt want you to get a girl pregnant at such a young age I guess. He wants you to live your life and simply just wants the best for his son. He did go a little overboard but dont stop talking to him. Your gf will probly never feel comfortable around your dad again. If she does, it will take a long time. It'll be ok though. Kids will be kids, and parents will be parents.|`|d57e29c219b565c305798b1e32e4886faa	Stop laying on your bed with your girlfriend.|`|188fda227edd0e5dda2c493b80e9b783aa	Well, laying down together doesn't look right ,but he didn't have to yell (he's the dad?)but it is good that he care cause who knows one day yall will do it.|`|2226add0d92195b7464d8abd3f4291fdaa	Some times men have a problem talking to there sons. Just be glad he cares about your life. He may of had a bad day and then felt nervous talking about it and getting so "sensitive". Cut him some slack. As far as your gf, she will get over it, just may take a while. He was not mad at her, thats what i would tell her.|`|AA11563131	wow thats ruff.<br>  ok my mom told me my bf and i were too close cuz i had my legs on him<br>  <br>  my mom is so dumb. but she was havin sex by the time she was my age so shes just tryin to protect me, but i still think she should trust me.<br>  <br>  anyway...ur girlfriend just needs to know that she didnt do anything and that ur dad is just paranoid, bcuz thats the truth!<br>  <br>  if ur parents nvr said anything in 10 months, they should be fine now..<br>  <br>  how old are you guys??|`|AA11691571	scream back at your dad when you have  chance and i dont thnk your gf will be conforable around your dad so go to her house.|`|d3sBbEkjaa	its not his position to dictate what looks right or wrong your girlfriend will be calm in time and your father probabley had a bad day so take it easy these things go away

b8b06f4ecb41e0dcbbef0bdfac455625aa	Wait a week and take a pregnancy test.|`|sqTiRa57aa	At any point where it is even *possible* sperm/semen [this includes precum] could have gotten in, on or near the vagina there is a chance you could conceive pregnant. Do not rely on symptoms, as symptoms of pregnancy are often at times ALSO symptoms of other things and problems. May it be major or minor, you could be getting 100 different symptoms of being pregnant and something completely different could be happeneing to your body. In order to conceive pregnant sperm must enter the vagina, pool in the cervix, join with an "egg" and attatch to the uterus creating an embryo. This seems like such a long drawn out process and the little "swimmer" has such a long way to go, foreplay and other sexual encounters shouldn't be able to get a women pregnant, right? Wrong! It is possible to conceive during many different acts, not just vaginal sexual intercourse. Did you know if a man ejaculates into a woman's anus, those little "swimmers" can actually "SWIM" out of the anus, into the vagina, pool in the cervix, attatch to an "egg" that attatches to the uterine wall creating an embryo and conceive a pregnancy! A woman can become pregnant through foreplay, anal intercourse, or as I said before, at any point where it is even *possible* sperm/semen [this includes precum] could have gotten in, on or near the vagina. Contraceptive [such as "the pill", condoms, spermicide, IUD's ect.] are NOT, are NEVER 100% fail-proof.<br>  <br>  If your period is irregular [even if it is common for your period to be irregular] and there is a chance you may be pregnant, take a HPT [home pregnancy test]. If it shows negative, try another a few days later. If you continue to receive negative HPT's but you still *appear* to be pregnant, see your local OB/GYN or family practitioner, receive a blood test to confirm the negative pregnancy. If you receive a negative blood test [which are also not full proof!] but are still concerned that you may be pregnant, receive an ultrasound. This will show whether or not there is an embryo attatched in the uterus. If no embryo shows there may be something wrong and your doctor can futher diagnose you.<br>  <br>  If a HPT, blood test or ultrasound confirm pregnancy, find an OB/GYN immediately! It is important to keep an tabs on everything going on in your pregnancy from step one, even if you plan on abortion or adoption.<br>  <br>  If you have decided to become sexually active but are not TTC [trying to conceive] please be responsible and use proper birth control. If you do not have the money to purchase birth control visit your local Free Clinic. There are Free Clinics in every area and will provide you with proper care. <br>  <br>  If you are underage and afraid to look to a parent or guardian, visits to Free Clinics and your OB/GYN *ARE* completely 100% confidential, although I would advise looking to at least one influencial adult in your life, this would create a support system where you could obtain knowledge, ask other questions, and discuss personal things with.<br>  <br>  Good luck!

75EN1Asnaa	è una domanda molto difficile questa....<br>  Dunque.... spero non mi giudicherete un superficiale o un carnefice.... anche se non m interessa molto il giudizio degli altri...<br>  Mettere al mondo un bambino con handicap è una grossa responsabilità, molto molta più responsabilità di un bambino normale.<br>  Dipende dal tipo di handicap.<br>  Tuttavia io sono dell'idea che avere un bambino diversamente abile sia un grosso colpo alla vita, che sicuramente peggiorerà visto le cure costanti che il bambino deve ricevere.<br>  Inoltre e soprattutto per questo lo dico, il bambino sarà sempre infelice, perchè ho avuto amici diversamente abili, e non potevano non provare che tristezza di fronte agli altri bambini, vedendo il loro stato.<br>  Non poter giocare con loro, essere rilegato su una carrozzina, le difficoltà nel lavoro, nel campo sentimentale, l'essere costantemente emarginato (purtroppo è la nuda e cruda verità)... Tutte queste cose fanno sorgere naturalmente la domanda al ragazzo stesso.... ma chi me lo ha fatto fare?<br>  Per cui penso che al giorno d'oggi, abortire in certe situazioni sarebbe meglio, non solo per noi, ma per il ragazzo stesso.|`|21ml29njaa	si solo perche è handiccappato non puoi negare la vita a una persona.|`|5c4a7835645dca16e460ad5c893d3d13aa	Credo di no, sarebbe un discorso egoistico al contrario, volere farlo nascere lo stesso e cosa gli garantisco? niente, posso curarlo, ma il giorno che io non ci sarò più chi si occuperà di lui? nessuno..... quindi anche se è una scelta dolorosa penso che sarebbe meglio abortire|`|7LYsHIBCaa	no xchè il bimbo è già formato a 5 mesi e poi nn puoi buttare una vita come se niente fosse altrimenti vivrai sempre con il rimorso sulla coscienza pe aver UCCISO<br>  <br>  L'ABORTO NN E' UN DIRITTO MA UN DELITTO!!!|`|9Tf2ycp4aa	NO!

Certo, come genitori si potrebbe avere alcuni problemi, ma alla fine è tuo figlio, lo aiuteresti spontaneamente. Non tenerlo non sarebbe una cosa giusta, per te e per lui. Conosco un ragazzo handicappato che lavora in un negozio di almentari, si da il suo da fare, sistema le sue cose ed è assolutamente capace di svolgere quel lavoro. Certo ci sono diversi gradi di handicap, ma un figlio rimarrà sempre tuo figlio, e qualunque sia la sua malattia non potrai mai non volergli bene. Poi, fai quello che ti senti, il mio è un consiglio.

Poi, per fortuna, non ho dovuto prendere questa decisone terribile, ma ammiro chi questa ofrza ce l'ha.

ShrhbLoXaa	Sinceramente..quello che voleva fare l'ha fatto...poi che ti abbia fatto gli auguri o no non conta proprio niente!

1bwTSW59aa	L'effetto principale della pillola del giorno dopo è ritenuto per lo più essere di tipo antinidatorio. In sostanza il levonorgestrel presente nella pillola provoca alcune alterazioni dell'utero tali da ostacolare e impedire l'impianto dell'embrione eventualmente concepito; laddove l'ovulazione non sia ancora avvenuta,il progestinico la impedisce, evitando di fatto ogni possibilità di fecondazione. Le alterazioni provocate sono biochimiche e morfologiche. Il levonorgestrel infatti provoca:<br>  <br>  - modifiche ai 'fattori di impianto', in particolare alle integrine, proteine presenti nella parete dell'utero che svolgono un ruolo fondamentale nel favorire l'annidamento dell'embrione umano<br>  <br>  - modifica delle caratteristiche dell'endometrio (la parete dell'utero), tali da renderlo inadatto ad ospitare l'embrione umano, in particolare una cospicua riduzione del suo spessore (che per un buon impianto dovrebbe essere tra i 5 e i 13 mm), la comparsa di aree edematose, l'atrofia ghiandolare<br>  <br>  Si tratta dunque di un'azione che si definisce "intercettiva": il farmaco cioè, laddove il concepimento dell'essere umano sia avvenuto, impedisce l'annidamento nell'endometrio dell'embrione generato. Il farmaco quindi non attacca direttamente l'embrione umano; esso tuttavia di fatto interrompe il processo della gravidanza allo stato iniziale, causando il mancato impianto dell'embrione umano e la sua morte quando lo stesso è ancora allo stadio di blastocisti(composto da oltre cento cellule) definito da alcuni pre-embrione. Va in questo caso ricordato che parte della comunità scientifica ritiene che la gravidanza possa dirsi iniziata solo con l'impianto dell'embrione umano nell'utero; pertanto si discute se alla pillola del giorno dopo possa essere attribuito un carattere schiettamente abortivo.<br>  <br>  Ovviamente se il concepimento non è avvenuto per qualunque motivo, la pillola non provocherà alcun aborto.<br>  <br>  Il levonorgestrel agisce meno efficacemente come anti-ovulatorio, quindi ritarda il processo di ovulazione con minor successo; in questo caso esso impedisce il concepimento, dunque si tratta di un effetto contraccettivo o anti-concezionale. E' ovviamente necessario che l'ovulazione non sia ancora avvenuta. In ogni caso l'efficacia del prodotto è dovuta principalmente all'effetto intercettivo, quello esplicitamente contraccettivo ha luogo in un numero minore di casi.<br>  L'efficacia della pillola del giorno dopo è tanto maggiore quanto al più presto viene utilizzata. è dimostrato da uno studio dell'OMS che l'assunzione entro le prime 24 ore dal rapporto a rischio ha un'efficacia del 95%, entro le prime 72 ore del 58%.<br>  <br>  Se la pillola invece viene assunta dopo che l'impianto è avvenuto, non disturba la continuazione della gravidanza.|`|0af8fb0bd561e81038a4814a78d06b3baa	hai fatto il test?|`|ff6545350a2f2c4fe212b295014dde59aa	Inizia a comprare un test di gravidanza.<br>  Se è negativo, ripetilo dopo 10 giorni.<br>  Se è ancora negativo, aspetta il prossimo ciclo.

I calcoli, per il periodo fecondo si fanno partendo, dall'inizio del ciclo, non quando finisce. Es. se ti sono finite il 29/7, si presume che siano iniziate il giorno 24/25 luglio, quindi, in tal caso, il tuo periodo fecondo doveva essere il giorno 4/5 agosto. Considerato però, che gli spermatozoi, in temperatura ideale, vivono anche 3/5 giorni, hai rischiato di grosso. L'essenziale è che tu stia tranquilla, fammi sapere, vedrai che andrà tutto bene.|`|dbltwaGpaa	io ti direi di stare più che tranquilla!!!!uno perchè non eri nel periodo più ferile,due perchè la pillola del giorno dopo è sicura al 99 % e poi dipende dopo quando la prendi,si può prendere entro 72 ore,figurati!!!tu l'hai presa solo dopo 2 ore.!!!!tranquilla!!!!!!!!|`|9ze2lBe2aa	credo che le possibilità che tu possa essere incinta siano molto basse, avete fatto tutto quello che bisognava, e la pillola del giorno dopo serve appunto per quello....io starei tranquilla :-)|`|A8j1erpJaa	se la pillola e presa prima di passare 12 ore allora le probabilità di non essere incinta e di 85%.perqui puoi stare tranquilla.ma se vuoi essere ancora di piu prendi un test di gravidanza e farlo.in bocca al lupo|`|AiHlyR8raa	non so perchè la ginecologa ti ha voluto spaventare. io penso che tu non sia incinta. ma se vuoi fugare i sospetti prendi un kit per la gravidanza e fallo.|`|Dj9zuVw9aa	stai tranquilla.. se hai preso la pillolla del gg dp nn ci dovrebbero essere problemi.. la pillolla del gg dp  la maggior parte dei casi è efficace ma può capitare che come in tt le cose non funzioni ma è solo una piccola percentuale.. e poi avevi appena finito le mestruazioni e per qst il rischio è ancora più basso.. cmq buona fortuna...|`|EMksZey3aa	provare a fare il test no???|`|KFfrXWSVaa	In ogni caso aspettare un bimbo è la cosa più bella del mondo.

jgP51MlRaa	Just leave it, as you say you are 19 and an adult, as long as your being responsible then it doesn't really matter.<br>  <br>  If your mum wants to talk about it with you then she will, although she'll probably be as embarrassed about talking about it as you'd be.<br>  <br>  Just make sure you don't leave anything laying around in your car in future :)<br>  <br>  Maj|`|AykczQleaa	I would confront her about it, not about snooping, but just the test in general.  If you are that close to your aunt...then you should be that close with your mother.|`|TN3Sthbwaa	Tell her what you just told us. <br>  <br>  "I am an adult, you have no right to snoop through my private property.  You have embarrassed me and I am very angry with you."|`|QfMciQ27aa	Talk to her about it, show her that you are mature enough to deal with it. She is probably upset that you are not her little girl anymore, and has realised that you are grown up and are able to make decisions for yourself and live your own life. Sit down with her and say, "i know you are upset with me about this, but i want us to be able to discuss it maturely, as adults" <br>  <br>  Sex is not wrong, nor is it an indicator of bad morals, it is a natural part of adulthood, but this is my opinion and your mother may feel differently. If you dont feel you can talk to her then just put it behind you, forget about it and move on.|`|24072a527355deb8895a64a72f7622f1aa	Well if you are an adult then you are right, she has no right to snoop in your car, unless it is her car, that you are using.  <br>  <br>  Well since you are an adult, then you have the right to make whatever choices you want.  But as long as you are living at home, you have to follow the rules.  If you can't do that, then go somewhere where there are no rules are you are free to act as slutty as you want.<br>  <br>  Too bad you did not learn anything from the morals she taught you, if you had you wwould not be in this situation.|`|tQ4g94p6aa	was it positive or negative???/<br>  <br>  you are an adult<br>  she had no right in your car<br>  and your raised with morals cause your not younger you an adult|`|fj4AdDGgaa	just tell her it wasn't yours, you and your girlfriends were together with a bunch of guys having an orgy and one of the condoms broke while your friend was engaged in sex with two of the guys and yourself at once and she wanted to make sure she wasn't pregnant.<br>  <br>  <br>  that will take her attention significantly away from the pregnancy test, tell her that "its none of your business" in a sarcastic way that is not directly confrontational, and sew enough doubt in her mind that she really won't want to know or ask again for fear that it is actually true.<br>  <br>  you win- sarcasm rules all.|`|f0ij7Hb2aa	Sorry about the trouble it will probably cause for a while, but if you intend to be treated like an adult, you have to act like one.<br>  <br>  Confront her.  Tell her your sex life and your car's contents are *your* responsibility, and that they're none of her business unless you tell/ask her about them.<br>  <br>  (FYI: I was born just after my mother's 19th birthday... that was 48 years ago and my parents weren't married when I was conceived... and if you need pregancy testing, you're probably not being careful enough about your fertility.)|`|swphEjWraa	My grandma had my mom at 19.<br>  I don't think your mom should feel that bad.<br>  It's not like your 12.<br>  If I were you tell your mom that she didn't raise you bad to make her feel better.

Tomng8j6aa	Babies do all kinda things that may seem weird to us. I never experienced that with my children, but that doesnt make it abnormal. If she is not harming herself then I wouldnt worry about it, but if her behavior bothers you, next time she pulls her hair, lightly grab her hand and tell her how pretty her hair is and not to do that, same with the biting and pinching.|`|pvJsmHtYaa	do as joyegf says and talk to your pediatrician asasp...|`|wQTsWUuGaa	she is just exploring her body. my 2 year old daughter has been doing that since about 6 months old and still does it.|`|oRJYLPfGaa	You need to get her checked out!!!! No this is NOT normal!!|`|wmOgseCgaa	You should speak to your pediatrician....it doesn't sound right.|`|2722dc4f9ad14b1f710802a19159d586aa	I would have her checked by a Dr. especially if she isn't showing pain when she does these things. BUT Most children do start doing similar things, at this age. It's time to start telling her NO in a stern voice or tapping her hand when she does it. so that she knows that it;s a negative thing to do. But at the same time when she's no doing those things, be sure to give her plenty of love and attention so she won't get "stressed out". She should feel secure enough in her own enviorment not to do those things.
23f31edadd848986d68302d320132be6aa	it's fine, i think.  as long as it's not after 6 weeks, i WOULD definitely call the doc then.<br>  momofb&d|`|cnMXJMFUaa	Very normal...you can bleed up to around 8 weeks if not breastfeeding.|`|DkEYzONuaa	I bled very lightly up until about the week before my post partum check up.|`|UnDFzBiSaa	yes. i was bleeding for about a month aftward.<br>   <br>  my baby is now 2 months old and my period is still all out of wack.<br>  <br>  give yourself about 3 months for your period to get straightened back out.<br>  once it stops..dont be suprised if a week later it starts again.<br>  or maybe even days later.<br>  it will come and go sometimes.<br>  <br>  but of course everyone is differnt.<br>  <br>  but yep. its normal. perfectly normal.<br>  so no worries.<br>  <br>  congrats on the baby.<br>  good luck. hope it stops soon. i know how badly it sucks. especially going 9 months without it. now you get it and your like darn it..i forgot about this. shux! :-(<br>  lol|`|jQ09AD6Jaa	Yes this is normal, I was still bleeding when I went back to the doctor for my 6 week check up.  It will eventually stop.|`|klYvhZORaa	Oh, yes. It lasted about 6 weeks for me before it was completely gone. It's not so fun, but keep in mind that this is weight you are losing!!!|`|3RGoRUYMaa	def. normal. i bled for about 4-5 weeks after having my son. <br>  <br>  Bleeding after the birth of your baby may continue for between six weeks and three months. Though it is more common for bleeding to stop around six weeks it is still normal to continue bleeding if:<br>  <br>  the uterus has returned to normal size,<br>  <br>  you are not running a temperature, <br>  <br>  you are not passing clots or tissue or feeling exceptionally fatigued, and there is no foul odour associated with the bleeding, then all is probably fine.|`|8d60efe137bf26ecf637a51dbe567a3eaa	You should be fine as long as it is light and not heavy or have clotting still...but I was that way until my 6 week post partum checkup.|`|HotMRcTQaa	very normal|`|SXoZa0Wlaa	Yes, i did the same. some women bleed up until their post partum check up|`|TgEB4f1Gaa	yes, its normal, i was almost 3 months post before it stopped completely.... : ( i know, im not very encouraging, sorry! also, i was so sore for *months* afterwards. Doc said the long recovery period was due to bits of placenta left behind and the stitches tearing a little. basically, he gave me a "hang in there, eventually it gets better." and he was right : ) good luck! and congrats on ur new little one!|`|V9A01IbDaa	Very, it took me 6 weeks to stop completely, but I think they say it can take all the way up to 12 weeks to stop!  It is annoying!!!<br>  <br>  Mommy to 5 y.o., 3 y.o. twins and 35 weeks preg. w/ baby #4|`|lM11f486aa	yes I bled for 8 weeks with my daughter.|`|qbJxvcAaaa	yeah ive had 3 children and even bleed 2 months after my 1st one
RVABrMeSaa	my oldest started at about six months. start with rice cereal mix with formula not milk; one spoonful, then two, then three or more. If no bad reaction add apple sauce;same way. Only add different foods slowly and don't give two new things at once so you can note allergy. Babies generally like cereals and fruit it gets harder when introducing vegetables and lastly meats <br>  <br>  oh a good idea is to give small amounts so less spitting back.|`|1076e9d153dd3c70fe2ffa7c2d974ce0aa	4months and my son took to solids straight away.............i started with baby rice then veg and now he is 6months he as white meat that's been well blended up<br>  <br>  <br>  btw i know people say you should start baby's on solids at 6months but when i was a baby the age was 3months and it never did me any harm|`|8b87e4e5789fb6f0e20a8b0d3d8af24baa	<a href="http://www.annabelkarmel.com/features/babies-6-months/introducing-solids" rel="nofollow">http://www.annabelkarmel.com/features/ba...</a><br>  <br>  There are lots of articles on the google website about introducing solids....<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&q=introducing+solids+to+babies&btnG=Google+Search&meta=cr%3DcountryUK|countryGB" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&q=i...</a><br>  <br>  edit: Thumbs down???|`|jgP51MlRaa	My son started solids at 16 weeks, he loved his food from the start, at 6 months he progressed from 2 to 3 solid meals a day.<br>  <br>  I guess we're lucky in as much he's not a fussy eater and loves his meal times<br>  <br>  Maj|`|hmX4ko0Eaa	5 months. He loves his food and never spits it out! At 8 months he now eats food mashed with a fork rather than pureed|`|TAGsuqu2aa	I started giving my daughter solids when she appeared to be ready for it. She was about 4 1/2 months. She seemed hungry all the time and acted like she wanted more than formula. So I started off giving her cereal which she didn't like at all. Gave her sweet potatoes, carrots, apple sauce and she loves it! She doesn't spit because I only feed her when she wants it. She will be 5 months in a few days and she's gotten used to eating it on a regular basis. |`|XBXjeaYGaa	I started both of my girls on cereals at 6 weeks.  My Dr. directed me to do so because my babies would suck down a bottle so fast that they couldn't keep it all down.  I only gave them a little at a time, and I never put it in the bottle.  They both took it right off the spoon.  When they went on to solids, they were both started on vegetables first, always the yellow and orange ones.|`|UPHTowRYaa	I started giving my son oatmeal cereal just shy of 5 months.  He took to it immediately and did not have spit out issues.  After a few hesitant bites, he was opening his mouth wide for the spoon.  <br>  <br>  A good tip for starting cereal/purees is to put a little on the spoon and put it to your baby's lips.  Do not stick it in his/her mouth, but rather allow him/her to use the sucking reflex to take it in.  It helps your baby get used to the new taste and texture much easier.  Good luck!|`|Wau5TsQUaa	My son started at five months, my daughter at 4.  You can tell when they are ready by how they respond to you eating.  They will reach for your food and you can see their mouth start to move, mimicking eating.  It will take two or three tries with the spoon before they are on it completely.  |`|6103GawBaa	I started giving my 8 week old rice cereal in a bottle.  I gradually increased it from a quarter teaspoon to a full teaspoon over a few days. My baby spits up a little here and there but all babies spit up.   I plan to give her fruits and vegi's around 4 months.|`|mPyN2XX3aa	I started a little before 5 months but was advised by my doctor to stop and wait until 6 months due to allergy reasons.  When the time came my daughter never really got used to it.  She hated baby food and never really ate it.  |`|VlStaQ3yaa	my son started solids at 4mths, rice cereal. and started real foods at 5mths. he loved it immediately :) he seemed happy to get something heavy in his system.|`|hQMiSlvMaa	My daughter started solids at 6 months, she loved it... never spit it out.  she is turning 1 in a week, very healthy and loves her food...LOL|`|89ZTOvqwaa	My son was 4 months old when I started the rice. He never spit any of it out! He loved it! And 6 months for the veggies and fruits! It depends on your baby if they like it or not. If they spit it out don't force it just try again the next day! Good luck to you!|`|tAQBUzQCaa	I waited till 6 months to introduce solids. I love to be able to say that for the first 6 months she was breastfed exclusively.|`|HmX06zdfaa	My middle child had to be on rice at 2 months but my other two started solids at 5 months.|`|uG8yLnUWaa	These days they advise 6 months as they believe that starting earlier may increase the risks of food allergies and they don't really need anything else except milk at this stage. The advised way to do it is to start with a little rice cereal, if they spit it out, it can mean that they are not ready. Just try a little each day after their milk If they are ready, it won't get spit back out for to long!! After the rice cerreal slowly introduce food in the way of pureed vegies - pumpkin, sweet potato, potato seem to be the most popular first foods. Then just introduce new foods at your leisure. There are some things that babies shouldn't eat until certain ages (honey for example should be 12months) so consult health nurse about these. It can apparently take 10 tries at a food before a child will like/hate it, so don't give up if they don't take to something on the first try!!<br>  <br>  Oh, and prepare to get messy!! Have fun
RPszYGXkaa	Yes, it is normal.  I know it is scary and frustrating all at the same time.  The suction that is created when they bottle feed is painful.  If she is 6.5 mos you can try offering her some cereal mixed with formula.  That way she will get more formula in her.  I used to make it a little soupy so it was mainly formula.  Also try offering her small amounts frequently vs a big bottle.<br>  Also before feeding try giving her a teething ring that is chilled, it can help numb the gums.<br>  You can try orajel, etc. but give at least 15 mins before feeding.  They tend to swallow it and it can numb their throats a bit, so wait a while before offering the bottle.<br>  Hylands teething tablets are another alternative, they didn't do much to help my baby, but some Mom's swear by them.<br>  The best way to help her is to distract her with playing.<br>  Rest assured when she is really hungry she will take the bottle.  I remember a few nights of just keeping the bottle in her mouth and while she didn't take it right away, within a minute she would begin drinking it, and finish it.<br>  It is a trying time, but this too will pass.  If you are really concerned call her Dr, they can give you an idea of how much formula she HAS to have per day to be sure she is nourished and hydrated.|`|Me4kGy3Baa	my girl had no problem when her bottom 2 came in, but the top ones, she had a fever for 2 days, and wouldn't eat. so i just breastfed her replacing her cereal, veggies, and fruit that she's been eating and loving since she was 6 months old.  <br>  <br>  she probably didn't eat for just the weekend only.  but i kept trying her, just to see if she'd eat.  She has her appetite back, but the teeth never poked through yet, her gums are just getting whiter.  <br>  <br>  hope everything is well with you, good luck!|`|y3tPrTtBaa	that can happen more often than not, as long as she is eating on a daily basis, but due to pain and anxiety babies do tend to eat less during this period and bounce right back, you may want to try the water filled teething rings that you freeze- it is summer, kids like those or if you want to use meds the baby oragel is good also, the natural remedies work wonders too- like chamomile tea makes them less fuzzy.....|`|ZSBXcwbUaa	The sucking from nursing hurts, so they're less likely to nurse or take a bottle.  Teething biscuits, frozen washcloths, or toast are great.  She'll start eating again soon.  If she seems to be in pain, ask your doctor about teething tablets, Tylenol or other options.|`|lXcH7ekkaa	Yeah both of my daughters ate less when they were teething. they seemed reluctant to put food in their mouths, but would chew on any non edible hard item!!!|`|wmOgseCgaa	Yes they eat less..try giving her teething toast, they sell it in many stores in the baby food isle.
Z8NQGB3Qaa	my cousin rolled down a flight of stairs when she was in her walker..she was bruised on her head/face and is now in highschool...she's entering pre med so I'm assuming the fall didn't effect her .  But maybe to be safe get it checked out|`|wmOgseCgaa	He will most likely be okay, but you should check with the doctor just in case.|`|pvJsmHtYaa	call the pediatrician - have him checked out by professionals. he could have a fracture or subdermal bleeding and you wouldn't know it!|`|CmGWaGKKaa	I would call the doctors and/or your mother and tell them what happend....I hope everything is alright.

TQScv7Tcaa	I had a c-section five moths ago and a friend had one the same time and neither of us had any burning or stinging sensations and no shivering either. The shivering actually does sound like you may have an infection just get it checked out even if it nothing atleast you will know and won't have to stress about it.|`|zB82F68Waa	it sounds like a infection call your doctor out asap.|`|778EtpaUaa	It's not unusual to get a stinging burning pain after a section, this is because you are bruised on the inside( usually concentrated on one side depending if the surgeon was right/left handed), i had the same problem after my section and it took months to go away. when you are getting up or moving around press the area that burns and hold it while you are getting up/moving. As for the fever you may have a wee infection as you will feel very tired just now and your immune system is playing catch up, but please go to the doctor and get yourself checked out to be on the safe side.|`|d9yCmzx7aa	Go to the doctor? You might have an infection|`|trbNJrJbaa	you need to go to the doctors or contact the hospital to me it sounds like you have a infection inside from when they did the c section, best to get check out hunni x
VxYMPsGqaa	this may not help at all but this is also my first pregnancy but when i first felt my baby move  at 16weeks it was more of a fluttering lightly then every now n then it was alot stonger|`|XqfH76PMaa	It sounded fine.  Most of the time it a flutter or a little bounce but it isn't strong enough for you to, say, put your hand on your belly and acutally feel the kick.  Just give it a little more time.  Good luck!!|`|ziyfB20Iaa	i felt quite strong kicks at 16 weeks... no flutters for this baby just straight out booting!!  every womans body is different and feels things differently.  i had no braxton hicks contractions whatsoever whereas a friend of mine had them steadily from 28 weeks.  just go with your body and enjoy this exciting time!!|`|FVXHcTCAaa	For me the first kick felt like an internal flick.

4LAFWC0daa	That is a sign of pregnancy, yes.|`|FGVpDAYwaa	Yes this is normal...you have to remember that when the ovulation is finished and then goes to bed itself in your uterus...it attaches where it attaches meaning it can go anywhere...maybe it is low or on a nerve...either way it is normal.<br>  <br>  Congratulations and good luck!|`|ZatO70xvaa	yes. It sometimes is bad in the beggining. Because your body is adjusting to the pregnancy. Even though you are not showing yet. Hormones are racing and going crazy for the baby. So you will have alot of dizzy spells and headaches nausea and joint pains. Even bloddy noses.|`|Xbkga2MMaa	Back pain is very normal during pregnancy.|`|lDKYC5leaa	Yes this is normal, i had back pain through my entire pregnancy. It was worse in the first and third trimesters though.|`|EFp24VY9aa	It could have been from standing to long in one spot, I used to get cramps in my legs from standing to long.|`|frVREVcRaa	yes it is very normal because ur carrying more weight thsn normal you are carrying for two so its ok|`|nM4kVavraa	Yes sweetie get ready its just the beginning.|`|4yGGjs7zaa	yes this is very normal! during pregnancy your muscles relax due to the hormones which then causes those pregnancy aches n pains, the down sides to pregnancy|`|dbkQhA2Qaa	That first trimester you will feel very tired....that is a good clue that one is pregnant....the middle trimester is when the energy clicks in and the last trimester is a mixture of both!|`|hqXcMFW0aa	no, not really, as the back pain associated with pregnancy is usually caused from the carriage of the body but it is possible that you are cramping (do you have back pain when on your period?) so I would check with a doctor.  God Bless you.|`|XqfH76PMaa	It is perfectly normal.  Do not worry about it.  You will experience this more and more as you get furter along.|`|6a558170a9d4480a00a299aaa106ba69aa	yes thats normal|`|W5PzrLH8aa	Yes it is

2KWyz1N7aa	You timed everything just right to have sperm available as soon as you ovulated, so your chances are as high as they can be--about 20-25%.|`|bXl12I4Baa	get ready to get merry, you having a baby, congratulation for the new baby,mack sure you train the baby well.good luck.|`|oVxr5B3Eaa	about 24-28%. The rule is that it averages out to an 8% chance each time, its a little higher since you were ovulating.|`|cftFteUQaa	very very high chance that you are pregnant but you will have to wait a week or 2 before you can test..when you do test do it with your first pee of the day as ur hcg levels are higher then and you will get a more accurate result..<br>  <br>  Good Luck!!|`|AmgPhvvcaa	Why even use condoms if you are letting him ejaculate in you???<br>  <br>  Does that make sense?<br>  <br>  Congrats Mom -2-Be<br>  <br>  :)|`|AA10516678	VERY HIGH!!!!!|`|WqeA9UKIaa	quite high as sperm usually lasts 3-5 days on average and up to 7.|`|usoonnK1aa	Your odds are high, good luck.|`|YRRdpjozaa	well it would be a 50/50 chance to become pregnant

I do still have a bit of discharge now but it is not as extreme as it was, if you are still very concerned go to the drs and put your mind at rest but im pretty sure you will be fine. Good luck! X|`|dqSA7j7gaa	As long as it is  milky, white and not cottage cheese like or followed with itching and burning, its normal.

Are you feeling any cramping?|`|4547eab5ec2a01595d1f92cd2bc3c40aaa	Is there any bleeding with the discharge?  If you are real worried about it, just call the nurse at your doctor's office.  That is what they are there for- they will not think you are being paranoid or anything- they want you to have a healthy baby as well.
XbOJvN7Maa	Ma non preoccuparti di come la prenderanno gli altri!...sappi che se tu sei serena e tranquilla anche gli altri lo saranno...quindi sii te stessa e non preoccuparti!|`|hIknKaUFaa	ma scusa hai comprato il reggiseno fluorescente? una seconda scarsa non mi pare così  evidente XD|`|3QQus6Ehaa	Ciao! Abbiamo la stessa età quindi posso capirti! <br>  Non c'è nessun problema secondo me, perche se ti piaci non vedo perche gli altri non dovrebbero! Tu devi cercare soltanto di essere te stessa!

Poi vedi che ti dice! Non credo che sia cosi S****o da lasciarti, se tu dici che sei cambiata nel mondo giusto allora non preoccuparti! Poi l'hai detto anche tu che sei piu ottimista?
