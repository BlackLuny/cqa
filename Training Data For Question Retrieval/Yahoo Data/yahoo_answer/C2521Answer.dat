RWjvcCYoaa	Prior rentals very desirable because rental companies take much better care of their cars than many private owners. The oil is changed regularly, tires are replaced and balanced as soon as they're needed. And every tire change requires a front end alignment.     Hoses are regularly replaced along with all filters. Brakes are constantly being checked. And every service maintenance required by the manufacturer is done on time.    Many years ago, rentals were the cheapest cars made. They were  the bottom of the line models with no options except for an auto trans. The looked cheap, they felt cheap and people drove them into the ground.    But since the 80's rentals are much more reflective of the type of car you own with the same amenities. People drive them easier. And rental companies make sure that every car in their fleet is in its best running condition. They have a lot at stake with their reputation and with liability issues.    So go ahead and buy a prior rental. It's been very well taken care of.|`|U9bQgfY9aa	I bought an ex-rental 2005 Chevy Cavalier last summer for my daughter. The car was in perfect condition. Except of course, I had a 4 wheel alignment done it. But then I get that done on every used car I buy.    She has driven the car clear across the continent and for months at grad school without spending a dime for maintenance other than 3 Mobil One oil changes. Its in a lot better shape than her boufriend's Passat of the same age.    I have no qualms about buying an ex-rental car. And few people actually abuse them. I have rented cars many times and always been careful. Most renters are very careful as it is such a horrific hassle to handle the repairs or damage that people drive carefully to avoid it.|`|YLJXyS1iaa	less desirable because people really abuse rental cars.|`|D6kZzXQeaa	I would recommend looking over the rental car very well. Most rental car companies do change the oil but that is it. They hardly ever keep them long enough to change tires and since they don't actually own them they really don't care. (only one that may not count towards is Enterprise since they own a good amount of their cars.)     And reading everyone else's answers I would have to say that everyone believes that rental car companies actually take great care of the cars.
3MTYGEbWaa	You can't. It is a common scam by people outside the U.S. where they can't be found. eBay has no control over people who falsely claim to use their services.  Here is more about it:  http://www.used-car-advisor.com/car-sell...|`|51d9e39c71aaaed7424c9ac49e9069c5aa	Contact EBay on their web site.|`|379b18fddd29f1b64385008f275bdd61aa	You can report them to their mail service (Yahoo, MSN etc) and to the F.B.I. internet crime division as well as ebay itself. The more information provided the more thorough they can be at tracking these people down and stopping their operations.|`|2ee9ba3f8fa52a8c3bd583c6f12f11b8aa	There are so many of those people, it's really pretty much hopeless, I think.   If people are actually using ebay, there is a way you can report that, but if they are just scamming on craigslist using ebay's name, I don't think ebay customer service has got time to fool with that.    I wouldn't worry about it.  It only takes me 30 seconds to spot them, so I imagine it wouldn't take ebay security people any longer than it takes me.
YRHLMfzDaa	sh mean super handling but i heard alot poeple said prelude kind heavy for 2 door car , i think civic si have potential  to boost high psi|`|addaf7237cf3d32190cfc96546e98709aa	The SH is made from 1999-2001 and all 99-2001 models are SH. 200HP and improved handling. SH=Super Handling.    All 97-98 Models are not SH, or base. 195HP    Both are good for Turbo's. But you should never installa  Turbo Kit onto a car with more than 60,000 miles.  So make sure you get a low mileage Prelude if you want to get a Turbo Kit, which costs $3,000 and adds about 100HP.    Turbo Kits recommend engines less than 60,000 miles. The engine needs to get used to the turbo kit before it gets to old in terms of mileage.|`|AA11606818	SH Preludes can be more problematic due to the ATTS system and all the additional sensors used for the ATTS.   However, if you find a well-maintained SH, you'd be crazy not to buy it over a base model.      Below are some features unique to the SH:    Body colored side-skirts and rear bumper lip  Rear wing spoiler came standard  There rear deck does NOT have a 3rd brake light  Different wheels than the base model   Courtesy lights on the lower part of the interior door panels  Leather wrapped shift-knob    Only available in 5 speed manual transmission     There are a few other minor differences but those are the most notable.    If you want to turbo, the ONLY option is to go with the base model.  The ATTS unit was not designed for high horsepower applications.|`|Ph3mcuPeaa	Hay man if you want a car with turbo buy a car with one don't add it ... i had two friends mess up there cars adding turbos for no reason|`|AA10161609	The above poster 'C7S' is COMPLETELY wrong about nearly everything said.      The 5th generation BB6 prelude was produced from 97-2001.  The SH and base model Preludes were both produced every year from 97-01.    The 1997/98 Preludes were rated at 195hp while the 99-01 models were rated at 200HP.  This was due to an improved exhaust manifold design on the 99-01Preludes.      So, if you're looking to heavily modify your car, a SH is not for you.  There are far fewer parts available for the SH Model prelude and as I mentioned above, the ATTS unit cannot handle high-horsepower applications.|`|B3A0UO98aa	The guy above me is right about all the specs. I love my 5th gen prelude (98 base model) but i would not ever turbo it. The automatic transmission is problematic, i know many owners (in fact, im in 2 prelude owners clubs) who have had to replace it, including a person who is on the 3rd transmission already in less than 100,000 miles. Mine went out at 110,000 and it set me back a good $3k. Let me tell you, loosing your months salary to get your car up and running again doesn't exactly put a smile on your face. I woulda sold the car right after had it been any other car, but i love my car. It is a FWD, which to me - is the biggest down fall. For high horespower cars, FWD is a no-no. If you wanna go turbo do it on a RWD so you can actually take advantage of that power, FWD + turbo = silly. With the SH ATTS will go haywire once you get above 250hp, which, trust me, you do not want to deal with. I'm actually looking into another car, a Nissan 300ZX with the factory twin turbo. Its RWD from the factory as well - looking into upgrading the turbos and all the other good stuff and hoping to push at least 400WHP....but im keeping the Prelude =]
Px9qOkDuaa	Cummins. better reputation.  the 6.0 pwr stroke is too new and having lots of problems. I'de recommend an older 7.3 pwr stroke ford motor, they were made by international, and were and are still very strong and reliable. but if you must have brand new. go to cummins. and thats just the motor. the truck itself tends to have lotts of problems. overall, I'de say go ford. even with the new 6.0. but you didnt ask that. you asked about motor only. right? want the perfect truck? get an older ford,and put a cummins 12 valve in it. then your getting the best of all the best parts. P.S. you'll notice I didnt even bring up chevy's or Duramax. because they are absolutely horrible horrible trucks all around. Have been for 10 + years. DDon't believe me? drive around andolook at what 98% of all TOW TRUCKS  are.. FORDS!!!!!! my personal truck----- 99 F-550 7.3 diesel 6 speed manual. It is a n absolute power house. 400,000 miles and i am NOT easy on it. just fantastic maintenance. and it weighs 12,500 lbs. dry. hope this helps.|`|MacOTyMnaa	the 6.0 power stroke sucks ford had the 7.3 but did away with it. that thing could pull a house down. for todays diesel the duramax will be stronger than the cummins, but all with some performance chips can be pretty stout. don't leave out ford's 6.4 twin turbo which i've heard is very strong. I would check out the 6.6 duramax and the 6.4 ford. If you could find one with low miles i'd get 7.3 A friend had one and he went well over 300000 miles with the engine still in good shape.
3t5VZ6zDaa	Everybody knows that the Cummins is the best. Best mileage, reliablility, power, longevity, sturdiness, and have you seen the connecting rods for all of them? Cummins is twice as big. dont buy any diesel with a dpf or you will regret it.|`|CoCn3GbOaa	6.6L Duramax Turbo Diesel
33C9CoCsaa	Well, you haven't really given me any useful information, but here's my advice from what I can understand:    If everything is running properly at the moment, keep the car! This is because these types of cars are built to last for up to 250,000 miles. Even if your engine gives up once in a while, just fix it! It won't cost you that much. Your car will most likely not give out for another 1-2 years.    Hope I helped  -Lardman|`|8zVxYkluaa	You mean Camaro?    What year?  What motor?

The 70's cars had some difficulty with excessive cam wear, but a well-cared-for camaro can go for a long time with only occasional work. Best part is - you can get replacement parts very easily, since the f-body was and is so popular.     Biggest thing is - if you're going to buy one - is check for poorly repaired damage (if in an accident), rust at the base of the rear window on coupes, and rust on the underside of the tail, in the base of the quarter panels, trunk, under the carpet particularly on the driver's side and bottom of the front fenders. Avoid at all costs Camaros that exhibit rust on the rear frame rails and rail extensions - unless you have skills or know somebody, this type of damage is a tough fix.     Also, note how the door lines up when it closes - an even gap is generally a good sign that it's doing pretty well.     On the older Camaros, you'll tend to see a puff of smoke on start up from worn valve guides/seals - that's not too bad, but avoid a "smoker" - one that puts out a constant smoke - unless you're willing to invest some time tuning, or possibly replacing the rings. Look for a well-maintained engine, and good maintenance receipts, if available.|`|a577675893457f8844900f790e549222aa	Do you know if the owner has kept up with it? I have an '89 Caprice Classic with 500,000 plus miles on it and it's still going strong but I've have kept up with oil changes and basic engine maintenance. You should have the car checked out by a mechanic you trust.

AA12338485	You can use your GPS as a speedometer but you have to understand its limitations.    First, a little background on how most consumer GPS receivers take measurements and compute speed (I won't go into the technical details)...  GPS receivers take measurements every second to compute your position.  In order to compute velocity (i.e. speed), it'll need two positions and then difference those positions over time.  So you'll need two position solutions to get velocity.    Now having said that, a lot can happen in that 1-second interval (e.g. twisty roads, quick stop/acceleration).  So GPS works best as a speedometer when you are going in a straight line at a constant speed.  Any other situation will have some lag and may take some time (on the order of seconds) to catch up.|`|6loH10bVaa	When My speedometer was out i just used the RPM's or I just followed the flow of the traffic.

cECMUYcGaa	You aren't going slow enough to downshift. When you force it into first, you're probably hearing the gears speed up to try and catch up with you (they move slower at higher gears therefore lower rpms), and once you let go of the clutch and the gears come together, that's when you get the jerking.    That's just what happens on my Jeep if I try to shift to first before coming to a near stop.

aKirAFKdaa	Love my VFR but it is my 14th bike.  In my opinion way too top heavy for a beginner, not easy to handle at low speed for a beginner and any wreck will cost you big bucks even if you lay it down at a standstill, way too powerful for a beginner, and when all the valves kick in it really develops bad intentions for those who don't have the muscle memory to react immediately without thinking when the road starts giving you curve balls, if you are planning to put a governor on it...why bother, just get the bike you should be riding in the first place.    Hear me or apply for your own Darwin award.  You are going to get guys on here bragging that their first bike was a liter bike and it was no problem.  But you are not going to hear from the squid I saw piled up on an easy corner last summer, the dead guys aren't on y answers and the guys who scared themselves away from motorcycles are probably avoiding the subject.

f7bcc960cd2e00baa34eee0e5a77df9aaa	Do not settle. I am not sure on the wording, but there is a way for them to continue paying your injuries off, for a long time. I took a settlement on my accident, and I wish that I had gotten more, or not taken a settlement because of my neck pain. The only reason for the settlement is so they do not have to continue paying for you to go to the doctor. Figure out how much it will cost to visit the doctor once a week for a year, and then I would multiply that by 5 years or so... You are going to have to have lots of visits since it is your back. You want the most money possible for the mere fact that you need to pay for a doctor. I went through physical therapy, this might be an option for you as well... it doesn't matter that you stopped for a while, I went for a couple of months, got better, stopped going, went back for a couple of months.... 3 different times. And again, 8 years later I still have a build up on one side of my neck, and pain in that area.|`|6xyeYjkkaa	Get you a good personal injury lawyer.|`|7L0zp7O6aa	If you haven't been seeing a doctor, you don't have much of a case and will have to settle for what the insurance company gave you.
kNJbZeCgaa	the 86 chevy silverado is a classic, and will look great with a 6/4 drop.  Here is part of the problem, you must re-use some existing parts, which by default, are over 20 years old, so first, you must make sure that your existing parts can be reused.  Then, you have to realize that while it might cost more to have an experienced shop to install your kit, it will be better in the long run, as it will insure that the pickup will operate correctly-nothing is worse than a poorly installed lowering kit, it can ruin your ride in a hurry.  Be especially careful with the notching of the frame, this requires welding up a brace to make up for the removed material, get a certified welder to do this correctly, and do not be surprised if you need to remove the bed to do it correctly...good luck, I like them candy apple red, with weld racing wheels, and bfg drag radial on the back...|`|7HDWtqhOaa	If you don't have DJM suspension parts I would ask them about your kit, talk to Mike Rose he will let you know if your kit is good or bad. But DJM has the best lowering kits.  And make sure if your truck does need to be c-notched that you get a good shop to do it. Done wrong the frame will buckle  The job usually takes 12 hrs with a c notch  Good Luck|`|Q1S1ufHbaa	I'd say 1000 for it to be done and 1800 for it to be done right.

5295ce0578e5f91d2c73b820d4289eceaa	Sounds like it is a 2 ohm DVC (dual voice coil) sub. With a 2 ohm DVC sub you only have two wiring options, 1 ohm or 4 ohm. If you need a 2 ohm load you have to use a 4 ohm DVC sub or two 2 ohm DVC subs. You cannot get a 2 ohm load from a single 2 ohm DVC sub unless you only use one coil which is not a good idea and it would only handle half it's rated power.

If you don't care if the engine breaks down, then go ahead and just add water.  In the long run, it's not good.    Running your car without coolant would be like sending your child out in the cold without a coat.  It won't kill them right away, but they will die at a young age.|`|WwXrTQgaaa	If it gets too cold, it could freeze.    As far as hot weather, it'll actually stay cooler with straight water. Most people are very misled about this. The only reason people don't use straight water (knowledgable people) is because it has no lubricity to protect the water pump, has water tension and corrodes quickly. You CAN use water, but when you do get this fixed, make sure you run one of those flushing systems through it afterwards to flush out all the corrosion that will build up while you're using straight water.    A middle-of-the-road solution would be to use DISTILLED water. It has all the chemicals removed and will corrode much, much slower. But that costs more as well.    Bottom line, yes it can be done but corrision will need to be addressed eventually.|`|lzjtINvCaa	If you live where the Temperature gets below freezing this could harm the engine, antifreeze has a lubrication that  is a rust inhibitor as well as a lubricant,if you use straight water your cooling system is in danger of growing a bacteria which will clog up system and cause engine to over heat  which could lead to a cracked manifold/cracked head/head gasket, you might be able to get away with splitting a gallon of anti freeze  50/50 with water to cut back on cost.|`|Yq2CUhtYaa	Coolant is expensive?    It's like $8 for a gallon. That's not much at all.    And yes, you can cause all kinds of problems with just water in it.    Fix the leak. It's not that expensive.|`|repO76qoaa	If you add only water, the range of effectiveness of the coolant is reduced on the high end and the low end. This means that it will be more proned to over heat and freeze.     Where is the leak coming from? If it's a hose, you can change that yourself with a few tools. If the leak is in the engine or radiator, that is more work. Have you tried any leak stopper additives sold at local auto parts stores?|`|N6zo8Zo3aa	take it to a shop and have a pressure test on the cooling system then refill the radiator with antifreeze. antifreeze not only keeps your car from freezing but it also keeps it from boiling over.
3qGdN6xMaa	Briggs and stratton is fairly easy engine to just grab a socket wrench and take it apart.  Once you have the carb, manifold and head off, you can see inside the engine to see if anything really looks wrong.  If piston is cracked or valves are cracked or burned you may see pieces that you need to replace before you put it back together.  These are small light engines that are easy to learn how to work on engines.    Good luck, probably either you find out nothing is badly messed up and put it back together and ensure all the bearings have oil, or else you learn why it doesn't work and if it is a blown out motor you learn something about how and why it is blown and maybe learn something about how to treat the motor better next time.
AA12095978	according to my book, there is no radiator fan swtich for an 01 malibu with 3.1.  There is a radiator fan relay, coolant temp sensor and temperature sensor.  the temp sensor is what the dashbaord guage reads.  the coolant temp sensor is what the car computer reads, and uses to turn on the electric fan(s).  the fan relay gives power to the fans.    usually if you had a seperate radiator fan switch, it would be screwed into the radiator itself.  the cooland temp sensor and temperature switch will be on the thermostat housing and in the intake manifold, usually close to each other.
XpKY04Tnaa	These people have no idea what there talking about.   1. Octane rating are just that. Quality of the gasoline is the same.   2. Octane is added to gasoline to retard ignition inside the cylinder to allow for greater compression. Greater compression leads to more horsepower and torque.  3. You can use all of the regular octane gas you want as long as one thing doesn't happen. That pinging sound coming from your engine. Often happens during acceleration. This is the gas detonating before the compensation cycle is complete.  This can be bad. It's happened all the time in the 1980's cars.   4. Unless you need the horsepower then you don't need the high octane. Your cars ignition computer will automatically adjust your cars timing to match the octane level in the gas. Read your owners manual.|`|Yq2CUhtYaa	No, it's not bad.    And no, it's not that much more expensive.    Here, watch.    Say you fill up 10 gallons, each time you fill up.    You fill up twice in a month.    Per month, you save $6-7, by not using premium, and using normal octane instead.    At the end of the year, you've saved a whopping 70-80$.    That's all.    But, by using a lower octane, your engine can start pinging, or detonating. Which causes damages.    Upwards of $1000-1500 to fix.    So, is that 70-80 worth it?    Edit: This isn't rude, this is the simple facts. There's no sarcasm, or ill intent. You're simply not saving anything by switching to lower octane.|`|AA12095978	doesn't matter if you have different grades of gas.. what do you think 89 octane is?  a blend of 87 and 91.    do this.. next time you need gas, fill the tank half way with mid grade.  If you don't notice any pinging or knocking when you climb up steep hills, then you're good.  run 89 for another tank.    then do the same for 87.  if you're good, then use it.  However,if you go into the hills or going on a trip to somewhere where there are lots of hills, I would put the higher octane gas back in.  the knock sensors only can retard timing so far.|`|hfyPGF8Xaa	yes if it says premium then put premium in it.  the compression ratio of the 3.5 liter heads is stupidly high like 10.7 to 1 on these cars. so when you run regular in them they knock, ping and generally get horrible gas mileage, not to mention burn up your plugs and stop up your catalytic converter.  put the premium in it now and save your money in the future on repairs.|`|j5kj3Bxtaa	It will adjust the timing for lower grades of gas, but it's not good for long term viability of your engine and will give you WORSE fuel economy. The price difference is only like $4 on a fill up so it's not like it's a huge deal anyways. If you can't afford that you shouldn't have bought that car because you cannot afford it either.|`|SBk7CF4maa	definitely do not listen to post number 2  if you use a lower than recommended fuel grade you will get pinging of the engine...definitely not good. maybe in a pinch it is ok to use a lesser grade but not as a full time solution

64d33b21525c267f9af9181ffa2d6014aa	Horsepower vs. torque is one of the most misunderstood concepts in the automotive world.  Torque is the force that causes something to rotate and horsepower is the rate at which torque can be applied over a given distance.  Horsepower is merely a measure of the rate of torque production, not some magical force.      For example a giant diesel engine in a container ship may produce 1 million lb/ft. of torque but only 20,000 h.p.  Why?  because the engine only turns 300 r.p.m.  Conversely a motorcycle engine may produce 150 h.p. but only 75 lb/ft. torque but it produces it's maximum torque at 10,000 r.p.m.  Horsepower is a number in an equation, nothing more.  It's more a matter of what torque curve would work best for a given application.|`|Ld7dOtGUaa	Quickness = torque    (0-60 times)  Top speed = horse power|`|5kVyZyGGaa	which is better? torque is better but you have to have horsepower too.|`|62cd15e7dc30e5e43a4f70a570fbd353aa	Horse power sells engines,however torque wins races.  TORQUE is KING!!!!|`|ZgmuayXnaa	If your pulling, you need torque to get the load started, and more torque for heavier loads for pulling, if you want top speed, then you need the horses|`|addaf7237cf3d32190cfc96546e98709aa	If you are into acceleration=Torque.    If you are into speed=HP.    A car with 50HP and 200 torque could go from 0-60mph in 5 seconds, but only have a top speed of 85mph.    A car with 200HP and 50 torque could go from 0-60mph in 15 seconds and have a top speed of 140mph.|`|BUKgRWT8aa	Horsepower. Torque is better for towing|`|e19c8a127d0ee4643a8d9f0d75da1785aa	You need both.  You basically want the numbers of horsepower and torque to be equal.  Torque gets you off the line and horsepower keeps you going once you get up to speed.|`|cpQU51teaa	well torque is the thing that makes the wheels spinning, so torque is more important. horsepower only indicates how good engine is at burning fuel.|`|uLEpOpSMaa	It depends on what you use the car for, but typically both are important.  I like engines that have more torque then horsepower because they seem better balanced.  Some performance Honda motors make almost twice as much horsepower and torque.  They need to rev a lot to make power.
gOQ5mZ7Xaa	NOS is supposed to be a temporary thing to gain more power anyway. This is the way I see it:    Turbo  --------  Pros: Everlasting power, turbo whine sounds the shiz    Cons: Most turbos get turbo lag in the lower RPM ranges which means you don't get as much power until you get near redline.    NOS  -------  Pros: Cheap power; you can gain up to 100 more horsepower instantly just at the press of a button.    Cons: Needs to be refilled after use, so it isn't as everlasting as a turbocharger's power, get carried away with it and you'll blow your engine quite easily.    Overall I'd rather get a supercharger. Power over all the rev range, and you don't get lag like you would with a turbo.|`|UufepGETaa	i choose turbo cuz nos can kill your car and a supercharger does have power in all the power band but i can just turn up the boost with the flip of a swicth and kill the supercharged car cuz with a supercharger you would have to change the pulley|`|NHS38tNlaa	how about both

If you want a project car that you can mod to be your own, go with the Mustang.|`|IIa4efh5aa	The Challenger is a larger car than the Mustang and should offer a better ride. Mustang canters through the quarter mile in15 seconds @90, while the challenger takes 16.1 seconds @88.1.

Makes you think doesn't it?|`|wFJ7S5Bzaa	Around where I live, most girls think Mustangs and other flashy cars are tacky and shows that the guy is compensating for a small man-parts.  The girls by where I live love pick-up trucks. A truck says a lot better things about a guy's personality than a snazzy car does. A truck is the symbol of a hard-working, committed guy that isn't afraid to roll up his sleeves. A car just shows that a guy likes to show off how fast he can drive and how pretty his car is.  Also, the bench seat of a truck is a lot more comfortable to get laid in than a car, especially a 'Stang with bucket seats lol. The bed of a truck makes for a nice romantic night under the stars as well.  Do yourself a big favor, trade your Mustang in for a F250 Superduty 5.4 with the off-road package and dual exhaust, F250 6.0 Powerstroke or a Dodge Ram 2500 with the Cummins V8. Girls love that purr.|`|MQPJ2UaGaa	It's not so much that it is the car it is that some cars say MONEY.|`|K1fOfJ92aa	Can I borrow your Car?|`|75IesbZOaa	They prob think you have alot of money .

Gn0nR2S1aa	Is the leak coming from the area of the parts you replaced? Clamps or bolts could be loose or not on properly.|`|HQ4PsETWaa	Is it leaking out of the car?  If so then you have a leak, the radiator could be worn out or like you said a clamp could be lose.  If it is not leaking out of the car, keep adding coolant, the motor holds a lot of it.|`|vW5ntPHkaa	I have a 94 Galant, and I am buying new hose clamps for the exact same reason.  I'd say turn it on, let it warm up and then check it.  Or, if you're concerned, your local Autozone has a pressure tester you can get as a loaner tool, and then you can find exactly where the leak is.
78e4081014f25f2f27e0302c168080c5aa	My vote is for the Cummins.  Working for a Ford/ Chrysler dealership and comparing the service history between the two, I have to recommend the Cummins.  The 6.0 liter ruined Ford's diesel sales....period.  Not gonna recommend a 6 liter, Ford should produce their own engine, this piece of crap from International should have never been produced.  To go from the 7.3 which was a dependable workhorse, to the 6.0 liter was a disgrace.  The first two we got from the factory were bought back, one didn't even make it off of the car carrier, the other went back to Ford after the customer towed it in to us 4 times in the first month of ownership.  The new 6.4 is just as awful, even though it was supposedly tested extensively, I see them in the shop week, after week, after week.  Definately recommend a Cummins, and recommend Ford find another diesel engine supplier.|`|S8Qpiabdaa	CUMMINS IS ACTUALLY THE BETTER BUT FORD OWNS THE CUMMINS SO THE POWER STROKE AIN'T FAR BEHIND. I DON'T REALLY LIKE THE DURAMAX!|`|OKzU1TJraa	Cummins.|`|8e1fdf4cefa581a57ec81fd9d7c68728aa	It depends on the year. By 2005, the Powerstroke's problems have been corrected and they have proven to be reliable. However, the 6.0L's image had been tarnished at that point so they decided to move to the 6.4L, which hasn't been the greatest either. Overall, I'd say you can't go wrong with a 5.9L Cummins. They have proven themselves year after year after year. The Duramax is also good, but they aren't built as strongly as a Cummins. The D-Max and P-stroke both have 250,000 mile overhaul intervals while the Cummins has a 350,000 mile overhaul interval. Perhaps the biggest problem with the D-Max is that the GM truck itself is the weakest, especially the front end. Don't get me wrong, the GM truck makes a good driver due to the IFS, but it won't hold up to the abuse that a Ford or Dodge solid axle front end will take. I've seen more Duramax powered trucks blow front axle shafts at Silver Lake than every other other truck combined. Combining big torque and big tires is really hard on a truck.    PS: Ford is supposedly building their own diesel for 2011, I heard it will make over 700lb-ft!

ehJ45unqaa	If you hear it trying to start the starter is good, if not it's the starter. As for the Alternator, if you charged the battery, and it doesn't start it's the starter, the alternator only charges the battery when the engine is running.|`|FsT54qh1aa	It is likely the alternator, or corrosion so bad on the battery terminals that the alternator can't charge the battery properly The battery may be on the way out too. When you jump the battery, does it start and then die as soon as the jump clamps are removed? If it won't jump at all, it may be corrosion or a battery that will no longer hold a charge. The alternator is on top of the engine for the available engines in that Lumina. It looks like a small football helmet with slits it in.     It is likely not the starter as this has nothing to do with a car dying on the freeway like that.
N4IGdJXwaa	Wow, I really doubted that they would fit, but they do!  Assuming you have Disk Brakes on your Civic, the bearings for the rear will work if...  Does the Integra Have ABS? If it does than the rear hub will fit the Civic if the Civic Has Disk Brakes and ABS.  If the Integra does not have ABS, than the bearings will be interchangeable if the Civic also does not have ABS.  There is a chance, although small, that the Integra ABS wheel bearings will fit a Civic without ABS.  If you need new wheel bearings, I suggest http://mibearings.com   They have USA made bearings at very good prices.  Good Luck!
d9ECb7N8aa	You need to change the axle ratio in the axle that you have.    No they will not swap, the axles have different load ratings, brake sizing, ect.    The ring and pinion gears will need to swapped out of the axle for a different ratio. A numerically lower number is a taller gear (what you are looking for). So a 3.73 is taller than a 4.10 (3.73 turns of the driveshaft per 1 revolution of the tire).|`|c22cd3bc80b769e97ac9ae2bc60d368eaa	What you really want to do is find different rear end gears for the F250.  I don't recall what different ratios options were available from Ford in '99.  Also, what engine?  First, check the Parts Dept at your local Ford dealer.  Secondly, research aftermarket suppliers.  You'll likely have to replace the speedometer gear too.  I wouldn't consider replacing with a F150 rear end.  Totally different trucks (or do you have the "light duty" F250?).  Whole different story.|`|w3EwRNYQaa	depend's on the year, call a ford dealer,ask for part's and ask they will know for sure.|`|S8Qpiabdaa	NO SIR!!! GEARS INSIDE ARE DIFFERENT.

fe896c388193778daefac15405693e34aa	why the hell would you want to do that? Think about it realistically. The K20 with all necessary parts and install cost will be between $10,000-$12,000. Now your GSR puts out 150-155 whp in stock form, and a K20 puts out 170-180 whp in stock form. So basically you are paying $12,000 for an amount of HP a good set of cams, exhaust, header, and cold air intake will give your motor and that will cost about $2,500. Not to mention you can pull the GSR, build it, then turbo it with a quality kit like Peakboost, or Full-Race and have 400+ whp all still for LESS than the K20 swap.|`|YiUtOWlYaa	k20 racer!!!!!!!!!!|`|AA11606818	K20A2 with hasport mounts and axles.|`|G1Lujz8aaa	any with the right motor mount kit, fuel setup and wiring k20a.org is your friend.|`|edIUAbCxaa	all k series engines would fit into a gsr. any motor would fit any car, that is if you got the $$$|`|YN9nRZQvaa	all

EWzEgEDPaa	Some odometers cannot be changed. It's called anti-tampering. It is not necessary to correct the odometer to match the old one. You only need the Odometer Disclosure Statement completed if you ever go to sell or trade-in the vehicle to provide to the new owner, etc. This will show there is no attempt to defraud anyone. Go to the DMV website for your state to get the document and review the requirements. Make sure you  1.Document the mileage on the original odometer.  2. Document the mileage on the replacement.  3. Keep the receipt for the one you purchased.  4. Make photocopies of everything so you have an extra record.    When I was at the dealer and we replaced a mechanical one, we affixed an Odometer Sticker to the odometer and noted everything on the repair order. The electronic ones can be pre-set to the original mileage when the dealer places the order.|`|D4GHgDl4aa	I had one replaced a few years ago because it was noisy. The dealer had to send the old one to the factory and a new one came in with the correct mileage.

That is the hardest transition for a motocrosser. There is a big jump in size from an 85 to a 125 and there is really nothing in between except going to a big wheel 85/100/105/150 which really isn't much taller than a standard 85. You need to be about 5'7" to be comfortable on a 125 but could pull it off at 5'5" or so.|`|qkAoxusxaa	not unless you lowered the seat... drastically. i'm 5'6 and i ride a bike of the sme height... and i use my tiptoes... if i what both my feet on the ground... but no you cant ride it... i'd get a suzuki rm 100. its a bit taller, but you can ride it easier.    there is also a ktm 105 sx... im not sure but, it might be a bit more powerful than the 100...      hope i helped...
78e4081014f25f2f27e0302c168080c5aa	You do not have 100,000 mile warranty unless you purchased an extended warranty when you purchased the car in 2003, this year model was only 3yr, 36,000 miles.  BUT, Brake Masters is ripping you OFF!!!  You don't need four struts for a front end squeak, no way, no how, they just want your money.  It is either a right front strut bearing plate that is loose, which I have seen before, or a bearing plate that is bad, or a rubber spring insulator that is worn through.  It might not need the struts at all.  There is one more possiblilty to check, the 2003 Focus has extended coverage on the front coil springs to 10 years or 150,000 from the purchase date from Ford, because the front coil springs can fracture, I have seen them break and cause a squeaking noise from the front strut.  The program number from Ford is 03M02.  If the spring is fractured it would be a no cost repair to you from the dealer to replace the spring.  If they said you need all four struts for a squeak in the front, they seen you coming and are ripping you off, I would not go back.  Here is a little info on the broken spring customer satisfaction program.  It may be worth the trip to dealer to check to see if the spring is in fact broken, even if it is not, I guarantee they will not try to sell you all four struts for a front suspension squeak!!    TO: All U.S. Ford and Lincoln Mercury Dealers     SUBJECT: Update: Supplement Announcement   Customer Satisfaction Program 03M02 - Supplement  2:       Certain 2000 - 2003 Model Year Focus Vehicles   Additional Coverage for Front Coil Springs     This program extends the coverage on the front coil springs to 10 years of service or 150,000 miles from the vehicle's warranty start date, whichever occurs first. This coverage will automatically transfer to subsequent owners. If a vehicle already has more than 150,000 miles, this coverage will last until May 31, 2005.       VEHICLES COVERED BY THIS PROGRAM    Certain 2000 through 2003 model year Focus vehicles built at Wayne Assembly Plant from March 5, 1999 through January 13, 2003 and Hermosillo Assembly Plant from May 21, 1999 through April 27, 2003.       REASON FOR THIS SUPPLEMENT    This bulletin is being re-issued to expand the model year coverage of Customer Satisfaction Program 03M02. Coverage within 03M02 is extended to certain 2000 through 2003 model year vehicles.     REASON FOR PROVIDING ADDITIONAL COVERAGE    In some of the affected vehicles, portions of the front coil springs may not have received adequate corrosion protection during the manufacturing process. Inadequate corrosion protection eventually may lead to a fracture of the spring. A spring fracture may result in suspension noise, possibly accompanied by sagging of one side of the vehicle. This is most likely to occur on vehicles operated for extended periods of time in high-corrosion areas of North America. Only a small percentage of the affected vehicles are expected to experience this concern.     SERVICE ACTION    If a front coil spring should fracture, the dealer technician will replace both front coil springs, check front wheel alignment and, if necessary, adjust toe angle at no charge to the owner of the vehicle.|`|e53807be9e34b50fae02ba7c73274c6baa	Not sure what country you are in, but in the USA, Ford does not offer a 100K factory warranty on anything.  You would have to get an extended warranty to cover the vehicle outside of the standard 3 year/36K mile factory warranty.      Even if they did, things like shocks, struts, tires, brakes etc. are not covered.   These are considered 'wear and tear', and are not covered under any factory warranty except BMW.    You still will want to shop around and get a 2nd opinion on the cost of the brakes from an independent shop.|`|39ixfEIraa	Well im not 100% sure but i would guess that they will look at your car and as long as they find that the damage was caused by neglect from the driver (wrecks, hitting curves ect....) than it would probibly cover it....word of advice, dont buy another ford, ive got a mustang, father had a F-150 along with my mother and her BF, and i have a bunch of friends with fords, and alls they have given us was trouble....try toyota if ur looking for something that lasts....but good luck with that and i hope they fix it for u and it doesnt cost u anything...|`|c22cd3bc80b769e97ac9ae2bc60d368eaa	It's a powertrain warranty; covers engine, transmission & transaxle.  Sorry, struts are a normal wear item.  Confirm that with the Service Dept.  Get a quote from you Ford dealer.  I doubt if they'll cost any more & you'll have better assurance it was done correctly.

Regular oil is best.  For the most part stay away from synthetic oils for rotary engines.  Since oil is injected into the combustion chambers you want oil that will burn off as cleanly as possible.

ajnGHNr8aa	sounds like the belt has come off, the reason everything  happened at once is that the belt runs: the alternator (battery,brake lights,dim lights), the water pump (overheating, no heat), power steering pump (no power steering).

The steering hydraulic pump is belt driven. So without the pulley belt for transmission, it can not power the steering system    That same belt also drives the alternator generating electricity to charge the battery, and light up the lights    You most likely need a tow truck, a Vehicle Mechanic    The belt is relatively cheap, it is the other services that cost more

A dui is 2 points on your record for 7 years, huge fines and other penalties - many insurance companies won't even insure people with DUIs.     A WW is on your record for 5 years, is 2 points, but a lot less fines and not all the other extra penalites that come with a DUI (like alcohol school and AA meetings).

XBUeYE41aa	Wisconsin had a few 'salvaged' insurance write off vehicles done without inspection- the sneaky drill was to get duplicate title from last owner before insurance company processed  and straight transfer or have insurance agent/salvage yard give open prior title with the sale of vehicle.  The state would expect the fixer upper to get reinspected- but many car and bike purchasers didn't. A lien-ed title could be paid off to finance company and wreck wouldn't show on title from them if they had it recovered. Illinois had similar- Title would not indicated crash- just repossessed. Most state now required a known wrecked vehicle to be inspected before registration- a title transfer without inspection is for dealers using it for record keeping on parts sales or future rebuilding that would be inspected when ready for road. 'Junk' titles mean parts on non road use - may get sneaky on them

dx5HIXLPaa	Yes there are 2 fuses, both are in the under-hood fuse block.   1 DRL fuse    2 IGN E fuse  both fuses provide power to the DRL relay but the BCM is what controls the ground path.   The BCM needs to see feedback voltage from the light sensor (whether day or night) it also needs to see that the transmission is not in park. Once that criteria has been met the BCM illuminates the DRL.

83b60f2fdd03f49375b7489077add40baa	It's really up to you.  Either way you're not doing anything illegal or unsafe from what you've described.  People's impatience is their tough luck, if they care about it so much, let them take it up with the town/city.  You said it's under construction so it sounds like it's already being addressed.  I wouldn't go trying to make room for them to pass on the right though if you're waiting to turn unless it is permitted in the state you live in and there is sufficient room for people to get by safely, which it sounds like there isn't.  Kudos for having concerns for other people and trying to be courteous, however in this situation I wouldn't worry too much about it, this sounds like a design issue with the road and once the construction is done it'll probably be easier.|`|WO68RZdIaa	When I've been in similar situations & traffic is heavy in both directions- I just go on down the road to an intersection with a turn lane or a shopping plaza on my right that is controlled by a traffic light, where I can easily & safely turn around, then come back so I can turn right into the lot I was originally wanting. Then I usually end up letting a car sitting there trying to turn left go in front of me so I usually get to cross of my one good deed for the day also.    And you say you wait as much as 5 minutes & the next intersection is a mile away- you should still be able to go down, turn around and come back in under 5 minutes & don't tie up any traffic.    You need to turn left & you aren't doing anything illegal by sitting there - it's not your fault the drivers coming the other way are a bunch of inconsiderate slobs & one of them won't stop for the 20-30 seconds it would take to allow you to turn. But as a courtesy to the driver's behind me, I would go down the street & turn around personally.|`|LOAg9w1Iaa	i hate those street that has no turning(middle) lane. ur the same like me. but i usually turn at the next intersection and come back or i reroute my direction so i end up on the other side.|`|uomYVsiLaa	I totally agree with your friend your nuts the hell with the morons blowing their horns cause they are to impatient to wait a extra minute for you to take a left,What you can do is wait on the yellow line to make your left so those behind you can possible go around or you can make a left at the next light and then head back up the road to the video store that's now on your right  if your that concerned of the other drivers behind you.
5295ce0578e5f91d2c73b820d4289eceaa	For that kind of power you WILL need to upgrade your alternator unless you want to replace the stock one every 6-8 months. You will also need to upgrade the Big 3 wiring. If you do this you may not even need an extra battery which would cost you just as much as the upgrades anyway.

Cold water would make it unconcious in a matter of minutes, hours. Even if water is warm, cats have to keep moving to stay afloat and I doubt if any cat could do that for any length of time.  I know they have life preservers for dogs but don't know if they have them for cats. Maybe a small dog PFD might work or a leash, at least.  I love animals and have taken dogs on board but never a cat although I know cruisers that do have them on their sailboats. One keeps a big fish net handy ("Just in case!").

fl60KL8oaa	Been riding since 1964, have fallen down a few times, have never crashed.  Nothing has ever ran into my bike, my bike has never ran into anything.  Crashing is not inevitable.    Statistically, meaning everyone lumped together no matter how stupid or crazy they ride:    On a per mile basis a motorcyclist is a little over three times as likely to be involved in a accident than a car driver.  But that does include the incompetent, the reckless, and the drunks. The Hurt Study did find a high correlation between accident involvement and 1: being a new rider, 2: being on a new bike, 3: speeding, 4: under the influence of alcohol.    The first two you cannot avoid, but you can take extra care in your first year of riding.  Avoid the second two and you odds of getting in an accident are considerably reduced.    Once involved in a accident, in a cage you have a 50-50 chance of zero injuries.  On a bike it is a near certainty of being hurt, just a question of how bad.    Likely?  Not really.   In a cage, a reportable accident every 150,000 miles, on average.  On a bike, a reportable accident every 50,000 miles, on average.  Ride/drive defensively and your chance of being involved in a accident will be far below average.|`|AA12076385	In 2004 there were 5,700,000 registered motorcycles in the U.S. and 4,008 fatal accidents.    Can accidents happen? Definitely.  Can they be fatal? Defiantly.  Will you be in an accident? Maybe.  Will you die from the accident? Not likely.    Where the guy with the 70% "fact" found it is a mystery to me. I would guess many last payments are not made because the rider traded up while still having payments in the current bike.|`|GsqQ4UTnaa	Take a MSF course, statistically riders who take that course are 60% less likely to be in an accident in their first year of riding. Motorcycle accidents are common but as long as you are geared up in leather or other durable gear you should come out more or less ok. When you decide to get on a motorcycle you are accepting the risk that death or serious injury may occur. Anyone else who tells you otherwise is lying to you. Personally, I take that risk and the day I do fall I will be fully geared as I am every time I ride.     4yrs riding  no accidents  no tickets  several close calls|`|AA10720479	I've been riding for 8 yrs, and 1 dump on wet pavement, but no crashes. You need to ride defensively, and expect the person that's sitting on the side road,  will pull out in front of you. You must always be ready, and never be daydreaming. Riding is fun for me, and I love it. Don't let the what ifs get in the way of having fun.|`|YupMCYHlaa	A lot of motorcycle riders get upset when you ask a question like this. 8^)    Motorcycles are more dangerous than cars, so you have to be more careful.  1/2 of all motorcycle accidents (and about 1/2 of fatalities) happen to riders in their first year of riding.  But that shouldn't scare you.  A lot of those accidents, and deaths, are from people doing really stupid things.  Young guys suffering from 'testosterone poisoning' who buy bigger bikes than they can handle, and then ride like space cadets going warp five.  I see them all the time.    I'll give you the benefit of the doubt and assume you're grown-up enough to handle a bike wisely.  The fact that you're thinking about a Ninja 250 to start out on, and not a Hayabusa, speaks well of you. 8^)    If you ride safely, then the biggest danger for bikers is stupid people in cars.  Often they don't see you. Someone will back out of a driveway right in front of you, or they're coming the other way and make a left turn right across your lane.  In court they will say 'I didn't see him!' and that's true, but it's because they didn't LOOK!  Often you'll be beside someone on the freeway, he will look over in your lane.  He will look RIGHT AT YOU, and then pull into your lane.  Because he's looking for another car and your bike doesn't register on his consciousness.    So a big part of keeping safe on a bike in traffic is keeping out of the way of the cars.  This isn't has hard as it sounds, you just look ahead and think what people might do.  You stay out of cars' blind spots, and don't continuously ride beside a car on the freeway.    Other than that, wear a helmet and gloves and a good abrasion-resistant jacket, take it easy, hope for the best.  Most bikers have had one or two minor accidents, but if you are just moderately cautious your chances of getting killed or really seriously injured are fairly low.|`|xJgILr5faa	Get a license and on it make sure you get the little stamp that very important DONER the chance of getting in a accident are small but the faster you go the chances raise against you ,believe me other people need you badly|`|WXLqZV3gaa	that last guy that said that stuff bout people that buy new neva finish the last payment crap i brought my mbike brand new took 3 years to pay off and i drove hard everywere 170kmh but yer i only had 2 accedents and dat wasnt the speed that was bald tire and rain lol but if u know how to drive then u wont have 1 if u take a corse then u will learn how to stop accedents|`|1ca078fb6ac9d1741007da931ca6cd16aa	No, they don't happen a lot.  When they do happen, you don't die (most times).|`|yaq7oaH6aa	You don't even get on a bike without accepting the   possibility that you will fall off sooner or later.  What do you think leathers and helmets are all about?

Everyone who buys a motorcycle will get in a crash at 1 point in time.. No madder they want to believe it or not. Dieing is a possibility, Alot of crashes are caused by motorcyclist but a great deal of them are also caused by drivers who are unaware of the cyclist and run them off the road or crash into them. Yes when you buy a motorcycle bad things can happen and i guarantee they will. Just wear the proper gear and be very aware of what your doing and youll be fine    Fun fact, 70% of people who buy a motorcycle new don't live to make the last payment on it|`|094aeb51fddd6738244640604bb4b38daa	It happens to most but some luck out. I have had 3 crashes.  Could you die? Absolutely possible.|`|fFrdimDBaa	Don't listen to some of these screwball doom and gloom answers on here. Take your time and learn at a slow pace on back roads until you start to feel more comfortable with the bike. I'm not going to guarantee  you won't be involved in an accident, that would be impossible to do. If you use good judgment and common sense your chances of being involved in one will be greatly diminished. Remember to ALWAYS be on the defensive. Never let your thoughts wonder while riding and anticipate beforehand what could possibly lie ahead. Good luck.

e54245b949fc37ae37c1c0d76403714daa	You still need a permit, no matter what your age.   You may have had one if you took the state written test in school a year or so ago.  Or that just could have been a school test.  If that is all it was, you will need to get a permit and pass the state written test, then schedule a road test.  If it was a state issued test, then you had a permit and it will need to be renewed before you can schedule a driving test.|`|r9s0VyJgaa	So how did you learn to drive without a permit?  You can't get behind the wheel to practice driving without a permit and an adult over the age of 21 in the car with you.     Obtaining a Provisional License for 17- to 20-Year-Olds    To get your provisional license, you first need to obtain your examination permit by:    Studying the driver handbook.  Gathering the required six-point verification.  Taking the material with you to the MVC agency location.  Passing the written and vision tests.  Paying your $10 fee.    Examination Permit Driving Restrictions  Before you can apply for your provisional license, you must have your examination permit for a minimum of six months. Your driving restrictions are the same for a student learner permit (see above section), except that you can't drive from midnight- 5 a.m.    Applying for Your Basic License: Drivers of All Ages    Once you're received your provisional license, the path to obtaining your basic license is roughly the same, no matter how old you are.    Provisional License Restrictions  You must practice unsupervised driving for at least one year with your provisional license.    During this period, you can't use a cell phone or any sort of hand-held device while driving. If you're younger than 21, you can't drive between midnight- 5 a.m. unless you have proper authorization. And, those in this age range may only have household members and up to one person from outside the household in their car while driving.    Getting Your License  After 12 months have passedand you're at least 18 years oldyou may apply for your regular license by:    Locating your provisional license.  Gathering your six-point verification documents.  Going to a MVC agency location.  Paying the $24 fee for your four-year license.    Edit:  In answer to Jan's comment above about 40-year-olds not needing permits -- Yes, even a 40-year-old needs to get an examination permit at least 3 months before taking the road test:|`|8G1eYEsZaa	you should ask your parents to teach you you can get your lisense online|`|MjUentmjaa	i live in california|`|vNu3hl52aa	I think you still need the permit for 6 months|`|3sY0m8HXaa	You should have already had drivers school in your highschool right?  Because of your age you should be able to go right to your license.  They do not make 40 year olds just getting there license get permits first.  Learning permits are for when your learning to drive, so you should already know how to drive.

epkQbZuuaa	Easy. To 12's defiantly Kicker. I guarantee you'll love it. The far best brand. Look into kicker CVR's they are competition style subs and will quake (400 w rms each) so for an amp get a kicker mono amp maybe a 750.1 try a few websites like techronics, or sonix elctronix. very good deals.Oh yeah you can bridge a 1 channel amp for two subs you don't need a 2 channel amp. Don't really consider amping your speakers unless they are loud like over 100 rms each to much distortion.|`|mnvLeA3Gaa	Ok well if your new to this whole car audio deal i would suggest you get a 2 channel amp. But as you can see by this site you can hook a mono for 2 or even for subs.\    http://www.crutchfield.com/learn/learnin...    And you dont need a amp for those 6x9s its just a waste of money, just get subs with good voice coils. personally i like pioneer champinship pro subs. And for a amp cant go wrong with sony, boss, or kenwood. But just make sure that your deck(radio) can handle that because a stock usually can't. Ask for a 50x4 or a 52x4 for that kind of set up. Hope i helped  -Joe|`|A8xcZCIeaa	you can get a mono block amp for your subs or you can go with a 2 channel amp. a decent aftermarket stereo will handle your 6x9s and 6.5s ok but if you want clear sound quality i suggest you get a small amp with built in crossovers that way you don't blow out your small speakers. you should get a 500 or 400 watt amp for your smaller speakers.|`|hFqcN2LFaa	a 2 chan amp 4 the subs and a HPF amp for components

Have someone with jumper cables, hook up to your car. leave the cables on your battery for about 5-minutes, (to get a little charge back into your battery) or charge some with a charger. Start the car, with the car at Idle, remove the negative battery cable from your battery. oh and no jumper cables hooked up.If the engine dyes when the negative cable is removed . The alternator is junk. A cars engine will need only 9-volts to run, anything under that and it will dye. This will see if the alternator has any output at all. p.s. you would have to have a pretty big system in your car to need alternator upgrades. Say a 800 watt system or more. I hope this will steer you in the right direction. Good Luck!!|`|WPYjdsA4aa	your starter is drawing to many amps    you need to replace it|`|Px9qOkDuaa	Battery!!|`|vW5ntPHkaa	I would say you need to make an "on/off" switch for your amps and put a spare battery in the back to run it off of.  If you are pulling too much on the alternator, the loads will essentially not let the battery recharge.  Also, even though your battery can power the 20-30 amps to turn on the lights and what not, it doesn't have enough power to turn the engine over.  Take the battery out and take it to your local Autozone.  They will perform a free test to tell you if it's just a charging problem or if you have a bad battery.  Also.  If you insist on using a system, upgrade to a higher amp alternator.  If your car calls for a 75 and you have a system, switch to a 90 or 100 amp alternator.  This should let your battery recharge even with a system.    Good Luck  DoubleX|`|1LxPcT8Raa	Either battery or you flooded your engine.|`|jYy6dDAZaa	That clicking sound is a starter relay. the good news is that many cars use the same type of relay for other systems,  pull 1 outand try the starter, no click is the right relay, if click replace the 1 pulled out and remove another until found. then put  another relay in the starter relay socket.  Be advised that this will move your problem to some other system like windshield wipers or heat/AC.|`|qibtUmiLaa	From the info you have given, I would say it is a bad starter.|`|H8XpaaPDaa	the clicking sound you hear is the gear on your starter trying to engage with the teeth on the flywheel which is also a big gear that is basically attached to your engine. the flywheel is attached to the crankshaft, so if the flywheel turns, so does the crankshaft, meaning the engine turns. so the starter starts your engine by turning the flywheel. but it isn't getting enough energy from the battery to fully engage and turn the wheel. that's why you hear a clicking sound. the starter gear is trying to turn the flywheel, but it can't so it slips and makes clicking sounds.      so all you have to do is get a new battery. when buying one, make sure the post (battery terminals) are the same on the new battery, and that it will fit your car's battery compartment. also make sure you tighten both battery cables pretty tight or it will cause you problems. also, when working with the battery, make sure you don't complete a circuit with your tools. for example, if you have a socket wrench, don't allow your socket to touch both negative and positive terminals, because then you'll make sparks and you might get shocked. happened to my dad, but he let go of the wrench in time.|`|c654465d22c58a2c5b0af285003b2789aa	Pretty simple, if your battery light was on, you need an alternator.

2ee9ba3f8fa52a8c3bd583c6f12f11b8aa	Choose a couple of universities that are accredited in Mechanical Engineering, and find out the admission requirements now. It wouldn't take more than an hour to find that out, I'd say.    Several things are non-negotiable for any university, and even your guidance counselors will know about them.  You'll have to have chemistry, physics, and triginometry for sure.  I would not advise you to go to engineering school without high school calculus.    Some schools require a year of foreign language as well.    By the way, Automotive engineering is a profession, but it's not something you can major in as an undergrad most places.  You'll have to major in mechanical engineering.

a7a7a0bfe671ddedd1999ac93097444caa	A VERY big question...     Of COURSE it's costly... either converting existing rail-systems or building a new right of way will be costly.  To run at "High" speeds 120 mph+ you have to have clean clear rails, perfect switching and control systems... AND deal with the costs of the whining environmentalists and NIMBY (Not In My Back Yard) folks.    Reliability... a function of the cost: build right and staffed right, it should be quite reliable.    Safe... again a function of cost:  eliminate ALL grade-crossings, top-of-the-line controls, dispatch / switching and communications gear.  BUT nothing EVER has a perfect safety record... One occurred on 3 June 1998, near the village of Eschede in the Celle district of Lower Saxony, Germany. The toll of 101 dead and 88 injured, due to wheel failure.    I'm looking forward to California's Hi-Speed Rail project getting under construction.    EDIT:  I MUST respectfully disagree with Aviophage.  The California High-Speed Rail project is currently being BLOCKED by lawsuits from the CITIES of Menlo Park and Atherton on environmental, noise, and disturbance grounds.    The CHSR project would run on the SAME Right of Way as the CalTrain service that's been there since 1904 (that's ONE HUNDRED and FIVE YEARS !!)... but they are WHINING.

Right now, anything that means higher taxes, isn't going anywhere, and hi-speed rail will mean higher taxes.|`|AA10164889	In real life, environmentalists and "NIMBY folks" strongly favor high speed rail, and anything else that reduces the environmental damage caused by cars and trucks.    A single track rail line can carry about 250 times as much freight and as many passengers as a four-lane highway can carry, and it costs about 200 times as much per mile to build a four-lane highway as it costs to build a single-track rail line.  That gives the railroad a 50,000-to-one advantage financially over a highway.  The environmental advantage is on a similar scale.    So the only people whining are the ones that don't know anything about the environmental movement and think environmentalists are whining!  High speed rail is hugely to the advantage of the environment, and everybody knows it except oil company and car/trucking company executives.  They are the REAL whiners!|`|UmWfQ6u7aa	its definately costly but afvantages are cuts on emission costs as ur not flying to the destination and u get there quicker than standard rail

sCqdisvnaa	What a cool idea!    The newest Z3 was made in 2002, so the newest ones are over 6 years old.    You're going to have a tough time renting any car at 21.  Most major car rental companies are reluctant to rent to anyone under 25.  Looking for something more unusual to rent just compounds your problem.     So you've set yourself a difficult task here.    The closest I could find was Beverly Hills Rentacar in Manhattan.  It looks like they might have a BMW Z4, and they rent to 21 year-olds, too (for an additional fee).    Otherwise, you might try your local BMW dealer Faulkner BMW to see if they have a recommendation, or see if you can negotiate something with a local used car dealer who might have something on the lot.  I looked on cars.com and Mannheim Imports has an M-Roadster.  Times are hard for car dealers right now; maybe they're open to other ways to make some money.    Good luck!|`|OLpWRv2uaa	you will have a hard time renting a Z3, they haven't made them in over 4 years.

d9157449b4296a78a2d93140eae05e2baa	It is difficult to rent a car if you're under 25. However, some rental agencies will allow one to rent a car if you're under 25, providing that you pay an additional daily surcharge. For most agencies/states, the minimum age is 21, while a few may go as low as 18. If you can rent through an employer/group plan, you may also be able to rent.  If he is on official military orders, he can probably rent at 18, but if on leisure travel the usual rules typically apply.    http://www.bnm.com/uage.htm a good site to help you find such agencies and compare the surcharge rates in major cities, as is http://www.autorentalguide.com/car-renta...    Car rental companies at the Newark NJ airport:  http://www.panynj.gov/CommutingTravel/ai...    BTW: if he can fly into JFK or LGA instead of Newark, NY state requires the minimum age for car rentals is 18, so he may have better luck renting from one of those airports instead.|`|b4751c132f82aabe6e11b8e5a37225b5aa	Most rentals require 21|`|LygV4VOOaa	most require to be 21.     however there are a few private owned rental places that will rent to under 21.

Check your relays and switches first, then get the motors checked. Are you in a two or four door? It could easily happen that both of the two door's motors went out, but it's less likely for a four door to loose all of it's motors.|`|0Wvyh3EBaa	hey check the relay under the hood.

b79f8bb3461480aef27179d8e89a194faa	yes i do suggest a new battery but that is only an OPTION.    what you will need is a capacitor. i recommend about 1 farad.    this will protect your charging system from sudden drops of power because of the sub woofer.    the capacitor will act like a second battery that can release energy very quickly without pulling it strait from the battery and not affecting your charging system.|`|mnvLeA3Gaa	well it all depends if you are going to bridge your system.. Bridging your system will take 2 times the amount of juice but bring x8 the bump.

If your really eerie about it just get another battery and hide it under a seat or make a spot for it just for the system.

If you are running more than 1000 watts or so in the amp, you may want to look at beefing up your alternator. You can also get batteries for stereo's that are designed to backup your car battery, and can be wired to your trunk. Go to your car stereo specialist shop. (not besty buy!!)

b79f8bb3461480aef27179d8e89a194faa	You run a wire from the negative terminal of the capacitor to the chassis and for the positive terminal you run a cable from the battery to the terminal and from the terminal to the amp. so that the two positive wires join together on the positive terminal of the cap.    that is one of many ways to do it and is recommended.    here is a pic of how.    http://i279.photobucket.com/albums/kk143...

wqeAeSVYaa	You should consult an attorney.    Your insurance can only cover you for the policy limits that YOU defined when you asked to purchase insurance from your carrier.  There is always the potential that the wronged party can refuse to accept settlement from your insurance, or can request settlement above and beyond your policy limits.    For example, if you have $10,000 in bodily injury coverage.  You hit a pedestrian and he loses his leg in the accident.  Well, I hardly think that you (the pedestrian) would be satisfied with a measly $10,000 for the loss of your leg!  Therefore, you (the pedestrian) would sue the adverse party for $ XXX.    Your insurance company may have offered the limits of your policy, and the person you hit may have asked for more.  Often, a negotiated settlement with a contribution on your part can help resolve a limits claim without litigation.  It depends on if you can afford it.  It depends on if you have any assets.  It is possible that if a claim for damages enters civil litigation, that you could be legally responsible for more than what you could settle for now.  Even if you have no assets, it is possible to have your wages garnished to allow the other party to recoup their losses.|`|51d9e39c71aaaed7424c9ac49e9069c5aa	Consult an attorney. It sounds like your insurance company isn't representing you very well.|`|XgpuXjwtaa	Now why would you think that?  Yes, they try to settle a claim within your policy limits.  However, think about what you are asking.  If everybody had minimal limits, then why in would anybody carry higher limits???????  Because they feel like paying for a higher premium?  I'd like your idea, but it is pretty ignorant.       You are still legally liable for any settlement your policy limit does not cover.      The letter probably suggest you retain counsel of your own.   I suggest you do so unless the insurance adjuster simply sent out a "boilerplate letter" advising you of the potential exposure.|`|j3f8m6REaa	They do, or in your case they are. Need more information but it sounds like your policy limits have been reached and the other party/insurer is demanding more than you have on your policy -- which is perfectly in their right if damages and/or injuries were more than your limits. Remember, when policy limits have been spent you are own your own after wards. You can be sued in court and the judge can attach your wages, your bank account, 401K, your assets, your home, etc, etc, etc. You ALWAYS need to protect yourself by having maximum coverages on your insurance. If you did we wouldn't be here right now, would we?|`|75b701681e36bd3d8587f81aedde23aeaa	LOL... oh lord.  Clearly you are completely misinformed.    Insurance CAN ONLY PROTECT YOU UP TO YOUR LIMITS.    For example.. if you only have $5000 in property damage (aka... damage you cause to other vehicles) .. they can only cover you up to that amount- THATS WHAT YOU PAY FOR!    Why do you think people get Property Damage limits of $100,000?  Do you think they like wasting money?!  Do you think they get higher limits just for fun?!  OF COURSE NOT! they do it to protect themselves.    By getting low limits you choose to not protect yourself fully and you are absolutely responsible for the difference. I love how everyone tries to blame insurance companies.|`|6b241499c91029b41309ed54b7f64ba9aa	The others are correct in stating that the letter is not likely coming from your own insurance...unless both vehicles involved are insured with the same company. If that is the case, the letter would be coming on behalf of the other party's claim.    Either way, it sounds like you are being warned that you did not carry enough coverage to pay for all the damages you caused. This could be a huge issue for you and it may not. The representative assigned to handle your own claim will be doing what they can to protect you. To be exact, they will be attempting to get the other insurance company to sign a release of all claims in exchange for the full amount of your policy limits. You will need to give them permission to disclose your limits to the other carrier to get the ball rolling. This request from your own carrier may possibly be what you are mistaking for your carrier asking you to "contribute" to the amount owed.     Yes you should give your carrier permission to release the limits so they can work to protect you. The other insurance company may want to do an assets check on you to see if you are collectable before agreeing to sign the release and agree to a partial payment of what they are owed. If you do own a home or have considerable savings, it is possible that the other carrier will not agree to accept the compromised amount they are owed. If we're only talking about $1k or less, the other carrier will be more likely to waive their rights to collecting from you. If you are collectible and/or have assets they can discover, it's suggested that you just get it over with and comply with paying the other carrier. They will likely allow you to make payments that work for you.     If you're not collectible, there's a good chance you'll be off the hook. After it's signed, I would ask your carrier for the copy of the release for your records.
lHteMxSCaa	No.     If the car is leased then he doesn't have the title either.    Are you serious?|`|SuZbBnycaa	What ever the names are on the title it will be the same on the registration. The title is kept with the lender or leasor, or if you own the car outright, you keep it in your safety deposit box.    The registration is the same info, but you keep it in your car. When an officer pulls you over, they ask for registration, proof of insurance and drivers license.     The only one that can agree to make changes to title/registration is the one holding it...which in this case is your leasor. I doubt that they will take your dad's name off the title/registration as he's the one with the gold...and you know what they say....he who holds the gold, has the power.    Unless you can show that you've been making all the payments, not your dad...then maybe

But at 16, you should eb ready for the 250f|`|AA11582999	Generally the 125 2 stroke will be faster on track, not as much top end as the 250, but eats it in the low end         get the 125 now|`|R5cUjjvwaa	Hey Dude, to be honest keep your 85 there damn fast enough just abit slower than the 125, so if i were u keep ur mint 85 and wait for the 250 aight? it'll be worth man heaps of grunt, kick , power , boost. yea get the four stroke, i love 2 strokes heaps but the 250 would smoke off the 125. good luck my friend.|`|mnvLeA3Gaa	the 125 2 stroke will be fast but the wait for the 250 will be worth it, cause it will be faster|`|MacOTyMnaa	4 stroke is more dependable but higher priced parts when they go out.  the 2 stroke is cheaper to maintain but known to give more engine problems. If your racing go with whatever feels more comfortable.|`|u0PHhZOSaa	get the 250cc 4 stroke, cause why waste time and money getting a 125 when you can have a 250. you will be getting taller and bigger since your at the age to grow. it will save a s*** load of money, since you would want to do some mods to a 125, but why mod it when your going to be needing a bigger bike in less than 2 years. so if you get the 250 now then you can mod it to what you want and have everything done to it.  + you have a 250cc bike at 15 and probably be the only one in your town with a 250cc bike at your age. good luck    ps switch to a HONDA!!!!|`|qkAoxusxaa	i like 2 strokes... i mean, dont they still race 125 2 strokes, against 250 4 strokes?? the thing is i've never raced, so those are my thoughts...|`|2bqmotqlaa	keep the 85 you wont be able to handle the other bikes you are not big enough, you might have to wait a lot longer to step up to the big bikes  learn to ride a little more and gain a little more muscle weight then step up  cr125 All Day
IIa4efh5aa	On a highboy, the body sits atop the frame rails as it did from the factory, with the fenders removed in an effort to reduce weight. This distinguishes it from a hot rod that has had the frame narrowed so that the body fits over it.
bB5ZPtvvaa	I'll only add that this car with this mileage is already well beyond 1/2 life of encountering major repairs.  Unless you have wrenching skills and toolsets (special) needed you will find shop rates for service  and repair work are at the very top of the scale (1.5 up to 2X that of American or Japanese product) and you will find that costs of replacement parts are exceedingly high.  They are generally nice cars, drive well, and well put together,  overall dependability ratings are good (especially for early 2000's 5 series) but behind Lexus and now Infiniti.|`|u0lRzaXSaa	I have a 97 528 with 180K miles on it. The body is the same as the car you are looking at but the engine is different. The 8 cylinder engines have had more issues than the 6 cylinders. They seem to have unique problems and fixing them cost more because the parts are more expensive and you spend more in labor because they are harder to work on. I am not saying not to get the car but you should go online to sites such as bimmerforums and roadfly to see what some of the problems have been.|`|iQGT4cUAaa	I have a 2000 528i with 160,000 miles. The engine will clearly outlive the electronics.     Some things to check for in this year is the ABS module. When this goes bad you won't have ABS, Traction Control and possibly the Odometer. The "Service Engine Soon" light will go on and in some states, your car won't pass inspection unless it's fixed.    Now we don't know what kind of maintenance was performed in the last couple of years, but you can expect things like the water pump, alternator, oxegen sensors and the RADIATOR wich is made of plastic to possibly go bad. These things are not deal busters but can get expensive to repair.    $7,500 seems a little steep in my book, however I do not know the condition of everything else besides the mileage.    I plan to drive mine until is it not practical.

There is a TSB where you have to have the switch replaced and a flash update to the trans Controller for the transfer case engagement  Good Luck|`|vW5ntPHkaa	Its a vacuum problem, most likely.

e53807be9e34b50fae02ba7c73274c6baa	This is always tough because you don't want to turn your back on family.  On the other hand, his mother doesn't sound like the most responsible person and your husband should not be accountable for her poor decisions.     There are 2 overall factors that a credit report will show a lender.     The first is the debt/income ratio. The higher the number, the worse it is.   If your husband is a co-signer for his mother, the car payment shows up on his credit, and increase your overall debt.     The other part is the credit score, which is measured by whether you pay your bills on time and how much debt that is available and that you have incurred.  The higher the score, the better.     If your husbands mother needs a co-signer, this tells me that she historically doesn't pay her bills on time.  If she continues this trend with the car payment on your husband's credit, then it will negatively impact your credit.     Why not give (or sell at a discount) your mother your current car and you and your husband go get a car for you now?|`|AA11914369	If he cosigns anyones loan, it will count against him as far as his income to debt ratio, because if the primary doesn't make the payment he will have to.  Also his credit will be ruined if mom is a slow or no pay.  You're right to worry about it.  Try to convince him to say no.|`|j3f8m6REaa	The fact that his mother's credit is so lousy tells me that his will soon follow if they do this deal.   Don't do it. Both of you save up for awhile and buy a clean used vehicle. People are desperate to sell cars these days and now is the time to jump.|`|NGGPc6YVaa	I work for a collections agency and your husband will be just as responsible for the loan as your mother in law. if the account goes 30 days past due then there will be a 30 day credit marker placed on his credit as well as her.
Gn0nR2S1aa	It is impossible to drive a car without struts. Did he maybe mean swaybar links that connect to the strut?|`|zOIgzIy4aa	what,s wrong with that guy? is he crazy? you can,t drive a car without struts. the struts is what holds the wheels straight. are you sure he meant struts or shocks?|`|ZGgh4yJ1aa	I don't think you know what you're talking about.|`|hR1wc0taaa	um , no.  but... it IS REAL FUNNY TO SEE!|`|nRvRU6yJaa	Very unsafe!! the spring are what really holds and supports the car however the car will be loose and bounce a lot with out the struts you need to get this fixed and why the struts where removed to replace the brakes make no sense what so ever.|`|51d9e39c71aaaed7424c9ac49e9069c5aa	Can I assume that you mean "shocks" and not "struts?"  Without struts, the vehicle would not be drive-able at all.  Without the shocks, it would be drive-able only if you took an extra dose of motion sickness medication.|`|euXfb9aGaa	The fact that you say " a guy replace" and not "a mechanic"    Implies you had some dumbass do it, because it would be cheap.    NO it is not safe to drive without struts. And it's likely your rotors and pads weren't done properly either.
kijIJbBxaa	I had this same problem - and the entire check engine light thing is a big scheme for mechanics to make money. You shouldn't drive it too much after resetting it or else the light will eventually come back on (if you didn't fix the problem).     Hate to say it, but what worked for me was taking my car to one of those low budget, grease monkey mechanic shops that also do emissions testing/inspections.  They weren't very critical & passed me on the emissions test even though I needed an O2 sensor. I just had the light turned off before I went in. Again, I feel funny even recommending that, but the whole thing is a scam to rip people off to begin with.|`|nRvRU6yJaa	Are we talking about the emissions inspection? A safety inspection it won't mater but it wont pass emissions with a bad cat or lack there of.|`|bvCkplELaa	No, you dont just "re-set" the check engine light and go through emissions, you HAVE to fix the problem and THEN have it reset, otherwise the monitors wont be ready and you will Fail.|`|Gn0nR2S1aa	How did you reset it? If you have a scan tool see if the monitors are ready.
AA11151162	To me tiptronic/manumatic/sportshift/etc is to allow better control of engine rpm for each situation where sometimes the auto logic holds you back.    Down shift anytime before you need power like: coming out of turns, passing, going up a hill, etc.  Other usage is for engine braking where you can downshift while coasting to slow down the car, example on long down hill roads.
3gvq6rcDaa	to me, it sounds like the Cam Am is in better condition than your GS. It also sounds like it's probably worth more overall, so if this guy is agreeing to trade with you square, then i'd say that's a pretty god damn fair trade.|`|51d9e39c71aaaed7424c9ac49e9069c5aa	This is a real subjective question in the sense that it is you who will be trading and you who will be driving it.   So, it's really you who has to decide which vehicle that you like best  since, realistically, neither vehicle is a really high dollar, high demand, numbers matching collector car - the real question again comes back, not to the economics, but to which vehicle you like best.  (I suspect from your question that it's the Cam Am Pontiac.)|`|2ee9ba3f8fa52a8c3bd583c6f12f11b8aa	The Can Am is a 77, actually. It's a cool car, and I like the styling better than a GS, but I imagine the GS is/was a better investment.    If it was me, I would trade if the Can Am was in better shape and complete.

Most hardware stores will cut the key you provide and charge a buck or two to cut it.Just make sure that the key you buy is made for your car. The only other thing you can try is starting your car with the key you had made with the top half of the broken key right next to it. The car will read the broken key and start

wqeAeSVYaa	File a property damage and bodily injury claim against the other party's insurance carrier.  The property damage claim will resolve any damages to your vehicle.  The bodily injury claim will potentially cover damages (injuries) incurred as a result of the accident. You will need to prove your damages by providing the medical bills, pay stub, work schedule or other similar documents.      Additionally, a bodily injury claim can potentially be denied if the insurance company does not feel that there is sufficient causation for physical damages.  For example, someone claims whiplash from a sideswipe accident.  In this example, the bio-mechanics of a whiplash injury occur from front or rear end impacts, not sideswipes.  Basically your wife is going to have to prove her case.|`|qkz4QzKeaa	make use of the SE like google or yahoo to get some ideas first if you want to get the massive information,however if you do not want to spend so much time,here http://www.CarInsuranceTip.info/free-car...  is a direct and good resource for your questions.

I had a '68 XR-7 back in its day. Wish I still had it.    It sounds like the carburetor simply needs to be set up - idle mixture and proper idle speed when in Drive.|`|nRvRU6yJaa	well check your timing for one do you have a timing light? Start up the car let it idle then loosen the hold down blot on the distributor and with a rag on top turn the distributor left to right and see where the rpms get you and check the carburetor you may need to make some adjustments and double check the firing order too.|`|wiXk7ODdaa	First of all make sure the timing is correct. My hunch is the timing is correct, but I'd still start there. If after you've ensured the timing is right and it's still dying, it's time to look at the carbuerator (the culprit in this case I think), specifically the gas/air mixture. Adjusting a carb is tricky business, one of if not the trickiest when it comes to working on cars. If you've done all the other work then you may be up for the challenge - why not give it a shot? If it's still dying after you've put three days into it, and you're starting to think driving it off a cliff sounds good, that is when you know for sure it's time to hand it over to someone paid to fix cars. Sounds like a beautiful ride, and I'll bet it's the air/gas mixture.

RjUhISEIaa	Have to agree with the 1st post to ask what year she is. The seller posts that it has "all new redone seats." Why? Wear and tear or left open to the elements?     She is a beauty but without knowing the year there's no way anyone can comment on whether she's a good deal or not.

We'll be happy to comment on the $$$ then.|`|iTj5NdH1aa	I wouldn't really worry too much about how old it is. First of all it looks fairly new anyway, and second, its a fresh water boat...    If he is asking $19,000 for it, I'd say that is about what you can expect. But you can probably talk him down from that... keep in mind he has a child on the way and needs to sell this thing soon.     Also talk with the owner and ask him how well it has been maintained over the years. The boat looks like its in good shape.|`|NLzYefsVaa	What year is it?  It looks like it is in great shape but if it was more than 8-10 years old I wouldn't pay more than $10k-15k for it.  If it is less than 5 years old it is a good price.    When boats hit that 10 year mark, you start seeing electrical issues pop up, blower motors and bilge pumps start going and battery needs replacement.  Cosmetically the boat starts to show it's age as far as carpeting, paint and cushions.  Look for maintenance records, how clean the boat and motor is.  Check the trailer out too!  Good luck!

e54245b949fc37ae37c1c0d76403714daa	Yes, Enterprise does one way rentals.  There is a drop off fee or one way fee.  Depending on where you are moving to and the need for cars in that area usually determine what the fee is.  If the area that you are going to drop it off needs cars, there may not even be a fee.  But if have an abundance of cars, there will be a fee.  Check with Enterprise first and get the fees in advance.  Believe it or not, sometimes dropping a vehicle off at an airport is better.  From my own experience with Enterprise, it was cheaper to pick the car up from a local agency in a small town...but they discounted my rental fees because I dropped it off at the airport!!|`|AA11914369	Yes, one way rentals are allowed, they cost more, and you have to tell them in advance that you will be dropping out of state.|`|D6kZzXQeaa	Enterprise will allow this but they do usually charge a drop fee, and you must book in advance. If you live near an airport see if they have a car owned by the city your going to. Sometimes they will give you a cheaper rate.|`|fQBfjdz1aa	Yes you can do this with Enterprise however they usually have a very large drop off fee if you do this.  I would make sure you ask them about this and the fee price ahead of time so you are not surprise.    If you need to rent and drop off in another state I would go with Hertz.  They are usually much more accomodating with this type of thing as enterprise is mostly devoted to insurance replaement vehicles (not to say they don't do the vacation thing to) but hertz is primarily for anything else ie: business, vacation and such

t2XRy9G5aa	more than welcome...    it really doesn't matter which order you go ... just make sure whatever component area you start that you complete all steps before moving to the next.    personally, I would start with putting the engine in the frame, then all the electrical wiring routing, throttle cable routing up to completing the handlebars including controls (throttle, kill switch, clutch) but wouldn't worry to much about grips or tightening down bars in the clamps.  this should give you complete running engine in the frame.      I would then move to installing the swing arm and rear suspension components, then move to front suspension (tirple clamps, fork legs) ... now you have something that half way resembles a bike.    then move to brake assemblies (pick your poison, front or back, just work thru complete set up out to the calipers before going to the other end).    install tires on wheels (if not already pre assembled), bearings, sprocket on rear wheel and rear brake disc... move to front and install bearings, front brake disk... wheel assemblies ready to install on bike.    install wheel assemblies, completing one at a time to completion... front is easiest since merely slip in place, align rotor into caliper, align and install axle with shims in as supposed to be, tighten ... move to rear, slip chain over sprocket, slide rotor into caliper, align & insert axle (make sure you have chain adjusters on ends of swing arm before inserting axle) ... before tightening axle, adjust chain to about 3/4-1 inch free play in the middle, then tighten axle...    there are probably a variety of variables where you could start off with front/rear suspension & wheel assemlies so you have what is referred to a rolling chassis ... THEN install the engine... it's really all personal preference ....    then stick on tank, plastics, grips, etc.  ...  i.e., the finishing touches    either build up complete engine & frame assemblie first OR build up rolling chassis first ... doesn't really matter ...    I just have a nice work bench area where I can do all the engine to frame installation and a hydraulic service jack that I can then clamp the frame/engine assembly to do the rest of the installation ...|`|kVoYXO80aa	hard to add to what pmk stated...    but totally agree, work one area to completion before moving to something else...|`|u0PHhZOSaa	do the suspension first then the motor then the electronic,plastic,seat,chain/sprocket, food/marijuana break, gas/oils, gear and ride. easy that way the bike will be on a stand after the suspension is put together. the motor will slide in. everything else is a breeze from there. good luck cant wait to see the out come|`|9zi6AEz4aa	frame, forks, wheels and engine, handle bars, fuel tank and seat and lights and  side covers

Ld7dOtGUaa	Depends on how many cc's the current heads are and what the measurement of cc's are after having the heads shaved.  Whats your compression ratio?  If you drastically raise the compression in an older engine you will cause detonation which will destroy the engine in a short time.  Higher compression will definitely "warm" up the engine.  Have you installed hardened seats?  Are you running closed chamber or open chamber heads, original, aftermarket or aluminum heads, it all makes a difference.    The best bang for the bucks in a 400ci Pontiac engine is, when you built it you could have put a 455 crank into it.  My friend recently did that to his '67 GTO and it made a world of difference!    PS: 400cc's is approximately 7cubic inches!|`|zOIgzIy4aa	you should notice some difference because shaving the heads will put the valves closer to the pistons but don,t shave them too much or you will have a chance of blowing the head gaskets.|`|Gn0nR2S1aa	its gonna bump up the compression a little. how noticeable depends on how much you plane off the heads. i wouldn't do too much though, talk to the shop that's shaving them and see what they recommend
0B0ycKw3aa	Hello new driver :)    If you are a young driver attempting to find cheap and affordable car insurance you are probably already aware of the challenge that lies ahead. The statistics about teenage drivers arent good. According to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS), 16-year-olds get into accidents almost six times more often than drivers between the age of 30 and 59. No wonder car insurance premiums are so high for this age group. It has always been difficult if you are aged between of 16 - 25 to insure your car affordably, and although car insurance companies are beginning to recognize the need to supply this ever expanding market, it can still prove to be hard to find a reasonably priced car insurance premium.    For instance, young drivers will often own older or less maintained vehicle compared to other drivers, which means they are more likely to break down and potentially cause an accident. Teenage drivers are also more likely to have accidents which can either injure themselves or the other party.    However, parents should be aware if the fact that there are several ways that can help lower car insurance costs for your teen. In order for teen drivers and car insurance to work well together, parents need to know the factors that will help contribute to paying less for their son or daughters auto insurance in the future.    The first thing that insurance providers look into when giving a car insurance quote is the driving record of the person. Teenagers that have a good driving record may merit consideration. What that means is that you can help keep your teen focused on safe driving by having him or her pay a portion of the auto insurance premium. Also, be sure to let your teen know the consequences of getting traffic tickets.    Before you purchase your car it is also worth researching which insurance group it will fall in, so that you can ensure you will be able to get the cheapest possible insurance.    Finally, by using Insurance4lessdirect.com you can rest assured that we will strive to find you the cheapest car insurance premium that will provide you and your teenager with the best cover.    Did you know: If youre adding your teen driver to your auto insurance policy, be sure to take advantage of the auto insurance discount for good students, available in many states.    For quick and free 50 state insurance quote comaprison visit: http://www.insurance4lessdirect.com.    Don't forget to talk to your parents too.    Good luck :)|`|Ld7dOtGUaa	If you REALLY want to know, use some common sense and call an insurance agent and find out.  It will depend on where you live, type of car, value of car, are you going to be an add on to your parents policy..... etc|`|r9s0VyJgaa	It doesn't matter if its an 8 cylinder car.  What matters is whether you'll have a separate insurance policy or be on your parents' policy; how much collision, comprehensive, Personal Injury Protection, and other coverages you want/need (IOW, $$ amounts of liability coverage), how much of a deductible you want, etc etc.    Nobody here can give you an insurance quote, only an insurance agent can do that.     Call a couple of different insurance companies or agencies, get quotes from 3 or 4 different insurance companies and compare prices.|`|vkYDOVIdaa	You should also consider that such a car may be expensive to insure.

JKZ1ywB6aa	The best thing you can do is go to your local DMV office and pick up a copy of the CDL manual. In the manual there will be all the information he needs to pas the CDL knowledge test.

If he can answer those questions he will ace the knowledge test.It is that simple . Good luck to him in his new job

1e85b081f9cb68b21b9d1357e658f9ccaa	Those are just springs that make the heal of the pad pull away and toe of the brake apply first. That helps with squealing noise. Second picture shows the correct pad spring alignment. Even out of place the spring is still working. Car could drive safely even with out those springs. Many aftermarket brake pads do not have them. Nissan Technicians prefer to use the original Equipment brake parts.
WO68RZdIaa	Based on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration statistics- it all depends on the age group.  In these 2 groups - Ages 15-21 & in older adults- men are shown to have more fatality & non-fatality accidents than women.    But even this agency doesn't differentiate the fact than men drive more than women & adjust their findings on equal amount of miles driven for the other age groups in their reports. And that can skew the accuracy of the findings in their reports.     http://www.nhtsa.gov/|`|b33d9540a5f5fce74fa36171a90569b1aa	yea probably guys really get a handle down on their vehicle and it's functions as well as paying attention to blind spots.|`|euXfb9aGaa	http://www.car-accidents.com/pages/car-c...

So, take it for how you want.|`|Bq8SxIJNaa	Women tend to crash more than men because they are allot more careless. Men seem to care more and respect the aspect of driving allot better.

If you can do some of the body work and prep work like removing lights, mouldings, glass, locks, handles then it will help keep the cost down.|`|msxoY6ERaa	depends on the body work that needs to be done, could cost a lot its hard to estimate without a picture, also it depends on the color and brand of paint and also depends on the guy doing it. if you do it yourself obviosuly it would be considerably less. but other wise could be up to 4000 or 5000 ?|`|nRvRU6yJaa	Well there labor & materials a simple paint job one color would be some where between $600-2000 depending on where you go. You can buy the paint shop system from Duplicolor its a primer and a lack-er based paint with clear its easy to use all you need is a compressor regulator hose and a paint gun some some scuff pads and mixes and some protective Equipment like a respirator and gloves that would run you around $800 total cost.
6b241499c91029b41309ed54b7f64ba9aa	Actually, the statute of limitations in California for property damage is 3 years. The statute of limitations for injuries is 2 years.     While you may think you are saving money by not reporting the claim, you are taking a gamble. It is not uncommon for what appears to be minimal damages to cost over $1k. Actually, that would be a pretty small job in the auto body repair industry. The longer you wait to report the claim, the more chance you take that the damage caused could could be later overlapped by another incident. If you wait for 6 months, you could end up submitting the claim and having your insurance company mistakenly pay for even more damage than you caused.     Typically, the amount your insurance may go up because of the at fault attribution would not be more than what you would likely pay out of pocket. It's really up to you, but I would recommend getting your insurance involved. That's what you pay them for...to take the hassle away when you've been in an accident.    You also run the risk of finding out a month from now that the other party is now claiming an injury and has been treating unreasonably with a chiropractor with dollar signs in his eyes, knowing that she will treat as long as he tells her she's "out of alignment." By not allowing your insurance company to know about this potential exposure, they are also unable to set the expectation for what is reasonable with a minor fender bender and end up paying more than what you owe for in the end. When these type of surprises pop up, it affects everyone with raised insurance premiums.     As I said, not reporting the loss to your carrier is a gamble.|`|PgBQmtoeaa	kittenkittencow, I recommend you locate a local car insurance agent to help. Since I live in Kansas I can't recommend anyone in California, but here is an website that can help you. http://www.simpleautoquotes.com/Auto-Ins...   Good Luck!|`|wqeAeSVYaa	The statute of limitations for property damage in California is three years.  This is determined by the Department of Insurance, not your insurance carrier.      However, the terms of your policy, which can be reviewed in your policy jacket probably say that it is "your duty to report an accident to ____ insurance company in ____ hours."  Usually 24 or 48 hours, but your insurance may be different.    If you "scratched" her bumper, you can expect to pay about $650-$800 for bumper repairs.  That is assuming that nothing actually needs to be replaced and that the bumper can just be repaired.    Most people, when facing the reality that car repairs are not inexpensive, just opt to file their claim.  You bought insurance for a reason, you might as well use it.  Many insurance companies do not track claims under $750, so it may not affect your premiums.|`|gaXUIduMaa	You should notify them as soon as possible.  Unless there is a statement in the policy there is no time limit but there is usually something like two weeks.  What you do have to do is to file an accident report with the state and your insurance company, AAA, will do that for you.|`|4AbgOk6aaa	I believe AAA gives you up to a year. It is best to call your local AAA office to make sure.

6b241499c91029b41309ed54b7f64ba9aa	The state your son is living in will determine whether or not he will be compensated for the loss. If he lives in a "no fault" state, then each driver would proceed through their own auto insurance carrier. If he lives in a state like California, the driver who is at fault will be liable to pay for the damages caused. If she was insured, her auto insurance company should pay for the damage caused related to this accident. Keep in mind that just because she says she is insured, doesn't mean she didn't forget to pay her bill last month, or forget to add the new car she was driving to her policy, etc.     There are still other state laws that may apply. Such as, in California, Proposition 213 states that since your son was uninsured at the time of loss, if he were injured as a result, he only be eligible for tangible medical costs and loss of earnings. The price he would pay in CA for being injured in an auto accident where he was uninsured would be that he is not eligible for "pain and suffering" or the profit factor in an accident. I'm not sure which state your son lives in, but he should look into state specifics such as what I've just outlined.     Otherwise, as long as he truly was not at fault, he should be fine. He just doesn't have an insurance company to back him up if the other driver gives an entirely different statement of loss which disputes his own version.|`|PpuOab4Gaa	If your state requires insurance, he should have gotten a ticket, but it will be for the court to decide about financial restitution.|`|3MTYGEbWaa	Did he get a police report that indicated it was the lady's fault? If so, she is responsible and it doesn't matter that your idiot son didn't have insurance. If not, if you can't convince the lady to pay for her damages, and your son has no insurance, the expense is on him, totally. If she thinks he was at fault, she could sue him for damages. With no insurance, he'll be responsible on his own.    Why do people drive around with no insurance???????????|`|AA10232957	if it is her fault, then she is liable, not him....|`|2ee9ba3f8fa52a8c3bd583c6f12f11b8aa	Insurance protects YOU from your liabilities.

Ld7dOtGUaa	FWD is generally better in the snow, so if you live and drive in snow country, then I'd stick with FWD jsut because of that.      FWD's are lousy on tires and half shaft replacement/maintenance.  FWD is used by the manufacturers because its a cheap and fast way to build a car...  no other reason than saving money.    RWD handles a lot better than a FWD.  Proof:  Formula 1 races cars ALL have RWD, if FWD was better they would use it!  None of the worlds best handling cars have FWD, repeat...  NONE of the worlds best handling cars have front wheel drive.  None of the NASCAR or Indy type cars do either.  There's millions of dollars made in these types of racing and if FWD was the best they would be using that system.  Nor. do any of the top classes in pro drag racing, with the millions of dollars involved in this type of racing, they would also be using FWD if it was better, none of them do    For the average driver, you probably won't know the difference, except the RWD won't wear out tires as fast nor will it need half shafts.|`|AA11003538	Basically a rear wheel drive car is one which has a roating shaft down it's length to transmit the power from the engine to the rear wheels instead of the front wheels. This allows for better handling, and more power can be applied. However, in normal day to day driving theres not really that much point, since it's only really needed if you plan on trying to do any racing or whatever. rear wheel drives are more expenxive since thyey are more complex to build. basically go try one and see whether you think the benefits are worth changin cars|`|KuScji8iaa	Like the other guy said, BUT you can save a lot by driving a RWD car because you won't have to replace a CV joint, which costs a lot of money.

BgwTxzEFaa	If your engine light is on with the cat in place, removing the cat is not going to fix it.  It will make things worse.    The sensors will do what is call mimicking, which means that the rear 02 sensor will be reading the same as the front o2 sensor because the converter is not breaking down the hydrocarbons.  As a result, the Check Engine Light will still remain on, plus, it may cause your vehicle to run rich(or lean) depending on conditions because the computer will be getting bad data from the sensors.    The computer is set up to run California Emissions, which mean you need both catalytic converters and the complete set of Oxygen sensors for the car to run properly.    Regardless of what the law is in PA, the vehicle still has to run its emissions system properly to pass inspections, and with California emissions, unfortunately, it needs both cats to do so.|`|a8m3HdDHaa	No leaving one converter out won't get rid of the problem.

XLXncQu9aa	I do believe that this something that happens more commonly than not.  Your situation is not exclusive.  The thing about foreign drivers is that they are not used to our laws our ways of driving.  They are not accustomed to doing things the way we do them.  So you will see them driving slower on roads because they aren't sure where to go, or in your case they may drive on the wrong side of the road because in their country the lane markings are different than ours.  It can be frustrating but the thing is if you can avoid driving behind them, they present themselves as hazards.  However you said you were involved in two accidents.  I can tell you that you are not at fault for either accident if they were the one's driving on the wrong side of the road.  Their insurance if they have any should cover the accident.

I don't know if you need to change your fuel filter or not, but it looks like it's easy enough to change.|`|AA11745513	your forgetting the spark plugs. why would you want to put new ignition system parts on and not put in 6 $6 spark plugs? it wouldn't be to easy for the oxygen sensor, cap and rotors, and the fuel filter unless you have experience with that i wouldn't recommend it. the air filter is easy and the PCV valve isn't a hard replacement. when you change the cap and rotor you have to know how to time the spark so it runs correctly. the oxygen sensor is underneath and on the exhaust manifold which is hard to change without it in the air. the fuel filter is usually in places that the cars needs to be in the air and you have to know how to bleed the fuel line pressure or gas will spray into you eyes possibly. the spark plugs you may be able to do yourself but they sometimes get seized on the cylinder head and if you don't do it right you can strip it out and end up with a $1500 repair for a new cylinder head.|`|zCfef8ybaa	all seems to be pretty cheap and easy to fix and yes you have coil packs the most expensive part will be the rotors and or the O2 sensor  but it shouldnt be too hard to fix all that up|`|tKWwZpOAaa	Doesn't sound like you have the experience to fix it yourself, ie distributor comment, also if your closing in on 100k miles there is scheduled maintenance coming up thats going to be around $1000. Back to your question though, for parts if your going to do it yourself and I assume your doing all for rotors and not just one your probably looking at around $400, more if you go all Audi OE parts.

C2vtv5OKaa	The most reliable cars are Honda's, hands down.  The honda civic will be about $3k or under if you find a good deal.  My first car was a civic that I bought for $3,200 and I was driving it until 235k miles when I sold it for $2,500.  Not too bad!!    Check out craigslist.com, or even eBay motors and search within a certain distance from your zipcode.  Also try autotrader.com.      Toyotas are also pretty reliable and cheap as well.  I would check out a Toyota Corolla, or Celica if you are looking for something the looks nice.|`|OfQwVhD2aa	Take a look around some of the car lot down around patchouge for a good little Honda or look in News days classified adds.   If suffolk life Is still around look in there too.   Another one is the Yankee Trader.     Look for a Honda,Nissan, toyota, or a ford ranger pick up.|`|Tr4ObDDXaa	every one says toyota or honda, they are over rated quality    the best car on the road is a buick (dosent matter what model all are great), they are not exactly the coolest cars out there but they will out last any thing.|`|HtbDHQdHaa	Toyota or Honda best in quality !
4ITRBwAWaa	If you have permanent 4-wheel drive, you have the Quadradrive system, (247 transfer case) that was put on the 99-04 Jeep Grand Cherokees. You cannot disengage the 4-wheel drive by pulling and fuses it is all strictly mechanical.  You can take out the front drive shaft on the 247 but it will not save any MPGs.  And you will have to change the Transfer case fluid more often because when the driveshaft is out it always detects slip and engages the Transfer case.  But on the positive side... You can do some wicked burnouts... lol|`|7HDWtqhOaa	Your jeep is a all-wheel drive type set up and no you cant disengage the front axles.

B5rC6WPTaa	Some pretty random notes:    Do not purchase a 944 as a daily driver unless you work from home or have a backup. I'm not trying to be down on the car, but it's a fact of ownership.    944s are a love/hate relationship. You will wonder why you bought the car when you are replacing the clutch ($500 in parts). You will also love driving the car, IF you appreciate a slowish, simple car that has great balance and handling precision.    I put 50,000 miles on a 944. Shortly before it was wrecked by someone else, I removed the engine and gave it a light overhaul. At 150,000 miles, the internals looked beautiful, but I changed a number of wear parts- clutch, water pump- in one shot to have a reliable car in the long-term. The basic stuff is built to last.    Now the good news. $6000 will buy you a very nice 944. $5,000 will buy you a nice car, and you'll have some money for repairs. I encourage you to do that. If you are not mechanically inclined, look for one with a recent clutch change, head gasket change, water pump and timing/balance belt replacement. Expect to go through $500-1000 a year for repairs, possibly more if you need to pay a shop. If you are uncomfortable, there are plenty of online bulletin boards and resources to help you tackle some simpler jobs and save some money.     Avoid a 1984 car as a daily. Look at one made after January 1985...the interior and heat/ventilation are much better. They are not so rare that you should jump on the first one you find. Unlike most cars, buy on the strength of maintenance records, not mileage. I would trust a well-maintained 200,000 mile car over a 50,000 mile car with no history.    A 944 is not a fast car in a straight line. It will not take drag racing abuse. It has a 140 hp 4 cylinder. The transmission is an Audi unit, and is marginally strong enough to handle the car's power. Acceleration is maybe a little faster than a new base Civic. Buy a BMW 328 for the same money if you want a 6 second 0-60 time. But...with fresh suspension bushings and tires, the 944 really shines as a true sports car. There isn't much in its price range that will outhandle or outbrake it. If you appreciate that, you'll like the car.    It's a very safe car...the woman who hit me at 45 mph couldn't get out of her car. My doors worked almost perfectly! These cars have metal bumpers and a lot of steel. They are also galvanized. Nearly any 944 with more than a little surface rust on a paint chip was in an accident at some point.|`|qxAo5UQFaa	Joel pretty much nailed this one.  I've owned a 86 944 for about seven years now, so let me share what i've learned.    As for what's gone wrong? Here are the 944's Achilles heels:    Motor Mounts- Seem to go bad as often as every few years. If you drive a car and notice a lot of vibration from idle up to about 1200rpm, you've got bad mounts.  Replace with the turbo variety, cost is about $600-700.     Clutch- Original rubber centered clutch breaks into pieces with time and age, and a clutch replacement will run you up to $2000 plus. If you're looking at a 944, you'd be wise to find one that's had this done done and replaced with a spring centered clutch.     Radiator-  944s are notorious for running hot, so don't let this turn you off.  If it creeps up to around 3/4 on the temp gauge, that's just what they do and there isn't much to do about it. Remember, all aluminum engines are more efficent when they're hot anyways.  With that said, it seems 944 radiators fail moreso than you're standard vehicle, parts and labor run about $700-800.    Timing belt/water pump-  This major service on the 944 needs to be completed every 4-5 years or 50,000 miles.  It's very important it's not over looked, because if your timing belt breaks (and they do all too often) you bend valves and toast the top of your engine.  This major runs around $1500-2500 parts and labor.  Find a car that's had this carried out recently, and make sure they did the rollers, thermostat, balance shaft belt while they were in there.  Timing belt should be retensioned once or twice between majors as well.    Suspension- If you're looking at an 85.5 or later car, make sure the front suspension is tight and in good order.  The only way to replace ball joints is to replace the entire control arm, at a cost of about $500 each side plus labor.   Early cars, this can be done without removing the control arm for a fraction of the price.     Few other notes- The engine seals do tend to leak over time, and this becomes a 'while you're in there' job during a major service. Labor can run from an hour to seven hours, depending what needs to be done. Check your major fluids for mixing, while headgaskets are generally robust, it's not uncommon for the oil cooler to mix oil and coolant as it ages and needs to be rebuilt.  944 electrics aren't perfect, so don't be surprised if you come across a car with a non-working sunroof, power window, etc.   Shocks will usually be shot past 100k, and replacements are fairly expensive unless you buy the cheapest of the cheap, which will last a few years at best.      I picked my 944 up for about $3500 (7 years ago that was the middle of the road for pricing) and it's been a reliable car, but that's only because i've spent about $6000-8000 correcting a lot of the issues I mentioned above. If you buy a car that hasn't been cared for properly, you'll be doing a lot more than that.  It's so important to buy a 944 with a service history, otherwise you're really opening up a can of worms.  It IS a love/hate relationship, and buying a Porsche isn't like buying any other car, it's more like a high maintenance mistress and a never ending project.  Do your research and know what you're getting into, because this is a car that can get you over your head very quickly if you don't have deep pockets.  I love my 944, it's a great car, but it's also not for everyone.  Figure $1500-2000/yr on average, is what most 944 owners pay (if you cant do your own work) to keep driving down the road properly.      There are many resources on the net to help you with your decision, and don't buy a car without having a trusted and knowledageble mechanic check it out.|`|9Kt7p7Vfaa	Two things that weren't touched on are the moon roof seal likes to leak after a while or if the drains are plugged and an engine from a pre-85.5 was essentially built from spare Audi/Volkswagen/porsche parts. They are cheap compared to other Porsches because they were built on an assembly line not by hand. Which is why they were dubbed the poor man's Porsche.|`|addaf7237cf3d32190cfc96546e98709aa	They are cheap because they are slow compared to today's cars while the Boxster and 911 are still fast compared to todays cars.    They are reliable if they have been taken cars of. They will reach 200,000 miles.    Old German cars usually get electrical problems like messed up power windows or locks or radio or lights.    $6,000 is about right.    This car was about $25,000 when brand new, which was a lot of money in the 1980's.|`|qm9xrYiqaa	so so|`|6NeppKodaa	There is a following for the 944, it was an entry level car and cost much less new than the 911. I have 2 944's and they are great cars. For $6000 the car should be in really great condition. The must do, repeat, must do maintenance is to change the timing belt every 30,000 miles. If you break  the timing belt, all the valves will be bent. Other maintenance is just like any car, oil changes, etc. The 944 is one the best handling of all Porsche's. The motor is good for 300,000 miles if maintained. 944's are not quick off the line but it will pull all the way to 130 plus mph and loves curves, this is a drivers car, not a drag racer. $6000 may be too much not too little.

RWjvcCYoaa	No. We're in a serious recession. The worst since the Great Depression. In order to qualify for a loan today you have to have at least 3 years of credit history in good standing, 2 years at your present job and making $2000/mth or more, and have 5 years at your present address. It's doubtful that at 18, you'll have the first two stipulations.     Over 70% of all auto loan applicants are being turned down for credit by lenders. They don't care about how much you'll put down. All they want to know is if you have proof that you've made all your monthly payments on time for the past three years, have no collections, charge offs or bankruptcy and that your job is one that is not susceptible to a layoff.

There is a big risk in buying any kind of used car for that cheap and if the car dies the month after you buy it, you still owe a whole bunch of money on the new paperweight.

I probably wouldn't do the swap, but that's just strictly an opinion. There is no reason another person shouldn't do it.     Since the two motorcycles are mechanically nearly exactly the same, take a Street Glide for a test ride and see if you can live with the trade off.     On a side note: If you are going to do it, I would always check ebay for the parts. I have seen new stock take-offs go for as little as $75. For that price, you could just try it and if you don't like it, you can just switch back.     Good luck.|`|yaq7oaH6aa	It will compromise handling, and decrease ground clearance.  Just how much is 'cool' worth to you?|`|5FPAobonaa	It will certainly be a rough ride but thats the price of cool|`|0g2fDpUbaa	There are lowering kits out there that will accomplish what you want..but all DO come with the price of making the ride a LOT harder on you.  Lowering the rear will give the rear suspension less room to travel and less room to absorb the bumps, so they will transfer more directly to you.

Then, if the battery is 5 years and older, plan on replacing that and if the battery is that old, chance are it burnt the alternator.  You need a battery  to control alternator output otherwise it will overjuice and burn up inside - killing it.   So, battery and alternator together.   If the fuel filter is clean, well then the fuel pump is the problem.    The truck will not run on alternator alone, nor very long on battery alone(500 miles in the daytime on the highway tops).     Do alternator/battery   first and maybe that is it for if it is an electric fuel pump, well then there was no juice there for it to work.|`|a70d82417eb7a74192f967dcdc832b20aa	Sounds like the alternator.

The 3 series has always been the starter car for BMW.  A.K.A Poor mans BMW

AA12193324	In general Subaru's and specifically impreza's do not react that well to lowering.  A very small drop seems to work ok with firmer spring rates, but lowering the car way down makes handling worse.  The one big handling flaw is the under steer that comes stock from the factory.  To correct this use a stiffer rear sway bar (like the STI bar for example).  Other than that just pick springs and shocks that are matched and firm enough for you...  Springs and shocks are always a matter of balance, firmer will give you sharper handling, but makes the ride very uncomfortable.  Ride in other peoples cars and pick one that has the right balance for you.    Also adjustable coilovers are always a big improvement, they are more resistant to overheating and are adjustable to suite your tastes in firmness.|`|AA11652224	The guys who answered before me are correct. Dropping an Impreza too low will result in worse handling. Generally people go with a good spring/strut combo for its ride quality and overall improvement on cornering.    Dropping in aftermarket springs in the stock struts isn't bad per se; it just lessens the life of your stock struts because the spring rate is higher thus more dampening is needed. I hear swift springs and koni yellow inserts do wonders.    If you go the coilover route, these seem to be the best overall performance mod, but not so much on ride comfort, so expect a bumpier ride. Some to consider are apex'i, megan, helix, BC, tein flex, cusco    Swaybars are a good start (thats what I'm about to do). If you want to do this, make sure to change out the stock plastic endlinks and bushings while you're down there. Generally, the larger the rear sway is than the front sway, you'll decrease the understeer problem. Some good brands are whiteline and cusco (perrin's are said to have fitment issues.)    Hope this helps.|`|ZBVMT11maa	Please do not get any Tein S-techs. i personall have the Tein h-Techs and love them manye of my friends have Prodrives and love them too.     If you want some good performance get a rear sway bar . many people love the prodrive blues with either kyb/ d-specs shocks.     try this links out for people talking about what are the best and so forth.

Suspension Supersticky: Springs, Coilovers, Swaybars, S-Techs, fitment, tech, more!   http://forums.nasioc.com/forums/showthre...|`|7L0zp7O6aa	Just to add to what the others said, don't forget the power of a good set of tires.  Good tires can make a huge difference in cornering especially if you are still on the stock RE92's.  Aftermarket springs can be bad for the struts if they are not rated to mach the valving but at the mileage you are at, your struts probably have seen better days so a set of KYB shocks and some STI pink or Prodrive springs would be a good match. Basically, dropping your car more than an inch or so effects the suspension geometry so that's why it suffers.  There are parts on the suspension that change your camber and toe a little when you take a corner and the spring compresses.  When the car is lowered too much, you can screw that up.  There are some fixes for that like the WhiteLine roll center adjusters.  I would read the suspension FAQ stickied in the suspension section of NASIOC.com for some great info on how our systems work.  Of course, if you are just looking for a better stance and do not track the car, you really don't have to worry too much about these things and go with any name brand spring.

BgwTxzEFaa	So, what are you asking?    You (or your friend) probably bent the lower control arm, and/or tie rod. You may have also damaged the rim.  If the vehicle also has a radius arm (or strut rod) you may have bent that as well.    Cost of repair depends on vehicle but could range anywhere from $200 to $1000(parts and labor) including realignment depending on the type of vehicle and just how much damage you did to the suspension.    Note: The mechanic is going to be able to tell that someone hit a curb, so your step dad is going to find out.  I would come clean.|`|zOIgzIy4aa	if you hit that hard then probably the tie rod or rack is ruined and maybe bent the lower control arm.|`|OfQwVhD2aa	You need to man up & take responsibility fo your actions.

You will feel so much better even tho its desperately embarrassing after lying to him but he will most likely respect you even if he gets all mad and all which he should be but after that he will think about how grown up you ended up acting about it. Even if he blows his top at least you'll have your peace of mind. You could always talk to your mom about it if you are close with her and have her help you how to bring the truth to the surface.

If you have ever been scuba diving, you can be in 15 feet of water and it can feel like you have ice picks in your ears. This is because the pressure inside your head is not equalized to the water outside. If the tunnel was not pressurized, your ear drums would burst when you drove into the middle of the tunnel.    The other feelings that you may have when going through the tunnel may include being claustrophobic or maybe anxiety due to the fact that your under water. Fear may be another feeling as you may think that the tunnel will collapse and fill with water, etc.    I hope that this answers your question.

XKYJk6Tcaa	I assume the engine is out of the car. if not it is alot better to remove it and put it on a stand. remove the oil pan without turning the engine upside down and take a look at the crank and bearings. if they look bad I would reccomend rebuilding the bottom end also. but if they don't look to bad you can take a sprayer of lacquer thinner and wash out the crank and rods and pan. most likely if you didn't have any weird noises from the bottom end it should be okay but I would reccommend rebuilding the bottom end because of the work you done on the top end will cause more pressure in the crankcase and it could end the whole engine.|`|FjgLglhoaa	they make a cleaner that you run through it but i dont know how good it works|`|zOIgzIy4aa	someone must have used quaker state oil. drop the oil pan and clean it out. if the valve pans looks that way then probably there,s sludge in the oil pan too.|`|Gn0nR2S1aa	Can try a flush in a can product from the parts store but my advice would be to get it done professionally from a shop with an engine flush machine.|`|333a8b96e50ca7be29e4122a1437a3d4aa	Did you clean out the lifter valley when you changed the heads?

You've rebuilt the top half, so the valve guides should be good, how about the cylinder rings?  Probably time for a short-block rebuild.|`|EmgiGg17aa	Either pull the oil pan right off and clean the pan.  10 to 1 you won't find much.   Most sludge comes out when you do a hot oil change.  Do not use water.  Nor lacquer thinner or methyl hydrate or acetone.(those are not oil based products.)   Solvent only.(like paint thinner (Varsol).  Gasoline is too dangerous(we used to use it but it was dicey).  Never water inside the engine.  You can wash the outside of the engine with a pressure washer.   Sludge is the moisture in the oil(that it gets from the air) everytime the engine cools down.  Most of that moisture is driven off as the engine heats up again(at least an 8 mile drive one way)   Otherwise a little remains in the oil if you do shorter trips, and carbon deposits are added to the oil as the gas burns (which is scrapped off the cylinder walls by the rings) into the oil plus micro bits of metal as the rings slide against the cylinder walls, plus other wear points such as babbit material from the main bearings  and con rod bearings, gasket compounds and from dust in the air that makes its way into the motor as it sucks in air like a vacuum cleaner.      That is why oil gets changed on a regular basis..  No different than water in the sink.  You can only wash so many dirty dishes with the same water before you need to change the water for some fresh stuff.        But if you did the heads on a 78, it probably is a good time to have a machine shop do the bottom end as well.   You obviously have enough miles on it, so there is going to be blow by.   Best time is now.
OfQwVhD2aa	You disconnect your negative cable first, the your positve cable.  When you connect them back up it is the positive, the the negative cable.   If the battery was not installed properly or jumped correctly you probably blew the fusible link out on the car.     This also could be because of a bad neutral safety switch. ( helps car shift from neutral to drive  )   Your best bet is to take the car to your local (ASE certified or AAA  Approved ) garage for repair.|`|zOIgzIy4aa	the cable that goes to the starter goes on the positive terminal, the X terminal and the ground goes on the other 1. you have to watch hooking it backwards, you might burn the computer up.|`|EmgiGg17aa	Doesn't matter how you unhook it.

Should be a small button somewhere near the shifter to manually release it. It is normal to not be able to shift with the battery dead, the shift interlock (neutral safety switch) wont function properly.    Anyways.  Make sure the connections are tight on the battery. You should not be able to twist them with your hands.  If you can, they are too loose. If you cant tighten any further, and they are still loose, replace the terminal ends.    Also, make sure the battery polarity is connected correctly. If it is reversed, not only will it not work, but you could seriously damage the cars electronics.|`|64yRr2SHaa	your fuses it probably shot and blown or your boyfriend blew your whole electrical system. check the fuse first. as for the neutral you have to turn the key to the on position and press the brakes then switch it to neutral. dont let your b/f touch your car if he doesn't know what he is doing this my cost alot if the system is shot.|`|ojxOpAQmaa	Have you checked to see if the new battery has a charge in it ?? put a volt meter over it, it may read 12volts then turn on the head lights, if the volt meter goes down, charge the battery. if you don't have a volt meter, disconnect the negertive terminal, turn the head lights on, then just touch the terninal with the negative lead and you should get a small spark, if not the battery needs chargeing. If the battery is OK, check all fuses, some cars have a fuse in the main battery leads. Best of luck.|`|efa550f6673c521a6c47e67cc5153a8eaa	check to make sure the negative cable is hooked to the negative post, check to make sure the positive terminal is hooked to the positive post, make sure the cables are not broken or anything. if there is a possibility the cables were hooked up backwards the main fuse could be blown, usually a 125 amp fuse located where the battery cable joins to the fuse box.

Ht1aY8THaa	This problem is most seen with a blown head gasket. When the head gasket blows or becomes unsealed the radiator coolant and the engine oil mix. The oil goes into the radiator, the coolant reservoir, and the coolant goes into the engine. If your coolant has gone farther in the engine, the car will drive differently. Might want to hesitate when given gas, might want to stall out, might overheat easier. I would definitely take the vehicle to a mechanic as soon as possible without driving it. If need be, then drive it but just far enough to get it to the mechanic. The more you drive it the more likely it will be that you do severe engine damage and have to replace the whole engine.|`|zOIgzIy4aa	maybe they thought it was,nt any use. if it,s got gas in the oil then it could be the intake leaking or the computer is acting up.|`|EmgiGg17aa	I am guessing you are trying to get them to do it for free?  Why would there be water in the oil.   There normally is as there is moisture in the air you breathe.  But that moisture is driven out as the engine heats up.

There is a problem in your engine and they do not want to be blamed for any repercussions of it.    You need to get it checked. If you actually have fuel in the crank case there is a "slim possibility" that it is an easy fix being the fuel pressure regulator. They sometimes leak internally bypassing fuel into the vacuum system of the engine and then depositing it into the crank case.That is the best case scenario. Major engine damage would be the worst case scenario.     As previously mentioned, YOU NEED TO GET THIS PROFESSIONALLY DIAGNOSED. You are driving around in a bomb.

A single fuel injector being bad will not prevent your car from starting, it would just run very poorly (no different than a a bad spark plug on that cylinder, or a bad ignition wire).|`|86692840fce86f8a24dea58512123d09aa	be clear most people don't know you can haggle your car guy.

Hope this helps.|`|um6rmdegaa	mabe the injector can be cleaned.  if so while your are at it might as well get all done. cost varies as to where you live, i'm think around $100 for six. mabe it's not the injector

Load the Maxima with four "Biggest Loser" contestants and you'll beat it easily in your GS430.|`|ncwQ6IYlaa	Well 2000 was last year for the GS400. 2001 was GS430.   considering the Lexus is a rear drive V8 versus the Maxima V6 front drive - i vote for the Lexus (but it is probably close).
7L0zp7O6aa	Tale a look at some ROTA wheels at Wheeldude.com.  They are replica's of the big brand name wheels so many people oppose them but the quality for the rice is really not bad and I know of a few high power Subaru's locally that use them for track wheels so they aren't weak.  Probably about $600 a set for 16" and $700 for 17".  Many colors to choose from.|`|ZBVMT11maa	Rattle can them gold, its fun and you learn your car more. Esp on a budget.

7HDWtqhOaa	Old man emu. BUT  the roof on a Cherokee xj is not the best place for a spare tire to go, Roof rack yes, tire carrier no, The roof can buckle when 4x4ing.  Look into a rear bumper kit that has a swing away spare tire ad-on, and look on e-bay and see what you can afford and then give your BF an IOU card for the spare tire kit with a dollar limit and let him choose. especially if he is customizing his jeep. If you are ok with him buying your cloths and underwear with out him asking you then he should be ok with you buying him jeep parts.

Heavy duty rack often cost much more. I have a 92 Cherokee with a rack, but I have a swing-away rear bumper tire carrier. It also holds a hi-lift jack. There are lots of 4x4 websites that'll have good offers, but I like discountjeepparts.com. Keep your eyes peeled on ebay, craigslist and jeep forums such as naxja.org.  Good luck, and I hope your boyfriend knows how lucky he is to have you interested in the jeep!
ln6A3ITtaa	Nevermind those other fools. You got the 1998 model, which unfortunately only produced 150 horsepower and 155 lbs of torque. Later models got an extra 20 hp, but even they weren't  fast. You have to keep in mind that you got the cheapest Audi of that year. People who bought that car just wanted the prestige of a German luxury marque and were willing to make sacrifices.|`|Ld7dOtGUaa	Duhhhhhh.... It's a POS Audi 1.8 how fast did you expect it to be?  Absolutely no upgrade will make that POS fast.  Trade it in and get a real car.      The very best upgrade would be to take off the radiator cap, hold it above the radiator about a foot, back the POS Audi up, drive a real car under the radiator cap and install the cap on the real car.|`|VXcp8hvHaa	it's only 1 point freakin' 8, what do you expect from 60 horsepower?

Ht1aY8THaa	However replacing the brake pads is a cheap or somewhat inexpensive fix to an expensive problem, just keep in mind that you get what you pay for. Just changing the brake pads is actually not a good way to replace your brakes. When you replace your brakes you risk warping your rotors, or making your rotors uneven along with ruining the pressure given from your brake caliper to your brake pad. When your car was new, so were the rotors and pads. Over time the pads will wear out, and so will your rotors. They work together and should be maintained together. Now, you will not always need to buy new rotors however getting them machined or "turned" is always a good idea when replacing your brakes. And no matter what this man says, he cannot turn your rotors in his driveway. And changing brake pads is very simple and charging you $60 to do it, you might as well go to a professional to take care of that. I actually recommend that you do that anyway. Safety is very important and if your brakes lock up or fail, it does not have good consequences.|`|EmgiGg17aa	All dealerships have a parts department.  They also usually have repair faucilities.   Ask them how much it would cost to have the work done there - always do price comparisons.   The advantage of doing it at the dealership is that if some other part is needed, they can fix it right there right now with the right part.  No waiting.   However you can also get you pads replaced at places such as Midas or Budget Brake&Lube and Walmart.   Shop around to get a price idea in your head.|`|c48nm70gaa	Sad Spirit. The person you've chosen to do your brake pads is trying to give you very good advice. Go to your local Toyota dealer parts counter and pick up a complete set of disc brake pads and anti-rattle shims.    Toyota has a secret! Their OEM (Original Equipment Manufactures) brake pads last up to 70,000 miles with little or no wear to the brake rotors. No other brand can come close to that. Price is very competitive with other brands of ceramic based brake pads.|`|PLgNsOF9aa	At autoparts stores. If they dont have them, they'll order them. I dont know what auto parts stores you have in LA but cruise around or look up in the yellowpages for autoparts stores.|`|86692840fce86f8a24dea58512123d09aa	buy them online they are cheaper!|`|XKYJk6Tcaa	No it doesn't matter that you live in LA, Brake pad are available at most any auto parts store. and usually much cheaper than from the dealer. go to checker, auto zone, pep boys, or napa and they will usually have them in stock. they range in price from el cheapo to metallic linings which most places have a life time guarantee on them. then dicker with the man who said he would do it for 60 in his drive way ask him if he is going to turn the rotors for that price also. if he says no then you can take them to checkers, and they turn them for 15 dollars each. but do not just replace the pads without turning the rotors. or you will have uneven spots wear on your pads and when you are stopping your car will jerk then turn then jerk and turn as the brakes are applied.|`|ypk3jQgjaa	Advance auto. Auto Zone. And any other autoparts stores worldwide. Just go in and tell them what you need and they will ask you some q's about your car and if you don't know much about it they will come out and take a look-see.|`|AT0e3xwAaa	You can get them from any major auto parts retailer. Suggest you take an original pad from your truck with you to store to compare to new pad. There are a couple of different pads for that vehicle.    Yes dealers also sell parts in addition to new vehicles. They are drastically higher priced than the local parts store chains but they also have superior parts than the after market supplies.
XKYJk6Tcaa	yes you can learn from getting a maintenance manual and it pretty much will give you step by step instructions. the only think you would not be able to do is the machine work. unless you have a machine shop. but rebuilding an engine is very simple and give you great pleasure when you fire it up. its not hard just time consuming my advice is take some pictures of the motor before tearing it apart because you will not be able to remember where all the hoses go.|`|VXcp8hvHaa	no way dude, it won't last 2 minutes, trust me|`|ZR8wgt6vaa	Building an engine any engine is no easy task, mentally or physically.

KQhIcU4Yaa	Until July 1920, U.S. Navy Battleships did not officially have "BB" series hull numbers. They were, however, referred to by "Battleship Number", with that number corresponding to the "BB" number formally assigned in July 1920, or which would have been assigned if the ship had still been on the Navy list.     Battleships are listed in the source link below under the appropriate numbers in the "BB" series.|`|532deab779a2372a57081cb9271a0d97aa	The number dictates what number in the line of battleships it is EX; Arizona is 38 but New Jersey is a much newer battleship so it's number is 62. That is all the number means it also helps in filing as records for say the predreadnought missouri might get mixed with the records for the newer missouri but as they have totally different numbers they won't be mixed up.|`|dip4oxB5aa	Death|`|AA12136768	Sometimes it resembles a 2  Sometimes it resembles a 6  Sometimes it resembles a 4  Sometimes it resembles a 1  Sometimes it resembles a 7  Sometimes it resembles a 9  Sometimes it resembles a 8  Sometimes it resembles a 3  Sometimes it resembles a 0  Sometimes it resembles a 5  Sometimes it resembles a combination of these numbers.
SgiyLuZvaa	Any engine you want. Engine mounts are pretty easy to get from a local machine shop, but I would recommend using a 460 with 429 SCJ heads and plenty of other performance parts to make those wheels spin a little faster and with a little more torque.
