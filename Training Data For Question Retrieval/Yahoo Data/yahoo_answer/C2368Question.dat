20090309180221AAKqkRu	Education & Reference;Words & Wordplay	Is your local highschool as big of a hypocrite as the one in my town?	My local high school has a big sign at the entrance that says it is an alcohol , drug & tobacco free zone. Anybody who is caught with alcohol   or drugs are swiftly punished, suspended etc. Any kid who is caught smoking is swiftly punished also,, But, one thing that is overlooked is   the kids who chew tobacco. It goes on everyday but hardly anyone is    caught. I know a kid who says he chews everyday and doesn't get   caught.      This highschool is hypocrital! They have lock downs where drug sniffing dogs search for drugs and when those kids who have the drugs are caught, they are arrested. So, if the law enforcement is   so intent to keeping this school drug, tobacco & alcohol free,,, then   they need to keep the chewing tobacco out of the school also! They   need to treat chewing tobacco just like the drugs,, have the sniffer dogs sniff it out and punish these kids!      There are web pages that says that chewing tobacco can cause lip,   tongue and throat cancer! There is a web page that says chewing tobacco is worse than smoking ciggs (even though ciggs are very dangerous too).      So, to all Highschools,,, if you want to be a drug free, alcohol free and   tobacco free,,,make sure that chewing tobacco is included!      What do you all think about this? Is there any of you out there who have highschools as hypocritical as the school in my town?

She likes to criticize everything all the celebrity life (who wouldn't) and etc.    Then one day, I told her that I had to retake a State test (just one section, thank the Lord) and she flipped like the world was going to exploded or something!  I told her I couldn't be in the class because of that and she said, "You're going to be done right? right?"  I nodded and said, "Yeah."  My mind said something different, "Yes your bitchiness."   (sorry for the language)  I think she's worried more about me being not done with a Very long test then anything else..no wait...she carries about if Brad and Angelina adopted/have another baby.        Besides of all that, what do you think or how have you've dealt with this kind of issue?

20090309185502AAbXjPP	Education & Reference;Other - Education	Why Don't Schools Teach This?	Schools teach you so much stuff you could care less about in later life, unless you plan on playing game shows or quizzes the rest of your life... Like how ancient romans got water, how certain types of plants reproduce, how we supposedly evolved from monkeys, how to break atoms in half, etc.  But unless we plan on having a career that deals with this, why do we learn it?  IMO they should teach basic history, science, etc. in college if you NEED to learn it.      What we should be learning should be like:   What to know when buying a house   how to cook   how to get a decent job   sex ed (they don't allow it in my school)   how to fix your broken car   how to avoid scams   what will happen when you don't pay your bills   stress management   how to save money   how to mail stuff   how to be mature in junior high (some of my friends have gotten in trouble because of sexual harassment, harassment, cyber bullying, trying to get nude photos from people around the world via text msg., etc.)            I know this may sound stupid, but if they taught this in school, rather than how much a bear weighs, I think many people would be much better off

"Books are the best of things,well used; abused, among the worst. What is the right use?What is the one end,which all means go to effect? They are for nothing but to inspire. I had better never see a book,than to be warped by its attraction clean out of my own orbit, and    Is more valuable than anything else? Men are great because books are available to eduacate and expand the mind   ?         make a satellite instead of a system.The one thing in the world, of value,is the active soul.This every man is entitled to; this every man contains within him, although, in almost all men,obstructed, and as yet unborn."

And there was no more reason for anything"      -Twilight Series      "There's a moment when I look at you and no speech is left in me. My tongue breaks, then fire races under my skin and I tremble and grow pale... for I am dying of such love, or so it seems to me"       -Sappho

I recently cut my hair into a 2 1/2 inch Mohawk for state playoffs and now I like the way it looks and don't want to change it. She says there is something about it in the hand book but the only time it even mentions hair is it is unacceptable when referencing alcohol, drugs, chemical abuse, criminal gang activity, or impedes my education which it does none of those. Is there a law or something in Oklahoma that I can cite to make her shut up or can some one provide a logical argument for me? Thanks!

Porque las actividades están dise?adas no solamente para entretener y divertir a los ni?os, sino que tienen la finalidad de desarrollar capacidades que durante el a?o escolar no se atienden de la misma manera. En talleres como teatro y literatura lo que se intenta es que los ni?os reconozcan sus emociones y encuentren una forma de expresarlas de una manera más eficaz. Los talleres de pintura, ceramica y creatividad artística les ayudan a desarrollar su inventiva y autoestima. El curso de verano ofrece un ambiente más relajado y divertido, pero aún así de respeto.

Regarding the Hawaiian Island Chain, why are some of the islands dormant(inactive), while others (like Loihi) are extremely active?      a. The two plates that are splitting apart along the Hawaiian Island   chain has collapsed at some locations and are still open to form new   islands at other locations.   b. The bigger islands cause a collapse of the lithosphere below creating   a split in the ocean floor, the smaller islands cannot do this.   c. The Pacific plate slides over a region of the mantle that comes to   the surface. Depending on where the plate is located determines what   islands are active or not.   d. Scientists are still unsure as to why some are dormant and others are   active.

20081004153629AAdbyjS	Education & Reference;Primary & Secondary Education	I feel like everyone hates me?	Lately in school I've felt like everyone hates me (I'm in Year 10 and have been with mostly the same people since year 7). For the past few days, it seems like most of my friends have been quite horrible to me by their dull tone of voice and sarcasm towards me which has been putting me down. Even most of my teachers seem to have something against me and I don't know if it could be because they think I'm 'a little nerd' when I'm not or what. Like I asked one teacher what we were going to do next lesson, and he was like, 'Oh don't worry there will be plenty of work for you to do, you won't be bored'. I took that negatively as if I loved recieving work to do (I don't btw). I don't believe that I am stuck up or think that I'm better than everyoneelse because I know I'm not but maybe I've been doing things unconsciously? I have a quiet personality and so I don't talk much but I know I can be quite loud and eccentric at times outside the classroom with my friends.   I don't like feeling disliked and I don't know if its just me.    Any ideas on how I can resolve my problems or advice on how to find out if someone just hates me for a totally different reason?

20080707162213AA1FUFX	Education & Reference;Quotations	Are these any good? best answer to first answer.?	Trusting people takes alot of courage, loving someone takes alot of confidence && hurting someone takes alot of guts<3       Sometimes I wonder if love is worth fighting for, but then I remember your face and I'm ready for war.       Heaven's not a place that you go when you die. It's that moment in life when you actually feel alive       Why am i so scared to loose you when you were never mine in the firstplace?       Love is when you get up and walk all the way across the room to sharpen your pencil just to walk by them and when you get there, you find out its a mechnical pencil.       Don't let today's disappointments cast a shadow on tomrrows dreams.       The only place where dreams are impossible is your own mind.       To the world you may be one person, but to one person you may be the world.       NO man is worth your tears, and the only one who is won't make you cry.       It takes a couple seconds to say Hello, but forever to say Goodbye       if you were a scab, I'd pick you!

20081007182418AAeu801	Education & Reference;Teaching	Need Spanish advice (not homework help, just advice)?	I am a sophmore in highschool and I have never had to try to get A's in my entire life. However, upon entering spanish 2 last year I found it very very hard and struggled with B's which greatly damaged my GPA and class ranking. This year i am beginning spanish 3 and dont want the same thing to happen. I can pass daily work no problem but I always do terrible when it comes to test (which I believe are about 50% of our grade) and I do not understand why.  One night I studied for six hours and even found out which questions from the review would be on the test that morning in tutorials and I entered the test with complete confidence that I would ace it. Upon receiving my grade I found I made a 66 and I was completely dumbfounded.  My question too you is what can I do to improve my spanish speaking and understanding ability? I can look at a spanish sheet and have no idea what the sentences say or even turn them into a coherent thought. The teacher moves very fast and if you fall behind you have a very small chance of catching up and I am way behind. I've tried asking him for help but he is only 21 and likes to joke around more then help. On top of that when I try to ask for help understanding from fellow students I just cant grasp what they are saying and apply it to spanish.  Am I trying to be too methodical? Is it my mindset? Do I just not think about it the right way? I struggle way too much with spanish and I know its not that hard but there is just something in me that wont catch on, please please share with me some advice that can help me understand?
