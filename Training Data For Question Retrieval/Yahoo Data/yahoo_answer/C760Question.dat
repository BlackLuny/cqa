We can't seem to shake them no matter how many home remedies we try.      My question is this: can we just ignore the fact that they're there, and eat the worm-infested food anyway? Would there be any ill effects of consuming, probably, 20-30 larvae per day?      We're not squeamish about it (we overcame this by realizing how much money we were wasting by throwing away full packets of wormy food, and buying more only to have the same thing happen again!), we just want to know if it's safe.

Mi son sentita orgogliosa di me stessa, anche per aver ascoltato il modo in cui, dolcemente, mi hai suggerito di non bere se dovevo guidare, al contrario di quello che mi dicono alcuni amici. Ho fatto una scelta sana ed il tuo consiglio è stato giusto. Quando la festa e finita, la gente ha iniziato a guidare senza essere in condizioni di farlo. Io ho preso la mia macchina con la certezza che ero sobria. Non potevo immaginare, mamma, ciò che mi aspettava... Qualcosa di inaspettato! Ora sono qui sdraiata sull'asfalto e sento un poliziotto che dice: "Il ragazzo che ha provocato l'incidente era ubriaco". Mamma, la sua voce sembra così lontana...
