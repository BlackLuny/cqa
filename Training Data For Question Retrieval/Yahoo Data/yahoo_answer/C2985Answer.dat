In turn, and as several other answerers have noted, Earth's temperature is determined by the balance of incoming solar to outgoing terrestrial radiation.     There are 3 primary ways to affect this energy balance and so cause the climate to change. The first and most obvious way is by changing the amount of solar radiation reaching the planet. This can happen either through variations in solar output or by changes in Earth's orbit around the sun (called the Milankovitch cycles).     The second way is by changing the amount of solar radiation that is reflected by Earth's surface; primarily by changes in land cover (the movement of land masses, the charge and retreat of ice sheets, etc) and atmospheric composition.     The third and, to the current discussion, most important way is by changes in the capacity for terrestrial radiation to move from the atmosphere to space. This is caused by the atmosphere's ability to absorb some wavelengths of light and is called the greenhouse effect.    So in short, climate change in is driven by the Earth's energy balance. This balance can be affected by changes in the amount of radiation reaching the Earth, and changes in the amount of radiation leaving the Earth. Of the examples above, the first is currently observed to not be happening (changes in insolation), the second is either a result of other changes in Earth's energy budget, or takes place on timescales not relevant to the current change, leaving the third as the only probable cause of the current climate change.|`|nunZMnhWaa	This link from your list clearly shows relevance to temps if you use the corrected GISS chart instead of the original one that was found faulty.    http://www.pmodwrc.ch/pmod.php?topic=tsi...  http://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/graphs...|`|zDeFibxzaa	you have most of the explanations you need although in my opinion,its from the spike in co2 and the  ice that reflects heat,the ice is melting and ice or white reflects heat whereas dark objects retain heat.its started and its too late now to reverse this.large scale scrubbers and someway to replenish the ice sheets and glaciers would be our only hope in my opinion!|`|AA10097817	Either do any of your links. Why do you want our answers when you seem to have all the answers you need?|`|f57f19afc977beb390488d1a707b7b00aa	most of your links tell facts...it is correct...but find more essence for those links... just an advice... ^_^|`|20f3291b9320a302e9070bf55325531daa	Basically it's when there's an imbalance between the incoming and outgoing energy on Earth.  If there is more incoming energy that outgoing, the planet will warm.    The primary causes of these energy imbalances are the Milankovitch Cycles, variations in solar output, and greenhouse gases.    Over the past 30 years, the dominant forcing has been from greenhouse gases, particularly CO2.|`|9fbe56a44d7b6024062aa6bacbc528e4aa	The primary reason is there's a global energy imbalance, meaning that there is more energy entering the earth's atmosphere than there is escaping.  This imbalance is primarily a result of greenhouse gases emitted by human actively on the planet that is impeding the escape of long-wave electromagnetic radiation into space. The imbalance is causing the atmosphere, cryosphere and hydrosphere to warm thereby altering the normal energy transfer processes that give us our climate.|`|x7qtyglzaa	The general state of the Earth's climate is largely affected by how much heat is stored in the atmosphere. Processes which affect this storage of heat can cause the climate of the Earth to change. It is not just man-made pollution of the atmosphere which can cause climate change. Changes in the amount of greenhouse gases in the air have occurred naturally during the history of the Earth, leading to climate changes. Changes in the way ocean water circulates around the world can also influence climate, because the oceans store even more heat than the atmosphere. Changes in the amount of heat from the Sun will affect the Earth's climate too.    Large volcanic eruptions can cause the Earth to cool over a couple of years, because huge amounts of pollution injected in to the air block out a lot more sunlight. This type of climate change can also occur when a large comet or meteorite strikes the Earth. Luckily, this only happens every few million years.    Other processes can change the Earth's climate, but only very, very slowly, over millions of years. When continents move around the world, and when mountains ranges are built, the changing patterns of landmasses affects the way the heat in the atmosphere and in the oceans is stored. Continental drift however, takes millions of years, and so therefore does any climate change caused by it.
AsKWImpQaa	But don't you see?  The number of volcanic eruptions has exactly paralleled the industrial revolution, just to trick us.|`|uRh1xCf8aa	I just fart co2 and it is a little warmer.  When light fart, blue flame a lot warmer|`|AA10101610	While total CO2 emissions from volcano's is refuted time after time it still remains as the main scientific reason behind prehistoric increases in greenhouse gasses that is believable.  To discount the TOTAL amount of toxic gasses emitted by volcano's is to deny that Mother Earth is an unpredictable planet and we understand very little about what does or does not affect the atmosphere.  The Keeling curve is one of about half a hundred different ways of recording atmospheric gasses and is no more or less valid than any other method mainly due to the fact that is has not been in use long enough to Actually have records over 200 years old. Most of its information is based on guess work and only the past 25 years of observations that have very little information to relate to.  Before we all rush into some disastrous course of action more scientific data needs to be collected and analyzed without a preconceived notion of what the results are going to be.|`|nunZMnhWaa	I invite you to take the test!    Restore sanity to an insane world, end the crazy years of liberal extremism.  The central problem here is understanding the relative effects of what are called green house gases.    http://www.geocraft.com/WVFossils/greenh...    This piece gives a fair description of how green house gases function in the atmosphere and their relative strength in retaining heat. For co2 to have the climate effect claimed by the warmers it would need to be almost equal in volume to oxygen which is at about 21%. Water vapor, which can vary from 1 to 3 percent, is much powerful as a retainer of heat than co2 can ever be.

I strongly suspect that this was due to the sulfate clouds cooling the oceans, which were able to absorb more CO2.? When the sulfates fell out and the waters warmed again, the effect went away.    Edit:? The Soviet Union collapsed in 1989 and didn't really recover economically for quite a while, so the association with the Keeling curve isn't as good as for the Pinatubo eruption.? I was around then; maybe you weren't. ;-)
nunZMnhWaa	Coal is already the major fuel used to generate electricity and that is what the green idiots are griping about all the time.|`|luqg92fTaa	What?
TWMUXDhKaa	The more awkward the question the better.|`|xM4CumQoaa	i would answer, but lie about it.
a268bbf5f7d7d4bbb6f43d11ccd29916aa	Be VERY careful.  Some common plastics release toxic vapor when heated.  A friend took a ride to the get well place because of this.  Almost got to move to the dead center of town.|`|2dke6ChJaa	just melt and mould.|`|48846255239e6cfd4e8b805cbae9c844aa	I used to work at a company that made plastic parts, we did what we called re-grind, where the defective parts were ground up and re-melted, but all the products we made were injection molded, thats where the plastic is melted and then forced under pressure into the mold, kinda hard to do at home.  I think your best bet would be to work with plastics that can be heated and vacuum formed. I would guess that 2 liter plastic bottles may be able to be used for projects like this, but you should research it yourself first....    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qc_FZcGzY...    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGBRiYhxR...|`|85e8902f1245b50510d8e2fcf9b2a7b6aa	I wouldn't suggest melting plastic... toxic chemicals can be released into the atmosphere, and your lungs if you are nearby.  any solvent would also be toxic. Your best bet is to recycle the material at a recycling center and don't buy it if it bothers you to be adding more into the environment.

It is possible to sponsor an organisation to help a species, or it is also possible to adopt an animal or make one off donations (most zoo these days are deeply involved in conservation so you could possibly contact one).     If you feel more hands on you can volunteer for conservation work abroad - in most cases though you must pay to do this work as they need the money to run the projects.    I sponsor a charity called The Aspiration Foundation in their gorilla projects, for 7 each month, they also protect many other species. The project I support buys up sections of habitat and protect it, employing the locals as rangers to stop poaching and bush-meat.    http://www.totallywild.net/jaf/index.php|`|1vi7PX0Faa	Don't buy products made out of them.
uAyYRXnvaa	Of course we are.  Some animals have been hunted to extinction (e.g. the NZ moa).  Some have had their environments wiped out with urban development (have you ever seen a poor koala trying to cross a busy 4 lane road?  They don't all make it).  Some have fallen prey to other species introduced by humans (carp are great at taking over river systems and outing the native species). Apart from the meteor that wiped out the dinosaurs, I think we can safely blame ourselves.|`|9f97f8a980cb5aa7360577720efbdd70aa	Yes, definitely.  We destroy native habitats, introduce non-native invasive species, pollute the air, land, and ocean.    Edit...Brad S has no clue what he is talking about...people WERE around when the Dodo was..and we humans were the DIRECT cause of their extinction..people basically killed all of them and ate them!  Also, extinction is a natural thing..but people have sped up the process to an alarming and dangerous rate.  We are wiping out species before their time to go which totally upsets the ecosystem causing a domino effect and causing the extinction of many more species.  Wish people would do their research.|`|MGOFjVnVaa	of course it is. mankind is the most dangerous and destructive  beast on earth.|`|Y43nptlvaa	i agree and disagree. its proven that we don't have the species we have hundreds of years ago but extinction is part of nature. look at the dinosaurs, the dodo bird and many others. humans were not around during that time. i also think that we are overpopulating and i believe that the earth can only support us for so long. I learned this in my Hunter's Safety Class( yes i hunt) ex. if you put 10 deer on an island without predators they will overpopulate and become malnuritioused and die. then the population drops way low and they become healthy again because the food was able to re-grow. Hope i helped|`|uRh1xCf8aa	No.  Species die.  Get over it.|`|L4z1FI5Kaa	The predicted extinction of the honey bee by 2018 is my biggest worry and I don't think we had a hand in that one, for once.|`|X01AUEYxaa	Yes other than hunting animals to extinction they interfere with natures way and cause an imbalance. For instance introducing foreign species to try and control something, thus causing an imbalance in the food chain and natural order and messing everything up! Now humans are even trying to alter natural behavior (eg. serotonin in locusts) to control a natural function and way of life. Does it not occur to the interfering idiots that by doing this it will change far more than what ever subject they are working on via a knock on effect. Mankind is a plague on this earth and if it continues to interfere and endanger nature, like all infestations it will be naturally controlled or wiped out!
mMFJrPbvaa	All heat resistant spores can be killed/neutralized in any furnace.  It just needs to be extremely hot for a longggg amount of time.  It doesn't need to be nuclear.  As long as you have high heat and high pressure for a longg amount of time any "heat resistant" spore can be killed.  Although doing so is probably not efficient.  And no the sun is too hot for anything to survive.
8sxD1qUBaa	No it can be slowed down that's why we are being told to drive our car less and stuff. Global warming is true don't listen to people look all over the world and you will see the climate changing and even if you don't believe in it we have to accept the fact that the climate is changing whether it be because of global warming or not, plenty of research has been done.    Before an ice age the temperatures rise for a little while this could also have been an explanation but scientists have said that its not possible that an ice age is coming even though we are long overdue one the temperature is increasing in a different way not the way it should be before an ice age.|`|EHT04pDIaa	when I step out my back door, my feet break through the crust of snow and my crotch breaks my fall, my feet still dont touch the ground  global warming is a crock of crap|`|Rc9SNllPaa	Try to stop the raining falling or the sun shining.  Take care and best wishes  GOURANGA GOURANGA GOURANGA|`|NjjzRMBRaa	Yes, because warming and cooling of the earth has been going on since the dawn of time.  Why would it be different this time?  Because the liberals say so.  C'mon.  Study science and you will see this is another liberal activist business.  They have been doing this for decades.|`|icDLvpDoaa	Yes, but this is only man-kinds case, there have been natural ones in the past, we have to keep a balance, we have to restore what we have destroyed and let nature run itself again. Or we can make sure that we can make changes in our society,habits, and new ways of keeping nature with us.   Examples might be:  new energy sources that don't harm life.  Renewing resources as quickly as we use them.  Or making waste into an energy|`|nunZMnhWaa	Over the last 8,000 or so years that we have good documentation for it always has and there is no reason it will not do so again. You must remember we are currently well below the average of the last 10,000 years by .2c and below the maximum of the same period by almost 1.5c. but considering it has taken us almost 150 years to get as warm as we currently are instead of the normal 50 to 60 years to get even warmer it is very unlikely were will even reach the Holocene average this time around let alone the maximum.|`|vao46STkaa	I suggest you watch the movie "An Inconvenient Truth". It is a long movie but very interesting if you ae concerned with global warming. If you want the short answer then Yes it can be reversed by cutting back on the manmade emissions put into the atmosphere. Our atmosphere will eventually heal itself.|`|mc9M9kvsaa	yes make al gore give the money back|`|73d140d83d29234efdfa2c38e0168b47aa	It has never started. Thermometers of 100 years ago was not very accurate. To see a 1 deg F. change over a period of 100 years would be difficult with one of our present day thermometers.There is nothing to give a hint of accuracy. The real problem is it is a lie meant to deceive.|`|MGOFjVnVaa	nature will reverse it, the question is whether mankind will  be around still.|`|08f47edd63e0224660f6c3d00e0c5830aa	We had three decades of global cooling from 1940's to 1970's.
