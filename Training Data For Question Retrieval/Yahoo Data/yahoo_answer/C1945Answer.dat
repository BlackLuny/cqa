Then we could look it up for you and send you a link.    You will have to call or email the maker of your computer.  Or use the help on your computer to tell you the steps to turning it on.  Many IM programs like Yahoo Messenger or Skype all have built-in webcam features which will allow you to use your camera online.
Z7ZE1lAJaa	Go to AT&T website and you can find it there.  You will need the model  
fwnqB0dTaa	It's a messenger system that also allows cheap/free calls to be made to other Skype users.    You don't have to have a headset to use Skype, as you can simply use it as a messenger (as in AIM, MSN etc) but that takes away the point for having it.    You also don't need a headset if your PSP has a built in microphone ... I use Skype on my laptop and the built in speakers/microphone are perfectly adequate for Skype purposes.|`|ktCFG0tMaa	If you have a skype account you can talk to other people who are on Skype. Only the new slim PSP's have the microphone built in.

XrGFZ2LJaa	No, I'm not going to play the demo of Empire: Total War from Steam. I already have faith that it's going to be fantastic, and very soon I'm placing my pre-order down for the 'Special Forces Edition'.|`|XQOB6eaUaa	the game's really cool<br>  <br>  tried the demo
D52bRqQWaa	Get one they are amazing.  Basically the 40GB 80GB, 160GB is just the HDD size all the latest PS3 SKU's have 2 USB Ports WiFi Built in, Blu Ray Player, Play and Charge Kit, Sixaxis dsualshock 3 controller, Free Online Play, Remote Connection, Internet Browser, PlayStation Home.  All new Models have the same but just different HDD sizes.  The PS3 can have remopte connection with your psp so you can access all data on your PS3 from anywhere in the world. The PS3 also has a accessory called Play TV in the UK and has the ability to recieve freeview channels, record, pause and rewind them. The PS3 also has a bluetooth headset and bluetooth keyboard that has a touch pad on it for the mouse in the internet browser. If you go on PSN you can talk to your friends and even play them online for free, you can also download and go on PSN home where you can explore a 3d world and talk to ps3 users and have your own apartment and customize it, you can be part of clubs and chat to people all over the world.   The PS3 out of the is what you pretty much need unless you want the keyboard or want to talk to people on voice chat. PSN is free all you have to do is have an account and then yoiu can play online, the console include rechargable bettery pack built into the pad so you don't need to keep buying batterys|`|VcNHahtgaa	With there only being 80GB and 160GB in the market right now, I can tell you what's inside the box.      Online gaming and internet on the PS3 is FREE. You just need to enter your Wifi code or plug in the ethernet. You can plug in the wireless keyboard if you want to surf the internet without using your computer.    You can play all your playstation 1 games, but not the PS2 games because they removed it.     You can watch Blu-Ray movies and DVD movies on your PS3 as well. If you play a DVD movie, it would look better slightly than on a regular DVD player.     Online gaming means like your playing games with other people, like playing WoW, Runescape or Maplestory but not an MMORPG. Like if you play online for a shooting game, you can play with other people. There are games coming out soon that ARE MMORPG though for PS3 and PC only.|`|HekFanRvaa	everything what you said about what it is, is true.. blu-ray player, hard drive, online (built-in wifi) , plays PS2 or PS1 etc. The latest models (80 & 160GB)  are not backwards compatible with PS2 anymore but still plays PS1 games.    PS3 system comes in a complete package (includes all cables and basic acceessories to get you started). It's unpack and play. you just need to buy games of course.|`|LSXdwRDUaa	Just go to wikipedia my friend.   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ps3|`|1WgOj89kaa	OK, there are different models of the PS3, 20GB, 40GB, 80GB and the limited edition 160GB model. All models above are built in with WIFI, meaning that if you have a wireless router, for example, you have Sky Broadband or Tiscali, you can connect your PS3 to the internet and play online entirely for free with no subscriptions. That answers the online question. It is a blu ray disc player, all of the games are blu ray, and it can also play DVDs, this is all in all, the cheapest blu ray disc player out there. Every model can play playstation 1 games but only select models can play ps2 games, like the 20 and 40GB Models. Overall, the online experience is fantastic, you can add all of your friends, send messages at any time, talk to them through the ps3 headset accessory and also, there are so many fantastic games coming out fr the PS3 this year like Killzone 2, Hitman 5, along with present titles such as Uncharted, Resistance 1 and 2. Overall, the PS3 is an amzing console which if you have the first 2 playstations, you have simply got to have.

w7Ffw6MYaa	Here is how it works: <br>  <br>  1.) download mobile e-mail from your phone, you will be asked to subscribe to Virgin XL, go ahead and subscribe it will cost you 15 cents (don't worry you can unsubscribe after you are done).  <br>  2.) go through the download process (don't worry, its completely free to download-except for standard messaging charges of course.)<br>  3.) Messaging packs include the following:<br>            (+) text messages<br>            (+) picture messages<br>            (+) video messages (only on Shuttle)<br>            (+) mobile e-mail messages<br>            (+) mobile instant messages<br>  4.) The mobile e-mail application won't take up much memory either. <br>  5.) So if you have a messaging pack, you won't have to worry about extra charges :-)<br>  <br>  Hope this helps :-)
rvMxaNAraa	Yeah, that sounds a little 'hanky' I think its just the ipod. But, if it is TJ max, I wouldn't think you could sue considering you are on their property. Retail stores are not public property and TJ max can do almost anything as long as it doesn't violate your civil liberties. Radio Shake has a cell phone blocker in their stores for all cell companies but the ones they sell. I suppose if TJ Max is taking your personal info off your device then that would be something more serious. But I don't think that what you are describing is something that can even be done. I mean the system monitoring your device would have to be able to recognize each individual song that you are playing within the first few words and be able to distinguish between different styles of music within that time as well. That would be a lot trouble for something that could easily be dealt with by telling you to simple turn down your music. <br>  Also the ipod touch, as do the other ipods, has a feature called 'sound check' meaning that the ipod will automatically play the song to a preset volume especially if you downloaded all your music from itunes that is probably the cause. This feature can be shut off in the 'settings' menu.|`|DEkQe6Zpaa	That's creepy.  Lol.  Maybe something's interfering with the signal?|`|4pRDlRxgaa	Maybe your ipod just doesn't like reggae or rap.|`|SROfl8Dmaa	You just might be crazy... :/<br>  Go home, plug it into itunes, and restore it. <br>  It should work fine after that.|`|i6uzNQcJaa	huh? i have no idea what you mean...i think you must be accidently turning the volume down

LXRaT8D2aa	Yes, There is a narrator reading you the book and iTunes treats it just like a long song. It works for play on your iTunes, as well as your ipod. I've purchased many.

If that does not work, are you using Limewire or other sites like that? try buying songs from iTunes and see if that works, if ur not already. If none of that works try restoring ur iPod- which sucks.

You can take your memory card to one of their stores and the prints should be ready in about two hours or less.<br>  <br>  The following information describes a better way to move/copy photos to and from a computer and memory card.<br>   <br>  Just received some pictures in an e-mail which I moved to the computer.  Then copied these pictures to a memory card and could view them on my camera or show on TV.<br>    <br>  If your computer has memory card slots, find the correct slot and copy pictures from the memory card to the computer.<br>   <br>  If there are no memory card slots on your computer or the slots don't work with your memory card, purchase a Targus card reader at Walmart for $8.88 or another brand for less at Ritz/Wolf/Kit camera.  Also, they do 3? x 5" digital prints for 6￠ each on Tuesday and Wednesday.<br>   <br>  CAUTION   To prevent memory card corruption, keep batteries charged and don't delete. Wait for lights to stop flashing then turn camera off before removing memory.  For card readers, double click Safely Remove Hardware.  Select, then click Stop and OK.<br>   <br>  After you have the memory card plugged in, go to My Computer and open the memory card, select the picture you want to copy, and then copy to the My Pictures folder under My Documents under Documents and Settings.<br>   <br>  If you have trouble with this, it may be easier to right click on Start and then left click Explore. Find and select the picture you want to copy and then at top left, click the X next to Folders to see a place to select Copy Files.  Now select the My Picture folder.  Make and select a sub folder then click Copy.<br>   <br>   <br>  You can also copy from the computer to a memory card. <br>   <br>  Have just been playing with this and found that it works really well, but you should first format the memory card in the camera because it adds files to the card you will need.<br>   <br>  Next, take a picture of something with the camera.<br>   <br>  Place the memory card in the card reader and go to My Computer. <br>   <br>  Open the memory card and you should see a folder on the left (DCIM) that has your picture. Do not open the MISC folder on the right.<br>   <br>  Double Click on the DCIM folder and you should see another folder e.g.,100HPM417, which includes the name of your camera.  Double Click on that folder and you should see the picture you just took.<br>   <br>  When you copy from the computer to a memory card, that is the folder where your pictures must be copied. You may only be able to copy one picture at a time.<br>   <br>  One last thing, the file names of your pictures must not have any additional letters or those pictures will not be seen by the camera.  Also, the file name format must match the file name of the picture you took e.g., HPIM1903.  Rename files to the same format as your camera photos.<br>   <br>  If you have trouble with this, it may be easier to right click on Start and then left click Explore. Find and select the pictures you want to copy and then near the top left, click the X next to Folders to see a place to select Copy files.

EfejPjIMaa	At this point the PSP-2000 is good.  The PSP-3000 (or Brite) does have a better screen, which tends to use more battery because the screen takes more battery to run, and also the screen is having problems with visible scanlines and jagged edges on moving objects, which Sony is saying is not a defect.  <br>  <br>  If you can handle the visible scanlines and jagged edges, than get the Brite.  Otherwise go with the 2000 series.  <br>  <br>  As far as the Memory Stick Pro Duo, all PSP's recognize up to 16GB (you will have to update the firmware on a PSP-1000 or PSP-2000 in order for the PSP to recognize the 16GB Pro Duo).|`|sFz6v7Ohaa	The latest PSP is the best one to get, which is the 3000 series.

uBleRdduaa	First go to your wii memory base. DO NOT go to the game cube memory system. Go to the Wii system. Then go to SD card and voila.|`|sY5cptAvaa	the only way to play the music without doing any modification to your wii is to go to the photo channel then set up a slide show, you can then choose the music from the SD card to play during the slide show. Make sure you have the music in the right format though-some versions of the photo channel only support mp3, newer versions only support AAC.
EfejPjIMaa	Your problem is with your router or your internet connection, not the PS3.  Of course when you look at the signal it says 100%.  What does it say when it disconnects?  You don't know because you can't see the connection signal strength when it disconnects.  <br>  <br>  Your router could be resetting, or your modem could be resetting.  Your internet could be cutting out.  Your signal might be dropping too low and disconnecting the PS3, someone could be stealing your signal, your modem may be going out (I have had to replace my modem because of it going out).  There are many reasons you could be losing a signal, but since you said your losing complete internet in your home, that means it has nothing to do with the PS3.  <br>  <br>  You can figure out why your internet is having problems by calling your ISP, or calling LinkSys if you think the router is the problem.  You can also hook up the PS3 with an ethernet cord straight to the modem.  If your internet does the same thing again, then for sure it is your ISP or modem.|`|sFz6v7Ohaa	Reset your internet your equipment such as your router and modem, by unplugging and replugging them. If that doesn't work, go to the official PlayStation Website, and download the update via a storage device such as a USB Drive or an iPod. <br>  <br>  The System Software Update for the PS3 is located here:<br>  <a href="http://www.us.playstation.com/Support/SystemUpdates/PS3/pc_update.html#update_PC" rel="nofollow">http://www.us.playstation.com/Support/Sy...</a><br>  <br>  By the way, you might want to update your router to a more current one. I had this router before and had the same problem.

b8e3dd68b7fdbbbac6132e0c73015651aa	Wow- a Canon AE-1.  That's a Classic!<br>  <br>  They are both fine cameras.  Unless you have a selection of great Canon lenses that you want to use on your new digital SLR, the field is wide open.<br>  In addition to the Canon XT and Nikon D40- you could look at the Pentax K10D or Sony (formerly Minolta) A100 which both have image stabilization built in.  (sorry- I just made your decision harder)<br>  <br>  Many people choose the Nikon D40 if for no other reason than the availability of a terrific, compact, reasonably priced Nikon 18-200mm zoom lens.  (giving you 28-300mm effective zoom range as compared to a 35mm film camera).  And- the regular kit lens on the Nikon has been reviewed repeatedly as noticeably better than the kit lens on the Canon.  So- if you buy the Canon- stay away from the kit lens.<br>  <br>  If I were you- I'd got to a store and hold each one in your hand and peer through the viewfinders to see which one feels more comfortable for you.  performance wise- they're so nearly identical that it doesn't matter.<br>  <br>  Here's somebody else's thoughts comparing the two:<br>  <a href="http://forums.dpreview.com/forums/read.asp?forum=1000&message=22921373" rel="nofollow">http://forums.dpreview.com/forums/read.a...</a>|`|2P4eeeVeaa	The Canon is generally considered to have a superior CMOS sensor in it, compared to the CCD chip in the Nikon.<br>  <br>  The Canon suffers from less noise at higher ISOs which means you can shoot in low light at higher ISOs without degrading the quality of the photo too much.<br>  <br>  However the Nikon is bundled with a better quality lens than the Canon so it will produce sharper photos out of the box.<br>  <br>  The Nikon is also a lot chunkier than the Canon, as a previous poster suggested it's a very good idea to try them in a shop, personally I find the Canon far too small to hold as my fingers knock together as I move the lens and hold the grip.<br>  <br>  If you are looking at getting better quality lenses it may be worth looking to invest in a Canon 30D (or even secondhand 20D) body and get a better quality lens. If they are out of your price range though I would have to recommend the Nikon for it's handling and superior bundled lens (much as it pains me - I'm a Canon fan!).<br>  <br>  Hope that helps :o)

Si j'en étais parti au départ, c'était à cause du prix, si j'en suis revenu, c'est pour des question de fiabilité, de simplicité voire, de convivialité...<br>  <br>  Les offres d'Orange, même si elles tendent à devenir aussi compliquées que les autres restent simples et gravitent autour de quelques principes qui répondent, je le pense à tous les besoins, mobicarte, compte bloqué, forfait de base et forfait avec tout compris...<br>  <br>  La convivialité, ce sont, des services ou des offres qui s'adaptent davantage aux clients que les clients ne sont obligés de se plier à elles<br>  <br>  Et contrairement à SFR par exemple, les forfaits ne sont pas des usines à gaz où il faut presque parfois deviner comment on est facturés, prenez la visio par exemple, chez Orange, elle est inclue partout, chez SFR, dans les forfaits de base, c'est hors forfait, , dans les forfaits pros, c'est inclus mais il faut savoir qu'une minute de visio décomptent deux minutes sur les forfaits, dans les forfaits 100% si c'est un forfait 2h c'est hors forfait c'est c'est 3h et plus c'est inclus...<br>  <br>  Avec Bouygues et SFR, j'ai appris à mes dépends que tout ce qui brillait n'était pas or, et si les prix d'appels était brillant, tout le reste après devenait payant, roaming, multimédia, sms, mms, etc... qui peut en fonction des besoin directement être inclus dans les forfaits que l'on aura choisi en fonction de l'utilisation qu'on pourra en avoir, ...<br>  <br>  Les réseaux sont sensiblement les mêmes en matière de pourcentage de couverture, on dira qu'il y en a qui couvrent là  où d'autres ne vont pas... en gros des points faibles et des points forts partout...<br>  <br>  Bref, pour moi depuis presque le début, c'est Itineris / Orange, aujourd'hui, avec le recul, j'en suis content, 46 € par moi pour un forfait tout compris, non pas que je téléphone beaucoup mais je fais n'importe quoi avec et dans la mesure où je gère, je n'ai jamais de mauvaise surprise, téléphone depuis l'étranger inclus, sms, mms, multimédia tous les appels vers Orange sont illimités entre 8 heures et 18 heures et dans le forfait pro, il y a la possibilité de faire des conférences jusqu'à 5 ou 6 personnes... l'option est gratuite...<br>  <br>  Bref, HEUREUX chez Orange et j'y reste|`|67d77873afa2d72379dad3a9386645c6aa	tele2|`|KxFTcP7Vaa	je suis chez SFR depuis que j'ai mon tout premier portable c'est a dire il ya 8 ans et je n'ai jamais eu aucun probleme ni de raiseau ni autre SFR c'est le meilleur fourniseur de raiseau mobile|`|f3aac9ee16331dc2e84828aa544ac9a9aa	sfr est vraiment tres bien mais jaime beaucoup  moins orange bouygue jamais essaye mais sa a l air pas mal|`|qppp0kfwaa	Moi je suis chez Bouygues à la carte et j'ai opté pour la formule spot ?a permet de téléphoner vers les fixes et les mobiles Bouygues gratuitement.

Numark Cue, M-Audio Torq, and Traktor Scratch allow to to auto-cue songs with just a click of the button, and Torq and Traktor can open playlists from iTunes, so you can play whole mixes you've already created.  They're pretty stable, and can get pretty advanced, if you ever want to start using effects, or scratching.  <br>  <br>  A trial version of Numark Cue can be downloaded from their website at the link below.  If you choose to purchase, be sure and ask if it's the newer, Mac-compatible version -- the first release was only good with Windows.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.numark.com/contentmgr/showdetails.php/id/1109/tt/5" rel="nofollow">http://www.numark.com/contentmgr/showdet...</a><br>  <br>  You can also look into iPod mixers -- Numark has the D2 (pronounced d-squared), a 19-inch dual CD players that will mix two songs from one iPod.  Later this month they will release the IDJ2, which also allows you to mix two songs off one iPod, but in a more traditional battle-style mixer.  <br>  <br>  Here's the D2:<br>  <a href="http://www.platinum-records.com/numark-hardrive-player-usb-ipod-prod7575.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.platinum-records.com/numark-h...</a><br>  <br>  and the IDJ2:<br>  <a href="http://www.platinum-records.com/numark-ipod-dj-mixer-prod7570.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.platinum-records.com/numark-i...</a><br>  <br>  As you can see, you have a lot of options.

77kxnSfdaa	Technically you can! - however a sub-woofer cannot be plugged into a regular speaker output due to the fact that they are made and designed for low freq. sound.  If you hook  up a sub to a regular outlet you will hear sound, but don't expect it to be ground pounding bass - the speaker will only produce sound matching the amount of watts that are fed into it - also  since they have 'filters' the only thing you'll hear will be low freq. signals (bass), you will not hear mids and highs - this means the sound will not be clear.<br>  <br>  Another thing you might want to keep in mind is that you may damage your stereo system if you hook up a speaker and/or sub with a wrong ohm rating (higher or lower).<br>  <br>  If this is for Car Audio - get an amplifier and plug it in to the appropriate channel. If this is for Home Audio, same rules apply - plug into proper channel.   <br>  <br>  - Johnny|`|44cf909f13bd08c885634a167eaf9fb0aa	Home or car?<br>  <br>  Powered or passive?<br>  <br>  If you edit the question I might be able to help.

It adds to the enjoyment of recorded music.  A sub woofer requires additional power to drive the speaker.  It is usually self contained and has a separate power source.  The signals to the subwoofer are directed by an amplifer that is designed to feed a subwoofer.<br>  <br>  No you can not connect a subwoofer to a "regular" speaker output.  It needs a separate output designed for that purpose.<br>  <br>  You can enjoy how great music can sound with a subwoofer.  All you need is a great amp that is congifured for it.<br>  <br>  Not a big deal.

This estimate is based on 128kbps (bitrate) 4minute songs.|`|e1a453f133f0993448a17b4de93b4a0baa	about 125, depending on the size of the songs
cilYUWgtaa	Call your neighbor and have them buzz you up. If you're wondering if there's a way to hack an apartment's intercom keypad, I'm sure there is, but it's probably illegal and you'd probably be on camera doing as much. The other thing you can do is call the property manager and see if there's a way to get a replacement key..
92a5d9f7c40dbec7dc7ef3c068fb1505aa	I have used both generations and the 2nd gen is the best! The speakers are a great feature. There are so many free apps that make the ipod touch a lot more useful! it is almost like a mini computer!  And don't forget to get a cover to protect it from damage!|`|k9xWho36aa	the first gen doesnt have speakers, and the second does. the speakers sound pretty good. the second also has a silver rim. some of the sounds they make (when you plug it into the computer, when you turn it off, when you type, etc...) are slightly different but thats not a big deal. also the first gen comes with an older software version and you need to pay about $10 to update it, whereas the second gen could update for free. that's basically all there is =)|`|XJwiFPg5aa	I have the ipod touch 2g the speaker works good but it doesnt go as loud as speakers would the volume conntrol on the sides really good and useful i didnt have the 1g but i read that it was  anoying not having the sound buttons on the side. i recommend it XD|`|SoR6DQvRaa	I  love it but i get it taken away for my math grade all the time i love it sounds amazing hahah battery goes low a lot so in advance dont turn it off unless finished for the day so just put it on sleep mode hit the top button once dont hold it down|`|TWV0DT9kaa	ya its class i use it with the docking station most of the time. no more cd woohoo. you can download aps and stuff two well worth it. not 2 sure about its shuffle tho. it seems to be a bit biased towards some bands i tink anyway|`|FfrptcARaa	my friend had the first one and i had the second generation and i think there isnt much diffeence except for the fact that second generation has speakers and is thinner than first generation.|`|bqlvntzEaa	The second generation iPod Touch is way better. Better sound quality and everything. Definetly more improvments from the first. BUY IT!!!!|`|pMkLynSHaa	I don't have it|`|LF5z6JdRaa	Nope, but the sound quality isn't that great as to Sony Walkman products - but the average user won't notice that.<br>  <br>  Also you need iTunes to sync with computer, however there are alternarives such as Songbird. I have suggested an alternative because Apple keeps release bigger and bigger installation packages for iTunes [current one larger than 60MB].<br>  Another thing is during the installation on Apple software, from my experience in the past, deselecting applications that I do not want to be installed on my computer, have ended up being installed. For example the Bonjour Service and Apple Update Software.<br>  <br>  If you plan not to buy an Apple product, I would personally wait for Sony's X-series walkman to be released.<br>  This is my opinion, that m*ct*r*s will disagree to.|`|t2qSCCfPaa	I love mine. The speakers are an awesome feature when you're listening with friends, or don't have the headphones with you. The picture quality when you watch a movie is amazing. Plus it has a ton of memory, so you can have lots of songs and movies, and other apps like games.

Example, I have a SanDisk Sansa e280 8GB MP3 Player, it was only $149.99 and the new 8GB iPod Nano is $199.99.  It is stupid to pay so much.  My MP3 Player came with video, FM Radio, FM Recorder, Microphone, Photo, Rhapsody Channels and a MicroSD expansion slot for endless music!  The iPod Nano comes with, Photo, video, and music.  And you're paying more.  It is down right stupid for people to buy them, and people buy them to "fit in with the crowd" because everyone else has them, and you will be cool if you have one, but you won't believe how many people have responded to my MP3 player for getting such a great deal, what it comes with, what it does, how nice and stylish it looks!  I get just as much or even more attention than the iPod owners because those people see so many people with iPods all the time!  And now, they have seen something different and they like it!

4Pk6VNftaa	In all honesty, it would take HUNDREDS of hours of displaying a static image to experience burn-in.  It's not really a big issue so long as you give your TV a variety of things to display.  Playing video games won't be a problem - just don't leave the screen paused for long periods of time.  If you need to pause the game for more than, say, 10-15 minutes, flip on a sports game or something else that has lots of fast motion in it.<br>  <br>  Both the PS3 and 360 have built-in screen dimmer and screen saver features as well, so be sure you configure them.|`|5GMmeC4yaa	Give it about three months.  At that point,  you will still have to be careful about burn in,  but it will take a few hours for an image to retain itself on the screen.

Go to BT/shop.com and choose the best handsets that work for you.|`|e08eab35a22f0c6bf7f5ba2c6c22c1f9aa	search google for uk electronic devices stores.|`|AA12180617	John Lewis do a BT or cable & wireless set with 6 and 1 ..    OR you could buy the basic 3 to 1 set from anywhere then buy extra handsets to make up to 6|`|AA11256390	I think the maximum you'll get on a domestic phone line is 4 handsets. As far as I know it's down to the REN (Ringer Equivalence Number) basically all telecoms equipment connected to a phone line has a REN, the max a single line can generally take is 4, most phones are usually 1 or 1.5 so if you put more than 4 on a line it will overload it and cause problems with the equipment functioning properly.|`|R5LJiO6raa	there you go  http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B0017...
qGfAlDd2aa	You are correct, the mast needs to be grounded for lightning protection.  Use a heavy gage copper wire and route it to a grounding rod.  Make sure there are no sharp bends in the wire and keep it as short as practical.    A grounding block is also a good idea to protect the input to the TV.  They are inexpensive and should also be connected to a grounding rod via a wire with no sharp bends.    Not grounding your antenna and down lead will invite lightning damage to your house and electronic equipment.

d8eb2747aa6627fe7a5b835a16139fa6aa	For watching standard TV, a tube type (CRT) TV will be better for 3 reasons:<br>  <br>  1.  LCDs suffer from a poor viewing angle.  The picture starts to wash out as you move sideways from the screen.  CRTs do not suffer from this problem<br>  <br>  2.  LCDs suffer from motion blur on fast moving scenes.  CRTs do not have this problem.<br>  <br>  3.  If the LCD is an HDTV, watching a standard picture will actually look worse then on a CRT, assuming the CRT is not HD.  Standard TV signals must be converted to display on an HDTV.  Any time you convert something, it loses detail.  A standard CRT TV will display the standard TV signal natively with no conversion necessary.|`|s7Muujxzaa	Well, it will depend a lot what sort of signal you give it or what sort of gaming system is connected.<br>  <br>  An old analog TV is a 480i display whereas what you are looking at is a 720p. So there are quite a few more scan lines displayed during each frame. But if you just connect something to the TV which is standard def, then you will not see a lot of difference.|`|akvrwpywaa	If by regular TV's you refer to traditional CRT's, then you may notice several differences when gaming.<br>  LCD's generally have significantly slower refresh rates and response times, so if it's a fast-action game you might get a little bit of blur; in fact you might even get a bit of lag with an LCD screen too, which certainly won't help.  CRT's generally have better contrast and black depth as well.  Most CRT's produced now are only standard-definition, but back in the early 2000's there were a number of new HD CRT's on the market.  PS3/Xbox 360/Wii will look better on an HDTV since they display at HD-level, but if you have standard-definition cable/satellite/broadcast then you will not get a better picture with an HDTV than you would with a CRT; in fact the CRT will most likely give you a better picture overall.|`|E7szorcwaa	This could take a while :P<br>  <br>  OK technically, a Tube telly (non flat-screen) will almost always look better than any LCD screen, but LCD is better in a few ways<br>  <br>  They can do HD, (i know some tube tvs can but hardly any)<br>  <br>  they are flat :P<br>  <br>  for gaming they will look so much better if you have an Xbox 360 or PS3 or Wii becasue HD is awesome for PS3 and Xbox 360.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  But for watching TV, unless you are getting HD channels the picture will look no better on a LCD screen, probably slighty better on tube.<br>  <br>  Sorry if thats very unhelpful but i wanted to give all angles :p<br>  <br>  good luck :)

qGfAlDd2aa	I have had Dish Network for about 8 years.<br>  <br>  There are a few things at work here.  First, Dish Network is required by law to carry the main channel of each of the local stations if it carries any one of them.  It's either all or nothing.  However the law only requires the main program channel, not the sub channels.<br>  <br>  A station can negotiate for carriage of the sub channels.  This is an individual agreement between the station and the cable / satellite company.  A station may or may not have this sort of agreement in place.<br>  <br>  You probably will not get any sub channels that may be offered unless you subscribe to the HD package.  This is true of just about all of the cable & satellite companies.<br>  <br>  ADDITIONAL ANSWER:  Then, most probably, the subchannels are not carried by Dish Net.|`|nQ7G1nBVaa	Those channels have been broadcast for some time. Dishnetwork is probably not required to carry them, or is opting not to.|`|XEbDD8ruaa	Go into settings and make sure that your television is set up to receive the channels. It is easy to navigate and find the options in the setting folders.<br>  <br>  Email me if you have any questions|`|s7Muujxzaa	First, broadcast digital TV and satellite TV are two totally different things. You have the mistaken impression that the change over to DTV in some way impacts your ability to get your local channels off the satellite. It doesn't.<br>  <br>  I do not have Dish Network, I'm on Directv and they only have the larger market stations carried on the satellite and they WILL NEVER carry the sub-channels that carry 24 hour weather, traffic, etc (channels such as 8-2, etc). I believe that Dish Network would be the same.<br>  <br>  I don't know where you live and so the best thing you are going to be able to do is call Dish Network and resolve this with them. <br>  <br>  If you receiver is similar to the Directv receivers, then there is an off air antenna coaxial input on the back of the receiver so you can connect your own over the air antenna, if you want or need to. That is going to be the ONLY way you will ever get your local digital sub-channels.<br>  <br>  >We cannot get the channels by antenna; that is why we pay to get them. The menu option you mentioned requires an antenna.<br>  <br>  My question is about Dish Network providing paid subscribers the same benefits others get for free.<<br>  <br>  Whatever the case, you will NEVER get sub-channels on Dish, what Dish carries and the transition to DTV have absolutely no relationship to each other, and  whatever your technical problems with Dish, you should be calling them to resolve.

faa71f586463ff66d31b6b6b119ca3a5aa	Assuming the application was downloaded using iTunes, all you have to do is connect your ipod to your computer/laptop and it should sync itself.    If it does not, then iTunes would at least show that your ipod touch is connected (as a device). Usually all you would have to do is click the 'Sync' button at the bottom-right of the the ipod device page (in iTunes) and it should automatically transfer it. If that does not work, you may have to click to the 'Applications' tab of the device page and select which applications you want, then click Sync.    If none of the above work, I dont know what will.    Good luck.    NB: Pls be sure that you have ticked the necessary options so as to not accidentally add/delete music or video files from your iPod.
XJSOToRGaa	Uninstall itunes from your laptop, and then go to apple.com and download/install the latest version.    Without boring you too horribly, there's a section of itunes that allows it to recognize devices, and on many newer devices it needs to be an up-to-date version.  It can also get corrupted, in which case a re-install will also do the trick.    In theory it should not impact your library, but I would back it up just in case.|`|PIuCdeC4aa	Do you have the most recent version of iTunes?  That could be your problem.      Try updating iTunes.|`|LzSj90pbaa	so reinstall itunes on your computer
iLTlJszaaa	There's no need to throw your old analog TV away.  Digital converter boxes are only for picking up signals on analog-only TV's; digital TV's can already process the digital signals.  But if you really don't want your old analog TV anymore and you don't want to go through the hassle and cost of recycling it, I'm sure you can sell it to someone or donate it to a charity.    EDIT:  You say your TV is "too old," meaning it probably doesn't have a standard coaxial input, but rather two RF terminals.  You can use a 300 ohm to 75 ohm balum transformer device to connect your converter box coax to your TV.  You can do the same with the antenna if you're using an old antenna.    http://www.solidsignal.com/prod_display....  http://www.summitsource.com/magnavox-ind...  I have an old TV at home which I did this with, and it works perfectly fine.  My grandmother has an even older TV but has cable, and the cable company did the same thing for her cable.|`|mbqAQAJ7aa	i dont know about the first question but u dont need anything extra on the digital tv, it will automatically pick up the digital signal :)|`|p1dcw35Qaa	You'll still need an antenna on the digital tv (assuming you get your tv signal from an antenna and not from cable or satellite service). If you cable or sat, you can keep your old tv. You may be able to use your old antenna but a rooftop will probably get you more channels. Checkout antennaweb.org. It's a great site that helps you buy an antenna and lets you know what stations your likely to receive with the different antennas (they're color coded when you go to buy one).|`|27db1c7b4afca4f2c644409f620b0bbfaa	your old TV will receive digital channels with a freeview box,  The only problem with your new tv (& freeview box) might be that you need a better aerial or a booster, but best try the current one first.|`|AA10594501	amp9C1 is right. Your TV WILL work with the converter box no matter how old it is. Just tune your TV to channel 3 or 4, and hook it up with a coaxial cable. As he mentioned, you may need the balun, also called an impedence matching transformer, if your set has only the two screw terminals for it's antenna connection.|`|Vl2SOncyaa	I had to play with the fine tuning knob to get the box to operate on my old TV|`|d8eb2747aa6627fe7a5b835a16139fa6aa	OK, first thing is, is this old TV getting it's signals from cable or satellite?  If so, you are unaffected and don't need to do anything to keep enjoying TV.    If you do get your TV signal from an antenna, you should be able to find a converter box for it.    No way your TV is too old to use a converter!  Does your old analog TV have a coax cable input?  If so, the converters will work just fine.  Does it have those twin screw antenna leads?  If so, you merely need to go down to the local Radio shack and get a twin antenna lead to coax cable converter.  See the link below to see what I'm talking about.    Lastly, if you decide to get rid of the old TV, your city may offer a drop off site where you can dispose of it safely.  Check your city's web site for info.
RWVQS0ZRaa	to talk online you have to either press l3 or r3 down (l3 is push the left joystick in r3 is right joystick in) it all depends on what game your playing and where ur ps3 came from (ps it will only show a mic symbol it will not show ur online name)<br>  Source(s):|`|sr5nROuIaa	i works most people just don't talk if they don't know you.
uBleRdduaa	It means you put the disk in backwards.|`|yEZg347Iaa	you should spray Windex on it and then wipe it down with a washcloth
Cl8FwsI2aa	I'm not sure about the apps that are 'really worth' installing on the iPhone. I, myself, have installed quite a few applications and games on my iPhone 3G.    The games that I've installed are Pac-man, Bomberman, Moto Chaser, Crash Kart, Bejeweled 2, Pinball RC, Cro-Mag, Tetris, Monkey Ball, Trism, Fieldrunners, Rolando, Dizzy Bee, Dizzy Bee 2, TapDefense, Darts, Cube Runner and Snooker.    Applications on my iPhone 3G include AroundMe, eBay, Shazam (slick), Flixster Movies, Midomi, Fake-A-Call, BeejiveIM (this ones a must-have if you're a regular MSN user), Wikiamo, Wikipanion and Now Playing.    Bonne chance.|`|5mglrsNsaa	Really it depends on what apps would be useful for you to use on the go. Say, if you lived in London and used the London Underground a lot (like myself), I would recommend TubeDeluxe for 59p (i think).    However, if it's games you like, I have the following that I purchased with no regret:  X-Plane, Super Monkey Ball, MotoChaser, LineRider, Band, Cro-Mag Rally, iCopter, Black Mamba Racing, Asphalt 4, Neverputt.    Other cool apps you could get include Ocarina (a virtual flute but with online features), Fake Call (get out of awkward/boring situations), Face Melter (picture editing), Seismometer (a heartbeat/vibration detection app), Koi Pond (realistic and relaxing fish pond), and mSecure (easy-to-use storage of passwords)    Hope I helped :]
IoKjLtN9aa	It depends on your preferences. If you already have an iPod, I would strongly advice getting an X-box 360. Really - if you expect the iPod touch to be a super fun gaming platform, well frankly it's not, it is fun, but not nearly as much fun as a Computer or Gaming platform. Then again if you don't like video games obviously the iPod touch would be for you. As far as internet with the iPod goes, you can only use it near a wifi connection (your house, friends house, Cafe, etc.) and it isn't as fast as your computer, so really if your at home your going to want to use your computer anyways. <br>  <br>  If you don't have an iPod or another MP3 I would get the iPod touch though. <br>  <br>  Sure iPod touches have all the bells and whistles but really it's still just an iPod.<br>  <br>  If you have any specific questions just e-mail me.|`|hTbvfUOeaa	ps3
qaPyaFUcaa	You can ask if they'll take $300, but if not, $320 is a good deal, but I don't know if I would waste my time for that $20.  You should email them now to make sure you get it before someone else does, at that price it will be scooped up in the first hour.  You'd pay more than that for the wii & wii fit alone.    Why did you even post that here, you should have already been emailing the person.  That is too good of a deal.  A lot of people try to sell just the wii alone for $300 on craigslist.    Even if you don't like the system, you can turn around and sell it on craigslist for close to $500 and make some money on it.|`|yper8qYoaa	Ask for the price to be lower|`|sFPk14Zbaa	Yes ask for the straight $300, that's probably why he's placed the $20 on top (room to haggle)     ps ppl, the first part of his/her question is the original ad. He?she wishes to buy it for $320 or lower!    wow didn't realise it was in dollars, yes I'd say it's defnately a good deal, but haggle for the 20 :D|`|VlP7ESH1aa	wait, i don't really understand what you are asking but here is my input: i think that the $530 that u payed in the beginning was a great price! that was way in-expensive considering all the stuff that came with it. the games normally cost about $50 each and then the different thigs like the mario kart wheel and all that, great deal!|`|L9Ukq04oaa	i have a wii and i think that it was not the greatest deal, and you could have probably buy everything separate for allot less. but selling it for $320 is a good idea.|`|jKc7aDCwaa	Considering people are STILL scalping the standard Wii Sports package for $300 and Wii Fit for $120 on Craigslist, that's actually a pretty good deal. Many people are still buying the Wii Sports package for retail price, $250 from Craigslist, new or used. Ask about how old the Wii is, and how much it's been played.|`|AA11045021	Well, I say buy it if you think it's legit and every thing's in working order. I wouldn't be too sure though if there aren't any warranties. It's always better to have those. $320's a good price for all that though.|`|buUTakKAaa	i think it's a good deal.   don't ask to lower the price, you will just sound cheap     how cheaper can it get than 320?   maybe ask for 319.99|`|rVPrhd26aa	don't buy it like that.  electronics like this are prone to failure and such of that like... I'm not saying the Wii's break often but mine has and it was no big deal becouse I had the receipt for the store I bought it at.   Be smart and buy it in a real store so all warranties are legit.|`|sOJRn24paa	That sounds good.
dFTr5IPwaa	i assume you're talking about there being music on your windows media player, but none on itunes?    you have to find the files. they will probably be in 'my music' (if you're using windows). Look for the files in there. when you've found the right one, right click and select 'open with...' and select itunes.|`|HyrRPQySaa	If you have a music folder on your computer you can store your songs on there and put them on itunes when you need them        If you are trying to put music on your mp3 you can sync your music from the media player that's how I do it|`|t4irULbjaa	you have to copy the songs on there
bribxhsdaa	I'm sure they are the same serial number..Unless one is different. In which case, You'll have to try both. (or whoever you speak to from MS will ask you for one and tell you which it is)    Just to be sure use the one on the back...If you call them, You'll get your answer a lot quicker than by E-Mail.    There are 1000's of people at a time that are pissed off with MS.|`|4BeSKxdIaa	It should be the one on the sticker behind the xbox. That's the one I always give them but just call them and make 100% sure.|`|6uWTPQY9aa	FIRST of all serial numbers r both  the same   call microsoft and don't send it to them via mail because the have to give you a reference number and when you send it to them don't send the xbox with the original box if you do that they are going to think that the xbox belong to them and you are not going to get it back ant that means trouble   and take out the face plate of your xbox  I hope this helps you and good luck     I like to played hole 3 it rocks   id gtibadazz
STUsNoNTaa	You could have a big problem as they only loan you the equipment not like sky when you own the equipment after a year they could hit you with a big charge as you never own the equipment you should not have disposed of the box If you know the person you gave it to or sold it to you need to get it back from them or you will have to pay virgin anything they ask as its in the contract always read the small print when taking out any contract however long- winded|`|VjfJpeRjaa	Depends what kind of box you have, HD,DVR or regular cable box. When I switched from Time-Warner they wanted like $600 for an HD DVR box and 3 reg boxes. I would call to find out.
TUkDOIR0aa	My Blackberry Pearl is small and I got a fantastic deal when I purchased it.               There is a good review about the Blackberry Pearl over at this page.      http://www.mobile.123thebest.info/blackb... I would check it out.
RDLRbes8aa	that's why i use pay phones some times when i call them! lol|`|dK2Zv21Daa	Yeah ,, but  you can still use distinct ring to Id your callers, don't forget  *67 only let's you  block your number , there's nothing  I know of  that can get around this.
5xS7sQOgaa	Well PJ64 was discontinued, and the only way it was considered feasible to use the microphone was the adaptoid with an N64 controller and the actual microphone from the game. And I don't think anyone's made a third party plugin to use the windows sound system.
PYiQGwsAaa	You need a BT line to use Sky broadband, and the problem is as she left BT of her own accord they charge approx 130 to reconnect your line up again at the junction box in your street and at the local BT exchange.    So the only choices are to pay BT or the cable provider (Virgin i guess) to dig up the front garden to fix the cabling problem|`|evhwdzG3aa	your cousin needs a bt or bt compatible line. i sell sky talk and broadband and what i can say is that sky will be offering customers a new phone line if they need one the only thing we dont know is when exactly this will happen
