Then spread it on the bottom of a 9X13" pan. Pat it in a bit.    Melt the chocolate chips in a separate bowl. (I put them in a glass measuring cup and microwave til melted. Be careful because the chips melt fairly quickly and you dont want to burn the chocolate. The chips are often melted in the center but still look firm on the outside until you touch them to stir)     Frost the mixture in the 9x13 with the chocolate.

Seriously I'd just take whatever mashed potato recipe you like, spread it in a a casserole dish and maybe put some butter on top for browning, then bake it.  If it's a good tasting batch of mashed potatoes it's not like anything is going to go wrong.

Place eggs in a saucepan with enough COLD tap water to cover completely by 1 inch. Bring to a ROLLING boil over HIGH heat. Once the water is brought to a rolling boil, PROMPTLY reduce heat to a lower medium boil and cook an additional 10 minutes for a “hard boiled” egg. For a “soft boiled” egg reduce the time by a few minutes.<br>  <br>  2. Remove from heat and IMMEDIATELY place eggs under ice cold water or in a bowl of ICED water to chill promptly to help yolks stay bright yellow. Chill for a few minutes in the cold water until the egg is completely cooled. This is an extremely important step which prevents the greenish “ring” from forming on the surface of the yolk over time. If the egg is not chilled immediately after cooking an unsightly dark greenish ring will eventually appear on the outside of the yolk. <br>  <br>  3. To peel...crack on all sides, roll egg between hands to loosen shell,and remove shell|`|MDWaPmXsaa	This works for me:  immediately after pouring out the boiling water, I fill the pot up with cold water and a few cups of ice cubes.   I let that sit for about 20 minutes or so, then peel.|`|wLgGD63raa	After you boil the eggs if you run them under cold water it will release the shell from the white, making it easier to peel without loosing half of the egg.|`|AA10928232	don't use freshly-laid eggs.

I watched Julia Child peel them nicely under cold running water.  I have heard so many things over the years like putting something in the water  or one tip was to crack a circle around the middle and twist.

I do this all of the time and never have trouble with my eggs.|`|Jq2K3N1Zaa	I peel them while running cool water over them.

And all the water you are drinking could have caused you to wash essential minerals out of your body. Your brain may be telling your body that it needs these minerals replaced causing you to feel dehydrated.    I am no doctor but drinking too much water can result in the loss of electrolytes.     And I noticed an answerer saying to drink tap water!    WHAT!  65% of the us water supply is fluoridated. Fluoride is basically left over junk from making aluminum, that has no medical benefits what so ever, and it's dumped into the water supply. No one should ingest this stuff.

cTuaFrYiaa	Bar/club patrons often buy the bartender a drink so this is were it starts. Bartenders work for tips and don't want to offend a customer for fear of loosing a tip are even having the customer go to another bartender are even leave the bar/club. The larger the crowd the more he/she may end up drinking. So yes this can lead to addiction if not dealt with. I suggest this person seek employment at a bar/club that doesn't allow their employees to drink on the job. They are out there and more are instating this policy.|`|RuQ1MOsQaa	You gotta love what you do. For instance, if you love beef go work with beef and you'll get addicted to beef.|`|nPfdmZR8aa	Actually if it's a good bar or club then the employer usually states that you should not be a heavy drinker or not drink on the job so it shouldn't be happening beforehand! I think it mostly comes from customers who are generous and tell you to have one for yourself, you also have the alcohol on hand so it's so tempting to just down a shot real quick! But generally this should be able to be controlled as you can monitor your alcohol quite easily, from a 750ml bottle of hard liquor you get 25 single shots and the rest such as beers and ciders is per unit! I hope this helps...|`|Dhgjk3aiaa	Maybe cause there around it all the time.

ZsKyITgYaa	Try the "fake" soy meats.  It might take a while and you'll have to try different types, brands, and way of cooking them but i'm sure you'll find ones that you like.  I thought I'd have a similar issue with my meat eating boyfriend and he started eating the fake meats and eats them allll the time now!  You can make so many of the same meals you would of and just replace the meat with the soy version.  Also, use the opportunity to try out new foods.  Stuff you might not of thought of before because you were used to your typical steak, potatos, veg meal or chicken or whatever... I've found lots of new meals I wouldn't of even thought to try before!  good luck!|`|rrWhhiMEaa	If you are really determined, you can do it. You have to make the decision and have self control. However, it sounds like maybe you are not "ready" yet.<br>  Take it one step at a time. When your husband makes chicken, tell yourself you wont eat it this time. Don't focus on the long term. Maybe gradually cutting back will be better for you. So, cut it to once in two weeks, then once a month. Maybe looking forward to that 1 time a month will keep you from eating it at the other times. I think cutting down consumption is better than nothing, so don't get discouraged.<br>  <br>  Bottom line is there are only two choices: indulge your craving or hold yourself back. Nobody can help you with that.|`|lHlFxeaCaa	Like every other addiction, you stop cold turkey. It's the best most effective way. I became Vegan, not Vegetarian, instantly. Lucky for me I never liked the taste of meat all that much, and I had stopped drinking milk completely years ago after discovering that it was full of cow puss. <br>  <br>  But as some other people stated, eating fake meats can help you tame your lust for meat...though this is my question. Why do people like meat all that much? It's tasteless, chewy, and taste completely like rubber sprinkled with salt on it. Eck!!<br>  <br>  Habits typically take 3 weeks to 3 months to erode. I have a feeling that after 3 weeks of not eating meat, and if you didn't eat fake meats you wouldn't crave chicken anymore.|`|fc5c0507db7f5b77389a61a92ae3cf1faa	I never really liked meat that much anyway, so for me it was easy to become a vegetarian. If you're having difficulties, try just cutting down like you said you're doing, stick with that for a while, then go down even more to, say twice a month. If you really feel like meat, there's the "fake" meat made out of soy or other vegetarian protein, it l?okes a bit like meat and tastes similar. Good luck!|`|uXbl1Zbhaa	As a result of my daughter being a vegetarian for several years it eventually rubbed off on me, even though I never planned on that happening.  I've been that way for about 2 years now.  I rarely ever eat meat anymore.  And when I do I have to psyche myself up and convince myself not to gag afterwards.  I know it's mind over matter but I almost gag seeing meat commercials on TV, in restaurants, etc.|`|a5b833f1cecfc7eab7869f5ea4fe43f1aa	The first six months are the hardest. Tell yourself you won't eat meat for only six months. During that time, fake meats like Tofurky or Boca Burgers will help you with your meat cravings. At the end of the six months, you may not even want to eat meat again. <br>  <br>  If six months is too long, start with two weeks. Think short-term goals, then keep extending them. That way it won't feel so absolute and overwhelming.|`|MyteFyXXaa	I had your same problem until a week ago and I have been meat free for 5 days.

Just cut back on your meat intake and slowly you can ween it out of your diet. BTW many people stop eating meats except for fish and other seafood. There is nothing wrong with a little meat hear and there. My biggest stumbling block is bacon... I have come to terms with the fact that life would really suck without it. That doesn't make me less aware of consumption or anything else. But I am a conscience consumer and seek a balanced diet. Life is not meant to deprive yourself of things, but to enjoy a good balance of all things.|`|M5HyStReaa	I can't help as I am a natural vegan as dairy, eggs and meat are either repulsive or just bleurgh to me.<br>  <br>  I really admire anyone who is giving up things they like|`|ZYwTrAp8aa	same way you stop doing anything.

nxeQFPEfaa	Vodka. <br>  Hands down.<br>  I love it with hawaiian punch and a splash of pineapple juice. <br>  I started drinking that when I was about 19 and I am now 25 and I still drink it.<br>  If you can afford it, get grey goose. If money is tight get Svedka. It is really smooth for about 1/2 the price. And the cool thing about this mixture is I just buy the big jug of hawaiian punch a a small can of pineapple juice, I pour out about 5 cups of the punch and add the small  6 oz can of pineapple juice and then fill the rest with the vodka, put the cap on it and put it in the fridge. You don't have to "mix" you a drink everytime, you just pour it and start sippin'.<br>  <br>   Smirnoff also makes a flavored vodka called black cherry that is really good with Sprite or Coke. Tastes like a cherry coke or cherry sprite. <br>  <br>  Don't even worry about ppl givin u a hard time b/c u are a minor. <br>  EVERYONE has done "something" of that nature. NOBODY is perfect.<br>  Just be safe <3|`|VeYbalAjaa	Captain Morgan's Parrot Bay is pretty tasty. Try the Coconut Flavor mixed with actual Pineapple juice. It's great.

rmPO1inpaa	Hi =] On a program in Britain called Braniac: Science Abuse, they had a test model eat everything chocolately for 2 weeks straight eg. Coco Pops for breakfats, chocolate for lunch and dinner etc. And in the 2 weeks that the test model ate chocolate, no difference in her skin was found. Another myth smashed =]|`|wlXKpbQbaa	No, it's actually been proven. Then again. It dosen't mean that as soon as you eat chocolate you're going to get huge spots over your face. It's if you eat too much. The fats in the chocolate react with your body and depending on how higher of lower intake of fat you have can show how your body reacts to it. If you put on weight then it slowly becomes more difficult to do things. That makes you sweat and sweat blocks up all of the tiny pores on our bodies and faces, (pores, incase you don't know, are like tiny holes in your face that allow your skin to breathe. If your skin can't breathe then it gets blocked up and causes the pores on the skin to come out in spots. <br>  <br>  Hope that I've been some help!!!|`|TrrVqO0haa	if u have like 500-1000 grams of chocolate than u can get spots but even then it may not happen|`|54f6648cc51907396315ece741841c0caa	daf|`|SJLgRqgSaa	no sugar does, eating unhealhy foods messes your skin up! xx|`|LS2mF8u3aa	Yes.<br>  <br>  Case and point.

The extremely low temperature of the ice cream prevents it from melting while being fried. It may be sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar and a touch of peppermint, though whipped cream or honey may be used as well.<br>  <br>  <<<br>  It's realy gourmet cooking, and usually expensive to order.<br>  <br>  But, because the egg is not fully cooked due to cold of the ice cream it may cause Salmonella poisoning.<br>  Personally, I'd not buy or eat it!<br>  Read more about it at source below:

If you are lucky you can work for someone who might take you under their wing and teach you the ropes.   Some of the stress can come from being busy and not being used to a fast pace. Some people are not cut out for this kind of situation and will never get used to it.  Dishwashing can get your foot in the door. Many famous chefs started out as dishwashers.|`|0maJCeLCaa	find a caf off the beaten track (in a side street) .. that won't be too busy, and you can find your footing before getting into a busy place ..

R2epUOTMaa	Native to lowland, tropical South America, cacao has been cultivated for at least three millennia in Central America and Mexico, with its earliest documented use around 1100 BC. The majority of the Mesoamerican peoples made chocolate beverages, including the Maya and Aztecs.  The chocolate residue found in an early ancient Maya pot in Ro Azul, Guatemala, suggests that Maya were drinking chocolate around 400 AD.  In the 1700s, mechanical mills were created that squeezed out cocoa butter, which in turn helped to create hard, durable chocolate like what we most commonly eat today before that chocolate was mainly a drink.|`|ubukt8WWaa	Central America and Mexico.

mNjjSPdVaa	1  Season the steaks with the seasonings of your choice, or use your favorite marinade recipe. Prepare the broiler pan by spraying it with a non-stick spray, or covering the top of the pan with tin foil. If using tin foil, cut slots into the foil so the fat from the steaks will drip to the bottom pan.  Step  2  Adjust the top oven rack to the top position in your oven. Lay the steaks out in a single layer on the broiler pan.  Step  3  Turn the oven dial to the broil position. There is no need to preheat the broiler. Slide the pan of steaks under the broiler element on the top rack in the oven.  Step  4  Allow the steaks to cook for 3 to 4 minutes on each side, if you want the steaks to be rare to medium rare. Add 2 to 3 minutes per side for more well-done meat.  Step  5  Remove the steaks from the oven. Tent the pan with tin foil and let the meat rest for at least five minutes before serving.|`|Cm7MQrhiaa	first you put the steak in a baking pan, then ou season them with your favorites, then lightly add water on top of them to cover, you then cover them with aluminum foil and lastly bake on 200 degrees for about 6 hours for more tenderness (for quicker cooking raise the temp of the oven and lowerthe amount of time spent in the oven)    hope I helped|`|XqqLlBe4aa	broil on high|`|KaG907YYaa	I LOVE STEAK!|`|zXavPbXfaa	Someone else just asked a similar question....

There is the salt, pepper option or ifSeasoning you feel a little more adventurous, you can create your own rub of dry ingredients and rub it into the steak.    To create a rub, get a zip lock baggie and add salt, pepper, onion powder, garlic powder, cayenne pepper (if you like a spice), a little brown sugar and some paprika. The amount of each ingredient will vary in accordance to your preference. Add, delete or modify ingredients as you see fit. Close the baggie, shake to mix the ingredients, then rub it on both sides of your steak.    Once you've rubbed your mixture on your steak, let it sit for a while. I generally wait a couple of hours after seasoning to cook the steak (as much as 24 hours). If you have a vacuum sealer, even better. Vacuum seal the steak and let it sit for about an hour or two prior to cooking. This helps to absorb the flavor.|`|IE9NfLGoaa	Throw Em In And Turn On The Oven|`|xPeIvywdaa	sear it first mate, so the juices wont escape, then just pop em in|`|pLnCUaF1aa	just put them on a tinfoil-like tray and use a meat thermometer to see when there done.  my mom cooks steak in the oven..|`|UX3xjsFlaa	You should grill them on the stove in a pan not put them in the oven- just cook them til they look good- brown on both sides- whatever color you like in the middle!

AA12336927	I don't see why not,  my dog won't touch fish. She turns her nose up at food with salmon. Maybe try some cooked chicken too    edit hey lucky, poach your chicken or turkey  2 Cup(s) Chicken broth 1 lb Chicken breasts; boneless, skinned   In a deep skillet or large pot, bring to a bowl. Add seasoning and reduce heat to a simmer. Cook 5 minutes, add chicken or turkey breast and cook 10 to 15 minutes or until tender and no longer pink in the center. Remove from broth and refrigerate if prepared ahead. Chicken or turkey breasts can be cut into chunks, sliced thin on diagonal or shredded and used in salads or other dishes where precooking is required    this is good and low fat for people to, just add a bit of salt and a bay leaf to the water      edit: I think my dog would also prefer cottage cheese to the tartness of yogurt
FxWppY7Baa	There is a growing body of peer reviewed evidence that says a definate yes. Unfortunately I do not know of a website that has all this research in one place. But I know some papers appear at  http://www.organicconsumers.org  http://www.rodaleinstitue.org  http://www.acresusa.com  http://www.soilassociation.org  http://www.ofrf.org      The Soil Association is probably your best bet as they are doing a huge research project on just this subject and over the next 7 to 10 years papers will be published. the problem is each food needs to be tested and testing is expensive and takes time to do (at least 5 years to do the science, write the papers, have the papers reviewed and than either rejected or published in a peer reviewed journal such as the Journal nature) Since serious research into certified organic food has been going on for less than 10 years we are just now seeing the very first research papers published. in the next decade we will know a lot more and at present all signs are pointing to organic being a lot more nutritious across the board.|`|LTspANO6aa	As a group, no.    There is variation of nutrition within either organic or nonorganic.  If I wanted to show either being superior, it's actually a pretty simple thing to select a sample to show that.    It depends on the nutrition of the plant, on the variety and also on things like the maturity when picked and such.    Some people say organic is so much more flavorful and such.  Well if you want to compare a locally grown, picked when mature fruit or vegetable to one shipped halfway around the world as the nonorganic, I guess they are.  But if you want to compare a locally grown, picked when mature nonorganic to a certified organic shipped from the other side of the world, well, guess what, the nonorganic is going to taste better.    We can also find, in both organic and nonorganic cases where plants are grown nutritionally deficient.  Say for instance the crop is short on nitrogen, this lowers the amount of protein in the food since nitrogen is necessary to make protein.  I can find you lower than normal protein food in organic and for that matter nonorganic.    There is also the New Age religious belief that organic nourishes your life force in a way nonorganic does not.  Many who assume that organic is better are actually promoting religion and not anything to do with nutrition.  If they talk about energy and such, that's religion.  No one has actually been able to demonstrate any difference there either, but that doesn't stop people from believing.    So the fundamental answer is no, no basic difference.  Both categories have a lot more variation within them than any sort of variation between them.    Marv|`|BXLCiCUlaa	I think so. Organic foods like fruit and veggies tend to be smaller in size. Giant oranges that are genetically modified have more water in them and have less vitamins and nutrients per pound than non-GM fruit.   If you simply mean chemically treated food, i wouldnt say the nutritional value is affected at all, because the plants were simply sprayed with chemicals and whatever else.  So, foods that are genetically modified are the only ones that have less nutrients per pound.  Organics are healthier because theres no chemicals added or residues you have to worry about, or hormones (like in milk).

rsTB7D1zaa	I live in MA, and some Wal-Marts do sell alcohol -- beer and wine only.      The reason they can do this is that these locations are Super Wal-Marts so the town classifies them as grocery stores, which can sell beer & wine in MA.  But only 3 locations from the same company can hold a liquor license in MA for grocery stores, so there should only be 3 super walmarts in MA with beer and wine.  Mine happens to be one, go figure.    For liquor, some of the discount club stores sell liquor... BJ's, Costco.  There is actually a quirky law in MA that you can buy alcohol from these club stores without a membership, and they cannot refuse that sale.  After prohibition we were apparently bitter about alcohol, so we declared that nobody shall restrict the sale of alcohol except on the basis of age.|`|rDsKB0uXaa	Wal-Mart sells alcohol ?|`|ubukt8WWaa	They do everywhere local law allows it.

The only real difference is that wines and cheeses have interesting flavors you can try. Otherwise it's no different than any other event. Go when you can, leave when you like. I have found these things to be very fun because I like to explore food. And if you can't think of anythng else to talk about, you can always ask the other guests what their favorites are.|`|RQh3SG2Oaa	Your host or hostess will have a variety of wines, usually ones that they enjoy, ranging from lighter tastes to stronger wines.  Starting with the milder tastes you just have a sip of wine and a nibble of a complimenting cheese.  It sounds boring but you really can have alot of fun if you have a good group.  Also, if your driving its perfectly acceptable to taste and spit into another cup, sounds gross but wine has a high alcohol content and you can get a buzz pretty quick if you have a sip of this and a sip of that.

But if you can't go more than, say, 3 days without it then I'd think you do have a problem.    What I do know is that 4 cans of lager every night is too much.  You may not be physically or mentally addicted to alcohol, but you are causing health problems that you don't need.  A healthier amount to drink would be 2 cans of lager, 5 nights a week.  That would be much better, in fact, slightly better for you than not drinking alcohol at all. What you are doing is clearly more harmful.  It may not harm you now, or even in the next 10 years, but later you will run into problems and you should have a shortened life span if you keep drinking like this for an extended period of time.|`|yrhpnOUPaa	NO ... not at all.

cfdc405defe60d37e2129e3f90174096aa	I am a former chef and trained with many European cuisines, and there is a big difference, sprats are a type of North Atlantic herring and like Pilchards in the UK are either tinned with oil, smoked or in a avriety of sauces, anchovies are a smaller fish, and come salted, whole and fresh, there is a variety known as white anchovies, the tinned ones are salted, filleted and packed in oil to preserve them.    While I like the tinned one, here in Toronto Canada I get the white Spanish ones for tapas and appetizers, and use the tinned ones for pastas and salad dressing, even Thai fish sauce is an anchovy base.

For those who are not faint of heart - you can add additional 'hot' elements to make them what I call: "500 Degree" wings.|`|y1lr564raa	in the microwave oven|`|A7qJW9e8aa	Cut the wings into separate pieces.  Put them on a shallow cookie sheet, one with a 1 inch rim.  Set the oven to 400 to 425 and cook for about 20 minutes.  Turn the wings and cook till nice and brown.  Use tongs    While they are cooking:  Take 1/4 cup of butter or we use smart balance.  1 cup of franks hot sauce  1/2 teaspoon salt  1/4 teaspoon pepper  1/2 teaspoon garlic powder  1/4 teaspoon celery seed.  1 teaspoon apple cider vinegar   bring to a simmer.  Transfer the wings to a bowl.  Pour hot sauce over wings.  Serve with celery and carrot sticks and bleu cheese dressing.  Root beer

DfK4JSytaa	If you would turn the oven down to 325 after you put them in, figure 20 minutes per pound plus another 15 minutes.     If you don't have a meat thermometer, then tip the chicken so that the juices run out of the cavity. If the juices are clear, the chicken is done. You can also try twisting the leg. If it twists easily, the chicken is done.    Baste the chicken every 20 minutes and cover it loosely with aluminum foil if it start to brown too quickly.

zawmsUO1aa	Don't believe everything you see on YouTube.    Trichinosis infection was once very common, but is now rare in the developed world. From 1997 to 2001, an annual average of 12 cases per year were reported in the United States. The few cases in the United States are mostly the result of eating undercooked game, bear meat, or home reared pigs. It is most common in the developing world and where pigs are commonly fed raw garbage.    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trichinosis|`|aBpEPOCdaa	I heard of this but never seen it.  I think the pork is supposed to be raw to  get the visual you are referring to.    I have no idea....and I have suddenly lost my appetite.|`|829070aea711a47d99d908ff132df3bbaa	I heard it, I don't believe it.  Where did you see this?    That vid is a phoney.  I'm in the meat business and that's total b/s.  Anyway, what is true is that we consume on average  2 pounds of insects, insect parts, rodent hair. and rodent excrement per person per year.  So even if this were true( which it isn't), it would make little difference.  If we didn't eat bugs( which are in everything) we would die.    http://www.sixwise.com/newsletters/05/06...|`|tu3Rn6BMaa	Major is right.  almost any pork that you buy in the store was frozen at some point (which would kill trichonosis).  you just don't get it from pork any more.

Good luck with your diet!
UKFL4wNVaa	Try changing to a different type of rice, jasmine rice is good.     Also you could try making fried rice, which is cooked twice.     Because you take it out of the pot and then recook it in the frying pan a lot of gumminess and moisture will be removed.     I have included three pages with recipes for fried rice which you can look at.     If none of this works try asking your mother in law to teach you how to cook, she will be flattered and probably love this. It may bring you closer together. When in doubt, ask the question.    Hope this helps :)|`|CEAJBk73aa	Ask your mother in Law how she makes it so nice FIRM--UN-GUMMY|`|tu3Rn6BMaa	Buy long grain rice.  Measure carefully, 1 part rice to 2 parts water. Add salt.  Bring to a boil.  As soon as it has boiled for a minute or so, move the rice to the Slowest (or smallest ) burner on your stove.  Cook it on the lowest possible setting.  Cook until almost all of the water is out (don't peek in there too much).  Turn off the pot and let it sit for another 15 minutes or so. (I usually cook rice about an hour before I need it.)  It also helps, when you turn the pot off, put a folded paper towel just inside the pot on top of the rice to absorb any extra moisture.  Fluff with a fork when ready to serve.|`|Nn9t3DyYaa	try using boil- in- bag rice it turns out perfect and its not mushy at all sucess is the best brand it takes about 5 mins put in a pot add the bag and let it boil pour the water out cut open the bag and bam you have perfect rice|`|MIlpLLZcaa	If you are using a white rice it will tend to do that you could try a brown rice, basmatti or even wild rice, but if you really want white try uncle Ben's instant, with a bit of butter it will turn out not gummy at all.  Good Luck|`|w0ZqjJBtaa	First tip; NEVER use a spoon to stir rice while it is cooking. This can affect the outcome. Have you tried cooking your plain rice in the microwave.? On avarage 13 min on a 800-1000 watt. Use the same amount of water you would normally. Works everytime for me.|`|MbGZ7Jaxaa	Do you use a rice cooker? If so, maybe your cooker is broken?

DHF0PWPqaa	Cereal first then milk. Pour the milk until the cereal floats a tiny bit.  That's perfect so there's not extra milk leftover, the cereal get's wet but not soggy and so the milk doesn't gather all the sugar.|`|AA11402528	for me, about 1/2 cup of milk to every 1 cup of cereal|`|ILpp3ncYaa	1/2 c. milk for ever 1 and 1/2 c. cereal.|`|44f971d7ae1936193e159c0b3819760baa	It's a matter of personal taste, nothing mathematical about that.

hvjWpq2naa	The Filet :)  it comes from the tenderloin  granted, its not the most flavorful but the most "tender" (Not softest)   the ribeye and porterhouse are also nearly as tender. (both part of the same piece of meat on the cow)     what ever you order I suspect you need to do rare if you dont mind the blood. if you do, then medium rare. anything beyond that is going to be chewy.      edit:   this is a response to AL  they dont have Kobe Beef at Ruth Chris.   beside that, I dont see any reason to pay 160 a plate for that.|`|cwrQYmdPaa	I prefer new York strip, but the others are all good! :) Hope this helps.|`|zzO6Qalsaa	I like rib eye,t-bone, porterhouse they are all good. A helpful hint  perhaps, don't  get your steak cooked well done at ANY restaurant. They tend to overcook them and they seem tough . Ask for medium well-done. I usually do this and they seem to melt in my mouth ever time. Enjoy your meal!|`|fFqzD3aMaa	Kobe and filet mignon are very tender. Tenderness comes from the fat dispersion, or marbling, of the beef. If you look at the raw meat you will see a bunch of small white slivers throughout the beef, the better the beef, the smaller and more numerous the little slivers.
56bNLJykaa	Do not mix strawberries bananas and milk with alcohol that will probably make you throw up.     I'd stick to normal vodka drinks- my favorite vodka is stoli, so i will just stick to that while using all of my examples:     simple vanilla stoli/coke or stoli splash of club is good- vodka redbull (if u do that i actually prefer with goose but once again, any vodka will work)    the drink that was recommended above^, ruby relaxer sounds delicious. i've never had but i have had peach- and better yet apple schnapps shots and they are both mouth watering. the problem is, you probably dont have a lot of the proper stuff to mix with unless you are at a bar. if you are, you can also try a stoli b&b- stoli blakberi on the rock sparkling lemonade, basil garnish    mainly with drinks the juice you use is cranberry, lime, pineapple, etc. something along those lines.. as far as soda, coke works with a lot- vodka, whiskey, rum, even tequila (if you get cuervo black which was specifically made for mixing with coke and drinking on the rocks- but that is just disgusting and a bad idea)|`|hSQ0nC7haa	Beer or tequila ok|`|UaFqS9y5aa	cranberry and a splash of lemonade,but use a good vodka it will taste a lot smother|`|SA1gfcFlaa	I'm a bartender at a restaurant.    and the best juice to blend with vodka is pineapple. it counters the taste of vodka.    my favorite drink we make is a ruby relaxer.     it has 1oz peach schnapps, 1oz vodka, 1oz rum (malibu preferably)    and pineapple and cranberry.    its a favorite everytime, and its a good drink. You forget you're drinking 3ozs of liquor. :)|`|gjvsPaA8aa	Cranberry in Vodka works very well.|`|5YTkGB5yaa	V8 Splash drinks mix well with it|`|6c7e9e289fd5db36cd934c29dca6003eaa	I had coke and vodka without even realizing it and it tasted really good.

s65op1hGaa	It affect everyone in different ways and in different amounts.  But considering she hasn't had much before take it slow as it probably won't take much, have some weak alcopops or something to start off, or whatever you american girls drink!  I wouldn't take too many shots at first, she might over do it without realising, you don't want to ruin the night.  I'd guess at 4 pints of 4.5% beer she will be pretty drunk.  Remember to eat before you drink :]  Have a good time!|`|wV9nMhqAaa	Empty stomach...5-9 shots...or 3 or 4 beers|`|v8k5heIwaa	A shot or two of tequila will definitely do it.
s65op1hGaa	You should always eat before drinking and something after if you can.  I don't know what a 'screwdriver' is, i'm assuming it's a cocktail or something? But you probably had an empty stomach and you drank too fast.   If you took any medication that may have contributed to this.  Your tiredness may have just been because you were already tired and alcohol would increase that feeling. (Generally alcohol just enhances the mood you are in before you start drinking.)|`|gspTDufpaa	Always eat a meal before drinking.|`|SiFoEA8jaa	I'd say it's because you didn't eat all day. It's surprising how hard alcohol hits you on an empty stomach. Solution: make sure you eat before you drink, but make sure it's nothing too nauseating because you don't want to puke it up when you're drunk.|`|wV9nMhqAaa	If you didn't feel good why did you drive...seriously...your going to kill somebody...    It's probably because you were on an empty stomach..I've had that happen|`|bf57e86d6303fb624ea8bfd693de2a11aa	The effect you felt was most likely a combination of your limited food intake and the CHEAP vodka they use when you go out to a bar. I mean really, next time specify a particular brand to ensure that they do not pour the $4 a bottle stuff in your drink.    You could have also got some really old orange juice too, but that's unlikely.

rsTB7D1zaa	You can't go sober drunk sober in 3 hours.  It takes much more time and dedication than that.    You need, at a minimum, 6-8 hours to do what you want.      As a very rough rule, take 1 shot for every hour you have until you want to be sober again.  For your weight, you'll probably need less; that is, following this rule will likely leave you buzzed or tipsy when you wanted to be sober... maybe 1 less shot than the 'general rule' for you?  The last couple hours you won't be drunk anymore, you'll go back down from drunk to tipsy then buzzed.  And the first few hours you won't be drunk, either... you have to wait for your body to absorb the alcohol.  You can speed this up by not eating beforehand.  Even on an empty stomach, it takes 1 hour for alcohol to absorbed, so please do not take more shots because you aren't drunk yet... you need to give it time.  They'll all hit you at once, its a very unique feeling when that happens, and its not particularly fun.|`|d55f9fa303ffed7693f24381e6799502aa	please don't ask me this question, when I've drank 2 bottles of 12% wine.!|`|wV9nMhqAaa	Thats only enough time to get tipsy, then be perfectly normal...you could get drunk and not be completely normal in that time with 5 or 6 shots? maybe give or take|`|SiFoEA8jaa	Here's how it works:    12 oz beer takes 1 hour to get out of your system.  1 oz of 80 proof liquor takes 1 hour to get out of your system.    unfortuately, you can't be drunk for the full 3 hours and magically be 100% sober at 12, since to get drunk you'd need a few shots. The best bet would be taking 3 shots at 9 (one right after the other) and you should be pretty sober by 12. I wouldn't count on passing a breathelyzer, though.|`|Tm8smCiZaa	shots of cognac and be sure to dance and move about DO NOT drink water its a chaser you'll feel sober then it comes back in waves. also try the pills chaser they OTC

rsTB7D1zaa	You can only get drunk on alcohol.    Soda and energy drinks will give you a kick, but its all caffeine and sugar.  Coffee will do the same thing if you drink a lot of it.  People usually say that they're "wired" when they have had too much caffeine.  Though tea does have caffeine, you would need to drink about 3x more tea than soda to get the same effect, so this isn't a particularly easy way to do that.    Juice is good for you, even in large quantities there isn't anything that will change you.    Water is sort of like juice, except its easier to drink a lot of water.  You can get water poisoning, as crazy as it sounds.  This can be lethal, but you do need to drink a *lot* of water, usually over 2 gallons but that's by no means a minimum.|`|ox7mJ2Psaa	no but you can end up dead by drinking too much of anything even water as noted in the news after new college pledges where forced or required to drink more than a gallon of water.

m1cEbzBcaa	not sure what you are asking but thermometers are thermometers, which means they measure the temperature of a substance, gas or surface.    there is no difference in measuring the temperature of alcohol to measuring the temperature of water, air, etc.  if you can stick the thermomemter into the alcohol, it should read the temp.
g4APbW4Naa	Calories are NOT a unit of weight.  You cannot add calories together to make a pound.  Calories are units of heat/energy, not weight.    The food calorie is the amount of energy required to raise the temperature of one kilogram of water by one degree Celsius.    Only carbohydrates (including fiber), fats, proteins, organic acids, polyols, and ethanol contain food energy. All foods are made up of a combination of these five nutrients. Everything else in food is non-caloric.    The "calorie" has become a common household term because dietitians recommend in cases of obesity to reduce body weight by increasing exercise (energy expenditure) and reducing energy (food) intake.    But how many calories ingested will translate into one pound of your body weight depends on your individual metabolism, and how much you exercise.    Generally, if you burn 3,500 kcal more than you eat, you lose about 1 pound (0.45 kg) of fat, however, if you eat 3,500 kcal more than your body needs, you will put on 0.3 pounds (0.14 kg) of fat.    So to gain 20 pounds, you would need to consume (over time) 233,333.33 calories more than you burn, by my calcuations.|`|axxQzOCHaa	Different things have different numbers of calories. Try the health section for more help with this.|`|AA10625089	3,500|`|N9dqywJbaa	3500|`|K6JSNQJQaa	3500 calories adds up to one pound

AA11125475	Take a friend so you have someone to talk to. People are willing to talk if they see a friendly face so wear your best smile.  I go into bars all by myself and have a great time.|`|axxQzOCHaa	As long as you're 21, don't worry about your lack of alcohol knowledge, there's usually foosball, pool and other activities to keep you company. If you don't have beer or liquor one can usually get soda pop. If it's an Irish pub they often have good food too.    If you decide to have alcohol, stick to one type. (Either all beer, or all hard liquor. But do NOT mix both over the course of the evening. That can cause hangovers and migranes, even to experienced drinkers like me!)|`|UA5L2SqXaa	Take all your ID's, some bar's have a policy of  ID-ing people even if their look over 21 just to be on the right side of the law.  Remember, you don't have to drink. Have a few soda's at the bar with food until you have the confidence to order beer.    If your not a drinker, take it easy. 2 bottles with some food will do it for now.   Know what you want before you step thru the door.  Maybe visit your neighborhood liquor store to get a few beers. Ask at the desk for 2 or 3 popular brands.   Go with someone older if you can, dad,uncle, someone from work, etc.    Just enjoy and don't over do! Can be hell if you do!!|`|wV9nMhqAaa	Go with friends|`|VOStCrLgaa	Take some friends, and find a bar with something you enjoy doing such as arcade games, pool, or pinball. And don't have too high of expectations, it really is overrated.|`|er2H1gQ1aa	Once you do it one time, your nervousness probably won't be an issue anymore.  There's no reason to be nervous if you're of legal age, they won't kick you out or anything.  If you're worried about looking like you have no clue what you're doing, don't be.  Every time I go to a different bar or restaurant it's a new experience.  Everyone serves different things.  Just walk up to the bar or a waitress and ask for suggestions.  You could also go out with a trusted, knowledgeable friend who can point you in the right direction.  Maybe you could also research different kinds of drinks to find out what you might like to order when you go out.  Or try making different things at home first if you're worried about not liking what you order.  Hope this all helps you out!|`|pxCUm6rJaa	Dude don't worry about humiliating yourself or anything. Half the people there will be drunk and wont even remember your face the next morning and the other half is working on getting drunk and wont remember your face the next morning. By the way since you never had any type of alcohol before  make sure you drink some before your first bar experience. Spend a saturday with some friends and get a few drinks 1. to see your tolerance (how quickly you get drunk) 2. To see the strongest liquor you can handle. This way when you order your first drink you'll know exactly what you can handle and how much you can drink of it.

7xc4U6hRaa	If you are looking for a recipe, this is a GREAT one - but it's just easier to buy !     2 (.25 ounce) envelopes active dry yeast   1/4 cup warm water (105 to 115 degrees)   1 1/2 cups lukewarm milk   1/2 cup white sugar   1 teaspoon salt   2 eggs   1/3 cup shortening   5 cups all-purpose flour   1 quart vegetable oil for frying       1/3 cup butter   2 cups confectioners' sugar   1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla   4 tablespoons hot water or as needed     Sprinkle the yeast over the warm water, and let stand for 5 minutes, or until foamy.   In a large bowl, mix together the yeast mixture, milk, sugar, salt, eggs, shortening, and 2 cups of the flour. Mix for a few minutes at low speed, or stirring with a wooden spoon. Beat in remaining flour 1/2 cup at a time, until the dough no longer sticks to the bowl. Knead for about 5 minutes, or until smooth and elastic. Place the dough into a greased bowl, and cover. Set in a warm place to rise until double. Dough is ready if you touch it, and the indention remains.   Turn the dough out onto a floured surface, and gently roll out to 1/2 inch thickness. Cut with a floured doughnut cutter. Let doughnuts sit out to rise again until double. Cover loosely with a cloth.   Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Stir in confectioners' sugar and vanilla until smooth. Remove from heat, and stir in hot water one tablespoon at a time until the icing is somewhat thin, but not watery. Set aside.   Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large heavy skillet to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Slide doughnuts into the hot oil using a wide spatula. Turn doughnuts over as they rise to the surface. Fry doughnuts on each side until golden brown. Remove from hot oil, to drain on a wire rack. Dip doughnuts into the glaze while still hot, and set onto wire racks to drain off excess. Keep a cookie sheet or tray under racks for easier clean up. Makes 18.  ===============|`|AA12031316	I think you mean FLOUR, and yes, its in doughnuts, along with yeast, sugar, egg, baking powder, baking soda, and sometimes vanilla extract or other ingredients.

There are two kinds of doughnuts: yeast and cake. For cake, you can take a pancake mix, mix it up but with only a splash of milk, then form it into rings, and deep-fat fry them.    Yeast: take a good sweet breadroll recipe, and just form it into donut rings. Let rise, and then fry in lots of oil.     This recipe looks great: http://www.tasteofhome.com/Recipes/Sweet...

bZe2bSMdaa	Not marinara! Bottled chili sauce! They are always a crowd favorite and it's an OLD Betty Crocker recipe! 10 oz grape jelly to 1 jar chili sauce, I use Heinz!    I'm sure if you "doctor" the marinara you may get a similar flavor, provided the marinara is not overly flavored with basil and oregano. It can't hurt to try. Make the sauce without adding the meatballs and if it doesn't work make a quick run to the store for the "right" ingredients.    This is the only thing in the world for which I'll use grape jelly!|`|gxl6oBpJaa	I've made that with grape jelly and chili sauce. Not marinara sauce. I bet it would be just as good though.

wX1xcnZOaa	Yep.  If they weren't coming over to my house, they would be having meat for dinner right? I go one better and serve them organic steak or pork. It's my way of compromising.|`|4zQEvzCsaa	Usually I'd ask if they want meat, but generally the guests respect my beliefs enough to allow me to prepare meat free dishes.|`|iXx9SWceaa	I personally wouldn't do that. I'd get some ranch dressing, broccoli, carrots, and some other veggies. And make a vegetarian lasagna.

I've never had any complaints.  All of my friends know that I'm a vegetarian, and they wouldn't expect me to cook meat for them.|`|FY5U6DkGaa	I would not do this.  People are usually vegetarians for two reasons:    1.) You don't like the idea of slaughtered animals.    2.) You don't like the idea of eating blood, muscles, etc.    I don't know anybody who is a true carnivore, who eats meat only, since you do need servings of other food groups.  Feed the other food groups to your guests instead. =)
khXGGBiTaa	Italian restaurants would be one of the worst places you could go to if you don't eat or can't eat dairy products. There are very few menu items which do not contain melted mozzarella or grated/shaved parmesan or other cheese (Italians are very big on cheeses) or butter or cream or milk. Bruschetta (mentioned above) is a possibility, but you'd starve to death on just that. You would have to give very specific and detailed instructions to the waiter to make sure that no dairy product gets into your meal.    Indian (also mentioned above) *can* be good, but it depends if they are using ghee (clarified butter) for frying, or putting yoghurt or paneer (a kind of firm cottage cheese, cut into cubes) into the dish. A lot of the desserts/sweets contain either fresh or powdered or condensed milk or even ghee.|`|3R2eHvpUaa	i find it hard to eat out too, but when i do the easiest things for me to eat is brescetta ( dont think its spelled correctly) if i go to italian or a garden salad with balsamic dressing, or if worst comes to worst i eat fries. i dont eat out by choice because its easier to make my own food but when i need to thats usually some of the things i eat. hope this helps a bit!|`|AA12031316	I can relate-in addition to not having commercial dairy, I am also allergic to wheat, soy, corn, tomato, eggs and some other things.  Really, all you can do is really research the topic, otherwise you will inadvertantly get dairy in some disguised form, such as cassien, whey protein, or some other ingredient that contains those things. Its important to do your homework on this one, since intolerance can lead to life threatening allergies very quickly, and from one exposure to the next.  Google it, research it at the library, and ask questions at restaurants, but keep in mind, they are often misinformed.  I simply cannot eat out any more, and eat only at home.  There is always an issue of cross contamination when eating out, as well as hidden ingredients.  Wish I could give you better advice, but thats the way it is.  For dairy, Chinese food is typically safer than most, since they are not big on dairy products, but there is still always the risk.|`|PxJXJKCpaa	My step daughter is deathly allergic to milk.  She can't eat Italian unless I make it myself. (I use tofu and soy milk).  You'll find eating out very difficult.    Go for breakfast places like Denny's and IHop or stay home and make your own food.  I've even had problems buying her cheeseless pizzas.    Is your diet a choice or demand from your body?  Hers, she will go into anaphalactic shock with her throat closing and tongue swelling.  It's pretty scary to watch, but she's been like that since birth.|`|84W8ff0paa	its actually unbelievably hard-even the veggies are cooked in butter at most places. You usually have to specifically request something and make sure they understand that you are lactose intolerant. I usually verify with the waiter/waitress that whatever i'm ordering is, in fact, vegan even if it *looks* vegan. Most of the time it isn't.    Oh, but if you live in a large metropolitan area you'll most certainly have better luck. I just live in the middle of nowhere Louisiana. But if you're unsure, Indian is generally vegan, and always have vegan-friendly options because there is very little in the way of dairy in their culture. Its always my fallback.

sP98NDi5aa	Well, in culinary school, we learned sanitation first, washing hands, keeping food either under 40 degrees F, or above 140 degrees F, that keeps food out of the temps where bacteria thrive. Next we learned cooking foods to proper temperature, Then it's just the basics: Boil, Steam, Broil, Bake, Roast, Saute, And Grill. Start out simple. Like you get to make the mashed potatoes. Then you get to move on to a salad, then onto the meat. <br>  I think you should be taught every night, Do something different. <br>  As for Homework/tests, I would definitely test, but not until you were comfortable doing some of the methods. <br>  After several months, I would give a somewhat final so to say. In culinary school we had what was called a "black box" and we had to make a 3 course meal from that. That would be my final.<br>  My biggest suggestion: If you can find a culinary school textbook, get it, and use that as a guide.|`|ozWi3TJlaa	I have my daughter (who is 15 today) in the kitchen with me at night when I'm cooking dinner and on weekends when I'm making big breakfasts.

Teach them how to use the oven/elements and show them how to safely prepare meat, vegetables and such. As their confidence grows with learning the basics you can move onto the more complicated. I would also have my teenager bake with me on the weekends. This is what my mother and I used to do and it really helped me with baking techniques and my confidence in baking/cooking. Try making muffins, simple cakes, pies, crumbles and such. If you don't understand something ask your mom to show you how.<br>  <br>  No, I don't think homework/tests are necessary, in fact they are a bit over the top.

Do you simply want to learn how to follow a recipe and cooking basics? If so I recommend the cookbook called New Cook Book by Better Homes and Gardens.  This has many awesome recipes that are not too hard to prepare.  <br>  <br>  I think the best time to learn is by fixing dinners and breakfasts as part of the regular mealtime.  I have an 11 year old who can make up a great meal, simply because he's been cooking with me since he was 5.  <br>  <br>  Homework and tests?  Nope, none.  Let your meals be the judge of how well you're doing!<br>  <br>  Once you get to learn the basics of cooking, by using a cookbook, you will amaze yourself.

Pick out about 3 recipes and buy only what you need and no more. Since you're moving out, I'm assuming you're living on your own...Or maybe even with another person. In this case, meals will definately go far! Make things like lasagna's and casseroles. Freeze what's left and you'll have plenty for leftovers! Also, plan your meals according to what's on sale in the flyers. Use coupons and brown bag your lunch. Don't eat out unless you absolutely have to or occasionally for a treat. The key is to be organized! I'm in your situation and it's working out great! Have fun! :)|`|vigFmfLmaa	To keep it healthy shop different markets for the produce and dairy each has on sale.  That way you don't have to survive on Ramen alone!  Use those leftovers too.  Buying in bulk means you can cook in bulk.  Freeze leftovers you can't eat within 3 days for future meals.  I recycle foods a lot.  Tonights chicken will be tomorrow nights chicken and rice soup.  Soups, stews and casseroles are great ways to take all those on sale ingredients and make a filling dish.  Clip coupons but remember the value in store brands.  Often times stores brands are still cheaper than name brands with coupons.  Coupons can be doubled and even tripled some places.  The best tip is just to have a budget and stick to it.  Don't just go to the store and buy whatever you want.  You need a game plan to save money.|`|sP98NDi5aa	Anything with pasta is on the cheaper side. Lasagna, or even just plain making noodles with sauce. Other than that PB&J sandwiches.|`|AA11600789	Ha, ha, ha...my boyfriend teases me because I once got 11 meals out of a Sam's Club pre-cooked chicken!  Used some breast meat for dinner that night on a big salad, rest of breast went to a cold sandwich and a hot sandwich with gravy/potatoes & peas on the side.  Picked all the rest of the meat off and made chicken salad (with dried cranberries, toasted walnuts and a touch of dill in the mayo), added some to a pesto sauced pizza, made and froze chicken croquettes,  Simmered the whole carcass with a little carrot and celery to make a broth that I froze with any little bits of the chicken left...I don't know what else!  Get use to picking up the sales flyers from your local supermarkets, plan before you go and make a list, stick to the list and NEVER go food shopping when you're hungry!  Shop with a friend or your mother, so you can split that huge package of celery or lettuce that you only need 1 piece of for lunch.  Really get to notice and read the little price/price per pound tags under each item and the weight of packages. (Just bought a medium sized jar of peanut butter.  The large "bulk" one was MORE money per pound than the smaller one!)<br>  <br>  Live cheap? Remember what your mother told you. Turn off the lights when leaving a room.  Close the refrigerator door.  Shut the front door when the heat or AC is on ("What?  Do you live in a barn?).  Watch your "impulse buys".  That sweater may look good today, but when you have no money left on Friday night to go out or you're rent's a little short....<br>  <br>  Wish you the best of luck!|`|rg2qMxT5aa	make enough for 2 nights<br>  go to warehouse stores/ costco<br>  plan ahead<br>  coupons<br>  use oddles of noodles with veggies and stuff<br>  dont buy junk food<br>  eggs can be dinner<br>  freeze stuff and dont be to good for leftovers<br>  make meats like chicken for 2 nights and one night eat with<br>  noodles, next night potatoes. all you have to do<br>  is heat up the chicken.|`|D8x0w6FMaa	I always get the whole frozen chickens and cook them. You can just eat it as chicken or you can make other things out of it as well.|`|zawmsUO1aa	My all-time favorite cheap meal is a baked potato with canned (or home-made) chili poured over it. If I'm feeling spendy, I add some shredded cheese and sour cream. <br>  <br>  Familiarize yourself with prices and if you see a good deal, don't just buy one, buy three and build up a little pantry of canned and dry foods. Consider using store brands; most of them have a money back guarantee. Be flexible with your menu - sometimes, seasonal foods are less expensive. Example: fresh asparagus is more expensive in the wintertime. Steer clear of prepackaged convenience foods like Shake & Bake, frozen mac & cheese and Hamburger Helper and make your own for pennies. Spend a rainy Sunday making chili or soup and freeze some in 1 or 2-cup portions for later use; a full freezer runs more efficiently, so you might as well pack it full of food.<br>  <br>  We also have a large stash of rice, dried beans & peas, pasta and TVP (textured vegetable protein) <br>  <br>  I could go on, but you get the general idea. You don't have to live on ramen noodles to save money on food, it just takes some planning. <br>  <br>  Good luck stretching that food buck - we're all doing it.<br>  <br>  Print coupons without divulging personal info here-<br>  <a href="http://print.coupons.com/Couponweb/Index.aspx?pid=13306&zid=iq37&nid=10" rel="nofollow">http://print.coupons.com/Couponweb/Index...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.redplum.com/SetLocation.aspx?redirect=/pages/Grocery.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.redplum.com/SetLocation.aspx?...</a>|`|oojO4WAraa	Dried beans are very cheap and nutritious.  Pintos and lentils do not require presoaking so they are quick.  People don't need as much meat as they eat - so when you use meat stretch it by adding additional veggies - like refried beans and anaheim peppers to your taco filling; pepper, onions and zuchini to your spaghetti sauce, etc.

rb6hpqjwaa	I dream everyday and I don't even eat cheese.|`|VdbhuUYBaa	No.<br>  <br>  If you breath oxygen you dream.|`|CB15kchkaa	Cheese is full of protein and protein keeps you awake. So if you're tired and eat cheese you will probably still fall asleep, but have lucid dreams as your consciousness will still be pretty alert. To help stay awake try red bull or coffee and stay away from starchy foods and milk.<br>  <br>  happy birthday, alcohol can make you sleepy but it depends on what you drink. If you drink white alcohol such as Gin or vodka, it's more likely to keep you going especially vodka with redbull!|`|b73296a75da0c37af734e3ef9c03113baa	Everyone who is not a meditator dreams. It doesn't matter a bit what you eat in terms of what you will dream about, or how frequestly you will dream. You may or may not remember your dreams -- that is a completely different issue. <br>  For staying awake -- try cold showers and exciting activity, conversation or thought. Dark Chocolate has a ton of Caffein in it. A good strong cup of Lady Grey Tea will keep you awake for a while; and of course you can go to Starbucks for a double salted caramel hot chocolate with four shots of espresso  -- That should keep you up all night -- but it is so delicious it could become addictive!|`|DnWsMhwLaa	are you familiar with winsor mckay's dreams of a rarebit fiend series? it was kind of all about how a certain type of cheese sandwich gave him crazy dreams.|`|b9uOax0aaa	Coffee|`|dd15228a42b4652d8768334912349b61aa	Why do you wat to stay awake ALL night? is the question I'd ask first.|`|Fcwcrx4Laa	ive heard eating cheese can give you nightmares lol but dont think its true.As for staying up all night you can buy a dissolving powderd drink called glucose you can buy it from most supermarkets, i think bodycare also sells it.|`|2qbLrHBKaa	Congratulations!
