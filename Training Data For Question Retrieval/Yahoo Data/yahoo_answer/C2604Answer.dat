3NoQuoWuaa	She is claiming delayed injuries such as next day whiplash etc. Probably included is lost wages pain and suffering. At this time, an answer to your question is at best a guess. Your best source of info is the attorney but the insurance company will only defend you up to your policy limits. If it appears the case will exceed your $50,000.00, they will surrender the limits to the plaintiff and walk away leaving you on the hook for the rest. Unless there is a settlement prior to court date you can count on the court date to be at least two years out from now. I hate saying it but you are at the mercy of the legal system and not a whole lot you can do but let it run it's course and hope for the best.r|`|kjAWsDwLaa	The insurance companies are pretty darned good at sniffing out fraud, inflated claims and such, so leave it to them.  She'll need to prove what she's claiming, and if she can't, she might be up for fraud.  If she can, however, as the others mentioned, the amount over $50K is out of your pocket.|`|jChr0udLaa	If you lose the case the plaintiff can come after any savings, investments, and even your future wages. Good luck to you, sounds like the lady is scamming you|`|N8xZpWpSaa	It depends on your state. I'm an insurance agent in California and <br>  if you don't have the liability amount over $50,000 in cash, then your checking and savings accounts, money market accounts, stocks, bonds and mutual funds as well as future wages and personal property could be at risk. I wish i had better news for you but that's why I tell my clients to get 250/500. Which is 250,000 per person and $500,000 per accident liability coverage.<br>  <br>  EDIT - By the way with her declining medical care at the time of the accident it does give your attorney an avenue for disputing the validity of her injury,|`|nAK8bm91aa	You can't get Blood from a stone tell them.

NfjCXQTFaa	When the first auto transmission was put in a Wrangler, it wasn't even called a Wrangler yet.  It was actually one of the predecessors to the current wrangler, the CJ7.  The transmission that was used, the TH400, was first used in the 1976 Jeep CJ7 (the CJ7's debut year), in front of the Borg Warner 13-39 Quadratrac transfer case. (The 13-39 is full time 4x4 with low range)  The "Jeep" TH400 is actually a Chevy transmission and it shares the same internal components with the true TH400, but this particular one had a unique bellhousing and case to allow it to mate with the AMC engine block bolt pattern. The Jeep TH400 will not bolt up to any standard small block Chevy bolt pattern without adapters.<br>  <br>  American Motor Co, (AMC) the parent co. of Jeep at the time is famous, or rather notorious, for using whatever parts they could find, no matter who made them. There’s a standing joke that AMC stands for All Manufacturers Components, for that reason.<br>  <br>  After use of the TH400 began in 76, it was discontinued in 1979.<br>  <br>  In 1980 and ending with the final CJ7 in 1986 the TF904 and TF909 became options behind the 4cyl engines. (The 909 is a 904 with TC lockup).  The 6cyl's got the TF999 during that period.<br>  <br>  After that (the 1992-1995 YJ era) the 30RH, 3 speed split gears behind 2.5L 4cly’s <br>  <br>  In 1992 the 32RH 3 speed, found a home under YJ Wrangler sheet metal and was used until 2003 in the TJ, when it was replaced by the 4 speed, 42RLE that is still in use behind the 3.8L V6 in the JK.<br>  <br>  Because of AMCs, “whatever we can get” mentality, this carried over into the early in the Chrysler – Jeep days until Chrysler was able to straighten things out. As such, these production years (much more so from the mid 80’s to early 90’s when AMC was taken over and Chrysler took the reigns) are a little fuzzy.  I’ve seen odd combinations of engine and transmissions in years that were not official production years for them.|`|5de8ae1b663a9b3b8e2564d52425aec1aa	You can get current Jeep Wranglers with an auto and 4x4, as well as the previous model - the TJ (1997 to 2006) with automatics as well AND the YJ - it has been an option for around 20 years.<br>  Only the current JK is available in 2wd (unless you're buying a postal jeep), so any automatic you find will will be 4x4.

RdVaoHztaa	You can talk the dealers down 1000's right now. They are super desperate. Get up and walk away. Do not sign the first day. <br>  <br>  Just act like you are going to get up and walk away and keep repeating over and over:<br>  <br>  Is that the best price you can do? <br>  <br>  Do not purchase the vehicle until the Sales person has to bring over the sales manager and then repeat to him: <br>  <br>  Is that the best price you can do? <br>  <br>  Repeat that statement over and over and smile. And then get up and walk away. The once you've finalized a price ask for extras.
muPiBQ3Uaa	If the K&N is over-oiled, it can cause driveability issues when the oil gets on the heated wire inside the sensor. I have had to clean some of the MAF sensors out when they were over-oiled and caused the "Service Engine" light to come on.<br>  <br>  Just follow the instructions with the filter recharge kit, and you will be fine.|`|xVUyR3NZaa	Experiences can vary, but GM issued a warranty admin bulletin in 2000 instructing dealers to consider the warranty for the MAF sensor null and void if an 'aftermarket oiled type air filter' has been installed, and that any MAF related repairs be performed at the customer's expense.|`|oti98oqUaa	No not at all. It just lets the engine breathe more efficiently. The mass air sensor will still read the amount of air coming in and adjust the air/fuel mixture accordingly.|`|AA11264416	nope, i have the K&N air intake kit on my 98 chevy silverado 5.7L, what you seem to be talking about, not just the replacement stock filter but the kit that replaces the whole intake system from the filter and filter box to the throttle body, it as easy to install and haven't had any problems with it, it reuses the stock sensors, just go over the instructions to make sure you don't leave anything out and make sure to plug everything back in, its not hard to install unless your just really bad with cars lol, if the engine light does come on then its probably just that you forgot to plug in a sensor or sensors|`|AA11501437	i have heard of this happening, but in 8 years at a shop, i have never seen it.  the roumer is the chemicals from the k&n can cause the maf to malfunction...again, never seen it happen and have installed hundreds of k&ns.

6xyeYjkkaa	Like ironball says, check the title. Most companies change their model year in August so a car built after August of 2001 would be a 2002.

hruifN0Qaa	Yes.  Although you are a lot safer wearing a seat belt, it is not always going to save your life.  I spent many years as a firefighter responding to accident scenes.  You can suffer traumatic injuries depending on many factors such as; Speed, side impact, rollover, and the type of vehicle you drive.<br>  You might also fly out and land in the path of a vehicle and get run over.  Or you could land under your vehicle and slide over 100 feet on the pavement.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps you out.|`|mCbhjcLuaa	If you hit a 36 ton truck head on in a 2400 lb car (both traveling at 70 mph) unbelievable forces can shear your car and body in half like a hot knife through butter.<br>  Where any particular body part winds up is anybodies guess.<br>  If you hit a oak tree dead on at 70 mph regardless of crumple zones (with out air bags) this will easily shear off seat belt bolts, ejecting you, the car could wind up on top of you (front or back seat).<br>  If you have a head on accident in 2 cars the same weight at 55mph that are not equip with knee bolster air bags you could get out of the car, walk a couple steps and collapse due to severed femoral arteries.<br>  Just drive safe :)|`|723c7cb5953ba3908aba706688deac1aaa	It depends on how well you have the seat belt on, and if there are any defects in the design or manufacture, or it has been damaged.<br>  <br>  I would say that yes, it is possible to fly out of the window if wearing a seat belt, especially if the belt is too loose, or if it is of the sash-only, or lap-only, design.|`|wpgRMjgraa	I would say yes its possible only if the seat broke during the accident.|`|4f794ec7691416e516e1475a13f3f2caaa	I doubt whether any tests have been carried out for such an eventuality but I am sure that the possibility of such an accident happening is remote. The wearing of a seat belt is designed to prevent your body being propelled forward when the vehicle has come to a rapid stop, not to fly off at a tangent.

bkhvdfJxaa	if your worried about having to change the engine quickly...i would choose the supra over the fc anyday...for one, the supra engine is easier to rebuild and with proper care it will last for a long time...while the fc and its fast aging motor will need to have lots of maintanance time and care...also rotory engines are a pain to deal with....|`|pl6Mh5K1aa	Motors usually don't blow with age if they are well taken care of, motors only blow when they are mistreated. <br>  <br>  Rev the engine up and see if you hear any knocking or noises, that's your best bet to see if the motor has seen better days. If it still sounds new then chances are that motor is still in top shape.|`|YKt4uxoWaa	The 7MGE and 7MGTE have a reputation for head gasket failure, but it is easily rectified by torquing the cylinder head bolts down more. Wikipedia has more info about it.<br>  <br>  As for the FC, it depends on how it is cared for. A properly maintained one will easily reach 200k with no issues. on www.rx7club.com, there is a thread about an engine that reached 400k. Plus, my grandpa's RX4 hit 375,000 miles just before he sold it. It really depends on how it's treated.
5OEIftHjaa	lots of variables there. 60k-70k miles is when things like spark plugs and accessory belts get worn out. Its worth it as a preventive measure If its your daily transportation. $500 is steep, but its a BMW so that makes sense. I would do your checkup for free if you let me take your car out for a spin afterwards.|`|SBk7CF4maa	definitely if you plan on keeping this car for a while. a look over now would eliminate possible more expensive problems from going wrong all at once costing a lot of money. it also could give you an idea of when or how much longer you have until you need a major repair.|`|u0lRzaXSaa	I have been a BMW owner for over 20 years and have owned both old ones and new ones. I did the inspections when I got my first BMW but a couple of years later I figured out they are for the most part a rip off. These inspections are planned to keep you coming back to the BMW dealer to give him a steady revenue stream. He needs it due to his high overhead.<br>  Save the money spent on inspections to fix something that breaks at some future date and you will be way ahead. Make sure that all of the fluids are changed as required (oil, differential, antifreeze, transmission, brake fluid). The brake sensor will tell you when the brakes need changing. The spark plugs will go 100K miles and the serpentine belt will also last that long although you can inspect it every few months as easily as a technician can.<br>  If you cannot do some of this maintenance yourself, find a good independent mechanic that has a lot of experience with European cars and use him instead of the dealer for maintenance and repairs.|`|1rd0uf94aa	If you are talking about the 60,000 mile inspection, you should look in the owner's manual for everything it includes. The oil change portion would be about $120 alone. They do a complete inspection, but also change out all the fluids and filters and verify all the computerized stuff is set properly.. It takes several hours of labor and not something I would ever trust to someone who is not an expert. Your backyard mechanic and your neighborhood shop are not equipped to handle this service.|`|Yukk3YIPaa	What does the Checkup include? <br>  I just did my own service changed belts, oil Used bmw 5W30 synthetic, filter, drain and fill trans fluid. drain and fill differential with XA SF Fluid from BMW, changed air filter, changed fuel filter, changed wipers, drained and filled cooling system.probably spent 150.00 on parts but I get most of my parts wholesale.  Differential fluid was $60.00 for 3 !/2 liter bottles.  So $500.00 may be good if it includes all this plus labor.|`|gsjjiRGFaa	i'd like to think you could have this done at a reputable shop for quite a bit less money. $500 is very steep for what will amount to be mostly an oil change, tire rotation, brake inspection, fluid condition check & top off. most of the items underlined in your manual are/should be checked when your vehicle is on the rack for any reason. i could see this better behind <$200 glasses.|`|HylaEat6aa	For $500.00 NO WAY!!!<br>      If you are just buying from a private party, ask for records and read what has been done if no records are around for you to see find out what the auto manufacturer recommends service whiz for that many miles. A simple Lube, Oil, & Filter will tell you if there is something wrong the dealers do this to look for additional work needed they can sell and is part of that service. Do not pay $500.00 you are being ripped off! <br>      If you are going to auto agency and they gave you that estimate for inspection, shame on them they are not looking out for your best interests, only your money. Like I said find out what manufacturer requires. If you are worried about body and or frame damage then have a simple under car inspection, you could go to alignment shop for this or even a place that specializes in suspension and brakes having them inspect under car and brake condition under $100.00.<br>      Your engine should be in great shape at 60K no need to check, through a lube, oil, and filter and have them note any under chassis problems if so make sure you are shown these problems so to educate yourself and make sure you are not being ripped off.<br>      Always remember to read the manufactures service required section in your owners manual, Be Smart, Be Safe, and Be In Control of Your Money.<br>      Special note if you are running a car fax, they are not always correct and I have run into incorrect findings before on Cadillac EXT that had major work done on body and was also from a dealer in Texas<br>  that lied through their teeth on safety inspection.

Don't you WANT something that is going to be reliable and SAFE?  <br>  <br>  Ford Focus is your best bet.  100k mile, transferrable powertrain warranty, 5 star crash safety rating, and VERY reliable. <br>  <br>  Of course that's just my opinion - stay away from the Probe :P!|`|b903943506a30e33141e4e9a48318686aa	I've owned 3 Probes and as long as you keep up on oil changes, filters, all the regular stuff they're perfectly reliable...  Yeah, there's the ones that have been beat to hell, but it's pretty easy to spot a car that's been raced regularly.<br>  If you get a 4-cyl, learn to drive stick.  You'll be better off in both power and reliability.<br>  Buy a chilton's manual and do your own repairs, your wallet will thank you and nothing's THAT hard.<br>  As far as things that are prone to breaking...<br>  -Distributor ignitor (new disty if it goes)<br>  -CV joints (if you drive like me at least)<br>  -Leaking valve cover gaskets<br>  -Normal stuff (alternator and such)|`|3CxtflUsaa	Whichever vehicle you buy, I'd suggest you get a Chilton's or Haynes manual for it. These books is very detailed and have pictures and addresses every problem your vehicle may have. It will save you money if you decide to fix it yourself or the very least, you'll have the knowledge of what's up before you go to a mechanic who may try to tell you it needs more than it really does. <br>  <br>  The Ford is an easy vehicle to repair but in a lot of cases you will need to buy Ford parts which can be pricey. GM, Chevy and Dodge can use after market parts - these are parts made by different companies and are cheaper.<br>  <br>  Any car is reliable if it's been taken care of. It may look pretty but it's whats on the inside that counts. <br>  <br>  Be sure to check the transmission (feel for mis shifts, slipping gears, noises, banging into gear, hesitation into a gear from another). Look at the underneath real well - no cracks, bad rust, massive leaks or metal shavings should be visible. These are all indications of various problems that are costly. <br>  <br>  Also, do a Vehix check on the VIN number. This should show you all repairs and it's history. <br>  <br>  Otherwise, I had my Ford for 21 years straight and not much a problem I couldn't fix.|`|OmcBziKVaa	I drove a Probe for my first car, and it was awesome. I drove it for years before buying a Mustang. I can honestly say that car had a ton of personality and sometimes I still miss it- for the most part. Below I will list the pro's of the car and things to watch out for.<br>  <br>  Pro:<br>  1. Having a hatchback is rare and awesome gift from the automotive industry. You WILL find ways to take advantage of this space.<br>  2. The seats are remarkably comfortable. I drove mine from Michigan to Colorado... without stopping. (except for gas and food, of course)<br>  3. If you get one with a V6, you will get rather respectable gas mileage AND horsepower. A few simple mods, and you will have a very fun car that gets 30mpg reliably.<br>  4. Insurance isn't bad at all. The car has enough safety features to draw the price down- if you are a good student it'll go down even more.<br>  5. Headlights that pop up.<br>  <br>  Cons:<br>  1. The 4 cylinder is a little sluggish. A standard transmission will help.<br>  2. Speaking of transmissions, the one in mine went bad for no decernable reason. It cost $1300 to replace. Ouch<br>  3. if anything does go wrong, sometimes parts are hard to come by.<br>  4. Headlights that pop up.<br>  <br>  Really, if you can find a quality used one, it'll rock. Just like any car, though, if you get a lemon no one's gonna be happy.|`|gWlmU1KJaa	ford probe is fine if you like it<br>  <br>  underneath its much the same as a ford focus<br>  same basic zetec engine<br>  <br>  just get it serviced, the cam belt replaced every 3 years, and keep it washed and waxed and wash away winter salt underneath and its good for years|`|AA10344919	Stay away. It will cost you $$$.
6xyeYjkkaa	Absolutely. He can run the plates of any car he wants. However they usually only do it when something makes them suspicious. So what did you do to attract his attention?|`|AA11264416	yes they do have that right, could run plates to see if the plates are reported stolen, but yes a police officer does have that right to run random tags if the cop chooses to|`|8GDBr2U9aa	Obviously, they can. Suspended plates is probable cause to pull you over.|`|7274403b2b4f83ec6c150a8f7b80a02aaa	Well, lets see, your driving with expired plates/license so I would bet you were doing >something< to have gotten the troopers attention....<br>  <br>  things that come to mind.....talking on the cell phone, tailgating, lane changes with no signal, speeding, slowing down then speeding up, driving too slow thus impeding the flow of traffic and last but not least..maybe he was just having a bad day.<br>  <br>  Does he have to give you a reason? Nope.|`|BGPa2DqYaa	You Bet! That's one of the reasons they have Hi-end PC in there vehicles.It was a Holiday when they got them and didn't have to call "Central" for a Plate ID. BTW They can ALSO run out-Of-State Plates,|`|7L0zp7O6aa	How else would he have caught you driving illegally?  If your license is suspended, that means you are uninsured so I think him for keeping you off the road.|`|3mu1IWTzaa	yes, that is their function. they don't need probable cause to check your plates; if they come back OK you'd never know they did it! so make sure your drivers' license has the correct address, because they won't forward notifications of, for example, suspended plates, for, e.g, lapsed insurance. oh, and call your insurance agent.|`|a1ddcae78f9848320ad0b8246c9c1087aa	Yes, that's why we put plates on a car.<br>  <br>  Some places even use video enforcement, in that they drive a car equipped with TV camers through a parking lot, the plates are identified using letter recognition, and run through the DMV computer.  Instant detection of expired plates, stolen, etcetera.
VUo09gpuaa	I don't think this is recognised as a problem. From one of the other answers here we can all learn that it is obviously not a good idea to overtake a vehicle with hazards on whether they should be or not.<br>  Even with indicators flashing you should not rely on the driver doing what is indicated.<br>  There are some idiots now using indicators of roundabouts to show that they are changing lanes on the roundabout when they should only be used to indicate where you are about to leave the roundabout|`|FWOdlpx8aa	Does this need a solution....?<br>  <br>  If one is driving you usually approach another vehicle from behind or in front...<br>  <br>  On the occasion you do meet a vehicle side on, its usually at a cross roads where a turn would be expected.|`|AA12334360	my cars flashes in a different cadance with hazzards on. Its about 2 quick and one slower flash<br>  <br>  but that doesn't help because (a) there are not many of my car about and (b) pople don't know why its like that so think I've a fault<br>  <br>  db9<br>  <br>  I think the top-end mercs do the same<br>  <br>  edit: just checked, mine is 3 quick and a gap, 3 quick and a gap, 3 quick and a gap etc etc.......|`|31Ttgqlbaa	Some people drive with their hazard lights on in bad weather (rain, snow storm, etc.) or when they have a problem (tire blow out) and need to get off of the road. And Hazard lights should only be used in emergencies when a car is stopped on the side of the road and not to park illegally in the fire lane and run into Walmart for a few minutes.<br>  <br>  Just drive slow when approaching a car with any flashing lights weather they're turn signals or hazard lights. People that have hazard lights on don't want cars speeding by them fast. And if they're fixing to pull out, be prepared for that, but if you collide with them, the accident would be their fault for failing to yield to traffic already on the road.<br>  <br>  There's really no solution if you can only see one side of the car. Just drive defensively.|`|2Y2AFV7Kaa	This annoys me as well hazards should only be activated if you are causing an obstruction or are broken down. The number of small van drivers and delivery vehicles who park in a line of parked vehicles and then turn their hazards on gets longer every day.this is ignorance on the part of the driver but try telling them and all you get is a mouthful of abuse.A solution doesn't need to be found just charge the drivers with using a vehicle without due care and attention but we all know this will never happen|`|5O7op0oIaa	Hazard lights shouldn't be used whilst the vehicle is in motion, so this shouldn't ever come up. It's quite clear in the Highway Code.|`|f16135be2aee5d27de11802f8dd54704aa	The answer is already in the Highway Code.<br>  It is a real shame people don't pay any attention to it.<br>  <br>  These days hazard lights are used to mean, I know I shouldn't be parked here, but what the heck, I can put these flashing lights on and go buy my pack of cigarettes anyway.|`|AA12342438	Hazard lights mean - I  have stopped - beware I have a flat tire - my motor quit - need help. Or I am driving slow watch out. You can see them from the back or front of the vehicle, they are blinking lights. If you only see one side of the vehicle, they are changing lanes or leaving the lane, give me room I am pulling in front of you - sorry. Really he could have blinking lights on one side and go the other way. Blinking lights slow down be care full. Watch out for those girl drivers! OOPS, pulled a bo-bo.
VEIkVDtIaa	not all models have the outside temperature display.  none have an MPG feature.<br>  <br>  check page 61 of the owners manual on how to select the outside temp display through the use of the SEL/RESET button.  if you have it then you can select it through that button.  if your car is not equipped with that function you won't be able to select it no matter what.<br>  <br>  you didn't note what model car you have.  typically only the EX or SI will have the added features.  The LX and DX usually don't have the higher level of features.  <br>  <br>  Also, I assume the car is in the US.  other markets have different combinations of accessories.<br>  <br>  hope that helps|`|42b68e89556dc280a2061994ea854c1aaa	If you have a 2006-2009 Civic Hybrid.<br>  <br>  On the left side of dash you will see a button with a thermometer symbol.

htbrtnWFaa	Other people has posted higher speeds, but with safety in mind, I would not go faster than 35 mph on a doughnut. They are designed to be light and small and they sit under your car or in your trunk and get old. Replace as soon as you can, there is nothing more embarrassing than having your spare go flat as well. <br>  Good luck|`|dVQdswtTaa	While it's not really recommended, you can probably drive that distance on a donut spare. Remember that the spare isn't meant for high speeds (over 50 mph, or about 80 kph)<br>  <br>  Just be aware that it will not handle as well, especially in an emergency turn or stop, and if it goes flat, you're without a tire or a spare.|`|1xkc6Ktmaa	As long as you keep your speeds low it should last plenty long.|`|f06Sy0dfaa	Donought tires usually last about 100 miles, but since your getting it replaces immediately it shouldn't be a problem. Most people treat donoughts as a regular tire, but it's bad for it. So, just go ahead and get what you need done and have it repaired asap. You should be good.|`|6xyeYjkkaa	It should be alright but be aware they are not designed for more than 45 MPH and are only meant for short term use.|`|hJk9YZrAaa	That much driving on a spare is a bad idea.

AA11264416	yes its a different hitch, its called a 5th wheel hitch, it mounts to the frame in the bed right over the axle, also you'd need at least a 3/4 ton truck (2500 or F250) or a 1 ton (3500 or F350), a 1/2 ton (1500 or F150) won't do the job once you get to hills and things like that, you'll also need a wiring harness for the camper, also the truck will need to be a long bed because of the clearance of the camper and truck cab for when you turn, if its a short bed the camper will hit the truck cab when you turn, if it was something like a horse trailer you could have a regular bed|`|k55p1pKraa	The hitch that you have now is for a pull type trailer, there's no way to modify it to pull a fifth wheel . You will need to buy a hitch that bolt inside of your truck bed. The fifth wheel comes on a frame that you  can remove from the bed when it's not in use. From so reason i'm thinking it's around 300. bucks.|`|zruhNGKbaa	You go to the RV and Camper store and they will be happy to sell and install a 5Th wheel hitch in your truck bed.  <br>  <br>  I recommend the Husky 16K series hitch - it features a easy removal mounting rail system allowing you to remove 4 pins and lift the hitch out of the bed so that you have full use of your truck bed when not towing your trailer.  It may be a quick operation but it does require 2 people to lift the hitch assembly out and back in due to the weight of the hitch.  <br>  <br>  It also has a rolling bed which allows it to be used in a short box truck. When tight maneuvering is necessary you simply release the lock and slide it back for additional clearance - then release it again to slide it forward to the normal towing position for proper weight distribution.  <br>  <br>  And yes, a 3/4 ton or heavier truck is recommended if you intend to travel any distance with your 5Th wheel camper, if you are serious about long distance hauling you should use a diesel engine truck.  <br>  <br>  If you only plan on towing it for short in state and reasonably level routes the 1/2 ton will do the job as long as the trailer does not exceed the trucks maximum rated towing capacity and the truck is equipped with the trailer tow prep package which includes a heavy duty radiator and a transmission cooler.|`|LIxpXTnLaa	The receiver for a fifth wheel mounts inside the bed of the truck. It resembles the big plate on semi's the trailer hitch sits on.  It is bolted through the bed and into the frame.<br>  <br>  No, you either have a fifth wheel hitch or you don't.|`|sp7yqqKNaa	5th wheels need a special box mounted hitch <br>  <br>  unless you really need it, deffinatley not worth it, you lose half of your box|`|434ae21c53144cc6040a9999bb94dfc6aa	go to rv store or camper supply and they will set you up|`|7AhDA2tmaa	Yes, you have to get a special hitch that is attached to your truck bead. Try going to a tractor supply store, they should have one, and be able to tell you how to put it on. It does however require a little work.
sEoB4TVIaa	How stupid would you have to be to go speeding up the road and pass a cop anyway?If there is one thing I know after 48 years of living is that Big Brother is watching!|`|WO68RZdIaa	No, the police do not have to advertise that you are subject to any form of speed monitoring while driving down the road. Common sense should kick in when you are driving & your brain should tell you that if you speed, you could be stopped and issued a citation, and shouldn't need road signs cluttering up the side of the roads warning you that your speed may be monitored.<br>  <br>  The laser speed detection devices have not be perfected yet to be able to be used from a moving vehicle & still has to be used from a stationary position. From a moving vehicle, the officer will have to resort to the old tried & true radar gun or VASCAR. <br>  <br>  And if you are approaching a police car from behind, there is always the possibility that the car may have a rear facing radar device & you could get caught speeding even though the police car is in front of you.|`|UzJRCEEFaa	as far as, can they check you while moving...<br>  <br>  I live in a smalltown in the midwest were we see the cops catch speeders all the time.  I have seen them whip u-turns, follow cars, get them while sitting, even from helicopters, they can tell if you are speeding and send a unit after you, and if you try to be sneak and slowdown and the cop radar doesnt get you they have proof from the helecopter<br>  <br>  you know them little white boxes you see ever now and then, they are in every lane, at the same spot, then a few yards there is a second set?<br>  <br>  those are placed to where it takes 5 or 6 seconds to get to the second set.  If you pass both of them in 4 seconds, that is how helecopters or airplanes can tell if you are speeding.<br>  <br>  sorry mr officer (above) for revealing secrets, I was a truck driver for a while where every driver is a know it all, and by the way, CA weigh stations and y'alls 40 fofoot law sucks.  Do you know how many headaches that causes trying to slide tandems and return to warehouses to tell them you are overweight, 2 or 3 times in a row?

WXAkvhImaa	Pros: The sub isn't taking up airspace in the box, so there can be in increase in volume which might improve low end response.<br>  <br>  Also, some people like the appearance.<br>  <br>  Cons:  If you're watching the subs play with the trunk open, you're going to hear vent noise and mechanical noise from the motor.  You don't really hear it from the driver's seat though.<br>  <br>  Also, it's hard to make the wiring look good.

57ZUVXeCaa	I bought a Jeep Compass and I absolutely love it. I test drove the Compass and the Patriot, and I definitely favored the Compass. I've had it for over a year now, and I wouldn't change the decision I made. Test drive a bunch of cars, and see what you like. Especially since this will be your first car, you want to make sure you get what you want, since you'll have it for a while. The gas mileage on the Compass is great. I do a lot of in-town driving, and I get about 21 miles to the gallon. I know to people who drive cars around, that doesn't sound like a lot, but it's a big step up from my old '94 Ford Explorer lol<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|XLHrIFA4aa	Jeeps aren't incredibly bad, I just don't like them. I borrowed my grandfather's Jeep and I was surprised. They brake and gas pedal were way too sensitive. I also disliked it because the engine sounds like a large truck, but is weak. Jeeps are really just raw traction, they have 4WD, but aren't as advanced as newer cars with traction control systems, like RWD beamers. I wouldn't recommend a Jeep unless you expect to be towing stuff, live in a place where you think you need 4WD, and only have a budget for a Jeep.|`|ezzSeBnLaa	I'm a jeep lover but I think they're ugly and generic.

I have a 2005 Wrangler. The ONLY problem I have ever really heard of is from the Japanese automatic transmission that was put on some. They typically go at about 100k-150k depending on how well they are taken care of. They get pretty much the best gas mileage for any 4-wheel drive SUV in its class. They are also comfortable, and any minor issues are cheap to fix.|`|FZjXs7lPaa	i have a wrangler and i love it. theyre fun, cool, and reliable. a patriot is a great choice and will serve you well. all the maintenance ive gotten on my jeep has been warranted be the dealer.|`|D7ikv9Zaaa	Very nice jeep and good quality.<br>  <br>  Do some more research GOOGLE this.

The theory is that the driver behind you should have been more alert, and given you enough room to supposedly "roll back".

A good insurance adjuster will look at the pictures of the damage to both vehicles & be able to tell that you were rear ended.  It is hard for anyone to say that you were not stopped when you are hit in the rear.  Rule of thumb is that if you are hit in the rear end (unless you backed into a pole, etc.) they other party is at fault.  A former claims adjuster in the State of California.|`|yJsaZXHoaa	No police report and no witnesses to corroborate either story, your insurance will probably believe you.  It is more likely for someone to rear end someone than it is for someone's vehicle to roll backwards.  My suggestion is to contact her insurance and advise them of the rear end loss.  And yes, give them your statement.  If she really rear ended you, you have nothing to hide.|`|5ZdJNddvaa	I don't know CA laws, but where I live it doesn't matter if you WERE rolling back, it is her responsibility to stay back far enough.  It is always the person's fault who rear ends the other person.
W5h8cuJTaa	Try <a href="http://personal-financial-help.solutionsarticles.com" rel="nofollow">http://personal-financial-help.solutions...</a> they aren't that bad (7% for me) and definitely quick.|`|9AGTYeU7aa	I think your best bet is going to a dealership with a special finance department. See if they can get you approved for a loan and match you up with a car and what the terms would be, then it's your choice from there. If your credit is bad you will have to pay a higher interest rate, but if you pay on time you can refinance at a later date and bring those payments down. Good luck.|`|IA7Gy9TAaa	Bear with me here and hear me out.<br>  <br>  I think you're the perfect candidate for a brand new Kia or a Hyundai.  They come with outstanding warranties and buying a brand new car will mean you can finance it for a long time to keep the payments low.  They're also used to helping people with low credit at these dealerships, lets face it, we're not talking about a Cadillac, right?  They deal with banks on a regular basis that help people with bad credit.  I worked at a Kia dealership a few years ago and I've seen people with credit scores like yours get approved.  The economy was a little different back then though so I'm not sure it's still possible, but I think this is your best bet.<br>  <br>  The real catch to buying one of these is that you've got to drive it until the wheels fall off, it's really the catch if you buy any car brand new.  They do depreciate quickly but if you keep it for ten + years, remember bumper to bumper for 5 yr./60k and 10 yr./100k powertrain, who really cares what the resale is.  Unless it's a toyota or a honda just about any $12,000 - $16,000 car is only going to be worth a couple grand at the end.  Your market will be a Rio or a Spectra, both will have power windows and doors, CD, cruise control and keyless entry so you don't have to feel like you're driving a bargain basement vehicle.<br>  <br>  With the current market you will still have a tough time getting a loan but I think this is your best shot.  Otherwise you'll be looking at going to a loan shark "buy here/pay here" lot with an outrageously overpriced old car with sketchy reliability or stuck saving up for another few months so you can buy an unreliable $3,000 car outright, also a lousy option.|`|PA7kYyAxaa	Another take:<br>  <br>  You need a good used car for which you can pay cash, not finance. NEVER finance a car. It's bad policy. It's expensive. It robs you of your money.<br>  <br>  NEVER take advice from broke people (Would you take behavioral advice from a homeless person?)|`|FKoPF6hraa	Financed cars is more expensive to insurance cause it requires full coverage.

HylaEat6aa	I have worked in the automotive field for 35 years, not BMW, but here goes. Basically all cars are the same to a point if the windshield wipers keep running you can go to the fuse panel and pull fuse, your owners manuel should tell you where they are and or if you can get to wiper motor under hood pull plug to wiper motor. Fuse would be easiest to pull and the fuse panel should lead you to correct one to pull.|`|CFA4KG2Uaa	the lever next to the steering wheel should be able to turn them off the one that changes the speed for the wipers should be able to turn them off.
RbsRpcIyaa	Are you asking for our permission? Or are you asking if the car is worth the price you quoted?<br>  <br>  If you're asking for our permission, then: "Yes, you may purchase this vehicle".<br>  <br>  **EDIT** -- -Ah, ok. Makes better sense now.<br>  <br>  The 6-cylinders in Highlanders are solid engines, and 114,000 miles on a 6-year old vehicle isn't "that" high. You should see 200,000 miles on this vehicle with proper maintenance. Before you purchase it, spend $50-100 or so and have a Toyota Certified mechanic check it out for you. You want to make sure the previous owner didn't skimp on maintenance themselves.|`|IA7Gy9TAaa	That's a little too much for that many miles.  <br>  <br>  KBB says good condition is worth about $8,000.  Fair is worth about $7,000.  With as many miles as it has there's absolutely no chance it's in excellent condition and good condition is very unlikely.  Read through their guide to accurately assess what category it falls into.  Most cars with that many miles will fall into "fair."  Fair just means it needs at least some repair, like a power mirror doesn't work or it has at least some sort of damage, like a good scuff on the bumper or a cracked taillight or a little dent on a fender etc.<br>  <br>  With the terrible market you should be able to get it down close to $6,500.  That seller might not go that low though, they're just a little too high and that's what they think it's worth.  Keep shopping if they won't play ball.<br>  <br>  One other thing, for a car in that price range you should really be checking the paper/online ads and not dealers.  Always take an older car like that to a mechanic to get checked out and always run a carfax on it.  OK, I guess that wasn't just one more thing.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.kbb.com/KBB/UsedCars/PricingReport.aspx?YearId=2003&Mileage=114000&VehicleClass=UsedCar&ManufacturerId=49&ModelId=295&PriceType=Private+Party&VehicleId=3211&SelectionHistory=3211|30166|32714|0|0|&Condition=Good&QuizConditions=" rel="nofollow">http://www.kbb.com/KBB/UsedCars/PricingR...</a><br>  <br>  The search was done with private party values, even at a dealer, with this market, you should be able to get the private party prices.

RbsRpcIyaa	In all honesty, either would be a fine choice. 4Runner's hold their value very well (as do Accord's), and with proper maintenance will run for many thousands of miles. I've seen 4Runners in our shop with 700K miles on them. Their owners are a very loyal bunch, too.<br>  <br>  Accords are always going to be high on the list of "top choice" cars. That will never change, as they are solidly built, somewhat sporty, and last a long time as well. I just sold an '06, but the time I spent with the car was good. <br>  <br>  Hard to choose between the two... I'd probably check insurance first and have that be your "tiebreaker". <br>  <br>  Good luck.

Such as two vehicles approaching an intersection with a 4 way stop at the same time.The vehicle to the right has the right of way.

72ddVB2iaa	Jim is right. <br>  <br>  Imagine when you would get a merry-go-round going when you were a kid. You put your energy into the spinning part in pulses. The merry-go-round keeps going around even though you let go. An internal combustion engine does the same thing with the fly wheel. It stores energy to keep the engine turning between power strokes. A heavy fly wheel is harder to get going, but stores more power. A light fly wheel accelerates faster, but has less stored energy. A single cylinder needs the larger fly wheel to get it to the next power stroke. A multi-cylinder engine can get by with a lighter one.|`|6e36b9837420adb6b906ae01a1e722d4aa	Inertia.<br>  <br>  There's No "Explosion"<br>  There's Combustion.<br>  <br>  Even school books still teach that engines run on explosions.<br>  <br>  A Good Demonstration to display the difference would be a BIrthday Cake  or an Oil Lantern<br>  <br>  1 Cake with Candles<br>   vs another with sticks of TNT.<br>  <br>  1 Lantern fueled by kerosine<br>   vs another fueled by Nitroglycerin|`|gnonlDpiaa	All engines have a flywheel that keeps the engine moving.

Some bikes have graduated chain adjusters to control the back and forth movement of the rear axle, while they help, they usually cannot be trusted to ensure proper wheel alignment, especially on cheaper bikes.<br>  <br>  It is very important not to overtighten the chain.

The transmission, the car, yours?<br>  <br>  The transmission has both fill and drain plugs.  323i's produced through 2/2000 use either Dexron III or Texaco ETL 7045E.  The transmission should be marked to show which is required.  From 3/2000 on they use ESSO LT71141.  Again, the transmission should be marked.  If they are marked, you WILL need too use the (expensive; $16.95/qt, roughly, 6.2 quarts required) BMW fluid to refill it, but it's still much cheaper than buying a new transmission.<br>  <br>  Go to a BMW specialist (find one near you on bimrs.org) and they'll have the right fluid and other parts available to do the job.  If you fancy doing it yourself, bavauto.com sells the fluid, filter and gaskets you'll need.  Be warned though, it's a messy job, and it's important to keep the inside of the tranny scrupulously clean!|`|gsjjiRGFaa	i have an idea. price a new transmission from the dealer, then ask them if they'd simply do the fluid exchange for you. the price of the new one is what it would cost to have my-my's garage put an end to your drivers' car's transmission. gamble...then pay.|`|HylaEat6aa	What I have learned and heard about in the BMW's that the trans is sealed such as the Cadillac CTS is sealed also. Now with Cadillac CTS there is a special tool so you can flush the trans and I believe BMW is the same way, Good Luck
t3Zuec0taa	For pure power performance, the supercharger is better. The only issue is that, if I remember right, you have to get new headers and a few other parts because the stock parts can't hold up against the added force of the supercharger.|`|43DHFQnKaa	quite frankly i do not think there is either a supercharger or a turbo installation that is available for your v-6.<br>  there is not a large aftermarket following for this car,  plus the engine cannot handle the stress from the high heat generated from a turbo or supercharger.....<br>  if you want increased performance best to upgrade the vehicle.<br>  <br>  cheers 04 cobra|`|d1dd02060cdb51c9ddd303817ecbf6eaaa	You can't do this car that way that cheap.

pFw7tJcNaa	Heya,<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, an ipod auxillery input is not availible on the '06 infiniti G35 by standard, it is only availible as an upgrade. However there are much more cheaper and reliable ways to connect your ipod to your car. Check your local electronic shop for 'Lighter' connecting jack inputs. They have several ones, for example if your radio system is out of default and has a cassette player, their is an extension to connect the Ipod through USB with an external cassette that plugs into your cassette drive. That is a much safer bet in quality over the 'Radio-Frequency' lighter connection where it scans for an open frequency to broadcast your ipod through your radio. It's a lot less wires and hassle, however you often get static and disruption in your music. <br>  <br>  Before purchasing, have you considered upgrading your infiniti? The newer models have integrated Ipod auxillery plugs. Quick-Easy and affordable. Food for thought. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|7edf5543fb479567c4ec66d9c2af3698aa	Go to bestbuy. They have it.|`|hj9dIgDOaa	you can go to a shop and do it or you can buy a monster cable they sell them in radioshack it goes on youre cigarrete lighter and you can hear it on youre stock radio|`|Ik5FBrSRaa	i think thats an extra add on. and only comes with some models
2HKSwHkSaa	As for reliability, Hondas are generally known for their longevity.  Neither of the cars are considered a "fast" car.  Given that the Audi is stock, that may be the better choice between the two vehicles.  When someone starts to put aftermarket parts on their vehicles, you have no idea whether or not the work was done properly.  You may have less problems with a stock vehicle, hence my recommendation for the Audi.  Depending upon where you live in the NE, the Quattro AWD could be beneficial if you ever get caught in a snow/slush mix.|`|IA7Gy9TAaa	Stay away from the audi, it's too old.  Repairs will be outrageously expensive because it's a luxury vehicle and you'll have lots of very expensive additional breakdowns because of the four wheel drive system.<br>  <br>  The Civic should be much more reliable and repairs will be cheaper when you need them.  But, with the performance mods, it scares me a little.  That's a sure sign that it was driven hard--FYI, mods like that add exactly $0.00 to the resale value.  Most buyers would consider it a detractor that would decrease the value, don't let him tell you "but it's got this $800 exhaust and a $300 intake."  Take Kelly Blue Book private party and deduct a little, say 10-20%, you can tell him the factory exhaust that he removed was well over a thousand dollars, so you'd like to get the $200 deduction off the price.<br>  <br>  You might want to consider a different Civic that doesn't have those mods.  If you want mods, do 'em yourself.  When buying used, you want grandma's car that just went to church and back, not something that was an extra in the fast and the furious.|`|W7IKifoEaa	The A4 will be a little faster (not too much) because it has a V6 unlike the civic with the 4 cylinder. But in terms of reliability, the honda will probably have that beat, unless the audi was taken care of well (oil changes and other maintenance).I like the styling of the audi a little more and the price is a little lower on it too. But, have them both checked out in person and you decide what fits you best. Oh and the Audi will definitely be better in snow and stuff.
3NoQuoWuaa	Your right . That response from that attorney didn't sound right. Maybe it's because you don't have a case or at best a weak one. You should  call another attorney and get a second opinion. Unfortunately you didn't provide enough information about your claim for any one here to comment one way or the other.r|`|bW931jBaaa	Asking in automotive is not going to get you the answers you are looking for.<br>  There is no set amount. It depends on your attorney and damages along with the insurance policy and the insurance companies willingness to settle the claim.<br>  Attorneys have the right to decide if they want the case or not. Most P.I. attorneys work on contingency so if there is no surgery, the payout will be a lot less. In turn, they will not make as much.|`|qaiYanF2aa	There are usually guidelines your atty will have about what kind of settlement you might get.  The seriousness and longevity of the injury is a part that is considered.  How much was your income loss and medical costs for this injury etc.<br>  <br>  There are tons of attorneys advertising for personal injury and many will take your claim on a contingency so they take 30-40 percent for their fee but you don't have to pay up front.  I guess something (60%) is better than nothing.<br>  <br>  They generally will not take your case unless they think they can win a substantial amount.  So look in the yellow pages for Attorney, Personal Injury.  Get organized - have the doctor's description of your injury, how debilitating it is, cost of medical bills, and whether or not it has made you suffer loss of income, etc before you call.<br>  <br>  Good luck!
4dntstR9aa	Try an inhouse financing lot - usually it will say "Buy here, pay here' or in house financing.  There are generally several in larger cities.  They cater to people that don't have good credit.  You might want to save another $500 or so and you may find that with $2000 down, you will have a better chance of getting a truck.  $1500 only gets you into a car on my car lot, the trucks run a bit more, because they are more expensive than a car.|`|3MTYGEbWaa	You have two chances in this crappy economy - slim and none. You could get a co-signer or, as someone else suggested, go to a buy-here-pay-dealer. If you do, understand that you will overpay for the car and be charged the maximum interest rate allowed by your state laws.|`|cSGfoQWEaa	Not much with this economy.

S4soZUFCaa	I'm going to say your neighbor for allowing his property to wander onto yours. Have you told him about it before?|`|1hciyvKdaa	Ask your neighbor kindly to put a  stop on the fence, nicely. Most people dont like to be told what to do. You could also put a stone in your driveway and stop it from happening too. If you took pictures and spent the money like 300.00 to file in small claims you probably would win, but do you have 300.00 to start the process?<br>  I know how it feels to get damage like that. But unfortunatly if they do not want to talk about it, let alone fix it, theres not much you can do. You could have the PD come out and take pics of the damage, which might scare the neighbors into offering you some cash possibly. Sorry not as easy to fix the damage already done, but preventing it is easy and you can do that yoruself.|`|4dntstR9aa	Thats a tough one to prove the fence was moving and you weren't.

I am into the A4/B7 and specifically bought last year because it was the end of production for that particular model. My friends and I have tricked out our rides with various choices, with mine being Stasis engine mods and an Oettinger body kit.<br>  <br>  I ordered my ride straight from the factory and when it came time addressing my wheels, I decided not to touch my factory wheels.

Red emblems on the wheels would be a nice detail, not really pro pinstripe. If you end up wanting to do you calipers they do make a brake paint that you can do yourself. I would suggest doing it soon, if there is any rust on the caliper the paint will eventually peel. They also make stickers for the calipers, you can get them pretty cheap, some say audi while others are just rings.<br>  <br>  And most importantly get some clear cornered headlights, cars looks so much better without that orange blinker.|`|7f3559ac6e13d1f4904fbf38bd395141aa	Nice ride, and yeah, the blacks would look good.

crhJLuw5aa	Sounds like you may have a small amount of water in the gas tank. It's not at all uncommon for condensation to form on the inside of a gas tank.Since water is heavier than gasoline, it usually stays on the bottom. When you filled it up, it stirred it around, causing some of it to go through the fuel lines. This explains why the problem happened 3 minutes after filling it up. Go to the auto parts store & buy a can or two of gas-line antifreeze. It's main purpose is to remove the moisture from your fuel system. Ask the clerk at the store, he'll know exactly what you need.<br>  <br>  And don't worry - you do not have bent connecting rods in your engine. Although you can get a lot of good advice here, unfortunately, a great deal of advice that you get in this forum is total hogwash from clueless idiots. I guess maybe that guy is so used to lying & cheating his customers, he just can't help himself.

Then you fill out a form and have your local police dept. come verify the Vin and sign the form then they will issue you a new title.|`|AA12060283	I would find out what paperwork he has and call the local County Court Clerks office and ask if that is sufficient to obtain a title before I buy the car.|`|6iUIsLqgaa	You should also consider that such a car may be expensive to insure.

OmcBziKVaa	We had an 06 Escape and it was awesome. I'm not sure what the guy above me is talking about. Ford did a good job squeezing everything they could from the V6 version. (If memory serves, it is a 3.0 liter) <br>  <br>  The traction control always worked well, and visibility was good too. The only issue we ever had was the CD changer sometimes threw fits. <br>  <br>  The only time it  ever almost got stuck in the snow, we were up in the mountains in Colorado and it had snowed for several days before. The person driving missed a turn and we ended up at the bottom of a ravine in a deep snow drift. All hope seemed lost. After a few creative driving decisions, however, we were free and underway.<br>  <br>  Personally, I enjoyed driving our Escape and I was sad when the lease was up and it was time to say goodbye.<br>  <br>  If its the type of vehicle that you're interested in, I'd say its a pretty safe bet. That said, just like any used car, make sure you get the vehicle's service history with it if you can.

n7jXAQFWaa	You're right to be concerned about the original cause of the failure. Though it's rare, a diode may have failed short, causing all kinds of havoc. Any number of components could have failed short, causing a sustained current flow that burned the wiring harness. You could take the regulator apart and see if there's a particular spot that the burning seems to have come from. It is also possible that a connection came loose at that harness and arced repeatedly until it gave up the ghost. If you're certain that the wiring external to the regulator is good then you may be safe putting the new one in.

de45ca1499f4d0d18904bae45463c319aa	The great thing about the civic is that if you want to make it faster you have a huge amount of options.  Like most people said, a motor swap is probably the best way to start.  Most people go with a B series motor from an Integra, but the Prelude's H22 and the newer K series motors are also a good but more expensive option.  Intake exhaust and headers are also a good cheap place to start.  The power increase from these will certainly be noticeable, but nothing to really get too excited about.  If you really want to make power, you're probably going to want to go with some kind of forced induction.  There are a lot of turbo and supercharger kits out there for either a B series or even for the D series motor like the one you currently have in your car.  As far as cost goes, however, you can't beat nitrous oxide.  Contrary to popular belief, "NOS" which it's sometimes incorrectly called will not make your engine explode and kill you the first time you use it.  The problems only arise when incorrectly install your system and/or you use too much.  This will make your engine run lean, which in extreme cases can make your motor get way too hot and will definitely cause damage.  As long as you keep it to a 50-75 horsepower shot, however, you should have little to worry about as far as the reliability of your engine, even on a stock D series.  I have been using a ZEX wet shot of nitrous in my 3000GT regularly for over a year now and so far no problems.  I hope this is helpful, good luck with your car!|`|tFLWcKZNaa	ebay you up a cat converter test pipe they real cheap and bolt in easy and look stock also the cold air intake with a k&n helps too. spoon has a chip that would knock ur socks off and its cheap also. ebay got all the toys your lookin for good luck!!|`|0jt4eX61aa	sell it, get an american made v8, and call the v8 your "honda civic 1996 ex" and boom! it will be faster!...or you could have a friend help push your little 125hp car down the road lol|`|bkhvdfJxaa	turbo it....or swap it to a b series....|`|Yq2CUhtYaa	Engine swap.

Just slightly more than a tune up would have gotten you.<br>  <br>  So, swap the engine, then turbo it, if you actually want some serious speed.<br>  <br>  If you want to pretend like you have speed, then waste your money on the I/H/E setup.|`|hpxc5szsaa	try installin or getting a turbo installed,check to c if u can replace the intake manifold to a bigger intake manifold hole...the exhaust...

Good Luck!|`|gOQ5mZ7Xaa	1. Harleys or 600cc Jap cruisers are a great way to start. They're powerful enough for fun factor but heavy enough so it equals out the power-to-weight and so you are relatively safe. That said, the best way to start would either be a Suzuki SV650 for the cruisers or a Kawasaki Ninja 250R for the mini/starter bikes. Take the motorcycle course, get your bearings, then you can move onto the real stuff. Buells or Triumphs are great 2nd bikes. Buell used to use Harley engines but the 1125R has marked a turning point in that area. It's quite a powerful bike, but its overall performance would put it squarely between a Supersport (600cc superbike, light, torquey) and a Superbike (1000cc+, light, very fast).<br>  <br>  2. Keep all your wits about you. Depending on where you live people who don't see you will take no prisoners.

8e61fa24656c3d78a47369750bd463c5aa	I assume your talking about Bernoulli's principle.  It teaches that fluid and air compress, move more quickly, and at reduced pressure in areas that compact the fluid, such as through the center of an hour glass.  That principle being applied to a wing arch, will result in lower pressure at the top of the wing, resulting in low enough pressure to induce lift sufficient to keep the aircraft aloft.  Recent research has indicated that this, combined with impact lift from underneath the wing, combine to keep aircraft aloft, the ratios of which depend on the regime of flight.  (Angle of attack, airspeed, etc.)  There is still controversy regarding the ratio and benefits of impact lift.  Lift from other surfaces, such as the fuselage itself, can also impact total lift forces.  I've included a link below to further explain the mathmatics behind the principle, if interested.<br>  <br>  When taxing a light aircraft, you make a right turn by using the right rudder pedal.  Most light aircraft have the main front tire tied to the rudder pedal controls.  Depressing the rudder pedal with the heel of your foot causes the front tire to turn in that direction.  <br>  <br>  Also, many light aircraft have differential braking, with each main wheel brake controlled by a toe tip brake pedal that operates separately from the rudder pedal.  <br>  <br>  In addition, propeller torque can be used to assist or hinder the turn, depending on the direction of turn and propeller spin direction.  Tail dragger aircraft may require a zig-zag type of taxi to ensure the area is clear to turn prior to commencing the turn.  <br>  <br>  Larger aircraft may utilize a tiller system to control the front wheel.|`|ce3a012f7dc74d0e5642db83df28e35aaa	Exactly Bernelle's principle, Which was observes when he was watching the fluid flow threw a valve in a sewer pipe and noticed that when water pressure increases so does sped.<br>  <br>  The basic principal of lift.<br>  <br>  Sorry this references the air flowing over a wing rather then under the air over goes faster if I am correct creating a vacuum thus creating lift.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Cheers|`|sXAPuQ2uaa	Bernoulli's prinicple.

Just keep an eye on the oil level.  it isn't that hard.|`|f0fa5d20c7885a68086170144dc95bddaa	Some engines have a oil safty switch.

AA10747736	Two things come to my mind, in that this is your first truck I would suggest that you consider the cost over anything else. I mean how much is this going to cost you out of your pocket each month just to own the vehicle. Not how much it costs to keep it on the road but just the payment. The second thing that comes to my mind is every driver dives different and that includes cars and pick-ups as well. I can drive my little truck and get 26 miles to the gallon. My son can drive the same road with it and get almost 28. Two different drivers. I will also tell you that some drivers like to brag a little bit, and there are other factors that enter the picture as well, like altitude, and maybe some idiot drafting off the back of your rig, road conditions and so forth I think I would look at the cheaper of the two and go with that. Being new You will never earn as much as the seasoned driver and it will make your payment a little bit easier. good luck in your choice|`|XbvQiEDxaa	may be dont'know you should thing your self
AA12095978	my guess would be the idle is set to high.<br>  there should be a little screw that the butterly valve touches at idle.. back that off to 700rpm when the engine is warm.<br>  when it's cold, there should be another adjustment for that.  <br>  Otherwise, the idle air control valve, which is bolted to the throttle body, it looks like acylinder with a connector on it is sticking or not functioning right.<br>  the IAC valve pushes a solenoid out when the car is idling, when your foot's off the gas then the throttle plate would fully close, turning off the car, so when you stop, the IAC pushes a solenoid forward just enough to pop the plate open to keep things idling.<br>  <br>  also.. check your alternator output.. should be past 13 volts.  Why that?  some cars, and your Escort is actually a Mazda 323, when the alternator isn't producing enough voltage, the car computer kicks up the idle on its own to try and force voltage out of the alternator.|`|BkgEBkuvaa	I thought ford had a recall on those paticular vehicles. Did you check with a dealer to see if there is one. They should be able to tell from your VIN|`|cOVBmq3saa	there are pins under the hood in most cars to control the idle. you can tweak it and turn down if you can find where it is in your car.

Maybe a contaminate floating closer to the top of the fuel tank, when you get lower it starts getting sucked in by fuel pump.<br>  <br>  Your fuel pump could be on the way out. I had a truck that wouldn't start when cold out unless I jumped it. Turned out that my fuel pump was weak and just shy of the required psi to start, but had enough psi to run fine.

IOWKDSj4aa	oxygen sensors work by a chemical reaction between the two sides of the sensor.  it generates a signal by 'sensing' the difference in the oxygen in the outside air and the oxygen in the exhaust gas.  when the difference is high (rich mixture) there is a high voltage signal (close to 1.0 volt) from the sensor.  when there is a little difference (lean mixture) there is a low voltage signal (close to 0.1 volt)<br>  <br>  the problem, if I read your question correctly, is that if there is no exhaust gas passing by the sensor.  that means the sensor is reading the same oxygen content as the outside air and that means there is no signal from the sensor to the control unit.  when the signal from the oxygen sensor is near zero (indicating an open circuit) or when the signal doesn't change (indicating a short circuit) the control unit will put the check engine light on<br>  <br>  sounds like what's going on in your engine.<br>  <br>  hope that helps

82wXvW3baa	Well, bomber airplanes are pretty much just like airline airplanes, other than the fact that there's a switch that can let you release the bombs. Bombers are slow, not very maneuverable, and not "so fun" to fly. But if you like big airplanes and would like to fly them, a bomber would work.<br>  <br>  Fighter planes are fast, agile, and able to do lots of neat stunts. It's a lot funner than a bomber by my experience in Flight Simulator. But fighter planes are a bit harder to fly, and the controls are really sensitive and everything happens so fast. <br>  <br>  If I were you, I would choose fighter plane.|`|GK5gL307aa	I would say a fighter pilot is generally more intense over a longer time than a bomber pilot. In a flight, the fighter pilot can drop bombs, fire missiles, pull high G's, etc. The bomber pilot flies over the target and drops his payload (this is a simplified explanation obviously). If you can handle the demands of both positions, do more research and decide yourself. You can't really make decisions for your life based on the opinions of other people.|`|atJxwFssaa	If I were you, I would choose fighter pilot. Some fighters are on the cutting edge of technology.|`|c34895fb3078ed6b839d8ec9443a9ab2aa	Well, statistically the USAF will probably decide for you unless you are in the top three slots in your class-so the question's moot.   Fighter guys are deployed more often-or at least used to be.<br>  However, if you prefer fewer PCS moves and TDY's, then bombers may the choice for you: for instance B2's are ONLY at Whiteman, B1's ONLY at Ellsworth and Dyess, and BUFFs at Barksdale and Minot.|`|XsZsk55Jaa	If you're asking your not fighter pilot material.  Any fighter pilot will tell you there are only two types of airplanes:  fighters and targets.

Especially these days, don't just take the 1st estimate you receive, people will compete for your business.

KQXCVt33aa	Hello Cindyrella: Congratulations for this question! Is more than a question, is a great service to our community. After I saw this video, I was wondering how many of the millions of car accidents were caused for a defective tire and nobody has ever found out.<br>   Is so scary to be so indefense without laws that protects us. Must be millions of dollars the tire companies  "donate" in order to silence whoever is in charge to protect the driver's rights, otherwise there is not another explanation why this very  important subject is ignored for most of us. Thank you Cindirella for bringing this life saver topic to our community,<br>  I think this is precisely Yahoo Answers intention: to let us have an space that we can use to have fun but also to share very useful information like this. I would said your invitation to see this video is EXTREMELY USEFUL.<br>  Thank you  again<br>  Crystal

YupMCYHlaa	We have a Toyota Prius.  There are several possible bad effects.<br>  <br>  One is that the batteries are only guaranteed for 100k miles.  After that they go out, one by one (there are several of them, 24 I think, something like that) and they have to be replaced.  Its possible that they could end up costing whatever it was that was saved on gas during the car's lifetime.<br>  <br>  Another disadvantage that detractors always bring up is that the manufacture of the batteries causes more pollution than would have been made just burning the extra gas.  I don't really think that's true, but I guess it's possible.<br>  <br>  Service is a little more complicated because there's a gas engine just like a car but also the electric motor and all the batteries, so it's more complex.  And you can't use the Prius to jump-start another car because it doesn't have a conventional 'car battery'.<br>  <br>  You can probably find more if you Google 'hybrid disadvantages'.|`|gOQ5mZ7Xaa	The bad thing about hybrids is that they don't actually give you better fuel economy. Diesel has actually been found to be much more fuel efficient than, say, a Toyota Prius. In fact Top Gear UK did a test, 10 laps of their test track, a Prius going as quickly as possible around the track and a BMW M3 E92 that simply had to keep up. 10 laps over, and the verdict was that the 4L V8-powered M3 actually got better mileage.<br>  <br>  The other problem is that hybrids are actually more harmful to the environment when they're being mass produced than most other cars, and the range of the electric engine is small and therefore you have to rely on the petrol most of the time anyway.<br>  <br>  Really the only two economy-friendly fuel types are diesel, and hydrogen as seen in the Honda FCX Clarity and BMW's Hydrogen 7, which is basically a 7-series converted to run on hydrogen. Cost-effective wise though diesel is the best option, so long as you get a small one that does 60mpg+, although the exception to this rule is the Jaguar X-Type Twin-Turbodiesel, which gets more mpg than one of the most economical cars in the world, the Volkswagen Polo BlueMotion.|`|aa9gieAIaa	the best application for a hybrid is stop and go traffic, as thats where the electric system tends to recover the most energy that would be lost braking. they are an interesting development but the gas engine used is no more efficient than other ones. the batteries are expensive and do die with time. the nickel metal hydride batteries used are partly responsible for "dead zones" where nickel is mined(nickel is VERY toxic) lithium batteries cost the worlds reserve of metallic lithium quite a bit i hear. they need a lot of copper compared to other cars. the car dose use more resources/energy to make is the big problem with them plus they might cost more to maintain. id recommend a regular economy car personally, the small turbo diesels are super!|`|H8XpaaPDaa	top gear is rigged, they are biased against anything that is ecofriendly. watch the video they did on the tesla roadster, they LIED in the video to make it look bad, they say the range was bad, and that it took a long time to recharge...<br>  <br>  and with the prius vs the BMW, common sense says a 1.4 litre hybrid will obviously use less fuel than a big honkin BMW engine. they clearly lied on their part. there is NO WAY IN HELL a hybrid can get worse mileage than a BMW...just common sense. but there are other internal combustion engines that get better mileage than hybrids. like that 65 mpg ford in europe.<br>  <br>  the disadvantages i'd say about hybrids are the following:<br>  <br>  mainly, the price. its expensive to put both an electric drive and gasoline drive system into a car. its simply less expensive to make the car either completely electric, or completely gasoline.<br>  <br>  secondly, currently, MOST hybrids use nickle metal hydride batteries. and to get nickle, its not that ecofriendly. BUT soon, cars will have lithium ion batteries, and lithium has been label as a non hazardous material by the government. but eventually the batteries won't give charge. but don't worry, the batteries will definitely last over 7 year. did you know that toyota used to make fully electric RAV4's? they have the same batteries as most hybrids, and its been reported that several RAV4's still run over 200 000 miles WITH THE ORIGINAL BATTERIES! so you won't really have a problem with batteries dying on you. even with the newer lithium ion batteries, they should last even longer. and when they do die, they get recycled. lead acid batteries in cars have a 98% recycled rate. and lead is a non valuable metal. since nickle and lithium are more valuable metals, not recycling them would only be considered stupid.<br>  <br>  <br>  last disadvantage, you still use gas. still use money on gas, and you still pump all these chemical into our air. but manufactures are comming up with fully electric cars in 2-3 years. so you'll save a LOT of money on running costs, and you'll help the air. did you know electric car's use less electricity than your average clothes drier?<br>  <br>  so to sum it up, hybrids are expensive to purchase, most hybrid batteries are made in a non ecofriendly way...but its gonna change, and you still use gas. the first answer makes a great point too, its harder to service because its more complex. actually, i was watching a local tv station, and they were talking about how old experienced mechanics are going to college part time to learn about hybrid cars.

9ee6572e98b952a4bf68a1e6e6c2b500aa	It isn't always possible to tell.  You "should" be able to get away without doing the upgrade but that is not a certainty.  I know you are looking for a definite answer but with that amount of power it is hard to say for sure.<br>  <br>  To look at it from a mathematical view..<br>  650w RMS output / 0.8 (80% efficient amp (class D)) = 813w input<br>  That means you need 813 watts of input to fully power your amp.<br>  813w / 14.4V (running voltage of car) = 56A.  <br>  <br>  So in order to fully power your system you would need around 56A (A = amperes).  Your stock alternator is 105A so that means you would have about 49A left to run your vehicles normal tasks.  After considering that your system will only pull a full 650w RMS for short periods of time you could come to the conclusion that you may have enough to get by.  Then again the output rating on the alternator is probably a max value and is actually less when at idle or lower RPMs.<br>  <br>  My suggestion is to do the big 3 upgrade first.  See if that helps you at all.  You will need to do it if you upgrade your alternator anyways so you might as well see if it fixes your problem right away.  If it doesn't you may need a new alternator.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!!!|`|IoxiPiAxaa	i got a 1996  gmc jimmy with a brand new sound system pushing out 300 watts rms and my **** dims a lil bit but my alternator is fine...u got about double my rms range but for a old alternator its about over like 600 or 700 watts rms from my knowledge...if your subs are already hooked up turn ur car on and crank ur system. Turn on ur headlights and if they dim pretty deep then that means ur losing power to your ur car which would eventually overtime cause u to purchase a new alternator....if u got a cap it should be reading between 13.5 and 14.8(Volts) which is what your alternator is slightly reading which is real good...the cap pretty much tells you how much voltage ur alternator is pushing out and allowd the power drawn from ur battery not to drag.|`|70ayLPi9aa	you will definitely need a new alternator  650rms which is 1300 watts peak and every 70 amps is 100 watts your good but i dont know how long it will stand try this web site i bought a 200 amp alternator for 219 dollars www.dbstarter.com|`|tnkp8n2Zaa	mdc has a good answer, most stock alternators can handle that amp just amke sure to use a fresh quality battery, a battery in poor condition will suck more amps to charge it that could be going to the amp.<br>  i wait to turn on the stereo a few minutes in the morning and turn off the stereo a few minutes before my destination to help keep it charged.<br>  i all so use a multimeter to keep tabs on my charging system and battery voltage.

2cb3153c313f04e3810e6bc6151a9494aa	Alot will depend on the driver and the situation... but in terms of total performance potential, it's the GT3.  The Turbo is an excellent car and one with some pretty high limits, but is is designed to be a touring car, and this is an essential part of it's character.  The GT3 was designed to be the base model to homogolate a race car, and that is it's essential character.<br>  <br>  The average driver is likely to be able to get more of the potential of the Turbo due to it's power and AWD, but a good or great driver will get more from the GT3 and it's higher limits.  The GT3 is the better handling of the two, and this along with it's lighter weight are where it has it's advantage over the Turbo.|`|REiunI0Faa	The GT3 is a better focused car, while the Turbo is more powerful.

hG8FMFUeaa	local shops average mechanic in average store 5-600 weekly starting out on commission. average mechanic pay at strong store 1-2000weekly.  specialty dealership ie bmw jag mercedes etc.. 1500-3000 average monthly. but to get into a specialty shop you need an extensive education. starting out at a shop fresh out of school expect to be a helper for a while until they feel you have enough real world experience to become a second tech. finally after a few years under your belt you will possibly move up to a lead technician or specialized technician where you can make decent money.|`|a3838c0cd2f7f63124657ac7f4657dfbaa	There is a wide variation between shops. In my area a good mechanic is in the $40.00. an hour range. The so called guy's around $25.00. It takes many years before a good mechanic is so classified. You have to know the vehicle from bumper to bumper and every thing in between. In addition it takes a lot of keeping up as technical things change every day. From my experience I found it best to specialize in one area for a few years then move to another. That way you know how every component effect the other. By that time you are good. Not an overnight thing at all but very rewarding and you will be much sought after.

A 390 would drop right in, but that's a lot more rare than a 351W.

But they are both very similar. This has been compared too many times. Its all in the person. For me, the Evo VIII or the Evo IX for the years 2007 and below. But brand new 2008+ STi I would go for, because its not about the ugliness of its headlights, its the performance. But the Evo X is good as well and I will take it in a flash too if I had no other choice besides the STi.|`|AA11340447	Performance aspect: The Evos up until the 9th generation.  The tenth generation of the Evo is as good or almost as good as the new Subaru WRX STi.<br>  Time and time again the Evos win at time attacks, 1/4 miles, etc. in comparison to the WRX.  Even in unmodified form they're a better performing car.  However, when considering rally racing, the Subaru wins.  The WRX was built for dirt performance more so than the Evo even though the Lancer got it's start back in the 1970's as a WRC car (World Rally Championship...or something like that).  Depending on what you're going to use the car for, mostly going around town, maybe some tuning, I'd pick up the Evo.  But if you're going to be doing a lot of off-roading or driving in places where there's more dirt roads, snowy, etc., might want to think about getting the WRX.<br>  Looks, well, that's all about what you like.  Personally, I go for the Evo, there's just something about the WRX's body and lines that FAIL to me.  Besides, I like a car with a nice fat *** and the Evo's got that.|`|hcKSzhTfaa	by looks i like the blue subaru with the gold rims and the sound of the loed exhaust but spec wise the mitsu is a better car with more HP and torque. it depends on the models though because im not so sure about older models but as of now the mitsu is faster.|`|843rdpRVaa	EVO Viii MR FQ-400 son.<br>  get on it|`|3WL9AgwGaa	Evo is more powerful, and better looking, but Subaru is more comfortable and cheaper.

W3KqA9t1aa	If the accident was caused by medical issues you should not have a drivers license or be behind the wheel of a car anyway. You are a rolling hazard and a danger to other drivers. And knowing this, you chose to continue driving without any insurance to protect the people that you are putting at risk.<br>  <br>   I can't comment to the bankruptcy.

Owning and driving 4 cars I must adjust to the "feel" of the brakes in each vehicle.

It is very dangerous to alter the required fluid level of any closed hydraulic system.

nv5Mewe3aa	Usually the only adjustment (if there is one)(rare) is found at the connection closest to the hood. The point that holds the sheathing back may be able to be adjusted via a screw action. Similar to a bicycle break, you'll want to make the distance between the sheath and the hood latch further apart. <br>  <br>  Most of the time this happens when the plastic sheathing to the cable is damaged. Hood cables run under the fender well generally, and when a car "bottoms out" the tire can rub the cable sheathing. Once this happens the cable will flex at that point and the give in the line, causes failure. the relationship between the plastic sheathing and the cable is what makes this system work. <br>  <br>  I have just had to replace them most of the time. Good news is they are not that expensive and you can find them in a junk yard for even less!<br>  <br>  Hey one last thing, if it is kind of working... lube up the latch really well to make it easier on the cable system. that might get you by for a while.|`|69442f28405cb7b4b2d9ecac676332ceaa	Try putting a small loop in a portion of the exposed cable.  Then secure the loop with a stiff piece of wire or a hose clamp.  That should take out enough slack and if it does not work, you have not damaged anything.|`|MvKm409gaa	There is no adjustment in this cable. If you are pulling on the cable from inside the car and the other end of the cable isn't reacting, then the cable is broken.
140b1c561177bc5cc3baf4ae5b15a6a8aa	A Hand-Wash is by far the most thorough, and you can keep track of any problem areas on the car's paint. <br>  But touchless automatic car-washes are a god-send in winter weather.

Never use dish washing liquids as these will strip the wax off your paint and dry out the paint. Wash the car from top to bottom and wash wheels first so you dont blow grit back on the clean car.

And they're under $200, another $120 to install depending on what shop does it. The acceleration difference will be VERY apparent. Don't fear the gear.<br>  <br>  Then he can do a full exhaust, larger mass airflow sensor and a free flowing air filter. I'm not sure what the thought on aftermarket lower control arms is with the new Mustang, but it was a needed improvement in the fox body (79-93) Mustang.|`|lIxEKA1xaa	just think more air in, more power. Cold air intake, high flowing exhaust, headers help out a fair amount if you get nice tuned headers instead of the cheaper stuff. if u can find a supercharger or turbo kit for $1000 that would be the best but its hard to find one for 1000 bucks, they are usually 3000-4000. He can try throttle body spacers but never really found good gains from them.

dztKGMAQaa	The ES is a higher trim line than the LX.  (If you want leather, for instance, you have to buy the ES.)  In that generation of 626, you could get either engine - there was also a 2.5-liter V6 - with either trim line.<br>  <br>  There were some running changes made to the 626 in 2000: the suspension was retuned for less softness and crisper handling, and some of the items that had been deleted for '98 - '99, like the heater ducts to the rear, were restored.

abnqs0jQaa	If you want to mod it rediculous amounts, then go with the Impreza. There is a much larger pool of products that can be applied to that vehicle than to the Saab (which I assume is a 9-3). A ton of after-market producers make mods for WRX's and the Impreza is based off the same chassis and so forth, so there will be more available.<br>  <br>  That being said, if you want a car that is not like every other vehicle out there, get the Saab. They are deceptively quick, especially in mid-range acceleration, and definitely are modifiable though companies like Nordic, BSR, and Hirsch. Plus you get great mileage. My 9-5 only has a 2.3L engine, but still has ~260hp, and I still get 30+ mpg on the highway. There are plenty of tuned Saabs out there, just check you tube for videos... Good luck with the purchase.
PwHQSAxvaa	All materials, but especially metals, will expand when they are hot, and shrink when they are cold. If the railway tracks had no gaps between sections, they would buckle in the heat, and cause a crash. Lintel bridges would also buckle if they were big enough, and not divided into sections with gaps. Modern bridges of this type usually have the sections on rollers.<br>  <br>  Telegraph lines need to sag because being taut could cause them to snap if they shrink in the cold.|`|96a318bea85eb2aa7d0b38b893875fb9aa	Railway tracks and bridges have cracks in them to allow for heat expansion on very hot weather.

Open up your wallet, and take out the spare key and unlock the doors.<br>  <br>  3. Call up a friend, and have them get your spare key from home for you.  Open up the door with your spare key.<br>  <br>  4.  Is there a window open enough to get at least an arm through?  If so, you can (or find someone nearby who'll fit) reach in and open the door from the inside.<br>  <br>  5.  Do you have membership in an auto club or subscribe to a roadside assistance plan, such as AAA or Better World Club?  (Or can you be "stranded" there with a friend who does?)  Does your auto insurance come with a roadside assistance package?  Or maybe a credit card perk of roadside assistance?  These roadside assistance companies usually offer lockout services.<br>  <br>  6.  Do you have proof of ownership available somewhere (like the title or registration, or the bill of sale) either on you or at home?  Can you have a friend drive you and this proof of ownership, and a copy of your Accord's VIN, to a Honda dealership?  Visit their service department, and they should be able to make you a new spare key that'll open the door by looking up your keycut code attached to your VIN (make a new key without copying a master).<br>  <br>  7.  Call a roadside assistance company, tell them that you're not a member, but that you need assistance and are willing to pay (good credit card) for whatever lockout services that they can send out your way.  Alternately, call a locksmith.<br>  <br>  As an absolute last resort you could use a "slim-jim" or other metal coat-hanger-like device to reach through the window and jiggle the door lock mechanism to unlock, but you are more likely to damage the door innards than to correctly manage to unlock it on the first try...  <br>  <br>  Well, almost last resort - if there's a small animal or a child locked inside, you'd be better off to smash a window (the smallest one that'll work) and get in that way, as it would be immediate, but then you'd have broken glass to clear up and then you'd have to fix the window, but you'd be in and have your locked-in keys!|`|YXqNaTwpaa	get hammer<br>  break windows<br>  get keys<br>  fix car<br>  <br>  now you live happily ever after|`|tX2giFynaa	Locking yourself out of a car can really put a dent in your day. If you left a window slightly ajar or if your car is an older model, try these tips to break in and retrieve your keys.<br>  <br>  Step1<br>  Straighten out a wire hanger. Then bend one end of the hanger to form either a hook or a triangular handle.<br>  <br>  Step2<br>  If the car is an older model, pry open a window by slipping a putty knife between the window and the door.<br>  <br>  Step3<br>  Slip the bent wire hanger through the window opening.<br>  <br>  Step4<br>  Maneuver the hanger down along the window. Attempt to either pull up the door lock or push the lock button, depending on your car's lock style.<br>  <br>  Step5<br>  If your car is a newer model, you'll have to call a locksmith or tow truck. Your attempts to break into it could cause permanent damage.|`|b6qe5syVaa	if you can wedge a metal coat hanger (straighten it out and put a hook on the end to pull up on the lock) and you will have to bend it and work with it till its got the perfect anle. i had a 96 kia and this is what i always had to do, i became a pro. i would wedge it from the upper side door.  good luck!|`|etKzA9lKaa	You could try and open it with a wire hanger, but i wouldnt want to mess with it. Suck up your pride and call road side assistance or a auto lock smith and just pay them to get your keys. Then have 2 sets made!|`|4TmN5Dohaa	slim jim call the cops.|`|Bj3BgdLRaa	the first:(for cars that have the pull up locks) take the wedge and place it in between the rubber where your door and the frame meet, slide the wedge in as far as possible. Then take the coat hanger unfold it and stretch it out. then tie the shoe lace to the coathanger and make an extra knot but dont tie it all the way.<br>  Then slide and coat hanger and the knot in the space provided by wedge and loop the extra knot onto the lock and pull the end of the shoe lace so it tightens around the lock. Then simple just pull up to open the lock|`|ND1nFEWSaa	only two ways;.........<br>  <br>  at parts store, buy the tools to do this, comes in a kit<br>  <br>  or put masking tape on paint to protect paint upper right corner, pry open the door here with large screwdriver, leave it here and get a few more screwdrivers and pry open the door frame until you can insert a long pole or metal rod to reach in and hit the power door lock button|`|GVsD724zaa	See if your car insurance has roadside service. If it does, you can call for someone to get them out.   If you don't, Check your credit cards for roadside services. Sometimes JC Penney has it on theirs, I know some levels of American Express have it on there, like the gold level comes with it.  And many others.  If you are really stuck, call a locksmith, they can open the door quite easily I believe.|`|iPpmhjR1aa	try calling your roadside assistance if you have it, see if they cover locksmiths for this type thing! then you wont have to pay any money! other than that, idk man.  they have stuff for it at auto stores...if you can get there (and it doesn't always work) <br>  maybe you can feed a clothes hanger through the window and pull the handle?|`|6G4hcPzAaa	lol<br>  i have no idea how to get em out<br>  call a stranger over! wait i dont think you should do that...?<br>  police?<br>  the place where you got your car|`|lj1OCKGDaa	Well you might just have to order new keys|`|TQoM8vCZaa	call the cops. theyll open it for $30|`|KsMLHzbzaa	get another key. why are people so dumb to only have on e key for their vehicle.

THEN POLISH THE CAR.|`|mC838ZbLaa	Peanut butter it acts like a mild abrasive|`|wpgRMjgraa	Just use WD40 and then wax the surface after you are finished.|`|v6NdNE4xaa	they make stuff speciffically for this problem called tar and glu remover<br>  <a href="http://www.safechemdirect.co.uk/index.php/vmchk/Valeting-and-Transport/Tar-&-Glue-Removers.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.safechemdirect.co.uk/index.ph...</a><br>  or pop down too local halfords where you can pick up some auto-glym tar and glue remover doesnt harm paint work and works a treat<br>  <br>  edit. instructions will be on botlle but generally you spray on leave for a minute or too then blast off with pressure washer|`|AA12155452	Some sort of spirit will be necessary but use it sparingly on a soft cloth and only at the site of the tar.  Shampoo well after and buff up with polish. If the area covered is large, perhaps you should take it to to the body shop for help.  I also understand that Halfords do a propriety tar remover that may be safer, .....|`|1tilPTPVaa	white mineral spirits  or kerosene will do it, fast and easy (won't hurt the clear-coat either)|`|f5wTQblsaa	Petrol on a clean cloth|`|2uZivThaaa	Wow! I would be pissed! Just ask her what it is that will remove the tar and look it up online to see if anyones done the same thing and see what their experiences were. You just don't want to take the wife's word for it and screw up the paint on your car! Also try going to an auto store and asking them as well. But honestly I would have the builder  take care of it. It was their fault that they got tar on your new car.|`|tGUnM2XCaa	you can use stuff like WD40 or Petrol lighter fluid, then re wax the area to protect it, if you dont like the idea of doing that then simply buy some T-Cut, I can pretty much guarantee that'll remove the tar without damaging the paint, :)|`|RiQA4Epraa	theres bug & tar remover<br>  just get that<br>  <br>  and after its off<br>  wax your car,<br>  protects the paint, makes it shiny<br>  and makes dirty anbd crap easier to get off next time|`|O4tp5yqyaa	take it to a car detailer and make the builder pay for it|`|86614701880e2be8375f9ccf054f2fb7aa	i have used wd-40 it works great.
NPl8mciqaa	hi- i have been looking for this too and so far i have only found this information on it:<br>  <br>  Artist - Commission Track - Soundtree Studios<br>  Title - Gofindit<br>  <br>  not too sure what that means but, it is better then nothing!<br>  <br>  p.s-they don't sell it on itunes either :(|`|N7LlOAcOaa	What is that? lol|`|lIxEKA1xaa	it would be kinda hard to answer that because this section is for repairs. maybe ask somewhere else
WpA8i0hhaa	take it to a mechanic that specializes in Ford Power Stroke and have him do a diagnostic on your injectors. sounds like you could have a weak one or even a bad one. also it could be in your valve cover gaskets, they have wires running threw them and its common for a wire to break causing your injectors to misfire.|`|RiQA4Epraa	try cleaning the IAC valve
Bj3BgdLRaa	A 19MM or 3/4 inch socket worked on my c5 3/4 is a tiny bit loose, and will probably muck up that sheet metal cover 19mm is oem. I would not use an impact wrench on it .

If you have to go to a dealer, it is much more costly.  Call around and ask. As long as you can drive, you're OK.
