Il sindaco di salerno, De Luca ( centrosinistra), in merito alla situazione dei  rifiuti in Campania oggi, a domenica in, ha detto:   1) la camorra non è responsabile della situazione, ma la colpa è da addebitare esclusivamente alle amministrazioni locali   2) è profondamente ingiusto che le altre regioni si debbano fare carico dei rifiuti campani   3) vanno individuati i siti e se necessario bisogna usare la forza contro i manifestanti che si oppongono allo stoccaggio in questo o in quel sito.   Insomma, la camorra è responsabile o  è solo un capro espiatorio ( come sostiene De Luca)?

My boyfriend and I have been together for little over 2 years (on and off) but we have never met before. We've gotten really close to meeting but it could not work out. I know that he is who he says he is so I dont worry about that.       He is 18 so he is not able to rent a car and check into a hotel (both require the person to be 21). So, I was looking around and I saw this place kind of close by where you can rent the room for however long needed. I want him to stay there and me visit him, sleep over, etc. The thing is that I don't want them to question our age. Him being 18 and me being 17. I'm turning 18 in a few months and he is turning 19 next month. The age of consent in Hawaii (where I live) is 16. I'm over the age of consent so could the "owners" of that place call the police on us because he's an adult and I'm still a minor?

First off I will let you know that this happened in the state of Virginia. (Loudoun County)Back in August of 08 I got pulled over for driving on suspended. The reason I was suspended is due to a DMV required Driver improvement course was recieved at DMV a few days late. Anyways, I have all of the documents of proof and was told by a court appoiinted lawyer that since I had moved and hadnt changed my address yet that DMV had no proof of a certifed letter that I was suppossed to sign for proof of knowing about the suspension. She said it would possibly be dropped, and not to worry. Well the court date came, and I missed it. I was in the beginning of a seperation/abandonment with two kids, and alot of other personal problems that were on my mind and completely forgot. I called court the next day and explained, I was informed that I had a bench warrant for my arrest, so  turned myself in and was released. The second court date was issued to me at the time of my release. It was not until February 3rd, which was yesterday, and yet again due to all of the stress on my mind, I missed it. Also my court appointed lawyer confused me andd told me it was on the 4th and not the 3rd, so I called court today, and surprise, I have another bench warrant for my arrest. I have no idea what to do, and im on probation currently from another event that happened around the same time. (contributing to a minor misdemenor) I got a year suspended and year of probation. This has all hit me at once. I have sspent more time in court the past two months than I have at home it feels. So many different dates and times, and stress and being a single mother doesnt help the situation. I tried calling my lawyer and of course she isnt in the office. Left a message, no return call. Please help me because I dont know what to do, is this going to affect my probation, and give me the suspended year sentence? I cant spend a year in jail for something this minor when I have two young children ages\s 3 and 5. Has this happened to anyone else, and do you have any advise for me? Please help me im really sscared, and upset. Thank you for your time.

When you enlist in the military you serve your contract time, then you are released to become a civilian.  When you sign up they make it very clear that you are obligated for 8 years to be ready to be called up in times of crisis.  This weekend I got called up and thought how unlucky I was.  When I called my friends, they were called up too.  Not one or two, or even three, but everyone I knew was called up.  Then everyone they knew who were in the IRR was called up.  I don't know what is going on, but it is not exactly the change I voted for.  Any news? Rumors, gossips?  Details, anything?

I'm going to do some research to see if voters can recall a bad Speaker. She's like an anvil around Obama's neck, not that I like him either. He's hell-bent on passing this stimulus bill that will saddle future generations of Americans with so much debt, it's unconscionable. Yesterday Pelosi claimed that 500,000,000 Americans (yes that's the number she gave at a press conference)would loose their jobs each month if we don't pass the stimulus bill right away. Perhaps she just misspoke, but a week ago, she wanted to use a few hundred million dollars out of the stimulus package for condoms (presumably, do reduce the population, thereby reducing government costs). Lord help us get rid of this nutcase.

I want to keep importing goods that are historically Chinese, but things that were traditionally made in U.S.A.  should come home. Nixon opened trade with China and I was very happy about it.  In fact, although I am a Democrat, I voted for Nixon for that reason and because he said he would stop the Vietnamese war.  He did both.  Who ever dreamed it would come to this, that China would take over manufacturing nearly everything we use.  I wanted to trade their goods for ours, not have them make everything we buy!  Question 2.

One night years ago .. out drinking at a party .. she was there with her bf at the time ,,, and she introduced me to his friend , who i ended up spending a drunken night with. Well within a week she and her bf had broken up and she went on to start dating the 'friend' in which i hooked up with. They dated for a few years and had a kid together. I got to know him while they were together, and we became friends -NOTHING MORE. They eventually broke up , and i continued to stay friends with both of them. In time - it was inevitable and bound to happen - she and i stopped being friends. She moved on to date other men and eventually became seriously involved with another man, living with him and everything. I still hung out with her ex and his family, they were always good to me - unlike her (too much too get into) - and i ended up hooking up with him (the ex) for a short amount of time - and yes that means i did sleep with him. Nothing serious came of it, but we still remain friends.      The sex happened 2 years ago   I started talking to my ex friend again about 6 months ago .... and she asked me if i ever slept with her ex ... i told her the truth. and now i endure nothing but harassment and threats from her and her friends.      i look at it this way - if we want to get technical   - i had him 1st   - she and i were no longer friends when it happened   - it was a year and a half after they broke up - and by this time she already had a live in bf - and a few bfs before that   - and finally, i dont see how this affected her in reality in anyway at all- besides maybe the thoughts she has about it that obviously drives her nutz      Now she has threatened to 'punch me out' knwing im not a fighter   her and her friends constantly bring it up and harass me and tell me im going to pay, and ive 'messed with the wrong ppl'      Okay i can understand shes mad but its the past - it affected her in no way ... and im sick of the harassment      Is it really that bad that i deserve to be hated in her words 'til death'? and constantly harassed and threatened? and if i dont deserve this - as i dont beleive i do - what can i do to make it stop?

So in the mean time, I've moved to Hawaii for school and got no letter about my court date. I assumed i would get a notice when my supervision was coming to a close.

He thinks that giving a deadline will put the blame on republicans, for not passing pork loaded bill. He needs to say cut the pork. If he did that, bill would already of passed. The true problem is the Democrats need to add unrelated pork. Is anyone fooled by this weak ploy. If you ran on cutting waste, now is the time to act, if he were serious. If this bill passes our dollar will be worthless. What happens when China demands payment, war, give them a few states? Any bill should be done without throwing us into unbearable debt. When the next emergency hits does China have bottomless pockets. We need to bite the bullet and make do, I see this bill as treasonous. Stop wasting my money on interest. We have passed our hay day, so paying it back later, will be harder than not borrowing it in the fist place. The only way I could justify this action, is if you had proof the world will end in 2012.

20090204231102AAtpRSL	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Would this be considered 'time wasting' by law authorities ?	for no apparent reason an individual walks up to an ATM and withdraws ￡150 from his/her account.       Having done so, this individual then walks straight into the bank and joins a cue. He she then wishes to deposit this ￡150 back into his/her current account, using a 'withdrawal slip'. There is a cue, and its a busy afternoon.      The individual feels satisfied with their banking today, and so walks back outside and momentarily has a cigerette before joining the cue behind the same ATM they withdrew their ￡150 from.      Now the individual takes out ￡250.   The individual proceeds to walk back into the bank and stands in the cue patiently, like an ordinary civil citizen.       Ah yes, the individual finally pulls out their withdrawal slip and fills it in patiently and wishes to deposit back into their current saving account, the very ￡250 he/she took out a couple of minutes ago.      Satisfied with their banking business, the individual walks out of the bank and re-joins the cue at the same ATM they withdrew money from.      This time the indiviudal takes out ￡40 and walks back into the bank.      The cue is longer this time, but that doesn't deter our hard working civil citizen. The individual asks the bank to open up a 'seperate account' for them to deposit the ￡40 in, which they do but at the customer services corner.      When banking business is finally done, the individual walks back out of the bank and has a cigerette and a cold fizzy drink beverage.      However, this Individual has more serious personal 1-to-1 banking to do, therefore he/she now wishes to go back to the ATM and withdraw ￡200.      The individual eventualy deposits this money back into their account, upon being quizzed about why and what they are doing, the individual simply smiles and replies 'personal banking sir/madam, is there a problem with providing me a service ? ' .      so grudgingly the bank comlpete this individuals banking transaction and the individual walks straight back out and joins the back of the cue at the very ATM he/she has been using.      The customer now wishes to simply 'check their bank balance' on the ATM, and then hits 'YES'  under 'is there another service you'd like?'      The individual comes to the realisation that they do not wish to withdraw any more money today, and finally having satisfied their banking needs - goes home.      is this person well within their lawful rights to bank this way ?   or is this in some way warranting a confrontation with a banking staff member or perhaps the bank manager ? Can somebody STOP this type of banking ? If so whats the law called to do this ?      Could the law punish you for this type of 'personal banking' ?

I feel like I'm going to end up like both of my dead beat parents if I don't do something about it. I don't have much motivation to just continue going to school (for art) and then trying to make a living with an art degree. I don't want to struggle my whole life.      I'm really interested in joining either the air force or the navy. I need someone to kick my *** and teach me self discipline and all that good stuff. I need to get out of this small town and feel like I'm accomplishing something.      I've been skydiving and was scared as f*** but it was cool. I'm not too fond of the ocean becuase I'm scared of not knowing what's beneath my feet when I'm floating in the abyss. I'm also a really bad swimmer, but I can run, and I'd say I'm a pretty tough girl.      A friend said don't go navy because it kills you more mentally than physically, and that the air force will actually give you a good education.      Which is a better option? Tell me about your experiences if any.
20090205005351AANrEjO	Politics & Government;Politics	Why do democrats think they will save the economy?	Taxes, big spending, government handouts, "spreading the wealth" around...      why don't people get it?    Most misinformed people think that the government giving poor people money is a good thing. It isn't. It kills work ethic, it creates unemployment, it creates no incentive to do your best and compete in the world...

20090205002530AAnhsLW	Politics & Government;Politics	What is the real definition of freedom to you? :D?	With everything that has happenned in the states.     Everything that has happened in the world.    What do you think we should have as freedoms?    I think we should all be free to do whatever we want whenever we want as long as it doesn conflict with life or cause death or cause any negative effects to any other human being. Course this would mean the legal system wouldnt exist anymore. The medical practise could be driven on its oath rather than profit driven. The money system would definately have to go. People don't need money it ***** up people ethics and makes people think everything that gives them profit is ok. If people worked together and took care of the whole world and all the people therein we would not be in other countries conflicting and opressing people and the bountries would drop. Of course religion has to go. It has caused more death throughout mans history. Anyways you may comment on my answer and give one of your own I will not accept any answer I just want to see replies to this. Thank you for your time :D

Now, this is something that's been bothering me since i was about 12(these are the things a kid like me thinks about).   Why does the world put so much emphasis on race? primarily the USA.   i notice that lots of people place an odd priority on race. for instance. "It's an historic day in American history, the first African American President" first of all. he's not African-American. he's American. just like Asian-Americans, or Mexican-Americans. they're not anything other then; American.  they were African in Africa, but now that they're in the US of A, they're American.  end of story. next point of why raciallity is not important.      "Dems for da white folks!"   Stop complaining about your great great grandfather being my great gran-daddy's field worker. I'm mainly 70% Irish. (along with most Americans, there's more Irish blood Americans then there are Irishmen now.) I don't complain about my ancestors being enslaved. you think im going to go up to some guy who's family once owned mine and ask for 100 thousand dollars to ease my pain and suffering? no, that doesn't make any since.That person didn't do anything, what you'd be doing is profiling. which is wrong.      so I'll restate my question encase it was lost in the furry of my fingers.   Why does the world put so much emphasis on race? primarily the USA.?

My mom got insurance for me on HER car, not my stepdad's. Today I asked my stepdad to drive my mom's car. He said to drive his instead. I told him I should drive my mom's for insurance. He said just to avoid any accidents.      So I took it. I drove all day, no problems. Later tonight, my sister asked my mom for me to take her to the store. She gave my sister my stepdad's keys again. So I took her there. Then I went to the bank. On the way home, I got pulled over for an expired tag and driving uninsured. I got two tickets and the car was taken to the pound.      This, to me, is BS. My stepdad told me to take his car. It's his fault that the tags are expired. He told me that it's my fault because I didn't ask for permission to also go to the bank, and that it's my fault for driving his car.      Is there any way to get these tickets expunged or anything? I have enough points on my license.      I live in Georgia. Please offer any advice or input. :(

The judge ordered us to go to investigations based upon the allegations. However, the investigator said he would give me my son to me based upon the allegations and proof I had. Anyhow, the investigator mentioned to me that maybe we should work things out and before the third month we can drop all cases against each other, being she wanted full custody and I wanted joint. I did, I lived with her during those three months and even put her and her daughter on my medical and dental insurance. I paid for the food, my son’s diapers and pretty much everything. Anyhow, come court date being she was my ride and I was at her apartment, she was suppose to give me a ride. Plus we were supposed to go into court explaining we had worked things out. But no, she left me behind and I did not make it to court. Therefore, the judge ordered me pay 2500 dollars of her attorney cost, and now I only get to see my son every other weekend for only 2 days. She left me at her apartment and didn't even wait for me.         She lied to me and played me obviously. I did not want to take my son from her, I really loved her and wanted to make things work, but she had other bad intentions.       Anyhow what can I do, I was fighting this alone and initially I had a strong case but now in the eyes of the court I’m a dead beat dad. That is not the case. What can I do, how should I approach this. How long do I have to appeal??? Any advice would be great.      Thank You

He's completely covered in Warts, they are all up his arms, on his hands, and some on his neck and face and god knows where else.      This person is a serious health and safety risk, i've seen him chopping carrots with his bare hands, and picking up bread, and wiping surfaces, and generally doing many jobs without washing his hands. He also does other disgusting things like scratching himself in some "areas" and itching his hair and then going straight back to whatever he was doing like peeling potatoes or serving up salad.       The only reason he is working in our cafeteria is because he is the Manager Chefs son, and I believe that's the only reason he's working there.       It's really disturbing, I wont eat from the cafeteria at all now, unless it's soup which I know has been boiled etc. Another thing is, when there was a health and safety inspection 2 weeks ago, he mysteriously wasn't around for the whole two days...      Would I be "evil" for considering to get him fired, it really is unhealthy for someone covered in Warts to be serving up food... Also, I wouldn't know how to go about doing it, it's not like i can just go to the manager and say "Hey, fire this guy, he's really unsafe!" because it's her son!!!      Some help please? Should I feel like a horrible person for thinking like this about someone with a disability, I'd feel absolutely terrible if it was me.. :(

20090205002015AAwPnVs	Politics & Government;Elections	Which parts of America are safest from biological/nuclear attack and are most affordable? Obama's tanking!?	he Impending Obama Meltdown   [Victor Davis Hanson]      Some of us have been warning that it was not healthy for the U.S. media to have deified rather than questioned Obama, especially given that they tore apart Bush, ridiculed Palin, and caricatured Hillary. And now we can see the results of their two years of advocacy rather than scrutiny.      We are quite literally after two weeks teetering on an Obama implosion—and with no Dick Morris to bail him out—brought on by messianic delusions of grandeur, hubris, and a strange naivete that soaring rhetoric and a multiracial profile can add requisite cover to good old-fashioned Chicago politicking.      First, there were the sermons on ethics, belied by the appointments of tax dodgers, crass lobbyists, and wheeler-dealers like Richardson—with the relish of the Blago tapes still to come. (And why does Richardson/Daschle go, but not Geithner?).      Second, was the "stimulus" (the euphemism for "borrow/print money") that was simply a way to go into debt for a generation to shower Democratic constituencies with cash.      Then third, there were the inflated lectures on historic foreign policy to be made by the clumsy political novice who trashed his own country and his predecessor in the most ungracious manner overseas to a censored Saudi-run press organ (e.g., Bush is dictatorial, the Saudi king is courageous; Obama can mend bridges that America broke to aggrieved Muslims—apparently Tehran hostages, Rushdie, serial attacks in the 1990s, 9/11, Madrid, London never apparently occurred; and neither did feeding Somalis, saving Kuwait, protesting Chechnya, Bosnia/Kosovo, billions to Egypt, Jordan, the Palestinians, help in two Afghan wars, and on and on).      Fourth, there was the campaign rhetoric of Bush shredding the Constitution—FISA, Guantánamo, the Patriot Act, Iraq, renditions, etc.—followed by "all that for now stays the same" inasmuch as we haven't ben hit in over seven years and can't risk another attack.      Fifth, Gibbs as press secretary is a Scott McClellan nightmare that won't go away, given his long McClellan-like relationship with Obama (McClellan should have been fired on day hour one on the job). Blaming Fox News for Obama's calamities is McClellan to the core and doesn't work. He already reminds me of Reverend Wright's undoing at the National Press Club—and he will get worse.      Six, Biden is being Biden. Already, he's ridiculed the chief justice, trashed the former VP, bragged on himself ad nauseam in Bidenesque weird ways, and it's only been two weeks.      And the result of all this?      At home, Obama is becoming laughable and laying the groundwork for the greatest conservative populist reaction since the Reagan Revolution.      Abroad, some really creepy people are lining up to test Obama's world view of "Bush did it/but I am the world": The North Koreans are readying their missiles; the Iranians are calling us passive, bragging on nukes and satellites; Russia is declaring missile defense is over and the Euros in real need of iffy Russian gas; Pakistanis say no more drone attacks (and then our friends the Indians say "shut up" about Kashmir and the Euros order no more "buy American").      This is quite serious. I can't recall a similarly disastrous start in a half-century (far worse than Bill Clinton's initial slips). Obama immediately must lower the hope-and-change rhetoric, ignore Reid/Pelosi, drop the therapy, and accept the tragic view that the world abroad is not misunderstood but quite dangerous. And he must listen on foreign policy to his National Security Advisor, Billary, and the Secretary of Defense. If he doesn't quit the messianic style and perpetual campaign mode, and begin humbly governing, then he will devolve into Carterism—angry that the once-fawning press betrayed him while we the people, due to our American malaise, are to blame.    http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q... 
20090205002721AAMg9qX	Politics & Government;Elections	Obama wants the troops home within 16 months.  ALL of the top generals state that will cause an Iraq implosion?	So, what do YOU suggest?      "        Snatching Defeat From The Jaws Of Victory          CENTCOM commander General David Petraeus, supported by Defense Secretary Robert Gates, tried to convince President Barack Obama that he had to back down from his campaign pledge to pullout all US combat troops from Iraq within 18 months at an Oval Office meeting on January 21, sources have said.      But Obama informed Gates, Petraeus and Joint Chiefs Chairman Admiral Mike Mullen that he wasn't convinced and wanted Gates and the military leaders to come back quickly with a detailed 16-month plan, according to two sources who have talked with participants in the meeting.      Obama's decision to override Petraeus' recommendation has not ended the conflict between the president and senior military officers over troop withdrawal, however.  There are indications that Petraeus and his allies in the military and the Pentagon, including General Ray Odierno, now the top commander in Iraq, have already begun to try to pressure Obama to change his withdrawal policy.      A network of senior military officers is also reported to be preparing to support Petraeus and Odierno by mobilizing public opinion against Obama's decision.      Petraeus was visibly unhappy when he left the Oval Office, according to one of the sources.  A White House staffer present at the meeting was quoted by the source as saying: "Petraeus made the mistake of thinking he was still dealing with George Bush instead of with Barack Obama."      Obama, who was never even a boy scout, has the arrogance to believe he knows better than his generals.  He prefers to take his military strategy from the likes of Cindy Sheehan and Media Benjamin."    http://www.dailystar.com.lb/article.asp?... 
20090205003601AAPeLwi	Politics & Government;Elections	I see THREE HUGE BETRAYALS of Obama's specific campaign promises.  Can you add more?	He said he would always allow the public 5 days review of bills he planned to sign, yet he's not doing that.      He said he would not allow lobbyists in his administration, but he has.      He said he would be open and transparent but has shut off WH press conferences to just email alerts and is still hiding many documents.      He said he would take a scalpel to waste but his bailout bill is one huge bankrupting lardbucket of pork.      He said he would strive for honest government but he's rejected Richardson for fraud, Daschle for tax evasion, he's put on Tim the Treasury Sec. with his tax evasion and another one too, and last week 46 subpoenas hit his staff...      wait that's 5, I'm sure there's more!

They probably opined at what genius he had for there SHOULD have been a door at that location!  Obama is TANKING.  Internationally threats are piquing.  He's an unmitigated disaster after only 14 days, his approval rating has dropped 29 points!  There's only 28% approval for his lardbucket bill.  He utterly ignored the people dying in KY from the cold, and more cold is expected and he's still eating $100/lb beef cuts in his 85 degree office, presenting a front which looks like "let them eat snowcones" and very anti-rural-southerner.

I have consulted an attorney, but they want 1500.00 and we just don't have that kind of money.  I need to know if I can file it myself with the court systems here in Texas.  The biological father is on board.  He is ready to sign them away and just let us have her.  Please if you know anything, let me know.  She is 6 years old and is very smart.  It is only a matter of time before she starts asking questions I can't answer.  I am going to tell her about him eventually, but she is too young at this point.  This will make her entire life seem like a lie.  My fienc'e is the only father she has ever known.  She knows nothing of her biological father.

I can't tell my boss im getting a raise, why are they telling us? why are we letting them? We have become weak and are letting our employees run all over us, a business can't operate like that, how could a country? Why are we letting them print money? Yeah PRINT MONEY!

Why does the idea of an individual citizen having the right to bear arms (lets say a fully automatic assault rifle) seem so absurd to some people, while at the same time they are comfortable with the U.S Government alone having 5,535 Nuclear Warheads. Guns and Nukes are both for protection, but why would gun control advocates want to take the last of my little ant power away, is it because they feel like an unheard voice when going against the government so instead conform to the government asking them to take away my little power? If do ever lose my sanity I'd be limited to harming a handful of people where the government did lose their sanity killing 200,000 people and now have the power make humanity extinct. If you anti-gun people can disarm the major powers of their Nuclear Warheads, Aircraft Carries, Battle Ships, Submarines, Attack Choppers, Battle Tanks, Surface to Air Missiles... I will be happy to throw what piss ant power I have into a trash can.

Iran arrests US diplomat on sexual charges  Thu, 05 Feb 2009 08:02:41 GMT  The First Secretary of the US Interests Section of the Swiss Embassy in Tehran is released after being arrested on sexual abuse charges.    According to Iranian police, the diplomat had an indecent sexual relation with an Iranian woman in his car in public after promising her marriage, Iranian daily Entekhab said Thursday on its online edition.  The police, patrolling the Tochal resort in northern Tehran, suspected the diplomatic-plated car in a parking lot and approached the vehicle.  http://www.presstv.ir/detail.aspx?id=846...     ---- I didn't know that could be done -- in this country those diplomat plates might as well say "god" on them   --------------------------------------...  Russia says it is ready to help initiate talks between the US and Iran as President Barack Obama has pledged direct diplomacy with Tehran.

Does anyone think a disadvantage of our economy is the fact that the government is bailing bigger businesses out?

Is a disadvantage to our economy the fact that who ever has a bigger presence around congress is more likely to survive? Please explain.

20090205021855AAtKlSM	Politics & Government;International Organizations	Shocking revelation about Swiss Bank Accounts?	I received the following e-mail from a friend. Read and answer the following question.   1) Can this be true ?   2) If yes, what we as ordinary citizens can do to book the culprits.      Revelation of Swiss bank accounts       This is so shocking.......If black money deposits was an Olympics event.... India would have won a gold medal hands down. The second best Russia has 4 times lesser deposit. U.S. Is not even there in the counting in top five! India has more money in Swiss banks than all the other countries combined!       Recently, due to international pressure, the Swiss government agreed to disclose the names of the account holders only if the respective governments formally asked for it. Indian government is not asking for the details.......no marks for guessing why?       We need to start a movement to pressurise the government to do so! This is perhaps the only way, and a golden opportunity, to expose the high and mighty and weed out corruption!       Please read on......and forward to all the honest Indians to.....like somebody is forwarding to you.......and build a ground-swell of support for action!       Is India poor, who says? Ask the Swiss banks. With personal account deposit bank of $1,500 billion in foreign reserve which have been misappropriated, an amount 13 times larger than the country's foreign debt, one needs to rethink if India is a poor country?       DISHONEST INDUSTRIALISTS, scandalous politicians and corrupt IAS, IRS, IPS officers have deposited in foreign banks in their illegal personal accounts a sum of about $1500 billion, which have been misappropriated by them. This amount is about 13 times larger than the country's foreign debt. With this amount 45 crore poor people can get Rs 1,00,000 each. This huge amount has been appropriated from the people of India by exploiting and betraying them. Once this huge amount of black money and property comes back to India , the entire foreign debt can be repaid in 24 hours. After paying the entire foreign debt, we will have surplus amount, almost 12 times larger than the foreign debt. If this surplus amount is invested in earning interest, the amount of interest will be more than the annual budget of the Central government. So even if all the taxes are abolished, then also the Central government will be able to maintain the country very comfortably.       Some 80,000 people travel to Switzerland every year, of whom 25,000 travel very frequently. 'Obviously, these people won't be tourists. They must be traveling there for some other reason,' believes an official involved in tracking illegal money. And, clearly, he isn't referring to the commerce ministry bureaucrats who've been flitting in and out of Geneva ever since the World Trade Organization (WTO) negotiations went into a tailspin!       Just read the following details and note how these dishonest industrialists, scandalous politicians, corrupt officers, cricketers, film actors, illegal sex trade and protected wildlife operators, to name just a few, sucked this country's wealth and prosperity. This may be the picture of deposits in Swiss banks only. What about other international banks?       Black money in Swiss banks -- Swiss Banking Association report, 2006 details bank deposits in the territory of Switzerland by nationals of following countries:       TOP FIVE       INDIA.................................... $1,456 BILLION    RUSSIA................................... $470 BILLION    U.K...................................... ....$390 BILLION    UKRAINE.................................. $100 BILLION    CHINA.................................... ....$96 BILLION       Now do the math's - India with $1,456 billion or $1.4 trillion has more money in Swiss banks than rest of the world combined. Public loot since 1947:       Can we bring back our money? It is one of the biggest loots witnessed by mankind -- the loot of the Aam Aadmi (common man) since 1947, by his brethren occupying public office. It has been orchestrated by politicians, bureaucrats and some businessmen.       The list is almost all-encompassing. No wonder, everyone in India loots with impunity and without any fear. What is even more depressing in that this ill-gotten wealth of ours has been stashed away abroad into secret bank accounts located in some of the world's best known tax havens. And to that extent the Indian economy has been stripped of its wealth. Ordinary Indians may not be exactly aware of how such secret accounts operate and what are the rules and regulations that go on to govern such tax havens. However, one may well be aware of 'Swiss bank accounts,' the shorthand for murky dealings, secrecy and of course pilferage from developing countries into rich developed ones.       In fact, some finance experts and economists believe tax havens to be a conspiracy of the western world against the poor countries. By allowing the proliferation of tax havens in the twentieth century,

20090205074112AAXkVK6	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Is it against the law to issue a stop-payment on a check for this reason?	I have an employee that has worked for me for about 3 years, he is a sub-contractor for the roofing company i co-own. On the last job he completed I issued him a $1700 check, since we were choosing not to use him again, I issued it on the promise that he would return our trailer he uses the next day, pictures from the last job, and he needed to fill out his new w-9 for 2009.      The next day when he brought the trailer it had been damaged, all the wiring had been pulled, the cost to fix was estimated at $840. He also filled out the paper work with a different ssn than he had used in 2008. And didn't bring any pictures of the last job.      At this point I met with the other owner and we decided to issue a stop payment on his check.       We got a cashiers check subtracting the amount for trailer damages, the loss we would take for no pictures, and had it put in the name he had given us last year. So the cashiers check was in the amount of $700.       I called him yesterday and he advised me that he wouldn't take any money as he was going to get a lawyer.      Was it illegal for us to issue a stop-payment? Am I being fair? Could we get into legal trouble now?

20090205033721AAe9mWB	Politics & Government;Politics	Is the Secretary of Labor nominee now in trouble too?	A seemingly innocuous letter sent to the Clerk of the House of Representatives last Thursday by President Obama's Secretary of Labor nominee Hilda Solis raises serious and troubling legal questions about her nomination and apparent violation of House ethics rules. Not only was she involved with a private organization that was lobbying her fellow legislators on a bill that she has cosponsored, but she apparently kept her involvement secret and failed to reveal a clear conflict of interest.     http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Pu...

I have recently enlisted in the Marines and when asked about prior drug usage I admitted to using marijuana four times in the past in high school. My waiver was sent through and approved. I scored a 98 on the ASVAB so I have the capability to do about any MOS (or so i'm told). My question is what effect will my moral waiver have on my MOS choice or for that matter anything I do in the military?

20090205035113AAB40h9	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Whats the difference between public and private health care in the uk? is private better?	I don't really know the difference except that private is supposed to cost more. I've been to seen multiple doctors about problems and they don't seem very interested. Recently I've seen doctors about a pain in my side, some have said there is nothing wrong and others have said I could have a small hernia and that they'd refer me to a hospital which I've still never been to. My sister was really ill one year and she was prescribed the wrong medicine which made her worse. I appreciate our health care in the UK and all the doctors and people in that profession that look after people but I can't help but wonder if we'd get better care and treatment if we paid more for private health care.      I don't know the differences between them really though so I was just wondering what your views are and why you think what you think.

20090205043816AAaY9fJ	Politics & Government;Politics	The HOLOCAUST! Has there ever been a concerted, unbiased attempt to prove it, one way or the other?	I mean the "Holocaust" as in gas chambers, and several million exterminated? I think the fact that a lot of Jews died in the camps is indisputed, including some shooting-pit executions (we've all seen the films). There are lot however, who dispute the use of devices such as gas chambers, and who dispute the numbers claimed.   Has there ever been a concerted attempt to prove these points, or are they just unproven beliefs, like God? Thanks.   btw--I ask because in recent days it's become increasingly clear to me that its acceptance is very, very handy indeed, in some quarters.
